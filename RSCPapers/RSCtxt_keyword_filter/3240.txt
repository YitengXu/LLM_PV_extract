    , Accepted 18th February 2016First published on 19th February 2016AbstractThe role of remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films is still controversial, some investigations have revealed that the remnant PbI2 plays a passivation role, reduces the charge recombination in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and improves the performance of PSCs, but the opposing views state that remnant PbI2 has no passivation effect and it would deteriorate the stability of the devices. In our investigation, the CH3NH3PbI3 films have been prepared by a two-step spin-coating method and the content of the remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films has been tuned by varying the preparation temperature. It has been found that increasing the heating temperature could increase the coverage of spin-coated PbI2 films, which has led to high coverage CH3NH3PbI3 films and more remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films, and as a result, the performance of PSCs was enhanced obviously and the maximum power conversion efficiency of 14.32 ± 0.28% was achieved by the PSCs prepared at 130/120 °C (PbI2 films were heated at 130 °C and CH3NH3PbI3 films were heated at 120 °C). Furthermore, the dark current, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence emission decay measurements revealed that the charge recombination in PSCs has been gradually suppressed and the fluorescence emission lifetime has gradually increased with the content of remnant PbI2 increasing. Thus, the passivation effects of the unreacted and decomposed PbI2 in improving the performance of PSCs have been confirmed unquestionably.
Introduction
With their advantages of large absorption coefficients,1 suitable band gaps,2 weak exciton binding energy,3 high charge carrier mobilities4,5 and long carrier diffusion lengths,6,7 organolead halide perovskites (MAPbX3 and FAPbX3, MA = CH3NH3+, FA = NH2CHNH2+, X = Cl−, Br−, or I−) have been attracting extensive research attention for their photovoltaic applications8–12 since CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 were used for the first time as light harvesters in dye-sensitized solar cell configurations by Miyasaka and colleagues in 2009.13 During the past six years, an explosive growth has occurred in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs); the PCE rapidly increased from 3.8%13 in 2009 to a certified 21.0%14 in 2015.
Mesoscopic and planar architectures are the two most widely adopted configurations for PSCs. A typical mesoscopic-PSC consists of a TiO2 compact layer, a TiO2 nanoparticle scaffold layer, a perovskite absorber layer, a hole-transporting layer (HTL) and a metal (Au or Ag) back electrode, and they are successively deposited on a transparent conductive substrate.15 For planar-PSCs, the TiO2 nanoparticle scaffold layer is absent and the perovskite absorber layers are directly deposited on the TiO2 compact layer. The performance of PSCs strongly depends on the quality of the perovskite absorber layer including its crystallinity, morphology and composition.16–20 Good crystallinity and favourable morphology could enhance light harvesting and promote charge generation, separation and transportation. Additionally, perovskite films also play an important role to separate electron-transporting layers (ETL, TiO2 compact and scaffold layers) and HTL and suppress charge recombination through avoiding the detrimental contact of ETL with HTL, which requires perovskite films to have high compactness and coverage.21,22 Two-step sequential deposition23 is a widely accepted method for preparing perovskite films, and it is obvious that the morphology of PbI2 films has a great influence on the compactness of the obtained CH3NH3PbI3 films. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to preparing dense PbI2 films for further compact CH3NH3PbI3 film preparation.24,25
Furthermore, the CH3NH3PbI3 film prepared through the two-step sequential deposition method generally contains a certain amount of remnant PbI2. Part of the remnant PbI2 is the unreacted PbI2 left in the conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 due to the insufficiency of CH3NH3I solution diffusion into PbI2 films26–28 and the other forms in the sintering process due to the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3.29,30 The unreacted PbI2 usually forms a passivation layer located between the ETL and CH3NH3PbI3 layers, and the decomposed PbI2 usually fills the CH3NH3PbI3 grain boundaries; both of them exhibit passivation effects and could reduce the charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface and the perovskite/HTL interface, respectively, and therefore improve the performance of PSCs.26–31 Even for the mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite films fabricated through a single step from a solution containing a mixture of FAI, PbI2, MABr, and PbBr2, the excess PbI2 in the perovskite films also exhibited passivation effects and suppressed the charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface, and then pushed the PCE of the corresponding PSCs up to 20.8%, which is the highest PCE of PSCs in the published literature.32 However, there are also some diametrically opposed views on the passivation effect of the remnant PbI2. Some studies state that the remnant PbI2 has no passivation effect33 or it would deteriorate the stability and reproducibility of devices.34–36 These conflicting opinions are mainly caused by the different amounts, locations and forms of the remnant PbI2 in perovskite films. Therefore, finding more evidence for the passivation effect of remnant PbI2 in perovskite films and optimizing the amount, location and form of remnant PbI2 are urgent for device performance improvement.
In this investigation, a two-step spin-coating method37 was adopted to prepare CH3NH3PbI3 films on TiO2 scaffold layers. The heating temperatures of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films were tuned to improve the morphology of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films and vary the content of remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films. The effect of heating temperature on the morphology of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films, the content of remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films and the performance of PSCs was investigated. Subsequently, the charge recombination behaviour of PSCs and the passivation effect of remnant PbI2 were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), dark current and time-resolved fluorescence emission decay measurements.

CH3NH3PbI3 film deposition and solar cell fabrication

Preparation of TiO2 compact and scaffold layers. 
A TiO2 compact layer was prepared by spin-coating a mildly acidic solution of TTIP in ethanol on the FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The mildly acidic solution of TTIP was prepared using TTIP, absolute ethanol and 2 M HCl according to a reported method developed by H. J. Snaith.38 The TiO2 scaffold layer was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s onto the top of the TiO2 compact layer using the 18NR-T TiO2 paste diluted in absolute ethanol (1:3.5, weight ratio). After drying at 120 °C for 10 min, the films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min.


Deposition of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer. 
The CH3NH3PbI3 layer was prepared through a two-step spin-coating method in a glove box full of dry nitrogen. 1 M PbI2 solution was obtained by dissolving an appropriate amount of PbI2 powder into DMF under stirring at 70 °C overnight, and then the solution was kept at 70 °C during the whole procedure. 30 μL of PbI2 solution was spin-coated on the TiO2 scaffold layer successively at 3000 rpm for 18 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s. After drying at room temperature for 18 min, they were heated on a hotplate for 10 min, and the heating temperature was chosen to be 90, 100, 110, 120 and 130 °C, respectively. After cooling to room temperature, 100 μL of CH3NH3I solution (10 mg mL−1 in isopropanol) was loaded on PbI2 coated TiO2 scaffold films for 20 s to react with PbI2 and form CH3NH3PbI3, and subsequently spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 90, 100, 110, 120 and 130 °C for 10 min, respectively.


Deposition of HTL and the Ag electrode. 
The HTL was deposited onto the CH3NH3PbI3 films by spin-coating a solution of spiro-OMeTAD at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of TBP, 17.5 μL of LiTFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 29 μL of Co[PyPz]3[TFSI]3 solution (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene.23 After the deposition of an ∼80 nm thick silver electrode onto the HTL through vacuum thermal evaporation, a PSC was obtained. The active area of the devices was 9 mm2 determined using a 3 mm × 3 mm black mask.

Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Zeiss Sigma 500, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The coverage of PbI2 films was estimated from their FE-SEM images using Image J2x software (National Health Institutes, USA). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips X'pert, Holland) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 films were measured using an UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (HITACHI, U-3900H, Japan).
The photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves of PSCs were measured with a Keithley 2420 digital source meter in the backward mode under the illumination of a solar simulator (Newport Oriel 94043A, USA, AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using a 300 W Xe lamp light source with monochromatic light in the range of 300–900 nm. EIS measurements were performed on a frequency response analyzer equipped with PGSTAT-30 from Autolab, the PSCs were measured under the bias voltages of 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 V, respectively, in the dark, the frequency range was 106–1 Hz, and the magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) curves of the PSCs were measured in the dark to obtain the dark current with the same instrument used for EIS measurements, and the scan rate was 50 mV s−1. Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were obtained using a LaserStrobe spectrofluorometer (PTI, Photon Technology International, Inc., USA) equipped with a nitrogen pumped dye laser as its light source, and the excitation wavelength of 465 nm was adopted in the measurements.
Results and discussion
Morphology and coverage of PbI2 thin films
In Fig. 1, the five left FE-SEM images display the surface morphologies of the PbI2 thin films deposited on TiO2 scaffold layers and heated at 90, 100, 110, 120 and 130 °C for 10 min, respectively. Fig. 1 shows that TiO2 scaffold layers are covered with porous PbI2 films, and the porous PbI2 films are composed of PbI2 nano-flakes connected to each other. The dark regions in FE-SEM images could be identified as nanopores of PbI2 films where the TiO2 scaffold layer is uncovered. These five FE-SEM images also show that the size and density of nanopores of PbI2 films both obviously decrease with the heating temperature increasing. After filling the nanopores with blue colour (the right five images of Fig. 1), the variation trend of the size and density of the nanopores with the heating temperature becomes more intuitive. It is obvious that reducing the nanopore size and density could increase the coverage of PbI2 films. In order to further investigate the variation of nanopore size and density with the heating temperature of PbI2 films, Image J2x software was used to analyze the FE-SEM images. For reducing the analytical error, three different magnification levels (5000×, 10000×, and 20000×) of FE-SEM images were used for analysis and the same threshold value was adopted in the binarization process. After binarization (the binarized images with different magnifications are shown in Fig. S1–S3†), the average size and density of nanopores could be obtained using Image J2x software and the coverage of PbI2 films could be estimated; the obtained data and the corresponding curves are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2, where the size of nanopores is represented by their average area. On the whole, the size and density of nanopores of PbI2 films decrease obviously with the heating temperature increasing, and as a result, the coverage of PbI2 films increases inevitably. Fig. 2B and Table 1 show that the coverage of PbI2 films continuously increases with the heating temperature increasing. When the heating temperature increases to 130 °C, the coverage of PbI2 films increases from 93.80 ± 0.25% (at 90 °C) to 97.13 ± 0.08%. Furthermore, it is reasonable to expect that higher coverage PbI2 films would lead to higher coverage CH3NH3PbI3 films and more unreacted PbI2 residues after reacting with CH3NH3I. Then, the charge recombination would be reduced and therefore the device performance would be improved.

Morphology and light absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 films

Fig. 3 displays the FE-SEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at different temperatures, where the preparation temperature has been written as m/n °C, where m and n are the heating temperatures of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films, respectively. When the heating temperatures of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films are equal and the temperature ranges from 90/90 to 110/110 °C (Fig. 3A–C), it could be easily found that the size of CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles is non-uniform and the average nanoparticle size slightly increases with the temperature increasing. Meanwhile, it is also obvious that the amount of nanopores decreases and the coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 films increases with the temperature increasing. When the temperature reaches 120/120 °C (Fig. 3D), the uniformity of CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles has been improved obviously, and the average size of CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles and the coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 films both further increase. When the temperature further increases to 130/130 °C (Fig. 3E), the most notable feature is the obvious increase of the size and amount of the nanopores with the continuous increase of the CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticle size, which leads to the obvious decrease of the coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 films. This phenomenon indicates that higher temperature leads to larger CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles and higher coverage CH3NH3PbI3 films, and the coverage reaches the maximum value at 120/120 °C. The decrease of the coverage at 130/130 °C could be attributed to the partial decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 according to previous investigations,39,40 and which has been proven by the XRD measurements. In order to further improve the morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 films, some CH3NH3PbI3 films were prepared at 130/120 °C (Fig. 3F); their compactness has been further improved compared with the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at 120/120 °C.
 Fig. 3  The FE-SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at (A) 90/90 °C, (B) 100/100 °C, (C) 110/110 °C, (D) 120/120 °C, (E) 130/130 °C and (F) 130/120 °C. 
The XRD patterns of a FTO substrate, a TiO2 scaffold layer, a representative PbI2 film heated at 100 °C, and the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4A. The XRD pattern of the PbI2 film indicates that the PbI2 film is a pure PbI2 film with a hexagonal structure (JCPDS No. 73-1752) and good crystallinity. After reacting with CH3NH3I, the diffraction peaks of the obtained films agree well with the literature data on the tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3.2 However, the obtained films are not pure CH3NH3PbI3 films; the (003) peak of hexagonal PbI2 could be observed in the XRD pattern of each CH3NH3PbI3 film. The relative intensity of the (003) peak of PbI2, defined as the intensity ratio of the (003) peak of PbI2 to the (110) peak of CH3NH3PbI3 (at 14.0°, the strongest peak of CH3NH3PbI3), has been used to analyze the mechanism behind the presence of PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films. Fig. 4B shows the variation of the relative intensity of the (003) peak of PbI2 with the preparation temperature. The relative intensity of the (003) peak of PbI2 slightly increases from 7.25% to 10.07% with the temperature increasing from 100/100 to 120/120 °C, which could be attributed to the insufficient reaction of PbI2 with CH3NH3I. The reaction of PbI2 with CH3NH3I has occurred at room temperature, and the dense CH3NH3PbI3 film on the surface of the PbI2 film formed in the initial stage of the reaction may prevent the contact of PbI2 with CH3NH3I and then affect the sufficiency of the reaction.41 When the temperature increases to 130/120 °C the relative intensity of the (003) peak of PbI2 further increases to 14.38%. When the temperature further increases to 130/130 °C, the relative intensity of the (003) peak of PbI2 sharply increases to 23.98%. The gradually increased relative intensity of the (003) peak of PbI2 indicates that the content of PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films increases with the temperature increasing, and the high relative intensity of 23.98% demonstrates that partial decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 has occurred at 130/130 °C according to the expression (1).40 CH3NH3PbI3 → PbI2 + CH3NH2 + HI(1)

(B) The variation of the relative intensity of the (003) peak of PbI2 with the preparation temperature. The relative intensity has been defined as the intensity ratio of the (003) peak of PbI2 to the (110) peak of CH3NH3PbI3. 
As a result of the partial decomposition, the coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 film decreases (Fig. 3E), and furthermore a decrease of light absorption would be inevitable. Additionally, the decomposed PbI2 formed in the partial decomposition process of CH3NH3PbI3 at 130/130 °C would fill the grain boundaries of CH3NH3PbI3 and then retard the charge recombination.

Fig. 5 displays the UV-Vis-NIR absorbance spectra of the samples. The absorbance values of CH3NH3PbI3 films increase over the whole spectral range with the temperature increasing from 90/90 to 120/120 °C, and the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at 130/120 °C exhibit the strongest light absorption. When the temperature further increases to 130/130 °C the light absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 films decreases obviously, which could be ascribed to the partial decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3. The light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) has a positive correlation with the light absorption of the films, and therefore, stronger light absorption would lead to higher LHE, and higher LHE would lead to higher short-circuit current density (Jsc). Therefore, the maximum Jsc would be obtained by the PSCs prepared at 130/120 °C.

Cell performance
The J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of PSCs based on CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2, respectively. Consistent with the expectation from UV-Vis-NIR absorbance spectra, Jsc increases as the temperature increases from 90/90 to 130/120 °C, and further increasing the temperature to 130/130 °C decreases the Jsc of PSCs. The maximum Jsc of 20.66 ± 0.43 mA cm−2 is achieved by the PSCs prepared at 130/120 °C, and the corresponding open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are 960 ± 7 mV, 70.4 ± 0.5%, and 14.32 ± 0.28%, respectively, which is the best performance of PSCs. The IPCE spectra of three representative PSCs prepared at 90/90, 120/120 and 130/120 °C, respectively, are shown in Fig. 7. The IPCE values of the PSCs prepared at 120/120 °C are much higher than those of the PSCs prepared at 90/90 °C over the whole spectral range (300–800 nm), and the IPCE curve of the PSCs prepared at 130/120 °C is the highest one of the three PSCs, which means that the LHE of the CH3NH3PbI3 films has been improved by increasing the preparation temperature from 90/90 to 120/120 °C, and the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at 130/120 °C exhibit the highest LHE in the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at different temperatures. Additionally, the integrated photocurrent densities of the PSCs prepared at 90/90, 120/120 and 130/120 °C are 12.19, 18.52 and 20.02 mA cm−2, respectively, and they are consistent with the J–V results.

For PSCs prepared at 90/90, 100/100, 110/110, 120/120 and 130/130 °C, the variation of Voc with temperature is approximately consistent with that of Jsc; Voc increases with the temperature increasing and reaches the maximum value of 954 ± 8 mV at 120/120 °C. The variation of FF with the preparation temperature is different from that of Jsc; FF increases with the temperature increasing from 90/90 to 130/130 °C, which means that FF does not decrease with the partial decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3, which is different from Jsc. The increase of FF is a positive factor in the cell performance, and the decrease of PCE at 130/130 °C is mainly attributed to the decrease of Jsc caused by the partial decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3.
Passivation effect of the remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films
The dark current curves obtained through LSV measurements in the dark are displayed in Fig. 8, which shows that the onset of the dark current gradually increases with the temperature increasing from 90/90 to 130/130 °C. This phenomenon demonstrates that increasing the preparation temperature could suppress the charge recombination in PSCs effectively and the suppression effect becomes increasingly significant with the temperature increasing. As a result, the FF of PSCs has gradually increased with the temperature increasing and subsequently the PCE has also been improved except for the PSCs prepared at 130/130 °C.

EIS measurements exhibit the same results as the LSV measurements. The representative Nyquist plots of PSCs prepared at 90/90, 100/100, 110/110, 120/120 and 130/130 °C obtained under the bias voltage of 0.8 V are shown in Fig. 9A. The obtained measurement data were fitted using Z-View software and a simplified equivalent circuit (the inset of Fig. 9A). Generally, a Nyquist plot consists of two semi-arcs in the range of 106–1 Hz, the higher frequency arc is related to the diffusion resistance of holes through HTL, RHTL, in parallel with HTL capacitance, CPEHTL, and the lower frequency arc is related to the charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface and the perovskite/HTL interface, Rrec, in parallel with a chemical capacitance CPErec.42,43 However, only the semi-arc related to the charge recombination in every Nyquist plot could be observed in our measurements, and it is a recurring phenomenon according to the previous literature.44,45

Fig. 9A shows that the diameter of the semi-arc increases with the preparation temperature increasing from 90/90 to 130/130 °C, and significantly increases with the preparation temperature increasing from 120/120 to 130/130 °C, which indicates that increasing preparation temperature could increase the Rrec of PSCs, especially when the temperature increases from 120/120 to 130/130 °C. Additionally, the variations of Rrec with the preparation temperature obtained under the bias voltages of 0.7, 0.9 and 1.0 V shown in Fig. 9B are consistent with that of Rrec measured under 0.8 V (Fig. 9A). The enhanced Rrec suggests that the charge recombination in PSCs has been successfully suppressed by increasing the preparation temperature of PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films.
What leads to the growing suppression of charge recombination with the preparation temperature increasing? Higher preparation temperature results in higher coverage PbI2 films (Fig. 1) and higher coverage CH3NH3PbI3 films (except for the CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at 130/130 °C, Fig. 3). High coverage CH3NH3PbI3 films could suppress charge recombination by reducing the detrimental direct contact between ETL and HTL. Meanwhile, higher coverage PbI2 films would lead to more unreacted PbI2 left (Fig. 4) and located in the interface of ETL and CH3NH3PbI3 layers; the contribution of the passivation effect of unreacted PbI2 on suppressing charge recombination could not be excluded. When the temperature increases to 130/130 °C, the coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer decreases obviously (Fig. 3E), but the suppression of charge recombination of PSCs is further enhanced (Fig. 8 and 9). What promotes the further suppression of charge recombination with the coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer decreasing? It must definitely be the passivation effect of remnant PbI2, particularly the decomposed PbI2 formed in the partial decomposition process of CH3NH3PbI3 sintered at 130 °C which could fill the grain boundaries of CH3NH3PbI3 and then suppress the charge recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface.
To further investigate the charge recombination behaviour and passivation effect of remnant PbI2 in the PSCs, time-resolved fluorescence emission decay measurements were performed on the samples of FTO/ETL/CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared at different temperatures, and the emission lifetime could be obtained by fitting the fluorescence emission decay spectra using the exponential function. The FTO/ETL/CH3NH3PbI3 films without HTL layers could avoid the charge recombination at the CH3NH3PbI3/HTL interface, and the corresponding fluorescence emission lifetime would reflect the charge recombination behaviour at the ETL/CH3NH3PbI3 interface and the CH3NH3PbI3 grain boundaries; longer emission lifetime would indicate the enhanced suppression of the charge recombination. Fig. 10 shows the time-resolved fluorescence emission decay spectra and Table 3 displays the corresponding lifetime of the samples. The lifetime gradually increases from 0.98 ns at 90/90 °C to 1.25 ns at 120/120 °C, and further to 1.44 ns at 130/120 °C. Considering that the content of unreacted PbI2 in the CH3NH3PbI3 films gradually increases with the temperature increasing from 90/90 °C to 120/120 °C and further to 130/120 °C (XRD results, Fig. 4), the increase of the emission lifetime could be ascribed to the increasing passivation effect of the unreacted PbI2 located between the ETL and CH3NH3PbI3 layers which suppresses the charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface. This result is evidence for the passivation effect of the unreacted PbI2 located between the ETL and CH3NH3PbI3 layers, and which improves the performance of PSCs obviously (Table 2 and Fig. 6). Furthermore, when the temperature increases to 130/130 °C, partial decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 has occurred, the emission lifetime sharply increases to 3.39 ns, which could be attributed to the decomposed PbI2 filling the CH3NH3PbI3 grain boundaries and further suppressing the charge recombination. This is powerful evidence for the passivation effect of the decomposed PbI2 in the CH3NH3PbI3 films. Although the PCE of PSCs prepared at 130/130 °C is lower than that of PSCs prepared at 120/120 °C and 130/120 °C owing to the partial decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3, the charge recombination has been suppressed effectively, and optimizing the amount and location of the decomposed PbI2 would inevitably improve the device performance of PSCs.

So far, the passivation effects of the unreacted and decomposed PbI2 have been confirmed unquestionably, and the passivation effect of the unreacted PbI2 has been proven to improve the performance of PSCs. In the future, more effort should be devoted to optimizing the amount, location and form of the remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films to further improve the device performance of PSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, the CH3NH3PbI3 films were obtained by a two-step spin-coating method and the content of the remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films was tuned by varying the preparation temperature. Increasing the heating temperature could increase the coverage of spin-coated PbI2 films, which resulted in high coverage CH3NH3PbI3 films and more remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films. As a result, the performance of PSCs was enhanced obviously, and a relatively high PCE of 14.32 ± 0.28% was achieved by the PSCs prepared at 130/120 °C. Furthermore, the charge recombination in PSCs was effectively suppressed with the content of remnant PbI2 increasing, and the passivation effects of the unreacted and decomposed PbI2 in improving the performance of PSCs have been confirmed unquestionably. In the future, further optimizing the content, location and form of the remnant PbI2 in CH3NH3PbI3 films is a feasible approach for the improvement of the device performance of PSCs.
