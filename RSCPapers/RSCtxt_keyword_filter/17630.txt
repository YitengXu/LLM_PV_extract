    , Accepted 12th June 2015First published on 12th June 2015AbstractFive copolymers, having 4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene as a donor unit, and perylene diimide (PDI) and/or naphthalene diimide (NDI) as acceptor moieties, were synthesized by Stille coupling copolymerization, and used as electron acceptors in solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs). All five copolymers exhibited broad absorption in the region of 300–800 nm. The LUMO energy level of the resulting copolymers was from −3.90 to −3.77 eV and the HOMO energy level had little variation from −5.65 to −5.57 eV. Among binary blend PSCs using P3HT as a donor and these polymers as acceptors, PPDI25-co-NDI75-based devices (P3HT:PPDI25-co-NDI75 = 3:1, w/w) yielded the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 1.54%. Among ternary blend PSCs using P3HT as a donor and PDI polymer PPDI100 and NDI polymer PNDI100 as coacceptors, the P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 (3:0.25:0.75, w/w) ternary blend afforded the best PCE of 0.83%. All ternary blends based on P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 showed decreased VOC, JSC, FF and PCE compared to the corresponding binary blends based on P3HT:PPDI-co-NDI.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on solution processed bulk heterojunctions (BHJ) have been studied intensively in recent years because of their advantages, such as light weight, low cost, facile fabrication, and flexibility.1–7 Over the past few decades, researchers have devoted great effort to increase power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), and recently, PCEs of PSCs based on low-bandgap polymers and fullerene derivatives have exceeded 10%.8–10 To achieve a high performance of PSCs, both molecule and device engineering approaches were used. Ternary random copolymers were employed as donors in PSCs because they possess some advantages, such as broad absorption and efficient photon harvesting. However, examples of high-performance random copolymers are limited,11–19 and PSCs based on random copolymer acceptors have rarely been reported. Meanwhile, ternary blend active layers, such as two donors/one acceptor,20–25 one donor/two acceptors,26,27 one donor/one acceptor/one additive,28 were used to enhance the PCEs.
Rylene diimides, such as perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI), were used as promising acceptors in fullerene-free PSCs since they had good light-harvesting properties, thermal and chemical stability, high electron mobility, and strong electron-accepting ability.29–44 The PDI cores tended to aggregate and form large crystal domains in blended films because they had good planarity and strong intermolecular interaction. To solve this problem, PDI dimers, star-shaped trimers and tetramers with multidimensional geometry were synthesized.45–52 Recently, random copolymer acceptors based on both PDI and NDI moieties with carbazole or selenophene as a donating component have been reported.53,54 The absorption, HOMO and LUMO energy levels, charge transport, film morphology, and photovoltaic properties of the random copolymer acceptors can be adjusted through incorporating the second acceptor moiety.
Indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (IDT)-based organic semiconductors are promising electron donors for PSCs owing to their excellent light-absorbing and hole-transport properties.55–58 Recently, we reported IDT-based small molecule acceptors, which exhibited very promising performance when used in PSCs.59–62
Here, we used 4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as a donor unit, and PDI and/or NDI as acceptor groups to construct copolymer acceptors for PSCs (Scheme 1). The tetrahexylphenyl groups on the coplanar backbone can ensure solution processability and reduce intermolecular interactions and suppress self-aggregation. The effects of the PDI/NDI ratio on absorption, energy level, charge transport, morphology and PSC performance were investigated. In particular, we compared these ternary random copolymers with the blend system employing their parent copolymers (PPDI100 and PNDI100) as co-acceptors. We found that chemical copolymerization of PDI and NDI afforded better performance than their physical blend counterpart when used in all-polymer solar cells.

Characterization
The 1H spectra were measured using a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer employing tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. Elemental analysis was carried out using a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed using a Waters 515 chromatograph connected to a Waters 2414 refractive index detector, using THF as an eluent and polystyrene standards as calibrants. Three Waters Styragel columns (HT2, 3, 4) connected in series were used. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed using a Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (Model DTG-60) under flowing nitrogen gas at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed using a METTLER differential scanning calorimeter (DSC822e) under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of thin films was performed in the reflection mode at 40 kV and 200 mA with Cu-Kα radiation using a 2 kW Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer or PANalytical B.V. Empyrean X-ray diffractometer. Solution (chloroform) and thin film (on a quartz substrate) UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out under nitrogen in a deoxygenated solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in acetonitrile using a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1 employing a computer-controlled Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation, a glassy-carbon working electrode coated with the copolymer films, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode. The potentials were referenced to a ferrocenium/ferrocene (FeCp2+/0) couple using ferrocene as an external standard. Photoluminescence spectra were measured for P3HT neat film, P3HT:PPDI-co-NDI binary blended films and P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 ternary blended films (spin-coated on a quartz substrate) by using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The nanoscale morphology of the blended films was observed using a Veeco Nanoscope V atomic force microscope (AFM) in the tapping mode. Contact angles were measured on an OCA20 instrument (DataPhysics, Germany) at 25 °C. Deionized water droplets (about 2 μL) were dropped carefully onto the surface.
Fabrication and characterization of the photovoltaic cells
Organic solar cells were fabricated with the structure, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Ca/Al. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 15 Ω □−1) was precleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 23 min. A thin layer (35 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron PVP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass, and then baked at 150 °C for 15 min. A donor:acceptor mixture in o-dichlorobenzene was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer. The calcium layer (ca. 20 nm) and the aluminum layer (ca. 80 nm) were then evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured using a computer-controlled B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit (Agilent Technologies). An XES-70S1 (SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size) coupled with AM 1.5 G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI Standards Inc. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using a solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell. Hole-only or electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au for holes and Al/active layer/Al for electrons. The mobility was extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current).
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Five copolymers were synthesized via Still coupling reactions between dibromo-substituted PDI and/or NDI and indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene ditin in one pot (Scheme 1). All the compounds are readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and chloroform at room temperature. The molecular weights and their dispersity, summarized in Table 1, were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as an eluent and polystyrene standards as calibrants. The molecular weights of PPDI-co-NDI were different because the IDT and PDI units have steric hindrance, which is unfavorable for polymerization. When the PDI ratio goes down from 100 to 25%, the molecular weight of PPDI-co-NDI goes up. The thermal properties of these five polymers were investigated using TGA methods under a nitrogen atmosphere and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. All copolymers possessed thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) exceeding 250 °C (Fig. S1, ESI†). According to the DSC traces, all PPDI-co-NDI polymers show no glass transition and no melting peak, indicating that they are amorphous (Fig. S2, ESI†). This result is also supported by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PPDI-co-NDI polymers, which do not show obvious diffraction peaks (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Absorption

Fig. 1 shows the normalized optical absorption spectra of five copolymers in solution and as a thin film. In a chloroform solution, all five copolymers exhibited broad absorption in the region of 300–800 nm (Table 2). The three absorption bands at ca. 400, 520 and 720 nm were from IDT, PDI and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor IDT and acceptor PDI/NDI, respectively. With a decreasing PDI/NDI ratio in the main chain, the band intensity at ca. 400 nm remained unchanged, while the band intensity at ca. 520 nm decreased and the band intensity at ca. 720 nm increased. The decrease in the band intensity at ca. 520 nm was ascribed to the decrease in the PDI content, while the increase in the band intensity at ca. 720 nm was attributed to enhanced ICT in the more planar backbone caused by increased NDI component. Thin films of the copolymers showed broader and red-shifted absorption relative to their corresponding solutions due to the aggregation of the copolymers in the solid state. The five copolymers showed narrow optical bandgaps of 1.46–1.52 eV, estimated from their absorption edges in thin films (Table 2).

Electrochemistry
The electrochemical properties of the copolymers were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the films on a glassy-carbon working electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 using a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the copolymers exhibited one or two reversible or quasi-reversible reduction waves and one or two reversible or quasi-reversible oxidation waves. The HOMO and LUMO levels of these compounds were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum (Table 2). The HOMO (−5.65 to −5.57 eV) energy levels of these molecules were similar, while the LUMO energy levels up-shifted to some extent when increasing the NDI ratio in the backbone (Fig. 2b). When increasing the NDI ratio from 0 to 75%, the LUMO energy level up-shifted from −3.90 to −3.77 eV, which was favorable for PSCs to achieve higher open-circuit voltage (VOC).63

Photovoltaic properties
We fabricated BHJ PSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Ca/Al using P3HT as a donor to blend with the polymer acceptors. The photoluminescence spectra of the P3HT neat film, P3HT:PPDI-co-NDI binary blended films and P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 ternary blended films are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The P3HT neat film exhibited strong fluorescence in the wavelength region of 600–850 nm, while P3HT:PPDI-co-NDI binary blended films and P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 ternary blended films showed over 90% of fluorescence quenching compared to P3HT. Strong fluorescence quenching indicated effective photo-induced charge transfer between the P3HT donor and PPDI-co-NDI acceptors or PPDI100:PNDI100 coacceptors.
The performance data of PSCs with different P3HT:polymer acceptor weight ratios are summarized in Tables S1–S5 in the ESI.† The optimized donor/acceptor weight ratios ranged from 2:1 to 3:1. O-Dichlorobenzene was used as the processing solvent since it afforded the best quality of blended films. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best PSCs fabricated with the optimized D/A ratio are shown in Fig. 3a. Table 3 summarizes VOC, short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the optimized devices.

As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3b, when increasing the NDI feed ratio from 0 to 100% in the polymer backbone, the VOC of the device increased from 0.621 V to 0.706 V, which made a major contribution to the improvement of PCE. The increase in VOC was generally consistent with the up-shifting trend of the LUMO level of the acceptors with an increasing NDI ratio. The device based on PPDI100 showed the highest FF (65.4%), while the PNDI100-based device gave the lowest FF (55.3%), and the PDI-NDI copolymer-based devices showed moderate FF (60.3–62.4%) (Fig. 3c). The VOC of ternary random copolymers has a linear trend with the monomer feed ratio, because the VOC is mainly determined by the difference of the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor, and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels could be tuned by varying the monomer feed ratio. However, there is no report that the JSC, FF and PCE show a linear trend with the monomer feed ratio,14 since the JSC, FF and PCE are affected by many factors, such as the molecular structure, charge transport and the morphology of the blended film. Among devices based on these five acceptors, the device based on PPDI25-co-NDI75 exhibited a relatively high VOC of 0.682 V, the highest JSC of 3.62 mA cm−2, a relatively high FF of 62.4%, and the best PCE of 1.54%.
We compared the PDI-NDI copolymers with blends of PDI and NDI parent polymers used in all-polymer solar cells at different PDI/NDI ratios (Table S6, ESI†). All ternary blends based on P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 showed decreased VOC, JSC, FF and PCE than corresponding binary blends based on P3HT:PPDI-co-NDI (Fig. S5–S8, ESI†). For instance, compared with a P3HT:PPDI25-co-NDI75 (3:1, w/w) binary blend, a P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 (3:0.25:0.75, w/w) ternary blend exhibited a VOC of 0.656 V, a JSC of 2.47 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50.9%, leading to a lower PCE of 0.83%. Resembling the VOC trend observed in the binary blend, VOC increased from 0.608 to 0.656 V as the amount of PNDI100 increased from 25% to 75% in the ternary blend system (Fig. S6, ESI†), which was similar to the other reported ternary blend PSCs.64,65
The IPCE spectra of blended films are shown in Fig. 4a. The PSCs based on binary and ternary blended films exhibited a broad photoresponse extending from 300 to 800 nm. The IPCE spectra ranging from 500–600 nm were mainly attributed to the absorption of P3HT,66 while the IPCE spectra ranging from 650–800 nm were mainly attributed to the absorption of the polymer acceptors, which increased with increasing the NDI feed ratio from 0 to 100%, resembling the trend of the CT band intensity in the absorption of the polymer acceptors (Fig. 1). Compared with the P3HT:PPDI-co-NDI binary blend, the ternary blended film of P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 showed a smaller IPCE value, which accounted for the lower JSC. The trend of the calculated JSC from IPCE measurement was similar to that of JSC measured from I–V vs. NDI feed ratio (Fig. 4b), and the highest JSC was achieved for PPDI25-co-NDI75.

Hole and electron mobilities
The hole and electron mobilities of the blended films were measured using the SCLC67 method to understand the influence of the charge transport properties on photovoltaic performance. The binary blends exhibited hole mobilities of 2.0–5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobilities of 1.4–4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 4, Fig. S9 in the ESI†). The P3HT:PPDI100 blend showed the best balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 9.1), while the P3HT:PNDI100 blend showed the poorest balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 25.0), which are responsible for the highest and lowest FF, respectively. Compared with its binary blend counterpart P3HT:PPDI25-co-NDI75, the ternary blend P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 showed lower hole mobility and much lower electron mobility with poor balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 52.2), which were responsible for lower FF.

Film morphology
Tapping-mode AFM height and phase images of the binary and ternary blended films are shown in Fig. 5. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the binary blends was increased from 3.64 nm (PPDI100) to 6.93 nm (PPDI75-co-NDI25), 7.01 nm (PPDI50-co-NDI50), 7.46 nm (PPDI25-co-NDI75), and 9.57 nm (PNDI100) when increasing the NDI feed ratio in the polymer backbone. The P3HT:PPDI100 binary blend showed the minimum RMS value, smaller aggregation domains and good donor/acceptor intermixing because of the nonplanarity of the polymer backbone caused by the IDT and PDI bulky units, leading to the highest FF. In contrast, the P3HT:PNDI100 binary blend exhibited the maximum RMS value and larger aggregation domains due to the good coplanarity of the polymer backbone caused by the smaller NDI unit, leading to the lowest FF. The P3HT:PPDI25-co-NDI75 binary blend showed a moderate RMS value and moderate aggregation domains, leading to a relatively high FF and the highest JSC. Contact angles of PPDI-co-NDI neat films are shown in Fig. S10 in the ESI,† the contact angles of five PPDI-co-NDI polymers were similar, demonstrating that the five copolymers had a similar surface energy.

The ternary blend P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 (Fig. 5, a6, b6) exhibited a similar RMS value (7.58 nm) to the P3HT:PPDI25-co-NDI75 binary blend (Fig. 5, a4, b4), but the ternary blend showed larger scale phase separation, which had a negative impact on the exciton dissociation and charge transport, then led to decreased JSC, FF and PCE.
Conclusions
Five copolymer acceptor materials based on the IDT donor unit and PDI and/or NDI acceptor units have been developed for use in solution-processed PSCs. These five copolymers exhibited good solubility and broad absorption. Increase in the NDI ratio in the polymer backbone up-shifted the LUMO energy level from −3.90 to −3.77 eV and increased the VOC from 0.621 to 0.706 V of the PSCs. Increase in the NDI ratio in the polymer backbone also enhanced the ICT absorption band at ca. 720 nm and the IPCE value at 650–800 nm. The P3HT:PPDI100 blend showed the smallest RMS and the best balanced charge transport, while the P3HT:PNDI100 blend showed the largest RMS and the worst balanced charge transport, which were responsible for the highest and lowest FF, respectively. Among these copolymers, PSCs based on the P3HT:PPDI25-co-NDI75 binary blend yielded a relatively high VOC of 0.682 V, the highest JSC of 3.62 mA cm−2, a relatively high FF of 62.4%, and the best PCE of 1.54%, due to moderate aggregation domains and balanced charge transport. All ternary blends based on P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 showed decreased VOC, JSC, FF and PCE than the corresponding binary blends based on P3HT:PPDI-co-NDI. PSCs based on the P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 (3:0.25:0.75, w/w) ternary blend achieved the highest PCE of 0.83% among all the ternary blends. Compared with its binary blend counterpart P3HT:PPDI25-co-NDI75, the ternary blend P3HT:PPDI100:PNDI100 showed ambiguous phase separation, lower hole mobility and much lower electron mobility with poor balanced charge transport, which led to decreased JSC, FF and PCE.
