    , Accepted 16th August 2016First published on 17th August 2016AbstractBoth tin oxide (SnO2) and fullerenes have been reported as electron selective layers (ESLs) for producing efficient lead halide perovskite solar cells. Here, we report that SnO2 and fullerenes can work cooperatively to further boost the performance of perovskite solar cells. We find that fullerenes can be redissolved during perovskite deposition, allowing ultra-thin fullerenes to be retained at the interface and some dissolved fullerenes infiltrate into perovskite grain boundaries. The SnO2 layer blocks holes effectively; whereas, the fullerenes promote electron transfer and passivate both the SnO2/perovskite interface and perovskite grain boundaries. With careful device optimization, the best-performing planar perovskite solar cell using a fullerene passivated SnO2 ESL has achieved a steady-state efficiency of 17.75% and a power conversion efficiency of 19.12% with an open circuit voltage of 1.12 V, a short-circuit current density of 22.61 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 75.8% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. We find that the partial dissolving of fullerenes during perovskite deposition is the key for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells based on metal oxide/fullerene ESLs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have attracted significant attention recently due to their excellent photovoltaic properties, such as an extremely high optical absorption coefficient, very long carrier lifetime and tunable band gap.1–9 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 22.1%.10–21 High efficiency perovskite solar cells exclusively use electron selective layers (ESLs), which transport electrons but block holes, and hole selective layers (HSLs), which transfer holes but block electrons.22–24 To perform adequately in this manner, ESLs and HSLs should not be heavily doped. Therefore ESLs and HSLs must be thin and compact to avoid high series resistance and shunting. High quality ESLs and HSLs are essential for obtaining photovoltaic devices with high short-circuit current densities (Jsc), open-circuit voltages (Voc), and fill factors (FFs).22,23 For perovskite solar cells with a regular structure, metal oxides, such as TiO2 and ZnO, have been reported as excellent ESL materials.16,19,25–28 Recently, SnO2 has been reported as an alternative ESL material for high efficiency perovskite solar cells.29–36 It has been shown that low-temperature compact SnO2 films exhibit good antireflection behavior, good band edge alignment with perovskite absorbers, and high electron mobility.29,31 Despite the aforementioned advantages, metal oxide ESL/perovskite interfaces have not yet reached their full potential. It has been demonstrated that enhancing the charge transfer and reducing the interface recombination can effectively improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.37–39 Fullerenes, such as C60 and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), are excellent acceptors in organic solar cells.40,41 They have also been reported as good ESL materials for perovskite solar cells.42–48 It has been shown that fullerenes effectively promote charge transfer and passivation of perovskites.49–51 However, fullerene ESLs cannot block holes as efficiently as metal oxide ESLs due to their relatively smaller band gaps. It is therefore prudent to combine metal oxide ESLs with fullerenes to harness the benefits of each while avoiding their shortfalls. If they are able to work cooperatively, i.e., the metal oxide layer effectively blocks holes and the fullerenes promote electron transfer and passivation of the perovskite layer, the metal oxide/fullerene ESLs may further boost the performance of perovskite solar cells. Some groups have tried metal oxide/fullerene combinations and moderate improvements on cell performance have been achieved.52–58 However, so far, the role of fullerenes has not been clarified clearly.
In this paper, we show that the fullerenes can be redissolved by DMF and DMSO during spin-coating of the perovskite precursor, which allows only ultra-thin fullerenes to be retained at the interface and some dissolved fullerenes infiltrate into perovskite grain boundaries. Therefore, the ultra-thin fullerenes effectively passivate both the ESL/perovskite interface and perovskite grain boundaries. The use of ultra-thin PCBM does not adversely affect the Jsc of perovskite solar cells, which is critical for realizing high PCEs. The roles of fullerenes are confirmed by photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, revealing that the cells using SnO2/PCBM ESLs exhibit enhanced electron transfer and reduced interface recombination than the cells using SnO2-only ESLs. Furthermore, the conductive atomic-force microscopy (c-AFM) results also show that PCBM passivates the perovskite grain boundaries and reduce the dark current. We show that SnO2 and ultra-thin fullerene films can work cooperatively to significantly boost the performance of perovskite solar cells as compared to the cells solely using SnO2 ESLs. With careful optimization of the PCBM passivated SnO2 (name SnO2/PCBM hereafter) ESLs and perovskite layers, our best-performing perovskite solar cell achieved a steady-state efficiency of 17.75% and a PCE of 19.12% with a high Jsc of 22.61 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.12 V, and FF of 75.83% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. The average PCE of the 30 cells using SnO2/PCBM ESLs is 17.88 ± 0.48%, whereas, the average PCE of the 30 separate cells using SnO2-only ESLs is 16.50 ± 0.40%. Our results confirm that the combined SnO2/ultra-thin PCBM ESL is an excellent candidate for fabricating high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.
2. Experimental section
Device fabrication
SnO2 ESLs were prepared by a low-temperature solution process described in our previous work.29 0.1 mol L−1 SnCl2 (Alfa, anhydrous 99.9985%) was dissolved in ethanol and spin-coated on clean fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrates in atmosphere (TEC 15, Hartford Glass Co) at a spin rate of 500 rpm for 1 s and then at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The films were subsequently annealed on a hot plate in atmosphere by a three-step annealing process: 100 °C for 1 h, 150 °C for 1 h and finally 185 °C for 1 h. The thickness of the SnO2 ESL is roughly 40 nm. SnO2/PCBM ESLs were prepared by spin-coating PCBM dichlorobenzene solutions on SnO2 films at a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min in a glove box. The thickness of the PCBM films was controlled by adjusting the concentration of PCBM in dichlorobenzene. A 5 nm thick C60 (Luminescence Technology Co., Ltd, >99.5%) film was deposited on a SnO2 film by thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.02 nm s−1.44 Compact perovskite absorber layers were deposited on the ESLs by using a solvent engineering method reported in the literature.59 The perovskite films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution consisting of 461 mg PbI2 and 159 mg CH3NH3I dissolved in 723 μL N,N-dimethylformamide and 81 μL dimethyl sulfoxide. The molar ratio between PbI2 and CH3NH3I is 1:1. The perovskite films were annealed at 60 °C for 2 min and then at 100 °C for 5 min in a glovebox. The solution of HSLs consisted of 72.3 mg 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) (Shenzhen Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd., 99.0%), 17.5 μL Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) (Sigma, 99.95%) (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (Sigma, 96%), and 28.9 μL FK 102 Co(III) TFSI Salt (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) (Dyesol) in 1 mL chlorobenzene (Sigma, 99.8%). The solution of HSLs was stirred for 12 h and then coated on the perovskite films at 500 rpm for 1 s and finally at 2000 rpm for 60 s in a dry box. To complete the devices, 60 nm thick Au electrodes were thermally evaporated on top of the HSLs. The active area of the cells was 0.08 cm2.
Film and device characterization
The morphology of the devices and the perovskite films was characterized by high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-4800). Atomic-force microscopy (AFM) and conductive atomic-force microscopy c-AFM were performed on a Veeco D5000 AFM in a glovebox equipped with a Nanoscope V controller. A nanosensor PPP-EFM tip was used in the contact mode for the measurement. The crystallinity of perovskite films was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Ultima III) with a Cu Kα radiation source under the operating conditions of 40 kV and 44 mA. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance and transmission spectra were measured by using an UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 1050). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were taken on a QE system (PV Measurements Inc.). Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by using a Keithley Model 2400 under AM1.5G simulated irradiation with a standard solar simulator (PV Measurements Inc.) and a voltage settling time of 10 ms. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated by using a standard silicon solar cell. EIS measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (Voltalab PGZ-301) at a bias voltage of 0 V in the dark.
3. Results and discussion
The solar cells fabricated in this study have a regular cell structure using either SnO2 or SnO2/PCBM ESLs, as shown in Fig. S1a.† The PCBM is deposited between the perovskite film and the SnO2 film. The HSL material is spiro-OMeTAD. The charge separation process of the photo-generated carriers is shown in Fig. S1b.† The ESL and HSL have band edges matching well with that of the perovskite absorber, suitable for carrier separation and transportation. The processes of depositing the perovskite layers, spiro-OMeTAD HSLs, and back electrodes were identical for cells fabricated with different ESLs. Fig. 1a shows the J–V curves of two representative planar perovskite solar cells using SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs. The solar cell using an unpassivated SnO2 ESL achieved a PCE of 16.53% with a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 21.13 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.49% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. The solar cell using a SnO2/PCBM ESL achieved a PCE of 18.17% with a Voc of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 21.41 mA cm−2, and an FF of 76.20% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. The PCBM layer was deposited by spin-coating 10 mg mL−1 PCBM in the dichlorobenzene precursor on the SnO2 film. The solar cells using the SnO2/PCBM ESLs exhibited significant improvements of all photovoltaic parameters, Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE, as compared to solar cells using solely SnO2 ESLs. The Voc increased from 1.09 V to 1.11 V, the Jsc increased from 21.13 mA cm−2 to 21.41 mA cm−2, and the FF increased from 71.49% to 76.20%, and therefore, the PCE increased from 16.53% to 18.17%. When measuring the J–V curves of these solar cells under forward scanning conditions, as shown in Fig. 1a, both types of cells exhibited hysteretic J–V behavior.60–62 The solar cell using a SnO2 ESL showed a PCE of 14.91% with a Voc of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 21.10 mA cm−2, and an FF of 67.77% when measured under forward voltage scanning. The solar cell using a SnO2/PCBM ESL showed a PCE of 16.91% with a Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 21.42 mA cm−2, and an FF of 73.01% when measured under forward voltage scanning. The photovoltaic parameters measured in different voltage scan directions are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious that the performance of the solar cell using the SnO2/PCBM ESL is much better than that of the solar cell using the SnO2 ESL. Fig. 1b shows the measured EQE spectra of the cells using SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs. The integrated current densities based on these curves are 20.34 and 20.67 mA cm−2 for the cells using the SnO2 ESL and SnO2/PCBM ESL, respectively, which are close to the Jsc's obtained from the J–V measurements. Solar cells using only PCBM as the ESL showed much lower performance. Fig. S2† shows the UV-vis absorbance spectrum, J–V curves, and EQE spectrum of the solar cell using only the PCBM ESL without SnO2. The perovskite film deposited on PCBM-coated FTO substrates has similar absorption as those deposited on SnO2/PCBM-coated substrates. However, the solar cell using only the PCBM ESL showed a PCE of 14.60% (10.57%) with a Voc of 1.03 V (0.85 V), a Jsc of 20.37 mA cm−2 (20.24 mA cm−2), and an FF of 69.44% (61.57%) when measured under reverse (forward) voltage scanning. Therefore, it is important that SnO2 works cooperatively with PCBM as an ESL to achieve higher performance.

The efficiency enhancement from the use of SnO2/PCBM ESLs is verified by the averaged efficiency of 30 separate cells using SnO2 ESLs and 30 separate cells using SnO2/PCBM ESLs. Fig. 1c displays a histogram of the PCEs of these cells measured under reverse voltage scanning. It demonstrates good reproducibility of our fabricated solar cells. The average Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for the 30 cells using SnO2/PCBM ESLs are 1.11 ± 0.01 V, 21.21 ± 0.64 mA cm−2, 76.19 ± 1.17%, and 17.88 ± 0.48%, respectively. However, the average Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for the 30 separate cells using SnO2 ESLs without PCBM are 1.07 ± 0.02 V, 20.82 ± 0.29 mA cm−2, 74.23 ± 1.90%, and 16.50 ± 0.40%, respectively. It is evident that the use of SnO2/PCBM ESLs can improve all photovoltaic device performance parameters, including efficiency. We also measured the steady-state efficiency of cells using both SnO2/PCBM and unpassivated SnO2 ESLs by applying constant bias voltages that are consistent with the measured maximum power points in J–V measurements. The steady-state efficiency of the two solar cells, whose J–V curves are shown in Fig. 1a, is shown in Fig. 1d. The current densities first increased and then stabilized after applying a constant bias. The steady-state efficiencies of the cells using the SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs are 15.51% and 17.28%, respectively. These values are very close to the values averaged from the efficiencies obtained from the J–V curves measured in different voltage scanning directions. Just like the photovoltaic performance obtained from the J–V curves, the steady-state efficiency of the cell using a SnO2/PCBM ESL is much higher than that of the cell using only SnO2 as the ESL. It is also noted that the steady-state efficiency reaches the maximum value much faster for the cell using a SnO2/PCBM ESL than for the cell using an unpassivated SnO2 ESL. This indicates that the SnO2/PCBM ESL promotes electron transfer and reduces interface recombination.
Structural characterization reveals that the use of different ESLs did not cause any obvious changes in the grain size, thickness, or crystallinity of the perovskite layer, indicating that the performance enhancement induced by the use of the SnO2/PCBM ESL is likely due to the improvement of the ESL/perovskite interface. Fig. 2a and b show the top view SEM images of the perovskite films grown on the SnO2 ESL and SnO2/PCBM ESL, respectively. The perovskite films deposited on these two ESLs showed a very similar surface morphology. Both films are uniform, compact, and have no obvious pin holes. The grain sizes are about 500 nm. Fig. 2c and d show cross-sectional SEM images of the cells using SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs, respectively. The perovskite films have very similar thicknesses, about 600 nm. These results are consistent with the conclusion from XRD patterns shown in Fig. S3,†i.e., the use of the SnO2/PCBM ESL does not change the crystallinity of perovskite films.

Because PCBM has a band gap of ∼1.8 eV, it is critical to keep the PCBM layer as thin as possible so that the incorporation of PCBM would not adversely affect the current of the cells. Because the PCBM layer can be partially dissolved by DMF and DMSO during spin-coating of the perovskite precursor, the optimal PCBM amount can be realized by controlling the concentration of the PCBM solution. Fig. S4† shows the J–V curves of the cells using SnO2/PCBM ESLs with PCBM films deposited from solutions of 5, 10, and 15 mg mL−1 PCBM in dichlorobenzene. It shows that the PCBM solution with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 yielded the best-performing cells. The photovoltaic parameters of the cells using the SnO2/PCBM layer ESLs, with PCBM deposited by using the precursor solutions with varying PCBM concentrations, are summarized in Table S1.†Fig. 3a shows the transmission spectra of the FTO substrates covered with SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs. It is seen that the PCBM film prepared using a 10 mg mL−1 PCBM solution exhibits a strong absorption in the short wavelength range due to the absorption of PCBM. However, the perovskite films deposited on SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs show almost identical absorbance spectra (Fig. 3b). The perovskite film deposited on the SnO2/PCBM ESL doesn't show a PCBM absorption peak at ∼689 nm, indicating that most PCBM is washed away during the spin-coating process of the perovskite precursor, and the remaining PCBM must be just enough for passivation of SnO2. Such a thin, residual PCBM layer could not even be seen in our cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Therefore, the residual PCBM is not expected to significantly reduce the Jsc and QE of the cell, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. As evidenced from the above characterizations, the use of different ESLs did not cause any obvious change in the grain size, thickness, or crystallinity of the perovskite layers. Therefore, the performance enhancement induced by the use of a SnO2/PCBM ESL is most likely due to the improvement of the ESL/perovskite interfacial properties, such as better electron transfer and less charge recombination.

To further study the PCBM passivation effect, PL and TRPL were measured for perovskite films grown on SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs. Fig. 4a shows the PL spectra of the perovskite films, which show an emission peak at about 760 nm. It is seen that the PL intensity of the film deposited on the SnO2/PCBM ESL is much lower than that of the film deposited on the SnO2 ESL, while two films exhibit very similar absorption. The significantly reduced PL intensity can be attributed to the quenching effect caused by the faster electron transfer promoted by the PCBM. The TRPL results of the perovskite films deposited on SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs are shown in Fig. 4b. The curves were fitted by a biexponential decay function, while τ1 and τ2 represent the bulk recombination in perovskite bulk films and the delayed recombination of trapped charges, respectively.57 The values and ratio of τ1 and τ2 are summarized in Table S2.† It shows that the perovskite film deposited on the SnO2/PCBM ESL has a much lower τ2 with a lower ratio of τ2/τ1, indicating a faster electron transfer process and lower trap state density, as compared to the film deposited on the SnO2 ESL. Therefore, the solar cells using the SnO2/PCBM ESLs have lower interface recombination.

As the PCBM can be dissolved in DMF during spin-coating the perovskite precursor, a small amount of PCBM infiltrates into the perovskite films and passivates perovskite grain boundaries. To confirm the passivation effects of the PCBM, we also measured the AFM and the corresponding c-AFM images of the perovskite films deposited on SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs. The AFM images shown in Fig. 5a and c exhibit similar contrast, revealing a similar surface morphology for these perovskites. However, the c-AFM images with an applied bias of 0.25 V shown in Fig. 5b present rather different contrast, especially at grain boundaries. There is no direct correlation between the current and AFM images, suggesting that the observed difference in GB features is not due to artificial topographic effects. Although the current route spreads out from the contact, the spreading resistance is dominated by the nm-scale volume of the sample right below the probe, resulting in nm-resolution resistivity mapping. The film deposited on the SnO2 ESL shows higher intensity, which indicates a higher local current at grain boundaries than in the grain interior. However, for the perovskite film deposited on PCBM, there are much less grain boundaries showing higher current. The average current in the grain interior and at grain boundaries for the film deposited on the SnO2 ESL is 21.16 and 26.63 pA, respectively. However, the average current in the grain interior and at grain boundaries for the film deposited on the SnO2/PCBM ESL is 12.65 and 18.25 pA, respectively. The reduced current for the sample with PCBM can be attributed to the fact that PCBM can passivate the perovskite film and therefore can reduce the trap state density of the film.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been widely used to investigate charge recombination and transport at the interfaces in perovskite solar cells.63–68 To confirm that the use of a SnO2/PCBM ESL can in fact reduce the interfacial charge recombination, we performed EIS measurements on cells using SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs. Fig. S5† shows the Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit of the perovskite solar cells using unpassivated SnO2 and SnO2/PCBM ESLs. The Nyquist plots show a main semicircle in the low frequency range, which is very similar to that reported the literature.67,68 The Rs can be assigned to the value of the high-frequency intercept on the real axis. The Rrec in the low frequency range can be assigned to the recombination between electrons and holes.67 The Rsc in the high frequency range can be assigned to the charge transfer at the HSL/perovskite interface, which is much lower than Rrec. The corresponding semicircles in the high frequency range are very small in Fig. S5.†67,68 The Rs, Rsc, and Rrec estimated by fitting the Nyquist plots of the perovskite solar cells using SnO2 (SnO2/PCBM) ESLs are 6.3 (3.4) Ω cm2, 45.9 (42.0) Ω cm2, and 4323.6 (40045.6) Ω cm2, respectively. It is seen that the Rrec of the solar cell using the SnO2/PCBM ESL is significantly higher than that of the cell using the SnO2 ESL. The results indicate that the cell using the SnO2/PCBM ESL has a much lower interface recombination rate than the cell using the SnO2 ESL. This is in full agreement with the fact that fullerenes can significantly promote electron transfer and passivate the perovskite absorber layer. Due to the improved electron transfer and reduced charge recombination, the perovskite solar cells using SnO2/PCBM ESLs showed improved Voc's, Jsc's, FFs, and therefore PCEs as compared to the cells using SnO2 ESLs.

Fig. 6a shows the best-performing planar perovskite solar cell using the optimized SnO2/PCBM ESL. This cell achieved a PCE of 19.12% with a Voc of 1.12 V, a Jsc of 22.61 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.83% when measured under reverse voltage scanning and a PCE of 18.10% with a Voc of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 22.69 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.60% when measured under forward voltage scanning. The best-performing cell also achieved a steady-state efficiency of 17.75% with a steady-state current density of 19.48 mA cm−2 at a constant bias voltage of 0.911 V (Fig. 6b). It is noted that the full potential of the SnO2/PCBM ESL has not yet been attained. If the quality of our perovskite films (e.g. grain size) can be further improved, cells with even higher efficiencies could be produced with the aid of a SnO2/PCBM ESL.

It has been reported that, aside from PCBM, other fullerenes such as C60 can also promote electron transfer and reduce charge recombination. We have, therefore, fabricated the planar perovskite solar cells using SnO2/C60 ESLs. Our previous work has shown that ultra-thin C60 can function well as an ESL and exhibits a significant passivation effect at the perovskite interface.44,45 Fig. S6† shows the J–V curve of a planar perovskite solar cell using a C60 passivated SnO2 ESL. The C60 layer is about 5 nm thick. The solar cell achieved a PCE of 17.70% with a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 21.21 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.55% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. Just like the SnO2/PCBM ESL, the SnO2/C60 ESL can also improve the device's overall performance.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that SnO2 and fullerenes can work cooperatively to significantly boost the efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells. The best-performing perovskite solar cell using a PCBM-passivated SnO2 ESL has achieved a steady-state efficiency of 17.75% and a PCE of 19.12% with a Voc of 1.12 V, a Jsc of 22.61 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.83% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. Statistical results showed that the cells using PCBM-passivated SnO2 ESLs yielded much better performance than the cells using unpassivated SnO2 ESLs. Thin film and device characterizations revealed that the boost of efficiency by the use of PCBM-passivated SnO2 ESLs is mainly attributed to the improved electron transfer and reduced charge recombination at the ESL/perovskite interface. Our results demonstrate the potential of PCBM-passivated SnO2 ESLs for fabricating high-efficiency planar perovskite solar cells.
