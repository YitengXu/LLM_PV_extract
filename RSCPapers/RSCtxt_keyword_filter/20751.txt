    , Accepted 12th December 2022First published on 14th December 2022AbstractA series of D–A–D architectured molecules with quinoline as the central core and triarylamines (TAAs) at both terminals were synthesized and studied for their memory performance. The photophysical studies exhibited intramolecular charge transfer and the electrochemical studies gave a band gap of 2.63–2.98 eV. The different terminal groups in the D–A–D molecules tend to influence the performance of the memory devices and are explained through photophysical, electrochemical, morphological, and memory characterizations of the compounds. All the compounds were assigned to have a non-volatile WORM memory behavior with long-lasting retention and endurance cycles. The electron-donating terminals gave the highest on/off ratio (104) and lowest threshold voltage (−1.10 V) owing to the balance of charge transport within the D–A–D system. The charge transfer along with the charge trap in the compounds vindicates the mechanism for these memory devices. The feasible synthetic routes with the efficient memory performance of these D–A–D compounds make them superior ones in the field of organic electronics.
Introduction
The field of organic synthesis and the library of organic molecules are evolving rapidly with new methods or procedures emerging at every nook and corner.1 These molecules could be put to use in a vast variety of applications. One such architecture of organic molecules that has caught immense admiration is the donor–acceptor (D–A) type molecules.2 The D–A systems have particularly gained attention for their unique characteristics like (i) easy charge transfer within the molecule which could be utilized for a wide range of applications, (ii) manipulation of the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the compounds by simple alterations in the molecular structure, and (iii) charge carrier transport in the solid state facilitating eco-friendly and cost-effective solution processable methods for the fabrication of devices.3 Although various D–A polymers are preceding in the field of organic electronics, D–A small molecules are preferred in various applications because of the monodisperse nature of the compounds, highly reproducible and simple synthetic routes, easy purification, and high solubility.4 While deliberating the rational construction and modulation of highly ordered D–A systems, one has to consider the ease of chemical modification, solubility, and appreciable HOMO and LUMO levels for both the donor and acceptor molecules.5
Quinoline derivatives for a long time were only used in drug design and biomedical applications.6,7 But these molecules also showed semiconducting properties which are now being utilized in organic electronics.8 A small D–A system was synthesized using quinoline derivatives bearing a fluorenyl motif through a Ru-catalyzed reaction, which provided a power conversion efficiency of 0.25% in bulk heterojunction solar cells.9 Another D–A system utilizing a 2,4-difluorenylquinoline derivative with various alkyl chain lengths displayed blue light emission with a fluorescence efficiency of 63–97% in solution for OLEDs.10 Donor–acceptor systems in different architectures (D–A–D and A–A–D) were designed and synthesized for organic field-effect transistors with quinoline being the backbone of the chemical structure demonstrating hole mobility of 0.0032 cm2 V−1 s−1.11 Thus quinolines have proven to be an important semiconducting material with good charge carrier properties and high fluorescence ability. Yet these molecules are not explored in the field of organic memory devices. Organic memory devices benefitting from a stable D–A system are the need of the hour and quinoline derivatives with suitable electron-donating substituents could fulfill this requirement.
Organic memory devices have outpaced the conventional inorganic ones in terms of their simple two-terminal device architecture, excellent miniaturization potential, versatile material selection, faster switching with low energy consumption, and high switching endurance.12 Resistive random access memory (RRAM) especially has a huge advantage over the conventional memory devices as it solves the limitations like high production cost, high power consumption, complex processes of manufacturing, etc.13 A typical RRAM device is a sandwiched structure with a resistive switching material between two terminal electrodes.14 Memory characteristics are achieved by fine-tuning the applied voltages and the threshold voltage, on/off ratio, endurance cycle, and retention time are measured from the current–voltage curves, which indicate the memory behavior of the systems.15 The memory behavior of the organic molecules may be due to the formation of filaments, intermolecular charge transfer, filling of charge traps, or even the redox behavior of the molecules.16 These behaviors are analyzed for the molecules under study and recognized for a particular mechanism of the memory devices. Even with all these developments for new materials for the active layer, organic memories still have shortcomings related to the poor self-assembling nature of organic molecules observed in thin films.17,18 This can be improved by incorporating equal-strength donor and acceptor units in the active layer of the memory devices.
In this work, we have looked towards one such memristor architecture by the use of a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) system utilizing triarylamine and quinoline as the donor and acceptor units respectively. A deeper understanding of the steric and electronic effects of terminal donor and acceptor groups that influence the performance of memory devices is explored. The molecules are functionalized with –tert-butylphenyl, –CHO, and –CN as the terminal groups attached to the triarylamine units. These could give a profound understanding of the structure-property relationship of such terminal groups to create a balance between the optimum threshold voltage and better memory performance. (i) tert-Butylphenyl groups owing to the electron-donating nature can contribute to the larger steric effect controlling the intermolecular interactions in the molecules19 (ii) CN and CHO along with their electron-withdrawing effect can lower the HOMO–LUMO levels of the molecules.20 Altogether these terminal groups could alter the energy levels and thereby the electrical conductivity of the organic semiconductors. Taking all these into account, the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological, and memory characteristics of the D–A–D molecules are investigated.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The dibromoquinoline was synthesized using a Pfitzinger reaction of 5-bromosatin with the corresponding acetophenone yielding the acid derivative of quinoline. The esterification of the acid derivative produces the ester-flanked dibromoquinolines in good yield. The acetylenes of triarylamines were prepared from their corresponding triarylamine centers through a Sonagashira cross-coupling reaction with trimethylsilylacetylene. The synthesis of the butterfly-shaped D–A–D molecules involves a Sonagashira coupling reaction between the ester-flanked quinoline and triarylamines. The compounds are designed to have a maximum charge transfer within the molecule through a push–pull of electrons within the D–A–D system (Fig. 1). The electron-donating (tert-butylphenyl) and -withdrawing (–CHO and –CN) substituents were incorporated into the triarylamine end to modify the electronic energy levels and to rework the molecular packing in the compounds. All the compounds were synthesized in moderate to good yields and the synthetic route is provided in the ESI† (Scheme S1). The compounds 14a–d are soluble in most of the common organic solvents, which makes them suitable for solution-processable electronic device applications.

Photophysical studies
The charge transfer characteristics and their absorption properties were evaluated from UV-visible spectroscopy. The compounds showed two consecutive bands corresponding to the n–π* and π–π* transitions with the compounds 14a–b having an extra shoulder peak (Fig. 2(a)). The λmax ranging from 345–418 nm in their absorption spectra corresponds to the n–π* along with the intramolecular charge transfer in the compounds with 14a possessing the highest ICT. Interestingly, the intensity of absorption changes with the change in electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in the compounds (Table 1). The electron-donating tert-butylphenyl substituent gave the maximum intensity while a diminution in intensity is observed for the electron-withdrawing –CHO and –CN substituents.21 The emission spectra of the compounds also showed distinct peaks with emission maxima falling in the range of 471–567 nm (Fig. 2(b)).

The solid-state absorption spectra demonstrate a red shift from the solution spectra in the λmax of the compounds with broader peaks (Fig. S13, ESI†). A significant shift in absorption and emission maxima in the solid state was observed for compound 14d with –CN substitution. The molecular interactions with increased polarizability in the solid state make the compound 14d substantial for longer wavelength absorption. The Stokes’ shift of the molecules is also admirable and does make the compounds suitable for organic electronic applications. The larger Stokes’ shift blocks the reabsorption of emitted photons, thereby canceling out the inner-filter effect.22 The larger absorption coefficient of the compounds also signifies the extended conjugation with an increase in π-electron delocalization. Compound 14b has the highest value of absorption coefficient and Stokes’ shift owing to its tert-butylphenyl substitution.23 Compared with the electron-withdrawing substituents, the electron-donating substituents have longer absorption bands, larger Stokes shifts, and broader emission bands. These cumulatively designate the molecules with higher and more effective ICT.
Electrochemical studies
The HOMO, LUMO, and bandgap of the compounds were calculated from cyclic voltammetry by carefully obtaining an insight into the oxidation and reduction procurement in the compounds. The first oxidation peak at 1.10–1.35 V represents the corresponding one-electron oxidation of the triarylamine ends24 (Fig. S14, ESI†). The symmetric substitution of the triarylamine groups substantiates the shift in oxidation at this region with the additional pull from the compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents.25 This furnishes the shift in the Eox of compounds 14c and 14d, whereas compounds 14a and 14b with electron-donating substituents oxidize at lower potentials.
The reduction of the quinoline molecule is another significant peak occurring at high negative potentials.10 The influence of the substituents is observed with compounds having electron-withdrawing substituents (14c and 14d) facilitating reduction at lower potentials with increasing intensity. The easily oxidizable triarylamine ends and easily reducible quinoline cores together generate low HOMO and high LUMO levels, which further creates compounds with small band gaps. The bandgap of the compounds ranges from 2.63 to 2.98 eV, as listed in Table 2. The computational data for the HOMO, LUMO, and band gap values match well with the experimental ones. The tert-butylphenyl substituted compound 14b exhibits the lowest bandgap (2.63 eV) owing to its increased electron density and electron-donating ability leading to a low-lying HOMO and a high LUMO level. This makes the electron transfer from HOMO to LUMO levels easier, giving the molecule an added advantage of increased ICT.

Morphological studies
For estimating the thin-film morphology of the compounds, scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was performed. The thin films were fabricated in an ITO-coated glass plate and annealed for 30 minutes at 80 °C. All the compounds showed excellent self-assembly with maximum surface coverage showing the homogeneity of the films. The high and low magnifications of the thin-film morphologies of compounds 14a–c are depicted in Fig. 3. Compound 14a has a ribbon-like morphology whereas 14b shows a dense long rod-like morphology. The compounds 14c and 14d have a coral network in their thin film morphologies. The better molecular ordering and greater self-assembly in the thin films could be highly beneficial for thin-film-based organic memristors.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of the compounds 14a–d. 
To decipher the crystallinity of the compounds, GIXRD studies of the thin films of the compounds were conducted (Fig. 4). All the compounds exhibit sharp and highly intense peaks owing to the higher crystallinity of the compounds. The sharp peak at 2θ = 32° of the compounds 14a–c corresponds to the interplanar distance of 2.85 nm owing to a good molecular ordering leading to the high order crystallinity in the compounds.26 Compound 14d has a highly intense peak at 44° with a smaller d-spacing of 2.08 nm, which could be more beneficial for the self-assembly of the compound. Additional relatively less intense peaks are present at 35 and 38° assigned with a d-spacing of 2.56 and 2.40 nm, respectively. These data suggest that the compounds behave better in their thin-film state supporting the memory device performance. The molecular packing and hopping distances found through the computational methods also substantiate with experimental data and benefit the molecular ordering in the thin-film of the devices (Fig. S17, ESI†).

Memory characteristics
A standard two-terminal sandwich device using the symmetric D–A–D compounds was fabricated in an ITO/14a–d/Ag configuration after the complete evaporation of the active and electrode layers. To avoid any sneak current from the adjacent cell, the active layer was carefully coated on the ITO plate and the silver electrodes were sputter-coated above it with the help of a mask. A binary bit cell memory storage of the devices was observed which could be explained as follows. The bottom electrode was grounded while the top electrode was given a DC with steps of 0.05 V. All the electrical measurements were carried out in ambient conditions which makes the devices highly favorable for commercial applications. The ITO/14a/Ag device resides in the high resistance state initially, which escalates to the low resistance state from 4.50 × 10−6 to 4.40 × 10−2 A after a switching threshold of −1.25 V (Fig. 5). The device is in the ON state generating the “writing” process with an on/off ratio of 104.27 The reduction of the switching voltage is made possible by closely contemplating the work function of the top electrode with the HOMO level of the compounds. The device does not switch back to the OFF state even after cutting out the voltage or reapplying the voltage in positive or negative polarities. It stays in the ON state for more than 12 hours making these devices the conventional non-volatile WORM memory type.28 The other devices with 14b, 14c, and 14d all showed binary WORM memory behavior with differences in their threshold voltages and on/off ratios. Observing the trend in the on/off ratios, it is noticed that the compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents at the triarylamines have lower on/off ratios and higher threshold voltages compared to the ones with electron-donating substituents.29 This is true compared to the observations made in the earlier work suggesting equal strength of donors and acceptors to be incorporated in the molecules for having a balanced charge transfer leading to better memory performance.29 The electron-donating tert-butylphenyl groups and triarylamine with no substituents gave the maximum on/off ratio of 104 and a threshold voltage as low as −1.10 and −1.25 V, respectively. The electron-donating substituents formulate the charge conduction pathway much easier contributing to the maximum ICT and thereby formulating a smooth memory operation. This can be supported by their bandgap values as well, where compound 14b has the lowest bandgap rendering a good hole transport within the system. The electron-withdrawing groups –CHO and –CN, on the other hand, have an on/off ratio of 103 and a higher threshold voltage of −1.28 and −1.60 V, respectively, owing to their higher bandgap values.30

The logI–logV graph was plotted for understanding the mechanism prevailing in the devices (Fig. 6). The device 14a at low voltages was in an ohmic conductance state with the graph showing a slope of 0.79. There is a sudden increase in this slope at the switching threshold voltage (59.14) where the device switches from ohmic to trap-filled charge transfer. After this sudden increase, the slope (1.12) fits back to ohmic conductance at higher voltages. It stays in the ohmic conductance state even in the second sweep with a slope of 1.11. This transition from ohmic to trap-filled charge transfer and then back to ohmic conductance proves that the trap-filled space-charge limited current (SCLC) mechanism prevails in these devices.31 The devices with 14a–d tend to show similar mechanisms depicting the non-volatile WORM memory behavior of the devices.
 Fig. 6  Experimental and fitted curves of the electrical characteristics of the memory devices 14a–d. 
The stability of the devices was determined by the endurance and retention tests of the devices.32 The devices showed excellent stability under the constant stress of 0.5 V (both ON and OFF states) for 103 s in their retention test and 100 cycles in their endurance test (Fig. S18 and S19, ESI†). This promises the devices to be stable under ambient conditions over a longer period of time. The threshold voltage distribution of the devices 14a–d from their I–V plots is also incorporated (Fig. S20, ESI†).
Resistive switching mechanism
The mechanism of the memory devices was overlooked by many factors. One of them includes the determination of the work function of the electrodes with the HOMO–LUMO of the compounds to examine the majority of charge carriers prevailing in the system. The energy level diagram of the work functions of the electrodes with the HOMO and LUMO of the compounds suggests that the hole injection from ITO to the HOMO of the compounds is energetically favorable (Fig. 7(b)).33 This promises holes to be the major carriers in the system as the hole injection barrier is smaller than the electron injection barrier. Furthermore, the hole injection barrier is smaller for the compounds 14a–b than 14c–d making the former devices more likely to have lower threshold voltages.34

The different mechanisms prevailing in the literature are considered for the switching behavior of organic compounds. Several pieces of literature rule out the possibility of filamentary conduction as the mechanism behind the resistive switching of organic memory devices with the simple two-terminal architecture.35,36
For a better understanding of the working of the memory devices, theoretical calculations using Gaussian 09 were carried out to consider the charge transfer and trapping in the compounds.13 The HOMO of the compounds 14a–b is located in the triarylamine molecule whereas the compounds 14c–d have electron density throughout the backbone (Fig. 8). The LUMO of all the compounds is located at the quinoline core portraying the electron-accepting nature of the molecule. This creates a smooth charge transfer pathway for compounds 14a and 14b which is enhanced further by the charge distribution in the LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals. This charge transfer from HOMO to LUMO is not seen in compounds 14c and 14d whereas further in the higher energy states (LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) the charge transfer is visible.37
 Fig. 8  Molecular orbitals of compounds 14a–d. 
As per the DFT calculations, there is a positive electrostatic potential (ESP) making a continuous channel of charge transport throughout the π-conjugated compounds (Fig. 7(a)).38 The red regions in the ESP images serve as “charge traps” in the compounds hampering the smooth flow of charge. These traps are created by the quinoline acceptor moieties in all the compounds whereas the electron-donating tert-butylphenyl substituent provides a smooth positive conduction pathway. Devices 14a–b have only the quinoline core traps present leading to higher on/off ratios and lower threshold voltages for the corresponding devices. The electron-withdrawing groups (–CHO and –CN) of the compounds 14c–d provide an extra trapping site for those devices leading to a slightly lower on/off ratio and higher threshold voltages compared to 14a–b. The mechanism of the memory devices is as follows: the injection barrier in the charge conduction allows the devices to be in a high-resistance state at lower voltages, which impedes the conduction from donor to acceptor. At higher voltages, the charge carriers attain adequate energy to transfer from donor to acceptor and subsequently fill up the charge traps present in the molecules. Furthermore, the sealing of traps can then provide a smoother pathway for the charge carriers offering intra and intermolecular charge transfer, which is responsible for the switching from OFF to ON states. The stable charge transfers along with the retained charges in the traps sustain the ON state for a longer period making the compounds non-volatile WORM memory devices.
Conclusions
A series of new D–A–D architectured quinoline-based compounds are synthesized and characterized. These compounds predominantly exhibited WORM memory behavior with low threshold voltages and on/off ratios up to 104. The terminal groups attached to the triarylamine donor moiety tend to influence the photophysical, electrochemical, and memory performances of the compounds. The intramolecular charge transfer was easily observable from the higher wavelength of the absorption bands (350–418 nm) and the higher Stokes’ shift (122–213 nm) in the compounds. Thin-film XRD and SEM analysis proved that the compounds have higher molecular ordering and better self-assembly. The electron-donating tert-butylphenyl and simple TAA terminal groups gave the lowest band gap values of 2.63 and 2.69 eV, respectively, which was reflected in their memory device characteristics with low threshold voltages (−1.10 V and −1.25 V) and higher on/off ratio of 104. The electron-withdrawing (–CHO and –CN) terminal ends gave comparatively higher band gaps (2.87 eV and 2.98 eV) owing to their higher thresholds (−1.28 V and −1.60 V) and lower on/off ratios (103) in the memory characteristics. The mechanism of the resistive switching is explained by using a charge injection barrier in which holes were found to be the predominant charge carriers whereas an efficient charge transfer, as well as charge trapping, served as the reason for the WORM memory behavior of the system. In conclusion, the D–A–D system with appropriate terminal groups offering a balance in charge transfer within the system is favorable for the best performance of the memory devices.
