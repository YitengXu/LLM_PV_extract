    , Accepted 16th April 2021First published on 6th May 2021AbstractThe organic diammonium cation spacers in the 2D Dion–Jacobson (DJ) perovskites play an important role in the stability and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the resulting perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Here, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenedimethanammonium (TFBDA) is used to prepare a novel 2D DJ perovskite film which displays dense and well-distributed morphology as well as improved charge transport. The best-performing 2D DJ PVSC based on TFBDA exhibits an outstanding PCE of 15.24%, outperforming its counterpart based on the nonfluorinated diammonium analogue of 1,4-benzenedimethanammonium (BDA) which shows a PCE of 9.16%. Moreover, the unencapsulated TFBDA-based device can retain over 90% of its initial PCE upon the exposure to ambient air (40–70% relative humidity) for 1300 h, and over 80% of its initial PCE after the thermal annealing at 80 °C for 100 h, demonstrating its obviously improved moisture-resistance and heat-resistance performances than its nonfluorinated counterpart. The increased PCE with improved stability for the TFBDA-based devices can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the fluorine atom as well as the stronger interaction between the fluorinated organic spacer and the inorganic slab. Our work provides an important strategy to further improve the efficiency as well as the stability of 2D DJ PVSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are intensively researched for solar cells because of their superior merits such as large absorption coefficients, high charge carrier mobilities, high defect tolerance, and long carrier diffusion lengths.1–6 So far, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has exceeded 25%.7 However, the fast degradation of these high-efficiency PVSCs induced by thermal, moisture, and light has prevented their commercialization.8,9 Recently, perovskites with reduced-dimension (known as quasi-2D) are emerging due to their remarkable intrinsic hydrophobicity stemmed from the inserted large organic molecules.10–15 The quasi-2D perovskites can be classified as Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (RPPs) and Dion–Jacobson perovskites (DJPs) which have the general formulas of A2Bn−1MnX3n+1 and A′Bn−1MnX3n+1, respectively. In these two formulas, A is a monovalent organic cation such as propylammonium, A′ is a divalent organic cation such as propylene diammonium, B is a small cation (e.g., methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+)), M is a divalent metal cation, and X is a halide anion.16 The layer number (n) of the inorganic slabs containing [PbI6]4− octahedra can be controlled by adjusting the content of the large organic ammonium cation in the precursor solution.12,16,17 Adjacent inorganic slabs are linked through double-layer organic ligands for RPPs while only single-layer ligands for DJPs, which produces the differences in the interlamellar spacing and interaction force of the two perovskites.16 So far, there are a few monovalent organic cations used for RPPs such as propylammonium (PA+),18 butylammonium (BA+),14 and phenylethylammonium (PEA+)19 (shown in Fig. 1). For example, Kanatzidis et al. reported an RP phase (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) perovskite film with a preferential out-of-plane alignment fabricated by a hot-casting method.14 An efficiency of 12.52% for the resulting solar cells was achieved, and over 60% of the pristine efficiency can be retained after over 2250 h storage under 65% relative humidity (RH).14 In RPPs, the double-layer organic monovalent cations interact with each other through van der Waals force, and they also interact with inorganic slabs through an ionic bond. While the single-layer divalent cations in DJPs only connect with inorganic slabs at both sides by ionic interactions thereby excluding the relatively weak van der Waals force and leading to an intensified structure.16 As shown in Fig. 1, several diammonium cations such as 1,3-propanediammonium (PDA2+),18 1,4-butanediammonium (BuDA2+),20 1,5-pentamethylene diammonium (PeDA2+),21 1,4-benzenediammonium (BzDA2+),22 and 1,4-benzenedimethanammonium (BDA2+)23 have been developed for DJPs with excellent photovoltaic performances. For example, based on the PDA2+ cation, Li et al. demonstrated an unprecedentedly stable 2D DJ perovskite solar cell with a maximum PCE of 13.3%. Furthermore, they reported that the devices can retain 95% of their original efficiency after 4000 h in high humidity, or 168 h in 85 °C, or 3000 h under light irradiation without any encapsulation.18 It is crucial to control the orientation of the perovskite for high-performance 2D PVSCs.11,12 To obtain perovskite films with a vertical crystal alignment, the hot-casting method is commonly used.14,18 And among various chemical modifications, fluorination is recognized as an effective way to enhance hydrophobicity of organic materials. So far, some fluorinated ammonium cations have been used to passivate the interfacial defects of PVSCs for improving their photovoltaic performances and humidity-resistant properties.24–27 Besides, the fluorinated compounds have also been introduced in 2D RP PVSCs as spacer cations to regulate the crystal orientation or the n-phase distribution of 2D perovskites.28,29 For example, You et al. used three fluorinated phenylethylammonium cations with the fluorine at different positions for fabricating 2D RP PVSCs. They demonstrated that the perovskite film based on the 4-fluorophenethylammonium (4FPEA+) cation showed regulated phase distribution and preferred crystal orientation. As a result, the devices based on 4FPEA+ exhibited a maximum PCE of 10.89% which is higher than the devices based on the nonfluorinated PEA+ cation (7.95%).28 Subsequently, the 2D RP PVSCs based on 4FPEA+ were also reported by some other research groups with high efficiencies and excellent stability.29–32 These results suggest that the fluorinated organic spacers can significantly boost the performance of PVSCs. However, the fluorinated diammonium cation has never been reported for 2D DJ PVSCs, to the best of our knowledge.

In this work, a new fluorinated diammonium cation of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenedimethanammonium (TFBDA2+) is developed for 2D DJ PVSCs. To understand effect of the inserted fluorine atoms, the nonfluorinated cation of 1,4-benzenedimethanammonium (BDA2+) is used for comparison. Consequently, quasi-2D perovskites based on the TFBDA2+ cation exhibited lower defect density, higher charge mobility, and more eminent stability compared with those based on BDA2+. Hence, the PVSCs based on the TFBDA2+ cation exhibited a higher PCE of 15.24% and improved stability than the BDA-based devices which showed a PCE of 9.16%. The PVSCs based on the fluorinated cation can retain more than 90% of the initial PCE when stored in the ambient atmosphere (40–70% RH) for 1300 h without any encapsulation while those based on the nonfluorinated cation can only retain about 70% of their original efficiency when stored in the same ambient atmosphere. The significantly increased PCE with improved stability is associated with more hydrophobic nature of the fluorinated cations and the strong interactions between the fluorinated cations and the inorganic slabs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Characterization of perovskite films based on the fluorinated diammonium cation
The new fluorinated diammonium cation (TFBDA2+ in Fig. 1) was designed and synthesized by the reaction of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenedimethanamine with hydroiodic acid. The synthetic details and characterization are provided in the ESI.† To evaluate the optical properties of the prepared 2D perovskite ((TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1) films with different n values (n = 1, 2, 3, 5, 10) and the 3D MAPbI3 perovskite (n = ∞), their absorption spectra (Fig. 2a) and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2b) were measured. As shown in the inserted images of Fig. 2a, perovskite films with increasing n values show gradually deepening color from yellow to dark-brown. The absorption onset of the (TFBDA)PbI4 (n = 1) film is 501 nm, while the absorption onset of the (TFBDA)MAPb2I7 (n = 2) film increases to 762 nm which is close to that of the 3D perovskite film (785 nm). With the increasing n values, the (TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 film shows gradually increased absorption coefficients with reduced bandgaps of 1.61, 1.60, and 1.59 eV for n = 3, 5, and 10, respectively, which is in accordance with the color change trend of these films. These results imply that a large portion of high-n phases were formed when incorporating MAI in the pure 2D (TFBDA)PbI4 film. The PL spectra exhibit the same tendency with the increasing n value. The PL peak of (TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 film for n = 1 is located at 494 nm and the major PL peaks of (TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 films for n = 2, 3, 5, and 10 are located at 749, 758, 763, and 773 nm, respectively, which are close to the PL peak of the 3D perovskite (778 nm). Furthermore, the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the PL of the pure 2D perovskite (n = 1) is narrow (32 nm), indicating a pure 2D phase. When the n value increases to 2, the perovskite film exhibits several emission peaks of 486, 545, 595, and 667 nm, suggesting the coexistence of multiple perovskite phases with various n values in the film. Films with n = 3, 5, and 10 also show the concomitant PL peaks at about 480, 550, and 600 nm as shown in the enlarged PL spectra (Fig. S1†) indicating the presence of mixed phases including low n-value (2D-like) and high n-value (3D-like) phases. Dramatically, as the n value further increases from 2 to 10, the FWHM of the major PL emission gradually decreases from 94 to 53 nm as shown in Fig. 2c, which indicates that the (TFBDA)MA9Pb10I31 (n = 10) film prefers to form a more organized film with a narrower distribution of a high n-value phase.

(c) The FWHM of a major PL peak (black line for the left co-ordinate) and the XRD pattern at (011) (pink line for the right co-ordinate) with increased n values. (d) XRD patterns of perovskite films with different n values. 
We also obtained the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of (TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 films with different n values. As shown in Fig. 2d, two dominant peaks at ∼14° and 28° corresponding to the crystallographic planes of (011) and (022) for the perovskite films, respectively, suggest the vertically preferred orientation relative to the substrate.33 In most of the reported literature studies,18,34,35 the XRD patterns of pure perovskite films (n = 1) did not show the dominated (011) reflection. However, the (TFBDA)PbI4 perovskite film in this work shows distinct (011) reflection at 14.81°. This result indicates that the perovskite film with the fluorinated cation spacer prefers to induce a vertical orientation. To confirm this, we measured the orientation of the (TFBDA)PbI4 film by using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) shown in Fig. S2b.† The (TFBDA)PbI4 film shows a preferential growth as evidenced by the difference in in-plane and out-of-plane directions in 1D GIWAXS line profiles (Fig. S2d†). The appearance of two Bragg spots at 0.98 and 1.96 Å−1 along the qxy direction for the (TFBDA)PbI4 film, which represent the (011) and (022) reflection, respectively,36–38 supports the vertical orientation. As a comparison, the GIWAXS experiment on the nonfluorinated (BDA)PbI4 film was also carried out. As shown in Fig. S2a and S2c,† we did not observe the preferential Bragg spots representing the vertical orientation of the (BDA)PbI4 film. As the n values increase, the (011) and (022) reflections exhibit shifts toward lower angles, which is related to the change in the lattice parameter.18 Based on the (011) reflection, the interplanar spacings of (TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 films are 5.97, 6.17, 6.21, 6.25, and 6.25 Å for n = 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10, respectively. Besides, for n = 2, 3, and 5, the (TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 films have an unfavorable PbI2 phase at 12.7°. This phase was not observed in the film with n = 10 probably due to the instability of perovskite films with a much broader distribution of the n phase. Similarly, the FWHMs of the (011) reflection increase first and then decrease with the increasing n values as shown in Fig. 2c. And (TFBDA)MA9Pb10I31 exhibits a decreased FWHM of 0.25° in comparison with (TFBDA)MAPb2I7 (0.58°). These results indicate that the perovskite film (n = 10) has enhanced overall crystallinity compared with the fewer-layer perovskite films (n = 2, 3, and 5).
2.2 Photoluminescence and bandgaps
The film of (TFBDA)MA9Pb10I31 (named as FMPI) was selected to compare with that of (BDA)MA9Pb10I31 (named as BMPI) due to its ordered structure and enhanced light-harvesting ability. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (Fig. 3a) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) (Fig. 3b) were performed to investigate the kinetics of charge carriers in the perovskite films. The FMPI film exhibits a slightly red-shifted PL peak at 773 nm in comparison with that of the BMPI film (764 nm). Moreover, the PL intensity of the FMPI film is more than 10 times higher than that of the BMPI film, indicating the suppressed nonradiative recombination of the FMPI film which is also in connection with its reduced trap density. The TPRL curves were fitted with a double exponential function, using which we acquired the short lifetimes (τ1) of 8 and 169 ns for the BMPI and FMPI, respectively, and the long lifetimes (τ2) of 41 and 470 ns for the BMPI and FMPI, respectively. Thus, the calculated average decay times (τavg) for the BMPI and FMPI films are 34 and 413 ns, respectively. The obviously increased decay times for the FMPI film suggest a suppressed non-radiative surface and bulk recombination which are associated with the reduced defects and disorders at the grain boundaries thereby leading to the improved VOC.39,40

The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the BMPI film was obtained and compared with that of the FMPI film in Fig. S3a.† The optical bandgap for BMPI is calculated to be 1.60 eV based on its absorption onset. To analyze the energy level of the BMPI and FMPI films, the UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted and the results are shown in Fig. S3b.† The valence band maximum (VBM) could be estimated using the formula of VBM = 21.22 eV − (Ecutoff − Eonset). The calculated VBMs for BMPI and FMPI films are −6.60 and −6.41 eV, respectively. Based on the energy levels of SnO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD from the literature results,41,42 we obtained the energy level alignments of the PVSCs (Fig. 3c). In Fig. 3c, one may find that the FMPI perovskite will realize more efficient electron transfer to SnO2 in comparison with the BMPI perovskite in the corresponding PVSCs.
2.3 Photovoltaic performance
To compare the photovoltaic performance of PVSCs based on (TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (n > 1) with different n values, we fabricated planar devices using the configuration of ITO/SnO2/2D DJ perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)/Au (Fig. S4a†). The PCEs for the best-performance devices based on (TFBDA)MAn−1PbnI3n+1 with different n values are summarized in Table 1 and the corresponding J–V curves are presented in Fig. S4b.† The FMPI-based device exhibited the highest PCE which is attributed to its enhanced absorption and more ordered n-phase distribution. To evaluate the effect of the diammonium spacer fluorination on the device performance, PVSCs based on FMPI and BMPI using the n–i–p structure mentioned above were fabricated and characterized. The cross-sectional SEM images of the BMPI- and FMPI-based devices and the schematic diagrams of proposed 2D slices distribution are illustrated in Fig. S5a and S5b,† respectively. The thicknesses of SnO2, perovskites, and Spiro-OMeTAD were about 23, 210, and 180 nm, in that order. The cross-sectional morphologies of both devices suggest that the FMPI layer exhibits more compact stacking than the BMPI layer which has many pinholes. Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices. The BMPI-based device exhibited a maximum PCE of 9.16% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.03 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 12.39 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72.14%. In contrast, the FMPI-based device showed a significantly increased PCE of 15.24%, with a VOC of 1.05 V, a JSC of 18.76 mA cm−2, and an FF of 77.31%. The hysteretic behaviors of the PVSCs were analyzed by measuring their J–V curves from reverse and forward scans (Fig. S6†). And the corresponding photovoltaic parameters including the hysteresis index (HI) defined as (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse are summarized in Table S1.† A relatively large HI of 0.26 was observed for both the BMPI and FMPI-based PVSCs, which can be associated with the ionic migration (iodide or organic cations) and ferroelectric properties of the perovskites due to the existence of the slow polarization effect.43 The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the BMPI- and FMPI-based PVSCs are illustrated in Fig. 4b. The EQE spectra suggest that the FMPI-based device has stronger absorption in the wavelength from 300 to 800 nm than the BMPI-based device. The integrated JSC values are 12.81 and 18.66 mA cm−2 for the BMPI- and FMPI-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the measured JSC values from the J–V curves within 5% error.

Besides, the steady-state power output (SPO) at a maximum power point of the best-performing devices was measured. As shown in Fig. 4c, the FMPI-based PVSC delivered a stabilized PCE of 13.50% while the BMPI-based PVSC exhibited a continuous downward trend under constant illumination suggesting the enhanced light stability for the FMPI-based PVSC. The SPO efficiencies of both devices are slightly inferior to the PCEs obtained from the J–V curves, which is due to the hysteresis behavior of the devices. We fabricated 40 devices based on BMPI and FMPI films, respectively, and the PCEs distributions are summarized in the histogram (Fig. 4d). The average PCE of the BMPI-based PVSCs is about 7.09% with a standard deviation of 1.40%. Whereas, the FMPI-based PVSCs show a much higher average PCE of 14.10% with a standard deviation of 0.75%. The narrower PCE distribution for the FMPI-based devices signifies better repeatability, implying the salient advantage of the FMPI-based DJ perovskite in practical applications.
2.4 Crystal structures
To study the effect of fluorination on the structure of the 2D DJ perovskite and to investigate the packing arrangements of the diammonium cations between the inorganic sheets, perovskite single crystals (n = 1) with TFBDA2+ and BDA2+ cations were obtained using a step-cooling method with stoichiometric ratios of PbI2 and diammonium cations according to the chemical formula as previously reported.44 The specific process is shown in the ESI.† The pure 2D perovskite single crystal was studied because the phase of n = 1 is the basic building block. The chemical structures of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzenedimethanamine (TFBDA) and 1,4-benzenedimethanamine (BDA) are shown in Fig. 5a and the single crystal structure of (TFBDA)PbI4 is shown in Fig. 5b and c. The (TFBDA)PbI4 crystal shows a laminar and regular 2D structure, in which the adjacent TFBDA2+ ligands adopt an edge-to-face stacking arrangement. The layer-to-layer distances of the crystallographic planes (100) and (011) of (TFBDA)PbI4 are 12.92 and 5.98 Å, respectively. However, the single crystal with the BDA2+ cation has one-dimensional chain-like skeleton ((BDA)PbI4·DMF) rather than two-dimensional (BDA)PbI4 under the same growth conditions as that of the (TFBDA)PbI4 single crystal. As shown in Fig. S7a,† the packing structure of the (BDA)PbI4·DMF single crystal begins with the organic dimethylformamide (DMF), which indicates that DMF can act as an electron donating unit to interact with electron-deficient BDA2+ to form the one-dimensional structure. To confirm the presence of DMF in the (BDA)PbI4·DMF crystal, IR and 1H NMR spectra were obtained (Fig. S8†). Based on the difference in their crystal structures, it can be speculated that the introduction of fluorine atoms induces stronger hydrogen bonding interactions between the organic spacers and the inorganic slabs thereby intensifying the layered crystal structure. The crystallographic data for (TFBDA)PbI4 and (BDA)PbI4·DMF single crystals are summarized in Table S2.† As shown in Fig. 5d, the powder XRD pattern of the (TFBDA)PbI4 single crystal verified the phase purity according to the well-matched experimental and simulated results. Whereas, as shown in Fig. S7b,† the powder XRD pattern of (BDA)PbI4·DMF does not match with its simulated result because the as-prepared powder is highly unstable in air. The XRD patterns of (TFBDA)PbI4 (n = 1) and (BDA)PbI4 (n = 1) films are also compared in Fig. 5d and S5b,† respectively. The (TFBDA)PbI4 single crystal and the (TFBDA)PbI4 film exhibit similar peak positions especially at ∼14° further confirming the preferred vertical orientation of the TFBDA-based perovskite film. It should be noted that, for a PVSC device, vertical orientation is in favor of an efficient carrier transport in the perovskite film. Moreover, the XRD patterns of the FMPI and BMPI films are compared in Fig. S9a.† The FMPI and BMPI films show two clear peaks at 14.2° and 28.5°, corresponding to crystallographic planes (011) and (022), respectively. The FMPI film shows (011) and (022) peaks with higher diffraction intensities and a decreased FWHM of 0.25° for the (011) peak compared with that of 0.27° for the BMPI film. The increased diffraction intensity and the decreased FWHM for the FMPI film suggest its increased crystallinity.29

2.5 Morphology and carrier transportation
Because the performance of PVSCs is closely connected with their film morphology, we studied the superficial morphologies of BMPI and FMPI films using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The SEM images of the BMPI- and FMPI-based films are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively, in which the local areas zoomed in ten times are shown. The FMPI perovskite film exhibits more uniform and larger crystalline grains, while the BMPI film shows heterogeneous grains with some visible pinholes. The formation of pinholes in the BMPI-based film could be attributed to the interaction between BDA2+ and DMF which will bring about defects when it is evaporated by thermal annealing. From the AFM images (Fig. 6c and d of BMPI and FMPI, respectively), the root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of BMPI and FMPI are determined to be 11.8 and 4.1 nm, respectively, suggesting the more compact morphology of the FMPI-based film.

The dark current–voltage (I–V) curves of the electron-only devices with the structure of glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Al were obtained to evaluate the trap densities of these perovskite films. The trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL), which is recognized as the cross point between the ohmic-conduction region and the trap-filling region, is associated with the trap density (Nt) by the following equation:45  where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the 2D perovskite (25 was used in this work),12 and L is the perovskite thickness (∼210 nm). As shown in Fig. S9b,† the VTFL decreases from 0.80 V for BMPI-based devices to 0.43 V for FMPI-based devices. By calculation, the electron trap density for the BMPI film was estimated to be 5.02 × 1016 cm−3, which is about 2 times that of the FMPI film (2.70 × 1016 cm−3). The reduced trap density for the FMPI film is in accordance with its less pinholes and more compact morphology as shown in the SEM image. Moreover, the decreased trap density will contribute to the enhanced carrier transport and suppressed charge recombination. In contrast, the traps in the BMPI film can act as the nonradiative recombination centers which have a harmful impact on the PCE as well as the device stability. Fitting the J–V curves by the Mott–Gurney law:46  where μ is the carrier mobility. As a result, the calculated electron mobilities are 6.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the FMPI film and the BMPI film, respectively. The increased mobility for the FMPI film is consistent with the reduced trap density which is in favor of the increased VOC and FF values for the FMPI-based PVSCs.

To study the effect of fluorination on the stability for the 2D DJ perovskite films, we monitored the XRD patterns of the FMPI and BMPI perovskite films stored under ambient conditions (in air, room temperature, 80 ± 5% RH). As shown in Fig. 7a, the aged BMPI film shows an increased PbI2 diffraction peak owing to the severe degradation. The intensity of the PbI2 diffraction peak exceeded the diffraction peak (011) for the BMPI perovskite film after 20 h. In contrast, the FMPI film did not show any obvious changes in the XRD patterns suggesting its superior moisture-resistance properties. The photos of the aged BMPI and FMPI films for the corresponding XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S10.† The improved storage stability of the FMPI film can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of fluorine atoms which is verified by the enlarged water contact angle (21° for BMPI and 37° for FMPI) as shown in the inserted images in Fig. 7a. The thermal stabilities (Fig. 7b) of PVSCs based on FMPI and BMPI were evaluated by placing both the devices at 80 °C under an ambient atmosphere without any encapsulation. The result demonstrates that the FMPI-based PVSC can retain more than 90% of its initial PCE after 40 h storage and 82% of its initial PCE after 100 h storage, which is ascribed to the strong interaction between the TFBDA ligands and the inorganic slabs. Whereas, the BMPI-based device only retain 63% of its initial PCE after 100 h storage. To further understand the storage stability of PVSCs, unencapsulated devices were stored and measured under 40–70% RH and at room temperature. Fig. 7c shows that the FMPI-based device can retain 93% of its initial efficiency after 1300 h storage, while the fluorine-free BMPI-based device can only retain 69% of its initial efficiency after the same time of storage. The improved stability for the the FMPI-based PVSC against heat and moisture can be attributed to the enhanced hydrophobicity, improved film quality, and strengthened crystallinity. Furthermore, the unencapsulated devices based on 3D MAPbI3 were also fabricated for the stability test. The stability results (Fig. S11†) show that the 3D PVSC can only retain 69% of its initial efficiency after 200 h storage under 40–70% RH and at room temperature suggesting its inferior stability compared to the devices based on 2D DJ perovskite films.

3. Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized a new fluorinated diammonium halide salt, (TFBDA)I2, for stable 2D DJ perovskites. The perovskite films based on TFBDA exhibited more compact morphology with less pinholes in comparison with that based on the nonfluorinated counterparts (BDA). Also, the TFBDA-based films showed a higher mobility and a lower trap density which are consistent with the decreased nonradiative recombination in comparison with the BDA-based films. Hence, the optimized PVSCs based on TFBDA showed a maximum PCE of 15.24%, which is higher than those based on BDA (9.16%). The unencapsulated PVSCs based on FMPI can retain 93% of its initial efficiency after storage in air with relative humidity of 40–70% after 1300 h, and retain more than 80% of its initial efficiency after thermal annealing at 80 °C for 100 h, suggesting significantly improved stability in comparison with the BDA-based counterparts. The improved stability for the devices based on the 2D DJ perovskite with the fluorinated benzene-derived spacer is in part attributed to enhanced hydrophobicity with the fluorine incorporation, and in part attributed to the intensified structure by the fluorination. Our results demonstrate an important strategy towards high-performance 2D PVSCs with improved stability by the incorporation of a fluorinated diammonium spacer.
