However, their low short-circuit current (JSC) values impede efforts at increasing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) levels. Maximizing the JSC is one of the critical elements for enabling high performances of OSCs. To improve the JSC of the non-fullerene ternary OSCs based on poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b:3,3-b]dithiophene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]]:3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (PTB7-Th:ITIC), a polymer of poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) was added to the binary system. The PCDTBT was shown to embed in both PTB7-Th and ITIC, and introduced dual Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) effects in the resulting ternary system. In addition, the PCDTBT may have decreased the molecular coherence lengths of PTB7-Th and ITIC and influenced the charge transport. Furthermore, the PCDTBT apparently also decreased the d-spacing of the π–π stacking of PTB7-Th and ITIC, which likely increased the intermolecular charge hopping efficiency. Doping an appropriate amount of PCDTBT in the system yielded an increase in the JSC from 13.89 to 16.71 mA cm−2. The increased JSC resulted in a 15% enhancement of the PCE, which indicated that introducing dual FRET effects is an effective way to enhance the JSC and thus the performance of the OSCs.
1. Introduction
Interest in renewable energy resources has been gaining momentum in an effort to alleviate the global demand for fossil fuels, whose availability is decreasing. The use of photovoltaics (PVs), which generate electricity directly from sunlight, is a promising solution to the energy crisis.1–3 Recently, in the area of organic photovoltaics, organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have garnered a lot of attention due to their advantages of being light-weight, inexpensive to manufacture, and flexible, and since they can be fabricated using roll-to-roll production.4,5 As a result of new materials that have been synthesized and used in organic solar cells (OSCs) and the unique device structure design of OSCs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) levels of these cells have exceeded 11%.6–9 But further improvement in the PCE is still required for future applications. However, most organic semiconductors have large band gaps, which result in relatively narrow absorption windows and hence limit the ability to improve the short-circuit current (JSC) of OSCs.10 To fulfill the requirements of broad spectrum absorption, OSC devices with various architectures have been fabricated.11–13 In particular, the ternary OSC architecture, for which an additional donor (or acceptor) is blended with a binary donor:acceptor blend, has been shown to yield increases in the spectral absorption range relative to that yielded by binary architectures, and ternary OSCs have also been shown to harvest sunlight efficiently. The additional component in the ternary blend system could tune the phase distribution, e.g., by forming an alloy with the donor, becoming embedded in the donor domains, or forming their own transmission channels.14–20,27 In addition, introducing the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect in ternary OSCs has been noted to be a productive way to enhance their JSC and PCE levels,30–32 which also indicates that the energy donor and energy acceptor that impart FRET effects are often p-type (donor) materials.
Ternary systems based on polymer:fullerene derivatives have been studied intensively and have achieved better performances than their binary polymer:fullerene counterparts.27 Recently, in addition to traditional fullerene derivatives,21–23,48 which have been used as electron acceptor materials but have shown weak absorption, poor stability and limited energy level variability, new non-fullerene acceptors have been synthesized and successfully applied in organic solar cells.6,24–26 However, there have been few studies of the nanomorphology and photophysics mechanisms of non-fullerene ternary systems, especially few of the distribution of the selected third component in the non-fullerene ternary blend. Third components that have crystallinity levels and molecular orientations similar to those of the non-fullerene acceptors may provide good compatibility and mutual solubility in fullerene-free ternary systems. In this case, the third components may be embedded or made to form an alloy with the non-fullerene acceptors. Such a system has not been mentioned in previous reports. Importantly, unlike the fullerene derivatives, the fullerene-free acceptor materials have strong absorption coefficients.25,26,49,50 Consequently, the non-fullerene acceptor can also act as additional energy acceptor in the FRET process, if the third components distribute around the acceptors.
In this work, non-fullerene ternary OSCs were fabricated with the low-bandgap polymer PTB7-Th, wide-bandgap polymer PCDTBT and molecular acceptor ITIC. Here, PCDTBT was embedded compatibly in both PTB7-Th and ITIC. Accordingly, dual FRET from PCDTBT to both PTB7-Th and ITIC was found to occur in the ternary blend. Moreover, doping appropriate amounts of PCDTBT in the ternary system enhanced the photocurrent. As a result, we were able to obtain ternary solar cells showing a PCE, at 7.51%, much higher than those of the binary counterparts.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and ITIC were purchased from 1-Material and used as received without further purification. PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and ITIC were mixed in various weight ratios, all following the relationship 1 − x:x:1.3, and dissolved in o-chlorobenzene to obtain 25 mg mL−1 solutions.
2.2 Material characterizations
Topography images were obtained using AFM in tapping mode (Solver P47 PRO, NTMDT Co.). The measured surface size was 5 μm × 5 μm. Absorption spectra of all films were acquired using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) dual beam spectrophotometer (TU-1900, PG Instruments, Ltd.). Steady-state PL data were collected by using a spectrometer (PG2000 Pro, Idea Optics Co. Ltd.) with an excitation wavelength of 500 nm. 2D time-resolved fluorescence decay dynamics was investigated by using a confocal optical microscope (Nanofinder FLEX2, Tokyo Instruments, Inc.) combined with a TCSPC module (Becker & Hickl, SPC-150).
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments were carried out at the BL16B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). For the GIWAXS experiments, the sample-to-detector distance was 245 mm, the wavelength of the incident X-rays was 0.124 nm, the incidence angle of the X rays was 0.12°, and the data were collected by a mar165CCD detector. For the GISAXS experiments, the sample-to-detector distance was 2050 mm, the wavelength of the incident X-rays was 0.124 nm, the incidence angle of the X rays was 0.3°, and the data were collected 50 s, also by using a mar165CCD detector. The samples used for the GIWAXS and GISAXS measurements were prepared by spin-coating the blend solutions onto Si wafers.
2.3 Fabrication and characterization of the non-fullerene ternary solar cells
An inverted structure, specifically ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PCDTBT:ITIC/MoO3/Ag, was used to fabricate the OSCs. The ITO substrates (15 Ω sq−1) with specific patterns were cleaned by subjecting the substrates to ultrasonic treatments in detergent, deionized water, acetone, absolute ethyl alcohol and isopropanol one after the other for 20 min each. The precursor solution of ZnO was prepared by dissolving 0.14 g of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) and 0.5 g of ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) in 5 mL of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH).28 The electron transport layers of ZnO (each with a thickness of ∼30 nm) were prepared by spin coating the ZnO precursor solution onto the ITO glasses at 3000 rpm for 50 s. Then the precursor-coated ITO substrates were baked in air at 200 °C for 40 min immediately. The ternary blend films (each with a thickness of ∼100 nm) were obtained from spin-casting the PTB7-Th:PCDTBT:ITIC blend solutions on ZnO-coated ITO substrates at a rotation speed of 1000 rpm. Finally, the hole transporting layer MoO3 (thickness of 7.5 nm) and Ag (thickness of 100 nm) cathodes were deposited on the active layers by carrying out thermal evaporation separately in a vacuum system with a base pressure of <1.5 × 10−6 Torr. All of the OSCs had the same effective area of 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm. J–V characteristics of the OSCs were measured under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (2400, Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) in air. All presented data were averages from more than twenty devices. EQE was characterized by using a QEX10 system (PV Measurement, Inc.) in air.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of PTB7-Th, ITIC and PCDTBT. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PTB7-Th, ITIC and PCDTBT are shown in Fig. 1b. The energy levels of PCDTBT were found not to match those of PTB7-Th and ITIC. Thus, the charge transfers from PCDTBT to PTB7-Th and ITIC were restricted. The normalized steady-state UV-Vis absorption spectra of the pure PTB7-Th, ITIC, and PCDTBT films and the emission spectrum of PCDTBT are shown in Fig. 1c. PTB7-Th absorbed light with wavelengths ranging from 500 to 775 nm, and with peaks in its spectrum at 643 nm and 710 nm. The 643 nm-wavelength peak was attributed to the molecular self-organization in the film.29 The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of ITIC showed a peak at 700 nm and a shoulder at about 647 nm. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of PCDTBT, like that of PTB7-Th, exhibited two peaks, but here at wavelengths of 400 nm and 580 nm. The emission of PCDTBT was found to strongly overlap the absorption of both PTB7-Th and ITIC, as shown in Fig. 1c with the yellow shaded area. This overlap indicated that most of the energy radiated by PCDTBT can transfer to both PTB7-Th and ITIC via FRET. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure PCDTBT and of mixtures including PCDTBT (20 wt% PCDTBT:PTB7-Th and 20 wt% PCDTBT:ITIC) were studied to verify the existence of dual FRET effects in the ternary system, as shown in Fig. 1d. The excitation wavelength of 500 nm was very weakly absorbed for both PTB7-Th and ITIC. The neat PCDTBT film showed a strong emission intensity at 703 nm. However, when 20 wt% of the energy donor PCDTBT was introduced to the energy acceptors PTB7-Th and ITIC, the PCDTBT emission peak disappeared, and photoluminescence peaks for PTB7-Th and ITIC appeared. The PL intensity of 20 wt% PCDTBT:PTB7-Th and 20 wt% PCDTBT:ITIC films was observed to be greater than the PL intensity of the PTB7-Th and ITIC neat films at the wavelength of PTB7-Th and ITIC fluorescence of PTB7-Th and ITIC fluorescence compared with the PL spectra of the PTB7-Th and ITIC neat films as shown in Fig. S1a.† The results demonstrated that the energy of light emitted from PCDTBT was transferred to PTB7-Th and ITIC, and then PTB7-Th and ITIC emitted light with a PL intensity greater than that of the PTB7-Th and ITIC reference films.30 A schematic diagram of the dual FRET processes is presented in the inset of Fig. 1d. The Förster radius R0 is the separation distance between the energy donor and energy acceptor when the efficiency of FRET is 50%. The radius R0 of the PCDTBT:PTB7-Th system was determined previously by us to be 7.7 nm.41 The radius of the PCDTBT:ITIC system was determined using eqn (1) to be 6.3 nm. (1)In eqn (1), κ is the orientation factor between donor and acceptor dipoles and a κ2 of 2/3 was used, QD is the donor PL quantum efficiency and a value of 0.309 was used, n is the refractive index and a value of 2 was used, FD is the donor emission spectrum, and εA is the molar extinction coefficient of the energy acceptor and a value of 1.3 × 105 m−1 cm−1 at 664 nm was used. Radii between 3 and 10 nm in the PCDTBT:PTB7-Th and PCDTBT:ITIC systems would allow FRET effects to occur in the ternary system.29,32,33,39,41

Previous reports30,31 verified that the FRET effect provides a non-radiative decay path for the excitons of donor materials in blend films, and such a decay path can decrease the lifetimes of excitons in energy donor materials. Time-resolved fluorescence imaging in the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) mode was used to study the fluorescence decay dynamics of pure PCDTBT, 20 wt% PCDTBT:PTB7-Th and 20 wt% PCDTBT:ITIC in order to provide additional evidence for the existence of the dual FRET effects in the ternary blend system.32,33 The 2D lifetime distribution of the neat PCDTBT film, with lifetimes between 320 to 365 ps, is shown in Fig. 2a (IRF ≈ 40 ps). The shortened fluorescence lifetime with a uniform distribution is shown in Fig. 2b and c. The exciton lifetimes of 20 wt% PCDTBT:PTB7-Th and 20 wt% PCDTBT:ITIC were found to be between 52 and 75 ps, and between 35 to 47 ps, respectively. This result can be seen as evidence of energy transfer from PCDTBT to PTBT-Th and ITIC.30 Their energy transfer efficiency (E) values were calculated using eqn (2). (2)In eqn (2), τDA is the fluorescence lifetime of the energy donor when the energy donor and energy acceptor are present in the system simultaneously, and τD is the lifetime of the energy donor. The lifetime curve of the pristine PCDTBT film was fitted with multi-exponential model I(t) = A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2 + A3e−t/τ3 and yielded an average lifetime of 359.1 ps. However, the steady-state lifetimes of PTB7-Th and ITIC blended with 20 wt% PCDTBT were determined to be 59.1 and 41.1 ps. Based on the data shown in the inset of Fig. 2a2–c2, the efficiency levels of FRET from PCDTBT to PTB7-Th and ITIC were determined to be 83.6% and 88.6%, respectively.

The absorption spectra of ternary blend films PTB7-Th:PCDTBT:ITIC with various concentrations of PCDTBT are shown in Fig. S1b.† Enhanced absorption, especially at about 400 nm, was observed when PCDTBT was doped into the ternary blend films. Importantly, absorption spectra can reflect both intrachain and interchain interactions. Typically, molecular aggregation includes H-type (face-to-face) and J-type (head-to-tail) aggregations.34,35 However, the 0–0 electronic transition is symmetry forbidden for H-type aggregation, while it is allowed for the J type.36 The absorption spectra of the ternary blend films showed that the value of I0–0/I0–1 increased as the doping ratio was increased. This result indicated the formation of J-type aggregation as more PCDTBT was included in the ternary films, which implied decreased intermolecular interaction and thus shortened coherence lengths of PTB7-Th and ITIC.
GIWAXS experiments were carried out to study the crystallinity and molecular orientation systematically. The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns of pristine films and the corresponding profiles of the in-plane and out-of-plane directions are shown in Fig. S2.† All of the PTB7-Th, ITIC and PCDTBT neat films showed clear (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction at qZ = 1.61, 1.54 and 1.55 Å−1, respectively. None of the films showed obvious (010) diffraction peak in the in-plane direction. The results indicated that all of the materials have a preferential face-on orientation, which favors charge transport in vertical structure devices.37,38 In addition, the face-on orientation of PTB7-Th, ITIC and PCDTBT can ensure the compatibility between the materials in the ternary blend. Based on the qZ values, the π–π stacking distances for PTB7-Th, ITIC and PCDTBT were determined to be 3.90, 4.08 and 4.05 Å, respectively, as shown in Table S1.† The PTB7-Th:PCDTBT and ITIC:PCDTBT binary films were also studied using GIWAXS. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding in-plane and out-of-plane profiles of the binary films are presented in Fig. 3. PTB7-Th and ITIC films with different weight ratios of PCDTBT also showed obvious (010) π–π stacking peaks in the out-of-plane direction. As the doping concentration was increased, the π–π stacking intensity decreased, indicating that the PCDTBT can reduce the coherence lengths of PTB7-Th and ITIC and therefore affect the charge transport to some extent. The variation of peak position and the corresponding d-spacing are shown in Table S2.† However, as the doping ratio was increased, the π–π stacking peaks shifted to higher q and the corresponding d-spacings became smaller. This decrease can facilitate electron hopping and thus neutralize the disadvantage resulting from the shortened coherence lengths. Therefore, the overall charge transfer capacity was slightly affected. More importantly, the (100) peak of PCDTBT (ca. 0.42 Å−1) appeared neither in the PTB7-Th:PCDTBT profile nor the ITIC:PCDTBT profile. According to previous reports,17,39 this result may have meant that PCDTBT was distributed in the domains of PTB7-Th and ITIC, and this distribution may have also caused the reduced d-spacing. Similar results were obtained for the ternary blend films, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5a, with the details presented in Table S1.† When 40% weight of PCDTBT was doped into the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend, the d-spacing of the resulting film was reduced from 4.05 Å to 3.61 Å, which enhanced the charge carrier hopping ability in the blend films. We can also propose that the PCDTBT molecules embedded into both PTB7-Th and ITIC at the same time.

The influence of the PCDTBT on the surface morphology of the ternary blend films was studied by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 5b and c. A mean-square surface roughness (Rq) distribution image of the ternary films is shown in Fig. S5.† After blended with 20 wt% PCDTBT, the surface of PTB7-Th:ITIC film became much smoother (Rq = 14.6 nm for the binary film, Rq = 11.1 nm for the ternary film) due to better mixing of PTB7-Th, ITIC and PCDTBT, where pronounced dual FRET effects could be generated.
The domain sizes of neat films, binary films and ternary films were characterized by using grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). Fig. S4† shows the 2D GISAXS patterns of neat PTB7-Th, PCDTBT and ITIC films and the ternary blend films with different PCDTBT doping ratios. The 2D GISAXS patterns of the PTB7-Th and ITIC films doped with different amounts of PCDTBT and the corresponding in-plane profiles of the films are shown in Fig. 6. Because of the different electron density levels of these materials, the low-q intensities of PTB7-Th and ITIC were much greater than that of PCDTBT, as shown in Fig. S4d.†40 For the various weight percents of PCDTBT doped into the neat PTB7-Th, ITIC and PTB7-Th:ITIC systems, obvious decreases in intensity as q was increased in the low-q region (0.004–0.017 Å−1) were observed in the profiles, as shown in Fig. 6g and h. Similar results were obtained in the ternary blend (Fig. 7e). According to previous studies,40,42,43 the decreases in intensity in the low-q region were caused by the PCDTBT being dispersed in the PTB7-Th and ITIC matrixes. These results were consistent with the GIWAXS results. Therefore, PCDTBT was confirmed to be embedded in both PTB7-Th and ITIC in the ternary system. A Guinier approximation was used to quantitatively calculate the radius of gyration (Rg) of the clusters of donors and acceptors in the ternary blends. Eqn (3) was used to calculate Rg. (3)In this equation, Q, which is qxy in Fig. 7f, is obtained from the equation Q = 4πsin(θ/2)/λ where θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of incidence light, I(Q) is the scattering intensity at Q, and I(0) is the zero-angle scattering intensity.40 Each of the in-plane profiles was fitted with two slopes in the low-q region (0.004–0.017 Å−1). Therefore, two values of Rg, denoted as Rg1 and Rg2, were calculated from the slopes and then averaged to obtain the aggregation size. The detailed data are shown in the inset of Fig. 7f. The matrices were observed to be approximately cubic structures (with a = Rg). The domain size in the binary film was 27.3 nm. When 10 wt%-30 wt% of PCDTBT was doped into the film, the size of the domain increased slightly, from 27.3 nm to 30.1 nm, but when 40 wt% was doped, the domain size decreased to 25.7 nm. Too much PCDTBT (40 wt%) may have destroyed the ordered arrangement of donors and acceptors in the ternary films.

Ternary OSCs with various weight ratios of PCDTBT were fabricated, each with an inverted structure, to verify the influence of dual FRET effects on the performance of OSCs. The device structure and the molecular stacking model are shown in Fig. 8a. The current-density versus voltage (J–V) curves and corresponding data are shown in Fig. 8b and Table 1, respectively. The PCE of the control device (0 wt% PCDTBT) was determined to be 6.51%, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.83 V, a JSC of 13.89 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 56.72%. The incorporation of PCDTBT led to composition-dependent changes of VOC (Fig. 8d) and FF, and an obvious enhancement in JSC (Fig. 8e). The composition-dependent changes of VOC also provided additional evidence that PCDTBT was embedded in PTB7-Th and ITIC.17,44,45 As more PCDTBT was doped, the FF decreased to various extents. Upon doping just a moderate relative amount of PCDTBT (0–20 wt%), the FF slightly decreased, and the small magnitude of this decrease was attributed to a balance between the decreased charge transport and the increased charge hopping ability. Too much doped PCDTBT (30–40 wt%) apparently seriously damaged the ordered arrangement between the donor and acceptor and therefore decreased the performance of the OSCs. However, the JSC of the device with PCDTBT was obviously better than that of the control device. Thus, the increased JSC apparently compensated for the loss of FF. The highest PCE was obtained when doping 20 wt% PCDTBT, and here the average PCE of the ternary OSCs was 7.51%, with VOC, JSC and FF values of 0.80 V, 16.71 mA cm−2 and 55.91%, respectively. The increased JSC contributed to the dual FRET effects, which apparently increased the photon utilization efficiency. An improvement of the JSC in the non-fullerene ternary blend system was also indicated by the EQE spectra, as shown in Fig. 8c. The enhancements of EQE between 350 nm and 450 nm, and between 500 nm and 600 nm, were attributed to the incorporation of PCDTBT introducing the dual FRET effects.41

In many ternary systems, charge transfer and energy transfer processes simultaneously exist in the ternary blend, and are difficult to distinguish.27 OSCs were fabricated using the PCDTBT:ITIC (1:1.3) and PCDTBT:PTB7-Th (1:1) binary systems in order to identify the FRET effect. A JSC of 2.15 mA cm−2 was obtained for the PCDTBT:ITIC-based OSC, as shown in Fig. S5a and Table S3.† As seen in the band alignment diagram in Fig. 1d, the LUMO level of ITIC was determined to be below the LUMO of PCDTBT, while the HOMO level of ITIC was determined to be higher than the HOMO of PCDTBT. Therefore, ITIC may have been accepting both electrons and holes from PCDTBT, and was thus serving as a center of charge recombination. Based on these results and previous discussions, it can be concluded that the photocurrent was mostly generated from the FRET and partially from the charge transfer in the PCDTBT:ITIC system. The EQE in Fig. S5b† also supported this mechanism. The EQE was observed to be high between 350 nm and 650 nm, consistent with the absorption spectra of PCDTBT, but very low in the absorption range of ITIC. The JSC of the OSC based on PCDTBT:PTB7-Th was determined to be 0.12 mA cm−2, and this result was due its low charge transport ability. However, its EQE curve and that of PCDTBT:ITIC were found to be very similar, which also confirmed that the increased JSC was induced by FRET effects.
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole mobility of the ternary OSCs. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th: PCDTBT:ITIC/MoO3/Ag. The Mott–Gurney law was used to describe the SCLC, as shown in eqn (4). (4)In this equation, εr is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, μ is the mobility of the charge carrier, V is the voltage drop across the device obtained from V = Vappl − Vbi (where Vappl is the applied voltage and Vbi is the built-in voltage, which was estimated to be 0.1 V), and L (≈100 nm) is the thickness of the active layer. The typical value of εr is 3 for polymers.46,47 The J–V curves of the hole-only devices with various percents of PCDTBT doped are shown in Fig. S7.† With an appropriate amount of PCDTBT, the hole mobility of the ternary blends changed slightly. With 40 wt% PCDTBT doped, the hole mobility decreased from 2.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was caused by the low degree of face-on π–π stacking intensity as mentioned above when describing the GIWAXS results.
4. Conclusion
A remarkable enhancement in JSC and PCE due to dual FRET effects in a non-fullerene ternary OSC with the third component embedded in both the donor and acceptor has been successfully demonstrated. The introduced PCDTBT may have decreased the molecular coherence lengths of PTB7-Th and ITIC. Furthermore, the PCDTBT apparently also increased the charge hopping efficiency by decreasing the d-spacing of the π–π stacking. As a result, the JSC and PCE in the optimized PTB7-Th: PCDTBT:ITIC ternary system showed values of 16.71 mA cm−2 and 7.51%, respectively, in contrast to the 13.89 mA cm−2 and 6.51% values for PTB7-Th:ITIC. This finding revealed an effective method to improve the JSC of non-fullerene ternary organic solar cells.
