    , Accepted 25th October 2013First published on 25th October 2013AbstractMesoporous anatase TiO2 beads of 830 ± 40 nm in diameter were employed as the working electrode in flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The beads were pre-sintered at different temperatures to produce good chemical connection between the TiO2 nanoparticles within the beads. Working electrode films were produced by isostatic pressing of the pre-sintered beads on flexible ITO/PEN substrates. The effect of different pressures and pre-sintering temperatures for the beads on the performance of the devices was investigated. The mechanical pressure improved the connection between the beads; but when too high a pressure was applied, the beads were crushed, resulting in a decrease in the electron diffusion coefficient and the light scattering effect. Higher sintering temperatures connected the TiO2 particles within the beads better but decreased the surface area. The optimized flexible device configuration used 650 °C sintered beads as a scattering layer, achieving an efficiency of 7.43%.
1. Introduction
Due to increasing demands for energy and our concern for the environment, clean and renewable energy sources, especially solar energy, have attracted great interest. Solar cells can convert solar energy to electrical energy. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is one type of solar cell with a low materials cost and easy fabrication.1,2 Plastic substrate based DSSCs have merits, such as being light weight, easy to handle and transport, simple to fabricate and less bulk as they are thin and flexible.3–5 Therefore, they have attracted a lot of interest.6–10 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of flexible DSSCs is still quite low compared to the glass substrate based counterparts.11–13 There are several constraints limiting the efficiency of flexible DSSCs, mainly resulting from the restriction of low temperature processes (∼150 °C) due to the plastic substrate: (a) poor connections between TiO2 particles in the working electrode,14 (b) difficulty in applying a stable top scattering layer consisting of large TiO2 particles, and (c) lack of TiCl4 post-treatment. These three points have proven successful for increasing the PCE of glass substrate based DSSCs.15,16
The poor interconnection between TiO2 nanoparticles is the major obstacle for the plastic-substrate based DSSC. Without the high temperature sintering process chemical bonding between TiO2 nanoparticles is limited, which results in a slow electron transport rate in the electrode. Some chemical treatments have been employed to induce “chemical sintering”, but the results are still far from satisfactory.17 A more practical way is to apply mechanical pressure to enhance the physical contact between particles to minimize the interparticle electron transport barrier.18–20 In order to improve the photocurrent, a top scattering layer is normally applied for the glass-substrate based DSSC to increase the light harvesting.21 However, due to poor connection between the large particles, the scattering layer is not applicable without high temperature sintering. Alternatively, Nakayama et al. used TiO2 nanotubes as a top scattering layer,22 while Yamaguchi et al. mixed large particles as scattering centers with the small TiO2 nanoparticles in the working electrode.19 However, the presence of large particles compromises the overall surface area of TiO2 in the film.
Here we employed the dual-function submicrometer-sized mesoporous TiO2 beads to make working electrode films on plastic substrates. The large size of the beads can effectively scatter the light in the wavelength range of 600–800 nm. Therefore, the role of these beads can be equivalent to that of scattering centers or a top scattering layer. The advantage of using the beads for scattering is that the beads are comprised of 18 nm TiO2 crystals, hence having a high surface area of 89.1 ± 0.5 m2 g−1.23 Another important advantage of using the beads is that the beads can be pre-sintered at temperatures above 500 °C. Through the pre-sintering process, the chemical connection between the nanoparticles inside the beads is improved, thereby providing enhanced electron diffusion in the film.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Effects of mechanical pressure
To study the effect of pressure during the film fabrication, mesoporous TiO2 beads that were sintered at 500 °C were used.23 When the beads were made into a film, they were loosely packed and the connection between the beads was quite weak. Because the plastic substrate cannot withstand a high temperature treatment, TiO2 films on plastic substrates can be subjected to mechanical pressure to improve the connections between TiO2 nanoparticles.24 In this work, a cold isostatic pressing (CIP) technique was used to compress the TiO2 films.25 When pressure was applied to the film, its structure becomes much denser.

Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the pressure applied during CIP and the shrinkage of the TiO2 bead films and the final film thickness. When the applied pressure increases, the film is compacted. A linear relationship between the pressure and the shrinkage was observed up to about 100 MPa. Approximately 50% compaction can be achieved by the CIP process. A further increase in the pressure beyond 100 MPa resulted in very little change in the shrinkage and film thickness.

SEM images of the un-pressed and pressed films are shown in Fig. 2. Before pressing, individual beads were clearly identified in the film (Fig. 2a). After applying low pressures (25 MPa, Fig. 2b and 50 MPa, Fig. 2c), the shape of the beads remained basically unchanged. This indicates that the TiO2 particle connections within the beads have achieved a certain degree of strength after the sintering at 500 °C. Therefore, applying pressures up to 50 MPa would pack the beads more closely and densely through bead rearrangement, resulting in reduction of film thickness. When the applied pressure was increased to 75 MPa, the beads started to break (Fig. 2d). Further increasing the applied pressure to 100 MPa (Fig. 2e) meant more beads were damaged but the shape of the beads was still identifiable and the film became much denser. At 200 MPa, the beads were almost fully crushed, as shown in Fig. 2f. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the pressed films (Fig. 3) showed a decrease in the scattering effect of the bead films with increasing applied pressure. The film pressed at 200 MPa was almost transparent.

These films were then assembled as electrodes into DSSC devices with a sputter coated Pt-PEN counter electrode. Table 1 lists the photovoltaic characteristics of the prepared DSSCs. The PCE increased with applied pressure until 75 MPa and then decreased at 100 MPa, mainly due to the change of the photocurrent as shown in Table 1. Fig. 4 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of these devices. Normally, the integration of IPCE with AM 1.5 standard solar spectrum can give the value of photocurrent. From Fig. 4, the IPCE of the 25 MPa device is much lower than that of 75 MPa and 200 MPa devices between 400 and 600 nm. As these electrodes initially had the same thickness, the electrodes should have similar surface area despite the different pressures applied. Thus the electrodes should have a similar dye loading. The lower IPCE should be primarily due to the poor charge collection. As the beads had been sintered at 500 °C, the connection between TiO2 particles within the beads would be good. The problem is due to the connections between the bead entities. The small contact between beads was the bottle neck of electron transport even in a high temperature sintered film.25 At the low pressure (25 MPa), the bead structure was maintained, but the connections between beads were weak. When increasing the applied pressure, the connections between the beads become better. For the films prepared at higher pressure (≥50 MPa), better connections were established between the beads. This was confirmed by an improved electron diffusion coefficient (De) calculated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,26,27 as shown in Table 1. The electron diffusion coefficient in the 25 MPa pressed electrode is almost one order of magnitude slower than that in the 75 MPa electrode. Hence this accounts for the much lower photocurrent of the 25 MPa pressed electrode (10.24 mA cm−2) compared to the 75 MPa pressed electrode (12.67 mA cm−2). However, when the applied pressure was increased to above 100 MPa, many of the beads were destroyed (Fig. 2e and f). The connection between the scattered TiO2 nanoparticles was much weaker than what had existed inside the beads, thus causing the slower electron diffusion. While further increasing the pressure, the film became much denser and each particle had more coordinated particles to allow the electron transport. Therefore the electron diffusion coefficient of the 200 MPa electrode is higher than that of 100 MPa electrode. From the IPCE spectra (Fig. 4), both electrodes gave similar conversion efficiencies in the short wavelength range (<500 nm). However, beyond 500 nm, the 75 MPa electrode had a higher IPCE value than the 200 MPa electrode. This is not surprising as the reflectance spectra (Fig. 3) showed the 75 MPa pressed device had a much stronger scattering effect at long wavelengths. The scattering effect from un-broken beads gave the 75 MPa electrode a higher photocurrent than the 200 MPa electrode.

2.2. Effect of pre-sintering temperature
Composed of nanocrystalline TiO2, the beads are an ideal candidate for flexible DSSCs as they can be pre-sintered before being constructed into electrodes on plastic substrates. A major limitation of DSSCs on plastics is that only low temperature processes can be used due to the polymer substrate, thus weaker physical bonding exists between the TiO2 nanocrystals compared with the high temperature sintering process generally used for devices constructed on glass. Pre-sintering of the beads can be carried out at a temperature that is desirable for the solar cell application without restrictions imposed by substrates. The sintered beads are pre-fabricated building blocks in the subsequent solar cell fabrication. Different sintering temperatures (500, 550, 600, 650, and 700 °C) were selected in order to identify the optimum. In general, a higher sintering temperature would result in stronger connections between TiO2 nanoparticles and hence better mechanical strength of the beads. However, high temperature sintering would reduce the overall surface area of the beads. Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of the beads pre-sintered at different temperature then pressed at the same applied pressure (100 MPa). The beads sintered at low temperatures (500 and 550 °C) were almost fully crushed at this pressure, while for the beads sintered at higher temperatures (600 and 650 °C) the spherical shape was partially retained. But the same pressure did not damage the beads sintered at 700 °C. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the films fabricated using beads sintered at 500 and 650 °C are shown in Fig. 6. The film of beads pre-sintered at 650 °C had a much stronger scattering effect than the film of beads pre-sintered at 500 °C.

Table 2 lists the photovoltaic characteristics of the electrodes made from the beads pre-sintered at different temperatures and pressed under the same pressure, 100 MPa. By increasing the pre-sintering temperature, the photocurrent gradually increased from 12.27 to 13.24 mA cm−2. This is due to the fast electron diffusion coefficient (shown in Table 2), which resulted from the high temperature sintering and also the enhanced scattering effect (shown in Fig. 6). However, for the beads pre-sintered at 700 °C, the photocurrent dropped to 7.61 mA cm−2. The main reason for this is the very low surface area of the 700 °C pre-sintered beads (28.3 m2 g−1) compared to the others (61.1, 75.2, 82.1, 89.1 m2 g−1 for 650 °C, 600 °C, 550 °C and 500 °C pre-sintered beads, respectively). The high temperature sintering process improved interconnection between the nanoparticles, but decreased the overall surface area. Overall, the device containing 650 °C pre-sintered beads gave the best performance due to the relatively high surface area and fast electron diffusion. Table 3 summarizes the PCEs of the devices made from beads pre-sintered at different temperatures and then pressed under different pressures. In general, increasing the pressure can improve the device performance by improving the necking between beads, but when the applied pressure is too high, it damaged the beads and thus decreased the device performance. Beads sintered at higher temperatures can withstand higher applied pressure and therefore, achieve a higher PCE.

In order to further improve the performance of the device and fully explore the advantages of the dual-function of the beads, the beads were used as a top scattering layer. First, a 5 μm film of the beads pre-sintered at 500 °C was coated on the conductive plastic substrate, and then another 10 μm layer of the beads pre-sintered at 650 °C was coated on top of it. A pressure of 100 MPa was applied to this bilayer film. The 500 °C pre-sintered beads became a transparent layer, while the 650 °C pre-sintered beads formed a scattering layer, according to the respective reflectance spectra (Fig. 6). This bilayer structure achieved a much higher photocurrent of 14.07 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 7a. The improvement in the photocurrent is attributed to the enhancement in the light scattering. As observed in Fig. 7b, the IPCE of the bilayer device showed much higher values in the range of 530–780 nm than the 500 °C pre-sintered beads. The bilayer device achieved an efficiency of 7.43%.

3. Conclusions
The submicrometer-sized mesoporous TiO2 beads were used to form the working electrode in flexible DSSCs. The pre-sintered beads had good connections between TiO2 nanoparticles within the beads, facilitating easy electron diffusion. The high pressure applied to the film improved connections between the beads, despite some damage to the bead structure. This approach produced much improved working electrodes for DSSCs constructed on plastic substrates. With this technique, over 6% conversion efficiency was readily achieved for flexible devices on plastics. With a dual-layer structure derived from the beads pre-sintered at 500 and 650 °C, a PCE of 7.43% was achieved.
4. Experimental
4.1. Synthesis of submicrometer-sized mesoporous anatase beads
The building blocks (mesoporous TiO2 beads) were synthesized according to our previous paper with a modified recipe.23 In brief, 7.95 g HDA was dissolved in 800 mL ethanol. To this solution, 3.20 mL KCl solution (0.1 M) was added, and then 18.10 mL titanium(IV) isopropoxide was added under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature. After 18 h undisturbed settling, the amorphous TiO2 beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol three times. Then 1.6 g of the air-dried amorphous TiO2 beads, 20 mL ethanol, 9 mL Milli-Q water and 1.0 mL ammonia (25 wt%) were mixed together and solvothermally treated at 160 °C for 16 h to induce crystallization. Finally, the beads were calcined at 500 °C (or 550, 600, 650, and 700 °C for the pre-sintering temperature study) for 2 h in air to remove the residue organic compounds.
4.2. Film fabrication
25 wt % calcined beads were dispersed in ethanol and then the suspension was sonicated for 30 min. Using this slurry, the film was coated on the ITO-PEN (indium doped tin oxide coated polyethylene naphthalate, Peccell Technologies, Japan) via a doctor-blade technique. The films were then pressed via a cold isostatic press (CIP)28,29 at pressures between 50 and 200 MPa.
4.3. Cell assembling
The films were soaked in a 0.3 mM N719 tert-butanol:acetonitrile (1:1, by volume) solution for 18 h. The dye-sensitized working electrodes on the ITO-PEN substrate were rinsed with acetonitrile and dried under N2 flow, then sandwiched with a Pt-sputtered ITO-PEN counter electrode. A 25 μm thick piece of surlyn (DuPont) was used as a spacer. The electrolyte, comprising 0.4 M LiI, 0.4 M tetrabutylammonium iodide, 0.04 M I2, 0.3 M N-methylbenzimidazole in a mixture of acetonitrile and 3-methoxypropionitrile (1:1, by volume) was injected into the cell. The cell was put into a jig with screws to tighten the device avoiding leakage of electrolyte during testing.
4.4. Characterization
The morphology of the pressed films was examined by a field emission Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL 7001F). Diffuse reflectance spectra of the TiO2 films were collected on a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Internal DRA-2500). I–V curves of the DSSCs were obtained by using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under illumination of simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) provided by an Oriel solar simulator with an AM1.5 filter. Black metal with a circular aperture (4.5 mm in diameter) was put on top of the device during photovoltaic testing. IPCE spectra were recorded on a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp with an Oriel Cornerstone™ 260 1/4 m monochromator. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSSCs were recorded on a potentiostat (BioLogic VSP) with a frequency range of 0.05–105 Hz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. The EIS measurements were carried out under AM 1.5 solar radiation with a voltage bias of Voc.
