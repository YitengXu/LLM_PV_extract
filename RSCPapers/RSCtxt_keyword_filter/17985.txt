    , Accepted 27th November 2015First published on 27th November 2015AbstractA structurally non-planar molecule (SBF-PDI4) with a 9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (SBF) core and four perylenediimides (PDIs) at the periphery was designed, synthesized and characterized. This compound shows a low-lying LUMO energy level of −4.11 eV, which is similar to that of PCBM, but with intensive light absorption ability in the range 450–550 nm. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.34% was obtained for a solution processed bulk heterojunction solar cell (BHJSC) using SBF-PDI4 as the electron acceptor and a low-band gap polymer poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th) as the electron donor. These results demonstrate that PDI derivatives with a three dimensional molecular structure could serve as high performance electron acceptors in BHJSCs.
Solution-processed polymer bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) have received intensive attention because of their unique advantages such as low cost, light weight, ease of fabrication by large-scale, roll-to-roll printing techniques, and feasibility of flexible devices.1–3 Very recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 10–11% have been achieved for single-junction polymer/fullerene based solar cells.4–7 Although fullerene derivatives with unique phase separation properties and multidimensional charge transporting capabilities played a central role as electron acceptors in BHJ PSCs, drawbacks including weak absorption of visible light, poor chemical and electronic tunability, tedious purification and high production costs cannot be ignored. Moreover, despite the successes in laboratory scale devices, fullerenes are not an ideal material for production on an industrial scale. In contrast, non-fullerene acceptors in OSCs devices can avoid the drawbacks of fullerenes to some extent. Recently, solution-processed polymer/polymer8,9 and polymer/small molecule10–12 BHJ-OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors have shown PCEs of up to 5–8%.13,14 However, non-fullerene acceptors still lag behind fullerene derivatives, and new design routes for developing high performance non-fullerene acceptors are still highly needed.
Among the non-fullerene acceptors exploited so far for organic solar cells, perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives are the most frequently explored ones due to their excellent optical and electric properties, such as strong light absorption in the visible region between 400 nm and 650 nm, low-lying LUMO levels (about −4.0 eV), high electron mobilities (101–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), simplicity of the synthesis and purification processes, as well as chemical, thermal, and environmental robustness.15 In the early stages, PDI derivatives for use in OSCs typically possess a planar molecular structure, and large crystalline domains (around 1 μm in size) are usually formed in the donor–acceptor blended film, which generally leads to poor photovoltaic performance.16 To reduce the aggregation tendency of PDI-based small molecules, alkyl chains have been introduced into the bay or the “N” position of the PDI. However, not much improvement was achieved in such a molecular modification method.15 Very recently, twisted PDI-dimers by linking two PDI units with various spacers, such as C–C single bond,17 vinyl,18 thiophene,19 selenophene,20 benzene,19 biphenyl,21 or spirofluorene19,22 have been developed. Such a twisted molecular structure effectively reduces the intermolecular interactions and thus hinders molecular aggregations. The performance of OSCs based on these materials was consequently improved.
With the knowledge that conjugated molecules with a three dimensional structure might form solid films with isotropic charge transport ability, the development of new electron acceptor materials with 3D molecular structures has become an emerging topic. For example, Jenekhe and co-workers recently reported the development of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors with a 3D architecture.23 Zhan et al. have reported a novel acceptor with triphenylamine as the core that has a quasi-3D nonplanar structure to reach a PCE of 3.32%.24 Yan and Chen et al. also reported a series of 3D structure novel small molecular acceptors based on tetraphenylethylene,21 tetraphenylmethane,25 tetraphenylsilane,25,26 and tetraphenylgermane25 cores, enabling efficient polymer solar cells with a PCE of up to 5.53%.
It is known that 9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (SBF) is a well-developed spiro-molecule with an orthogonal molecular structure, where two planar fluorene units are connected through a spiro-sp3 carbon. This rigid and orthogonal core unit could serve as an excellent building block for constructing novel 3D molecules. In addition, a better solubility and less intensive intermolecular interaction of the final molecules would be expected for its nonplanar molecular structure.27 However, only a few PDI derivatives based on this well-known spiro-core were reported in the literature.19,22 In this communication, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel 3D PDI acceptor (SBF-PDI4, Scheme 1) with a 9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] core. A promising PCE of 5.34% was obtained by using a narrow-bandgap polymer material poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno [3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th) (Chart S1, ESI†) as the donor. During the revision of this article, Cho et al. also reported the synthesis and use of a spirobifluorene core-PDI derivative as the electron acceptor in organic solar cells.28 These results suggest that structurally orthogonal PDI derivatives could serve as high performance electron acceptors in organic solar cells.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to SBF-PDI4. 
The synthetic route to SBF-PDI4 is outlined in Scheme 1. The target product SBF-PDI4 was synthesized in a medium yield of 65% by a Suzuki coupling of Br-PDI with SBF-Bpin4, which was synthesized by palladium catalysed borylation.29 This new compound was fully characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS spectroscopy (ESI†). SBF-PDI4 showed a higher solubility in chloroform, dichloromethane, dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene compared to the corresponding linear analogue PDI-F-PDI (Scheme S1, ESI†), which was attributed to the non-planar molecular structure of SBF-PDI4.
The geometries of SBF-PDI4 and PDI-F-PDI were optimized using the Gaussian09 program using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) approach. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), in PDI-F-PDI, the dihedral between the PDI plane and the fluorene plane is 122.5 degrees, while in SBF-PDI4, due to the steric repulsion between PDI rings, the PDI rings align almost vertically (83.7 degrees) to the adjacent fluorene plane (Fig. S1, left; ESI†). The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) diagrams of SBF-PDI4 and PDI-F-PDI are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). According to the calculated results, the FMOs of SBF-PDI4 and PDI-F-PDI consist mainly of the molecular orbitals from the PDI rings. Since there are four PDI rings in SBF-PDI4 and only two PDI rings in PDI-F-PDI, the HOMOs and LUMOs of SBF-PDI4 are quasi quadra-degenerated, while those of PDI-F-PDI are quasi double-degenerated.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of SBF-PDI4 in chloroform solution and in a thin film are presented in Fig. 1(a), and their corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of SBF-PDI4 in solution exhibit a strong absorption band in the range 450–550 nm with a peak absorption at 535 nm. The molecular mole extinction coefficient was determined to be 93300 mol−1 L cm−1. The absorption maximum of SBF-PDI4 in the thin solid film shows a 10 nm red-shift when compared to that in solution (Fig. 1(a) and Table 1). A broader absorption with a similar profile was found for the solid film absorption, suggesting weak intermolecular interactions in the solid film. The optical band gap calculated from the absorption onset wavelength (λflimonset) was 2.03 eV for SBF-PDI4 which is similar to those of other PDI based acceptor materials.21,26

Electrochemical characterization of SBF-PDI4 was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solution. The cyclic voltammogram and differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) are shown in Fig. 1(b), and the relevant data are compiled in Table 1. As can be seen from Fig. 1(b), SBF-PDI4 exhibits quasi-reversible redox processed both in the positive and negative potential range. The measured oxidation potentials were ascribed to the oxidation processes of the spirobifluorene core,30 whereas the reduction potentials were related to the reduction of the PDI units.24,30 Using DPV measurements the two oxidation potentials (vs. Fc+/Fc) were determined to be 1.21 and 1.39 V, respectively. Three reduction processes (E0red = −1.02, −1.16 and −1.29 V) were determined from the DPV measurements, which is different from that of the PDI monomers,31 suggesting possible intramolecular interaction between the four peripheral PDI units. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of SBF-PDI4 were calculated according to the following equations: ELUMO = −(Eonsetred + 5.10) [eV] and EHOMO = −(Eonsetox + 5.10) [eV], where the standard energy level for Fc/Fc+ was taken to be −5.10 eV.32 The HOMO/LUMO energy level data are also listed in Table 2. As can be seen from this table, the LUMO energy level of SBF-PDI4 (−4.11 eV) is slightly lower than that of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, −4.01 eV), indicating that SBF-PDI4 could serve as an electron acceptor in organic solar cells.

Organic solar cells with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO (20 nm)/active layer (∼100 nm)/MoO3 (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated using the blended films of PTB7-Th:SBF-PDI4 as the photoactive layers. The donor to acceptor ratio (D/A) was optimized using chloroform as the processing solvent, and the results show that the best D/A ratio is 1:1 (w/w) (see Table S1, ESI†). Then, the influence of additive of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) on the performance of PTB7-Th:SBF-PDI4 cells was carefully examined. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the OSC devices with different D/A ratios and additive amounts are listed in Table 2 and Table S1 (ESI†). All the PTB7-Th:SBF-PDI4 based devices worked without the use of any co-solvents, and gave well-reproducible performances. The best PCE obtained was 3.66% with an open voltage VOC = 0.86 V, short current density JSC = 8.82 mA cm−2, and fill factor FF = 0.48. Surprisingly, the VOC of 0.86 V was found to be higher than the value for PTB7-Th:PC61BM based devices (VOC = 0.79 V), although the LUMO of SBF-PDI4 was lower than that of PC61BM. There are many factors that influence the VOC of solar cells,34 so it is rather difficult to explain the exact reason for the high VOC of the SBF-PDI4 based device. However, since these two compounds have totally different molecular structures, the higher VOC of PTB7-Th:SBF-PDI4 based device could be due to the 3D-molecular structure of SBF-PDI4 which leads to a higher Fermi energy level (EF) of SBF-PDI4 in the solid state. On the basis of the optimal D/A ratio, the effect of additive (CN) content on the performance of the PTB7-Th:SBF-PDI4 based devices was investigated. As a result, the average PCE increased continuously, which was mainly attributed to the higher JSC than without any additive when CN was added (see Table S1, ESI†). The JSC increased dramatically from 8.82 mA cm−2 to 13.08 mA cm−2, while the VOC has little decrease from 0.86 V to 0.85 V and the FFs are essentially constant. The highest efficiency devices were fabricated using 1.0% (v/v) CN as the additive, showing the best PCE of 5.34% and an average PCE of 5.26%. As a comparison, the linear molecular PDI-F-PDI based device showed a best PCE of 3.97% (ESI†), which is much lower than that of SBF-PDI4 based devices. Fig. 2(b) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal cells. The EQE responses cover a wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm, and these responses correspond well to the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the corresponding 1:1 (w/w) blend films (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S4, ESI†), unequivocally confirming that absorption of SBF-PDI4 contributes to the JSC in these devices.

It is well known that good electron transport properties are another key factor for high performance acceptor materials. The electron mobility of SBF-PDI4 was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:SBF-PDI4/LiF/Al. Fig. S6 (ESI†) depicts the double logarithmic J–V curves of SBF-PDI4 based electron only devices with different layer thickness values. From these curves, we can conclude that all these log(J)–log(V) curves showed two linear regimes with different slopes. At low voltage ranges (0–0.3 V), the slope was determined to be 1.09 suggesting an ohmic behavior at low bias. At the second regime with a slope of 2.03 was found at higher bias (0.5–8 V), suggesting the possibility of space-charge limited current (SCLC) behaviour at such a voltage range. The fact that current was inversely proportional to the cube of the thickness of the active layer (Fig. S6(b), ESI†) further confirmed the space-charge limited current. The electron mobility was then calculated to be 1.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 according to the Mott–Gurney law, which is close to those of PDI derivatives reported in the literature.21,24,26
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also used to investigate the influence of the CN additive on the morphology of the active layer. Fig. 3 displays the TEM images of PTB7-Th:SBF-PDI4 (1:1) blend films without/with 1% CN additive. As shown in this figure, thin film blends processed without CN formed large phase separated domains (center-to-center spacing of 30–40 nm). These dimensions are much larger than typical organic exciton diffusion lengths of 10 nm35 and thereby severely limit device performance. The low JSC for the devices fabricated without an additive are attributed to this partially over-sized phase separation. By using 1% CN as the additive, a more homogeneous morphology with a uniform nano-structure (about 10 nm) appears, which is favourable for the exciton dissociation, leading to increased JSC values.

In summary, a 3D structured molecule (SBF-PDI4) based on perylenediimide (PDI) and 9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (SBF) core was designed, synthesized and characterized. The synthesized SBF-PDI4 shows good solubility in common organic solvents. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of SBF-PDI4 were also measured. The electron mobility was calculated to be 1.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 using electron only devices and the SCLC method. When blended with the conjugated polymer donor of PTB7-Th in solution-processed BHJ-OSCs, a PCE of 5.34% was obtained, which was much higher than that of the device using the linear compound PDI-F-PDI. These results demonstrate that fine-tuning of PDI-based materials with a 3D configuration may be a promising way in the development of high performance non-fullerene electron acceptors for BHJSCs.
