    , Accepted 2nd July 2014First published on 4th August 2014AbstractWe demonstrate that bulk-heterojunction blends based on neat, unsubstituted buckminsterfullerenes (C60, C70) and a thiophene–quinoxaline copolymer (TQ1) can be readily processed from solution. Atomic force and transmission electron microscopy as well as photoluminescence spectroscopy reveal that thin films with a fine-grained nanostructure can be spin-coated, which display a good photovoltaic performance. Replacement of substituted fullerenes with C60 or C70 only results in a small drop in open-circuit voltage from 0.9 V to about 0.8 V. Thus, a power conversion efficiency of up to 2.9% can be maintained if C70 is used as the acceptor material. Further improvement in photovoltaic performance to 3.6% is achieved, accompanied by a high internal quantum efficiency of 75%, if a 1:1 C60:C70 mixture is used as the acceptor material, due to its improved solubility in ortho-dichlorobenzene.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells have attracted attention due to their potential to become a cheap renewable energy technology. Particularly attractive is high-throughput coating of device components such as the active layer from solution onto a flexible substrate, which promises to be particularly cost-effective. The bulk-heterojunction, which comprises an intimate blend of electron donor and acceptor materials, is the most widely studied type of organic semiconductor architecture.1 The highest power conversion efficiencies are routinely achieved with electron-donating conjugated polymers that are blended with one of various fullerene acceptors. The most successful fullerene derivatives such as the commonly used phenyl-Cx-butyric acid methyl esters (PCxBM; x = 61 or 71) carry solubilising moieties, which considerably ease processing from solution.
However, a major disadvantage with the use of these fullerene derivatives is the increased materials cost,2 which is associated with the additional synthesis steps that are needed to attach exohedral substituents to the fullerene cage. As a result, PC61BM and PC71BM are considerably more expensive than the neat, unsubstituted buckminsterfullerenes C60 and C70 (Table 1). Since the electron acceptor fraction comprises 50–80 wt% of a typical bulk-heterojunction, it is desirable to exchange substituted fullerenes with neat buckminsterfullerenes, which would significantly reduce the cost of the semiconductor material. The use of C60:C70 mixtures would be particularly cost-effective since a mixture with a typical ratio of about 4:1 is the immediate product that is obtained from fullerene synthesis,3,4 which could be used without the need for separation.

The use of unsubstituted fullerenes is complicated by their relatively poor solubility in organic solvents as compared to substituted fullerene derivatives, which has been highlighted as early as 1995 in the seminal work by Yu et al.1 For instance, under ambient conditions up to 107 g L−1 of PC61BM and 203 g L−1 of PC71BM can be dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB),5 which is a common processing solvent for polymer solar cell blends. In contrast, only about 21 g L−1 of the ‘spherical’ C60 and 24 g L−1 of the more polarisable C70 are soluble at 20 °C.6,7 Both, C60 and C70 display an atypical solubility behaviour with a maximum solubility of about 27 g L−1 at 37 °C and 38 g L−1 at 55 °C, respectively (Fig. 1). Strikingly, the solubility of C60:C70 fullerene mixtures is somewhat higher than for the neat components, which has been explained by the formation of solid solutions.7 Thus, in principle, an adequate amount of polymer:buckminsterfullerene blend material can be dissolved in oDCB in order to facilitate, e.g., spin-coating, which is the preferred processing method for lab-scale devices. However, during film formation the poor solubility of unsubstituted fullerenes has the tendency to induce rapid crystallisation of the acceptor as well as detrimental coarsening of the blend nanostructure. As a result, early studies have struggled to achieve a good photovoltaic performance with solution-processed polymer:C60 bulk-heterojunction blends,1,8 which has diverted attention from neat buckminsterfullerene as an electron acceptor material in bulk-heterojunction devices.
 Fig. 1  Solubility of C60 (circles), C70 (diamonds) and a 1:1 C60:C70 mixture (star) in oDCB as a function of temperature; data reproduced from ref. 6 and 7 (open symbols) and measured in this study (filled symbols). 
Instead, bilayer architectures that comprise a solution-processed donor polymer layer and an evaporated C60 layer have been studied more extensively.9–13 Geiser et al. have recently reported that thermal annealing of bilayer devices comprising a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a C60 layer can yield a power conversion efficiency PCE ∼ 2.6% due to partial diffusion of the donor and acceptor material.14
In spite of the difficulties associated with processing of unsubstituted fullerenes, several studies have succeeded in solution-processing of polymer:buckminsterfullerene bulk-heterojunction thin films with a homogeneous nanostructure. For instance, P3HT:C60 bulk-heterojunction devices have been demonstrated to yield a promising PCE of about 2 to 2.5 % provided that suitable solvent mixtures are used15 or post-deposition thermal or vapour annealing is employed.14–17 Another intriguing study has explored the use of all polythiophene diblock copolymers as a compatibiliser, where C60 was crafted to the side chain of one of the alkylthiophene blocks, leading to a PCE ∼ 2.6%.18 However, the most promising result was recently achieved by Lin et al. who have reported solution processed small molecule donor:C70 photovoltaic devices with an impressive PCE as high as 5.9%.19 Despite this recent progress, the use of buckminsterfullerene mixtures has not been explored, even though their superior solubility in organic solvents can be expected to aid nanostructure formation in bulk-heterojunction blends.
Thus, here we compare the use of neat buckminsterfullerenes and C60:C70 mixtures in polymer solar cell blends. As the donor material we selected the copolymer poly[2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1), which is an attractive choice due to its particular ease of synthesis,20 good photo-stability,21 high glass transition temperature,22 and good photovoltaic performance with a PCE of up to 6–7%.20,23 We find that a homogeneous nanostructure can be achieved with neat buckminsterfullerenes as well as C60:C70 mixtures as the acceptor material, and that the highest efficiency is obtained for solar cells based on the mixtures.
2. Results and discussion
In a first set of experiments we studied the optical properties of solutions of 2 g L−1 C60, C70 and a 1:1 C60:C70 mixture in oDCB. C60 solutions appear purple, whereas solutions containing C70 feature a distinct burgundy colour due to the stronger absorption of C70 between 400 and 600 nm (Fig. 2a). UV-vis spectra of solutions with different C60:C70 ratios show an isosbestic point at 362 nm, indicating that the UV-vis spectra of mixtures are linear superpositions of the spectra of the neat components (Fig. 2b).

To examine the solubility of C60, C70 and a 1:1 C60:C70 mixture in oDCB we prepared saturated solutions by adding an excess of fullerene material to oDCB followed by incubation at 37 °C and continuous stirring. Then, saturated solutions were thoroughly centrifuged and the supernatant was extracted. The amount of fullerene material dissolved in the supernatant was determined by weighing the solid content that remained after evaporation of oDCB. We noted that the C60:C70 mixture dissolved considerably more rapidly than the neat buckminsterfullerenes, for which a longer incubation time of two days was necessary in order to ensure that the solubility limit had been reached. Based on a comparison of three saturated solutions of each material we found a similar solubility of 27 ± 2 g L−1 and 26 ± 4 g L−1 for neat C60 and C70, respectively, which is in good agreement with previously reported values (cf.Fig. 1).6,7 In contrast, for the 1:1 C60:C70 mixture we deduced a slightly higher solubility of 33 ± 1 g L−1 at 37 °C (note that ref. 7 reports a solubility of about 40 g L−1 at 50 °C for 1:1 C60:C70 in oDCB). For all subsequent experiments we first carefully dissolved the fullerene material in oDCB by heating at 37 °C for two days. Then, TQ1 solutions were added to obtain complete blend solutions with a ratio of 1:1 TQ1:fullerene material by weight. We chose to work with a 1:1 blend ratio, which is different to the optimal 1:3 stoichiometry of TQ1:PC71BM blends20,24 but allows a higher TQ1 concentration and hence solution viscosity in the case of TQ1:C60:C70 blends. Moreover, in order to further limit phase separation during film formation we synthesised a high molecular weight grade of TQ1 with a number average molecular weight Mn ∼ 76 kg mol−1 and a polydispersity index PDI ∼ 2.6 (see Experimental section for details on synthesis), which gave rise to relatively viscous solutions.
We used atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) to examine the nanostructure of spin-coated thin films (see Fig. 3a for 2:1:1 TQ1:C60:C70 and ESI, Fig. S1 and S2,† for 1:1 TQ1:C60 and 1:1 TQ1:C70). Tapping mode AFM images suggest a homogeneous surface texture with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of only 0.5 nm. The resolution limit of AFM is given by the diameter of the tip, which was 30 nm. In the corresponding TEM bright field images no distinct, phase-separated domains can be resolved and SAED patterns only reveal an amorphous halo, indicating that no fullerene crystals have formed (note that TQ1 does not feature a crystalline phase24).

Inset: chemical structure of TQ1. 
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed in order to gain better insight into the proximity of donor and acceptor molecules in the investigated bulk-heterojunctions (Fig. 3b and ESI, Fig. S1 and S2†). We calculated the PL quenching ratio Φ according to: (1)where PLTQ1(λ) and PLTQ1:fullerene(λ) describe the PL spectrum of neat TQ1 and the TQ1:fullerene blend, respectively. Our measurements revealed that in TQ1:C60:C70 films the polymer emission is strongly quenched as evidenced by a large PL quenching ratio Φ ∼ 125, which indicates good charge transfer from TQ1 to the acceptor material. Thus, we conclude that TQ1:C60:C70 blends are finely mixed, in agreement with the homogeneous nanostructure inferred from AFM and TEM. For TQ1:C70 we observed a similar value Φ ∼ 128, whereas for TQ1:C60 we found a lower Φ ∼ 37, indicating a slightly coarser blend nanostructure.
To examine the photovoltaic performance of the TQ1:buckminsterfullerene blends studied here, devices were fabricated with a standard configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The thickness of the active layers was chosen to coincide with the first interference maximum around 110 nm (cf. transfer matrix modelling below). Reference 1:1 TQ1:PC61BM devices yielded a high Voc ∼ 0.91 V and a maximum power point MPP ∼ 3.5 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, i.e. a PCE ∼ 3.5% (Table 2), which is comparable to results obtained previously for the same processing conditions.25 TQ1:C60 and TQ1:C70 devices displayed a slightly lower MPP ∼ 2.5 ± 0.1 mW cm−2 and MPP ∼ 2.9 ± 0.12 mW cm−2. Intriguingly, the use of buckminsterfullerenes only slightly reduced the open-circuit voltage by ΔVoc ∼ 0.1–0.15 V, which is a similar decrease compared to that reported for P3HT devices upon exchange of PC61BM with C60.15 Our previous square-wave voltammetry measurements revealed that PC61BM and C60 have similar lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of −4.3 eV.26 Hence, the slight difference in Voc may be attributed to the increased tendency of buckminsterfullerenes to aggregate. Strikingly, the use of C60:C70 mixtures as the acceptor material considerably enhanced the photovoltaic performance with a MPP ∼ 3.6 ± 0.1 mW cm−2 if an equal mixture of C60 and C70 was used, i.e. 2:1:1 TQ1:C60:C70 (Fig. 4a and Table 2). For these devices Voc ∼ 0.78 V is situated in between values obtained for TQ1:C60 and TQ1:C70. However, we observe an increase in fill factor FF to 0.54 ± 0.01 and in short-circuit current density Jsc to 8.4 ± 0.1 mA cm−2, which is accompanied by an increase in external quantum efficiency EQE to more than 40% at the peak absorption around 580 nm (Fig. 4b). Moreover, we prepared a set of devices based on a buckminsterfullerene ratio of 4:1 C60:C70, which is typically obtained from fullerene synthesis.3,4 For 5:4:1 TQ1:C60:C70 devices we found a MPP ∼ 2.6 ± 0.2 mW cm−2, which is comparable to TQ1:C60 devices with MPP ∼ 2.5 ± 0.1 mW cm−2, indicating that the synthesised buckminsterfullerene mixture can be used as the acceptor material in polymer solar cells without loss in performance.

In a final set of experiments we used transfer matrix modelling to estimate the maximum current density Jmax that can be extracted from 2:1:1 TQ1:C60:C70 devices as a function of active layer thickness (Fig. 5). We used the transfer matrix model described in ref. 27, for which we determined the refractive index and extinction coefficient of a 2:1:1 TQ1:C60:C70 thin film by modelling variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry spectra (ESI, Fig. S3†). We could confirm that the first interference maximum is located at a thickness of 110 nm. We compared these calculations with the experimentally measured Jsc of a series of devices that varied in their active layer thickness, controlled by choosing different spin-coating speeds and by varying the initial solution concentration (ESI, Fig. S4†). Independent of the active layer thickness, the internal quantum efficiency IQE = Jsc/Jmax had a high value of about 75%, which highlights the potential of buckminsterfullerene mixtures as the acceptor material in polymer solar cells.
 Fig. 5  Maximum calculated Jmax according to transfer matrix modelling (assuming a layer thickness of 80 nm for ITO and 40 nm for PEDOT:PSS; black diamonds) and measured Jsc of 2:1:1 TQ1:C60:C70 devices (red circles) as a function of active layer thickness. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of Jsc for four devices on the same substrate. 
3. Conclusions
We have shown that neat buckminsterfullerenes can be processed from oDCB and that the solubility increases if fullerene mixtures are used. Thin films of bulk-heterojunction blends comprising buckminsterfullerenes and the non-crystalline donor polymer TQ1 feature a fine-grained nanostructure, which gives rise to a promising photovoltaic performance that is maximised if fullerene mixtures are used as the donor material. As a result, we demonstrate a record efficiency for polymer solar cells based on non-substituted fullerenes with a maximum power point of up to 3.6 ± 0.1 mW cm−2 and an internal quantum efficiency of 75%.
Certainly, the use of unsubstituted fullerene mixtures as the acceptor material is an attractive approach also in combination with other donor polymers. Moreover, we anticipate that similar to PC61BM:PC71BM:TQ1 ternary blends28 bulk-heterojunctions based on C60:C70 mixtures display improved thermal stability.
4. Experimental section
Materials
C60 and C70 (purity 99%) were purchased from Solenne BV. TQ1 (number-average molecular weight of Mn ∼ 76 kg mol−1; polydispersity index PDI ∼ 2.6) was prepared according to the following procedure: in a 250 mL 2-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser 5,8-dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl) quinoxaline (11.5 g, 16.5 mol) and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannanyl)thiophene (6.765 g, 16.5 mmol) were dissolved in 115 mL dry and degassed toluene. The solution was stirred and heated to 90 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Pd2(dba)3 (302 g, 2 mol%) and P(o-Tol)3 (402 mg, 8 mol %) were dissolved in 2 mL dry degassed toluene and injected into the monomer solution. During the reaction, the mixture turned from red via purple to blue accompanied by a strong increase in viscosity. After 1 hour of total reaction time, the reaction product was cooled down. Then, the polymer was reverse precipitated with ethanol (1:2 v/v ratio) and collected via gravity filtration. The polymer was re-dissolved in 200 mL toluene at 60 °C under nitrogen and vigorously stirred with 200 mL of an aqueous 10% sodium diethyldithiocarbamate solution for 1 hour. After cooling, the organic layer was washed 4 times with 200 mL deionised water and subsequently reverse precipitated with methanol (1:1 v/v ratio) and collected via gravity filtration. The reverse precipitation was repeated with acetone (1:3 v/v ratio) and finally with ethanol (1:2 v/v ratio), which resulted in small, dark blue polymer fibres. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm), 7.85 (b, 4H, ArH), 7.34 (b, 2H, ArH), 7.22 (b, 2H, ArH), 7.11 (b, 2H, ArH), 6.85 (b, 2H, ArH), 3.71 (b, 4H, O–CH2), 1.52 (b, 4H, CH2), 1.36–1.0 (b, 20H, CH2), 0.88 (b, 6H, CH3). The molecular weight was determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with an Agilent PL-GPC220 instrument calibrated relative to polystyrene.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy
Measurements were performed with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrophotometer on 0.01 g L−1 fullerene solutions in ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB).
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy
PL spectra of thin films were recorded using an Oriel liquid light guide and a Shamrock SR 303i spectrograph coupled to a Newton EMCCD silicon detector. The films were excited using a blue PMM-208G-VT laser pump (4 mW cm−2) with a wavelength of 405 nm.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
Measurements were done with NTEGRA Probe NanoLaboratory (NT-MDT, Zelenograd, Russia) in tapping mode and in air using a NT-MDT golden silicon cantilever with a tip diameter of 30 nm.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Samples were prepared by floating off spin-coated films in water, followed by collection with TEM copper mesh grids. TEM images were recorded with a G2 T20 Tecnai instrument operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
Photovoltaic devices
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on ITO-patterned glass substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus, Clevios P VP Al 4083, annealed at 120 °C for 15 min after spin-coating, thickness ∼ 40 nm). The active layers were spin-coated from oDCB-solutions, which were heated at 80 °C for ∼2 h prior to deposition. In addition, fullerene-solutions were heated at 37 °C for two days before TQ1 was added. A LiF layer (thickness ∼ 6 Å) and aluminium (thickness ∼ 90 nm) top electrodes were deposited via thermal evaporation under vacuum (below 4 × 10−6 mbar). J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (Model SS50A, Photo Emission Tech., Inc.). The light source used was a 180 watt xenon arc lamp solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech.); the intensity was calibrated using a standard silicon photodiode calibrated at the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN). The active layer thickness was measured with a Dektak 150 surface profiler (estimated error ± 7 nm).
External quantum efficiency (EQE)
EQE spectra of characterised devices were recorded with a home-built setup using a Newport Merlin lock in amplifier. Devices were illuminated with chopped monochromatic light through the transparent ITO.
Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE)
Ellipsometric measurements for determination of the optical constants of 2:1:1 TQ1:C60:C70 were performed with an RC2 ellipsometer from J.A. Woollam Co., Inc. (USA). The CompleteEASE software package from J.A. Woollam Co., Inc. (USA) was used for modelling the optical constants using b-splines. A 225 nm thick 2:1:1 TQ1:C60:C70 film was spin coated on a Si substrate with ∼1 nm native oxide according to the same preparation protocol used for photovoltaic devices. The modelled extinction coefficient was used to validate the model by comparing the calculated absorption coefficient with a transmission spectrum of a 2:1:1 TQ1:C60:C70 film on glass.
