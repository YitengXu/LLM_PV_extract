    First published on 6th February 2017AbstractHigh-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices with high conversion/energy efficiencies. They offer attractive high-temperature co-electrolysis routes that reduce extra CO2 emissions, enable large-scale energy storage/conversion and facilitate the integration of renewable energies into the electric grid. Exciting new research has focused on CO2 electrochemical activation/conversion through a co-electrolysis process based on the assumption that difficult CO double bonds can be activated effectively through this electrochemical method. Based on existing investigations, this paper puts forth a comprehensive overview of recent and past developments in co-electrolysis with SOECs for CO2 conversion and utilization. Here, we discuss in detail the approaches of CO2 conversion, the developmental history, the basic principles, the economic feasibility of CO2/H2O co-electrolysis, and the diverse range of fuel electrodes as well as oxygen electrode materials. SOEC performance measurements, characterization and simulations are classified and presented in this paper. SOEC cell and stack designs, fabrications and scale-ups are also summarized and described. In particular, insights into CO2 electrochemical conversions, solid oxide cell material behaviors and degradation mechanisms are highlighted to obtain a better understanding of the high temperature electrolysis process in SOECs. Proposed research directions are also outlined to provide guidelines for future research.

1. Introduction to high-temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis cells
In recent years, increasing global consumption of fossil fuels has increased the levels of CO2 in our atmosphere greatly, leading to undesired climate change and environmental destruction.1 The development of CO2 reduction/conversion technologies should therefore be explored in conjunction with the exploration of clean, renewable alternative energy sources such as solar radiation, wind, etc.2–7
Although CO2 is a notorious greenhouse gas, it is also a vital material for many industrial processes.2,3 Thus reducing CO2 emissions and converting it into useful materials is an attractive solution that both eliminates greenhouse effects and produces energy storage.3,4 For this purpose, several treatment systems have been developed as shown in Table 1.5,6,8,9 Obviously, the most attractive and promising systems achieve CO2 reduction through conversion and utilization such as CO2 utilization through the transformation of “exhaust carbon” into “working carbon”10,11 (as shown in Fig. 1a). Typically, the two main approaches for CO2 utilization are through technological utilization and enhanced biological utilization.12,13 Technological utilization of CO2 can be divided into two reaction routes: one is to keep carbon quadrivalent with low energy exchange, and the other is to reduce CO2 to a reductive state with high energy exchange (Fig. 1b). The products of these two routes can be used as chemicals and fuels respectively. The typical products are shown in Fig. 1b and the Gibbs free energy of formation diagrams from some products are presented in Fig. 2.10 The production of fuels from CO2 is much more attractive, both environmentally and economically, since the global market for fuels is significantly larger than that of chemicals (12–14 times)10,13 and the manufacture of fuels converts significantly greater volumes of CO2 (Gt per year, Fig. 1c) than that of chemicals (>300 Mt per year). Typical approaches for CO2 conversion includes photosynthesis, photocatalysis, and thermocatalytic and electrochemical catalysis (Fig. 1d). When comparing the different types of conversions, electrochemical conversions are more attractive both in terms of energy efficiency and cost. This is because of several reasons: (1) the production of hydrocarbon fuels from CO2, water, and renewable electricity can be achieved for use as transportation fuels; (2) the process is more precise and is easier to control by controlling the electrode potentials and reaction temperatures; (3) the conversion systems are compact, highly efficient, modular, on-demand, and scalable; and (4) the process can utilize clean energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, etc., as well as surplus electricity from nuclear and hydroelectric sources.14

There are two major approaches when it comes to CO2 electrochemical conversions, one operating at low temperatures and the other operating at high temperatures. The major products of these approaches (CO2 electroreduction or electrolysis) are low-carbon chemicals such as CO, HCOOH/HCOO−, CH3OH, CH4, CH3CH2OH, etc. These chemicals can be used as either industrial chemicals or fuels. For low-temperature CO2 electroreduction, we have published a review paper in Chem. Soc. Rev.3 In this current paper, we will mainly focus on high temperature CO2 electroreduction through CO2/H2O co-electrolysis using SOECs (600–1000 °C). The schematic diagram of a SOEC for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis is shown in Fig. 3.17 This high temperature (HT) electrolyzer includes a cathode (a fuel electrode), an anode (an oxygen electrode), and a dense electrolyte (an ionic conductor), in which CO2(g) and H2O(g) are fed into the cathode. The oxide ions are then conducted across the dense electrolyte from the cathode to the anode. Finally oxygen is evolved at the anode and syngas is produced at the cathode. It is worth mentioning that the CO2 can be captured from the emissions of power plants or industries and the syngas produced can be transformed into synfuel, thus turning waste into fuel. In addition, this process can utilize clean energy sources such as nuclear or other renewable energies.

As identified, high temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis (HTCE) using SOECs has greater potential for future cost reductions and efficiency improvements18,19 as it is more energy efficient than those of the two separate electrolysis processes both in terms of lower energy consumption and less electrolysis steps as well as the fact that it requires only one necessary reactor to operate.1,20–23 The syngas (H2 + CO) that is produced is an effective energy carrier beyond electricity that can be used for large scale energy storage. It can also be further processed to generate chemicals or liquid fuels via Fischer–Tropsch (F–T) synthesis.24,25 Additionally, the fuels produced can be used to generate power within the same SOEC device in the reversible mode.26 Considering the above, SOEC technology can provide an attractive route to reduce CO2 emissions, enable scalable energy storage capabilities, and facilitate the integration of renewable energies into the electric grid. Having said this, Minh and Mogensen26 believed that SOECs should have the following attractive features: (1) compatibility (environmentally compatible with reduced CO2 emissions), (2) flexibility (fuel flexible and suitable for integration with various energy sources, especially sustainable energies), (3) capability (can be used for different functions), (4) adaptability (suitable for a variety of applications or different local energy needs), and (5) affordability (competitiveness in cost).
With regards to the history of electrochemical CO2 conversion and utilization, in the mid-1960s, solid oxide electrolysis of CO2 was originally presented as a technique for oxygen regeneration in spacecraft habitats in the US manned space-flight program. Westinghouse Research Laboratories in the USA made pioneer contributions to HTCE for aerospace applications. Chandler et al.27 succeeded in building and operating a number of small scale systems with oxygen production rates of 150 cc min−1. Elikan et al.28 first proposed the concept of utilizing solid electrolyte electrolysis batteries to generate oxygen from decomposing respiratory CO2 and/or H2O instead of carrying a heavily stored oxygen supply; which appeared to be an important means for reducing launch weight on manned space flights of long durations. This research was carried out at Westinghouse Research Laboratories under the support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
In the 1970s, Ash et al.29 first proposed the use of solid oxide electrolysis of CO2 as an In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technology to generate O2 from the predominately CO2 atmosphere of Mars. Stancati et al.30 then proposed the use of SOECs for Remote Automated In situ Jet Propellant Production for an unmanned Mars sample return mission. Richter31 performed experimental research into the technological investigations using YSZ as the solid electrolyte. In the mid-1990s, Sridhar et al.32,33 considered utilizing solid oxide cells as regenerative cells, utilizing CO and O2 produced by solid oxide cells during daylight hours as fuel under fuel cell mode and producing electricity during the night time under electrolysis mode.
Since the beginning of the 21st century, research groups from various countries and regions have renewed studies focusing on the development of new materials, the enhancement of the durability and performance of stacks and the reduction of the cost of syngas production. In 2004, NASA began to plan exploratory missions to the Moon again and further on to Mars, with research on HTCE for aerospace. Since 2005, there has been renewed international interest in related terrestrial applications for the co-electrolysis process; namely the feasibility of high temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis to produce syngas (CO + H2).34,35 Based on high temperature steam electrolysis technology, there has been rapid development of HTCE using SOECs.
In the USA, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), in cooperation with Ceramatec Inc. accompanied by Northwestern University, the University of California and the University of Florida have played an important role in promoting the feasibility of HTCE using SOECs. With emphasis on renewable energy sources, many research groups from Europe and China have also been involved in the development of HTCE to produce sustainable fuels using SOECs. The research status in terms of technical features and some research groups in different countries and regions are shown in Table 2.

As a promising route to reduce CO2 emissions and enable scalable energy storage, producing sustainable fuels using SOECs can be one of the most significant technologies for development strategies of various countries and regions. In fact, SOECs have attracted much attention in this field in recent years with research and development of high temperature co-electrolysis advancing at unprecedented rates. This fast growth is brought on by increasing demands for sustainable synthetic fuels as well as by the application of synthesis gas as a feedstock for chemical synthesis.
The economic feasibility of SOECs has been analyzed and the results show that SOECs are economically competitive in some cases. With respect to electricity storage, storage costs were estimated and compared with other previously proposed technologies such as pumped hydro, H2 storage, CAES (compressed air energy storage) and so on. For instance, a large scale novel electricity storage system using reversible solid oxide cells was proposed by Jensen et al.93 in which methane and carbon dioxide can be stored underground. The storage cost for this was approximately 3 ¢ kW−1 h−1, which is close to pumped hydro and much cheaper than other methods.
In the case of SNG (synthetic natural gas) production via integrated high temperature electrolysis (CO2/H2O co-electrolysis or steam electrolysis) and CO2 methanation, the impacts of the following key parameters were further investigated: electrolysis stack cost, cell degradation rate and CO2 feed stock cost.143 The specific cost and share for each category are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the most relevant cost item is electricity. The capital, operating and maintenance costs in co-electrolysis are higher. For co-electrolysis, the calculated break-even electricity prices (i.e., the cost to yield SNG comparable to that of the cost to yield fossil natural gas) for “state-of-the-art” and “target” scenarios are 8 and 67 $ MW−1 h−1 respectively.

Typically, the integration of high-temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis can offer efficient ways to store electricity in the form of transportation fuels. An economic assessment was studied by Fu et al.17 and the results showed that surplus wind power and nuclear power are preferred electricity sources and that the cost of the produced fuels was comparable to that of the “Biomass to Liquid” process. On the other hand, the biomass-independent process can be located in regions with abundant solar energy, suggesting that HTCE has better economic competitiveness in regions with cost-effective electricity sources.
It appears that SOECs for CO2 conversion and utilization are not mature enough to meet the requirements for practical implementation and commercialization. This can be attributed to major challenges such as the low activation/conversion rate of CO2 as well as the degradation of SOEC stacks. To facilitate research and development in overcoming these challenges, we have organized this comprehensive review to specifically focus on high-temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis using SOECs. The key topics discussed in this paper include the SOEC principle, key materials/technologies, characterization, analysis methods, performance validation/optimizations, product analysis methods, and economic analysis. With regards to theoretical approaches, the oxygen ionic transport mechanisms of oxygen electrodes in SOECs are also reviewed. Finally, future research directions are proposed to address challenges for technology application and commercialization. In particular, insights into CO2 electrochemical conversion, SOEC material behaviors and degradation mechanisms are highlighted to provide a better understanding of the co-electrolysis process. We believe that high temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis using SOECs can be widely used for energy storage and conversion with further research and development in the future.
2. Fundamentals of high-temperature CO2 conversion through electrochemical approaches
2.1. Thermodynamics of high-temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis
The high temperature electrolysis reductions of H2O and CO2 are both endothermic with their corresponding electrochemical reactions as shown in eqn (1) and (2), respectively. As the thermodynamic parameters (the enthalpy change (ΔH), the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), and the entropy change (ΔS)) are a function of temperature, the ΔH, ΔS and ΔG values of the reactions at 298.15 K can be calculated with reference to eqn (3)–(5) and data in Table 3. Based on this, ΔH, ΔS and ΔG values at various temperatures can be calculated according to eqn (5)–(8). Both ΔH and ΔG are related to cell voltage according to eqn (9) and (10). The calculated results are shown in Fig. 5, which indicates the relationships between the ΔG, ΔS and ΔH values of electrolysis reactions for H2O(g), CO2(g) and H2O/CO2(g) respectively. Meanwhile, the relationship between the ΔG and ΔH values of the water gas shift reaction is also added. H2O + 2e− → H2 + O2−(1) CO2 + 2e− → CO + O2−(2) (3) (4) ΔG = ΔH − TΔS(5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)where in eqn (3)–(10), ΔH is the enthalpy change (kJ mol−1); B is one of the reactants or products in the reaction; vB is the stoichiometric number of reactants (vB > 0) or products (vB > 0) in the reaction; ΔfHB is the enthalpy of formation for B; S is the entropy (kJ mol−1 K−1); ΔS is the entropy change (kJ mol−1 K−1); T is the co-electrolysis temperature (K); ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change (kJ mol−1); Cp is the heat capacity (J mol−1 K−1); ΔCp is the heat capacity change (J mol−1 K−1); E* is the Nernst potential (equilibrium potential) (V); En is the thermo-neutral potential (V); n is the number of electrons involved per reaction for the electrolysis reaction (n is equal to 2 for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis); and F is the Faraday constant (A s mol−1).

 Fig. 5  Relationships between enthalpy change (ΔH), Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) and entropy change (ΔS) of electrolysis reactions for CO2 (g, dotted lines) and H2O (g, solid lines) (a),148 and H2O/CO2 (g) (b),82 as well as the relationship between ΔG and ΔH of the water gas shift reaction (c).147 Reproduced from ref. 148, 82 and 147 with permission from Tsinghua University, copyright 2015; Elsevier, copyright 2014 and Elsevier, copyright 2014, respectively. 

Fig. 5a illustrates the energy demands of the two electrolysis reactions for H2O or CO2. It is well known that enthalpy is made up of a Gibbs free energy and an entropy term in accordance with eqn (5). As indicated in this figure, ΔH, ΔG and TΔS are the total energy demand, electrical energy demand and heat demand respectively. With increasing temperature, the total energy demand is almost invariant, but the increasing heat demand and the decreasing electrical energy demand are shown for both H2O splitting and CO2 splitting, which is due to positive entropy change (ΔS > 0). Compared to low or intermediate temperature electrolysis, high temperature electrolysis can use both electricity and heat effectively (the efficiency of electricity-to-syngas is up to about 100%), and can achieve high reaction rates, which in turn results in reduced cell internal resistance and greater productivity at the same voltage.147 In other words, as for H2O or CO2 electrolysis, from a thermodynamic viewpoint, high temperature operation is the better choice for both efficiency and cost.50 With respect to the relationship between the ΔH, ΔG and ΔS values of H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis, similar trends can be seen in Fig. 5b. ΔH is also insensitive to increasing temperature, which comprises ΔG and TΔS. Thus, as a complementation, the decrease of electrical energy demand is almost equal to the increase of heat demand with increasing temperature. The ΔG value is still more than 300 kJ mol−1 at 1000 °C, which definitely restricts the competitiveness of co-electrolysis. However, the competitiveness can be increased using the industrial waste heat or the electricity from renewable energy.82
Compared to separate electrolysis processes of H2O and CO2, co-electrolysis is complicated due to the water gas shift (WGS) reaction (eqn (11)) where H2O is reduced in the forward reaction, and CO2 is reduced in the reverse process (reverse water gas shift, RWGS). The ΔH and ΔG values of the WGS reaction with increasing temperatures are shown in Fig. 5c. The curves decrease sharply at 100 °C due to a phase change from a liquid state to a gaseous state. In addition to this, it can be seen clearly that the ΔG value of the WGS is 0 at 816 °C, suggesting that the forward reaction is more favorable at lower temperature (ΔG < 0), but the reverse process is the opposite. When the temperature is higher than 3000 °C, the reaction of CO2 electrolysis becomes spontaneous, but the stability of the material becomes affected. Having said that, it is clear that operations at 600–1000 °C (high temperature electrolysis) with a gas feed stream are much easier than operations at room temperature using liquid/gas feeds.147 It can be seen from this that the cell configurations and material requirements in high temperature electrolysis are obviously different from those of low temperature electrolysis systems. (11)
2.2. Kinetics of high-temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis
At the fuel electrode, the electrochemical reductions of H2O or CO2 occur at the triple phase boundary (TPB), and both the RWGS and WGS reactions occur on the surfaces of the electrode catalyst (e.g. nickel).149 This can be expressed by eqn (1), (2) and (11). As mentioned above, compared to separate H2O or CO2 electrolysis, co-electrolysis is complicated due to the WGS reaction. In the literature, based on electrochemical analysis, different researchers have seen different contributions of the WGS reaction to the overall process.20,89 This is probably due to the fact that the reaction mechanisms depend on many variables such as temperature, pressure, gas flow rates, compositions, materials, morphology, experimental setups and conditions. Therefore, it is important to consider the exact conditions employed when discussing the experimental results.
In fact, there are still outstanding disputes concerning co-electrolysis reaction pathways. As shown in Table 4, in 2011, Kim-Lohsoontorn and Bae150 investigated the electrodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) during H2O electrolysis, CO2 electrolysis and CO2/H2O co-electrolysis by using Ni–YSZ, Ni–GDC and Ni/Ru–GDC as fuel electrodes. The results showed that the performances of H2O electrolysis and CO2/H2O co-electrolysis at various electrodes are comparable. A similar result was obtained by Stoots et al.151 from Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in 2009. The electrolysis and co-electrolysis polarization curves were overlapping during SOEC stack operation, and the area specific resistances (ASRs) of co-electrolysis and H2O electrolysis were very close. They believed that under these electrolysis conditions, the reduction of CO2 in co-electrolysis is mainly due to RWGS but not due to CO2 electrolysis. However, when Graves et al.89 from Risø National Laboratory (RNL) and Li et al.130 from Tsinghua University (THU) examined the co-electrolysis performance of a SOEC, they observed that the polarization curves and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of co-electrolysis were both located between those of CO2 electrolysis and H2O electrolysis. Therefore, they believed that H2O electrolysis and CO2 electrolysis both occurred in co-electrolysis, and that the CO was produced from RWGS and CO2 electrolysis.

As shown in Fig. 6, a reaction pathway for CH4 production via CO2/H2O co-electrolysis was proposed by Li et al.130 In their proposal, at the Ni–YSZ cathode (650 °C), CO can be generated by CO2 electrolysis through both the R1 pathway and the RWGS reaction (R2). CH4 is then generated from the reactions of CO and H2 produced by H2O electrolysis (R3) on the Ni catalyst (R5). Furthermore, by increasing the operating voltage, CO can be reduced to C(s) by the R4 pathway. It is suspected that CH4 can also be generated from elemental C hydrogenation reactions through the R6 pathway. When higher operating voltages are applied, the carbon-deposits will be more significant in the presence of Ni catalysts, resulting in more CH4 through the reaction of elemental C and H2 (R6). Obviously, adding H2 into the reactants can also facilitate the R5 and R6 pathways to generate more CH4.

2.3. Comparisons between water electrolysis, CO2 electrolysis and H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis
The comparable performances for steam or CO2 electrolysis and co-electrolysis are shown in Fig. 7. For an individual electrolysis cell, Fig. 7a shows that the performance of CO2 electrolysis using SOECs at 850 °C is obviously lower than H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis, and the lowest ASR (area-specific resistance) can be measured for H2O electrolysis. Moreover, pure CO2 electrolysis may also cause nickel oxidation in the Ni–YSZ fuel electrode, leading to degradation of cell performance. Similar results can also be found in Fig. 7b showing a 10-cell SOEC stack, in which the ASR of pure CO2 electrolysis is approximately 1.8 times higher than that of CO2/H2O electrolysis. Although the ASR of H2O electrolysis is similar to CO2/H2O electrolysis, the conversion of CO2 into useful sustainable fuels or chemicals cannot be achieved by individual H2O electrolysis. In addition to this, the co-electrolysis has much fewer electrolysis steps and it required only one necessary reactor to operate as mentioned above. On the other hand, even with regards to H2O electrolysis only, the performances using alkaline cells, proton exchange membrane cells, or solid oxide electrolysis cells have been investigated and the result indicates that the electrolysis efficiency could be decreased with increasing cell voltage, and that the capital cost was decreased with increasing current density, as shown in Fig. 7c.18 Obviously, when taking all these into account, the H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis using SOECs for CO2 conversion to useful fuels or chemicals is superior to others.

2.4. Key material selection and components of SOECs
A SOEC is a device which mainly consists of a fuel electrode, an oxygen electrode and a dense electrolyte as discussed earlier in Section 1. Similarly, the microstructure of a SOEC also includes the same three compartments. One of the most common configurations of a SOEC to be investigated is Ni–YSZ|YSZ|LSM–YSZ, as shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Microstructures of a reversible solid oxide cell with the configuration Ni–YSZ|YSZ|LSM–YSZ (a planar152 and a tubular153). Reproduced from ref. 152 and 153 with permission from the ACS publications, copyright 2014 and Elsevier, copyright 2015, respectively. 
During SOEC operation, the electrode materials are used to offer active sites for significant electrochemical reactions including the oxygen evolution reaction and the reduction of H2O and CO2. Definitely, electrode materials also provide pathways for transport of electrons, ions, reactants and products. Moreover, as a good conductor, the electrolyte material provides a pathway for oxide ions from the fuel electrode to the oxygen electrode, which can mainly determine the cell ohmic resistance,154 whereas the electron transport should be suppressed in the electrolyte to prevent a “short circuit”. The properties of the electrolyte have a major impact on electrolysis cell performance through its contribution to the ohmic internal resistance. In addition to these materials, the interconnect offers electrical connection between the oxygen electrode of one individual cell to the fuel electrode of the neighbouring one in SOEC mode. It is also considered to be a physical barrier to protect the oxygen electrode material from the reducing atmosphere of the fuel electrode side.155 Similarly, the fuel electrode materials can equally be protected from the oxidizing environment. The H2 and CO are very useful products for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis to generate fuels/chemicals, however it is easy for them to leak out at high temperature due to their small molecule size. Therefore, another material for cell sealing used in SOECs to avoid gas leakage is indispensable, which must endure both reducing and oxidizing conditions during solid oxide cell operation.156 It is worth noting that the interconnect and cell sealing are of great importance especially for multiple cell stack.
Since normal SOECs operate at high temperatures, there are many important limitations on electrodes, electrolytes and interconnect materials.152 Therefore the material requirements for SOECs, such as high conductivities, compatible thermal expansion coefficients, dimensional/mechanical/chemical/thermal stabilities, and cell integration, are strict.76,157–161 Ni et al.162 emphasized several requirements for SOEC components as follows:
• The dense electrolyte should have poor electronic conduction, excellent ionic conductivity, and chemical stability in a serious reducing or oxidizing atmosphere.
• The dense electrolyte should be as thin as possible to lower ohmic overpotential, but also possess a gastight structure to completely separate the syngas and the O2.
• The pore size and porosity should be designed to not only support gas transportation but also provide sufficient triple phase boundary (TPB, the interface of the electrolyte/electrode/gas).
• Both the electrodes and electrolyte should possess compatible thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) to prevent material failure.
• The interconnect materials should be chemically stable in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres. This is particularly important because they have contact with CO(g), H2O(g), CO2(g), and O2(g) simultaneously.
• Last but not least, the cost of manufacture and raw materials should be as cheap as possible.
3. Key materials of SOECs for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis
3.1. Materials and microstructures of electrodes
SOEC electrode design is a key aspect. In order to achieve high electrolytic efficiency, the microstructure and porosity of electrode materials should be considered. In particular, the active surface area of electrodes should be enlarged. In this regard, Irvine et al.163 has summarized SOEC electrode materials and microstructures. It is generally recognized that ionic conduction (IC), electronic conduction (EC) and catalytic activity are the three essential functionalities for a SOEC electrode. Among these, the EC and IC can also be provided by a mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC).152,164–166 Materials such as metal, fluorite, perovskites, double perovskites and Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase oxides can serve as one or more essential functionality/functionalities. In particular, in a later section, the crystal structures of perovskites, double perovskites and Ruddlesden–Popper phase oxides will be discussed in detail.
With regards to composite electrodes that consist of IC and EC phases, the interface between the IC, the EC and the gas phase is an active reaction area that is called the TPB (triple phase boundary). If the functionalities of EC and IC are provided by the MIEC, the active reaction area is the interface between the solid and the gas phase called the 2PB (two phase boundary). In addition to these two common electrode microstructures, more elaborate electrode microstructures have also been proposed to increase the areas of the 2BP and TPB. For instance, ionic conductive mechanical supports can be provided by using a porous framework of stabilized zirconia (YSZ), while electronic pathways and electrocatalysts can be created simultaneously using impregnation techniques; both of which can significantly increase the areas of the TPB and 2PB.163,167
Other indispensable materials in solid oxide electrolysis cells or stacks as discussed above, including electrolyte materials, interconnect materials, and cell sealing materials, have been published in our review paper in Science in China Series B: Chemistry.168 In the following subsections, more details about these materials focusing on fuel electrode and oxygen electrode materials will be discussed.
3.2. Fuel electrode materials
Porous fuel electrodes are used to provide reaction active sites for the decomposition of H2O and CO2 in a SOEC, allowing the reactants to be transported and the products to be removed from the reaction active sites at the surface, while providing a pathway for electrons going from the interconnect to the reaction sites on the electrolyte/electrode.157
Ni–YSZ is widely used for solid oxide cell applications as a porous fuel electrode material due to its reasonable electro-catalytic activity, low cost, excellent chemically stability, and appropriate thermal expansion coefficient. Definitely, the microstructure of the fuel electrode in SOECs is critical for cell performance, which is related to electrode polarization resistances.154 In a Ni–YSZ electrode, the networks of Ni and YSZ as well as the open pores as shown in Fig. 9 can contribute to the transportation of electrons, oxide ions, and gas respectively.169 Nowadays, a fuel electrode (cathode) supported cell geometry has been designed to enhance cell electrochemical efficiency by limiting the ionic losses, which is composed of a porous Ni–YSZ substrate (also called a support layer or a current collecting layer), a functional layer (also called a catalyst layer) and a thin electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 10. Similarly, as a coarse and thick microstructure, the Ni–YSZ substrate plays an important role in gas transportation and can also induce high concentration overpotential at high current density.170 In contrast, exhibiting a thinner microstructure, the functional layer could be presented to lower the activation overpotential and accelerate the electrochemical process during SOEC operation. In pursuit of this, the density of TPB lengths, which is proportional to the active sites for electrochemical reactions, should be increased as far as possible.171 Besides, in order to improve the ionic conduction of the YSZ, the microstructure of the functional layer should be optimized, which can also lower the YSZ tortuosity factor to enhance the oxygen ion conductivity. Therefore, the microstructure properties of both the substrate or support and the functional layer are directly related to the electrolysis performance of SOECs.

Aside from tortuosity factor and density of TPB lengths, other factors including dispersion of metal nanoparticles, particle size distribution, mean particle diameters and even the thickness of each layer have significant impact on effective transport of gas, ions, and electrons, namely, the electrochemical activity of SOECs.170 For instance, microstructures of the fuel electrode with different thicknesses of current collecting layers were compared.172 The results showed that the thickness of a current collecting layer Ni–SDC (current collecting layer) cermet had a significant influence on reducing the polarization loss.
On the other hand, testing shows that the agglomeration–degradation of Ni–YSZ based fuel electrode materials during SOEC operation is an issue.174 Therefore, the microstructure optimization of Ni–YSZ materials under SOEC operating conditions is of great importance.160 Also of importance is that cell performance can be significantly different when cells are operated at different cell modes. As reported, short-term passivation can occur during the first few hundred hours of operation, which can be attributed to impurities.175,176 At least a part of these impurities may originate from the applied albite glass sealing used in the setup for cell testing. However, further research showed that besides passivation, the main cause of long-term degradation can be induced by the sealing material as well as the decreased activity of the fuel electrode. In addition, high current densities can also result in significant microstructural changes at the interface between the fuel electrode and the electrolyte, which is ascribed to the relocation of metal. The mechanisms behind this long-term degradation are still not fully understood. Therefore efforts are needed to optimize electrode microstructures to avoid agglomeration.160 More details about degradation issues of fuel electrodes will be discussed in Section 6.
In addition to the common fuel electrode material Ni–YSZ, other advance materials such as Ni–SDC (Ni–Sm0.2Ce0.8O2−δ), SFM (Sr0.5Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ), LSV (La0.6Sr0.4VO3−δ), LSCM ((La0.75Sr0.25)0.95 Cr0.5Mn0.5O3), STNO (Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3), STNNO ((Sr0.94)0.9 (Ti0.9Nb0.1)O3), LST–CGO (La0.35Sr0.65TiO3+δ/Ce0.8Gd0.2O2−δ), and LST–CeO2 (La0.35Sr0.65TiO3–Ce0.5La0.5O2−δ) are presented and their features are shown in Table 5.

To date, although a diverse variety of fuel electrode materials have been proposed and developed, there is still no single compound or composite material that can meet all requirements such as stability, activity, flexibility and low cost in SOEC operation simultaneously.157 In the case of the most widely used fuel electrode materials such as Ni–YSZ, their issues have been discussed above, the stability problems such as sulfur poisoning, oxidation of Ni and so forth are the most severe limitations. Furthermore, compared to traditional Ni–YSZ ceramics, the perovskite oxides have excellent mixed ionic and electronic conductivity and better catalytic reaction activity,177 which are also superior for redox activity, long-term operation stability, resistance to carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning.178 The electrochemical reduction reaction is proved to mainly occur at the surface of perovskite structured fuel cell materials. Unfortunately, regarding CO2 conversion, the AO termination of perovskite oxides with low oxygen vacancy concentration hinders the catalysis contact between CO2 molecules and high active B-site transition elements. In addition, it is difficult to keep the micro-nano structure of the fuel electrode at high temperatures.65,166,179
To meet these challenges, some studies can be focused on the following aspects: first, as it has been proven, doping chemistry is a promising way to adjust and improve the electrochemical activity and stability of electrode materials for SOECs, as listed in Table 5 with doping Mn, Cr, Fe, Nd and so forth. Moreover, as an alternative method to uniformly disperse active metal nanoparticles on the fuel electrode, in situ exsolution of the transition metal in the surface/interface of fuel electrode materials can not only facilitate the contact between CO2 molecules and site-B transition metals, but also increase the oxygen vacancy concentration at the reaction interface, thus enhancing electrocatalytic activity and improving CO2 conversion efficiency effectively.180–183 Du et al.180 prepared a FeNi3 bimetallic alloy nanoparticle catalyst-decorated ceramic fuel electrode by in situ reduction of the perovskite Sr2FeMo0.65Ni0.35O6−δ (SFMNi), as shown in Fig. 11. In addition to a significant enhancement of electrochemical performance, excellent structural stability and good coking resistance in wet methane can also be obtained. Moreover, in view of CO2 electrolysis using SOECs, novel in situ exsolved Fe–Ni alloy nanospheres uniformly socketed on an oxygen-deficient perovskite were proposed by Liu et al.183 as shown in Fig. 12. Compared to common fuel electrodes, the stability and efficiency for CO2 conversion have been significantly improved. Third, in view of the degradation of fuel electrode materials under high temperature conditions and even long-term operation, the corresponding mechanisms, which may guide the designs of electrode materials, are still not fully understood. Therefore, more related research studies should be performed.

3.3. Oxygen electrode materials
In order to improve the electrocatalytic performance of SOEC systems, one key approach is to improve both the activity and stability of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at oxygen electrodes.193 With regards to this, the materials and structures of oxygen electrodes and the oxygen ionic transport mechanisms in SOECs should be discussed.
Perovskite crystal structures, such as CaTiO3 as shown in Fig. 13a, are widely used as oxygen electrodes in SOECs due to their high ionic conductivity, high electronic conductivity and large oxygen exchange rate constant (kq), etc.194,195 Other perovskite-like structures such as Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase oxides113,196 (Fig. 13b) and double-perovskite oxides197 (Fig. 2c) are also widely studied because of their high performance and potentially higher stability under reducing conditions.
 Fig. 13  Crystal structures of perovskite structure oxides, Ruddlesden–Popper structure oxides (in case of n = 1) and double perovskite structure oxide. 
The general chemical formula for perovskite crystals is ABO3 (so-called “113”, named from A:B:O atomic ratios) as shown in Fig. 13a. The Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) family of An+1BnO3n+1 has a stacking sequence of AO–(BO2–AO–)n– with one of its most typical members being the A2BO4+δ structure (n = 1, so-called “214”) as shown in Fig. 13b. Interestingly, perovskite crystals are often modified by doping alkaline earth metal ions (A′) onto the A site. If the host (A) and substitutional (A′) cations order in alternate AO planes, it turns into a double perovskite structure AA′B2O5+δ (“225”) (or AA′B2O6−δ (“226”)) with an AO–BO2–A′O–BO2 stacking sequence (Fig. 13c). Moreover, the A-site is usually occupied by rare earth metal ions e.g., La3+, Gd3+, and Pr3+. In order to increase the electronic and/or ionic conductivity, the ions in the A-site can be partially substituted by alkaline earth metal ions such as Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+.88 The A′-site is often occupied by alkaline metals (Ba typically) while the B-site is often occupied by small tri- or tetravalent 3d transition metal ions (e.g., Fe3+, Co3+, Ni3+).122,198
For perovskite structures, the migration paths of an oxygen anion in the cubic symmetry systems were described by Chroneos et al.199 When the B-site is substituted by divalent ions such as Ca2+, Sr2+, or Ba2+, an oxygen vacancy will be formed around the B-site which can be used as a cubic symmetrical migration path for the oxygen anion. Table 6 lists several perovskite based oxygen electrode materials in various SOEC cells. In early studies of SOECs, lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM, La1−xSrxMnO3)-based materials were the most commonly used oxygen electrode materials among perovskite oxides due to their acceptable electronic conductivities and catalytic activities. However, delamination issues related to LSM-based materials can lead to an increase of polarization resistance.200,201 Moreover, the low ionic conductivity of LSM is also an obstacle that results in the lack of active sites for the ORR at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Consequently, some alternative oxygen electrode materials related to “La–Sr–Co–Fe” systems such as La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 (LSC), La0.8Sr0.2FeO3 (LSF), and La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF) have been developed. Additionally, another high activity material, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) as predicted by Suntivich et al.,63 has been investigated by many researchers.63,118,201,202 To improve the stability of those materials, inter-diffusion barriers such as Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC), Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (GDC), and La La0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (LDC) can be applied between the electrolyte and the electrode to prevent chemical reactions as listed in Table 6 as well.

With regards to the Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) series of materials, the oxygen ionic conductivity is higher than that of perovskite materials by several orders of magnitudes. It is notable that oxygen migration concentrates on the a–b plane showing high anisotropy with almost no diffusion in the c-axis. Oxygen interstitials exist in layered hyper-stoichiometric RP materials. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have indicated anisotropic interstitial mechanisms via the a–b plane chiefly in hyper-stoichiometric RP materials La2CoO4+δ, La2NiO4+δ, Pr2NiO4+δ and Nd2NiO4+δ.113,203–206 Rare-earth nickelate oxides (with K2NiF4-type structure) such as La2NiO4+δ and Pr2NiO4+δ can be chosen as oxygen electrode materials due to their electrocatalytic activity. These materials and the two interfacial ceria based layers, (Ce0.8Y0.2O2−δ) YDC and (Ce0.8Gd0.2O2−δ) GDC, were studied as oxygen electrodes by Ogier et al.207 In contrast, enhanced electrochemical properties can be achieved by adding an interlayer. PNO–YDC was selected for characterization of single SOEC cells for comparison with commercially available La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3−δ cells and showed similar performances. Furthermore, the substitution of Sr, Cu or Ga in Pr2NiO4 can improve stability and oxygen diffusivity.208 Another typical MIEC material, Nd2NiO4+δ (NNO), shows promising electrocatalytic activity for the ORR, with a much higher oxygen diffusion coefficient (D*) of 10−7 cm2 s−1 and a surface exchange coefficient (K) of 10−6 cm s−1.141,206 More details and other Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase oxides in various SOEC cells are listed in Table 7.

A significant paper about double perovskites as anode materials for SOFCs was presented by Goodenough's group and published in Science.70 This paper reports the identification of the double perovskite Sr2Mg1−xMnxMoO6−δ and that this double perovskite material, when applied in a single cell, showed outstanding performance in H2 and CH4. To better understand the oxygen transportation of layered double perovskite oxides, the tetragonal structure and oxygen migration pathways for double perovskite GdBaCo2O5+δ were described by Parfitt et al.209 The oxygen ion diffusion was investigated by employing molecular dynamics (MD). The results showed that oxygen ions migrated between the O2 and O3 sites primarily, thus suggesting that the diffusion mechanism is highly anisotropic.210–212
Double perovskite materials such as Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ,213–216 LaBaCo2O5+δ,217–221 PrBaCo2O5+δ,197,222–224 GaBaCo2O5+δ,225–231 Sr2MgMoO6−δ232 and so on were studied as oxygen electrodes in SOFCs. Since double perovskite oxides have high electronic conductivity, rapid oxygen ion diffusion and surface exchange kinetics,212,233–235 these materials should also be considered as candidates for use as oxygen electrode materials in SOECs. However, there are much fewer published papers for these double perovskite oxygen electrode materials in SOECs than those in SOFCs. Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ (SFM) has been prepared and employed for the first time as an oxygen electrode in symmetrical SOECs (SFM|LSGM|SFM) for H2 production by Liu et al.81 The resulting cell polarization resistance reached as low as 0.26 Ω cm2 under an open circuit (900 °C), with a H2 production rate of 380 mL cm−2 and an electrolysis current of 0.88 A cm−2 under a voltage of 1.3 V (900 °C, 60 vol% AH). Moreover, adequate stability in long-term steam electrolysis tests has also been verified, showing better performance than that of LSM-based cells (Ni–YSZ|YSZ|LSM–YSZ). Li et al.142 presented another case using Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ–Zr0.84Y0.16O2−δ (SFM–YSZ). The composite oxygen electrode was fabricated by impregnating the YSZ matrix with SFM (different proportions by weight), the electrolysis current was 327 A cm−2 at 750 °C for the SFM–YSZ (20 wt% SFM) oxygen electrode. The optimal H2 production rate reached 11.46 N L h−1 for the SOEC with SFM–YSZ (20 wt% SFM) at 750 °C. These studies demonstrate that both SFM and SFM–YSZ are promising electrodes for SOECs.
Various electrode materials have been summarized and discussed in this section. In general, these electrode materials can be classified into three large categories as mentioned in Section 3.1. First, as for the metal electrodes, both nickel and platinum may be applied as fuel electrodes and only noble metals such as platinum or gold can be used as oxygen electrodes in SOECs.173,236 Obviously, the noble metals used as electrode materials are too costly for commercial SOECs. Nickel has a significant thermal expansion mismatch to stabilized zirconia, and it may aggregate by grain growth especially at high temperatures. Second, ceramic electrodes, with some typical materials such as SFM, LSV, LSCM, LSM and so on reviewed above, are generally chosen due to their good ionic and/or electronic conductivities, although it seems that their catalytic properties and stabilities are not optimal. Third, composite electrodes are developed to enhance the reactive areas and thus the electrode activity and even the stability. The composite electrodes can be generally classified into two groups including metal–ceramic electrodes (e.g. Ni–YSZ, Ni–SDC, LSCM–Cu etc.) and ceramic–ceramic electrodes (e.g., LSC–YSZ, LSM–YSZ, LSM–GDC etc.). Aside from the enhancement of activity, a closer overall thermal expansion matching with the electrolyte can also be achieved for composite electrodes. Additionally, the advanced electrodes prepared with impregnation,141,167,215,228,237,238 exsolution,180,183,239–241 or heterostructure57,59,66,67,242 may further enhance the reaction sites and activities.
With respect to the progress of research and development for functional electrodes as proposed by Mogensen et al.,163 the evolution can be divided into three stages: from single-phase electrodes, through bulk composite electrodes, to impregnated skeletons and to locally exsolved structures.
4. SOEC performance measurement, characterization and simulation
4.1. Electrochemical measurement
Current–voltage (I–V) measurements may be the most fundamental and important method in electrochemical research, especially for SOECs.248 The SOEC cell voltage, including open circuit voltage (OCV), can be observed and compared in order to study the properties of the electrochemical process and the impedance such as area-specific resistance (ASR). For example, electrochemical performances at various temperatures for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis can be measured and the influences of humidity on H2O electrolysis can studied using the current–voltage (I–V) method.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is another insightful method used in SOEC characterization. Using EIS, the impedance of a SOEC can typically be measured in a wide frequency range from 10−2 to 107 Hz using an alternating perturbation current or voltage.249–253 Meanwhile, different electrochemical processes can be separated according to electrical relaxation times. For example, electrochemical processes and corresponding electrochemical properties can be investigated systematically using EIS.165 In comparison with bulk materials, hetero-structured interface materials have attracted increasing attention in solid oxide cells recently because of their inherently attractive physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties, especially their enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen activity and electronic/ionic conductivities.54,56,57,66,254–257 These hetero-structured interfaces are investigated using EIS to compare the electrochemical performances of different materials.65 Furthermore, EIS can be performed in situ during operation, giving more insightful and accurate results.152,163 To better understand a material's properties, the information from EIS is always complemented or better interpreted when combined with structural (especially the microstructure) information.
4.2. Microstructure characterization

(1) SEM, TEM and STEM. 
For physical characterization of SOEC materials, SEM (scanning electron microscopy) is a common method used to observe the microstructure of materials.253,258,259 For example, the microstructures of a SOEC with the configuration of Ni–YSZ|YSZ|LSM–YSZ can be displayed as shown in Fig. 14. The surface features of the materials can be presented clearly and directly using SEM at different scales.
 Fig. 14  SEM image showing the surface structure of perovskites in the formation of exsolutions (a);259 TEM images show the interface of exsolved particle–substrate: a Ni particle exsolved on a (110) native surface facet (b) and the interface of metal–perovskite with outstanding atomic planes and orientations (c).240 Reproduced from ref. 259 and 240 with permission from Macmillan Publishers, copyright 2013 and 2015, respectively. 
TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) is another popular method for SOEC material characterization. There are several differences between the two methods. First, TEM is based on transmitted electrons while SEM is based on scattered electrons. Second, TEM can provide details about the internal composition of SOEC materials with 3-dimensional images, whereas SEM specializes in providing the material's surface 2-dimensional picture. For analogy, TEM and SEM are similar to a “microscope” and a “camera”, respectively. In addition, many characteristics involving morphology, crystallization and even magnetic domains can be shown by TEM whereas SEM can only show morphology.

Fig. 14 shows the surface/interface structures of perovskites, including a SEM image of La0.52Sr0.28Ni0.06Ti0.94O3 surfaces and two TEM images of the exsolved particle–substrate interface. It can be clearly seen that TEM has a much higher resolution than SEM, allowing for analysis at a nano level, as seen by the scale bars of the three images (1 μm, 10 nm and 1 nm). Having said this, SEM is still indispensable in the study of SOEC cell materials in general.
Furthermore, an alternative TEM technique for exploiting high spatial resolutions possible with thin specimens is STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy). This technique is considered to be consistent with parts of SEM and TEM. In measurements using STEM, a finely focused beam is scanned on the scanning microscope and the image is generated by the electrons transmitted through the sample.261 This technique is occasionally used in studies of SOECs.57,90 For example, the hetero-interfaces of La1−xSrxCoO3 (LSC113)/(La1−xSrx)2CoO4 (LSC214) phases were shown by taking STEM images for a better understanding of its microstructure. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) can also be coupled to TEM or STEM to obtain more information about SOECs such as an elemental analysis of the electrode/electrolyte interface (for short, SEM-EDX or STEM-EDX).90,191,262


(2) FIB-SEM and XCT. 
A microstructure overview can be achieved by SEM and a 3D (three-dimensional) reconstruction can be obtained with focused ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM) tomography.163,260 Dual-beam FIB-SEM can significantly facilitate the process of 3D microstructure reconstruction by presenting high-quality volumetric data. Fig. 15 shows a FIB performed on an ion mill trench in a SOEC,260 which provides insight to better understand the quantifiable correlations between the processing and the microstructure of the electrode.57
 Fig. 15  Images of the TPB region in Ni–YSZ composite electrodes of solid oxide cells taken using FIB-SEM. (a) Schematic diagram of FIB-SEM; (b) SEM image of the etched region in the electrode; (c) 3D electrode reconstruction (green for Ni, grey for YSZ-translucent, and blue for the pore phases); (d) distribution of TPB boundaries in the electrode.260 Reproduced from ref. 260 with permission from Nature Publishing Group, copyright 2006. 
Due to the fact that FIB-SEM is not suitable for in situ studies of solid oxide cells on account of its destructive nature, an alternative X-ray computed tomography (XCT) has been developed for in situ studies and possibly during operation as well. XCT features sub-50 nm resolution, non-vacuum and non-destructive operation.263 From Fig. 16, it can be seen that the XCT technique is applied to show the 3D microstructure of a solid oxide cell, which includes an YSZ electrolyte and a Ni–YSZ electrode. The collected data from XCT systems can be post-processed to enable visualization of the actual porous microstructure, and allow calculations of structural parameters such as the porosity and tortuosity of the porous solid oxide cell electrodes.263

(3) STM/STS and AFM. 
Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)264,265 is another characterization method for SOEC materials. The spectroscopy taken using STM is correspondingly called scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS). It can be used to see individual atoms distinctly.266,267 STM images of perovskite LSC113 vertically aligned nanocomposite structure surfaces were taken using a modified variable temperature scanning tunnelling microscope (VT-STM) for researching oxygen electrode materials.
The invention of STM was quickly followed by the development of a family of related techniques. AFM (atomic force microscopy) is one of them that is used in the study of SOECs.57,269,270 There are two modes of AFM, one is called non-contact (NC-AFM), and the other one is called intermittent contact (IC-AMF).266 AFM can also be used to see individual atoms distinctly and the grain structure of surfaces and roughness can be observed clearly.57 For example, Ni–YSZ electrodes were investigated using AFM to understand the influence of the segregation of impurities on electrode/electrolyte interface performance.269 Additionally, AFM was used to assess the connections between the surface chemistry and the ORR kinetics as well as the (001) and (100) surface topography of (La1−xSrx)2CoO4 (LSC).58

4.3. Surface analysis
Several techniques including XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, or ESCA, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis), SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy), AEM (auger electron spectrometry), and LEIS (low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy) can be used for probing material surfaces at different depths. These techniques can be used to inspect surface depths from interfaces of 1–10 nm, several to hundreds of nm, 1–3 nm, as well as to inspect the outer atomic monolayer. XPS is the most commonly used technique to study solid oxide cell materials.157,190,191 When an X-ray or electron beam of energy impinges on sample atoms, inner shell electrons are ejected. By measuring these ejected electrons, material properties can be examined and thus, the surface chemistry of a material (such as the valence state of elements or the phase state of materials) in both its as-received state and its state after treatment can be analyzed. For instance, to validate the elemental valence, XPS was used to examine reduced and oxidized Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3 samples, and the oxidation state was confirmed by comparing the binding energies of different states.191 Other cases of using XPS spectra for solid oxide cell materials have also been published.56,64
In many respects, the process of AES is similar to that of XPS except for one fundamental step. In the AES process, a certain proportion of inner-shell ionization gives rise to the ejection of a bound electron rather than the emission of a characteristic X-ray photon. Compared with XPS, the spatial resolution of AES is much higher, and the Auger spectra may be more sensitive to chemical states than that of XPS at times.
In general, SIMS is a relatively new surface analysis technique used in solid oxide cell research.270–273 In this technique, focused primary ion beams are first performed to sputter the sample surface, then the ejected secondary ions are collected and analyzed using a mass spectrometer such as sector, quadrupole, or time-of-flight. With regards to solid oxide cell studies, oxygen exchange at the hetero-interface can be investigated with SIMS.270,271 3D SIMS can be performed to display elemental 3D distributions with fast oxygen-incorporation paths being able to be determined with SIMS images. One case is the study of B poisoning in La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 oxygen electrodes in SOECs. The SIMS images showed elemental distributions and confirmed the separation of the electrode/electrolyte interface region.272
LEIS, also known as ISS (ion scattering spectroscopy), is similar to SIMS but it only inspects the outer atomic monolayer. LEIS is unique in that it is sensitive to both the structure and composition of surfaces. The collected and interpreted data provide information on the relative position and elemental identity of outer atomic elements in lattices. This technique is an emerging method for solid oxide cell studies, especially in the research of electrode/electrolyte segregation.166,273
4.4. Simulations and calculation methods
Density functional theory (DFT) is a useful computational method to analyze and predict the structures and properties of materials on an atomic/molecular scale. Better understanding of ORR mechanisms involving oxygen migration can be achieved by adding this method.163,251 For example, by using DFT-based calculations, Han et al.274 proved that the hetero-interface region of perovskite-based oxides was a dynamic solid oxide cell sub-system with significant high oxygen surface exchange and migration kinetics. The activation at the hetero-interface was thought to be caused by anisotropy lattice strain. According to Gadre et al.,275 chemical and structural asymmetry can lead to cation segregation and lattice reconstruction at the interfacial region, and therefore induce many unique properties in this region.
Molecular dynamics (MD) is an advanced computational simulation method used to learn the physical movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are simulated to interact within a certain period of time, providing a systematic view of the dynamical evolution process. MD simulations propose that the trajectories of atoms and molecules are controlled by interatomic potentials or molecular mechanics forces. Newton's equations are applied to numerically solve the motions of interacting particles. MD simulations are widely applied today in calculations of chemical physics, materials sciences and biomolecule modelling. In the field of SOECs, MD simulations were used to identify the mechanisms of oxygen ion diffusion in Pr2NiO4+δ276 and tetragonal La2NiO4+δ203 as published in the literature.
4.5. Product analysis
With regards to the products of CO2 electrochemical conversion, high temperature electrolysis using SOEC normally has better selectivity when compared to low temperature electrolysis. Therefore, product analysis for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis is relatively easier. The main products in co-electrolysis are CO(g) and H2(g) according to eqn (1) and (2). However, CO2(g) and H2O(g/l) can also be detected sometimes in the gas mixture downstream.
Gas chromatography (GC) is the most fundamental and important method for product analysis for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis. Measurements are performed starting from open circuit voltage (OCV) up to a certain applied voltage such as 1.4 V.277 One important factor is to control the stabilization of the voltage and temperature before GC measurements. Mass spectrometry (MS) is also used to measure and calculate experimental H2 or/and CO production.278 The content of residual CO2 in the gas mixture downstream of the stack can be measured using a Dual Gas analyzer.277 The mass flow rates of gases should be controlled using mass flow controllers.80,247,258
Alenazey et al.277 investigated the influence of fuel composition and operating parameters such as current density on the relative amounts of products including H2 and CO. The composition of downstream gases after water condensation was also analyzed using gas chromatography (GC). Ebbesen et al.1 studied the reaction mechanisms of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and H2O, and especially investigated the reaction mechanisms during co-electrolysis. The gases at both the inlet and the outlet were analyzed using a GC with a Hayesep N column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The results showed that the WGS reaction can reach an equilibrium in the process of co-electrolysis, thus suggesting that one of the products CO was not only produced via electrode reaction (eqn (2)) but also via WGS reaction.
Syngas (H2O and CO2) production through co-electrolysis with a Cu-based SOEC was studied by Gaudillere et al.278 The expected syngas production was calculated based on Faraday's equation while the experimental syngas production was measured by both GC and MS. The H2 production in the fuel electrode exhaust gas with time and current and the CO production can be calculated and shown in figures for comparison. Through these comparisons, the reaction mechanisms of CO2 electrolysis were investigated and the feasibility of syngas production via co-electrolysis was further confirmed. The authors proposed that in order to reach higher yields and efficiencies, both the system fabrication and the electrocatalysis of SOECs needed to be further improved.
5. SOEC cell and stack design, fabrication and scale-up
5.1. SOEC component/cell/stack structure, fabrication, and scale-up

5.1.1. Component/cell/stack structure. 
The main components of single-cell SOECs include the fuel electrode, the electrolyte, and the oxygen electrode as shown in Fig. 8. With regards to cell configurations, individual SOECs can be planar, tubular or flat tubular as shown in Fig. 17a.147 Early SOEC systems developed by Doenit et al.279 and Feduska et al.280 used tubular cells as their geometry. When compared to planar configurations, higher mechanical and thermal stability can be achieved with tubular configurations. Sealing of the cell is also much easier in tubular configurations than that of flat-plate configurations as the sealing area is significantly reduced. Having said this however, planar designs have still been widely adopted due to their much shorter current collection paths and significantly higher volumetric density.
 Fig. 17  Various SOEC cell configurations (a)147 and structure of SOECs from stack to single cell (b).298 Reproduced from ref. 147 and 298 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2015 and AAAS, copyright 2011, respectively. 
In order to improve the chemical output of a single-cell SOEC system, the active cell area must be enlarged. There are however limitations to simply increasing the area of a single-cell SOEC. First, it is difficult to control the temperature across large cell areas, and second, it is challenging to manufacture large and low-cost ceramic films. Furthermore, the 1.4 V voltage of a single cell is too low to operate in a co-electrolysis system. In order to circumvent these issues, a stack consisting of multiple cells is necessary, the structure of SOECs from a stack to a single cell is shown in Fig. 17b (in the case of a planar cell). Obviously, interconnects must be added in a stack, however, a difficult challenge for the interconnects is to provide adequate electrical connections between the oxygen electrode of one single cell to the fuel electrode of the adjacent one without gas permeation.
With regards to SOEC stacks, durability is one of the most challenging topics for researchers86,98,281–283 and it will be discussed in detail in later sections. Currently, we will focus on the basic structures of SOEC stacks. Fundamentally, the stacks can be classified into three large categories: planar,284–289 tubular116,140,153,290–296 and flat tubular297 geometries.
(1) Planar SOECs. 
Planar SOECs may be in the form of a square plate or a circular disc.100 For square plate SOECs, both 10-cell and 5-cell SOEC stacks are presented in Fig. 18. In addition to 10 planar SOECs, other components such as interconnects, seal gaskets, flow channels and end plates are also shown in Fig. 18a. MSRI stacks consisting of five single Ni/YSZ-supported SOECs along with their interconnects, meshes and gaskets are shown in Fig. 18c. Aside from the exploded views of stack structures, 3D views of the test fixture for the two stacks are also shown in Fig. 18b and d. Obviously, the detailed structures of the stacks depend on different demands.

Ebbesen et al.86 proposed multi-cell stacks with planar Ni/YSZ-supported solid oxide cells for steam electrolysis or CO2/H2O co-electrolysis, as shown in Fig. 19. The stacks consist of either six (for H2O electrolysis) or ten (for co-electrolysis) repeating units which contain the cell and the interconnect. A single repeat unit of the SOEC stack with circular discs presented by Boëdec et al.299 is shown in Fig. 20. In addition to the main components such as electrolytes and electrodes, the interconnects (flexible, cathodic and anodic interconnects), seals and cell supports are also important.

(2) Tubular SOECs. 
Tubular stacks are developed due to their higher mechanical and thermal stabilities. In the past, multiple-cell tubular stacks were proposed by Spacil and Tedmon300 for water vapor electrochemical dissociation. There are two general designs for multiple-cell stacks as shown in Fig. 21 and 22. The electrolyte in the first design is continuous (Fig. 21) with one advantage being that the electrolyte can provide a convenient structural element. The series interconnection between the fuel electrode and the oxygen electrode is made by a lead such as a wire. The electrolyte is not continuous in the second design (Fig. 22) and the series connection between the two electrodes is made directly as shown in Fig. 22a and c, or the connection is achieved by an intermediate metal ring or collar as indicated in Fig. 22b.

 Fig. 22  Schematic diagrams of several possible configurations for tubular stacks with discontinuous electrolytes.300 Reproduced from ref. 300 with permission from the ECS, copyright 1969. 
Novel designs have been developed in recent years. Fig. 23 shows a solid oxide natural gas-assisted steam electrolyzer.290 Compared to conventional SOECs, adding a system for heat recovery which consisted of a catalytic reactor and heat exchangers can form a high-efficiency production system. Fig. 23a shows a tubular SOEC stack with 4 tubes. The natural gas flows inside the tubes while the steam/hydrogen mixture exits from the outside compartment of the tubes and the inside of the metal vessel. Fig. 23b shows the experimental facility for testing.

(3) Flat tubular SOECs. 
For flat tubular SOECs, as shown in Fig. 24,297 the upper side of the single cell is used as the air/oxygen electrode while the bottom side is used as the steam electrode and the interconnector. As seen in Fig. 24b, the steam channels are located in both perpendicular and parallel directions, and the air channels are perpendicular to the steam channels. The thickness of a single cell is 4.9 mm and the area of the oxygen electrode is 30 cm2. In addition, the area of the channels is equal to the area of non-channels. In order to investigate the influence of operating conditions on the electrolysis performance, button cells with an active area of 0.5 cm2 were fabricated in this work.

5.1.2. Fabrication. 
The fabrication process selected for each SOEC cell/stack design depends on various configurations of the cells in the stack with the fabrication of the dense electrolyte being the key step in any selected process. There are two main approaches to ceramic fabrication, one being the particulate method and the other being the deposition method. The particulate method involves the compaction of ceramic powder into the components of SOEC cells and then densification at high temperatures,301 such as tape casting and tape calendering. The deposition method for manufacturing of cell components on a support involves processes such as plasma spraying, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or spray pyrolysis.
(1) Particulate method. 
There are currently three main particulate processes for the fabrication of SOECs: tape casting, tape calendering and extrusion. The first two processes are often used in the fabrication of planar SOECs whereas the third one is used for tubular SOECs.
Tape casting. 
This is a common manufacturing process for thin, flat sheets of ceramic. This method has been used for the fabrication of various components of planar SOECs. The steps of tape casting include ① using a doctor blade to make a layer of slip (e.g. ceramic powder suspended in a liquid), ② drying this layer on a temporary support, and ③ stripping the layer from the support and then firing. Multilayer tapes can be manufactured by one continuous casting layer on top of another.
Tape calendering. 
This process is also often used for the fabrication of various components of planar SOECs.301 The steps of tape calendering include ① mixing the ceramic powder and organic binder in a high shear mixer to form a plastic mass, ② rolling the mass into a tape of desired thickness, and ③ firing the tape at elevated temperatures. Multiple tapes can be achieved by laminating with single layers for rolling operation again.
Other particulate processes such as pressing302 and extrusion303,304 have also been developed for the fabrication of SOECs. The extrusion method is often used in fabricating tubular or flat tubular SOECs.
(2) Deposition method. 
Deposition techniques are widely used for the fabrication of both planar and tubular SOECs. Select deposition processes are introduced as follows:
Sputtering. 
This process involves depositing an YSZ film on a substrate using an electrical discharge in an argon/oxygen mixture atmosphere.
Dip coating. 
This process involves immersing porous substrates in a YSZ slurry of colloidal size particles, and then drying and heating the deposited films.
Spray pyrolysis. 
This process involves spraying a solution consisting of powdered precursors and/or the last particle ingredient onto a substrate at high temperatures and then sintering it to allow for densification of the deposited layer.
Plasma spraying. 
This process involves injecting a powder into a plasma jet where the powder is accelerated, melted, and deposited on a substrate.
Other deposition processes such as electrophoretic deposition, vapour phase electrolytic deposition and so on have also been explored and developed for the fabrication of SOECs.


5.1.3. Scale-up. 
Modular designs of CO2/H2O co-electrolysis systems are necessary for meeting the different-scale demands of hydrogen and/or syngas production due to the limited size of a single cell. Normally, modular designs arrange single cells in uniform size together to form a SOEC stack. Then several of these stacks can be assembled to make a basic module. Obviously, the more modules there are, the larger the surface area which can result in higher production capacity. This modular design allows for scale-up in sizes, which includes the increase in the size of module sub-assemblies and the development of sub-systems required for system control operations. It also increases the reliability and flexibility of the stack system.
In the above section, the SOEC stacks presented have no more than 10 cells only. For practical implementation and commercialization, scale-up is necessary. Therefore, large scale SOEC stacks or even modules have been developed in the literature. For example, a low-weight and cost-effective stack with enhanced performance was designed and proposed by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).104,305,306 This stack proved to be scalable from 3 to 25 cells. In particular, two stacks with 10 and 25 cells were tested in both steam electrolysis and CO2/H2O co-electrolysis modes by Reytier et al.306 with H2 production rates of 0.6 and 1.7 N m3 h−1 achieved, respectively, and steam conversion efficiencies of around 50% at 800 °C below 1.3 V (Fig. 25). The cost analysis was also performed and the results supported the economic potential of this technology. Through their approach, the scale-up of SOEC systems for practical application is validated for both steam electrolysis and H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis.

A 4 kW high temperature steam electrolysis unit was presented for large-scale H2 production, which consisted of two 40-cell SOEC stacks.307 The theoretical H2 production rate was approximately 23 L min−1 for long-term operation (830 h, 0.41 A cm−2). Furthermore, a large scale planar stack was also fabricated by Stoots et al.308 and the feasibility of using SOECs for high temperature steam electrolysis for large-scale H2 production was validated. Recently, the investigation of CO2/H2O co-electrolysis for syngas production was also performed. As shown in Fig. 26, multiple stacks consisting of 720 cells, with each single cell possessing a 10 cm × 10 cm active area, were tested in a newly developed test facility of 15 kW Integrated Laboratory Scale. Operation parameters such as operating voltage, gas composition and operating temperature were varied during the testing. Results to date indicate that this technique is promising for hydrogen and syngas production.308

Recently, high-efficiency, low-cost hydrogen production SOEC electrolyzers were presented by SunFire GmbH, a company focusing on developing a competitive process to produce synthetic renewable fuels (e.g. petrol, diesel, kerosene or methane) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) using renewable electrical energy.103 Their multi-module SOEC electrolyzer installation is shown in Fig. 27, and its technical specifications are listed in Table 8. The applications of this system include (1) industry: metallurgy|float glass|electronics|chemicals; (2) mobility: refineries|fueling stations; and (3) energy storage: island grids|peaker power. The rated electrical power of hydrogen generation and power generation (in solid fuel cell mode) can reach 150 and 25 kW respectively.

According to the introduction of this installation from SunFire GmbH, the competitive advantages are (1) cost efficiency: high system efficiency through heat utilization (η > 80% LHV); (2) productivity: promising low hydrogen production costs as compared to legacy technologies (<5 € kg−1); (3) reversibility: reversible operations in electrolysis as well as in fuel cell mode; (4) modularity: scalable subsystem design to meet customer hydrogen demands; and (5) purity: renewable electricity and steam for clean hydrogen.
In summary, although the installations of co-electrolysis have not been commercialized, it is believed that the development of steam electrolysis with SOECs will be feasible, and both the technical and economic goals will be attainable in the near future.

5.2. SOEC systems

5.2.1. System management. 
SOEC stacks are the key components for high temperature electrolysis. However, similar to fuel cell systems, high temperature electrolysis systems also include many subsystems besides the SOEC stack itself. These include heat management subsystems, power management subsystems, steam management subsystems, gas transfer/purification subsystems, data acquisition and control subsystems and security subsystems.
Efficient heat management can improve the overall efficiency of high temperature electrolysis processes by reducing energy consumption and recovering some heat contained in the outlet products of the electrolysis.309 The chemical production rate of SOEC systems can be flexibly changed with power supply management. SOEC systems are more complex as compared to SOFC systems. The main reason is steam condensation, which will result in SOEC stack cracking as well as fluctuations in operating conditions. Steam management subsystems therefore can guarantee the effective use and accurate control of steam. The main function of gas transfer/purification subsystems is to control the composition of the inlet gas, and to purify the product. Data acquisition and control subsystems can monitor and control the SOEC modules. In a high temperature electrolysis system, safety precautions are essential to handle high temperature H2 and O2 effectively.


5.2.2. Lab-scale SOEC systems. 
In a SOEC system, electricity, heat, and steam with CO2 enters the SOEC stack and fuel products together with exhaust gases will exit the system. Therefore, in addition to SOEC stack construction, other balance-of-plant (BOP) components are also required as mentioned above. BOP equipment may differ for each application depending on the size of the system and the operating parameters including operating pressure.147,295,310,311 Here a case related to lab-scale SOEC systems is presented as follows:
A schematic of an electrolysis/co-electrolysis bench-scale system with a 10-cell stack is shown in Fig. 28. Besides a SOEC stack, there are several BOP components. Here N2 is used as the inert carrier gas and CO2 is only used during co-electrolysis. The components and their functions are as follows: (1) mass flow controllers, establishing the flow rates of gases; (2) shop air system, supplying airflow to the stack; (3) heated humidifier, mixing the N2/H2/CO2 gas mixture with steam; (4) computerized feedback control, maintaining the temperature of humidifier water; (5) absolute pressure transducers, measuring the pressure; (6) thermocouples, monitoring gas line temperatures; (7) condenser, removing the surplus steam in the exhaust after condensation; and (8) detecting system, measuring the electrical current, steam/CO2 concentrations (sensors) and products (GC). Similarly, a large SOEC system with a 720-cell stack is also shown in Fig. 29 along with its major balance-of-plants labeled and their names listed. The date acquisition and instrument control can be achieved by means of a custom Lab View (National Instruments) program.

6. Degradation issues of SOECs
It is well known that degradation is one of the most noteworthy issues affecting co-electrolysis using SOECs.312 Under practical operations, the lowest degradation is 1.7%/1000 h for 3600 hours at −1 A cm−2 as reported in the literature.100 The degradation rates of a 5-cell SOEC stack with 5000 hours of successful operation were approximately 15%/1000 h (0–2000 hours) and 6%/1000 h (2000–5000 hours) for two types of feed-gas compositions. In another case, 18% loss in H2 production was observed after 1000 hours of operation when performed by the Idaho National Laboratory with a 25-cell SOEC stack.313
Therefore, in order to reduce degradation and prolong the lifetime of SOEC stacks, a deeper understanding of the degradation mechanism is critical. Generally, the approaches to deal with this issue can be classified into two large groups, altering operating conditions and modifying cell architecture by optimizing or replacing SOEC materials, especially electrode or electrolyte materials. The degradation of SOEC materials is much more challenging when the cell or stack is cycled between fuel cell and electrolysis cell modes.314 Some degradation issues will be discussed in the following subsections.
6.1. Delamination of oxygen electrodes
Compared with that of the electrolyte or the fuel electrode, the degradation of the oxygen electrode appears to be more significant in cell/stack failure, particularly at high currents.90,315–318 The delamination of the electrode should be considered first,313 and the most widely observed phenomenon is delamination between the interface of the oxygen electrode and the electrolyte.319–322 Various models were developed in the literature to understand and explain the origins of delamination.312,321,323,324 According to Virkar's approach,321 high oxygen pressure in the oxygen electrolyte is one of the main causes of delamination. This model was also presented by Jacobsen and Mogensen.324 Additionally, Rashkeev et al.325 studied the mechanisms of oxygen electrode delamination on an atomic-scale using both DFT calculations and thermodynamic modelling. It was found that the stability and structure of the oxygen electrode were affected greatly by interdiffusion of various atoms across the electrode/electrolyte interface. Strategies such as placing an additional thin layer between the electrode and electrolyte to suppress the interdiffusion were proposed.
Regarding one of the most common oxygen electrodes, the LSM electrode, studies from Chen et al.154,272 showed that the disintegration of LSM particles and the formation of LSM nanoparticles at the interface of the electrode/electrolyte were the causes for the delamination of LSM oxygen electrodes. Furthermore, under the electrolysis polarization conditions, the lattice shrinkage-induced localized internal stress in the LSM grains contacted with the electrolyte could lead to the breaking of LSM particles and the formation of LSM nanoparticles.154 For instance, boron deposition and poisoning might lead to the delamination of the oxygen electrode, which was investigated by Chen et al.272,326,327 The presence of volatile boron species could greatly deteriorate the activity and stability of the oxygen electrode and damage its microstructure, as well as accelerate the delamination of the oxygen electrode from the electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 30. Moreover, similar delamination of the oxygen electrode could also be caused by impurities such as volatile chromium or sulphur, which will be discussed later.
 Fig. 30  TOF-SIMS elemental images (a) and line scan of the cross section of an LSM oxygen electrode after polarization.272 Reproduced from ref. 272 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2015. 
To solve this problem, some related investigations have been performed.90,317 Interestingly, it is found that the cathodic polarization, namely, operation in SOFC mode, could suppress the electrode degradation caused in SOEC mode. Hughes et al.317 presented the durability testing of solid oxide cell electrodes in reversing-current and found that the reversing-current operation could lower the delamination of the oxygen electrode and increase the lifetime of solid oxide cells. Excitingly, recently, 4000 hours of reversible operation performed by Graves et al.90 demonstrated that the electrolysis-induced degradation, which could lead to severe microstructure deterioration near the interface of the electrode/electrolyte, could be completely eliminated by reversibly cycling between SOEC and SOFC modes.
To interpret these favourable results, Hughes et al.317 proposed that there might have been a characteristic incubation time before the delamination of the oxygen electrode occurs. It is known that some unfavourable phenomena, i.e. the formation of oxygen bubbles, cation migration, nucleation of zirconate phase etc. might be interrupted by shortening cycle times, therefore, the degradation process could correspondingly be interrupted if the current-cycle period was decreased to no more than the incubation time. Graves et al.90 proposed that the periodic release of high oxygen pressure in SOFC mode could avoid the formation of oxygen bubbles and nanopores or even reverse those processes to prevent the degradation. Additionally, more recently, Chen et al.328 investigated the microstructural behaviour of LSM oxygen electrodes under cyclic cathodic and anodic polarization, presenting an interpretation for the above reversible operation, as shown in Fig. 31, the self-healing and regeneration of the interface under SOFC mode. As a consequence, in addition to adding a diffusion barrier between the oxygen electrode and electrolyte, or controlling some conditions such as adjusting oxygen pressure and avoiding impurity sources, reversing-current operation was also a promising approach to solve the problems related to the delamination of the oxygen electrode.

6.2. Cr poisoning of the oxygen electrode
Besides delamination, the poisoning of oxygen electrodes in solid oxide cells was also reported in the literature.252,329–337 Chromium (Cr), boron (B) and sulfur (S) are common volatile contaminants that damage the stability and activity of oxygen electrode performance. These are usually generated from the interconnect, the glass sealant and the air stream.272,326,327,329,330,333,338–345 In particular, Cr poisoning of SOFC or SOEC oxygen electrodes has been extensively investigated by researchers.331,333,335–337,343–351 Yildiz et al.314 summarized three possible degradation mechanisms: (1) the first mechanism is that chromium oxide from the interconnect can be primarily oxidized to form Cr6+-containing gaseous species including CrO3 or CrO2(OH)2. Cr-rich phases such as Cr2O3 can then be formed by the reduction of these Cr species at the TPB. As a result, the electrochemistry of the electrode is impaired, increasing the polarization impedance. (2) The second possible mechanism is that the dissociation of electrode materials and solid-state diffusion from Cr-rich species may cause Cr deposition on the oxygen electrodes. (3) The third mechanism as proposed by Chen et al.335 and Zhen et al.352 suggests that nucleation reactions of a nucleation agent and gaseous Cr species are both a kinetic limitation and a thermodynamic promotion for Cr deposition processes at the oxygen electrodes.
When compared to reported studies on SOFCs, there are actually much fewer reports involving Cr poisoning on the oxygen electrode of SOECs.52,320,330,342 Sharma et al.52 studied the degradation mechanism of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 (LSC) on oxygen electrodes and they presented a mechanism for Cr deposition as shown in Fig. 32a and b. However, more exact mechanisms concerning La–Cr–O phase formation and long-range diffusion of ions such as Co and Sr needs to be further clarified. More recently, Chen et al.330 studied the impacts of the interconnect, made of Fe–Cr alloy metals, on the degradation and delamination process of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) oxygen electrodes at 800 °C. According to the nucleation theory,331 the accelerated segregation of Sr can lead to the separation of SrO secondary phases on the outermost surface of the oxygen electrodes. Subsequent reactions related to depositions are presented in Fig. 32c and d. The results demonstrate that the nucleation and grain growth reaction of segregated SrO and gaseous Cr species can result in Cr deposition on oxygen electrodes.

6.3. SiO2 poisoning of the fuel electrode
As mentioned above, impurities are an important cause of degradation of fuel electrodes (especially Ni–YSZ electrodes) in co-electrolysis with SOECs.20,22,89,92,353,354 Studies268,355–358 reported that the location of Si-containing impurity phases was critical and had a serious harmful effect on the electrochemical properties of the fuel electrode and the performance of the system. Hauch et al.160,176 studied Si poisoning of fuel electrodes in SOECs. The results showed that the initial passivation of SOECs resulted from Si-containing species, which originated from the applied glass sealant and existed in a SiO2 form on the TPB of the Ni/YSZ fuel electrode. The results demonstrated that high steam partial pressure is the cause of SiO2 deposition. Additionally, the Si(OH)4(g) produced from the sealant was observed to be the main Si species source, where the equilibrium (Si(OH)4(g) ⇄ SiO2(s) + 2H2O(g)) was shifted to SiO2(s) formation in the relatively reducible area where most of the steam was reduced to H2.
More recently, the degradation mechanism of SOECs via modeling was investigated by Chatzichristodoulou et al.359 The process of SiO2 deposition at the Ni–YSZ TPB is illustrated in Fig. 33a–c, as silica can exist in the fuel electrode material as an impurity (typically, Ni–YSZ fuel electrodes).160,358 There are three conclusions as follows: (1) in highly humidified atmospheres, volatile Si is generated from the glass seal and is transformed into Si(OH)4(g) and subsequently into SiO2(s) at the TPB of the fuel electrode as shown in Fig. 33a; (2) under high cathodic polarization, Si may dissolve into Ni particles at the TPB further as shown in Fig. 33b using a yellow dotted arrow. According to the basic knowledge of physical chemistry, it is known that the maximum solubility of Si in Ni is about 14 mol% at 850 °C; namely, Si can exist in a metallic form; and (3) when the oxidation of the atmosphere is strong enough, the dissolved Si can be re-oxidized into SiO2(s) at a later stage as shown in Fig. 33c. In addition, the mechanism described above can be further confirmed by thermodynamic calculations, as shown in Fig. 33d.

6.4. Redox stability of the fuel electrode
Aside from impurity poisoning of fuel electrodes in SOECs, issues of reduction and oxidation (redox) can also cause instability in fuel electrodes (such as Ni–YSZ electrodes). Redox of Ni catalyst particles can cause volume changes in Ni–YSZ electrodes, leading to mechanical stresses accompanied by microstructural changes in the electrode, thus resulting in decreased fuel electrode activity. Hauch et al.160 carefully and systematically investigated the microstructure and degradation of Ni–YSZ electrodes. Their study found that significant microstructures were degraded in Ni–YSZ electrodes under conditions of high steam partial pressure and SOEC mode operation. Moreover, the degradation can be even more serious with high current densities. Electrolysis testing under conditions (2 A cm−2, 950 °C, and p(H2O) = 0.9 atm) was carried out and showed that the microstructures at the electrode/electrolyte interface were significantly changed, and can be ascribed to the relocation of Ni. The Ni could exist in Ni(OH)2(g) form under the conditions mentioned above and then a dense coverage of Ni on the electrolyte (YSZ) could be deposited according to the reaction of Ni(OH)2(g) + 4e− → Ni(s) + 2O2− + H2(g). Such relocation of Ni could consequently block oxygen transfer from the cathode to the electrolyte.
7. Summary, challenges and possible research directions
7.1. Summary
To facilitate the research and development of high temperature CO2/H2O co-electrolysis using SOECs, a comprehensive overview of developments during the last several decades as well as recent trends in co-electrolysis with SOECs for CO2 conversion and utilization are presented in this paper. The brief history, basic principle, economic analysis and SOEC application of CO2/H2O co-electrolysis are reviewed. The fundamentals of high temperature CO2 conversion through electrochemical approaches including thermodynamic and kinetics of CO2/H2O co-electrolysis are described. The cell and stack design, fabrication and scale-up are also considered. Particularly, key materials focusing on fuel electrodes and oxygen electrodes as well as current analytical methods of SOECs are classified and summarized in this paper. In addition, as one of the paramount challenges, the degradation phenomena of SOECs are presented and the corresponding mechanisms are discussed.
7.2. Challenges of SOEC technology
It seems that the technical maturity of co-electrolysis for CO2 conversion and utilization is still not sufficient to reach the requirements for practical implementation or commercialization. This is due to several major challenges, mainly including low activation/conversion efficiency of CO2 and degradation issues.
First, it is known that the activation of CO bonds in CO2 molecules is hindered by its nature from a thermodynamic and kinetic standpoint. The high chemical/electrochemical stability of CO2 is a basic contradiction for conversion. Although significant research into SOEC electrochemical reaction mechanisms such as H2 oxidation, H2O reduction and the ORR/OER have been reported, the mechanisms related to the CO2 activation process in SOECs have had little research. For CO2 electrochemical conversions, further fundamental understandings of the CO2 activation/conversion process in SOEC operation are needed.
Furthermore, the contradiction between the activity and stability of SOECs has not been fully understood. The typical issue is the degradation of materials as mentioned above. Significant degradation which can increase cell resistance is serious at high current densities even in state-of-the art SOECs. Structural degradation can be clearly observed in both oxide and fuel electrodes in particular. In the case of oxide electrodes, oxygen evolution can result in the weakening of the electrolyte/electrode interface which can also lead to delamination. With respect to fuel electrodes, poisoning and redox stability can result from the formation of nanoparticles and the loss of percolation.152 Importantly, although there are various degradation phenomena described by various proposed theories, the exact degradation mechanism still needs to be resolved and approaches to avoid this degradation at high current densities need to be developed.152 Furthermore, the life span of SOEC cells, especially at high current densities, is a more practical issue for commercialization as it is related to the operational costs of SOEC systems. Another further challenge for future large-scale application is the connection to other clean energy systems such as nuclear, wind, solar and so forth.
7.3. Proposed research directions
Regarding high temperature electrolysis, the research directions mainly focus on the improvements of electrolysis efficiency, long-term stability and economic feasibility. As identified, the co-electrolysis of H2O and CO2 to produce sustainable fuels using SOECs is a promising research area in high temperature electrolysis. To overcome these challenges mentioned above, several similar but more specific future research directions about fundamentals, stability, material development and economic feasibility are proposed as follows:

(1) Further fundamental understanding of the electrochemical reactions that occur in SOECs. 
The mechanism of CO2 electrochemical activation/conversion especially in co-electrolysis should be investigated through both experimental and theoretical modeling, in which the elementary reactions in the CO2 conversion process can be defined and the rate-limiting step can be controlled to overcome conversion barriers. For instance, the processes including adsorption/desorption, surface diffusion, and charge-transfer reactions etc. that occurred on the fuel electrode can be investigated to confirm the mechanism of H2O reduction or the nature of the rate-determining step. Additionally, to develop and implement in situ techniques including XCT, VT-STM, AP-XPS (ambient pressure-XPS), Raman and environmental TEM etc. can enhance our ability to study the mechanisms further. The structure, chemistry and functional properties at the active sites can be probed to study complex electrochemical reactions on electrodes, such as the oxygen exchange rates for composites and heterostructures. Furthermore, to better control the kinetics of CO2 electrochemical conversion reactions thermodynamically, simulation techniques including MD and DFT are also needed for calculating energy barriers or providing information about the structure, transport of ions and electrons, and even the electrode reaction mechanisms.


(2) Further fundamental understanding of degradation mechanisms and material behaviours in the electrolysis/co-electrolysis process. 
To date, material developments and fundamental studies of SOECs lag behind that of SOFCs significantly. Therefore, more technological progress needs to be achieved for further practical applications in co-electrolysis with SOECs. Improved fundamental understandings of degradation mechanisms and material behaviors are required to decrease degradation and even guide new material development, which can further promote progress and application of co-electrolysis. In particular, the delamination of oxygen electrodes, the impurities (Cr, SiO2) of the interface and the segregation (Sr) of constituents on ceramic electrodes are the long-standing issues that need to be studied. The corresponding degradation mechanisms should be confirmed and some effective methods need to be proposed after further research. Aside from experiments, computational theories at electronic, atomic and molecular levels need to be developed and applied in more in-depth investigations of degradation mechanisms and material behaviors in SOECs, such as the study of the mechanisms of oxygen electrode delamination using DFT calculations and thermodynamic modelling on an atomic-scale.


(3) More extensive research studies and developments on materials of SOECs is necessary. 
With regards to the development of SOECs, in addition to fundamental understanding, two main directions for enhancing material performances include modification or decoration of present materials, and development of advanced materials. Obviously, the electronic/ionic conductivity, stability/durability, thermomechanical matching, and economic feasibility of electrode and electrolyte materials are significant factors to consider. As discussed above, doping chemistry (doping or co-doping with Mn, Sr, Cr, Fe, Nd etc.) is a promising way to adjust and improve the electrochemical activity and stability of electrode materials. The design and manipulation by impregnation or in situ exsolution for electrode materials with advanced architectures need to be developed. Thus, various functionalities including ionic or electronic conductivity, mechanical support, electrocatalytic properties etc. can be mixed and added with flexibility in materials. Other advanced materials with heterostructures such as (La,Sr)CoO3−δ/(La,Sr)2CoO4−δ can greatly improve the performance of electrodes. In order to address the stability issue, the exploration of advanced materials used in lower temperature is also another possible and attractive direction. Furthermore, optimization of operating conditions such as high temperature environments, feed gas composition and pressure also need to be considered in further research.


(4) Improvement of economic and technological feasibilities for practical implementation of CO2 conversion to produce sustainable fuels with SOECs. 
With respect to this promising route, there are still obstacles for practical implementation or even commercialization with large-scale, long-term (more than several months) operation. Generally, the production price of hydrogen in high temperature electrolysis is competitive with low temperature alkaline electrolysis whereas it is higher than that of steam reforming of natural gas. Regarding other fuels, the production price of diesel via high temperature co-electrolysis using SOECs and further Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is comparable with current diesel production using fossil fuels, but higher than the production price of hydrogen via H2O electrolysis (production cost per MJ of total energy).152 It is known that the production price of fuels via high temperature co-electrolysis using SOECs is mainly dependent on electricity prices. Although some research studies for economic and technological feasibilities have been studied, it still needs to be further validated by more theoretical simulations and experiments before implementation to produce sustainable fuels. A promising direction is developing the connection between SOEC systems and other major sources of energy, including clean energy (e.g. nuclear, wind, solar energy, geothermal and tidal), fossil energy (e.g. coal), or waste energy (e.g. industrial waste heat and wind power curtailment), as well as to facilitate the integration of these energies into the electric grid. The implementation of this connection is not easy and requires worldwide government support.
