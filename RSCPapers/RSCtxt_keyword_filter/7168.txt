, Accepted 29th July 2014First published on 30th July 2014AbstractTiO2 microspheres with solid, core–shell and hollow chambers were synthesized by facile solvothermal alcoholysis. The TiO2 microspheres were encapsulated between TiO2 films comprising of tiny nanoparticles and used as a scattering layer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The resulting DSSCs showed increased cell efficiencies compared to those of pure TiO2 films without any scattering layers. DSSCs with hollow microspheres as scattering layer exhibited the highest photocurrent due to the enhanced light harvesting, which could be attributed to both the multiple reflections of light in the chamber and total internal reflections. Moreover, it also facilitated electron transfer and increased the lifetime of photocharges.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been explored for their potential as the next-generation solar cells.1–7 Previous studies have primarily focused on improving the cell efficiency using a scattering layer.1–7 Large size (>200 nm) TiO2 spheres encapsulated between two (10–30 nm) TiO2 thin films, comprising tiny nanoparticles have been designed as scattering layers for DSSCs to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η).8–14 The scattering layers that have been studied so far include solid,15–17 mesoporous,18 hollow,19–21 shell-in-shell,11 and flower-like22 microspheres as well as nanotubes,23,24 nanorods15,25 and other shapes.26–28 They usually induce internal light reflections, leading to enhanced light harvesting, which could generate more photocharges by activating the organic semiconductors (such as N719). Obviously, the spherical chamber structure also plays an important role in promoting the light harvesting and cell efficiency by enhancing the multiple light reflections and internal reflections.28,29 In certain cases, the chamber even induces total internal reflections. According to Snell's law, a total internal reflection occurs when a propagating wave strikes a medium boundary at an angle larger than a particular critical angle of the surface. If the refractive index of the material is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle of light is greater than the critical angle, the wave cannot pass through and will be completely reflected back. For example, total internal reflectance occurs at the TiO2/air boundary when incident light reaches an angle of 23.1° or more. However, such optical phenomenon has not been reported in studies of DSSCs. Moreover, the photoelectric exchange efficiency also strongly affects the cell efficiency. Obviously, the rapid electron transfer and the long lifetimes of photocharges result in high cell efficiency. Thus, a thorough study on how the chamber structure of the microspheres (from solid to core–shell to hollow structures) in scattering layers will affect the efficiency of DSSCs is important.
The synthesis of TiO2 spherical materials often relies on template approaches, such as hard or soft sacrificial templates.30–33 As an alternative, template-free approaches based on different mechanisms were also developed to synthesize hollow spheres with more complicated structures.34,35 Previously, we have designed solid, core–shell, and hollow TiO2 microspheres using a template-free method of polyalcoholysis under solvothermal conditions.36 Due to the enhanced light harvesting, and multiple light reflections in spherical chambers, both the core–shell and the hollow TiO2 microspheres showed higher activities than the solid TiO2 microspheres in the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. Herein, we introduced hierarchical TiO2 microspheres with a tunable chamber space as a scattering layer embedded in TiO2 nanoparticle films to form a boundary between two phases having different refractive index. Further investigations revealed that the scattering layer consisting of hollow TiO2 microspheres displayed the highest light harvesting abilities due to both the multiple light reflections and total internal reflections, leading to the highest photocurrent. Moreover, the scattering layer comprised of hollow microspheres also displayed lowest electric resistance and the longest lifetime of photocharges, leading to the highest photoelectric exchange efficiency.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of paste containing TiO2 microspheres
The TiO2 microspheres with tunable chambers were synthesized as previously reported.36 Typically, a clear solution containing TiOSO4, glycerol, alcohol, and ethyl ether (molar ratio = 1:16:40:11) was heated in a 50 mL autoclave at 110 °C for a certain period of time (2 hours for sphere, 2 days for core–shell, 14 days for hollow sphere). The precipitated powders were filtered, thoroughly washed with absolute ethanol, and dried at 100 °C. These samples were then mixed with terpilenol in a weight ratio of 1:10 and vigorously stirred for 4 h to form a viscous paste.
2.2 Preparation of pastes containing TiO2 nanoparticles
TiO2 colloidal solutions were prepared as reported in the literature:37 125 mL of Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 and 20 mL of isopropanol were mixed and then gradually added to 750 mL of distilled deionized water with vigorous stirring. Subsequently, 5.3 mL of 70% nitric acid was added to the mixture with continuous stirring. The mixture was then heated and maintained at 80 °C for 8 h. 13.2 g of PEG-10000 was added to the gel and allowed to dissolve. The resulting gel was concentrated under vacuum at 40 °C until the TiO2 weight percentage was approximately 10%.
2.3 Fabrication and measurements of DSSCs
To prepare DSSCs, working electrodes, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (2.3 mm thickness, 10 Ω sq−1, Yingkou-OPV Tech) was introduced as the current collector. FTO was first cleaned with acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and then thoroughly rinsed with water and alcohol. Then, the paste containing TiO2 nanoparticles was deposited onto the FTO glass by the spin-coating method at a speed of 2000 rpm. Each layer was gradually heated in a stepwise manner at 100 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min to obtain a uniform TiO2 film. Typically, 5 layers of the TiO2 films were coated onto FTO glass by repeating the same procedure for another 4 times. Then, the paste containing TiO2 microspheres was deposited onto the as-prepared TiO2 film using the same aforementioned method to form the scattering layer. Finally, the paste containing TiO2 nanoparticles was deposited onto the scattering layer using the same method to achieve the TiO2 anodes, followed by immersion into a 15 mM N719 (TCI) dye in anhydrous alcohol solution for 24 h. Subsequently, the dye-adsorbed TiO2 anode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell and sealed with a 30 mm thick spacer (Surlyn) after a drop of organic solvent-based electrolyte solution containing I−/I3− (Yingkou-OPV Tech) was introduced by vacuum backfilling.
3. Characterizations
The morphology and particle size were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HitachiS-4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, operated at 200 kV). The crystal structure was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-2000 with Cu Kα1 irradiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). The optical absorption properties was determined by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS, Shimadzu, UV-2450). The efficiency of DSSCs was measured by a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter with AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon light source and an AM-1.5G type filter. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency was measured using a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with AM-1.5G filter as a light source. The wavelength of the incident light was set using a motorized monochromator, and its power was calibrated with a Newport 77890 photodiode detector. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, CHI660D), applying a DC bias at open circuit voltage and an AC voltage of 5 mV under the irradiation of xenon light. An equivalent circuit model was used to fit the data with Zview software. Dye loading was measured by UV-vis spectrometer (XinMao, UV-7504) as reported.38
4. Results and discussion
The structural parameters of TiO2 nanoparticles used for preparing the pure TiO2 films, and the solid, core–shell and hollow microspheres used for preparing the scattering layers are summarized in Table S1.† As shown in Fig. 1, the FESEM morphologies revealed that the pure TiO2 film displayed a smooth surface comprising uniform anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with an average size of 7 nm (see the HRTEM images, indicating anatase crystal lattice and the particle size distribution pattern in Fig. S1†). The scattering layers deposited onto the pure TiO2 film clearly showed the microspheres of uniform size with solid, core–shell and hollow chambers, which were similar to the free states of TiO2 microspheres as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 2. The FESEM images in Fig. S2† demonstrated that the TiO2 anode containing the pure TiO2 film also exhibited a smooth top surface. After coating the scattering layer with an outer layer of the TiO2 film, most of the TiO2 microspheres were completely covered. A few TiO2 microspheres that were not completely covered by the outer TiO2 film still maintained a uniform size of the solid, core–shell, and hollow microspheres.

 Fig. 2  TEM images of (a) TiO2 nanoparticles, (b) free solid TiO2 microspheres, (c) free core–shell TiO2 microspheres and (d) free hollow TiO2 microspheres. 
The XRD patterns (Fig. 3) demonstrated that other than the presence of diffraction peaks at 2θ of 26.3°, 33.3°, 37.5°, 51.3°, and 65.3°, which are indicative of SnO2 in the FTO substrate (JCPDS 46-1088), both the pure TiO2 film and the TiO2 film containing scattering layers, comprising of tunable structured microspheres (solid, core–shell, and hollow), are present in the anatase phase, which is indicated by the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 23.5°, 48.0° and 53.9° (JCPDS 21-1272). These results were consistent with the HRTEM image (Fig. S1†).

The diffuse reflectance spectra in Fig. 4a revealed that before covering an outer layer of TiO2 film, the TiO2 anodes exhibited light reflectance abilities in the order of CS > HS > SP > TF in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm, which could be further confirmed by transmission spectra (see Fig. S3a†). The TF displayed the lowest light absorbance due to the absence of internal light reflections induced by the scattering layers. Both CS and HS showed stronger light absorbance than SP because the solid chamber could not induce multiple light reflections. CS exhibited higher light absorbance than HS due to more multiple light reflections in the core–shell chamber than those in the hollow chamber.11,22 Fig. 4b demonstrated that after covering the outer layer of the TiO2 film to form an internal boundary structure, the light absorbance in all the TiO2 anodes was greatly enhanced except for the pure TiO2 film. Simultaneously, the order of light reflectance ability slightly changed from CS > HS > SP > TF to HS-C > CS-C > SP-C > TF-C, which was also confirmed by the transmission spectra (see Fig. S3b†).

The above-mentioned results could be interpreted by considering the internal light reflections induced by the scattering layers. The following two equations are deduced from Snell's law and its transferring formula, where n1 and n2 refer to the index of anatase and air, while θi and θr refer to the angles of incident light and refracted light. Because of the big difference between Nanatase (2.55) and Nair (1.00), no light entered into the shell spaces, and the reflected light had the same intensity as that of the incident light. Thus, when light reached the boundary between the TiO2 film and the chamber space at an angle >23.1°, the light was forbidden from passing through the chamber and was completely reflected back into the TiO2 film (see Scheme 1a).

Scheme 1a illustrates the plausible light pathways in both the TiO2 sandwich-like layers, with and without scattering layers comprising TiO2 microspheres. When lights reached the pure TiO2 bilayers at an angle of 90°, almost all light passed through mostly because of the absence of scattering layers. When a scattering layer containing solid microspheres was added, light exhibited only scattering behavior. When core–shell and hollow spheres were added as scattering layers, light exhibited total internal reflections due to the angle of incidence being greater than 23.1°. The scattering layer comprising hollow microspheres exhibited stronger total internal reflections because the empty chamber lead to enhanced light harvesting. However, when there was no outer layer to cover the microsphere scattering layer, a sandwich-like structure (Scheme 1b) cannot be formed. In this case, the chamber in the microspheres could not form a boundary for total internal reflectance, and thus, only scattering behavior was observed.
The IPCE spectra for the four DSSC cells provide further evidence about the enhanced scattering effect of the sandwich type TiO2 structures. The IPCE spectra (Fig. 5) of the SP-C, HS-C and CS-C showed a considerable increase in the IPCE over the entire range of wavelengths in which the dye absorbed more effectively compared with TF-C. From these IPCE spectra, we could also clearly visualize the impact of this unique TiO2 structure on the light conversion efficiency of the lower energy photons in the long wavelength range. An enhancement could be observed in the light conversion efficiency, which should be attributed to the superior light scattering properties of SP microspheres and the enhanced multiple reflections (including the total internal reflectance) due to CS and HS, especially in the long wavelength region.

Fig. 6 shows the EIS of DSSCs with and without different scattering layers encapsulated in the bilayers of the TiO2 film. As shown in Fig. 6a, the Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra displayed three sets of semicircles. The small semicircle at a high frequency is related to the charge-transfer resistance (R1) at the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface, while the large semicircle at a low frequency corresponds to the electron transport resistance (R2) within the TiO2 layer and TiO2/electrolyte interface. The third semicircle corresponds to the Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (R3). The series resistance (Rs) is associated with the series resistance of the electrolyte and electric contacts in DSSCs.39,40 The fitting parameters, including Rs, R1, R2 and R3, obtained using the Zview software were shown in Table 1. The R1 values were similar for DSSCs with different scattering layers, possibly due to the same electrolyte and Pt counter electrode conditions. However, DSSCs with pure TiO2 films displayed a much higher R2 than those with the scattering layers and the R2 decreased from solid to core–shell to hollow microspheres, suggesting easier electron-transfer due to the high crystallization.

Fig. 6b shows the Bode phase plots of the EIS spectra for different DSSCs. As discussed in Chen's work, the maximum peak position at a low frequency (fmax) and the electron lifetime for recombination (τe) for the three DSSCs were calculated and are summarized in Table 1. τe was calculated according to the follow equation.41,42 
τe = ωmin−1 = (2πfmax)−1

Comparing to the fmax of 38.3 Hz for DSSCs without the scattering layer of TF-C, the fmax of the scattering layer of SP-C, CS-C, and HS-C are 31.6 Hz, 21.5 Hz, and 26.1 Hz, respectively. Obviously, the calculated electron lifetime τe slightly increased when the scattering layers were introduced. The low resistance and long lifetimes suggest the rapid electron transfer and low photoelectron–hole recombination.41
Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves, and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit density (Jsc) and conversion efficiency (EF) gradually increased from TF-C, SP-C, CS-C to HS-C, which could be attributed to the enhanced light intensity due to the presence of both multiple light reflections in the chamber and total internal reflections in the scattering layer between the two layers of TiO2 films.43 The fill factor (FF) values for the three types of DSSCs with different scattering layers were similar, while that of the TF-C was a little lower. The reason could be the enhanced light reflections. Simultaneously, both the rapid electron transfer and the long lifetime of photoelectrons could also enhance Jsc and further the EF. However, as shown in Table S2,† the thickness of these films was approximately 4 μm, and the absorbed dye amount decreased from TF, solid, core–shell to hollow microspheres, which limited the increase in Voc, Jsc and EF.43 Finally, DSSCs with the scattering layer comprised of hollow microspheres exhibited the highest EF (5.6%) due to the highest Jsc and Voc.

5. Conclusions
This work developed a new type of DSSCs with a scattering layer containing solid, core–shell or hollow TiO2 microspheres encapsulated by TiO2 films comprised of tiny TiO2 nanoparticles. DSSCs with hollow TiO2 microspheres as a scattering layer exhibited the highest cell efficiency due to rapid electron transfer, the long lifetimes of the photocharges, and in particular, the enhanced light harvesting resulting from both multiple light reflections in the chamber and total internal reflections within the sandwich-like structure. Other powerful DSSCs could also be designed based on the present investigation and method.
