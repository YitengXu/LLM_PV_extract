    , Accepted 7th June 2022First published on 7th June 2022AbstractDion–Jacobson (DJ) phase hybrid perovskites (HPs) have achieved impressive performance and high stability in optoelectronics devices. Despite that, research on the relationship between the structure and photoelectric properties of DJ HPs is still rare; particularly, the effect of diammonium cations with different conformations between the interlayers on the structure–activity relationship has not been reported. Herein, three kinds of DJ HP bulk crystals, BDAPbBr4 (1), 2AMPPbBr4 (2) and 2AMPYPbBr4 (3), have been constructed by interlayer cation engineering with the linear diammonium 1,4-butanediammonium (BDA), cyclic aliphatic diammonium 2-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (2AMP) and aromatic diammonium 2-(aminomethyl)pyridinium (2AMPY), respectively. These DJ HPs based on diammonium cations with different conformations exhibit diverse structures and optical and electronic properties. After an in-depth analysis, the photoelectric properties of these DJ HPs have been found to be significantly affected by the interlayer spacing, the insertion depth of the diammonium cations into the inorganic skeleton and the distortion degree of the inorganic layer. Finally, compound 3 constructed using the aromatic diammonium has been found to possess the shortest interlayer spacing (3.404 Å), the deepest insertion (1.147 Å) and the smallest distortion (173.7°), which afford it better photodetection performance (3.2 × 1011 Jones) than 1 (3.8 × 1010 Jones) and 2 (1.8 × 1011 Jones) under 405 nm irradiation. More importantly, it is precisely because of the rigidity and aromaticity of the 2AMPY cations that compound 3 has the best optical and photoelectric performance. These findings provide a foundation for designing optoelectronic devices with distinguished performance in the future.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) layered hybrid perovskites (HPs) are formed by introducing large-size spacer cations into the three-dimensional (3D) HP prototype, and have the characteristics of better stability, higher defect tolerance and greater tunability than 3D HPs,1–6 among which the (100)-oriented 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase7,8 and Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phase9–12 HPs are the most widely studied. DJ HPs with the general formula A′′An−1MnX3n+1 (A′′ is a diammonium organic cation; A is CH3NH3+ (MA), CH(NH2)2+ (FA), Cs+, CH3CH2NH3+ (EA) and so on; M is a divalent metal; X is a halide; and n is the number of inorganic octahedral layers) are constructed using diammonium cations and have better stability than 3D HPs and 2D RP HPs (A′2An−1MnX3n+1, where A′ is a monovalent organic cation) under thermal, light and moisture conditions, and have attracted much attention and interest in many fields.13–17 Particularly when compared with RP HPs, the introduction of diammonium cations eliminates the van der Waals gap between the adjacent unit cells and gives DJ HPs a more rigid structure, which brings the inorganic layer much closer and leads to a narrower interlayer spacing. Benefiting from the shortened interlayer spacing, the charge transfer barrier between the inorganic layer has been reduced and the photoelectric properties of DJ-type HP devices have also been improved.18 For example, Liu and co-workers reported a DJ HP solar cell device based on (ThDMA)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (ThDMA: 2,5-thiophenedimethylammonium, n = 5) with ultrahigh stability and a high efficiency of 15.75%.19 Moreover, the DJ HP (BAB)FAn−1PbnX3n+1, (BAB: 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)benzene) also shows better stability and an excellent external quantum efficiency (EQE > 5%) compared to the RP HP (PEA)FAn−1PbnX3n+1 (PEA: phenylethylammonium) in the application of field emission diodes.20 In addition to lead halide HP devices, solar cells based on the (4AMP)(FA)3Sn4I13 (4AMP: 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium) DJ HP also show a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.22% and excellent stability compared to other RP HP devices.21 However, in most cases, although the device efficiency and stability have been improved, research on the relationship between the structure and properties is not comprehensive. Particularly in the DJ HP system constructed using diammonium cations with different conformations, research about the effect of the interlayer spacers on the structure–activity relationship is still very rare. Firstly, there are a few kinds of DJ HPs that can obtain the exact single-crystal structure, and secondly, the photoelectric properties of these materials are mostly determined by their inorganic skeletons, so that the indirect effect of the interlayer spacers on the structure is ignored. Therefore, in order to conduct a detailed and comprehensive in-depth study of DJ HPs, crystallographic studies are essential to determine the electronic and optical properties of this series of materials.
Compared with DJ HPs, studies on the structure–activity relationship of RP HPs are more common. For example, Kanatzidis and Schaller reported the distance-dependence of Förster resonance energy transfer rates in RP HPs by controlling the organic spacing length.22 Ye and Luo's group synthesized 2D RP HPs with different alkyl chain lengths and studied the effect of the organic cation conformation on the carrier mobility and broadband emission.23 Recently, in the DJ HPs of the (NH3CmH2mNH3)(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (m = 4–9; n = 1–4) series, Kanatzidis and co-workers studied the effects of the carbon chain length (m) and the inorganic layer thickness (n) on the optical properties of the system, and their results show that the carbon chain length (m) has a great influence on the formation of perovskite thin films, among which the m = 8 films show an almost perfect orientation perpendicular to the substrate and exhibit the best thermal, light and air stabilities.24 These studies mentioned above show that interlayer organic cations have a significant effect on the structure–activity relationship of this series of HPs; however, they all focus on the effect of the carbon chain length of the interlayer organic cations on the structure and properties. We know that in terms of conformation, the interlayer organic cations can be linear chain alkyl amines, cyclic aliphatic amines or aromatic amines. These organic amines have their own characteristics; for example, in terms of appearance, linear amines have better flexibility and aromatic amines have stronger rigidity, while in terms of function, organic amines can also be classified depending on whether they contain chromophores. Thus, we believe that organic amines with different rigidities and functions also have an impact on the properties of HPs. However, research on the effects of interlayer diammonium cations with different conformations on the structure and properties of DJ HPs has not been reported.
Herein, three kinds of DJ HP bulk single-crystals, BDAPbBr4 (1), 2AMPPbBr4 (2) and 2AMPYPbBr4 (3), have been constructed by interlayer cation engineering with the linear diammonium 1,4-butanediammonium (BDA), cyclic aliphatic diammonium 2-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (2AMP) and aromatic diammonium 2-(aminomethyl)pyridinium (2AMPY), respectively. Due to the different conformations and characteristics of the interlayer diammonium cations, which lead to obvious differences in their structures, the optical and photoelectric properties of these compounds can be precisely regulated by interlayer cation engineering. Firstly, compound 1 is colourless while compounds 2 and 3 are yellow crystals. Secondly, the optical bandgaps of these compounds are 2.96 eV for 1, 2.82 eV for 2 and 2.67 eV for 3. Compared with compounds 1 and 2, compound 3 shows the best optical absorption and superior photodetection performance at 405 nm irradiation. This is mainly due to the rigidity and aromaticity of the interlayer aromatic diammonium cation 2AMPY, which leads to the shortest interlayer spacing (3.404 Å), the deepest cation insertion (1.147 Å) in the inorganic skeleton and the smallest inorganic layer distortion (173.7°), and thus compound 3 has the best photodetection performance (3.2 × 1011 Jones). In particular, it should be noted that only in compound 3 did the interlayer diammonium cations (2AMPY) participate in the contribution of the bandgap, which may also be one of the reasons why compound 3 has better optical properties. Therefore, interlayer cation engineering is an effective way to obtain 2D DJ HPs with distinguished photoelectric properties.
Results and discussion
Flake crystals of compounds 1 and 3 were synthesized according to the literature,25–27 while the crystals of compound 2 were obtained by regulating the stoichiometric ratio in concentrated hydrobromic acid (HBr) solutions through a slow evaporation method. Then, large crystals of compounds 1, 2 and 3 were grown by a temperature cooling method. The phase purity of these compounds was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) at 298 K (Fig. S1, ESI†), which coincided well with the simulated patterns from the single-crystal data. To deeply disclose the relationship between the structure and properties, we must start from the single-crystal structure data. As can be seen from Fig. 1a, d and g, compounds 1, 2, and 3 all adopt a monolayer DJ perovskite framework, exhibiting a monolayer arrangement of the interlayer bulky spacers BDA2+, 2AMP2+ and 2AMPY2+, respectively. This is also a remarkable feature different from RP HPs. Structure analysis shows that compound 1 belongs to the triclinic space group P and the unit cell parameters are a = 8.0135(4) Å, b = 8.4270(4) Å, c = 10.7367(5) Å, β = 69.5°, crystal 2 belongs to the orthorhombic space group Pbcn (Tables S1–S3, ESI†), having the unit cell parameters of a = 17.7922(9) Å, b = 16.4220(7) Å, c = 19.1417(11) Å and β = 90°, and compound 3 belongs to the orthorhombic space group Pbca with the unit cell parameters of a = 17.3865(6) Å, b = 8.2421(4) Å, c = 18.7283(9) Å and β = 90°. It can be seen from the above data that the organic cations with different conformations between the interlayers have a great influence on the space group and cell parameters of the system. In addition, due to the different size and flexibility of the interlayer diammonium cations, the internal structures of the three DJ HPs are significantly different. Firstly, on account of the difference in the diammonium cation conformations, the interlayer spacings of the inorganic layer are obvious discrepant, and are 4.036 Å for 1 (Fig. 1a), 3.666 Å for 2 (Fig. 1d) and 3.404 Å for 3 (Fig. 1g). The difference in the interlayer spacing is mainly due to the disparate rigidity of the diammonium cations. More importantly, a shorter interlayer spacing is conducive to reducing the energy barrier of charge transfer between the inorganic layers and improving the photoelectric performance of the system. Secondly, we define the cation penetration in these HPs as the average distance between the primary NH3+ and the plane of the terminal halogen atoms. The insertion depth of diammonium cations into the inorganic layer is also significantly different in the three compounds. In compound 1, the insertion depth of the cations is the shallowest (0.396 Å) (Fig. 1b), followed by that in compound 2 (1.070 Å) (Fig. 1e), and then in compound 3, the insertion depth of the cations into the inorganic layer is the deepest (1.147 Å) (Fig. 1h). The penetration depth of diammonium cations will affect the distortion of the global perovskite layer. We can use the Pb–X–Pb (X is halogen) bond angles to evaluate the degree of distortion of the inorganic perovskite layer.28,29 The more the Pb–X–Pb bond angles deviate from the ideal 180°, the more severe the distortion of the perovskite layer in the HPs. Subsequently, we compared the average Pb–Br–Pb bond angles in compounds 1, 2 and 3, which show that the average Pb–Br–Pb bond angles are 149.1°, 169.2° and 173.7° for 1, 2 and 3, as shown in Fig. 1c, f and i, respectively, as well as Table S4 (ESI†). In addition, the insertion depth of interlayer cations in to the inorganic layer will also affect the hydrogen bond between NH3+ and the axial halogen. If NH3+ penetrates deeper into the inorganic layer, the distance between NH3+ and the axial halogen becomes longer, which leads the hydrogen-bonding interaction becoming much weaker and the Pb–Br–Pb bond angles become larger.30 Moreover, it should be noted that the distortion level of the inorganic layer will affect the overlap degree of the metal s orbital and halogen p orbital. The more distorted the inorganic layer, the worse the overlap of the metal–halogen orbital, resulting in the poor optical activity of the compounds. The above analyses show that the conformations of the interlayer diammonium cations have a significant effect on the structure of the system, and that compound 3 based on the aromatic diammonium 2AMPY should have good optical activity.

The difference in crystal structure is bound to affect the properties of these DJ HPs. Subsequently, we studied the optical properties of compounds 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 2). Firstly, with regards to the colour of the obtained crystals, compound 1 is colourless, while compounds 2 and 3 are yellow crystals (Fig. 2a inset), which also leads to differences in their UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2a). Not surprisingly, compound 3, based on aromatic diammonium cations, has the best optical absorption performance, and its absorption cut-off edge is about 465 nm, which is better than those of compound 1 (420 nm) and compound 2 (440 nm). The optical bandgaps of 1, 2 and 3 are 2.96 eV, 2.82 eV and 2.67 eV, respectively, which were calculated through the Tauc method (Fig. 2b). Among the three DJ HPs, the light-absorption properties of the interlayer diammonium cations themselves are also significantly different. Compared with BDA and 2AMP, the light-absorption properties of the aromatic diammonium 2AMPY are significantly better than those of the aliphatic amines (Fig. S2, ESI†), which is due to the fact that 2AMPY contains both conjugated chromophores and an amidogen auxochromic group. These results also show that HP materials with excellent light-absorption properties can be obtained by accurately screening the interlayer cations. In order to further understand the electronic mechanisms of these DJ HPs, we performed a preliminary investigation into the potential contribution of the electronic structures using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 3). From Fig. 3a–c, we can see that all of the three DJ HPs are direct bandgap semiconductors, where the calculated bandgaps are 3.0 eV for 1, 2.89 eV for 2 and 2.70 eV for 3, which are consistent with the experimental values shown in Fig. 2b. The difference is that from the partial density of states (PDOS) diagrams, we can see that the valence bands (VBs) of compounds 1, 2 and 3 are composed of Pb 6s orbitals and Br 4p orbitals; however, the contribution to the conduction band (CB) of these systems is obviously different. In compound 3, the CB is mainly composed of 3AMPY cations, while in compounds 1 and 2, the CB is contributed to by Pb 6p orbitals. In previous studies, there have been similar reports on the contribution of aromatic amine cations to the CB of the system. For example, Jin and co-workers reported two 2D monolayer HPs (DPDA)PbI4 and (DPDA)PbBr4 (DPDA: N,N-dimethylphenylene-p-diammonium), which show that the conjugated diammonium cation may play a role in the electronic structure of HPs, especially in the contribution to the CB.31 In our recently reported 2D multilayer HP (3AMPY)FAPb2I7 (3AMPY: 3-(aminomethyl)pyridinium, FA: formamidine), the interlayer aromatic diammonium 3AMPY and the intralayer perovskitizers (FA) mutually participate in the contribution to the CB.9 Moreover, compound 3 has been reported by Lotsch, who studied its conductivity and mentioned that in all members of the (C6H10N2)PbX4 (X = Cl, Br and I) series, the CB only comprises states assigned to 2AMPY cations.32 In fact, the aromatic heterocycle (N-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole) in N-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole tetrachloro-lead also contributes to the CB of the system.33 Therefore, we boldly believe that the diammonium cations containing conjugated groups play a crucial role in the electronic structure of the system, which can directly participate in the contribution to the CB. This is one of the reasons why the HPs constructed using aromatic diammonium have better optical properties than those constructed using aliphatic diammonium. Therefore, not only does the size of the interlayer cations affect the structure–activity relationship of the system, the effects of the rigidity and aromaticity of the cations cannot be ignored either.

Next, we grew high-quality single-crystals and assembled devices to measure the photodetection performance of the three compounds under 405 nm irradiation. The crystal micromorphology of compound 3 has been characterized (Fig. S3, ESI†) through atomic force microscopy (AFM), which shows that crystal 3 possesses quite a few surface defects and grain boundaries. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, we can see that the dark current (Idark) of the devices is measured to be 2.75 × 10−12 A for 1 (Fig. 4a), 2.43 × 10−11 A for 2 and 2.87 × 10−11 A for 3 at a Vbias of 10 V. Under the illumination of 405 nm light, the photocurrent (Iph) of these devices increases significantly with the increase in the incident light intensity and applied bias voltage. However, compared with compounds 1 (5.8 × 10−9 A) and 2 (2.6 × 10−8 A), the Iph of compound 3 can reach 4.2 × 10−8 A under a bias of 10 V, which is much higher than that of the 2D multilayer HP (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Br10 (5 × 10−9 A).34 The switching ratio (Ilight − Idark/Idark) of the devices based on compounds 1, 2 and 3 are calculated to be 103, which is superior to those of the 3D HPs MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3.6 In addition to the switching ratio, the responsivity R (R = (Ilight − Idark/(P × S), where P is the intensity of incident light and S is the detector area between adjacent electrodes) and detectivity D* (D* = (Ilight − Idark)S1/2/[P × (2eIdark)1/2], where e is the unit electron charge) are also important indicators to measure the performance of devices. We calculated the R and D* of the three devices at different light power densities (Fig. 4d–f). Because of the photogating mechanism,35 both the R and D* values increase with the decrease in incident light power density for the devices based on the crystals of 1, 2 and 3. The results show that the photoelectric device based on compound 3 has better R (36 mA W−1) and D* (3.2 × 1011 Jones) values than the devices based on compounds 1 (R = 18 mA W−1, D* = 3.8 × 1010 Jones) and 2 (R = 23 mA W−1, D* = 1.8 × 1011 Jones) under the same conditions, and is also superior to the 2D triple-layer HP (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Br10 (3.6 × 1010 Jones).34 In addition to the influence of the rigidity of the aromatic diammonium on the structure and light-absorption performance, because the dielectric constant of aromatic amines (ε ∼3) is higher than that of aliphatic amines (ε ∼2), the exciton binding energy of aromatic-based HPs is relatively small, which is more conducive to the separation and transmission of photon-generated carriers when used in optoelectronic devices.30 Therefore, we conclude that π-conjugated molecules have a significant special impact on the photoelectric properties of HPs due to the excellent conductivity of π electrons and the rigidity and good planarity of the structure. Subsequently, the time responses of these devices were measured (Fig. S4, ESI†), which could reflect the ability to track the fast change of optical signals. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the device made using compound 3 exhibits the best rise and decay times of 224 μs and 310 μs, respectively. The rise and decay times of the devices based on compound 1 are 438 μs and 442 μs and are 450 μs and 320 μs for compound 2. Moreover, the stability test of device 3 is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). After 60 days in the air, the PXRD diffraction peak of compound 3 does not decrease significantly, and the photoelectric performance exhibits a slight decrease. These results show that compound 3 constructed using aromatic diammonium is a potential photodetection material. In addition to the above properties, we also studied the steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra of these compound (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). The sharp peaks of compounds 1 and 3 are in agreement with the bandgap trend and the exciton position at the band edge. Compared with 1 and 3, 2 shows the broadest emission in this series, which is due to the largest distortion of the PbBr octahedron in the crystal structure.36,37 Then, we calculated the distortion degree of the octahedron in the three crystals. The results show that the octahedron in compound 2 exhibits the largest distortion of 8.42 × 10−4, followed by that in compound 3 at 2.33 × 10−4 and 3.58 × 10−5 in compound 1. Moreover, compound 2 exhibits the longest lifetime among the three compounds (Fig. S7, ESI†). The longer lifetime and broader emission are due to the more distorted octahedral structure.

Conclusions
In summary, based on the different conformations of interlayer diammonium cations, such as their rigidity and aromaticity, we constructed three DJ-type HP photoelectric bulk crystals and studied the photodetection properties of these DJ HPs devices. From a linear amine and cyclic amine to an aromatic amine, the rigidity and aromaticity have been enhanced in turn, which is reflected in the great differences in the structure and properties of these DJ HPs. The crystal structure of compound 3 exhibits the shortest interlayer spacing (3.404 Å), the deepest insertion (1.147 Å) of the 2AMPY diammonium cations and the smallest distortion (173.7°) among the three DJ HPs, leading to it possessing the best optical absorption ability (λcut-off = 465 nm) and superior photodetection performance (3.2 × 1011 Jones) under 405 nm light irradiation. In addition, the interlayer aromatic diammonium 2AMPY also contributes to the bandgap of the system, which is one of the reasons why compound 3 has excellent photoelectric properties. In short, the introduction of aromatic diammonium not only widens the optical absorption range, but also improves the photoelectric performance of the device due to its unique aromaticity. These results show that photoelectric devices with excellent performance can be constructed through interlayer cation engineering.
Experimental
Materials and methods
All the reagents and solvents were purchased and used without further purification. The synthetic methods of the microcrystals of compounds 1 and 3 were based on the literature. For the synthesis of compound 2, C4H6O4Pb·3H2O (5 mmol) was dissolved in a hydrobromic acid solution (15 mL) with stirring for 10–15 min. Then, 2-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (5 mmol) was added to the mixed solution with continuous stirring and heating, until the solution became clear. Yellow crystals were obtained by slow cooling to room temperature. Large-size crystals of compounds 1, 2 and 3 were grown by the temperature cooling method from their saturated solutions with a cooling rate of 1 K per day.
Phase purity and crystal structure determination
The purities of the crystals of 1, 2 and 3 were verified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) using a MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was performed on a Bruker D8 Quesr/Venture diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.77 Å). The crystal structure of 2 was solved using direct methods and then refined by the full-matrix least squares refinements on F2 using the SHELXLTL software package. The crystal data and structural information are listed in Tables S1–S3, ESI.†
Calculations of the band structure and UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
The band structures and partial density of states were calculated using the single-crystal structure data using the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional for solids (PBEsol) scheme was adopted to state the exchange–correlation functional. The interactions between the ionic cores and the electrons were described by the norm-conserving pseudopotential. The following orbital electrons were treated as valence electrons: Pb 5d106s26p2; Br 4s24p5; C 2s22p2; N 2s22p3 and H 1s1. The numbers of plane waves included in the basis sets were determined by a cut-off energy of 510 eV. The other parameters and convergent criteria were the default values. The UV-vis optical absorption spectra of compounds 1, 2 and 3 were recorded at room temperature and a scan wavelength between 200 and 800 nm using a Lambda 950 UV-vis-IR spectrophotometer.
Photoelectric responses and conductivity
A smooth single-crystal with a complete morphology was selected to study the photodetection under 405 nm light irradiation, and the lateral photodetectors were fabricated on high-quality crystal wafers at room temperature, which eliminates the requirement of transparent electrodes and reduces the device fabrication complexity. The photocurrent curves were measured using a Keithley 6517B analyzer. The I–V curves were plotted in the voltage-scanning manner with a scanning rate of 2.5 V s−1. The response time was recorded using a high-speed Tektronix MDO3014 oscilloscope.
Steady-state and time-resolved PL measurements
An Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer was used for the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. The samples used in this test were dried, powdered polycrystalline. No filters were used during the TRPL measurements. The steady-state PL emission spectra were excited at 360 nm.
