    , Accepted 22nd May 2019First published on 23rd May 2019AbstractA novel non-fullerene acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured small molecule acceptor material with fused ring N-alkyl dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) as the central donor unit and ((2-(5,6-difluoro-)3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile) (EG-2F) as the terminal acceptor units, named DTP-C17-4F, was designed and synthesized. DTP-C17-4F demonstrates strong near-infrared absorption, suitable energy levels, a good film morphology and high electron mobility, resulting in an outstanding short-circuit current density of 21.17 mA cm−2 without additives for organic photovoltaics.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have the advantages of being light-weight and solution-processable, and can be fabricated into large-area flexible devices by roll-to-roll printing, which have developed rapidly in recent years.1 Benefitting from the development of new materials, the design of device structures, the optimization of the active layer morphology and the deeper exploration of interface engineering, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs has exceeded 15%.2 Compared with many fullerene derivatives, non-fullerene acceptor materials can easily adjust the absorption spectrum, energy level, morphology and electron mobility, thus greatly promoting the PCE of OSCs. Broadening the optical absorption spectrum of a material means increasing the absorption of photons, thereby improving the short-circuit current density (JSC) of a photoelectric conversion device, which is one of the most important strategies for improving the PCE of OSCs.
Currently, most of the organic donor materials have a main absorption range of 500–700 nm, and most non-fullerene acceptor materials have an absorption spectrum centred at 600–850 nm.3 The near-infrared region of the solar spectrum has not yet been utilized, which limits the substantial increase in the efficiency of OSCs. Designing new narrow band-gap materials has attracted widespread attention to further broaden the absorption spectrum of active materials. PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F4 based devices demonstrated outstandingly high efficiency in non-fullerene single junction OSCs. However, the absorption spectrum of IT-4F is limited to 600–850 nm. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel acceptor materials with strong near-infrared absorption. Many efficient molecular design methods can extend the absorption spectrum of conjugated polymers, such as the introduction of strong electron donating groups, forming quinoid structures and donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymers.5 The intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-rich unit to the electron-deficient unit can effectively tune the absorption spectra, and there was a report about a fused tris(thienothiophene) based non-fullerene electron acceptor (FOIC), which demonstrates strong near-infrared absorption extended to around 1000 nm.6 Besides, the fluorine atom in 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (EG-2F)4 can simultaneously reduce the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of organic semiconductors.7
In the past decades, a growing number of new π–π conjugated polymers and non-fullerene small molecule acceptors8 have markedly promoted the development of OSCs. Among the widely used building blocks, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) and its derivatives have become the mainstream units in both electron-withdrawing and electron-deficient semiconductors since 2007.9 DTP shows a superstrong electron donation ability, and its electron-absorbing nitrogen atom can increase its stability in the oxidized state and the material band gap can be further reduced. The incorporation of basic DTP units such as N-alkyl DTP,10N-acyl DTP11 and pyrrolobisthiazole (PBTz),12 as well as their derivatives including fused ring DTP,13 the lactam and imide conjugated heterocycles in the photovoltaic polymers and small molecules bestially enhanced the open circuit voltage (VOC), JSC, fill factor (FF) and final PCE of OSCs. DTP has the following advantages: a superior electron donating ability, good co-planarity, easy to adjust solubility and suitability for small molecule donor units. Furthermore, fluorine substitution can simultaneously reduce the HOMO and the LUMO of organic semiconductor molecules without causing deterioration of the absorption spectrum and carrier transport capacity of the material.7,14,15
In this work, an electron withdrawing unit, EG-2F, and an electron donating unit, N-alkyl DTP, were coupled to construct an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured narrow band gap small molecule acceptor 2,2′-((2Z,2′E)-((9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-9H-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrrole-2,7-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile, named DTP-C17-4F. In this molecular structure, two thiophenes are attached to the ends of the N-alkyl DTP to form an S,N-heteroacene fused ring structure, and the derivative structure of the fused ring DTP extends the conjugation of the molecule. Pyrrole and thiophene form a greatly rigid planar structure with strong planarity and self-assembly properties. In addition, the relatively small structure of thiophene does not cause steric hindrance, and is connected with the cyano group and the electron-withdrawing group of the fluorine atom in the terminal to give rise to a strong intra-molecular electron push–pull effect in the molecule. The introduction of an electron withdrawing group in a π–π conjugated semiconductor system can reduce the LUMO energy level for the π* energy of the cyano group, and the fluorine atom as an electron withdrawing group is close to the LUMO energy level of the π-conjugated system. These orbits can be effectively mixed to keep the LUMO energy level stable.16 The polymer with the N-alkyl DTP of the S,N-heterocyclic fused ring as the donor unit has high hole mobility and provides a theoretical basis for the synthesis of a novel red light absorbing acceptor material.5
The synthetic route of DTP-C17-4F is shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthesis procedures and characterization are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S1 and S2). The molecular structures of electron donor PBDB-T-2F and electron acceptor DTP-C17-4F are shown in Fig. 1a, and the absorption spectra of the obtained DTP-C17-4F in solution and in the film state are shown in Fig. 1b. DTP-C17-4F exhibits a main absorption band from 600 to 800 nm in chloroform solution, which is attributed to the intermediate core unit of the S,N-heteroacene fused ring, and the film absorption red-shifts about 100 nm with an absorption onset of 900 nm. The good π–π staking aggregation behaviour due to the introduced fluorine atoms is able to enhance the electrostatic interaction between molecules and π–π stacking. The tightly ordered π–π stacking structure can increase the JSC of the device. The absorption spectrum of DTP-C17-4F is broadly complementary to that of PBDB-T-2F as displayed in Fig. 1c. In addition, a PBDB-T-2F:DTP-C17-4F film can cover a wider and more complementary spectrum compared with a PBDB-T-2F:ITIC film (Fig. S3, ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO levels of DTP-C17-4F are determined to be −5.59 and −4.16 eV, respectively, by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (C-V) (Fig. 1d), lower than those of most non-fullerene acceptor materials. The downshifted energy levels are due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atom and the intra-molecular charge transfer effect. To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of DTP-C17-4F, conventional devices with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T-2F:DTP-C17-4F/ZrAcac (zirconium acetylacetonate)/Al structure were designed and fabricated as illustrated in Fig. 1e. PBDB-T-2F17 and DTP-C17-4F were used as the donor and acceptor materials for the active layer, and ZrAcac (zirconium acetylacetonate)18 was used as the electron extraction layer. The energy levels of the device are shown in Fig. 1f.

To enhance the performance of PBDB-T-2F:DTP-C17-4F based OSCs, the thickness and morphology of the photoactive layer as well as the cathode contact barriers of the devices were optimized. As shown in Fig. 2a, the OSC with an 80 nm photoactive layer demonstrates a JSC of 19.65 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.704 V, and a FF of 56.0%, resulting in a PCE of 7.75%. The optimal thickness for the photoactive layer depends on the trade-off between the light absorption and charge transport.19 To identify the effect of solvent additives on the device performance, 0.5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) were introduced into a PBDB-T-2F:DTP-C17-4F mixed solution, and the J–V curves for the devices are shown in Fig. 2b. Both VOC and JSC decreased after adding the solvent additives. In order to further improve the efficiency of the OSCs, different cathode buffer layers (CBLs), including Ca, PFN-Br20,21 and ZrAcac, were introduced. As depicted in Fig. 2c, the best-performing device based on ZrAcac shows a PCE of 8.94% with a VOC of 0.691 V, a JSC of 21.17 mA cm−2, and a FF of 61.1%. The JSC values calculated from the EQE curves of the different cathode buffer layers displayed in Fig. 2d and Fig. S4 (ESI†) are quite consistent with the JSC values derived from the J–V curves within 5% deviation and the detailed photovoltaic parameters and the integrated JSC values are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S5 (ESI†).

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) tests were conducted to investigate the photoactive layer morphology change with the different additives. Fig. 3a shows the topographic surface morphology of the PBDB-T-2F:DTP-C17-4F layer without any additive, giving a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.76 nm. It can also be seen from the phase image (Fig. 3d) that the photoactive layer without any additive is densely uniform, forming a continuous phase region with relatively small size. When adding small amounts of DIO or CN to the PBDB-T-2F:DTP-C17-4F solution before film deposition, the surface morphologies of the obtained films greatly change, and the RMS roughness values increase to 2.51 nm (Fig. 3b) and 3.47 nm (Fig. 3c) respectively. These morphological changes can be further confirmed by AFM phase images (Fig. 3d and e). After adding 0.5 vol% DIO into the PBDB-T-2F:DTP-C17-4F solution, tiny particles appear on the surface of the obtained film (Fig. 3b), and the domain sizes of the donor and acceptor increase (Fig. 3e), which increases charge transportation. We measured the charge carrier mobilities in the PBDB-T-2F:DTP-C17-4F blends with and without the additives. As shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1 (ESI†), the μe/μh values for the devices without additives and with 0.5 vol% DIO are 14.87 and 22.71, respectively. The higher μe/μh value increases charge recombination and results in a lower FF of 50.1%. Similarly, after adding 1 vol% CN into the active layer solution, the surface of the obtained film shows larger particles (Fig. 3c and f), and the obvious phase separation between the donor and acceptor can be observed. This results in a decrease in the exciton separation interface and an energy loss22 when the charge generated; hence, the JSC of the device is greatly reduced.

To investigate the effects of CBLs on device performance, we performed a light intensity dependence test and an exciton dissociation efficiency test. The power-law exponents of the equation Jph ∝ Pslight for DTP-C17-4F-based devices are 0.96, indicating that the device with ZrAcac as the CBL can effectively suppress bimolecular recombination (Fig. 4a). The Jph/Jsat ratios calculated from the photocurrent dependence on effective voltage (Veff)23 of the three different CBLs are 0.89 for ZrAcac, 0.83 for PFN-Br, and 0.81 for Ca (Fig. 4b), indicating that the device with ZrAcac as the CBL is the most effective in the entire exciton dissociation and charge collection process. This is consistent with the fact that the device with ZrAcac as the CBL demonstrates a higher JSC of 21.17 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.1% higher than those of Ca and PFN-Br based devices.

In summary, a novel A–D–A structured narrow band gap small molecule acceptor, DTP-C17-4F, was successfully synthesized by an intra-molecular push–pull effect between fused ring N-alkyl DTP and terminal group EG-2F. DTP-C17-4F shows HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.59 eV and −4.16 eV, respectively, with an optical band gap of 1.38 eV. Using different CBLs, a high JSC of 21.17 mA cm−2 was achieved. The optimal device efficiency reaches a PCE of 8.94%. These results indicate that the fused S,N-heterocyclic structure can effectively adjust the molecular energy level and the band gap of the material, which provides a new choice for material design with near infrared absorption.
