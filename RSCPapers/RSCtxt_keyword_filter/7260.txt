    , Accepted 10th January 2014First published on 10th January 2014AbstractWO3 is a promising candidate for a photoanode material in an acidic electrolyte, in which it is more stable than most metal oxides, but kinetic limitations combined with the large driving force available in the WO3 valence band for water oxidation make competing reactions such as the oxidation of the acid counterion a more favorable reaction. The incorporation of an oxygen evolving catalyst (OEC) on the WO3 surface can improve the kinetics for water oxidation and increase the branching ratio for O2 production. Ir-based OECs were attached to WO3 photoanodes by a variety of methods including sintering from metal salts, sputtering, drop-casting of particles, and electrodeposition to analyze how attachment strategies can affect photoelectrochemical oxygen production at WO3 photoanodes in 1 M H2SO4. High surface coverage of catalyst on the semiconductor was necessary to ensure that most minority-carrier holes contributed to water oxidation through an active catalyst site rather than a side-reaction through the WO3/electrolyte interface. Sputtering of IrO2 layers on WO3 did not detrimentally affect the energy-conversion behavior of the photoanode and improved the O2 yield at 1.2 V vs. RHE from ∼0% for bare WO3 to 50–70% for a thin, optically transparent catalyst layer to nearly 100% for thick, opaque catalyst layers. Measurements with a fast one-electron redox couple indicated ohmic behavior at the IrO2/WO3 junction, which provided a shunt pathway for electrocatalytic IrO2 behavior with the WO3 photoanode under reverse bias. Although other OECs were tested, only IrO2 displayed extended stability under the anodic operating conditions in acid as determined by XPS.
Introduction
One promising approach to overcome the intermittency of the solar resource and enable widespread use of solar energy is to store it as an energy-dense fuel derived from the photoelectrolysis of water.1–3 Perhaps the most efficient way to generate the necessary photovoltage of >1.5 V (thermodynamic voltage plus catalytic overpotentials) while making use of the majority of the solar spectrum is to utilize a tandem cell configuration.4,5 In a photoelectrochemical cell without significant corrosion-preventing barrier layers, this scheme requires a reductively stable photocathode and an oxidatively stable photoanode of complementary band gaps.
In theory, such a system could run at any pH, but a cell at neutral pH conditions must deal with the overpotential losses associated with local pH changes at the active sites as well as the eventual formation of a bulk pH gradient, even in the presence of buffer solutions.6 These overpotential losses are mitigated at more extreme pH conditions. Operation in a strongly basic electrolyte is desirable for the increased activity of earth-abundant catalysts at high pH,7 but current options are limited for alkaline-stable light absorbers with favorable band gaps and conductive, stable alkaline ion exchange membranes.8,9 At low pH, Si,10 InP,11 and WSe212 are promising reductively stable photocathodes and Nafion, a conductive proton exchange membrane, can meet the operational criteria for a successful product separator in a water-splitting system.13 However, there are relatively few candidate materials for an acid-stable photoanode with an appropriate band gap.
Tungsten trioxide, WO3, an earth-abundant, oxidatively stable semiconductor, is one such material that could fulfill the role of photoanode.14–24 In most deposition methods, the presence of oxygen vacancies serve as shallow electron donors and naturally dope the WO3 n-type.25 Its band gap of 2.6 eV is higher than ideal for the large band gap absorber in a tandem cell. However, N substitution of O atoms in the lattice has been demonstrated to reduce the band gap to as low as 1.9 eV by the addition of N 2p states above the WO3 valence band, although significant work still remains to achieve a corresponding improvement in stable photocurrent.26–29
Unlike most metal oxides, WO3 is thermodynamically stable in acidic electrolyte (pH < 4). At higher pH, OH− ions induce chemical dissolution by the reaction WO3(s) + OH− → WO42− + H+.30,31 Even in acidic conditions, some photocorrosion of WO3 has been observed due to the formation of peroxo-species as intermediates during water oxidation.22–24,32 Although peroxide formation and the oxidation of most acid counterion species are reactions that are thermodynamically less feasible than water oxidation, the kinetics of these reactions are often more favorable than oxygen evolution.14 The photogenerated minority-carrier holes in the valence band of WO3 have a potential of ∼2.97 V vs. NHE at pH 0.33 This potential is sufficient to drive many competing reactions, thus limiting the faradaic oxygen evolution efficiency on bare WO3. Researchers have demonstrated enhanced photostability of WO3 near neutral pH by annealing in a hydrogen environment34 and by adding thick coatings of an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) to reduce the required oxygen evolution overpotential and kinetically favor water oxidation over peroxo-species formation.21
The selectivity for water oxidation of WO3 photoanodes without a co-catalyst depends strongly on the electrolyte species and pH. No O2 formation is observed in HCl or acetic acid solutions and O2 yields decrease with decreasing pH in H3PO4 and H2SO4.14 In strongly acidic media, the photocurrent that does not contribute to water oxidation or peroxo-species formation has been ascribed mainly to oxidation of the acid counterion (i.e., the conversion of 2Cl− to Cl2 in HCl or of 2SO42− to S2O82− in H2SO4).35
To our knowledge, the effects of OECs on the branching ratio for O2 production relative to SO42− oxidation on WO3 in H2SO4 has not been investigated. Furthermore, since the catalyst deposition method is known to have a significant impact on the charge-transfer in other semiconductor photoelectrodes, its effect on WO3 is of considerable interest. In the work reported here, we investigate the faradaic oxygen production efficiency for IrO2 on WO3 in acid and explore the effect of the method of catalyst attachment on the photoelectrochemical energy-conversion behavior.
Experimental
WO3 electrode fabrication
Thin films of WO3 were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, TEC 15) coated glass substrates (Hartford Glass Company Inc.) by an RF sputtering method.36 A W metal target (Lesker, 99.95%) was used in an AJA International sputtering system at 200 W on an RF source for 2 h at 200 °C under a constant flow of 16.0 sccm Ar and 4.0 sccm O2 while maintaining an overall pressure of 10 mTorr. Part of the FTO glass slide was masked off during sputtering for later contacting during electrode fabrication. After sputtering, the WO3 thin films were then annealed at 400 °C in air for 2 h to improve the crystallinity. Catalysts were then deposited by various methods (see below), and the sample was made into an electrode by contacting a Cu wire to the exposed FTO with Ag paint, then putting the wire in a glass tube and sealing the exposed wire and FTO surfaces in epoxy. The exposed area of catalyst/WO3 was ∼1 cm2 in all cases, with the same area exposed on either side of the glass slide to enable either front or back illumination. WO3 on W foil electrodes were fabricated in an identical fashion, substituting W foil (Alfa Aesar) for FTO/glass and completely encasing the back of the electrode in epoxy since back illumination through the metal foil was not possible.
Catalyst deposition
For the spin-coated, sintered catalyst electrodes, IrO2 was deposited onto thin WO3 films by spin-casting a metal salt solution and then sintering to achieve the oxide form.37 An iridium chloride (IrCl3·xH2O, 99.9%, Strem Chemicals) solution at 0.025 M in ethanol with 0.15 g of Triton X-100 surfactant per mmol of Ir was drop-cast on a cleaned FTO glass slide then spun at 5000 rpm for 90 s. The film was sintered to IrO2 by annealing in air at 400 °C for 30 min. For electrodes with 2 coats of spin-coated IrO2, the process was repeated a second time. Analogous electrodes of IrO2 directly on FTO glass were produced by the same method. Photoelectrodes using a simple approach to drop-cast and sinter catalyst from solution on WO3 were tested as well (see ESI†).
For the sputtered catalyst electrodes, IrO2 films were sputtered from an Ir metal target (≥99.9% from ACI Alloys, Inc.). The catalyst layer was sputtered onto the WO3 film from an RF source at 200 W at 300 °C under a constant flow of 3.0/3.0 sccm Ar/O2 while maintaining an overall pressure of 5 mTorr. Two different thicknesses of catalyst were produced by sputtering for either 0.5 min (<10 nm) or 30 min (>100 nm). Analogous electrodes of IrO2 directly on FTO glass were produced by the same method.
For electrodeposited catalyst electrodes, a literature method was used to electrodeposit IrO2.38 An aqueous electrodeposition bath of 20 mM oxalic acid and 4 mM K3IrCl6 was adjusted to pH 10 with Na2CO3 and aged for >10 days.38 IrO2 was then anodically electrodeposited (with a Ag/AgCl reference and a fritted Pt gauze counter electrode) onto ∼1 cm2 of WO3 on FTO at 0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl until 400 mC of charge had passed. The potential was selected to provide ∼300 μA cm−2 on FTO, the same current density as the published method. Both as-deposited and annealed (400 °C for 1 h in air) electrodes were tested. Analogous electrodes of IrO2 electrodeposited directly on FTO glass were produced by the same method. A second IrO2 electrodeposition procedure was tried as well (see ESI†).39
Drop-cast particulate IrO2 on WO3 was also fabricated and tested (see ESI†).
Photoelectrochemical J–E measurements
Current density vs. potential (J–E) photoelectrochemical energy-conversion behavior for all electrodes was measured in 1 M H2SO4 (made with 18 MΩ cm H2O) under stirring with the FTO/glass slide as working electrode, a Pt gauze counter electrode separated from the main cell compartment by a glass frit, and a Ag/AgCl, KCl (saturated) reference electrode (CH Instruments, Inc.) in a glass cell with a flat quartz window for illumination. The potential was scanned at 30 mV s−1 between 0.2 and 2.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl and the data collected using a Bio-Logic SP-200 potentiostat. The data reported herein is for the second scan on each electrode. Electrochemical measurements were referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the equation: VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.197 + pH(0.059), with the pH for 1 M H2SO4 = 0. Simulated sunlight at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at normal incidence to the working electrode was generated with a 150 W Xe lamp (Newport 6255) coupled with an AM1.5 global filter (Newport 81094) and calibrated in the electrolyte with a Si photodiode (Thorlabs FDS100-CAL). Under front illumination, the light was incident on the catalyst layer, while under back illumination the light passed through the transparent substrate to the WO3 without passing through the catalyst layer (Fig. S1, ESI†).
O2 measurements
The O2 concentration was measured in the electrochemical cell using a fluorescence-based oxygen sensor (NeoFox, Ocean Optics) with the optical fiber inside a sealed glass tube inserted into the electrolyte with an O2-sensitive fluorescent patch (HIOXY, Ocean Optics) on the outside of the glass tube. The oxygen sensor was calibrated against an air-saturated solution of 1.0 M H2SO4(aq), using an O2 solubility of 7.7 mg L−1 under 0.21 atm of O2(g) partial pressure.40 The cell electrodes (catalyst/WO3 working, fritted Pt gauze counter, Ag/AgCl reference) and oxygen sensor were sealed tightly using thermometer adapters (Ace Glass) and the cell was completely filled with electrolyte to avoid any headspace volume. Before measurement, the electrolyte was purged with UHP Ar(g) for >30 min. During measurement, the working electrode was kept at open-circuit potential for 10 min, then maintained at the water oxidation potential (1.2 V vs. RHE) for 30 min, and then again held at open-circuit potential for another 10 min, with the cell under illumination and stirred vigorously. The illumination intensity was adjusted to provide sufficient current without any noticeable bubble formation (generally <1.5 mA cm−2). To minimize noise and drift in the oxygen sensor measurement, the fluorescent patch was blocked from the path of the incident illumination and an infrared water filter (Newport 61945) was used in conjunction with the Xe lamp to minimize heating in the electrolyte. The ambient O2(g) leak rate into the cell was established by analyzing the response during the periods at open-circuit and subtracting it from the total response. Faradaic oxygen production efficiency, ηO2, was estimated by comparing the measured O2 output after 30 min of oxidation to the accumulated charge passed assuming 100% O2 yield.
Fast one-electron redox couple measurements
WO3 on W foil electrodes were used for measurements in a ferro-/ferricyanide electrolyte. A Pt mesh counterelectrode (without a frit) and a Pt wire reference poised at the solution potential were used in a 0.35 M K4Fe(CN)6–0.05 M K3Fe(CN)6(aq) (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution under vigorous stirring.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
All spectra were collected on a Kratos Axis Ultra system (base pressure 10−9 Torr), with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source at a power of 150 W. A pass energy of 80 eV was used for survey scans and 10 eV for all high resolution spectra. Photoelectrons were collected at surface normal with a hemispherical analyzer. The photoemission energy scale was calibrated to the adventitious C 1s peak (set to 284.8 eV) measured for each sample. All peaks were fit using Casa XPS software with a Shirley background and symmetric Voigt lineshapes that were 70% Gaussian and 30% Lorentzian product functions.
Electron microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Nova NanoSEM 450 (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with a Tecnai F30ST system (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) at a voltage of 300 kV. To prepare IrO2/WO3/FTO/glass cross-sections for HRTEM and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), the excess glass was cut and polished to ∼100 μm and further thinned using a dimpler and then ion mill to reach a thickness of ∼100 nm. The cross-sectioned samples were then mounted onto 50 μm single slot Ni grids for imaging.
Results and discussion
IrO2 on WO3 contact with fast, one-electron redox couple
A fast, one-electron redox couple that can transfer charge with the electrode without significant kinetic limitations is a useful diagnostic tool to investigate the IrO2/WO3 contact. The ferro-/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)64−/3−) redox couple was used for this purpose. Without the kinetic limitations of water oxidation, pathways allowing the electrolyte to encounter the back contact would result in shunts that can dominate the J–E behavior. To prevent shunting, WO3 was deposited on W foil substrates and subsequently annealed in air to ensure that only WO3 was exposed to solution. For water oxidation studies in aqueous sulfuric acid, FTO/glass substrates were used instead to enable back illumination. In 1 M H2SO4 under front illumination, WO3/W foil photoanodes produced similar photoelectrochemical performance to WO3 on FTO/glass (Fig. S2a, ESI†).

Fig. 1 shows the dark electrochemical behavior of these electrodes in the ferro-/ferricyanide solution. Bare W foil displayed characteristic ohmic behavior, reaching limiting anodic and cathodic currents resulting from mass transport limitations of the redox species to the electrode surface.41 Annealed WO3 on W foil, however, resulted in diodic J–E behavior indicative of a semiconductor supporting a built-in electric field due to Fermi level equilibration with the redox species. This behavior demonstrated the lack of shunting in the WO3/W foil electrodes.

Upon sputtering a thick IrO2 layer on a WO3/W foil electrode (while carefully masking the IrO2 to ensure deposition only on the WO3 and to avoid edge effects), the electrochemical response in ferro-/ferricyanide reverted to behavior characteristic of an ohmic contact. This data suggests the junction between the IrO2 catalyst and the WO3 photoanode is quite ohmic. With a conformal, compact IrO2 layer, the IrO2/WO3 interface would be predicted to control the junction and produce little photocurrent. Likewise, a low energy barrier between the catalyst and semiconductor implies that the IrO2 can shunt through the WO3 to the back contact, which makes electrocatalytic current at higher potentials possible even though the photodiode should be in reverse bias (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Similar behavior has been reported for IrOx on other metal oxide photoanodes.42 Direct solid-state contact measurements of IrO2 on WO3 also suggested ohmic behavior (Fig. S3, ESI†).
Sintered IrO2 on WO3 photoanodes
A simple method for uniform heterogeneous catalyst attachment is to spin-coat solutions of metal salts onto the electrode and then sinter them.37 Sintering produced the catalytically active metal oxide form of the OEC adhered to the semiconductor surface. IrO2, although not earth-abundant, was the primary catalyst of interest in this study owing to its known high activity for water oxidation and stability in acid. Co3O4 and RuO2 were also initially investigated with some attachment methods (see ESI†) but neither is stable in strongly acidic media.43

Fig. 2 shows the photoelectrochemical current-density vs. potential (J–E) behavior for a spin-coated, sintered IrO2 on WO3 photoanode as compared to bare WO3 or sintered IrO2 on the FTO/glass. While higher photocurrents from bare sputtered WO3 films have been reported (although with significant reproducibility issues attributed to such factors as choice of W sputter target),44 the effect of catalyst attachment, rather than maximized photocurrent, was the main purpose of this study. The WO3 photoelectrochemical behavior observed herein is consistent with results reported by other groups in sulfuric acid electrolyte.14,35 For one layer of spin-coated, sintered IrO2 (∼1 nm thick) on WO3 (Fig. 2a), the back-illuminated photocurrent at 1.5 V vs. RHE was comparable to that for bare WO3; however, under front illumination the photocurrent was reduced due to parasitic light absorption in the catalyst layer (Fig. S9, ESI†).45 At >1.5 V, the current increased exponentially which indicated the presence of a shunt allowing the electrocatalytic response of IrO2 to dominate, consistent with the observations using a fast, one-electron redox couple. Additionally, the open-circuit potential shifted from 0.53 V to 0.65 V vs. RHE upon the attachment of the sintered catalyst layer, a 120 mV reduction in photovoltage. The decrease in the open circuit voltage and photocurrent shows that the spin coating and annealing of IrO2 on WO3 degraded the photoelectrochemical junction compared to pure WO3.

Also shown is (b) the effect of catalyst thickness by comparing (blue lines) bare WO3 to (green lines) one coat of IrO2 to (purple lines) two coats of IrO2, all under back illumination. 
Despite the decreased J–E performance, these electrodes increased the O2 yield from 0% for bare WO3 to 82% for one coat of sintered IrO2 (Table 1). Hence, although the sintered IrO2 layer had an adverse impact on the photoelectrochemical junction, the active catalytic sites increased the branching ratio for water oxidation relative to sulfate oxidation.

A second layer of spin-coated, sintered IrO2 (Fig. 2b) further degraded the photoelectrochemical response, reducing the photocurrent significantly. This reduction occurred under both front and back illumination, indicating that changes to the junction, rather than parasitic catalyst light absorption, account for the decreased performance. Much thicker sintered IrO2 on WO3 photoanodes, fabricated by drop-casting the catalyst layer rather than spin-coating, were observed to be photo-inactive (Fig. S5, ESI†). These observations are consistent with the explanation that as the sintered catalyst layer becomes thicker and more contiguous, the junction is increasingly dominated by the IrO2/WO3 interface rather than the WO3/liquid electrolyte, leading to a significant reduction in the barrier height and resultant photoresponse.
Sputtered IrO2 on WO3 photoanodes
Reactive sputtering of a metal target in the presence of an oxygen partial pressure allows the deposition of a thin film of a metal oxide without a post-processing annealing step. This catalyst attachment method provides a high surface coverage in which the metal oxide can be controllably deposited in a thin enough layer to enable a high optical transparency. Thin films (<10 nm) of IrO2 were deposited onto WO3 photoanodes by sputtering for 0.5 min, and thick films (>100 nm) were analogously made by sputtering for 30 min. XPS spectra of the resulting sputtered films confirmed the presence of the expected IrO2 composition (Fig. S6, ESI†). These two extremes of thickness ensured that in one system a significant amount of light would pass through the catalyst layer during front illumination while the other provided the ideal catalysis achievable with a sputtered film.

Fig. 3 shows the J–E behavior for sputtered IrO2/WO3 photoanodes. Unlike the behavior with sintered catalyst layers, even for thick sputtered IrO2 layers the performance under back illumination was comparable to the photocurrent achieved with bare WO3 (Table 1), demonstrating that sputtered IrO2 did not detrimentally affect the photoelectrochemical junction of the photoanode. Even a thin sputtered catalyst layer, however, caused significant parasitic light absorption as evidenced by the reduced photocurrent during front illumination. 30 min sputtered IrO2 layers were optically opaque at this thickness, and the photoelectrodes yielded essentially no photocurrent when illuminated from the front side. Again, onset of the electrocatalytic wave at >1.4 V vs. RHE when the photoanode is in reverse bias was indicative of a shunt to the catalyst. Annealing the sputtered IrO2/WO3 photoanodes at 400 °C in air under the same conditions used for sintered IrO2 did not significantly affect the photoelectrochemical performance (Fig. S10, ESI†).

Performance is shown for (green lines) back illumination, (red lines) front illumination, and (gray lines) in the dark, with (blue lines) bare WO3 under illumination and (black lines) the catalyst by itself in the dark for reference. 

Fig. 4 shows the variation in morphology of IrO2 layers. The top-down SEM images showed that sintered IrO2 layers on WO3 were more contiguous and compact as compared to the bare WO3 (Fig. 4a) surface as the catalyst layer became thicker from spin-coated (Fig. 4b) to drop-cast (Fig. 4c) IrO2. Thick, sputtered IrO2 films consisted of catalyst platelets on the order of ∼100 nm (Fig. 4d). However, TEM results for sputtered IrO2/WO3 electrodes demonstrated the polycrystalline nature of the sputtered deposit, with grain sizes of ∼1 nm (Fig. 4g and Fig. S11, ESI†). This difference in catalyst layer morphology may be a possible explanation for the observed differences in photoelectrochemical behavior between sintered and sputtered IrO2 layers on WO3 photoanodes. As a more compact film, even a thin, conformal layer of sintered IrO2 (Fig. 4e and f) may be enough to interfere with the interfacial energetics of the system and ensure that the IrO2/WO3 contact dominates the junction rather than the WO3/solution junction. The sputtered films on WO3, however, appear more porous (Fig. 4h). This porosity may enable the electrolyte to permeate through the catalyst layer to the WO3 surface and into the nanoporous bulk of the WO3. The liquid electrolyte/WO3 interface then gives rise to band bending and J–E performance comparable to bare WO3 despite >100 nm of sputtered IrO2 at the surface.

Previous work has established that WO3 photocurrent in highly acidic electrolyte is not necessarily due to the oxidation of water, and in H2SO4 most of this current results in the oxidation of SO42− to S2O82−.14,35 Thus the faradaic efficiency for O2 production for these photoanodes was directly measured to determine the efficacy of each OEC attachment strategy. A fluorescence-based oxygen sensor (see Experimental) was employed to unambiguously separate water oxidation from sulfate oxidation. The O2 yield of bare WO3 in 1 M H2SO4 was established by measuring O2 production under potentiostatic conditions at different applied biases (Fig. S12, ESI†). WO3 by itself was observed to have a faradaic oxygen production yield, ηO2, of 29% at 2.0 V vs. RHE, decreasing to ∼0% below 1.4 V vs. RHE. To be useful for photoelectrochemical water-splitting, the photoanode needs to produce O2 from H2O in its power-producing region, below the water oxidation potential (<1.23 V vs. RHE) with high faradaic efficiency.

Fig. 5 shows O2 production measurements for WO3 photoanodes with both thin and thick sputtered IrO2 layers biased at 1.2 V vs. RHE. Sputtered IrO2 by itself was measured as well (at higher bias to produce the necessary current) to demonstrate the near unity O2 yield achievable with IrO2. Thicker sputtered IrO2 films on WO3 increased the ηO2 to ∼100% O2 yield compared to 68% for thin layers (Table 1). However, in a tandem water-splitting cell the wide band gap electrode needs to be the initial or top light absorber. Thus, in an integrated tandem configuration, WO3 would be the top cell and be illuminated from the front side. Therefore, a tradeoff exists between high water oxidation rates that are favored by high catalyst loadings and low parasitic light absorption that favors low catalyst loadings. The optimal catalyst thickness would maximize the front illuminated oxygen production rate.
 Fig. 5  O2 production of sputtered IrO2 on WO3. The amount of O2 produced at 1.2 V vs. RHE under back illumination in 1 M H2SO4 for a WO3 photoanode with a sputtered IrO2 catalyst layer. The quantity of O2 was determined by (dashed lines, ΔQ) the total charge passed (assuming 100% faradaic conversion to O2) and by (solid lines, probe) an optical O2 sensor. For catalyst thickness, (red lines) a thin film was sputtered for 0.5 min, and (blue lines) a thick film was sputtered for 30 min. To demonstrate the high faradaic efficiency achievable with the catalyst, (black lines) bare IrO2 films were measured in the dark at 1.5 V vs. RHE. 
To be an effective photoanode, the catalyst and light absorber combination must be stable under oxidative conditions in the electrolyte. As reported in previous work,14 the bare WO3 photocurrent decayed over time; however, in many cases the photocurrent recovered after the measurement of a cyclic voltammogram (Fig. S15a, ESI†). Even after photocurrent decay from >60 h under operation, rinsing the electrode and measuring in fresh electrolyte recovered much of the photocurrent and resulted in J–E behavior similar to the original performance.
XPS spectra of the relevant peaks were examined for changes after J–E measurement and after an extended stability test in which the electrode was biased at 1.2 V vs. RHE under illumination for 12 h. For bare WO3, neither the W nor the O peaks showed any noticeable difference after the extended stability test (Fig. S15b and c, ESI†). Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectra for thin, 0.5 min sputtered IrO2/WO3 electrodes in which the catalyst layer was thin enough to allow sampling of the underlying WO3. Of the OECs tested, only IrO2 was stable in 1 M H2SO4 for a significant time (see ESI†), with no noticeable change in the O 1s or Ir 4d regions even after the extend stability test (Fig. 6b and c). Interestingly, the IrO2/WO3 W 4f region did change, with a doublet peak rising at 35.0 eV (Fig. S16, ESI†). Based on NIST XPS peak assignments for tungsten species, we tentatively assign this to either H2WO4 that could arise from a reaction with a peroxo species, or perhaps even an iridium tungstate species at the interface. The robustness of the thin sputtered IrO2 on WO3 is further demonstrated in Fig. 7, in which the photoanode, after an extended stability test, was rinsed and put in a fresh 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte to measure the J–E behavior. Changes in the shape of the curve were minimal, and even after 12 h under operation, the catalytic onset current beyond 1.4 V vs. RHE remained.

Electrodeposited IrOx on WO3 photoanodes
Electrodeposition of the IrO2 layer was also investigated as a catalyst attachment method capable of high surface coverage. Previous studies have shown that electrodeposited catalysts can be effective at improving the performance of photoanodes.21,46 An established literature method for electrodepositing IrOx on FTO was used in this work.38 The electrodeposition proceeded until 400 mC of charge had passed with a 1 cm2 substrate, providing the same catalyst loading for each sample.
The resulting J–E behavior for IrOx on FTO showed high catalytic current at >1.4 V vs. RHE as expected, but with a slight decay during successive scans (Fig. 8a). Electrodeposited IrOx/WO3 electrodes, however, displayed complex behavior with significant hysteresis between the forward and reverse scans as well as large redox peaks around 0.8 V vs. RHE. This general behavior has been observed before for electrodeposited IrOx on a metal oxide photoanode,42 with the peaks at 0.8 V vs. RHE ascribed to an Ir(III)/Ir(IV) redox process with a large capacitance that leads to the hysteresis.47,48 The averaged photocurrent under back illumination agreed well with bare WO3 (Table 1); however, the catalytic current was unstable and decayed progressively as the samples were measured with back and then front illumination followed by a dark curve.
 Fig. 8  
J–E behavior for electrodeposited IrOx on WO3. Photoelectrochemical current-density (J) vs. potential (E) behavior in 1 M H2SO4 for electrodeposited IrOx on WO3 (a) as-deposited and (b) after a 400 °C anneal for 1 h. Performance is shown for (green lines) back illumination, (red lines) front illumination, and (gray lines) in the dark, with (blue lines) bare WO3 under illumination and (black lines) the catalyst by itself in the dark for reference. Multiple successive scans of the catalyst by itself are included to demonstrate unstable current in (a) and stable current in (b). 
Evidently, a reaction is proceeding in this instance that was not occurring with IrO2 deposited by other methods. New electrodeposited IrOx/WO3 electrodes were subsequently annealed at 400 °C in air for 1 h to ensure complete oxidation of the catalyst. The current from both electrodeposited IrOx/WO3 and IrOx directly on FTO stabilized due to the anneal, and the redox peaks nearly disappeared (Fig. 8b). This result corroborated previous work on a similar electrodeposited hydrous (Ru + Ir)Ox, which was unstable in H2SO4 as-deposited but stabilized upon annealing.48
During annealing, trapped water is vaporized from the electrodeposited film and the catalyst is fully oxidized, leading to a denser layer.48 Unfortunately, after annealing the electrodeposited IrO2/WO3 photocurrent declined to approximately one fourth of its as-deposited, back-illuminated value (Table 1), possibly due to the same mechanism that degraded the J–E behavior of sintered IrO2/WO3 photoanodes. It is speculated that the hydrous nature of the as-deposited IrOx films allows the liquid electrolyte/WO3 junction to establish band bending, but upon annealing to a denser IrO2 layer, the IrO2/WO3 interface dominates. XPS spectra of the electrodeposited IrOx on WO3 electrodes confirm that the catalyst is not primarily in the IrO2 state until after the annealing step (Fig. S17, ESI†). A second electrodeposition method, which has been shown to yield highly active nanoparticulate IrOx films on glassy carbon and FTO from a colloidal suspension of IrOx,39 resulted in similar behavior to the first electrodeposition method when deposited on WO3 (Fig. S18, ESI†).
Although electrodeposition is a promising strategy for high coverage, conformal catalyst attachment that has been demonstrated effectively by other groups, it may not work well unless the as-deposited catalyst is in a stable, active form. Annealed, electrodeposited IrOx on WO3 may perform similarly to spin-coated, sintered IrO2 on WO3 if it can be deposited uniformly at a comparable thickness (1–2 nm).
Conclusions
WO3 is a promising photoanode material that is unusual for its stability in acidic media, but its selectivity for water oxidation over side reactions is dependent on the electrolyte and generally very low at low pH. The O2 yield can be improved with the incorporation of an OEC, but the method of catalyst attachment is critical to determining the performance of the photoanode. The surface coverage of catalyst on the semiconductor must be high enough to promote charge-transfer to a catalytically active site rather than the WO3/electrolyte interface where oxidation of the acid counterion is more favorable. Sputtering OEC layers was the most effective attachment strategy tried in this work, with IrO2 being the most stable catalyst in strong acid. Sputtered IrO2 on WO3 greatly increased the faradaic oxygen production efficiency, with nearly complete water oxidation observed for thick catalyst layers; however, a tradeoff exists for sputtered catalysts between high O2 yield and low parasitic light absorption that must be optimized. Measurements in an electrolyte with a fast, one-electron redox couple indicate that the IrO2/WO3 junction is ohmic, which results in poor photoelectrochemical performance when compact, conformal catalyst layers more than a few nm in thickness coat the semiconductor. Good photoelectrochemical performance under back illumination with thick sputtered catalysts is attributed to the porous morphology of these layers.
The results indicate that an ideal OEC layer would be one that is highly conformal yet optically transparent, thin and/or porous enough to allow the liquid electrolyte to control the interfacial energetics, and deposited in a stable, catalytically active form. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ultrathin metal oxide catalysts, in which the layer is not thick enough to dominate the photoelectrochemical junction, therefore seems like a promising avenue for future catalyst attachment studies to photoanodes. Alternatively, appropriately spaced catalyst particles small enough to be in the “pinch-off” regime, in which the liquid/semiconductor junction potential would control the energetics even in the regions where catalyst is present,49 could also lead to efficient photoanodes with a high O2 yield. Lastly, it should be acknowledged that Ir is one of the rarest elements on Earth, and unless a low-overpotential, acid-stable OEC other than IrO2 is identified, highly scalable photoanode systems may require a shift toward higher pH.
