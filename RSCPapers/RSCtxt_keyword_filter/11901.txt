    , Accepted 25th April 2023First published on 26th April 2023AbstractAlthough the efficiency of perovskite solar cells is over 25%, there is still a big difference between the open-circuit voltage and its theoretical value, which is ascribed to defects in the perovskite films. Here, 4-iodo-1H-imidazole is introduced into a perovskite precursor to prevent defect formation in final films. The open-circuit voltage is significantly elevated to 1.209 V from 1.085 V. 4-Iodo-1H-imidazole, as a kind of small organic molecule, can not only reduce pin-holes in perovskite films by participating in the growth of perovskite crystals, but also suppress the generation of defects, resulting in decreased nonradiative recombination. Finally, the device efficiency becomes 21.68%, which is increased by 20% in comparison with that of the control device (17.87%).
Introduction
Benefitting from the outstanding optoelectronic properties, hybrid organic metal halide perovskites, as a kind of light-absorption material, are widely researched.1–5 In the last few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased to 25.7% from 3.8% by adjusting the composition of perovskite materials and optimizing the interface and structure of PSC devices.6–11 Currently, the short-circuit current density (JSC) is getting closer to the theoretical limit.12 However, there is still a large gap between the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the theoretical value, which limits the PCE of PSCs. Previous studies have shown that the VOC is affected by the native defects in polycrystalline perovskite films due to the overflowing of the organic components during the annealing process.13–15 These defects induce nonradiative recombination,13,16–19 which leads to a shortened carrier lifetime and decreased VOC.20,21 Therefore, reducing the trap states, especially the deep trap states, can decrease the charge recombination loss. Eventually, the charge transport and collection get reformative. At the same time, the VOC and PCE are improved.
Additive engineering is one of the most available strategies to enhance the VOC of PSCs. The functional groups of additives interact with the components of perovskites.22–24 The commonly employed additives are polymers, small molecules, ionic liquids and organic salts. Due to the presence of many functional groups in the polymer molecules, they remain stable when combined with perovskites. However, many researchers argue that most of the polymers are insulating materials, which may affect the charge transport in the device.25 Compared with that of polymers, the structure of small molecule additives is simple and easily adjustable. Most importantly, small molecules have little effect on the conductivity of perovskite films. Small molecules can interact with internal defects in perovskites through their functional groups or π bonds, which passivates and reduces the nonradiative recombination.
Imidazole is a kind of small molecule with amphoteric characteristics which may simultaneously interact with Lewis acid defects and Lewis base defects.26,27 The diammonium molecule can also provide additional hydrogen bonding.28 Moreover, certain studies demonstrated that incorporation of a small quantity of imidazole into PbI6 octahedral cages can help maintain the stability of three-dimensional perovskite structures.28,29 Fei et al. introduced high concentrations of imidazolium iodide in a perovskite precursor, followed by fumigation with gaseous methylamine to release imidazole.29 The released imidazole distributes around the crystal edges, resulting in auto-passivation of crystal defects. Using this method, the PCE of the PSC device increased from 18.22% to 20.14% and VOC increased from 1.06 to 1.11 V. Yang et al. synthesized an imidazole sulfonate zwitterion (4-(1H-imidazol-3-ium-3-yl) butane-1-sulfonate, IMS) and incorporated it into a perovskite precursor.30 They found that the IMS zwitterion additive can not only regulate the crystalline grain orientation of perovskites but also passivate the trap states (uncoordinated Pb2+ defects and I vacancy defects).
Here, a small amount of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole was directly introduced into a perovskite precursor solution to reduce the defects in the perovskite film. Finally, the resulting PCE of the PSC modified with 4-iodo-1H-imidazole became 21.68% from 17.87%. Especially, the VOC changed from 1085 mV to 1209 mV. To the best of our knowledge, our device exhibits the largest VOC reported so far for Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 based PSC devices.
Experimental
Materials
Fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. Cesium iodide (CsI) was purchased from TCI (Japan). Lead iodide (PbI2), methylammonium bromide (MABr), lead bromine (PbBr2), and spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp (China). Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was purchased from Greatcell Solar Materials (Australia). Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tertbutylpyridine (4-TBP), dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (America). All the chemical reagents were obtained and used without further treatment.
Preparation of the mixed perovskite precursor
The Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 precursor solution was prepared in a glovebox according to the literature.31 First, FAI (1M, 163.37 mg), PbI2 (1.1M, 481.7 mg), MABr (0.2M, 21.27 mg) and PbBr2 (0.2M, 76.7 mg) were dissolved in a mixture of 760 μL of DMF and 190 μL of DMSO. After stirring evenly, 50 μL of CsI solution in DMSO (1.5 M) was added. The solution was stirred at room temperature for about 3 h to form the final precursor solution. It can be noted that the precursor contains an excess amount of lead. The 4-iodo-1H-imidazole doped perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole in 1 mL of the pristine perovskite precursor. The solution was continuously stirred for 3 h before use.
Device fabrication
The pre-treatment of FTO substrates and the fabrication of TiO2 films were carried out according to our previous reports.32,33 The mixed perovskite precursor was spin-coated on TiO2 substrates at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 20 s in a glovebox. In the last five seconds, 120 μL of chlorobenzene was drop-coated, followed by an annealing process at 100 °C for 45 min. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite films at 700 rpm for 30 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s in the glovebox. Finally, 80 nm Au was deposited by using thermal evaporation to complete the whole device. The preparation recipe and the deposition technique of spiro-OMeTAD solution were also performed according to our previous reports.32,33 In the experiments, the devices based on different concentrations were assembled. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured and are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† We found that the optimal concentration of the additive is 15 mg ml−1. The PCE sharply decreases when the concentration of additives exceeds 20 mg. So, in the main body of the paper, we discuss the control group and the optimal concentration group.
Measurements and characterization studies
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the perovskite films were recorded by using a SmartLab 3KW machine (Rigaku, Japan). The surface morphologies, microstructures of perovskite films, and the cross-sectional structure of the PSCs were investigated by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Sigma500, Carl Zeiss AG). The surface roughness of the perovskite films was measured with an atomic force microscope (Park NX20, Korea). The surface potential of different perovskite films was measured with a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) (Park NX20, Korea). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were recorded using NICOLET IS 50. XPS characterization was conducted using an ESCALAB250Xi machine (Thermo Scientific, UK). UV-vis absorbance spectra of perovskite films were recorded with a Lambda 1050 machine (PerkinElmer America). The steady-state photoluminescence spectra (SSPL) and the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) were both recorded with an FLS1000 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh, UK). The stabilized current density was measured on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation. Transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements were performed using a transient SPPCIV-1 system (EnliTech). The J–V curves of the PSCs were recorded with a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A, Newport). The solar simulator was calibrated to AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 with a standard silicon photodiode. In this work, the voltage range for the reverse scan was from 1.5 to −0.1 V. In each scan range, 100 data points were collected. The pre-sweep delay time was set as 40 ms, and the dwell time was controlled at 30 ms at each voltage step. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an EQE measurement system (Newport).
Results and discussion
The structural diagram of the PSC is shown in Fig. 1a. To observe the effect of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole on the composition of perovskite films, the different films deposited on FTO were characterized by XRD. As depicted in Fig. 1b, both the pristine perovskite films (denoted as the control) and the doped perovskite films (denoted as the target) show the same diffraction pattern which matches well with the characteristic diffraction pattern of cubic perovskites.34,35 In addition, it can be observed that the characteristic peaks of Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 become slightly enhanced after the introduction of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole, while the peak of PbI2 is slightly weakened. The result manifests that the addition of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole can regulate the crystallization process of perovskites, which enhances the crystallization properties of perovskites and inhibits the excessive formation of PbI2. It is well known that PbI2 is a double-edged sword for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. A certain amount of excess PbI2 in the perovskite film can help to suppress charge recombination and passivate surface defects, thus promoting the device performance.36 However, under light or X-ray irradiation, metallic lead (Pb0) defects, a kind of deep-level trap states that deteriorate device efficiency and stability, are easily formed in perovskite films with residual PbI2.37 Comparing these XRD patterns, we can find that a certain amount of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole cannot significantly affect the crystal structure of perovskites. To further investigate the effect of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole on the crystal growth of perovskites, we imaged the top-view morphologies of the control and target perovskite films by FESEM. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the pin-holes disappeared after introducing 4-iodo-1H-imidazole, which is conducive to reducing the grain boundary defects. The change in grain size is not obvious. This result can be confirmed by AFM (Fig. S2, ESI†). The AFM result reveals that the additive slightly decreases the roughness of the perovskite films. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the cross-sectional view FESEM images of the PSC devices assembled with control perovskite films and target perovskite films. It can be seen that the thickness of the control perovskite films and the target perovskite films, respectively, is 400 nm and 420 nm, meaning that the introduction of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole can improve the thickness of the perovskite light-absorption layer. Generally, a slight increase in the thickness of the perovskite light-absorption layer is conducive to the absorption of incident light, thus leading to the enhancement of photovoltaic performance.38

We further investigated the molecular interactions between 4-iodo-1H-imidazole and perovskites by using FTIR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2a, the FTIR spectra of both the control perovskite film and the 4-iodo-1H-imidazole doped perovskite film exhibit two-branched peaks at 2361 and 2335 cm−1, which can be attributed to the CO2 adsorbed due to the unavoidable exposure to air before and during FTIR tests. For the pristine perovskite, the six peaks at 3500–3100 cm−1 and 1616 cm−1 are the stretching vibrational peaks of N–H bonds in FA+/MA+. The CN strong stretching vibrational peak in FA+ appeared at 1711 cm−1. And the C–N stretching vibrational peak in FA+/MA+ is at 1048 cm−1. The aforementioned peaks are the intrinsic characteristic peaks of organic ammonium cations involved in the control perovskite films. The remaining two distinct characteristic peaks at 1472 and 1352 cm−1 respectively are ascribed to the anti-symmetric and umbrella bending vibration of the CH3 group. In addition, there are two unremarkable peaks (at 1013 and 909 cm−1) belonging to C–H bending vibration in FA+. These results are available in existing reports.39–41 When 4-iodo-1H-imidazole is introduced into the perovskite film, a certain amount of vibration shift is observed. As shown in Fig. 2b, the 4-iodo-1H-imidazole doped perovskite film, shows a slight shift towards high wavenumbers due to the N–H stretching vibrations at 3401 and 3272 cm−1. Besides, the CN (1711 cm−1), C–N (1048 cm−1), and C–H (1013 and 909 cm−1) vibrations are shifted to lower wavenumbers. The results of FTIR spectroscopy reveal that interactions exist between 4-iodo-1H-imidazole and perovskites.

XPS was further performed to corroborate the interaction between 4-iodo-1H-imidazole and the perovskite (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4, ESI†). All XPS peaks were calibrated using the C–C peak (to 284.8 eV) in the high-resolution XPS spectra of C 1s to correct the charge shift of the binding energies. The data were analysed using XPSPEAK software with a mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian function. Fig. 3c shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Pb 4f. For the control sample, the binding energies at 143.51 and 138.63 eV can be attributed to Pb2+ 4f5/2 and Pb2+ 4f7/2, respectively,42,43 while the little shoulders at 142.02 and 137.05 eV correspond to Pb0 4f5/2 and Pb0 4f7/2, respectively.43 After incorporating 4-iodo-1H-imidazole, the binding energies of the four peaks shift to lower values. The shift to lower binding energies for Pb2+ 4f5/2 and Pb2+ 4f7/2 suggests the coordination interaction between 4-iodo-1H-imidazole and uncoordinated Pb2+26. 4-Iodo-1H-imidazole has electron-rich N atoms which can bond with uncoordinated Pb2+, increasing the electron cloud density and decreasing the electron affinity of Pb2+. As a result, the binding energy of Pb2+ gets reduced. The peaks of Pb0 4f5/2 and Pb0 4f7/2 reveal the presence of Pb0 defects in the control and target perovskite films. The Pb0 species usually arise from unreacted PbI2 in the perovskite film under light or X-ray irradiation.37Fig. 3d shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of I 3d. The binding energies of I 3d also shift to lower binding energies after introducing 4-iodo-1H-imidazole, further implying the interactions of amino groups in 4-iodo-1H-imidazole with I−.26 In the perovskite precursor, the introduction of additional iodine sources is commonly associated with the reduction of I vacancy defects.44,45 As the I vacancy defects cannot be precisely identified from I 3d high-resolution XPS spectra, we calculate the atomic ratio of I/Pb which is obtained from XPS measurement. The values are 2.33 and 2.34 respectively for the control and target samples, manifesting that the I species in perovskite film does not increase significantly after introducing 4-iodo-1H-imidazole additive. The result reveals that the I element in 4-iodo-1H-imidazole has little effect on I vacancy defects. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the survey spectra and the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cs 3d, Br 3d, and O 1s.

To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the control and target perovskite films, the planar structured PSCs of the FTO/c-TiO2/control or target perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au are fabricated. The J–V characteristic curves obtained from one sun illumination are displayed in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The device with target films attains an optimal PCE of 21.68%. Compared with the control device (PCE value is 17.87%), the photovoltaic performance parameters, including JSC, VOC, and fill factor (FF), have improved comprehensively, especially the values of VOC. As shown, the VOC of the target film becomes 1.209 V from 1.085 V, indicating that 4-iodo-1H-imidazole is good for raising VOC. To the best of our knowledge, the VOC value is the highest for PSCs reported based on the Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite absorber. Fig. S5 (ESI†) displays the J–V curves in the forward and reverse scan of a random device. The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that the control device shows large hysteresis, while the hysteresis phenomenon improves obviously after the introduction of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole. Nevertheless, the 4-iodo-1H-imidazole modified device still exhibits some hysteresis, which may be due to the thickness of the perovskite film. In planar-structured PSC devices, hysteresis is related to the thickness of the perovskite film.46 When the perovskite film in the device is thick (400–600 nm), the hysteresis phenomenon is obvious. While the device shows slight or no hysteresis when the perovskite film in the device is thin (100–200 nm). The EQE spectra were measured and are shown in Fig. 4b. The result manifests that the target device exhibits higher EQE values at visible wavelength. As exhibited in Fig. 4c, the stabilized PCE values of the control and target PSCs are 16.34% and 20.23%, respectively. In order to accurately analyse the impact of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole on PCE, the photovoltaic parameters and histogram distribution of 50 control or target devices are displayed in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†). The PCE distribution of the target device is narrow, indicating that the reproducibility of the target PSC devices is better than that of the control devices.

To figure out the reasons for the VOC improvement, we measured the Mott–Schottky curves of the control and target device. Generally, the built-in potential (Vbi), correlating with VOC, can be obtained from the Mott–Schottky curve.47 As shown in Fig. 4d, the Vbi value of the control film is 0.97 V. Compared to the control film, the target film exhibits a higher value of 1.08 V, implying that the introduction of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole enhances the Vbi and leads to an increase in the device's VOC. To analyse the impact of the trap-state density (Ntrap) on VOC, the space charge limited current (SCLC) is conducted.48 The FTO/TiO2/perovskite devices with or without 4-iodo-1H-imidazole/C60/Ag are adopted in the measurement. The analysis of SCLC can provide the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). And according to the equation:  we can get the value of the trap state density (Ntrap). In the equation, e is the elementary charge with a value of 1.6 × 10−19 C, L is the thickness of the perovskite layer where the value for the control perovskite film is 400 nm and the value for the target perovskite film is 420 nm, ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite with a value of 35, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity with a value of 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1.49 Evidently, based on Fig. 5a and b, the VTFL value of the control film is 0.990 V, while the value is 0.837 V for the target film. Through calculation, it can be found that the Ntrap values for the control electron-only device and the target electron-only device are 2.40 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.84 × 1016 cm−3, respectively, indicating that the 4-iodo-1H-imidazole additive suppresses the defects in the perovskite light absorption layer. In the light of the previous report, the reduction of Ntrap compensates for an enhancement of VOC.32 So, the improvement of VOC in this work can be partially attributed to the passivation of the defects. To further explore the cause of the enhancement in VOC, we conduct the KPFM measurement. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the contact potential difference (CPD) of the control and target films are −50 mV and −83 mV, respectively, signifying that the Fermi levels of the two perovskite films are similar. Hence, the change of VOC caused by Fermi level can be ignored.
 Fig. 5  (a and b) Dark I–V measurement of the control and target devices the inset shows the device structure, (c) and (d) KPFM images of the control and target film. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S8, ESI†) and the SSPL spectra (Fig. 6a) were measured to analyse the photophysical properties of the perovskite films. UV-vis test is used to determine whether the bandgap of perovskite film has changed. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), after introducing 4-iodo-1H-imidazole, the absorption edge does not change obviously, indicating that the additive has little effect on the bandgap of perovskites. In Fig. 6a, the photoluminescence peak at 760 nm matches with the exciton recombination caused by the process of transitioning of the electronic excited state of perovskite into the ground state. Furthermore, Fig. 6a shows that the target film exhibits higher intensity in comparison with the control film, indicating that 4-iodo-1H-imidazole can restrain the formation of deep-level defects in perovskites. We conclude that 4-iodo-1H-imidazole has a certain ability to inhibit nonradiative recombination, which can promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and thus increase VOC. This result is consistent with the above analysis.

To gain a deep insight into the dynamics of carrier separation, we studied the TRPL decay of the control and target films with excited light at a wavelength of 475 nm. The TRPL is usually used to detect the time-dependent dynamics of the radiation transition spectra of the excited states. The process of charge recombination bound up with defect concentration can be calculated from the decay curves of the control and target layers. The result is shown in Fig. 6b, and the fitted result is listed in Table 2. The recombination is composed of two components with different lifetimes, a shorter and a faster lifetime. The faster lifetime τ1 is associated with the interface properties of the perovskite layer, such as the dangling bonds on the film's surface and the trap centers.47,50 The values of τ1 are 5.47 ns and 76.32 ns for the control and target films, respectively, indicating that the trap centres on the surface significantly decrease. The slower τ2 is attributed to the bulk properties of the perovskite, referring to radiation recombination. The τ2 value of the target film (326.31 ns) is larger than that of the control film (104.91 ns), demonstrating that the additive increases the radiation recombination of perovskite films.51 This is conducive to improving the VOC of PSCs.

In order to study the carrier transport dynamics in the whole photovoltaic device, the device based on the control and target layer were measured with transient photovoltage (TPV) and photocurrent (TPC) technology. The exciton dissociation and recombination at interfaces can be recorded in the process of TPV and TPC. As seen in Fig. 6c and d, the charge transport time (τt) of the control and target devices from TPC corresponds to 1.1 μs and 0.98 μs, respectively, illustrating that the 4-iodo-1H-imidazole processed perovskite film accelerates carrier transfer at the interface in comparison to the control perovskite film. The recombination time (τr) of the target device is four times longer than that of the control device, implying suppressed interfacial recombination in the target layer. This result can also be confirmed from the dependence of VOC and JSC on light intensity. With regard to a solar cell, the VOC value can be calculated using the following equation:  where k, T, q, and n0 are constants. The lower ε, representing deviation between kT/q and the slope (VOCversus ln (I)), means less carrier recombination. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the ε values of the target and control devices are 1.78 and 1.97, respectively, which is in agreement with the result of TPV. In addition, the equation:JSC ∝ Iα(α < 1)also reflects carrier recombination. α has a relationship with charge recombination. Generally, JSC is proportional to I, and α is the slope in the logarithmic form. It can be seen that the 4-iodo-1H-imidazole modified PSC exhibits an α value of 0.988, and the value is 0.976 for the control device, manifesting that introducing 4-iodo-1H-imidazole helps reduce carrier recombination. Thus, it is beneficial for the transmission and separation of carriers.

To evaluate the stability of the PSCs, the PCE of the unencapsulated device assembled with the control and target films was constantly recorded over 10 days at room temperature and 20% relative humidity. Fig. 7c exhibits that the PCE of the device with the target film does not exhibit significant attenuation, while the photovoltaic performance of the control device decreases from 18.14% to 11%. The result indicates that 4-iodo-1H-imidazole can help improve the device stability. To observe the light stability of the device, the PCE of the PSC devices was measured under continuous light for 10 h. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the PCE decay of the device assembled with 4-iodo-1H-imidazole is slower than that of the control device.
Conclusion
Overall, 4-iodo-1H-imidazole was introduced into perovskite layers to improve the performance and stability of PSCs. The incorporation of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole can improve the quality of perovskite films where few pin-holes appear in the 4-iodo-1H-imidazole modified Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 film. In addition, 4-iodo-1H-imidazole helps in decreasing defects in perovskites, contributing to suppressed nonradiative recombination. The carrier dynamics studies confirm that the addition of 4-iodo-1H-imidazole can improve the transportation and separation of charge carriers. Finally, the PCE of the target device was enhanced to 21.68% from 17.89%. Excitedly, the PSC achieved a VOC value of 1.209 V which is the best value for the PSC based on a Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 light-absorption layer reported so far.
