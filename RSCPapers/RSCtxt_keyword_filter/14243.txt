    AbstractThis novel work presents the successful size control of Eu3+x-modified TiO2 nanoparticles by adding various amounts of Eu3+. The electronic structures of Eu3+x-modified TiO2 nanoparticles are different from those of pure TiO2 nanoparticles, as analyzed by DRS (UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). As Eu3+x-modified TiO2 nanoparticles are used as a second layer in the double-layered electrode, the probability of recombination of excited electrons and holes is reduced to increase the short-circuit current (JSC) during the operation of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The increase in the open circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.66 to 0.71 V is observed owing to the energy of the conduction band in Eu3+x-modified TiO2 layer. Finally, the efficiency (η) is clearly improved from 2.20 to 3.43% when the double-layered structure of Eu0.03-TiO2/Eu0-TiO2 is adopted in the DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been identified recently as a third-generation technology, and extensively investigated by scientists in various fields. The advantages of dye-sensitized solar cells over similar earlier-generation technologies are the low cost of the materials, the lack of a need to use elaborate equipment to manufacture them and the possibly of engineering them as flexible sheets.1,2 The basic structure of DSSCs consists of five parts—the counter electrode, the electrolyte, the sensitizer, the conduction material/semiconductor and the FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) electrode. The working principle of a DSSC is that an electron in a dye molecule in the photoexcited state is injected through the conduction band of TiO2 into FTO, enabling the electron to be conducted into the outer circuit to drive the load and generate electric power. All circuits in a DSSCs must be made more efficient to promote the injection of electrons from dye molecules into the conduction material (FTO/TiO2) and the suppression of the recombination of electrons and holes. Accordingly, TiO2 nanomaterials exhibit key electrical and physical properties that are exploited in their use as conduction materials in DSSCs, including good matching between the energy level of the conduction band and the photoexcited state of the dye molecule and the 3.2 eV band gap associated with the transmission of sunlight into a sensitizer. The difference between the potential of the conduction band of TiO2 and the photoexcited state of dye molecules drives the rapid injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2, but excited electrons are always lost in the interface between the dye molecules and the conduction layer, reducing the efficiency (η) of the DSSCs. The efficiency (η) of DSSCs has been improved using mixed oxides Ti1-xZrxO2 conduction to change the band gap of the material.3–6 When an electron is transferred from the photoexcited state of a molecular dye through the conduction band of TiO2 into FTO, the recombination of electrons and holes occurs frequently. The conduction material, such as TiO2, importantly determines the charge-transfer dynamics at the interface with the dye molecules, so it is important in the construction of desired TiO2 electrodes to improve the efficiency of DSSCs.
In this work, various sized Eu3+x-modified TiO2 nanoparticles are synthesized using the sol–gel and hydrothermal method by adding different amounts of Eu3+x with x from 0.003 to 0.04. Eu3+ ions can be used to modulate the structure of the conduction and valence bands of TiO2 nanoparticles to establish a double-layered TiO2 electrode. Herein, based on the double-layered structure of the Eu3+x-TiO2 electrode, the probability of recombination between electron and hole is reduced by arranging, as desired, the energy position of the conduction band to drive the forward injection of electrons into the FTO. When the double-layered electrode is used, the improvements in the DSSCs are evidenced by the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc). A black dye with wide-range absorption in wavelength is considered the most efficient absorption reagent for use in the sensitizer to convert light to electricity, when TiO2 is used as the conduction material in our study.7,8 The black dye absorbs from visible light to near infrared light with wavelengths of up to 900 nm, improving the overlap of absorbed wavelength by sensitizer with the solar spectrum.9
2. Experimental section
2-1. Materials
[Ti(OC4H9)4] (99%, Acroros), Eu2O3 (99.9%, Sigma- Aldrich), nitric acid (37%, Sigma-Aldrich) and ethanol (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased without further purification. FTO, [SnO2:F TCO] (TCO22-15, 15 Ω/sq) was purchased from Solaronix.
2-2. Synthesis of Eu3+x-modified TiO2 nanoparticles
Various amounts of Eu2O3 (Eu3+x where x represents the molar ratio Eu3+/Ti4+) were added to 60 mL water, and the pH value of the solution was tuned to <2 by adding 1 M nitric acid. After vigorous stirring for half an hour, 10 mL tetrabutyl titanate, Ti(OC4H9)4, was slowly dripped into the solution with vigorous stirring for 1 h. The mixture was heated to 80 °C with magnetic stirring for 10 h and was then transferred into the autoclave at 227 °C for 12 h. Following hydrothermal treatment, a white slurry sample was obtained and then washed repeatedly using ethanol. The white powder was annealed in the atmosphere for 6 h at 500 °C. The final samples were collected for further characterization.
2-3. Preparation of double-layered electrodes for DSSCs
1.125 g ethyl cellulose (5–15 mPa s), 0.875 g ethyl cellulose (30–50 mPa s) and 20 mL ethanol are mixed with vigorous stirring until the mixed solution forms transparent gel. 4 g Eu3+x-TiO2 powder, 64.9 g of terpineol and 20 ml of ethanol were added to transparent gel, which was then stirred violently for 90 min. Ethanol and water are removed from mixed solutions using a rotary-evaporator at 40 °C under vacuum for 90 min to yield a white paste. The FTO electrode is coated first with a layer of white paste over an area of 0.16 cm2 by the doctor blade method and dried at 125 °C for 6 min. The series of thermal treatments is as follows. The paste that coats the FTO is gradually heated under an airflow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min and finally at 500 °C for 15 min.10 To construct a double-layered electrode, the first layer of the FTO coating is itself coated with Eu3+0.03-TiO2 paste as a second layer by the doctor blade method. The second layer, the FTO coating, is treated by repeating the above thermal procedure. The final Eu3+x-TiO2/Eu3+0-TiO2-coated FTO is the double-layered electrode.
2-4. Fabrication of double-layered electrode for use in DSSCs
The Eu3+x-TiO2/Eu3+0-TiO2-coated FTO electrode is immersed in TiCl4/EtOH solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then calcined at 500 °C for 30 min under air flow. The calcined electrode is soaked in black dye (0.2 mM). A spacing film is placed aside the Eu3+x-TiO2/Eu3+0-TiO2-coated TiO2 electrode, and then combine with the sputtered Pt electrode as a counter electrode. I−/I3− electrolyte is injected into the space between the Eu3+x-TiO2/Eu3+0-TiO2-coated TiO2 electrode and the Pt electrode.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays the XRD patterns of TiO2 nanoparticles that have been modified by adding various amounts of Eu3+x with x from 0.01 to 0.04. The XRD patterns match closely the standard pattern of TiO2 in the anatase phase, but the diffraction peak of crystalline Eu2O3 and its derivatives cannot be identified. The main diffraction peak is at the same angle (2θ) as in the standard pattern, indicating that lattice distance in TiO2 nanoparticles is constant, according to Bragg’s law (2d sinθ = nλ). Therefore, the Eu3+ ions cannot be inserted into the lattice of TiO2 to change the lattice spacing, because of the apparent difference between the radii of Eu3+ ions (1.08 Å) and Ti4+ ions (0.68 Å). In Fig. 1b, the sizes of the TiO2 nanoparticles, as given by the Scherrer equation, decline from 21.76 nm to 9.78 nm as the amount of Eu3+x ions increases from x = 0 to 0.4.11 The existence of Eu3+ in the all samples can be proven further by using photoluminescence spectra in Fig. S1 of ESI.† An increase of Eu3+ content on the surface of TiO2 reveals the decrease of distance among Eu3+. As the distance among Eu3+ is shortened by increasing the amount of Eu3+, the emission light from excited Eu3+ is absorbed easily by neighboring Eu3+, which is ascribed to a concentration quenching effect. In Fig. S1 (ESI†), the intensity of emission increases with increasing amount of Eu3+x from x = 0 to 0.03. However, after the distance between Eu3+ becomes shorter than a critical distance, it decreases owing to concentration quenching effect. Based on the XRD analysis, the Eu3+ ions on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles are expected to be inhibited, reducing the number of growth sites for TiO2 nanoparticles, and causing the size of the TiO2 nanoparticles to vary with the amount of Eu3+.12 In the sol–gel reaction, the Ti(OC4H9)4 species undergo the chemical processes, hydrolysis and condensation, to form crystalline (Ti–O–Ti)n. Via these processes, Eu3+ forms Eu–O–Ti, modifying the surfaces of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The results are observed by adding various amounts of Eu3+x, from x = 0.0075 to 0.4, to synthesize TiO2 nanoparticles in various sizes. Hence, Eu3+ ions have an effective role in inhibiting the growth sites on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles, enabling the size of TiO2 nanoparticles and their modification to be effectively controlled.

Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of Eu3+x-modified TiO2 nanoparticles, to identify the vibration mode of Ti–O bonding. The Raman active vibrational modes for the anatase phase TiO2 are A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg. The absorption peaks at 146, 398, 518 and 641 cm−1 correspond to the vibration modes Eg, A1g, B1g and Eg, respectively, which closely match the peaks that are characteristic of Ti–O bonding in anatase. As the x value of Eu3+ is varied from 0.015 to 0.05, the absorption peak of the Eg mode (416 cm−1) remains the same as those of unmodified TiO2 nanoparticles (x = 0), indicating that no distortion is observed in the Ti–O symmetry. Previous literature reports no shift of the Eg mode is observed for doping TiO2.13–15 However, the significant shift of Eg mode occurs owing to formation of impurity such as Eu2Ti2O2.13,16,17 For our case, all Raman spectra reveal that a pure anatase phase is observed without the presence of the rutile phase or impurities, which is consistent with the result from XRD.

The modification by Eu3+ on the band gap is investigated using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), as shown in Fig. 3a. A strong DRS signal is obtained from unmodified TiO2 nanoparticles at a wavelength of 332 nm because of the transition of electrons from the O 2p orbital to the Ti 3d orbital. The band gap for optical absorption is defined as the minimum energy required to excite an electron from the ground state (HOMO, at the top of the valence band) to the exciting state (LUMO, at the bottom of the conduction band).17 The Kubelka–Munk function (eqn (1)) can be used to convert the reflectance signal (RTiO2) into equivalent absorption, with BaSO4 used as a reference (Rref)18 (1)where R∞ represents the ratio RTiO2/Rref, α and S denote the absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficient, respectively. Eqn (2) defines the energy-dependence of the absorption coefficient (α) of TiO2:18 (2)where υ is the frequency of the incident photon; h is the Planck constant, and E0 is the optical absorption edge energy. The exponent η is related to whether the band gap associated with the transition of the electron is direct or indirect. Based on eqn (1) and (2), a plot of [F(R)*hυ]1/η as a function of hυ in the absorption edge is linear, and be used to determine the absorption edge energy, which is the band gap. The electronic structure of the material affects the electronic transition between HOMO and LUMO.19 The transition of electrons with the same momentum as holes can occur directly after the absorption of a photon, while indirect electron transitions are associated with vibrations, which release energy from the crystal lattice as phonons. Herein, the phonon momentum equals the difference between the momentum of the electron and that of the hole, satisfying the conservation of energy and crystal momentum. It obeys well-defined selection rules, in which η values of 1/2, 3/2, 2, and 3, refer to direct-allowed, direct-forbidden, indirect-allowed, and indirect-forbidden transitions, respectively. For TiO2 material, the value of η is 2, and is used to plot [F(R)*hυ]1/ηvs.hυ, as shown in Fig. 3b. The band gaps of TiO2 samples that are modified with various amounts of Eu3+ complex are obtained from plots of [F(R)*hυ]1/ηvs.hυ in Fig. 3c. The band gap shifts to low energy as the amount of Eu3+ increases. The atomic orbital of Eu3+ and Ti4+ with O2− form Ti–O–Eu bonds, such that Eu3+ modification affects the hybridized orbital of TiO2, reducing the energy of the band gap. Therefore, the size and band gap of Eu3+x-modified TiO2 nanoparticles can be controlled by adding Eu3+. In other words, the size of TiO2 nanoparticles declines as their specific area increases, supplying the more bonding sites for Eu3+ to load on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. Increasing the amount of Eu3+ used to modify TiO2 nanoparticles reduces the energy of the band gap. This effect increases the Eu3+ modification of the surface of TiO2 and is reflected in a substantial shift in the band gap towards lower energy.

The XPS signal from photoelectrons excited from the Ti 2p orbital is obtained to identify chemical state of Ti4+ in Eu3+x-modified TiO2 with x = 0 and 0.03, as presented in Fig. 4a. The binding energies of TiO2 nanoparticles without Eu3+ modification are 458.3 eV and 464 eV for Ti-2p3/2 and Ti-2p1/2, respectively.19,20 For all samples, the photoelectron signals for Ti are detected at ∼458.3 eV and ∼464 eV, and indicates the oxidation state of Ti still exists in the form Ti4+ owing to the lack of reduction of the TiO2 valence state.12 However, relative to that of unmodified TiO2 nanoparticles, the blue shift in the binding energy associated with the Eu3+0.03 modification of TiO2 is 0.2 eV in the form of shifts to 458.5 eV and 464.2 eV for Ti-2p3/2 and Ti-2p1/2, respectively. Considering the small blue shift, it may arise from the reduction in the density of the electron cloud around Ti atoms by introduction of Eu3+ modification. Fig. 4b displays an XPS signal from the O 1s orbital for each sample. The increase in the binding energy from 529.7 eV to 529.8 eV reflects the decrease in the density of electron cloud on the O orbital. The decreasing in the density of the electron cloud on the Ti and O orbitals proceeds in the direction of the expansion of electron cloud from the Ti orbital via the O orbital to the Eu orbital.21,22 A comparison with the XRD pattern and Raman spectra may be the evidence for the existing of Eu–O–Ti bonds, indicating that the formation of Ti–O–Eu reduces the density of electron cloud on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles rather than insert into TiO2 lattice.

The structures of the conduction band and the valence band are obtained from the RDS and XPS results (Fig. 5a and 5b), obtained at a low scanning rate using low-energy incident photons. The binding energy is calculated by the equation, Eb = hυ − Ek − ϕ, based on photoelectric effect, where Eb represents the binding energy; hv is the energy of the incident photon; Ek denotes the kinetic energy of the photoelectron, and ϕ is the work function. The binding energy of the electron for TiO2 is obtained by extrapolating the low energy edge of the signal of intensity to the zero line (Fig. 5(a)). The binding energies of Eu3+x-modified TiO2 with x = 0 and 0.03 are 2.1 eV and 3.2 eV, respectively. The binding energies of 2.1 eV and 3.2 eV at the onset of the photoelectron’s signal are regarded as the potentials of the electrons localized in the HOMO, using the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) as the 0 eV reference.23Fig. 5(b) depicts the structures of the conduction and valence bands. The conduction and valence bands of the Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 nanoparticles have higher potentials than those of unmodified TiO2 nanoparticles, because of the participation of Eu3+ in the hybridization orbital of TiO2.

Two double-layered electrodes are constructed. One comprises two layers of unmodified TiO2 (Type I) and the other consists of unmodified TiO2 (first layer) and Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 (second layer) (Type II), as shown in Fig. 6. The performance of DSSCs achieved using these two double layered electrodes is analyzed using IPCE (incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency) and from the curve of current density (J) against voltage. Fig. 7a displays the measurement of the IPCE for these two electrodes using a series of incident photons with single wavelengths from 350 nm to 1000 nm. The IPCE that is obtained using a type II double-layered electrode reveals that this electrode more efficiently transforms incident photons into current over a wavelength range from 350 nm to 725 nm than is obtained using a type I electrode. Fig. 7b and Table 1 plot and describe the curve of J as a function of voltage, revealing that the current density (J) and voltage of the type II electrode are better than those of the type I electrode. Accordingly, the improvement in the current density is caused by an increase in the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency in the wavelength range of 350 nm to 725 nm. Using the type II double-layered as an electrode improves the short-circuit current (Jsc) from 5.65 to 7.06 mA cm−2, and increases the open circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.66 to 0.71 V. For the double-layered structure, the FFs (fill factors) of these two types of electrode are similar, reaching ∼0.7, and are a key parameter in evaluating the performance of solar cells. Therefore, a double-layered type II electrode in DSSCs can be successfully constructed.

Considering the size effect in the secondary layer of two double-layered electrodes, it may cause the efficiency different between them and plays a factor in addition to band effect. Tammy et al.24 concentrate on size effect by analyzing the efficiency of a solar cell constructed using TiO2 nanoparticles with 9.8–22.5 nm size. The decrease in efficiency is measured with a decrease of nanoparticle size from 22.5 nm to 15.3 nm owing to a smaller amount of dye absorbed on the surface of the TiO2 layer. If the viewpoint of size effect is only considered, the result is contrary to the small particles with a large specific area for the absorbed dye. Herein, the surface energy needs to be considered as related to the variation in facets of TiO2 nanoparticles after heat treatment. Grant et al.25 also observe the same results in size effect and suggest the pore sizes of TiO2 layer play a main role for the access of the sensitizer. Hence, the reduced size of TiO2 nanoparticles causes the efficiency of solar cell to decrease, but in our case the small nanoparticles with ∼13 nm are used in fabrication of solar cell as a secondary layer, which improves the efficiency. Therefore, it is estimated that the modified energy band of Eu3+ compensates for the disadvantage of small nanoparticle in size effect and further improves the efficiency of solar cells. It is clear that the band effect can play a significant role on the improvement of efficiency of a solar cell. To further analyze in size effect, Fig. S2 and Table S1 of the ESI† show the J–V diagram and efficiency of a double-layered solar cell with only Eu3+0.03 modified TiO2 in two layers. The decrease in efficiency is observed owing to low amount of absorbed dye, which reflects the decrease of current density and efficiency.
Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 is used as the second layer of an electrode, and importantly serves as a potential driver for excited electrons to inject into the inner layer, which suppress the recombination of electrons and holes in second layer, since the energy of the conduction band of Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 is higher than that of unmodified TiO2. Herein, the different energy of the conduction band in a Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 layer from unmodified TiO2 acts as potential driver against the motion of electrons towards the dye/electrolyte, and thus towards the first layer of the electrode with lower energy. The driving potential difference between electrode and dye forces the electron into the secondary layer of the Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2, then rapidly injecting it into the inner first layer of unmodified TiO2, which keeps the photoexcited electron away from dye/electrolyte. The probability that electrons are exposed to holes is speculated to be reduced by quickly removing electrons from the interface between the secondary layer electrode and the dye/electrolyte. Considering the injection of the excited electron from the dye to inner layer owing to the porous structure of TiO2/Eux-TiO2 film, as the injection of electron from secondary layer electrode into the inner first layer drives a potential in inner first layer, which forces the excited electron in the inner layer to flow into the FTO. This mechanism yields a high probability of injection of electrons into the FTO layer for the outer secondary and inner first layer, preventing the loss of electrons by their recombination with holes. Fig. 8 presents the energy diagram of the double-layered electrode, according to which, the energy of the conduction band of layer of the Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2, −1.04 eV, is higher than that of the first layer of unmodified TiO2, which has a potential energy of −0.09 eV, yielding a potential difference of 0.95 eV. This ∼0.95 eV energy barrier not only resists the motion of electrons toward the black dye/electrolyte in the outer layer but also improves electron injection for two layers into FTO, favorably increasing the current density (J) at a given J-voltage (Fig. 7b) and resulting in a highly efficient transformation of incident photons into current, as measured by the IPCE (Fig. 7a). The open-circuit voltage is the maximum value of different potentials between the hybrid energy level (associated with the photoexcited state of the dye molecules and the conduction band of the Eu0.03-TiO2/Eu0-TiO2 layer) and the HOMO in the redox reaction of the electrolyte (I−/I3−).5,26 The increase in the potential energy of the conduction band of the Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 is responsible for the increase in the open circuit voltage (Voc). Therefore, for the double layer, the modulation of the conduction band not only changes directly the open circuit voltage (Voc) but also promotes the efficiency of injection from the photoexcited state of the dye molecule into the conduction band of the electrode, via Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 as an intermediate state. Furthermore, the increase in the energy of the Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 conduction band to a suitable potential can match the photoexcited state of dye molecules, supporting the forward injection of electrons. The results indicate that the layer of Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 can act as a modulator, improving the operation of the DSSCs, by increasing the efficiency of conversion of the sun's energy to electricity.

4. Conclusion
The sizes of Eu3+x-modified TiO2 nanoparticles are successfully controlled by varying the x value from 0 to 0.04. Eu3+ ions can be added in the sol–gel method to control the size of TiO2 nanoparticles by forming Eu–O–Ti bonds, which block the growth sites on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. As the amount of Eu3+ ions increases, the blocking of the growth sites is increased, resulting in the formation of small nanoparticles. The electronic structure of Eu3+0.03-modified TiO2 nanoparticles, including their conduction and valence band, is calculated from the DRS and XPS results, to arrange the double-layered electrode as desired. The energy of the conduction band of the Eu0.03-TiO2/Eu0-TiO2 double layer can be set to reduce the probability of recombination of excited electrons and holes to increase the short-circuit current (JSC) during the operation of the DSSCs. The increase in the open circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.66 to 0.71 V reveals the increase in the difference between the potentials of the hybrid state (conduction band and photoexcited state of dye molecules) and the HOMO in the redox reaction of electrolyte (I−/I3−) owing to the energy of the conduction band which is increased in the Eu0.03-TiO2 layer. Finally, the efficiency (η) is clearly improved from 2.20 to 3.43% when the double-layered structure of Eu0.03-TiO2/Eu0-TiO2 is adopted in the electrode in the DSSCs.
