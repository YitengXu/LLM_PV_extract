The solar cells, based on TNAs with different lengths that were sensitized by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method (SILAR) with various cycles, have been tested. The morphology and crystalline phase of the TiO2 nanotubes were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The crystallized free-standing through-hole TNAs were easily transferred to the fluorine-doped tin oxide glass to form a photoanode by slightly modifying the anodization procedure. The SILAR technique enables us to control the loading amount and particle size of CdS QDs by altering deposition cycles. The cells with TNAs ca. 20 μm long (obtained by anodization for 4 h) and 5 SILAR cycles show a photovoltaic conversion efficiency as high as 1.187% under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2).
1. Introduction
A typical dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) as proposed by Grätzel and O'Regan in 1991 is a cost-effective electrochemical device that converts solar energy to electricity,1 which provides an effective strategy to produce cheap energy for humankind. To date, the highest energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs has reached 12.3%, as recently published in Science.2 However, the metal–organic dyes are inevitably destroyed under long periods of solar light illumination, which makes it difficult to meet the practical demands. In recent years, the solar cells sensitized by inorganic quantum dots (QDs) are also very attractive, as they are more stable than organic dyes.3–11 The applications of narrow-band semiconductor quantum dots in sensitized solar cells has drawn greater interests because of their quantum-confinement effect (including impact ionization), high extinction coefficient, and the miniband effect. QDs with tunable band edges absorb light and inject electrons from their excited levels into the conduction band (CB) of some matched semiconductors, such as TiO2, opening up new venues for harvesting light energy from the UV to visible region of the solar spectrum.12 Furthermore, a multiple exciton generation effect13 found in QDs can increase the quantum yield, theoretically, which was also verified by experiments.14,15 Moreover, compared with dyes, QDs are lower cost and more easily accessible.16 Peng et al. first fabricated a CdS/TNAs electrode showing an efficiency of 4.15%,17 although the efficiency measurement method is still a matter of debate. Ma et al. prepared an S-CdS/TNTAs solar cell showing an efficiency of 0.814% with backside illumination.18 Su et al. fabricated a CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TiO2 photoanode used in quasi-solid state QDSSCs and obtained a power conversion efficiency of 3.23%.19 Researchers have also now begun to pay more attention to the theoretical study of carrier behaviour in QDSSCs.20–23
Compared with classic nanocrystalline photoanodes, titanium nanotube arrays (TNAs) can accelerate electron transport and lower the recombination probability.24,25 TNAs synthesized by anodization method have the merits of simple fabrication,26 controllable pore size27 and tube length.28 Due to their special morphologies and structure, the electron mobility and collection efficiency can be increased as the carrier's travel time in the TiO2 film is greatly reduced.29 The TNAs attached on a Ti metal substrate are not optically transparent, which greatly limits their applications in light-to-electricity conversion. Transparent TiO2 nanotube arrays were fabricated directly on ITO but the photoconversion efficiency was strictly limited by the confined thickness of the membranes.30 In addition, several advantages exist if nanotube arrays can be detached from the Ti substrates. For example, the detached nanotubes allow one to use the full potential of the material with better adsorption of photosensitizer as well as recycling the titanium metal, and more importantly, the free-standing TNAs can be used to fabricate front-illuminated solar cells. Researchers have fabricated free-standing TNAs by various methods.31–34 However, detaching TNAs from the Ti substrates seems difficult as the membrane is flat in wet conditions, dramatically cracking, fracturing and curling into small pieces during annealing treatment. It is believed that a combination of surface tension forces and strain gradients account for this curling. The key point is to synthesize crystalline TNAs before they are peeled off from the Ti substrates.
The free-standing and through-hole TNAs avoid the major drawbacks of TNAs grown on Ti foil which requires backside illumination, and are also essential for applications where transport through the nanotube is needed, such as molecular separations. Based on previous research,35,36 we developed a two-step anodization method to synthesize free-standing through-hole crystalline TNAs with tunable length and no cracks which can be transferred onto various substrates. The sealed bottoms of TNAs were completely opened by applying high voltage, leaving through-hole membranes. Using these good free-standing TNAs as photoanode materials, we report the preparation and performance of CdS QDs sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). A best photovoltaic efficiency of 1.187% was obtained after optimizing the tube length of the TNAs and deposition time of the CdS QDs. It was the first time composite CdS QDs with free-standing and through-hole TNAs were investigated for their energy conversion efficiency as CdS QDs sensitized solar cells.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Fabrication of free-standing and through-hole TiO2 nanotube membranes
Titanium foils (Ti, 0.127 mm, 99.7%; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were cut into the required size and shape, cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized water, respectively, then dried with N2 gas and processed for anodization. Free-standing and through-hole TNAs were prepared by potentiostatic anodization in a two-electrode electrochemical cell. Ti foil acts as the anode and platinum (Pt) as the cathode. The Ti foils were anodized in a 0.25 wt% NH4F ethylene glycol37 solution at 50 V using a laboratory DC power supply (Gwinstek, GPR-30H10D). The anodized samples were rinsed with deionized water and then slightly ultrasonicated in ethanol, and dried under an infrared lamp. The as-prepared TNAs were annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in order for them to dry thoroughly and the calcination temperature was increased to 450 °C for 2 h to ensure complete crystallization. The fully crystallized samples were re-anodized at 50 V for 1 min in the same electrolyte, and at the end of this anodization, a 150 V anodic voltage was applied for another 1 min to gradually detach the crystalline TNAs membranes from the Ti substrate.
2.2 Fixation of the TiO2 nanotube/FTO glass photoanode
A TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing 0.3 mL titanium isopropoxide, 0.7 g ethyl cellulose, and 16 mL terpinol, followed by magnetic stirring at 50 °C until completely dissolved. FTO glass (Heptachroma, DHS-FTO30-15, 15 Ω per square) with 2 cm × 2 cm in size was used as substrates and pretreated by rinsing in an ultrasonic bath of detergent and ethanol for 5 and 10 min in turn, then rinsing with a large amount of distilled water and lastly drying in an N2 gas stream. The edges of the FTO glass were covered with Scotch tape as the frame. TiO2 paste which worked as the binder was flattened with a glass rod on the FTO glass. There are two different orientations of the resulting TiO2 nanotube/FTO: (i) a TiO2 nanotube layer with face-up orientation attached to FTO; and (ii) a TiO2 nanotube layer with bottom-up orientation attached to FTO. For comparison, a photoanode with only a layer of TiO2 paste was also prepared by the doctor blade technique.
The free-standing and through-hole TiO2 nanotube layer was then transferred onto FTO glass with tweezers. The films were dried at 120 °C for 15 min. In order to completely eliminate the organic component in the paste, the TiO2 nanotube/FTO was re-sintered at 450 °C.
2.3 Deposition of CdS QDs on TiO2 nanotube/FTO electrodes by SILAR
The CdS QDs sensitized photoanodes were achieved via the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method (SILAR). The TiO2 nanotube/FTO electrode was successively immersed in an ionic precursor solution of cadmium and sulfide. A 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution was used as the cadmium source, while a 0.1 M Na2S ethanol and water (50:50 vol) solution was used as the sulfide source.38 For the deposition of CdS quantum dots, the TiO2 nanotube/FTO electrode was immersed in the cadmium precursor solution for 5 min, causing cadmium ions to be absorbed on and in the TiO2 nanotubes. This electrode was immersed in an ample amount of ethanol for 5 min to prevent homogenous precipitation. The electrode was then immersed in the anionic precursor solution (sodium sulfide) for 5 min. Sulfide ions reacted with the adsorbed cadmium ions on the TiO2 nanotube/FTO electrode. Finally, the electrode was immersed in an ethanol and water (50:50 vol) solution for 5 min. Thus, one SILAR cycle of CdS QDs deposition was completed. The resulting electrodes were heated at 150 °C for 10 min.
2.4 Synthesis of polysulfides
The polysulfide electrolyte used in this work was prepared using a water–methanol (7:3 vol) solution. The electrolyte contains 0.5 M Na2S, 1.25 M S, and 0.2 M KCl.39 Magnetic stirring of the electrolyte was performed until completely dissolved.
2.5 Solar cell assembly
The cell was assembled by sandwiching the polysulfide electrolyte between the CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 nanotube/FTO electrode and the counter electrode. A 60 μm parafilm (Aquaphoenix, GTM-14956) was used in the cell to separate the electrodes. The active cell area is 0.16 cm2.
2.6 Characterization
The morphology and structure of the photoanode were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). Samples for TEM investigations were prepared by mechanically scraping the CdS QDs sensitized TNAs from the FTO substrate and dispersing in ethanol, followed by transferring one drop of supernatant liquor in 3 mL ethanol. A carbon-coated copper grid was dipped in the solution for testing. The crystalline phases of the photoanode were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-RB, RigakU, Japan). The UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectrum was obtained by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-Vis DRS, MPC-3100, SHIMADZU, Japan). The photocurrent–voltage I–V characteristic curves were measured using a Newport-Oriel I–V Test Station (PVIV-412 V) with a standard light source (Newport 91578 V) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a global AM 1.5 illumination.
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Morphology of the TNAs based photoanodes
As illustrated in Scheme 1, the TNAs were fabricated by the anodization of Ti foils in a 0.25 wt% NH4F ethylene glycol solution with 50 V additional voltages (Scheme 1b). The TNAs with Ti substrate were thoroughly crystallized by annealing at 450 °C (Scheme 1c). The crystallized TNAs were re-anodized in the same electrolyte at 50 V for a very short time, and immediately followed by the application of a large anodic voltage pulse (Up) for another short period of time (Scheme 1d and e). The abrupt change of electric field breaks the originally established dynamic equilibrium between the Ti oxidation and dissolution of TiO2, initiating the formation of small-diameter nanotubes. The original nanotubes and the newly formed small nanotubes are undermined with the enhanced field-assisted dissolution resulting from the drastic increase of F− concentration at the tube bottom upon the application of Up, finally leading to the detachment of the originally formed TNAs from the Ti substrate. This operation led to the in-site separation of a non-curling, crack-free and crystallized TiO2 membrane from the Ti substrate.

Fig. 1a–c shows a cross-sectional FESEM image of TNAs prepared by the anodization of Ti foils at 50 V for (a) 2 h, (b) 8 h, and (c) 16 h. The TiO2 membranes had a thickness of 10 μm, 44 μm, and 60 μm, corresponding to the anodization times of 2 h, 8 h, and 16 h, respectively. The inset in Fig. 1(a) shows the up close examination of the top part of the TNAs. Most of the tubes were sheared on the side, no longer fully tubes. The integrated tube-like morphology was over etched during the long period of the anodization processes. The tube walls became thinner and thinner, and partially dissolved.

Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of different anodic voltages on the bottom morphology of the membranes. The membranes were prepared by conventional anodization at 50 V for 2 h (Fig. 1a), followed by the application of Up at 100 V, and 150 V, respectively, for only 1 min (Fig. 2b and c). It is clearly seen that the membranes obtained by direct anodization have the bottom closed, and show a hexagon shape (Fig. 2a). The through-hole membrane shown in Fig. 2b was obtained by applying a 100 V for 1 min at the end of anodization. Only part of the sealed nanotube was opened. Fig. 2c shows the membrane with the bottom part well-opened, obtained by a 150 V high voltage anodization for 1 min at the end of anodization. Once Up was applied, the abruptly increased current density would introduce a large compressive stress at the interface which could induce fracture. In addition, the overall process was found to be accompanied by the evolution of gas bubbles, which can also help the separation of through-hole TNAs from the substrate.35 The average inner diameter of the bottom part of the tube is around 50 nm, which is only one-third of the inner diameter of the top part. The thicker nanotube walls were able to form due to reduced fluoride attacks. It is evident that the achieved nanotubes possess an inverted, conical-shaped inner pipe.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of annealed free-standing TNAs attached to FTO glass before and after the CdS SILAR process. The TNAs were completely converted to anatase phase after sintering at 450 °C for 2 h. The predominant anatase facets of (101), (004), and (200) were clearly detected. After 5 cycles of the SILAR process in cadmium and sulphide solution, some peaks at 26.5°, 43.9°, and 52.1° were detected which correspond to the (111), (220), and (311) facets of CdS. No peaks from FTO glass were detected because of a layer of TiO2 paste between the TNAs and FTO glass. It can be seen from the optical image that the crystallized TNAs membrane changes into yellow from white, also indicating that CdS was well deposited on the TNAs.

Fig. 4 presents the FESEM images of TNAs without/with CdS QDs. In contrast with the bare TNAs in Fig. 4a, the nanotubes after 5 cycles CdS deposition in Fig. 4c are decorated with small CdS QDs. Some of the tube mouths have been partially blocked due to too much CdS accumulation at the top surface. Fig. 4b shows a tube array with extremely straight tubes and smooth tube walls. The ethylene glycol used in the anodization electrolyte created the perfect morphology of the nanotubes. The cross-sectional view of nanotubes after 5 cycles CdS deposition is shown in Fig. 4d. It is clearly seen that the walls of the nanotubes are decorated with CdS QDs and are much coarser than those of the untreated TNAs.

Fig. 5 is a TEM image of a TNA decorated with CdS QDs. It can be seen that many CdS QDs have been deposited onto the TiO2 nanotubes. Fig. 5b and c are high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) photos of the CdS QDs on TNAs. The lattice fringes of the 0.334 nm interval observed in the HRTEM photo (Fig. 5c) of the CdS QDs can be indexed to the (111) planes of hawleyite (JCPDS 10-0454). The selected particle electron diffraction (Fig. 5d) of Fig. 5c illustrates the crystalline structure which could co-verify the hawleyite phase of QDs. The physical dimension of the CdS QDs is ca. 7 nm, which is on the order of the exciton Bohr radius of CdS (2.9 nm).

3.2 Optical properties
Fig. 6 shows UV-Vis absorption spectra of bare TNAs and TNAs decorated with CdS QDs for different deposition times. All the TNAs were obtained by anodizing Ti substrate for 2 h and the nanotube length is ca. 10 μm. Bare TNAs mainly absorb UV light with a threshold of 390 nm. The TNAs with CdS QDs from only one cycle of SILAR show a weak absorption between 400 and 450 nm. Further deposition of CdS QDs onto TNAs expands their adsorption range to 660 nm. The red-shifts of the absorption shoulder and onset position with increasing SILAR cycles imply the growth of the CdS QDs. After 5 cycles of deposition, the red-shift almost became saturated.

3.3 Photovoltaic performances
To test the photovoltaic performance of the free-standing TNAs membranes, Grätzel type solar cells with different NT lengths were fabricated and tested under AM 1.5 G conditions. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 7 with Voc, Jsc, FF and energy conversion efficiency (η) listed in Table 1. A reference sample only with a layer of TiO2 paste was also fabricated as photo-anode and tested. QDSSCs with a 1300 nm TiO2 paste showed poor energy conversion efficiency of only 0.082%. It can be seen that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) remained almost the same with different anodization times. Short-circuit current density (Jsc) obtained with 4 h anodization time show the highest value of 6.382 mA cm−2. The energy conversion efficiency of the cells first increased then decreased, with the length of the free-standing through-hole TNAs increasing from 10 to 60 μm, regardless of the TNAs attaching orientation. The highest energy conversion efficiency of 1.187% is obtained when the TNAs length is 20 μm face-up attaching to FTO with 5 cycles SILAR.

The impact of the amount of deposited CdS on the performance of the QDSSCs was also tested. Table 2 gives the photovoltaic parameters of QDSSCs with different SILAR cycles. The QDSSCs with TNAs face-up exhibited better performance than bottom-up, which may be caused by better CdS QDs deposition on the over etched nanotube mouth. These results showed that for films of the same thickness (obtained by anodizing for 4 h with face-up attachment), the amount of deposited CdS has a direct impact on the performance of the QDSSCs. The Jsc keeps growing with the increasing number of SILAR cycles, with the highest value of 6.382 mA cm−2 after depositing for 5 cycles, which is mainly attributed to the higher incorporation amount and better coverage of CdS QDs on TNAs. With the increase of SILAR cycles, η increases at first, and then decreases after reaching a maximum value. The maximum efficiency was obtained at the photoanodes prepared by 5 SILAR cycles. It is believed that the decrease of Jsc was ascribed to the increase in SILAR cycles producing problems with CdS agglomeration at the top of the TNAs, increasing the scattering and recombination of photogenerated electrons, partially blocking the tunnel for charge transferrence.40 The high concentration of QD/QD interfaces increase the average time needed for transferring the photoexcited electrons from the QDs to the photoanode.41 The Voc and FF vary little with SILAR cycles. The open-circuit voltage Voc is determined by the quasi-Fermi level of the electron in the photoanode and the redox potential of the polysulfide electrolyte. According to previous research,42 solar cells assembled with TiO2 and polysulfide electrolyte usually have a Voc of ca. 0.5 V. The relatively low Voc in our experiments was due to the different ingredient polysulfide electrolyte and tiny difference in the microstructure of the photoanode. The size of the QDs CdS controls the harvesting of light energy in the solar spectrum. CdS absorbing light in the wavelength regions from 390 to 660 nm could provide Jsc values of up to 0.937 and 6.382 mA cm−2.

It can be seen from our experiments that the efficiency of QDSSCs was closely related to the nanostructures of TiO2 nanotube arrays. The geometrical parameters of the photoanode, like nanotube diameter, wall thickness, and length of the TiO2 nanotube arrays, affect the sensitizer deposition and charge transfer in solar cells. The development of a theoretical kinetic model43 to explore the relationship between sensitizer deposition, charge transport and nanotube geometry would be very useful in further research.
4. Conclusions
Free-standing through-hole TNAs have potential in high efficiency QDSSCs. In this paper, we developed a reproducible method to obtain crystalline free-standing through-hole TNA membranes by a two-step anodization and subsequent fixation on FTO glasses with two different configurations. It was found that conversion of TNAs from the amorphous to the anatase phase before peeling off from the Ti substrate is crucial for the fabrication of free-standing TNAs in good condition. CdS QDs were assembled in situ on the photoanode by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. A 1.187% energy conversion efficiency was obtained in a cell with CdS QDs and a polysulfide electrolyte, in which a 20 μm thick TNAs membrane was used. We attributed this to the advantageous front light irradiation and high mobility electron transport. The QDSSCs with TNAs attaching face-up to FTO perform a little better than those with a face-down configuration.
