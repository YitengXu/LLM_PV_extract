    , Accepted 6th March 2022First published on 8th March 2022AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) suffer from deep level defects which would cause charge accumulation and consequent non-radiative recombination losses during the operation of the device, limiting their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, we employ small molecule dicyandiamide (DICY) as a passivating agent for the deep level defects of perovskite thin films. The C–N bond (C–NH–C) of DICY is found to be Lewis acidic due to the inductive effect of Lewis basic imine (–CN) and cyano (–CN) functional groups of DICY. So, the synergistic effect of the functional groups in DICY could passivate the deep level defects by forming a Lewis adduct by coordination bonds, which is proved by density functional theory calculations and SCLC measurements. The elimination of the deep level defects of perovskite thin films results in a reduced charge recombination and more efficient charge transport. Consequently, the optimized PSC based on DICY shows a champion PCE of 20.05%. Our findings reveal the mechanisms of the synergistic effect of the functional groups in the small molecule on passivating the deep level defects of perovskites.
Introduction
Photovoltaic research was revolutionized by perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of the impressive improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 25.7% in the last decade.1–4 It has emerged as one of the most promising solar cell materials owing to its unique combination of properties, such as an outstanding absorption coefficient,5–8 superb carrier mobility9–11 and long charge carrier diffusion length.12,13
Despite the rapid development of PSCs, the deep level defects of perovskite thin films in PSCs are one of the main factors which retard the PCEs of PSC.14 The predominant trap sources for non-radiative recombination losses in PSCs are deep level defects, which have a thermal activation energy higher than kBT.15,16 In comparison, shallow level defects have a negligible impact on non-radiative decays and Voc.14 In perovskite thin films, the deep level defects are mainly the surface defects such as undercoordinated Pb2+, Pb–I antisite and undercoordinated I− which could create main deep level centers, confirmed by experimental results.17 All these deep level defects in perovskites will cause charge accumulation and consequent non-radiative recombination losses during the operation of the device, resulting in a decrease in the performance of the perovskite device.18
Therefore, reducing the deep level defects of perovskite thin films is necessary for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, and a large number of methods have been demonstrated.19,20 Among all these passivation methods, additive engineering is one of the most effective ways to passivate the deep level defects.21 Typically, the charged nature of defects in perovskites enables unique passivation methods like coordinate bonding or ionic bonding to neutralize and de-activate deep level defects.22 Hence, the Lewis acids and bases theory is an effective way to design a passivating agent for the deep level defects. In detail, Lewis acids can passivate undercoordinated I and Pb–I antisite defects by forming a Lewis adduct by coordinate bonding, whereas undercoordinated Pb and/or Pb clusters can be reduced by Lewis bases that donate lone pair electrons.15 Therefore, the addition of Lewis acid or base additives can favorably coordinate to the undesired deep level defects by forming a Lewis adduct. In our previous work, Lewis basic carbon quantum dots were incorporated into the perovskite film to passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects.23 Nevertheless, the carbon quantum dots could only passivate Lewis acidic defects. Normally, various small molecules were designed based on the Lewis acids and bases theory for passivating the deep level defects, such as capsaicin and theophylline.17,24 However, the synergistic effect of functional groups in a single small molecule on the passivation of deep level defects in perovskite films is still not clear and more research is necessary to shed more light on this matter.
In this work, we employed small molecule dicyandiamide (DICY) as the passivating agent for deep level defects of perovskite thin films. The Lewis basic imine (–CN) and cyano (–CN) functional groups of DICY could passivate the Lewis acidic undercoordinated Pb2+ defects. On the other hand, the C–N bond (C–NH–C) of DICY was found to be Lewis basic due to the inductive effect of the imine and cyano functional groups of DICY. So, the Lewis basic C–N bond of DICY could passivate the Lewis acidic Pb–I antisite defects. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations theoretically revealed the interaction between the DICY and deep level defects in the perovskite, indicating its defect passivation effect. FTIR and XPS analysis proved the interaction between the functional groups of DICY and the deep level defects of the perovskite. Finally, the SCLC and UPS measurements confirmed the reduction in the deep level defect density in the DICY passivated perovskite films. We achieved a PCE value higher than 20% and prolonged the stability of DICY passivated PSCs without any encapsulation. Our findings demonstrate the mechanisms of the functional groups in the small molecules that have a synergistic effect on passivating the deep level defects in perovskites. This can improve both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussions
Firstly, to find out the suitable concentration of DICY in perovskite precursor solutions, SEM, XRD and optical absorption measurements of perovskite films were performed. The perovskite films fabricated with different concentrations of DICY (0.5 mg mL−1, 1 mg mL−1, 2 mg mL−1 and 10 mg mL−1) were named 0.5DICY, 1DICY, 2DICY and 10DICY respectively. Fig. 1a and b illustrate the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the surface morphology of perovskite films. All the films express full surface coverage and the 1DICY film has the largest grains among all the samples (Fig. S1, ESI†). The mean grain size is approximated to be ∼220 nm for the control film and ∼520 nm for 1DICY (Fig. 1c), which illustrates the lower grain boundaries in the 1DICY film. The cross-section SEM (Fig. 1d and e) further proves the increase in grain size and most of the grains penetrate the entire cross section, which is beneficial for the charge transport. The change in grain size is also proved by the results of dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements.25 As shown in Fig. 1f, the micellar size in the precursor increased with increasing concentration of DICY. We speculated the increase in grain size of the DICY doped perovskite films is through the interaction of DICY and PbI2 which increased the micellar size in the precursor. The effects of DICY doping on the crystallinity of MAPbI3 were investigated through XRD measurements. The XRD patterns (Fig. 1g) of samples revealed that the structure of the perovskite corresponded to the orthorhombic space group.23 A slight increase in the diffraction peak intensities of the (110) and (220) planes was observed for the 1DICY sample compared with the control sample. This implies that a suitable concentration of DICY can enhance the crystallinity of the perovskite. However, the diffraction peak intensities decrease when the DICY concentration is higher than 1 mg mL−1, which implies the excess of DICY would distort the lattice of the perovskite. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1h, the peak of 1DICY starts to shift to lower degrees compared to the control film, which indicates the increase in lattice parameters. The expanded lattice may be attributed to the penetration of DICY into the perovskite lattice, because the radii of DICY should be larger than the MA +. Furthermore, the diffraction peak intensity for 10DICY is lower than the control sample (Fig. S2, ESI†). This also indicates that the excess of DICY could distort the perovskite lattice, which is harmful for the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite.26 The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1i) illustrate the same trend as the XRD data. An enhancement in the absorption of visible light was found in the 1DICY film, compared with the control film. This could be attributed to the improved grain size and higher crystallinity of the 1DICY doped perovskite.27 However, a decrease in absorption was observed in the 10DICY film compared with the control film (Fig. S5, ESI†). We ascribed this decrease to the lower crystallinity of the excess DICY doped perovskite. Given the above, we conclude that there is a certain interaction between DICY and perovskite, which results in a high-quality film with large grains and fewer grain boundaries.

In order to determine the interaction between the DICY and perovskite, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to reveal the Electrostatic Potential Surfaces (EPS) of DICY.18 As shown in Fig. 2a, the imine (–CN) and cyano (–CN) functional groups of DICY show a negative potential surface due to dipoles induced by the N atom, which could donate electrons, while the C–N bond of DICY shows a positive potential surface because of the inductive effect.28,29 Therefore, the –CN and –CN bonds in the DICY molecule would act as the Lewis base, which could donate electrons. The C–N bond in the DICY molecule would act as the Lewis acid, which could accept electrons. Generally, the Lewis acidic undercoordinated Pb2+ defects (n-type) and the Lewis basic Pb–I antisite defects (p-type) are the two typical deep level defects, which were reported to form deep level traps.30,31 So, we suppose that the Lewis acidic undercoordinated Pb2+ defects could interact with the Lewis basic –CN and –CN functional groups of DICY and the Lewis basic Pb–I antisite defects could interact with the Lewis acidic C–N functional group of DICY.22

The 3D isosurface plots of the LUMO levels: (c) Pb–I antisite defects (bracketed in red oval) in perovskite and (d) DICY passivated Pb–I antisite defects (bracketed in red oval). 
In order to find out which kind of C–N bond (C–NH2 or C–NH–C) passivated the Pb–I antisite defect, the electron distributions in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (Fig. S6, ESI†) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels (Fig. 2c and d) of the unpassivated Pb–I antiste defects and DICY passivated Pb–I antisite defects were calculated by DFT.18,26 It is evident that the electron distributions on Pb–I antisite are different due to the introduction of DICY near the Pb–I antisite defects. The LUMO electron distributions locate on the Pb–I antisite defect of unpassivated perovskite (Fig. 2c). But the LUMO electrons of the Pb–I antisite defect would interact with the LUMO electrons of the C–N bond (C–NH–C) of DICY as shown in Fig. 2d. This indicates that the LUMO electrons are delocalized from the Pb–I antisite defect of the perovskite to the C–N bond (C–NH–C) of DICY.18 Besides, the partial density of states (PDOS) of the perovskite were calculated to confirm the effect of this interaction on the Pb–I antisite defects.32 The PDOS of the DICY passivated and Pb–I antisite defects are reversed to provide a side-by-side comparison, as shown in Fig. 2b. The calculated results show that the trap states are almost eliminated and the band edges are also shifted, which are primarily due to the passivation of the Pb–I antisite defect by the C–N bond of DICY.17
Furthermore, to prove the interaction between the deep level defects in the MAPbI3 film and the functional groups of DICY in experiments, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, the characteristic peaks of the CN bond stretching vibrations in DICY are located at 2207 cm−1 and 2165 cm−1. These characteristic peaks shift to 2203 cm−1 and 2261 cm−1 in the DICY modified MAPbI3 film. The downward shift of the CN bond stretching vibration frequency resulted from the lone pair electrons on the CN bond electron delocalized to the empty orbit of the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects in MAPbI3 when the Lewis acid–base adduct was formed.33 This demonstrates a strong interaction between the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and the CN bond in DICY. Similarly, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the characteristic peak of the CN bond stretching vibrations also shifts to a lower frequency in the DICY-PbI2 complex (the characteristic peak of the CN bond was covered by the N–H bend of MA+ in the DICY modified MAPbI3 film (Fig. S8, ESI†)). Hence, the Lewis acidic undercoordinated Pb2+ defects could be passivated by the coordination bond with the Lewis basic CN and CN bond of DICY.34 Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3b, the characteristic peak of the C–N bond (C–NH–C) stretching (1094 cm−1) in DICY modified MAPbI3 shifts downward compared with the DICY molecule (1098 cm−1) (the pure MAPbI3 doesn’t have this bond). This suggests that the energy of the C–N bond is reduced by the interaction between the Lewis acidic C–N bond and Lewis basic Pb–I antisite defects. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) characterization was carried out to examine the charge transfer in the coordination interactions between the DICY molecule and deep level defects. As shown in Fig. 3d, the Pb 4f signals of the MAPbI3 film are located at 143.2 eV and 138.3 eV, which shift to lower binding energies by about 0.2 eV of the DICY modified perovskite. These negative shifts in Pb 4f binding energies after DICY doping suggest the decrease in the cationic charge of the Pb2+ ions within MAPbI3.35,36 This is in accordance with the result of FTIR in which the lone pair electrons on the CN bond and CN bond delocalized to the empty orbit of the undercoordinated Pb2+ in MAPbI3. Moreover, the I 3d signals of the MAPbI3 film (Fig. 3c) are located at 630.5 eV and 619.1 eV, which shift to higher binding energies by about 0.2 eV of the DICY modified MAPbI3. This positive shift in I 3d binding energy indicates the decrease in the anionic charge of the I− ions within MAPbI3. Since the Lewis basic Pb–I antisite defects were neutralized by the Lewis acidic C–N bond through the coordination bond.

For the purpose of investigating the passivation effect of the DICY in perovskite solar cells, devices with a p–i–n structure were fabricated. The J–V curves of the champion cells with different concentrations of DICY under AM1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 4a (the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1, ESI†). It is illustrated that the control device shows a PCE of 18.41% with a VOC of 1.083 V, JSC of 21.869 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.7%. For the 1DICY device, the PV performance is enhanced with a PCE of 20.05% (Voc of 1.132 V, Jsc of 22.439 mA cm−2 and FF of 78.9%). The hysteresis, steady-state photocurrent and PCE output of the champion control and 1DICY based cells were also tested to investigate the performance of the cells. Negligible hysteresis can be found in all devices, which proves the reliability of the J–V data (Fig. 4b and Table S2, ESI†). In order to investigate the escalation in photo-current, the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of devices was tested.37,38 A stronger spectral response was observed in Fig. 4c, which was consistent with the promotion in short-circuit current density. The integrated current densities were calculated according to the IPCE data as 20.72 mA cm−2 for the control device and 22.02 mA cm−2 for the 1DICY device. The stabilized power output curve is obtained by holding the voltage at the maximum power point continually for 500 s (Fig. 4d). A steady PCE of 18.04% with a 20.11 mA cm−2 at 0.897 V was achieved in the control device. In comparison, a steady PCE of 19.76% was achieved with a 20.91 mA cm−2 at a bias voltage of 0.945 V with the 1DICY device. Combined with the results above, we believe the J–V measurement is reliable enough. The detailed statistical photovoltaic performance of the PSCs is listed in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The photovoltaic parameters are enhanced with the incorporation of DICY, and distributed in a narrow range, suggesting the excellent reproducibility.

To further investigate the origin of improvement in the pivotal parameters of perovskite solar cells with DICY, several measurements were taken. The effect of the passivation of DICY in perovskite solar cells was firstly characterized by photo luminescence spectroscopy (PL) and time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) data. Fig. 4e shows the PL peaks fixed at around 760 nm for all the samples. However, the PL intensity of the 1DICY film is higher than that of the control film. The increase in PL intensities indicates a less non-radiative recombination loss for the DICY modified perovskite film. This could be attributed to the passivation effect of DICY in the perovskite.23 Furthermore, with the hole transport layer (HTL), the PL intensities of the 1DICY film are lower than those for the control film. It could be the case that there is a better carrier separation at the interface between the perovskite and HTL for the DICY modified film. Moreover, TRPL was investigated to determine how the passivation of DICY influences the carrier dynamics in depth. A bi-exponential decay function was used to fit the PL decay time (τi) and the amplitudes (Ai) of the samples (Fig. 4f and Table S3, ESI†).39,40 The control sample's PL decay time are τ1 = 7.99 ns and τ2 = 35.67 ns, while the 1DICY sample's PL decay times are τ1 = 16.43 ns and τ2 = 63.65 ns. Hence, the longer non-radiative fast decay time τ2 for the 1DICY sample indicates less traps in the perovskite. Not only this, the TRPL of the perovskite with HTL samples was also investigated. However, in the Glass/Transport layer/Perovskite sample, the fast decay time τ1 originated from the quenching of charge carriers at the interface, while the long decay time τ2 is still attributed to the recombination of free charge carriers due to traps in the bulk.41 A shorter non-radiative fast-decay time τ1 for the 1DICY sample (1.56 ns) indicates more efficient hole transportation at the interface compared with the control sample (1.85 ns). In order to further study the carrier dynamics, we used eqn (1) to determine the difference in average carrier lifetime (τavg). (1)
The τavg increased from 29.85 ns to 54.13 ns for the control and the 1DICY sample, respectively. The longer average carrier lifetime suggests less traps in the perovskite which was passivated by the DICY, making it less possible for carriers to quench. Moreover, with the HTL, the τavg decreased from 4.88 ns to 3.53 ns for the control and 1DICY sample, respectively. This reveals that the hole extraction at the interface of the perovskite/HTL is accelerated by the passivation of defects at the interface by DICY, which is consistent with the reduced PL peak intensity. The band structure of the PTAA/perovskite interface also proves the enhanced hole extraction (Fig. S16 and 17, ESI†). The larger energy level offset between the perovskite and HTL suggests a stronger driving force for the charge transfer, which is beneficial for hole extraction in the solar cells.42
In order to quantitatively verify the passivation effect induced by the DICY, we performed space charge-limited current (SCLC) characterization to measure both the electron and hole trap-state densities (Ntrap) of the devices with and without DICY.43Fig. 4g and h show the fitting dark J–V curves of the device based on the control and 1DICY perovskite thin films, with the electron only device structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag and the hole-only device structure of ITO/PTAA/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. In the trap-filling limit (TFL) region, the trap is filled until the trap fill limit voltage (VTFL) as bias increases.7 Typically, the value of Ntraps can be calculated according to eqn (2): (2)where ε, ε0, L and e are the vacuum dielectric constant, relative permittivity, thickness of the film, and elementary charge and VTFL is obtained from the fitting of the J–V curves. As shown in Fig. 4g, the VTFL values based on the electron only structure are 0.242 V and 0.193 V for the control device and 1DICY device, respectively. The electron trap state densities were estimated to be 1.37 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.09 × 1016 cm−3 for the control device and 1DICY device, respectively. In the hole-only device (shown in Fig. 5h), the VTFL for the control and 1DICY device were 0.146 V and 0.085 V. Correspondingly, the hole trap state densities are 8.26 × 1015 cm−3 and 4.81 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. Both the electron and hole trap state density decrease after incorporation of DICY into the MAPbI3 perovskite films, which is direct evidence of the passivation effect of DICY on reducing the deep level defects of the perovskite. The reduced defects of the perovskite films were also proved by the Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) data. The ideal MAPbI3 was supposed to be an intrinsic semiconductor as in previous reports (band gap: 1.55 eV).24 This means the Fermi level should be 0.775 eV towards the VBM. But there is a large number of defects which make the Fermi level of the perovskite shift toward the VBM or CBM. The Fermi energy level with respect to the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite films shifts from 1.14 to 0.8 eV (Fig. S12, ESI†) after the introduction of DICY according to the UPS data. This indicates that the surface energetics become more intrinsic after the passivation of defects by DICY. Because the Fermi level of the DICY based perovskite film (0.8 eV) is closer than the control film (1.14 eV) to the supposed intrinsic Fermi level of the perovskite (0.775 eV). In detail, the n-type undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and p-type Pb–I antisite defects on the surface of the perovskite films were effectively passivated by DICY. So, the surface of the perovskite film becomes more intrinsic after the incorporation of DICY.

(d) The normalized PCEs against time measured under 80% humidity in the dark at room temperature. 
To further understand the recombination kinetics of the PSC devices, we measured Voc at various light intensities.23 Under light illumination, the light intensity-dependent characteristics of the control devices and 1DICY devices were obtained and fitted by using the Schottky eqn (3): (3)
Typically, the ideality factor n represents the dominant recombination mechanism in optoelectronic devices, and n exceeding 1 indicates the presence of additional trap-assisted Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, while a smaller n corresponds to a reduced monomolecular SRH recombination process, leading to an improved device performance. According to this equation, the n of the control device and modified device were estimated to be 1.561 and 1.276, respectively, from the slope of fitting in Fig. 4i. The decrease in the n value for the 1DICY device suggests the suppression of trap-assisted carrier recombination,16 which is consistent with the passivation of deep level defects induced by DICY doping.
The reduced charge recombination and more efficient charge transport in the 1DICY device were also characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).44,45 The Nyquist plots of the EIS analysis are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The equivalent circuit was composed of recombination resistance (Rrec), series resistance (Rs) and a parallel capacitor which was used to estimate the value of Rrec and Rs. Typically, Rs stands for the sheet resistance of the charge-transfer resistance at the interface. The Rrec reflects the resistance of charge recombination at the interface or within the perovskite lattice.46 Compared with the control device, the 1DICY device exhibits a decreased Rs from 43.74 Ω to 32 Ω, and an increased Rrec from 2857 Ω to 5756 Ω (Table S4, ESI†), revealing that the DICY passivates the deep level defects in perovskite films, which enhanced the charge transport at the interface and reduced the charge recombination in the perovskite.
The devices were studied using capacitance spectroscopy to gain a more in-depth understanding of the carrier profile, defect level, and defect dispersion.47 The Mott–Schottky figure was created using capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements (Fig. S15, ESI†). Both devices were discovered to be entirely depleted, indicating the presence of a p–i–n junction with the perovskite layer acting as an intrinsic semiconductor.48 The x-intercept of the linear regime in the Mott–Schottky plot can be used to determine the diffusion potential.49 The larger diffusion potential was found in the 1DICY device (0.82 V), compared with the control device (0.65 V), which is consistent with the higher Voc. This indicates a stronger built-in field, which could result in the more effective charge extraction.48
The long-term stability of DICY passivated PSCs was investigated to prove the passivation effect of DICY. Firstly, a more hydrophobic perovskite surface was found in the 1DICY film by contact angle analysis compared with the control film (Fig. 5a and b). This implies that the defects passivation by DICY in perovskite can slow the moisture ingression kinetics. Secondly, the XRD patterns of the control and 1DICY thin films after 7 days of storage under a humidity of 80% at room temperature without encapsulation were investigated (Fig. 5c). The peak at 12.4° for the control thin film suggests the formation of PbI2 which comes from the degradation of the perovskite. Nevertheless, the XRD pattern of the 1DICY thin film does not show additional peaks, indicating that the defects passivated by DICY enhance the stability of the perovskite. The long-term stability of the uncapsulated devices based on the control and 1DICY is also measured with an ambient atmosphere. The normalized PCEs against time are shown in Fig. 5d. It is obvious that the passivated film is more stable than the control film. The PCE of the 1DICY device remained at 56.7% of its initial while the PCE of the control film-based device degrades to 35.6% of its initial value. We believed that the improvement in stability is due to the passivation of the deep level defects by DICY. The thermal stability of the PSCs was also measure under 85 °C (Fig. S14, ESI†). Only a little increase in the PCE can be found. This little improvement can be attributed to the fact that the deep level defects were passivated by the DICY. The passivation of the deep level defects could suppress the degradation of the perovskite from moisture and heat.
Conclusions
In summary, we employed small molecule DICY as the passivating agent for the deep level defects of perovskite thin films. We found that the C–N bond (C–NH–C) of DICY is Lewis acidic due to the inductive effect of the Lewis basic imine and cyano functional groups of DICY. So, the deep level defects can be passivated by the synergistic effect of the functional groups in DICY. The reduced deep level defects were proved using DFT calculations, and FTIR and XPS analysis. The elimination of the deep level defects in the perovskite thin films results in a reduced charge recombination and a more efficient charge transport. Finally, we achieved a PCE value higher than 20% and prolonged stability of DICY passivated PSCs without any encapsulation. Our findings reveal the mechanisms of the synergistic effect of the functional groups in the small molecule on passivating the deep level defects of perovskites, which can improve the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.
