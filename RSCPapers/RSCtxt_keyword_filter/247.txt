    , Accepted 31st March 2022First published on 1st April 2022AbstractThis work introduces a new type of elevated temperature material processing technique for the preparation of a bilayer TiO2-coated ITO PET (indium tin oxide polyethylene terephthalate) polymer photoanode of flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) producing a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.33%. In this process, TiO2 nanoscale and mesoscale layers are deposited sequentially onto a flexible ITO PET polymer and sintered in the presence of a chiller + heat sink + compression press heating system (hot plate). The chiller reduces the heat sink surface temperature up to −14 °C, while the interconnection of TiO2 layers kept between the heat sink and hot plate develops by mild sintering at 250 °C. As a result, the bilayer FDSSC photoanode prepared via this process has showed the highest photocurrent density of 15.91 ± 0.17 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.71 V, surpassing the other literature reported values of PET polymer-based FDSSCs. Besides, as part of the device engineering, different TiO2 nanostructures such as TiO2 nanoparticles (TNP) and TiO2 nanowires (TNW) have been employed as mesoscale light scattering layers in the bilayer photoanodes of FDSSCs. The photovoltaic current density–voltage (J–V) and electrochemical impedance studies have confirmed the superiority of one-dimensional TNW structures with greater charge transport and light scattering ability for significantly improving the photovoltaic performances of the laboratory-scale FDSSCs and large-area FDSSC tapes/rolls.
1. Introduction
Flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) are distinguished as a promising low-cost technology for eco-friendly solar power production since they can be fabricated from inexpensive raw materials by simple fabrication methods compared to the other flexible solar cells (FSCs) such as flexible amorphous silicon,1 CdTe,2 CIGS3 and perovskite4 solar cells with superior photovoltaic performances. Among the FSCs, FDSSCs show superior amenability to adopt different shapes and power requirements of portable electronic products,5 to attach the surface of windows in the building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs),6 to use as wearable photovoltaic textiles7 and to the roll-to-roll fabrication process that can facilitate their earliest mass production with the reduced manufacturing cost.8–10 Besides the enormous potential for FDSSCs made using plastic substrates as light-weight and cost-effective portable power sources, research on improving their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. As a result, the PCE of current benchmark plastic FDSSCs has improved up to 7.6%.11 In addition, a new type of tubular FDSSC architecture comprising a plastic capillary tube photoanode coated with a TiO2 nanotube and a platinum microwire counter electrode introduced by Liang and coworkers has produced a remarkable PCE of 9.1%.12
In general, conventional glass substrate-based high-performance DSSC photoelectrodes are heat-treated (sintered) above 450 °C during their preparation to obtain well-connected, mesoporous TO2 interparticle networks for efficient collection and transport of the photogenerated electrons.13 However, such heat treatment process is hampered in the plastic FDSSC photoelectrode preparations by the severe serviceable temperature limitation (less than 150 °C) of most polymers. To surmount the temperature limitation posed for inorganic semiconductor material processing/sintering on plastic substrates, namely, PET (indium tin oxide polyethylene terephthalate), PEN (indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene naphthalate), mesoporous PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) and so on,14 several mild material processing methods such as physical compression,15 chemical vapor deposition,16 chemical methods,17 UV-assisted method,18 lift-off method,19 and mild thermal (<150 °C) sintering20 have been explored thus far for the construction of high-efficiency FDSSCs.21 According to these literature methods, the sintering temperature of TiO2 film-coated polymer substrates cannot be increased beyond 150 °C, but the minimum required sintering temperature for the TiO2 film in the photoelectrode reported is 450 °C, for achieving the glass substrate-based DSSC benchmark PCE of 13%.22 Moreover, to date, the highest PCE achieved from plastic FDSSCs using a Degussa P25 TiO2 powder, and using TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by a hydrothermal method is 6.3%23 and 7.6%,11 respectively. In both the accomplishments, a 100–200 MPa high-pressure compression sintering method was utilized to increase the TiO2 particles compaction and adhesion with the ITO PEN substrates. However, ITO PET, despite the inexpensiveness and widely employed conducting polymer substrate for the fabrication of FDSSCs, the highest PCE achieved till date from the ITO PET-based FDSSCs is only 5.8%. One of the chief factors affecting its employability in the FDSSC performance improvements is low heat-treatment temperature; for PET, the heat-treatment temperature is 120 °C and, for PEN, the heat-treatment temperature is 160 °C. This deficiency of the PET polymer has hampered earlier attempts to substantially increase the calcination temperature of the semiconductor film deposited on the ITO PET substrate, for removing organic additives and impurities that can critically increase the film resistance and reduce the charge transport.24 Furthermore, the decrease in charge transport can enhance the charge recombination at the photoanode and reduce the charge collection efficiency of the FDSSC. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the viable directions to prepare semiconductor films on polymer substrates at the highest processable temperatures without affecting its stability and integrity, for improving the electron transport and charge collection efficiency of the FDSSCs.25 Much recently, we have reported plate fin heat sink-assisted elevated temperature sintering of TiO2 film-deposited ITO PET substrates to function as photoanodes of plastic FDSSCs, wherein the TiO2 film-coated ITO PET substrates are heat-treated up to 250 °C without thermal decomposition and integrity loss of PET polymers. Subsequently, the plastic FDSSCs fabricated using the PET-based flexible photoanodes have generated a maximum PCE of 4.11%.26
Furthermore, a conventional high-performance DSSC photoanode contains a mesoporous film of 20 to 30 nm-size nanocrystalline TiO2 particles randomly interconnected via networks, which inherently possess a large surface area suitable for the copious sorption of sensitizing dye molecules.27 Such structure of mesoporous film is transparent and shows low-intensity Rayleigh scattering leading to the poor visible light absorption of the dye molecules.28 Therefore, boosting visible light absorption of the dye molecules by the introduction of light scattering centers or layers within the TiO2 mesoporous film of the photoanode has long been considered an effective strategy, since this approach significantly increases the light harvesting efficiency of the photoanode.29 Moreover, the randomly packed TiO2 nanoparticle networks within the mesoporous film containing grain boundaries and traps at surfaces increase the recombination and reduce the transport of photogenerated electrons, which, in turn, diminish the charge collection efficiency of the photoanode.30 To address these detrimental effects and to improve the light absorption, charge collection and transport properties of the photoanode, the TiO2 mesoporous film containing bi- or multi-layered architecture with light scattering layer supporting the enhanced light-scattering effect, higher surface area for the superior dye uptake, and rapid transport and collection of charges for the improved charge collection efficiency is deemed indispensable. Accordingly, the glass substrate-based high-efficiency DSSCs fabricated using photoanodes of bi- or multi-layered TiO2 films containing various TiO2 micro/nanostructures as light scattering layers demonstrating the above-mentioned features are very familiar in the literature.31 However, reports on the ITO PET polymer-based photoanode comprising bilayer TiO2 films with a light scattering layer, showing superior light absorption and charge collection efficiency known for the fabrication of high-efficiency FDSSCs, are rare. Thus, in this work, we introduce a chiller + heat sink + hot plate system-supported novel elevated temperature material processing technique for the preparation of the bilayer TiO2 film-coated ITO PET photoanode of FDSSCs, which produce the maximum PCE of 6.33%. Besides, we have studied the one-dimensional TiO2 nanowire (TNW) structures with greater charge transport and light scattering ability as the light scatting layer for enormously improving the photovoltaic performances of laboratory-scale FDSSCs and large-area FDSSC tapes/rolls.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene terephthalate (ITO PET) was procured from Solaronix Switzerland, N719 dye from Dyesol (Greatcell solar) Australia. Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), commercial TiO2 nanopowder (anatase) (TNP), iodine, graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), 4-tertiary butyl pyridine, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate, titanium nitride (TiN), lithium iodide, and ethylene glycol were procured from Sigma Aldrich, India. Deep Freezer was purchased from Western Equipments (India). Commercially available copper heat sink and compression press + hot plate set ups employed in the polymer processing were customized to fit the proposed fabrication process of the FDSSCs.
2.2. Preparation of TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanowire pastes
First, 1 g of TiO2 nanoparticles (anatase) was loaded in a crucible and annealed at 400 °C for 30 min to remove the adsorbed moisture, gases, and other volatile organic impurities. Subsequently, the crucible was cooled to room temperature and 10 mL ethanol was added to the TiO2 nanoparticles to obtain the ethanolic dispersion. This dispersion was sonicated in a bath sonicator for 30 min, and then stirred up to 12 h at 300 rpm with a magnetic stirrer to produce a homogenous off-white paste. This paste was directly used for the TiO2 film deposition on the ITO PET by the doctor-blading method.
TiO2 nanowires (anatase) required for the light-scattering layer paste preparation were synthesized by following a previously reported procedure.32,33 For the paste preparation, 1 g of TiO2 nanowires were gradually added and mixed with 10 mL of ethanol solvent using a mortar and pestle for 5 min, and then continuously mixed for another 30 min. Later, this mixture was blended well with a magnetic stirrer for 24 h to produce a fully homogeneous mixture. Subsequently, the homogeneous mixture was ultrasonicated for 60 min to get an off-white liquid. This off-white liquid was condensed under low pressure using a rotary evaporator connected with a vacuum pump to obtain the smooth off-white viscous paste.
2.3. Fabrication of bilayer TiO2 film-coated ITO PET photoanodes and counter electrodes
The PET polymer-based flexible bilayer photoanodes with different TiO2 light-scattering layers were prepared using a chiller + heat sink + compression press heating system (hot plate). Initially, the TiO2 nanoparticles paste underlayer was coated onto clean ITO PET substrates by the doctor blading technique (cell active area of 0.16 cm2). The TiO2-coated ITO PET substrates were dried in air for 30 min, and then sintered in between a hot plate kept at 250 °C and a plate fin heat sink surface supercooled in the ranges of −10 °C to −14 °C for another 30 min. In the second step, the TiO2 monolayer-coated ITO PET substrates were cooled slowly to room temperature, and then different light scattering TiO2 nanostructure pastes were coated separately on the individual TiO2 nanoparticle-coated ITO PET substrate as the second layer by the doctor blading method, while keeping the Scotch™ tape thickness double, maintaining the same cell active area (0.16 cm2) and dried in air for 30 min. Subsequently, each TiO2 bilayer-coated ITO PET substrate was again sintered at 250 °C in between the hotplate and heat sink system, as described in the first step. In the final step while cooling substrates to 80 °C, each TiO2 bilayer-coated ITO PET substrate was soaked into 0.1 mM ethanolic solution of N719 dye for 8 h separately (long hours of soaking lead to the TiO2 layers peeling off from the substrates). Then, the dye-coated TiO2 bilayer ITO PET substrates were rinsed in ethanol, dried in air, and used as flexible bilayer photoanodes. A flexible platinum photocathode was prepared through Pt nanoparticle (Pt NP) formation on an ITO PET substrate via sodium borohydride reduction reaction following the procedure reported in the literature.34 The iodide/triiodide redox mediator was made by overnight mixing of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile in an inert atmosphere using a magnetic stirrer, and then injected in between the flexible photoanode and counter electrode to obtain the functioning FDSSCs.
2.4. Preparation of photoanodes and counter electrodes of the flexible DSSC tapes/rolls
The TiO2 nanoparticle paste was deposited onto an ITO PET substrate (3 cm × 1 cm) using a screen printing technique. The sintering of TNP and TNP + TNW layer-coated ITO PET tapes at 250 °C through the heat sink-supported convective heat transfer process was carried out by following the above-mentioned procedures.
For the preparation of the FDSSC tape counter electrode, a graphene nanoplatelet (GNPs)–titanium nitride (TiN) composite was deposited onto the ITO PET tape. The GNPs had ∼8 nm size solid with a density of 0.1 g cc−1 (bulk density), oxygen amount of ∼1%, carbon amount of 99.5% and remnant acid amount of 0.5 wt%. These GNPs consisted of many platelet-shaped assemblies of graphene layers, which must be fully dispersed to show their best possible properties. Hence, sonication using dimethyl formamide (DMF), methanol or ethanol solvent was found to be appropriate for obtaining better dispersion of GNPs. The GNPs were dispersed in an ethanol solvent by ultrasonication for 30 min using a LMUC-4 probe sonicator generating a power of 100 W and a frequency of 40 kHz. GNPs and TiN were kept in 1:1 wt% ratio in an agate mortar, and to this 5 mL of ethanol solvent was added dropwise and blended well to obtain a mixture; subsequently the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min to get the GNP–TiN slurry. This GNP–TiN slurry was coated onto ITO PET as a monolayer film by a doctor blading method. Thereafter, the GNP–TiN monolayer film was sintered at 250 °C by using the sintering method employed for the above-mentioned photoanode preparation.
2.5. Crystal structure and morphology characterization
The phase and crystal structure identification of the as-prepared TiO2 nanostructures was carried out using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα source generating a wavelength (λ) of 1.54 Å and a scan step size of 0.02° s−1. The surface topography of TiO2 nanostructures and TiO2 bilayer-coated flexible polymer photoanodes were studied using a SIGMA HV-Carl Zeiss scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The UV-visible absorbance and reflectance spectra of flexible mono- and bi-layer TiO2 thin films on ITO PET were recorded using a 2600 Shimadzu UV-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrophotometer.
2.6. Photovoltaic characterization and electrochemical impedance analysis
The photovoltaic current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of FDSSCs were carried out using a 2400 Keithley source meter under the air mass 1.5 global irradiation (100 mW cm−2) delivered by a Newport solar simulator. A 0.16 cm2 square mask similar to the active area of FDSSCs was used during the J–V measurements. The incident photon-to-charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) spectra of flexible solar cells were recorded using a Newport-Oriel instruments (TLS-300XU) system fitted out with a cornerstone monochromator, a 300 watts xenon arc source for illumination and a calibrated silicon photodiode. Moreover, for the better reproducibility of FDSSCs' J–V and IPCE data, more than five cells were constructed and tested simultaneously for each type of flexible bilayer TiO2 photoanodes to lessen the experimental errors. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of FDSSCs was carried out using a Model 604E CH Instruments electrochemical analyzer. The EIS data were acquired using a Z-view software and the impedance spectra were measured in the 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz frequency range, at a potential input of −0.75 V with an amplitude of 10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fabrication of FDSSCs of PET-based bilayer photoanodes prepared using a heat sink-supported high-temperature sintering process
The concept of high-temperature sintering of materials on the PET polymer substrate can fit all types of inorganic electronic materials that require moderate thermal sintering or compaction of solid particles on the polymer surface for the improved performance of their devices. In this process, we demonstrate all the advantages of using heat sink for the sintering of inorganic semiconducting oxide(s) coated onto the polymer having service temperature limitation; for instance, the PET polymer service temperature limit is 120 °C. In this approach, pre-sintered semiconducting oxide (TiO2) nanomaterials are made as pastes, conserving the merits of the conventional high-temperature (>400 °C) sintering method used for the preparation of TiO2 photoelectrodes in the DSSC fabrication, similar to the lift-off method reported by Durr and coworkers.19 This approach enormously facilitates the deposition of multilayers of TiO2 films onto the ITO PET substrate alongside improving the layer compaction with superior interconnection between the sublayers.
The complete bilayer photoanode-based FDSSC fabrication procedure by employing the chiller + heat sink + hot plate system is outlined in Fig. 1. The specifications of pencil heater-based compression press hot plate and plate fin heat sink used in this process have been reported in our previous work (S1, ESI†).26 The bilayer FDSSC photoanodes were prepared in two stages. In the first stage, the TiO2 nanoparticle (TNP) layer was coated onto the ITO PET substrate and sintered through the hot plate up to 250 °C. This mild sintering resulted in good adhesion between the transparent conducting oxide, for instance, indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) and TiO2 layers along with superior compaction of the TiO2 layer. The highest safe sintering temperature set for TiO2 was 250 °C, since beyond this point, the PET polymer surface deformed due to thermal instability though it was protected by the heat sink from the bottom side during the process. In the second stage, different light scattering layer(s) (nanoparticles or nanowires) were deposited onto the first layer, as shown in Fig. 1, and the second layer was subjected to mild sintering at 250 °C again to increase the compaction and interconnections between the layers. Besides, no visible TiO2 layer cracks or flaking off in the TiO2 layers deposited onto the ITO PET observed after the two-stage sintering process indicated superior mechanical stability and strong adhesion between the TiO2 layer(s) and ITO PET substrate,26 as confirmed by the bending test and morphological analysis (S2 and S3, ESI†). Besides, a temperature gradient reduced the sintering temperature of TiO2 at the TiO2/ITO interface than the surface temperature of the TiO2 top layer but did not affect the uniform sintering of the TiO2 film. As the layer thickness in the TiO2 film was ∼5–9 μm, the thermal resistance offered by the entire film was very small and hence superior heat transfer occurred from the top layer that favored the uniform sintering of the TiO2 film. Moreover, based on our simulation studies for single TiO2 layer sintering on ITO PET,35 the temperature difference observed between the two layers (TiO2 and ITO layers) was less, and there was a temperature drop from ∼250 °C to ∼−30 °C across the entire set up, including the variation of temperature seen over the ITO PET and TiO2 layer from ∼250 °C to ∼70 °C. To know the effect of temperature gradient, we earlier assessed transmittance and sheet resistance of the TiO2 film sintered by this proposed sintering method26 and observed that only marginal change in sheet resistance and no change in the percentage transmittance occurred in the sintered film. These results evidenced that the proposed heat sink-supported thermal sintering process lessened the effect on sheet resistance and maintained the polymer intact via indirect heating, wherein the ITO PET lower side temperature was maintained under 150 °C and the upper side was protected by the thermally stable oxide layers (both ITO and TiO2 have a melting temperature > 1200 °C).

3.2. Morphological analysis
The crystal structure and phase purity of TNP, TNP + TNP, and TNP + TNW film-coated ITO PET substrates sintered by the above-mentioned process were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The comparison of XRD patterns of the TiO2 thin film-coated ITO PET substrates as mono- and bilayers is shown in Fig. 2. The TiO2 nanoparticle (TNP) monolayer-deposited ITO PET revealed no phase transformation of anatase-phase TiO2 nanoparticles after the high-temperature (400 °C) pre-sintering, used for the preparation of a binder-free paste and then mild sintering performed at 250 °C for producing the TNP layer-coated ITO PET. The prominent XRD peaks observed at angles (2θ): 25.62, 37.79, 47.89, 53.43, 63.98 and 81.97, corresponding to the (101) planes for the TNP, TNP + TNP, and TNP + TNW layers on ITO PET confirmed the presence of anatase TiO2 crystallites (JCPDS no. 21-1272) with excellent phase purity.32 It was found that this sintering process had significant influence on the quality of crystalline TiO2 layers formed onto the ITO PET substrate and thermal stability of the PET polymer substrate. Besides, the TPN + TNW bilayer-coated ITO PET made of pre-sintered TiO2 nanowires demonstrated an intense diffraction peak as compared to that of TNP + TNP and TNP-coated ITO PET substrates due to the relatively high level of crystallinity of TNW. For improving the light scattering ability of the TiO2 films on ITO PET substrates, two different light scattering TiO2 nanostructures such as nanowires and nanoparticles were coated as second layers with the near-matching thickness as confirmed by the optical profiler. Moreover, for the comparison purpose, the TNP monolayer and TNP + TNW bilayer-coated ITO glass substrates were sintered at 250 °C by following the heat-sink supported sintering process and the resulting TiO2 films were subjected to XRD analysis. The XRD patterns of TiO2 film-coated ITO glass substrates revealed no changes in the peak positions or crystal structures when compared to the TiO2 film-coated ITO PET substrates (S4, ESI†). The thicknesses of monolayer and bilayer(s) deposited on the ITO PET substrates measured using an optical profiler were ∼9.1 μm and 13.5 μm, respectively (Fig. 2(b)). In the TNP + TNW bilayer, the TNW scattering layer developed more undulation; hence, the thickness was found in the range from 13.5 μm to 14.2 μm. The surface morphologies of mono and bilayer TiO2-coated ITO PET were analyzed with FESEM. The FESEM images TNP layer (top view) and TNP + TNW bilayer (tilt view, tilt angle 18°) are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. Similarly, the morphology of the TNP monolayer (top view)-coated ITO glass substrate is shown in Fig. 2(e). Fig. 2(c) and (e) showed that there was no significant morphological change occurring in the TNP layer formed over both the ITO PET and ITO glass substrates, when sintered by the heat sink supported thermal sintering process using the same experimental parameters. The TNP + TNW bilayer-coated ITO PET and ITO glass also showed similar morphological features after 250 °C sintering, as can be witnessed in Fig. 2(d) and (f). From the SEM analysis, it was found that the TiO2 nanoparticles formed interparticle networks and good porosity after the mild sintering of the TNP layer. Similarly, the TNP + TNW bilayer demonstrated good interconnection between sublayers and porosity. This might promote the superior charge transport within the sublayers. The FESEM images recorded for the TNP monolayer-coated ITO PET and ITO glass substrates demonstrated comparable morphologies of interconnected TiO2 nanoparticles with good porosity, which confirmed that the heat sink-supported thermal sintering process favored the formation of TiO2 nanoparticle interparticle necking and good porosity within the TNP layer similar to the conventional high temperature (>450 °C) sintering process, a condition suitable for the high dye uptake and charge transport of the photoanode. Furthermore, the comparison of FESEM images of TNP + TNW bilayer-coated ITO PET and ITO glass substrates (Fig. 2(d) and (f)) suggested that the presence of similar nanowires morphologies as a top layer of the bilayer photoanodes could support easy transport of the photogenerated electrons for obtaining high photocurrents from their DSSCs.

3.3. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
The light scattering effects observed within TNP-only flexible photoanodes are normally poor, and hence, the TNP is mixed with micron-sized particles to produce composite photoanodes with superior light scattering15,26 as known. Another effective method investigated to improve the light scattering within the TiO2 photoanode is to deposit multilayered TiO2 films (nanolayer and mesoscale layer) onto the TCO substrates. However, depositing multilayered TiO2 films over ITO PET for the improved light scattering ability successively towards attaining the superior light harvesting efficiency remained challenging due to the service limit of the PET polymer. However, the optical transparency of the PET polymer improved when it is heat-treated above the glass transition temperature and below its melting temperature.26 This change in the PET polymer can allow more light passing through the polymer for the superior light scattering at the light scattering centers. The impediments in depositing and sintering light scattering layers over compact layers on ITO PET have been successfully outshone by the heat sink-supported sintering process. As a result, the depositions of TNP monolayer and TNP + TNP bilayer thin films over the ITO PET have demonstrated increased diffuse reflectance value above 80% by the rise in the number of layers deposited over ITO PET and in the film thickness. Besides, the thin film of TNP + TNW bilayer has showed the highest diffuse reflectance value of 82% in the ITO PET photoanode (Fig. 3). The layers are connected well and formed optimal light scattering centers within the porous network of TiO2 nanowires as confirmed by the highest diffuse reflectance value obtained similar to the diffuse reflectance of TNP + TNW bilayer sintered at 500 °C on the glass substrate through the conventional sintering method in our previous work.

3.4. Photovoltaic performance analysis
The photovoltaic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of FDSSCs of mono- and bi-layer photoanodes with two different TiO2 nanostructures (nanowires and nanoparticles) recorded under air mass 1.5 global solar irradiation from a sun simulator are shown in Fig. 4. The experimental errors of J–V data are computed from the replicate measurements of five samples of each type of FDSSCs and presented as the standard deviations along with error bars in Fig. 4 and Table 1. These results have indicated that TNP + TNW bilayer photoanodes in FDSSCs produced the highest photocurrent density (Jsc) of 15.91 ± 0.17 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.33 ± 0.20% among all fabricated flexible solar cells. In contrast, the TNP + TNP bilayer FDSSC photoanode having a similar film thickness produced the Jsc, Voc and PCE values of 13.21 ± 0.14 mA cm−2, 0.70 V and 5.39 ± 0.22% respectively. This suggests that the light-scattering layer with superior charge transport and dye loading properties (S5, ESI†) within the bilayer(s) affected immensely the photocurrent generation in FDSSCs. To estimate the amount of dye adsorbed onto the ITO PET coated with a TNP single layer, TNP + TNP, and TNP + TNW bilayers, each photoanode was immersed separately in a 1 M aq. NaOH solution for 30 min and the dye desorbed from the photoanode was dissolved in a NaOH solution. Then, the absorption spectra of dye solutions were recorded, and dye characteristic absorption maxima obtained were used to calculate the dye amounts loaded in the different photoanodes,38 as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S5 (ESI†). From Table 1, it was understood that the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode had a high dye-loading ability (4.72 μmol cm−2). The amount of dye loaded in the TNP monolayer photoanode was found to be lower than the TNP + TNP bilayer photoanode, which were estimated as 3.16 and 3.88 mol cm−2, respectively, which could be due to the TNP monolayer photoanode film thickness being less than the film thickness of the TNP + TNP bilayer photoanode. The amount of the dye loaded in the TNP + TNW bilayer was much higher than that of the TNP + TNP bilayer. The higher film roughness, formation of more open structures and porosity of the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode caused its superior dye loading ability to that of the TNP + TNP bilayer photoanode. Usually, Jsc produced in the FDSSCs with respect to the incident photo flux density at a wavelength ‘λ’ can be deduced from the IPCE values. The TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode-based FDSSCs have demonstrated a superior IPCE value (63.22%) over the IPCE values of FDSSCs of the TNP + TNP bilayer (54.76%) and TNP monolayer (44.74%) photoanodes. The superior IPCE value obtained for the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode in FDSSCs is ascribed to the enhanced light scattering ability and charge collection of the TiO2 sublayers. Besides, IPCE = ηCC·ηLHE·ηIN, where ηCC is the charge collection efficiency, ηLHE is the light harvesting efficiency, and ηLHE is the charge injection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, Jsc increased in FDSSCs due to the increase in ηLHE of different sublayers in photoanodes, which are normally determined by the dye loading capacity of TiO2 sublayers, light scattering properties of photoanodes, redox species concentration and other factors. The exuberant competition between charge recombination at the photoanode–redox mediator interface and charge collection of the TiO2 sublayers dictate the charge collection efficiency (ηCC). The light harvesting efficiency (ηLHE) of the flexible bilayer photoanodes can also be assessed from the IPCE data and dye desorption values. The TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode has exhibited a slightly better dye loading than that of the TNP + TNP bilayer photoanode of similar thickness, as can be seen in Table 1. This is one of the factors for improved light harvesting and charge collection efficiencies that substantially increased Jsc of the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode-based FDSSCs. Integrated Jsc values calculated for FDSSC photoanodes based on their IPCE results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).38 The integrated Jsc obtained from the IPCE result of each FDSSC photoanode has been found comparable to its Jsc obtained from the J–V curve. The J–V curves show that the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode in FDSSCs has produced the highest photocurrent density (Jsc) of 15.91 ± 0.17 mA cm−2 similar to its integrated Jsc calculated from the IPCE data as 15.97 mA cm−2. The Jsc values of other FDSSC photoanodes have also exhibited closer to the integrated Jsc values calculated from their respective IPCE data. These results have confirmed that the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode produced the highest photocurrent in FDSSCs fabricated via the heat sink-supported thermal sintering process because of its favorable morphological features for the superior charge collection and transport.

3.5. Electrochemical impedance (EIS) studies of photoanode–redox electrolyte interfaces
The charge transfer process at the photoanode–electrolyte interface and charge collection efficiency are assessed from the electrochemical impedance parameters of the TNP monolayer, TNP + TNP and TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode-based FDSSCs recorded in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz, as shown in Fig. 5(a) Nyquist plots and Fig. 5(b) Bode plots. In the Nyquist plots, series resistance ‘Rs’ is connected to the initial value of the first semicircle intercepting at the real-axis, ‘Rct1’ to the first semicircle appearing in the high-frequency region for charge transfer resistance at the platinum counter electrode/electrolyte interface, and ‘Rct2’ to the second semicircle appearing in the middle frequency region for charge transfer resistance at the TiO2 photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface. All the resistance parameters estimated from an equivalent circuit simulated to fit the Nyquist plots are listed in Table 2 (S7, ESI†). From Table 2 and Fig. 5, the series resistance Rs values estimated for FDSSCs fabricated were found almost similar, but large variations are observed in the Rct1, and Rct2 values dependent on the number of layers and the type of light scattering nanostructures used in the flexible photoanodes. The TNP + TNW bilayer flexible photoanode has showed the highest Rct2, due to the suppressed charge recombination in the TNP + TNW sublayers, by the rapid charge transport within the nanowire light scattering layer. Besides, the frequency shift to the lower value seen for the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode as compared to that of the TNP + TNP bilayer and TNP monolayer photoanodes in the Bode phase plot (Fig. 5(b)) further substantiated the longer electron lifetime because of the one-dimensional TiO2 nanowires, providing extended mean free path to the photogenerated electrons.

Furthermore, the EIS parameters summarized in Table 2 are used for the calculation of electron transport time (τs), electron lifetime (τn) and charge collection efficiency (ηCC) of the flexible photoanodes in FDSSCs using the following equations: eqn (1)–(3) τs = Rs × Cμ(1) τn = Rct × Cμ(2) ηCC = (1 + Rs/Rct)−1(3)
The results have indicated that the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode has faster electron transport time than the TNP + TNP bilayer and TNP monolayer photoanodes. The electron lifetime (τn) calculated from EIS parameters has indicated a slower recombination process in the TNP + TNW photoanode than that of the other photoanodes due to the presence of TiO2 nanowires in its sublayers enhancing charge transport and diffusion length of the electrons. In addition, the charge collection efficiency can provide wealth of information on the photovoltaic performance of the FDSSCs. Particularly the ηCC calculated from EIS parameters has clearly revealed the superiority of the TNP + TNW photoanode over the other photoanodes in FDSSCs. Thus, we can deduce that because of the slower recombination process and enhanced charge collection efficiency of FDSSC fabricated with TNP + TNW photoanodes, improved Jsc value was exhibited as compared to the other monolayer- and bilayer TiO2 photoanode-based FDSSCs.
3.6. Mechanical stability studies
Mechanical deformability is considered one of the main characteristics of FDSSCs. Hence, the superior performing TNP + TNW bilayer-coated photoanodes are bent up to 1 cm bending radius for 10, 30, and 50 cycles, and then used in the construction of FDSSCs. The photovoltaic J–V curves of FDSSCs and their PCE determined are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 3, respectively. The efficiency of the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode-based FDSSCs is decreased marginally with the increase in the bending cycles, as shown in Fig. 6. However, the device PCE dropped only 90% after 50 bending cycles without any noticeable changes in the Voc and fill factor values (Table 3). The slight drop in PCE with the increase in bending cycles is connected to decreasing Jsc, which could have come from increasing resistances of the TiO2 film. Besides, the poor stability of the ITO due to its brittle and fragile nature leads to nanoscale crack formation during bending or twisting deformation, and increasing the electrical resistance is known.36 Moreover, TiO2 films coated onto the ITO PET can show similar effects despite the stringent deposition conditions followed during the fabrication process. This effect can be mitigated by introducing a conducting layer/film resilient to the nanoscale deformation without rupturing such as graphene(s). Despite all these detrimental effects, the TNP + TNW bilayer-coated ITO PET photoanode has exhibited a PCE of 5.76% after 50 cycles of bending deformation, which proved its good mechanical deformation stability and the superior adhesion between ITO PET and TiO2 sublayers.

3.7. DSSC tapes/rolls
As part of the scaling up of bilayer photoanode-based FDSSCs fabricated by using the chiller + heat sink + hot plate system, large-scale mono- and bilayer TiO2 photoanode strips of dimension 3 cm × 1 cm were also prepared by following the method given in the schematic illustration in Fig. 1. The images of the as-prepared flexible photoanode and FDSSC strips or tapes are presented in Fig. 7. Though laboratory-scale FDSSC photoanodes have been prepared using the doctor bladed TiO2 layers on the ITO PET producing the high PCE, it is presumed that this printing technique unsuitable for the manufacturing of FDSSC tapes/rolls since getting uniform, continuous layers printed on ITO PET in large scale by doctor blade method is difficult. Thus, the screen-printing technique has been employed for the deposition of TiO2 layers onto the ITO PET substrates. Besides, increasing the width and length of the TiO2 strip can increase the ohmic loss and series resistance of the photoanode, which adversely impact the photovoltaic performance of the FDSSCs by reducing the photocurrent and fill factor. Thus, a screen with optimal TiO2 strip width and length of 5 mm × 2 mm has been used to prepare the FDSSC photoanode strips. For the FDSSC counter electrode strip preparation, a GNP–TiN nanocomposite paste is preferred over the Pt nanoparticle deposition on the ITO PET because of its cost-effectiveness, easy availability, and processing. Subsequently, both photoanode and counter electrode strips were sandwiched together using a Surlyn™ sealant and filled with an iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte to obtain the functioning FDSSC tapes. The photovoltaic J–V and IPCE curves recorded for the mono and bilayer TiO2 photoanode strip-based FDSSC tapes are presented in Fig. 7, and the photovoltaic parameters calculated are listed in Table 4. From Fig. 7 and Table 4, the Jsc values measured increased from 10.24 mA cm−2 for the TNP monolayer photoanode-based FDSSC tape to 11.88 mA cm−2 for the TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode-based FDSSC tape, which indicated that the TNW upper layer deposited over the TNP underlayer improved the photocurrent and fill factor significantly. This could be due to the superior charge transport properties of the TNW layer, suppressing the resistive and recombination losses of the photoanode significantly. Moreover, the IPCE comparison of FDSSC tapes have demonstrated an increased value at first and the excitonic maximum of the N719 dye (534 nm) for TNP + TNW bilayer photoanode-based FDSSC tape due to the superior light scattering, charge transport and collection of the TNW sublayer within the bilayer.37 These results suggest that the photocurrent density of large area FDSSCs can be increased substantially by the incorporation of the TNW layer within the photoactive layer(s) of the flexible photoanodes, a condition mainly desirable for photovoltaic performance improvements in the FDSSC modules and rolls.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we introduced a new type of material processing method for the preparation of mono- or bilayer TiO2-coated ITO PET conductive substrates employed as the photoanode of flexible dye sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) producing the highest PCE of 6.33% and FDSSC tape producing a PCE of 3.87%. In this method, TiO2 nanoscale and mesoscale layers were deposited sequentially onto ITO PET and sintered in the presence of a chiller + heat sink + hot plate system. The convective heat transfer at the heat sink protected the PET polymer, while the compaction of TiO2 layers kept in between the heat sink and hot plate occurred by the mild sintering at 250 °C. As a result, the bilayer FDSSC photoanode prepared through this process exhibited the maximum photocurrent density of 15.91 ± 0.17 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.71 V, surpassing other literature reported values for the PET polymer-based FDSSCs. Besides, as part of the device engineering, different TiO2 nanostructures were employed as mesoscale light scattering layers in the bilayer photoanodes. The EIS and IPCE studies indicated that the TiO2 nanowire light scattering layer in bilayer photoanodes of laboratory-scale FDSSCs and large-area FDSSC tapes possessed the superior charge transport and light scattering ability, which improved their photovoltaic performances enormously. Thus, this processing technique would enable the manufacturing of highly efficient large-area PET-based FDSSC modules and rolls in low-cost and less-complex routes.
