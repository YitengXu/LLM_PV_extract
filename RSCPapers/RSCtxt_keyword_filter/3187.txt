    , Accepted 30th November 2014First published on 2nd December 2014AbstractA novel angular shaped monomeric donor of 4,5-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]diselenophene (BDSe) was synthesized and exploited as the “donor” moiety to copolymerize with 4,7-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT) for constructing the “donor–acceptor” (D–A) polymer PBDSe-DTBT. The selenium-substituted polymer displayed both a low optical band gap of 1.71 eV and a deep HOMO level of −5.4 eV as well as excellent solubility and thermal stability. With 1% DIO as the film processing additive, bulk heterojunction solar cell based on the PBDSe-DTBT:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blend provided a promising average power efficiency (PCE) of 5.6%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 12.30 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.57. Compared to devices processed without additives, 1% DIO additive processed BHJ devices showed enhanced absorption coefficient, better molecular packing, suppressed bimolecular recombination as well as a more balanced hole and electron transport, leading to significant improvement of Jsc and FF.
Introduction
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on polymer–fullerene blends are approaching the benchmark value of 10% for single-junction cells,1–4 largely ascribable to the rapid advancement of novel donor polymers.5–9 Among different strategies to molecularly engineer conjugated polymers for BHJ solar cells, the alternating “donor–acceptor” (D–A) concept has prevailed because it offers a high level of flexibility in tuning the absorption spectra and frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the resulting D–A copolymers. For example, it becomes increasingly evident that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of a D–A alternating copolymer can be approximated by the HOMO level of the “donor” (D) structural unit and the LUMO level of the “acceptor” (A) unit, respectively.8 This important feature has enabled the design of polymers with a low HOMO level in conjunction with a low band gap, in order to simultaneously achieve a high open circuit voltage (Voc) and a high short circuit current (Jsc).10 While the structures of the aromatic units in these D–A copolymers have largely decided the photovoltaic performance of the BHJ solar cells,11 other structural parameters can also have a strong influence, for example, the peripheral side chains,12–14 and functional substituents (e.g., fluorine).15–17 Thus, to further advance the PCE values, one popular approach is to molecularly engineer and fine-tune the structure of top performing D–A copolymers;9,18,19 however, such a strategy can only lead to incremental increases in the PCE, if successfully demonstrated. On the other hand, a more challenging yet more rewarding strategy is the creative design and synthesis of novel structural units and related polymers. Such a strategy has been playing a crucial role in maintaining the upward trend of the device efficiency towards the predicted PCE of 15% for polymer BHJ solar cells.20–24
The structural units, either “donor” (D) or “acceptor” (A) in these D–A alternating copolymers, are often based on fused aromatics, typically via the annulation of different small aromatic units (e.g., benzene, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, etc.). One such example is benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), a benzannulated compound with two fused thiophenes. BDT and its derivatives have been found in many conjugated polymers with a high photovoltaic performance in the corresponding BHJ solar cells, with efficiency values already approaching 10%.1,9,15,16,25 Interestingly, one of the BDT's structural isomers, benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDP) with an angular-shape (rather than the linear-shaped BDT), received much less attention since we first introduced it into the conjugated polymers for BHJ solar cells.26 In fact, there are a number of benefits associated with these angular-shaped units to construct conjugated polymers for optoelectronic applications. Copolymers incorporating these angular-shaped units (e.g., naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) can form highly ordered films due to improved π–π interactions, thereby leading to higher charge carrier mobilities than those obtained with the copolymer based on linear-shaped ones in one recent report.27 In another example, conjugated polymers containing BDPs exhibited a one order of magnitude increase in hole mobility (up to 0.134 cm2 v−1 s−1) in organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices when compared with these linear-shaped BDT-based polymers.28 Furthermore, others have identified that these fused aromatic moieties of angular shapes (e.g., BDP) can further modulate the frontier molecular orbital energy levels, leading to lower-lying HOMO levels and higher-lying LUMO energy levels than their linear-shaped counterparts (e.g., BDT).29,30 This HOMO-lowering effect suggests that the angular-shaped “donor” would be very useful in building D–A alternating copolymers to attain higher Voc in the corresponding BHJ solar cells, and possibly higher Jsc and fill factor (FF) due to better charge transport (i.e., high mobility). Unfortunately, the BHJ solar cells of BDP based D–A copolymers were found to be much less efficient,31–33 with the highest efficiency ever reported being only 4.45%,31 achieved by BHJ devices based on PDPP–BDP, a D–A copolymer combining BDP as the “donor” structural unit, with the “acceptor” unit of 3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP). It appears that one major issue is the larger optical band gaps usually observed with BDP based conjugated polymers, which would lead to a smaller Jsc in BHJ solar cell devices. This large band gap can be ascribed to the shorter conjugation length of these angular-shaped fused polycyclic aromatics than that of their linear counterparts.
One plausible solution to mitigate the large band gaps of these BDP based conjugated polymers while (hopefully) maintaining the aforementioned benefits of having BDP is to substitute the sulfur in these thiophene units with selenium. Indeed, as a thiophene analog, selenophene can help lower the LUMO energy level of its conjugated polymer with an almost unchanged HOMO level when compared with the energy levels from the thiophene based counterparts.34,35 Furthermore, the more polarizable selenium (Se) allows stronger Se–Se intermolecular interactions, which can lead to a better π electron overlap between adjacent conjugated backbones and improve the charge transport properties.36–38 These interesting features associated with selenophene prompted us to explore the incorporation of selenophene units into the angular-shaped BDP.
Herein, we report the synthesis of a new angular-shaped monomeric “donor” of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]diselenophene (BDSe), the selenophene analog of BDT, and a BDSe based D–A copolymer, PBDSe-DTBT (Chart 1), by copolymerizing BDSe with the most popular “acceptor” unit, 4,7-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT). The optical, electrochemical properties of PBDSe-DTBT, and the photovoltaic properties of the PBDSe-DTBT:fullerene based solar cells were carefully investigated. A promising PCE of 5.6% was obtained, indicating the potential of applying BDSe to future designs of conjugated polymers for BHJ solar cells.

Experimental section
Materials and characterization
1,2-Dibromo-4,5-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzene39 and 4,7-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole17 were synthesized according to the methods reported. [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, >99%, EL device grade) was purchased from Solenne. The anhydrous solvent of toluene and THF were prepared by standard distillation procedures with sodium prior to use. All other chemicals were purchased from J&K, Acros Chemicals etc.
All 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Mercury plus-400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3. The mass spectroscopy of compounds was performed on a VG-ZA-HS EI or Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a NETZSCH syncthermogravimetric analyzer (STA449F3) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. The temperature of degradation (Td) was correlated to a 5% weight loss. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a PL-GPC 50 system, using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent and polystyrenes as standards for calibration.
UV-vis absorption spectra of the solutions in o-DCB and films spin-coated on the precleaned glass of the samples were taken on a Shimadzu UV-1750 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were obtained in a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) with anhydrous acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte on a CHI 660D electrochemical analyzer using a standard three-electrode configuration, with a glass carbon disk as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M AgNO3 in the supporting electrolyte) electrode as the reference electrode. The measurements of the polymer film drop-casted on the working electrode from a 2 mg mL−1 solution in CHCl3 were done at a constant scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature under highly purified N2.
Fabrication and characterization of polymer BHJs
Polymer BHJs were fabricated with a general device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios PH750)/PBDSe-DTBT:PC71BM/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm). Glass substrates with patterned ITO were sonicated for 10 minutes in DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 10 minutes. A layer (40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS film was spin-coated onto the substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s and baked at 150 °C for 30 minutes. The substrates were then transferred into a glovebox under N2. Subsequently, the active layers from the solution of the polymer (fixed concentration of 10 mg mL−1) and PC71BM at different weight ratios in the o-DCB solvent were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS film for 60 s and dried naturally in the glovebox. Finally, Ca (20 nm) and Al (80 nm) were sequentially deposited on top of the active layers as cathodes at a pressure around 4 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask that defines 8 devices with an area of 9 mm2. The thicknesses of the active layers were recorded by a DEKTAK XT profilometer.
Current–voltage measurements were carried out in a nitrogen-filled glove box illuminated under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a 450 W solar simulator (Newport 94023A-U) calibrated by an NREL certified standard silicon cell. Current versus potential (J–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2420 digital source meter. For external quantum efficiency (EQE) tests, the devices were transferred by a self-made testing box from the glovebox into the sample chamber of a 7-SCSpec spectral performance of solar cell test system consisting of a 500 watt SCS028-7ILX500 xenon light source, a 7ISW301 vertical grating spectrometer, a 71FW6 filter wheel, an SR540 chopper and an SR810 lock-in amplifier. The calibration of the incident monochromatic light was carried out with a Hamamatsu S1337-1010 BQ Silicon photodetector.
Electron and hole mobilities of the blend films were tested in hole- and electron-only devices of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/Pd(50 nm) and glass/Al(80 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/Ca(20 nm)/Al(80 nm) respectively by recording the dark current–voltage and applying sufficient voltage to form the space charge limited (SCLC) current. The dark-current density is related to the square root of the corrected voltage, which is a characteristic of the field independent of the carrier mobility. The SCLC is determined by the equation: (1)where εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer (typical value of 3 for semiconducting polymers) or PC71BM, ε0 is the permittivity of free charge, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device (V = Vappl − Vrs − Vbi, Vappl is the applied voltage, Vrs is from contact and series resistance, Vbi is from built-in voltage), and L is the thickness of the blend films.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded by the out-of-plane XRD profile in reflection mode with a PANalytical X'pert Pro type X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å) at room temperature.
The morphology of the films was characterized through tapping mode on Multimode 8 SPM under ambient conditions. RTESPA (0.01–0.025 ohm cm antimony (n) doped silicon) tips with a spring constant of 20–80 N m−1 and a frequency of 305–356 kHz were used in imaging.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The chemical structures and synthetic strategy for the monomers and the target polymer PBDSe-DTBT are depicted in Scheme 1. The key step in the synthesis of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]diselenophene (BDSe) was the intramolecular cyclization between the phenylselenolate intermediate, generated in situ via a convenient SN–Ar type reaction with sodium selenide created from the reaction between NaBH4 and the Se powder in ethanol, with the adjacent acetylene moiety (i.e., 2 to 3).40 Specifically, the precursor monomers 1,2-dibromo-3,6-diiodo-4,5-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzene (1) and 1,2-dibromo-4,5-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-3,6-bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene (2) were prepared according to the slightly modified literature methods through facile iodination and Sonogashira reactions, respectively.41 Sodium selenide (Na2Se), obtained via the reduction of selenium powder by sodium borohydride in an ethanol solvent, acts as a nucleophile to the brominated aromatic 2 to generate the phenylselenolate intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with the neighboring acetylene moiety in a polar aprotic solvent of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form the selenophene ring fused with the benzene core, leading to the desired compound 3. We noted that a low concentration of 2 was necessary to minimize the undesirable intermolecular cyclization of 2. After a standard stannylation of 3 into the monomer 4, the polymer PBDSe-DTBT was synthesized via the Stille polymerization of 4 and 4,7-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT). Soxhlet purification of the crude polymer afforded a polymer with high solubility in common organic solvents (e.g., CHCl3, THF and chlorobenzene) at room temperature. Next, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of the purified polymer in tetrahydrofuran (THF) determined a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 16.03 kg mol−1 and weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 23.75 kg mol−1 with a dispersity (PDI) of 1.48. Finally, PBDSe-DTBT exhibited good thermal stability as indicated by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1†) with a decomposition temperature (Td) above 300 °C.

Optical absorption and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1 shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDSe-DTBT in solution and as a thin film spin-coated on a pre-cleaned glass substrate. In o-DCB solution at room temperature, PBDSe-DTBT shows two main absorption bands commonly observed in D–A conjugated polymers, with a high energy band peak at 393 nm, and a maximum absorption peak at 544 nm corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions. These absorption features remains relatively unchanged at an elevated temperature of 80 °C, indicating that there is no significant aggregation of PBDSe-DTBT in a dilute solution (10−3 mg mL−1). However, in the solid state as thin films, both the main absorption peaks red-shifted remarkably by 30 nm and 51 nm, locating at 423 nm and 595 nm, respectively, and became broader when compared to those in solution. In addition, a new identifiable shoulder peak near 650 nm emerged, which is believed to represent the degree of interchain stacking as reported for other polymers.42,43 The large red-shifts and the presence of the shoulder peak indicate enhanced intermolecular interactions and strong aggregation among the individual polymer chains in the thin films. This broad absorption and well-ordered packing of polymer chains would benefit the Jsc and the charge carrier (i.e., hole) mobility. Finally, a relatively small optical band gap of 1.71 eV was estimated for PBDSe-DTBT, calculated from the onset of film absorption.
 Fig. 1  Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDSe-DTBT in o-DCB solution at room temperature (r.t.) and 80 °C, and in a thin film on the glass substrate. 
To estimate the frontier orbital energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on the PBDSe-DTBT thin film drop-cast on a glass carbon disk, using a standard three-electrode configuration. As shown in Fig. 2a, quasi reversible oxidation and irreversible reduction processes were detected. The first oxidation potential and reduction potential onset are located at 0.57 V and −1.30 V, respectively, which were calibrated with the redox potentials of the Fc/Fc+ couple. According to the empirical formula of HOMO = −(Eox,onset + 4.8) eV and LUMO = −(Ered,onset + 4.8) eV, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDSe-DTBT were estimated to be −5.37 eV and −3.50 eV (see Table 1), respectively. Since the Voc of polymer solar cells is largely dependent on the interface gap between the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the acceptor material,44,45 the relatively deep HOMO energy level of PBDSe-DTBT could result in a high Voc. On the other hand, the energy offsets of ∼0.7 eV (Fig. 2b), between the HOMO levels of PBDSe-DTBT and PC71BM and between the corresponding LUMO levels, could enable efficient exciton separation and charge transfer at the donor–acceptor (e.g., polymer–fullerene) interface. In summary, the optical and electrochemical properties of PBDSe-DTBT support our design rationale of adopting the unique advantages of angular-shaped “donor” moiety and the Se heteroatom to obtain both a low optical band gap and a low-lying HOMO level in the D–A copolymers, with the ultimate goal to achieve both an increased Jsc and a high Voc in BHJ solar cells.

Bulk heterojunction solar cell performances
BHJ photovoltaic devices comprising PBDSe-DTBT as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor material were fabricated with a typical configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDSe-DTBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al. We first investigated the weight ratio of PBDSe-DTBTvs. PC71BM (1:0.8, 1:1 and 1:2) with a fixed concentration of 10 mg mL−1 for PBDSe-DTBT in an o-DCB solvent. For each studied weight ratio, we also varied the film thickness of the BHJ blend as part of the device optimization procedure. All the device data are summarized in Table S2,† through which we identified that the optimal weight ratio was 1:1 to achieve maximal efficiency. The current–voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic properties of BHJ devices with the maximal efficiency at each processing condition are displayed in Fig. 3a and Table 2, respectively.

As expected, a relatively high Voc of ∼0.8 V was observed in all PBDSe-DTBT:PC71BM based BHJ solar cells, consistent with the low-lying HOMO energy level of PBDSe-DTBT. Combined with a higher average Jsc of 8.9 mA cm−2, the BHJ device with PBDSe-DTBT:PC71BM at a 1:1 weight ratio gave the highest PCE of 2.7% among all the blending ratios studied (without additives), primarily due to a low FF of 0.37. However, with the addition of 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the processing additive in the polymer:fullerene solution,46 the PCE was dramatically improved up to 5.6%, with a significant increase in both Jsc (12.30 mA cm−2) and FF (0.57) (Fig. 3a). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE value among all reported BHJ solar cells based on conjugated polymers containing angular-shaped benzodithiophene derivatives.31–33,47
To shed more light on the observed increase in Jsc when the processing additive was added, we compared the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices processed with and without the additive, as shown in Fig. 3b. The device processed from 1% DIO additive exhibits a slightly broader EQE response (i.e., from 350 nm to over 700 nm) than that of the device from the additive-free processing. However, the EQE value of the device processed with the additive is noticeably higher across the entire photoresponse range, with the maximum EQE reaching 60%. The much improved EQE is directly related with the increased absorption of the blend film processed with the additive (see ESI Fig. S3†), and also likely benefits from a better charge carrier extraction due to the improved mobility and morphology by applying the processing additive (vide infra).
Morphology study
It is generally agreed that a desirable morphology of BHJ films would include polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains of 10–20 nm domain sizes, connected through the polymer/fullerene intermixed domains.48 Furthermore, both crystalline regions and amorphous regions are important. All these morphological characteristics contribute to achieving high Jsc and FF.4,49 For example, too large a domain of high purity would negatively impact the exciton dissociation, while too small a domain with excellent mixing of polymer and fullerene would impede the charge transport.50 To probe the morphological features of these BHJ blends processed under different conditions, we first applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the top surface morphology of the blend films (Fig. 4). The obtained height images show that the BHJ blend film processed with 1% DIO has a larger root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 9.6 nm (Fig. 4a), compared with an RMS of 0.4 nm (Fig. 4c) for the film processed without any additives. The relative coarse surface morphology in the DIO-processed film, indicated by its larger RMS value, could be attributed to the self-organized ordering or the crystalline domain of the polymer (PBDSe-DTBT) in the BHJ blend, as frequently reported for other DIO processed polymer:fullerene films.49,51 This relatively ordered structure can improve the charge carrier mobility, which would facilitate the carrier transport and attenuate the charge recombination, thereby enhancing the Jsc and FF. On the other hand, the phase images (Fig. 4b) offer some insights into the phase separation. Compared with the featureless phase image of the BHJ film without any additives, the DIO processed blend film shows a more favorable phase separation with rather uniform and moderate domain sizes of ∼20–30 nm. This close to “ideal” domain size would benefit the exciton dissociation and lead to a higher Jsc.
 Fig. 4  AFM topographical height (left) and phase (right) images (5 μm × 5 μm) of PBDSe-DTBT:PC71BM films processed without DIO (a and b) and with 1% DIO (c and d). 
To probe the structural order/molecular packing in these BHJ films, we applied grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) to investigate the thin films of both the pristine polymer and its BHJ blends (Fig. 5). The pristine PBDSe-DTBT thin film displays a distinguishable [100] diffraction peak at 5.30° with a corresponding d spacing of 16.67 Å, representing the inter-chain distance determined by these alkyl side chains. Another weak peak at 22.25° can be assigned to the π–π stacking between the polymer backbones. After PBDSe-DTBT was blended with PC71BM, the film processed without additives also displayed a [100] peak at 5.32°, indicating the relatively crystalline nature of polymers in this BHJ film. Interestingly, adding 1% DIO additive during the film processing induces a considerable decrease in this inter-chain spacing from 16.67 Å to 14.72 Å (given the diffraction peak shifting from 5.30° to 6.0°), suggesting that the polymer chains are better packed along the inter-chain direction in the DIO-processed BHJ film. This increased structure order is also supported by the UV-vis absorption of the DIO-processed BHJ film (see ESI Fig. S3†), with a new pronounced absorption shoulder peak at ∼659 nm.52 Therefore, the addition of DIO during the BHJ film processing indeed results in more favorable molecular packing when compared with the blend film processed without additives. This improved molecular packing is generally believed to benefit charge carrier mobilities and Jsc, consistent with our observations of higher Jsc and FF for the 1% DIO-processed BHJ solar cell than the device processed with solvent only.

Mobility and recombination losses
As a direct result of the improved molecular packing in the 1% DIO-processed BHJ solar cell compared to the device processed without additives, the hole mobility of the former device, determined by the space charge limited (SCLC) current method, is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of the latter, 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1vs. 2.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 S−1 (see ESI Fig. S5†). Electron mobilities, on the other hand, are quite comparable, with 5.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 for the 1% DIO-processed cell and 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 for the one processed without additives. This is not surprising, given that electron mobility is mainly determined by the n-type PC71BM in these BHJ films. Taking all these mobility data together, the DIO processed device shows a more balanced mobility ratio (μe/μh = 2.55) when compared with that of the device processed without additives (μe/μh = 79). The significantly unbalanced electron/hole mobility in the latter case would lead to an accumulation of holes in the device which have a dramatically lower mobility than the electrons. The excess of holes would weaken the build-in potential that drives the extraction of charge carriers, leading to a reduced FF and Jsc.53 Therefore, the higher and more balanced carrier mobilities in the DIO processed device may avoid space charge accumulation and reduce recombination losses (vide infra),52,54,55 which explains the higher FF of 0.57 and Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2 in the DIO processed device.
Finally, we investigated the recombination losses of charge carriers by probing the relationship between the device J–V characteristics and the incident light intensity. Specifically, we plotted Vocversus the logarithm of light intensity to find n, following Voc ∝ nkT/qln(P) (Fig. 6a),56,57 where k is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, q is the elementary charge, and P is the light intensity. A value close to unity for n would indicate that bimolecular (Langevin) recombination dominates the recombination loss.55,58 When an additional Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) or trap-assisted recombination is involved, a competition with the bimolecular recombination would lead to a much increased n.59 Fitting the curves in Fig. 6a yields a value of 1.15 for n in the DIO processed device and 1.51 for the device processed without any additives. This result implies a reduced trap-assisted recombination in the DIO processed device, which can be associated with the improved molecular packing in this BHJ film, as discussed earlier. On the other hand, the dependence of Jsc on light intensity can be plotted according to their relationship: Jsc ∝ (Plight)α (Fig. 6b),55,58 where the value of the power law scaling exponent α indicates the strength of the bimolecular recombination. The closer the α approaches unity, the less is the bimolecular recombination. Indeed, a larger α (0.95) was obtained for the DIO processed device than that of the device processed without additives (0.91), indicating lesser bimolecular recombination loss in the DIO processed device. The reduced bimolecular recombination would lead to more charge carriers surviving the transport process and finally being extracted,58,60 contributing to the higher Jsc achieved in the DIO processed device, and the improved FF in all probed light intensities (Fig. 6c).17Fig. 6d plots the PCEs versus the light intensity, which shows a consistently higher PCE for the DIO processed device than that for the device processed without additives under all light intensities.

Conclusions
Aiming to integrate the unique features of the angular-shaped “donor” moiety and the Se heteroatom to obtain both a low optical band gap and a low-lying HOMO level in D–A copolymers, we designed and synthesized a novel D–A copolymer PBDSe-DTBT composed of the angular-shaped “donor” moiety of benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]diselenophene (BDSe) and 4,7-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT). Indeed, PBDSe-DTBT showed a low optical band gap of 1.71 eV and a low HOMO energy level of −5.37 eV, the latter contributing to the obtained Voc of ∼0.8 V from BHJ solar cells based on PBDSe-DTBT:PC71BM blends. After further device optimizations with various polymer:PCBM ratios, and using 1% DIO as the processing additive, the PCE of PBDSe-DTBT:PC71BM based BHJ devices could reach an impressive value of 5.6%, mainly due to a much improved Jsc (12.30 mA cm−2) and a dramatically enhanced FF (0.57). The 1% DIO processed solar cells showed a more balanced hole and electron transport and reduced charge recombination losses, which can be ascribed to the closer intermolecular stacking of the polymers in BHJ films and better BHJ film morphology. Our results demonstrate that angular-shaped benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]diselenophene (BDSe) is a promising building block for the future design of highly efficient donor polymers for BHJ solar cells. Further molecular engineering of this interesting building block and related D–A polymers is therefore justified.
