Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted attention from academia and industry due to its rapid performance advancement. However, the long-term operational stability of PSCs remains an issue. One promising approach involving the use of two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D perovskite has shown potential for improving the stability of PSCs. In addition to solar cell applications, 2D perovskites offer a great playground for chemists to investigate fundamental structure–property relationships. The rich chemical tunability provides unique opportunities to control their structural distortion, quantum and dielectric confinement, exciton–phonon coupling, and Rashba splitting, which, in turn, modulate their optical, electronic, and spin properties. For this reason, 2D perovskites have also shown tremendous potential for photoemission, spintronic, and photodetector applications. Here, we review the recent achievements of 2D perovskites for various optoelectronic applications. First, we discuss the basic structure and optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites, including band structure, optical properties, and charge transport. We then highlight recent achievements using 2D perovskites in solar cells and beyond solar cells, including progress on various synthesis strategies and their impact on structural and optoelectronic properties. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future opportunities to further develop 2D perovskites for various applications.

1. Introduction
Photovoltaics (PV) have witnessed the rapid rise of solution-processable organic–inorganic halide perovskites, which will likely become competitive in providing efficient and cheap solar energy.1,2 Over the course of about a decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has achieved a certified 25.2%,3 which is comparable to that of other commercial PV technologies.4 As a result, PSCs have attracted explosive attention from academia and industry. Weber et al. first established the unique structure and properties of three-dimensional (3D) perovskites in 1978.5,6 Then, in the 1990s, more findings of their unique optoelectronic properties were further developed by Mitzi et al.7,8 However, the initial several reports on PSCs between 2009 and 20129–11 are what caused these materials to begin to attract worldwide attention.
In the first report of PSCs, Miyasaka et al. used methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3, or MAPbI3) as a light-absorbing material with a liquid electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), yielding a PCE of 3.8% in 2009.9 Later, Park et al. used the solid-state hole-transport material (HTM) of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) to replace the liquid electrolyte, and they obtained an efficiency of 9.7% in 2012.10 Around the same time, Snaith et al. demonstrated performance of >10% for the solid-state PSCs.11 These breakthroughs have led to extensive research interest in PSCs.12–25
During the past several years, the PSC field has focused more on increasing the long-term operational stability of PSCs.26 A large number of studies have focused on optimizing perovskite absorbers (e.g., composition,27,28 perovskite nanostructures,29,30 tolerance factor,31,32 defect passivation,33,34 additive control35,36), device structures (e.g., contact layer37–40 and interface modification41,42), and device encapsulation.43,44 One promising category involving the use of two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D perovskite has also shown great potential for improving the stability of PSCs.45,46
Unlike small cations in 3D perovskites (e.g., MA+, formamidinium (FA+), and Cs+), the bulky organic cations in 2D perovskites provide a steric barrier for surface water adsorption.47,48 The large hydrophobic cation in the 2D perovskite crystal lattice can effectively suppress moisture intrusion.49 However, the 2D perovskites are generally not a good choice as an absorber for solar cell application because of their wide optical bandgap and limited charge transport associated with the 2D structure. Since the first report in 2014 of 2D perovskites as absorbers in solar cells having 4.73% PCE,50 the reported PCE of 2D PSCs has reached ∼18%,51 which is still much lower than that of 3D PSCs (∼25%). Rather than directly using 2D perovskites as the solar cell absorbers, an alternative approach—using 2D perovskite structures to enhance the surface properties of 3D perovskite grains and films (normally referred to as 3D/2D mixed-dimensionality perovskites)—has shown promise for improving both the stability and performance of perovskites across a wide range of compositions.21,22,52–55
In addition to solar cell applications, 2D hybrid perovskites offer a much greater playground for chemists to investigate fundamental structure–property relationships. In contrast to their 3D counterparts, where the choice of the organic moiety is restricted by the Goldsmith tolerance factor, many paths of chemical engineering in 2D perovskites are possible because the tolerance factor is relaxed. For instance, a library of organic ligands has been demonstrated in 2D hybrid perovskites, and the inorganic layer thickness can also be tuned synthetically. This rich chemical tunability provides unique opportunities to control their structural distortion, quantum and dielectric confinement, exciton–phonon coupling, and Rashba splitting, which, in turn, modulate their optical, electronic, and spin properties. For this reason, 2D perovskites have shown tremendous potential for photoemission (exciton vs. broad emission), spintronic, and photodetector applications (Fig. 1).

In this review, we discuss recent advances of 2D perovskites for various optoelectronic applications. First, we discuss the structure and optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites, including band structure, optical properties, and charge transport. We then highlight recent achievements of using 2D perovskite in solar cells and then go beyond solar cells to examine applications including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), spintronic applications, and photodetectors. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future opportunities for further developing 2D perovskites for a wide range of applications.
2. Chemical and crystal structure
The standard 3D perovskites have a general structure of ABX3, and six halide anions (X site; e.g., I−, Br−, and Cl−) coordinated to a divalent metal cation (B site; e.g., Sn2+ and Pb2+) form a BX6 octahedral framework (Fig. 2a).57 Twelve monovalent cations (A site; e.g., MA+, FA+, and Cs+) occupy the centers of four BX6 octahedra. Each of the A, B, and X sites can contain one or multiple elements, allowing flexibility in adjusting the properties of the perovskite. Whether or not certain compositions can form a stable perovskite structure is often estimated based on a simple geometric consideration, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t),58  where rA, rB, and rX are the corresponding ionic radii. Essentially, when t is in the range of ∼0.8–1.0, a stable 3D perovskite structure can be formed.48 Moreover, the octahedral factor (μ = rB/rX; μ is normally between 0.4 and 0.9) can be used to empirically evaluate whether a B-site atom prefers an octahedral coordination of the X-site atom (as opposed to other coordination numbers).59,60

(b) Schematic of different oriented families of 2D perovskites: 〈100〉 plane, A′2An−1BnX3n+1; 〈110〉 plane, A′2AmBmX3m+2; and 〈111〉 plane, A′2Aq−1BqX3q+2. Cuts along 〈100〉, 〈110〉 and 〈111〉 directions (grey parts) result in the corresponding different types of 2D perovskites. Reproduced with permission from ref. 56. Copyright 2019, Wiley-VCH. 
The 2D perovskite is generally described with a formula (A′)m(A)n−1BnX3n+1, where A′ can be divalent (m = 1) or monovalent (m = 2) cations that form a bilayer or monolayer connecting the inorganic (A)n−1BnX3n+1 2D sheets, where n indicates the layer thickness of metal halide sheets that can be adjusted by tuning precursor composition (Fig. 2a).61,62 Generally, the organic A′-site cation can be arbitrarily long so that large, high-aspect-ratio cations (e.g., aliphatic- or aromatic-based cations) can be employed. Note that the geometry of a 2D octahedral arrangement typically contains a BX42− inorganic unit, and the negative charge from the additional anion needs to be balanced by a positive charge (e.g., A′2BX4 when n = 2 and A′ is a monovalent cation). It is worth noting that the limit n = ∞ corresponds to the 3D perovskite, whereas n = 1 represents the pure 2D, and 1 < n ≤ 5 is often known as quasi-2D. More importantly, a mixture of 3D perovskite and low-n phases (e.g., n ≤ 3) can form even in the case of high n values (e.g., n = 30–60),20 which we refer to as quasi-3D perovskites. With the increase of n, the differences of thermodynamic stability in the high-n structures become smaller, which makes it difficult to prepare phase-pure high-n structures.63 Thus, the n value of such perovskites is usually described based on the precursor composition.
We can conceptually obtain 2D halide perovskite layers by cutting along the 〈100〉, 〈110〉, and 〈111〉 crystallographic planes of the corresponding 3D perovskite structure, leading to three 2D perovskite families with different orientations (i.e., 〈100〉, 〈110〉, and 〈111〉; Fig. 2b). The general formula of 〈100〉-oriented 2D perovskites is A′2An−1BnX3n+1, and their inorganic sheets are obtained by taking n layers along the 100 direction of the 3D perovskites. This structure represents the most commonly studied 2D halide perovskites. Because the 〈110〉-oriented perovskite layer is often highly distorted, interesting behaviors such as of the formation of self-trapped excitons, and broad-band/white-light emission at room temperature.64 In addition, there are few reports on the use of 〈110〉-oriented perovskites as absorbers in solar cells, which is likely caused by the difficulty of modulating the thickness of the inorganic layers in these materials and few cations that can stabilize their structures.56,65 The 〈111〉-oriented 2D perovskites have a formula A′2Aq−1BqX3q+2 (q > 1) and can only be constructed from group 15 B3+ ions (e.g., Bi, Sb, As).66 The 〈111〉-oriented perovskites are attractive solar cell absorbers due to their p-type-like character and relatively small effective masses for both holes and electrons; however, their strong excitonic nature appears to limit the performance for solar cells thus far in their development.48 In this review, we focus on the commonly reported 〈100〉-oriented 2D perovskites. This class of materials can be further divided into Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phases (Fig. 3a),67,68 Dion–Jacobson (DJ) phases (Fig. 3b),69–71 and the phases with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) (Fig. 3c).72,73

For the most commonly studied RP-phase 2D perovskites, a relatively weak van der Waals gap forms between a bilayer of monovalent cations and two adjacent lead halide sheets. The RP compositions are generally described as A′2An−1BnX3n+1,69 where A′ is aryl ammonium or alkyl cation (typical examples include phenylethylammonium (PEA+) and butylammonium (BA+)); small A cation is typically Cs+, FA+, or MA+; B site is Sn2+ or Pb2+; and the X site is I−, Br−, or Cl−. For the RP phase, the inorganic layers are often offset by one octahedral unit and present certain in-plane displacement (Fig. 3a). Alternatively, diamine compounds with two amino groups can avoid any gaps by forming hydrogen bonds on both ends with the two adjacent inorganic sheets,74 leading to a more stable DJ-phase 2D perovskite with A′An−1BnX3n+1 stoichiometry. The typical examples are 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (3AMP+) and 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP+). Adjacent layers in the DJ phase have no offsets and are stacked on top of each other (Fig. 3b). For ACI-phase 2D perovskite with the formula A′AnBnX3n+1,72 the small A cation not only resides in the lead halide sheets but also fills in the interlayer with the large A′ cation, adopting the layer-stacking characteristics of both DJ and RP structures (Fig. 3c). Note that guanidinium (Gua+) is the only cation that is reported, so far, to form the ACI structure. Obviously, the interlayer distance varies with the choice of spacing cation A′, and the RP phases have larger interlayer distance due to the requirement of a bilayer of spacer organic cations.
Many bulky organic cations have been reported to incorporate into a 2D perovskite and later into a solar cell; the reported bulky cations for RP- and DJ-phase 2D perovskites are summarized in Fig. 4. In general, the properties determining whether a cation is suitable as a spacer include: (1) the net positive charge and degree of substitution of the perovskite anchoring site (primary ammonium > secondary amine > tertiary amine > quaternary amine, in descending order); (2) hydrogen-bonding ability; (3) space-filling ability (linear cross cations > branch irregular cations); and (4) stereochemical configuration (aromatic hydrocarbons < flexible aliphatic hydrocarbons).65

3. Basic optoelectronic properties
In this section, we discuss some basic optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites, including the electronic band structure, optical properties and charge transport dynamics.
3.1. Band structure and optical properties
In the layer-structured 2D perovskites, the large-sized organic cation interlayers can limit charge carriers within a two-dimensional range. These interlayers also act as dielectric regulators, determining the electrostatic force on the electron–hole pairs.144 The alternating arrangement of lead halide inorganic sheets and bulky organic interlayers results in a multiple-quantum-well (MQW) electronic structure (Fig. 5a).145 The high organic and inorganic dielectric contrast leads to a huge electron–hole binding energy (Eb) in 2D perovskites.146 Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy has verified that charge transport is preferred along the inorganic planes for prototypical 2D perovskites.147 The excitons can be stabilized by 2D perovskite MQWs, even at ambient temperatures. Various possibilities based on the MQW structure make 2D perovskite an interesting material system for room-temperature photoelectric and fundamental physical applications.
 Fig. 5  (a) Schematic of n = 1 2D perovskite structure with alternating organic and inorganic sheets along with the corresponding MQW energy diagram (Eexc and Eg are the optical bandgap and electronic bandgap of the inorganic framework, respectively; organic cations have a larger HOMO–LUMO gap). The constant dielectric contrast (ε1 and ε2 for inorganic and organic layers, respectively) is also presented. Reproduced with permission from ref. 56. Copyright 2019, Wiley-VCH.

The 2D confinement effect directly influences the bandgap (Eg) of 2D perovskite materials. For an RP hybrid perovskite, the Eg depends on the well width,148 and the total Eg energy is determined by the base 3D structure and extra quantization energies of the electron and hole.149 The optical Eg of A′2An−1BnX3n+1 perovskite generally decreases as the n value increases. For example, the Eg value for BA2An−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites decrease with increased layer thickness from 2.24 eV (n = 1) to 1.52 eV (n = ∞) due to quantum-confinement effects associated with dimensional increase (Fig. 5b and c).150 The size and electronegativity of the halide and metal ions can also affect Eg, which increases as their size decreases. Pb has a lower Pauling electronegativity in comparison to Sn, so the Pb electronic states are higher in the band structure.99 This flexibility of bandgap tuning, as well as composition tailoring for 3D/2D multi-dimensional perovskite, can facilitate various optoelectronic applications with targeted optical Eg materials.
Excitons have an essential influence on charge transport in semiconductors.151 The 2D structure generally shows a large exciton binding energy (Eb) of several hundred meV (Fig. 5d), which significantly enhances the interaction between electrons and holes compared to 3D perovskites.152 For quasi-3D perovskites (i.e., 3D perovskite mixed with 2D perovskites), Eb is smaller and is comparable to 3D perovskites.153 Because of this MQW band structure and large Eb values, low-n (e.g., n < 5) 2D perovskites often exhibit significant transport barrier across the adjacent 2D perovskite sheets. To address this challenge, various efforts have focused on controlling the growth of the inorganic perovskite framework perpendicular to the substrate to facilitate vertical charge transport for efficient charge collection in PV devices.154–157
Although the large Eb in low-n 2D perovskites may be detrimental for charge separation in solar cells, it can be beneficial for other optoelectronic applications beyond solar cells. For instance, the excitonic effect can significantly promote radiative recombination, which leads to higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in perovskite-based LED devices, making them excellent candidates for high-efficiency LEDs. Additionally, the excitonic character in 2D perovskites also results in interesting and tunable exciton–phonon,158 exciton–photon,159 and exciton–exciton coupling,160,161 as well as the formation of self-trapped excitons (which leads to broadband emission) and many other paths for relevant optoelectronic applications.
3.2. Charge-transport dynamics
The confining nature of 2D perovskite results in anisotropic conductivity and carrier mobility along various crystallographic directions. In general, when measured along the plane of the inorganic sheet, the conductivity and mobility are much better in comparison to that measured perpendicular to the sheets. The challenge of out-of-plane charge transfer is caused by the relatively high resistive, low mobility organic interlayer between adjacent higher mobility inorganic conductive sheets. In addition, the charge-transfer behavior of 2D perovskite also shows a strong dependence on the n value. In RP 2D perovskite films, the holes transfer from high-n QWs or the bulk to low-n phase along with electrons flowing in the opposite direction.85,162 An optimized n distribution of the QWs will enable more-efficient charge transfer across 2D structures with mixed n values. In addition, as the ratio of the number of inorganic perovskite plates per organic spacer increases, the mobility increases significantly as a continuous inorganic pathway is achieved. The orientation of the 2D perovskite layers is critical to the device performance: when the inorganic plates are arranged parallel to the charge-collection direction, better device performance can usually be obtained.
The charge-transport mechanism between inorganic layers has been proposed to be mediated by a tunneling process163,164 with the organic molecules acting as barriers. Tunnel junctions have two key factors affecting charge transport: tunneling distance and barrier height. The latter is more complex and unpredictable than the former. The out-of-plane charge transport is generally believed to increase when the interlayer distance decreases,164 although a systematic study is still absent from the literature. The tunneling barrier height can vary depending on the following two primary effects: (1) the intermolecular coupling between adjacent organic cations, and (2) the energy arrangement between the perovskite transport belt and the oxidation or reduction potential of organic cations.
Based on these considerations, we divide the strategies to improve charge transport of 2D perovskites into four parts: (1) process engineering (e.g., hot casting154,155 and solvent ratio tuning165–169); (2) additive engineering (e.g., NH4SCN,170,171 NH4Cl,170 MACl,172 PbI2,173 and HI174) to tune the orientation of 2D perovskite films; (3) engineering based on small cations (e.g., FA+,62,175 MA+, or Cs+ (ref. 156 and 157)) to align perovskite 2D sheets and orientation of corresponding 2D perovskite films; and (4) engineering based on choice of bulky cations (e.g., F-PEA and MeO-PEA106,112,114,164,176,177) to adjust the coupling between perovskite 2D sheets and the energy levels of organic layers. These strategies have been used mainly in low-n 2D perovskite in solar cells, and we discuss the details of how these strategies affect charge transport in the next section.
4. Application in solar cells
Here, we discuss the application of 2D perovskites in solar cells. This section is organized in four parts: (1) the application of low-n 2D (n ≤ 5) perovskites as absorbers in devices; (2) 3D/2D mixed perovskites as absorbers in devices; (3) 2D perovskite as an interfacial layer on the bottom and top surface of 3D perovskite; and (4) Pb-free 2D perovskites as absorbers in devices.
4.1. 2D and quasi-2D perovskites with n ≤ 5

4.1.1. Process engineering. 
Although water (or moisture) is sometimes beneficial to device preparation, a humid environment is usually considered as a key factor that accelerates the degradation of PSCs under practical operation conditions.150 In 2014, Karunadasa et al. demonstrated the first quasi-2D perovskites (PEA2MA2Pb3I10; n = 3) in mesoscopic PSCs. Although the cell efficiency (4.73%) was low at that time (Table 1), the quasi-2D perovskite film did show great promise regarding stability after 40 days of storage under ambient conditions with 52% relative humidity (RH), whereas the 3D counterpart degraded quickly within 4–5 days.50

The 2D perovskite film surface is normally rough, and there are many defects at the surface/boundary of 2D perovskites prepared with the normal one-step process due to the rapid crystallization process.150,153 In addition, charge transport is anisotropic for directions across and within the 2D sheets; thus, it is strongly affected by the crystal orientation relative to the substrate.150 Tsai et al. first reported the hot-casting method for preparing 2D perovskite (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4).154 Interestingly, hot casting promoted the growth-oriented 2D perovskite films with the inorganic framework more aligned vertically to the substrate (Fig. 6a), which would enable better pathways of charge transport. The corresponding 2D devices exhibited better stability compared to their 3D counterpart. The device performance was brought over 10% for the first time for 2D PSCs. Since this study, the hot-casting method has become a standard approach for preparing various 2D PSCs.174,178 However, this method is difficult as it requires precise control of the substrate temperature, which can then affect the batch-to-batch reproducibility. Gao et al. deposited the precursor solutions by a substrate-heated drop-casting method, which allowed self-assembly into uniform and oriented 2D-(BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) perovskite films in air (Fig. 6b), yielding PSCs with PCE of up to 14.9%.179 Zhao et al. proposed a slow post-annealing (SPA) process for BA2MA3Pb4I13 (n = 4) 2D PSCs, and a favorable alignment of bandgap energy within 2D perovskite (from bottom (n = 1) to top (n = ∞)) was achieved due to gradients in vertical distribution of different perovskite phases after SPA. As a result, they obtained the champion performance of 17.26%.180 Hu et al. reported another strategy by introducing a vacuum poling treatment to arrange different-n-value nanoplates and to enforce uniform nucleation during crystallization.181 Using this approach, a PCE of 18.04% based on (PEA)2MA4Pb5I16 (n = 5) was demonstrated.

Copyright 2019, Wiley-VCH. 
When 2D perovskite films are formed from the hot-casting process, heterogeneous nucleation mainly occurs at the gas/liquid interface, which helps to form a thin sheet-like capping layer on the outmost surface of the perovskite film. As a result, the rapid volatilization of DMF facilitates homogeneous nucleation, resulting in the formation of randomly oriented perovskite grains in the inner layer. To address this issue, Fan et al. fabricated the devices through mixed solvent engineering of DMF/DMSO, which improved PCE from ∼6% (pure DMF) to ∼11% (DMF/DMSO 1:3).165 By using DMF/DMSO solvent engineering, the solvent volatilization process is used to modulate the crystallization process which makes the perovskite cover act as the seed—thus promoting the subsequent perovskite crystallization perpendicular to the inner layer of the perovskite film (Fig. 6c). In another study, Huang et al. showed that specific solvents strongly affect the crystallization kinetics and crystal orientation of the resulting 2D perovskites by hot-casting.166 Among several solvents, dimethylacetamide (DMAC) shows weak coordination to Pb and ammonium salts, suitable boiling point, and low polarity; thus, it is easy to remove during solution processing, and it can facilitate rapid crystallization of 2D perovskites. As a result of proper solvent selection, a PCE from 7.33% (from DMF) to 12.15% (from DMAC) was demonstrated.
For the anti-solvent method, the mechanism of formation are different according to Zhang's recent report.167 The coordination strength of the solvent with perovskite precursor affects the formation of intermediate complexes and the subsequent growth of the 2D perovskite layer. Perovskite structure and intermediate complexes coexist after anti-solvent extraction and before thermal annealing of the DMF based precursor. During annealing, the existing perovskite and intermediate complex lead to different growth directions, which create structural mismatches and random boundaries. However, by using a mixed solvent (DMF/DMSO 5:5), only one intermediate complex is formed after anti-solvent extraction and before annealing. As a result, one direction of perovskite growth is enhanced and the 2D perovskites exhibit preferred orientation/alignment (Fig. 6d). Consistent with the improved quality of the 2D perovskite films, the devices based on mixed solvents (DMF:DMSO, 5:5) also showed >80% performance improvement (from 6.78% to 12.29%) over those made with pure DMF by using the anti-solvent extraction method.
It is worth noting that at present, different reports often conclude different growth mechanisms, despite the reported use of the same growth methods. More detailed mechanistic studies are required to obtain a deeper, more actuate understanding of how the hot-casting or solvent processing routes impact the crystallization process.


4.1.2. Additive engineering. 
Additives can also assist the growth of vertically oriented 2D perovskite films.170–173 Chen et al. first added ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) into a room-temperature, one-step, spin-coated process method.171 After introducing the NH4SCN, one can clearly observe vertical-oriented larger grains perpendicular to the substrate with almost no grain boundary, resulting in increased carrier lifetime and transport mobility, leading to improved efficiency and shelf life of the unencapsulated device. Later, they applied NH4SCN to (PEA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) films, and the device performance improved from 0.56% to 11.01% due to the highly crystalline, vertically orientated 2D perovskite films (Fig. 7a) and improved electron/hole transport.182 With the cooperation of NH4Cl and NH4SCN to further enhance the crystallization and charge transport, PSC based on (PEA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) obtained an efficiency of 14.1%.170

In 3D PSCs, MACl is shown to slow down the speed of perovskite film formation and benefit the film coverage, resulting in much-improved performance.183,184 Chen et al. reported using a MACl-assisted method to prepare highly oriented 2D-perovskite (ThMA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (n = 3) thin films, resulting in improved PCE from 1.74% to more than 15%.185 After applying a MACl treatment, the 2D perovskite formed a unique nanorod-shape morphology, and showed a significant increase in crystal size, out-of-plane orientation (Fig. 7b), and carrier lifetime. Other groups have reported similar phenomena.186 PbI2 as a typical Lewis acid can also form self-induced passivation in 2D-perovskite films with reduced surface defects.173
Chen et al. recently introduced a second spacer cation (SSC+) approach by adding PEAI into the BA2MA4Pb5I16 (n = 5) perovskite precursor solution.187 If PEAI is not added, a large number of the nuclei will precipitate from the precursor solution, resulting in small-grained perovskite films. However, after adding PEAI, the presence of precursor agglomerates may induce preferential nucleation and reduce the nucleation density, facilitating the formation of large grains (Fig. 7c). This approach leads to the demonstration of a PCE of 14.09% and ∼10% degradation of an unsealed device after 1000 h air exposure. They also used Gua+ as the SSC+ and obtained a similar result in a follow-up study.188
Although using excessive additives can lead to better crystallinity, it also results in a large gap between grains, thus reducing the PV performance.189 Chen et al. reported a sequential post-treatment process to make ACI 2D PSCs with high performance, where they sequentially used guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) and MACl as post-treatment agents (Fig. 7d).190 GuaSCN treatment has a significant effect on the perovskite morphology, leading to the fusion of segregated grains into dense and ordered grains. The trap state can be further passivated by subsequent MACl treatment; as a result, the performance is enhanced to 15.27% (Table 2).

4.1.3. Small-cation engineering. 
Previous reports have shown that Cs+ can effectively assist the crystallization of more stable 3D perovskite due to entropy gains if phase segregation is avoided.191,192 The surface morphology and apparent grain size of the 2D perovskite film are improved (Fig. 8a) by replacing MA+ with Cs+ based on the hot-casting method,156 thereby reducing the trap density, increasing the mobility of charge carriers, and improving the thermal stability. The enhanced film quality and the corresponding structural and optoelectronic properties significantly improved PCE from 12.3% to 13.68% (Table 3). Moreover, the 5% Cs+-doped devices only exhibited a degradation of 11% from its initial PCE value after 1400 h air exposure with 30% RH.

It was further reported that incorporating a suitable amount of FA+ can effectively control BA2(MAxFA1−x)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) crystallization kinetics for enlarging crystal grains with increased crystallinity (Fig. 8b), leading to high-quality films with limited nonoriented phases and reduced recombination centers.62In situ photoluminescence (PL) techniques showed that the low-n-number 2D phase was formed early, then n = ∞ perovskite was eventually formed. After the introduction of 20% FA+, the BA2(MA0.8FA0.2)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) perovskite-based devices displayed the highest performance of 12.81%, resulting from enhanced carrier lifetime and crystal orientation. Ke et al. employed MA+ and FA+ cations in 3-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (3AMP2+)-based 2D perovskite.71 Single-cation (3AMP)(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite shows a wider bandgap, more distorted inorganic structure, and smaller Pb–I–Pb angles compared to that of mixed-cation (3AMP)(MA0.75FA0.25)3Pb4I13 perovskite. Adding a small amount of hydroiodic acid further improved film morphology, crystal quality, and vertical orientation, leading to the demonstration of 12.04%-efficient devices based on (3AMP)(MA0.75FA0.25)3Pb4I13 (n = 4).
Based on these findings, Zhang et al. first reported the use of mixed triple cations (MA+, FA+, and Cs+) in fabricating 2D BA2(Cs0.02MA0.64FA0.34)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) perovskites.175 Compared with the traditional MA-based counterparts, the use of these mixed triple cations leads to the film formation with smooth/dense surface morphology, bigger grain size, fewer grain boundary, and stronger crystallographic texture (Fig. 8c and d). In addition, the corresponding perovskite films with the triple cations showed a longer carrier lifetime and higher conductivity. Compared with devices prepared by mono A-cation (MA+), PCE of 2D BA2(Cs0.02MA0.64FA0.34)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) devices with triple cations increased from 7.80% to 14.23%. Recently, Zhou et al. also reported a similar effect and demonstrated a PCE of 15.58% based on BA2(MA0.76FA0.19Cs0.05)3Pb4I13 (n = 4) with 8.6% excess PbI2.157 The approach based on these triple cations is also found to be effective for mixed Pb/Sn perovskites (BA)2(FA0.85Cs0.15)3 (Pb0.6Sn0.4)4I13 (n = 4).193


4.1.4. Bulky-cation engineering. 
Although PEA+ and BA+ represent the most commonly studied bulky cations so far, other large-sized organic cations have been incorporated into 2D perovskites and subsequently into solar cells. The suitability of a bulky cation includes its hydrogen-bonding capacity, stereochemical configuration, and space-filling ability.65 Spin–orbit coupling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the increased length of the barrier molecule would result in decreased electrical conductivity.100 Moreover, it was shown that a better open-circuit voltage (Voc) could be achieved when the charge is localized on the barrier molecule whereas a better current density was obtained when the charge is more delocalized.
Zhang et al. recently reported the application of F-PEA by introducing fluorine to the para position of PEA in 2D perovskites.106 F-PEA can better align the stacking of perovskite sheets and decrease the average phenyl ring centroid–centroid distances in the organic layer, which would result in better interlayer electronic coupling and higher out-of-plane conductivity (Fig. 9a). Using the anti-solvent deposition method at room temperature, the efficiency of 13.64% was achieved by (F-PEA)2MA4Pb5I16 (n = 5)-based PSCs in the absence of any additives (Table 4). In addition, F-PEA-based 2D PSCs displayed improved thermal stability relative to PEA-based devices. The same results were later confirmed by other reports.111,112,194 In another recent study, Wang et al. report a method of using 4-aminoethyl pyridine (4-AEP) as a bi-functional organic cation to adjust the crystallization rate of 2D perovskite.195 4-AEP not only can react with PbI2 to form 2D perovskite but can also coordinate with Pb2+ (pyridyl unit) to slow down the crystallization rate, thus controlling the nucleation growth. As a result, the device based on (4-AEP)2MA4Pb5I16 (n = 5) perovskite achieved a PCE of 11.68%, which is higher than that of PEA-based devices prepared under the same condition.

The bulky cations of DJ-phase perovskites with two amino groups can form a single layer with hydrogen bonds to the two neighboring inorganic sheets. This structural feature was shown to improve the material stability compared to RP-type perovskites (with a van der Waals gap).74,164 Kanatzidis et al. first reported PSCs based on DJ-phase perovskites (aminomethyl)piperidinium (3AMP) and 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP).69 The Pb–I–Pb angles of 3AMP-based perovskite are bigger than that of perovskite based on 4AMP, indicating more orbitals overlap between the I p and Pb s,196 thus resulting in a reduced bandgap (Fig. 9b). The structural change also led to the difference in device performance. Specifically, devices based on 4AMP-based perovskite (n = 4) showed a lower PCE of 4.24% compared to 3AMP-based counterpart (7.32%); the higher performance associated with 3AMP largely results from the smaller bandgap and improved transport property. Later, Ma et al. proposed propane-1,3-diammonium (PDA) with reduced cation length to form 2D perovskites.164 Compared to BA-based 2D perovskites, charge transport across neighboring inorganic perovskite layers are greatly enhanced. As a result, the corresponding devices achieved a high PCE of 13.0% with improved stability. Other bulky cations (e.g., (aminomethyl)pyridinium (4AMPY), (adamantan-1-yl)methanammonium (A), and 1,4-phenylenedimethanammonium (PDMA)) are also reported as candidates to the DJ-type 2D perovskites.71,139,177
The ACI-type 2D perovskites adopt a larger crystal symmetry and different stacking, which can decrease the bandgap compared to RP perovskites with the same n values. Kanatzidis et al. reported the first ACI 2D perovskite (Gua)(MA)nPbnI3n+1 (n = 1–3) along with the application in solar cells with a good performance of 7.26%.72 Later, Zhao et al. compared anti-solvent and hot-casting methods to get more insight into the kinetic transformation process.73 The formed intermediate phases, (Gua)2PbI4 perovskite, is critical to the subsequent transformation into (Gua)(MA)3Pb3I10 (n = 3) perovskites. This material was able to achieve a PCE of 14.68% via use of an anti-solvent approach. MACl was later added to the precursor to further improve the (Gua)(MA)3Pb3I10 (n = 3) films’ morphology and QW's distribution (Fig. 9c), resulting in the an impressive PCE (18.48%) for 2D PSCs.51 1,4-Butanediamine (BEA) was used as a bulky organic cation to form a new type of 2D perovskite in which BEA2+ and MA+ alternating cations are in the interlayer space (B-ACI) (Fig. 9d), this combines advantages of DJ and ACI perovskites.197 Devices based on (BEA)0.5MA3Pb3I10 perovskite reached a performance of 14.86%, which further increased to 17.39% by alloying with Cs, FA, and Br into the composition ((BEA)0.5Cs0.15(FA0.83MA0.17)2.85Pb3(I0.83Br0.17)10).

4.2. 3D/2D mixed perovskite
The pure 2D (n = 1) PSCs do not exhibit efficiencies as high as 3D PSCs due to their larger bandgaps and restricted transport across the organic spacer layers. In contrast, 3D/2D multidimensional perovskites formed by incorporating 2D perovskites into 3D perovskites (using bulky cations to replace small amounts of organic cations in the precursor solution) has recently appeared to be a promising approach to balance good device performance with long-term operational stability.198
Based on the previous report of better stability of low-n 2D perovskites,50 Yao et al. reported a facile two-step method to form uniform, compact (MAPbI3)1−x[(PEI)2PbI4]x 3D/2D perovskite films. By spin-coating an initial PbI2 and polyethylenimine hydriodide (PEI·HI) mixed solution, then coated with a CH3NH3I layer to produce a film.199 The in situ-formed (PEI)2PbI4 incorporation was shown to retard perovskite growth and promote the formation of a continuous uniform film, and the formation of 3D perovskite crystals with domains hindered by increasing the number of 2D materials. A champion PCE of 15.2% was obtained from this approach for a (MAPbI3)0.98[(PEI)2PbI4]0.02 film and displayed better humidity stability than the reference 3D MAPbI3-based devices (Table 5).

Park et al. used a small amount of PEAI to fabricate (PEA2PbI4)0.017(MAPbI3)0.983 PSCs, and the devices showed comparable performance and better stability compared to that of MAPbI3-based devices. However, the small amount of incorporated PEA2PbI4 still resulted in a lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) than that of MAPbI3-based devices.200 Later, by applying AVA2PbI4 into a printable MAPbI3-based mesoporous HTM-free device, Nazeeruddin et al. demonstrated a performance of 11.2% by (AVA2PbI4)0.03(MAPbI3)0.97 on a 10 × 10 cm2 module; the device exhibited no degradation in performance after testing for >10000 h under continuous illumination at 55 °C.52 FA- and Cs-based perovskites generally exhibit better stability than MA-based ones for 3D perovskites.31 Based on this consideration, Snaith et al. introduced BA+ into a mixed-cation 3D FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(IyBr1−y)3 perovskite.55 They found the formation of 2D perovskite flakes scattered among highly oriented 3D perovskite grains; these 2D perovskite structures significantly reduced nonradiative charge recombination (Fig. 10a). As a result, a BA0.05(FA0.83Cs0.17)0.95Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3-based PSC was achieved with a PCE of 20.6%. The energetic alignment across the 3D/2D interface is found to be similar to a standard type-I or type-II heterojunction due to the wider bandgap of 2D perovskite.124,201 By further increasing ratios of BA+ cations and Br anions, BA0.09(FA0.83Cs0.17)0.91Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite was developed with enhanced device stability; the corresponding devices showed only 20% performance degradation after 1000 h in air and almost 4000 h with encapsulation under light illumination. A similar trend was also observed with other bulky salts, such as (2-chloroethylamine) (CEA+), 2-thiophenemethylammonium (ThMA) and dimethylamine (DMA).202–209

Ammonium salts containing a short-branched chain than commonly used PEA+ and BA+ may exhibit better charge-transport properties when used in 2D perovskites. Lioz Etgar et al. introduced 1,4-benzenedimethanamonium iodide (BzDAI) with a relatively short length and aromatic ring with free π-electrons to enhance the charge transport.210 The PSCs with (BzDA)(Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.8)9Pb10(I0.93Br0.07)31 (n = 10) achieved an efficiency of 15.6%, and the devices also exhibited better stability under humidity and illumination. Some other bulky cations (e.g., carbazole alkylammonium iodide derivative (CAI) and phenyltrimethylammonium (PTA)) also showed the same trend.98,120,211
Using bulky, large-sized organic halide salts (e.g., BAI and PEAI) has been shown to reduce the defect density of 3D perovskites. However, the formation of RP-type 2D perovskites within these structures could reduce Jsc of devices due to quantum-confinement effects. Recently, addition of guanidinium cations (Gua+) have been reported to form highly stable 3D crystalline structures to improve the solar cell performance for MAPbI3- or FAPbI3-based PSCs.212–217 In another study, a large Gua cation was incorporated into Cs0.1(FA0.83MA0.17)0.9Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskites to form Guax(CsFAMA)1−x mixed-cation perovskites.218 The color of the corresponding perovskite films changed from black for 0% Gua+ to brown for 40% Gua+ (Fig. 10b). Incorporation of 10% Gua+ resulted in the best device performance (PCE of 21.12%) with higher carrier lifetime and lower trap density due to the strong passivation from the Gua+ additive.
In addition to increasing the stability against heat and moisture, the use of 2D perovskite is also often reported as an effective additive for phase stabilization in inorganic CsPbI3155,219–221 or FAPbI3,222–224 which are known to have phase instabilities with respect to the α-to-δ phase transition at room temperature. Zhang et al. recently demonstrated the use of a small amount of 2D EDAPbI4 (ethylenediamine, EDA) perovskite into the CsPbI3 perovskite to significantly enhance the phase stability of α-CsPbI3.220 Following this preparation approach, the apparent grain size of CsPbI3·xEDAPbI4 decreased with increasing EDAPbI4 content and the number of pinholes was much reduced (Fig. 10c), resulting in the all-inorganic PSC with a PCE of 11.8%. Other studies have also shown enhanced phase stability of CsPbI3 PSCs by using other 2D perovskite additives.155,221 These results show that the construction of quasi-2D or 3D/2D mixed perovskites represents an effective approach to enhance phase stability of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite.
FAPbI3 is another well-known perovskite composition that also has a significant phase-stability issue. Adding a small amount of Cs+ to FAPbI3 to form CsFAPbI3 is one effective way to improve the phase stability by tuning the tolerance factor;27 however, it generally widens the bandgap, leading to a reduction of Jsc. Incorporating a certain amount of 2D BA2Pb(I/Br)4 into the perovskite precursor facilitates the formation of phase-pure FA-based perovskite. Further passivation of grain boundaries by semiconducting molecules with Lewis base groups significantly improved charge-carrier dynamics, leading to devices with PCE of 20.62% and improved stability.224 The benefits of incorporating PEA+-based 2D structures into 3D perovskites were also reported by other groups.222,223 Complementary additives PEAI and Pb(SCN)2 were used to improve a wide-bandgap (1.68 eV) PSC with an efficiency of ∼20%.22 Tong et al. applied GuaSCN to low-bandgap Sn–Pb mixed-perovskite thin films to improve their structural and optoelectronic properties resulting from the formation of a 2D structure at grain boundaries (Fig. 10d).54 New strategies to “design” 2D-PPAs with enhanced charge transport are necessary for further advancing efficient and stable 2D-PPA based-3D PSCs.
4.3. Interface modification with 2D perovskites
A 2D perovskite thin layer can also be added to the top of a 3D perovskite absorber as an interfacial layer between the perovskite absorber and charge-transport/contact layer; this interfacial engineering was also shown to improve the perovskite absorber layer with lower defect densities and longer carrier lifetimes.226 The 2D interfacial layer is usually processed by spin coating an isopropanol (IPA) solution containing long-chain alkyl-ammonium halides on top of a 3D perovskite involving a cation exchange reaction. The 2D perovskite interfacial layer is expected to enhance moisture resistance and reduce surface defects by combining large hydrophobic cations with effective charge-transfer properties.227 In addition, Herz et al. found that the blue-shift emission from the quasi-2D region overlaps the absorption spectrum of 3D perovskite, which leads to efficient heterogeneous photon recovery.228
Structural analysis has been commonly used to verify the formation of the 2D perovskite structure on top the 3D perovskite absorber in a device stack. Nazeeruddin et al. demonstrated the layered 2D perovskite PEA2PbI4 with distinct X-ray diffraction (XRD) features on top of the 3D Cs0.1FA0.74MA0.13PbI2.48Br0.39 perovskite films (Fig. 11a).229 When incorporating the PEA2PbI4 perovskite top layer, the PSCs exhibit a higher PCE of 20.1% (Table 6). In addition, the devices exhibited less than 15% of performance degradation under illumination in ambient air at 50 °C over 800 h. Other groups also reported similar results of PEAI.230–232 Based on the application of PEAI, Grätzel et al. recently introduced five fluorine atoms to PEAI forming pentafluorophenylethylammonium iodide (F5PEAI) and applied its IPA solution for the post-growth treatment of the 3D perovskite absorber.233 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling of fluorine (F) and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) peak width (Fig. 11b) established the presence of ∼8–9 nm 2D perovskite on the top. The 2D layer also enhances interfacial charge collection and enables the device performance of >22%. Unencapsulated PSCs only showed 10% degradation after 1000 hours under illumination in ambient air.

Seo et al. reported the use of a mixed solvent (o-dichlorobenzene:IPA = 97:3, v/v) containing n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) solution and spin-coated on top of the 3D perovskite surface to form a wide-bandgap perovskite layer, which is confirmed by HRTEM of the device cross-section near the interface region (Fig. 11d).21 The HTAB molecule comprises a functionalized moiety (N+(CH3)3−) and an aliphatic moiety (C6H13−). The C6H13− could form van der Waals interactions between the perovskite and organic HTM, which would promote the self-assembly of P3HT. As a result, they attained a PCE of 23.3%, and the encapsulated devices maintained more than 95% of their initial PCE for 1370 h with maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) under continuous light soaking at room temperature. Some other organic cations, with optimized concentration, have also shown similar results with enhanced stability and efficiency; these organic cations include BAI,226 cyclopropylammonium iodide (CAI),234 octylammonium iodide (OAI),226,235 dodecylammonium iodide (DAI),235 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI),236n-butylammonium bromide (BABr),237 long-chain aliphatic alkylammonium chloride (CmH2m+1NH3Cl, m = 8, 10, 12),238 and 3-(nonafluoro-tert-butyloxy)propylamine hydroiodide (A43).239
For the pure 2D perovskite, many achievements have been made in determining the properties of the films, such as charge transfer between QW and n-layer distribution.162,240 However, the influence of the cationic chemical dependence of 2D/3D heterostructures on charge collection and final PV performance has not been fully developed. This is important for ensuring effective charge extraction from the 2D interfacial layer. Along this direction, Liu et al. conducted a study to deepen the understanding of how interface engineering or composition adjustment can affect the 2D and 3D interface in FAPbI3-based solar cells (Fig. 11c).25 They found that better QW distribution with faster charge-transfer mechanics can improve carrier mobility and charge collection and can reduce recombination. The 2D/3D film based on PEA:FA (1:1) achieves a balance between charge transport within QWs and passivation at the 2D/3D heterojunction, resulting in an efficiency of 21.15%, which is significantly higher than that of the 3D counterpart (19.02%). In addition to the performance improvement, the device also displayed impressive long-term environmental stability. A similar effect was also found in the PEAI-treated MAPbI3 devices.241
So far, most studies have focused on the structure and optoelectronic properties of the 2D perovskite layer. Bawendi et al. recently pointed out that the deposition method is a critical factor for manufacturing high-efficiency 2D/3D PSCs.242 In this study, the precursor and solvent (linear alkylammonium bromide/chloroform) were combined as a selective precursor dissolution strategy to effectively form a transparent 2D perovskite layer onto the 3D perovskite thin film. This strategy passivated defects, resulting in improved carrier lifetime and Voc. As a result, they obtained a champion PCE of 23.4% with a certified stabilized PCE of 22.6% based on n-hexylammonium bromide (C6Br).
Treatment of ammonium salt or derivatives to 3D perovskite films could lead to the formation of an organic cation layer rather than a 2D capping layer; these organic cations could also passivate defects and improve the performance of PSCs. Some additional candidates include octylammonium iodide (OAI),243 tetra-ethyl ammonium (TEA),244 mixed hydroiodic acid and oleylamine (OLA-HI),245 MABr/FAI,246 choline iodine (CHI),247 PEAI,13,248 phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr),249 and GuaBr.250 The underlying mechanisms are still not known as to why some cations can form 2D capping layer under particular process conditions whereas some cannot; however, several reports have clear evidence (2D XRD, GIWAXS, SEM, or HRTEM) to support the formation of a 2D perovskite layer on 3D perovskite.21,25,226,229,237,242
It is challenging to realize the formation of a 2D capping layer for all-inorganic Cs-based perovskites. To address this challenge, Lin et al. demonstrated an in situ growth method to form 2D/3D heterostructured on inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite.251 By adding some DMSO in the alkyl-ammonium halide IPA solutions to tune the conversion process, they were able to demonstrate a type-II heterojunction between the 2D and 3D perovskites, which resulted in enhanced hole collection and reduced carrier recombination. As a result, both device performance and stability against humid environment were improved compared to the control device without the 2D perovskite surface treatment.
Thus, forming a 2D capping layer or just an organic cation layer can passivate surface defects (and possibly bulk defects); but it also can form a heterojunction to decrease nonradiative recombination and enhance charge-carrier separation. The energy offset at the heterojunction may also produce an energy barrier hindering charge transfer across the 2D/3D heterojunction. More studies should focus on developing the synthesis control to form a transparent 2D capping layer with controlled energy levels and/or the layer thickness (i.e., n value) of the 2D structures.197,252 Design of new bulky organic cations that could form stable 2D structures with enhanced plane-to-plane charge transport along with new ways to control the 2D structure/composition will further advance the performance and stability of 2D-modified 3D PSCs.106,175

One research topic in the perovskite field is evaluating Pb alternatives so as to reduce the potential toxic impact from Pb.254–256 For this reason, some researchers have explored quasi-2D perovskites by replacing Pb2+ with Sn2+,257 such as PEA2FAn−1SnnI3n+1,258 where a 2D/3D (PEA,FA)SnI3 bulk heterojunction structure was shown to exhibit improved device performance and stability. In another study, different bulky cations benzylammonium (BzA+) and histammonium (HA2+) were applied to form BzA2Pb1−xSnxI4 and HAPb1−xSnxI4 perovskites.99 The inorganic frameworks of Sn-based 2D perovskite (n = 1) is less distorted than that of 2D Pb-based perovskites,255 leading to slightly smaller bandgaps (Fig. 12a).

Kanatzidis et al. first used triethylphosphine (TEP) as an intermediate coordinating ligand to improve film quality of PEA2MA3Sn4I13 (n = 4, Fig. 12b), resulting in a PCE of 2.53% (Table 7).259 By increasing the 2D layer thickness to nine, (PEA)2(FA)8Sn9I28 showed much better stability compared to 3D FASnI3-based devices.260 Importantly, (PEA)2(FA)8Sn9I28 also showed much improved Voc (0.59 V) compared to 3D FASnI3, leading to an efficiency of 5.94%. The improved Voc in the quasi-2D perovskites was attributed to a lower defect density associated with suppressed Sn2+ oxidation. By further improving the n number, PEA2FA49Sn50I151-based solar cells showed 9% efficiency for Sn-based PSCs, which is much better than the 6% efficiency for the control device based on 3D FASnI3.261 Huang et al. first used the mixed bulky organic cations PEA and BA in 2D Sn-based perovskites to control the crystallization process.262 Combining BA+ and PEA+ to (BA0.5PEA0.5)2FA3Sn4I13 (n = 4) 2D perovskites effectively suppressed the intermediate phase that hinders the uniform nucleation of the perovskite crystals, resulting in improved perovskite morphology and orientation (Fig. 12c) along with a higher PCE of 8.82%.

Sn(II)-Based DJ-type 2D perovskite, (4AMP)(FA)n−1SnnI3n+1 was recently reported by Zhou et al. in solar cells with a performance of over 4%; the unencapsulated device showed 9% degradation after 100 h under 1 sun illumination in N2 atmosphere at 45 °C (Fig. 12d).263 They further investigated a series of DJ-type 2D Pb-free perovskites of (diammonium)(FA)n−1SnnX3n+1 (n = 1–4) with the target to overcome the charge-transport limitation.264 The diammonium candidates include anthra[2,3-b:7,8-b′]bis(5-thiopheneylmethanammonium) (ATMA), 2,10-hexacenediyldimethanammonium (HMA), 2,9-pentacenediyldimethanammonium (PMA), 2,8-tetracenediyldimethanammonium (TMA), or 2,6-anthracenediyldimethanammonium (AMA). Through DFT calculation, three compounds—(TMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, (PMA)(FA)3Sn4I13, and (ATMA)(FA)3Sn4I13—were identified to have a type-II band alignment (staggered bandgap) and fast charge transport.
5. Application beyond solar cells
In addition to solar cell applications, the excitonic character and versatile structure in the hybrid 2D perovskites also opens the door to other optoelectronic applications. For instance, the excitonic effect in low-n 2D perovskites can significantly promote radiative recombination, which leads to higher PLQY in perovskite-based LED devices, making them excellent candidates for high-efficiency LEDs. The structural versatility (i.e. organic or inorganic component, dimensionality, crystalline phase, impurity doping), if engineered properly, can allow precise tuning of their broadband emission, spin lifetime/population, magnetic ordering, along with associated optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. Below we summarize some of the pioneering work of using hybrid 2D perovskites for optoelectronic applications beyond solar cells, including LEDs, spintronics-devices, and photodetectors.
5.1. Light-emitting diodes
Two-dimensional metal halide perovskites have emerged as a promising candidate for high-performance light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the past few years. The superior properties of 2D layered perovskites as electroluminescent materials, when compared to their 3D counterparts, can be summarized as follows.
(1) 2D perovskites generally possess much larger exciton binding energies (hundreds of meV)265,266 due to dielectric and quantum confinement of the layered structure, which leads to an enhanced radiative recombination and thus higher PLQY.
(2) The formation of cascaded energy structures within 2D perovskite films with mixed n (layer thickness) can promote rapid and efficient energy transfer from lower-n quantum wells to higher-n quantum wells (in sub-ns), leading to a reduced exciton quenching effect and enhanced radiative recombination.
(3) The incorporation of hydrophobic organic ligands and the enhanced van der Waals interactions between the organic molecules result in a significantly enhanced ambient and thermal stability compared to 3D perovskites with no such hydrophobic molecules.
(4) The rich chemical tunability of 2D perovskites, including both organic and inorganic subcomponents, enables unprecedented opportunities to tune their optical and electrical properties for a much broader range of applications such as broadband emission, circular-polarized emission, and detection.
Here, we summarize recent progress in LEDs based on 2D layered perovskites (single-layer vs. quasi-2D and RP vs. DJ), excluding 3D ABX3-type perovskite thin films, 2D nanoplatelets/nanosheets, or quantum dots, which can be found elsewhere.17,267–272

5.1.1. LEDs based on single-layer n = 1 2D perovskites. 
The usage of RP-type 2D perovskites as electroluminescent layers within an LED can be traced back to Nurmikko's273 and Saito's274 work in the 1990s, where the optical properties of single-layered (n = 1) PEA2PbI4 were investigated and LED devices fabricated. However, they found that a very high (∼24 V) turn-on voltage was needed, and the electroluminescence efficiency and quantum yield was minimal at room temperature.274 It still remains difficult to fabricate high-efficiency LEDs based on n = 1 2D perovskites, even though they intrinsically possess a higher exciton binding energy. The poor performance is ascribed to poor out-of-plane (layer-to-layer) charge transport at low voltages due to the insulating organic ligands and fast nonradiative exciton quenching at room temperature due to powerful exciton–phonon coupling within the layers. The poor charge transport within the n = 1 2D system results in a high voltage to turn on the electroluminescence. The electron–phonon interactions, both for acoustic and optical phonons, is found to be orders of magnitude higher than found in GaAs quantum wells, leading to low PLQY at room temperature.275 For these reasons, there has been rather slow progress in LEDs based on n = 1 2D perovskite active layers over the last few decades. In 2016, Jin et al. used 2D layered PEA2PbBr4 nanoplates and fabricated color-pure violet LEDs emitting at 410 nm with a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.04% at 6 V at room temperature.276 In 2018, Sargent and co-workers systematically investigated the relationship between PLQY and electron–phonon interaction by preparing high-quality n = 1 2D perovskite single crystals.277 Through tuning the molecular structures of organic ammonium cations, they were able to control crystal rigidity and electron–phonon interactions, which leads to modulation of their PLQY. Their results showed that the greater the structure rigidity is, the brightest the emitter. Their optimized structure with PhC2 crystals, namely PEA2PbBr4, displayed a PLQY of 79%, although LED devices based on this formula were not fabricated. To address the challenges associated with strong electron–phonon interaction in n = 1 2D perovskites, the field has shifted focus to using quasi-2D (1 < n < ∞) layered perovskites as electroluminescent layers.


5.1.2. LEDs based on quasi-2D layered perovskites. 
In 2016, several breakthroughs were reported showing that electroluminescent layers based on quasi-2D perovskites can display better performance than even their 3D counterparts (Table 8). In the PEA2(MA)n−1PbnBr3n+1 (n = 1–4) system, Lee et al. demonstrated that the quasi-2D perovskites displayed a much higher current efficiency and luminance than 3D MAPbBr3 and 2D n = 1 PEA2PbBr4.278 By tuning the ratio of MAPbBr3 and PEA2PbBr4, they were able to achieve a high current efficiency of 4.90 cd A−1 and a luminance of 2935 cd m−2. The iodide-based analogue PEA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 5) has been demonstrated by Sargent and co-workers to outperform 3D MAPbI3 (n = ∞) for near-infrared emission, with an EQE of 8.8% and a radiance of 80 W sr−1 m−2.61 They further ascribed the superior performance to a cascading energy transfer that funnels photoexcitations to the lowest-bandgap phase within mixed quasi-2D perovskite thin film (Fig. 13a). Soon after that report, Huang and co-workers demonstrated quasi-2D perovskite LEDs based on (NMA)2(FAPbI3)n−1PbnI3n+1 with a recorded EQE of 11.7% and radiance of 82 W sr−1 m−2.279 Similarly, they also attributed the superior device performance to the funneling mechanism, which occurs within sub-ns timescales and outcompetes nonradiative exciton quenching and increases radiative recombination (Fig. 13b and c). By embedding the quasi-2D perovskites into a high-bandgap polymer forming a bulk heterojunction, Di and co-workers reported LEDs with a record EQE of 20.1%.280 The polymer component is stated to significantly suppress the bulk and interfacial non-radiative relaxation process. The same energy-funnel concept is also applied within the bromide system,281 PEA2(MA)n−1PbnBr3n+1, showing an EQE of 7.4% and luminescence of 8400 cd m−2 for green LEDs. By mixing PEA with IPA (iso-propylammonium), Sargent and co-workers showed that the mixed cation can destabilize n = 1 phase, and lead to the formation of only quasi-2D perovskites with n = 2, 3, and 4 phases.282 Their perovskite films showed a record PLQY of 88% at 477 nm. The corresponding LEDs device displayed stable sky-blue emission with a maximum luminance of 2480 cd m−2 achieved at 490 nm. You and co-workers reported other green LEDs based on PEA2(FAPbBr3)2PbBr4 (n = 3).283 With optimized phase engineering and surface passivation, they achieved a current efficiency of 62.4 cd A−1 and EQE of 14. 36%. The mixture of different phases (different layer thicknesses or n numbers) does not seem to be detrimental to LED performance; however, careful phase engineering to favor directional energy funneling is extremely important, and an ongoing challenge, for LEDs based on quasi-2D perovskites.

In addition to the superior LED performance when compared to 3D perovskites, quasi-2D perovskite also exhibit improved stability. Huang and co-workers demonstrated a T50 (the amount of time for the EQE to drop to half its initial value) of 2 h under a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is two orders of magnitude better than that based on 3D perovskites (T50 = 1 min).279 Recently, using phase-pure RP-type 2D perovskites based on BA2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1, Kanatzidis, Mohite, and co-workers achieved efficient electroluminescence with a radiance of 35 W sr−1 m−2 at 744 nm and a significantly enhanced stability (T50 > 14 h) compared to quasi-2D or 3D perovskite systems.285 Their results suggest that although mixed-phase quasi-2D perovskite can promote efficient energy funneling from lower n to higher n, growing phase-pure 2D perovskite is also an important route for improving device stability. Very recently, the stability of LED-based on quasi-2D perovskites has been dramatically improved by using the DJ rather than RP structure. Ning and co-workers demonstrated that LEDs based on the DJ quasi-2D perovskites ((BAB)FAn−1PbnX3n+1 (BAB: 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)benzene; X: Br, I)) exhibit a T50 of over 100 hours, which is nearly two orders of magnitude longer compared to LEDs based on RP quasi-2D perovskite systems (Fig. 13d).284 Their optimized LEDs exhibit an EQE of 5.2% with a maximum radiance of 88.5 W sr−1 m−2. Therefore, it is clear that a balance of LED device efficiency and stability requires careful optimization of organic ligands, crystallographic structure, phase engineering, and crystalline orientation of quasi-2D perovskites.


5.1.3. Broadband emission in 2D perovskites. 
Another interesting optical property of 2D perovskites, in addition to their excitonic emission, is broadband emission enabled by the rich chemical tunability in 2D metal halide perovskites. If the broadband emission covers the visible spectrum, then the emitters can be used as single-source white-light emitters at a high quantum efficiency to produce great energy-efficiency compared to current mixed phosphor based technology. The development of metal halide perovskites as single-source white-light emitters is a young, yet-emerging field. In 2014, seminal work from Karunadasa and co-workers demonstrated bright broadband visible emission in 2D perovskite (EDBE)PbX4 (Fig. 14a)132 and (N-MEDA)PbBr4−xClx,128 (N-MEDA: N1-methylethane-1,2-diammonium; EDBE: 2,2-(ethylenedioxy) bis(ethylammonium); X: Cl, Br). Since those results, several white-light-emitting 2D perovskites have been developed as single-source white-light phosphors (Table 9). From the standpoint of crystal structures, strong white-light emission has been discovered in both corrugated (110) and (001) Pb–Br and Pb–Cl perovskite-based layered systems. The reported 2D (110) layered perovskites that exhibit broadband emission are (N-MEDA)PbBr4−xClx, (N-MEDA)PbBr4, and α-(DMEN)PbBr4129 (α-DMEN: N1,N1-dimethylethane-1,2-diammonium). For instance, by tuning the halide composition in (110) (N-MEDA)PbBr4−xClx, Karunadasa128 and co-workers were able to improve the emission's color-rendering index (CRI) from 82 to 85, yet the PLQY was only 0.5–1.5%. The PLQY was subsequently improved with their second white-light-emitting (110) perovskite (EDBE)PbBr4,132 which displays a PLQY of 9% with a CRI of 84. In 2017, Kanatzidis and co-workers reported another white-light-emitting (110) perovskite, namely α-(DMEN)PbBr4, which emits cold white light with a CRI of 73.129 The first example of a (001) white-light-emitting perovskite is (EDBE)PbCl4, which emits cold white light with a CRI of 81 and a PQLY of 2%. Subsequently, other (001) white-light-emitting perovskites have been reported including (C6H11NH3)2PbBr4,286 (H3NC6H4(CH2)2NH3)PbBr4 or (AEA)PbBr4,122 (CyBMA)PbBr4 (CyBMA: cis-1,3-bis(ammoniomethyl)cyclohexane),287 and (EA)4Pb3BrxCl10−x (EA: CH3CH2NH3+).76 However, the demonstrated 2D perovskite compounds are still quite limited and the PLQYs observed to date remain low. An improved atomistic understanding is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism and origin of the bright broadband emission of these materials to enable higher PLQY.

Although some research groups attributed the broadband emission to crystal defects that serve as the broadband color centers,290,291 the mechanism of the broadband emission in these 2D perovskite systems is generally believed to be exciton self-trapping (Fig. 14b), where photoexcitation induces an excited-state lattice distortion mediated through the strong electron–lattice coupling.122,288 Ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopy results suggest that the photogenerated excitons self-trap in sub-ps (∼400 fs), which is followed by luminescence, and the lattice distortion leads to homogeneous emission broadening.64 The presence of multiple self-trapped exciton states can further broaden the emission inhomogeneously. Additionally, reducing the temperature generally leads to an enhanced broadband emission compared to free-exciton emission. This temperature-dependent emission property can be understood by the thermodynamics of the self-trapping and de-trapping processes (Fig. 14b),122 where the higher temperature provides enough activation energy to de-trap back to the free-exciton state from self-trapped exciton (kBT > Ea,detrap), thereby reducing the broadband emission and increasing the free-exciton emission. Therefore, although only a few 2D perovskites have been reported as white-light emitters, broadband emission in perovskites, in theory, can be generalized if the thermodynamic activation energies of self-trapping and de-trapping process are optimized at specific temperatures.
Thus far, most reported broadband-emitting 2D perovskites have been discovered with the special design of organic amines, where the broadband emission is ascribed to the intrinsic self-trapped excitons (Fig. 14c). More recently, Chen and co-workers demonstrated that impurity Sn dopants can trigger extrinsic self-trapping of excitons in PEA2PbI4, giving broadband red-to-near-infrared emission at room temperature (Fig. 14d).289 A similar observation has recently been reported by Mitzi and co-workers, which suggests that metal impurities, even at trace levels, should be considered more carefully when preparing these crystals and films, as they could have a fundamental impact on their optical and electronic properties.292 This introduces a new strategy—namely, dopant-induced extrinsic exciton self-trapping approach (Fig. 14c)—to the development of broadband-emitting perovskites. However, this field is still in its infancy, and more materials need to be investigated. A generalized theory and a mechanism of broadband emission, across different hybrid material systems, are very much needed for discovering next-generation white-light phosphors. For instance, the community is still searching for a simple and general correlation between broadband emission and structure dimensionality, crystal distortions (e.g., in-plane and out-of-plane octahedral distortion), and impurity dopants. Karunadasa and co-workers have shown an interesting linear correlation between the most considerable measured out-of-plane distortion Dout (180° − θout) and the ratio of broadband emission vs. excitonic emission at a given temperature, after rigorously testing over 50 other structural parameters.122 DFT calculations by Yan and co-workers revealed that a low electronic dimensionality, rather than the structural dimensionality, is a prerequisite for forming broadband emission, and only the self-trapped excitons with Jahn–Teller-like octahedral distortions can lead to the observed broadband emission.293

5.2. Spintronic application
Because of strong spin–orbital coupling (SOC) associated with heavy elements (e.g., Pb and I), hybrid metal halide perovskites are considered attractive candidates for spintronics and spin optoelectronics. In conjunction with inversion asymmetry, SOC in perovskites further leads to an effective magnetic field that lifts the degeneracy of the carrier spin states within the conduction and/or valence bands, which is often referred to as the Rashba effect.294 The spin-degenerate parabolic band is now split into two spin-polarized bands, and the new parabolic bands can be described by E ± (k) = (ħ2k2/2m*) ± αR|k|, where αR is the Rashba splitting parameter (Fig. 15a). Thus far, spin-optoelectronic devices based on 3D perovskites have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally,40,295–297 although the relative role of bulk and surface Rashba contributions is still under debate.298,299 This is because crystal structures of perovskite in bulk (i.e., tetragonal or orthorhombic) present inversion symmetry, where the Rashba effect should be forbidden. As such, it is proposed that the Rashba effect is a surface effect due to a structural distortion at the surface; but it is likely that surface reconstruction penetrates several hundred nanometers towards the bulk interior. In many cases, large Rashba splitting has been experimentally observed (by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES),300 for instance), suggesting they could be promising candidates for spintronic applications. Reduced dimensionality, namely from 3D perovskite to 2D perovskite, can further reduce the symmetry, resulting in an enhanced Rashba effect. This is similar to many aspects of 2D heterostructures in traditional semiconductors where the Rashba effect is often observed.301 Additionally, the rich chemical tunability of 2D perovskites—including controllable distortions of the inorganic framework, inorganic layer thickness, and organic components—makes 2D perovskites an exciting platform to investigate their structure–Rashba-effect relationships; it also brings new opportunities for spintronic applications. Here we summarized recent advances in spintronic devices based on 2D hybrid perovskites, neglecting those based on 3D perovskites which can be found in other literature reports.295,297,302–305

5.2.1. Rashba splitting in 2D perovskite. 
Based on the electroabsorption and photoinduced absorption spectra, Vardeny and co-workers reported a giant Rashba splitting in 2D n = 1 PEA2PbI4, with Rashba energy of (40 ± 5) meV and Rashba parameter of (1.6 ± 0.1) eV (Fig. 15b).306 Further DFT calculations showed that the Rashba splitting originates from the broken inversion symmetry due to Pb atom displacement from the octahedral center. This resulted in the Rashba band splitting in the plane perpendicular to the 2D barriers. However, a subsequent report from Mohammed and co-workers using both DFT calculations and time-resolved PL argued that intrinsic, large Rashba splitting only occurs in the 2D perovskite crystals with even number of inorganic layers, namely PEA2MAPb2I7 (n = 2), but not in the n = 1 or n = 3 crystals.307 Their results highlight the importance of the layer thickness in 2D perovskites for Rashba splitting. The presence of Rashba splitting in 2D BA2MAPb2I7 (n = 2) was also recently confirmed by Hall and co-workers, in which time-resolved circular dichroism techniques were used to probe the carrier spin-relaxation dynamics.308 Their simulations of the measured spin dynamics show a Rashba spin splitting of 10 meV at an electron energy of 50 meV above the bandgap. Also, a 2018 report measured the spin-relaxation dynamics to “indirectly” probe the Rashba effects in 2D perovskite systems.309 In this study, Beard and co-workers used a circularly polarized pump–probe method (Fig. 15c) to study the spin-coherence dynamics in 2D perovskite single crystals with different layer thicknesses (n = 1–4, ∞). They found that the spin-coherence lifetime increases with increasing layer thickness from n = 1 to n = 4, followed by a decrease from n = 4 to ∞ (Fig. 15d). These results were attributed to two counteracting contributions: (1) Rashba splitting increases the spin-coherence lifetime from the n = ∞ to the layered systems; and (2) phonon scattering, which increases for smaller n values, decreases the spin-coherence lifetime due to spin–lattice relaxation. They proposed that the Elliot–Yafet (EY) mechanism is the main cause for spin depolarization.
Using 2D perovskites to manipulate spin polarization has also been demonstrated recently. In the (F-PEA)2PbI4 thin film, Sum and co-workers demonstrated a room-temperature spin-selective optical Stark effect (OSE).310 They found that the exciton spin states can be selectively tuned by ∼6.3 meV using circularly polarized optical pulses without any external photonic cavity. Their result opens up new avenues for using these 2D perovskites for opto-spin logic applications. In the quasi-2D perovskite systems, the same group recently demonstrated that the ultrafast energy funneling from low-n to high-n perovskites, as shown in LEDs, also preserves their spin information, thus achieving spin funneling in the quasi-2D perovskite films with thickness up to 600 nm.311 Using 2D perovskites for (optical) spin manipulation is an intriguing and exciting research direction; however, the spin lifetime of these systems are generally very short at high temperature. Future research should focus on (1) understanding the structure–Rashba-effect and structure–spin-lifetime correlation, and (2) demonstrating other spintronic devices, such as spin light-emitting diodes and spin valves.


5.2.2. Chiral 2D layered perovskite systems. 
The chemical tunability of 2D perovskites also offers a unique opportunity to directly incorporate chiral organic molecules in between the inorganic layers, introducing chirality into the hybrid framework. Understanding how chirality can affect the Rashba effect, and how their synergetic effects can provide spin-control within this hybrid layered system, may bring new opportunities for spintronic applications. In 2018, Sargent and co-workers reported 3% spin-polarized photoluminescence at zero magnetic fields at 2 K in 2D Pb–Br perovskite multilayers that incorporated chiral organic molecules, suggesting that the spin degree of freedom of hybrid perovskites can be controlled by the chirality of the incorporated organic cations.312 This is subsequently confirmed by Li and co-workers, who reported an average degree of circularly polarized photoluminescence (CPL) of 9.6% and 10.1% at 77 K for (R-MBA)2PbI4 and (S-MBA)2PbI4 (MBA: C6H5CH(CH3)NH3), respectively.313 However, it should be noted that the demonstrated spin-polarized photoluminescence is likely intrinsically limited because the PL emission of n = 1 2D chiral perovskite is rather weak. As such, more direct spin manipulation and associated demonstration in a spintronic device based on chiral perovskites should be both intriguing and insightful.
In a recent study, Lu et al. demonstrated that a polarized spin-transport through 2D chiral hybrid perovskites can be effectively manipulated depending on the handedness of the organic molecules, which occurs via the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) mechanism (Fig. 16).314 Magnetic conductive probe AFM studies showed the highest spin-polarization transport of up to 86%, which is much larger than previously reported in chiral self-assembled monolayer systems (typically in the range of 30% to 50%315–317), as carriers transfer through multiple chiral layers undergoing a spin-polarized tunneling process. Magnetoresistance measurements in spintronics devices further confirm the spin-filtering effect enabled by the chiral organic layers, forming half spin-valve devices based on a single ferromagnetic electrode. The successful demonstration of the CISS effect in these 2D chiral perovskite films opens the door for future spintronic applications based on chiral hybrid materials.

5.3. Photodetector
Compared to 3D perovskites, which have drawn extensive attention for next-generation photodetectors,318–321 the development of 2D perovskites for photodetectors is still in its infancy. Due to the poorly controlled crystalline orientation, phases, and anisotropic transport properties in microcrystalline films, 2D perovskite-based photodetectors usually require the use of single crystals; however, the growth of large-area, high-quality, shape-controlled 2D perovskite single crystals remains a significant challenge. As such, advances in 2D perovskite-based photodetectors is strongly tied to the growth of 2D perovskite single crystals.322 Thus far, surface-tension-driven crystal growth has been shown to be the most effective approach to grow photodetector-quality 2D perovskite single crystals. In 2018, Priya and co-workers reported the growth of quasi-2D perovskite single-crystal membranes based on the surface-tension effect, where the growth rate of the precursor molecules at the water/air interface is much higher than those in bulk solution.248 Their photodetector based on the BA2PbI4 (n = 1) shows a shallow dark current (10−13 A), higher on/off ratio (∼104), and faster response time compared to those with higher n numbers. More recently, Liu and co-workers coupled the inverse temperature crystallization method with surface-tension control to achieve preferential crystallization of 2D perovskite single crystals at the solution/air interfaces.323 Using this method, they were able to obtain high-quality, 36 mm-sized 2D PEA2PbI4 single crystals with a high aspect ratio. Photodetector devices based on different crystal facets, namely (001) and (010), show very different properties. The photodetectors based on the (010) planes show much less photo-response than those based on the (001) planes. Based on the (001) plane, the photodetectors display responsivity as high as 139.6 A W−1, EQE of 37719.6%, detectivity of 1.89 × 1015 Jones, and response speed as fast as τrise = 21 μs and τdecay = 37 μs. Their photodetector performance based on 2D PEA2PbI4 single crystals is so far among the highest reported for all perovskite planar photodetectors.
6. Conclusion and outlook
Since the first application of 2D perovskite absorbers in solar cells in 2014, the best PCE of 2D PSCs has improved to ∼19% to date. This points out the promise of using or incorporating 2D perovskites for solar cells. In addition, 2D perovskites also display tremendous potential in LED, broadband emission, spintronic, and photodetector applications, and they serve as a prototype system to understand many fundamental structure–property relationships including spin–orbital coupling, Rashba effect, exciton–phonon coupling, and light–matter interactions. To further advance or explore the unique characteristics of 2D perovskites for all these applications, more efforts are required to focus on materials design, growth controls, and the fundamental physical and chemical properties of 2D organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites. Below we discuss key scientific challenges as well as our perspective on future research directions for 2D perovskites.
6.1. Phase purity of 2D perovskite thin films
The as-prepared 2D films almost always contain different n values, which presents a challenge to enabling different applications, but also complicates the scientific understanding of various physical and chemical properties of 2D perovskite structures, which, in turn, presents another challenge for tailoring materials design. Thus, it is necessary to develop synthetic tools and controls to obtain pure-phase 2D perovskite structures. Similarly, continued efforts on developing strategies to manipulate the growth orientation of 2D perovskite to either use or avoid the limitation of the anisotropic properties of 2D structures is crucial for the future development of this field.
6.2. Anisotropic charge transport in 2D perovskites
The vastly different charge-transport properties along the out-of-plane and in-plane directions for 2D perovskites will remain an active area of research for various optoelectronic applications. In addition, mixed bulky cations for 2D perovskite also shows promising results that should be pursued.324,325 Accurate description of the crystal structure of 2D perovskites is essential for revealing the role of bulky cations in perovskite formation and charge transport. In addition, a molecular library should be established by investigating the effect of different molecular lengths, conjugated groups, functional units, and the substituent groups on the charge-transfer capacity and other properties.
6.3. Quantum efficiency and stability
PLQY is a key parameter for characterizing the emission properties of 2D perovskites. At present, the PLQY for 2D structures remains low at room temperature because of the fast nonradiative exciton quenching due to the strong exciton–lattice coupling. Strategies in both molecular design and device engineering need to be explored to inhibit the nonradiative recombination in these systems. Meanwhile, a balance between quantum efficiency and stability need to be considered.
6.4. Fundamental structure–property relationships
Given all the observed interesting optical, electronic, and spin properties in 2D perovskites, little is known about the structural origin of these properties at the atomic level. In particular, general correlations between the crystallographic structural characters (e.g., dimensionality, distortions, impurity dopants) and broadband emission, Rashba effect, spin coherent lifetime, and spin polarization still need to be rigorously tested and established. The challenge here stems not only from the difficulties associated with the synthetic output, but also on developing direct, unambiguous characterization methods and theory to probe the optical, electronic, and spin properties. Understanding these key structure–property relationships can further provide synthetic guidance for the next-generation hybrid materials for targeted optoelectronic applications. This is a new, exciting area where synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational tools will be heavily involved, and it provides a tremendous playground and opportunities for chemists, physicists, and engineers to unveil the mystery of hybrid materials.
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that for solar cell applications even if 2D perovskites may not be used as the primary light absorber, these low-dimensional materials can still play important roles to improve the conventional 3D perovskite based photovoltaic devices. More research efforts will likely focus on 2D/3D mixed perovskites, where 2D perovskite can serve as a passivating agent or capping layer for improving the stability and efficiency of devices. At present, as many of these behaviors in these 2D systems have not yet been clearly defined, developing tools to identify/control/study the materials and their properties represents a pressing need for the field. More studies should focus on developing the synthetic control to form a transparent 2D capping layer with controlled energy levels and/or the layer thickness (i.e., n value) of the 2D structures. Design of new bulky organic cations that could form stable 2D structures with enhanced plane-to-plane charge transport along with new ways to control the 2D structure/composition will further advance the performance and stability of 2D/3D PSCs.106,175

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted attention from academia and industry due to its rapid performance advancement. However, the long-term operational stability of PSCs remains an issue. One promising approach involving the use of two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D perovskite has shown potential for improving the stability of PSCs. In addition to solar cell applications, 2D perovskites offer a great playground for chemists to investigate fundamental structure–property relationships. The rich chemical tunability provides unique opportunities to control their structural distortion, quantum and dielectric confinement, exciton–phonon coupling, and Rashba splitting, which, in turn, modulate their optical, electronic, and spin properties. For this reason, 2D perovskites have also shown tremendous potential for photoemission, spintronic, and photodetector applications. Here, we review the recent achievements of 2D perovskites for various optoelectronic applications. First, we discuss the basic structure and optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskites, including band structure, optical properties, and charge transport. We then highlight recent achievements using 2D perovskites in solar cells and beyond solar cells, including progress on various synthesis strategies and their impact on structural and optoelectronic properties. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future opportunities to further develop 2D perovskites for various applications.
