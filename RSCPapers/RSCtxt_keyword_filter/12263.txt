    , Accepted 6th November 2012First published on 7th November 2012AbstractNew spirobisilole molecules containing thienyl (DTSBS) and bis-thienyl (BBTSBS) electron donor groups have been synthesized for use as the donor material in bulk-heterojunction solar cells together with PCBM. The spectroscopic, electrochemical and thermal properties of DTSBS and BBTSBS have been investigated. All these new spirobisiloles exhibit excellent thermal stability. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed reversible and irreversible oxidation and irreversible reduction processes. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) energy levels were determined from electrochemical measurements and DFT calculations. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels were estimated to lie in the range of −5.2 to −2.3 eV for DTSBS and −4.9 to −2.6 eV for BBTSBS. For both compounds, electropolymerization processes occur at potentials higher than 1.5 V leading to low band gap electrogenerated polymers. Spin-coating-deposited bulk-heterojunction solar cells fabricated with the novel spirobisiloles as donor and PCBM as acceptor displayed open-circuit voltages up to 0.4 V, short-circuit currents around 0.5 mA cm−2, and power conversion efficiencies approaching 0.1%.
Introduction
Fossil fuel exhaustion and environmental problems caused by conventional power generation have triggered an intensification of research on renewable energies such as photovoltaic sources, fuel cells, wind generation, etc. In particular, photovoltaic conversion of solar energy is considered to be one of the most significant ways of addressing the growing global energy crisis. To this end, organic solar cells (OSCs) represent a promising candidate for the conversion of solar energy owing to their advantages of easy fabrication, low cost, light weight and flexibility. Different device architectures of OSCs have been developed since the pioneering work of Tang in 1986.1 The most efficient cell design, leading to the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), is the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell.2
The active layer of BHJ solar cells consists of an interpenetrating network of two types of organic materials, an electron donor and an electron acceptor, and is formed through the control of the phase separation between the donor and acceptor parts in the bulk. Accordingly, the large donor–acceptor area can favour charge separation and, hence, increases the conversion efficiency of the cell. For both small molecule and polymer based BHJ solar cells, controlling the microscopic morphology plays an important role in creating domains of donor and acceptor material of optimal dimensions consistent with exciton diffusion while ensuring the transport of holes and electrons without interruption in their respective domains.3,4 At a basic level, control of the blend morphology can be achieved by tailoring the various fabrication methods such as the choice of the solvent, the solvent evaporation rate, the thermal annealing treatment etc. On a deeper level, control consists in modulating the molecular structure of the conjugated molecular materials,5 this being essential as it affects not only the molecular ordering in thin solid films but also the conjugation length, light absorption, carrier mobilities, exciton dynamics and processability. Therefore, to date, much attention has been devoted to the synthesis of new donor and acceptor materials for OSCs applications.
In the fields of both small-molecule and polymer solar cells, an enormous increase in power conversion efficiencies has been achieved in recent years, from under 1% initially to currently over 8.3%.1,6 Recently, a certified PCE of 9.8% has been achieved by a tandem cell manufactured with an oligomer-material low-temperature deposition process. Small conjugated molecules are attractive for OSCs since compared to their polymeric counterparts, they are easier to synthesize and purify, offer higher charge-carrier mobilities than do polymers and, most importantly, avoid the problems posed by batch variations in the case of polymers.5a–c
One strategy for improving OSCs efficiency based on small-molecule donors consists in increasing the dimensionality of the donor molecules through self-assembly to match the intrinsically three-dimensional (3D) character of intermolecular interactions in the fullerene acceptor phase and to ensure 3D hole transport.5a,7 Therefore, the synthesis of conjugated systems possessing a pseudo-3D geometry has been the subject of intense research over the last decade.8 Roncali et al. first reported a tetrahedral molecular donor based on a silicon-centred system exhibiting a PCE of 0.3%.9 Similar donor systems with increased dimensionality based on X-shaped or dendritic oligothiophene have achieved PCE ≈ 1.5%.10
Although these 3D architectures provide motifs for the most isotropic charge-transport properties, the most efficient aggregation can be achieved with two-dimensional (2D) π–π stacking in mutually orthogonal interactions. Such stacking interactions can be obtained from cross-conjugated molecules where the two mutually conjugated backbones connected through a central aromatic core or an sp3-hybridized atom into a spiro configuration undergo self-assembly in the third dimension.7,11 The two perpendicularly-orientated chromophores joined through a C, Si or Ge spiro-centre in cross-conjugated cruciform molecules are usually considered to be independent despite spiro interactions being known.12 Recently, Samuel et al. have exploited this approach for OSC application by using a fused spirobi[(1,3,2)dithiagermole]quinquithiophene system. This Ge cruciform molecule demonstrated an improved mobility and a maximum PCE of 2.26%.7
In this respect, we report the synthesis, thermal, photophysical and electrochemical properties of two spirobisiloles with an increasing number of thienyl units for use in OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, although such compounds have been used as electron transport materials in the construction of electroluminescent devices, they have never been utilized in OSCs.13 Only one example of a photovoltaically active silole has been reported in the literature.14 These new spirobisiloles were then used as donors with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor in BHJ solar cells exhibiting power conversion efficiencies over 0.1%. Our results suggest that spirobisiloles are promising materials for developing efficient solution-processed BHJ solar cells based on small molecules.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of DTSBS and BBTSBS
The two spirobisilole derivatives were synthesized in moderate yield via a one-pot synthesis involving first the intramolecular reductive cyclization of 1,1-bis(phenylethynyl)-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsilole, followed by a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction with the appropriate bromoaryl compound, as shown in Scheme 1.13a
 Scheme 1  
 

DTSBS and BBTSBS were isolated in 30–35% yield as yellow-orange and dark red powders, respectively. The characterization of DTSBS and BBTSBS was achieved by means of elemental analysis and standard spectroscopic techniques (see NMR spectra, Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). The most relevant structural data for these compounds arise from the characteristic downfield shift of the 29Si NMR signal (≈1 ppm), compared with bis(phenylethynyl)-diphenylsilane (−47.9 ppm).13b,15
Thermal stability is of crucial importance for evaluating the suitability of a molecule for photovoltaic applications. Hence, the thermal properties were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under an inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). Both spirobisilole compounds display good thermal stability since the first weight losses upon heating occur at temperatures exceeding 230 °C. In addition, the DSC traces indicate no glass transition for either DTSBS or BBTSBS between 30 °C and the decomposition temperature.
Electronic and luminescence properties in solution
The optical properties of DTSBS and BBTSBS were studied by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy (Table 1). The characteristic absorption spectra of DTSBS and BBTSBS in solution are shown in Fig. 1A (for thin film characteristics, see Fig. S7, ESI†).

 Fig. 1  Absorption and emission spectra of DTSBS and BBTSBS (10−5 M) in CH2Cl2. 

DTSBS and BBTSBS exhibit two and three absorption bands, respectively. The first-absorption band in the 250–300 nm region is ascribed to the π–π* transition of the aromatic groups. Based on previous theoretical and experimental investigation on a 2,5-functional silole, the second and the third broad low-energy absorption bands, for BBTSBS, can be attributed to the electronic transition between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) including a π orbital involving contributions from both the silole ring and the aromatic substituents at the 2,5 positions and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the latter being a pure π* orbital from the silole ring.13a,16 The optical band-gap energies of DTSBS and BBTSBS, estimated from the edge of the absorption spectrum (455 nm for DTSBS and 580 nm for BBTSBS in Fig. 1A) using ΔEopt = hc/λ(nm), are ca. 2.73 and 2.13 eV, respectively.
When irradiated by UV light, both compounds emit both in solution (Fig. 1B) and in the solid state (Fig. S8, ESI†) (Table 1). In order to exclude possible effects of self-absorption, the measurements in solution were performed at low concentration (10−5 M). The emission spectra in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 1B) show broad unstructured bands at λmax at 520 nm and 625 nm for DTSBS and BBTSBS, respectively. Both the absorption and the luminescence maxima of BBTSBS are shifted to longer wavelengths with respect to DTSBS owing to the increased number of the thienyl units.17 The emission quantum efficiency for these two compounds is low in solution (<1%), as is common for silole derivatives.13a,16
To examine the potential aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties of these new spirobisilole derivatives, PL spectra of DTSBS and BBTSBS in THF–water mixtures were measured. Since DTSBS and BBTSBS are insoluble in water, they must have aggregated in THF–water mixtures with increasing water content. Fig. 2A and B shows the photoluminescence decrease with increasing water content. These results clearly indicate that both silole derivatives are AIE-inactive. Tang et al. have proposed that the restriction of the intramolecular rotation (RIR) process accounts for the AIE effect.18 On the basis of the very rigid molecular structure of spirobisilole compounds DTSBS and BBTSBS, we assume that the intramolecular rotation of the phenyl and thiophene is extremely restricted in solution and is not very different from that of aggregates. Such a behaviour for DTSBS and BBTSBS may probably account for their failure to display the AIE effect.

Theoretical calculations
Very few structural studies on spirobisiloles have been reported to date reflecting their very low propensity for crystallization. Both DTSBS and BBTSBS follow this rule. For this reason, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the UB3LYP functional were carried out on these molecules to obtain information about their molecular conformations. Geometry optimizations without symmetry constrains were performed with the 6-31G basis set to the standard convergence criteria as implemented in Gaussian 03.19 Such calculations were followed by single point runs using a 6-31+G* basis with tight convergence and the ultrafine integration grid in order to obtain accurate energies. Prior to analysis, the methodology was tested using the crystallographically characterized octaphenyl-1,1′-spirobisilole (OPSBS)20 and 2,5-dithienylsiloles (DTS and BBTS)21 to verify if the optimized geometry is in good agreement with the X-ray data (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  
 
The optimized structures of both DTSBS and BBTSBS exhibit the previously observed anti-coplanar arrangement of the 2,5-dithiophene or bis-bithienyl moieties to the central silole ring.21 The twist angles between the two thienyl mean planes and the silole mean plane are 5.9° for DTSBS and 3.9° for BBTSBS, respectively. The overall structures are very close to that of the parent octaphenyl-1,1′-spirobisilole (OPSBS) with a nearly perfect perpendicular arrangement between the adjacent silole rings.20 The energy diagrams of the frontier orbitals shown in Fig. 3 summarize the results obtained for single point DFT calculations performed on optimized geometries as described above for a series of relevant silole derivatives (see also Fig. S11, ESI†). For the siloles TPS, DTS, BBTS and for the spirobisilole OPSBS, only HOMO and LUMO orbital energy levels are shown. For the spirobisiloles DTSBS and BBTSBS, the HOMO − 1 and LUMO + 1 energy levels are also shown in addition to those of the HOMO and LUMO. As reported elsewhere, the electronic perturbation afforded by the substituents located at the 2,5-positions has a pronounced effect on both the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels.22 For instance, replacement of the phenyls (TPS) by electron-rich thienyl (DTS) or bis-thienyl (BBTS) groups leads to both a substantial decrease of the LUMO level and an increase in the HOMO level. These changes also reflect the fact that the replacement of a benzene ring by the less sterically hindering thiophene ring gives rise to a more planar conformation of the conjugated backbone. The same trend is also observed when OPSBS, DTSBS and BBTSBS are compared. Also of interest is the comparison of the LUMO + 1, LUMO, HOMO and HOMO − 1 energy levels of DTSBS and BBTSBS with the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of OPSBS, DTS and BBTS: the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of DTSBS are close to those of DTS whereas the (HOMO + 1)–(LUMO − 1) energy levels are close to those of OPSBS (being in the range of those calculated for TPS). The same effect is observed for BBTSBS.

The orbital plots (Fig. 4) for BBTSBS are typical for the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of siloles, i.e. the LUMO of the silole ring displays typical σ(Si–Cexocyclic)*–π(butadiene)* hyperconjugation responsible for its remarkable electronic properties.22,23

As can be seen in Fig. 4, the HOMO spreads over the π-system bearing the bis-thienyl moieties, whereas the HOMO − 1 spreads over the orthogonal π-system (see also Fig. S17, ESI†), thus indicating that there is no mixing between these frontier orbitals. This is in contrast to the parent OPSBS (see inset Fig. 4) and other symmetric spirobisiloles in which the orbital clouds spread in a symmetrical fashion over the two rings (Fig. S11 and S13, ESI†).23 Looking now at the LUMO (Fig. S14, ESI†), the orbital mainly spreads over the silole bearing the bis-thienyl moieties, but in this case, since the σ(Si–Corthogonal silole)* orbital is involved in the LUMO (see above), a small part of the cloud is also present on the orthogonal silole ring. The reverse of this situation is also encountered for the LUMO + 1. Therefore, the two rings interact with each other through mutual σ(Si–Corthogonal silole)*–π(butadiene) hyperconjugation in the LUMO and LUMO + 1 orbitals.
Finally, the question of the existence of spiroconjugation in both DTSBS and BBTSBS is discussed. Spiroconjugation in spiro-connected π-systems may occur when the frontier orbitals of the fragments with the correct symmetry interact with each other to form two spiroconjugated orbitals (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†).23–25 If the spiroconjugation is the result of a HOMO–HOMO interaction, a slight increase of the HOMO energy of the spiro molecule is thus observed in comparison to the energy the HOMO of the constitutive fragments. On the other hand, if the spiroconjugation is the result of a LUMO–LUMO interaction, a slight decrease in the LUMO energy of the spiro molecule is observed. Since no mixing is expected for the LUMO orbitals without the correct symmetry, only HOMO–HOMO spiroconjugation is encountered for the symmetric spirobisiloles OPSBS and TTSBS (Fig. S11, ESI†) where the effective mixing of the HOMO yields spiroconjugated orbitals spanning the entire molecule. On the contrary, such spiroconjugation is not observed in either DTSBS or BBTSBS since there is no mixing of the π-orbitals located on the two orthogonal rings either in the HOMO or HOMO − 1 levels. This may originate from the very large energy difference between the HOMO levels of the constitutive fragments.
In summary, theoretical calculations showed definitely that because of a great energy difference between the frontier orbitals of each half of the spirobisiloles, spiroconjugation occurs neither in DTSBS nor in BBTSBS. From this point of view, they may be described as being independent of each other rather than electronically coupled. However, since the two rings interact with each other through mutual σ(Si–Corthogonal silole)*–π(butadiene) hyperconjugation one cannot exclude communication between the two halves.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of DTSBS and BBTSBS were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The first oxidation of DTSBS is irreversible, (see inset of Fig. 5A) and occurs with a maximum at 1.0 V. This first oxidation is followed at higher potentials by at least five ill-defined irreversible processes. The electrochemical behaviour of BBTSBS (Fig. 5B) is different from that of DTSBS as its oxidation occurs first through three reversible oxidations with maxima at 0.75, 0.9 and 1.15 V (see inset of Fig. 5B) followed by two irreversible oxidation waves. The onset oxidation potential (Eoxonset) was observed at 0.88 V and 0.61 V for DTSBS and BBTSBS, respectively. The 150 mV shift to a lower anodic value of Eoxonset for BBTSBS is in accordance with the more extended conjugation in BBTSBS compared to DTSBS. The intensities of the different oxidation waves have been compared using DPV for both compounds (Fig. S15, ESI†). For DTSBS, the three first oxidation waves are in the ratio 1e−/2e−/3e− whereas the oxidation of BBTSBS occurs through three successive one-electron processes followed by a third two electron oxidation. It should be noted that for both compounds oxidation at potentials higher than 1.5 V leads to the electrode being covered by insoluble deposits resulting from an electropolymerization process. Reduction of both compounds gives two irreversible reduction waves with maxima around −2.0 and −2.3 V for DTSBS and −1.65 and −2.1 V for BBTSBS (Fig. S16, ESI†). The onset reduction potentials (Eredonset) occur at −1.8 V for DTSBS and at −1.55 V for BBTSBS. The 250 mV shift towards less cathodic potentials for BBTSBSEredonset is also in accordance with the more extended conjugation in BBTSBS compared to DTSBS.

Insets show zooms of the first oxidation process in (A) and of the three first oxidation processes in (B). Working electrode: 1 mm diameter Pt disk, sweep-rate: 100 mV s−1. 
From the redox data, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level can be estimated. The value of Eoxonset gives a HOMO level energy of −5.28 eV for DTSBS (DFT calculations: −5.21 eV) and −5.01 eV (DFT calculations: −4.94 eV) for BBTSBS. The LUMO energy levels of DTSBS and BBTSBS have also been calculated from Eredonset to be −2.6 eV and −2.85 eV respectively (DFT calculations: −2.31 eV and −2.61 eV, respectively). The electrochemical bandgaps (ΔEel) for both compounds were calculated from the HOMO and LUMO levels to be 2.68 eV for DTSBS and 2.16 eV for BBTSBS. These ΔEel values are in accordance with the optical bandgaps (ΔEopt = 2.73 eV for DTSBS and 2.13 eV for BBTSBS) determined previously. The difference between the two ΔEel values (0.52 eV) is also in good agreement with the 0.56 eV difference observed between the theoretical bandgaps (ΔEtheo) (ΔEtheo = 2.89 eV for DTSBS and 2.33 eV for BBTSBS, see Fig. 3). The physicochemical properties of a series of 2,5-diarylsiloles, in particular those of 1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenyl-2,5-di(2-thienyl)silole (DTS) and 1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenyl-2,5-bis[5-(2-thienyl)-2-thienyl]silole (BBTS), these being half parts of DTSBS and BBTSBS, have been reported by Tamao et al.22 The oxidation and reduction potentials of DTS are less anodic and less cathodic than those of BBTS owing to the extended conjugation with increasing numbers of thienyl units in the main aromatic skeleton. The shift of the oxidation (−90 mV) and the reduction (+170 mV) potentials from DTS to BBTS were however smaller than those observed in the present study (−250 mV for oxidation and +350 mV for reduction). This electronic effect may be perhaps amplified by the presence of the second aromatic unit in the case of BBTSBS and DTSBS. As shown from the theoretical calculations (see above), this electronic effect may be the result of the mutual σ(Si–Corthogonal silole)*–π(butadiene) hyperconjugation between the silole rings present in BBTSBS and DTSBS.
Polymerization process
As presented in the previous section, oxidation of BBTSBS and DTSBS occurs through successive oxidation processes and, for both compounds, oxidation at potentials higher than 1.5 V gives rise to an electropolymerization process. Fig. 6A and B presents the evolution of the CVs recorded for BBTSBS and DTSBS oxidation performed with recurrent sweeps between −0.5 and 1.56 or 1.50 V, respectively.

Inset in (A) and (B), the working electrode is a platinum disk (d) 1 mm coated by poly(BBTSBS) or poly(DTSBS) prepared in (A) and (B), respectively, and the solution is free of monomer. (C) Comparison of the p-doping processes of poly(BBTSBS) and poly(DTSBS) in solutions free of monomer. Sweep-rate: 100 mV s−1. 
In each case, large increases in the oxidation and reduction currents are observed indicating the deposition of insoluble electroactive poly(BBTSBS) and poly(DTSBS) on the platinum surfaces. Both films are insoluble in common solvents (CH2Cl2, THF, DMF, acetone, acetonitrile, MeOH). The modified electrodes rinsed with CH2Cl2 and studied by CV in monomer-free solution demonstrate the electrochemical behaviour of the electrogenerated polymers showing in the anodic range (inset, Fig. 6A and B) a p-doping process with very good reversibility. The onset oxidation potentials of the polymers (Fig. 6C) are recorded at 36 mV and 166 mV for poly(BBTSBS) and poly(DTSBS) cathodically shifted by 575 and 714 mV, respectively, when compared to the onset oxidation potentials of their parent monomers (Eoxonset: 0.61 and 0.88 V, respectively, insets, Fig. 5A and B). The large shift suggests a longer conjugation pathway in the polymer than in the monomer. Both polymers can also be obtained by oxidation at a fixed potential, the best value being determined by chronoamperometry. In the cathodic direction (Fig. S17, ESI†), the polymers do not present any reversible n-doping processes, their reductions starting at −1.61 and −1.85 V respectively. These polymer reduction potentials are only slightly shifted towards cathodic potentials compared to their respective monomers (Eredonset: −1.55 and −1.8 V, Fig. S16, ESI†).
Despite the absence of a reversible n-doping process, the electroactivity of both polymers remains stable even after cathodic explorations. The presence of the thienyl or dithienyl units in DTSBS and BBTSBS may offer an explanation for the polymerization process. In fact, one of the most versatile routes toward π-conjugated polymers involves the electropolymerization of thienyl units via an oxidation process involving coupling of radical cations.
The oxidation of the phenyl units occur at higher potential values than the oxidation of the thienyl or dithienyl units, the polymerization processes may be assigned essentially to thienyl–thienyl couplings leading to the polymers depicted as in Fig. 6C.26,27 The HOMO and LUMO levels of the two polymers were calculated from their respective oxidation and reduction threshold potentials. For poly(DTSBS), the HOMO (−4.44 eV) and LUMO (−2.55 eV) values give an electrochemical bandgap of 1.89 eV and for poly(BBTSBS), the HOMO of −4.57 eV and the LUMO of −2.79 eV give a bandgap of 1.77 eV. Due to their relatively low bandgaps, these electrogenerated polymers may be of interest in bulk heterojunction solar cells with the appropriate acceptor.28 UV-visible spectra of the polymers electrodeposited on a transparent ITO glass electrode show that they absorb light throughout the wavelength range between 300 and 1000 nm (Fig. S18, ESI†). Moreover, both polymers also present interesting electrochromic properties, depicted for poly(BBTSBS) in Fig. S18 (ESI†). For example, poly(BBTSBS) is pink in its neutral and slightly p-doped state whereas it appears blue in its higher p-doped state exhibiting evolution of its absorbance spectrum with progressive oxidation (Fig. S18, ESI†).
Photovoltaic properties
The BBTSBS and DTSBS were used as electron-donor materials in bulk-heterojunction solar cells with [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron acceptor. The cells were prepared by spin-coating a solution (3% w/v) of DTSBS or BBTSBS and PCBM onto an ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate. The thickness of the blended film was found to be ≈100 nm. A 100 nm thick Al electrode was then evaporated inside the glove-box for both geometries. The blend ratio of donor to acceptor was 1:1 by weight. Fig. 7 and 8 show the J–V characteristics of bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) DTSBS and BBTSBS based solar cells.

A thermal treatment has been carried out in order to control the phase separation of the blend. Fig. 7 shows the photovoltaic characteristics of bulk hetero-junctions solar cells based on DTSBS and PCBM annealed at different temperatures for 20 minutes. It can be seen that the open circuit voltage (VOC) increases and the short-circuit current (JSC) decreases as the annealing temperature increases (Table 2).

The optimum annealing temperature has been found to be 140 °C for 20 minutes. The increased VOC is due to the reduced recombination rate. The low fill factor values are related to a very high series resistance, which prevents charge collection at the electrodes. Leakage currents are also high as evidenced by the low on/off ratio of dark current which also contributes to lowering VOC. The decrease in fill factor and JSC are observed because of crystallization of PCBM which reduces the effective active area of the solar cell.

Fig. 8 shows the photovoltaic characteristics of bulk hetero-junctions solar cells based on BBTSBS and PCBM annealed at different annealed temperatures for 20 minutes. It can be seen that the open circuit voltage (VOC) and the short-circuit current (JSC) decrease as the annealing temperature increases (Table 3). The optimum annealing temperature was found to be 120 °C for 20 minutes. The high series resistance prevents efficient charge collection due to recombination and implies a low fill factor. These materials are promising for photovoltaic applications since they exhibit high VOC in the case of BBTSBS:PCBM and high repeatability for DTSBS:PCBM. However, charge collection is not efficient and progresses should be made in controlling the phase separation of the blend.

Both low current and high series resistances indicate that numerous dead ends are present rather than a continuous interpenetrated network. The mobility of DTSBS and BBTSBS has been extracted from dark currents according to the space charged limited current (SCLC) model (Tables 4 and 5.29

The low mobility observed in the two materials is consistent with the relatively low efficiency of the solar cells and has to be enhanced in order to balance the electron mobility in PCBM as has recently been demonstrated in the well-known P3HT–PCBM blend.30
Conclusion
In summary, we have prepared spirobisiloles containing thienyl (DTSBS) and bis-thienyl (BBTSBS) substituents for small-organic solar cells. The structures and purity were fully characterized by NMR, mass and elemental analysis. All these new organic materials exhibit excellent thermal stability. On the basis of theoretical calculations, spiroconjugation occurs neither in DTSBS nor in BBTSBS owing to a large energy difference between the frontier orbitals of each half of the spirobisiloles. However, since the two rings interact with each other through mutual σ(Si–Corthogonal silole)*–π(butadiene) hyperconjugation, communication between the two halves certainly takes place. Appropriate positions of their HOMO and LUMO levels make possible their use in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells with PC60BM as the electron acceptor component. Preliminary results leading to modest power conversion efficiencies of ∼0.1% have been determined for the devices obtained by spin-coating. Further improvements of the devices based on these materials could include optimization of the film as well as the choice of other solvents during the deposition process.
The electrochemical properties of these new materials also revealed for both compounds the occurrence of electropolymerization processes leading to low band gap (1.89 eV and 1.77 eV for poly(DTSBS) and poly(BBTSBS) respectively) electrogenerated polymers. These polymers exhibit wide absorption spectra covering the wavelength range between 300 and 1000 nm. Owing to these interesting properties, poly(DTSBS) and poly(BBTSBS) may be of interest in bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells with the appropriate acceptor. The study of their physicochemical properties is in progress and will be reported shortly.
Experimental
Materials
All reactions were carried out under argon using standard high vacuum and Schlenk techniques. 5-Bromo-2,2′-bithiophene and bis(phenylethynyl)-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsilole were prepared according to literature methods.31,32 2-Bromothiophene (Acros, 98%) was used without further purification. Solvents were dried and distilled just before use.
General procedure for the synthesis of DTSBS and BBTSBS
A mixture of lithium (6.6 mmol) and naphthalene (6.6 mmol) in 5 mL of THF was stirred at room temperature under argon for 4 h giving a deep dark-green solution of lithium naphthalenide. A solution of bis(phenylethynyl)-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsilole (1.7 mmol) in 10 mL of THF was added dropwise to the solution of lithium naphthalenide for 2 min at room temperature. After being stirred for 5 min, the mixture was cooled to 0 °C and ZnCl2·tmeda (6.6 mmol) was added at 0 °C, followed by dilution with 10 mL of THF. The resulting black suspension was stirred for one additional hour at room temperature. Then, a solution of the bromoaryl compound (Ar–Br, Ar = thiophene or bithiophene) (3.3 mmol) in 5 mL of THF and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (0.05 mmol) was added. The mixture was refluxed for 18 h. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, an aqueous solution (100 mL) of 1 M HCl was added and the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined extracts were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using dichloromethane/pentane (1:9) as an eluent affording DTSBS and BBTSBS as orange and red solids, respectively.

Characterization methods
The 1H, 13C{1H} and 29Si{1H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Advance 200 DPX spectrometer. All the chemical shifts and coupling constants are reported in ppm and Hz, respectively. Abbreviations for 1H NMR spectra used are as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; m, multiplet. UV-visible spectra in solution were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer in quartz cells and CH2Cl2 was used as the solvent. Absorption spectra of DTSBS and BBTSBS in the solid state were measured on a SAFAS UV MC2 spectrophotometer following their evaporation onto sapphire substrates. High resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Q-Tof Waters 2001 MS instrument. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out on a TA Instruments Q500 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flow of nitrogen, using Pt crucibles and 10 mg of sample for each analysis. Elemental analyses were determined with a Thermofinigane Flash EA 1112 instrument. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) were recorded with a SPEX Fluorolog spectrometer. All electrochemical experiments were performed under an argon atmosphere, using a Pt disk electrode (diameter 1 mm), the counter electrode was a vitreous carbon rod and the reference electrode was a silver wire in a 0.1 M AgNO3 solution in CH3CN. Ferrocene was added to the electrolyte solution at the end of a series of experiments. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple served as the internal standard. The three electrode cell was connected to a PAR Model 273 potentiostat/galvanostat (PAR, EG&G, USA) monitored with the ECHEM Software. Activated Al2O3 was added to the electrolytic solution to remove excess moisture. All potentials are referred to the SCE electrode that was calibrated at −0.405 V vs. the Fc/Fc+ system. Preparative separations were performed by silica gel flash column chromatography (Baeckeroot-Labo 60 M).
Photovoltaic device fabrication
Bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on spirobisilole (DTSBS, BBTSBS) compounds and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl esters (PCBM) (Aldrich, 99.5%) were fabricated from their blended solution (1:1, 20 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene by spin-coating on a poly-[ethylenedioxythiophene]:poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) (≈50 nm) coated ITO glass substrate. The ITO substrate contains four devices of each compound with an area of ca. 8.5 mm2 and has an overall size of 1.5 cm × 1 cm. To investigate the effects of annealing on the photovoltaic performance, unannealed and annealed devices before and after deposition of aluminum electrodes were prepared. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source meter under an AM1.5 G solar simulator calibrated at 100 mW cm−2 using a radiometer (IL 1400BL).
