    , Accepted 29th March 2019First published on 29th March 2019AbstractThe inevitable energy loss (Eloss) in organic solar cells (OSCs) makes it a challenge to simultaneously enhance the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC). Herein, we designed and synthesized an asymmetrical non-fullerene small molecule acceptor (SMA), namely a-BTTIC, with a novel eight-fused ladder-type donor unit. Compared to its symmetrical analogue (BTTIC), a-BTTIC shows a red-shifted absorption (by over 20 nm) and an elevated LUMO level (by 0.07 eV), which was beneficial for boosting VOC and JSC concurrently. As a result, OSCs based on a-BTTIC achieved higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 13.60% with simultaneously increased VOC and JSC and a significantly lower Eloss of 0.526 eV than the BTTIC-based OSCs. We noted that the 13.60% PCE and the 0.526 eV Eloss were the best values among OSCs based on commercialized PBDB-T. Through various electrical and morphological characterizations, we observed that the simultaneous enhancement of VOC and JSC in a-BTTIC-based OSCs was attributed to the different molecular conformations and the small change in LUMO level from neutral to ion state of asymmetrical SMAs. Overall, our design route for asymmetrical SMAs serves the dual roles of minimizing the Eloss and promoting the PCE. These results shed light on how to further reduce Eloss for high-performance OSCs with Eloss below 0.6 eV, which thus provides a promising molecular design strategy for further PCE breakthroughs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) consisting of both an electron donating material (donor) and an electron accepting material (acceptor) have shown great application prospects due to their ability to be fabricated into large-area, light-weight and flexible photovoltaic panels using cost-effective solution-processing methods.1–6 The past two decades have witnessed a rapid development in the field of OSCs owing to the great contributions coming from the innovation of materials, device optimization and interface engineering.7–17 With the majority of research focused on the donor polymer design, relatively less attention has been paid on the acceptor side, which plays an equally important role in regulating the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of OSCs.18 However, the dominant acceptors, i.e., fullerene derivatives (e.g., [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM/PC71BM) possess inherent limitations, such as weak absorption, limited energy level variability and poor structural tenability, which are forcing researchers to look for efficient alternatives.19 Recently, emerging as a new dawn, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type small molecule acceptors (SMAs), featuring an electron-rich core flanked with two electron-deficient groups, have caught a wide range of interests and have made breakthroughs in non-fullerene OSCs.20–23 Merits of such molecules lie in their modifiable structures, which allow the precise optimization of the absorption,24–29 the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels30–32 and the crystallization/aggregation properties.33–39
Despite the great advances made in non-fullerene OSCs, one issue that still remains and may become the bottleneck for further PCE enhancement is a large JSC, which is usually accompanied by a low VOC or vice versa.20,24,25,28–32 For example, when designing new SMAs, adding an electron-rich alkoxy group, incorporating thiophene into the ladder-type core, or halogenating (F, Cl, Br, and I) the end groups all result in a red-shifted absorption spectrum for the SMA, but the concurrent effect is a reduced LUMO level compared to an unadorned precursor, which leads to an enhanced JSC but a decreased VOC for the resultant OSCs.24–26,28,29,31 In worst cases, even a lower JSC can be observed due to the poor bulk-heterojunction morphology. On the contrary, the end groups of SMAs modified with electron-donating units, such as methyl and methoxyl, typically narrow the absorption range and enhance the LUMO energy levels of the corresponding SMAs, causing an elevated VOC but a decreased JSC.30,32 From an energetics point of view, the seemingly inevitable current–voltage trade-off could be reduced by uplifting the LUMO energy level while reducing the bandgap of the non-fullerene SMAs. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of an appropriate molecular design strategy to address this issue.
Our group has been focusing on exploring asymmetrical SMAs by designing and synthesizing asymmetrical ladder-type donor units. We have studied different properties of asymmetrical SMAs by comparing them to their symmetrical counterparts.35,40–44 Our previous studies have revealed an interesting phenomenon where the large intrinsic dipole moments of asymmetrical SMAs could induce the intermolecular dipole–dipole interaction and the antiparallel molecule arrangement. This enhanced the π–π stacking of the molecules, leading to not only a more optimized micromorphology but also an enhanced charge carrier mobility, and thus a high FF in OSCs.
On the basis of these beneficial effects, herein, we showed the design and synthesis of a novel asymmetrical core with an eight-fused ring system. By incorporating one thiophene into BTTIC, a-BTTIC (asymmetrical SMA) exhibited an extended asymmetrical coplanar backbone and a large dipole moment of up to 7.88 debye (D). Interestingly, a-BTTIC (with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.43 eV) showed an over 20 nm red-shifted absorption, while showing a 0.07 eV increase in the LUMO energy level relative to BTTIC. As a result, OSCs based on PBDB-T:a-BTTIC realized a PCE as high as 13.60% with a VOC of 0.904 V, a JSC of 20.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74%, which were higher than those for PBDB-T:BTTIC-based OSCs. It should be noted that 13.60% is the highest PCE for OSCs based on commercialized polymer PBDB-T. In addition, a small Eloss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVOC) of 0.526 eV was observed in the PBDB-T:a-BTTIC device. The successfully promoted PCE by further reducing the Eloss was another breakthrough in non-fullerene OSCs, as it is typically considered extremely challenging to further boost the PCE by minimizing Eloss in OSCs with a <0.6 eV Eloss, indicating the great potential of this kind of SMAs. Through electrical and morphological characterizations, the simultaneous enhancement of VOC and JSC in a-BTTIC-based OSCs was mainly explained by the different molecular conformation and the small changes in the LUMO level from the neutral to ion state of asymmetrical SMAs. Moreover, the favorable π–π stacking, phase separation and morphology of PBDB-T:a-BTTIC blend films promoted (and balance) the electron and hole mobilities, increased the exciton dissociation efficiency, and reduced the bimolecular recombination as compared to PBDB-T:BTTIC. Overall, the performance of the asymmetrical SMA demonstrated the effectiveness of our design strategy for simultaneously enhancing VOC and JSC, shedding light on the further improvement of the PCE for high-performance non-fullerene OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The detailed synthetic route and molecular structure of the asymmetrical SMAs (a-BTTIC) are depicted in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  The synthetic routes and molecular structures of BTTIC and a-BTTIC. 
In order to effectively obtain the target product, a one-pot stepwise cross-coupling method was employed through controlling the dropping speed, the order of reactants (ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate and ethyl 2-bromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3-carboxylate) and the reacting time of the mixture. It is worth mentioning that this method can be developed into a general method for synthesizing asymmetrical molecules. The key intermediate (compound 2) was purified by an automatic column machine because of the similar polarities between compound 2 and the other two by-products. Then, the double nucleophilic addition reaction was performed by using excessive Grignard reagent ((4-hexylphenyl)magnesium bromide), and the ester groups of compound 2 were turned into hydroxyls, which were subjected to an acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction to produce compound 3. Subsequently, two formyl groups were successfully introduced into compound 3 with a high yield, which was followed by an end-capping step with 2-(1-methyl-6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CPTCN-M)45 to receive the target molecule a-BTTIC. The controlled SMA (BTTIC) was also synthesized under the same conditions. Two 2-ethylhexyl and four n-hexyl groups endowed the a-BTTIC with a good solubility in common solvents, which meets the essential requirements for solution processing.
2.2. Absorption and energy levels
The absorption spectra of BTTIC and a-BTTIC in chloroform solution and neat films were measured and shown in Fig. 1a. In the dilute solution, both BTTIC and a-BTTIC exhibited a strong and wide absorption ranging from 500 nm to 800 nm with maximum absorption peaks located at 714 nm and 732 nm and molar absorption coefficients being 2.45 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 2.56 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. From solution to solid state, large red-shifts are observed and strong electronic vibration shoulder peaks are formed, suggesting strong intermolecular stacking in their neat films. The absorption edges of BTTIC and a-BTTIC thin films were estimated to be 842 nm and 865 nm, corresponding to the Eoptgs of 1.47 eV and 1.43 eV, respectively (Table 1). Fig. 1b shows the plots of cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements for BTTIC and a-BTTIC. By calculating the CV curves, the LUMOs/HOMOs of BTTIC and a-BTTIC were determined to be −3.90 eV/−5.51 eV and −3.83 eV/−5.45 eV, respectively (Table 1). Obviously, incorporating one thiophene into the core of BTTIC to construct asymmetrical a-BTTIC not only enlarged the absorption range by over 20 nm but also elevated the LUMO level by 0.07 eV, which is a prerequisite for achieving simultaneous enhancements of VOC and JSC.

2.3. DFT calculations
To clarify this abnormal phenomenon that occurred in asymmetrical SMAs, density functional theory (DFT) simulations on BTTIC and a-BTTIC were performed, where the long alkyl chains were simplified to methyl groups. The calculation results revealed that there was not only one stable configuration for BTTIC but two possible stable configurations (a-BTTIC-C1 and a-BTTIC-C2) for a-BTTIC (Fig. S1†), which was a significant difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical SMAs. The optimal geometrical configuration of BTTIC was obtained when the two end groups were distributed on both sides of the long axis of the molecule with intramolecular O–S interactions. In contrast, incorporating one thiophene into the core of BTTIC only changed the configuration of the corresponding side (end group linking to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) with the dicyano group facing down (a-BTTIC-C1) or facing up (a-BTTIC-C2). The steric hindrance effect of the dicyano group caused a large dihedral angle between the donor core and the end group in a-BTTIC-C2, which interrupted the conjugation of one of the “wings” of the molecule to a certain extent and resulted in a bad electron supplementation from the ladder-type core to CPTCN-M, leading to a remarkable promotion of the LUMO energy level of a-BTTIC-C2 as compared to BTTIC. It can also be clearly observed that the LUMO distribution of a-BTTIC-C2 migrated towards the right side of the molecule (CPTCN-M) and mainly concentrated on the right side (Fig. S2†). The calculated LUMOs/HOMOs for BTTIC, a-BTTIC-C1 and a-BTTIC-C2 were −3.543 eV/−5.547 eV, −3.544 eV/−5.496 eV and −3.520 eV/−5.446 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy level of a-BTTIC-C1 was same as that of BTTIC, while that of a-BTTIC-C2 was significantly higher, revealing that the asymmetry of the molecule (a-BTTIC) upshifted the LUMO energy level as compared to the symmetrical molecule (BTTIC) in this calculation level. Furthermore, we also investigated the charge density difference (CDD) of electronic exciton to predict the absorption of BTTIC and a-BTTIC (Fig. S3†). The calculated maximum absorption peaks were 690.8 nm for BTTIC, 711.6 nm for a-BTTIC-C1 and 727.6 nm for a-BTTIC-C2. It can be concluded that a-BTTIC-C2 had a great contribution in simultaneously enhancing the LUMO energy level and broadening the absorption. Moreover, to further illuminate this issue, we studied the variation of energy levels when BTTIC and a-BTTIC were charged, i.e., SMAs changed from neutral to ion state. The LUMOs/HOMOs of BTTIC and a-BTTIC-C1 with a positive charge were −3.520 eV/−5.375 eV and −3.520 eV/−5.320 eV, corresponding to the bandgaps (Eg) of 1.855 eV and 1.800 eV. Similarly, the LUMOs/HOMOs of the SMAs with a negative charge were −3.708 eV/−5.572 eV (Eg of 1.864 eV) for BTTIC and −3.695 eV/−5.523 eV (Eg of 1.828 eV) for a-BTTIC-C1, showing that a-BTTIC possessed a higher LUMO energy level and a narrower Eg than BTTIC in the ionic state. It should be mentioned that the smaller change in the Eg value of a-BTTIC-C1 compared to BTTIC from neutral (Eg of 2.003 eV for BTTIC and Eg of 1.925 eV for a-BTTIC-C1) to ion state indicated a more rigid structure of a-BTTIC, which was beneficial for reducing the intermolecular recombination energy and facilitated the charge transport. Through theoretical calculations, we have found that the diverse configurations of asymmetrical molecules promoted the simultaneous increase in the absorption range and the LUMO level of asymmetrical SMAs.
2.4. Photovoltaic performance
A series of OSCs with a device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-T:acceptor (BTTIC or a-BTTIC)/zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac)/Al were fabricated to test the photovoltaic performance of both the symmetrical and the asymmetrical SMAs. A wide-bandgap polymer PBDB-T was selected as the p-type electron donor due to its appropriate LUMO/HOMO energy levels and complementary absorption profile.46 A simple ZrAcac layer was employed as the cathode interfacial layer (CIL).47 Chloroform was utilized as the processing solvent, considering its good solubility for PBDB-T and the two SMAs. In addition, the volatility of chloroform could facilitate the crystallization process, which was beneficial for the formation of a favorable morphology. The total concentration was 16 mg mL−1 with a 1:1 D:A weight ratio and the optimal OSCs were realized by adding 0.25% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) during solution preparation and annealing at 100 °C after film formation. The details of the device fabrication process can be found in the ESI.† The best-performing current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the two SMA-based OSCs and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively, and the key photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Asymmetrical a-BTTIC-based OSCs achieved a PCE as high as 13.60% along with a VOC of 0.904 V, a JSC of 20.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.0%, while OSCs based on the symmetrical BTTIC yielded a lower PCE of 12.86% with three lower parameters (a VOC of 0.895 V, a JSC of 19.45 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.8%). By designing asymmetrical SMAs, we successfully achieved a simultaneous enhancement in VOC and JSC and a slightly promoted FF in OSCs. Such results were originated from the unique merits of the asymmetrical SMAs and were the most straightforward way for the PCE (PCE = VOC × JSC × FF) improvement. The consistency of the device was confirmed by calculating the average values and mean square errors of PCEs from 30 devices (Tables S1†), which were 13.26% ± 0.25% and 12.61% ± 0.17% for PBDB-T:a-BTTIC- and PBDB-T:BTTIC-based OSCs, respectively. The EQE spectrum of the PBDB-T:a-BTTIC-based device is similar to that of the PBDB-T:BTTIC-based one in the range of 300 nm to 670 nm but the EQE values were remarkably higher (with maximum EQE value of up to 78%) and wider in the range of 670 nm to 870 nm, which was majorly responsible for the enhanced JSC. The EQE-integrated JSCs of OSCs based on PBDB-T:a-BTTIC and PBDB-T:BTTIC were 20.07 mA cm−2 and 18.95 mA cm−2, respectively, which were consistent with the measured JSC with a mismatching factor of only ∼2%.

2.5. Energy loss
As described by the Shockley–Queisser model, the maximum PCE of an OSC is related to the Egs of the used photoactive materials and the Eloss of the cell. Assuming an EQE of 80% and a FF of 75%, we drew the contour map of the calculated PCE versus Eg and Eloss to predict the maximal possible PCEs of OSCs in a system when Eg and Eloss were given (Fig. 3a). As shown in the Figure, if the Eloss can be adjusted to 0.6 eV with a material's Eg being 1.4–1.6 eV, the PCE of OSCs may surpass 15% (point A, Fig. 3a). It is not difficult to find that it is impossible to break the PCE limit by regulating the Eg of the materials when the Eloss of the system is constant. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the Eloss to make further PCE breakthroughs. The PCE dependence on Eloss based on 50 samples with PCEs higher than 10% is shown in Fig. 3b. Obviously, a majority of the high-performance OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors are concentrated on the region with Eloss ranging from 0.6 eV to 0.7 eV, and a few of them achieved over 13% PCE through optimizing polymer donors and devices. Moreover, almost no sample could achieve a more than 13% PCE when the Eloss of OSCs was below 0.6 eV, and the lower the Eloss, the worse the efficiencies. It seemed to be a great challenge to improve the PCEs of OSCs by reducing the Eloss. a-BTTIC with an Eoptg of 1.43 eV achieved an Eloss of 0.526 eV and a high PCE of 13.60% when blended with PBDB-T, superior to BTTIC (an Eoptg of 1.47 eV and a PCE of 12.86% with an Eloss of 0.575 eV). Designing asymmetrical SMAs not only minimizes the Eloss to a lower degree by simultaneously reducing Eoptg and enhancing VOC but also successfully promoting the PCE by reducing Eloss of OSCs when Eloss is below 0.6 eV. Actually, OSCs using PBDB-T as the donor, it is hard to acquire an Eloss lower than 0.6 eV and an over 13% PCE, which can be clearly observed from Fig. 3c. We noted that a 13.60% PCE and a 0.526 eV Eloss were the best values among OSCs based on commercialized PBDB-T. In turn, a Eloss of 0.526 eV combining with a Eg of 1.43 eV portends a possible PCE limit of over 16% (point B), as shown in Fig. 3a, indicating an enormous potential of a-BTTIC.

2.6. Device characterization
To study the difference in charge transport between symmetrical and asymmetrical SMAs, the carrier mobilities of BTTIC and a-BTTIC in pure and blended films were measured by fabricating the electron-only (ITO/ZnO/active layer/ZrAcac/Al) and hole-only (ITO/MoOx/active layer/MoOx/Al) diodes. By fitting the data using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S4†), the electron mobilities (μe) of BTTIC and a-BTTIC pure films were found to be 9.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.05 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher μe value of a-BTTIC suggested a more advantageous π–π stacking of asymmetrical a-BTTIC than that of symmetrical BTTIC. For the blended films, the hole/electron (μh/μe) mobilities were 8.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/5.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:BTTIC (μh/μe = 1.64) and 8.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/5.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:a-BTTIC (μh/μe = 1.60). Compared to BTTIC, the higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities of the a-BTTIC-based blended film were beneficial for diminishing the bimolecular recombination and enhancing the efficiency of charge collection for achieving higher JSC and FF.
By plotting the photocurrent (Jph) against effective applied voltage (Veff) (Fig. 3d), two key photophysical processes, exciton dissociation and charge extraction, were investigated. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are photocurrent densities under the of illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias. It is generally assumed that exciton can dissociate into polarons, and then move towards respective electrodes and be collected with minimal recombination when Veff is high enough. As shown, the Jph becomes saturated (Jsat) with a reverse voltage at ∼0.5 V, revealing efficient processes of exciton separation, charge transport and collection in two devices. The Jsats of PBDB-T:BTTIC- and PBDB-T:a-BTTIC-based OSCs were 20.13 mA cm−2 and 20.96 mA cm−2, respectively, indicating a larger maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) of a-BTTIC according to Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of active layer. In addition, the Jphs under short circuit and maximum power output conditions were found to be 19.45 mA cm−2 and 16.77 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:BTTIC-based OSCs, and 20.31 mA cm−2 and 17.87 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:a-BTTIC- based OSCs. Thus, the efficiencies of exciton dissociation (Pdiss) and charge collection (Pcoll), evaluated by the specific values of Jph/Jsat under the short circuit and maximum power output condition, respectively, were 96.6%/83.3% for PBDB-T:BTTIC and 96.9%/85.3% for PBDB-T:a-BTTIC. (Table S2†) The higher Pdiss and Pcoll were beneficial for the improvement of JSC and FF of a-BTTIC-based OSCs. The photocurrent (Jph), as a function of light intensities (P), was plotted in a double logarithmic scale to gain insights into the bimolecular recombination. Fig. 3e distinctly indicates that the Jsc values were highly linearly correlated to P in both PBDB-T:BTTIC- and PBDB-T:a-BTTIC-based OSCs. The slope (S) of OSCs based on PBDB-T:a-BTTIC was 0.958, which was higher than that of OSCs based on PBDB-T:ITCPTC-Se (0.932), indicating a reduced bimolecular recombination occurred in the bulk-heterojunction layer of PBDB-T:a-BTTIC.

It is generally acknowledged that the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology plays an important role in determining the performance of an OSC device. Herein, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted to survey the surface (Fig. 4) and bulk morphologies (Fig. 5) of BTTIC- and a-BTTIC-based photoactive layers, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the neat and blended films of both BTTIC and a-BTTIC exhibit smooth and uniform surface morphologies with small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness being 0.49 nm and 1.02 nm, and 1.07 nm and 1.30 nm, respectively. The RMS roughness of a-BTTIC neat film is two times higher than that of the BTTIC, which indicates a much stronger crystallization tendency of a-BTTIC (bigger crystalline domains can be seen in Fig. 4b), which can be attributed to its asymmetrical structure, according to our previously reported studies. When blended with PBDB-T, only small RMS roughness changes were observed, suggesting a good compatibility between the donor and acceptor. Moreover, a better phase separation was formed in PBDB-T:a-BTTIC blended film than that in PBDB-T:BTTIC blended film (Fig. 4c and d), which accelerates the exciton dissociation at the PBDB-T/a-BTTIC interface. Furthermore, a well-developed interpenetrating nanofiber microstructures in both PBDB-T:BTTIC and PBDB-T:a-BTTIC blended films can be clearly observed from their AFM phase images (Fig. S5†), which provide good bi-continuous channels for hole and electron transport.

A face-on orientation of donor and acceptor materials with a strong π–π stacking is crucial for the high-efficiency carrier transport, considering that the hole and electron are vertically migrated to respective electrode. PBDB-T, two SMAs and their blended films all display a typical face-on orientation with intense diffraction halos in its qz direction (Fig. 5a–e). The d-spacing and coherence length (CL) of the (010) diffraction peaks calculated from out-of-plane cut-line profiles (Fig. 5f) are 3.29/18.9 Å for PBDB-T, 3.16/25.4 Å for BTTIC, 3.09/28.7 Å for a-BTTIC, 3.31/18.1 Å for PBDB-T:BTTIC and 3.18/21.5 Å for PBDB-T:a-BTTIC, respectively (Table S3†). The shorter d-spacing and larger CL of a-BTTIC reveal a more compact and stronger π–π stacking than that of BTTIC in both neat and blended films, which is consistent with our previously studied asymmetrical effects and is beneficial to achieve balanced charge mobility and diminish the bimolecular recombination for high JSC and FF in OSCs.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, a high-performance asymmetrical non-fullerene small molecule acceptor, namely a-BTTIC, was synthesized by designing a novel eight-fused ladder-type core. By incorporating one thiophene into the core of BTTIC, the asymmetrical a-BTTIC showed a red-shifted absorption profile (by over 20 nm) and simultaneously an elevated LUMO energy level (by 0.07 eV) as compared to its symmetrical analogue. DFT calculations revealed that different molecular conformations and large LUMO energy level changes from the neutral to ion state of asymmetrical SMAs were responsible for this phenomenon. When blended with a wide-bandgap polymer PBDB-T, a-BTTIC-based OSCs achieved a PCE as high as 13.60% along with a VOC of 0.904 V, a JSC of 20.31 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.0%, which were all higher than those of BTTIC-based OSCs. It is worth mentioning that so far 13.60% is the highest PCE for commercialized PBDB-T-based OSCs. More importantly, a-BTTIC realized a reduced Eoptg and an enhanced VOC simultaneously, and also demonstrated a small Eloss of 0.526 eV with such high PCE. This is rarely observed in high-performance OSCs where Eloss values are smaller than 0.6 eV. Moreover, asymmetrical SMAs exhibited many advantages over symmetrical ones, such as enhanced charge transport properties, improved π–π stacking and more favorable micromorphology. Overall, our results demonstrate the great prospect of asymmetrical SMAs and provide a promising molecular design strategy for the further breakthroughs of the PCE of non-fullerene organic solar cells.
