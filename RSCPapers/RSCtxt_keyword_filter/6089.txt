    , Accepted 18th March 2013First published on 20th March 2013AbstractThe first example of polyoxometalate (POM)–CdS quantum dots co-sensitized solar cell was successfully constructed via the chemical bath deposition and successive ionic layer adsorption method. The introduction of POM molecules not only successfully realizes a strong coupling of the different nanoparticles, but also enhances the electron transfer among the components of the nanohybrids. When assembled into solar cell devices, the as-grown CdS quantum dots/POM/TiO2 nanorods films are superior in charge separation as well as carrier transport, thus achieving higher short circuit current, fill factor and final conversion efficiency than the common CdS nanocrystal shell on TiO2 nanorods.
1. Introduction
To meet the increasing demand of clean energy, the harvesting of electricity from solar incident photons with high efficiency at economically viable cost is needed. Quantum dots (QDs) based solar cells are poised to play a leading role in this revolution owing to their potential in exceeding the Shockley–Queissar limit, their size-tuned optical response, and their efficient multiple carrier generation.1–5 A major challenge in developing high-performance QDs solar cells is the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and the transfer of the electrons to the electrode. To solve these problems, various strategies have been adopted, including morphological control, combination with higher conduction band (CB) materials to suppress the electron back transportation,6 and the introduction of carbon nanotube or graphene as photoactive supports.7 Among these efforts, a promising approach to improve the light to electricity conversion efficiency is the use of electron acceptors to accumulate electrons and facilitate charge propagation from the conduction band of semiconductors to the electrode. Such a donor–acceptor structure can retard effectively the fast charge pair recombination and consequently enhance the overall convert efficiency. Thus, searching for appropriate and effective electron acceptors should be of considerable significance for practical applications.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a well-known class of inorganic nanoclusters with a metal–oxygen framework, have an intrinsic ability to accept electrons readily.8–10 Simultaneously, POMs can undergo reversible multielectron redox reactions in retaining intact structure;11–13 this makes POMs efficient electron scavengers to synergically transport photogenerated electrons in the conducting band of a semiconductor and then enhance the photoelectrochemical response.14 CdS–polyoxotungstate nanohybrids showed visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity to produce H2 and O2, which was superior to those of the unhybridized CdS and polyoxotungstate.15 The hybridized nanostructures of CdSe@CdS QDs and Na–POMs exhibited remarkably reversible and stable optical writing/erasing behavior under the control of UV light/visible light irradiation.16 CdS–PAH/P2W18 film exhibited higher photocurrent response intensity than the simple sum of individual components.17 The above results suggest that incorporating POMs into CdS film may be effective to facilitate photogenerated electron transfer by retarding electron–hole recombination. To our knowledge, however, the application of CdS QDs/POM composite film on sensitized solar cells has been unexplored so far.
Herein we provide a first example of POM–CdS QDs co-sensitized solar cell (PQSSC) based on novel CdS QDs/POM/TiO2 nanorods (NR) composite film by a strategy of chemical bath deposition accompanied with successive ionic layer adsorption. Specifically, the anionic ammonium metatungstate hydrate ((NH4)6H2W12O40·nH2O, denoted as AMT hereafter) has been selected to serve as co-sensitizer for the CdS QDs. Interestingly, the prepared CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs composite film is superior in charge separation and carrier transport, and thus achieves a higher overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiency than CdS QDs/TiO2 NRs film. The overall conversion efficiency of PQSSC has been improved by 70% compared with the common CdS QDs sensitized solar cell.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of the TiO2 NRs films
Prior to the growth of the NRs, a TiO2 polymeric sol prepared by the sol–gel process was spin-coated on the FTO and then annealed at 450 °C for 1 h as the seed layer. The TiO2 NRs array was synthesized on the seeded-FTO substrate by using the hydrothermal method.18 In a typical synthesis, titanium(IV) butoxide was added into 30 mL of an aqueous HCl solution (15 mL of deionized (DI) water + 15 mL of concentrated HCl (38%)) under magnetic stirring. After stirring for another 5 min, the solution was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL capacity) and a piece of the seeded-FTO substrate, which had been cleaned for 10 min using an ultrasonicator in a mixed solution of DI water, acetone, and isopropanol, was immersed in the solution. The autoclave was sealed and heated to 150 °C for 15 h without stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained product was annealed at 450 °C for 1 h in air.
2.2 Synthesis of CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs films
To directly synthesize CdS QDs/AMT heterostructures from aqueous solution on as-prepared TiO2 NRs film, the chemical bath deposition method accompanied with successive ionic layer adsorption was used. The TiO2 NRs deposited FTO glass was successively immersed in three different beakers for about 30 s in each beaker. One beaker contained 0.1 mM AMT aqueous solution, one contained 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 methanol solution, and the other contained 0.1 M Na2S methanol solution. As TiO2 nanorods are positively charged in aqueous solution, the spontaneous self-assembly of the anionic AMT and the cationic TiO2 onto the substrate depends basically on the coulomb force between the oppositely charged species. Subsequently, a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction was used, which is a highly selective to deposit CdS quantum dots on anionic AMT molecular.19 Such a cycle was repeated several times, which gave a film with yellow color. The schematic of the process is illustrated in Scheme 1. Layered CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs heterostructures were prepared by repeating above steps. For comparison, CdS QDs/TiO2 NRs thin films were prepared with the absence of AMT, after the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction.20,21

2.3 Cell assembly
The photoanode with an effective area of 0.2 cm2 was assembled and sealed with a transparent hot-melt surlyn ring to the counter electrode (Pt-coated FTO glass). The iodide based electrolyte, consisting of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.3 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.3 M tetrabutylammonium iodide in acetonitrile, was injected into the inter-electrode space from the counter electrode side through a pre-drilled hole.
2.4 Characterizations
The morphology of the products was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI, Quanta 400 FEG), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI, TecnaiF20). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with high-intensity Cu-Kα1 irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) with a Krato, AXIS-HS monochromatized Al Ka cathode source, at 75–150 W, using low energy electron gun for charge neutralization. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) were investigated on a fluorometry (F-4500, Hitachi). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi 3010 spectrophotometer. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2611 digital source meter. The light source was a 150 W xenon lamp (Sciencetech, SS150) calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a standard Si solar cell. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at a constant temperature of 20 °C under dark condition using the ZPlot/ZView electrochemistry workstation under an ac perturbation signal of 5 mV over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 mHz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs composite film
Shown in Fig. 1a and b are the top view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of as-synthesized TiO2 nanorod array film. The film consisting of vertically aligned and tetragonal shaped nanorods is highly uniform and densely packed with diameters of 100–150 nm and lengths of 2 μm. The seed layer of TiO2 is about 200 nm from the inset image of Fig. 1b. XRD (Fig. 1c) shows that the TiO2 films deposited on FTO substrates are rutile phase. The diffraction peaks of an FTO substrate are also observed and plotted for comparison. All the diffraction peaks that appear upon nanorods growth agree well with the tetragonal rutile phase (JCPDS No.21-1276). Compared to the powder diffraction pattern, the (200) diffraction peak is significantly enhanced, which indicates that the as-deposited film is highly oriented with respect to the substrate.

After CdS deposition, the surface of TiO2 nanorods becomes rough because of the coated CdS shells (Fig. 1d). Fig. 1e gives the TEM image after the CdS QDs deposition, showing that the size of QDs varies from 2 to 10 nm. In situ energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of the nanohybrid was performed to examine the components of the nanohybrid. As shown in Fig. 1f, it is clearly showed that except for strong peaks of S, Cd, Ti and O, tungsten (W) is also present in the samples, confirming the AMT existence around CdS QDs.
In order to further identify the chemical composition and the binding energy of the atoms, we measured the XPS of the CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs film on FTO substrates. The presence of Ti, O, Cd, S and W elements in the film can be confirmed by the observed signal peaks in Fig. 2a. The Ti 2p peak is observed at 458.8 and 464.4 eV, corresponding to Ti4+ of TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 2b). The peak with Cd 3d at 405 and 411.7 eV can be assigned to Cd2+ of CdS particles (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, there is a W4f5/2 and W4f7/2 doublet with the binding energies of 36.13 and 38.23 eV respectively (Fig. 2d). These values indicate that tungsten is in its full oxidation form in AMT when assembling in the nanohybrid. These results suggest that we indeed incorporate both AMT and CdS into the composite film.

3.2 Photovoltaic property of CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs film
The influence of AMT molecules on the photovoltaic performance of the CdS QDs/TiO2 NRs film is firstly researched. When taking the CdS QDs/TiO2 NRs film as a reference, the overlapping absorption spectra (Fig. 3a) for the two structures demonstrate that their absorption capabilities are almost the same. Next, the two structures were assembled into solar cells and compared in terms of their photo-electron conversion efficiency. The measured photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 3b, and the related physical values, including VOC (open circuit voltage), JSC (short circuit current), FF (fill factor), and η (light to electricity conversion efficiency), are summarized in Table 1. The η value can be evaluated from the equation η = (JSC × VOC × FF)/Pin, where Pin is the incident light power density. As shown in Fig. 3b and Table 1, the CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs sample exhibits much larger values of JSC and FF than that of CdS QDs/TiO2, and overall conversion efficiency has been improved by 70%. Since the absorption ability of the two structures is almost the same (see the Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs and CdS QDs/TiO2 NRs films shown in Fig. S1, ESI†), the photovoltaic results indicate that the CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs structure is advantageous over the CdS QDs/TiO2 NRs structure in charge separation and collection. Furthermore, for the CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs system, both JSC and VOC increase with the deposition cycles and reach a maximum value, after which they decrease, as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI.†

To further improve the photo-to-current conversion efficiency of our devices, the possibility of optimizing the structure of the photoanodes by ZnS coating is further studied. Due to the suppression of charge recombination arising from the climb of the conduction band edge, both the conversion efficiency of CdS QDs/TiO2 and CdS QDs/POM/TiO2 nanorods has been improved, which are 0.76% and 1.61%, respectively (as shown in Fig. 3b and Table 1). These results indicate the promising application of AMT in the design of sensitized solar cells for high-efficient photovoltaic devices.
3.3 The role of AMT in CdS QDs sensitized solar cells
It was interesting to explore the role of AMT for the significant increase in the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. To clarify the origin of the different performances, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were performed in dark conditions and the Nyquist spectra for and CdS QDs/TiO2 and CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 electrodes with different repeat cycles are shown in Fig. 4a. With the introduction of AMT, the semicircles of all composite electrodes in the plot become shorter, which indicates a decrease in the interface layer resistance and the charge transfer resistance on the surface.22,23 Therefore, incorporating AMT into the semiconductor will increase the electron accept and transport rate in the composite and could contribute to the suppression of charge recombination, thereby a higher JSC would be achieved. Also we can see with the increasing of deposition layers, a higher injection resistance exists at the interface, which is in accordance with the I–V results that the photocurrent decreases rapidly with the potential applied, leading to a smaller FF.
 Fig. 4  (a) Nyquist spectra of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and (b) photoluminescence spectra of CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs and CdS QDs/TiO2 NRs films. 
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the prepared films give more information on the electronic structure of the nanohybrid. As shown in Fig. 4b, the bare CdS QDs film show a broad PL band centered at 582 nm. While, when CdS QDs was anchored on the TiO2 nanorods film, the PL intensity showed remarkable decrease. Such quenching phenomenon indicates that there is an efficient electron transfer between CdS QDs and TiO2. With the introduction of AMT, the fluorescence of the film was further quenched, which illustrated that AMT can serve as an acceptor of the generated electrons of CdS and effectively facilitate charge propagation from the conduction band of semiconductors to the electrode.
It is known that the most important point for a quantum dots sensitized solar cell system is how the photo-induced electrons–holes are separated. In our systems, AMT is an important molecule that facilitates the charge separation of CdS QDs. Theoretically, photoexcitation of the CdS QDs would result in the electron transfer from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), thus yielding electron–hole pairs. As soon as the charge separation occurs, the electron–hole pairs would be destined for recombination or the electron transfer. When the CdS QDs were assembled with AMT, the electron transferred from the CB of CdS QDs to the LUMO orbit of AMT could occur, which then further transferred to TiO2 nanorod, as illustrated in Scheme 2. Such electron transfer enhanced the spatial separation of photo-induced holes and electrons, suppressed the electron–hole pairs recombination and therefore contributed to the final improved conversion efficiency.

4. Conclusion
A novel polyoxometalate–CdS quantum dots co-sensitizer was used to improve the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of quantum dots sensitized solar cells. Owing to the introduction of AMT molecules, the CdS QDs/AMT/TiO2 NRs films show superior spatial charge separation and collection, as well as carrier transportation by depressing possible recombination, thus achieving higher short circuit current, fill factor and the final conversion efficiency was increased by 70% in comparison with the common CdS QDs/TiO2 NRs structure. It is anticipated that further efficiency promotion can be achieved by prolonging the length of TiO2 nanowires to load more CdS QDs/AMT composite, choosing quantum dot materials with narrower band gaps (CdSe, etc.) to enhance light absorption, or optimizing the phase structure of TiO2-based photoanodes. Since both the POMs and QDs are large family compounds, this work provides a new concept of designing novel QD sensitized solar cells with higher efficiency.
