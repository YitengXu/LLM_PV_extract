    , Accepted 22nd May 2017First published on 22nd May 2017AbstractThe spatial carrier separation of semiconductor photocatalysts with different crystal facets has been utilized for improving photocatalytic efficiency. However, the efficiency of spatial carrier separation is restricted in these facet-based semiconductor photocatalysts. Herein, we aim to steer spatial separation of photoexcited carriers by implementing a doping strategy and select BiOCl nanoplates as a model photocatalyst to investigate spatial carrier separation and photocatalytic performance. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that doped BiOCl single crystalline nanoplates have (001) crystal facets on their top and bottom surfaces, while they have (110) crystal facets at their four side surfaces. The photoelectrochemical results show that doping enhances the separation efficiency of the photoexcited carriers. Meanwhile, the phenomenon that the valence band decreases gradually while photocatalytic degradation efficiency increases with increasing dopant concentration implies that the increase of photocatalytic efficiency originates from the effective separation of the photoexcited carriers. Furthermore, photodeposition results of BiOCl and doped BiOCl nanoplates indicate an enhanced spatial separation of photoexcited electrons and holes between (001) and (110) crystal facets. The doped BiOCl nanoplates exhibit significant efficiency for pollutant degradation under visible light. The results obtained demonstrate the rational design of spatial carrier separation with different crystal orientations for more efficient solar-driven photocatalytic conversion.
Introduction
Semiconductor photocatalysis is considered as one of the best potential strategies to tackle the energy crisis and environmental pollution issues.1,2 During a typical photocatalytic process, the separation of carriers (i.e., electron and hole pairs) is the most important process in determining photocatalytic efficiency, because most of the photoexcited carriers prefer to recombine with each other, and only a small amount of carriers are available for the subsequent photocatalytic reaction.3–5 The low efficiency of carrier separation results in poor photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, it is imperative to develop strategies to enhance the efficiency of carrier separation for the applications of semiconductor photocatalysis.
At present, semiconductor photocatalysts integrated with metals (mainly noble metals),6,7 semiconductor–semiconductor junctions,8,9 and other materials-based photocatalyst hybrid structures, such as photocatalysts combined with graphene10 and carbon nanotubes,11 are pervasively developed to separate carriers on the photocatalyst surface. Recent developments in engineering crystal facets have enabled effective separation between electron and hole pairs in the photocatalyst interior.12–18 That is, upon excitation of a semiconductor, the internal driving force derived from carriers being unevenly distributed steers photoexcited carrier migration to different crystal facets immediately after carrier generation. This spatial separation of photoexcited carriers results in enhanced photocatalytic efficiency because one crystal facet is prone to oxidation and the other to reduction reactions (Fig. S1†). It is, however, extremely thought-provoking that the spontaneous spatial carrier separation efficiency is still heavily limited in these semiconductor photocatalysts with different crystal orientations, and enhanced spatial separation of photoexcited carriers for further improving photocatalysis is imperative. Unfortunately, the regulation of internal carrier spatial separation of photocatalysts with different crystal orientations has received little attention. Recent research by Li et al. on the steering internal electric field of single crystals of bulk Bi3O4Cl is the pioneering work in this respect and has achieved a great enhancement of spatial carrier separation.19 However, that study only focused on bulk Bi3O4Cl; internal carrier spatial separation of other photocatalysts with different crystal orientations is a pressing need so that highly efficient photocatalytic systems can be constructed for practical application.
As a novel ternary oxide semiconductor, BiOCl has witnessed a surge of attention for its excellent photocatalytic performance which benefits from its layered crystalline structure consisting of [Bi2O2]2+ layers sandwiched between two slabs of Cl−.20–23 Particularly, recently reported BiOCl enclosed with (001) and (110) crystal facets has confirmed spatial carrier separation.24,25 Inevitably, the problem of reduced carrier spatial separation exists as well. Doping has been a widely used strategy to improve photocatalytic efficiency of different kinds of semiconductor photocatalysts in the past decade.26–28 To date, extensive studies involving doping of bismuth oxyhalides have been reported by many groups. These efforts have improved the photocatalytic efficiency of bismuth oxyhalides. However, the previous reports are focused on mediation of optical and structural properties,29–32 heterojunction construction33 and defect engineering.34 Although various roles of doping, such as increasing solar absorption,35 heterojunction formation36 and providing catalytic sites,37 are mentioned in terms of improving photocatalytic efficiency, the role of enhanced spatial carrier separation has seldom been systematically investigated. In this paper, we demonstrate enhanced spatial carrier separation of BiOCl nanoplates with iodine doping for improving rhodamine B (RhB) and antibiotic tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) degradation efficiency. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we first synthesized iodine-doped BiOCl nanoplates with top and bottom surfaces of (001) crystal facets and four side surfaces of (110) crystal facets and proved their excellent photocatalytic efficiency. Then, the optical properties were investigated and the contrary relationship between valence band and photocatalytic degradation efficiency implies that the increase of photocatalytic efficiency may originate from the effective separation of the photoexcited carriers, which is different from the research reporting mediation of valence band of materials by doping, resulting in relatively low valence band of the materials for improved oxidation power.38,39 Subsequently, photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted which indicate that doping enhances the separation efficiency of the photoexcited carriers of BiOCl nanoplates. Finally, photodeposition experiments were conducted to obtain evidence of the enhanced spatial separation of electrons and holes between the (001) and (110) crystal facets of BiOCl nanoplates. The results obtained here demonstrate the rational design of spatial carrier separation in a semiconductor with different crystal orientations for more efficient solar-driven photocatalytic conversion.
Experimental
Synthesis of BiOCl nanoplates
BiOCl nanoplates were synthesized with a method as reported before with minor modification.40 In a typical synthesis, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1.0 mmol) was dissolved in mannitol aqueous solution (0.1 M, 25.0 mL) at room temperature. Then, NaCl (5.0 M, 6.0 mL) was slowly added dropwise into this mixture to form a uniform solution. Subsequently, the obtained solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 3 h, followed by a natural cooling process. To collect the products, the reaction solution was centrifuged and washed repeatedly to remove the residual reactants, and dried at 60 °C in an oven.
Synthesis of doped BiOCl nanoplates
BiOCl nanoplates doped with different iodine concentrations were synthesized similar to the above mentioned method. In brief, after Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1.0 mmol) was dissolved completely, stoichiometric amounts of NaCl (5.0 M) and KI (2.5 M) with a total volume of 6 mL were added dropwise into the solution under stirring. The other procedures were the same as that of the BiOCl nanoplates. BiOCl nanoplates with iodine dopant concentrations of 0, 0.72%, 1.81% and 3.05% were named as BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3, respectively (Table S1†).

Photodeposition experiments. 
The photodeposition experiments of Pt and manganese oxide on BOC or BOC-3: H2PtCl6·6H2O and MnSO4·H2O were selected as precursors for Pt and manganese oxide photodeposition experiments, respectively. In detail, BOC or BOC-3 (0.05 g) and H2PtCl6·6H2O solution (20 mg L−1, 150 μL) or MnSO4·H2O (5 mg) were added to deionized water (80 mL). Then the solution was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp under monochromatic UV light (λ = 365 nm) with continuous stirring. After photodeposition for 2.5 h, the precipitates were collected, washed with deionized water thoroughly, and finally dried at 60 °C under vacuum.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by using a Rigaku Corporation D/max 2550 X-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted by using an FEI Co. Ltd Nova Nano 230 and a Japanese Electronics Co. Ltd JEM-2100F. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted with a Thermo ESCAlab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The binding energies obtained in the XPS analysis were corrected by referencing C 1s to 284.8 eV. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with an Evolution 220 UV-Vis spectrometer in the wavelength range of 1100 nm to 200 nm, and BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard. The specific surface area values were determined by using a TRISTAR-3000 surface area analyzer. Total organic carbon (TOC) assays were performed by using a Shimadzu TOC-VCPH analyzer. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was conducted with a Shimadzu LC-MS 2010 A with LC-10ADvp pump, a Thermo Scientific hypurity C18 column and a SPD-M10Avp detector at 200–350 nm. A solution of methanol and ammonium formate (5 mM) in a volume ratio of 48:52 was chosen as the mobile phase with a rate of 0.2 mL min−1. 5 μL of the sample solution was injected.
Photocatalytic activity evaluation
RhB dye (60 mg L−1) and TC-HCl (30 mg L−1) were degraded by using as-prepared samples under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) or UV light (λ < 365 nm) irradiation. The visible light was produced by a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cut-off filter and UV light was produced by a 300 W Hg lamp with a 365 nm cut-off filter. In each experiment, photocatalysts (10 mg) were put into a quartz tube containing RhB or TC-HCl aqueous solution (15 mL). Before the illumination, the suspension was magnetically stirred for 1 h in the dark to ensure equilibrium of adsorption–desorption between the photocatalysts and the dye. Then the quartz tube containing RhB aqueous solution was exposed to visible light or UV light under magnetic stirring with a 15 min interval and 5 min interval. The quartz tube containing TC-HCl aqueous solution was irradiated with a 20 min interval under visible light. During each interval, 5 mL solution was taken out. The insoluble particles were removed via centrifugation with a speed of 12000 rpm. The concentrations of RhB and TC-HCl were analyzed with a UV-visible spectrophotometer and determined as a function of irradiation time by recording the absorbance at 554 nm and 357 nm, respectively. The same procedure was used in the active species trapping experiments, except that different scavengers were added.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chenhua, China) in a standard three-electrode system with a glass electrode coated with photocatalysts as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as reference electrode, and a Pt foil as counter electrode. The working electrodes were fabricated as follows: as-prepared photocatalysts (20.0 mg) were uniformly dispersed in a certain amount of ethanol and Nafion solution to make a slurry. 40 μL of the slurry was then uniformly coated onto the surface of 1 cm × 1 cm indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrodes. Subsequently, the coated glass electrodes were heated at 100 °C for 1 h in a vacuum oven. The three electrodes were inserted and fixed in a quartz cell containing Na2SO4 electrolyte (0.1 M). A 300 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter (λ < 400 nm) was used as the light source. The transient photocurrents were operated by i–t (current–time) techniques under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles of 20 s) at a bias potential of −0.3 V for 400 s. Electrochemical impedance spectra were measured over a frequency range of 10 mHz–1000 kHz with an amplitude of 5 mV. Mott–Schottky curves were collected at a frequency of 1000 Hz with a bias potential that ranged from 1.0 to −1.0 V. The transient open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) curves were obtained by the open-circuit potential-time (OCPT) technique with NaOH (1 M) used as electrolyte. The average lifetime of the photoexcited carriers (τn) was calculated based on eqn (1): (1)where kB, T and q are the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23), temperature in kelvins and the unsigned charge of an electron (1.60 × 10−19 C), respectively.
Results and discussion
Characterizations of as-prepared samples
The crystal phases of as-prepared BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 were studied by XRD (Fig. 1). It can be seen that all samples have good crystallinity. The diffraction peaks can be indexed to tetrahedral BiOCl crystal phase (JCPDS no. 06-0249). No residual phase is detected, and diffraction peaks of doped samples shift to lower angles with increasing doping concentration, indicating that iodine enters the crystal lattice of BiOCl, and the obtained samples are iodine-doped BiOCl, rather than a mixture of BiOCl and BiOI (Fig. S2†). XPS analysis (Fig. S3†) also evidences the existence of iodine dopant. Moreover, the sum of Cl and I amounts in BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 is equal to the amount of Cl in BOC (Table S1†). This observation provides strong evidence of Cl substitution by I, consistent with a previous report.41 To further verify the existence of iodine dopant in doped BiOCl nanoplates, HAADF-STEM and corresponding elemental mapping images as well as EDS pattern were obtained (Fig. S4†). The element mapping demonstrates the iodine element is evenly dispersed in the entire nanoplate region. In addition, EDS shows an additional weak iodine peak, further evidencing the existence of iodine dopant. Signals of Au and Si for BOC-3 are observed, which should originate from sprayed gold for conduction and Si substrate, respectively.

The morphologies of as-prepared BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 were checked by SEM (Fig. 2). The results indicate that BiOCl samples present square-like nanoplate configuration with an edge size of 125–275 nm and a thickness of 28–47 nm. Being estimated from the geometric calculation, the percentage of (001) facets is ca. 79.5% for BOC. Square-like nanoplate construction of BiOCl is maintained upon introduction of moderate iodine with a slight decrease of both the edge size and thickness of the plates. The edge size and thickness of BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 are shown in Table S2.† It is noteworthy that the percentage of (001) crystal facets on the surface shows no obvious change after introduction of moderate iodine.

Further information of BOC-3 can be obtained from TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). A TEM image further confirms its nanoplate structure (Fig. 3a). The HRTEM image taken from the side face shows an interplanar lattice spacing of 7.78 Å, which can be assigned to the (110) facets (Fig. 3b). The HRTEM image taken from the top face shows an interplanar lattice spacing of 2.86 Å, corresponding to the (001) facets (Fig. 3c). The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern taken from the top face of a nanoplate indicates the single-crystalline characteristic of BOC-3. The angle labeled in the SAED pattern is close to the theoretical value of the angle between the (110) and (200) planes (Fig. 3d). On the basis of the above results of BOC-3, the bottom and top surfaces of BOC-3 are enclosed by (001) facets, while the four side surfaces are identified as (110) facets. A schematic illustration of the crystal orientation of BOC-3 is shown in Fig. 3e. TEM and HRTEM of BOC were also conducted (Fig. S5†). Notably, the interplanar lattice spacings of BOC-3 at side face and top face are both larger than those of BOC, which strongly indicates that iodine enters the crystal lattice of BiOCl.

In order to investigate the impact of doping on the optical properties, band-gap energies (Eg) of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 were determined. We first plot their transformed Kubelka–Munk functions vs. the photo energy based on measured UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 4a). Eg could be estimated by extrapolating the straight portion of the (αhν)1/2 against hν plot to the intercept of the tangent to the x-axis according to eqn (2):42 αhν = A(hν − Eg)2(2)where α, h, ν, Eg and A are absorption coefficient, Planck constant, light frequency, band gap and a constant, respectively. It is found that Eg are 3.21, 2.87, 2.67 and 2.49 eV for BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3, respectively. Conduction bands (ECB) were determined by Mott–Schottky curves (Fig. 4b). It can be seen that ECB positions shift positively with increasing concentration of dopant, and ECB are −0.57, −0.50, −0.45 and −0.38 eV for BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3, respectively. According to eqn (3)43 EVB = Eg + ECB(3)valence bands (EVB) of 2.64, 2.37, 2.22 and 2.11 eV are obtained for BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3, respectively. According to these, a schematic illustration for energy band levels of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 is depicted in Fig. 5. The results demonstrate that iodine doping enables a lifting of valence band and lowering of conduction band to reconstruct the band structures.

Photocatalytic activity and stability
The photocatalytic performance of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 was evaluated by the degradation of RhB solution under visible light irradiation (Fig. 6a). The blank test indicates that the degradation of RhB is extremely slow without photocatalyst. When BOC is used, the degradation rate of RhB increases to 41.4% while illumination is performed for 60 min because of the photosensitization.40 For BOC-1 and BOC-2, the degradation rates of RhB are determined to be 58.6% and 85.0% after 60 min. Importantly, when BOC-3 is used, 99.5% of RhB can be eliminated with the same illumination. On further increasing the concentration of iodine dopant, doped BiOCl nanoplates show a decreased photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation. This may result from the nanoflowers assembled from nanoplates being adverse to separation of the photoexcited carriers compared with nanoplate configuration (Fig. S6†). Moreover, the degradation reaction of RhB can be regarded as having pseudo-first-order kinetics and the linear relationship between ln(C0/C) and t is shown in Fig. 6b. The rate constants of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 are 0.898% min−1, 1.462% min−1, 3.146% min−1 and 4.774% min−1, respectively. The rate constant of BOC-3 is 5.3 times higher than that of BOC. These results reveal the key role of doping in promoting the photocatalytic activity. In order to rule out that the increased degradation efficiency is contributed by the increased dye sensitization in the photodegradation process, TC-HCl was chosen as a representative colourless model organic pollutant. 10 mg of as-prepared samples was dispersed into 15 mL of TC-HCl (30 mg L−1) aqueous solution, followed by visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation after adsorption–desorption equilibrium. As shown in Fig. S7,† the photocatalytic efficiency for TC-HCl degradation under visible light irradiation follows the order of BOC < BOC-1 < BOC-2 < BOC-3, consistent with that of RhB. The results exclude the increased degradation efficiency being contributed by the increased dye sensitization and demonstrate the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst in the degradation of colourless organic pollutant. The degradation process and intermediate products of TC-HCl were also surveyed by using LC-MS and TOC tests with BOC-3 sample (Fig. S8†). Furthermore, according to the above results, the possible pathway for TC-HCl photodegradation is illustrated in Fig. S9,† consistent with the literature.44 Stability tests of the photocatalyst were conducted. No obvious deactivation was observed in photodegradation rates after 4 cycles of 60 min reaction (Fig. S10a†). Moreover, as shown in XRD patterns, the crystal structure of the photocatalyst after four cycles is well maintained (Fig. S10b†). In addition, the surface morphology of the photocatalyst with nanoplate configuration is well maintained (Fig. S11†). As shown in the survey spectra of photocatalyst after photocatalytic cycles and the high-resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f, O 1s, Cl 2p and I 3d (Fig. S12†), the composition after photocatalysis is unchanged, further confirming the high stability of the photocatalyst in photocatalytic oxidation of the organic contaminant.

Photocatalytic degradation pathway
To investigate the degradation process of RhB, LC-MS and TOC tests were conducted with BOC-3 sample. LC-MS chromatograms in Fig. S13a† show the peak of RhB decreases gradually under visible light irradiation and almost disappears after 60 min. Meanwhile, four new intermediates derived from sequential removal of the N-ethyl groups from RhB because of the attack by the active species on the N-ethyl groups in the degradation process are detected.32 The four intermediates, at m/z 415, 387, 359 and 331, are identified as N,N-diethyl-N′-ethylrhodamine (DER), N,N-diethylrhodamine (DR), N-ethylrhodamine (ER) and rhodamine (R), respectively. This agrees well with the literature.45,46 With the prolonging of the radiation time to 60 min, the four peaks of intermediate products almost disappear and no new peaks appear under this detection condition, indicating further destruction of the conjugated structure into CO2 or simple organic compounds.47 The TOC change for RhB photodegradation was also determined to reflect the extent of mineralization, and the results are depicted in Fig. S13b.† After 60 min irradiation, the removal efficiency of TOC for the BOC-3 sample is approximately 51.92%, indicating that RhB can be degraded by doped BiOCl under visible light irradiation.
Photocatalytic mechanism
Trapping experiments of the active species were conducted to investigate the photodegradation mechanism. Fig. S14† displays the results of the trapping experiments during the photocatalytic reaction. It can be seen that the degradation efficiency of RhB is not affected by the addition of 10 mM isopropanol (a quencher of ˙OH). On the contrary, the degradation efficiency of RhB decreases significantly upon the addition of 5 mM triethanolamine (a quencher of holes) and 5 mM p-benzoquinone (a quencher of ˙O2−). Therefore, it can be concluded that holes and ˙O2− are the main active species of as-prepared photocatalyst in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. On the basis of the above experiment results, a conceivable photocatalytic mechanism is illustrated in Fig. S15.† For the doped sample, the electrons can be excited to CB from VB and holes are generated in VB when it is irradiated by visible light. Then the generated holes acted as active species to directly oxidize RhB because the VB potential is more positive than the oxidation potential of RhB (+0.95 eV vs. NHE).46,48 At the same time, the photoexcited electrons in the CB (−0.38 eV vs. NHE) reduce the adsorbed O2 to ˙O2− as the CB potential is more negative than the standard potential of O2/˙O2− (−0.33 eV vs. NHE). As for the other active species of ˙OH, it is almost impossible to generate as the redox potential of OH−/˙OH (+1.99 eV vs. NHE) is more positive than that of BiV/BiIII (+1.59 eV vs. NHE) though the holes in the VB can also oxidize OH− to ˙OH.32,33,49 Therefore, ˙O2− acted as another active species to attack RhB and thus degrade it effectively together with holes.

The role of doping. 
Generally, photocatalytic efficiency is influenced by many factors, such as crystallinity, surface structure, exposed facets, specific surface area and the range of photo-absorption.19
In this work, the crystallinities of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 are similar according to the results of XRD. Surface structure and exposed facets are almost the same based on TEM. The specific surface areas of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 have similar values (Table S2†). To minimize the contribution of enhanced photo-absorption realized by doping, degradation efficiency of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 was compared using UV light (λ < 365 nm) as illumination source. Based on the data (Fig. S16†), degradation efficiency follows the order of BOC < BOC-1 < BOC-2 < BOC-3 identically, ruling out the effect of photo-absorption enhancement caused by doping. Moreover, for doped BiOCl, with an increase of iodine dopant concentration, valence band decreases gradually, while photocatalytic degradation efficiency increases. This phenomenon implies that the increase of photocatalytic efficiency may originate from the effective separation of the photoexcited carriers by the doping strategy.
To confirm that the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency originated from effective separation of carriers by doping, photoelectrochemical measurements of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 were performed. The transient photocurrent responses of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 are shown in Fig. 7a. The improved photocurrent indicates that the introduction of iodine to BiOCl significantly enhances its photocurrent, suggesting that doping favors separate photoexcited electron–hole pairs. The charge-transfer resistance was further studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to reflect the function of doping (Fig. 7b), in which the doped samples show a smaller arc radius compared with pristine BOC, indicating that doped samples have a lower resistance, resulting from the enhanced separation of carriers. These results are further confirmed by transient OCVD, which has been verified as a technique to investigate charge kinetics. As revealed by the OCVD curves (Fig. 7c), the amplitude of open circuit voltages (Voc) becomes gradually larger with increasing iodine dopant concentration, further providing evidence that doping promotes carrier separation. Moreover, the average lifetime of photoexcited carriers illustrated in Fig. 7d is apparently prolonged with an increase of iodine dopant concentration. All these results imply enhanced separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs in doped samples, which are consistent with the results of photocatalytic degradation under UV irradiation.

(c) OCVD curves of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3. (d) The calculated average lifetime of BOC, BOC-1, BOC-2 and BOC-3 according to the OCVD measurements. 
In addition to the effective separation of the photoexcited carriers, we propose that the excellent photocatalytic abilities of doped BiOCl can be attributed to the enhanced spatial distribution of photoexcited electrons and holes as a result of doping. This enhanced spatial separation is demonstrated by photodeposition experiments. The photoreduction deposition experiment of BOC-3 was carried out using H2PtCl6 as precursor. TEM image (Fig. 8b) clearly shows that the Pt particles are preferentially photodeposited on the (001) facets. Namely, the photoexcited electrons are accumulated on the (001) facets of BOC-3 for the reduction reaction. The photooxidation deposition experiment of BOC-3 was performed using MnSO4 as precursor and IO3− as electron acceptor. As shown in Fig. 8d, manganese oxide is preferentially photodeposited on the (110) facets. The formation of manganese oxide is an indication that photooxidation takes place on the (110) facets, that is, the photoexcited holes are preferentially accumulated on the (110) facets of BOC-3 for the oxidation reaction. Meanwhile, control photodeposition experiments of BOC were also carried out under the same conditions to verify enhanced spatial separation of photoexcited electrons and holes. As shown in Fig. 8a and c, although reactive sites of photoreduction and photooxidation of BiOCl nanoplates are consistent with those of doped BiOCl nanoplates, few Pt particles and little manganese oxide are photodeposited on the (001) facets and (110) facets in comparison with BOC-3, respectively. These results unambiguously prove the spatial separation of photoexcited electrons and holes, which results in the reduction and oxidation reactions taking place, respectively. Moreover, enhanced spatial separation of photoexcited electrons and holes between (001) and (110) crystal facets of BiOCl nanoplates is achieved by doping. Finally, enhanced photocatalytic efficiency is realized. Based on the above results, a schematic illustration of enhanced spatial carrier separation is shown in Scheme 1.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that iodine doping is an efficient strategy to enhance spatial carrier separation of BiOCl nanoplates by a series of research involving mainly photoelectrochemical and photodeposition experiments. Because more electrons and holes can reach the surface reduction reactive sites and surface oxidation reactive sites respectively, doped BiOCl nanoplates apparently exhibit enhanced pollutant degradation efficiency in comparison with pristine BiOCl nanoplates under visible light. BOC-3 reaches a 5.3 times higher rate constant than BOC. Although doping is applied to improve photocatalytic efficiency in terms of various roles, enhanced spatial carrier separation has been systematically investigated here and its contribution to RhB and TC-HCl degradation has been proved. This work represents an important advancement toward spatial carrier separation engineering in semiconductors with different crystal orientations and may potentially be extended to other photocatalysts.
