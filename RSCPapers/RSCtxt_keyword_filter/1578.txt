, Accepted 8th January 2016First published on 21st January 2016AbstractNanostructured heterojunction semiconductor/metal oxide electrodes are desired for use in efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. We introduced a mesoscopic IO (meso-IO) structure and sensitized the TiO2 IO structure using a CdSe/CdS nanoparticle bilayer for use as PEC water splitting electrodes. The CdS nanoparticle shell was deposited on the IO surface using successive ionic layer absorption and reaction and subsequently, the CdSe layer was grown by chemical bath deposition. The CdSe/CdS double layer sensitization revealed the extension of visible light absorption up to 680 nm. The meso-IO structures provide an ideal geometry for highly compact composite materials; the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 structure produced a highly compact film with a volume fraction of approximately 82%. Thus, upon application as a PEC water splitting electrode, due to this highly compact structure, the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 electrodes exhibit a high volumetric photocurrent density of 1.95 mA cm−2 μm−1, which was higher than any previous reports in the literature. Moreover, we obtained improved long-term stability during water splitting: the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 electrode that was decorated using 3 at% iridium oxide colloidal particles displayed a photocurrent of 98% of the initial photocurrent for 2 h.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are innovative devices that convert renewable and abundant solar energy into electrical or chemical energy.1,2 Photoelectrochemical water splitting involves redox reactions at electrodes that produce hydrogen, a next-generation, clean and eco-friendly chemical fuel.2 Typically, a photon-absorbing electrode material for PEC water splitting requires a suitably narrow bandgap to absorb visible light as well as a high separation and transport efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs to induce a high throughput redox reaction.3 Metal oxides, such as TiO2, ZnO, α-Fe2O3, have been widely investigated, but these substances only partly satisfy these requirement and, thus, have shown limited performance.4–8 For example, TiO2 and ZnO only absorb UV light due to their wide bandgaps (3.2 eV for TiO2, 3.3 eV for ZnO).4–6 α-Fe2O3 has a relatively smaller bandgap of 2.3 eV but exhibits poor charge carrier mobility.7,8 One strategy to overcome this limitation is the use of a metal oxide heterojunction made from narrow bandgap semiconductor materials.9–14 For example, various semiconductors, such as CdS, CdSe, PbS and InP, have been incorporated in the form of metal oxide/semiconductor core/shell structures.9–15 These materials sensitize the metal oxides to enhance the harvesting of visible and up to near infrared light. Among them, CdS and CdSe have a relatively narrow direct bandgap (2.25 eV for CdS and 1.70 eV for CdSe). Moreover, the alignment of the band energy level in their heterojunction facilitates charge separation and allows for tuning of the band energy level for the water splitting reaction.
In practice, the formation of a heterojunction for high-performance PEC applications requires the optimized design of the metal oxide morphologies. Previously, various nanostructured metal oxides in the form of nanowires, nanotubes, and inverse opals (IOs) have been utilized.9,13,16–19 Most of all, these nanostructures provide a high specific area. Moreover, these nanostructures may further enhance charge diffusion since they possess directional morphologies. For example, ZnO nanowires and hierarchical nanowires have been incorporated with semiconductor quantum dots. Specifically, hierarchical ZnO nanowires decorated with CdSe and CdS nanoparticles had a saturated photocurrent density of up to 17.5 mA cm−2 (0.4 V vs. RHS), which was the greatest value among semiconductor nanoparticle sensitized electrodes reported to date.20
Among various nanostructures, the IO structure exhibits unique advantages. First, the IO geometry theoretically provides the greatest pore fraction (i.e., pore volume per unit volume), which implies the possibility of high-density sensitization by the semiconductor materials. The IO structure possesses fully networked pores, which facilitates the uniform coating of semiconductor nanoparticles (at several tenths of a nanometer) over the entire film; we have demonstrated the successful sensitization of TiO2 IO films using a bulky tetrapod QDs.19 Previously, CdS or CdSe-sensitized TiO2 IO structures have been demonstrated. However, their photocurrent values were in the range of 2.7–7.3 mA cm−2, which is relatively low compared with the photocurrent values of other nanostructures.19,21–23 The reason for this difference is that most previously fabricated IO structures had macroporous structures.21,23–25 Considering that a typical coating thickness of sensitizer nanoparticles is less than 50 nm, the pore size is too large even after nanoparticle incorporation, which results in low photocurrent density compared with other nanostructures.
In this study, we introduce, for the first time, a mesoscale porous IO structure. The mesoscale IO (meso-IO) structure fabricated here was approximately 80 nm, and thus, the size of the pores was several times smaller than in previously fabricated structures. We introduced a sequential layer of CdS and CdSe QD nanoparticles for visible light sensitization. The CdS and CdSe bilayers were prepared in the solution by the in situ growth to obtain uniform coverage. It is noted that the CdSe and CdS-coated meso-IO film has a highly volumetric density, i.e., highly compact morphology; the pore volume fraction was measured to be only approximately 20%. These CdSe/CdS-coated TiO2 IO films absorbed visible light up to 680 nm. The heterojunction of the CdSe/CdS/TiO2 efficiently separated charges during PEC operation. We obtained a photocurrent of 1.95 mA (cm2 μm−1) from the CdSe/CdS-coated TiO2 IO electrodes by means of water splitting, which is a larger value than has been reported in previous studies using semiconductor quantum-dot sensitized metal oxide electrodes. This high volumetric photocurrent was due to the highly compact structure of the CdSe/CdS-coated IO films. We also improved the long-term stability of the photocurrent generation from CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 through the assistance of an iridium oxide nanoparticle coating; the photocurrent retained 98% of the initial value at 2 h. We believe the mesoscale IOs, in which the pores may now be widely controlled even up to the mesopore scale, may be promising for use in various PEC devices.
Experimental
Fabrication of TiO2 mesoscopic inverse opal (meso-IO) structure
Monodisperse polystyrene (PS) colloidal particles were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, Pilkington) substrates using a dip-coating approach that is reported elsewhere.26 We used 99 nm diameter PS colloids with a 3% size polydispersity (Bangs Lab, Inc.). The TiO2 was deposited using a chemical vapor deposition approach using titanium tetrachloride and deionized water vapor precursors. The PS colloidal crystals were exposed to each precursor alternatively with N2 as the carrier gas. During the exposure, the chamber pressure was controlled to approximately 1 Torr. We repeated 200 cycles to achieve a TiO2 thickness of 20 nm. Finally, the TiO2-deposited PS colloidal crystals were heat-treated at 500 °C for 2 h, which left behind a TiO2 meso-IO with an 80 nm pore diameter.
Deposition of CdSe/CdS layers and iridium oxide colloidal particles
The deposition of the CdS layer on the surface of the TiO2 meso-IO was achieved using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR). One SILAR cycle consisted of dipping the sample in 200 mM CdSO4 for 30 s, rinsing with DI water for 30 s, and dipping the sample in 200 mM aqueous Na2S for 30 s. We repeated 15 SILAR cycles for the CdS layer deposition. The CdSe layer was deposited onto the CdS-coated meso-IO to obtain the CdSe/CdS/TiO2 meso-IO sample. The CdSe was deposited in a precursor solution containing 0.1 M sodium selenosulphate (Na2SeSO3) in an aqueous solution, 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2 in an aqueous solution, and 0.2 M trisodium salt in a nitrilotriacetic acid (N(CH2COONa)3) solution with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. The deposition was performed at 70 °C for 6 h. The deposition of iridium oxide particles was achieved by dip coating the CdSe/CdS-coated meso-IO film into the iridium oxide colloidal solution for a few minutes. The iridium oxide colloidal solution was prepared using a sol–gel reaction using Na2IrCl6 precursors reported elsewhere.27
Characterization
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a ZEISS SUPRA 55VP field emission SEM operating at 10 kV. The atomic concentration was obtained using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), which was performed with the SEM to determine the deposition concentrations of the semiconductor materials. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (JEM-3010, JEOL). The absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu).
Photoelectrochemical measurement
The PEC studies were conducted in a three-electrode system: working electrode, Pt counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A mixture of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 was used as the electrolyte solution. Linear sweep voltammetry was carried out with a potentiostat (VersaSTAT, AMETEK) under simulated light from a 150 W Xe lamp with AM1.5 G filters (PEC-L01, Peccell Technologies). The light intensity is adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using a Si reference cell (BS-520, Bunko-Keiki). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was estimated using a 300 W Xe light source (Oriel) with a monochromator and in DC mode. The incident light intensity was estimated using a photodiode detector (silicon-calibrated detector, Newport).
Results and discussion
The fabrication steps of the meso-IO TiO2 structures sensitized with a double layer of CdS and CdSe quantum dots (QDs) is briefly described as following. The meso-IO was prepared using 100 nm polystyrene (PS) colloidal crystal templates. A colloidal crystal film was deposited onto the substrate. TiO2 was deposited into the cavities of the colloidal crystals by chemical vapor deposition using TiCl4 and water vapor precursors. The TiO2 IO structure was then obtained by removal of the polymer colloidal crystal template at 500 °C. The CdS nanoparticle shell was deposited on the IO surface using the SILAR method with a CdSO4 and Na2S precursor bath. Subsequently, the CdSe layer was deposited by the CBD using a Cd(CH3COO)2 and Na2SeSO3 mixture bath.
The TiO2 meso-IO, the CdS-coated meso-IO, and the CdSe/CdS-coated meso-IO were investigated using SEM and TEM. The pore diameter of the meso-IO was approximately 80 nm in diameter, as shown in Fig. 1a and d. The CdS layer forms a uniform particulate shell with a thickness of approximately 20–30 nm using 15 SILAR cycles, as shown in Fig. 1b. Here, the amount of CdS deposition was controlled to result in high photocurrent generation when using the PEC electrode while maintaining a large enough pore cavity for the further deposition of an additional CdSe nanoparticle layer. We prepared 10 and 15 cycle samples that had 60 nm and 50 nm pore diameters after the deposition, respectively, but the 15 cycle CdS deposition sample had a higher photocurrent density than the 10 cycle sample (see Fig. S1†). The size of the CdS nanoparticles in the layer was approximately 9 nm, as shown in Fig. 1b and e. Then, we deposited the CdSe layer at a thickness of approximately 25 nm, as shown in Fig. 1c. The CdSe layer was composed of approximately 6 nm diameter nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 1f. Here, the deposition was controlled not to block the pore to accommodate the electrolyte solution during the PEC application and to achieve a higher photocurrent generation. We compared 3 h, 6 h, and 9 h CBD samples. The 6 h CBD sample had the greatest photocurrent among these samples (see Fig. S2†). The 9 h CBD sample had a lower photocurrent than the 6 h sample; this result may be due to blocking of the pores. The high-resolution TEM image of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO structure revealed two distinct lattice constant of 0.336 nm and 0.351 nm, as shown in Fig. 1f; the former matches the distance of the (111) plane of cubic CdS, and the latter corresponds to the (111) plane of cubic CdSe. The optimized CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 structure had pores of approximately 30–40 nm in diameter. The BET measurement revealed that the volume fraction of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 film was approximately up to 82%. The formation of this high volumetric density film reveals that the meso-IO structure possesses uniform-sized and full-networked pore structures, and thereby allows high-density accommodation of sensitizer nanoparticles.

The cross-sectional SEM of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 layer and the mapping of the Cd, S, and Se elements clearly showed that the CdSe/CdS layer is uniformly coated on the surface of the mesoscale pores throughout the entire film (see Fig. 2). The deposition amount of CdS and CdSe could be estimated by EDX; the CdS meso-IO TiO2 sample contains approximately 3.5 wt% of Cd and S, and in the case of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 sample, the amount of Cd and Se is approximately 11.3 wt%, respectively. The XRD patterns of the meso-IO TiO2 and the CdS- and CdSe/CdS-coated meso-IO TiO2 were also characterized. The CdSe-coated TiO2 film was also measured for comparison. The meso-IO TiO2 had peaks at 25.8°, 38.6°, 48.8°, 54.8°, 55.8° and 63.5°, which are assigned to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (215) planes of the anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS #21-1272), respectively (see Fig. 3). The CdS meso-IO shows additional peaks at 26.5°, 43.9° and 52.1°, which are from the (111), (220), and (331) planes of the cubic CdS phase (JCPDS #89-0440), respectively (see Fig. 3). The CdSe/CdS meso-IO had peaks at 25.6°, 42.6° and 50.8°, which were distinct from the CdS sample and were assigned to the (111), (220), and (331) planes of the cubic CdSe phase (JCPDS #19-191) (see Fig. 3). The spectrum displays no peaks corresponding e.g., CdO (40° for (111) plane) or Se2O5 (28° for (110) plane), which indicates the high purity of CdSe/CdS layer.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the meso-IO TiO2 and the CdS-, CdSe-, and CdSe/CdS-coated meso-IO TiO2 films were measured. The absorption of the bare TiO2 IO film was achieved up to approximately 400 nm, as shown in Fig. 4, which is typical absorption by TiO2.28–30 Compared with the TiO2 absorption spectra, the CdS sensitization enhances the absorption in the 400–500 nm wavelength range. The CdSe/CdS double layer sensitization revealed the shift of onset absorption up to 680 nm, as shown in Fig. 4. There was no apparent absorption peak corresponding to an excitonic transition, which reveals the CdSe/CdS bilayer is composed of particles with size distribution as observed above. In the case of CdSe sensitization, the onset absorption was similar to that of the CdSe/CdS bilayer sensitization, but the absorption intensity specifically at the wavelength of 400–500 nm was lower than the bilayer sensitization. The UV-vis spectra shows that the CdSe/CdS bilayer sensitization enhances the absorption range of visible light as well as the absorption intensity.

The electron lifetimes of the CdS- and the CdSe/CdS–TiO2 meso-IO photoanodes were measured using the open-circuit voltage (Voc) decay method. The lifetime of the CdSe meso-IO electrode was also measured for comparison. According to the fact that the lifetime is related to the rate of decrease of electrons in the conduction band, the lifetime is defined by the reciprocal of the rate of Voc decay over time using the following equation:31,32  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and e is the elementary charge. The CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrode has a 2–12 times longer electron lifetime than CdS meso-IO electrode over the measured voltage range, as shown in Fig. 5. This indicates the efficient charge separation by the type II band gap alignment in the CdSe/CdS bilayer QDs, which results in less electron–hole recombination (see Fig. S3†). Although the band energy level of bulk CdS straddles the level of CdSe, after CdS and CdSe form a junction, they form a staggered-type heterostructure by shifting the CdS bandgap downward, while the CdSe bandgap shifts upward.33–35 This band energy adjustment induces a smooth and efficient charge separation. Upon visible light exposure, the CdSe/CdS bilayer generates an electron–hole pair; the electrons are transported to the internal layer of the TiO2, while the holes are transported in the opposite direction, as shown in Fig. S3.† In addition, from Fig. 1, it can be observed that compared to the CdS coating, the CdSe/CdS bilayer sensitization improves the surface coverage of TiO2, which avoid the direct contact with an electrolyte solution, and thereby the recombination reaction. We observe a slower recombination reaction rate of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO than the CdSe meso-IO electrode, which confirms the efficient charge separation in the bilayer sensitization.

The photocurrents generated by the CdSe/CdS- and the CdS meso-IO TiO2 electrodes in visible-light PEC application were compared. A bare TiO2 and CdSe meso-IO electrode were also evaluated for comparison. Specifically, the photocurrent was measured under 1 sun intensity (AM1.5G condition) while increasing the applied potential from −1.3 V to 0.1 V with respect to the Ag/AgCl electrode. We use a sacrificial electrolyte containing a polysulfide solution (S2−/S22−) as the redox couple, which scavenges holes generated in the valence band of the electrode. We observed negligible photocurrent density generated in the case of bare TiO2, as shown in Fig. 6a, which is expected due to the negligible absorption of visible light in the UV-vis spectrum. The CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrode has a photocurrent density of 13.67 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V, whereas the CdS or CdSe sensitization only shows a photocurrent density of 4.23 or 4.88 mA cm−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6a; thus, the CdSe/CdS bilayer sensitization had 3.2 or 2.8 times higher photocurrent density than the CdS or CdSe sensitization, respectively.
 Fig. 6  (a) Current–voltage curves of the CdS meso-IO TiO2 and the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 structures under the illumination of the AM1.5G solar light. (b) The IPCE spectra of each structure. 
The incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the CdS-, CdSe- and CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 PECs were evaluated under exposure to light with a 400 to 680 nm wavelength, as observed in Fig. 6b. The IPCE was obtained using the following equation  where Jph is the photocurrent density, P is the light power density at each wavelength, and, c, h, and e are the velocity of light, Plank constant, elementary charge, respectively. The integration of the IPCE value over all wavelengths should be proportional to the photocurrent density. Comparing the integrated area of the IPCE of the CdSe/CdS- and the CdS meso-IO sample, the CdSe/CdS-sensitized electrode has a 3 times higher IPCE than the CdS-sensitized photoanode, which is similar to the ratio of the photocurrent densities. The CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 electrode displays the onset photocurrent at the wavelength of 680 nm, while the CdS- or CdSe-sensitized electrode displays the onset photocurrent at around 530 nm or 680 nm, respectively; thus, these IPCE spectra are well matched to the absorption ranges in the UV-vis spectra of each sample shown in Fig. 4a. Meanwhile, the IPCE value of CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrode was 65% at 400 nm wavelength, which was 27% higher than the IPCE of CdS meso-IO electrode. Considering the absorbance ratio of CdSe/CdS and only CdS films at this wavelength is only 1.3, the difference in the IPCE values for these electrodes is much larger. Moreover, the IPCE value of CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrode were 59% at 550 nm wavelength, which was 2.5 times higher than the IPCE of CdSe meso-IO electrode. The difference in the IPCE value was much larger than the absorbance ratio at this wavelength (1.5). These differences reveal that the higher photocurrent density of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 photoanodes is attributed to the improved visible light absorption as well as charge transfer property compared to the CdS or CdSe meso-IO electrode.
We prepare a macroporous (around 200 nm pore) IO TiO2 electrode sensitized by CdSe/CdS bilayer QDs to evaluate the effect of mesoscale pore size on the photocurrent generation. The macroporous IO was prepared by using a 230 nm PS colloidal crystal templates. The macroporous IO electrode displays 6 mA cm−2 under 1 sun exposure as observed in Fig. S4.† Thus, the meso-IO electrodes exhibits 2.3 times higher photocurrent density than the macroporous IO electrodes, which is attributed to smaller pore diameter and thereby higher specific area of the electrode. The photocurrent of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrodes was compared to those of conventional macroporous IO-based electrodes from the previous literature. The macroporous IO structures used in the literatures possessed pore diameters of several hundred nanometers. The macroporous IO-based electrodes showed the photocurrent densities in the range of 0.8–6.2 mA cm−2, as listed in Table S1.†22–25,36 Thus, the photocurrent density achieved by the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 photoanodes was much higher than previous results.
Meanwhile, we compared the photocurrent density of CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 electrodes with the photocurrent density of semiconductor nanoparticle-sensitized nanostructured electrodes from the literature. Specifically, we compared the volumetric photocurrent density, i.e., the photocurrent per unit volume of the film, as observed in Table S2.†17,20,23,37–43 The volumetric current density of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 structures is the highest although some of electrodes in the literature had areal photocurrent densities that were higher than the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2. The high volumetric current density of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrodes is attributed to highly compact structure provided by the meso-IO network. The meso-IO structure allows high-density accommodation of sensitizer nanoparticles.
Finally, the photoresponse and long-term photocurrent stability of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 photoanodes was measured and are observed in Fig. 7. The CdSe/CdS meso-IO PEC displays a continuous decay of the photocurrent. The photocurrent decay has been often observed, which was attributed to the high photocorrosion, such as the anodic oxidation by holes.44 Cd chalcogenide alloys have a slower transfer of holes compared with electrons, which induces the accumulation of holes and, therefore, the corrosion reaction. The photocorrosion reaction can be reduced by coating the QDs with passivation layers consisting of ZnS, ZnO, polymers or iridium oxide. Iridium oxide is a water oxidation catalyst, which scavenges holes to generate oxygen.45,46 We coated the film with iridium oxide colloidal particles on the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 film at a concentration of 3 at% (see Fig. S3†). The long-term stability of the photocurrent generation by the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 is greatly improved, as shown in Fig. 6; the photocurrent decay after 2 h is less than 2% of the initial stabilized photocurrent.

Conclusion
We introduced, for the first time, an IO structure with an approximately 80 nm diameter pore, which is several times smaller than the previously fabricated pores in IOs. We produced this mesoscale porous IO structure using PS colloidal crystal templates. The meso-IO TiO2 structures were sensitized using CdSe/CdS bilayer nanoparticles for visible light PEC water splitting. The bilayer sensitization was obtained by sequential coating in each precursor solution. We deposited 30 nm thick CdS and 22 nm thick CdSe particulate layers uniformly throughout the entire meso-IO film. The meso-IO structure provides a uniform pore network and thereby allow the formation of QD nanoparticle-sensitized structure with high volumetric density; the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 had an 82% volume fraction. The CdS and CdSe bilayer sensitization allowed the absorption of visible light up to 680 nm. Moreover, the stepwise band edge alignment in the bilayer allowed an efficient charge separation, resulting in long electron lifetime. When used as a PEC water splitting electrode, the CdSe/CdS meso-IO TiO2 electrode had a photocurrent density of 13.67 mA cm−2 upon the solar light irradiation. This value was 3.2 or 2.8 times higher than then CdS- or CdSe-sensitized meso-IO TiO2 electrode, respectively. Specifically, the volumetric photocurrent density generated by the CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrodes was 1.95 mA cm−2 μm−1, which was a larger value than that from any previous reports in the literature using semiconductor quantum-dot sensitized metal oxide electrodes. This high volumetric photocurrent density of the CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrodes confirms that the meso-IO structure allows high-density accommodation of sensitizer nanoparticles. Moreover, the CdSe/CdS meso-IO electrode (decorated with 3 at% iridium oxide colloidal particles on the surface as a hole scavenger) had a photocurrent decay of less than 2% after 2 h. The meso-IO structures provide an ideal geometry to obtain high volume fraction composite materials and, thus, make these materials valuable for functional compact films for various applications.
