This review attempts to summarize recent advances with respect to solution-processable molecular semiconductors having 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or its fluorine substituted derivatives as electron-accepting units published in the last few years. Semiconducting polymers containing BT units have shown attractive photovoltaic performance while the molecular ones still lag behind. The relationship between the structures, optoelectronic properties, and photovoltaic performance of these molecular semiconductors is discussed within this review.
1. Introduction
The possibility of abundant, exhaustless and free solar power as a clean renewable energy source has attracted researchers to develop photovoltaic cells to capture light and convert it to electricity. Currently, most solar panels installed are based on silicon, which have been developed over the last five decades and have become an established technology. Compared to inorganic photovoltaic devices, such as crystal silicon, cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide photovoltaic devices, modules comprised of organic semiconductors have the potential to be lightweight and flexible. This provides for convenient transportation and reduces economic cost as well.1,2 Organic semiconductors for photovoltaics have been extensively investigated since Tang fabricated and reported the first successful bi-layer photovoltaic cell with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1%.3 Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells utilizing p-type materials as the donor and n-type materials like fullerene derivatives as the acceptor, reported by Heeger et al., were recognized as a milestone and they are considered to be one of the most efficient architectures up to the present to overcome the limited exciton diffusion length of organic semiconductors.4,5 Aiming to achieve higher PCE, a large number of electron donor materials (p-type materials) for photovoltaic cells have been synthesized and studied in the last decade. Moreover, electron acceptor materials are emerging as new n-type materials to replace most commonly used fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). PCE around 11% has been achieved for BHJ organic photovoltaics, and this success is based on the contribution from scientists working in all related research areas, like material design, device optimization and interface investigation.6–10 Organic semiconductors can be divided into two major categories, conjugated polymer and molecular semiconductors. In contrast to polymer semiconductors, molecular semiconductors have several advantages such as easy purification, defined chemical structures, less batch to batch variations, and fine energy level tuning. In recent years, molecular semiconductors have been an emerging semiconductor material that has been approaching the efficiencies of polymer semiconductors with PCE around 10% achieved accompanied by the discovery of various efficient p-type materials.10–15

Fig. 1 shows a typical current–voltage curve for a photovoltaic cell under illumination. The photovoltaic performance is described by PCE, which is the product of short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) divided by overall input power. Voc is widely recognized as the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the p-type material and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the n-type material.16 Unlike Voc, which can be estimated from HOMO and LUMO levels, Jsc is relatively hard to predict since it is determined by many factors such as light absorption, exciton generation rate, and nanoscale morphology. FF is closely related to the balance between electron and hole mobility, geminate and nongeminate charge carrier recombination rate, series and shunt resistance, and also morphology.14,17 Increasing all three parameters could help improve photovoltaic performance, however, a trade-off between Jsc and Voc is found because the reduced HOMO level of the p-type material will result in a larger band gap, thus limiting the light absorbed (Tables 1–4).18

In order to have more photons captured in a wide solar spectrum, recent effort mainly focuses on designing polymers or conjugated small molecules with smaller band gaps. Combining electron-donor and electron-acceptor units on the molecular backbone has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for tuning frontier orbital energy levels and narrowing band gaps.19 Many conjugated polymers and small molecules reported today are following this strategy and yield well performing semiconductor materials. Various donor and acceptor units have been employed such as benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran, fluorene, cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione, diketopyrrolopyrrole, isoindigo, etc.5,20–27 Among these building units, electron-withdrawing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) is one of the most popular units used for synthesizing different alternating polymer and molecular semiconductors because of its easy synthesis and purification. In order to further tune the frontier molecular orbitals, crystallinity and solubility, different groups could be attached to the BT unit. As the smallest electron-withdrawing group, fluorine is also the most electronegative element. Fluorination has been shown to be an effective way to lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and hence the resulting polymers or molecules containing the ffBT unit could have lower HOMO energy levels and result in higher Voc in photovoltaic devices.28 The mesomeric donation property of the fluorine atom cannot be neglected, and the combined effect of inductively withdrawing and mesomeric donation of fluorine could lead to a broadened band gap.29 Introduction of fluorine atoms onto the BT unit could also increase the planarity of the backbone with the F⋯S interaction existing between BT and the adjacent thiophene unit. More importantly, fluorine atoms could facilitate intra- and intermolecular interactions, which is beneficial for long-range charge transport.30 Fluorinated BT (ffBT) was first developed by You and co-workers in 2011, and the polymer having ffBT showed better photovoltaic performance with higher Voc compared to the unmodified polymer.31 As shown in Scheme 1, BT can be synthesized from 1,2-diaminobenzene in dichloromethane in the presence of triethylamine while thionyl chloride is slowly added. The crude product can be purified by sublimation and then bromination can be conducted by adding bromine to the bromic acid solution.32 Dibrominated BT can be further modified to boronic acid functionalized BT.33,34 The halogenated BT and its derivatives can be further coupled with either stannylated or boronic acid functionalized electron-donor moieties through Stille or Suzuki coupling reactions to yield alternating polymer or molecular semiconductors. BT bearing boronate ester or boronic acid can also be employed to synthesize organic semiconductors through Suzuki coupling with halogenated electron-donor moieties.35 Currently, an eco-friendly method, C–H arylation coupling is under investigation to synthesize alternating copolymers or molecules. Either ffBT or brominated BT can be used in direct arylation reactions. Direct arylation coupling can help to avoid multiple synthesis and harsh conditions in halogenation of ffBT. This alternative method provides a less toxic and hazardous environment for developing other ffBT containing polymer and molecular semiconductors (Fig. 2–9).28,36,37

Alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers containing BT building units have shown state-of-the-art performance through synthesis optimization and device engineering. Wong has discussed the impact of different cathode interlayer treatment for BHJ photovoltaics including PC71BM and PBDT-BT. The Li-TFSI interlayer prepared from methanol solution was found to be the best for the conventional device configuration, which showed a PCE around 5.97%. Further improvement was done by using an inverted device configuration with a high molecular weight polymer and a PCE of 9.4% was achieved.51 Authors also observed that polymers synthesized from Suzuki coupling had a significantly higher molecular weight under the optimized conditions than those from Stille coupling. The molecular weight of the synthesized polymers has been demonstrated to affect the photovoltaic performance and reproducibility was a problem for polymers with batch-to-batch molecular weight variations.52,53 He and co-workers reported a PffBT4T-2OD copolymer consisting of tetrathiophene and ffBT units and a PCE over 10% was achieved.6
With the rapid development of BT copolymers, molecular semiconducting materials containing BT units are attracting more and more attention; therefore, it's appropriate time to summarize recent advances in molecular semiconductors built from BT units for photovoltaic devices. In this review, small molecules are classified in two major categories. In the first part, p-type molecules containing BT units will be discussed. There are two subsections, which focus on either donor units or acceptor units at the center, respectively, to build molecules. In the second part, n-type molecules that are comprised of BT units will be considered.
2. p-Type materials containing BT units
2.1 Molecules with central donor units
These molecules generally contain a donor unit at the center with the BT unit or its derivatives placed beside the central units that are linked by oligothiophene. Indacenodithiophene (IDT) has attracted attention due to its large and rigid planar conjugated structure. This unique structure could facilitate π–π stacking, and thus the intermolecular charge transport could be improved.54,55 High PCE over 6% was reported when it was incorporated into a polymer in 2011.56 Having IDT in small molecules was first studied by Hou and co-workers in 2012.38 The designed molecule M1 which has IDT as the donor at the core was surrounded by BT with hexyl-substituted bithiophene at the end. A deep HOMO energy level of −5.21 eV was obtained, which further resulted in a higher Voc of 0.93 V when used as the donor material in BHJ photovoltaics. The highest PCE of 4.25% was reported for M1 without additives when PC71BM was used as the acceptor. M2, whose structure is similar to that of M1, having the hexyl group replaced by a 2-ethylhexyl group, showed better photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 4.83%.39 The better photovoltaic performance was attributed to the relatively higher Jsc value. Different substitution on the IDT unit was also investigated. IDT bearing a longer alkoxyl chain (M3) showed a lower PCE compared to hexyl substituted M2 even though M3 had a broader absorption range. Lower hole mobility measured by space charge limited current (SCLC) is one of the reasons that limited obtaining higher Jsc and FF.
Conjugation of IDT could be further extended by replacing thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and better hole mobility has been found for indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) polymer materials.57,58 Jen and co-workers reported four different IDTT molecules having either fBT or ffBT with various dipole strength end groups (M4–M7).40M4 and M5 have the same conjugation length, however, the PCE of M4 is about 2% lower than that of M5. An interesting investigation was completed by comparing the dipole strength of BT and the end groups, which were speculated to aid the self-assembly through the end group interaction. Based on quantum chemical calculations, authors found a correlation between dipole strength and FF, mobility, and Voc losses. With the dipole strength increasing in the order of M4, M6, M5, and M7, higher FF, larger mobility, and decreased loss in Voc were observed. The highest PCE of 6.54% was measured from M7:PC71BM, which contained hexyl-substituted terthiophene as the end group. It was shown that replacing phenyl groups with alkyl groups could reduce steric hindrance on the IDT unit. Cao et al. reported several IDT-BT (M8–M10) molecules, which focused on the effect of fluorination and the thiophene π-bridge effect.41 The fluorination of BT has been demonstrated to be an effective way to decrease the HOMO energy level and improve the Voc value. In this case, by inserting a thiophene between ffBT and IDT, absorption intensity in the range of 400–600 nm was improved significantly. A PCE of 6.80% was obtained for M9 without any additional additive and treatment compared to 2.5% for M10 and 3.4% for M8. The vapor treatment of M9 using dichloromethane yielded an even higher PCE of 8.1%, which was due to the remarkable increase of FF from 62 to 76. Combining IDT and BT affords donor molecular materials for photovoltaics developed in the last few years with outstanding performance achieved. Further studies on this type of molecule are anticipated.
As one of the most productive electron donating units, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been used to synthesize various donor–acceptor polymer and molecular semiconductors after they were first reported by Hou et al. in 2008.59 Symmetrical and planar conjugated structures of BDT can lead to tight and regular π–π stacking, thus allowing for the improvement of the mobility.19,60 Polymer and molecular semiconducting materials with BDT as building units showed PCE around 10%.11,61,62 In this section, molecules comprised of BDT and BT will be discussed.
Li and co-workers proposed and synthesized two isomers with different moiety sequences.42M11 has the BT unit attached to the BDT while M12 has a thiophene spacer between these two units. These two molecules had similar UV-Vis absorption while the HOMO of M12 is slightly lower than that of M11. Hole mobility measured from organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and SCLC demonstrated that the mobility of M12 was much higher than M11, this was explained by the higher crystallinity of M12 studied from X-ray diffraction (XRD). Widely divergent photovoltaic performance was obtained, with a PCE of 1.58% for M11 and a PCE of 4.53% for M12. With a similar structure, M13 containing phenyl rather than thiophene at the terminal was reported by Lee.43 This replacement caused a higher HOMO level and a narrow absorption band. The hole mobility of M13 is two orders of magnitude lower than that of M11, and hence, the lower PCE of 1.22% was obtained.
Based on M11, a fluorine atom was added to the BT (fBT) unit to give M14 studied by Ko et al.44 Monofluorinated BT in M14 offered a higher HOMO level, thus resulting in a lower Voc when compared to M11 in solar cell devices. However, the overall performance was improved to 2.39% for M14, which benefited from higher Jsc. An even higher PCE of 4.08% was accomplished by adding 0.4% 1-chloronapthalene (CN) to the molecule and PC71BM solution to adjust the thin film morphology. In the same work, 2-ethylhexyloxy was substituted by the triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS) group. A deep HOMO level of −5.35 eV was gained for M15 compared to −5.10 eV for M14. Due to its low HOMO level, a higher Voc of 0.94 V was reported in solar cell devices. Besides high Voc, higher external quantum efficiency over the whole spectrum and higher hole mobility provided higher Jsc and FF. All these factors contributed to obtain a higher PCE of 5.69% for M15 with a TIPS substituent.
Replacing the alkoxy group with alkylthienyl has been demonstrated to be an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells.63 Lee and co-workers reported two-dimensional BDT and BT molecules for OFETs and organic solar cells.45 With similar optical band gaps, M17 showed lower HOMO and LUMO levels compared to M16. The difference between M16 and M12 was the octyl chain placed on thiophene. The change of the octyl chain on the structure caused steric hindrance along the backbone, thus disrupting the backbone conjugation. This could be explained by the significantly lower hole mobility measured from OFETs, as well as the crystallinity analysed from the XRD pattern. Even though a higher Voc was obtained for 2D M17, lower Jsc and FF led to a low PCE of 0.54%. Further structural modification was carried out using alkylthienyl substituted BDT and fBT. Li et al. synthesized M18, which could be discussed together with M14, due to the difference in substituents on BDT.46 Although a lower HOMO level was measured for M18, smaller Voc was attained when compared to M14 in solar cell devices. However, the overall photovoltaic performance of M18 is still better than that of M14 because of the improved Jsc and FF. Interestingly, the best performances came from the solar cell device that had only 25% PC71BM used in the light absorbing layer. A higher content of PC71BM in the blend created large aggregation domains, which was evidenced by TEM. Chen and co-workers revealed the effect of having ffBT as the acceptor unit in the molecular structure.47M19 and M20 had a similar absorption edge in chloroform solution, however, M20 showed a significantly larger red-shift in the film state, which indicated that stronger π–π stacking interactions existed. As previously discussed, ffBT in M20 resulted in lower HOMO levels. In terms of photovoltaic performance, a PCE of 4.17% was achieved when 0.5% (1,8-diiodooctane) DIO was used as an additive followed by thermal annealing at 70 °C for 10 minutes. For the molecules without fluorine, M19 showed a decent PCE of 3.17% under the same device fabrication conditions. The broader absorption, higher crystallinity and larger mobility of M20 contributed to the better device performance.
Palomares et al. also proposed two molecules with different substituents on the BDT unit, but with alkoxy substituted triphenylamine at two sides.48 When compared to the molecule ending with a hexyl bithiophene unit (M11), photovoltaic devices fabricated with M21 and PC71BM showed higher values in all four parameters, Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE. Further improvement was achieved by adding 4% DIO in the bulk solution, which yielded a PCE of 4.64%. M22, with an alkylthienyl substituent, exhibited an even better performance with a PCE of 6.13% when the same amount of DIO was used and subsequently thermally annealed. Wong and co-workers worked on three other molecules ending with the triphenylamine group.49M23, M24, and M25 had similar HOMO levels around −5.24 eV, while M26 showed a relatively higher one. Overall, molecules ending with triphenylamine outperformed molecules ending with thiophene in terms of higher Jsc and FF, which could be due to their relatively higher mobility.
Wei et al. proposed an oligomeric donor material consisting of BDT and ffBT.50M27 had the same building units as its polymer counterpart. By comparing the optical and electrochemical properties of this molecule with the corresponding polymer, a larger band gap and higher HOMO energy level were observed. Even though M27 lagged behind in terms of absorption and the energy level, the optimized photovoltaic performance is beyond the corresponding polymer with better FF. M27 displayed a high degree of molecular ordering as well as excellent phase separation when blended with PC71BM. This finding could help to design new molecular donor materials by breaking down polymers into their corresponding monomer units.
Dithienosilole (DTS) is another recognized donor unit developed for efficient photovoltaic devices because of its electron-donating property as well as its rigid conjugated structure.64,65 Bazan et al. synthesized several molecules with the central DTS unit while fBT was used as the acceptor. M28, known as p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, was first proposed in 2012 by replacing pyridyl[2,1,3]thiadiazole with fBT.66 The fluorine on BT imparted the symmetry of BT, so that site selective cross coupling could be achieved to have BT coupled with the hexyl bithiophene group. The single crystal of M28 obtained from chloroform through vapor diffusion revealed a planar conjugated backbone with almost no twisting. A planar conformation can facilitate intermolecular charge transport.75 The solar cell devices made from M28:PC71BM in the ratio of 1.5:1 yielded a PCE of 1.8%, with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 6.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 36 without any additive or treatment. When thermal annealing was applied to the device before metal deposition, a higher PCE of 5.8% was attained with improvement in Voc, Jsc and FF. Further modification was performed by adding 0.4 v/v% DIO into the bulk solution to prepare films followed by thermal annealing at 70 °C for 10 minutes, and a record high PCE of 7.0% was achieved for that time. Heeger and co-workers further improved the efficiency to 9.02% by using Barium as the cathode layer in device fabrication.76 Further investigation was carried out by extending the conjugation of the central DTS unit to silaindacenodithiophene (SIDT).67M29 containing SIDT had a broader absorption band gap compared to M28 with a lower HOMO level, which correlated well with photovoltaic results with smaller Jsc and larger Voc values. Interestingly, photovoltaic performance was less tolerant to the blend films containing different amounts of PC71BM, and effective carrier transport pathways existed over a wide range of compositions. The best photovoltaic performance was found with a 1 to 1 ratio, which gave a PCE of 6.4%. The molecular length was further extended with three DTS units employed while pyridyl[2,1,3]thiadiazole and BT were used as the acceptors.68 The extended molecule M30 resulted in a narrow band gap and elevated HOMO levels. A very close PCE of 6.5% was acquired with a Jsc of 15.2 mA cm−2 and a relatively low Voc of 0.66 V. Unlike M28 and M29, M30 was independent of the content of additives, which might be due to its strong crystallizing ability to separate from fullerene.77 So far, M28 has been widely used as the donor material for device optimization in different areas to achieve better photovoltaic performance.78–80
In addition to the donor units, IDT, BDT and DTS, which have been discussed above, some other donor units have also been used to build donor–acceptor molecules with BT for photovoltaic cells. Wang et al. used 2,7-carbazole as the electron donating unit for building molecules with either thiophene or alkyl cyanoacetate as the end groups.69 Both molecules M31 and M32 showed deep HOMO levels yielding higher Voc over 1 V in solar cell devices. The alkyl cyanoacetate end group in M32 allowed for broader absorption with a smaller optical band gap. The optimization of the devices with 0.2% DIO gave a PCE of 3.95%, in contrast to 1.64% for M31. M33 and M34 containing 5,10-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]indole as the central donor core were reported by Ko et al. recently.70 The fluorine atom reduced the HOMO level of M34 and resulted in a smaller band gap. The best photovoltaic performance was achieved after sequential thermal and solvent vapor annealing. These two treatments helped to increase the hole mobility, thus gaining a more balanced hole and electron transportation. M34 exhibited overall better performance with a higher PCE of 5.27% compared to 4.14% for M33. Lee et al. synthesized a naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT) unit as the central unit for M35 and M36.71M36 bearing triphenylamine with extended conjugation length offered significantly broader absorption as well as a higher absorption coefficient. The mobility of these two molecules was tested from OFETs with 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained for M36 while M35 did not exhibit any field effect mobility due to poor film quality. Considering the better light absorption and lower HOMO level, a higher PCE of 2.20% with a Voc of 0.95 V was attained for M36 in contrast to 0.98% for M35.
Complexation of electron-rich platinum into the conjugated backbone has been demonstrated to enhance intramolecular charge transport between donor and acceptor units, and thus broader absorption and a smaller band gap could be anticipated.96–98 Wong and co-workers reported four similar donor–acceptor molecules with central platinum as the donor moiety, while BT was used as the acceptor.72 With these four molecules, the triphenylamine ended molecules, M37–39, gave better photovoltaic performance than M40 in comparison, which is consistent with the results published by Lee's group as discussed above (M35 and M36). With varied positions of the thiophene unit along the molecular backbone, M37 and M38 showed a quite similar PCE of 2.35% with a relatively higher EQE value around 45% at 474 nm. However, removing the thiophene between platinum and BT caused a dramatic decrease of PCE to 1.45%, which was due to the significantly lower hole mobility of M39. In 2012, Cao et al. reported two molecules using porphyrin and BT with or without ethynylene as the bridge.73 Through theoretical calculations, ethynylene linked M41 had a planar conjugated structure with electrons delocalized in the whole molecules while conjugation was disrupted for M42 with BT almost perpendicular to the porphyrin unit. This difference caused a distinct discrepancy in absorption and mobility. M41 had an absorption edge at around 1000 nm while M42 was located at around 650 nm. In terms of the hole mobility, M41 exhibited a moderate hole mobility of 7.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was three orders of magnitude larger than that of M42. As a result, a PCE of 4.02% was obtained from the device fabricated from M41, while only 0.71% was attained for M42.
Star shaped M43 was published by Bo's group with a PCE of 2.05% in 2013.74 Choosing a planar conjugated triindole as the central donor unit, a three arm molecular donor material was synthesized through coupling with BT and ending with a triphenylamine group. This molecule showed HOMO and LUMO levels located at −5.12 eV and −3.30 eV with an optical band gap estimated from the absorption onset of 1.82 eV. The best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 2.05% was observed when the spin-cast film was annealed at 130 °C for 5 minutes to induce appropriate phase separation for charge separation and transportation.
Given the molecules discussed above, molecules comprised of a central donor and BT have shown great potential in photovoltaic devices with PCE over 8% achieved. Despite the donor units discussed above, other units such as benzodifuran, fluorene, etc. could also be considered with the appropriate molecular design.
2.2 Molecules with central acceptor units
Unlike donor–acceptor polymers with two units alternatingly arranged, molecular semiconducting materials can have either a donor unit or an acceptor unit at the center. In this section, the focus will be on molecules containing acceptor moieties, especially the BT unit located in the middle.
Wei and co-workers published their work in 2014 having ffBT sandwiched between oligothiophenes.81 Different numbers of thiophene units have been synthesized to systematically investigate the effect of the length of oligothiophene. With increasing number of thiophene units, the HOMO was elevated while the LUMO stayed similar. M44 and M45 were picked out for comparison in terms of optical and electrochemical properties, mobility and photovoltaic performance. An about 100 nm bathochromic shift was observed for M44 from solution to thin films with an evident shoulder peak in contrast to the 70 nm shift for M45. More condensed molecular packing of M44 was implied from UV-Vis absorption and further confirmed from XRD. Larger hole mobility as well as better photovoltaic performance was obtained for M44 with a PCE of 3.81%. Their study pointed out the importance of molecular length on their crystallinity and active layer morphology.
Wang et al. proposed two BT-triphenylamine based molecules with or without cyano groups on the π-bridge.82 Adding the cyano group was found to successfully lower the HOMO level and promote intermolecular interactions thus showing better absorption in the wavelength from 500 nm to 650 nm. Solar cell devices fabricated from M47 exhibited a high Voc of 1.04 V with a PCE of 3.85%, which was limited by low FF. A lower PCE of 1.99% was observed for the devices made from M46, with lower Jsc and Voc as the two main reasons. Studies of this type of material were further enriched by Li and co-workers by incorporating two other π-linkages, benzene and ethynylbenzene.83 Devices with optimized weight ratio resulted in higher PCEs of 4.84% and 3.40% for M47 and M46, respectively, compared to the work reported by Wang et al. Two new synthesized molecules, M48 and M49, displayed relatively lower photovoltaic performance and showed large dihedral angles between the linkage and triphenylamine. Such twisted conformation of these two molecules impaired π–π stacking, thus leading to lower hole mobility. It's noteworthy that having electro-withdrawing groups as the linkage, such as ethynylbenzene and 2-phenylacrylonitrile, could lower the HOMO level, so a higher Voc value could be expected.
Rao and co-workers had their focus on designing four D–π–A–π–D molecules featuring different π-linkage and donor units (M50–M53).84 All these four molecules showed a twisted conformation with thiophene linked molecules having smaller dihedral angles. The best performing devices were fabricated from M52 with the highest Voc of 0.96 V among all of these four molecules. Li and co-workers had continuous work on the molecules M54–M57, which are similar to M47 except for the removal of the alkoxy group and addition of the octyl chain on thiophene.85 Introducing a fluorine atom lowered the HOMO level and maintained a similar optical band gap when comparing M54 and M56, M55 and M57. Adding another 3-octyl thiophene on the backbone resulted in elevated HOMO levels, and thus a smaller band gap was observed comparing M54 and M55, M56 and M57. The higher hole mobility of M55 and M57 over the other two was mainly ascribed to their longer conjugation length, and thus in the solid state, stronger intermolecular interactions could exist and this was evidenced by a higher red-shift in the films. All of the factors stated above made M57, which had fluorine and additional thiophene, the best molecule for solar cell devices with a PCE of 4.86% among all these four molecules reported. M54, M56, M57 all exhibited a Voc above 1 V, derived from deep-low HOMO levels. Echegoyen et al. reported two molecules with the A1–D–A2–D–A1 structure with rhodamine and BT as acceptor moieties and with carbazole as the donor moiety.86M59 which contains an additional thiophene as a space group showed better photovoltaic performance in contrast to M58. This result matches well with previous work reported by Li's group, which was discussed before. The effect of the fluorine content on the BT unit was investigated by Ko's group in 2012.87 By varying the number of fluorine atoms, the HOMO decreased with increasing number of fluorine on the BT unit, while the optical band gap stayed constant. As noted from UV-Vis absorption, the monofluorinated molecule M61 had more intense absorption from 400 nm to 500 nm, which correlated well with relatively higher Jsc observed from solar cell devices. M61 also had the highest hole mobility of 6.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was about 3 and 1.5 times higher than those of M62 and M60. All of these factors contributed to the highest PCE of 2.95% obtained for M61 among these three molecules. M63, discussed with M30 in the same work done by Bazan's group, was assigned in this section because it has a BT unit in the middle flanked by two DTS units.68 Among all the molecules summarized here with central BT units, M63 exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with the highest achieved PCE of 5.8%. M63 showed high crystallinity in thin films and the mobility measured from OFETs is as high as 1.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 after thermal annealing. The branched molecule M64 bearing four cyanoacrylate electron-deficient groups was designed by Detrembleur et al.88M64 displayed poor photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 0.85% compared to the other molecules designed with an isoindigo unit at the center. Although M64 had the smallest optical band gap among the four reported molecules, inefficient photon to electron conversion limited its use as an effective donor molecule for solar cell devices.
There are some other molecules having other electron-accepting units in the molecular center, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), isoindigo (ID), and 4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD). Lee et al. proposed three separate BT molecules with different acceptors in the middle.89 These molecules were synthesized through the direct C–H arylation method with a yield around 60% for M65 and M66, and 37% for M67. The DPP centered molecule M65 showed significantly broader absorption with the onset at 962 nm. The estimated band gaps for M65, M66 and M67 were 1.29 eV, 1.51 eV, and 1.72 eV, respectively. All these molecules exhibited deep HOMO levels around −5.50 eV. Among the devices fabricated from these molecules in combination with PC71BM, the device with M66 revealed the best photovoltaic performance with the highest Jsc value measured among these three. Even though M66 had a broader absorption range, low photon to electron conversion efficiency restricted attaining a higher PCE. When compared to M65 and M66, the much lower Jsc value of M67 could be due to the missing continuous network in the blend films, which was revealed from the atomic force topology. Their design strategy can inspire the design of some other low band gap molecules for photovoltaic devices. Cao et al. reported several long conjugated molecular semiconductors having two acceptors, BT and DPP.90,91 At first, they studied the fluorination effect on the BT units. M68 and M69 had very similar absorption in UV-Vis spectra, as well as HOMO and LUMO levels measured from cyclic voltammetry. However, a significant difference was observed when these two molecules were used for solar cell devices. After optimization through vapor annealing, M69 showed a PCE of 5.4%, which was twice that of devices fabricated from M68. Thorough mobility investigation on the optimized blend films showed more balanced electron and hole transportation for M69, which led to a higher Jsc and FF measured from devices. Their results emphasized the impact of fluorine substituted BT on photovoltaic performance. Further study was done with careful structural modification on M69 and M70. In their design, thiophene was added between IDT and acceptor units to synthesize M71. The electron-deficient thiazole ring was used rather than thiophene to construct the DPP acceptor unit for M72. In their systematic investigations, even though the thiophene spacer resulted in higher HOMO levels, a smaller band gap was able to be acquired due to the extended conjugation length. M70 and M71 showed similar photovoltaic performance with the best PCE around 5.3%, while thiazole ring replaced M72 had the best device performance with a PCE of 7.0%. Solvent vapor annealing played a major role in device optimization by improving the PCE of M72 from 4.63% to 7.0%, which was mainly due to the high Jsc and FF. Through vapor annealing, reorganization happened in the blend films, which increased the intensity of absorption, as well as forming a bicontinuous network with balanced electron and hole transportation.
Sharma and co-workers focused on designing several unsymmetrical BT based molecules for BHJ solar cells.92,93 Synthesized M73 had triphenylamine and anthracene at the two ends as donor units, while BT and tetracyanobutadiene were used as acceptor units. M73 had a deep HOMO level of −5.56 eV with an optical band gap estimated to be 1.84 eV. A moderate PCE around 3.15% was measured from the device fabricated from THF solution with M73 blended with PC71BM at a ratio of 1 to 2. 3% CN added to improve the PCE from 3.15% to 4.61% with optimized phase separation created in the blend films. A continuous study on this unsymmetrical molecule was carried out by changing a donor unit, anthracene, to an acceptor unit, pyridine. The replacement caused extended absorption of M74 with an optical band gap estimated to be 1.69 eV. An even smaller band gap of 1.34 eV was found when a stronger electron-accepting unit, dicyanoquinodimethane, was used rather than tetracyanobutadiene. A high efficiency of 5.36% and 6.02% was obtained for these two molecules after sequential thermal and vapor annealing. The hole mobility was greatly improved after a two-step treatment, which resulted in higher Jsc, FF, and PCE. Ko et al. proposed three other unsymmetrical BT based molecules containing different numbers of fluorine atoms.94 Increasing FF content could decrease the HOMO level, and hence a higher Voc could be achieved. For molecules M76–78, the correlation between the fluorine content and HOMO level, also Voc was well verified. The highest Voc of 0.88 V was obtained for M78 while the lowest one of 0.82 V was measured for M76. The best photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 4.24% was observed for M78 due to the relatively higher Voc. The insertion of a TiOx layer between the active layer and metal electrode enhanced light absorption, and also a higher Voc and FF were achieved for all these three molecules. Yang and co-workers prepared M79 comprised of two acceptor units, BT and thiazolothiazole.95 A relatively low PCE of 1.64% for M79 might be due to an ineffective nano-scale phase separation, so there was not an interpenetrating network existing for the blend films, which could also explain the low Jsc of 5.11 mA cm−2 measured from the solar cell devices. Also the elevated HOMO level caused a small Voc of 0.66 V, and hence these factors limited the chance of obtaining a higher PCE for M79.
3. n-Type materials having BT units
n-Type molecules have been drawing attention as a potential replacement for fullerene derivatives. So far, a high PCE of over 9% for fullerene free organic photovoltaic devices has been reached.108–110 In contrast to fullerene derivatives, n-type polymer or molecular semiconductors have advantages such as strong absorption in the visible region, adjustable energy levels, and superior morphology stability. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PBT7) are two of the most used p-type materials in combination with the newly designed n-type materials in BHJ solar cell devices.
2-Vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazole was first used to synthesize n-type materials in 2007 by Sellinger's group. The photovoltaic device fabricated from P3HT:M80 bulk solution yielded a PCE of 0.45%, which was the highest reported PCE for non-fullerene based solar cells at that time.111,112 Ongoing work based on M80 was carried out by both Sellinger and Fréchet.99 P3HT and poly[3-(4-n-octyl)-phenylthiophene] (POPT) were synthesized via the Grignard metathesis polymerization method. Solar cell devices fabricated from POPT outperformed the P3HT one with a higher Jsc. Since these two blend films showed a similar phase separation domain size, the lower current for the P3HT set was probably due to germinate pair recombination. Similar to M80, M81 and M82, having different electron-accepting groups at their two sides, were synthesized and investigated by Sellinger and co-workers.100 In contrast to PC61BM and PC71BM, the smaller electron affinity of these materials indicated that a higher Voc was achieved. M82 had the best photovoltaic performance with the highest Voc of 0.96 eV, Jsc of 4.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 56. Notably, these molecules had complementary light absorption compared to P3HT in the visible region, and both p-type and n-type materials made contributions to the photocurrent.
Fréchet et al. synthesized four new molecules, and two acceptor units were linked by thiophene rather than vinylene.101 Two different alkyl chains were placed at the end of the molecules. Calculated from cyclic voltammetry, molecules with linear alkyl chains (M83 and M85) had higher lying HOMO and lower lying LUMO energy levels compared to those with branched alkyl chains (M84 and M86). In photovoltaic studies, these four molecules showed fairly high Voc values, with the highest value of 1.07 V obtained for M84. This was due to the large difference between the LUMO of these molecules and the HOMO of DPP-Py. A maximum PCE of 2.4% was accomplished from M85 with the highest Jsc of 3.72 mA cm−2 and FF of 60. Ethylhexyl substituted molecules showed a less ordered morphology than octyl substituted molecules confirmed from XRD. Such differences significantly affected the intermolecular packing, which further impacted the interpenetrating network of films prepared from molecule and DPP-Py blends for photovoltaic devices. Most well-ordered domains in blend films containing M85 were revealed from the distinct diffraction peaks in XRD, and this preferred nano-morphology of M85 blend films resulted in a better Jsc and FF. More importantly, more efficient charge carrier generation from n-type materials was demonstrated by EQE and photoluminescence studies. More efficient non-fullerene photovoltaic devices could be fabricated from properly choosing n-type and p-type materials.
Li and co-workers reported a photovoltaic device with a high Voc of 1.24 V prepared from M87 and SF8TBT blends.102 However, low Jsc limited achieving higher efficiency for M87. There was too small of a difference (0.05 eV) between the LUMO of M87 and SF8TBT caused by insufficient exciton dissociation at the interfaces. Bhosale et al. coupled two electron accepting units, BT and DPP to make M88.103 With appropriate energy level matching, P3HT was chosen as the p-type material. Despite a Voc as high as 1.08 V, the relatively low Jsc limited the highest PCE to 1.16%. The low hole and electron mobility accounted for the low Jsc and moderate PCE. Jo et al. continued work on M88 using PTB7 as the p-type material.104 A low PCE of 0.51% was obtained initially, which was further enhanced to 3.03% with 1% CN used as the additive in the bulk solution to optimize the film morphology. Fluorination of BT provided M90 with higher crystallinity than M89, and hence, fibril-like nanostructures with an interpenetrated network in blend films prepared from PTB7:M90 created carrier transporting channels. Higher electron mobility, as well as less bimolecular recombination for PTB7:M90 led to a high PCE of 5.00%. A rhodamine flanked n-type material was designed by McCulloch and co-workers in 2015.105 The synthesized molecule M91 had a nonplanar 3D structure with a dihedral angle of 33.7° calculated from the minimum energy conformation. The twisted structure reduced intermolecular interactions, thus resulting in an amorphous nature for M91. The photovoltaic performance was studied with P3HT used as the p-type material. The high LUMO energy level of M91 helped to achieve a high Voc. Even though higher photoluminescence quenching and electron mobility were observed, the intermixed system of P3HT and M91 caused faster geminate recombination compared to the PC61BM control group. The faster recombination rate caused a relatively low Jsc for P3HT:M91. In turn, amorphous M91 showed morphological stability under heating, without aggregation being observed, which was suitable for the inverted device structure over a long term. On the basis of M91, McCulloch et al. continued work by replacing fluorene with the IDT unit and synthesized two new non-fullerene acceptors containing different solubilizing alkyl chains.106 The extended conjugation of IDT in M92 and M93 planarized the molecular structure, and thus facilitated crystallization on optimum length scales, which was in favour of charge separation and extraction. Considering the alkyl chain effect, M92 with a linear chain had higher crystallinity compared to M93, which had a branched alkyl chain. In terms of photovoltaic performance, devices fabricated from M92 had relatively high Jsc while devices made from M93 showed better Voc and FF. In general, the best PCE of 6.4% was achieved for M92 with linear octyl side chains. Stability investigation of devices fabricated from M92:P3HT was carried out in an inverted architecture. Despite the small drop in PCE observed in first 60 hours the photovoltaic devices retained 73% of the initial PCE after 1200 hours, which was much better as compared to other highly performing donor polymer devices with PC70BM used as the n-type material. Recently, Aso et al. proposed various electron-accepting molecules (M94–M100) for the investigation of molecular orientation.107 The correlation between Jsc and London dispersion and polar components of their interfacial energies were well established. Crystallinity, influenced by terminal alkyl chains, had a significant impact on the photovoltaic performance. Molecules having bulky terminal groups showed less crystallinity in the solid state, and thus promoted charge separation occurring at the interface between p-type and n-type materials. Overall, the best PCE of 2.05% was obtained for M97 with a methyl-hexyl terminated group with a Jsc of 5.59 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 and a FF of 48, respectively.
4. Conclusion
Solution-processable molecular photovoltaic devices with the highest PCE over 10% have been reported. Molecular semiconductors built from BT or its fluorinated derivatives have demonstrated their potential in BHJ photovoltaics with PCE over 8% being achieved. Combining BT with some other donor units has been established to be an effective way to narrow the optical band gap to ensure obtaining a large absorption band. However, obtaining well-performing solar cell devices is more complicated than easily designing molecules with narrow band gaps. HOMO and LUMO energy levels, mobility, and nanoscale morphology also play major roles in device performance. Given the molecules discussed above, some initial conclusions have been obtained for future molecular design. First, fluorination has shown pronounced impact on photovoltaic performance. Lower HOMO levels of molecules were attained when built from fBT or ffBT, which could lead to higher Voc in solar cell devices. Except the changes in energy levels, the crystallinity and nanoscale morphology were also influenced by fluorination. Higher hole mobility, larger Jsc values and better FF were mostly observed for molecules constituted from fBT or ffBT units, which might be due to the preferred face-on ordering at the p-type and n-type materials interface in BHJ solar cells. Even with the fluorination effect on molecular orientation, the extraction and recombination of charge carriers have been considered in polymer BHJ solar cells, however its intrinsic effect has not been thoroughly investigated for small molecules yet.113,114 Secondly, different end group can cause divergent photovoltaic performance. Alkyl bithiophene and triphenylamine groups are mostly used for the molecules discussed above. The polarizability and dipole strength of the terminal groups can affect the molecular self-assembly. Thirdly, the bridges with different types of units and conjugation lengths connecting the donor and BT units can induce different physical properties in addition to inducing changes to the nanoscale morphology. Depending on the bridge used, there can be twisting in the conformation of the structure which can further affect the properties of the molecule including the crystallinity, absorption, and charge carrier mobility. Finally, the position of BT units in these molecules plays a significant role as well. There are two options available for the design of the molecules, either with BT as the central unit or with the donor as the center. The placement of these units can influence the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, as well as optical absorption.
The structure–physical property relationship could be roughly speculated from theoretical calculations, however the morphology of the blend films (molecules and PC71BM) is hard to predict. The morphology has significance in the performance of the solar cell device. Achieving appropriate nanoscale phase separation and optimal domain size is ideal in improving the Jsc and FF. There are some methods that can be applied to finely tune the morphology such as using additives, thermal annealing or vapor annealing. In the case of vapor annealing, selecting an appropriate solvent and the exposure time are vital to gain higher PCE.
In addition to the p-type materials built from BT units, n-type materials containing BT units also show promise to replace traditional fullerene derivatives in photovoltaic devices. A PCE as high as 6.4% has been achieved for M92:P3HT. Having absorption in the visible region and a relatively higher LUMO level makes these n-type materials more attractive than fullerene derivatives. Three-dimensional molecules with little twisted conformation will be beneficial for non-anisotropic electron transportation. Also the amorphous nature caused by the twisted structure can prevent aggregation happening over time.
The examples discussed above show that BT or its derivatives can be effective electron-withdrawing units for building both p-type and n-type materials. Easy synthesis and purification of BT and its derivatives enables applying this unit in more BT-based molecules with tunable properties to achieve even better photovoltaic performance. The further exploration of BT-based molecules is still needed. Fine-tuning the molecular structures can prompt further improvement in the photovoltaic field.
