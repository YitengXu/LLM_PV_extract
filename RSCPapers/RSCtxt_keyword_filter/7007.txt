Such Au/TiO2 BNR composites exhibit high photocatalytic activity in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The unique structure of Au/TiO2 BNRs shows enhanced activity with a photocurrent of 0.125 mA cm−2 under visible light (≥420 nm) and 2.32 ± 0.1 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The obtained photocurrent is comparable to the highest value ever reported. Furthermore, the Au/TiO2 BNRs achieve the highest efficiency of ∼1.27% at a low bias of 0.50 V vs. RHE, indicating elevated charge separation and transportation efficiencies. The high PEC performance is mainly due to the plasmonic effect of Au nanoparticles, which enhances the visible light absorption, together with the large surface area, efficient charge separation and high carrier mobility of the TiO2 BNRs. The carrier density of Au/TiO2 BNRs is nearly 6 times higher than the pristine TiO2 BNRs as calculated by the Mott–Schottky plot. Based on the analysis by UV-Vis spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence, a mechanism was proposed to explain the high activity of Au/TiO2 BNRs in PEC water splitting. The capability of synthesizing highly visible light active Au/TiO2 BNR based photocatalysts is useful for solar conversion applications, such as PEC water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells and photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been widely regarded as one of the most promising routes for hydrogen generation in the near future since it was firstly discovered using a TiO2 electrode in 1972.1 Semiconductor metal oxides, such as TiO2,2–5 ZnO,6,7 Fe2O3,8–11 WO312–14 and composite semiconductors,15,16 offer a promising way for clean and environmentally friendly production of hydrogen. Among various semiconductors, TiO2 is one of the most promising photocatalysts due to its excellent properties such as low cost, innocuity, and excellent chemical- and photo-stability. Furthermore, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes, can facilitate charge transport and reduce the recombination of electron–hole pairs by providing a direct conduction pathway for the photogenerated electrons.17 However, 1D nanostructures of photocatalytic materials typically have an insufficient surface area and poor light harvesting efficiency. Consequently, three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured photoanodes have recently received significant attention due to unique characteristics such as large surface area, efficient charge separation and high carrier mobility, which are beneficial for PEC water splitting.18 Additionally, single crystalline branched TiO2 nanorod arrays (TiO2 BNRs) can result in an increased surface area and enhanced electron conductivity for improved photocurrent harvesting efficiencies. Zheng and co-workers19 have recently reported on the synthesis of branched TiO2 nanorods and evaluated their photoelectrochemical properties for water splitting; they have shown that the photocurrent increased to 0.83 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE, nearly twice higher than that of bare TiO2 NRs. Sun et al.20 have synthesized a forest-like TiO2 hierarchical structure for dye-sensitized solar cells; it was shown that the nanoforest films demonstrated 61.9% higher efficiency than those made using nanorod arrays.
One of the major drawbacks that TiO2 suffers from is its large band gap (3.0–3.2 eV), which means that only UV light can be absorbed. Since the UV region only accounts for 5% of the whole solar radiation reaching the earth, it is crucial to make efficient use of the visible light.21 Doping with metals as well as nonmetallic elements, such as N,22 C23 and S, and sensitizing with quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used to overcome the lack of visible light response of TiO2. Recently, the photosensitization of TiO2 with noble metals (e.g., Ag and Au NPs) has attracted much attention. Gold is a noble metal that does not undergo corrosion during the photoreaction; it can strongly interact with light in the visible and infrared region due to its extraordinary localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties.24 SPR is collective oscillation of conduction band electrons in a metal particle driven by the electromagnetic field of incident light.25 Specifically, supported Au NPs can also absorb UV light via electron interband transitions from 5d to 6sp.26 Significant efforts have been made for the design and assembly of plasmonic Au–TiO2 nanostructures for solar water splitting. Garcia and co-workers27 have synthesized gold nanoparticles supported on P25 titania and tested their photocatalytic activity for UV and visible light, and they discussed the mechanism of the electron transfer between Au and TiO2. Recently, Wang et al.28 have also used plasmonic gold nanocrystals coupled to photonic crystals seamlessly on TiO2 nanotubes for visible light PEC water splitting; they have shown that the photocurrent could reach 2.25 mA cm−2 under entire solar irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Additionally, Tsai and co-workers29 tested the plasmonic Au/TiO2 powder catalyst for hydrogen production from solar water splitting, and they discussed the SPR effect via simulation.
Several investigations regarding photocatalytic water splitting over the conventional Au–TiO2 system have been reported.27–31 However, three-dimensional hierarchical TiO2 BNRs possess a highly efficient electron transfer pathway, and high surface area to increase the interface with the electrolyte which is beneficial for light harvesting. Au nanoparticles can highly improve the photocatalytic activity of the Au/TiO2 system in the visible light region due to the strong SPR effect. As the Fermi level of Au is lower than that of TiO2, in the UV region, a photogenerated electron in the TiO2 conduction band can be readily transferred to the surface of Au, thereby significantly reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs. This paper describes the design of 3D hierarchical TiO2 branched-nanorod arrays sensitized with Au nanoparticles for enhanced PEC water splitting, especially an enhanced photoelectrochemical response in the visible region. The surface morphology, composition, crystal structure and optical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical properties were tested and the mechanism of electron transfer was also deeply discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to synthesize a 3D Au/TiO2 BNR heterostructure to be used in PEC water splitting.
Experimental section
Materials
Titanium butoxide (99.0%) and gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, ≥49%) were supplied by J&K Scientific Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36.5–38.0 wt%), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99.5%), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, 99.0%), acetone (GR) and ethanol (GR) were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute without further treatment prior to use. FTO substrates (F:SnO2, 14 Ω per square) were supplied by Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan, and before using, the FTO substrate was ultrasonically cleaned for 20 min each in deionized water, ethanol, and acetone, respectively.
Synthesis of TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs
Preparation of TiO2 BNRs. Synthesis of TiO2 BNRs on FTO substrates involves two steps—synthesis of TiO2 NRs on FTO substrates and synthesis of the TiO2 branched nanostructure. The synthesis of TiO2 NRs using a facile hydrothermal method has been described previously.32 Briefly, 30 mL of deionized water and 30 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5–38.0 wt%) were mixed and stirred for 5 min, then 1 mL of titanium butoxide was added dropwise to the mixed solution. After stirring for another 5 min, 5 mL of a NaCl aqueous solution (5 M) was added to the solution and then the mixture was stirred for another 5 min. The solution was averagely transferred to three Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves (50 mL), where a FTO substrate (5 × 1 cm2) was placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner with the conducting side facing down. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 14 h, followed by flowing water cooling to room temperature. Afterwards, the FTO substrate was taken out, rinsed with deionized water and dried in ambient air.TiO2 BNRs were prepared using a simple aqueous chemical growth method. FTO firstly coated with the TiO2 NRs was immersed in a TiCl4 solution (0.2 M), which was prepared by mixing TiCl4 and ice, at 25 °C for 18 h, followed by rinsing with pure ethanol. Then the TiO2 BNRs were dried at 80 °C and annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min.

Preparation of Au/TiO2 BNRs. A photoreduction method was used to deposit Au nanoparticles on TiO2 BNRs. Briefly, 1 mL of aqueous HAuCl4 (0.3 mM) was dispersed with 100 mL of deionized water in a pyrex Petri dish, then the TiO2 BNRs grown on the FTO substrate were floated in the Petri dish and the solution was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp for 6 h to reduce the Au3+ to Au0. The HAuCl4 concentration and irradiation time were optimized to fabricate Au nanoparticles with a size less than 10 nm.
Characterization
The morphology and microstructure of the sample were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi S-4800, 5 kV). Elemental analysis was carried out by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) at 15 kV. TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope at 200 kV. Prior to the measurements, the branched nanoarrays were detached from the FTO substrate and ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol, and dipped onto a copper grid with a lacey carbon film and dried under ambient conditions.
The crystal structure of the sample was investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX-2500) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5416 Å) at 40 kV and 140 mA. XRD spectra were collected over a 2θ range of 20–80° at a scanning speed of 0.02° per step. Optical transmittance measurements of pristine TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs were performed using a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the materials was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 1600 ESCA system using an Al Kα X-ray source (E = 1486.6 eV). The catalysts were pressed into flakes and were pre-reduced at 550 °C for 2 h. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (HITACHI F-4500) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm.
Photoelectrochemical tests. Photocurrent measurements of TiO2 NRs, TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNR electrodes were performed using a three-electrode configuration, with the nanostructured materials (TiO2 NRs, TiO2 BNRs, or Au/TiO2 BNRs) as the working electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and platinum foil (2 × 2 cm2) as the counter electrode. A 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. An electrochemical workstation (IVIUM CompactStat) was used to measure current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the electrode, with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The illuminated area of the working electrode was about 1 cm2. In order to obtain simulated sunlight, a 300 W xenon lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Lt, LS-SXE300CUV) equipped with AM 1.5 filters was used as the light source, and the power intensity of the light is 100 mW cm−2. Before photocurrent measurements, the electrolyte was purged with N2 for 1 h to remove the oxygen in the electrolyte.Amperometric I–t photoresponse was evaluated under chopped light irradiation (light on or off cycles: 60 s) at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE (the photoconversion efficiency reached the maximum value at this potential as will be shown later on) with a filter that cuts light with wavelengths ≥420 nm. The intensity of light was 100 mW cm−2. The stability test was evaluated under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE for 5 h.
Impedance measurements were performed in the dark and under entire solar spectra illumination (100 mW cm−2) in 0.05 M Na2SO4 solution at open circuit voltage over a frequency range from 105 to 10−1 Hz with an AC voltage at 10 mV. The Mott–Schottky plots were obtained at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz in the dark.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Fig. 1a shows an illustrative scheme regarding the synthetic procedure of Au/TiO2 BNRs. Fig. 1b and e show typical FESEM images of TiO2 NRs grown directly on FTO substrates. The NRs containing many step edges were tetragonal in shape with an average diameter of 150–200 nm and surface density of about 2 × 107 NRs per cm2. The cross-sectional image (Fig. 1b) indicates that TiO2 NRs are smooth and grown perpendicular to the FTO substrate, and the length is about 2.4 μm. Upon the treatment of TiO2 NRs with a TiCl4 solution via an aqueous chemical growth method, 3D TiO2 BNRs were obtained as shown in Fig. 1c and f. The TiO2 NRs were decorated with numerous secondary nanostructures uniformly and displayed a branched feature. The whole TiO2 NRs were enclosed by TiO2 nanobranched structures with a diameter of 10–20 nm, which greatly improves the specific surface area of TiO2 NRs. Upon photoreduction of Au on TiO2 branches, the morphology of TiO2 BNRs does not significantly change due to the small particle size of Au (Fig. 1d and g and S1†). In order to determine the existence of Au nanoparticles and the Au-to-TiO2 ratio in Au/TiO2 BNRs, a SEM element mapping image of Ti, O, Au and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed (Fig. S2 and S3†). Fig. S2† shows the cross-section SEM element mapping of different elements in Au/TiO2 BNRs. From the element distribution of Au, it is clear that Au was homogenously deposited on TiO2 BNRs, especially on the TiO2 branches, which could be further verified by TEM. Quantitative EDS analysis (Fig. S3†) indicates that the weight ratio of Au to TiO2 is 1.94% in the Au/TiO2 BNRs.

In order to determine the size of Au nanoparticles, further structure characterization was conducted using TEM. Fig. 2 shows TEM and HRTEM images of the TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs. It is known that the TiO2 backbone NRs prepared by the hydrothermal method used in this study can be single-crystalline tetragonal-rutile TiO2, which has been reported previously.32 As shown in Fig. 2a, a three-dimensional nanostructure with branches was grown along the backbone of the TiO2 NRs. The diameter and length of the TiO2 branches were 10–20 nm and 60–80 nm, respectively. Fig. 2b shows a corresponding HRTEM image of the TiO2 branches, indicating good crystallinity of the materials. The observed lattice spacing of 0.32 nm corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of the tetragonal-rutile phase. Fig. 2c shows a TEM image of Au/TiO2 BNRs, which shows that the Au nanoparticles were homogenously deposited on the TiO2 branches with an average diameter of 6.5 ± 0.5 nm. The HRTEM image of Au/TiO2 shows well resolved (110) lattice fringes (d = 0.32 nm) of rutile TiO2 as well as Au (200) lattice (d = 0.20 nm) features.

The phase structure of our materials was determined by XRD patterns (Fig. 3). It indicates that FTO substrates have a tetragonal rutile phase of SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445). All the peaks can be attributed to the tetragonal TiO2 with the rutile phase (JCPDS 21-1276). Additionally, no diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 were found in Fig. 3b, indicating that the TiO2 BNRs are single phase rutile. We also note that in Fig. 3c a small peak was observed at 44.6°, which can be attributed to Au particles (JCPDS 01-1172) dispersed on the surface of TiO2 branches.

Furthermore, XPS was employed to analyze the specific surface composition of the TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs to acquire information on the interaction of Au with TiO2. The survey spectra of the TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs can be found in Fig. S4.† As presented in Fig. 4a, the two peaks at 458.5–458.7 eV and 464.2 eV could be assigned to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p5/2 spin–orbit components of Ti4+. Moreover, the Ti 2p3/2 peaks are located at 458.5 and 458.7 eV, with a small shift of 0.2 eV from TiO2 BNRs to Au/TiO2 BNRs, which reveals the electron transfer between Au and TiO2.33 Fig. 4b displays the O 1s XPS spectra, the binding energy at 529.9 eV could be assigned to O2− in the TiO2 lattice, the O 1s shoulder at 531.2 eV could be assigned to the Ti–OH.34 The binding energy of Au 4f7/2 at 83.2 eV in Fig. 4c could be attributed to the metallic gold Au0. The relative negative shift (0.8 eV) of the Au 4f7/2 peak in comparison to bulk Au (4f7/2 at 84.0 eV) is observed, which could be due to the electron transfer from oxygen vacancies of TiO2 to Au, leading to a lower binding energy of Au 4f7/2 in Au/TiO2 BNRs.35

The light absorption range of TiO2 NRs, TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs was determined by UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 5). The spectra of TiO2 NRs and TiO2 BNRs show that they absorb mainly in the UV range with a wavelength below 410 nm due to their large band gap (rutile TiO2 ∼ 3.0 eV). Compared with TiO2 NRs, TiO2 BNRs can absorb more light due to the presence of branched TiO2 and light reflected between the TiO2 branches attached on the NRs.36 As Au particles are attached on the TiO2 branched nanostructure, the Au/TiO2 BNRs show strong absorption of visible light at 534 nm, which was caused by the surface plasmon resonance of small Au nanoparticles. Also the UV light absorption was strengthened due to the band gap transition of the TiO2 semiconductor.27

Photoelectrochemical properties
To further investigate the PEC performance of Au nanoparticles decorated TiO2 BNRs, a set of linear-sweep voltammograms for TiO2 NRs, TiO2 BNRs, and Au/TiO2 BNRs were attained (Fig. 6a). The dark current from −0.8 V to 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) of each sample was almost zero. The photocurrent of TiO2 NRs is 0.13 mA cm−2, which is smaller than the reported results by Yang and co-workers.37 However, the photocurrent of NRs can be affected by several factors such as the differences in lengths and diameters of the NRs, the surface areas, and the degree of the aggregation at the base of the NRs. For the TiO2 BNRs, the photocurrent intensity is 1.13 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. It also provides good evidence that the branched nanostructure has stronger light absorbance and more efficient charge separation and collection than the NRs.38 The photocurrent of Au/TiO2 NRs is 0.61 mA cm−2 with a significant enhancement compared with TiO2 NRs. The result indicates that the Au nanoparticles have played a very important role in the photocatalytic reaction. Compared with TiO2 BNRs, the Au/TiO2 BNRs showed a pronounced photocurrent of 2.32 ± 0.1 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is more than two times larger than the pristine TiO2 BNRs, suggesting that the decoration of Au nanoparticles promoted the light harvesting. There are few reports on the Au/TiO2 photoelectrode system in PEC water splitting; the photocurrent of our Au/TiO2 BNRs is significantly higher than that of Au/TiO2 photoelectrodes with different morphologies reported previously under similar measurement conditions.28,39,40 A low photocurrent onset and saturation bias are extremely important to achieve a higher efficiency of PEC hydrogen generation. Additionally, we have acquired the solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiencies according to eqn (1):41 
η = I(1.23 − V)/Plight
(1)where I is the photocurrent density at the measurement applied bias, V is the applied bias (vs. RHE), and Plight is the incident light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). In 1 M KOH electrolyte, the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential can be converted from the Ag/AgCl reference electrode as: RHE = V(Ag/AgCl) + 1.0 V.22,42,43 Fig. 6b shows the calculated STH efficiencies of different samples versus the applied bias. The TiO2 BNRs exhibit an optimal conversion efficiency of ∼0.49% at 0.61 V vs. RHE, whereas the Au/TiO2 BNRs exhibit the highest efficiency of ∼1.27% at a low bias of 0.50 V vs. RHE.

The TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNR photoelectrodes were further tested under on–off cycle illumination conditions to determine whether the measured photocurrent was associated with the absorption of light. Fig. 6c shows the photocurrent generated under visible light irradiation of TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs. The photocurrent of TiO2 BNRs (0.002 mA cm−2) is nearly equal to the dark current, indicating that TiO2 has no response in the visible light region. Upon illumination, a photocurrent of 0.125 mA cm−2 was observed in Au/TiO2 BNRs which strengthened the PEC performance in the visible light region, as well as indicating the existence of the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles on Au/TiO2 BNRs. Indeed, previous investigations have revealed that the mechanisms of energy-transfer in plasmonic photocatalysts involve several types: (i) charge transfer between metal and oxide (so-called hot electron–hole pairs); (ii) scattering and anti-reflection effects; and (iii) plasmon-induced heating and (iv) near-field electromagnetic enhancement.44–46 However, scattering and anti-reflection effects often occur in the plasmonic-metal with particle sizes larger than 100 nm,45 which can be eliminated from our Au/TiO2 BNRs due to the much smaller particle size of Au. Furthermore, the plasmon-induced heating energy is smaller than the energy required to induce water splitting (at least 1.23 eV). The near-field electromagnetic enhancement was observed at wavelengths where the plasmon resonance and semiconductor absorption overlap.31 Therefore, we deduce that the hot electron transfer between Au nanoparticles and TiO2 should be the major contributor in our system. Also as shown in Fig. 6c, under illumination, a spike in the photo-response was observed owing to the transient effect during the excitation, and the photocurrent rapidly returned to a steady state. This also verifies that the photogenerated electrons are rapidly transported from Au nanoparticle to the TiO2 branched nanostructure, and then to the FTO substrate through the TiO2 backbone.
Fig. 6d shows the photoresponse of Au/TiO2 BNRs over a long time to further confirm the stability of the structure. It shows that under illumination with light, the photocurrent of Au/TiO2 BNRs was almost steady during 5 h, and after 5 h the photocurrent was almost 2.2 mA cm−2. The achieved high efficiency and good stability indicate that the Au/TiO2 BNRs still retain the original structure after long term PEC water splitting reactions.
We have further probed the interfacial properties between the photoelectrode and the electrolyte. Fig. 7a displays the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the Nyquist plot, a semicircle (i.e., the arch in the present study) at high frequency represents the charge-transfer process, and the diameter of the semicircle reflects the charge-transfer resistance. Obviously, the diameters of the semicircle for Au/TiO2 BNRs both in the dark and light were much smaller than those of TiO2 BNRs, indicating that the Au nanoparticles can enhance the electron mobility by reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Additionally, we have conducted the Mott–Schottky experiments for the TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs, as shown in Fig. 7b. Both the TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs show a positive slope in the Mott–Schottky plots, as expected for the n-type semiconductor. Importantly, the Au/TiO2 BNRs show substantially smaller slopes of the Mott–Schottky plot compared to TiO2 BNRs, suggesting a faster charge transfer. In addition, the carrier density Nd can be calculated from the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot using eqn (2):40 
Nd = (2/e0εε0) [d(1/C2)/dV]−1
(2)where e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of rutile TiO2, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, Nd is the carrier density and V is the applied bias at the electrode. As e0 = 1.6 × 10−19 C, ε0 = 8.86 × 10−12 F m−1 and ε = 170 for rutile TiO2,47 the calculated carrier densities of TiO2 BNRs and Au/TiO2 BNRs were 2.83 × 1017 and 1.67 × 1018 cm−3, respectively. It is a fact that the Mott–Schottky plot is derived from a flat electrode model and may have errors in determining the absolute value of carrier density.40 However, the higher Nd of Au/TiO2 BNRs signified a faster carrier transfer than TiO2 BNRs, and thus an enhanced PEC performance.48

To confirm the capability of charge separation by Au nanoparticles attached on TiO2, the PL spectra are shown in Fig. 7c. PL spectra are often used to study the surface processes involving electron–hole recombination of semiconductors.49 The broad-band emission around 410 nm (excited at 325 nm) can be assigned to the recombination of photoexcited holes with electrons occupying the singly ionized oxygen vacancies in TiO2.50 The intensity of PL spectra in Au/TiO2 BNRs largely decreased, indicating that the recombination of electron–hole pairs has been suppressed deeply.
Based on these results, we have proposed a mechanism of electron transfer between the Au/TiO2 BNRs as shown in Scheme 1. Under UV light illumination, TiO2 was photoexcited to generate electrons and holes, and the photogenerated electrons present in the TiO2 conduction band are transferred to the surface of Au nanoparticles. Due to the different work functions of Au and TiO2, a Schottky barrier was created as a trap for electrons, reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs, thus enhancing the activity of the photocatalyst. In the visible region, Au nanoparticles attached on TiO2 act as sensitizers, absorbing resonant photons, generating hot electrons from the SPR excitation, and injecting the hot electrons to the conduction band of the TiO2 branched nanostructure, and then to the FTO substrate through the TiO2 backbone. Finally, the electrons were transferred to the Pt electrode to reduce water and generate hydrogen. As a result, Au nanoparticles attached on TiO2 BNRs could increase the photocurrent intensity under illumination of the entire solar spectrum.

Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized Au nanoparticles attached 3D branched TiO2 nanorods and examined their characteristics as a photoanode for PEC water splitting. The Au/TiO2 BNR photoanode materials not only enhance the light-harvesting efficiency by the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles but also suppress the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus enhancing the overall water-splitting reaction. Our Au/TiO2 photocatalysts yielded a high photocurrent of 2.32 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is nearly two times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 BNRs. The distance between the TiO2 BNRs could be an important factor to tune the PEC performance, which deserves further investigation. We anticipate that a judicious combination of 3D single-crystalline TiO2 BNRs and Au nanoparticles will open up new opportunities in various areas, including PEC water splitting, photocatalysis, and dye sensitized solar cells. More importantly, the Au and TiO2 model system studied here could be extended to other semiconductors such as branched ZnO, NiO, and SnO251 as well as hierarchical heterostructures36 for solar conversion applications.
