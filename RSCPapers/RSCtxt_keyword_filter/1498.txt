    , Accepted 20th March 2020First published on 23rd March 2020AbstractThe electronic structure of a compound plays a key role in its functionality and hence its applications. The core-level X-ray spectroscopy technique at the metal L-edge is widely used for probing the valence electronic structure. The X-ray spectral features in the metal L-edge energy regime are usually complicated by a multitude of interactions, which make them challenging to interpret. The X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) and the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra in the cobalt L-edge energy regime of tris(2,2′-bipyridine) cobalt compounds [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ are calculated using an ab initio restricted active space (RAS) approach. The experimental spectra are nicely reproduced and their spectral features are interpreted in terms of the orbital contributions and the final-state contributions. Unbiased assignments on the spin state of the ground state of these two cobalt compounds have been critically assessed through valence-excited state calculations and the fingerprints of the X-ray spectral features together with the calculations of the branching ratio.
1. Introduction
CobaltII/III polypyridyl compounds are attractive choices to serve as redox shuttles in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to the tunability of their redox potential.1,2 A key feature of these cobalt compounds is that the spin change from a low-spin singlet (CoIII) to high-spin quartet (CoII) can produce a large inner-sphere reorganization energy. This barrier can result in very slow electron self-exchange kinetics and slow recombination kinetics at TiO2 electrodes.2 A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13% was reported using a donor–π-bridge–acceptor ZnII-porphyrin dye (coded SM315) in conjunction with cobalt tris(2,2′-bipyridine) compounds [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+.3 Right now, cobalt redox mediators are the most efficient redox couple for DSSCs, and there is still ample room for improvement. In addition to its applications,2–4 the intrinsic appeal of cobalt tris(2,2′-bipyridine) has stimulated many extensive investigation on its fundamental properties as prototypical systems.5
Even though the ‘bpy’ ligand is generally considered as a strong ligand, [CoII(bpy)3]2+ is recognized as a high-spin compound with a 4T1 ground state (t2g5eg2) in solution or as a simple salt.6 The low-spin ground state (t2g6eg1) [CoII(bpy)3]2+ can be obtained when incorporated into the cavities of zeolite-Y or when incorporated into a three-dimensional oxalate network,7–9 the compound can turn into a spin-crossover system. The spin crossover from high spin to low spin is attributed to the increased ligand field strength with decreased metal–ligand bond length.6 Upon allocation of one electron from the anti-bonding eg orbital to the non-bonding t2g orbital, the metal–ligand bond lengths will be compressed.6 [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is best prepared through chemical or electrochemical oxidation of [CoII(bpy)3]2+,10–12 and the ground state of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is assigned to a low-spin singlet (t2g6eg0).11 The electronic structures (e.g., metal–ligand bonding interaction, charge transfer between the metal and ligand orbitals, and spin-state) of these cobalt compounds play a crucial role in determining their functionality. For better understanding of the functionality and hence the applications of those cobalt compounds, knowledge of the electronic structure is required.
Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy XAS at the metal L-edge originates from exciting a metal 2p electron to the singly occupied and unoccupied valence metal-3d character orbitals; it enables the electronic structures of metal-based complexes to be determined and also provides information about the covalency of molecular orbitals by analysis of the absorption intensity.13 Metal L-edge XAS is usually sensitive to the oxidation state, spin state and ligand field, which makes it an important tool for electronic structure analysis of materials. However, the spectral features are shaped by spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in both core 2p and valence 3d orbitals, charge transfer, and multiplet effects, which make the spectrum challenging to interpret. The complicated spectral features lacking a well-defined theoretical model could lead to expectation bias in the assignment and interpretation. The resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of aqueous solution cobalt tris(2,2′-bipyridine) complexes [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ have been recently experimentally measured at the Co L-edge.14 The Co L-edge spectra have been interpreted through individual spin-state spectrum calculations using the density functional theory restricted open-shell configuration interaction single (DFT/ROCIS) method.15 The calculations revealed 40% doublet and 60% quartet state components for the [CoII(bpy)3]2+ ground state, and 80% singlet and 20% quintet state components for [CoIII(bpy)3]3+.14 The deviation in assignment of the spin state of the ground state has triggered our interest to revisit this couple of CoII/III compounds. In the current work, we have employed an ab initio restricted active space (RAS) approach to simulate the cobalt metal L-edge XAS and RIXS of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ compounds, and the focus of this project would be interpretations of the experimental X-ray spectral features and revisiting their electronic structures. The applications of the RAS approach for metal L-edge XAS and 2p3d RIXS have shown its validity on 3d transition metal complexes.16–27 The X-ray spectral features have been interpreted through investigating the core-excited (CE) state contributions, orbital contributions and the branching ratios of the cobalt L-edge XAS, and the valence-excited (VE) state contributions to the 2p3d RIXS. This will also be helpful to understand the valence electronic structures of other cobalt-based functional systems with more clarity.
2. Computational details
Calculations of molecular systems have been performed on ground-state geometries optimized using density functional theory (DFT)28,29 with functional B3LYP30 and the 6-311G(d) basis set using Gaussian 09.31 The key geometric parameters are available in Table S1.† The optimized structures are similar to previously calculated32 ones and have small deviations in the Co–N bond length from the experimental structure.33,34 The deviations in the Co–N bond-length for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ are slightly larger than those in [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, which can be due to the limitation of the DFT method on open-shell systems with near-degenerate states.35 Moreover, the structural deviations from the experiment can also come from the choices of the basis set and functional, and the solvent effects. We can expect that the multi-configurational method can give a relatively more reasonable structure description for systems with degenerate states, while the computational cost of multi-configurational geometry optimization has motivated us to use DFT geometry here.
The valence-excited (VE) states of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ with different spin states have been calculated. In the valence excited state calculation, the five metal 3d character orbitals together with two ligand-character σ donation orbitals and three empty orbitals of π symmetry are selected; this gives complete active space (CAS) with eleven electrons in ten active orbitals CAS(11,10) and ten electrons in ten active orbitals CAS(10,10) for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, respectively. The energy differences in these valence excited states have been checked with basis sets ANO-RCC-VDZP and ANO-RCC-VTZP. The completed active space calculations have been performed using OpenMolcas.36
For the calculations of X-ray spectra, the core orbitals are added in the active space. The active space used for spectra calculations could be designated as RAS (n, l, m; i, j, k), where i, j, and k are the number of orbitals in RAS1, RAS2, and RAS3 spaces respectively, n is the total number of electrons in the active space, l is the maximum number of holes allowed in RAS1, and m is the maximum number of electrons in RAS3. For the cobalt L-edge XAS calculation, the three Co 2p core orbitals are placed in the RAS1, the orbitals in the RAS2 are the same as the valence excited state calculation, and the active space of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ together with selected active orbitals (the complete sets of the valence orbitals are available in Fig. S1†) is shown in Fig. 1; this gives active space RAS(17,1,0;3,10,0) and RAS(16,1,0;3,10,0) for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, respectively. For the RIXS spectra calculations, the lowest 40 quartet and 10 doublet valence-excited states are included for the [CoII(bpy)3]2+. The lowest 50 singlet, 45 triplet and 5 quintet valence-excited states are included for the [CoIII(bpy)3]3+. These valence-excited states are metal-centered states only and the numbers are determined using Weyl's formula considering the seven and six electrons in five metal 3d orbitals for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, respectively.
 Fig. 1  The RAS active space for cobalt L-edge XAS and RIXS calculation of the [CoII(bpy)3]2+ compound, selected valence orbitals from RAS ground state calculation are shown, and the complete sets of the valence orbitals are available in Fig. S1.† There is one electron less for [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, and the t2g orbitals are doubly occupied. 
The core-excited (CE) state wavefunction optimizations have been performed using the state average (SA) formalism,37 which means that the same orbitals are used for all states of a specific spin and symmetry. To reach the CE state, a novel projection technique called highly excited state (HEXS) is utilized;38–40 it sets to zero the configuration-interaction coefficients of configuration state functions with doubly occupied core-orbitals, and thus effectively projects them out of the wavefunction. Scalar relativistic effects have been included by using a second-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess Hamiltonian,41,42 in combination with the ANO-RCC basis set and the use of a Cholesky decomposition approach to approximate the two-electron integrals.43–45 For information on the dependency on the basis set (ANO-RCC-VDZ and ANO-RCC-VDZP) and number of final states, see e.g. Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI.† Overall, the expanded basis set has a negligible effect on the spectral shape, see Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The dependence on the numbers of core-excited states shows that the spectral feature of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ converges slower than [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, see Fig. S3.† The inclusion of dynamical correlation through second-order perturbation theory (RASPT2) calculations has been carried out on the XAS of the [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ compound, and the spectrum is presented in Fig. S4.† The inclusion of the RASPT2 calculation only has a minor influence on the spectrum. Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is included by a RAS state-interaction (RASSI) approach.46,47
For comparison to the experimental spectra, the calculated incident energies have been shifted by −5.6 eV and −6.2 eV for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, respectively. The simulated XAS spectra are plotted using a Gaussian broadening of 0.3 eV with a half-width-at-half-maximum to simulate the monochromator bandwidth and further convoluted with a Lorentzian broadening of 0.15 eV on the L3 edge and 0.65 on the L2 edge,48 respectively. For the RIXS spectra, an additional Gaussian broadening of 0.3 eV is added along the energy transfer direction. Unfortunately, the experimental broadening details (monochromator bandwidth) are not available in ref. 14; smaller broadening is used here for the theoretical RIXS spectra to show more subtle features in the spectra.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Valence-excited states
The optical spectra of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ in both the crystal and solution have been reported, and a quartet character ground state has been assigned.49 The peak at 11300 cm−1 (1.40 eV) has been assigned to a transition of 4T1 → 4T2, and the peak at 22000 cm−1 (2.73 eV) has been assigned to 4T1 → 4T1 transition. The observed transition to a doublet state 2T2 has been assigned to a peak at 18500 cm−1 (2.29 eV). The calculated energy difference in valence excited states with different spin states is presented in Fig. 2. Overall, the CAS calculations with ANO-RCC-VDZP and ANO-RCC-VTZP basis sets give very similar energy differences, and the energy differences from the ANO-RCC-VTZP basis set are labeled in Fig. 2 and will be used for the following discussion. For [CoII(bpy)3]2+, the ground state is the 4T1 state which has configuration t2g5eg2 (dxz2dyz2dxy1dx2−y21dz21). There are another two quartet states lying closely to the ground state due to the different possibilities of single occupation arrangement in three t2g orbitals. The electron configurations for the other two quartet states are dxz1dyz2dxy2dx2−y21dz21 and dxz2dyz1dxy2dx2−y21dz21. The energy differences to the ground state are 0.17 eV and 0.18 eV, which come from the removal of orbital degeneracy due to the Jahn-Teller effect.50
 Fig. 2  The calculated valence-excited states of doublet and quartet for [CoII(bpy)3]2+, singlet, triplet and quintet for the [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ compound. 
The calculated lowest 4T2 quartet valence excitation state lies at 1.48 eV and has t2g4eg3 configuration. The transition of 4T1 → 4T2 has been assigned to an octahedral-field transition,49 and the CAS calculated energy difference nicely reproduced the experimental transition energy of 1.40 eV, while another calculated 4T1 quartet valence excitation state above 4T2 lies at 2.78 eV, which is close to the experimental 4T1 → 4T1 transition energy of 2.73 eV. The above transition energies enable calculating the ligand field parameters 10 Dq = 13250 cm−1 (1.64 eV) and B = 786 cm−1, and these parameters are close to the published value 12670 cm−1 of 10 Dq and 791 cm−1 of B.49,51 The calculated 2T2 doublet valence excited state lies at 2.39 eV; it is close to the observed peak (2.29 eV) originating from the transition to the doublet state of 2T2. From the calculation, the 2E doublet state lies at around 0.87 eV, see Fig. 2. The forbidden transition to the 2E state is hard to observe in the optical spectrum of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ but the transition to the doublet state has been reported for high-spin CoII dissolved in zinc oxide at 7168 cm−1 (0.89 eV) and magnesium oxide at 8547 cm−1 (1.06 eV).52
The [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is a low-spin compound that has 1A1 ground state with configuration t2g6eg0; the observed transition of 1A1 → 1T1 is at around 2.76 eV.53,54 The calculated lowest singlet valence excited state 1T1 (t2g5eg1) lies at 2.95 eV, and the calculated 1T2 (t2g5eg1) lies at 4.39 eV. Those two energies are slightly larger than 2.62 eV of 1T1 and 3.66 eV of 1T2 of the [CoIII(NH3)6]3+ compound.51,55 This is expected as the ‘bpy’ is a stronger ligand than ‘NH3’; hence the larger ligand field splitting will be given by the ‘bpy’ ligand. Overall, the CAS calculations have nicely described the transition energies in the optical spectra, as well as the ligand field splittings. In the following section, the calculations based on the active space in the valence excited state will be extended to the core-level spectroscopy description by adding the cobalt 2p core orbitals in the active space, see Fig. 1.
3.2. Co L-edge XAS
The Co L-edge XAS split into L3 and L2 edges by the core 2p spin–orbit coupling (SOC); the focus in the discussion here will be the L3 edge as it is well resolved compared to the L2 edge due to the difference in the lifetime width.48,56,57 The L3 edge provides information about the metal–ligand bonding interaction in terms of the t2g and eg orbital signatures, metal oxidation state and also the spin state.25,58 It is clearly demonstrated that the L3 main peak of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is higher in energy than that of the [CoII(bpy)3]2+ compound. This energy shift has been explained by the difference in the contraction of the 3d shell in the core-excited states.25 The experimental Co L-edge XAS of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ has broad features at the L3 edge; it consists of a peak at 776.4 eV, a separated main peak at 778.4 eV and 779.4 eV, and a relatively wide shoulder feature at around 781.8 eV.14 According to the previous DFT/ROCIS calculations,14 the peak at 776.4 eV and 778.4 eV has been assigned to 2p → t2g from a high-spin (quartet) initial state, and the peak at 779.4 eV has been assigned to the 2p → eg from a low-spin (doublet) initial state. The 781.8 eV feature has been assigned to the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions. The experimental L3 of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is dominated by the main peak at 780.4 eV, with several small peaks at 776.4 eV, 778.8 eV, and 783.4 eV.14 The features at 776.4 eV and 778.8 eV have been attributed to 2p → t2g and eg with a high-spin (triplet) initial state.14 The main peak feature at 780.4 eV mainly comes from the 2p → eg with mixed low-spin (singlet) and high-spin (triplet) initial states. The spectral feature at 783.4 eV has been assigned to the MLCT transitions.
The RAS approach has been employed to calculate the [CoII(bpy)3]2+ L-edge XAS using a quartet ground state with configuration 2p6t2g5eg2 (dxz2dyz2dxy1dx2−y21dz21). For checking the spectrum sensitivity to the Co–N bond-length deviations from experiment, two extra XAS calculations with Co–N bond lengths shorter by 0.03 Å and 0.06 Å (closer to the experimental structure) have been performed, see Fig. S5.† There is no big change in the spectral features, which suggested that the use of geometry from DFT optimization here can give reasonable results for the RAS spectrum calculation. The calculated XAS spectrum presented in Fig. 3 used 75 doublet and 30 quartet core-excited states, and the numbers are determined by calculating all the possibilities of the 2p electron excitation to five metal 3d-like orbitals (no charge transfer states included in the calculation). The calculated spectrum nicely reproduced the experimental spectral features in terms of the relative peak intensities and positions except for the separation of the main peak of the L3 edge, and the calculated separation is 1.6 eV (the second feature of the main peak is located at 780.0 eV), which is 0.6 eV larger than the experimental separation. The larger separation might come from the overestimated cobalt 3d characters in the targeted valence orbitals. An excitation to eg can give rise to two different sets of states 2/4t1g and 2/4t2g, split by the 3d–3d interactions. The RAS calculation allows for the decomposition of XAS into core-excited state spin multiplicities as shown in Fig. 3(a). The total spin S is not strictly preserved in the 2p → 3d excitation process due to the strong 2p SOC in the core-excited states, and the Co L-edge XAS has contribution from quartet (ΔS = 0) and doublet (ΔS = −1) core-excited states. The contributions with the same multiplicities as the ground state dominated the general spectral feature, the doublet CE state mainly contributes to the peak at 780.0 eV and the broad shoulder feature is from around 781.8 eV to 784 eV. The L-edge XAS of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ can be further analyzed through the differential orbital occupation numbers of the included active orbitals in the core-excited states as compared to the ground state, see Fig. 3(b). For the peak at 776.4 eV, the intensity mainly comes from 2p excitation to the metal t2g orbital (pink t2g component, 2p5t2g6eg2) and small contribution from excitation to eg (blue eg component, 2p5t2g5eg3) orbitals. The main peak of L3 and the wide shoulder peak at 781.8 eV gain intensity from the 2p excitation to eg (2p5t2g5eg3) together with some simultaneous t2g → eg transitions. Note that the eg component is higher than the total intensity of the L3 edge, and it is because of the strong configuration mixing in the core-excited state. The electron occupation averaged on the three t2g and two eg orbitals after core 2p excitation to eg. It gives 3.2 electrons on two eg and 4.8 electrons on three t2g orbitals; hence it can be translated to the deviation of eg contribution and negative t2g component from the 2p5t2g5eg3 final state. From the spin-state and orbital contribution analyses, we can confidently assign both peaks of the L3 main edge to the electron excitation to the eg orbital; they are not from excitation with different initial states.14 The features at the higher-energy side between 781.8 eV and 784.0 eV are mainly from the spin-flip transitions to the doublet core-excited states, not from the MLCT transitions.14
 Fig. 3  The comparison between the experimental Co L-edge XAS (adapted with permission from ref. 14. Copyright (2019), American Chemical Society.) and the calculated spectrum including the core excited states (a) and orbital contribution analysis (b) for metal L-edge XAS of [CoII(bpy)3]2+. The positive and negative values of the orbital contribution curves represent electron gain and loss in the transitions from initial state to core-excited states; the constant one electron loss in the core 2p orbital is not shown. 
In the final-state dependence calculations, see Fig. S3,† the spectral feature of the pre-edge at 776.4 eV converged by including 20 doublet and 20 quartet core-excited (CE) states. The peak at 778.4 eV converged with 30 doublet and 30 quartet final states. Further increasing the number of final states keeps continually changing the spectral features from the peak at 779.4 eV. The relative intensity of the main peaks of the L3 edge at 778.4 eV and 780.0 eV is getting smaller, which moves towards the convergence. The individual orbital contribution analysis to the spectra with different numbers of final states is available in Fig. S6;† the t2g contribution remains constant for all the spectra calculated, while the eg contribution changes with the inclusion of more final states. The spectra using the aforementioned another two low-lying quartet states have been calculated, see Fig. S5.† We can see that the t2g character peak is shifted to the lower energy as the t2g hole is located in the orbital dxz or dyz, which is lower than the dxy orbital. Moreover, the main peak of the L3 edge (eg character) also has some spectral feature changes, which come from the differences in the t2g–eg orbital interactions. These observations suggest that the RAS calculation of XAS is sensitive to the electron configuration of the initial state, and it can be interpreted that the Jahn-Teller effect can be probed in the RAS calculation of metal L-edge XAS.
For [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, the RAS calculated spectrum was recorded on a singlet ground state (2p6t2g6eg0). The general spectrum features converged with 20 final states in each spin (singlet, triplet and quintet), see Fig. S3.† Further increasing the number of final states has slight effects on the peak position at the higher energy side of the L3 edge. The calculated spectrum reproduced most of the experimental spectral features except the missing peak at 776.4 eV and underestimated intensity at 778.8 eV. Through the core-excited spin state decomposition analysis, the spectral features are almost equally shaped by the singlet (ΔS = 0), triplet (ΔS = 1) and quintet (ΔS = 2) CE state contributions. The orbital contribution analysis indicated that the intensity of the L3 edge is mainly from 2p excitation to the empty eg orbitals, which gives 2p5t2g6eg1 configuration. There are also some simultaneous transitions from the t2g orbitals and little contribution from σ valence character orbitals.
As aforementioned, the calculated spectrum has a missing peak (776.4 eV) and missing intensity (778.8 eV) at the lower-energy side of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ XAS. First of all, for the singlet ground state (2p6t2g6eg0) of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, there still can be features at the lower energy side of the eg main peak although there are no holes in the t2g orbitals. One possibility is intensity contributions from triplet core-excited states with parallel 2p and 3d orientation. These states break the electric dipole selection rules, but can gain intensity through spin–orbit coupling in the core-excited states. The spin contribution decomposition analysis (triplet CE component, cyanide curve) shows that the pre-edge features come from the triplet CE states, see Fig. 4(a). Apart from the triplet core-excited state contributions, another possible intensity mechanism for the lower-energy feature is that the creation of the core hole can lower the unoccupied metal-centered orbitals below the occupied ligand ones. Even if there are no holes in orbitals below eg, there can still be states with lower energy than that of the main eg transition. For the Oh symmetric system, the states with in-plane 2p hole–eg electron interactions have lower energy than the corresponding out-of-plane states, but only the latter are electric dipole allowed. These strict selection rules are broken in lower symmetry. Although the pre-edge peak feature is described in our RAS calculated spectrum, the intensity is underestimated. In addition to the underestimated intensity, the peak at 776.4 eV is also missing. It is noted that the RAS calculated XAS of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is very similar to the ligand-field multiplet calculation of a Oh CoIII system and other experimental CoIII spectra.59–62 Instead of attributing it to the ‘deficiency’ in the RAS calculation, the experimental [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ may have some mixed features from [CoII(bpy)3]2+ due to the X-ray induced sample damage.61,63–67 The samples under the beam can generate a number of secondary electrons after each absorption event, and the secondary electrons may have energy in the range of the ligand metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition and thus drive the reduction of CoIII to CoII. The soft X-ray induced valence tautomerism inter-conversion between CoIII and CoII has been observed in a cobalt dioxolene compound.61 The beam damage features in the X-ray have also been reported for other metals, such as Mn and Fe.63,64,67 The pre-peak and the main peak of the [CoII(bpy)3]2+ overlap quite well with the lower-energy features of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+. In Fig. 5, a subtracted spectrum (yellow curve) of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is tentatively plotted and presented using [CoIII(bpy)3]3+–17%[CoII(bpy)3]2+. It is clearly demonstrated that the RAS calculated spectrum reproduced the features in the subtracted spectrum instead of the original [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ spectrum with some possible beam-damage contributions.

3.3. Branching ratio comparisons
To establish the connection between the ground-state spin state used in the calculated spectra of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ with the experimental ones, we integrated the L3 and L2 edge of the calculated spectra and calculated the branching ratio as L3/(L2 + L3). The statistical branching ratio is 2/3, while this number changes in real systems due to the spin–orbit coupling and electrostatic interactions; thus the branching ratio can be used to get signatures of the spin state in the initial state.23,58,68
For comparison to the branching ratio of the published compounds,69 the integrated area of L3 is normalized to unity, and the integrated area of L2 is scaled correspondingly, as shown in Table 1. The calculated [CoII(bpy)3]2+ has relatively much smaller integrated L2 compared to [CoIII(bpy)3]3+; the [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ give a branching ratio 0.726 and 0.576, respectively. To validate a more rigorous assignment of the spin state, we compared the branching ratio to a series of published cobalt compounds with well-known spin states in the ground state. The high-spin compounds CoO, CoF2, CoF2·4H2O, CoCl2, and CoCl2·6H2O all give a branching ratio ranging from 0.683 to 0.761;69 a figure with standard deviation is available in Fig. S7.† The L-edge XAS of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ has also similar spectral features to the XAS of those high-spin compounds, except the more separated pre-edge (776.4 eV for [CoII(bpy)3]2+) from the main peak of the L3 edge. This is because of the stronger ligand-field splitting, which separates the t2g and eg orbitals. The branching ratio (0.576) of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is close to the branching ratio (0.610) of a low-spin compound Co(OH)2. The lower branching ratio again signifies a low-spin character ground state for [CoIII(bpy)3]3+.58

3.4. Cobalt 2p3d RIXS
The RIXS spectra of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ have been calculated by including all the possible metal-centered character valence-excited states, see Fig. 6. The charge transfer states are not included in the RIXS calculations since the contribution is small according to the above comparison between calculated cobalt L-edge XAS and experimental spectra. In order to understand the origin of spectra features in RIXS maps, we present the spin decomposition of the RIXS maps according to the spin of the RIXS final state (VE states), see Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  The cobalt L3 edge RIXS of [CoII(bpy)2]2+ (left) and [CoIII(bpy)2]3+ (right). The constant incident energy cuts are taken through A1: 776.4 eV, A2: 778.4 eV, A3: 780.0 eV, A4: 781.8 eV, and B1: 778.4 eV, B2: 780.4 eV, and B3: 783.4 eV for [CoII(bpy)2]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)2]3+, respectively. 
The RIXS map of [CoII(bpy)3]2+ shows broad and complicate features in the L3 edge regime, a resonance at 776.4 eV, two-separated resonances at 778.4 eV and 780.0 eV, and wide features from 781.8 eV along the incident energy direction. From the quartet VE contribution, the VE states with main configuration t2g5eg2 dominated the elastic features. Along the energy transfer direction, the quartet VE with configuration t2g4eg3 (equivalent to d–d transitions from t2g to eg) contributed to the resonances at around 1.5 eV and 2.8 eV. The features at around 4.0 eV have contributions from the quartet VE state with configuration t2g3eg4. The doublet metal-centered final states can be reached due to the strong mixing of the spin character in the intermediate core-excited states through 2p spin–orbit interaction. According to the doublet VE contribution map, the doublet VE state resonances with main configuration t2g6eg1 were observed at around 0.9 eV, and the features between 1.5 eV and 6.0 eV mainly come from VE states with mixed configurations t2g5eg2 and t2g4eg3, and small features from configurations t2g3eg4 can be expected at higher energy than 6.0 eV. In the doublet VE map, we observed a resonance feature with very little intensity at the elastic peak; the doublet VE states were present at the elastic peak due to the 3d spin–orbit interaction, which means that the ground state has a mixed spin character (98.2% quartet + 1.8% doublet from the weights of spin-free states to the SOC state).
The RIXS map of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ has fewer features compared to the [CoII(bpy)3]2+ RIXS map. There are three (778.4 eV, 780.4 eV and 783.4 eV) separated features along the incident energy axis for [CoIII(bpy)3]3+. The RIXS features are dominated by the singlet and triplet VE. The elastic features is mainly shaped by the singlet VE, and with very little contribution from triplet VE, it is again from the 3d spin–orbit interaction, and the ground state has a spin character of 99.3% singlet + 0.7% triplet through the weights of spin-free states to the SOC state. The quintet VE contribute very little to the RIXS feature; it might be the limited number of emission channels for quintet VE (five quintet VE included).
We have made cuts through the constant incident energy (CIE) and project intensity on the energy transfer axis, see Fig. 7. As the experimental RIXS spectra have very large bandwidth, it is not very straightforward to compare them with the theoretical spectra convoluted with smaller broadening. The purpose is to show more subtle features, which may motivate experimentalist to carry out another measurement of high-resolved spectra of these two cobalt compounds. For [CoII(bpy)3]2+, the CIE cuts of A1: 776.4 eV, A2: 778.4 eV, A3: 780.0 eV, and A4: 781.8 eV have been taken. The CIE cut of 780.0 eV shall be compared to the RIXS experimental cut measured at 779.4 eV due to the peak position deviation in the calculation. The CIE spectra at A1, A2 and A3 all have maximum intensity at the elastic position. The CIE cut at 776.4 eV has inelastic features at around 1.5 eV, which is from the t2g4eg3 state. Both A2 and A3 CIE cuts have more features between 1.5 eV and 5.0 eV, which come from mixed doublet and quartet VE metal-centered states. The CIE cut spectrum at 781.8 eV has low intensity at the elastic peak and broad features with the maximum peak located at around 4.0 eV. For [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, the CIE cuts [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ have been taken at B1: 778.4 eV, B2: 780.4 eV, and B3: 783.4 eV. The CIE cut of 778.4 eV is dominated by triplet VE states with main configuration t2g5eg1 at around 1.8 eV. The CIE cut of 780.4 eV has an intense elastic feature, which is very different from the experimental one. It is noted the elastic peak intensity is usually not directly comparable as the elastic peak intensity can vary in different measurements due to several factors, such as Thomson scattering, surface scattering, and self-absorption effect.27 The cut through 783.4 eV has two-peak features with most of the contribution from triplet valence-excited states.
 Fig. 7  The calculated and the experimental RIXS (adapted with permission from ref. 14. Copyright (2019), American Chemical Society.) at the selected X-ray absorption resonances, the maximum intensity is normalized to one. The selected incident energies are A1: 776.4 eV, A2: 778.4 eV, A3: 780.0 eV, A4: 781.8 eV, and B1: 778.4 eV, B2: 780.4 eV, and B3: 783.4 eV for [CoII(bpy)2]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)2]3+, respectively. 
In the previous work, the spectral region up to 4.5 eV of these two cobalt compounds has been tentatively assigned to the d–d transitions based on the cobalt porphyrin compound.70 Through the L-edge XAS calculations and comparison to the experimental spectra, the charge transfer contributions are very small for both compounds. The RAS calculations on the RIXS maps showed that the d–d transition features can extend to around 7.0 eV for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and to 8.0 eV for [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, similar to other cobalt compounds.71
4. Conclusion
In this paper, the X-ray spectra at the cobalt L-edge have been calculated and compared to the experimental measurements.14 The cobalt L-edge XAS spectra of the two cobalt compounds have been reproduced using the ground state of quartet for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and singlet for [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, respectively. Assignments to the spectral features have been performed through the final-state and individual orbital contribution analyses to the RAS calculated spectra. For [CoII(bpy)3]2+, the two-peak features at the L3 main edge are from the excitation to the eg with the same initial quartet state, which is different from the previous assignment based on the DFT/ROCIS calculation.14 The spectrum sensitivity to the geometric deviations in the Co–N bond length has been investigated, and it has been concluded that the RAS spectrum calculation based on the DFT optimized geometry can give us reasonable spectra. Through XAS calculations on another two low-lying quartet states and compared to the ground quartet spectrum, the shift of the t2g peak and the spectral feature changes of the eg peak can give fingerprints of the Jahn-Teller effects. For [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, the spectral features at the lower-energy side of the L3 edge were not reproduced. The beam-damage influence on the experimental spectrum of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ has been discussed, and the RAS calculated spectrum has nicely reproduced the subtracted spectrum instead of the original [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ spectrum. The lower-energy feature for the [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ has been well explained by the final triplet state contribution and confirmed through spin-decomposition analysis. We speculated that [CoIII(bpy)3]3+ is relatively more sensitive to the radiation. A good control of the X-ray dose or using of liquid jet measurement for such radiation-sensitive samples is suggested.24,67
The spin decomposition of the RIXS maps according to the spin of the final state provides us a more straightforward way to visualize the ground state character. The doublet and triplet valence-excitation states are observed at the elastic peak for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, respectively. The 98.2% quartet + 1.08% doublet character has been assigned to the ground state of [CoII(bpy)3]2+, and 99.3% singlet + 0.7% triplet to the ground state of [CoIII(bpy)3]3+. Moreover, the d–d transition features can extend up to around 7.0 eV for [CoII(bpy)3]2+ and around 8.0 eV for [CoIII(bpy)3]3+, which is broader than the previously assigned spectral region up to 4.5 eV of d–d transitions.14
Given the quantitative interpretations to the X-ray spectroscopy at the cobalt L-edge provided by the RAS calculations, we expected that the improved descriptions of the X-ray spectroscopy presented here can decipher the electronic structures of this couple of cobalt compounds, and also can offer a new basis for spectroscopic understanding of the changes in the electronic structure during the redox-catalytic reaction of other molecular systems.
