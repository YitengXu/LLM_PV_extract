    , Accepted 10th April 2013First published on 10th April 2013AbstractWe synthesized a series of Ru(II) metal complexes TFRS-1, -2, -4, -21, -22 and -24 with a single 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine together with two functionalized pyridyl azolate ancillary ligands consisting of pyrazolate or triazolate groups. Both photophysical measurements and DFT/TDDFT calculations were conducted to gain insight into their electronic and optical properties. The triazolate series of sensitizers TFRS-21, -22 and -24 showed an enlarged optical band gap with respect to their pyrazolate counterparts TFRS-1, -2 and -4. When employed in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs), the triazolate sensitizers show slightly inferior JSC values due to the poor incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies recorded compared to the pyrazolate series. Moreover, the endowed 5-(hexylthio)thiophen-2-yl substituents exert a notable hyperchromic effect and bathochromic shift in the absorption spectra, which then improves the short circuit current JSC to 18.7 and 15.5 mA cm−2 and the overall conversion efficiency to η = 10.2% and 8.25% for TFRS-4 and TFRS-24, respectively. For the evaluation of VOC, transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay measurements were carried out to compare the rates of interfacial recombination of electrons from the TiO2 conduction band to electrolyte.
Introduction
As the situation of global warming continues, it is becoming obvious that mankind must switch to renewable energies, which encourages our societies to place strong emphasis on the development of emerging photovoltaic technologies. However, the main barrier that prevents them from becoming the major electricity supplier is their high manufacturing costs. Fortunately, the third-generation technology, i.e. dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs), may provide the needed breakthrough, by virtue of their low fabrication costs and good power conversion efficiencies.1–4 Generally speaking, a DSC consists of a tailor-made light-absorbing sensitizer deposited on a nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode, the I−/I3− redox couple for the transport of electrical charge, and a thin layer of platinum in the counter electrode.5–9 For the sensitizers, it has been reported that Ru(II) metal complexes exhibit superior, double-digit efficiencies under AM 1.5 global illumination.10–15 However, the thiocyanate ligands incorporated in typical Ru(II) sensitizers are believed to provide the weakest bonding of the whole molecule, making the sensitizers and, hence, the as-fabricated solar cells somewhat unstable under excessive thermal stress and/or light soaking.16 This latent inferiority has triggered studies attempting to replace the thiocyanate ligands of Ru(II) sensitizers with different chelating anions, such as diketonate,17 picolinate18 and heteroaromatic cyclometalates,19,20 among which the cyclometalates seem to be the most promising ancillary ligands. A prominent conversion efficiency of 10.1% was documented for a tris-bidentate Ru(II) complex YE05, featuring a single 2,4-difluorophenyl pyridine cyclometalated ligand,21,22 see Scheme 1.

Encouraged by this finding, many attempts have been executed to optimize the relevant cyclometalated Ru(II) complexes through modification of their structural and electrochemical properties. On the one hand, van Koten and coworkers19,20 and Berlinguette and coworkers23–25 utilized either tridentate or bidentate cyclometalated ligands to assemble Ru(II) sensitizers devoid of thiocyanate ligands, achieving the highest efficiency of ∼8.8%.26 On the other hand, our recent endeavors have shown that both functionalized pyridyl pyrazolate27,28 and 2,6-dipyrazolyl pyridine29 can be used as replacements for the aforementioned bidentate and tridentate aromatic cyclometalates. The resulting Ru(II) based sensitizers, named TFRS-2 and TF-2, have shown outstanding device performances, together with excellent device stabilities under accelerated light-soaking tests at 60 °C for over 1000 h. Herein, we report a follow-up study on the search for the best design of the TFRS-sensitizers that possess a series of distinctive pyridyl azolate chelates.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization
All TFRS sensitizers were synthesized using a single 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine anchor plus two functionalized pyridyl azolate ancillaries. Two classes of azole fragments, e.g. pyrazole and 1,2,4-triazole, along with three different appendages attached at the 4-position of the pyridyl group, i.e. R = H, 5-hexylthiophen-2-yl and 5-(hexylthio)thiophen-2-yl, were employed for probing their combined influence on the UV-Vis spectral, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. These variations then produced a total of six azolate chelates, for which the representative synthetic procedures are compiled in the ESI.†
The corresponding ester derivatives of the TFRS sensitizers were prepared by reacting Ru(diethyl 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylate)(p-cymene)Cl and the respective 2-pyridyl azoles in refluxing 2-methoxyethanol. In general, silica gel column chromatography was executed to separate the isomeric products, which are expected based on the statistical, random distribution of the asymmetric azoles. However, among three expected isomers, the one with trans-azolate fragments turned out to be the major product. The yields (28–33%) of the trans-pyrazolate complexes, i.e.TFRS-1, -2 and -4, are notably higher than those recorded for the corresponding triazolate counterparts TFRS-21, -22 and -24 (15–20%), showing the first influence of the ancillary chelates.
Subsequently, these ester derivatives were hydrolyzed in 1 M NaOH solution at 100 °C for 24 h. The TFRS sensitizers were obtained by acidification and trituration with deionized water and diethyl ether in sequence. The molecular structures of these complexes are depicted in Scheme 2. It is notable that the azolate and pyridyl fragments in TFRS-1–24 are all located at the mutual trans- and cis-dispositions, respectively reminiscent of the ligand arrangement of analogous Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes carrying two pyridyl azolate chelates.30,31
 Scheme 2  Structural drawings of the studied Ru(II) sensitizers. 
The absorption spectra of pyrazolate sensitizers TFRS-1, -2 and -4 with a concentration of 1.2 × 10−5 M in DMF are depicted in Fig. 1a, for which the numerical data are summarized in Table 1. In addition to the higher energy ππ* absorptions, the parent complex TFRS-1 exhibits two peak maxima at 405 and 515 nm, which are attributable to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer bands (MLCT) mixed with a small amount of ligand-to-ligand charge transfer contribution (vide infra). Moreover, upon introduction of 5-hexylthiophen-2-yl substituents to TFRS-1, the lower energy MLCT absorption mainly displays an increase in absorptivity and a split into two peak maxima at 481 and 516 nm upon forming TFRS-2 and, next upon switching to the 5-(hexylthio)thiophen-2-yl group, afforded a highly intense MLCT absorption at 501 nm in forming the sensitizer TFRS-4. Similar variations of spectral patterns and peak maxima were observed for the triazolate series of sensitizers TFRS-21, -22 and -24, for which their UV-Vis spectra are illustrated in Fig. 1b. As can be seen, all the triazolate analogues showed relatively blue-shifted absorptions compared to their pyrazolate counterparts. The 5-(hexylthio)thiophen-2-yl substituted TFRS-24 sensitizer showed the most red-shifted, intense absorption with a maximum at 485 nm, for which a similar effect has been observed for the Ru(II) sensitizer C106.32

UV-Vis spectral analysis was also performed under different concentrations to reveal possible aggregation in solution as well as the proton dissociation from carboxylic acid groups. As shown in Fig. 2, the spectral profile of both TFRS-4 and -24 in DMF changed substantially on varying the concentration from 12 to 1.2 × 10−5 M. For TFRS-4, its spectral pattern at 1.2 × 10−4 M is akin to that of TFRS-1 at a much lower concentration of 1.2 × 10−5 M, showing two well separated MLCT transitions at 430 and 550 nm, respectively. Moreover, their intensity is found to gradually decrease, together with the emergence of a new absorption band at ∼500 nm upon dilution. Since the absorptions at both 430 and 550 nm involve a predominant MLCT contribution to the 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine, the decrease in intensity can be explained by the gradual dissociation of the carboxylic acid protons and the formation of carboxylates at the bipyridine anchor. The resulting negative charge on carboxylates then destabilizes the π* orbital energy of the bipyridine, which is consistent with the gradual increase in absorption intensity of the higher energy new MLCT peak at around 500 nm. In sharp contrast, minor variation of extinction coefficients is observed for the transitions above 400 nm, which are mainly due to ππ* transition, as confirmed by their greater optical densities, and independence of the solution concentration. As for the triazolate TFRS-24, shifting of the lowest energy MLCT band follows the same established trend, except that the variation of the extinction coefficient for all absorption bands looked more irregular compared to that of the pyrazolate analogue TFRS-4. We attribute this to the third nitrogen atom of the triazolate entities, which could foster bonding interactions to either the dissociated or undissociated protons from carboxylic acids.

Cyclic voltammetry was then performed to ensure that the excited state oxidation potentials (E°′*) of the investigated complexes were sufficient for efficient injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 and to verify whether their oxidation potentials at the ground state (E°′ox) match the redox potential of electrolyte. As shown in Table 1, E°′ox, which is the potential for the Ru(II) metal oxidation, appeared in the range 0.90–0.93 V and 1.10–1.16 V (vs. NHE) for the pyrazolate derivatives TFRS-1, 2 and 4 and triazolate derivatives TFRS-21, 22 and 24, respectively. The positive shift for TFRS-21, 22 and 24 is apparently caused by the more electronegative triazolate chelates. Disregarding their intrinsic difference, all data are found to be more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE) and the hypothetical I−/I2˙− couple (ca. 0.79–0.93 V vs. NHE), warranting fast dye regeneration.33–36 Next, the E0–0 values were determined from the intersections of the absorption and tangent of the emission peak in DMF, for which the energy gaps obtained for the triazolate sensitizers (2.05–2.07 eV) were found to be sizably larger than those of the pyrazolate counterparts (1.91–1.98 eV). The larger E0–0 gaps of the triazolate derivatives counterbalanced the more positive E°′ox values, which then afforded lower E°′* values (i.e. E°′ox − E0–0) for triazolate derivatives TFRS-21, 22 and 24 (−0.91 to −0.99 V) versus those of the pyrazolate derivatives TFRS-1, 2 and 4 (−1.01 to −1.07 V), for which the trend is consistent with the electronic properties of azolates. Despite this difference, all data are more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 electrode (ca. −0.5 V vs. NHE), confirming the occurrence of fast electron injection in all cases.
Computational investigation
To gain insight into the electronic and optical properties of the investigated series of sensitizers, we performed DFT/TDDFT calculations in DMF solution on both the pyrazolate series TFRS-1, -2 and -4 and the triazolate series TFRS-21, -22 and -24, considering for all systems a number of protons carried by the carboxylic acid anchoring groups of the 4,4′-bipyridine ranging from 0 to 2. Geometry optimizations were performed employing a 3-21G* basis set,37 while a larger DGDZVP basis38 was employed for the subsequent TDDFT calculations. In all cases, the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional39 and the C-PCM solvation model40–42 were used, as implemented in the Gaussian 09 program suite.43
The isodensity plots of selected molecular orbitals for the doubly protonated species of TFRS-4 and -24 are reported in Fig. 3, while a survey of the frontier molecular orbital energies for the investigated systems is schematically reported in Fig. 4; see also Fig. S1 and S2 as well as Tables S1 and S2 of the ESI† for the frontier orbitals and relevant data of other TFRS sensitizers. The HOMO is in all cases a Ru(II) t2g orbital, which acquires some mixing with ligand π orbitals for the thiophene appendages. A similar mixing was found from Ru(II) sensitizers carrying π-excessive heteroaromatic substituents.44 The localization of the LUMOs depends on the degree of protonation of the carboxy-substituted bipyridine ligand, which are the LUMOs for the protonated dyes but shifted to higher energy upon deprotonation, see below.

 Fig. 4  Schematic representation of the energy levels of the doubly protonated (a), mono protonated (b), and doubly deprotonated (c), of TFRS-4 and -24 sensitizers. 
Within a given pyrazolate and triazolate series we notice that the LUMO energy is essentially unaltered, while the HOMO energy becomes more positive (vs. NHE) on going from pyrazolate TFRS-4 and to TFRS-24, see Fig. 4. Upon deprotonation of the carboxylic acid groups, both the HOMOs and LUMOs are shifted to less negative energies at the same time, as a result of the increased electron donation. However, the LUMOs are relatively more sensitive, so that the overall result reveals an increase of the HOMO–LUMO gap upon deprotonation.45 Comparing homologous data for the two series of dyes, we notice that in triazolate sensitizers represented by TFRS-24 the HOMOs are found to be ca. 0.2 eV lower in energy than in the corresponding pyrazolate sensitizers, in agreement with the trend of cyclic voltammetry data showing a 0.15–0.23 V shift. It is also interesting to note that the LUMOs for the triazolate sensitizers are calculated at lower energies (ca. 0.08 eV) compared to those of the pyrazolate series. Although not directly comparable to the E°* data reported in Table 1, our results are fully consistent with such results, showing a higher (i.e. more negative vs. the reference electrode) excited state energy for the pyrazolate series.
We now move to the optical properties of the investigated systems. The absorption spectra for the doubly protonated, mono and doubly deprotonated dyes have been computed for all the investigated species throughout the visible and UV region, thus allowing us to compare calculated and experimental data. The results for the pyrazolate and triazolate series, represented by TFRS-4 and TFRS-24, are reported in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Comparison between the experimental (blue lines) and calculated (red lines) (doubly protonated, left, mono protonated, center, doubly deprotonated right) optical absorption spectra for the sensitizers TFRS-4 and -24. The intensities of the experimental spectra were rescaled to match those of the computed visible maximum. Vertical lines correspond to unbroadened oscillator strengths. 
As can be seen from Fig. 5, a generally good agreement is observed between calculated and experimental spectra. As could be anticipated from the HOMO–LUMO gap variation, deprotonation of the bipyridine carboxylic acid groups leads to a blue shift of the visible transitions. Interestingly, the calculated absorption spectra for the deprotonated sensitizers show a better agreement with the experimental spectra than those for the protonated analogues, suggesting that the sensitizers are effectively (partially) deprotonated in the experimental conditions. This is somehow expected, considering the substantial acidic strength of the involved carboxylic groups. It is however possible that an equilibrium among various possible deprotonated species also exists in solution, so that the resulting absorption spectrum is an average of the three differently protonated forms. A detailed analysis of the involved transitions is reported in Tables S3–S8 of the ESI;† here it suffices to note that the lowest transitions have mainly MLCT character, originating from the metal-based HOMO to the bipyridine π* LUMOs. Our calculations nicely reproduce the increased intensity experimentally observed on going from parent TFRS-1 and -21 to 5-hexylthiophen-2-yl substituted TFRS-2 and -22 and, finally, 5-(hexylthio)thiophen-2-yl substituted TFRS-4 and -24 sensitizers (ESI†), which is due to the admixture of metal and ligand states in the HOMOs, as discussed above. This mixture imparts a partial ligand-centered ππ* character to these otherwise pure MLCT excitations, contributing to the increased absorption intensity.
We also investigated the redox properties of the entire series of sensitizers by calculating the ground and excited state oxidation potentials of the dyes, obtained as previously described,46 as a function of the protonation of the carboxylic groups. The results are reported in Table 2, along with experimental data converted to the vacuum scale. A general trend which can be outlined is that by decreasing the number of protons the ground state oxidation potential becomes less positive, while the lowest excitation energy (of singlet character) increases, so that a higher lying excited state oxidation potential is consistently retrieved by decreasing the number of protons carried by the carboxylic groups. We also notice that our estimated ground and excited state potentials follow the trend of the experimental data. As an example, for TFRS-4 and TFRS-24 our data predict a more positive ground and excited state oxidation potential at all levels of protonation for the former dye, as is found experimentally.

Fabrication of devices
The DSC devices were fabricated using a 12 + 6 μm TiO2 anode and with a 4 × 4 mm2 working area. The photoanode was stained in the 0.3 mM dye solution in ethanol with the addition of 20% of DMSO to increase solubility. The electrolyte consists of 0.6 M PMII, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) and 0.05 M LiI in a mixture of valeronitrile–acetonitrile with a volume ratio of 15:85. Device performances were measured under a 6 × 6 mm2 shadow mask for suppressing diffused solar irradiation. As the reference, the DSC fabricated using TFRS-1 afforded performance parameters of JSC = 16.0 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.76 V, FF = 0.712 and η = 8.66% under AM 1.5 G simulated one-sun conditions; pertinent data are listed in Table 3. Furthermore, upon switching the sensitizer to TFRS-2 and then to TFRS-4, a better set of parameters JSC = 17.3 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.77 V and FF = 0.723, and JSC = 18.7 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.75 mV and FF = 0.729 were achieved, affording an overall conversion efficiency of η = 9.63% and 10.2%, respectively. It seems that the reported trend is mainly derived from the increase of short-circuit current JSC, which is consistent with the higher absorptivity and bathochromic shift of absorptions, by switching to the R substituents with extended π-conjugation and higher polarizability.

The DSCs using the triazolate sensitizers TFRS-21, -22 and -24 yielded lower short-circuit current JSC values to the level of 14.1–15.5 mA cm−2, compared to the TFRS-1, -2 and -4 sensitizers, albeit with minor variations in the VOC and FF, resulting in efficiencies in the range of 7.74 to 8.30%. The reduced JSC can be rationalized by the blue-shifted absorption, which decreases the overlap with the solar spectrum and lowers the light harvesting capability.
Graphs of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) are shown in Fig. 6a. The onsets of the IPCE spectra of pyrazolate series TFRS-1, -2 and -4 are all close to ∼810 nm, and excellent IPCE performance was observed in the range from 420 to 570 nm, among which the best sensitizer is TFRS-4, which shows a maximum of 40% at 700 nm and steadily increases to ∼72% at 600 nm and then maintains a similar IPCE efficiency until reaching 420 nm when it starts to drop. For the triazolate series TFRS-21, -22 and -24, the onsets started only at 750 nm, but quickly went up to 40% at 640–650 nm and reached their maxima of ∼70% at 550–570 nm. These trends in the IPCE clearly reveal that the triazolate sensitizers would exhibit relatively inferior JSC values compared to those of the pyrazolate counterparts, and are consistent with the optical and electrochemical properties investigated in the previous section. Fig. 6b shows the photocurrent density–voltage curves of the DSC devices. The TFRS-4 solar cells showed the best set of short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and overall conversion efficiency (η) values which were measured to be 18.7 mA cm−2, 0.75 V, 0.729 and 10.2%, respectively. These results are notably better than those of control devices of its kind. For instance, the cells with TFRS-1 and -2 sensitizers afford JSC = 16.0 and 17.3 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.76 and 0.77 V, and FF = 0.712 and 0.723, corresponding to an overall η = 8.66 and 9.63%. These data are comparable to our original data,28 although they were initially recorded without the shading mask, such that the quoted performances of TFRS-1 and -2 are approximately 6% lower than that of TFRS-4, which stands as the best sensitizer for this class of materials.

However, we wish to point out that the pyrazolate series of sensitizers TFRS-1 to -4 all showed much superior device performances versus those of their triazolate counterparts TFRS-21 to -24. This trend is in sharp contrast to that of the recently reported analogues TFRS-11 to -14, for which the conjugated 4,4′-dicarboxyvinyl-2,2′-bipyridine is employed as the anchoring group.47 It is believed that the extra pairs of vinyl groups on TFRS-11 to -14 destabilize their ground state oxidation potentials, which are verified by respective electrochemical studies. Thus, TFRS-11 to -14 sensitizers will need more electron deficient triazolate fragments to bring down the ground state oxidation potential and to allow a sufficient driving force for efficient dye regeneration.
Transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay measurements were carried out in order to investigate the rates of interfacial recombination of electrons from the TiO2 conduction band to the electrolyte. It is worth noting that VOC decays are measurements dependent on the accumulated charge at the TiO2 conduction band, and hence, to obtain a fair comparison of the e−_TiO2/electrolyte+ recombination dynamics between different dyes, the charge density on both dyes must be equal. The densities of states (DOS) of the films loaded with the TFRS-4 and TFRS-24 sensitizers were determined from transient photocurrent decay measurements. As presented in Fig. 7a, the chemical capacitance Cμ of devices rises exponentially with the increased VOC. Cμ is directly proportional to the density of state (DOS) (Cμ = q(e)DOS, where q(e) is electron charge).48,49 It is clear that very similar electron densities are measured for the two between TFRS-4 and -24 sensitizers, which served as representative examples for all TFRS sensitizers. This observation means we can discard the contribution of a conduction band shift to the observed decrease in the back-electron transfer rate. The electron lifetimes were measured at identical electron densities using transient photovoltage measurements. Fig. 7b illustrates electron lifetime as a function of VOC for the different sensitizers. The VOC was adjusted by varying the intensity of the bias light impinging on the cell. The trend correlates rather well with the VOC values obtained for these devices, i.e. as electron lifetime gets shorter, the VOC decreases. Longer electron lifetimes were observed for TFRS-4, compared to TFRS-24. The difference was explained by the iodine binding ability with the pyrazolate and triazolate chelate, leading to faster recombination.50–52

The electron injection process was studied using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy techniques on representative pyrazolate TFRS-4 and triazolate TFRS-24 sensitizers, see Fig. 8. The electron injection process in two identical samples of pyrazolate and triazolate series superimposes quite well and showed no obvious difference at all.

Although the LUMO level has been slightly shifted, this has not affected the overall electron injection process. These data support the DFT simulations where the extension of the LUMO is observed to be similar in both cases. To gain an insight into the dye regeneration process having these thiocyanate-free sensitizers, and the electron back reaction process, nanosecond flash photolysis measurements were performed on both series. The dynamics of the oxidized state of the dye after its initial generation were monitored by measuring transient changes of its optical absorption at the wavelength λ = 720 nm. In the absence of a redox mediator, that is, in pure 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) solvent and without the redox couple, the decay of the absorption signal recorded at 720 nm reflects the dynamics of the recombination of injected electrons with S+. In Fig. 9a, the black curve decays with a typical lifetime τ = 1 ms for both TFRS-4 and TFRS-24. In the presence of the redox couple, the decay of the oxidized dye signal was significantly accelerated. The fits to first exponential functions give rate constants of 59000 s−1 and 110000 s−1, giving half life times of 17 and 9 μs for dye regeneration on TFRS-4 and TFRS-24 respectively. Although the efficient regeneration rate in is in agreement with photovoltaic measurements and a higher dye regeneration on TFRS-24 with respect to TFRS-4 is in agreement with the more positive oxidation potential, it should be noted that in iodide based redox electrolytes, dye regeneration is a two electron transfer process and it cannot be simply directly linked to the thermodynamics of the system.

The solid lines are fits to first order exponential functions giving fitting rate constants of 60000 s−1 and 110000 s−1 respectively for TFRS-4 and TFRS-24. 
Conclusion
Ru(II) metal complexes with a 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine anchor and two functionalized 2-pyridyl azolate ancillaries were systemically modified with the goal of finding better and more stable sensitizers for DSC applications. The sensitizer TFRS-4, featuring a hexylthiothiophene appendage on pyrazolate chelates, shows a distinctive red-shifted MLCT absorption, which improves the light-capturing ability in the visible and near infrared regions resulting in the best overall conversion efficiency (η = 10.2%) among all sensitizers studied. In sharp contrast, the triazolate sensitizers TFRS-21, -22 and -24 exhibit relatively inferior JSC and VOC values compared to those of the pyrazolate counterparts due to the enlarged optical gap caused by the electron withdrawing behaviour of triazolate chelates, and the possible interaction between the triazolate group of the sensitizer and iodine in the electrolyte that induced the rapid charge recombination. Finally, despite the need for more research, TFRS-4 could be useful for future pilot applications, based on the performance data shown in this work.
Experimental section
General synthetic procedures
All reactions were performed under an argon atmosphere and solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. Commercially available reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. All reactions were monitored using pre-coated TLC plates (0.20 mm with fluorescent indicator UV254). Mass spectra were obtained on a JEOL SX-102A instrument operating in electron impact (EI) or fast atom bombardment (FAB) mode. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury-400 or an INOVA-500 instrument. Elemental analysis was carried out with a Heraeus CHN–O rapid elementary analyzer.
Synthesis of TFRS-4
4-(5-(Hexylthio)thiophen-2-yl)-2-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyridine (145 mg, 0.35 mmol), Ru(diethyl 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylate)(p-cymene)Cl (100 mg, 0.17 mmol) and sodium acetate (98 mg, 1.00 mmol) were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (20 mL), and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux under stirring overnight. After evaporating the solvent, the aqueous phase was separated and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 25 mL). The crude compound was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with a 3:2 mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate. Finally, the resulting solid was dissolved in a mixture of acetone (5 mL) and 1 M NaOH solution (5 mL). The solution was heated to reflux under N2 for 12 h. After completing the hydrolysis, the solvent was removed and the solid was dissolved in water (10 mL) and titrated with 2 M HCl to pH 3 to afford a brown precipitate. This brown product was washed with ethyl acetate and acetone in sequence, yield: 67 mg, 33%.

Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses (3.2 mm thickness, sheet resistance of 9 Ω cm−2, Pilkington) were washed with detergent, water, acetone and ethanol, sequentially. After treatment in a UV-O3 system for 15 min (PSD series UV-ozone cleaning, Novascan Technologies, Inc.), the FTO glass plates were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and rinsed with water and ethanol. The photoanodes composed of nanocrystalline TiO2 were prepared using literature procedures.53 The TiO2 electrodes of 12 μm thickness were deposited on transparent conducting glass, on which a 6 μm light-scattering layer containing 400 nm TiO2 particles (PST-400, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals, Japan) was screen-printed (active area, 0.16 cm2). The TiO2 electrodes were heated under an air flow at 325 °C for 30 min, followed by heating at 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 electrodes were treated with a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with water and ethanol. The electrodes were sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min and left to cool to 80 °C before dipping them into the dye solution (0.3 mM) for 18 h at 25 °C. The dye solution was prepared in absolute ethanol with 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The Pt-coated counter electrodes were prepared using a 5 mM H2PtCl6 solution in isopropyl alcohol, followed by heating at 400 °C for 15 min. The dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were assembled with Pt counter electrodes by inserting a hot-melt Surlyn film (Meltonix 1170–25, 25 μm, Solaronix) as spacer. The electrolyte solution, which consists of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.03 M iodine, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) and 0.05 M LiI in a 15:85 (v/v) mixture of valeronitirile and acetonitrile, was injected into the cell through a pre-drilled hole at the counter electrode. Finally, the hole was sealed using a hot-melt Surlyn film and a cover glass. In order to reduce scattered light from the edges of glass electrodes of the dyed TiO2 layer,54 all devices were covered with a light-shading mask with a size of 0.6 × 0.6 cm2.
Photovoltaic characterization
Photovoltaic measurements were recorded with a Newport Oriel Class A Solar Simulator (Model 91159) equipped with a class A 150 W xenon light source powered by a Newport power supply (Model 69907). The light output (area: 2 × 2 in2) was calibrated to AM 1.5 using a Newport Oriel correction filter to reduce the spectra mismatch in the region of 350–750 nm to less than 4%. The power output of the lamp was measured to 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) using a certified Si reference cell (SRC-1000 TC-QZ, VLSI standard S/N: 10510-0031). The current voltage characteristic of each cell was obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley digital source meter (Model 2400). The spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were calculated with the equation of 1240JSC(λ)/(λPin(λ)) and were plotted as a function of incident wavelength with an increment of 10 nm. It should be noted that 20 sets of JSC (interval 50 ms) were collected after each illumination of 3 s and were averaged for the calculations of IPCE.55 A 300 W Xe lamp (Model 6258, Newport Oriel) combined with an Oriel cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator (Model 74100) provided an unchopped monochromatic beam onto a photovoltaic cell. The beam intensity was calibrated with a power meter (Model 1936 C, Newport) equipped with a Newport 818-UV photodetector. Photovoltaic performance was measured using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.36 cm2.
Laser spectroscopy
Dye-loaded, 3 μm-thick transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 films were used to study electron injection, electron back reaction and dye regeneration processes using a nanosecond and femtosecond transient absorption spectrophotometer. Pulsed excitation (λ) 550 nm, 5 ns fwhm pulse duration, 20 μJ cm−2 pulse energy fluence, 30 Hz repetition rate was provided by an optical parametric oscillator (OPO, GWU OPO-355) pumped by a frequency-tripled, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Powerlite 7030). These conditions ensure that, at most, one electron is injected per TiO2 particle at a time. The probe light from a Xe arc lamp was passed through filters, various optical elements, the sample, and a second grating monochromator, before being detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded by a digital oscilloscope. The transient probe signal measured at λ = 700 nm corresponds to the time evolution of the absorbance of the oxidized state of the dye (S+) as deduced from previously recorded transient absorption spectra. The transient decay observed corresponds to the lifetime of S+ in the presence or absence of a redox electrolyte. Traces were obtained by averaging over 3000 laser shots
