    , Accepted 3rd August 2011First published on 26th August 2011AbstractPerformance of inverted bulk-heterojunction solar cells with widely used tris(8-quinolinolate)aluminium(III) (Alq3) is compared with a series of novel zinc-benzothiazole (Znb2) derivatives as buffer layer. The devices including a Znb2 thin layer between the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blend and the Au anode show a significant improvement in the power conversion efficiency (η), which is enhanced by 30% compared to Alq3cells. Moreover, by combining both Alq3 and Znb2 in the device as a double buffer layer prior to the metal electrode deposition, the efficiency improves by 40%. The reasons for the enhanced performance of Znb2 cells are attributed to the efficient charge transport and electron/exciton blocking properties. Furthermore it is expected that the deposition of Znb2 modifies the Au work function to facilitate the hole transport and collection at the anode, and encapsulate the P3HT/PCBM blend during the electrode deposition. The presented photovoltaic cells also show high stability in ambient air conditions over a period of 245 days, which evidences the need of Znb2 buffer layers for long-term device durability.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices based on small-molecule dyes or polymeric materials received considerable attention in the last few decades, despite their efficiencies and durability clearly falling short of today's state-of-the-art Si-based inorganic solar cells.1–3 The major potential advantages of organic solar cells (OSC) compared with the inorganic counterparts lie with the versatility in the manufacture, light weight, lower fabrication cost, ease of integration into devices, and large area coating.4,5
Organic solar cells containing regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor polymer and a soluble fullerene derivative, phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), as an acceptor, are widely investigated as promising candidates for highly efficient devices.6–9 Highest published values obtained by using a low band gap polymer donor and a fullerene-based acceptor have recently exceeded 7%.10 Even though P3HT/PCBM based cells are promising in terms of efficiencies, their stability in atmospheric conditions still remains an unsolved problem, and it represents a major hurdle before the upscale productions.11,12 Chemical oxidation of the low work function metal electrode (mainly Al) and photodegradation of organics are the main reasons for short device durability. Recently, inverted organic solar cells containing a zinc oxide (ZnO) modified ITO cathode, P3HT/PCBM blend active layer, and high work function metal anode have remarkably improved their stability in air compared to conventional devices equipped with a low work function metal cathode.13,14 Moreover, device performance and stability can be further enhanced by introducing a buffer layer between the active layer and the metal electrode.14,15
Organic metal complexes have been frequently adopted as electron transporting layers or emitting components in organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and as buffer layers in OSC.16Tris(8-quinolinolate)aluminium(III) (Alq3) remains one of the most widely used complexes in OSC owing to its superior properties such as the low lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (∼−5.7 eV), good thermal stability, and ease of thin film fabrication by the vacuum evaporation technique.17,18 Alq3 has been successfully deposited as a thin buffer layer between the organics and the metal electrodes.

        Bis(2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazolate)zinc(II) (Znb2) complex (Fig. 1) is known to have similar electronic and thermal properties compared to Alq3.19–21 Moreover, Znb2 complex exhibits hole transport properties,21 which are essential for inverted OSC, as it favours hole transfer from active layer to anode. In spite of its interesting photophysical properties, the Znb2 complex has been studied only by few groups in their OLED devices.19–23 The suggested function of the buffer layers in OSC is the protection of the organics from the diffusion of metal atoms during electrode deposition, as well as the modification of the work function of the metal electrode evaporated on top of the buffer layer by the introduction of a surface dipole.24 In addition, buffer layers also improve the stability of the solar cells by preventing the diffusion of oxygen and/or water vapour into the finished devices.25

Theoretical computations have shown that the HOMO is mainly localized on the phenol ring and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) on the thiazole ring of the benzothiazole ligand.23 Thus, it is possible to modify the HOMO energy levels by simply attaching electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups to the phenol ring without changing the benzothiazole core structure. The HOMO energy levels of Znb2 are an important factor to consider when designing the solar cells, because the better aligned HOMO energy level will facilitate the hole movement from P3HT to Au anode. In fact, when deposited below the metal electrode, the Znb2 layer might influence the electrode work function. Moreover, the matching of LUMO levels of Znb2 with those of the other constituents of the photovoltaic device is also crucial for an efficient electron/exciton blocking.
In this paper, a series of recently synthesized 5-substituted Znb2 derivatives (synthesis and photophysical properties described elsewhere26) is investigated as novel buffer layer materials for inverted OSC. A correlation between the chemical–physical characteristics of different Znb2 complexes and their contribution to the solar cell efficiency is also derived. The photovoltaic performance of the devices with Znb2 derivatives was compared to that of a similar reference cell with an Alq3buffer layer. Finally, the introduction of a double buffer layer in OSC was investigated, in which the best performing Znb2 derivative was combined with Alq3, as suggested by Zhu et al.20
Experimental
Materials
All the solvents (HPLC grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and used as received. The Znb2 derivatives were synthesized as described elsewhere.26 Commercial Alq3 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), here adopted as a reference compound, was used without further purification. P3HT was purchased from Rieke Metals Inc. (4002-E), and PCBM from Nano-C. The chemical structures of P3HT, PCBM, Alq3 and all the Znb2 derivatives are shown in Fig. 1. Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (1.2 × 3.5 cm2) were purchased from Solems.
Device preparation
Before any film deposition, the ITO substrates underwent a patterning by aqua regiaetching, followed by a thorough cleaning procedure.18 Before the organic layer deposition, the substrates were treated by the N2 plasma cleaning procedure for 10 min. The ZnO layer was prepared from a zinc acetate (Zn(OCOCH3)2·2H2O) solution (50 g L−1) in 96% 2-methoxy ethanol and 4% ethanolamine, and was fabricated according to the literature procedure.13P3HT and PCBM were dissolved separately in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and stirred at 50 °C overnight. The solutions were subsequently combined, stirred at 70 °C for 2 h, and finally sonicated (at 50 °C for 30 min) before the spin-coating. In the OSC devices, the total concentration of P3HT:PCBM was 32 g L−1 (1:0.8 weight ratio). P3HT/PCBM blends were spin-coated (600 rpm for 5 min in a WS-400B-6NPP/LITE spin-coater from Laurell Technologies Corporation) in ambient air under N2 flow. The spin-coated films were annealed at 110 °C for 10 min in vacuum. Both buffer layers and Au anodes were deposited with a vacuum evaporator (Edwards Auto 306) from a ceramic jar and a Mo boat, respectively. Vacuum was close to 6 × 10−6 mbar during each deposition, and the growth rates were kept low during the processes (≤0.01 nm s−1). For all the cells, the buffer layer thickness was optimized to ∼5 nm. Au (thickness = 50 nm) was evaporated through a shadow mask in order to form OSC devices.
The structures of the measured OSC devices are: ITO|ZnO (25 nm)|P3HT/PCBM (110 nm)|buffer layer (5 nm)|Au (50 nm). A schematic picture of the investigated solar cells is presented in Fig. 2.

Characterization
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics in dark and under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight illumination (50 mW cm−2) were measured by using an E5272A source/monitor unit (Agilent). The AM 1.5 sunlight illumination was produced with a filtered Xe-lamp in the LZC-SSL solar simulator (Luzchem). All the measurements were carried out in air at room temperature, without encapsulation of the devices. It was not possible to perform a certified efficiency measurement during this work. However, it must be underlined that the scope of the present work is not to focus on the absolute efficiency values with respect to other published results, but rather to estimate the relative efficiency enhancements resulting from the use of novel buffer layers.
Results and discussion
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the prepared devices, under white-light illumination with an intensity of 50 mW cm−2, are shown in Fig. 2. Short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Uoc), calculated fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 1. The photovoltaic parameters of Table 1 are derived from the J–V curves recorded one day after the Au evaporation, by exposing the devices to ambient air conditions. In fact, it has been observed that the performance of inverted OSC devices containing ZnO typically improves upon air exposure.13 The devices were however stored in the dark in order to minimize the degradation of the P3HT/PCBM blend, whose deterioration in air is believed to be accelerated by exposure to light.27

In the prepared OSC devices, the ITO work function is modified by the introduction of the ZnO film. Hence, the work function difference between ITO (−4.7 eV) and Au (−5.1 eV) supports the electron transport from Au (anode) towards ITO (cathode) in short circuit conditions.13 Moreover, ZnO is used as a hole-blocking layer in environmentally stable inverted OSC, which plays a key-role in obtaining an electron-selective contact at the ITO electrode. The use of Au electrode, here adopted for better stability purposes.18
For such kind of inverted OSC, Uoc values are generally lower than conventional OSC devices. In solar cells, the photovoltage is not only determined by the HOMO (P3HT donor)–LUMO (PCBM acceptor) energy difference, but also influenced by the work function difference between the electrodes.28 In conventional OSC devices, ITO and low work function metal Al electrodes produce high built-in potential which results in high Uoc. In inverted OSC devices, the modified ITO (ZnO modified,13 polyethylene oxide (PEO) modified29) and high work function metal (Ag or Au) electrodes generate a low built-in potential, giving rise to a lower Uoc.
By comparing the results of the devices containing no buffer layer or Alq3 with Znb2 and its derivatives as buffer layer (Table 1), it is evident that introduction of Znb2 derivatives is beneficial to the device performance. In all the examples, the power conversion efficiency enhanced from 14–41% when switching from Alq3 to Znb2 cells. The better device performance is mainly due to an increase in the short circuit current, Jsc and in the open circuit voltage, Uoc.
The energy-level diagram illustrating the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of all the active layers used in the cells, together with the work functions of the electrodes, shown in Fig. 3, is taken from literature.6,13,26 In the present devices, the Znb2 buffer may play multiple roles: as a hole transporting and electron/or exciton blocking layer, as a modifier of the Au work function at the P3HT/Au interface, and as an encapsulation film by preventing the diffusion of Au clusters (resulting from its evaporation) throughout the organics. As shown in the Fig. 3, the LUMO of all Znb2 derivatives (∼−2.8 eV) is much higher than LUMO of either donor P3HT (−3.2 eV) or acceptor PCBM (−4.2 eV), showing that Znb2 can block reverse electron flow from PCBM to Au and thereby, effectively prevent the leakage current at the active layer/Au interface. In other words, Znb2 layer acts as the electron/exciton blocking layer.

It is also clearly seen (Table 1) that the short-circuit current of Znb2 containing devices was improved by 14–33% compared to the device containing Alq3, which might be due to better hole transport properties of the Znb2 derivatives. The increase in Uoc (highest for 1d, 0.55 V, sample 7, Table 1) can be explained by the increase in the built-in potential between ZnO-modified ITO and Au due to the modification of Au work function by the energy levels of all Znb2 derivatives. This is also responsible for an improved charge collection from the active layer, which can explain the increase in the Jsc, and thus in the overall device performance.
As for the device containing 1c and 1d derivatives, the improved performance comes from the comparable HOMO energy levels (Fig. 3) of both derivatives (−5.6 eV and −5.36 eV respectively) with the work function of Au (−5.1 eV) and HOMO energy level of P3HT (−5.2 eV) which favours efficient hole movement from P3HT to 1c or 1d to Au anode. The phenomenon is more favourable in the 1d containing device, where the difference between the HOMO level of P3HT and 1d is small (0.16 eV), which results in a higher Jsc up to 5.22 mA cm−2, and in a Uoc of 0.55 V. Additionally, the improved performance for the 1d derivative comes also from the high FF of 0.64. The η increased further up to 3.90% when a double buffer layer “Alq3|1d” was used. The largest improvement for the device containing the Alq3|1dbuffer layer (sample 9 in Table 1) might be attributed to an efficient step-wise hole movement occurring to an Au electrode, which significantly enhances Jsc up to 5.87 mA cm−2, and consequently results in the high η.
The stability of the devices was tested during a total period of 245 days. From the J–V curves for the Alq3 and 1d containing cells recorded in the mentioned time interval, the photovoltaic parameters were derived, as shown in Fig. 4 as a function of the degradation time (expressed in days). The η of a solar cell, which reflects the capability of the device to convert the incident light into electricity, is directly proportional to Jsc, Uoc and FF. Thus, by plotting these parameters as a function of time one can get an unambiguous picture of the device degradation. All the photovoltaic characteristics are normalized to their initial values. For all the measured cells, the photovoltaic parameters improved during an initial time frame, then become stable and finally start to degrade. For the device containing Alq3buffer layer, the device is fairly stable but efficiency decreases down to 75% of its initial value, whereas for the cell containing 1d the efficiency first improves up to 138% after 35 days, and then slowly starts to decrease being however still higher than the initial value after 245 days. For the Alq3 containing sample, the device performance is reduced by the significant decrease of Jsc and FF after approximately 20 days. The Uoc remains constant, as observed earlier in other published works.18 The increased efficiency for 1dcells is due to a significant increase of Jsc values in time, which can be attributed to improved charge transport and hole collection phenomena. It was mentioned that, the vacuum-deposited Znb2 film becomes more crystalline in time, and thus it improves its charge transport properties due the inherent dimeric structure of the Znb2 derivatives in its crystalline form.20 While Jsc increases, Uoc and FF remain constant for almost the total period of degradation measurements. The improvement of all the photovoltaic parameters for 1d containing cells with respect to those including Alq3 also indicates that the Znb2 buffer layer can prevent the diffusion of oxygen or vapour to the active layer (P3HT/PCBM layer) much more efficiently than Alq3. The reproducibility of the described degradation trends was verified by investigating several devices with an identical structure.

In spite of the moderate efficiencies exhibited by the present devices compared to the highest state-of-the-art solar cells, their long-term durability in air is certainly an interesting feature to be investigated deeply. From our studies, the introduction of the Znb2 buffer layers seems to be the key-factor for achieving more stable cells, and this makes the Znb2 derivatives a very interesting class of compounds for the development of stable and efficient solar cells.
Conclusions
The recently synthesized Znb2 complex and its derivatives have been investigated as buffer layers in P3HT/PCBM based inverted OSC with an Au anode. The performance of the solar cells has been compared to that of similar devices containing a typical Alq3buffer layer or no buffer layer between the active layers and Au anode. The higher conversion efficiencies (η) achieved for the cells including the Znb2 derivatives with respect to those with Alq3buffer layers indicate that Znb2 derivatives have excellent hole transport properties, efficient electron/exciton blocking properties, better energy level alignment at the buffer layer|Au interface and increase in anode work function compared with Alq3. Moreover, Znb2 derivatives are believed to donate electrons/energy to P3HT, which is also beneficial for the device performance.
The performance was enhanced up to 30% for the 1d derivative, which represents the most interesting compound for future use. The higher efficiency of the 1dcell with respect to the others is related to its electrochemical properties. The HOMO level of 1d is very close to the Au work function, thus generating an ohmic contact between 1d and the Au electrode which enhances the Jsc of the solar cells. The combination of Alq3 and 1d in a double buffer layer is however the most promising for achieving efficient devices. The improvement in η up to 40% was observed with respect to a device containing a single Alq3buffer layer.
The stability of the devices has been accurately studied in a time frame of 245 days. In spite of the exposure to open air conditions during the whole preparation and characterization, the durability of the solar cells is excellent. In all the cases, no significant loss of performance has been observed. The buffer layer effectively blocks the diffusion of oxygen and water vapour through the active layers, which has a detrimental effect on the cell stability. The devices containing a Znb2 derivative are more stable than the Alq3 ones, and their efficiency after 245 days is higher than the initial value.
The key-role of Znb2 derivatives in the enhancement of the cell efficiency and stability suggests the use of this class of compounds as a new interesting alternative to other widely known buffer materials. The presented results could be applied to more advanced and highly efficient devices as well, combining the advantages of the high performance with the long durability ensured by the introduction of Znb2 buffer layers.
