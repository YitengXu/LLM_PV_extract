    , Accepted 2nd January 2016First published on 4th January 2016AbstractWe have synthesized a novel isoindigo-based electron donor polymer (PDBTPI) for organic photovoltaics. The alternating polymer comprising isoindigo and di(1-benzothieno)[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DBTP) moieties provides the highest power conversion efficiency of over 7% among DBTP-based polymers and a promising efficiency among isoindigo-based polymers.
For decades, polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively studied to discover new-types of conjugated backbone systems that satisfy several strict terms, including appropriate bandgaps for effective absorption of solar energy, low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels for a high open circuit voltage (VOC) value, and strong π–π stacking for excellent charge carrier mobility.1–7 The most popular way to control the bandgap is to alternate electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient (A) monomers along the polymeric backbone. D–A interactions lead to efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the D and A unit, facilitating π electron delocalization along the conjugated backbone.8–11 Furthermore, alternating weak electron donating (WD) and strong electron accepting (SA) units in a polymer system is ideal for down-shifting the HOMO energy level of polymers while maintaining a low bandgap.12–16 Thus, several WD materials, such as 2,7-carbazole,17–19 benzodithiophene,20–22 indacenodithiophene,23–25 and naphthodithiophene,26–28 have been developed to achieve deep HOMO energy levels with improved VOC characteristics.
Isoindigo is an excellent SA candidate as it has a rigid and planar structure and shows a remarkable high field-effect mobility of up to 3.62 cm2 V−1 s−1 in polymer systems.29 However, isoindigo-based polymers have not been considerably successful in the PSC field as only Geng et al. reported a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 8% by using poly[N-dedocyldithieno[3,2-b;6,7-b]carbazole-alt-N,N′-di(2-octyldodecanyl)-isoindigo] (P(IID-DTC)).30–37
In this study, to further the applications of isoindigo in PSCs, we designed and synthesized a novel conjugated polymer, poly[(11-(2-hexyldecyl)-di(1-benzothieno)[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-3,8-diyl)-alt-((E)-1,1′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-isoindigo-6,6′-diyl)] (PDBTPI), via Suzuki coupling of a dibrominated isoindigo monomer and a diborylated di(1-benzothieno)[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DBTP) moiety. Recently, we developed a DBTP monomer with a highly rigid and planar structure and WD characteristics.38 The alternating polymerization of isoindigo and DBTP moieties provided the highest PCE among DBTP-based polymers, as well as a promising efficiency among isoindigo-based polymers of over 7%. The photovoltaic J–V characteristics were investigated and discussed in terms of the molecular structure, orientation, and morphology of the blended film. We suggest that isoindigo-based polymers have great potential as donor polymers in OPVs, and are currently developing PDBTPI derivatives to improve the photovoltaic performance.
The two monomers, 11-(2-hexyldecyl)-3,8-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-di(1-benzothieno)[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DBTP-B)38 and 6,6′-dibromo-N,N′-(2-ethylhexyl)-isoindigo (IID-Br),39 were synthesized according to literature procedures, and their 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra are available in the ESI.† The final PDBTPI polymer was successfully obtained via Suzuki coupling of DBTP-B and IDD-Br, as shown in Scheme 1. It showed excellent solubility in chlorinated solvents (e.g., chloroform, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene) and possessed a sizable molecular weight. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of PDBTPI was 33000 g mol−1 (PDI = 2.24), as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as a standard.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic scheme for the PDBTPI polymer. 
The absorption and emission spectra of PDBTPI were measured in chloroform or in the film state, as shown in Fig. 1 and are summarized in the ESI.† Absorption maxima (λmax,abs) of PDBTPI in solution and film appeared at 376 and 602 nm and 376 and 605 nm, respectively. The absorption covered the entire visible spectrum in the range of 350 to 700 nm40 with an optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.68 eV, calculated from the film-state absorption onset wavelength. The absorption in the film state was broader than that in solution; the long-wavelength absorption was highly developed in the film state, indicating that π–π intermolecular stacking was highly enhanced. Stark differences in the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were also observed in the solution and film states. The emission maximum of PDBTPI in the film was red-shifted by 16 nm as compared to that in solution, which also indicated superior intermolecular interactions in the film state. The enhanced molecular ordering in the film can be explained by the polymer backbone structure. The ground-state (S0) geometric structures of the two repeating units in the polymer backbones were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The calculated molecular structure, the HOMO, and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are shown in Fig. 2. PDBTPI is bonded with two fused backbone units, DBTP and IID. The fused repeating units induce rigidity into the polymer backbone, but the dihedral angle of two benzene rings was 35° at the DBTP/IID junction. Thus, the twisted backbone sites of the polymer were likely partially disordered in solution, but the planar DBTP and IID units induced strong π–π interactions in the film state, resulting in large conformational changes.

As shown in the frontier orbitals (Fig. 2), the HOMO of PDBTPI showed a strong backbone contribution and electron delocalization along the entire molecule. In contrast, the LUMO was largely localized on the electron withdrawing monomer. This confirms that PDBTPI is composed of push–pull structures via efficient ICT interactions between electron rich DBTP and electron deficient IID, thus inducing a low bandgap.41
The HOMO (EHOMO) and LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) of PDBTPI were measured via cyclic voltammetry (CV), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and DFT calculations. CV, the most popular method to determine the energy levels of conjugated polymers, revealed that the ECVHOMO, and ECVLUMO, of PDBTPI were −5.24 and −3.55 eV, respectively, from the oxidation and reduction onset potentials relative to ferrocene as an internal standard; the cyclic voltammogram of PDBTPI is shown in Fig. 3(a). The measured ECVg, was 1.69 eV, which was in a good agreement with the optical bandgap (Eoptg) (1.68 eV). Next, using UPS, the EUPSHOMO, was determined from the onset (EFVBM) and the high binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) region of the neat PDBTPI film;42 the spectra are shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). The EUPSHOMO, of PDBTPI was −5.02 eV, which was quite similar to the theoretical EDFTHOMO, of −4.99 eV.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the following configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDBTPI:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices (under an AM 1.5G solar simulator with a power density of 100 W cm−2) based on the PDBTPI:PC71BM blend ratio are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. PDBTPI:PC71BM devices showed the highest PCE of 7.04% with a VOC value of 0.818 V, a JSC value of 12.62 mA cm−2, and a FF value of 68.6% at a weight ratio of PDBTPI:PC71BM = 1:2 when 3 v/v% of 1,8-diiodooctane was mixed with chlorobenzene. Compared with the other blend ratios of PDBTPI:PC71BM, PDBTPI:PC71BM (1:2 w/w) devices showed a highly improved FF value. In general, series resistance (Rs) results from the resistance of the contacts and shunt resistance (Rsh) from the leakage current providing an alternate current path for the photo-induced current,43,44 and FF is closely related to Rs and Rsh characteristics.45 Thus, the improved FF can be explained by the highly reduced Rs value of 281 Ω cm2 and Rsh of 3.77 × 106 Ω cm2, which was twice that of other devices having different blend ratios of PDBTPI:PC71BM. As shown in Fig. 4(b), series resistance and leakage current in the dark were significantly reduced at the optimized blend ratio.

In addition, the considerable difference in FF was originally thought to be related to the difference in the molecular ordering and the p–n heterojunction morphology of the active layer. To investigate the molecular orientation of the PDBTPI:PC71BM blend films, two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) was performed on the neat polymer film (ESI†) and the blend films; the 2D-GIXD patterns of PDBTPI:PC71BM at different blend ratios are shown in Fig. 5. The neat PDBTPI polymer showed a strong edge-on orientation with an average interval of (h00) reflections along the Qz axis of 0.40 Å−1, corresponding to a layer spacing of 15.62 Å for the (100) crystal, d(100). In the blended films, the reflection at approximately 1.1 Å−1 appeared to be azimuthally uniform, originating from PC71BM. As shown in Fig. 5, the PDBTPI:PC71BM film showed intense (h00) reflections along the Qz axis, indicating edge-on π–π stacking. To gain a deeper insight into the orientation, we performed azimuthal angle scans on the blend films (Fig. S5, ESI†). We defined the areas integrated with azimuthal angle χ ranges of 0–60° (or 120–180°, Axy) and 60–120° (Az) as those corresponding to the fractions of face-on and edge-on orientations, respectively. It is interesting to note that the ratio of Axy to Az (Axy/Az) for the PDBTPI:PC71BM (1:2 w/w) film was higher than that for the blend films for the corresponding two blend ratios (1:1 or 1:3). This means that the population of the face-on orientation is larger in the PDBTPI:PC71BM (1:2 w/w) film than in the corresponding other two blend films. Note that a vertical π-overlap between “face-on” polymer chains yields more favorable structures to transport charge carriers in PSCs.46,47 Thus, the molecular orientation is preferred at a weight ratio of PDBTPI:PC71BM = 1:2, facilitating the charge carrier transportation to the electrodes in OPVs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the PDBTPI:PC71BM blend films also supported the 2D-GIXD results. As shown in Fig. 5, PDBTPI:PC71BM (1:2 w/w) films showed a bicontinuous network structure with nanofibrillar crystallites, but other blended films exhibited featureless morphologies. Combined with the 2D-GIXD results, it is expected that PDBTPI:PC71BM (1:2 w/w) films form well-ordered nanostructures with the preferred π–π orientation.

In summary, we developed a novel alternating polymer (PDBTPI) composed of isoindigo and DBTP. The absorption of the neat PDBTPI film covered the entire visible area with excellent intermolecular ordering. The BHJ-type PDBTPI:PC71BM device exhibited a PCE of 7.04% (VOC = 0.818 V, JSC = 12.62 mA cm−2, FF = 0.686) at a weight ratio of PDBTPI:PC71BM = 1:2. We demonstrated that PDBTPI has great potential as a high-efficiency donor polymer due to its high VOC of 0.818 V with an excellent FF of 68.6%. In this study, we reported moderate JSC characteristics compared to champion polymers such as PTB721 and PffBT4T-2OD,5 but we are currently developing new PDBTPI derivatives to enhance the JSC value while maintaining the high VOC and FF.
