    , Accepted 4th January 2012First published on 10th January 2012AbstractA symmetric squaraine and its related non-symmetric structure are shown to have comparable efficiencies in DSCs, but with undoubtedly advantages in the low cost and easiness of synthesis for the symmetrical structure.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 have attracted a significant attention as a low-cost alternative to conventional n–p junction photovoltaics. The most successful sensitizers are based on ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, yielding above 11% solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies (PCE).2 Despite several merits, the main disadvantages are their lack of absorption in the far-red/near-IR region together with their low molar extinction coefficients (rarely above 20000 M−1 cm−1). By contrast, organic sensitizers possess larger molar extinction coefficients (30000–300000 M−1 cm−1), extended spectral sensitivity even in the NIR light portion and are easier to prepare and purify, offering lower cost, while exhibiting excellent characteristics for DSC applications.3
A number of Ru-free dyes have so far been developed4 and the relationship between their chemical structures and the photovoltaic performances has been examined.5 Among them, squaraines are well known for their intense but sharp absorption in the red/near-IR regions that can be tuned to the desired long-wavelength region, while exhibiting a considerable photo- and thermal stability. The common idea is to focus on asymmetrical rather than symmetrical squaraines, in order to favour a directionality of the charge-transfer band in the excited state6 (see Table S1, ESI†).
In this work, we report on the synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, electronic and photovoltaic properties of a low cost symmetrical squaraine, coded VG1-C8, which contains two anchoring groups (Fig. 1a). To take aback the preconceived criteria that the tailor of asymmetrical squaraine is highly desirable to reach good PCE,7 the results obtained hereby are compared with the corresponding well known asymmetrical squaraine (SQ01).6a While the investigated sensitizers have been already reported,6a,8 within this communication we finally demonstrate that symmetrical and asymmetrical squaraines have different characteristics and properties, but they can be both excellent sensitizers for DSC, giving comparable efficiency in the cell. In fact, the number of anchoring groups, as well as the length and the nature of alkyl chain,7,9 play an important role as much on optical properties as on cell efficiency.

The symmetrical VG1-C8 can be obtained according to a two-step procedure using commercially available precursors. This easiness of synthesis comes in opposition to the asymmetrical SQ01 which requires five steps combined to two chromatographic purification procedures (see Scheme S1, ESI†). The synthetic pathways reported in the literature6a,8 were followed with only a slight modification giving an overall yield of less than 40% for SQ01 and more than 60% for the VG1 series. Worth noting that by contrast to the literature,8 symmetrical dyes can be easily purified by crystallization, a feasible process for upscaling.
In order to assess the influence of the number of carboxy-conjugate moieties and the length of the alkyl chain, two other symmetrical squaraines were synthesized and herein used as reference (see Fig. S1, ESI† for detailed structures). UV-Vis absorption as well as steady-state fluorescence emission spectra show, in general, a negative solvatochromism which accounts for a higher polarity of the ground state with respect to the excited state10 (Fig. S2, and S3, ESI† and Tables S3–S5, ESI†). The symmetrical structure shows superior spectroscopic properties (such as red-shift, higher molar extinction coefficient, lifetime and quantum yield, see Fig. 1b and c), stressing further the fact that this structure can also be very promising as an efficient sensitizer for TiO2.
To fully understand the different interaction between SQ01 and VG1-C8 with TiO2, FTIR spectra of dyes (KBr pellets) and ATR spectra of sensitized TiO2 on TCO glass were performed (Fig. 2). The strong absorption band observed at 1596 cm−1 can be attributed to the CC stretching in the four-membered ring11 (see Fig. S7, ESI†) while the band at 1676 cm−1 is the typical CO stretching of an aromatic carboxylic acid. This latter signal clearly disappears in the ATR spectrum of VG1-C8 adsorbed on the electrode, suggesting that VG1-C8 can be linked with both COOH to the semiconductor surface allowing the long chains probably lay away from the TiO2 surface.

A DFT optimization of molecular structures for both symmetric and non-symmetric dyes (using models in which the alkyl chains on the indolenine nitrogens have been substituted by methyl moieties) has been performed to gain insight into the energy levels of the different conformations (trans–cis) and into the nature of the excited states involved in the electronic injection. Results for SQ01 are in agreement with literature data6a and are reported in ESI.† For both dyes, the energy difference between the trans and cis conformation is about 0.8 kJ mol−1, while the energy barrier for the rotation around the C–C bond is 11–13 kJ mol−1, suggesting the co-existence of both conformations in solution (see Table S7, ESI†). In the case of the symmetric dye the cis conformation has higher polarity (4.05 Debye), thus indicating a high charge separation and an electron density anisotropy comparable to that of the asymmetrical model dye.
The analysis of the absorption spectra was carried out at a TD-DFT level. Computed data are in good agreement with experimental results, within the systematic overestimation of the Vertical Excitation Energy (VEE) typical of the TD-DFT framework and the absence of solvent effects. For all dyes, the main transition is associated with the lowest energy excited state, corresponding to a π/π* HOMO–LUMO transition, mainly localized on the squarainic core (see Table S7, ESI†). Transition involving indole localized orbitals (Fig. 3) presents smaller oscillator strengths but, according to the literature,6a provides important contributions to the electron density delocalization, being responsible for the directionality of the electron injection into TiO2. This strongly anisotropic high energy transition has a lower transition probability in the asymmetric structure compared to the symmetric one, suggesting that the LUMO + 1 is less populated upon excitation. Moreover, for the symmetric dye, HOMO to LUMO + 1 transition in the cis conformation has lower oscillator strength than the corresponding HOMO to LUMO + 2 transition in the trans configuration, but its contribution to the excitation is much higher (82% versus 56%). According to these results, the effectiveness of VG1 dyes in transferring electrons in the titania may lay in the occupancy of higher-energy molecular orbitals characterized by electron density localization on the carboxylic moieties. Moreover, the supposed cis conformation (Fig. 3) would have the electron density anisotropy necessary for an efficient electron injection.

The ground-state oxidation potentials of the dyes were measured with cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry techniques. The values of 0.11 and 0.16 V vs.Fc+/Fc were found, respectively, for SQ01 and VG1dyes.‡ It indicates a stabilization of the HOMO of VG1-C8 compared to SQ01 and the anodic shift of 50 mV is due to an additional –COOH group in VG1dyes (see Fig. S11, ESI†). The observed reduction potentials are −1.50 V and −1.43 V vs.Fc+/Fc for SQ01 and VG1-C8, respectively. The values of electrochemical potentials are relatively close for these two dyes and are very suitable for efficient charge transfers (i.e. injection and regeneration). From a thermodynamic point of view, we could expect a faster regeneration in VG1-C8 as a result from a higher driving force for hole transfer to iodide.
The photovoltaic properties of SQ01 and VG1-C8 were investigated in association with a volatile electrolyte. For both molecules, a concentration ranging from 0 to 30 mM of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was adjusted within an ethanol-based dye solution containing 0.1 mM of squaraine. As a result from the increase of CDCA concentration, all the photovoltaic parameters were increasing simultaneously (Table S8, ESI†), stressing the beneficial effect of CDCA to circumvent the quenching of the dye excited state owing to aggregated moieties anchored onto the TiO2 surface. The best performances were obtained using a dye solution containing 20 mM of CDCA. This is in good agreement with a previous report on SQ01 by Yum et al.6a With such a ratio, the CDCA also competes with the dye adsorption reducing the dye loading but also the access for tri-iodide onto the TiO2 surface. Our results also indicate the role of CDCA to be more preponderant in the case of the symmetric squaraines, suggesting their larger tendency to form aggregated moieties.

Fig. 4(a) reports the (J–V) characteristics of optimized SQ01 (in dash) and VG1-C8 (in plain)-based sensitized solar cells. Interestingly, the symmetrical squaraine gives higher power conversion efficiency than the asymmetrical counterpart ca. 4.6% vs. 4.2%, respectively (efficiency as high as 4.5% has been reported for SQ01 in the best condition6a). This experimental result goes particularly against the belief that only asymmetrical structures yield good photovoltaic properties. VG1-C8 is able to generate more photocurrent, by almost 1 mA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, than SQ01. However, regardless of light intensity, this benefit comes partially compensated by a loss of photovoltage.
 Fig. 4  (a) Comparison of the (J–V) recorded either under dark, 10, 50 and 100 mW cm−2 light illumination (A.M. 1.5 G) for SQ01 and VG1-C8 and (b) comparison of the IPCE spectrum for SQ01 and VG1-C8. 
The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve recorded for VG1-C8 and SQ01 (Fig. 4b) shows a strong photon conversion between 600 to 700 nm. A maximum of IPCE (86%) is reached at 650 nm; the IPCE trace of VG1-C8 is comparatively similar at the exception of a broad band taking place in the blue part of the light (around 400 nm). Note that this band seems intrinsic to the dye rather than related to presumably H-aggregates since increasing the CDCA concentration has absolutely no noticeable effect on its evolution. However, another benefit of VG1-C8 over SQ01 is nested in its enhanced red response. Whereas VG1-C8 displays a comparable onset of conversion at 500 nm with a closed maximum of 88% at 660 nm, one could notice a very similar decline of absorption, however shifted by 15 nm towards the red. This enhanced light response is thus at the origin of the observed higher photo-current generation when using VG1-C8 as a dye.
The dye structure does not influence noticeably the distribution and the energetic of the trap states. Only a slight downshift is experienced in association with the symmetric VG1-C8. This is by contrast to the electron lifetime which is more markedly affected (Fig. S12, ESI†). The self-assembled monolayer made of VG1-C8 seems to promote to some extent the back reaction in comparison to SQ01 (ca. two times lower electron lifetime). The slight downshift of the trap states together with the higher recombination rate constant could be at the origin of the lower photovoltage recorded on VG1-C8.
Herein, we present for the first time a detailed analysis of the photovoltaic performances of a low cost symmetric squaraineversus the related non-symmetric structure. The experimental and computational results showed that both non-symmetrical and symmetrical squaraines can be successfully used in DSC with comparable efficiencies, but with undoubtedly advantages in the easiness of synthesis for symmetrical structures. Directionality in the charge injection from dye to TiO2 can be also observed in symmetrical structures if a cis conformation is supposed.
Finally, this work is intended to open the way to a large number of optimized symmetrical squaraine structures, whose synthesis can be easily scaled up, and which will become the reference sensitizers in the far red/NIR region.
