We demonstrated that both the hole mobility and suitable energy levels of these polymers are important factors in PSCs using organic field-effect transistors (OTFTs) and cyclic voltammetry analysis. The doping effect and the hydrophobic properties of the HTLs were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and water contact angle measurements. The results show that the PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT based PSCs showed the best PCE of 14.1% and 12.0%, respectively when compared with spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs which have a PCE of 10.2%.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells have shown substantial growth in recent years.1–6 In 2012, Park et al. introduced solid-state mesoscopic heterojunction perovskite solar cells using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole transporting layer. They achieved a power conversion efficiency of 9.7%.1 To date, the efficiency has been boosted to ∼22%.7 HTLs play an important role in adjusting the energy levels, optimizing the surface and facilitating carrier mobility. Though spiro-OMeTAD has competitive performance and compatible energy levels, this small molecule has lots of drawbacks such as their complex synthesis, instability and high cost. Conjugated polymers are promising candidates in low cost/large area electronic applications, such as organic-light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic field-effect transistors (OTFTs).8–12 Conjugated polymers containing thienothiophenes (TT) and bithiophene (BT) repeating units, such as PQT and PBTTT, have shown the high OFET charge carrier mobility of PQT can reach up to 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing within its liquid crystalline temperature range.13 Whereas PBTTT has better mobility (0.72 cm2 V−1 s−1) than PQT due to its high molecular packing orientation through the symmetry centre of thienothiophene.14 If we compare both polymers, the conformational freedom of the unsubstituted bithiophene repeating units in PQT leads to a reduction in the effective conjugation along the backbone. In addition, the repeating units of PBTTT have a rotational symmetry along the polymer axis, which helps facilitate optimal backbone, side-chain packing and highly ordered microstructure. Herein, we used both PQT and PBTTT as the HTL materials for PSCs.
Donor–acceptor (D–A) based conjugated polymers are another alternative for high performance OTFT applications. Among the D–A type conjugated polymers, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has attracted a considerable amount of attention over the past few years due to their high mobility. Since the first DPP based polymer semiconductor for OTFTs was reported in 2008,15 more than 30 DPP based polymers have been reported to show a charge carrier mobility greater than 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of any of the other D–A type conjugated polymers.16–21 With a suitable combination of the electron-accepting DPP unit and other electron donating building blocks, polymer semiconductors with mobility values of around 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 or greater can be obtained.22 In this study, two DPP based polymers, PDQT and PDBT-co-TT, were chosen as HTLs in PSCs. We added lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) as a dopant to study the mobility and conductivity of the four polymers, and fabricated the devices with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/perovskite/HTL/Au. Furthermore, we have used the cross-linkable interlayer [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester (PCBSD) on top of the ZnO to enhance the device performance. According to the report of T. L. Kelly et al.,23 the acidic nature of the ZnO surface leads to deprotonation of the methylammonium cation, leading to loss of methylamine and the formation of PbI2. The above problems can be improved using C-PCBSD, which was reported previously by our group.24–26 The C-PCBSD interlayer shows a hole-blocking ability and facilitates electron transfer in the photovoltaic devices. It is envisaged that the C-PCBSD layer can generate a smoother and more hydrophobic surface on ZnO to block moisture and thus improve the lifetime of the device. The PCE of PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT further reach 14.1% and 12.0%, respectively, which are much higher than that of the corresponding spiro-OMeTAD device (Fig. 1).

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Spiro-OMeTAD, PQT-12, PBTTT-14, PDQT and PBDT-co-TT were purchased from Lumtec Corp., Taiwan. All other chemicals were obtained from Aldrich and used as received.
2.2. Device fabrication procedures
Herein, we prepared five kinds of PSC devices: (a) spiro-OMeTAD, (b) PQT-12, (c) PBTTT-14, (d) PDQT and (e) PDBT-co-TT.
For the fabrication of device (a) (spiro-OMeTAD), ITO glass substrates (purchased from Wintek, Taiwan; sheet resistance 30 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in an ultrasonic bath, and then dried overnight in an oven at >100 °C. For the electron transport layer, zinc acetate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 mg mL−1) and a small amount of ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich), spin-casted on the pre-cleaned ITO substrates and baked at 170 °C for 10 min in air to form the ZnO layers with a thickness of 40 nm. 0.5 wt% of PCBSD was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). For the device fabrication with the cross-linked PCBSD (C-PCBSD) interlayer, the solution was spin-casted onto the ZnO layer to form a thin film with a thickness of ca. 10 nm. The film was annealed at 170 °C for 10 min in a glove box. 460 mg of PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 1 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was spin-coated on the top of the ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 15 s. After drying for 15 min in the glove box, the substrate was heated on a hot plate at 70 °C for 10 min. Then, the substrate was dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I (Front Materials Co. Ltd) in anhydrous IPA (10 mg mL−1) for 40 s and washed with IPA. Thereafter, the HTMs were coated via a solution process using the following methods. spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Front Materials Co. Ltd. 80 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 mL of 4-tertbutylpyridine and 17.5 mL of Li-TFSI (520 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) were dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The obtained solution was spin-coated on the top of the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s.
For the fabrication of device (b) (PQT-12), all the procedures were the same except PQT-12 was used to replace spiro-OMeTAD. PQT-12 (Lumtec Corp.) was coated on the top of the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 1 min using a PQT-12/ODCB solution (15 mg/1 mL) with or without 20.1 μL of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (28.3 mg/1 mL) and 10.2 μL of tributylphosphine (TBP) as additives, respectively.
For the fabrication of device (c) (PBTTT-14), PBTTT-14 (Lumtec Corp.) was coated on the top of the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s using PBTTT-14/ODCB solution (15 mg/1 mL) with or without 20.1 μL of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (56.6 mg/1 mL) and 10.2 μL of TBP as additives, respectively.
For the fabrication of device (d) (PDQT), PDQT (Lumtec Corp.) was coated on the top of the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 60 s using a PDQT/ODCB solution (7.5 mg/1 mL) with or without 20.1 μL of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (28.3 mg/1 mL) and 10.2 μL of TBP as additives, respectively.
For the fabrication of device (e) (PDBT-co-TT), PDBT-co-TT (Lumtec Corp.) was coated on the top of the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 60 s using a PDBT-co-TT/ODCB solution (7.5 mg/1 mL) with or without 20.1 μL of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (28.3 mg/1 mL) and 10.2 μL of TBP as additives, respectively.
Finally, Au (80 nm) was evaporated on the top of the HTLs through a shadow mask under vacuum (<10−6 Torr). Each sample consists of four independent pixels defined by an active area of 0.04 cm2.
2.3. Device characterization
The devices were encapsulated with epoxy glue and characterized in an air under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 simulated light (Yamashita Denso solar simulator). The current–voltage characteristics of the PSCs were obtained using a Keithley 2400 SMU apparatus. Solar illumination conforming to the JIS Class AAA was provided using a SAN-EI 300 W solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The light intensity was calibrated using a Hamamatsu S1336-5BK silicon photodiode. The IPCE spectra were measured using a lock-in amplifier with a current pre-amplifier under short-circuit conditions with illumination using monochromatic light from a 250 W quartz-halogen lamp (Osram) passed through a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Hole mobility and conductivity
The conductivity and hole mobility of an organic semiconductor are important factors for achieving high device performance.27,28 To measure the conductivity and hole mobility of the different HTMs, we made OTFTs to investigate their variation with and without the Li-TFSI dopant. The conductivity variation of the thiophene based polymers PQT-12 and PBTTT-14 are plotted in Fig. 2a. The conductivity of the pristine PQT-12 and PBTTT-14 thin films are 2 × 10−5 S m−1 and 3 × 10−5 S m−1, respectively. After doping with Li-TFSI, their conductivity increased to 6 × 10−3 and 2 × 10−2 S m−1 (Table 1), respectively, which are 2–3 orders higher than the undoped polymers. The conductivity of the two DPP based polymers are plotted in Fig. 2b. The undoped PDQT and PDBT-co-TT have a much higher conductivity of 2 and 6 S m−1, respectively. After doping with Li-TFSI, the values decreased to 2 and 1 S m−1, respectively. This phenomenon is probably caused by the lower probability of DPP oxidation.

The effective mobility of the pristine and doped materials was calculated and plotted as a function of the charge density, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3a. The mobility of the pristine thiophene based polymers PQT-12 and PBTTT-14 show poor hole mobilities of 3.48 × 10−6 and 1.64 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Upon using the ionic dopants, the hole mobility increased enormously to 2.44 × 10−4 and 2.83 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The mobility of the two DPP based polymers are plotted in Fig. 3b. The undoped PDQT and PDBT-co-TT have a hole mobility of 0.513 and 1.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Upon doping the Li-TFSI into the polymers, the hole mobility decreased to 1.68 × 10−2 and 5.11 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The Li-TFSI dopant was found not suitable for the two DPP based polymers.
 Fig. 3  The ID–VG curve obtained for PQT, PBTTT-14, PDQT, PDBT-co-TT in the OTFT devices. 
Furthermore, we used AFM to measure the surface roughness of the doped and undoped polymers, which were spin-casted on the silicon surface (Fig. S1, ESI†). With the exception of PDBT-co-TT, the roughness increased after doping for the other three polymers.
3.2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
We also used CV to measure the HOMO and LUMO levels of the doped and undoped polymers. According to the report of T. Park et al., good doping can help to lower the HOMO energy levels of HTMs and show an enhancement in the JSC.29,30 The oxidation potential of the thiophene-based polymers PQT and PBTTT-14 were increased about 0.1 eV after adding the ionic dopant. This occurred because the ionic dopant exerts an electron-withdrawing effect. The result makes both the hole transporting materials closer in energy with the perovskite. This may alter the hole transporting behaviour. The HOMO energy levels of the doped and undoped DPP based polymers are similar. The influence of the ionic dopant was not obvious because DPP has a strong electron-withdrawing group. The HOMO energy levels of these four materials are summarized in Table 1.
3.3. Photovoltaic performance
Four polymers were used as the HTLs in PSCs with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/perovskite/HTL/Au. We measured the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs prepared from the different HTMs under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation. Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves obtained from the best-performing solar cells among the 10 devices prepared using each HTM. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. For both the thiophene-based polymers, the doped PQT-12 (D-PQT-12) device exhibits a JSC = 14.2 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.93 V and FF = 51.5%, corresponding to a PCE = 6.8%, while the D-PBTTT-14 device displays a JSC = 16.9 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.96 V and FF = 64.6%, yielding a PCE = 10.5%. However, the undoped PQT-12 and PBTTT-14 devices show lower performance with efficiencies around 3–4%, which was mainly attributed to their lower JSC and FF values (Table 3). Upon the addition of the Li-TFSI dopant to PQT-12 and PBTTT-14, the JSC values increase from 8.82 and 9.16 to 14.23 and 16.89 mA cm−2, respectively. The Li-TFSI dopant contributes to the significant increase in the JSC because the mobility of both doped polymers increases dramatically (Table 1).

For the DPP based polymers, the undoped PDQT and PDBT-co-TT devices show higher performance when compared to the doped devices. The undoped PDQT device shows a JSC = 11.74 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.92 V, FF = 52.7% and PCE = 5.76%, while the undoped PDBT-co-TT device displays a JSC = 14.45 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.96 V and FF = 67.2%, yielding a PCE = 9.31%. Although the PDQT device showed a relatively high mobility of 0.513 cm2 V−1 s−1, the LUMO of PDQT (−4.00 eV) was lower than that found for the perovskite (−3.92 eV) and the hole–electron recombination was very serious in this device. That is the reason why the PCE value of the PDQT device was low. The power conversion efficiency of D-PDQT and D-PDBT-co-TT was only around 4%. The doped spiro-OMeTAD (D-spiro-OMeTAD) device yields a JSC = 18.03 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.97 V, FF = 56.0% and PCE = 9.7%. The results demonstrate D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT have the potential to replace the expensive spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs (Fig. 4).
We also used C-PCBSD as an interfacial layer on the top of the ZnO layer to enhance the performance observed for both the D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT polymer devices (ITO/ZnO/C-PCBSD/perovskite/HTL/Au). The results are summarized in Table 3. The highest performance was obtained from the devices prepared using D-PBTTT-14 HTM after we introduce a cross-linking electron transporting interlayer PCBSD. The best-performing device parameters yield a JSC = 18.02 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.01 V, FF = 65.1% and PCE = 14.1%. The device containing the PDBT-co-TT HTM layer shows a JSC = 19.25 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.92 V, FF = 67.5% and PCE = 12.0%. Both PCE values are much higher than that observed for D-spiro-OMeTAD (10.2%). The EQE curves obtained for the undoped and doped PQT-12, PBTTT-12, PDQT and PDBT-co-TT devices are depicted in Fig. 5 and Fig. S2–S5 (ESI†). The EQE results coincide with the current densities shown in the J–V curves. According to a previous report,31 a device constructed with a low temperature spin-casted ZnO ETL will always show a small degree of current hysteresis because the charge extraction on the ZnO surface is very efficient. The hysteresis of both the D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT devices are also relatively small (Fig. 6 and Fig. S6, S7, ESI†).

3.4. Long-term stability
In order to investigate the effect of the HTLs on the stability of the perovskite layer, we measured the contact angles (α) of deionized water on the different HTLs surfaces. The results showed that the water contact angle of the HTL films was 100.4° for PBTTT-14 and 90.5° for PDQT. When we fused two thiophenes to the thienothiophene, higher α values were obtained, 101.6° for PQT-12 and 102.1° for PDBT-co-TT. All four HTL materials displayed a much higher contact angle than spiro-OMeTAD, which showed an α value of 66.5°. The bigger contact angle can prevent water penetration and protect the perovskite layer from moisture more effectively.32,33 The devices made from the high contact angle HTM layers are expected to have better stability. Fig. 7 shows the long-term stability data for the three best devices based on the spiro-OMeTAD, D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT HTLs with an C-PCBSD interlayer. The results demonstrate that the PCE of spiro-OMeTAD with the PCBSD device decays to 20% of its original value after 96 h. However, both the D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT with PCBSD devices, retain over 60% of their original PCE values after 96 h. The results are in accordance with the contact angle data.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated several ITO/ZnO/perovskite/HTL/Au PSC devices using four conjugated polymers including PQT-12, PBTTT-14, PDQT and PDBT-co-TT to replace the well-known p-doped spiro-OMeTAD. D-PQT-12 and D-PBTTT-14, which show a hole mobility of 2.44 × 10−4 and 2.83 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively in OFET, while PDQT and PDBT-co-TT have a hole mobility of 0.51 and 1.11 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. We observed that the Li-TFSI dopant has a stronger impact on the mobility of the thiophene-based when compared to the DPP based polymers.
Among the conjugated polymers we studied, D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT showed a good power conversion efficiency of about 10%, which is comparable with that of the well-known p-type doped spiro-OMeTAD devices. After adding a C-PCBSD modification layer on the top of the ZnO layer, the PCE of D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT reached 14.1% and 12.0%, which are the highest values observed for perovskite solar cells using conjugated polymers as efficient HTLs for the PSC device structure. The water contact angle measurements reveal that both D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT show higher α values than spiro-OMeTAD. Both the D-PBTTT-14 and PDBT-co-TT devices reveal much better long-term stability than the spiro-OMeTAD device. These results emphasize that both polymers are suitable candidates to replace the expensive spiro-OMeTAD in high performance PSCs.
