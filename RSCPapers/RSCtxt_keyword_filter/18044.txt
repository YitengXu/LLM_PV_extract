    , Accepted 11th April 2014First published on 16th April 2014AbstractSingle and double junction solar cells with high open circuit voltage were fabricated using poly{thiophene-2,5-diyl-alt-[5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole]-4,7-diyl} (PBT-T1) blended with fullerene derivatives in different weight ratios. The role of fullerene loading on structural and morphological changes was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD and AFM measurements showed that a higher fullerene mixing ratio led to breaking of inter-chain packing and hence resulted in smaller disordered polymer domains. When the PBT-T1:PC60BM weight ratio was 1:1, the polymer retained its structural order; however, large aggregated domains formed, leading to poor device performance due to low fill factor and short circuit current density. When the ratio was increased to 1:2 and then 1:3, smaller amorphous domains were observed, which improved photovoltaic performance. The 1:2 blending ratio was optimal due to adequate charge transport pathways giving rise to moderate short circuit current density and fill factor. Adding 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive into the 1:2 blend films further improved both the short circuit current density and fill factor, leading to an increased efficiency to 4.5% with PC60BM and 5.65% with PC70BM. These single junction solar cells exhibited a high open circuit voltage at ∼0.9 V. Photo-charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (Photo-CELIV) measurements showed the highest charge carrier mobility in the 1:2 film among the three ratios, which was further enhanced by introducing the DIO. The Photo-CELIV measurements with varying delay times showed significantly higher extracted charge carrier density for cells processed with DIO. Tandem devices using P3HT:IC60BA as bottom cell and PBT-T1:PC60BM as top cell exhibited a high open circuit voltage of 1.62 V with 5.2% power conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received prominent attention in the last two decades as an alternative to inorganic solar cells because of their low production cost and compatibility with flexible substrates.1–9 Such solar cells can be processed from solution using a variety of low cost techniques such as spray coating,10–12 dip casting,13 screen printing,13 spin coating,14 and inkjet printing.15 This makes them a candidate for large-scale production via roll-to-roll processing.16 Despite those advantages, the efficiency and lifetime of polymer solar cells are still too low for commercialization. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most widely studied conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications, and when blended with fullerene, it results in efficiencies up to 5%. One of the performance-limiting factors in P3HT is the photocurrent generation owing to its higher band gap; therefore, only a small part of the solar spectrum is absorbed. Hence there is a need for a low band gap conjugated polymer for broader solar spectrum utilization.
Recently, a variety of donor–acceptor (D–A) or push–pull type polymer structures17 have been proposed and synthesized to obtain polymers with lower band gap and higher charge carrier mobility. These D–A polymers consist of alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient units. Based on the selection of these units, the energy levels and charge transport properties of the donor polymers can be finely tuned. Among the various acceptor units, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) has been used in optoelectronic devices18–22 with wide success owing to the resulting low-lying HOMO level of the polymer, which leads to not only larger open circuit voltage (Voc) but also to higher stability against oxidation. Helgesen et al.22 reported a series of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT)-based co-polymers with different substituted thiophene groups as donor units; however, their study focused primarily on synthesis and optical property characterization. One of the polymers in the literature reported moderate photovoltaic efficiency of 2.22% and a Voc of 0.93 V. However, to attain high power conversion efficiency using low band gap polymers in photovoltaic devices requires a meticulous effort to tailor the nanomorphology for efficient charge generation and collection at respective electrodes. Several device-processing parameters need to be optimized, including polymer fullerene weight ratio, thickness of active layer, charge selective interfacial layers, selection of solvents23 and solvent additives24,25 and device architectures.26,27 Poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothia diazole) (PCDTBT) serves as an ideal example to explain why processing parameters need to be considered. The first report28 of PCDTBT exhibited an efficiency of 3.6% when blended with PC60BM. Further optimization in blend ratios, choice of parent solvents, and solvent additives increased efficiency to 5.5–7% with almost 100% internal quantum efficiency for optimized solar cells.20,29,30
In this study, we used a BT-based polymer, poly{thiophene-2,5-diyl-alt-[5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole]-4,7-diyl} (PBT-T1) as a donor blended with fullerene derivatives in different mixing ratios. By optimizing fullerene mixing ratios and solvent additives, device efficiency up to 5.65% was obtained by tailoring the nanomorphology with structurally ordered donor phase resulting in higher charge carrier mobility.
2. Experimental section
PBT-T1 was synthesized according the procedure shown in the ESI.† Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were purchased from Nano-C. Chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) sol–gel was synthesized as per the procedure adapted from Stubhan et al.31 Briefly, 2.17 g of zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O] and 3.8 mg of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate [Al(NO3)3·9H2O] were dissolved in 100 ml ethanol at 80 °C for 2.5 hours, followed by filtering using a 0.45 μm PVDF filter to remove any formed precipitate.
Commercially available indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent water, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol sequentially for 20 minutes each. Sol–gel AZO was spun coat at 3000 rpm for 60 seconds to form a 25 nm thick film. The samples were then annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes. AZO-coated ITO substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box where the active layer was spun coated at different speeds for 60 seconds. The polymer was blended with fullerene to maintain a total concentration of 40 mg ml−1 with weight ratios 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and stirred overnight. Once the active layer was coated, it was then transferred to a thermal evaporator where 10 nm molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and 80 nm of silver were thermally evaporated at 10−6 torr. Active areas of all the solar cells were determined to be 0.16 cm2 as measured by the area of shadow mask. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured in both dark and illuminated conditions using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer. For illumination, a xenon lamp was used, whose light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was verified by a national renewable energy laboratory (NREL)-calibrated photodiode. For external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement, the xenon lamp was attached to a Newport monochromator, and two lenses focused monochromatic light onto the active area of the sample. The light output was modulated from 350 nm to 850 nm, and EQE calculations were made using NREL photodiode as reference.
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded for all films using AZO coated on ITO/glass slides as blank.
Topographic images of PBT-T1:PCBM films were taken using an Agilent 5500 SPM microscope. A Si tip (Budget Sensors Tap 300Al) having resonant frequency close to 285 kHz was used for topography and phase measurements via tapping mode. Thickness measurements were also performed using AFM by scratching the films with sharp blade and then measuring the thickness across the scratched interface. Gwyddion software was used to process and analyze the AFM images.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer. Thin films were prepared on AZO-coated ITO glass slides by spin-coating the blend solutions at 500 rpm for 60 seconds. Patterns were recorded utilizing parallel beam configuration.
Photo-charge extractions by linearly increasing voltage (Photo-CELIV) measurements were performed using dye laser (OBB OL-401) pumped by a nitrogen laser pulsing at 337 nm (OBB OL-4300). The output of the dye laser was confined to 640 nm using a monochromator and appropriate dye. Pulse width of this laser was measured to be 1 ns by taking the rise time of a fast photodetector, and the pulse rate was maintained at 1 Hz. An increase in voltage of 1.5 V was applied in 12.5 μs (80 kHz) and delay time (5 μs) were applied using a custom labview program that interfaced a signal generator (Rigol DG 1022) and 350 MHz mixed signal oscilloscope (Agilent MSO7034B). The cells were placed in a DC offset close (±0.05 V) to open circuit voltage of the respective cells to ensure that no charge generation or injection occurred during these measurements.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structure of the polymer PBT-T1 under study. As mentioned earlier, the difference between the earlier reported polymer22 and the current one is the change in the solubilizing side chain alkoxy group from C14H29O to C12H25O. Synthesized PBT-T1 was found to dissolve in a wide range of organic solvents such as xylene, chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. The optical band gap estimated from the onset of optical absorption in solution and in solid film was found to be 1.92 eV and 1.73 eV, respectively. When cast as film, a red shift of absorption onset from 640 nm in chloroform solution to 714 nm in solid film is seen. Moreover, two vibronic peaks at 612 nm and 661 nm were observed indicating structural order within the polymer when cast as a thin film.

Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of inverted structure PBT-T1:PC60BM solar cells using indium tin oxide electrode as the cathode. An aluminum-doped zinc oxide thin layer was used as the hole-blocking interface. Among all solvents, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and chlorobenzene (CB) (ESI†) gave the best results due to higher solubility of PBT-T1 in DCB and CB. The schematic of the device is shown in Fig. 2a. PBT-T1 was blended with PC60BM in different weight ratios in DCB to determine the optimal mixing ratio. It is evident from the graph in Fig. 2b and Table 1 that 1:2 blend films showed moderate power conversion efficiency of 3.02%, with a maximum of 3.18% achieved for the best devices. The efficiency reported here is higher than 2.22% (ref. 22) reported earlier for the similar polymer when blended in a 1:2 ratio. The difference in performance primarily due to short circuit current density could arise from different length of side chains in the molecular structure of the polymer or from the different device architecture used; however, due to unavailability of the earlier reported polymer, further explanation could not be provided. The performance limiting factor for most cells was due to a lower fill factor and lower short circuit current density. Solar cells having a 1:1 blended active layer (PBT-T1:PC60BM) showed the lowest current density, fill factor and open circuit voltage with respect to active layers with higher PCBM weight ratios. Comparing the best devices in 1:2 and 1:3 blended solar cells, one can see that the Jsc is comparable; however, on an average, 1:3 devices consistently showed lower FF and Jsc. Moreover, the behavior in the dark of these cells showed a considerable difference. In the dark J–V curves shown in Fig. 2c, it is seen that among all blending ratios, the 1:2 PC60BM has the lowest dark current below the threshold voltage (0.82 V), indicative of the lowest recombination current among all devices cast with only DCB as solvent. Determination of diode parameters in the dark is important to establish the relationship between the morphology and charge-transporting photovoltaic devices.32,33 From the linear fits of inverse slopes in the low bias (<0.1 V) and high bias (>0.9 V) regions, the shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) of the solar cells were calculated and are listed in Table 2. Shunt resistance is the highest for cells processed in 1:2 weight ratio. The 1:2 cells also possessed lower series resistance compared with cells having 1:3 blend active layers. Moreover, the reverse saturation current (J0) and ideality factor (n) were measured from the exponential region of the dark current–voltage regions. A significant decrease in both J0 and n were observed for 1:2 blend solar cells. J0 decreases by almost four orders of magnitude from 1:1 to 1:2 blend devices and is further increased by 24 times when PC60BM loading is increased from 1:2 to 1:3. Similarly, we observe the ideality factor of the diode to be lowest in 1:2 blend solar cells. Low J0 and n are indicative of reduced trap assisted recombination34 in the solar cells blended in a 1:2 weight ratio. Hence, a 1:2 blend was found to be the optimum mixing ratio for PBT-T1 and fullerene derivatives. To further enhance the power conversion efficiency in 1:2 blend devices, additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used at a small volume concentration (2 or 2.5 volume%), and a significant improvement in fill factor and power conversion efficiency were observed. For 1:2 blended devices with 2.5 volume% DIO, the average FF increases from 0.46 to 0.65. The average Jsc increased slightly from 7.12 mA cm−2 to 7.53 mA cm−2. A 60 mV decrease in Voc is observed for devices cast with the DIO additive, which is most likely due to narrowing of the band gap, leading to a slightly higher HOMO level. The higher HOMO level can be caused by improved crystallinity induced by lower solubility of the polymer in DIO, leading to an upward shift in the HOMO level of PBT-T1, as observed in other polymers.35,36 Moreover, in devices processed with additive DIO, the J0 and n are further suppressed, indicating the lowest charge carrier recombination in these solar cells. Inclusion of DIO as solvent additive leads to a decrease in Rs and a more significantly enhanced Rsh, by almost two orders of magnitude. The power conversion efficiency is further enhanced by employing PC70BM as acceptor leading to the highest power conversion efficiency of 5.65%. Improvement in Jsc using PC70BM is attributable to the increased photocurrent generation in 400 nm to 600 nm, as seen in EQE spectra (Fig. 2d). This increased photocurrent is caused by the enhanced absorption coefficient of the PC70BM in the visible region of the UV-visible spectrum. For PC70BM, a slightly lower concentration of DIO (2 volume%) was required compared to PC60BM (2.5 volume%) due to higher solubility of PC70BM in DCB.37

To investigate the role of PC60BM on the underlying morphology and structure, UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained to study the optical properties of PBT-T1:PC60BM, as seen in Fig. 3a. The 1:1 blend film absorption spectrum has characteristic vibronic peaks similar to those of the pure polymer film in Fig. 1b, indicating that structural order is maintained within the polymer phase when blended with PCBM in a 1:1 weight ratio. As the PBT-T1:PC60BM blending ratio was increased to 1:2 and 1:3, a blue shift in the onset of optical absorption was observed. Moreover, a broadening of vibronic shoulders was observed, connoting a higher degree of disorder in films with a higher PCBM blending ratio. This behavior is similar to the case of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), where the structural order of P3HT was disrupted when higher PCBM ratios were used.38–40 Hence increasing the PCBM blending ratio leads to breaking of polymer chain packing, resulting in turn in a higher amorphous phase of polymer. This is further supported by in-plane XRD measurements in Fig. 3b. A sharp peak at 2Θ = 4.4° was found in both PBT-T1:PC60BM 1:1 blend ratio film without additive and in 1:2 blend ratio films with DIO additive, which strongly implies the inter-chain packing order. Moreover, in the 1:2 blend films cast from DCB with DIO additive, the shoulders in absorption spectra (Fig. 3a) are very distinctively highlighted, suggesting strong order within the polymer phase, further supporting the XRD measurement that crystalline chain packing within the polymer phase is not broken by PCBM. However, the peak is almost completely suppressed in 1:2 blend films without DIO additive, suggesting loss of inter-chain packing order is induced by introducing a higher ratio of PCBM. A small peak at 2Θ = 8.8° is also observed for films processed with 2.5 volume% DIO, corresponding to second order (200) diffraction. The (200) diffraction is suppressed for 1:1 blend films, suggesting that films casted from DIO possess a higher structural order.

Fig. 4 shows AFM (a–d) topography, and (e–h), phase images of PBT-T1:PCBM thin films, in which (a, e) 1:1, (b and f) 1:2, and (c and g) 1:3 were cast from DCB without additive, whereas in (d and h), 1:2 were cast from DCB with 2.5 vol% DIO as solvent additive. Large fiber domains with widths ranging from 40 to 50 nm were seen in 1:1 blend film, leading to surface root mean square (RMS) roughness of 2.34 nm. However, when the PCBM weight ratio was increased to 1:2 and 1:3, smaller domains were observed. The RMS roughness for 1:2 and 1:3 blended films were 0.375 nm and 0.407 nm, respectively. The 1:2 blend film exhibited a thinner fibrillar network with fibers ranging from 15 nm to 20 nm in width (Fig. 4f). The fiber widths were measured from average values obtained in several line profiles on the topographic images and cross checked with the corresponding phase images. As the PCBM weight ratio increased to 1:3, shorter and thinner fiber-shaped domains are observed (Fig. 4g). Correlating with the results obtained in absorption and XRD spectra, higher fullerene loading not only leads to breaking of inter-chain packing but also leads to smaller domains. When PC60BM loading is low, the polymer phase tends to aggregate into larger domains, as seen in 1:1 cast films, and when PC60BM loading is increased to a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio, polymer aggregation is prevented, leading to smaller amorphous phases. When DIO was added to a PBT-T1:PCBM (1:2) blend solution, it led to formation of nanocrystalline polymer domains, confirmed by XRD and as seen in Fig. 4d and h. These domains are of similar shape to 1:1 cast films but of smaller dimensions, having average widths of about 30 nm and lengths ranging from 30 to 35 nm. Films cast with DIO additive have an RMS roughness of 1.75 nm.

To correlate the underlying morphology with charge transport, Photo-CELIV measurements were performed with varying delay times to find the mobility and to measure extracted charge carrier density as a function of delay time. Fig. 5a serves as a visual guide, showing a typical Photo-CELIV signal obtained along with indications of tmax, j0 and Δj. The shaded portion in the graph shows the extracted charges (Qext) from the Photo-CELIV signal. Fig. 5b shows the Photo-CELIV curves at 4 μs delay time for PBT-T1:PCBM solar cells with different PC60BM weight ratios and 1:2 solar cells processed with 2.5 vol% DIO additive. The results from Fig. 5b are summarized in Table 3. From Fig. 5b we observe a higher Δj for 1:2 compared with 1:1 and 1:3 ratios, indicating a higher charge carrier density in 1:2 blend solar cells. The tmax observed for 1:2 is 3.5 μs. For 1:1 blend devices, a slightly shorter tmax of 3.05 μs is observed, whereas the 1:3 device showed longest tmax of 5.25 μs. The tmax is the indication of the increase in voltage required to extract the charges; hence for 1:1 and 1:2 blend devices, a lower bias voltage is required to extract the maximum charge. We believe that higher bias voltage is required for 1:3 devices because the amorphous nature of the polymer leads to deeper defect states. However, the extracted charge carrier density in 1:3 is higher than in 1:1 blend devices due to finer phase separation, as observed in the AFM images. The 1:2 blend devices showed the highest mobility of 4.04 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 among all blend devices processed from DCB. For 1:2 devices processed from a DCB and DIO mixture, the mobility is further enhanced to 6.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the shorter tmax and higher extracted charge carrier density (next). Fig. 5c shows the variation of next with delay time in Photo-CELIV measurements. The next reduces with higher delay times due to greater recombination of charge carriers before the voltage ramp is applied. The log–log plot of nextvs. delay time shows power law decay, and such a trend is indicative of bimolecular recombination.41 The decay of next in the 1:1 and 1:3 blend devices is much faster than that in the 1:2 blend devices due to higher recombination. The 1:2 ratio devices with and without DIO additive showed reduced recombination decay, leading to higher extracted carriers.

Having reached an understanding of the role of fullerene loading on the morphology and charge transport, we then employed optimized blends ratio in a double junction tandem devices with P3HT:IC60BA as the bottom cell and PBT1:PC60BM as top cell. PBT-T1 has a partially overlapping and complementary absorption spectra with P3HT. Due to high open circuit voltage shown by PBT-T1, it serves as an attractive option for tandem solar cells. Fig. 6a shows the fabricated device structure of inverted tandem solar cells. PEDOT:PSS and AZO/PEIE layers were used as the interconnecting layers. The results of single and tandem devices are tabulated in Table 4. The fabricated tandem structure has a Voc of 1.62 V, which is 90 mV lower than the sum of Voc of the single cell (1.71 V), and this small loss could arise from ineffective recombination at the interconnecting layers.42 However, the tandem cell showed a higher power conversion efficiency of 5.22% compared with individual sub-cells having 4.55% PCE for P3HT:IC60BA and 3.81% for PBT-T1:PC60BM. To achieve a higher power conversion efficiency the thickness of the sub-cells needs to be further optimized to realize current matching.

4. Conclusion
A 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-based polymer was used in organic solar cells with high open circuit voltage of ∼0.9 V for single junction and 1.62 V for double junction devices. Effects of PCBM weight ratios on the optical and electrical characteristics of bulk heterojunction film were investigated and correlated with nano-morphological changes. Increasing PCBM loading in the active layer blends led to more amorphous polymer chains with smaller domain sizes. The 1:2 mixing ratio was found to be optimal for device performance. By adding small amounts of additive DIO to the parent solvent for a 1:2 mixing ratio, photovoltaic performance was further improved due to lower series resistance, larger shunt resistance and higher charge carrier mobility caused by the improved structural order within the polymer phase. Photo-CELIV measurements with varying delay time showed that 1:2 cells exhibited higher density of extracted charge carriers, and that it was further enhanced when processed from a DCB + DIO solvent mixture. Power conversion efficiency for single junction devices at 1:2 blending weight ratio with additive reached up to 5.65% with a high open circuit voltage of 0.9 V. In addition, double-junction solar cells using P3HT:IC60BA as the bottom cell and PBT-T1:PC60BM as the top cell also exhibited a high Voc of 1.62 V and device efficiency of 5.22%.
