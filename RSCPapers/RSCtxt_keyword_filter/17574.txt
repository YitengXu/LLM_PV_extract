    , Accepted 5th September 2011First published on 20th October 2011AbstractWe highlight the effect of the interfacial charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells based on two cobalt redox shuttles, namely cobalt(III/II) tris(2,2′-bipyridine) and cobalt(III/II) tris(1,10-phenanthroline). Highly porous counter electrodes based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) prepared by electro-oxidative polymerization are compared to the typically employed platinized FTO glass, with the former showing much lower charge transfer resistances for both cobalt complexes, leading to improved fill factors and to linear response of the short circuit photo-current density to light intensity up to one sun. Based on these findings, an excellent power conversion efficiency of 10.3% was achieved with a recently reported organic sensitizer and PEDOT as counter electrode.

Broader context
A major chunk of nowadays energy sources is still based on ever limiting fossil fuels and nuclear power. However, these technologies are environmentally harmful, leading to increasing efforts in finding suitable environmental friendly and renewable replacements. One crucial approach is the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy via efficient solar cells. Hereby, dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are cheap and a viable route towards clean energy. In this context, our work highlights the major impact of the counter electrode material on the performance of dye sensitized solar cells based on cobalt complexes as alternative redox shuttles. In particular, replacing the standard platinum with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), a dramatic improvement in a power conversion efficiency of up to 10.3% in conjunction with an organic sensitizer was achieved, being the highest value so far reported for non-hazardous metal free cells based on organic dyes and cobalt redox couples. These findings will significantly propel future research in high performance, cheap, and environmental friendly dye sensitized solar cells as energy sources.


        Cobalt complexes, among other redox couples,1 have recently been proven quite successful as alternative to the omnipresent triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox shuttle in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) close to 10% have been reached, mainly owing to the higher redox potential and thus higher open circuit potential VOC compared to I3−/I−.2–4 However, cobalt complexes are delicate to handle and meticulous device- and sensitizer engineering is pivotal to achieve high performance. For instance, it has been shown that specific modifications on the dye or the incorporation of a blocking layer on the TiO2 surface are required in order to retard the fast recombination between TiO2 conduction band electrons and the oxidized species of the one-electron transfer system cobalt(III/II).5–7 In addition to this problem of fast electron back transfer, the slow diffusion of the cobalt-based redox-active species may limit the short circuit photocurrent density JSC at full solar intensity, posing a major obstacle to achieving high power conversion efficiencies with cobalt complexes as redox couples.8–10 In this work, we illustrate how mass transport limitation of the JSC can be avoided by using a three dimensional electro-active material at the counter electrode that guarantees a low interfacial charge transfer resistance. In contrast to I3−/I−, the conventional platinized (Pt) counter electrode does not turn out to be the best candidate for the reduction of Co(III).11 Instead, highly porous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) counter electrodes, which have been proven successful for various redox couples,12–14 were utilized, resulting in a major improvement in cell performance. In conjunction with the recently reported organic Y123dye, an excellent PCE of 10.3% was achieved, the highest up to date for DSCs based on organic sensitizers, a cobalt (II/III) based redox couple and a cheap and abundant PEDOT counter electrode.
All DSCs presented in this work were fabricated using an 8 μm transparent TiO2 layer consisting of an average particle and a pore size of 20 nm and 32 nm, respectively. An additional 4 μm thick light scattering layer composed of 400 nm particles was deposited as well. The complete film was treated in a 23 mM TiCl4 water bath at 70 °C for 30 min. For sensitization, this TiO2 photoanode was immersed for 18 h in a 0.1 mM 3-{6-{4-[bis(2′,4′-dihexyloxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino]phenyl}-4,4-dihexyl-cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2-yl}-2-cyanoacrylic acid (coded Y123, Fig. 1a) dye solution using a mixture of tert-butanol/acetonitrile (1:1 volume ratio) as solvent. Two different cobalt complexes were utilized for the studies, namely cobalt(III/II) tris(2,2′-bipyridine) (Co(bpy)3, Fig. 1b) and cobalt(III/II) tris(1,10-phenanthroline) (Co(phen)3, Fig. 1c) both being employed as [B(CN4)]− salt. The corresponding electrolytes contained 0.2 M [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)2 or [Co(phen)3](B(CN)4)2 and 0.05 M [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)3 or [Co(phen)3](B(CN)4)3 together with 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. PEDOT-based counter electrodes were fabricated by electropolymerization of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer on conductive FTO substrates using the ionic liquid N-ethyl, N-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluoro phosphate (EMIM FAP) containing 0.2 EDOT as polymerization medium.

In an effort to surpass the recently reported power conversion efficiency of 8.8% achieved with Y123 based DSCs employing the Co(bpy)3 redox couple and a thin 2.5 μm transparent TiO2 film,2 a thicker 8 μm transparent layer was introduced in this work in order to increase light harvesting and maximize the short-circuit photocurrent density. The J–V characteristics of a cell using the standard platinized counter electrode are shown in Fig. 2a (green curve) and the extracted photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, this device mainly suffers from a low fill factor FF of only 0.59, limiting the overall PCE to 7.9% at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G). Moreover, the J–V curve is marked by a drop in photocurrent upon lowering the forward bias potential. This lack of a steady-state current is reflected also by the current transient of this cell (Fig. 2b) in which a spike of the photocurrent is visible upon exposing the cell to light. Furthermore, over the time interval of 4 s for this transient measurement, the photocurrent did not level off, indicating the absence of a steady-state current as was already evident from the J–V curve. This behavior arises from the limitation of the photocurrent by the diffusion of the redox-active cobalt(III) complex from the sensitized mesoporous junction to the counter electrode, where the Co(III) is reduced to Co(II) complex. The growth of the diffusion layer at the counter electrode prevents the device from sustaining the initial photocurrent density generated in the cell.8,15 This rational is supported by the non-linear rise of JSC with increasing light intensity. As illustrated in Table 1 and Fig. 2c, JSC is not growing linearly up to 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) as the measured JSC at full sun is only 14.5 mA cm−2 instead of the 17 mA cm−2 expected from a linear extrapolation of the JSC values observed at lower light intensities. Options to avoid this mass transfer limitation of JSC include increasing the porosity or pore size as well as decreasing the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film or to simply raise the concentration of the cobalt(III) species.16 However, these measures suffer from unwanted loss of light harvesting capacity of the DSC and enhanced dark current, hampering cell performance. Therefore, we resorted to the introduction of a three dimensional PEDOT counter electrode which relieved the diffusion limitation of the photocurrent and lowered dramatically the interfacial charge-transfer resistance.

In (c), the red dashed square line represents the ideally linear JSC behavior in the absence of diffusion limitations for the Co(bpy)3 and the platinum counter electrode cell extrapolated from the value obtained at an intensity of 10 mW cm−2. The black dashed square line mirrors the same aspect for the other cells.

The blue J–V curve illustrated in Fig. 2a originates from a device where the platinized FTO glass has been replaced by a PEDOT-based counter electrode. The latter yields a striking improvement of all the photovoltaic parameters. Under standard AM 1.5 reporting conditions the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE values are 0.91 V, 15.9 mA cm−2, 0.71 and 10.3% exceeding largely the performance of the DSC based on Pt as catalyst for the counter-electrode reaction. The appearance of a table photocurrent plateau in Fig. 2b confirms the absence of mass transfer limitation of the JSC. Furthermore, for the PEDOT based counter-electrode, unlike platinum, the short circuit photocurrent scales linearly with light intensity as highlighted in Table 1 and Fig. 2c (blue curve). The direct consequence is an excellent PCE of 10.3%, which is amongst the highest values reported so far for organic sensitizers and counter electrodes in conjunction with cobalt as the alternative redox couple.
We investigated also Co(phen)3 as a redox couple since it has a 60 mV more positive redox potential (0.62 V vs.NHE) than that of Co(bpy)3 (0.56 V vs.NHE),4 offering the prospect of a higher open circuit potential. We compared again the performance of platinum with PEDOT based counter electrodes. The corresponding J–V characteristics are included in Table 1 and Fig. 2a. The platinized counter electrode yields JSC, VOC and FF values of 12.1 mA cm−2, 937 mV and 0.55, respectively, resulting in a PCE of 6.3%. The VOC of this device is 20 mV higher compared to Co(bpy)3 in accordance with expectations. However, the FF and JSC values are lower, resulting in an inferior overall performance. It appears that the diffusion limitation of the photocurrent for Co(phen)3 is more severe than for Co(bpy)3, as depicted in Fig. 2b by the current transients observed for the two redox couples. In fact, the extend of the initial photocurrent decay in the current transient measurement is more pronounced for Co(phen)3. In addition, similar to the Co(bpy)3 case, no steady-state photocurrent was reached as can be deduced from the current transient (Fig. 2b). When switching to the PEDOT counter electrode we again observe a significant improvement of FF and JSC to 0.69 and 14.8 mA cm−2, respectively, whereas the VOC remains rather unaffected. Eventually, these values lead to a remarkable PCE of 9.5%.
The dramatic enhancement in fill factor for both electrolytes resulting from replacing Pt by PEDOT as electrocatalyst at the counter electrode suggests that an alteration of the charge transfer resistance RCT plays a key role here.17 The RCT values for platinum RCT(Pt) and PEDOT RCT(PEDOT) counter electrodes were therefore determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Experiments employed symmetric thin layer cells (TLCs) consisting of two identical FTO electrodes loaded with electro-catalyst and were conducted at 0 V bias potential. The resulting Nyquist plots for symmetric cells based on the Co(bpy)3 as well as the Co(phen)3 electrolyte are shown in Fig. 3a for both the platinum and PEDOT catalyst. Fig. 3b depicts the enlarged RCT part of these Nyquist plots for better comparison. The Nyquist plot contains two components, i.e. a semicircle at high frequency resulting from the charge-transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface and a Warburg impedance in the lower frequency range reflecting the diffusion of the redox-active species in the electrolyte. RCT values were extracted from the semicircle at high frequency by fitting it to a simple equivalent circuit composed of a series resistance and an RC element. The obtained RCT values for the different systems are summarized in Table 1.

Regarding at first the case of the Co(bpy)3 electrolyte in conjunction with a platinized counter electrode, the high frequency arc is clearly visible in the corresponding Nyquist plot (green curve in Fig. 3a and b), and RCT(Pt) can be extracted to be 7.5 Ω cm2. Switching to PEDOT the Nyquist plot (blue curve in Fig. 3a and b) is mainly governed by the Warburg contribution, highlighting a striking reduction of RCT when using the PEDOT counter electrode. Fig. 3c depicts the RCT(PEDOT) when zoomed in the high frequency part of the Nyquist plot, indeed revealing the very low value of RCT(PEDOT) = 0.03 Ω cm2, a stunning decrease of two orders of magnitude compared to RCT(Pt). The origin of the low RCT(PEDOT) value can clearly be attributed to the high surface area of the electro-polymerized PEDOT film, taking into account that the above-mentioned resistances are only normalized to the geometric area of the cell, but not the real surface area of the electro-active material. However, in the present study the focus is on comparing two different types of counter electrodes and not on the intrinsic catalytic activities of both materials.
Thus there is a major reduction in charge-transfer resistance when using PEDOT instead of Pt as a catalyst, producing a significant benefit for the performance of Co(bpy)3 based DSCs. More specifically, besides the fill factor, the JSC appears to improve as well along with decreasing RCT. As the disappearance of the photocurrent decay in the current transients suggests (Fig. 2b), the diffusion limitation of the Co(III)(bpy)3 reduction current alleviated by PEDOT as a counter electrode seems to help maintaining the maximum current attainable in the cell. This effect is further reflected by the observed linear rise of the short circuit current density with light intensity for the PEDOT in contrast to the platinum based counter electrode devices (blue and green curves in Fig. 2c, respectively). At low light intensities, the JSC of both PEDOT and platinum DSCs are almost identical (Table 1 and Fig. 2c) whereas at 100 mW cm−2 illumination, a significant discrepancy of 1.4 mA cm−2 arises. We suggest this effect to be due to the 3-dimensional and porous morphology of the PEDOT layer reducing the diffusion distance and generating diffusion fields with radial symmetry (Fig. 4).

The influence of RCT on cobalt based DSCs is even more critical when using Co(phen)3 instead. J–V measurements revealed a significant drop in both FF and JSC, when switching from Co(bpy)3 to the Co(phen)3 redox shuttle for both platinum and PEDOT counter electrodes (Table 1). At first sight, following the line of argumentation applied for the Co(bpy)3 cells employing platinum and PEDOT counter electrodes, the explanation for this observation can be assumed to originate from a potentially higher RCT(Pt) for Co(phen)3 than for Co(bpy)3. The Nyquist plot resulting from the platinum counter electrode and the Co(phen)3 electrolyte symmetric cell (black curve in Fig. 3a and b) indeed implies a RCT(Pt) that by far surpasses that of Co(bpy)3 (green plot in Fig. 3a and b), with a value of 54 Ω cm2 instead of 7.5 Ω cm2 for Co(bpy)3 as summarized in Table 1. However, taking into account the PEDOT counter electrodes in conjunction with Co(phen)3, the Nyquist plot (red curve in Fig. 3a and b) reveals a RCT(PEDOT) that is nearly undetectable. Fig. 3d represents a magnified section of the high frequency range of the Nyquist plot, underlining the difficulty for determining a precise value for RCT(PEDOT). All that can be said at this point is that, when comparing RCT(PEDOT) for Co(phen)3 and Co(bpy)3, the former was even smaller than the one for Co(bpy)3, prompting us to estimate RCT(PEDOT) for Co(phen)3 to be less than 0.03 Ω cm2 as summarized in Table 1.
The still prevailing diffusion limitation for JSC is most likely caused by the larger size and therefore smaller diffusion coefficient of Co(III)(phen)3 compared to Co(III)(bpy)3.18,19 Based on the EIS measurements of symmetric PEDOT cells (Fig. 3), effective diffusion coefficients of Deff (bpy) = 1.0 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for Co(bpy)3 and Deff (phen) = 7.4 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 for Co(phen)3 were extracted from the Warburg resistance.20 The lower diffusion coefficient of the Co(phen)3 electrolyte together with the thick TiO2 film employed provides a reasonable explanation for the persisting photocurrent transients and thus inferior JSC.
Conclusions

        Platinum and PEDOT coated FTO glass was investigated as counter electrodes for DSCs employing the cobalt complexes Co(bpy)3 and Co(phen)3. PEDOT was found to dramatically reduce the heterogeneous charge transfer resistance and reduce mass transport related limitations of the photocurrent resulting in superior photovoltaic performance and a power conversion efficiency of 10.3%.
