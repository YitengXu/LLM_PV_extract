    , Accepted 20th September 2012First published on 20th September 2012AbstractTwo novel high molar extinction coefficient heteroleptic Ru(II) isomers, NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, based on carbazole antenna were synthesized with the aid of Knoevenagel reaction, to study the influence of the carbazole antenna and anchoring group (COOH) isomerization on the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), ground and excited state oxidation potentials, incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), and total solar-to-electric conversion efficiency (η) for DSSCs, and their device performances were compared to the benchmark dye N719. The photophysical and photoelectrochemical properties discussed herein addressed the significant impact of the carbazole antenna and the position of the anchoring group on JSC and η in DSSCs. Tetrabutylammonium (TBA) substituted NCSU-10 achieved efficient sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 over the whole visible range, extending into the near IR region (ca. 870 nm) with an excellent power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.37% under an irradiation of full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) with mask compared to 8.17% of N719 under optimized conditions. NCSU-10 outperformed N719 by 45% in molar absorptivity, 18.8% in JSC, and 14.6% in the total conversion efficiency. Molecular modeling studies (DFT/TD-DFT) of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ showed that the HOMO is delocalized not only on Ru and NCS but also on the carbazole with a large coefficient, indicating that the second charge generation transfer in the visible region at ∼400 nm is a mixture of metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and strong ligand–ligand charge transfer (LLCT) with a significant HOMO coefficient originating from the carbazole antenna (π) to the bipyridyl electron acceptor (π*). Moreover, DFT calculations showed that the 4,4′-isomer (NCSU-10) is a significantly stronger electron acceptor than the 5,5′-isomer (NCSU-10′), which explained the inferior electron injection and significantly lower JSC of the 5,5′-isomer.
1. Introduction
DSSCs have been attracting academic and commercial interests worldwide because of their superior performance under diffuse light conditions and low illumination levels, independent of incident light angle, and cost-effective means of manufacturing and energy conversion.1–24 Therefore, DSSCs present a real challenge to silicon-based semiconductor solar cells in the photovoltaic market. In a recent study, a comparison of two 10 kW systems, one made of silicon and the other based on DSSCs, was performed over an entire year under outdoor conditions to account for all kinds of weather conditions including rainy and cloudy days. It was shown that the total efficiency performance of DSSCs in photon-to-energy conversion outperforms silicon-based solar cells in all directions (N, S, W, and E) by 20–60%.25 This superior performance of DSSCs is because of their independence on the angle of incident light and high sensitivity during low levels of illumination.
For the design of efficient sensitizers for DSSCs, five requirements should be satisfied:26 (1) anchoring groups, e.g. COOH, SO3H or PO3H2, must exist not only to graft the dye onto TiO2 but also to ensure intimate electronic coupling between the excited state of the dye and the conduction band edge of TiO2, (2) the absorption of the dye should overlap with the solar emission spectrum to allow for the maximum power conversion, (3) the location of the excited state of the sensitizer should be above the edge of the conduction band so that the driving force for electron injection is thermodynamically favorable, (4) the redox potential of the electrolyte should be sufficiently positive compared to the HOMO of the sensitizer so that the hole generated in the sensitizer upon electronic excitation can be replenished effectively by an electron from the electrolyte, and (5) the sensitizer should be stable for at least 1000 h.27
Although N719 is considered as the benchmark dye, it lacks absorption in the red and near-infrared (NIR) regions. Moreover, both high and low energy MLCT peaks of N719, 1.44 × 104 and 1.42 × 104 M−1 cm−1,28 respectively, have low molar extinction coefficients. This opens new avenues for the molecular engineering of more efficient dyes if they can exhibit a better light harvesting efficiency and higher molar extinction coefficient while maintaining their ground and excited state oxidation potentials thermodynamically favorable for dye regeneration and efficient electron injection into the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2.
Polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes containing thiophene, ethylene-dioxythiophene (EDOT),29 and triphenylamine30 were shown to exhibit a higher molar extinction coefficient than N719. Although a few Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes containing the carbazole antenna exhibited a higher molar extinction coefficient than N719,31–33 they contained an electron donor spacer between carbazole and bipyridyl. The highest molar absorptivity achieved for the low MLCT band for these sensitizers was 1.61–1.63 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Molecular orbital calculations performed on these sensitizers demonstrated that the HOMO is delocalized on the Ru and NCS group with no delocalization on the carbazole antenna.
In a study by Bignozzi's group,34 the influence of the COOH anchoring group position, 4,4′- versus 5,5′-isomer, on the photophysical and photoelectrical properties was studied for N3 dye (acid form of N719) and its 5,5′-isomer. It was shown that the quantum yield of the electron injection of the 5,5′-based sensitizer was significantly lower than that of the 4,4′-isomer. However, the underlying reasons of the inferior quantum yield of electron injection and significantly lower short-circuit photocurrent density of the 5,5′-isomer were not rationalized.
In this study, two novel heteroleptic Ru(II) polypyridyl isomers based on carbazole antenna, NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, were designed without an electron donor spacer, synthesized and characterized for DSSCs. Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures of the two sensitizers and the ancillary ligand containing carbazole was synthesized using Knoevenagel reaction. The DSSCs performance of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ was studied using a combination of spectrophotometric, photoluminescence, photoelectrochemical measurements, and molecular modeling. Under the same experimental conditions, which were the optimized conditions of N719, it was demonstrated that NCSU-10 outperformed N719 by 14.6% in the total conversion efficiency and 18.8% in the short-circuit photocurrent density. Moreover, the photovoltaic results showed that changing the anchoring group position from 4,4′- to 5,5′-position decreased the JSC from 18.01 mA cm−2 (NCSU-10) to 5.6 mA cm−2 (NCSU-10′).

The primary objectives of the molecular engineering of these novel sensitizers were: (1) to develop novel sensitizers that exhibit a better light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and a narrower HOMO–LUMO gap than N719 by directly attaching a strong electron donor (carbazole) to bipyridyl via CHCH, without an electron donor spacer, to destabilize the HOMO while maintaining its energy thermodynamically favorable for hole replenishment to regenerate the dye and the excited-state oxidation potentials (E* Ru3+/2+) of the sensitizers above the CB edge of TiO2, to ensure a negative free energy change of electron injection (−ΔGinj), and hence a thermodynamically favorable excited-state for efficient electron injection, (2) to determine the influence of using the carbazole antenna without an electron donor spacer on the likelihood of the HOMO delocalization on carbazole, and (3) to completely unravel the fundamental reasons behind the perplexing photovoltaic's performance of the two isomers NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ and to explain why the anchoring group of the 5,5′-isomer (NCSU-10′) leads to an inferior quantum yield of electron injection and significantly lower short-circuit photocurrent density than that of the 4,4′-isomer (NCSU-10).
2. Experimental
Materials
The solvents and chemicals were either purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific or TCI-America and used as received. Sephadex LH-20 was purchased from Fisher Scientific.
UV-Vis spectra absorption and fluorescence spectra
UV-Vis spectra were recorded in a 1 cm path length quartz cell on a Cary 3 Spectrophotometer. A dimethylformamide solution of each complex of 2 × 10−5 M was prepared, and the absorbance was measured and the extinction coefficient was calculated in each case.
Fluorescence spectra were recorded in a 1 cm path length quartz cell using 2 × 10−5 M solutions on a Fluorolog-311. The emitted light was detected in the steady state mode using a Hamamatsu R2658 detector, and the emission decay was detected in the lifetime mode using a Hamamatsu R928 detector using the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) mode for lifetime measurements. The emission was measured in the steady state mode by exciting at the λmax (lower energy MLCT band) for each dye with exit and entrance slits set at 10 nm. In the case of lifetime measurements, time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed on a solution of dye sensitizers in DMF by exciting the sample using a pulse laser (460 nm, NanoLED) at a 1 MHz repetition rate with an average power of 1.9 pJ per pulse, for a duration of 1.3 ns. The time of arrival of the photon counting (TAC) range was adjusted to 200 ns in order to measure the emission decay lifetime (lowest excited state lifetime) using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC).
FT-IR
Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infra Red (ATR/FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet, Nexus 470 FTIR Spectrophotometer with Omnic 7.2 software. The compound under investigation was placed in its powder form on a germanium crystal and a pressure probe was placed in position to apply consistent pressure on the sample. An average of 32 scans was used at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The complexes and intermediates were characterized using the same parameters. Fig. S3 and S4† show the FT-IR of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ in the pure form, respectively.
Mass spectrometry
ESI-MS was recorded on an Agilent Technologies 6210 LC-TOF mass spectrometer in the negative ion mode. The sample was prepared in methanol in the presence of a small amount of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH). The fragmenter voltage was set at 220.0 V and results from 17 scans in the case of NCSU-10 and 11 scans of NCSU-10′ were averaged. Fig. S5 and S6† show the ESI-MS of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ with one TBA per molecule, singly charged, respectively. The ESI-MS patterns shown in Fig. S5 and S6† and 64 are the patterns of ruthenium isotopes of m/z = 1296.4505 [M − 2H + TBA]−1.
Temperature dependent 1H-NMR experiments

1H-NMR experiments in the temperature range 25–56 °C were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz instrument using deuterated DMSO-d6 as a solvent. Temperature profiling experiments revealed better resolution in the spin–spin coupling as the temperature increased up to 56 °C. Fig. S7† shows the temperature dependent 1H-NMR experiments for NCSU-10. Fig. S8 and S9† show a zoom-in on the aliphatic region, CH3 and CH2, respectively. Fig. S8† shows that the two triplets were well resolved at 56 °C indicating that the 2 CH3 are not chemically equivalent because they appear at different chemical shifts. Although the 2 CH3 appear to have similar chemical environments, which should be if and only if the two ancillary antennas rotate at the same speed, based on the 1H-NMR this is not the case. Similar behaviors were observed with the 2 CH2 showing two quartets well resolved at 52 °C, shown in Fig. S9.† Fig. S10† shows the 1H-NMR of NCSU-10′. Fig. S11 and S12† show a zoom-in on the aromatic regions, of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, respectively. Splitting patterns reported here are: s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (double-of-doublet), t (triplet), p (pentet), and m (multiplet). Chemical shifts (δ) and coupling constants (J) are reported in ppm and Hertz (Hz), respectively.

TiO2 electrode preparation
A double-layer TiO2 photoelectrode (10 + 5 μm in thickness) with a 10 μm thick nanoporous layer and a 5 μm thick scattering layer (area: 0.25 cm2) was prepared using a previously reported method.35 Fluorine doped tin oxide-coated glass electrodes (Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) with a sheet resistance of 8–10 ohm−2 and an optical transmission of greater than 80% in the visible range were screen printed using anatase TiO2 colloids (particle size ∼ 13 nm) obtained from commercial sources (Ti-Nanoxide D/SP, Solaronix). Nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films were deposited onto the conducting glass by screen-printing which was then sintered at 500 °C for 1 hour. The film thickness was measured with a Surfcom 1400A surface profiler (Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd). The electrodes were impregnated with a 0.05 M titanium tetrachloride solution and sintered at 500 °C. The films were further treated with 0.1 M HCl aqueous solutions before examination.36 The dye solutions (2 × 10−4 M) were prepared in 1:1:1 acetonitrile, tert-butyl alcohol and DMSO. Deoxycholic acid was added to the dye solution as a coadsorbent at a concentration of 20 mM. The electrodes were immersed in the dye solutions and then kept at 25 °C for 20 hours to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 surface.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
Photovoltaic and IPCE measurements were made on sandwich cells, which were prepared using TiO2 coated working electrodes and platinum coated counter electrodes, and were sealed using a 40 μm Syrlyn spacer through heating of the polymer frame. The redox electrolyte consisted of a solution of 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.3–0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photovoltaic measurements of sealed cells were made by illuminating the cell through the conducting glass from the anode side with a solar simulator (WXS-155S-10) at AM 1.5 illumination (light intensities: 100 mW cm−2).
Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) conversion
IPCE measurements were made on a CEP-2000 system (Bunkoh-Keiki Co. Ltd). IPCE at each wavelength was calculated using eqn (1), where ISC is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2) under monochromatic irradiation, q is the elementary charge, λ is the wavelength of incident radiation in nm and P0 is the incident radiative flux in Wm−2.37 (1)
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency was plotted as a function of wavelength.
Photoemission yield spectrometer (AC3) and E0–0 measurements
The experimental HOMO and E0–0 energy values for NCSU-10, NCSU-10′, and N719 were measured using a photoemission yield spectrometer and the experimental absorption/emission spectra point of overlap, respectively, and the procedure was described in detail elsewhere.38 Fig. S13–S15† show the HOMO energies of NCSU-10, NCSU-10′, and N719, respectively. E0–0 energies were calculated from the point of intersection of the absorption and emission spectra.

Synthesis of the antenna ligand: 4,4′-bis((E)-2-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)vinyl)-2,2′-bipyridine. 
The antenna ligand was synthesized in a reactor containing 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (2 g, 0.0108 mol), 9-ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde (4.86 g, 0.0217 mol), 0.065 mol of trimethylchlorosilane, and a magnetic stirrer bar in 70 ml DMF. The reaction temperature was raised to 100 °C and allowed to run for 48 hours with continuous stirring. During the course of the reaction, the color of the reaction mixture changed to yellow and turned to orange on cooling. At the end of the reaction, the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator, and the orange product was recovered by addition of water and filtration under vacuum to furnish the antenna ligand in 81% yield, which was used for the next step after washing with toluene.


Reaction of the antenna ligand with 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid and dichloro-(p-cymene)-ruthenium(II) dimer to furnish NCSU-10, modified from the Grätzel method. 
The synthesis of NCSU-10 was carried out in a one-pot three-step reaction. The reactions were carried out in a 250 ml reaction flask equipped with a condenser and magnetic stirrer bar under argon. The flask was charged with anhydrous DMF, dichloro-(p-cymene)-ruthenium(II) dimer (0.2 g, 3.265 × 10−4 mol) and 4,4′-bis((E)-2-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl) vinyl-2,2′-bipyridine) (0.388 g, 6.53 × 10−4 mol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 3 h. Then, 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxalic acid was added (0.159 g, 6.53 × 10−4 mol) and the temperature was raised to 130 °C and allowed to run for 11 hours. After 11 hours, excess of NH4NCS (0.5 g) was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction mixture was allowed to run for extra 5 h at 130 °C. The last two steps of the reaction were monitored for completion by taking aliquots from the reaction mixture every 60 minutes and measuring its absorption spectrum until there was no increase in the absorbance of the MLCT peaks with respect to the π–π* peak. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and DMF was removed using a rotary evaporator. Water was added to the flask and the insoluble solid was vacuum filtered and washed with de-ionized water and ether. The product was dried overnight to give a yield of 80%.


NCSU-10′

The same synthetic procedure used for NCSU-10 was adopted for NCSU-10′, using 2,2′-bipyridyl-5,5′-dicarboxalic acid instead of 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxalic acid. The same purification procedure used for NCSU-10 was also used for NCSU-10′. Fig. S16† shows a schematic representation elucidating the synthesis of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′.
Purification

NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ were purified in a column using Sephadex LH-20 as the stationary phase and methanol as the mobile phase. The crude dye was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and TBAOH and loaded on Sephadex LH-20, and the compound was eluted using neat methanol. The main band was collected and acidified using 0.1 M HCl until the pH dropped to 2.0, and the acidified solution was kept in a refrigerator for 48 hours. Then, the precipitate was filtered, washed with plenty of de-ionized water to remove the remaining HCl. The same purification procedure was repeated three times in order to obtain NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ in the pure form.
Molecular modeling
Equilibrium molecular geometries of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ were calculated using pure density functional theory (DFT) utilizing the energy functional Becke exchange plus One-parameter Progressive correlation (BOP) and the double zeta plus polarization function basis set (DNP), implemented in DMOl3.39–41 The geometry optimization calculations were followed by energy calculations using TD-DFT utilizing the energy functional Becke 3-Parameter (Exchange), Lee, Yang and Parr (B3LYP) and the full-electron basis set density Gauss double-zeta with polarization functions (DGDZVP). The solvent (DMF) effect was accounted for by using the polarizable conductor calculation model (PCM), implemented in Gaussian 09, and the ground and excited states oxidation potentials were calculated. All DFT and TD-DFT jobs were submitted remotely at the East Carolina University's Supercomputer Jasta.
3. Results and discussion
UV-Visible absorption and emission spectra
The absorption and emission spectra measured in DMF (2 × 10−5 mol) of complexes NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ along with N-719 are shown in Fig. 2, and their spectrophotophysical properties are summarized in Table 1. They all show intense UV absorption bands between 304 and 310 nm, which are assigned to the intraligand π–π* transition of the bipyridine ligand,28 an intense and broad band at ∼400 nm, which is a mixture of ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) and metal-to-ligand charge transfers (MLCT), and a broad peak at 545–555 nm corresponding to the lower energy MLCT. The molar extinction coefficients of the lower energy MLCT peaks of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ are 20650 and 15200 M−1 cm−1, respectively, compared to 14200 M−1 cm−1 of N719.28 The λmax of the lower energy MLCT peak of NCSU-10 was observed at 545 nm, which is red-shifted by about 16 nm compared to that of N719, confirming a narrower HOMO–LUMO gap than N719, and hence a better photon harvesting dye. In the case of NCSU-10′, the lower energy MLCT band was at 555 nm, slightly red shifted compared to NCSU-10. Moreover, the photons absorption at high and low energy photons were significantly greater in the case of NCSU-10 than that of N719, due to the presence of carbazole (antenna), a strong electron donor. The enhanced red absorption of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ complexes renders them attractive candidates as panchromatic charge transfer sensitizers for DSSCs.

The emission spectra of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ in DMF shown in Fig. 2 indicated that the concentration of the excited state is in the order of NCSU-10 > N719 > NCSU-10′, which is consistent with the corresponding photocurrent responses of these dyes.
The absorption spectra of NCSU-10, NCSU-10′, and N719 adsorbed on TiO2 thin film are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† The absorption spectrum of NCSU-10 on the TiO2 electrode is broader and slightly red-shifted compared to the one in solution. This energy shift can be attributed to a perturbation in the energy levels of the ground and excited states of the dye in the solid state compared to that in solution, resulting from the interaction between the dye and the electrode. This broadening of the absorption spectrum is desirable for harvesting more photons across a wider range of the solar spectrum, which leads to a large photocurrent. On the other hand, the absorption spectra of NCSU-10′ and N719 on TiO2 are significantly weaker than that of NCSU-10.

Table 1 shows a summary of the E0–0, absorption and emission properties of NCSU-10, NCSU-10′, and N719. The E0–0 was calculated from the point of intersection of the experimental absorption and emission spectra of the sensitizers, and it was shown that the E0–0 of NCSU-10′ < NCSU-10 < N719, which confirms that NCSU-10′ was the most red shifted dye. The emission decay was measured using time-correlated single photon counting, and the smooth lines of the emission decay (Fig. S2, ESI†) were produced using the 4th exponential decay fitting of the instrumental response. The lowest-excited state lifetime of NCSU-10, NCSU-10′, and N-719 in DMF was 168, 10, and 78 ns, respectively.
Electrochemical data
The ionization potential (IP) of NCSU-10, NCSU-10′ and N719 bound to nanocrystalline TiO2 film was measured using a photoemission yield spectrometer (Riken Keiki AC-3E), and the data are given in Table 2. Typical photoemission yield spectra for complexes NCSU-10, NCSU-10′ and N719 on TiO2 are shown in the ESI (Fig. S13–S15†). The ionization potential values of −5.50 eV and −5.43 eV were obtained for sensitizers NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, respectively. The energy difference between the Ru3+/2+ potential (IP) of sensitizers NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ and the I3−/I− redox couple (−5.20 eV) 42 is large enough for efficient regeneration of the dye through reaction with iodide. The excited-state oxidation potential, E* (Ru3+/2+), is a measure of the loss of the electron that is placed in the π* (bipyridine) upon excitation. For complexes NCSU-10, NCSU-10′ and N719, E* (Ru3+/2+) values were estimated using eqn (2), where E (Ru3+/2+) is the oxidation potential of the ground state and E0–0 is the energy difference between the lowest excited and ground states. The resulting E* (Ru3+/2+) values are shown in Table 2. The excited-state oxidation potentials of sensitizers NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ were found to be exactly the same at −3.57 eV, which lies above the experimental CB edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 (−4.2 eV).43

It was also clear that the excited state oxidation potential of NCSU-10 is less negative than that of N719, which indicates that the negative free energy change of electron injection (−ΔGinj) is greater in the case of NCSU-10, and, hence, more photocurrent is produced in the cell, which was confirmed from the JSC of NCSU-10-TBA (Table 3). Therefore, efficient excited-state electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 was expected to occur with both NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′. However, the short-circuit photocurrent density was much greater in the case of NCSU-10 (18.01 mA cm−2) than that of NCSU-10′ (5.62 mA cm−2). Moreover, the Ru3+/2+ potential (IP) of sensitizer NCSU-10′ of −5.43 eV confirmed that dye regeneration is thermodynamically efficient. These findings confirmed that there are other factors, other than the thermodynamics parameters, that precluded efficient electron injection in NCSU-10′. E* (Ru3+/2+) = E (Ru3+/2+) − E0–0(2)

TD-DFT calculations

Table 2 and Fig. 3 show results from calculations involving the calculated Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), and the lowest singlet–singlet electronic transitions for NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ compared to TiO2. The calculated HOMO–LUMO energy gaps were consistent with the experimental trend of the red shift of NCSU-10′ > NCSU-10 > N719 (Table 2).

GSOP = ground state oxidation potential = EHOMO; ESOP = excited state oxidation potential; ESOPsinglet = EHOMO − E0–0; E0–0 = (S0–S1) = the lowest vertical excitation energy = the lowest singlet–singlet transition. 
Results of MO calculations showed that in both NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, the HOMO isosurface (Fig. 4) was delocalized not only on Ru and NCS but also on the carbazole moiety with a large coefficient, an observation that has not been reported for Ru(II)-based polypyridyl complexes with a stilbazole-based antenna. These findings demonstrated that the attachment of a carbazole moiety to a bipyridyl through CHCH without an electron-donor spacer forms a stilbazole linkage with a unique electron donor system that significantly influences the delocalization of the frontier HOMO and enhances the electron injection at the interface of TiO2, suggesting a second charge transfer from the carbazole to the electron acceptor ligand, which is evident from the significantly higher molar extinction coefficient of the high energy MLCT peak (401 nm) and superior JSC of NCSU-10 compared to N719 (Table 3). The calculated LUMO isosurfaces for NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ were delocalized on the acceptor bipyridyl ligand, carrying the anchoring groups (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Calculated isosurfaces of the HOMO and LUMO for NCSU-10 (top) and NCSU-10′ (bottom). 
From TD-DFT calculations, it was clear that both NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ were thermodynamically favorable for electron injection as their ESOP, −3.49 and −3.71 eV, respectively, are positively shifted compared to that of the calculated conduction band edge of TiO2 (−4.04 eV). Moreover, both TD-DFT calculations and ionization potential (IP) measurements confirmed that NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ are strong photoreductants as their GSOP are thermodynamically driven for electron replenishment. Also, dye uptake values were measured for NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ and were found to be comparable (5.1 × 10−5 for NCSU-10versus 4.4 × 10−5 mmol mg−1 for NCSU-10′), which confirmed that there was no steric effect hindering the anchoring of NCSU-10′ to TiO2.
To unravel the underlying reasons responsible of the inferior quantum yield of electron injection and lower short-circuit photocurrent density in the 5,5′-isomer (NCSU-10′), Mülliken population analysis (Fig. 5) was performed, which showed that the calculated partial atomic charges of the carbons at 4,4′- and 5,5′- of the bipyridyl, to which the anchoring groups are attached, in NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, are 0.156 and 0.11, respectively. This demonstrated that the 4,4′-isomer (NCSU-10) is 32% stronger as an electron acceptor than the 5,5′-isomer (NCSU-10′), which confirmed that the electronic coupling of dπ–π* and π–π* is much greater in NCSU-10 than in NCSU-10′. These new findings explained the superior and inferior photocurrent density of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, respectively. Hence, NCSU-10′ is an example of a dye that has its ESOP and GSOP thermodynamically favorable, and the kinetics of its ESOP is also favorable, yet it has poor electron injection.

ATR-FTIR spectral data
ATR-FIR spectra for NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ exhibited strong absorption peaks at 2101 and 2104 cm−1, respectively, corresponding to the isothiocyanate (N-bonded isomer) group. The spectra also showed strong absorption peaks at 1722 and 1723 cm−1 corresponding to the carbonyl of COOH in NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, respectively, and broad peaks at 3437 cm−1, corresponding to the OH of COOH.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performance of complexes NCSU-10, NCSU-10′, and N719 on a nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was studied under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), using an electrolyte with a composition of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile. Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent action spectra for the cells with complexes NCSU-10, NCSU-10′ and N719 where the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values are plotted as a function of wavelength. NCSU-10-TBA achieved efficient sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 over the whole visible range, extending into the near IR region (ca. 870 nm), and showed an IPCE value of about 90% in the plateau region. The area under the IPCE peak for NCSU-10-TBA was found to be 11% greater than that of N719, due to the better electron injection of NCSU-10 compared to N719. Moreover, the IPCE of NCSU-10 does not exhibit the sharp drop that the N719 has at 380 nm (Fig. 6), due to the greater molar extinction coefficient for NCSU-10 compared to that of N719 in this region (350 to 450 nm). Taking into account the reflection and absorption losses by the conducting glass, the efficiency of electric current generation in this range reaches about 100% over a broad wavelength range extending from 450 to 650 nm.
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent action spectra (IPCE) obtained with complexes NCSU-10, NCSU-10′, and N719 anchored on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film. 
The short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factors (FF) and overall cell efficiencies (η) for each dye-TiO2 electrode are summarized in Table 3. Under the same experimental device conditions with mask, NCSU-10 showed a 14.6% higher efficiency than N719. The superior performance of NCSU-10-TBA was attributed to the superior light harvesting efficiency of high and low energy photons.

Fig. 7 shows photocurrent–voltage curves of sandwich-type sealed solar cells based on NCSU-10-TBA, NCSU-10′ and N719 at standard AM 1.5 irradiation using an electrolyte of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile. NCSU-10-TBA refers to one COOH of NCSU-10 in the salt form with TBA (COO−TBA+). As shown in Table 3, the solar cell sensitized with NCSU-10-TBA showed a photocurrent density of 18.01 mA cm−2, an open circuit potential of 0.722 V, and a fill factor of 0.72, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 9.37% with the electrolyte containing 0.5 M TBP under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), which outperforms N719 (η = 8.17%) by 14.6%. Thus, this class of carbazole-substituted polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes serves as a basis for the molecular design of more efficient sensitizers, by enhancing the molar extinction coefficient of the high and low energy photons, increasing the light harvesting efficiency in the IR region, and, hence, increasing the short-circuit photocurrent density.

4. Conclusions
A combination of spectrophotometric, electrochemical, and device response parameters of NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′ showed clearly that the anchoring group isomerization, 4,4′- vs. 5,5′-, played a key role in the short-circuit photocurrent density and total conversion efficiency of polypyridyl Ru(II) based sensitizers for DSSCs. Furthermore, TD-DFT calculations supported by photoelectrochemical measurements confirmed that both the oxidation potential of the ground and excited states, for both NCSU-10 and NCSU-10′, are thermodynamically favorable for electron injection because of the negative free energy change (−ΔGinj) for electron injection and hole replenishment, yet the photocurrent density of NCSU-10′ was significantly lower compared to that of NCSU-10 because of its inferior ability as an electron acceptor at the locations of the anchoring group. Under the same experimental device conditions, which are the optimized conditions of N719, the NCSU-10-TBA sensitized solar cell showed a higher power conversion efficiency than N719, with JSC of 18.01 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.722 V, and FF of 0.72, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 9.37% compared to 8.17% of N719. The superior photocurrent density of NCSU-10 was attributed to the delocalization of the HOMO on carbazole, which generated a strong second charge transfer (LLCT) as indicated by TD-DFT. The molar absorptivity of NCSU-10 for π–π*, low and high energy MLCT peaks was much greater than that of N719.
