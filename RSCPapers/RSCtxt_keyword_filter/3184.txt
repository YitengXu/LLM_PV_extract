    , Accepted 27th February 2023First published on 27th February 2023AbstractSnO2-based planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as potential photovoltaic candidates due to their simple structures and cost-effective preparation processes. However, the extensive defects accumulated at the buried interface between perovskite and SnO2 greatly hinder the further improvement of PSC efficiency and stability. Herein, the potassium salt of anthraquinone-1,8-disulfonate (ASPS) is used as a novel multifunctional interfacial modifier to improve the carrier transport performance at the buried interface and optimize the quality of the upper perovskite light absorber layer (PVK) in PSCs. Owing to the synergistic effect of sulfonic acid groups, carbonyl groups and potassium ions in ASPS, the accumulated defects at the buried interface are passivated, the energy level arrangement of the interface is optimized, and the crystalline quality and optoelectronic properties of the PVK films are improved. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improved significantly from 21.36% for the controlled device to 23.96% for the ASPS-modified device. Furthermore, the unencapsulated ASPS-modified device also exhibited better storage stability and thermal stability than the controlled device.
1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide hybrid perovskite materials are making a splash in the field of optoelectronic devices with their unique and excellent optoelectronic properties as well as low-cost preparation process.1–6 Since Miyasaka first applied perovskite as a light absorber layer to photovoltaic devices in 2009 and achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.9%,7 perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable results in terms of efficiency, stability, and scalability over the last decade.8–10 At present, the highest certified efficiency of PSCs has reached 25.7%,11 which is comparable to that of silicon-based solar cells. Despite the remarkable achievements of PSCs on the road to practicality, the defect density in the core functional layer of perovskite light-absorbing films and the numerous defects accumulated at the contact interface between the functional layers of the device have become bottlenecks that limit their further development.12–14
For cost-effective SnO2-based planar PSCs in the n–i–p configuration, the buried interface between the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite light absorber layer (PVK) is more critical than the perovskite itself and the interface between the other functional layers.15,16 Concretely, the defect concentration accumulated at the buried interface between the ETL and the upper PVK is not only much higher than that at the interface between the PVK and the hole transport layer (HTL),17 but also about 100 times higher than that in the PVK film.18 These defects accumulate at the buried interface as non-radiative recombination sites, which not only lead to poor charge transfer and additional energy loss,19,20 but also affect the energy level alignment at the interface and thus result in severe open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss and hysteresis.21–23 Moreover, the presence of hydroxyl groups (OH−) on the surface of SnO2 prepared by simple solution methods can also seriously jeopardize the stability of the relevant PSC devices.9 On the other hand, as an important contact interface associated with the crystallization and growth process of perovskite precursors, the surface wettability of the bottom ETL film will directly affect the morphology and crystalline quality of the upper PVK film.24–26
To date, various organic molecules and inorganic metal salts have been developed to eliminate or minimize the adverse effects of interfacial non-radiative recombination losses on device photovoltaic performance.19 For instance, alkali metal potassium salts such as KCl,27 KI,28 and KOH29 have been demonstrated to be effective interfacial modifiers to eliminate hysteresis and ion migration, while K+ ions have also been confirmed to spontaneously diffuse into the upper PVK layer to enhance the crystalline quality and optoelectronic properties of the film.30 In addition, organic molecules with strong electronegative functional groups such as sulfonic acid groups (–SO32−),31,32 carbonyl groups (–CO),33 hydroxyl groups (–COO−),31,34etc. have also been used to modulate the energy level of the SnO2 ETL and suppress surface trap states due to their tendency to coordinate with undercoordinated Sn4+ or Pb2+ ions. However, the use of synergistic effects between these functional groups as multifunctional buried interfacial modifiers to further improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs is still uncommon.
Herein, we demonstrate that a desirable potassium salt of anthraquinone-1,8-disulfonate (ASPS) can be used as an effective multifunctional buried interfacial modifier to improve the efficiency and stability of SnO2-based planar PSCs. A series of systematic characterization analyses show that the synergistic effect of the electronegative functional groups and K+ ions in the ASPS structure can not only optimize the energy level arrangement at the buried interface to enhance the carrier extraction efficiency, but also effectively reduce the defect states on the SnO2 surface to suppress the non-radiative recombination. In addition, the crystal quality and optoelectronic properties of the upper PVK films were also significantly improved due to the improved smoothness and wettability of the ASPS-modified SnO2 surface. As a result, the champion PCE of the optimized PSC based on the ASPS-modified SnO2 ETL increased significantly from the initial 21.36% to 23.96%. Furthermore, the unencapsulated optimized devices still maintain more than 90% and 85% of their initial efficiency values after 1500 hours of storage at room temperature and 900 hours of continuous heating at 80 °C, respectively. Our results confirm the feasibility of optimizing the buried interface properties with a facile interfacial modification strategy to further enhance the PSC performance.
2 Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
Chemicals and reagents: methylammonium chloride (MACl), formamidinium iodide (FAI), and lead iodide (PbI2) were purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd. LiTFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. The potassium salt of anthraquinone-1,8-disulfonate (ASPS) was purchased from TCI. Commercial tin(IV) oxide solution (SnO2, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All salts and solvents were used as received without any further purification.
2.2 Perovskite solar cell fabrication
FTO substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol sequentially by ultrasonication for 30 min, followed by UV/O3 light irradiation for 60 min. Then, the SnO2 electron transport layer was prepared by spin-coating a SnO2 nanocrystal solution (diluted to 2.5% with H2O) on an FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s and followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. Then, an aqueous solution of ASPS was spin-coated on the SnO2 film at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 5 min in an ambient environment. The perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 0.221 g FAI, 0.648 g PbI2, and 0.03 g MACl in DMF/DMSO mixed solution (8:1, v/v), and then spin-coating it on the substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. During the spin-coating, 200 μL ethyl acetate was dripped after spinning for 10 s. Subsequently, the perovskite film was annealed at 150 °C. The hole transporter, spiro-OMeTAD, was dissolved in chlorobenzene and LiTFSI and tert-butylpyridine (TBP) was used as the additive (0.167 g spiro-OMeTAD, 0.0298 g TBP, 0.0103 g in 1 mL chlorobenzene), and then the solution was deposited by spin-coating at 5500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm thick gold electrode was deposited on the top of the device by thermal evaporation under vacuum conditions through a shadow mask.
2.3 Measurement and characterization
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 Revision A.03 suite of programs, and geometry optimization was performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d) theoretical level. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films were recorded using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). FTIR spectra were measured using a Bruker Vertex 80v Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Both surface morphology and elemental compositions were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Quanta 250FEG) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and atomic force microscope (AFM; Brook Multimode 8). Absorption spectra of the prepared films were measured on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) was performed on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe III with He I source (21.22 eV) under an applied negative bias of 9.0 V. The PL spectra of the films were obtained at room temperature by using a steady-state lifetime spectrofluorometer (Varian Cary Eclipse). The time-resolved photoluminescence decay of the perovskite film was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog-3 Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system. The current–voltage characteristic curves of the fabricated PSCs were measured through a shadow mask with an area of 0.09 cm2 under standard AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-90L2, Wacom).
3 Results and discussion
In this experiment, we first prepared the initial SnO2 ETL via a liquid-phase spin-coating process, while the ASPS-modified SnO2 ETL was obtained by spin-coating an aqueous solution of ASPS on the SnO2 surface. Then, the PVK film was prepared on the ETL through a typical one-step deposition method. The passivation model of ASPS at the buried interface is shown in Fig. 1a. To better understand the passivation mechanism of ASPS, we calculated the electrostatic surface potential map and the corresponding frontier molecular orbitals of ASPS molecule by performing density functional theory (Fig. S1, ESI†). The electronegative groups such as –SO32− and –CO and electropositive K+ ions in ASPS are expected to be used to passivate various types of electron-poor and electron-rich defect states on the surfaces of SnO2 and PVK,35 respectively. For example, K+ ions can spontaneously diffuse into the upper PVK film to inhibit non-radiative recombination originating from boundary trap defects.30,36 Meanwhile, the –SO32− and –CO groups located at the ends of ASPS can reinforce the chemical bridging between the ETL and the upper PVK by chelating with uncoordinated Sn4+ and Pb2+ ions.37–39 On the other hand, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of ASPS are −5.80 eV and −2.22 eV, respectively. The HOMO of ASPS is much lower than that of the commonly used hole transfer material spiro-OMeTAD (−5.18 eV) and thus can effectively block hole contact with SnO2 ETL, while the LUMO is sufficient to drive electron transfer to SnO2.40

To investigate the effect of ASPS on the structure of SnO2 film, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the initial SnO2 and ASPS-modified SnO2 substrates are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). These two substrates both show similar structural phases (PDF card: 41-1445).41 Moreover, the XRD patterns of the ASPS-modified SnO2 substrates do not show any shifts or additional diffraction peaks compared with the initial SnO2, which indicates that the ASPS introduced in this experiment does not affect the lattice of the underlying SnO2. Then, electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) was carried out to probe whether there would be charge transfer between the introduced ASPS modifier and the underlying SnO2 ETL. The details of the EFM test are consistent with those in our previous report,42 and the corresponding schematic is shown in Fig. 1b. The corresponding atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of these EFM samples are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The phase shift mapping of the entire scanned region obtained under different biases is integrated in the same image to facilitate comparison, as shown in Fig. 1c. Fig. 1d shows the phase shift of each film and the corresponding polynomial fit results. In accordance with our previous study, the positive shift of the fitted parabolic symmetry axis indicates the positive charge induced in the surface region of the test sample.40,42 For the initial SnO2 sample, the symmetry axis is at a position close to 0 V, which indicates the presence of a extremely low carrier concentration on its surface. Whereas a small amount of positive charge was detected for the pure ASPS, the SnO2 sample modified using ASPS exhibited a significantly elevated positive charge concentration, which demonstrates the existence of charge transfer between ASPS and SnO2. In addition, the dark current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves of FTO/SnO2 or SnO2/ASPS/Au devices also indicate that the ASPS-modified SnO2 substrate has stronger electron transport capability and lower leakage current (Fig. 1e and f), and thus can effectively enhance the carrier transport efficiency.43 These improvements in electrical performance can be attributed to the increased positive polarization of the ASPS molecule due to the strong chemical coupling between ASPS and SnO2.44
Subsequently, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate in depth the interaction between ASPS and SnO2 to reveal the mechanism of its improved electrical properties. As shown in Fig. 2a, we can clearly observe that the peak of –CO and –SO in ASPS coated on the surface of the SnO2 film are shifted to lower wave numbers, which is not only evidence of the presence of ASPS on the SnO2 surface, but also indicates the strong chemical coordination between these electronegative functional groups in ASPS and SnO2.31,33 On the other hand, the appearance of K 2p and S 2p in the XPS of the ASPS-modified SnO2 film again confirmed the existence of ASPS on the surface of SnO2 film (Fig. S4, ESI†), which is also consistent with the element mapping results of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S5, ESI†). The shift of the Sn 3d peak of the ASPS-modified SnO2 film to higher binding energies compared to the initial SnO2 also indicates a strong interaction between ASPS and SnO2 (Fig. 2b).36 Moreover, the O 1s spectra in both SnO2 films can be deconvoluted into lattice oxygen (O2−) and chemisorbed hydroxyl groups (OH−).42 For the ASPS-modified SnO2 films, the ratio intensity of oxygen in hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface is significantly reduced, which indicates that the chemical environment of oxygen atoms in the SnO2 surface lattice has changed after the ASPS treatment.34,36 The reduced concentration of hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface can greatly depress the surface defect states and suppress non-radiative recombination, thus improving the carrier transport properties at the buried interface.45

To further explore the influence of ASPS treatment on the energy level arrangement of SnO2 film, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out, as shown in Fig. 2d and e. Combined with our previous reports,46 we obtained the schematic diagram of the energy level arrangement structure including SnO2, SnO2/ASPS, PVK and spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 2f). Compared with the initial SnO2 ETL, the increased energy shift between the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the ASPS-modified SnO2 and the CBM of the upper PVK layer is more favorable to promote carrier transport at the buried interface. Although the surface chemical state and optoelectronic properties of the ASPS-modified SnO2 film were significantly changed compared to the initial SnO2, the inherent absorption spectrum (Fig. S6, ESI†) and high transmittance of incident light of the SnO2 film were not adversely affected by the ASPS treatment (Fig. 1g).
As is well known, the buried interface in the n–i–p PSC device also plays a crucial role in the crystallization and growth of the upper PVK films. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PVK films deposited on the different SnO2 substrates show that the optimized PVK film prepared on the ASPS-modified SnO2 substrate exhibit larger grain sizes and more uniform and dense grain distribution compared with the controlled PVK film deposited on the initial SnO2 substrate, as shown in Fig. 3a. According to the classical nucleation theory, the smaller contact angle between the precursor and the contact interface during the film formation is conducive to reducing the Gibbs free energy of heterogeneous nucleation, which is helpful to promote the nucleation and increase the grain size in the final film.24,26 Compared with the pure FTO and initial SnO2 substrates, the contact angle of perovskite precursor on the ASPS-modified SnO2 substrate is the smallest (Fig. 3b). Thus, the PVK films prepared on the ASPS-modified SnO2 substrate are of high-quality containing grains with a large size. Fig. 3c–e further show the UV-visible absorption patterns and the corresponding XRD diffraction patterns of the PVK films. Compared with the controlled PVK film, the intensity of both absorption and XRD diffraction peaks of PVK films deposited on the ASPS-modified SnO2 substrate are slightly increased, which also proves that the introduction of ASPS is more beneficial to improve the crystalline quality of the upper perovskite film. Further comparison of XRD patterns revealed that the positions of the diffraction peaks associated with perovskite in the optimized PVK films were shifted towards higher angles compared to the control films (Fig. S7, ESI†). It should be noted that ASPS is almost insoluble in DMSO or DMF, so the shift of the peak position in the XRD pattern can be attributed to the change in lattice constant caused by the spontaneous diffusion of K+ ions from the introduced ASPS at the buried interface to the upper perovskite structure,30 as confirmed by the K 2p XPS spectra detected in the optimized PVK films (Fig. 3f) and the element scanning results (Fig. S8, ESI†) of the SnO2/ASPS/PV cross-section. In addition, the liquid-phase NMR results in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and the FTIR results in Fig. S10 (ESI†) both confirm the strong coupling between ASPS and Pb2+ ions, thus contributing to the inhibition of metal Pb0 formation in the PVK structure (Fig. 3g), which effectively reduces the non-radiative recombination loss.47,48

In order to further analyze the effect of ASPS on the carrier transport properties at the buried interface, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence decay (TRPL) measurements were employed. For the non-conductive glass substrates, the introduction of ASPS facilitates the enhancement of the PL intensity of PVK deposited on its surface (Fig. S11, ESI†). In contrast, for conductive SnO2 substrates, the PL intensity of the optimized PVK is weaker than that of the controlled PVK films (Fig. 3c), indicating that ASPS causes perovskite to have more effective PL quenching than pure SnO2. Moreover, the average carrier lifetimes (τave) for PVK films deposited on SnO2 and SnO2/ASPS substrates are calculated to be 8.53 and 16.71 ns, respectively. The increased decay lifetimes indicate that the optimized PVK films have fewer defects and thus can effectively suppress carrier recombination.49 In addition, further combined with the results of space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements (Fig. 4b) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests (Fig. 4c), the introduction of ASPS greatly contributes to the reduction of the defect density in the upper PVK films, thus effectively suppressing the non-radiative recombination associated with internal defects.50

(e) I–V curves of the best-performing control and ASPS-optimized devices. (f) Steady-state output PCE at MPP of champion devices. 
Based on the above analysis results, the introduction of ASPS is not only conducive to regulating the energy level arrangement on the surface of the SnO2 ETL and passivating the defects at the buried interface to inhibit non-radiative recombination, but also can affect the crystallization process of the upper perovskite to improve the morphology and photoelectric properties of PVK films. Then, in order to demonstrate more directly the contribution of the multifunctional buried interfacial modifier ASPS introduced in this experiment to the PSC photovoltaic performance, we fabricated planar cell devices with the typical n–i–p configuration of FTO/ETL/PVK/HTL/Au. Fig. 4d shows the I–V characteristic curve of the champion device treated with ASPS of different concentrations under reverse scanning (RS), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). When the concentration of the used ASPS was 0.75 mg mL−1, the corresponding PSC device achieved the highest efficiency of 23.96% with a VOC of 1.17 V, JSC of 24.76 mA cm−2, and FF of 82.70%, which is significantly higher than the controlled device with a PCE of 21.36% (VOC = 1.10 V, JSC = 24.47 mA cm−2, and FF = 79.37%). To further emphasize the positive contributions of the synergistic effects among the functional groups in ASPS to the performance improvement of PSC, we also used other organic compounds with the same main structure as ASPS except for the functional groups, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). By comparing the photovoltaic parameters of these cells it can be found that the enhanced photovoltaic performance of the ASPS-modified PSCs is mainly due to the synergistic effect of the various functional groups in the structure, resulting in improved PVK film quality, enhanced interfacial carrier transport and extraction efficiency, and effective suppression of non-radiative recombination losses. Moreover, the optimized PSC also showed ameliorated photocurrent hysteresis under forward and reverse scanning (Fig. 4e). The steady-state output PCE at the maximum power point (MPP) for the controlled and the optimized PSCs was 21.15% and 23.79%, respectively (Fig. 4f). In addition, the optimized PSC also showed good reproducibility (Fig. S12, ESI†).
In addition to PV efficiency, stability is also the key factor affect the commercialization of PSCs. To further evaluate the effect of ASPS on PSC stability, storage stability was first tested by storing unencapsulated devices in a dark air environment at room temperature and 20–30% relative humidity. As shown in Fig. 5a, the device optimized by ASPS can still maintain the initial efficiency of 91.7% after 1500 hours of storage, while the controlled device only retains the initial efficiency of 72.3%. This shows that the improved device has good environmental stability. Moreover, the evolution of the efficiency of different devices under continuous heating at 80 °C was studied to gain insight into thermal stability, as shown in Fig. 5b. It is worth noting that poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-amine] (PTAA) with higher thermal stability was used instead of spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer in the thermal stability aging experiments due to the inherent instability of spiro-OMeTAD in a continuous heating environment.51,52 Meanwhile, both devices were also exposed to standard AM 1.5 sunlight for light soaking tests (Fig. 5c). And the ASPS-optimized PSC shows better stability in both thermal aging and light soaking compared to the controlled device that may be attributed to the passivation of buried interface defects by ASPS and the improvement of the crystalline quality of the upper PVK film.53

4 Conclusions
In summary, this work demonstrated a simple and effective method to further improve the efficiency and stability of planar PSCs by introducing a multifunctional surface modifier (ASPS) into the buried interface. It was found that the introduction of ASPS can not only greatly reduce the concentration of harmful hydroxyl groups on the surface of SnO2, passivate the interfacial defect states and suppress non-radiative recombination, but also optimize the energy level arrangement at the buried interface to improve the carrier extraction efficiency. Meanwhile, the improved surface of the SnO2 substrate after ASPS modification and the spontaneous diffusion of K+ ions into the perovskite lattice are favorable to the quality of the upper PVK film. These advantages ultimately enabled the ASPS-optimized PSC to achieve an impressive 23.96% PCE, as well as excellent storage stability and thermal stability.
