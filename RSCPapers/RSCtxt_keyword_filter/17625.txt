    , Accepted 20th August 2018First published on 21st August 2018AbstractHot solution deposition has emerged as a promising strategy to achieve high performance polymer solar cells and many state-of-the-art devices have been recently fabricated by this approach in research laboratories. Currently, a major challenge in the photovoltaics community is translating such methodologies into industrially relevant processes so that progress can be made beyond the research community. In this work, hot deposition is developed via a slot die coating process, using a thermally robust and thickness tolerant photovoltaic polymer and a 3D printer-based slot die coater. This method uses not only hot substrates but also hot solutions. We find that controlling solution and substrate temperatures is critical to achieve optimum morphology and high device performance. Analysis of nano-morphology and molecular packing shows a clear influence of both solution and substrate temperatures. At optimal temperature conditions (80 °C head−80 °C substrate), slot die coated devices with an inverted configuration exhibited up to a 7.61% power conversion efficiency without using additives or other processing treatments, which are detrimental to stability and processing efficiency. The optimum temperature combination was readily scaled up using roll-to-roll processing equipment without further optimization, yielding flexible polymer solar cells with a 7.06% power conversion efficiency, demonstrating the potential of the hot slot die coating method from an industrial perspective.

Broader context
Although the performance of polymer solar cells has reached more than a 14% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for single-junction polymer solar cells (PSCs) and a 17% PCE for tandem PSCs in laboratory-scale devices, there are significant concerns about efficiency losses during the translation to industrial-scale fabrication. Such losses arise from morphology changes, aggressive processing environments, intrinsic material instabilities and other environmental changes. In view of these active layer processing hurdles, materials suitable for industrial-scale device processing must exhibit performance which is insensitive to film thickness as well as strong air and thermal stability, in addition to high PCEs. Additionally, processing methodologies other than spin-coating, which are feasible to use in roll-to-roll processing, must be developed. In this article, we demonstrate a novel slot die coating method using a modified 3D printer which allows dual thermal treatment and the potential for flexible polymer solar cell fabrication with minimal PCE discrepancy. The use of the PPDT2FBT:PC71BM active layer blend is discussed with reference to the influence of processing temperature on nano-morphological changes and semi-crystallinity. By developing processing strategies like this and using suitable materials for commercialization, we can minimize performance losses during the transition to large scale manufacturing of flexible organic optoelectronic devices.

Introduction
Over the past few decades, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as a next generation energy source owing to their advantages such as flexibility, light weight and potential for high-throughput manufacturing with low cost.1,2 Recently, a number of approaches for PSC development have raised the record performance to over a 17.3% power conversion efficiency (PCE)3–12 in laboratory scale devices fabricated by spin coating.3–6 Improvements in performance through new organic materials design,7,9,13 morphology control14,15 and device engineering16,17 have yielded PCEs which are thought to be commercially competitive and large area devices have been demonstrated by roll-to-roll (R2R) processing.18–20 However, PCE losses arising from the low conductivity of the ITO electrode, difficulties in finding suitable photoactive and charge transport layer materials (which should be solution-processible) and BHJ morphological changes, etc. during the transition from laboratory processes to industrial scale manufacturing for module systems have been a major hurdle for the R2R-based mass production of PSCs.21–26 From this perspective, the key challenge to further progress towards commercialization is finding solutions to overcome the discrepancy between research cells and large-area R2R produced ones.
These discrepancies arise from intrinsic differences between lab-scale and industrial-scale processes and the demanding processing conditions required for R2R processing. For R2R-based mass production of PSCs, first, active materials need to be robust enough to keep performance under harsh drying environments. Although mild drying under inert atmospheres is technically possible, it makes PSCs much less commercially competitive. Secondly, it is challenging to produce defect-free, large area films by industrial processes when the target thickness of photoactive films is very thin. Therefore, materials should perform well using film thicknesses >200–300 nm while tolerating variations in film thickness. Thirdly, only relatively simple processing treatments are feasible in R2R processing. Although solvent additives27,28 and solvent vapor annealing29,30 are very effective techniques to modulate film morphology resulting in improved device performance in the lab, these post treatments are not practical in R2R processes. Therefore, scalable materials must be able to achieve optimal film morphologies using procedures which can be implemented on R2R equipment. Fourth, commercially viable devices must have good long-term and thermal stability. Research in this area has so far included approaches such as inverted device structures, encapsulation techniques and so on. Although many reports have shown that solvent additives improve the PCE by not only controlling nano- or/and mesoscale morphology,15 but also enhancement of molecular crystallinity,31 additive processing leads to deteriorated stability in PSCs.32 It has been demonstrated that the stability of PSCs processed with additives can be recovered somewhat using vacuum drying to completely remove additive residues,33 however, this step is incompatible with R2R processing. For these reasons, active solutions without additives of excessively high boiling points are desirable. Lastly, the development of scalable processing techniques such as doctor blade coating and slot die coating are necessary. Recently, using either hot casting or hot substrates for active film formation,34,35 enhanced device performance has been reported. Further, some groups have reported applying hot solution casting to the doctor blading process.36–38 Since the pre-metered slot die coating process typically works like the doctor blading method,39 slot die processes have the potential to utilize hot solution strategies by supplying fresh hot active ink. In this area, modified 3D printers for automated slot die coating have been introduced by Vak et al.22,40 3D printers allow accurate control of the x-, y-, z position of the head via digital coding with a personal computer, which allows convenient fabrication of PSCs with uniform film formation, patterning and high device reproducibility.
In this work, we successfully investigate not only the combination of thermal effects of the slot head (solution) and stage (substrate) by remodelling a 3D printer for efficient slot die processed PSCs, but also PSC fabrication in air using a suitable polymer having high environmental stability and a large thickness tolerance. Furthermore, we use a single solvent and inverted architecture to improve the stability of devices. Notably, we provide an in-depth analysis of the changes in morphology, molecular orientation and charge recombination of active films based on head and stage temperatures. Finally, optimal conditions identified using 3D printer-based devices are applied to R2R equipment with flexible substrates, which yield a high PSC performance of 7.06% – comparable in efficiency to the ITO glass-based devices processed with a 3D printer. This work demonstrates that the combination of solution and substrate thermal processing by hot slot-die coating may suggest a useful method to test the lab-to-fab scale-up for optimization of mass production of PSCs.
Results and discussion
Polymer solar cell fabrication and slot die coating
To improve the previously reported printing technique of 3D printer-based slot die coating, a 3D printer was modified to allow control of the temperature of the slot head as well as the sample stage by recoding the control software. This set up led to not only high qualitative reproducibility of PSCs but also accurate analysis of thermal effects of the heated head and substrate. PSCs were fabricated on ITO coated glass substrates in air using the dual thermal treatment process. PSCs were prepared with an inverted device configuration consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs)/poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid ester (PC71BM)/MoO3/Ag as shown in Fig. 1(a), wherein active materials were dissolved in only o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) without processing additives. Detailed fabrication methods are described in the Experimental section. PPDT2FBT (Mn = 40 KDa) has been reported to yield high PCEs of up to 9.4% using the spin coating method in an inert atmosphere with optimized formulation with a diphenyl ether (DPE) additive in the host solvent of chlorobenzene.13,41 Without processing additives, the PPDT2FBT PSC also shows a significantly high photovoltaic performance (PCE = 7.26%) with only thermal annealing at 130 °C using o-DCB as a solvent. These PSCs show outstanding thickness tolerance for performance,41 and thus PPDT2FBT was chosen as a suitable material for this study. Because of these superior merits of the polymer, we were able to focus on optimization of active films with respect to the temperature combination without significant influence of thickness on device performance.

Photovoltaic parameters by thermal treatments at fixed (d) head and (e) substrate temperatures of 80 °C. 
Using the 3D printer-based slot die coating method, inverted PSCs processed using a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and DPE additive showed a PCE of 7.4%, which was higher than that observed using a single solvent of o-DCB when devices were processed at a substrate temperature of 80 °C (see Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†), however, subsequent PSCs were fabricated using a single solvent (o-DCB) in order to focus on optimization of thermal processing conditions and avoid long-term stability issues associated with solvent additives (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Active layers were deposited using a controlled temperature matrix of solution (slot-head, H) and substrate (stage, S) temperatures in a range of 25 °C to 100 °C as shown in Fig. 1(b). The PCE variation and detailed photovoltaic parameters of all PSCs processed using various processing temperature combinations are shown in Fig. 1(c) and Table S2 (ESI†). With the increase of the substrate temperature up to 100 °C (using fixed head temperatures), PSCs showed a dramatic improvement in performance, from a 1.95–3.55% PCE using 25 °C substrates up to a 4.75–7.61% PCE for 80 °C substrates, stemming from significant increases in all photovoltaic parameters. Increasing the temperature of the slot head also had positive effects on the performance of PSCs, showing slightly improved open-circuit voltages (VOCs) and fill factors relative to heated substrates alone. Processing at over 100 °C deteriorated the performance with drastically decreased JSC values. Additionally, high temperatures rapidly dried the active solution before completely wetting the substrates, which led to the excessive crystallinity of the polymer and clumpy film formation including plastered and early drying materials.
To identify clear trends in photovoltaic parameters as a function of temperature combinations, the results using a fixed solution temperature of 80 °C or a fixed substrate temperature of 80 °C have been arranged in Fig. 1(d and e), clearly illustrating the results described above. Statistics for each parameter are reported with error bars in the ESI† (Fig. S3). Furthermore, data of four representative PSCs processed with temperature combinations (H25–S25, H25–S80, H80–S25, and H80–S80) are summarized in Table 1 for clear comparison and the corresponding EQE results are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). H and S in front of each number refer to slot head and substrate, respectively, while the number indicates the temperature (°C). The thicknesses of the four films were 280, 320, 140 and 250 nm for conditions of H25–S25, H25–S80, H80–S25 and H80–S80, respectively. Optimal PSC performance was observed at H80–S80 and showed a 7.61% PCE with a JSC of 14.80 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.78 V and FF of 0.66. The photovoltaic characteristics at H80–S80 with varying the active layer thickness (by controlling the coating speed) are also compared in Table S3 (ESI†). These results are even higher than the performance of PSCs processed by spin coating under an inert atmosphere. In addition, hot processing with 80 °C substrates significantly increased the shunt resistance (284.53–398.94 kΩ cm2) and decreased the series resistance (3.76–9.25 Ω cm2), leading to significant enhancements in VOC and FF (dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. S5, ESI†). Additionally, these increased VOCs with the increment of substrate temperature originate from reduced charge recombination and increased exciton dissociation in the donor/acceptor blend as well as the high crystallinity of the blend films with reduced defect density,42 which will be discussed in the following analysis section. These results indicate the optimization of a thermal matrix of head and substrate temperatures during film formation using a modified 3D printer-based slot die method has high potential for comparable PSC performance and constitutes a nice strategy for PSC fabrication.

Morphology and crystallinity analyses
Nanoscale, phase-separated morphologies in BHJ devices play a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance, since bi-continuous pathways for photo-generated charges lead to efficient charge dissociation and extraction. The morphologies and internal composite structure of four representative films (H25–S25, H25–S80, H80–S25, and H80–S80) were characterized using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) to investigate changes in surface and BHJ morphologies due to variations in the processing temperature. TEM images indicate that the brighter regions represent the PPDT2FBT polymer phase while darker areas represent the PC71BM phase (due to greater electron scattering by PC71BM). As shown in Fig. 2(a–d), the blend films processed at room temperature (H25–S25) exhibited a blurred composite phase. Although the interfacial area of PPDT2FBT and PC71BM may be large, this type of morphology results in impeded charge transport due to poorly formed domains in blend films. In the films fabricated with the hot slot die head (H80–S25), clearer PC71BM and PPDT2FBT phases were observed relative to the ones at H25–S25, since a hot slot head and PPDT2FBT:PC71BM ink not only increase the solubility of photoactive materials, but also lead to semi-crystalline film morphology during film formation.31 Interestingly, the use of a hot substrate clearly shows a brighter polymer phase in TEM images. Using a hot substrate (H25–S80) led to more aggregated PC71BM and PPDT2FBT phases and larger phase separation (compared to that at H80–S25).43 Notably, films processed using a hot head and hot substrate (H80–S80) showed a clearly discernible composite phase structure, as well as homogeneous fibril-like features in the polymer phase, resulting from the combination of the effects of hot ink and hot substrates as mentioned above. The fibril-like nanostructures lead to efficient charge transport pathways for charge extraction, which is the main reason for the significantly enhanced PSC performance with the largest shunt resistance among the four different temperature combinations.

Fig. 2(e–h) show the AFM surface morphologies of active thin films deposited under four representative conditions. The ambient temperature blend film (H25–S25) showed the highest surface roughness of 5.46 nm. Hot slot head and/or hot substrate processing both contributed to reduced surface roughness, showing surface roughnesses of 4.02, 5.21 and 3.68 nm for films H25–S80, H80–S25 and H80–S80, respectively. In addition, hot substrate processing loosened domain coarsening with smoother surface roughness. The film at H80–S80 showed a finely distributed bicontinuous morphology and the lowest RMS roughness, together with a small series resistance, providing additional evidence for performance enhancement in the corresponding devices.
Furthermore, to investigate changes in molecular packing and orientation in the films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out. Line-cuts are displayed in Fig. 2(i and j). A broad scattering at around 1.30 Å−1 in Fig. S6 (ESI†) corresponds to the PC71BM aggregates. The crystallographic parameters calculated from GIWAXS profiles are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The films processed on hot substrates exhibited pronounced lamellar diffractions up to (300) peaks in the out-of-plane (qz) direction, correlating to well-ordered PPDT2FBT polymer chains and a higher degree of crystallinity. The photovoltaic performance, blend film morphology and crystalline structures with fast drying and slow drying of wet films were compared by changing the cooling rate. More ordered polymer packing structures as well as increased crystallite size were observed with slow cooling procedures (see the results in Table S5 and Fig. S7–S9, ESI†). This result can be understood in terms of a pronounced thermal annealing effect by slow cooling. The high head temperature increases the solubility with well dissolved photoactive materials and the hot substrate treatment induces well-ordered polymers via the thermal annealing effect. Consequently, the processing using 80 °C for both the head and stage temperatures resulted in highly ordered molecular packing, resulting in efficient charge transport and performance enhancement.
Charge transport and recombination in PSCs
To further understand how differences in PSC performance depend on processing temperatures, the recombination kinetics and charge extraction probability were investigated by analysis of the light intensity-dependence of the J–V characteristics and the dependence of photocurrent (Jph) on effective voltage (Veff).44,45 Four devices were studied under a range of illumination from 10 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2 to identify the dominant recombination mechanisms in devices (see Fig. S10, ESI†). Fig. 3(a) shows a semi-logarithmic plot of VOCversus light intensity; the slope of the VOCversus light intensity plot provides information on the charge recombination. Devices processed with room temperature substrates showed a strong dependence of VOC on the light intensity with a slope of over 2kT/q, indicating that monomolecular Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination is predominant at the open-circuit condition due to incomplete phase separation and trap-based recombination. In contrast, processing using hot substrates significantly decreased the trap assisted recombination, evident as reduced slopes of 1.81kT/q (H25–S80) and 1.70kT/q (H80–S80), respectively.
 Fig. 3  (a) Light intensity dependence of VOC and (b) photocurrent versus effective voltage. 
Photocurrent (Jph = Jillumination − Jdark) is plotted as a function of effective voltage (Veff = V0 − Vapp, where, Vapp is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0) in Fig. 3(b). The charge collection/extraction probability was calculated using the ratio of photocurrent (Jph) and saturated photocurrent (Jsat) at the maximum power output condition (Veff = 0.2).46–48 The charge extraction probabilities at Veff = 0.2 were 51.1% (H25–S25), 79.2% (H25–S80), 58.3% (H80–S25) and 80.5% (H80–S80), respectively, which indicate that the H80–S80 processing reduced space charge build-up, with superior transport balance arising from minimized charge recombination. The trend of charge collection probability was consistent with the VOC dependence on light intensity, indicating that good phase separation by dual temperature controlling has significant effects on recombination kinetics and charge dynamics.
Flexible polymer solar cells processed using roll-to-roll equipment
In the final goal of this work, PSCs based on flexible ITO substrates were processed using the 3D printer modified slot die and a R2R system in an atmosphere of air. Except for the final electrodes, other layers including the ZnO NPs and PPDT2FBT:PC71BM blend layer were coated by the slot die and R2R method. R2R process conditions for each layer were set up following optimal conditions identified in PSCs fabricated by 3D printer-based slot die coating. H80–S80 conditions were used for PPDT2FBT:PC71BM processing, where the film passed over a hot plate after slot die coating of the ZnO NP layer as shown in Fig. 4(a). The best PSC performance based on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates and R2R slot die processing was a 7.06% PCE, with a JSC of 15.6 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.74 V and FF of 0.61 (the thickness of the film was around 500 nm), while the PSCs on rigid glass substrates using 3D printer processing showed a 7.61% PCE (a JSC of 14.8 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.78 V and FF of 0.66). The VOC and FF of R2R processed PSCs were decreased, due to lower shunt resistance which is typical for PET substrates and current leakage of the fragile ITO layer during processing.49 However, the JSC of R2R devices was still similar to the value of PSCs on ITO glass substrates. Fig. 4(b) shows J–V characteristics of the best performing PSCs on both PET and glass substrates. Both PSCs showed similar performance with PCEs over 7%, owing to the use of the same optimized processing conditions identified via the thermal matrix of slot head and substrate temperatures as well as the low sensitivity of device performance to thickness variations of PPDT2FBT.13,41 Furthermore, PSCs were fabricated on glass substrates via the slot die solution process except the anode (Ag). The ZnO NPs, PPDT2FBT:PC71BM blend and PEDOT:PSS layers were coated by the slot die method, resulting in a PCE of 4.94% with a JSC of 10.29 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.80 V and FF of 0.60 (Fig. S11 and Table S6, ESI†). All solution-processed PSCs are still a great challenge in this research field.26,50,51 Consequently, we successfully demonstrated that thermal matrix optimization of R2R processing via dual thermal treatments constitutes a practical methodology which allows a similar performance of flexible devices to ITO glass-based PSCs without supplementary treatments such as additives or post-thermal annealing.52–57

Conclusions
The highlight of this study is the first systematic study on the temperature combination of solution and substrate for film processing by remodeling a 3D printer-based slot die process. This methodology results in comparable PSC performance to devices prepared by the spin casting method. This slot die coating approach suggests a vital strategy for PSC fabrication to overcome the difficulties of lab-to-fab scale up when PSC materials are adapted to R2R equipment. Inverted geometry PSCs using a PPDT2FBT:PC71BM blend dissolved in o-DCB (without additives) were selected to overcome the current problems of PSCs such as stability, reproducibility and sensitivity to film thickness. We thoroughly investigated the morphologies, changes in molecular ordering of active films, charge recombination and the resulting photovoltaic properties as functions of processing temperatures of both slot head and substrate. Finally, roll to roll processing equipment with flexible substrates was used to fabricate PSCs at optimal conditions identified using 3D printer-based slot die processing. An optimal performance of a 7.06% PCE was achieved, which is comparable to the performance of spin-cast PSCs and 3D printer-based slot die coated PSCs on ITO covered glass. This work may suggest a simple and useful way to test the feasibility of lab-scale PSC devices for R2R-based mass production, including in-depth analysis of not only active material requirements such as thickness tolerance and air stability but also development of a new methodological approach based on temperature controllable slot die coating as a useful mid step in the lab-to-fab transition.
Experimental
Fabrication of inverted photovoltaic cells (the 3D printing slot die method and roll-to-roll process)
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with an inverted structure (ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag). For rigid substrate-based polymer solar cells, patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), then dried and treated with UV-ozone for 15 min to remove residues. Zinc oxide nanoparticles dissolved in methanol were deposited by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s onto the cleaned ITO substrates and dried for 10 min at 130 °C in air. Then, a mixed solution of PPDT2FBT:PC71BM in o-DCB was slot die-coated on top of the ZnO NP film in air using the 3D printer machine. The gap between the substrate and head was 100 μm. The optimal coating speed was 11 mm s−1 and the concentration of the PPDT2FBT:PC71BM blend solution was 14 mg ml−1. The volume of the slot die coating was 4 μl cm−2. For fabrication of devices using the roll-to-roll process, ITO patterned PET substrates (OC50: resistance 40–60 Ω sq−1, transmittance 80%) were used after cleaning by isopropyl alcohol. The ZnO solution was slot die coated at a 0.2 m min−1 coating speed (with a 10 μl min−1 volume) and thermally annealed at 130 °C. Then, the PPDT2FBT:PC71BM active layer was coated using variable head and substrate temperatures. The coating speed and volume for the active layer in the roll-to-roll process were 0.2 m min−1 and 50 μl min−1, respectively. The gap between the plastic substrate and head was 100 μm. To complete inverted PSC fabrication, a 10 nm MoO3 (∼0.5 Å s−1) layer and a 100 nm Ag (∼1.0 Å s−1) electrode were thermally evaporated at <1.0 × 10−6 Torr using a shadow mask. For deposition of solution-processable PEDOT:PSS materials on the active layer instead of the evaporated MoO3, blends of AI4083 (Heraeus CleviosTM P VP):IPA, PH(Heraeus CleviosTM P VP):IPA and neutral-PEDOT:PSS (Sigma-Aldrich):IPA were used. The active area of all PSCs was 10 mm2. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400-LV source measure unit under AM 1.5G solar irradiation.
Characterization
An Agilent 5500 scanning probe microscope (SPM) running with a Nanoscope V controller was used to obtain AFM images of polymer thin films. AFM images were recorded in high-resolution tapping mode under ambient conditions. Premium silicon cantilevers (TESP-V2) were used with a rotated tip to provide a more symmetric representation of features over 200 nm. Field emission-transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) (model: Tecnai G2 F20 X-Twin) was carried out using a 200 kV acceleration voltage. Samples for TEM were prepared on a Cu mesh grid. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted at the PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. X-rays coming from the in-vacuum undulator (IVU) were monochromated (wavelength λ = 1.10994 Å) using a double crystal monochromator and focused both horizontally and vertically (450 (H) × 60 (V) μm2 in FWHM @ the sample position) using K-B type mirrors. The GIWAXS sample stage was equipped with a 7-axis motorized stage for the fine alignment of the sample, and the incidence angle of the X-ray beam was set to be 0.12° to 0.14° for polymer films. GIWAXS patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector (Rayonix SX165) and the X-ray irradiation time was 6–9 s, dependent on the saturation level of the detector. Diffraction angles were calibrated using a sucrose standard (monoclinic, P21, a = 10.8631 Å, b = 8.7044 Å, c = 7.7624 Å, β = 102.938°) and the sample-to-detector distance was ∼231 mm.

Broader context
Although the performance of polymer solar cells has reached more than a 14% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for single-junction polymer solar cells (PSCs) and a 17% PCE for tandem PSCs in laboratory-scale devices, there are significant concerns about efficiency losses during the translation to industrial-scale fabrication. Such losses arise from morphology changes, aggressive processing environments, intrinsic material instabilities and other environmental changes. In view of these active layer processing hurdles, materials suitable for industrial-scale device processing must exhibit performance which is insensitive to film thickness as well as strong air and thermal stability, in addition to high PCEs. Additionally, processing methodologies other than spin-coating, which are feasible to use in roll-to-roll processing, must be developed. In this article, we demonstrate a novel slot die coating method using a modified 3D printer which allows dual thermal treatment and the potential for flexible polymer solar cell fabrication with minimal PCE discrepancy. The use of the PPDT2FBT:PC71BM active layer blend is discussed with reference to the influence of processing temperature on nano-morphological changes and semi-crystallinity. By developing processing strategies like this and using suitable materials for commercialization, we can minimize performance losses during the transition to large scale manufacturing of flexible organic optoelectronic devices.
