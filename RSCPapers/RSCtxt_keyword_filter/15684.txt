    , Accepted 11th June 2016First published on 14th June 2016AbstractWe report the encapsulation of low temperature carbon counter electrode based hole-conductor-free mesoscopic methylammonium lead iodide perovskite/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells with polydimethylsiloxane. The solar cells demonstrate improved photovoltaic performance, where we obtain an optimal short-circuit photocurrent JSC = 23.5 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage VOC = 0.97 V, and fill factor FF = 0.474, corresponding to a light to electric power conversion efficiency of 10.8% under a standard AM 1.5 solar light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity. The results exhibit a remarkable 54% enhancement over those without encapsulation. The cross-sectional SEM images indicate that the PDMS layer can condense the carbon electrode by filling the gaps in the mesoscopic carbon film during the solidification of PDMS, resulting in an improved MAPbI3/carbon interface condition. The photoluminescence and electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements prove that the improved efficiency is ascribed to a more efficient charge transfer process and slower charge recombination between interfaces. In addition, the robust polydimethylsiloxane isolates water in air, avoiding the degradation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and leading to an impressive stability during a testing period of 3000 h. Our work paves the way for realizing low cost, highly efficient and stable hybrid photovoltaic cells.
Introduction
Explorations on clean, inexpensive and renewable sources as alternatives to conventional fossil energy is an eternal theme, which provides a strategy for the energy crisis and global warming. The emerging photovoltaic technologies converting solar energy to electricity, such as organic cells,1–3 inorganic cells,4,5 quantum dot cells6 and dye-sensitized solar cells,7–12 have been prosperous for decades and are considered as one of the best approaches to meet the requirements. Organometal perovskites have the advantages of a wide absorption range,13 high extinction coefficient,14,15 and long electron–hole diffusion length,16 and are regarded as one of the most promising materials17 for solar energy conversion. Organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells using metal-halide perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) as light harvesters exhibit appealing features such as a high optical cross section,15 excellent ambipolar charge transport,18 small exciton binding energies,19–21 tunable band gaps,22–24 and low-cost fabrication. Importantly, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are solution-processible, which paves the way for future inexpensive large scale commercialization. Research into organometal perovskite solar cells has advanced by leaps and bounds, especially in the field of pursuing cost-effective high-efficiency solar power conversion.25 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has skyrocketed from initially being about 3.8% (ref. 26) when they were proposed for the first time in 2009 to 20.1%,27 showing the incredible momentum of development and potential value of application. No matter whether mesoscopic, planar, inverted designs or other kinds of PSC structures,28–31 the most common and successful ones can be expressed as TiO2/perovskite/hole-transporter-material (HTM)/Au. However, because of moisture-sensitive dopants Li[(CF3SO2)2N] (Li-TFSI) and tert-butylpyridine (tBP), the most commonly used HTM 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has proven to be non-stable in air, to say nothing about its long-term stability.32–35 To improve the cell stability, stable inorganic HTMs such as CuSCN36,37 were used to replace the spiro-OMeTAD and showed a PCE of 12.4%. Even more radical, a Au electrode was deposited on the perovskite without the spiro-OMeTAD interlayer and a PCE of 11.5% was achieved, proving that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite can act as both a light harvester and hole conductor at the same time.18,38,39 These HTM-free mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells have drawn increased interest due to having no requirements for high-cost HTMs and much simpler manufacturing processes.
Nevertheless, the solar cells still need thermally evaporated noble metal Au as the counter electrodes (CEs), which is highly energy consumptive and the process is complicated.40 Recently, carbon based HTM-free PSCs have been proven to be most promising, where both a noble metal electrode and HTMs are eliminated.41–44 Electrons are injected from the perovskite to TiO2 and finally collected by fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and holes are extracted from the perovskite to the carbon electrode directly. However, CH3NH3PbI3 materials will degrade and form PbI2 and CH3NH3I under humid conditions or high temperatures, which may hamper the application of PSCs.45 Cheng et al. reported degradation observations of CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs at high temperatures and humidity,46 demonstrating the necessity of a sealing process. They developed ‘partial’ and ‘complete’ encapsulation architectures to further prolong device lifetime.47 In order to inhibit the ingress of moisture and oxygen as well, PSCs encapsulated by UV-treated epoxy48 and polyurethane49 have also been reported. Nevertheless, detailed analysis on the encapsulation of PSCs is inadequate. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), benefiting from a low cost, ease of moulding, biocompatibility, chemical stability and transparency, has been widely used in fabrication and encapsulation processes for electronic devices.50–55 What's more, the excellent ductility of PDMS gives it potential in the extensive application of flexible electronics. Importantly, PDMS solution is water-free and does not harm perovskite layers, making it a perfect choice to package PSCs.
In this work, we prepare hole-conductor-free perovskite heterojunction solar cells by using a low-temperature carbon electrode. PDMS is chosen to package the perovskite solar cells and detailed analysis is carried out. We find the PDMS layer can condense the carbon electrode by filling the gaps in the carbon film during the solidification of PDMS, resulting in an improved MAPbI3/carbon interface condition. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements further prove a more efficient charge transfer process and a slower charge recombination occurred between interfaces after packaging. Besides, the mesoscopic structure of the carbon layer becomes more compact after the encapsulation, preventing the degradation of the perovskite layer caused by humidity. The packaged devices show outstanding stability during a testing period of 3000 h.
Results and discussion
The schematic of the carbon CE based PSC structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). The cell, packaged by PDMS, consists of layers of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/carbon CE. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 has a low exciton binding energy (∼0.5 eV), leading to easy generation of electron–hole pairs under irradiance. Sequentially, the separation of electron–hole pairs is achieved by injecting electrons into TiO2 (−4.0 eV) and transporting the hole to the carbon CE (−5.0 eV), forming a photocurrent in the device. There are 128 solar cells investigated in our study, where 67 cells are encapsulated by PDMS and 61 are without encapsulation. The optimal photocurrent–voltage curves of device I from packaged cells and device II from unpackaged cells are presented in Fig. 1(c) with detailed characteristic parameters listed in Table 1. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) test is further implemented to understand the ability of turning incident photons to extracted electrons at a given wavelength of different devices in Fig. 1(d). As can be seen, the packaged device bears a higher IPCE in the range from 400 to 800 nm and reaches a peak (94%) at 535 nm, yielding a remarkable JSC of 23.5 mA cm−2. In addition, the electron flux of the PSC can be calculated by multiplying the incident spectral response with the measured IPCE, as displayed in Fig. S1.† At shorter wavelengths, the photocurrent is cut-off by FTO and TiO2, as shown in the UV-vis absorbance of FTO and TiO2 (Fig. S2†). The ∼800 nm cut-off wavelength corresponds to the 1.55 eV band gap of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber. Fig. 1(e and f) depict the efficiency distribution of the PSCs. After sealed by PDMS, an average PCE of 7.64% (max. 10.8%) is achieved, higher than the average efficiency of 4.95% (max. 6.88%) of the unpackaged devices. Clearly, these devices exhibit little difference in FF under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight of 100 mW cm−2. The enhanced photovoltaic performance mainly comes from the increment of JSC (from 13.9 to 19.6) and VOC (from 0.83 to 0.88), leading to a marked 54% promotion of PCE.

Despite the widely known high efficiencies, PSCs, especially thin film PSCs, still suffer from the hysteresis effect, which is dependent on scan direction and scan rate. Such hysteresis effect seriously causes cell stability concerns and makes it difficult to accurately determine the cell efficiency. Both the forward and reverse bias sweep are used to evaluate the hysteresis behavior of the PSCs. Fig. 2(a) shows the J–V curves of device I which were performed from the forward bias to short circuit (FB-SC) and from the short circuit to forward bias (SC-FB) at a scan rate of 0.01 V s−1. The device exhibits a FB-SC performance with JSC = 22.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.96 V, FF = 0.456 and PCE = 9.68%, and a SC-FB performance with JSC = 22.2 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.95 V, FF = 0.454, yielding a PCE of 9.58%. Such results reveal unapparent hysteresis of the J–V curves for both SC-FB and FB-SC. The hysteresis effect at different scan rates is also investigated as shown in Fig. S3.† To quantify the hysteresis effect, a dimensional hysteric index (HI) is introduced,56  where Jscan−(VOC/2) is the photocurrent density at the VOC/2 bias for the reverse scan, and Jscan+(VOC/2) is the photocurrent density at VOC/2 for the forward scan. A lower HI corresponds to cells without significant hysteresis, while a higher HI corresponds to hysteretic devices.57 At the scan rate of 0.01 V s−1, the forward and backward curves of the device nearly overlap perfectly with the lowest HI of only 0.03. When the scan rate increases up to 0.03 V s−1, the HI grows to 0.06. When the scan rates further rise to 0.05 V s−1 and 0.1 V s−1, the hysteresis effect becomes worse for the device with higher HI values of 0.14 and 0.16, respectively. The reason for the hysteresis behavior possibly stems from unbalanced charge transportation and collection,58 the perovskite's ferroelectricity,59 ion migration, or defects.60 This is common and hard to avoid in planar heterojunction solar cells. Besides, the steady-state power output at a given constant forward bias is another important parameter to evaluate the PCE.25 As shown in Fig. 2(b), we record the photocurrent density of device I (which is held at a forward bias of 0.61 V near its maximum output power point) as a function of time to monitor the stabilized power output under working conditions. The steady-state photocurrent agrees with that derived from the J–V curve. After illumination at one sun for 500 s, the maximum power output reduced from 9.88% to 8.51%, maintaining 86% of its original performance. This drop in the photocurrent has some connections with the hysteresis of the device.61

A one-step method has been successfully applied to prepare an even perovskite layer on planar PSCs. However, this method is unsuitable for depositing a good pore-filling perovskite layer in a relatively thick mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold required for HTM-free carbon-based PSCs.62–64 On the other hand, the two-step method has been proven to be the most successful deposition method for paintable carbon-based PSCs.65–68Fig. 3(a and b) show the SEM images of the top view of CH3NH3PbI3 fabricated using a modified sequential method. We add a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into PbI2N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) precursor solution to promote crystallization of the perovskite films. DMSO bears a strong coordination ability with PbI2 by which the strong interaction between DMSO and Pb2+ can retard the crystallization of PbI2.69 In addition, the trade-off between DMF and DMSO as solvents in the precursor solution is supposed to control the crystallization of the perovskite film, leading to favorable photovoltaic performances of solar cells. As can be seen, the CH3NH3PbI3 film shows a high surface coverage and excellent uniformity with no pinholes under a low magnification (Fig. 3(a)) or a high magnification (Fig. 3(b)). This is helpful to avoid direct contact between the carbon film and TiO2, resulting in a reduced recombination. The highly roughened interface would also strengthen internal light scattering. The formation of CH3NH3PbI3 in the solid state is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy (see Fig. S4†). The strong diffraction peaks at 14.01, 19.94, 23.44, 24.46, 28.38, 31.80, 40.46 and 43.06 can be assigned to the (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (224) and (314) planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure.70,71 To elucidate the interfacial changes after being packaged by PDMS, the differences of the cross-sectional SEM for devices II and I are compared in Fig. 3(c–f). Energy dispersive spectroscopic mapping of device II is also tested to explore the vertical distribution of Si, O, Sn, Ti, Pb, I, Zr and C (Fig. S5†). For both devices, there is a layer of ∼40 nm compact TiO2 on top of the FTO, followed by a layer of ∼450 nm mesoscopic TiO2 acting as the scaffold for CH3NH3PbI3. The thickness of the carbon layer is around 40 μm. In device II (Fig. 3(c and e)), the perovskite capping layer with a thickness of ∼400 nm shows good contact with the carbon CE, where the carbon film exhibits a mesoscopic structure with large flakes of graphite embedded inside other materials. The PDMS shield has a thickness around 1 mm as shown in Fig. S6.† After being packaged by PDMS in device I, the carbon CE becomes more compact (Fig. 3(d and f)) as the PDMS excellently fills in the gaps existing in the mesoscopic carbon layer. Besides, the MAPbI3/carbon interface condition is improved resulting from the solidification of PDMS. Importantly, the improved interface which shows less pinholes may contribute to more effective carrier transportation, which facilitates an improved photovoltaic performance.

Upon light illumination, both free carriers (electrons and holes) and weakly bound excitons should be generated in CH3NH3PbI3 with a possibility of interchange between the two populations at ambient temperature owing to the low exciton binding energy.72 As sketched in Fig. 4(a), the perovskite will emit fluorescence when recombination happens, while the existence of carbon may export the holes resulting in a suppressed photoluminescence (PL).73 The perovskite films capped by carbon and then packaged by PDMS are characterized using a confocal laser microscope, which measures the spatial distribution of the emission sites in the films.74 As shown in Fig. 4(b), the emission sites decrease gradually after being printed by carbon and packaged by PDMS. In addition, the PL measurements, which are often used to demonstrate the charge extraction ability of the hole-conducting material in contact with the perovskite,75 are performed to evaluate whether the carbon film efficiently extracts photogenerated electrons from the perovskite absorber or not. The perovskite layer was deposited on bare quartz and the insulating mesoporous layer is omitted to exhibit the performance of carbon layer. Fig. 4(c) displays the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite/carbon and perovskite/carbon/PDMS together with the independent perovskite. Strong luminescence occurs at ∼780 nm for the PL of CH3NH3PbI3, and is suppressed with the existence of the carbon film. What's more, the PL quenches in a greater degree after packaging by PDMS, proving an enhanced electron injection, collection, and transport efficiency. Fig. 4(d) presents the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) curves of these samples, of which the fitted time constants τe (associated with the electron–hole lifetime of the perovskite) are 58.24, 43.52, and 36.80 ns, respectively. These results elucidate that the PDMS packaged PSCs are more likely to accelerate light-induced charge separation and restrict carrier recombination.25

Transient JSC and VOC profiles are measured to investigate the charge transport and recombination properties of the devices.74 The instantaneous current when the light is switched on is to measure the flux of holes into the surface. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the JSC of device I rises fast and quickly reaches a stable point, while the JSC of device II rises fast, subsequently decays and rises again to reach a stable point. Here, the subsequent decay of JSC towards the steady current is ascribed to the capture of build-up holes in surface states associated with recombination.76 What's more, the VOC in Fig. 5(b) also shows a slow decay in the PSCs packaged by PDMS, consistent with the reduced carrier recombination and prolonged electron lifetime.71 The decreased baseline for device II indicating an unstable state of the solar cells may stem from the structure or material. Actually, the stability for perovskite solar cells under continuous illumination is still challenging and the possible degradation mechanisms are under investigation.43,77,78 The improved situation for device I is attributed to the improved MAPbI3/carbon interface condition. Derived from the photovoltage decay curve we can obtain the electron lifetimes (τn) according to,  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the positive elementary charge. Fig. 5(c) plots the electron lifetimes as a function of photovoltage. The longer electron lifetime of device I indicates a smaller charge recombination rate and a higher charge collection efficiency than device II.71 To evaluate the function of PDMS, the leakage current test is carried out on both devices I and II under dark conditions, and the results are displayed in Fig. 5(d). The devices reveal a diode-like behavior. Obviously, the carrier leakage in the interfacial charge transfer process of device I is suppressed, which may benefit from a better charge collection efficiency.79

Furthermore, EIS measurements are conducted to investigate the internal electrical properties of the PSCs in the dark. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots (b and c) and corresponding Bode phase plots (d) in the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 100 Hz. The Nyquist plots of the devices are measured at −0.85 V in the dark and the equivalent circuit model for the devices is shown in Fig. 6(a). The series resistance (Rs) in the fitted equivalent circuit model is equal to the value of the high-frequency intercept on the real axis.80 The frequency analysis shows two separated semicircles in the Nyquist diagram and two peaks in the Bode plot for device I, while only one such characteristic is observed for device II. The main semicircle in the low frequency range can be ascribed to the capacitance and recombination resistance (Rrec). Meanwhile, the incomplete semicircle in the high frequency range is mainly associated with the capacitance and transfer resistance (Rtr).81 Detailed EIS parameters of device I and device II with a bias at −0.85 V are summarized in Table S1.† For device II, the difference between Rtr and Rrec is relatively less than device I, thus the first arc merges into the second arc, making it difficult to be recognized. Extracting from the Nyquist plots at different applied bias (−0.20 V to −0.9 V), we plot Rtr and Rrec as a function of the bias as shown in Fig. 6(c and d). After packaging by PDMS, device I displays a smaller Rtr and larger Rrec, demonstrating a much more efficient charge transfer process and a slower charge recombination between interfaces. A four-point probe resistivity measurement system is further employed to study the change of electrical conductivities of the carbon films before and after encapsulation by PDMS, and the results are listed in Table S2.† The sheet resistance of the carbon layer shows a little increment after the encapsulation, which is unfavorable for the solar cell. Thus, the improved performance mainly results from the improved MAPbI3/carbon interface condition during the solidification of PDMS.

Long-term stability is another critical concern for the practical application of PSCs. Herein we present a stability test of both devices I and II stored in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature (humidity ∼ 20%), as shown in Fig. 7(a). Device II without encapsulation owns an initial PCE of 6.21%, and device I packaged by PDMS has an initial PCE of 8.61%. After 1500 h, the PCE of device II begins to decrease because of the degradation of the perovskite layer, while device I experiences a much more stable PCE during the whole test period. Multiple tests are further conducted as recorded in Table S3.† The carbon CE printed on the perovskite layer has a thickness of ∼40 μm, acting as a shield to prevent the perovskite layer from degradation which is consistent with the previous reports.44,65,67 However, the stability of the carbon CE based perovskite solar cells is limited due to the porous structure of the carbon CE. At a certain degree, the humidity will get through the carbon layer and degrade the perovskite layer, leading to a rapid drop in the PCE. Apparently, the PSCs exhibit superior stability after being encapsulated by PDMS, since PDMS can excellently isolate water in air and avoid degradation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, as displayed in Fig. S7.† Interestingly, one thing drawing our attention is the variation of VOC as shown in Fig. 7(b). The VOC of device I increases from 0.87 V to 0.98 V, and finally stabilizes at around 0.97 V, while the VOC of device II exhibits a descending trend. Fig. S8† shows the photograph of our testing result without a metal mask for device I under AM 1.5 solar light of 100 mW cm−2. One single cell with an active area of about 1 cm2 can provide an impressive VOC of 1.034 V. The possible reason for the increment of VOC may be associated with the interface state between the perovskite layer and carbon CE82 and the ferroelectric nature of perovskite materials.83 The detailed mechanism still needs to be further investigated.

Given the practical application of the PSCs, a tandem system based on 4 individual cells is demonstrated in Fig. S9(a).† The system is used to drive 12 blue LEDs as shown in Fig. S9(b).† Tested under a standard AM 1.5 solar light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity (Fig. S9(c)†), the tandem PSC system shows a short-circuit photocurrent JSC of 2.62 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage VOC of 3.76 V, and a fill factor FF of 0.586, corresponding to a light to electric power conversion efficiency of 5.77%. This result demonstrates the feasibility of future applications of the PSC energy conversion system.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated low temperature carbon CE based HTM-free mesoscopic perovskite devices and encapsulated them by low-cost PDMS. Interestingly, the introduction of PDMS can condense the mesoscopic carbon layer and improve the MAPbI3/carbon interface condition during the solidification of PDMS, leading to an optimal photovoltaic performance: a power conversion efficiency of 10.8%, a VOC of 0.97 V, a JSC of 23.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.474. The results exhibit a remarkable 54% enhancement over those without encapsulation. The improved performance is associated with a more efficient charge transfer process and slower charge recombination between interfaces. Also, the robust PDMS acts as a protective shield to isolate water in air, avoiding the degradation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. The packaged devices show outstanding stability during the testing period of 3000 h. Our work paves the way for realizing low cost, highly efficient and stable hybrid photovoltaic cells.
