    , Accepted 14th July 2018First published on 17th July 2018AbstractConjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are a unique class of polymers that consist of an extended π-conjugated backbone and reactive side groups. Owing to the non-planar configuration of the monomer, these polymers form a solid 3D crosslinked framework that facilitates charge transport in the polymers. Herein, we report the synthesis of CMP films polymerized by electrochemical deposition and their use as hole transporting layers in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). With this strategy, the thickness could be precisely controlled by the scan cycle. The pH neutral CMP film avoids the acidity of the commercial PEDOT:PSS, which is the most commonly used hole transporting material in OPVs. With CMP films, we achieve comparable device performances with PEDOT:PSS containing devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM. Afforded by the described electrochemical approach, the amounts of materials needed to reach a target film thickness can be favorably saved with respect to those with spin-casting, which provides an opportunity for reducing the cost of OPVs.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have emerged into promising photoelectrical applications due to their unique advantages, i.e. light-weight, flexibility, low-cost, and potential to manufacture with roll-to-roll technology.1–3 Under illumination, charges that are generated in the active layer due to photoexcitation need to transport to the electrodes to provide the photovoltaic effect. Since the first OPV devices reported by C. W. Tang, this field has witnessed a great development. With the efforts of researchers, the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the laboratory has been reported to be over 14%.3–5 So far, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been mostly used as the transparent hole collecting anode, and a low work function metal (e.g. aluminum, silver) is usually used as the electron collecting cathode. It has been proven that inserting a buffer layer between the ITO electrode and active layer to facilitate hole extraction could result in enhanced PCEs.6 So far, the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) or PDEOT:PSS has dominated as the hole transporting layer (HTL) due to its high conductivity, low opaqueness, good film forming properties, etc. However, the intrinsic characteristics of PEDOT:PSS including its hygroscopicity and acidity tend to inevitably corrode the ITO, causing faster degradations in device stability and efficiency. To seek alternatives for PEDOT:PSS, there have been many efforts in searching for new HTL materials, such as transition metal oxides (MoO3,7–11 CuOx,12 V2O513,14) and conductive polymers (CPE,15–18 PANI,19,20 TPA21–23). Despite the successes in certain applications with these materials, obtaining effective HTLs has been listed as one of the main bottlenecks toward efficient and stable OPV devices.
Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are a class of polymers24–26 in which the backbones are covalently connected by the extended π-conjugated units, with electro-reactive groups as side groups, such as thiophenes, pyrroles, carbazoles, and so on. As a 3D framework, it tends to form a microporous structure, leading to a larger surface area. This enables the application of CMPs in gas separation and storage.24,27 Besides, CMPs can be synthesized through solution methods, based on the well-established Suzuki reaction,28 Sonogashira reaction,29 Yamamoto reaction,30 oxidative coupling reaction, etc.31 The majority of CMPs are insoluble and non-processable in most solvents. Therefore, it is not easy to fabricate high-quality films of CMPs using spin-coating. A few approaches for the film deposition of CMPs have been introduced, including layer-by-layer cross-linking,32 surface-initiated synthesis,33 and so on. However, the associated complexity due to the poor solubility or processability in these methods may limit their practical applications with CMPs.
The electrochemical deposition method has been proven to be an effective route to fabricate thin films of electroactive and conducting polymers.25,34,35 In this method, the precursors are oxidized, followed by the coupling reaction of the precursors at the electrode surface, resulting in the deposition of target films onto conductive glass. In particular, it requires only little amounts of precursor solutions to reach the desired film thickness, thus effectively reducing the consumption of the materials compared to the commonly used spin-coating.
In this study, we take advantage of the electrochemical deposition of CMPs to obtain high-quality films for HTLs in OPVs. The monomer with carbazole groups was synthesized according to the method reported in a previous study,34 then it was polymerized onto the ITO glass. The carbazole groups can be coupled chemically at a low oxidation potential with simultaneously the formation of an extended π-conjugated backbone. Such a feature facilitates the charge transport along the polymer main chain in the CMP. The success in the polymerization of the CMP was confirmed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Then, we applied the ultimate CMP film to organic solar cells as a hole transporting layer (HTL). We found that the specific deposition conditions for the CMP play a critical role in the photovoltaic behavior, and by controlling the scan cycle, the film thickness of the CMP can be precisely tuned, providing a modulation on solar cell parameters via the interface route. Under optimal conditions, the CMP containing device exhibits a comparable PCE with that using PEDOT:PSS while unfavourable acidity in the HTL can be avoided, benefiting the long-term stability.
Results and discussion
The small molecule 2,2′,7,7′-tetra(carbazol-9-yl)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (SpCz) was synthesized based on the method reported previously, including the substitutions of bromine, then carbazole groups (Fig. 1a). The final product was characterized by 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 8.32–8.25 (d, J = 7.09 Hz, 8H, Ar-H), 8.20–8.07 (t, J = 7.83 Hz, 8H, Ar-H), 7.76–7.66 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 4H, Ar-H), 7.51–7.49 (s, 4H, Ar-H), 7.42–7.35 (m, 4H, Ar-H), 7.32–7.28 (d, J = 10.39 Hz, Ar-H). The peaks before 2 ppm can result from the dissolution process.

Then the films were fabricated by a multi-cycled cyclic voltammetry (CV) method with the three-electrode system. The CV profiles for the deposition process are added in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† During the deposition process, the color of the ITO substrate changed to light yellow from the light purple of the substrate in the pristine condition (Fig. 1b). After washing with polar solvents acetonitrile or dichloromethane, the color of the films was maintained due to their low solubility in these solvents. This result confirms the high adhesiveness of the CMP films deposited on the ITO substrates.
The film was produced on the ITO anode by CV deposition of SpCz pre-dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile and dichloromethane (1:4 v/v) containing tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte.34 At a higher potential, the current increased rapidly. This behavior indicated that larger amounts of carbazole groups were oxidized and polymerized with the pre-oxidized carbazole groups to form the films. Interestingly, the current proportionally increases with the scan number with the film growth on the glass substrates.
Considering the reactive positions of the carbazole group, the polymer film was successfully polymerized. We further examined the exact structure of the polymer by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1c. As a control sample, the monomer was dissolved in DCM. The peaks at 1200, 1320, 1460, and 1600 nm show blue-shifts, due to the increased bond stability and steric hindrance for the overlap of the carbazole groups after polymerization. Also, owing to the conjugated effect of the carbazole groups, the peaks at 2850 nm and 2920 nm, attributed to the vibration of the C–H bond, red-shift to 2890 nm and 2970 nm, respectively. Besides, the peaks at 730 nm and 3050 nm of the deformation and stretching vibration of the di-substituted benzene ring disappear after polymerization, while new peaks appear at 880 and 930 nm, which confirms that the coupling reaction occurs at the carbazole groups to form the tri-substituted benzene groups.
Upon controlling the parameters in the CV process, including the precursor solution concentration, cut-off potential, and scan cycle number, films with different thicknesses can be obtained. We plot the thickness of the CMP and scan cycles in Fig. 2a together with linear fittings. The satisfactory linearity indicates that the thickness can be delicately controlled by the scan cycle number. Based on the thickness characterization with profilometry and ellipsometry, we found that each cycle contributes ∼15 nm to the total film thickness.

We further examined the energetics of the obtained CMP films with Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM, Fig. 3), in which the films show a work function (WF) of −5.03 eV. The match between the HOMO energy of the CMP films and that of commonly used donor materials in organic photovoltaics (e.g. PTB7-Th) leads to the formation of an ideal cascade structure (Fig. 2b). As such, the holes can be efficiently extracted at the ITO substrates. Together with a polyelectrolyte PFN as the cathode interlayer, we fabricated OPV devices with an ITO/CMP/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/Al configuration (Fig. 2c), in which the electrode Al was deposited atop the PFN layer in a vacuum.

The morphologies and WFs of the CMP films and PEDOT:PSS were characterized with KPFM and are shown in Fig. 3. The higher WF of −5.03 eV for the CMP film can facilitate better hole extraction for OPV devices compared with PEDOT:PSS with a WF of −4.94 eV. The surface roughness of the CMP slightly decreases compared to PEDOT:PSS, which indicates that a smooth surface in the polymerized CMP film can be achieved. This is beneficial for solution deposition of active layers of OPVs.

Fig. 4a–c show current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cells with different CMP HTLs obtained under different deposition conditions, including the concentration of the precursor solution, the cut-off potential and the number of scan cycles. The detailed device parameters are shown in Tables S1–S3 (ESI†). The optimal deposition conditions were determined, with a monomer concentration of 0.4 mmol, a cut-off potential of 1.4 V, and a scan number of 2 times. When further increasing the deposition potential beyond the optimum (1.4 V), the CMP film may be subject to oxidization, resulting in a poor film quality. This explains the observed reduction of PCE at higher potentials. Thus, the devices with a CMP thickness of 30 nm display the highest performance.

As a reference device, we fabricated OPVs with the commonly used PEDOT:PSS HTL. The J–V curves of devices with different HTLs are compared in Fig. 4d and the statistical device parameters of 25 devices in Table 1. The CMP-devices deliver a slightly higher efficiency than the PEDOT:PSS-devices. The enhanced performance is attributed to the increase of Voc from 0.78 to 0.80 V and Jsc from 15.94 to 16.14 mA cm−2. This possibly results from the deeper HOMO level of the CMP films with a modulation of the built-in potential and charge recombination. As seen from the external quantum efficiency spectra shown in Fig. 4e, we note a gain of photocurrent in two spectral regimes (360 nm to 470 nm and 520 nm to 700 nm). This higher EQE confirms the increase of Jsc.

At last, we explored illumination intensity dependent Jsc in these two devices (Fig. 4f). In general, the power law dependence of Jsc as a function of illumination intensity (I) follows the relation: Jsc ∝ Iα, where α is the exponential factor.33 The deviation of α from unity reflects a change from bimolecular recombination to other types such as the first order monomolecular recombination.33 The values of α are 0.91 and 0.93 for PEDOT:PSS- and CMP-containing devices, respectively. The similar values indicate that the dominant bimolecular charge recombination in the solar cells approximately is retained in the concerned solar cells with CMP-based hole transporting layers.
Conclusions
To summarize, a pH-neutral CMP film based on the carbazole group was successfully polymerized by in situ electrochemical deposition. The film thickness can be precisely controlled by the number of scan cycles. Due to the matching of the energetics of the CMP with those of commonly used materials, CMP thin films are successfully used as HTLs for organic solar cells. Under optimal deposition conditions, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cell with the CMP HTL slightly outperforms that with widely used PEDOT:PSS, benefitting from the increase of Voc and Jsc. From a practical standpoint, the demonstrated interface approach based on electrochemical polymerization for CMPs provides an opportunity to circumvent the unfavorable acidity in PEDOT:PSS, and also profits from the reduced consumption of materials toward large-scale device production with low cost.
Experimental
Synthesis of the monomer
9,9′-Spirobifluorene was dissolved in chloroform, then the ferric bromide (FeBr3) were added in an ice-bath. The solution was warmed to ambient temperature and stirred for 3 h. After purification, the product 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9'-spirobifluorene (SpBr) could be obtained as a white powder. Then SpBr was added to 1,2-dichlorobenzene, with carbazole, copper(I) iodide, potassium carbonate and 2,2′-bipyridine, in a round flask. After the degassing process, the system was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere and 200 °C for 72 h. Purified with rotary evaporation and column chromatography, the final product SpCz was obtained as a light-yellow powder.
Device fabrication
For film fabrication, the monomer was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile and DCM (1:4 v/v) with TBAP (0.1 mol) as supporting electrolyte. The quality of the films could be controlled by controlling the parameters in the CV process, including the monomer concentration, cut-off potential, and scan cycles. For device fabrication, the patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, respectively. Then the ITO glass was treated in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) was spin coated onto the ITO substrate. PTB7-Th and PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) were dissolved in a mixture of chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (100:3 v/v) to form a solution with a PTB7-Th concentration of 12 mg ml−1. PFN was dissolved in methanol to prepare a solution of 0.5 mg ml−1, then spin coated onto the active layer. Finally, the electrode Al was thermally evaporated under vacuum, i.e. a chamber pressure less than 1 × 10−4 Pa, and a device area of 0.04 cm−2. The devices were fabricated in a nitrogen glove box.
The CV process was performed with a three-electrode system, with Ag/Ag+ and platinum as a reference and counter electrode, respectively. The current-density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics and EQEs of the devices were recorded using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter under a nitrogen environment, whereby a xenon lamp coupled with AM 1.5G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The KPFM measurement of sample surfaces was performed using an atomic force microscopic (AFM) system (model Bruker Dimension Icon).
