    , Accepted 9th January 2023First published on 11th January 2023AbstractNon-fullerene acceptor-based polymer solar cells (NFA-PSCs) can exhibit high morphological stability under thermal stress, often resulting in the fabrication of thermally stable NFA-PSCs. Here, our stability study with systematic steps shows that high morphological stability of active layers does not necessarily guarantee high thermal stability for NFA-PSCs. Furthermore, a degradation pathway is elucidated by using two NFA-PSCs comprising well-known polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors such as PTB7-Th, PBDB-T-2Cl, and ITIC-4F. Morphologies of the PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F and PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F blends are highly stable at a high temperature of 110 °C. However, the corresponding NFA-PSCs degrade severely at the same temperature. For example, all the NFA-PSCs show an efficiency reduction of greater than 30% within an hour, particularly owing to the significant decrease in the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). A series of experiments, including time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements, demonstrate that the penetration of metal oxide molecules into the photoactive layer occurs upon heating, resulting in degradation. The diffused molecules can act as charge recombination centers, leading to decreases in JSC and FF. Finally, we provide insights, from a material design perspective, into the prevention of undesirable penetration of metal oxide molecules.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) stand out as a compelling renewable energy technology owing to their advantages such as lightweight, semitransparent, and flexible properties to name a few.1–3 PSCs are on track in terms of pushing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) to the commercialization level, e.g., the PCE of PSCs exceeds over 18%,4,5via concerted efforts on materials and device processing.6–11 However, PSCs are still short-lived when exposed to air, ultraviolet (UV) light, and heat, which is the main obstacle hindering their commercialization.12 Photo-oxidation degradation of PSCs can be mitigated or resolved by introducing additional protection layers such as encapsulants or UV-light filters.13–16 Meanwhile, the thermal degradation problem persists because PSCs must be subjected to high thermal stress for solar harvesting. Depending on the deployed areas, it inevitably results in an increase in the PSC temperature of 50–100 °C.17
Non-fullerene acceptor (NFA)-based PSCs (NFA-PSCs) are gaining attention due to their better thermal stabilities and higher efficiencies than fullerene-based PSCs.18–21 At high temperatures, fullerene acceptors such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) undergo micro-scale crystallization in blends with polymer donors due to the slow nucleation rate of PC61BM, which deteriorates photovoltaic performance.22,23 In contrast, NFAs can be designed to have high glass transition temperatures (Tg), such that they can withstand high thermal stress. For example, one of the representative NFAs, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) or its derivatives, can have Tg values of over 200 °C,21,24 which is higher than that of PC61BM (∼110–140 °C).25–27 When exposed to high thermal stress below their Tg, ITICs were found to form nanoscale crystals in the active layers, which in fact resulted in PCE improvement rather than degradation.24 Thus, encouragingly, the recent work by Brabec et al. suggested that the ITIC-based NFA-PSCs with ∼10 years of longevity are feasible.28 In addition, Y-family oligomers were developed and the resulting PSCs were thermally stable due to the slow diffusion rate of the oligomeric acceptors.29,30
Recent results on the high thermal stability of NFA-PSCs are indeed promising; however, an understanding of the underlying thermal degradation mechanisms is still lacking. Most prior studies have purely focused on the morphological stability of active layers by eliminating the buffer layer and top electrode.20,21,31–35 This helped to explicitly demonstrate the impact of blend morphologies on device stability without the intervention of any other factors. However, given the operating conditions of PSCs, a stability study using a full device configuration is imperative. In practice, it is not easy to decouple complex degradation pathways occurring simultaneously in multi-layered devices. For unveiling potential degradation factors during PSC operation, it may be the most viable approach to scrutinize the thermal stabilities with and without the presence of the buffer layer/electrode; however, such an attempt is not usually made.
Herein, our systematic studies reveal a critical degradation pathway in NFA-PSCs with a full device configuration – penetrating metal oxide molecules into the active layers. We demonstrate that the thermal stabilities of NFA-PSCs can deteriorate drastically, while their morphological stabilities remain intact under the same conditions. At 110 °C, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results indicate that morphological changes in the photoactive layer are marginal. As a result, the PCEs of NFA-PSC devices are unchanged when following the pre-annealing method: a MoO3 buffer layer and an Ag electrode are deposited after the photoactive layer is thermally annealed (Scheme 1). However, we observe significant, rapid thermal degradation in the thermal stability test with the full device configuration. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements confirm the diffusion of MoO3 molecules into the photoactive layer when the devices are subjected to thermal stress. Analyses based on various spectroscopies and device characterizations indicate that the migrated molecules can act as charge recombination centers within the active layer, thereby leading to a significant loss in the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) values of the devices. Finally, we discuss the design principles for active layer materials to overcome burn-in degradation due to metal oxide diffusion.

Results and discussion
We used a standard inverted device architecture with a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag for this study (Scheme 1). For active layers, we considered poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) and poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-chloro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T-2Cl or PM7) as polymer donors and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC-4F) as a NFA. Then, we fabricated PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F and PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F NFA-PSCs as model systems and also prepared fullerene-based PSCs of PTB7-Th:PC71BM for comparison (Scheme 1). Using these combinations, we conducted systematic studies on the effect of different active layer materials on thermal degradation behaviors. All the devices were optimized according to the literature36–38 and the results are summarized in Table S1†. The detailed procedures for device optimization and stability testing are provided in the Experimental section.
We first start off with the discussions on thermal stabilities of pre-annealed NFA-based and fullerene-based PSCs. As shown in Scheme 1, the thermal stability study based on the pre-annealing method was performed in the following manner: (i) photoactive layers were fabricated on the ITO/ZnO substrates, (ii) the samples were heated at 90 °C (fullerene-PSCs) and 110 °C (NFA-PSCs) for only 10 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox, and (iii) the MoO3 buffer layer and the Ag electrode were deposited onto the samples to assess the photovoltaic performances. The reason for considering certain temperatures and short annealing times is discussed below. The PCEs of the devices remained nearly unchanged or improved slightly in the short pre-annealing method (Fig. 1a and Table S1†): the PCEs of fresh and pre-annealed devices were 8.14 and 8.16% for the PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F blend, 10.52 and 10.63% for the PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F blend, and 8.67 and 8.77% for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend, respectively. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1b, photovoltaic performances decreased significantly in the post-annealing method that is shown in Scheme 1; results for the post-annealing method will be discussed in more detail later. This result indicates that the burn-in loss within 10 min of heat exposure is due to the degradation of the buffer layer and/or electrode, and not the change in the photoactive layers.
 Fig. 1  Thermal stabilities of three different PSCs measured based on the (a) pre-annealing and (b) post-annealing methods; NFA-PSCs and fullerene-PSCs were exposed to 110 °C and 90 °C heat for a short period of 10 min. 
To elucidate that the pre-annealing method does not result in the deterioration of the photovoltaic performances, we characterized the surface morphologies of the fresh and pre-annealed thin films using AFM. As shown in Fig. S1,† the AFM height images suggest that the active layers before and after the pre-annealing have nearly identical surface morphologies without notable phase separation. Similar root mean square (RMS) roughness values of three different PSCs also support this claim (PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F PSCs: 1.55 nm → 1.60 nm, PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F PSCs: 3.12 nm → 3.09 nm, and PTB7-Th:PC71BM: 1.18 nm → 1.37 nm). In addition, the phase images exhibited negligible changes before and after the pre-annealing treatment (Fig. S2†).
We also analyzed the nanoscale structural alterations caused by the pre-annealing treatment through the GIWAXS measurements. As shown in Fig. S3,†PTB7-Th-based blend films, i.e., the PTB7-Th:ITIF-4F and PTB7-Th:PC71BM, exhibited improved molecular ordering when exposed to the pre-annealing conditions. For example, the PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F blend showed that the scattering peak associated with the alkyl side-chain stackings (at qxy = 0.32 Å−1) and that associated with the π–π stackings (qz = 1.66 Å−1) became more intense after pre-annealing at 110 °C. This indicates that pre-annealing induces more ordered face-on molecular packings.39 The PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend also showed a similar behavior; the alkyl side-chain stackings at qxy = 0.37 Å−1 and isotropic PC71BM aggregate peak at q ≈ 1.30 Å−1 were intensified after the pre-annealing process.40 In the PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F blend, a slightly enhanced scattering peak from the alkyl side-chain stackings was observed in the out-of-plane direction. Although there is a difference in the degree of enhancement of molecular ordering, all the blend systems show more ordered structures after pre-annealing for a short period of 10 min. This can facilitate the efficient charge transport properties of PSCs.
The AFM and GIWAXS measurements suggest that the short period (10 min) of thermal stress does not induce macroscale phase separation and only improves molecular ordering. Therefore, all devices preserved their photovoltaic performances after the pre-annealing process, or exhibited slight improvements in the PCEs. Since our study does not aim to investigate how pre-annealing affects blend morphologies and the resulting photovoltaic performances, we will discuss the thermal stability behavior of NFA-PSCs with a full device configuration.
The thermal stabilities of the PSC devices were examined after the deposition of the MoO3 buffer layer and Ag electrode; this process is called the post-annealing method (Scheme 1). Annealing was performed under inert N2 gas. First, the normalized photovoltaic performances of the NFA-PSCs were plotted as a function of the post-annealing temperature, as shown in Fig. 2a and Table S2†. The post-annealing time was fixed at 10 min, which is the same as that for the pre-annealing method. In contrast to the pre-annealing results, all the devices showed a sharp decrease (10–20%) in the PCEs: PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F (110 °C), PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F (110 °C), and PTB7-Th:PC71BM (90 °C) showed 88%, 87%, and 82% of their initial PCE values, respectively, after the post-annealing method. This result indicates that the degradation of the PSCs caused by heat exposure for a short period is associated with the MoO3 buffer layer and/or the Ag electrode, and not the morphological change of the photoactive layers.
 Fig. 2  Normalized photovoltaic performances of three different PSCs as a function of (a) post-annealing temperature (time was fixed to 10 min) and (b) time (temperature was fixed at TD). All devices are thermally annealed with the full configuration: ITO/ZnO/active layers/MoO3/Ag. 
When evaluating the thermal stability of the three different PSCs by systematically varying the temperature, the onset temperature at which the devices begin to degrade was found to differ depending on the photoactive layers. For example, the onset temperatures were ∼60 °C, ∼80 °C, and ∼100 °C for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs, PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F, and PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F PSCs, respectively. This result suggests that the components of the photoactive layers impact the thermal stability of PSCs in a full device configuration, and the NFA-PSCs may have better stability under thermal stress; the interplay between the photoactive materials and the thermal stability is discussed later in detail.
Next, we narrowed our focus to identifying the degradation pathways. To this end, we examined the thermal stability by fixing the temperature at which the PCEs degrade by 10–20% (denoted as TD). The TD values were 90 °C for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs and 110 °C for the other two NFA-PSCs. We assessed the thermal stability as a function of time at these TDs (Fig. 2b). The PCEs of all the devices were observed to decrease after only 1 min of the post-annealing process, and they decreased to 80–90% after 10 min. Upon heating the devices longer at the TDs, all the devices exhibited significantly deteriorated PCEs, showing more than 30% loss compared to their initial PCE values at 1 h. We observed that the PSCs exhibited a prominent reduction (>10%) in the JSC and FF values, indicating that the degradation is associated with the charge transport/recombination characteristics in the devices. The VOC values were also reduced by 5–10% of the initial values, particularly in NFA-PSCs. The voltage loss is also expected to be associated with the charge recombination in PSCs.41–43
The two contrasting results discussed above, i.e., the pre-annealing test vs. the post-annealing test results, led us to the assumption that the thermal instabilities of both the NFA and fullerene-PSCs are due to the presence of the MoO3 buffer layer and/or the Ag electrode. We first considered the possibility of the energy level misalignment caused by the work function shift of the MoO3 layer during the heat exposure of the devices. It has been reported that the oxygen vacancies in MoO3 can create gap states in the forbidden energy gap and shift the Fermi level of MoO3, which increases the hole injection barrier at the interface.44–46 The density of oxygen vacancies in the MoO3 layer can be increased by thermal annealing or air exposure.44–46 Thus, we characterized the electronic structures of the MoO3 layer via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). We prepared devices without the Ag electrode (ITO/ZnO/active layers/MoO3) and employed UPS on the MoO3 surfaces with or without the post-annealing treatment at TDs; the spectra are displayed in Fig. S4.† We calculated the HOMO energy levels of MoO3 to examine the impact of the post-annealing at TDs on the electronic structures of MoO3 (Table S3†). All the blends showed a negligible shift in the valence bands after the post-annealing treatment: HOMO energy level differences (ΔEHOMO) for PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F, PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F, and PTB7-Th:PC71BM were only −0.09, −0.07, and −0.07 eV, respectively. This means that the increased hole injection barrier induced by the oxygen vacancies of MoO3 is not the origin of the device degradation in our case, which is in agreement with a previous report where Zhang et al. observed a distinct change in the electronic structures of the MoO3 layer only when it was exposed to very high temperatures above 200 °C.44
We checked the likelihood that the buffer layer (MoO3) and the Ag electrode penetrate into the photoactive layers, thereby negatively impacting the device performance.47,48 To verify this, we measured the ToF-SIMS spectra before and after applying thermal stress to the devices with an inverted structure of the ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 3). The ToF-SIMS measurements allow us to analyze the vertical distribution of the components of the PSC devices. We defined the active layer regions by tracking the depth profiles of the C+ ion and investigated whether MoO3 (by tracking Mo+) and Ag (by tracking Ag+) atoms appear within the active layer regions under post-annealing conditions. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 3a–c, Ag and MoO3 appear to diffuse into the active layer for both fresh NFA- and fullerene-PSCs. It has been reported that thermally evaporated metal or metal oxides with high kinetic energy impact the surface of devices;47–50 this can produce a sublayer of evaporated molecules on the surface, or evaporated molecules can evenly distribute from the top surface to the bottom side. After the post-annealing treatment, a distinct change in Mo+ signals was detected for all the devices. The MoO3 molecules diffused into the active layer compared to the fresh ones (see right panel of Fig. 3a–c). This result indicates that the post-annealing treatment at TDs induces the diffusion of some portion of the MoO3 molecules for both the NFA- and fullerene-PSCs, which is possibly the main reason for thermal degradation.
 Fig. 3  ToF-SIMS depth profiles of (a) PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F, (b) PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F, and (c) PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs before and after the post-annealing for 10 min at TD. Magnified Mo+ signals around the top surface region of the active layers are shown in the right panel. 
To gain more insight into the penetration of MoO3 molecules under the post-annealing treatment, we employed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We fabricated PSC devices without the ZnO layer (viz. ITO/active layer/MoO3/Ag) to eliminate the response issue associated with the ZnO layer under dark conditions.51 Prior to measuring the EIS for our PSCs, a blank device with the configuration of ITO/MoO3/Ag was first measured to rule out the possibility that the MoO3 and Ag layers affect the resistance of the device upon thermal stress (Fig. S5†). Since no resistive layer is present in ITO/MoO3/Ag, the metallic contact behavior with a very low resistance of approximately 9 Ω was observed. When the blank device was post-annealed at TD, we did not observe a meaningful change in the EIS spectra, suggesting that the MoO3 buffer layer and the Ag electrode remain intact without any significant chemical degradation or delamination after the post-annealing treatment.
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 4a, Nyquist plots containing the photoactive layers showed different behaviors before and after post-annealing treatment; the EIS measurements were performed in 1 M–1 Hz frequency under zero bias and dark conditions. All devices exhibited a depressed semicircle in the Nyquist plots, which can be analyzed using a resistor-capacitor parallel circuit.47,52,53 To extract exactly each resistance value, we used the simple equivalent circuit model as shown in Table S4;†RS and R1 are the series resistance and recombination resistance of the devices, which can be obtained from high and low-frequency regions, respectively. According to the data provided in Table S4,† all the devices showed a slight decrease in RS values after the post-annealing treatment, e.g., the PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F devices (19.2 to 19.0 Ω), PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F devices (15.0 to 10.4 Ω), and PTB7-Th:PC71BM (14.5 to 9.4 Ω). This indicates that interface properties between the anode (or cathode) and the active layer are improved, but not significant.54 We assume that this marginal difference does not affect the device performance after the post-annealing treatment. However, the recombination resistances of the post-annealed devices dramatically decreased compared to the fresh devices, e.g., the PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F devices (528.2 to 298.6 Ω), PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F devices (2902.0 to 1288.0 Ω), and PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1456.0 to 966.2 Ω). Considering the ToF-SIMS results, it can be concluded that this significant reduction in the recombination resistance is due to the diffusion of the MoO3 molecules to the photoactive layers, and diffused MoO3 acts as a recombination center. Sung et al. also observed a similar behavior with the PTB7:PC71BM blend system.47

(b) Plots of JSCvs. light intensity for the fresh and post-annealed devices. (c) J–V curves of the fresh and post-annealed devices measured under ambient, room temperature and dark conditions. 
To elucidate the effect of the penetration of MoO3 molecules on the recombination properties, we measured the light intensity-dependent JSC and VOC of the PSCs before and after post-annealing. First, bimolecular recombination in the PSCs was investigated based on the known relationship between JSC and light intensity (P): JSC ∝ Pα. When the bimolecular recombination in the devices is negligible, the slope α (which can be derived by plotting log(Jsc) vs. log(Pα)) is close to unity. Otherwise, α deviates from unity (smaller than 1). As shown in Fig. 4b, after exposure to thermal stress, all the devices showed a marked drop in the α value, i.e., for the PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F PSCs (0.872 to 0.838); PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F PSCs (0.871 to 0.844); and PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs (0.902 to 0.829). This result suggests that increased bimolecular recombination in devices is likely to occur due to the increased population of the metal oxide impurities in the active layers by thermal stress. We also examined the dependence of VOC on P based on the relationship: VOC ∝ nkT/q ln (P), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. The slope becomes greater than 1 kT/q for the PSC devices involving trap-assisted recombination and less than 1 kT/q in the presence of the surface recombination at the active layer/contact interface.55–57 We found that the changes in the slopes after heating were insignificant, that is, for the PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F PSCs (1.115 to 1.150); PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F PSCs (1.080 to 1.095); and PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs (1.054 to 1.081) (Fig. S6†). We speculate that the trap-assisted recombination and the surface recombination at the active layers/MoO3 layer compete together; therefore, it is not easy to analyze the data in Fig. S6.† In this regard, we calculated the trap density of states (tDOS) for the representative blend system, non-fullerene PSCs of PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F, using capacitance measurements.58 The device structure was identical to that used in EIS measurements; the detailed procedures are described in the Experimental section. As shown in Fig. S7,† the tDOS at the Gaussian center position increased after the post-annealing treatment: from 3.87 × 1019 cm−3 to 8.93 × 1019 cm−3. These values are not exact because we conducted capacitance measurements by eliminating the ZnO layer, but their relative difference in tDOS provides evidence for the increased trap density with the post-annealing treatment. Thus, we conclude that the diffused MoO3 impurities in the active layers act as charge trapping sites, which degrades the JSC, FF, and Voc values of the devices. The increased recombination behavior after the post-annealing treatment was also verified by the J–V curves of the three different PSCs under dark conditions (Fig. 4c). The leakage current increased for all the devices after the post-annealing treatment compared to the fresh devices, likely due to the increased charge recombination.
Finally, we measured the UV–vis absorbance of the active layers in order to check whether MoO3 penetration affects exciton generation in the active layers. For this experiment, we deposited a MoO3 buffer layer on top of the active layers and measured the absorbance before and after 10 min of heating (Fig. S8†). The absorbance of the active layers was almost identical. From this experiment, we conclude that MoO3 penetration into the active layer predominantly affects the charge recombination behaviors in the devices, rather than exciton generation.
Consequently, a straightforward route for developing thermally stable PSCs is to prevent the diffusion of MoO3 molecules. To provide insights into circumventing this diffusion problem, we return to the point discussed in Fig. 2a. Remind that the onset temperatures where the devices begin to degrade during the 10 min post-annealing were different, i.e., ∼60 °C, ∼80 °C, and ∼100 °C for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs, PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F, and PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F PSCs, respectively. This result implies that MoO3 diffusion occurs at different temperatures depending on the materials used for device fabrication.
To clarify this point, we carried out additional post-annealing experiments at 80 °C (Fig. 5) and compared the thermal stability of the three different PSCs over a longer timeframe (>10 min). A heating temperature of 80 °C was chosen because it is the median of the onset temperatures for the three different materials systems, and it is reasonably high to reflect the temperature at which PSCs operate in real-life applications. More importantly, since the temperature is lower than TDs, the degradation of the PSCs at 80 °C is most likely due to MoO3 diffusion rather than morphological instabilities or electrode degradation. Indeed, the thermal stability at 80 °C varied depending on the material systems. For example, the PBDB-T-2Cl:ITIC-4F PSCs were found to be the most stable, followed by the PTB7-Th:ITIC-4F and PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs (Fig. 5). Overall, we note that the PSCs based on the ITIC-4F NFAs exhibit higher thermal stability than those of the fullerene-PSCs; from the polymer donor angle, the PSCs based on the PBDB-T-2Cl possess higher stability than that of the PSCs based on PTB7-Th. Therefore, these results indicate that MoO3 diffusion can be mitigated by judicious selection of donors and acceptors.

As for the selection of materials, we surmise that crystallinities and glass transition temperatures (Tgs) of donors and acceptors are two critical parameters that determine the MoO3 diffusion into the active layers. Previous works revealed that crystalline phases in the active layers are crucial for blocking water and oxygen penetration.59–61 Thus, the use of crystalline donors and acceptors enabled the fabrication of air-stable PSCs. The same idea should be applied to the MoO3 diffusion, that is, using crystalline donors and acceptors and the consequent formation of crystalline phases in the active layers should prevent MoO3 diffusion. More importantly, the crystalline phases should be preserved at elevated temperatures in order for PSCs to remain resistant to MoO3 diffusion. In this regard, we consider that high Tgs of donors and acceptors are desirable. Low Tg systems would allow the MoO3 diffusion through the evolving amorphous phases (or relaxation of molecular organization) at elevated temperatures. To verify whether our stability results are coherent with this hypothesis, we extracted the Tgs of the materials used in this study (or their analogs) from the literature elsewhere (Table S5†). Reportedly, the Tg of the amorphous PTB7-Th is ∼130 °C,62 while the Tgs of the paracrystalline PBDB-T-2Cl analogs are higher (∼130–180 °C).63 This accounts for generally higher thermal stabilities in the PBDB-T-2Cl-based PSCs. The Tg of PC71BM is ∼150 °C,64 while the Tgs of ITIC-4F is ∼185 °C.21 The higher Tgs of the ITIC-4F should be beneficial for blocking MoO3 diffusion. Therefore, the combination of PBDB-T-2Cl and ITIC-4F exhibited the best thermal stability compared to the others by minimizing the diffusion of MoO3 molecules.
Conclusions
In this work, we have systematically examined the thermal stability of NFA- and fullerene-PSCs using two different procedures, i.e., pre-annealing and post-annealing methods. We demonstrated that NFA-PSCs exhibiting excellent morphological stability can degrade significantly (by ∼30% within an hour) by the penetration of MoO3 molecules under thermal stress. The MoO3 molecules diffuse likely through the amorphous domains of photoactive layers, such that the accumulation of metal oxide impurities in the active layer leads to the formation of recombination centers. We suggest that this diffusion problem, and the resulting degradation of NFA-PSCs, can be solved by introducing or designing crystalline donors and acceptors with high Tgs. We also anticipate that incorporating proper polymeric or small molecular hole-transport layers instead of the MoO3 layer may also be another effective route for preventing metal oxide penetration. We believe that our work provides systematic steps for investigating the lifetime of PSCs and will serve as the groundwork for the development of highly efficient and thermally stable NFA-PSCs.
