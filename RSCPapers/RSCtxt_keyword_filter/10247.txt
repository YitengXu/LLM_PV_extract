    , Accepted 17th August 2012First published on 20th August 2012AbstractA thin solid-state photovoltaic cell of organic–inorganic hetero junctions was fabricated by forming a dye–metal charge-transfer complex as the sensitizer monolayer at the interface of crystalline state organic and inorganic semiconductors. The organic–inorganic hybrid thin-film photocell generates a high photovoltage of 1.2 V, yielding an energy conversion efficiency of up to 1.5%.
Recent progress of organic photovoltaic cells (PVs) demonstrates high performance of the cells that potentially surpasses the efficiency of thin film silicon PVs.1 Low-cost solution-printable fabrication is also a major advantage of organic PVs over the solid-state inorganic solar cells. High efficiency in solar energy conversion has been achieved by some of the dye-sensitized solar cells (12%)2,3 and thin organic film solar cells (9%).4 With spectral sensitivity covering the visible light region, these cells are capable of generating high density photocurrent (>15 mA cm−2) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) around 0.7–0.8 V under simulated sunlight intensity of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. Further improvement of efficiency will require extension of the spectral sensitivity region to increase current density and/or enhancement of photovoltage by minimizing the free energy gap of electron transfer, the latter is more than 0.5 V in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As for photovoltage, current studies of DSSC launched on testing a new range of Voc more than 0.9 V by use of a cobalt complex that works at more positive redox potentials to reduce the energy gap.3,5 Our previous trial of using bromide-based liquid electrolytes for DSSC in combination with inorganic sensitizers (quantum dots) coated on TiO2 achieved Voc more than 0.95 V.6 Replacing liquid electrolytes with organic hole conductors tends to achieve further high voltage as a result of reducing the loss in carrier transfers between dye and hole acceptor. Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-dimethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)7 and polythiophene families8 have been extensively employed for a hole transport layer in junction with organic dyes. Some of the solid-state DSSCs have succeeded in exhibiting high Voc exceeding 1 V.9 For further enhancement of the cell performance, there are still unexplored parts in material research. In all types of DSSCs, visible light absorption and electron excitation, the origin of photovoltage, are made by the sensitizer alone with little or no contribution of the semiconductor structure, typically, TiO2. In fabrication of solid-state DSSCs, organic conductors formed by the above bulky molecules often cause difficulty in developing high voltage by the influence of low conductivity due to the amorphous states.10 It is thus expected that combination of new photosensitive materials and high conductivity organic conductors will realise a photovoltaic interface that can work at even high voltage with sufficiently high current density. We discovered that a metal–dye charge-transfer complex of Ti and anthraquinone forms at the solid surface of TiO2 and it works as an excellent visible-light sensitizer of photoelectric conversion in junction with an organic hole conductor. Upon using a thin perylene film as a highly crystalline hole conductor, solid-state photovoltaic cells of the organic–inorganic hybrid structure generate photovoltages up to 1.2 V with power conversion efficiency exceeding 1.2%.
The photovoltaic layer was composed of a thin metal oxide semiconductor of TiO2 with a sensitizer monolayer which is chemically bound to its surface. The sensitized layer was made into junction with an organic semiconductor layer allowing for hole transport. Here, characteristically, the sensitizer is a hydroxyl-anthraquinone derivative, which is capable of coordinating to a transition metal ion (Ti4+) of TiO2. Such coordination bonds help to induce rectified and efficient charge transfer between metal and organic molecules leading to photocurrent generation. To ensure high hole mobility, a thin crystalline film of perylene was sequentially stacked on the sensitized layer by the vapor deposition method. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the photovoltaic cell and its constituent molecules. The total thickness of the hybrid photovoltaic layer was 1.1 μm.

A visible light-sensitive photoanode was prepared by coating a thin mesoporous TiO2 film (thickness, 1 μm) on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO, an ITO–SnO2 composite) surface of a glass substrate by screen printing of a nanocrystalline TiO2 paste followed by 500 °C sintering for 30 min. For sensitization, the TiO2 film was immersed in an ethanol solution of 1-amino-4-hydroxyanthraquinone (AQ) at 75 °C for 1 hour. This yielded a dark red-colored TiO2 film. AFM images of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2(a). The TiO2 surface was uniformly covered by AQ molecules. The AQ molecule is known to chelate with Ti4+ in a bidentate fashion by bonding of two oxygen atoms from quinone and hydroxyl groups.11 This differs from the conventional type of dye-sensitized solar cells where sensitizers, typically Ru complexes, are adsorbed to the oxide surface via carboxyl groups.12 AQ is assumed to coordinate as a ligand to Ti4+ forming a metal–ligand complex at the TiO2 surface. IR and Raman spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) support that new molecular orbitals appear in the AQ molecule as a result of complexation. Fig. 2(b) shows absorption spectra of AQ on TiO2 and in ethanol solution. While the ethanol solution shows absorption peaks at around 550 nm, originated from ππ* transitions, AQ on TiO2 exhibits a bathochromic shift to longer wavelength as a sign that the electronic state of AQ was changed by coordinating to Ti4+ in the TiO2 layer. Further, density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) slightly occurred between AQ and Ti4+ (Fig. S2, ESI†). The long wavelength absorption created by the Ti–AQ complex reinforces the light-harvesting ability of the sensitized layer.

Photovoltaic junctions were prepared by coating a 100 nm-thick hole transport layer (HTL), perylene, on the Ti–AQ surface by the vapor deposition method (2.0 × 10−5 Pa). An Au layer was deposited on the HTL as a counter electrode. Perylene exhibits a high hole mobility in the crystalline state.13 AFM images of the perylene film are shown in Fig. 3(a). The film was grown as a crystalline phase at a deposition rate of ∼0.1 Å s−1 and a substrate temperature of 100 °C, while an amorphous phase was obtained with rapid deposition of more than 5 Å s−1 at room temperature. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shown in Fig. 3(b), the crystalline phase of perylene is packed into a layer structure with a d-spacing of 10.2 Å. The 2D XRD profile (Fig. S3, ESI†) shows the same diffraction pattern of the layer structure in an out-of-plane direction. It also shows some diffractions in an in-plane direction, which are corresponding to the single crystal β-phase.14 In the β-phase of perylene, 2D intermolecular π–π interactions are formed along the (001) crystal plane (Fig. S4, ESI†) that corresponds to the carrier conductive direction.

Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the TiO2–AQ–HTL photovoltaic cells were measured under AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2) on a solar simulator. Three different cell configurations were compared for preparation of AQ and HTL. A reference cell, Cell 1, was prepared by vacuum-deposition of an AQ film on TiO2, a physical deposition method that allows none of the coordination bonding of AQ. The other reference cell, Cell 2, was prepared with the coordinated AQ film while HTL was coated as an amorphous film of perylene. Cell 3 followed the present method of chemical coordination (AQ) and crystalline phase deposition (perylene). J–V characteristics obtained are summarized in Table 1. Cell 1 exhibited a poor J–V performance with small photocurrents. Cell 2 was capable of generating 0.77 V with improved photocurrent density but yielded low power conversion efficiency (<0.05%). In contrast, photovoltaic performance was remarkably increased in the Cell 3 configuration.

A large increase in photocurrent (3 orders of magnitude) results from AQ coordination with Ti4+ on the metal oxide surface. High efficiency in electron injection is assumed to be due to LMCT of the excited Ti–AQ complex. The Ti–AQ photoanode is coupled with HTL whose solid-state properties strongly affect carrier transport and cell performance.15 Perylene HTL prepared in crystalline phase was found to significantly enhance the photocurrent density (10 times) and photovoltage (53%) as a result of increased hole conductivity over the amorphous phase (Cell 2). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4(a). The cell outputs an impressive high open-circuit voltage Voc of 1.18 V, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 1.22% under an incident power of 100 mW cm−2. The same cell has 1.48% efficiency at a lower incident power of 25 mW cm−2. This reflects a high internal resistance of the cell as reflected by a low fill factor.

Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is exhibited in Fig. 4(b). Its action spectrum covers a wavelength range extended to >700 nm following the optical absorption of the Ti–AQ complex. This shows that the photon to electron conversion was caused by the LMCT absorption band of the Ti–AQ complex. An additional peak at 400 nm is assumed to reflect the photoresponse intrinsic to perylene in the HTL, which also contributes, in the short-wavelength region, to photovoltaic generation as a p-type conductor. Based on the optical absorption of the Ti–AQ photoelectrode, which was as high as 30% at 500–550 nm, and the maximum IPCE of 8% (500–550 nm), internal quantum conversion efficiency (APCE) due to Ti–AQ was estimated to be around 35%. This result indicates that there is still inefficiency in quantum conversion through the photo-excited LMCT at the Ti–AQ coordination layer and implies occurrence of charge recombination at the inorganic and organic interfaces.
A schematic energy diagram for the solid-state TiO2/Ti–AQ/HTL hybrid photovoltaic cells is depicted in Fig. 5. Based on the HOMO and LUMO levels of Ti–AQ and perylene films, determined by optical absorption edges and photoemission spectroscopy (Fig. S5, ESI†), the excited state of Ti–AQ is located higher than the TiO2 conduction band and the valence band of the solid-state perylene HTL is situated near −5.4 eV. Here, open-circuit voltage, Voc, corresponds to a gap (1.2 eV) between the TiO2 conduction band and the relatively low HOMO level of solid-state perylene, which agrees with the measured Voc, 1.18 V. In electron transfer, formation of the Ti–AQ complex at the TiO2 surface is assumed to promote electron injection from AQ to the TiO2 conduction band. The rectified electron transfer at the interfaces of TiO2/AQ and AQ/HTL, however, may undergo recombination loss due to relatively low potential slopes (0.4 V) between the donors and acceptors.

The hybrid cell is compared with solid-state DSSCs which employ inorganic hole conductors such as CuI16 and CsSnI3.17 Despite lower photovoltage (<0.75 V), these cells are more efficient in power generation than the present cell due to high photocurrent density. Clearly, our photoelectrode should be improved to enhance light harvesting ability that increases current density. It is now underway to increase photon collection performance by way of preparing a mesoscopic TiO2 network of high surface area and LMCT complexes absorbing in longer wavelengths.
