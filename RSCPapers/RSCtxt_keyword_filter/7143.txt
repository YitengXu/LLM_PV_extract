    , Accepted 20th November 2015First published on 20th November 2015AbstractA series of novel A1–A–A1 type small molecules (SMs) of BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP were designed and synthesized, in which benzodi(pyridothiophene) (BDPT) was used as a novel weak central acceptor (A) unit, and benzothiadiazole (BT), fluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) were used as terminal acceptor (A1) units, respectively. The pentacyclic BDPT aromatic unit can form big conjugated and planar SMs with the A1 unit, resulting in enhanced π–π stacking and crystallinity. The effect of the A1 unit on the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of three SMs was observed. The broader absorption spectrum, lower HOMO energy level, higher photo-response efficiency and better photovoltaic properties were exhibited for BDPT-2DPP. A maximum PCE of 3.97% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 9.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52.37% was obtained in the BDPT-2DPP/PC71BM-based solar cells, which is 1.8 and 1.5 times the values of the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT-based cells, respectively.
1. Introduction
For developing high-efficiency organic photovoltaics (OPVs), in the past few years, many building blocks of benzodithiophene, fluorene, carbazole, thienopyrrolodione, quinoxaline, diketopyrrolopyrrole, benzothiadiazole and isoindigo have been widely used to construct photovoltaic donor materials.1–10 The modification and improvement of these building blocks, such as fluorination, atom substitution, fused ring-expending, side chain engineering and so on, have been found to promote the photovoltaic performance for their polymers and small molecules.11–18 Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.7%19 and 10.1%20 for OPVs based on polymers (P-OPVs) and small molecules (SM-OPVs) have been achieved, respectively.
Among these building blocks, the lactam derivatives were mostly reported as acceptor units in photovoltaic materials owing to their strong electron-withdrawing ability for forming the intramolecular donor–acceptor electron transfer and the relatively strong interaction between amide groups and fullerenes for efficient charge carrier separation.21–23 As a result, polymers bearing lactam units have shown excellent photovoltaic performance in P-OPVs. For instance, Marks et al. reported a series of bithiopheneimide (BTI)-based polymers and presented a maximum PCE of 6.41% for their OPVs.21 The Ding group designed a new pentacyclic aromatic lactam (TPTI) as the acceptor unit and exhibited a PCE of 7.80% for the TPTI-based polymer in OPVs.23
As lactam with ambident reactivity is easily functionalized by N- or O-alkylation, Kroon et al. recently presented an isomer of the tetracyclic lactam (NT) building block by O-alkylation, which is also regarded as a pyridine derivative, and its copolymer showed a PCE of 5% in OPVs.24 Liu et al. developed a thiophene-fused aza-coronene (TAC) unit with a bigger conjugate and planar system and its copolymer with a mobility up to 0.028 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a PCE of 4.8% in the inverted device.25 Both fused heterocyclic building blocks of NT and TAC have low electron-withdrawing ability because of the effect of the nitrogen atom with sp2 hybridization in the fused-pyridine rings, which help its copolymers achieve deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and its OPV devices to obtain high open circuit voltage (Voc). Furthermore, these copolymers containing NT and TAC units have remarkable self-organization behavior, which promotes their OPV devices to exhibit a high fill factor (FF). However, these OPV devices have not exhibited satisfactory short circuit density (Jsc) and PCE values. This is considered to be related to the relatively narrow absorption spectra of these copolymers. Thus, the broader UV-vis absorption spectra with low band-gap and suitable energy levels are needed for the copolymers.
SM-OPVs have many advantages, such as well-defined structures, easier purification, and less batch to batch variation, as compared to P-OPVs. In this work, we focused on a multi-heterocyclic building block to construct novel photovoltaic small molecules with broad UV-vis absorption spectra and suitable energy levels. Herein, a novel penta-heterocyclic building block of benzodi(pyridothiophene) (BDPT), i.e. thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrido[2,3-g]thieno[3,2-c]quinoline (Fig. 1) was designed and synthesized via Bischler–Napieralski cyclization. In consideration of the intrinsic relatively low HOMO energy level of the pyridine derivative and the requirement of broad absorption spectra for photovoltaic SMs, a series of A1–A–A1 type SMs of BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP were designed and synthesized, in which BDPT was used as a weak central acceptor (A) unit and benzothiadiazole (BT), fluorinated benzothiadiazole (FBT), and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) were used as the second strong acceptor (A1) unit, respectively. In this case, the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these SMs can be tuned with the second acceptor unit. As expected, these three SMs showed enhanced π–π stacking and crystallinity, as well as relatively low HOMO energy levels. BDPT-2DPP exhibited a broader absorption spectrum, lower HOMO energy level, higher photo-response efficiency and better photovoltaic property in contrast to BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT. A maximum PCE of 3.97% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 9.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52.37% was obtained in the BDPT-2DPP/PC71BM-based solar cells. Our results demonstrated that benzodi(pyridothiophene) is a promising building block to construct photovoltaic SMs for potential application in solution-processed SM-OPVs.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. All reagents and solvents were purchased from Adamas, and Sigma and Aldrich corporations. These chemicals were used without further purification unless stated otherwise. Compounds 2–7 and 9–11 were prepared according to the reported procedures.26–29
2.2. Measurement and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer at 400 MHz and 100 MHz using CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard unless specified otherwise, respectively. Mass spectra were measured on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF analyzer using the MALDI-TOF mode. Crystal-structures were determined on a Nonius KCCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo K radiation. The structures were analyzed by direct methods (SHELXS-97). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was measured on a Perkin-Elmer Diamond TG/DTA thermal analyzer at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was measured on a TA DSCQ-10 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was conducted on a CHI620 voltammetric analyzer under an argon atmosphere in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of tetra(n-butyl) ammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. A platinum plate, a platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. SMs were coated on the surface of the platinum plate and all potentials were corrected against Fc/Fc+.
2.3. Device fabrication and characterization
All devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates, which were cleaned by ultrasonic wave with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, for 20 min. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios™ P Al 4083) was spin-coated onto ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 30 s and baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The solution of SM and PC71BM in chloroform (12 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to form the active layer. The thickness of the active layer was approximately 90 nm, measured by a KLA Tencor D-120 profilometer. Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited successively on the active layer by thermal evaporation under a vacuum less than 2 × 10−6 mbar. The active area was 4 mm2 for each cell. Current density (J)–voltage (V) curves were performed on a Newport 150 W solar simulator under AM1.5G illumination with irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured on a QE-R3011 solar spectral response measurement system (Enli Technology).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
The synthetic route of three SMs is shown in Scheme 1. Compound 7 was reacted with 2-hexyldecanoyl chloride in a mixing solvent of THF and Et3N at 0 °C to give compound 8 with a moderate yield of 63%. The key intermediate of BDPT was obtained by a reaction between compound 8 and condensation reagents P2O5 and POCl3 with a yield of 77%, which is called a Bischler–Napieralski cyclization. The structure of BDPT was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. M1 was synthesized from BDPT in the presence of n-BuLi and Me3SnCl at −78 °C. The target SMs BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP were synthesized via a Still coupling reaction of M1 and compounds 9, 10, and 11 with yields over 70%. The structures of these target SMs were characterized by 1H NMR, MS, and elemental analysis.

3.2. Crystal structure of BDPT
A single crystal of BDPT was grown by slow diffusion of MeOH into the concentrated BDPT solution in CHCl3. The crystal structure of BDPT was determined and the crystallographic data are provided in the ESI.† CCDC 1412263. As observed, BDPT belongs to the P space group of the triclinic system with α = 84.894°, β = 88.701°, and γ = 72.509°. As shown in Fig. 1, BDPT exhibits good planarity and π–π stacking with a distance of 3.468 Å, which will promote charge transfer when used as a building block in photovoltaic materials.
3.3. Thermal properties
The thermal behavior of three BDPT-based SMs was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement. Fig. 2a and b show the recorded TGA and DSC curves, respectively. The detailed data are outlined in Table S1 (ESI†). As depicted in Fig. 2a, the decomposition temperature (Td) at 447 °C, 451 °C and 423 °C are observed for BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP at 5% weight loss, respectively. These high Td values may originate from the relatively high crystallinity and intermolecular interaction. On the other hand, an endothermic peak under the heating process and an exothermic peak under the cooling process are observed for the three BDPT-based SMs in Fig. 2b, which correspond to the melting temperature (Tm) and crystallization temperature (Tc), respectively. By comparison, it is found that both BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP exhibited significantly increased Tm and Tc than BDPT-2BT. Therefore, introducing an F atom and changing the second acceptor from a BT to a DPP unit have a significantly positive influence on thermal stability and crystallinity.

3.4. Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of BDPT-based SMs in chloroform solution (10−5 M) and in their thin films are shown in Fig. 3. The detailed data are outlined in Table 1. Two distinct absorption bands at a high-lying region from 300–400 nm and a low-lying region from 400–700 nm are observed for these BDPT-based SMs in solution and solid state. An absorption maximum is displayed at 492 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 7.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for the BDPT-2BT solution and at 482 nm with a ε value of 1.02 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for the BDPT-2FBT solution. Compared to BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT shows a clear blue-shifted absorption profile in solution and solid state due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atom.30 When the BT unit is replaced by the DPP unit in the BDPT-based SMs, BDPT-2DPP shows a broader absorption profile than BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT, due to the stronger electron-deficient ability of DPP than BT and FBT, which results in the stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. The absorption maximum appears at 600 nm, with an increasing ε value of 8.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for BDPT-2DPP in solution. In contrast to the absorption profiles in solution, those in the neat films for these three BDPT-based SMs are remarkably red-shifted by about 60 nm due to the strong inter-molecular interactions. Furthermore, a new shoulder peak occurs in the long-wavelength for the three BDPT-based SMs, which results from vibronic coupling due to the rigid planar conjugated structure enforced by the molecular packing. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) estimated from the absorption edges (652 nm, 630 nm, and 710 nm) of the thin films are 1.90, 1.97 and 1.75 eV for BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP, respectively. As observed, the Eoptg values of this kind of SMs were governed by the electron-deficient ability of the second acceptor units.

3.5. Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the BDPT-based SMs were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. The resulting CV curves are shown in Fig. 4 and their detailed data are summarized in Table 1. The reversible oxidation waves are observed with the onset oxidation potentials (Eox) of 1.01 V, 1.18 V and 1.07 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode for BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP, respectively. However, the reductive waves did not appear. As the potential of the Fc/Fc+vs. Ag/AgCl electrode was measured to be 0.43 V in this work, the HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) of the BDPT-based SMs can be calculated by the following equation: EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.37) eV.31 As a result, the EHOMO values of BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP are −5.38 eV, −5.55 eV and −5.44 eV, respectively. Therefore, turning the second acceptor unit from BT to FBT and DPP can make their SMs exhibit lower HOMO energy levels.

3.6. Theoretical calculation
Optimal conformations of the three BDPT-based SMs were obtained by molecular modelling on Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory in the gas phase. To minimize the calculation process, the long alkyl chains were substituted with methyl groups during the calculation. The optimized molecular geometries are depicted in Fig. 5. The backbone of three SMs displays good planarity with a small torsion angle of 2.01°, 2.65° and 0.91° between the strong acceptor unit (BT, FBT and DPP) and the center BDPT unit for BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP, respectively. The resulting planar structure can facilitate π–π stacking and charge transfer. The calculated frontier orbital distribution of the HOMO and the LUMO for SMs are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). For BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT, the HOMOs are well delocalized along the backbones of SMs, while the LUMOs are localized on the second acceptors of the BT and FBT units. However, both HOMO and LUMO are delocalized along the backbones for BDPT-2DPP. As the localization can hinder interchain electron transport, since hopping requires good alignment of the localized LUMO levels,32–35 the stronger delocalization of both the HOMO and LUMO for BDPT-2DPP is expected to enhance intermolecular interactions and improve charge transportation than those for BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT.

3.7. Photovoltaic properties
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on SMs and PC71BM were fabricated. The SM/PC71BM ratios from 1:2, 1:1 to 2:1 and the solvent additive of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) from 0% to 1% were selected to optimize device performance in the active layer. Table S2 (ESI†) summarized the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the SM/PC71BM-based devices under illumination of AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding J–V curves and the dark currents in the J–V curves for BDPT-based solar cells were displayed in Fig. S2–S4 (ESI†). It is found that the optimized SM/PC71BM ratio is 1:1. The introduction of the 1% DIO additive improves the photovoltaic properties of the BDPT-2DPP-based devices, but decreases the photovoltaic properties of the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT-based devices. Fig. 6 shows the typical J–V curves of the SM:PC71BM-based devices in this optimized SM/PC71BM ratio and solvent additive conditions. We find that the BDPT-2DPP-based devices exhibited better photovoltaic properties than the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT-based devices. The maximum PCE of 3.09% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 8.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52.37% was obtained in the BDPT-2DPP-based devices at the SM/PC71BM ratio of 1:1. It indicates that turning the second acceptor unit from BT to FBT and DPP can improve the photo-voltaic property for these A1–A–A1 type SMs.

For further tuning photovoltaic properties of this type of SMs with an A1–A–A1 framework, the BDPT-2DPP-based device with the BDPT-2DPP/PC71BM ratio of 1.5:1 and 1% DIO additive was specially made. The increasing PCE of 3.97% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 9.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52.37% was obtained in the cell. The corresponding J–V curve is also shown in Fig. 6. The improved photovoltaic data of three SM-based devices at optimized process conditions are finally summarized in Table 2. It shows that the PCE value of the BDPT-2DPP-based device is 1.5 times the value of the BDPT-2FBT-based device.

The measurement of X-ray diffraction, photo response efficiency and hole mobility further supports why the BDPT-2DPP-based device presented the best photovoltaic properties among these A1–A–A1 type SM-based devices. Fig. 7 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the SM:PC71BM blend films with/without DIO additive. A clear and intense diffraction peak is observed in the BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP blend films, while the BDPT-2BT blend film displays a weak diffraction peak around 2θ = 5°, which is ascribed to the diffraction between the molecular conjugated backbones separated by the branched alkyl chains. It implies that BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP have better crystallinity and self-organization than BDPT-2BT, which is consistent with the DSC results. When 1% DIO additive was added into the SM:PC71BM blend films, the diffraction peaks disappeared for BDPT-2BT, weakened for BDPT-2FBT and were enhanced for BDPT-2DPP in their blend films. This indicates that the organized nano-structure was disarranged in the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT blend films with 1% DIO additive, which resulted in the reduced PCE value. In contrast, a more ordered nano-structure was formed in the BDPT-2DPP blend film with 1% DIO additive. As a result, adding 1% DIO additive can significantly increase PCE and Jsc values of the BDPT-2DPP-based device.
 Fig. 7  X-ray diffraction patterns of the SM/PC71BM blend films with/without 1% DIO at optimized blend ratio. 
The influence of 1% DIO additive on the film morphologies was further investigated in these blend films at the optimized ratio between the SM and PC71BM by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 8, BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT-based blend films display homogeneous morphologies, but the BDPT-2DPP-based blend film reveals serious phase separation morphology without DIO additive. In contrast, when 1% DIO is added, an inhomogeneous morphology and a severe phase-segregation phenomenon are observed in the blend films with BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT. However, homogeneous morphology with cloud-like structure appears in the BDPT-2DPP-based blend film under 1% DIO additive. Therefore, adding 1% DIO additive can improve the morphology of the BDPT-2DPP-based blend film, but destroy the homogeneousness of the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT-based blend films. In general, the inhomogeneous morphology for the photo-active layer may cause more geminate recombination and bimolecular recombination, which can decrease the Jsc value of the device . Proper phase separation and an interpenetrating network are beneficial for exciton separation and charge transport, which can promote the Jsc value of the device . This is why the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT-based devices exhibited decreased photovoltaic performances, but the BDPT-2DPP-based devices presented improved ones by adding the DIO additive.

The scale bars represent 200 nm. 

Fig. 9 and 10 show the EQE curves of three SM:PC71BM blend films and the J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices with the SM:PC71BM-based active layer, respectively. Although a similar photo response region from 300 to 650 nm is exhibited for the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT blend films, their photo response efficiencies are remarkably different. The highest EQE values of 37.5% and 45.9% are exhibited in the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT blend films, respectively. In comparison, BDPT-2DPP showed a broader photo response region from 300 to 710 nm with a highest EQE value of 50.6%. These calculated Jsc values by integration of the EQE data have only a 2–5% mismatch compared with the Jsc values from the J–V curve. This indicates that the photoelectron conversion process is more efficient for the BDPT-2DPP-based device, which is responsible for the increase in Jsc.

Fig. 10 displays J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices in the dark, in which the device structure is ITO/PEDOT/SM:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. The hole mobility was measured using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole mobilities of 2.94 × 10−6, 1.66 × 10−5 and 1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 are presented for BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP, respectively. It is obvious that the hole mobility of BDPT-2DPP increases by one order of magnitude compared with that of BDPT-2FBT, which is consistent with the improvement in Jsc and FF for the BDPT-2DPP-based device.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, three novel A1–A–A1 type SMs of BDPT-2BT, BDPT-2FBT and BDPT-2DPP were obtained, which contain a weak and a strong electron-withdrawing acceptor unit. All of them exhibited good planarity and crystallinity, as well as low HOMO energy levels. Therein, BDPT-2DPP showed a broader absorption spectrum and higher photo response efficiency than BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT. A maximum PCE of 3.97% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 9.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52.37% was obtained in the BDPT-2DPP/PC71BM-based device. This PCE value is 1.8 and 1.5 times that of the BDPT-2BT and BDPT-2FBT-based devices, respectively. Our work demonstrates that BDPT is a promising weak electron-withdrawing building block for the design of photovoltaic SMs. Changing the second acceptor unit from BT to DPP can significantly improve the photovoltaic property for the A1–A–A1 type SMs.
