The developed photoelectrodes exhibited tremendous efficiency towards anodic oxidation of hydrous hydrazine with continuous and stable hydrogen evolution at the Pt cathode under benign pH and zero bias conditions. Significantly, the photofuel cell containing hydrazine hydrate fuel has generated electricity with a high open circuit potential of 0.8 V. The presence of bicarbonate ions in the electrolyte has played a significant role in enhancing the kinetics of photoelectrochemical oxidation of hydrazine and improved the hydrogen and electricity generation efficiency thus avoiding the integration of an oxidation electrocatalyst. In addition, molybdenum doped BiVO4 as a possible photoelectrochemical hydrazine sensor has been investigated and the electrode photocurrent was found to be linearly dependent on the concentration of the hydrazine hydrate in the range of 20–90 mM with a correlation coefficient of 0.9936.
Introduction
Hydrazine and its derivatives are excellent reducing agents and have a wide range of applications in industry and agriculture as explosives, antioxidants, photographic developer, oxygen scavengers, pesticides, and plant-growth regulators.1–8 These anthropogenic practices are the basis for inadvertent discharge of hydrazine based chemicals into the environment. Specifically, hydrazine has been utilized as rocket fuel and as a result a significant amount of hydrazine waste is liberated. For example, Kennedy Space Center (KSC) produces several thousand gallons of diluted hydrazine waste per year.9 Significant amounts of methylhydrazine/hydrazine were found in National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) wastewater.10 On the other hand, the toxicity of hydrazine can be reduced by using harmless hydrazone or hydrazide, which releases hydrazine hydrate in contact with a solvent.11 International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) report classified carcinogenic risk of hydrazine hydrate as class 2B which it is equivalent to gasoline. Therefore, safe handling guidelines comparable to that of gasoline are required for hydrazine hydrate fuel.12 Besides, many government and academic institutions are investigating the possible use of hydrazine as a carbon neutral energy carrier for fuel cells over the past few decades.13–16 The Governmental Industrial Research Institute, OSAKA (GRICO, now known as the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Kansai), and Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd, investigated a hydrazine-air fuel cell vehicle and driving experiments were also carried out.17 With the consideration of hydrazine as an alternative to hydrogen fuel for the development of fuel cell electric vehicles, and the technology being closer to commercial application, hydrazine production and consequent waste generation are expected to increase further.16 This necessitates the need for the development of treatment and sensing method for hydrazine. Besides, hydrazine hydrate has a high energy density of 3.5 W h cm−3.14 Unlike the hydrocarbon based fuels, hydrazine hydrate (H2NNH2·H2O) has no carbon atoms and would not contribute to increased CO2 levels upon decomposition.18 Therefore, the development of alternative cost-effective methods that not only treats the hydrazine hydrate wastewater but also ingeniously generates energy using sustainable energy resources comes out to be an attractive and effective approach. However, the current direct methods for the decomposition of hydrazine hydrate and simultaneous hydrogen generation use expensive bimetallic alloy catalysts based on nickel and a noble metal (Rh, Pt and Ir).19–21 For instance, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell consisting of an inexpensive oxide semiconductor photoelectrode that can harvest solar energy and exert photogenerated charge carriers for hydrazine decomposition and for hydrogen generation from H+ at the counter electrode could be a potential approach as it employs a renewable energy resource. This sustainable treatment approach and end use can reduce economic and environmental costs. It is a liquid over a wide range of temperatures (213–392 K)22 and can be employed in cold regions as it has a freezing temperature of −51.7 °C.23 At concentrations less than 60%, hydrazine hydrate is not flammable and is less volatile than alcohol fuels and thus reduces air emission.12 Therefore, hydrazine hydrate wastewater can also be effectively employed as fuel in photofuel cells for electricity generation while decomposing hydrazine hydrate. Recently, the fullerene-pthalocyanine-based organic p–n bilayer system has been employed as a photoelectrode in a biased twin compartment alkaline-acidic bipolar electrolyte based PEC cell for simultaneous decomposition of hydrazine and hydrogen generation.24 There are few standing issues for these cells. First, the operation of this cell with alkaline-acidic bipolar electrolyte in anodic and cathodic compartments may lead to the crossover of H+ and OH− ions and consequent electrolyte consumption. Second, employing expensive fullerenes as electrode materials increases the overall cost of this technology. Third, the cell has poor conversion efficiency and generated low photocurrent densities upon the decomposition of hydrazine. These observations suggest that the development of an inexpensive, stable photoelectrode that operates at zero bias and benign pH conditions for the PEC decomposition of hydrazine and simultaneous production of hydrogen (in PECs) and electricity (in photofuel cells, PFCs) is strongly desired. This study demonstrates the application of a highly efficient and stable Mo-doped BiVO4, a visible light active photoanode for the photooxidation of hydrazine allowing the production of (i) hydrogen in PECs and (ii) electricity in PFCs. In addition, the possibility of molybdenum doped BiVO4 as a photoelectrochemical hydrazine sensor has been investigated.
The 2 atom% Mo-doped BiVO4 (BiMo0.02V0.98O4) film photoelectrode was prepared using the spray pyrolysis method. The stability of the BiMo0.02V0.98O4 photoelectrode towards hydrazine hydrate oxidation was studied under neutral pH and zero bias conditions. Furthermore, the effect of electrolyte on the conversion of hydrazine hydrate to hydrogen and electricity in PECs and PFCs, respectively, has been investigated. The study explored the possibility of BiMo0.02V0.98O4 as visible light active PEC hydrazine hydrate.
Experimental section
The BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 on F-doped SnO2 overlayer (FTO) thin film photoelectrodes employed in this study was prepared by a spray deposition method. The precursor solution for the deposition of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 film was obtained from a mixture of solutions of Bi + V and Mo. Specifically, two separate solutions of Bi and V were prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (98% Alfa Aesar) in acetic acid (98% Sigma Aldrich) and VO(AcAc)2 (98%, Alfa Aesar) in 95% ethanol. The bismuth precursor solution was then added to the vanadium solution, and then the mixture was diluted to 8 mM with excess ethanol. To prepare BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 films, a stoichiometric amount of MoCl5 (99.6%, Alfa Aesar) dissolved in ethanol was added to the precursor solution of Bi and V, resulting in a solution comprising Bi/(V + Mo) in a 1:1 ratio. The obtained solution was spray coated onto a FTO plate (TEC 8, Pelkington) that was subjected through three successive 20 min ultrasonic cleaning treatments in DI water, ethanol and acetone, respectively. The FTO plates maintained at 350 °C were sprayed with the precursor solution. A layer of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 film was deposited by spraying the precursor solution onto the substrate from a carrier gas of nitrogen (pressure, 0.6 bar) at a distance of 20 cm from the hot plate. A spray of 5 s was followed by a break of 55 s to allow for the pyrolysis of the newly sprayed layer and to reduce the temperature losses in the substrate. This process was continued until the desired number of BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 layers (typically 100 cycles) had been deposited. The as-deposited films were further subjected to annealing at 550 °C for 2 h in air to enhance the crystallinity. In order to compare the PEC performance characteristics of BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO, an undoped BiVO4/FTO photoelectrode was prepared by following the above procedure with a Bi:V ratio of 1:1.
The crystal structure of the as synthesized BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO electrodes was determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern collected using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-2400 UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer. BaSO4 was employed as the reflectance standard. The surface morphology of the as-synthesized BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO electrodes was studied using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained using a PHI 5600 model X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) equipped with a monochromatic Al anode (1486.6 eV). The spectrometer was calibrated to the Ag 3d5/2 line at 368.27 ± 0.05 eV. The XPS spectra were recorded at 14 kV and 300 W with an analysis area of 800 μm2. The survey spectra were acquired at a pass energy of 29.35 eV and the high resolution spectra were collected by narrow scans at 23.95 eV. Spectra were charge corrected using the adventitious C1s line at 284.6 eV. The photocurrent action spectra were collected through a setup consisting of a 100 W tungsten lamp with a Photon Technology International (PTI) LPS-220 lamp power supply and an EG&G model 263A potentiostat/galvanostat (Princeton Applied Research). Light from the PTI SIF-101 monochromator was chopped, and an optical filter was employed to block any second-order diffraction. The signal was detected using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier using the chopping frequency as a reference. A thermopile detector was located in the place of an electrochemical cell to measure the spectral output of the lamp and the monochromator. The voltage output from the thermopile is proportional to the incident power and it was plotted vs. photon energy. To obtain the photon flux from this plot, the photocurrent signal at each wavelength was divided by the energy (eV) of that wavelength. The semiconductor photocurrent spectrum was divided by the photon flux spectra to get a normalized spectrum. The photoelectrode was held at 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and the photocurrent at each wavelength was measured in order to obtain a photocurrent action spectrum.
The PEC response of the photoelectrodes was obtained by illuminating the PEC cell using a 300 W Xenon (Newport) quartz lamp. A 55 mm diameter water filled filter was placed in the beam path between light and the PEC cell to avoid the heating up of the solution due to IR radiation and the output light intensity of light passing through the AM 1.5 G filter was set to 100 mW cm−2, measured using a Newport thermopile sensor 919P-003-10. The PEC measurements were carried out under ambient conditions in a three-electrode cell with a flat glass window using a Gamry® Ref 600 potentiostat interfaced with a computer. BiVO4/FTO or BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO was employed as the working electrode, and Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) were employed as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (pH 7) or 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) was employed as the electrolyte for the PEC measurements. Dynamic chopped light and steady state linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were scanned in the anodic direction at a scan rate of 15 mV s−1. The electrochemical EIS measurements were conducted by applying a sinusoidal perturbation of ±10 mV, at a constant electrode potential of 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under AM 1.5 light in a 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 7) electrolyte and over frequencies from 10000 to 0.01 Hz. A PFC was constructed using the two chamber PEC reactor with a Nafion® membrane separator. The PFC was filled with either 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7) or 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 7) aqueous solutions having different concentrations of hydrazine hydrate in the anodic compartment under constant stirring. The cathode compartment contained a Pt wire counter electrode in either 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7) or in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 7) aqueous solutions. The distance between the anode and the cathode was 10 cm.
Results and discussion
The crystal structure of the annealed BiVO4/FTO and BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrodes was analyzed by XRD analysis (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of BiMo0.02V0.98O4/FTO (a), BiVO4/FTO (b), and FTO substrate (c) electrodes. 
The XRD pattern of BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO shown in Fig. 1a exhibited strong peaks originating from the FTO substrate (Fig. 1c) along with the diffraction peaks of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 films. The BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 films exhibited diffraction peaks purely corresponding to that of the monoclinic scheelite type structure (JCPDS Card no. 14-0688) indicating the absence of impurity phases.25 The peak pattern is indistinguishable from that of pure BiVO4 (Fig. 1b) indicating that the molybdenum incorporation has not altered the crystal structure of BiVO4. As seen in Fig. 2a, the optical absorption spectrum of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrodes exhibited absorption in the visible light region (from 380–530 nm).

The steep rise in the absorption profile of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 film in the visible region is attributed to the transition at the band gap. The absorption tail extended further to a longer wavelength of 750 nm. The existence of oxygen vacancies in the BiVO4 structure has been attributed to the extended absorption in the visible region.26,27 In the case of bulk Mo-doped BiVO4, the Mo atoms prefer to occupy the vanadium sites but in contrast, they prefer to occupy the Bi sites on the surface. Ding et al. have performed electronic structure calculations and proved that the lower formation energy is the cause for preferential occupation of Bi sites by Mo atoms particularly at the surface. In this case, Mo–O bonds shrink and ensue the elongation of Bi–O bonds, the original coordinated O atoms shifts towards the doping sites and creates the oxygen vacancies.28 The band gap of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode was determined from the photocurrent action spectrum and it was found to be 2.35 eV (Fig. S1, ESI†). The Raman spectrum of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode is shown in Fig. 2b. The most intense feature seen at 826 cm−1 with a shoulder at 717 cm−1 is due to the anti-symmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the VO4 tetrahedral, respectively. The bending modes of VO4 tetrahedral are evident from the peaks at 325 cm−1 and 366 cm−1. The Raman peaks at 129 cm−1 and 211 cm−1 are attributed to the vibration of the crystal lattice. The vibrational modes of BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode films are in good agreement with the monoclinic scheelite BiVO4.29–31 The as-synthesized BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 films produced by the spray pyrolysis method exhibited good adhesion. Typical SEM images of the representative BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrodes are shown in Fig. 3 at various magnifications.

The SEM images obtained for BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrodes show the presence of highly porous morphology. The photoelectrode consisted of several interconnected grains with sizes ranging between 150–450 nm. The existence of porous morphology helps to enhance the overall PEC efficiency by improving the depletion layer volume and the charge collection at the electrolyte interface.32,33 The representative SEM images of undoped BiVO4 are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The morphologies of BiVO4 and BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 films are very similar and this indicates that molybdenum incorporation does not affect the morphology of the BiVO4 electrode. It is important to realize the nature of the catalytic active sites that are present on the surface of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrodes in order to design an efficient photoelectrode with an optimum performance for PEC water splitting application. XPS analysis was performed to get additional insights into the actual composition and chemical states of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrodes at the surface. The high resolution XPS spectra of the Bi 4f, V 2p, and Mo 3d binding energy regions for the representative BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO sample are shown in Fig. 4.

The characteristic orbital splitting peaks located at 164.7 and 159.4 eV originating from Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2 respectively confirm the presence of Bi3+. The split peaks located at 523.9 and 516.9 eV corresponding to that of V2p1/2 and Vp2p3/2 orbits respectively indicate the presence of pentavalent V.34 In addition, two characteristic peaks positioned at 232.5 and 235.5 eV originating from Mo3d5/2 and Mo3d3/2 signals respectively are assigned to the +6 oxidation state, confirming the presence of Mo6+ in the BiVO4 lattice.33,35 XPS characterization along with XRD analysis confirms the presence of the monoclinic scheelite phase of BiVO4.36
It is important to evaluate the onset potential and the photocurrent density to assess the performance of a photoanode. The effects of doped molybdenum on the photocurrent generation of the spray deposited BiVO4 photoelectrodes were investigated by examining the PEC response of the BiVO4/FTO and BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrodes in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) electrolyte. Typical photocurrent vs. potential responses under chopped light illumination are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Both BiVO4/FTO and BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrodes exhibited anodic photocurrents upon illumination in 0.1 M phosphate (pH 7) buffer solution representing their n-type character and their ability for water oxidation. The BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode generated an enhanced photocurrent (0.20 mA cm−2 at 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) compared to that of undoped BiVO4 photoelectrode (0.05 mA cm−2 at 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in phosphate buffer electrolyte. This specifies that photo-induced charge carrier separation is effectively enhanced in the case of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode when compared to the undoped BiVO4/FTO photoelectrode. Molybdenum atoms have relatively more electrons than that of vanadium atoms. The introduction of molybdenum as a dopant into the vanadium sites of the BiVO4 host crystal lattice provides extra electrons and enhances the electron density.37 This raises the Fermi level, and the impurity levels will act as donor levels.28 Based on the electronic structure calculations, it has been shown that the incorporation of molybdenum in a small percentage does not change the band gap but reduces the effective mass of holes, implying a higher mobility of the photo-generated carriers.38 This improves the participation of charge carriers in the redox reactions effectively and consequently reduces the charge carrier recombination. Thus, the doping of BiVO4 with molybdenum can significantly improve the charge carrier separation and improves the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4.
In a hydrazine hydrate free electrolyte, the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO in NaHCO3 electrolyte (0.33 mA cm−2) showed 130 μA cm−2 improvement in the photocurrent density over phosphate buffer electrolyte (0.20 mA cm−2) at 0.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (Fig. 5A). When hydrazine hydrate (100 mM) was added to the electrolyte, significant enhancement in the photocurrent density was observed in both electrolytes (Fig. 5B). With an increase in applied voltage, the photoanode overcame the threshold for hydrazine hydrate oxidation and the current density was seen to be swiftly enhanced until it reached a plateau region. This indicates that the photovoltage generated in the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode is sufficient enough to oxidize N2H4·H2O. The mechanism of PEC hydrazine hydrate decomposition can be envisaged based on the oxidizing power of BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Upon bandgap illumination, an electron–hole pair is generated on the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoanode. The valence band position of BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 exists at 2.35 V while N2H4/N2 has relatively negative standard reduction potential (−1.21 V). Due to the existence of the relatively positive valence band (VB) position of BiVO4, the holes (h+) generated on BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 have strong oxidizing power and will be transferred to oxidize the hydrazine. This indicates that hydrazine hydrate can be decomposed to N2 by the valence band holes (h+) while the conduction band electrons (e−) are transported to the Pt cathode via the outer circuit and reduces the H+ to H2.

In comparison to the reported results in the literature on the ITO/C60/ZnPc/Nafion electrode, which showed 0.080 mA cm−2 photocurrent density,24 the as developed BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO appears very promising, as evident from 20 fold enhancement (1.63 mA cm−2) at 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. A negative shift of 280 and 310 mV vs. water oxidation onset potential was observed for PO42− and HCO3− electrolytes, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). As a result, the onset potential for hydrazine oxidation shifted towards the negative direction in HCO3− electrolyte by 120 mV (Fig. S5, ESI†) compared to phosphate buffer electrolyte. This suggests that HCO3− is more catalytically favorable compared to PO42− ions in the electrolyte. An analogous effect of photocurrent enhancement at low bias potentials was observed on oxygen evolution catalyst modified BiVO4 based photoelectrodes.32,39 This shows that the photogenerated holes were effectively transferred at the electrode/electrolyte interface in the presence of HCO3− ions, which further catalyzes the oxidation of hydrazine hydrate by reducing the electrode overpotential. Meanwhile, photogenerated electrons stream through the external circuit and gets transferred to the Pt counter electrode to reduce water to hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the enhanced photocurrent in HCO3− electrolyte is surmised to be based on the catalytic effect of carbonate ions and easy desorption of the generated gas from the surface of oxide semiconductor photoelectrodes.40–43
In order to assess the dynamics of hydrazine hydrate oxidation, photocurrent vs. time measurements were performed on the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode in phosphate buffer and bicarbonate electrolytes having different concentrations of hydrazine hydrate (Fig. 6). Current vs. time (chronoamperometry) measurements were performed at 0.07 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) bias potential while the illumination was turned on and off. No remarkable change in the dark current of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode was observed with the change in the concentration of hydrazine hydrate. As the concentration of the hydrazine hydrate is increased from 0 mM to 90 mM, a significant change in the photocurrent density was observed both in phosphate (Fig. 6A) and bicarbonate (Fig. 6B) electrolytes. Steady decay in the photocurrent was observed in phosphate buffer electrolyte at all the concentrations of hydrazine hydrate. In contrast, the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode exhibited a stable hydrazine hydrate oxidation photocurrent at higher hydrazine hydrate concentrations in bicarbonate electrolyte. In addition, at a hydrazine hydrate concentration of 20 mM, the photocurrent reached as high as 1.46 mA cm−2 in a bicarbonate electrolyte compared to 1.09 mA cm−2 in phosphate buffer. Similarly, at higher concentrations (90 mM) of hydrazine hydrate the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode exhibited higher photocurrent in the presence of bicarbonate electrolyte compared to the phosphate buffer electrolyte indicating the catalytic ability of HCO3− ions over PO42− ions. The photocurrent enhancement with increase in the concentration of the hydrazine hydrate can be an effective way to quantify the concentration of hydrazine. Fig. 6C and D illustrate the photocurrent response of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode as a function of the hydrazine hydrate concentration in phosphate and bicarbonate electrolytes respectively. The photocurrent response of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode was found to be linearly dependent on the concentration of hydrazine in the range of 20 mM to 90 mM with correlation coefficients of 0.9901 and 0.9936 in phosphate buffer and bicarbonate electrolytes respectively. Based on this observation, the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode can be employed as a sensitive electrode for the quantitative determination of hydrazine hydrate in the range of 20 mM to 90 mM concentration. The effective utilization of visible light by BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO for the generation of holes and consequent oxidation of hydrazine lead to the detection of higher concentrations of hydrazine (up to 90 mM) as compared to the PEC hydrazine sensors based on TiO2 nanotubes that showed current saturation at very low hydrazine concentrations (1.6 mM).44

PEC measurements were also performed under short-circuit conditions at zero-bias using a two-electrode electrochemical cell, under chopped AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 7). Significantly, a stable photocurrent density of 0.26 mA cm−2 was attained at zero-bias. In our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of solar driven hydrogen production from hydrazine hydrate aqueous solution under neutral pH and zero bias conditions.

The measurements were performed in 0.1 M NaHCO3 aqueous solutions (pH 7) containing 100 mM hydrazine hydrate. 
In order to investigate the effect of HCO3− ions on charge transfer resistance (Rct) over PO42− ions in the electrolyte, the complex impedance analysis was carried out on the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode in a traditional three-electrode system containing either 0.1 M phosphate buffer or 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolytes (Fig. 8). The Nyquist plot typically presents a semicircle-like characteristic in its complex plane when the electrode impedance is mainly determined by the charge transfer resistance in a kinetics-controlled process.45 The exchange of majority carriers through the interface is represented by the Nyquist plot whose nature confirms the prevalence of the bulk contribution. Herein, the proposed equivalent circuit, as shown in the inset of (Fig. 8), has been applied to fit the EIS experimental data obtained in the electrochemical process for the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode. The fitting profiles are presented as solid lines and the experimental data are presented as individual data points. It is well established that the response at high frequency can be attributed to the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface, while the response at low frequency can be associated with the Warburg diffusion process in the electrolyte.46–48 The fitted equivalent circuit was useful to understand the underlying mechanisms for charge transport in different electrolytes. Notably, the series resistance (Rs), the Warburg diffusion resistance in the electrolyte (Ws), and the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface (Rct) exhibited strong dependencies on the nature of the electrolyte. The measured Rct values for Nyquist plots of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode from the model fits were found to be 345.5 and 474.5 Ω cm−2 in bicarbonate and phosphate buffer electrolytes, respectively. The reduced Rct indicates that the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface has been significantly improved in the presence of HCO3− ions. A similar effect of enhanced charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte was observed by Chatchai et al. for photoelectrodes modified with catalyst species.49

Based on the successful demonstration of solar-induced hydrazine hydrate oxidation, the long term stability for solar driven hydrazine hydrate oxidation at 0.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was studied in a conventional three electrode photoelectrochemical cell, under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 9). The BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode exhibited excellent stability towards the oxidation of hydrazine hydrate. No decay in the photocurrent density was observed at least for 5 days. The hydrogen gas was seen to evolve continuously on a Pt wire upon light illumination, as shown in the video (Video S1, ESI†). Furthermore, to investigate the stability of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode under dark conditions, the light illumination was chopped for almost 14.5 h and then the electrode was exposed to AM 1.5 G illumination (Fig. S6, ESI†). Under illumination, the oxidation of hydrazine hydrate was found to generate a stable photocurrent immediately. This indicates that the solar-induced hydrogen generation from hydrazine hydrate using the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode is feasible.

Considering the positive aspects of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO electrode in hydrazine oxidation, a PEC fuel cell was constructed to utilize hydrazine hydrate as the fuel. The details of hydrazine hydrate PFC configuration are depicted in (Fig. 10). The BiV0.98Mo0.02O4/FTO photoelectrode was employed as anode and the Pt wire was used as the cathode. A Nafion® membrane was placed between anode and cathode chambers as a separator to prevent the cross over between the anode and the cathode. The anode chamber was filled with either 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) or 0.1 M bicarbonate (pH 7) electrolytes containing varying concentrations of hydrazine hydrate. The cathode chamber was filled with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) or 0.1 M bicarbonate (pH 7) electrolytes. The oxidation of hydrazine hydrate at anode produces electrons, which stream into the cathode to reduce oxygen, thereby producing electricity at the output circuit. The V–I polarization curves and the dependence of the power density on the cell voltage are presented in (Fig. 11).

The open circuit potential of the cell in the absence of hydrazine was found to be 0.39 and 0.62 V in 0.1 M phosphate and 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolytes, respectively. The open circuit potential improved to 0.63 and 0.73 V upon the introduction of 10 mM hydrazine into 0.1 M phosphate and 0.1 M bicarbonate electrolytes, respectively. The open circuit potential and the maximum power output values increased as the concentration was raised up to 40 mM of hydrazine hydrate, in both phosphate and bicarbonate electrolytes. The PFC exhibited remarkable improvement in the power density in the presence of bicarbonate electrolyte as compared to phosphate buffer electrolyte. The PFC constructed with 40 mM concentration of hydrazine hydrate exhibited a maximum power density of 41.59 μW cm−2 in phosphate buffer electrolyte, while the PFC at the same concentration of hydrazine exhibited 74.48 μW cm−2 maximum power density in bicarbonate electrolyte. A significant enhancement of 79% in the power conversion efficiency was achieved in the presence of bicarbonate electrolyte due to the facile charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface aided by the bicarbonate ions. A further rise in the concentration to 60 mM did not result in a marked change in the performance. The cell has been tested after 15 days to understand the stability of the photoelectrode and the cell maintained 97% of its original power output (Fig. S7, ESI†), suggesting the stability of the photoelectrode towards the conversion of hydrazine hydrate into electricity with the assistance of light illumination.
Conclusion
In summary, a simple and efficient method was developed for hydrogen production from hydrazine hydrate under zero bias neutral pH conditions, with the aid of solar irradiation and a visible light active BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 photoelectrode. The BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 photoelectrode exhibited remarkable stability for hydrazine hydrate oxidation. Bicarbonate was found to be an excellent electrolyte system that provides high efficiencies in comparison to the phosphate buffer electrolyte under neutral pH conditions. The present work not only demonstrates a new method for utilizing BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 as an efficient visible light active photoanode for hydrazine hydrate oxidation for concomitant production of hydrogen at the cathode in a photoelectrochemical cell, but also extends the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 applicability to conceptual photoelectrochemical sensors and photofuel cells. It is expected that the reported results significantly expand the application of the BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 photoelectrode in the fields of waste water treatment and analytical chemistry.
