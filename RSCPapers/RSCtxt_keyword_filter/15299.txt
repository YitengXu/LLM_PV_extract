    , Accepted 18th October 2022First published on 18th October 2022AbstractMolecular self-assembly is a key factor that significantly influences the bulk film morphology to achieve the desired optoelectronic properties in organic photovoltaic devices. However, controlling the molecular aggregation and crystallinity via molecular design to reach the optimal bulk film morphology remains challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized three non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) referred to as Y-2Br-R (with R being the branched alkyl chain) using the same central core with Y6 but with different sizes of branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. Comparative studies show that engineering the N-alkyl chains onto the Y-2Br-R NFAs has a negligible effect on their energy levels. However, a significant impact on the molecular aggregation and crystallinity of the three NFAs was recorded, which allowed further manipulation of the donor and acceptor intermixing and resulted in different bulk film morphology. Specifically, the Y-2Br-HD-based bulk film shows a distinctly fibrous nanostructure with a favorably vertical composition distribution for efficient charge dissociation and transport. As a result, the Y-2Br-HD-based devices achieved a higher power conversion efficiency of 15.32% with a comparable short-circuit current density of 23.96 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 70.7%, outperforming the other devices. Our study provides a new perspective for understanding the relationships between side-chain modification-refined bulk film morphology and optoelectronic properties to develop high-performance NFAs.
1. Introduction
Due to their narrow band gap absorption and desired three-dimensional (3D) charge transport property,1,2 small molecule non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have recently attracted considerable interest in organic solar cells (OSCs), with a demonstrated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 19%.3,4 Among various NFAs, such as IDIC, ITIC, and their derivatives, the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type backbone configuration is considered a rational design rule for the desired optoelectronic properties.5–7 Generally, A–D–A type NFAs are composed of three essential components: a ladder-type fused-ring core, out-of-plane side chains, and two electron-withdrawing end-groups.8 These three components can be custom-tailored independently, providing molecular design flexibility and convenience for tuning optical and electronic properties.9–12 However, the coexistence of a rigid backbone and a flexible side chain often makes molecular self-assembly complex, as the backbone interactions and the side chain interdigitations must be balanced, and the geometry issue must be considered.13 These properties are particularly important in bulk heterojunction OSCs, as they determine the crystallinity of the NFAs as well as their mixing with polymer donors.14,15
Previous development of high-performance NFAs has mainly focused on purely electron-withdrawing end-groups, which are functionalized with fluorine or chlorine atoms.16–20 These design strategies have typically improved the photovoltaic properties in their derived OSCs with PCEs close to 15%,19,20 mainly due to significantly red-shifted absorption and/or compact intra-/intermolecular interactions.16,18 In addition, the precisely modulated conjugation and geometry of the ladder-type fused-ring cores have considerably promoted the intermolecular charge transport effect.21–23 For example, the fused core innovation from the D-type IDT/IDTT core (IDIC and ITIC) to the DA′D type BTP core (Y6 and Y6 analogs) facilitates an intense light absorption strength in the near-infrared region around 900 nm.24 On the other hand, their banana-shaped backbone gives Y6-type NFAs 3D-honeycomb structures via multiple modes, such as end-to-end packing, end-to-core packing, and core-to-core packing.25 These unique 3D-molecular interactions dictate the crystalline morphology and phase-separated nanostructure, which strongly affect the electronic properties and device performance.26 Despite this, facile optimization of molecular self-assembly behavior through backbone engineering is still challenging due to the tedious synthesis of the fused-ring core and electron-withdrawing end-groups.27,28
Similar to conventional conjugation materials (P3HT, PTB7-Th, BTR, etc.),29–32 the alkyl-to-alkyl lamellar packing in NFAs also played a crucial and decisive role in determining molecular self-assembly.33 As recently demonstrated, the two types of alkyl chains existing in the molecular structure of Y6 (two-branched alkyl chains attached to the pyrrole motif and two linear alkyl groups connected to the thiophene unit) not only ensured suitable solvent processibility and backbone coplanarity but also influenced the intermolecular interactions.34,35 For example, Hou et al. shortened the alkyl chains on the thiophene of the Y6-type molecule from C11 to C9, then C7; as a result, the NFA BTP-ec9 with the n-nonyl chain yielded an impressive PCE of 17.8%, demonstrating that minimizing the alkyl chains results in adequate solubility and enhanced intermolecular packing.36 In addition, Sun et al. reported a highly efficient NFA named L8-BO by substituting the beta position of the thiophene unit on Y6 with branched alkyl chains. It was revealed that the branched alkyl chain modification could utterly change the molecular packing behavior of L8-BO, leading to improved structural order and charge transport in the thin film. Thereby, an unprecedented efficiency of 18.32% with a high fill factor of 81.5% was achieved.37 More recently, Huang et al. developed eco-friendly processed Y6-type NFAs with a more branched alkyl chain (2-octyl-dodecyl) on the pyrrole motif and performed large-area OSCs with excellent efficiency of 14%.38 Notwithstanding the side chain optimization for efficient NFAs, there is still much work to be done to explore the effect of varied N-alkyl chains on molecular self-assembly to refine the bulk film morphology. Therefore, it is critical to systematically investigate how side-chain-mediated lamella assembly affects the crystalline morphology and optoelectronic properties in Y6-based OSCs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized three NFAs named Y-2Br-R (with R being the branched alkyl chain) using the same central core with the Y6 molecule but different sizes of branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif and brominated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC-Br) as electro-deficient end-group. The investigation of electrochemical properties revealed that the varied N-side chain has a negligible effect on energy levels. However, film absorption and two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) revealed significantly different molecular aggregations and crystallinities for the three NFAs. In particular, when blended with the donor polymer PM6, the Y-2Br-HD-based bulk film showed a distinctly fibrous nanostructure with optimal molecular crystallinity. Moreover, the desired intermixing of the donor and acceptor was proven by the vertical distribution of the composition and simulated exciton generation, which contributed to efficient charge transport and extraction. As a result, a high-power conversion efficiency of 15.32% with a short-circuit current density of 23.96 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 70.7% was achieved in the Y-2Br-HD-based device outperforming that of the other devices. Our comparative study provides a new sight to understand the effect of side-chain-mediated lamella assembly on bulk film morphology and photovoltaic properties in order to promote the development of high-performance NFAs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes and chemical structures of Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT are depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 1(a), and the experimental details are provided in the ESI.† The intermediate Y-CHO-R was prepared according to the reported method,24 which was then condensed with IC-Br to afford the Y-2Br-R. The three NFAs were purified using silica gel column chromatography with dichloromethane/petroleum ether as the eluent. The molecular structure was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR, as described in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†). It is noteworthy that the isomeric ratio of IC-Br-γ: IC-Br-δ in Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT were carefully analyzed and determined as close to 1:1 by 1H NMR, as shown in Fig. S1, S3, and S5 (ESI†). All three acceptors can be well dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene.

(d) Normalized absorption spectra in film of PM6 and thin-film absorption coefficient of Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT. 
Meanwhile, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to evaluate their thermal stabilities. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss were estimated as 325 °C, 326 °C, and 323 °C for Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT, respectively, suggesting good thermal stability for OSCs device fabrication and optimization over a wide temperature range. The effect of different sizes of N-alkyl chains on the molecular crystalline behavior was further investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).33 As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), we found that Y-2Br-HD has two distinct melting temperatures (Tm1 = 225 °C, Tm2 = 233 °C) relative to Y-2Br-OD and Y-2Br-DT, which indicates two thermodynamic phase transition processes, which are favourable to fine-tune the crystallization process of pure and blend film. In addition, the sharpest melting peak with the highest enthalpy (ΔHm1 = 21.07 J g−1) of Y-2Br-DT indicates the strongest crystallinity than Y-2Br-HD and Y-2Br-OD.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties and molecular packing
The optical properties of Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT were studied and compared in detail. The corresponding ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra in chloroform solution (<10−6 M) and thin films are recorded in Fig. 1(c) and (d), and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1(c), Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT in chloroform solution displayed similar absorption spectra in the wavelength range of 700–800 nm since the change of N-substituted alkyl chains did not affect the conjugation of the main chain. Their maximum absorption peak was located at 735 nm, mainly ascribed to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect between the BTP core and the end-groups. In the solid state (Fig. 1(d)), distinctly red-shifted and broadened spectra are observed for Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT, suggesting significant aggregation behaviors. The maximum absorption peaks of Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT are located at 814, 807, and 817 nm, respectively, revealing that the strong affect of various N-substituted alkyl side chains on molecular aggregation or stacking, probably due to different lamellar assembly. The optical bandgaps estimated from their absorption onset in the thin films were 1.33, 1.36, and 1.35 eV for Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT, respectively. The thin-film absorption coefficients at the maximum absorption peaks (Fig. 1(d)) were calculated as 0.74 × 105 cm−1 for Y-2Br-HD, 0.73 × 105 cm−1 for Y-2Br-OD, and 0.78 × 105 cm−1 for Y-2Br-DT, respectively. All three NFAs have complementary absorption bands with the benchmark polymer donor PM6, which has a strong absorption band at 300–700 nm (Fig. 1(d)).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the three NFAs. The resulting energy level alignment of the molecules is shown in Fig. 1(b) and Table 1. The reduction/oxidation onset potentials (Ered/Eox) for Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DTversus Ag/Ag+ were measured to be 1.26/−0.58, 1.26/−0.59, and 1.29/−0.60 V, respectively. According to the formula ELUMO/EHOMO = −(Ered/Eox + 4.8) eV, the corresponding energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) were calculated to be −3.92/−5.76, −3.91/−5.76 and −3.90/−5.79 eV for Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT, respectively. These similar values of HOMO and LUMO imply that the energy levels are primarily dependent on the molecular backbone and that the effect of N-substituted alkyl chains is negligible. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PM6 was 11.4 kDa and 2.68, respectively. And the corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels of PM6 were measured using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S10, ESI†) and determined as −5.35 eV and −3.42 eV, respectively. Additionally, sufficient HOMO energy level spacing (>0.30 eV) between the three acceptors and the PM6 donor would provide a sufficient driving force for charge separation and prove beneficial in achieving low energy loss.
2D-GIWAXS measurements were performed to illustrate the effect of the different N-alkyl chains on molecular packing and orientation. Fig. 2 shows the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and corresponding line-cut profiles in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions. All three acceptors adopt a preferential face-on orientation, supported by the pronounced (010) scattering peak in the OOP direction and the (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction. Interestingly, the Y-2Br-HD and Y-2Br-DT films exhibited strong alkyl-to-alkyl lamellar packings with one lamellar stacking peak at 0.29 Å−1 (21.2 Å) and another lamellar stacking peak at 0.44 Å−1 (14.2 Å) in the IP direction. In addition, the two sharp and intensive π–π stacking peaks were located at around 1.75 Å−1 (3.59 Å) and 1.58 Å−1 (3.97 Å), respectively, probably corresponding to more intense end-to-end stacking and end-to-core stacking, which resembles the single-crystal features of Y6-type molecule.39 In comparison, the Y-2Br-OD film shows a typical structure ordering with a prominent lamellar stacking peak at 0.27 Å−1 (22.9 Å) and an intensive π–π stacking peak at 1.69 Å−1 (3.80 Å). Meanwhile, its halo-shape diffraction (010) distributed over a wide azimuthal angle range suggests a random crystal orientation. Thus, it exhibits relatively lower crystallinity and poorer crystalline orientation compared to the Y-2Br-HD and Y-2Br-DT films. These results were echoed with the aggregation behavior reflected by the UV-vis results in film and indicate the significant effect of various N-alkyl chains on molecular self-assembly. As presented in Fig. 2(c), using the Scherrer Equation, the corresponding crystal coherence length of the π–π stacking (CCL010) in the OOP direction and the lamellar stacking (CCL100) in the IP direction are estimated to be 51.9/86.5, 13.9/40.4, and 61.6/195.3 Å for the Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT films, respectively. Notably, the strongest molecular crystallinity is again demonstrated for Y-2Br-DT compared to Y-2Br-HD and Y-2Br-OD, indicating that the longer 2-decyltetradecyl self-assembles more readily to form highly compact molecular packing. These results declare that the different molecular self-assembly was closely associated with the size of the N-side chain in the Y-2Br-R acceptors, probably due to the various side-chain arrangement/interdigitation in the 3D network interactions.40

2.3. Photovoltaic properties
The effect of different N-alkyl chain sizes on the photovoltaic properties of the three acceptors was investigated by fabricating devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/PDINO/Al. PM6 was employed as the donor material because of its strong absorption in the 450–700 nm region (Fig. 1(d)) and its matched energy levels with three acceptors. The detailed fabrication processes of the devices are described in the (ESI†). Fig. 3(a) shows the optimized current density–voltage (J–V) curves, and Table 2 summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices. The PM6:Y-2Br-HD-based device showed a maximum PCE of 15.32%, with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V and a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 23.96 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 70.70%. When replacing the short 2-hexyldecyl with a longer 2-octyldecyl, the derived PM6:Y-2Br-OD-based device showed a deteriorated PCE of 14.19% (Voc = 0.92 V; Jsc = 22.35 mA cm−2; FF = 68.80%). By further increasing the length of the N-alkyl chain to 2-decyltetradecyl, a similar PCE of 14.26% was achieved for the PM6:Y-2Br-DT-based device. Notably, the better photovoltaic performance of the PM6:Y-2Br-HD-based devices is mainly reflected in the relatively high values of Jsc and FF. Thus, to elucidate the origin of the enhanced Jsc, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured. As shown in Fig. 3(b), all three devices presented a strong and broad photoresponse range from a wavelength of 350 to 900 nm. Specifically, the PM6:Y-2Br-HD-based device shows a higher EQE value than the other two devices in the range of 400–850 nm. The maximum EQE value can reach ∼80%, indicating a higher incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency in the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend, which is likely related to the favorable bulk morphology.

2.4. Charge generation, transport, and recombination
To understand the effect of various N-alkyl chains on the different photovoltaic performances, the charge carrier mobilities of the three blend films were measured with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The hole mobility (μh) was measured with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al, while the electron mobility (μe) was given an architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al. As shown in Fig. S11 and Table S1 (ESI†), the μh are estimated to be 2.19 × 10−4, 1.56 × 10−4, and 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:Y-2Br-HD, PM6:Y-2Br-OD, and PM6:Y-2Br-DT blend, respectively; and the corresponding μe values are determined to be 1.17 × 10−3, 1.08 × 10−3 and 8.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. It was found that the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film demonstrated higher values for both hole and electron mobility than the other two blend films. Moreover, we found a more balanced ratio of hole and electron mobility (μe/μh = 5.3) for the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film compared to that (6.9 and 6.1) of PM6:Y-2Br-OD and PM6:Y-2Br-DT, respectively. These results may be closely related to the quite different morphology of the blend film, probably PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film has an ideal phase separation in the vertical direction for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the higher charge mobility and more balanced μe/μh in the blend film should contribute to more effective charge transport and extraction, resulting in the enhancement of Jsc and FF for the PM6:Y-2Br-HD-based device.
We further assessed the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes of three acceptor-based devices to better understand the different device efficiencies among the three acceptors. The curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) are shown in Fig. 3(c). Jph was estimated according to the equation Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD stand for the current densities under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and in darkness, respectively. On the other hand, Veff could be calculated from Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when JL = JD and V is the applied voltage. As seen from the curves in Fig. 3(c), all devices can reach saturated current density (Jsat) when Veff is close to 1 V, indicating sufficient exciton dissociation and charge collection. Meanwhile, the exciton dissociation probability values could be calculated by Jph/Jsat, and the corresponding ratio was estimated to be 96.6%, 94.7%, and 94.4% for Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT-based devices, respectively. Such a high value for the Y-2Br-HD-based device compared to the other two devices, suggests more effective exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interfaces and more effective charge collection by the electrode, which resulted in enhanced Jsc and FF.
Moreover, the charge recombination mechanism for the three blend films was investigated from the relationships between the current density under different light intensities (Jsc ∝ Pαlight, where α is the exponential factor). From the measured curves in Fig. 3(d), α values are calculated to be 1.00 for both Y-2Br-HD and Y-2Br-DT-based devices, slightly higher than those of Y-2Br-OD (0.99). This result indicates a more efficiently suppressed bimolecular recombination process for Y-2Br-HD and Y-2Br-DT-based devices than for the Y-2Br-OD device, which also explains the higher FF values.
2.5. Morphological properties of blend films
To study the correlations between bulk film morphology and photovoltaic properties, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and film-depth-dependent light absorption spectrometry (FLAS) were performed to unravel the influence of various N-alkyl chains on the microstructural features on the three blend films. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the AFM topography images of PM6:Y-2Br-HD, PM6:Y-2Br-OD, and PM6:Y-2Br-DT present relatively smooth and uniform surfaces with similar root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.31, 1.57, and 1.35 nm, respectively. However, quite different phase images of the three blend films are observed in Fig. 4(b), where the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film presents well-defined polymer fibrils that have previously been found conducive to exciton dissociation and charge transport.41,42 Comparatively, a larger phase-separated domain is observed in both PM6:Y-2Br-OD and PM6:Y-2Br-DT blend films, indicating negative crystalline behavior or intermolecular mixing. These results echo the mobility discussed previously, where PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film possesses higher hole and electron mobility and a more balanced hole/electron mobility ratio than PM6:Y-2Br-OD and PM6:Y-2Br-DT blend film. Overall, these results imply that the alteration of N-alkyl chains in Y-2Br-R acceptors strongly affects their molecular self-assembly and then manipulates their miscibility with polymer donor, resulting in different bulk film morphology and electronic properties.

In addition, the vertical distributions of PM6 and Y-2Br-R in the three blend films were systematically investigated by FLAS, which has proven to be a well-established technique for mapping the composition, morphology, and optical/electronic properties along the film-depth direction.43,44 The film-depth-light absorption and simulated exciton generation profile of the three optimized blend films are shown in Fig. 5. The depths of 0 and 100 nm represent the PEDOT:PSS/active-layer and active-layer/PDINO interfaces, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 5(a), the position of the PM6 absorption peaks remains almost consistent (∼623 nm) throughout the vertical film in all three blend films. However, the maximum absorption peaks of the three NFAs show apparent variations at different depths. Specifically, in PM6:Y-2Br-DT, the distribution of the Y-2Br-DT component is not uniform in the vertical direction, evidenced by the position of the maximum peak from 803 to 815 nm. The approximately 10 nm red-shift of this maximum peak indicates a more robust molecular ordering of Y-2Br-DT in the blend, which is consistent with the GIWAXS results. In comparison, the PM6:Y-2Br-HD and PM6:Y-2Br-OD blend films show a relatively uniform phase distribution throughout the entire active layer vertically, where the maximum absorption peaks of Y-2Br-HD and Y-2Br-OD in the blends present a shift of only 5 and 3 nm, respectively.

The sub-layer thickness for each spectrum is ≈10 ± 2 nm, and the dashed lines show the evolution of absorption peaks along the film-depth direction. (b) Simulated exciton generation contours as a function of film depth. (c) Exciton generation rate G profiles are simulated from film-depth-dependent absorption spectra with an optical transfer matrix model. The FWHM is estimated from the exciton generation rate curve as a film depth function. 
Furthermore, we simulated the exciton generation as a function of film depth for the three blend films by combining the depth-dependent spectra with an optical transfer matrix model.43,45Fig. 5(b) shows the exciton generation contour derived from the harvested solar energy within the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al device, where the incident light comes from the ITO/PEDOT:PSS side. Notably, in the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film, more excitons were generated in the PM6 phase (at 450 and 600 nm) near the anode region and the cathode region compared to the other two blend films, consistent with a locally enriched donor. Meanwhile, a higher density of excitons was observed in the Y-2Br-HD phase (700–900 nm) compared to the other two blend films, indicating that most of the harvested photons are converted to excitons in the active layer bottom-half of the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film. This is consistent with the results of higher EQE values in the Y-2Br-HD-based devices. The exciton generation rate (G) profile of the three devices is shown in Fig. 5(c), as simulated from the film-depth-dependent absorption spectra of the active layer upon , where λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck's constant, and c is the light speed. Compared to the PM6:Y-2Br-OD and PM6:Y-2Br-DT blend films, a higher exciton generation rate, with a G-value greater than 20 nm−3 s−1, is observed in the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend, probably due to proper intermixing and crystallinity for efficient charge dissociation and transport. In addition, it is noted that most excitons are produced in the bottom-half of the active layer for all three blend systems, meaning that electrons must travel a long distance to the cathode after exciton dissociation. Under such circumstances, we estimated the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the exciton generation rate to evaluate the bulk film morphology-dependent exciton dissociation process. Note that the small FWHM of 79 nm in the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend reveals a narrow intermixed phase, which is beneficial to the well-balanced exciton (hole/electron) traveling to efficiently reach the corresponding electrode. However, the relatively large FWHM values of PM6:Y-2Br-OD (82) and PM6:Y-2Br-DT (88) probably form excessive or limited miscibility, thus hindering electron charge dissociation and transport throughout the vertical bulk film. These results resonate well with the above-discussed charge transport and recombination to explain the better Jsc and FF of the PM6:Y-2Br-HD device, indicating that the underlying three-phase separated bulk morphology like the p–i–n structure is required.
2.6. Molecular packing and orientation
To further illustrate how the various N-alkyl chains affect the blend film morphology and photovoltaic performance, the molecular packing and crystallinity of the blend films were investigated by 2D-GIWAXS. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the 2D-GIWAXS patterns of the neat PM6 film show clear (010) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction, adopting the face-on orientation. After being blended with PM6, the three bulk films still present the predominant preferred face-on orientation, as evidenced by a lamellar (100) peak in the IP direction and an apparent π–π stacking (010) diffraction in the OOP directions, which favors vertical charge transport in the solar device. In the PM6:Y-2Br-HD and PM6:Y-2Br-OD blend films, the PM6 (100) diffraction and acceptor (100) diffraction are merged together and cannot be analyzed separately. However, several distinct peaks at 0.24, 0.39, 0.44, and 1.53 Å−1 are observed in the PM6:Y-2Br-DT blend films, indicating the intrinsic crystal behavior of Y-2Br-DT. This bulk film crystal behavior suggests the presence of large acceptor grains in the blend and weak interaction between PM6 and Y-2Br-DT. Comparatively, the PM6:Y-2Br-OD blend films present relatively higher PM6 diffraction, as evidenced by the stronger PM6 diffractions at 0.65 and 0.92 Å−1, thus indicating a suboptimized intermixing. Meanwhile, the stronger crystal coherence of the lamellar stacking (100) in the PM6:Y-2Br-OD blend films reflects a more robust side chain-mediated self-assembly. Notably, the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend present relatively lower Y-2Br-HD diffraction, as evidenced by the disappeared Y-2Br-HD diffractions at 0.44 and 1.58 Å−1 along with the relatively moderate CCL010 (18.8 Å) and CCL100 (76.4 Å), thus indicating a well-mixed bulk morphology of PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend. We speculate that these bulk crystalline features may facilitate the formation of the three-phase separated bulk morphology. As shown in Fig. 6(c), better charge transport properties in the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film again demonstrate the importance of balanced molecular self-assembly and intermolecular miscibility for desired bulk film morphology.

3. Conclusions
In this study, three Y-2Br-R NFAs were developed by adopting the Y6 framework as the fused-ring core, but with different sizes of branched side chains on the pyrrole unit and IC-Br as electro-deficient end-groups, named Y-2Br-HD, Y-2Br-OD, and Y-2Br-DT. It was found that the various N-alkyl chains on the Y-2Br-R NFAs had a negligible effect on their energy levels. However, different molecular aggregations and crystallinity were observed in the neat films, ascribed to the multi-scale lamella assembly mediated by various side chains. When blended with the polymer donor PM6, the Y-2Br-HD-based bulk film exhibited a distinctly fibrous nanostructure with appropriate molecular crystallinity. Moreover, the FLAS along with exciton generation profiles and 2D-GIWAXS characterizations proved that the donor and acceptor intermixing in the PM6:Y-2Br-HD blend film was more desirable than in the other two blends, which contributes to efficient charge transport and extraction. As a result, a high PCE of 15.32% with a Jsc of 23.96 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.7% was achieved for the Y-2Br-HD-based devices. Our comparative study provided new insight into the effect of side-chain-mediated lamella assembly on bulk film morphology and photovoltaic properties to promote the development of high-performance NFAs.
