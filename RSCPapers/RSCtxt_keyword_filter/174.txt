1. Introduction

        Copper-based quaternary I2–II–IV–VI4chalcopyrite semiconductors have been one of the subjects of intense research in recent years as they are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. Among them, Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) is an emerging solar cell material whose constituents, Zn and Sn, are nontoxic, low cost and earth-abundant. As an important quaternary chalcogenide with high potential for photovoltaics, CZTSe has a near-optimum direct band gap energy of (∼1.5 eV) and a large absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1).1–3CZTSe is considered to be one of the most promising substitutes for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS), which has higher power conversion efficiency but contains expensive rare metals of In and Ga. CZTSe has also been reported to possess interesting thermoelectric properties.4 Solar cells based on CZTSe have been obtained with a 9.66% efficiency.5 Quinary combination of CZTSSe was also used for the development of low cost thin film solar cells with efficiency as high as 7.2%. On the other hand, low dimensional semiconductor nanomaterials including nanosheets, nanowires and nanorods have attracted much attention recently for its various excellent optical and electrical properties and potential applications in constructing nanoscale electric and optoelectronic devices. It has been reported that the shape and size of nanoscale semiconductors may exert a significant influence on their optoelectronic function and device performance, and sometimes induce unique physical and chemical properties different from their bulk counterparts.6–8 Some novel features have been found in the nanoscale semiconductor systems, such as an obvious enhancement of solar energy conversion efficiencies of photovoltaic devices covered with nanocrystalline-based semiconductor absorber layers.9,10 Therefore, controlled growth or fabrication of nanostructures with desired morphology, shape and size is very important for both nanomaterials science and technology.11–13 Many studies have been focused on CZTSe and various methods have been developed to prepare CZTSe films or nanoparticles, such as the wet chemical route,14 coevaporation15 and sputtering.16 Some of these reported approaches require either high energy consumption or a relatively complicated procedure. Up to now, the shape and size control of quaternary nanomaterials are still a challenge to overcome. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the preparation of sheet-like shape of CZTSe by a solution chemical route. Here we reported a convenient low temperature solvothermal approach for fabrication of large scale quaternary single crystalline Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets with thickness as thin as only 20 nm. Furthermore, the thickness of Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets is found to be tunable by modifying the amount of solvent of ethylenediamine. Our current approach may be extended to the preparation of nanosheets of other quaternary chalcopyrites.
2. Experimental section
All reagents are analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical procedure for the preparation of CZTSe nanosheets, 3 mmol of Se, 1.5 mmol of CuCl2–2H2O, 0.75 mmol of SnCl4–5H2O, 0.75 mmol of ZnCl2 and 18 mL of anhydrous ethylenediamine (En) were added to a 50 ml beaker in air. The mixture was treated with mild magnetic stirring for 5 min before being transferred into a 20 ml stainless steel teflon-lined autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and the temperature was maintained at 210 °C for 15 hours before being cooled down to room temperature. The precipitate was separated by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, and finally dried in vacuum at 40 °C for 4 h.
The overall crystallinity of the product is examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku RU-300 with CuKα radiation). The general morphology of the products was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (FESEM QF400). Detailed microstructure analysis was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM Tecnai 20ST). The chemical composition and the spatial distribution of the compositional elements of the product were examined using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer and a Gatan image filtering (GIF) system, attached to the same microscope. The UV-Vis spectrum of the product was recorded in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-1601PC, Shimadzu Corporation). Room-temperature Raman spectra were measured using a micro-laser Raman spectrometer (Renishaw) in a backscattering configuration, employing the 514.5 nm line of Ar laser as the excitation source.
3. Results and discussion
The crystal structure of the product was firstly characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1 shows a typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared Cu2ZnSnSe4 product. All diffraction peaks are consistent with the tetragonal stannite-type crystal structured Cu2ZnSnSe2, compatible with the reported value for the Cu2ZnSnSe2 crystal (JCPDS card, no. 52-0868). However, as shown in the Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of zinc blende ZnSe (JCPDS card, no. 371463), cubic Cu2SnSe4 (JCPDS card, no. 160670) and cubic Cu2Se (JCPDS card, no. 882043) are all close to that of CZTSe. Therefore, XRD itself cannot give conclusive evidence of the existence of phase pure tetragonal CZTSe because it is hard to distinguish the XRD pattern of CZTSe from that of the other 3 compounds.

The Raman spectrum (as shown in Fig. 2) of the product can give further structural information. An obviously strong peak at 196 cm−1 and one other weak peak at 231 cm−1 are found in Fig. 2, which match well with that for bulk CZTSe.17 This Raman spectrum, together with the above XRD pattern, gives clear structure evidence for the single phase of CZTSe for the as-prepared product.

The SEM image in Fig. 3(a) shows an overview of the as-prepared products. It is apparent that the products consist of a large quantity of sheets with a size of 1–3 μm. An enlarged image in Fig. 3(b) displays some nearly vertical nanosheets which discloses clearly that these sheets are very thin and the average thickness is only about 20 nm.

TEM studies accompanied by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry were performed to characterize the structure and chemical composition of Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets. A typical TEM image of Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets in Fig. 4(a) discloses that nanosheets are almost semi-transparent under TEM electron beam due to its very thin thickness. A high HRTEM image of the Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets in Fig. 4(b) displays a clear lattice spacing of 0.2 nm corresponding to the d spacing of the (204) planes in tetragonal crystal structured Cu2ZnSnSe4, confirming the highly crystalline nature of the as-prepared nanosheets. The inset of Fig. 4(b) shows a two-dimensional Fourier transform pattern of the lattice resolved image, which can be indexed to the [221] zone of the tetragonal structured Cu2ZnSnSe2. The electron beam was most likely aligned perpendicular to the flat surface, therefore, it can be concluded that the flat surfaces of the sheets are perpendicular to the [221] zone, and thence to be the plane of (112) in the tetragonal crystal structured Cu2ZnSnSe2.

The EDX spectrum (Fig. 4(c)) taken from the sample shows intense peaks of Cu, Zn, Sn and Se, suggesting the composition of Cu, Zn, Sn and Se. The gold and carbon signals come from the supporting TEM grid (Au TEM grid is employed to avoid the background signal from the conventional Cu grid). EDX quantitative analysis gives an average Cu/Zn/Sn/Se composition ratio of 2:1:1:4, in accordance with the stoichiometry of Cu2ZnSnSe4.

Fig. 5 shows the room temperature UV-Vis absorption spectrum for the as-prepared Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheet sample. A strong photon absorption in the entire visible range of light is found and results in the dark black color of the sample, suggesting their potential in solar energy applications. Estimation of the optical band gap (Eg) of the Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanowires can be obtained by plotting (αhν)2 as a function of the photon energy (in the inset of Fig. 5), with α being the absorption coefficient, h Planck's constant, and ν the frequency. The Eg value is estimated as 1.37 eV from the intersection of the extrapolated linear portion with the x-axis (photon energy), being consistent with the reported values of Cu2ZnSnSe4 in the literature.18 Such a band gap value is desirable for the photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.

Our experimental results (as shown in Fig. 6) indicate that the amount of En has a significantly influence on the thickness of final obtained Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets. If 18 ml En is used, very thin sheets (thickness is about 20 nm) can be obtained (as previously shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b)). A small decrease of the amount of En to 17 ml, with other reaction conditions unchanged, resulted in still sheets, but the thickness increases a little to about 40 nm (Fig. 6(a)). A further decrease of En volume to 15 ml produced sheets with an average thickness of about 100 nm (Fig. 6(b)). When the En volume was decreased to 13 ml or 10 ml, a lot of plates with an average thickness of about 200 nm (Fig. 6(c)) or 400 nm (Fig. 6(d)) appeared in the sample. So, it is obvious that the thickness of produced sheets increases with the decrease of the En amount.

These results suggest that ethylenediamine (En) plays an important role in the formation of Cu2ZnSnSe4 and the thickness of the Cu2ZnSnSe4 sheets is strongly dependent on the amount of En. In our present solution approach, we believe that the En acts as both a chelating agent and a surface-passivating agent. Ethylenediamine has been known to be a strong chelating agent. Ethylenediamine chelated with Cu+, Sn2+, Zn2+ and formed complex ions. This will level much and balance the reactivity of the cationic precursors, as a result, formation of homogeneous quaternary nanocrystals becomes favorable.19 Meanwhile, ethylenediamine is a good solvent of elemental selenium.20 The selenium powder was dissolved in ethylenediamine with stirring after its addition, evidenced by the change of solution color from opaque to brown and the disappearing of selenium powder. Ethylenediamine then reduced the dissolved elemental Se to negatively charged Se2− with an organic nucleophilic attack. Se2− reacted with ions of En chelated Cu+, Sn2+, Zn2+ to form CZTSe molecules. After the nucleation of CZTSe molecules, grain growth begins. Here, we believe that the En molecules can control the growth rates of different crystalline facets of CZTSe by interacting with these facets through selective absorption and desorption. It can be presumed that the wide surfaces of CZTSe sheets are completely passivated by En while the side surfaces are partially passivated. Therefore the En absorbs or binds strongly on the wide surface and hinders the growth along the direction that is perpendicular to the wide plane. So, the lamellar shape is formed. The decreasing of En will reduce the passivation effect, which induces the thickening of the CZTSe sheet. Another alternative explanation is based on the thermodynamic view. The equilibrium structure for the crystals may be different after adsorption of different concentrations of En. It is possible that the surface energies of different facets of the crystals are different. This will lead to the anisotropic behavior of the crystals. Especially after the selective attachment of the En molecules on certain facets, the anisotropic behavior will be more obvious.
In summary, a facile solution approach for fabrication of large scale quaternary Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets has been developed. During the reaction process, ethylenediamine acted as both a surface-passivating agent and an effective chelating agent. The thickness of Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets can be tuned by modifying the amount of En. A growth mechanism of Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets was also proposed. UV-Vis optical investigation shows that the band gap of the as-prepared Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanosheets is 1.37 eV, disclosing their suitability for the photovoltaic application. The present synthesis strategy may be extended to synthesize other quaternary chalcopyrites with nanosheet shape.
