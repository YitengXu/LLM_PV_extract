    , Accepted 7th October 2017First published on 9th October 2017AbstractUp-conversion (UC) materials whose emission color can be finely-tuned while a high UC quantum efficiency is maintained are desirable for many applications. Herein, we report near-infrared-to-visible La2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ (LYE) UC materials with a high internal quantum yield (UCQY) of 3.8%, external UCQY (brightness) of 1.6% and tunable emission color. UC emission colors from pure green to reddish-orange can be precisely tailored by simply controlling synthesis conditions, whilst maintaining the high UCQY. The internal UCQY and external UCQY of LYE yield better performance than both commercially available and other record UC phosphors reported in the literature under the same excitation conditions. The facile preparation combined with the color-tuning and high UCQYs make these materials attractive candidates for solar energy harvesting, sensors, 3D volumetric displays, solid state lasers and bio-imaging.
1. Introduction
Photon up-conversion (UC) is a nonlinear anti-Stokes process converting low energy excitation photons – in this case in the near-infrared (NIR) – to higher energy photons, with emission wavelengths ranging from the NIR to visible, and even into the ultraviolet (UV) at high excitation powers. The initial concept of UC emission was proposed by Bloembergen in 19591 and first experimentally realized in Yb3+ sensitized UC inorganic materials by Auzel in 1966.2 Trivalent lanthanide (Ln3+) activated inorganic UC materials present many unique advantages, such as large anti-Stokes shift, high signal/noise ratio, reliance of cheap and powerful of NIR laser diodes (LDs) for optical pumping, tailored UC emission color and long photoluminescent (PL) lifetimes.3–6 These unique features make Ln3+-activated inorganic UC materials of interest for a diverse range of applications including: solar energy harvesting, sensors, 3D volumetric displays, solid state lasers and bio-imaging.7–14 So far, the most efficient Ln3+-activated UC materials that have been reported are heavily and singly Er3+ doped materials that function under excitation at ∼1500 nm with main UC emission at ∼980 nm. For example, Gd2O2S:10Er3+, β-NaYF4:10Er3+, and BaY2F8:20Er3+ have exhibited internal UC quantum yields (UCQY) of 12 ± 1%, 14.6% and 10.7 ± 1.2% at excitation powers of 0.7 W m−2, 197 W cm−2 and 7 W cm−2, respectively.15–19 These were investigated for solar energy harvesting of NIR light, however their applications are limited due to the single dominant emission peak at 980 nm and there being relatively few options for tuning the emission wavelength.
Instead, dual-doped materials that use Yb3+ as sensitizer to strongly enhance the absorption of 980 nm light, are much more attractive and offer vast possibilities for color tuning.14 Further technological advantages are the low price of both 980 nm LDs as excitation sources and silicon-based detectors. Among these materials, Yb3+/Er3+ activated oxysulfides (such as the commercial green UC phosphor of Gd2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+) and fluorides (such as β-NaYF4:18Yb3+,2Er3+ microcrystals) have been reported with the highest internal UCQY of ∼3% in green to yellow region upon excitation of 980 nm LDs.20–22 Unfortunately, the UC efficiency in red and blue is much lower than in green. For example, the high UCQY of ∼0.5% (for red) and ∼1% (for blue) were reported for Y2O3:Yb,Er and Y2O2S:Yb,Tm, respectively.23 Additionally, the UC emission colors of Yb3+/Er3+ in oxysulfides and fluorides are strictly limited in green to yellow region due to the poor tunability of IR/IG ratio (UC emission intensity in red divided by that in green). UC materials that offer broadly tunable emission colors, ranging from green to red, while maintaining a high UCQY, which are required for practical applications are still missing.
It is also still a non-trivial challenge to accurately characterize the UCQY due to potentially weak absorption and UC emission signals, and the strong nonlinear dependence of UCQY value on excitation power density.11,16,24 Consequently, the UCQY is rarely reported in the literature. In some cases, an UC power conversion efficiency is adopted. This is defined as the emitted power in a desired color band divided by power absorbed by the phosphor and is typically at least two times higher than the UCQY for a given UC material. For example, the UC power conversion efficiency of ∼4% were reported for bulk β-NaYF4:18Yb3+,2Er3+ and Y2O2S:8Yb3+,6Er3+ under a high excitation power density of ∼100 W cm−2.23 An UC power conversion efficiency of ∼5.2 ± 0.2% was reported for BaY2ZnO5:7Yb3+,3Er3+ (BYYE) with an excitation power density of 2.2 W cm−2.25,26 Recently, an UC power conversion efficiency of 2.7% was demonstrated for Ba5Gd8Zn4O21:12Yb3+,4Er3+ (BGYE) with an excitation power of 0.67 W.27 The internal UCQY value of 3.0 ± 0.3% was measured for bulk β-NaYF4:20Yb3+,2Er3+ with an excitation power density of 20 W cm−2.20 The internal UCQY of 5.83% over the whole spectrum from visible to NIR was reported for La2O2S:9Yb3+,1Er3+ with excitation power density of 13 W cm−2.21,22 However, there has been, to date, no systematic study that has measured the UCQY among these best samples under the same conditions to allow comparison and thus to raise interest in the development of novel UC materials. Therefore, the commercial green UC phosphors, BYYE and BGYE selected as the references in our study and compared with our newly developed La2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ (LYE) under identical conditions by means of intensity/brightness and internal/external UCQY.
We select La2O3 as the host for Yb3+/Er3+ owing to its low phonon energy of <450 cm−1, which is among the lowest value achievable in oxide-based materials (for details see ESI,† Fig. S1).28,29 Interestingly, the UC emission color of LYE can be finely tuned from green to reddish-orange, while the high UCQY is maintained for the whole tunable color range. Importantly, we employ a powerful setup to measure the absolute internal (ratio of emitted to absorbed photons) and external (ratio of emitted to incident photons) UCQY values according to the 2M and 3M procedures.30,31 The internal and external UCQY values of our newly developed LYE are compared with commercial available green UC phosphors of Gd2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+ (GSYE) from four different companies, the aforementioned UC phosphors (BYYE and BGYE) reported in the literature as having a high UCQY, which could be indexed as a simple standard reference to guide the development of novel UC materials. Both the internal UCQY and the external UCQY (brightness) of our newly developed LYE are better than those of the reference materials. The finely tunable UC emission color at a consistently high UCQY, combined with the facile preparation, point towards its application in solar energy harvesting, sensors, 3D volumetric displays, solid state lasers and bio-imaging.
2. Experimental
2.1 Samples preparation
A series of micro-crystalline samples with nominal compositions of RE1.98−2xO3:xYb3+,1Er3+ (RE = La, Gd, Lu, Y and Sc; x = 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16) and La1.84−2yO3:yEr3+,8Yb3+ (y = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32) were synthesized by solid state reaction. Stoichiometric batches of ∼2 g starting materials of RE2O3 (99.9%, ChemPur Feinchemikalien und Forschungsbedarf GmbH, Re = La, Gd, Lu, Y, Sc, Yb and Er) were thoroughly ground in an agate mortar and then pre-sintered in alumina crucibles at 1300 °C for 4 h in a bottom-loading furnace (Carbolite BLF 1700 °C) in air. The resulting powders were reground then sintered at 1300–1650 °C for 3–12 h in alumina crucibles in air with two intermediate grind steps. The reference materials of BaY2ZnO5:7Yb3+,3Er3+ (BYYE)25 and Ba5Gd8Zn4O21:12Yb3+,4Er3+ (BGYE)27 were synthesized via solid state reaction exactly according to the method described in the literature. The commercial green UC phosphors of Gd2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+ were obtained from three different companies, including Phosphor Technology (UK), MaxMax (USA) and Honeywell Deutschland Holding GmbH (Germany).
2.2 Structural and optical characterization
Raman spectra were recorded on a confocal micro-Raman instrument (Ocean Optics Raman) using a 785 nm laser as excitation source at a resolution of 2 cm−1. The crystal structure was studied by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D8 Discover with Cu Kα radiation) with a step width of 0.01° s−1, a counting time of 1 s per step and sample rotation. Structures refinements were performed using the Rietveld method with the program TOPAS 4.2 (Bruker AXS). Diffuse reflectance spectra over the UV-visible-NIR range were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Commission International de I’Eclairage (CIE 1931) chromaticity color coordinates were determined by integrating the PL spectra. All analyses were performed at room temperature.
2.3 UC characterization
The UC emission spectra, decay curves and quantum yield (UCQY) were measured in a home-built optical system. A 980 nm continuous wave (CW) LD (Roithner, 200 mW) with a bandwidth of 2.5 nm was used as excitation source. The working temperature of the LD was maintained at 20.00 ± 0.01 °C using a temperature controller (Thorlabs TCLDM9) to avoid any potential temperature dependent shift of the laser peak. The power of the laser beam was adjusted by the use of the controlled rotatable neutral density filter (Thorlabs) from 0.05 to 200 W cm−2. The power density of laser was kept at 0.5 W cm−2 for all UC emission spectra measurements. A CCD spectrometer (Thorlabs C200) was used to record the UC emission spectra.
The absolute internal and external UCQY values were measured according to the 2M and 3M procedures30,31 with both techniques yielding the same UCQY values. For UCQY calculations, only the dominant UC emission peaks in the 500 to 700 nm range are considered. During the UCQY and decay measurements, the laser beam was additionally focused by a 75 cm focal-length lens and directed into a 15 cm diameter integrating sphere (Labsphere). The beam size on the sample was measured with a scanning-slit optical beam profiler (Thorlabs), to be equal 0.9 × 1.3 mm (4-sigma), yielding an excitation power density 7.6 W cm−2. An optical fiber with a 1 mm diameter (Thorlabs FP1000URT) was used for collection of the emission from the integrating sphere and transfer to the spectrometer. To determine the UCQY, measurements of absorption and emission were taken by adjusting the integration time of the spectrometer to capture the signals of greatly varying intensity with similar signal-to-noise ratios. The linearity of the spectrometer with integration time was confirmed, thus no correction factors were required. Typically, the measurements required for the absorption were performed at an integration time a factor of 20–50 times shorter than that for UC detection. The spectral response of the whole detection system was calibrated using a calibration lamp (Ocean Optics HL-3plus-INT-CAL). For the lifetime measurements a multi-channel scaling (MCS) card was used (PicoQuant Timeharp 260). Quasi-steady state modulation of the diode laser was realized via the laser driver's built-in function generator, and was modulated with a frequency 50 Hz and a duty cycle 50%. In order to monitor the rise and decay times of the UC emission, the TTL signal from the diode laser controller was fed into the MCS card after being appropriately delayed by a home-built delay generator. The PL signal was detected after a double monochromator (Bentham DTMS300) attached to a photon-counting photo-multiplier tube (PMT, Hamamatsu R928P, mounted in temperature cooled housing, Horiba CoolOne) which was in turn attached to the MCS card after appropriate signal-conditioning electronics.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows powder XRD patterns of the un-doped La2O3 reference as well as La1.98−2xO3:xYb3+,1Er3+ (LYE-x, x = 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16) as a function of Yb3+ concentration. In Fig. 1c, for example, a detailed Rietveld analysis of LYE-16 is presented; other Rietveld analyses are in principal identical and therefore not shown. For the un-doped La2O3 reference, the reflection positions match with those of the trigonal RE2O3 and confirm the presence of single phase La2O3 (ICSD No. 100204). The La2O3 trigonal structure is described by the space group Pm1 (164) and La3+ is seven-fold coordinated.32 The XRD patterns obtained for the doped samples show a second phase. Small amount of Yb3+/Er3+ (x ≤ 8) exhibit only trace amounts of the orthorhombic LaYbO3 phase (ICSD no. 15093 with space group Pna21), indicating good phase purity. However, Yb3+/Er3+ doping leads to a phase separation with La2O3/LaYbO3 wt% ratio of ∼5/1 when x = 16. These X-ray analyses indicate that the solubility of Yb3+/Er3+ in La2O3 lattice is limited to ∼8 mol%. It is also noteworthy that all reflections of La2O3 gradually shifted to higher 2θ angles with increasing Yb3+/Er3+ concentration. The (100) reflection, for example, slightly shifts from 26.23° to 26.37° (Fig. 1b). This is also reflected by a change of lattice parameter with in increasing Yb3+/Er3+ concentration from x = 0 to 8: a and c of La2O3 decrease from 3.9311 Å to 3.9105 Å and from 6.1198 Å to 6.1014 Å, respectively. In La2O3 (Pm1) Yb3+/Er3+ partially substituted La3+ ions at a 2d site (12% for x = 8). This demonstrates the effect of the replacement of larger La3+ atoms (1.10 Å in seven-fold coordination) by smaller Er3+/Yb3+ atoms (0.945 Å and 0.925 Å in seven-fold coordination) and the resulting in the contraction of the unit cell of La2O3.33 Since the substitution of La3+ → Er3+/Yb3+ atoms is limited, a higher doping concentration of Yb3+/Er3+ (x ≥ 16) leads to an additional phase separation of La2O3 and LaYbO3.

Fig. 1e presents the diffuse reflectance spectra of La1.98−2xO3:xYb3+,1Er3+ (LYE-x, x = 2, 4, 8 and 16) as a function of Yb3+ concentration. As expected, all samples show the typical absorption profile of Yb3+ (2F7/2 → 2F5/2) with a sharp peak at ∼980 nm and a shoulder at ∼935 nm (Fig. 1e).34,35 Thus, a 980 nm CW LD with power density of 0.5 W cm−2 and bandwidth of ∼2.5 nm is selected as the excitation source to study the UC emission properties. The absorption intensity of Yb3+ in LYE-x increases with Yb3+ concentration up to x = 8. There is no further increase in absorption when using higher Yb3+ doping concentrations (x ≥ 16), most likely due to the aforementioned strong phase separation. Additionally, eight typical narrow absorption bands of Er3+ with maxima at 380, 410, 454, 492, 524, 546, 658 and 804 nm can also be observed, as shown in Fig. 1e. They are attributed to the transitions of Er3+ from the ground state of 4I15/2 to the excited states of 4G11/2,2H11/2, 2H9/2, 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2 and 4I9/2, respectively. The strong absorption intensity of Yb3+ and Er3+ in LYE-x further confirms the incorporation of Yb3+/Er3+ in La2O3 lattices.
Upon excitation with the 980 nm LD, the LYE microcrystals give rise to very bright visible UC emission, ranging from pure green to reddish orange color when observed with the naked eye. The corresponding UC emission profile is dominated by two individual bands, one in the green (centered at ∼530/548 nm) and one in the deep red (centered at ∼672 nm) as shown in Fig. 2a, attributed to the characteristic transitions of Er3+:2H11/2,4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively, both of which are two-photon UC processes.36–38 These two UC emission bands are relatively broad with full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) for green (530/548 nm) and red (672 nm) UC emission is ∼17/16 nm (∼609/527 cm−1) and 18 nm (406 cm−1), respectively. Additionally, weak UC emission in NIR(Er3+:4S3/2 → 4I13/2, also a two-photon process) and extremely weak UC emission in violet (Er3+:2H9/2 → 4I15/2, a three-photon process) with peaks at ∼862 and ∼410 nm, respectively, can also be observed (see more detail in Fig. S2, ESI†). The shape and position of UC emission spectra of LYE-x remain constant, whereas the UC emission intensity in green and red, as well as the intensity ratio of IR/IG, are all highly sensitive to the sintering temperature.

(c) Effect of the sintering temperature on the integrated UC emission intensity (green and red) and intensity ratio (IR/IG), respectively. Lines in (c) are guides for the eye. 
Unexpectedly, the higher sintering temperatures significantly strengthen the UC performance of Er3+ in LYE, which may relate to the decrease of locally clustered Yb3+/Er3+ with increasing sintering temperature. Examining La2O3:2Yb3+,1Er3+ for example, the UC emission intensity of Er3+ in the green and red increase significantly ∼16 and 57 times, respectively, as the sintering temperature increased from 1300 to 1600 °C (Fig. 2a–c). Consequently, the corresponding intensity ratio of IR/IG increases from 0.78 to 2.33 and CIE 1931 chromaticity color coordinate shifts from (0.328, 0.659) to (0.388, 0.599) (Fig. 2c and d, respectively). The colors were observed to vary from pure green to greenish yellow via changing the sintering temperature (Fig. 2d).
In a similar manner, the UC emission properties of LYE-x can be precisely tailored by varying the doping concentration of Yb3+ and Er3+. A high Yb3+ concentration facilitates UC emission in the deep red, whereas low concentrations of Yb3+ and Er3+ lead to stronger green UC emission (Fig. 3a, b and 4a, b). The intensity ratio of IR/IG can also be tuned from 11.2 to 19.4 by increasing the Er3+ concentration from 1 to 4 mol% (Fig. 3c and d). This tuning via the Er3+ concentration can be attributed the increased cross relaxation of Er3+:4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2 enhancing the red emission and decreasing the green emission at higher Er3+ concentrations (see more details in Fig. 5c).39

(e) Excitation power density dependence of Er3+ UC emission at 548 and 672 nm for LYE-8 with power density of 0.05–200 W cm−2. Lines in (c and e) are guides to the eye and linear fitting, respectively. 
For UC in the green and red, the optimal doping concentrations are 2 and 8 mol% for Yb3+, respectively (Fig. 4a and b). The UC emission of LYE-x in the red increases ∼10 times with increasing Yb3+ concentration, when x increases from 1 to 8. The higher Yb3+ concentration (x = 16) results in a ∼20% decrease in UC intensity compared with LYE-8 due to the relatively strong concentration quenching and the aforementioned phase separation (Fig. 4a). Meanwhile, the UC emission intensity in green only slightly increases with Yb2O3 concentration up to x = 2 and higher Yb3+ concentration quenches (x > 2) the green UC emission (Fig. 4a and b). The increase in red UC emission and decrease of green UC emission are mainly ascribed to the increased back energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ (Er3+:4S3/2 + Yb3+:2F7/2 → Er3+:4I13/2 + Yb3+:2F5/2) with increasing Yb3+ concentration. This suppresses the population of green emitting level of Er3+:4S3/2 but populates the intermediate level of Er3+:4I13/2 necessary for red UC emission (Fig. 5c).40–42 Correspondingly, the intensity ratio of IR/IG increases from 0.96 to 11.61 with increasing Yb3+ concentration (Fig. 4c). Consequently, the CIE 1931 chromaticity color coordinate shifts from (0.348, 0.642) to (0.545, 0.443) and thus the visual color by naked eyes tunes from pure green to reddish orange with increasing Yb3+ concentration (Fig. 4d and inset of 4d).

(c) Energy level diagrams of Yb3+ and Er3+, and schematic illustration of UC mechanisms of Yb3+/Er3+ pair under excitation at 980 nm (ET: energy transfer; BET: back energy transfer; CR: cross-relaxation). 
A very wide excitation power density range of 0.05–200 W cm−2 was applied to precisely study the power density dependent UC behavior, as shown in Fig. 4e. The intensity ratio of IR/IG remains almost constant within the applied excitation power density range, hinting at the excellent color stability with excitation power density and the predominantly two-photon nature of both UC emission bands. Fig. 4e shows the dependence of UC intensity as a function of UC excitation power density, yielding four distinct regimes via linear plotting of the double log–log relationship of IUC = μIxin. At low excitation power regime of 0.05–1 W cm−2, an approximate quadratic increase of UC emission intensity at 548 nm (1.88 ± 0.02) and 672 nm (1.93 ± 0.02) with the incident power density is observed. At the intermediate power density regimes of 1–10 W cm−2 and 10–40 W cm−2, the gain of UC emission intensity with excitation power becomes slower, with power factors at 548 nm of 1.46 ± 0.02 and 1.19 ± 0.02, respectively, and at 672 nm of 1.46 ± 0.02 and 1.18 ± 0.02, respectively. The onset of saturation occurs with a power density of 40 W cm−2 for both red and green UC, with strong saturation being observed in the region of 40–200 W cm−2 with the slope on the log–log plot decreasing to 0.84 ± 0.01 (548 nm) and 0.65 ± 0.01 (672 nm).
The absolute internal and external UCQY values were measured with an excitation power density of 7.6 W cm−2, which is well below the saturation power of 40 W cm−2 and easily accessible for the practical applications. The maximum internal and external UCQY of LYE-x is determined to be 3.8% (LYE-2) and 1.6% (LYE-8), respectively (Fig. 4f). Fig. 4f shows the internal and external UCQYs for the LYE-x series. In detail, the internal UCQY of LYE-x increases with Yb3+ concentration from 2.2% (x = 1) to the maximum of 3.8% (x = 2) and then slightly decreases slightly with increasing Yb3+ concentration from 3.8% (x = 2) to 2.9% (x = 16), indicating relatively weak concentration quenching. The external UCQY of LYE-x increases with increasing Yb3+ concentration up to 8 mol% from 0.7% (x = 1) to the maximum of 1.6% (x = 8) due to the increase of absorption with Yb3+ concentration, before decreasing due to concentration quenching. Individually, the maximum internal UCQY of LYE-x for single green and red emission is determined to be 1.4% (x = 2) and 2.9% (x = 8), respectively. The corresponding maximum external UCQY of LYE-x for single green and red is 0.5% (x = 2) and 1.5% (x = 8), respectively. The UC emission lifetime profiles of green (Fig. 5a) and red (Fig. 5b) are composed of a long rise and a short decay process. The rise time and decay lifetime of red is longer that of green with the same Yb3+ concentration. An increase in Yb3+ concentration leads to the decrease in the rise time (rising to the 80% of the maximum) of green and red decreases from 2.6 to 1.7 ms and 4.1 to 2.5 ms, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). The long rise time for red and green UC emission evidences the energy transfer upconversion (ETU) mechanism within the LYE samples (Fig. 5c). The different rise time for UC emission in green and red gives us a room to dynamically tune the UC emission color (IR/IG) by changing the pulse width of 980 nm LD.43 The lifetime of green and red UC emission slightly decreases with Yb3+ concentration from 190 (x = 1) to 85 μs (x = 16) and from 254 (x = 1) to 123 μs (x = 16), respectively, mainly arising from the increased back energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ with increasing Yb3+ concentration, which depopulates the green and red UC emission level of 2S3/2 and 4F9/2, respectively (Fig. 5a–c).44,45
The internal and external UCQY values of our newly developed LYE-x are compared with commercial available Gd2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+ based green UC phosphors from four different companies, Phosphor Technology (UK), MaxMax (USA) and Honeywell Deutschland Holding GmbH (Germany) and the best oxide-based UC materials from the literatures, BaY2ZnO5:7Yb3+,3Er3+ (BYYE) and Ba5Gd8Yn4O21:12Yb3+,4Er3+ (BGYE), in terms of intensity and internal/external UCQY (Fig. 6a–c). The commercial green UC phosphors from four different companies exhibit almost identical UC performance, therefore in the following discussion, only GSYE sample from Maxmax is discussed in detail. Notably, the commercial Gd2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+ phosphors exhibit a low saturation power of ∼1 W cm−2 (Fig. S3, ESI†). Consequently, for UCQY measurement, 6.7 W cm−2 power density was utilized for all samples, except the commercial Gd2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+ where 1 W cm−2 was applied. The absorption peak of all these samples presents at ∼980 nm (2F7/2 → 2F5/2) (Fig. S4, ESI†).
 Fig. 6  (a) Comparisons of UC emission spectra of LYE-2 and LYE-8 with reference materials of Gd2O2S:Yb3+,Er3+ (Maxmax), BaY2ZnO5:7Yb3+,3Er3+ (BYYE) and Ba5Gd8Zn4O21:12Yb3+,4Er3+ (GBYE). The variation of the corresponding (b) integrated UC emission intensity of green, red and sum, and (c) internal and external UCQY. Lines in (b) are guides for the eye. 
The newly developed LYE-8 exhibits the strongest UC emission intensity/brightness and the highest external UCQY of ∼1.6% among all samples (Fig. 4f and 6a). For example, the external UCQY of LYE-8 (1.6%) is ∼20% higher than that of the second strongest BGYE and LSYE (1.4%). For the individual color performance in green and red, LYE-2 and LYE-8 presents the best performance, respectively. For example, the external UPQY in red of LYE-8 in red (1.5%) is about ∼15% stronger than the second strongest GBYE (1.3%). The external UCQY in green for LYE-2 in green (0.5%) is about 25% stronger than that of the second strongest LSYE (0.4%). The internal UCQY value of LYE-2 (3.8%) and LYE-8 (3.2%) is higher than that of BBYE (3.1%), BGYE (2.9%) and Maxmax (1%) (Fig. 6c), higher than that of β-NaYF4:20Yb3+,2Er3+ (3.0 ± 0.3%) with an excitation power density of 20 W cm−2 but lower than the reported highest value of La2O2S:Yb,Er (4.71% in green to red region and 5.83% for the whole UC spectra at a excitation power density of 13 W cm−2).21
The mild hygroscopic nature of La2O3 means that La2O3 is not fully stable in air conditions and slowly react with water in air forming La(OH)3 which is undesirable for UC emission.46 The long term stability of La2O3 has been studied in detail. Our LYE is stable in sealed glass bottle over a period of months, however the UC emission intensity of LYE begins to drop slightly after three days of exposure to the ambient air. Co-doping with small amount of foreign elements, such as Y3+ and Ta5+, is one possible way to improve the stability of La2O3 in air.47,48 A systematic study has been conducted comparing the effect of co-doping with various amounts of more than 30 different elements to stabilize LYE in air, the results of which will be detailed in a later publication.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we present a detailed investigation of RE2O3 hosts co-doped with Yb3+,Er3+ for efficient and bright NIR to visible UC. We focus on the most efficient La2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ (LYE) UC material which exhibits both a high internal as well as external UCQY of 3.8% and 1.6%, respectively, under optimized sintering conditions. The UC emission colors of LYE-x can be precisely tuned from pure green to reddish orange, while a high UCQY is maintained over the whole tunable color range. The UC emission of LYE in red increases ten-fold as Yb3+ concentrations increase from 1 to 8 mol%. This enables the red:green intensity ratio (IR/IG) to be finely tuned via altering the doping concentration of Yb3+ (1–16 mol%). Further tuning, albeit over a smaller range, is possible via changing the sintering temperature (1300–1650 °C) and Er3+ doping concentration (1–32 mol%). The high Yb3+ and Er3+ concentration facilitates the red UC emission, whereas the low Yb3+ and Er3+ concentration benefits the UC emission in green. The finely tuned UC emission while maintaining high efficiency of LYE-x combining the easy preparation suggest their applications in solar energy harvesting, sensors, 3D volumetric displays, solid state lasers and bio-imaging.
