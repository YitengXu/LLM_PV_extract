    , Accepted 4th July 2017First published on 6th July 2017AbstractPlasmonic enhanced dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with metallic nanostructures suffer from corrosion problems, especially with the presence of the iodine/triiodide redox couple in the electrolyte. Herein, we introduce an alternative approach by compensating the corrosion with a modified liquid electrolyte. In contrast to the existing method of surface preservation for plasmonic nanostructures, the redox-controlled electrolyte (RCE) contains iodoaurate intermediates, i.e. gold(I) diiodide (AuI2−) and gold(III) tetraiodide (AuI4−) with optimal concentrations, such that these intermediates are readily reduced to gold nanoparticles during the operation of DSSCs. As corrosion and redeposition of gold occur simultaneously, it effectively provides corrosion compensation to the plasmonic gold nanostructures embedded in the photoanode. Cycling tests of the specific amount of gold contents in the RCE of DSSCs support the fact that the dissolution and deposition of gold are reversible and repeatable. This gold deposition on the TiO2 photoanode results in forming a Schottky barrier (SB) at the metal–semiconductor interface and effectively inhibits the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Therefore, the RCE increases the short-circuit current, amplifies the open-circuit voltage, and reduces the impedance of the TiO2/dye interface. The power conversion efficiency of DSSCs was improved by 57% after incorporating the RCE.
Introduction
With the evolution of the third generation photovoltaic cells, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has been considered as one of the most promising candidates with the merits of easy fabrication and low material cost.1–4 According to Erwin et al.,5 the latest advancement of DSSCs incorporates plasmonic nanostructures as antennas and scatterers to improve the light–dye interaction, thus boosting the power conversion efficiency. The typical DSSC system is based on a sandwiched construction with a photoanode, a counter-electrode and a redox mediator in between. Nanocrystal titanium dioxide (TiO2) with anatase structure is the typical semi-conductive material to fabricate the mesoporous thin film and it is further functionalized with a monolayer of a photochemical dye sensitizer6–8 which plays the crucial role of converting photon energy to electrical current in DSSCs.9 Plasmonic nanostructures are known to possess high optical extinction in the visible spectrum. The plasmonic effect converts the free-space photon to near-field electron oscillation and activates the dye sensitizer via plasmon–molecule coupling, as described by Zarick et al.10 Thus, various types of plasmonic nanostructures were inserted into the photoanode so as to improve the light trapping performance.11 We have also reported plasmonic enhancement to DSSC via self-assembled gold nanoislands12 to both the photoanode and the counter-electrode to enhance light trapping and scattering. Muduli et al.13 showed that DSSCs made with a TiO2–Au nanocomposite had much superior performance than cells made with only TiO2 nanoparticles.
Although it is generally agreed that plasmonic enhancement is helpful to DSSC devices, the solution containing the iodide and triiodide is well-known as the lixiviant of gold.14 So, gold dissolves readily in the electrolyte15 and the plasmonic nanostructures embedded in DSSCs vanish. To protect the plasmonic nanostructures, there are two general approaches. The first method is to encapsulate the metallic core with a corrosion resistant nanoshell which can be made of silicon dioxide (SiO2)16 or titanium dioxide (TiO2).17 However, nanoshells are never perfect and the electrolyte infiltrates and attacks the metallic core eventually, and so the long term durability of encapsulation is questionable. Besides, the thickness of the nanoshell has to be minimized to retain the near-field effect; otherwise the plasmonic enhancement would be diminished. Thus, there is always a dilemma between protection and enhancement. The second approach is to replace the iodide/triiodide electrolyte with expensive solid state hole-transporting material (HTM), i.e. the Spiro-MeOTAD.18 However, the performance of DSSCs with HTM19 was reported to be inferior to the iodide/triiodide electrolyte. So, it is not convincing enough to adapt the solid state technology.
Despite the corrosion problem, there are many reports on successful plasmonic enhancement to iodide/triiodide electrolyte based DSSCs with and without encapsulation.5 Therefore, it would be interesting to explore the electrochemical reactions involving gold with the iodide/triiodide electrolyte. As a lixiviant, the iodide/triiodide solution oxidizes gold to diiodoaurates (AuI2−) and further to tetraiodoaurates (AuI4−) depending on the concentration of iodide (I−) and triiodide (I3−).14 Moreover, it is also feasible to recover gold from the solution14,15 in which the iodoaurates are reduced to gold. In this way, the redox equilibrium of plasmonic enhanced DSSCs can be controlled through the oxidation and reduction of gold from the iodoaurates containing electrolyte. So, a novel redox-controlled electrolyte (RCE) that operates as a redox mediator to reconstruct the gold nanostructures was investigated by a series of electrochemical and photovoltaic experiments as well as field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Experimental
Materials
According to the manufacturer of Iodolyte™ AN-50 (Solaronix SA, Switzerland)20 it consists of 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (10%–25% by weight), iodine (2.5%–10% by weight) and acetonitrile as solvent. In this work, AN50 served as the reference electrolyte. The DSSCs were assembled from test cell kits (Solaronix SA) which consist of FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) glass with a surface resistance of 7 ohm sq−1 for both the photoanode and counter-electrode. The photoanode was prepared by screen-printing for a homogenous surface using Ti-Nanoxide™ pastes and the active layer was fabricated from Ti-Nanoxide T/SP™ covered by a reflective layer of Ti-Nanoxide R/SP™. The active cell dimension is 6 mm2. The counter electrode was prepared by screen-printing for a homogenous surface using the Platisol T/SP™ precursor and a small hole was drilled through the FTO glass for electrolyte filling. The photoanode and the counter-electrode were separated by the Meltonix 1170-60™ sealing gasket of 60 μm thickness and the gasket was tailored to match the shape of the active photoanode area. The filling hole was capped by a glass lid included in the kit. An opaque black mask tailored to match the shape of the active area was used to cover the photoanode to obtain unbiased photovoltaic measurements. These components were included in the test kit and were used without modification.
To prepare the optimized RCE solution, the Iodolyte™ AN-50 electrolyte was placed into several cuvettes with a volume of 1 ml each and different amounts of gold powder (Kurt J. Lesker Company, USA) were added to the cuvettes and kept at room temperature for a few days with continuous stirring. It was observed that the color of the AN-50 electrolyte changed from dark brown to pale yellow with dissolution of the added gold powder. This is due to the consumption of iodine when reacting with gold to form iodoaurate complexes. Different gold contents were added to the same volume of electrolyte, i.e. 0.1 wt%, 0.2 wt%, 0.3 wt%, 0.6 wt%, 0.9 wt%, and 1.2 wt%. Then, the electrochemical properties of the modified electrolyte were investigated and benchmarked against the AN-50 reference. Before assembly, the photoanodes were put in an oven and sintered at 450 °C for 1 hour in air. Then, the photoanodes were allowed to cool slowly to room temperature and immersed into the synthetic dye solution and stained overnight. Ruthenizer 535-bisTBA (known as N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) with a concentration of 3 × 10−4 M in methanol (Anaquachem, USA) and co-absorber (10 × 10−3 M chenodeoxycholic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were used to prepare the dye solution. To fabricate the DSSC, the gasket was sandwiched between the photoanode and counter-electrode and heated to 120 °C for 3 min to seal the cells. Dummy devices were also fabricated with the same configuration except that the photoanode was replaced by a bare FTO glass. The dummy cells were prepared to test the conductivity of the RCE solution of different gold contents.
Methods
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization (POL) measurements were performed with a computer-controlled potentiostat (ZAHNER PP211) equipped with a frequency response analyzer (ZAHNER IM6). CV tests were carried out in a two-electrode configuration with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 from −2.0 V to +2.0 V to the dummy cells. For EIS measurements of the DSSCs, the frequency ranged from 20 mHz to 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 12.5 mV, and the tests were performed under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 irradiation via a solar simulator (Newport 1000 W 69911). The redox potentials of the RCE solutions were evaluated by measuring the polarization (POL, ZAHNER IM6) with a three-electrode photochemical cell K051 (Ida, China) by applying a polarization voltage of 0.7 V across two platinum electrodes. A Ag/AgCl reference electrode with saturated KCl solution and an extended salt bridge was used to protect the reference electrode from direct contact with the iodide/triiodide solution; otherwise the reference electrode will be corroded by the electrolyte. The POL linear scan range was from −1.0 V to +1.0 V in 10 mV steps. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics of DSSCs were obtained by applying −0.2 V to +0.8 V to the cells and measuring the photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA) under AM 1.5 solar irradiation. The valence band edge of gold nanoparticles on the TiO2 photoanode was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5802 system, Physical Electronics) before and after the photovoltaic experiments. To visualize the morphology of the reduced metallic gold nanoparticles on the TiO2 photoanode, a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6335F) was used under the accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV. UV-VIS spectra were evaluated by measuring the absorption of the TiO2 photoanode after a few dissolution/reduction cycles using a UV-VIS (Lambda 2S) spectrophotometer. The absorption spectra were obtained for the range of 400 to 800 nm with a 1 nm interval.
Results and discussion
In the operation of DSSCs, the photo-excited dye sensitizers inject electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 photoanode and the oxidized dye molecules are regenerated by receiving electrons from the iodide/triiodide redox couple. In the electrolyte, iodine binds with iodide to form triiodide in an equilibrium reaction21 and the process can be expressed by I− + I2 ⇌ I3−.(1)
Since all components of eqn (1) are present in the AN-50 electrolyte, the first observation on the addition of gold powder to AN-50 is the change of color. As shown in Fig. 1, the solution decolorized from dark brown to pale yellow with increasing content of gold. The change in color can be explained by the consumption of iodine in the oxidation of gold to diiodoaurate (AuI2−) and then further to tetraiodoaurate intermediates (AuI4−), as shown in eqn (2) and (3).22–26 2Au + I− + I3− ⇌ 2[AuI2]−,(2) [AuI2]− + I2 ⇌ [AuI4]−.(3)
 Fig. 1  The electrolyte Iodolyte™ AN-50 with different gold contents. 
Thus, the overall redox reaction of gold iodide intermediates in eqn (2) and (3) can be expressed as 3[AuI2]− + 2I2 ⇌ 2Au + 2I−3 + [AuI4]−.(4)
Since iodine is consumed, the concentration of iodine in the solution decreased with increasing gold content so that the dark brown color of iodine vanished.
According to the above redox equations, the concentrations of iodide and triiodide were changed by adding gold. It is believed that this change would affect the electrochemical properties of the AN-50 electrolyte. So, it is important to study the electrolyte conductivity before it is actually used in the DSSC. To achieve that, CV tests were performed with dummy cells filled with the AN-50 electrolyte, and RCE of various gold concentrations. Fig. 2 shows the CV test results.
 Fig. 2  CV results of dummy cells containing AN-50 and RCE of various gold contents. 
In comparison with AN-50, it is obvious that the electrical current density is amplified by the RCE. Also, among the three gold concentrations tested, the 0.3 wt% Au CV results were the best. In particular, the current density of 106 mA cm−2 at +1.6 V was obtained for the RCE with 0.3 wt% Au, while that of AN-50 was only about 34 mA cm−2 at the same voltage. For the range of concern for DSSC operation, i.e. from −0.2 to 0.7 V, the 0.3 wt% Au RCE current density attained the maximum of 83 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V whereas AN-50 conducted only 0.5 mA cm−2. It is clear that RCE offered much better conductivity than AN-50. Using the redox equation, i.e.eqn (4), and assuming that there is sufficient concentration of each chemical species in the solution, three electrons can be shuttled by the RCE, whereas only one electron can be transferred by AN-50, as indicated by eqn (1). This explains why the RCE has better electron conductivity than AN-50.
Upon successful determination of the electrolyte conductivity, DSSCs stained with N719 dye and filled with AN-50 and RCE of specific gold concentrations were prepared, as listed in Table 1. Seven DSSC samples were prepared with each of the 7 types of electrolytes in Table 1; thus, there were 49 samples in total. Each DSSC sample was tested with 100% AM 1.5 solar irradiation. The photocurrent density vs. voltage (J–V) and the corresponding power density vs. voltage are presented in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The reference DSSC with AN-50 had short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 8.4 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.62 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.57 and maximum power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.0%. For all RCE samples, the short-circuit currents were amplified. The best performance was observed with 0.3 wt% Au, such that its Jsc was amplified to 10.7 mA cm−2, Voc to 0.7 V, FF to 0.64 and conversion efficiency to 4.7%. It is noted that the power conversion efficiency was improved by about 57% after the introduction of the RCE to the DSSC with the same sensitizer. The error bars in Fig. 3c indicate that the variation of performance was acceptably small for all seven DSSC samples tested. The averaged efficiency and key performance parameters of the DSSCs tested are listed in Table 1.

To investigate the reasons for Jsc amplification, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)27,28 was performed on DSSC samples with 100% AM 1.5 irradiation. According to Han et al.,29,30 the total internal resistance (R) of DSSCs can be described as R = Rh + R1 + R2 + R3,(5)where Rh is the sheet resistance of the TCO glass substrate, R1 depends on the roughness of the platinized counter-electrode, R2 is the carrier transport resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface which exhibits the diode-like behavior, and R3 is related to the diffusion resistance which is inversely proportional to the electrolyte conductivity and directly proportional to the distance between the photoanode and counter-electrode. The EIS results of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  (a) EIS data of DSSCs with RCE containing different gold contents under AM 1.5 solar irradiation, (b) magnified EIS plot to illustrate the reduction of internal resistance with 0.3 wt% Au in the RCE. 
Upon 100% AM 1.5 irradiation, the total internal resistance with the RCE of 0.3 wt% gold content was reduced dramatically as shown in the Nyquist plots in Fig. 4a and b. According to eqn (5), the total internal resistance R is determined as the sum of all semicircles spanning across the Z′ axis which was about 78 Ω for AN-50 and 20 Ω for the RCE with 0.3 wt% Au, respectively. According to the model of Han et al., the constant value of Rh was estimated to be 5 Ω for all the DSSCs since the same TCO glass substrates were used for all cells. The span of the first semicircle, i.e. R1, is about 2 Ω for all DSSCs because the platinized counter-electrodes are of the same surface roughness. Fig. 4a and b show that R2 was remarkably reduced from approximately 40 Ω for AN-50 to approximately 10 Ω for the RCE, which means that the electron transport resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface was also reduced substantially. R3 also dropped from approximately 30 Ω to 5 Ω with the RCE. This is in agreement with the CV measurement showing better conductivity for the RCE than that for AN-50. With R2 and R3 both reduced, the total internal resistance of the DSSC was reduced for the RCE.
In addition to the amplification of short-circuit photocurrent shown in Fig. 3a, the open-circuit voltages Voc of the DSSC were also increased with the RCE. This appears to be surprising because in our previous report,12 the Voc of plasmonic enhanced DSSCs with gold–TiO2@core–shell nanoislands was decreased, when compared to the reference cell. So, there are mechanisms with the RCE which alter the Voc and they are worth investigating. The Voc of the DSSC was determined by the energy difference between two key parameters of the system,6i.e. (1) the conduction band edge (CBE) of the TiO2 semiconductor against the vacuum level and (2) the redox potential (RP) of the electrolyte against the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). It is believed that the improvement to Voc is related to the redox of the iodoaurate intermediates. According to the equilibrium condition of eqn (4), gold can be recovered from iodoaurate intermediates.
Since the RCE is directly in contact with the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode, it is feasible to deposit gold onto TiO2 provided that the concentration of AuI2− is sufficient and the reaction shown in eqn (4) goes from left to right, to produce AuI2−, I3− and AuI4−. This is practical because the specification of the AN-50 electrolyte states that there is 2.5% to 10% of I2 by weight in the electrolyte and the AuI4− intermediate is unstable and readily decomposes into AuI2− and I2, according to eqn (3). So, with sufficient I2 and AuI2−, it is feasible to recover gold from the RCE and deposit gold nanoparticles onto the TiO2 photoanode during the operation of the DSSC. These reduced gold nanoparticles play the key role of the plasmonic enhancement. It is clear from the investigations summarized in Table S1 of the ESI† that the plasmonic effect of DSSCs was enhanced with additional gold nanostructures. However, no investigation was made regarding the electrochemical reactions between gold and iodide/triiodide. In our present situation, although such deposition will definitely reduce the gold concentration in the electrolyte, eqn (2) suggests that gold will be dissolved back to the electrolyte when the DSSC is not operating. So, effectively, the loss of gold by iodine corrosion is compensated for by gold re-deposition; thereby the performance of RCE should be ensured in the long run.
To demonstrate the corrosion compensation mechanism, the stability of plasmonic enhanced DSSCs using gold nanoislands was investigated with and without RCE by cycling tests. The cells were subjected to 100% AM 1.5 irradiation continuously for 8 hours, and were then allowed to recover for 8 hours in total darkness. This was repeated for several cycles with J–V measurements recorded every 30 minutes. As shown in Fig. 5, 16 measurements were taken during the 8 hours of continuous operation; the different color plots represent the short circuit current density measured during each of the 8 hours’ operation interval. The gold nanoislands were fabricated on the TiO2 photoanode via a self-assembly technique as described in our previous report.12 It was mentioned before that when studying the effect of gold concentration on the RCE, it was found that 0.3 wt% Au RCE performed best. If such an RCE is used in a DSSC that had been plasmonically enhanced with gold nanoislands, a smaller gold concentration in the RCE should be used. So, a DSSC with gold nanoislands prefabricated on the TiO2 photoanode was filled with 0.1 wt% Au RCE to provide a total gold content of approximately 0.3 wt% to provide the best result.
 Fig. 5

According to Fig. 5a, Jsc decreased from 10.7 to 8.7 mA cm−2 gradually after 8 hours of irradiation, but resumed almost full performance to 10.5 mA cm−2 after being idle for 8 hours in the dark. This is supporting evidence that the gold content in the RCE is continuously depleted from the electrolyte and deposited onto the photoanode during the operation cycle. However, once the circuit is switched off, gold will be dissolved gradually back to the RCE. As indicated by Fig. 5a, the dissolution and deposition of gold are reversible and repeatable. Moreover, it also suggests that most of the adsorbed dye molecules remain intact on the TiO2 photoanode; otherwise the photocurrent density should have irreversibly deteriorated. On the contrary, as shown in Fig. 5b, Jsc with AN-50 electrolyte decreased dramatically from 10.5 to 7.1 mA cm−2 despite being given the same recovery periods, which means the gold nanoislands were corroded and the plasmonic effect vanished. Although the same redox reactions might have occurred, the total gold content in the cell was too low to enable the recovery of gold nanoparticles on the photoanode. It is also believed that the improvement of the DSSCs was originated from (1) the higher electron conductivity due to gold ions in the electrolyte, and (2) plasmonic enhancement of metallic gold nanoparticles. By the observation of Fig. 5a, it appears that the plasmonic enhancement effect is dominant.
Thus, by controlling the gold content in the RCE, the concentration of AuI2− can be adjusted to optimize for the deposition of gold nanoparticles onto the TiO2 nanocrystals. The consequence is the formation of a gold–TiO2 nanoheterojunction and the creation of a Schottky barrier (SB) which alters the CBE at the gold–TiO2 interface.31,32 In solid state physics,33,34 the Schottky barrier height (SBh) can be approximately expressed by the following equation: SBh = Ecf − Eci,(6)where Ecf is the final CBE of the TiO2 nanocrystal in contact with the gold nanoparticles and Eci is the TiO2 initial CBE before contact with the gold nanoparticles. After photovoltaic measurements, the DSSC devices were disassembled, rinsed with acetonitrile, dried in pure nitrogen flow, and subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 6a, gold was found to exist on the TiO2 photoanode with clear evidence of Au 4f peaks with amplitudes proportional to the gold contents. According to Scanlon et al.,35 there was a general consensus that the band gap of anatase TiO2 was about 3.20 eV. Besides, the conduction band (Ec) is the sum of the valence band edge (Ev) and the band gap. So, eqn (6) can be modified as SBh = Evf − Evi,(7)by assuming that gold nanoparticle deposition on TiO2 does not change the band gap. In Fig. 6b, right-shifting of the XPS spectra towards the negative end provides a strong evidence for the existence of SBh as both the Ev and Ef were shifted by redepositing gold nanoparticles on TiO2. Evf, Evi and SBh were calculated according to Fusi et al.36 with data shown in Fig. 6b and listed in Table 2. Thus, with the existence of SBh, the Voc of RCE filled cells was increased due to the enlargement of Ecf on the TiO2 nanocrystals with nanogold redeposition.

To further verify the morphology of gold nanoparticles deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed. Fig. 7a shows the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles. Most TiO2 nanoparticles appear fairly spherical. The diameter is estimated to be about 100 nm. Fig. 7b indicates that the self-assembled gold nanoislands were formed fairly evenly on the TiO2 grains. The size of the nanoislands is estimated to be between 20 and 50 nm. Fig. 7c depicts the SEM image of gold nanoparticles redeposited on the TiO2 photoanode, from the DSSC after cycling tests. The morphology difference is clearly visible: gold nanoparticles are stacked and formed near the top of the TiO2 layer. The nanoparticles, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 7c, are about 30 nm in size. In addition, the UV-VIS absorbance spectra of these photoanodes were used to characterize the light trapping performance of the gold nanostructures, as exhibited in Fig. 7d. It is observed that both self-assembled gold nanoislands and redeposited gold nanoparticles possess enhanced absorption in the visible spectrum. The absorbance peaks of self-assembled gold nanoislands and redeposited gold nanoparticles are located at 560 nm and 550 nm, respectively.

The redox potentials (RP) of the AN-50 electrolyte and RCE with 0.3 wt% Au were examined by using polarization (POL) measurements, as shown in Fig. 8. To minimize the corrosion to the Ag/AgCl electrode, both electrolytes were diluted by 100 times with acetonitrile and identical platinum foils were used as the working and counter electrodes, respectively. The RP of the diluted RCE is 0.12 V in comparison with 0.08 V of the diluted AN-50. Thus, the magnitude of the RCE RP was decreased by 0.04 V. This increased the potential difference between Ec and RP, and thus enlarged the Voc.37–39

By combining the XPS and POL measurements, the underlying mechanism to the Voc improvement is clarified. The formation of the gold–TiO2 nano-heterojunction produces the SB which bends the gold–TiO2 interfacial CBE upwards. Besides, the redox potential of the RCE shifts downwards so that it further increases the potential difference between the TiO2Ec and the electrolyte RP. By combining these two contributions, the Voc of the DSSC with RCE is therefore increased. The SB also inhibits the backward recombination of the injected electron towards the oxidized dye-sensitizers and the iodide/triiodide complexes; therefore, it is also responsible for the reduction of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface resistance R2, as shown in Fig. 4b. The overall operation mechanism of the RCE electrolyte with the formation of a gold–TiO2 nano-heterojunction is summarized in Scheme 1. By enlarging Voc and amplifying Jsc, the total photovoltaic conversion efficiency was increased by the RCE.
 Scheme 1  A simplified illustration of the enhanced mechanism of the DSSC via deposition of gold nanoparticles to the TiO2 surface via the RCE. 
However, if the gold content in the RCE is excessive, too much gold will be deposited on the TiO2 nanocrystal and it would eventually block the contact between the dye-sensitizer and TiO2. Then, it will be impossible to inject electrons into the photoanode so that the photovoltaic performance decreases. This is in good agreement with the data shown in Table 1 such that the 1.2 wt% Au performs inferiorly to 0.3 wt% Au. In fact, we have also shown in our previous report12 that excessive gold deposition to the TiO2 photoanode actually hampers the plasmonic enhancement, and we believe that the same reason is applicable.
Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, we introduce a redox-controlled electrolyte (RCE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In contrast to other conventional methods, for instance, surface preservation with nanoshell encapsulation which is never a long term solution, the RCE can remarkably protect the gold nanostructures by redeposition of gold metal from the iodoaurate containing electrolyte. Further analyses revealed that optimizing the gold content in the RCE solution enables the redeposition of metallic gold element on the TiO2 photoanode and supports the stabilities during the operation of the DSSC, thus forming a Schottky barrier (SB) at the gold–TiO2 interface. The SB effectively increases the open circuit voltage and retards the recombination of the electron–hole pairs. Therefore, the RCE amplified the short-circuit current, and improved the power conversion efficiency. Our findings may pave a new way towards the development of plasmonic enhanced DSSCs with a corrosion-free electrolyte for various applications.
