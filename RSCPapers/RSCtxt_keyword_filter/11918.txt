One of the drawbacks of perovskite solar cells is their limited stability in non-inert atmospheres. In the inverted device configuration this lack of stability can be attributed to the inclusion of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transporting layer. Herein we report the synthesis of two new triarylamine based hole transporting materials, synthesised from readily available starting materials. These new materials show increased power conversion efficiencies, of 13.0% and 12.1%, compared to PEDOT:PSS (10.9%) and exhibit increased stability achieving lifetimes in excess of 500 hours. Both molecules are solution processible at low temperatures and show potential for low cost, scalable production of large scale perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained recognition as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies due to their remarkable increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to 21.1% in a short period of time.1,2 The main component of the majority of perovskite solar cells up to now has been organic amine lead halide derivatives with an ABX3 perovskite structure (A: (CH3NH3)+, B: Pb2+, X: Cl−, Br− or I−). More recently, the methyl ammonium ion is being replaced with more stable counterions such as the caesium cation due to increased thermal and structural stability.3,4 Perovskites have several advantageous properties, which contribute to their impressive performance, including: high light absorption,5,6 good charge mobility7,8 and small exciton binding energy.9 The inverted device structure usually comprises two organic charge transport layers, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron transporting material and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transporting layer. Inverted architecture devices can be processed at relatively low temperatures (∼120 °C)10 compatible with flexible substrates. Therefore PSCs show potential to be manufactured at a low cost11,12 and at an industrial scale. The main drawback to this type of device architecture is the inclusion of PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, which is not optimal due to its inefficient electron-blocking properties and limited chemical stability arising from its acidity and highly hygroscopic nature.13–15 Replacing PEDOT:PSS with a more stable HTL is therefore a viable option to improve inverted perovskite devices. New hole transporting materials must be easily synthetically scalable, soluble in a variety of process compatible solvents and have excellent electron blocking and hole transporting properties, exhibiting at the same time high charge carrier mobilities.
In this case we report the application of two solution processed triarylamine based small molecule semiconductors easily synthesised from common starting materials. Triarylamines have been utilised extensively in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),16,17 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)18 and photovoltaics19 due to their excellent transport properties, thermal and chemical stability but also their suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in relation to the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite semiconductor valence band. Usually these triarylamines are used to flank a central core, with little through conjugation, which allows for tuning of the optoelectronic properties of the molecule by changing the substituents on the arylamine. In this case we chose biphenyl and naphthalene as the central cores flanked by two N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline groups as shown in Fig. 1a, along with calculated density functional theory (DFT) measurements. Complete structural and thermal characterisation was performed using standard techniques including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and thermal gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC). Detailed synthetic methods and characterisation are included in the ESI.†

UV-Vis absorption data of both thin-film and solution for NTPA and BTPA were obtained, and are shown in Fig. 1b. A red shift between solution and film is observed, which is indicative of increased aggregation in thin film layers with stronger π → π* transitions, hence decreasing the optical band gap (Eg). Ionization potential values for PEDOT:PSS, NTPA and BTPA were obtained using Photo-Electron Spectroscopy in Air (PSEA). When the optical band gap (Eg) is subtracted from those values electron affinities can be estimated. The experimental data are summarised in Table 1. The IPs of NTPA and BTPA are −5.27 eV and −5.20 eV respectively, and as both lie between the IP of the perovskite (−5.36 eV) and the work function of ITO (−4.76 eV), both molecules can provide sufficient hole extraction capabilities within the PSC. The electron affinities give an indication of the LUMO, lying at −2.34 eV and −2.20 eV for NTPA and BTPA respectively. Both are sufficiently high enough to provide an electron blocking function between the perovskite photoactive layer and ITO within the PSC. It should be noted that the stated electron affinity of PEDOT:PSS is based upon optical data obtained; however PEDOT:PSS contains intraband states due to the PSS dopant and polymer organisation in the solid state exhibiting a semi-metallic state.20,21 This allows electron transfer between the perovskite semiconductor absorbing layer and the ITO electrode, where charge recombination can occur, inhibiting device performance. The respective energy levels are schematically depicted in Fig. 1c. A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows the fully optimized champion device employing NTPA as the hole transporting layer (HTL) in Fig. 1d. The p-type NTPA or BTPA and n-type PCBM transporting layers sandwich the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorbing layer. As shown in the SEM image, the HTL is of very low thickness, on the order of tens of nanometres, which was determined by scanning profilometry; the layers in the cross-section have been post-imaging coloured to add increased layer contrast.

In order to determine the charge carrier mobility for the NTPA and BTPA, hole-only devices were fabricated with the ITO/HTL/MoOx/Ag structure, where the devices were tested under similar conditions to that of the optimised photovoltaic devices.
Hole mobilities were extracted using the modified Mott–Gurney equation below:  where JSCLC is the measured current density, ε0 and εr are defined as the vacuum permittivity and material dielectric constant, respectively, L is the film thickness, μ is the hole mobility, and β is the field activation parameter. A significant change in mobility was observed between as deposited and annealed HTLs, 8.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for NTPA and 8.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for BTPA as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). These values are higher than mobilities of undoped spiro-oMeTAD, PTAA (polytriarylamine) compounds and other HTMs reported in the literature.22–24
The incorporation of high mobility cores, as previously mentioned, which can assemble in closely packed arrangements, allows for a high degree of intermolecular charge transfer and hence a higher charge carrier mobility.25 The preferential molecular tuning of small molecules over polymer units allowed for the addition of finely tuned triarylamines, providing the optimized energy levels for hole transfer and extraction. Comparing the AFM images between the NTPA and BTPA molecules (Fig. S6, ESI†), the former shows an increase in surface roughness. This may be indicative of larger crystalline domains post annealing, accounting for the higher mobility observed in NTPA films. Additionally, it has been previously demonstrated by Bi et al. that the growth of perovskite grains with high aspect ratios on non-wetting HTLs can be achieved by solution based methods, allowing for thin film solar cells demonstrating reduced charge recombination at grain boundaries.26 Contact angle measurements (Fig. S10, ESI†) demonstrated that both NTPA and BTPA are hydrophobic, which assisted the development of perovskite crystal films with larger aspect ratios than with PEDOT:PSS, as shown by top view SEM images (Fig. 3a–c), with perovskite crystal domains increase in size moving from PEDOT:PSS < BTPA < NTPA.
In order to further analyze the crystal size, X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on perovskite films coated on top of HTLs. Peaks at 14.27° and 28.58° 2θ-angles are associated with (110) and (220) crystal planes of perovskite, as indicated in Fig. 3d. Both NTPA and BTPA based perovskite layers exhibit higher peak intensities in comparison with patterns obtained with PEDOT:PSS as the hole transporting material, suggesting the presence of larger crystalline domains (Fig. 3d inset), which facilitates the ability for higher charge carrier density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), a statement also supported by top view SEM and J/V characteristics.
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using the B3LYP/6-31g* basis set (Fig. S11, ESI†) are in excellent agreement with experimental data concerning high lying LUMOs for NTPA and BTPA molecules explaining favourable electron blocking properties. The latter, in combination with high hole mobility values, creates the potential for these HTMs to exhibit high device performance, when replacing PEDOT:PSS in a PSC. Devices were fabricated with a typical inverted structure, with the device architecture depicted in Fig. 1d. The HTL was spin coated from a chlorobenzene solution onto an ITO-coated substrate, and PEDOT:PSS was used as purchased in aqueous solution. The optimization process of the HTL involved both thickness variation and thermal annealing effects. The perovskite layer was deposited using a one-step, fast crystallization method. Subsequently, PCBM was deposited via spin coating from chlorobenzene with a final 100 nm of silver deposited on top of the device structure via thermal evaporation. Optimal layer thicknesses were determined to be ∼30 nm of the HTL, 70 nm for the PCBM and 200 nm for the CH3NH3PbI3, which is in accordance with the literature.27,28 The devices were tested under calibrated AM1.5G solar illumination, where the device performance of the new HTL materials was shown to outperform that of the PEDOT:PSS reference device. The processing steps for full device fabrication are available in the ESI.†

Fig. 2a shows current density vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic devices employing NTPA, BTPA and PEDOT:PSS as HTLs. Device performance showed little variation when statistically analysed (Fig. S3a and b, ESI†), indicating good reproducibility with maximum obtained power conversion efficiencies of 13.0% and 12.1% for NTPA and BTPA devices respectively. Table 2 summarizes the champion device performance of each HTL. The obtained Jsc values for both NTPA and BTPA significantly exceed that of PEDOT:PSS. This is likely due to the enhanced electron blocking properties and the high charge carrier mobilities along with reduction in charge recombination due to larger average perovskite grain size for the novel HTM based devices over PEDOT:PSS devices. The new HTMs allow for a greater degree of charge extraction and hence improved Jsc. This is also evident in the EQE data (Fig. 2b). EQE curves of the newly synthesized HTM based devices, when compared to those with PEDOT:PSS, exhibit higher current generation in the UV region. Devices made with NTPA and BTPA exhibit no pronounced differences, with the quantum efficiency reaching values in the region of 75%. In line with this increased Jsc when average device statistics were analysed an increased fill factor was observed due to the high charge carrier mobilities and electron blocking ability of the two novel synthesised HTMs. The Voc values are concordant with the determined IPs with NTPA providing the greatest Voc and lowest IP, followed by BTPA and PEDOT:PSS respectively. As shown in the ESI† the devices show some hysteresis (Fig. S1, ESI†), with power conversion efficiency (PCE) values lacking in the reverse to forward bias (RB–FB) measurement when compared to that of the forward to reverse bias (FB–RB). This decrease is mainly attributed to fill factor reduction from 70.8% to 63.7% for NTPA and 73.3% to 66.5% for BTPA based perovskite devices. Hysteresis has been shown to be significantly influenced by time-dependant capacitive current.29 Furthermore the device stability was measured at the maximum power point over 60 seconds (Fig. S2, ESI†) and showed no degradation, indicating a stable perovskite layer, with the ability for continual charge extraction. Over 50 devices were fabricated and were statistically consistent with the champion devices with minimal variation as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

PEDOT:PSS based devices show a deficiency in shunt resistance (Rshunt) when compared to BTPA and NTPA, with calculated values around 9, 15 and 32 kΩ cm2 as shown in Table 2. Alternative current pathways are present in the device and a bimolecular recombination of charge carriers may occur. As already discussed, the inability of PEDOT:PSS for efficient electron blocking, as well as pin-hole formation at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface highlights the need for novel HTL materials. Relatively low series resistance (Rseries) was observed for the new HTM based devices and mainly attributed to high hole mobility, due to favourable packing of the molecules. Lifetime evaluation of perovskite solar cell devices without any encapsulation employing NTPA and BTPA was performed over a period of time (Fig. S4, ESI†). Devices were stored in a nitrogen glovebox and even after 30 days, the device performance of both HTLs exhibited only a small reduction of less than 15%. This strongly suggests the suitability of these novel HTLs for more stable and long lasting perovskite devices.
In conclusion, high mobility HTM molecules, in the order of 10−3 V cm−1 s−1, and strong electron blocking properties in molecular design have been shown to improve the device performance over PEDOT:PSS in an inverted perovskite structure. Power conversion efficiencies of 13.0% and 12.1% were achieved for NTPA and BTPA, respectively, which are easily solution processed at low temperatures with high stability, a lifetime in excess of 500 hours and low material cost provide the potential for future scalable processes and application on flexible substrates in large scale perovskite solar cells.
