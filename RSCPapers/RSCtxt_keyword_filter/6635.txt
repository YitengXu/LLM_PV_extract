    , Accepted 21st December 2016First published on 21st December 2016AbstractFor bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs), appropriate concentration distribution and phase separation of the donor and acceptor molecules within the polymer:fullerene blends are crucial for effective exciton dissociation and charge transportation. Herein, we introduce a selectively dissolvable solvent 2-chlorophenol to finely tune the vertical concentration distribution of fullerene within the photoactive layer. The morphology of the photoactive layer is investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy (SKPM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. The optimized three-dimensional concentration distribution is further investigated by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF SIMS). To investigate the effect of vertical concentration distribution on the photovoltaic performance, conventional and inverted structured PSCs are fabricated. Compared with the control device without modulation of the concentration distribution, the short circuit current density (Jsc) increased from 13.19 to 18.50 mA cm−2 and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased from 6.18% to 10.15% for the inverted device with 2-chlorophenol flush treatment due to the greatly enhanced charge transportation and reduced exciton recombination. Our findings indicate that simple 2-chlorophenol flush treatment is a feasible and effective way to acquire an optimal vertical composition profile of photoactive blends for high performance inverted PSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) based on a conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative have been considered as an attractive and promising approach to solve the energy and environment issues, due to their light-weight, low-cost, flexibility, rapid energy payback time and high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing.1–4 The most important advantage of BHJ configuration is the increased donor–acceptor interfaces, which makes most of the excitons travel to reach the heterojunction interface within the exciton diffusion length, resulting in an improved exciton dissociation efficiency, and thus the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ-PSCs has been exceeded by 12% since the concept of BHJ was proposed in 1995.5–8
The working principle of BHJ-PSC involves four primary electron processes: light absorption (exciton generation), exciton diffusion, charge transfer (exciton dissociation) and charge collection.9 These processes are greatly influenced by the morphology and the concentration distribution of the BHJ blends, since the interpenetrating network of donor–accepter BHJs provide exciton dissociation interfaces and charge transport pathways, which are crucial for further improvement of the device performance.10,11 An ideal BHJ blend should not only prompt exciton drift towards the interface of the donor and acceptor for efficient dissociation, but also offer continuous and unhindered pathways for easy carrier transport to the corresponding electrode. Appropriate concentration distribution and phase separation of the donor and acceptor molecules both in lateral and vertical directions are desired. Therefore, morphology optimization and concentration distribution engineering are both feasible methods to enhance the performance of the BHJ-PSCs.
The optimization of lateral morphology has drawn more attention in the past decade. For example, high boiling point and nonvolatile solvent (cyclohexanone or styrene) has been selected to prolong the self-assembling and crystallizing time of the donor and acceptor components.12 High boiling point additive with different solubilities in the donor and acceptor was added into the mixed solution to control the phase separation of the donor and acceptor during film formation by spin-coating.13 However, compared with the optimization of lateral morphology, there are few reports about the investigation of the vertical direction of the composite films. Recently, a series of characterization techniques, such as variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE),14 neutron reflectivity (NR),15 X-ray reflectivity (XRR),16 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),17 near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF SIMS) have been utilized to investigate the vertical composition profile in the BHJ blends.14,18,19 These findings indicate that P3HT and PCBM tend to separate during spin-coating due to their difference in surface energy. The polymer donor (P3HT) clusters at the upper section of film (lower surface energy) and PCBM gathers at the bottom of the photoactive layer (higher surface energy). This inhomogeneous distribution can also be found in other polymer blend systems such as PTB7:PC71BM.16,20–22 Obviously, this kind of concentration distribution has a detrimental effect on the separation and collection of carriers for a conventional device structure, in which the active layer is sandwiched between the PEDOT:PSS-coated indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and low work function metal cathode.
In order to modulate the vertical phase separation and the morphology of BHJ blends, a series of processing techniques such as solvent vapor annealing, thermal annealing, additive treatment, and inert solvent flush have been developed for conventional and inverted PSCs.12,13,23–25 The inverted configuration can improve the environmental stability by replacing the acidic PEDOT:PSS and readily oxidizable low work function metal cathode.26 For inverted devices, the vertical concentration distribution of the polymer donor gathered on the top and fullerene acceptor aggregation underneath should facilitate carrier transportation and reduce their recombination, inducing enhanced short-circuit current.27 For instance, 2,2,3,3,4,4,4-heptafluoro-N-phenyl-butyr-amide (F-ADD) was introduced in P3HT:PC60BM blends to change the surface energy of P3HT and PC60BM, accomplishing vertical phase separation.28 A mixed solvent soaking approach was used to modulate the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM blend film, in which an interpenetrating network composed of highly crystalline P3HT and PCBM nano-aggregates was obtained.17 More recently, a low volatile solvent was utilized to dissolve the active materials (P3HT, PC60BM) and the mixed solution was placed in air for a period of time before spin-coating to accelerate the vertical distribution of photoactive ingredients.29 A layer-by-layer processed strategy can construct a three-dimensional vertical phase separation morphology straightforwardly, while the efficiency is still lower than that of devices based on blend films.30 So it is a challenge to acquire BHJ blends with an ideal morphology and perfect concentration distribution.
Herein, we introduced a 2-chlorophenol:isopropanol (IPA) mixed solvent to flush the BHJ blends of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenealt-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) to control the morphology and the vertical concentration of the photoactive layer. IPA was used to remove the residual additive of DIO in the blends, and 2-chlorophenol was used to remove the PCBM on the top surface of the photoactive layer due to its selective solubility in PCBM and PTB7-Th.31–33 Flushed by a quite diluted 2-chlorophenol:IPA solvent, a vertical concentration distribution within the PTB7-Th:PC71BM photoactive layer with good morphology was achieved, where a PTB7-Th pure film resides on the top of the photoactive layer and PCBM aggregates underneath the photoactive layer. With this concentration distribution, a spatially uninterrupted pathway for the transport of charge carriers to their corresponding electrodes can be formed, thus charge recombination at the electrodes can be greatly reduced for inverted PSCs, resulting in a greatly enhanced PCE of 10.15% in comparison with the control device of 6.18%.34
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Device design

Fig. 1a shows the inverted device structure with a configuration of ITO/TIPD/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Al, where titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD) works as the electron extraction interfacial layer, MoO3 works as the hole extraction layer, and 2-chlorophenol:IPA mixed solvent flushed PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend works as the photoactive layer.35 The molecular structures of PTB7-Th, PC71BM and 2-chlorophenol are displayed in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c gives the energy levels of the materials involved in the devices. As shown in Fig. 1c, when the photoactive layer of PTB7-Th:PC71BM absorbs photons, photo-generated excitons will be produced, and then they diffuse towards and dissociate at the PTB7-Th/PC71BM interfaces to yield free electrons and holes. The electrons can easily transport from the photoactive layer to the ITO electrode through the TIPD electron extraction layer due to the similar lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PC71BM (−3.91 eV) and TIPD (−3.9 eV). Meanwhile, the work-function of MoO3 is −5.4 eV, which is 0.2 eV lower than that of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PTB7-Th (−5.2 eV), and this facilitates hole transfer from the active layer to the Al electrode through MoO3. Therefore, the device could show high charge collection on both electrodes.

2.2. Morphology of the photoactive layer
The morphology of the photoactive layer reflects the aggregation behavior of the donor and acceptor, which greatly impacts on the charge transport within the photoactive layer and also influences the contact properties with the adjacent charge extraction layer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the morphology of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film as shown in Fig. 2. For comparison, four kinds of PTB7-Th:PC71BM films were fabricated with different solvent flush treatments: (1) without solvent flush, (2) flushed by pure IPA, (3) flushed by pure methanol, and (4) flushed by diluted 2-chlorophenol. As we can see from the AFM images (Fig. 2a–h), there is no significant difference in the morphology of photoactive layers flushed by pure methanol and by pure IPA from the topography and phase images. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film without any flush treatment is pretty smooth and flat. With 2-chlorophenol flush treatment, the mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM layer modestly reduces from 1.31 (without solvent flush) to 1.02 nm. However, there is a significant difference in the corresponding phase images (Fig. 2e–h). Flushing by 2-chlorophenol (IPA) results in a smaller grain size than the other three cases, which should be beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge carrier transportation, since if the grain size greatly exceeds the short exciton diffusion length, it is easier to cause charge-carrier recombination.30,36,37 TEM is a powerful technique to identify the polymer and fullerene aggregation in the photoactive layer of PSCs.23 As depicted in Fig. 2i–l, we can note that the TEM image of 2-chlorophenol flushed film appears more intensive line pattern than the other conditions, indicating that more of PTB7-Th is exposed on the surface of the photoactive layer after 2-chlorophenol flush treatment, while IPA introduces no obvious changes on the morphology in comparison with the film without flush treatment. To have a more clear contrast of the 2-chlorophenol impacts on the surface morphology of the photoactive layer, a TEM image of the film flushed three times by 2-chlorophenol dilute solution is presented in Fig. 2l, where more cavities and prominent networks appear, indicating that a large proportion of PC71BM has been removed and more PTB7-Th is exposed on the surface of the photoactive layer by 2-chlorophenol flush.

To further verify the complete morphology change induced by solvent treatment, Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy (SKPM) was applied to probe the changes in surface potential before and after solvent flush treatment,38 and the surface potential images are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The surface potential of pure PTB7-Th and PC71BM films are 200 and 314 mV, respectively. After spin-coating 2-chlorophenol (IPA), the surface potential of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film decreased to 131 mV, much lower than that flushed by methanol (160 mV) and IPA (156 mV). The changes in surface potential can also be identified directly from different color shades of the images in the same potential range. The surface potential change also confirms that more PTB7-Th resides on the top of the blend films with 2-chlorophenol flush treatment. Such results can enhance the built-in potential for inverted PSCs, and the actual potential across the whole device should be strengthened.
To further confirm the change in the surface concentration induced by 2-chlorophenol flush, water contact angle (WCA) measurement was introduced. As the conjugated polymer PTB7-Th and fullerene derivative PC71BM have different surface energies, the WCA can qualitatively reflect the concentration of each component in the blend film. Fig. 3 displays the WCA images of the pure PTB7-Th film, pure PC71BM film as well as PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films flushed with different solvents. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the WCAs of pure PTB7-Th and PC71BM films are 97.82° and 82.73°, respectively, indicating that PTB7-Th has a much lower surface energy than PC71BM and manifests stronger hydrophobic properties. Generally speaking, for the blend film, the closer the WCA is to one pure component, the more the distribution of this component on the surface of the blend film. In our case, the WAC of the blend film without solvent flush is 94.77° (Fig. 3c), which is much large than that of pure PC71BM (82.73°) and lower than that of pure PTB7-Th (97.82°), indicating that more PTB7-Th and less PC71BM distribute on the surface of the blend film. This finding is in good agreement with previous reports of vertical phase separation via spin-coating.39 The WCA of pure IPA flushed blend film is 94.52° (Fig. 3d), very similar to that of the none flushed film (94.77°), indicating that only IPA flushing cannot change the concentration distribution of the blend film. In contrast, for the 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flushed blend film (Fig. 3e), the WCA increases to 96.25°, which is much closer to that of the pure PTB7-Th film, indicating that there are more PTB7-Th aggregates on the surface of the blend film by 2-chlorophenol flushing, thus resulting in a more hydrophobic surface.

2.3. Internal concentration distribution
As aforementioned, the surface concentration distributions of the blend films have been investigated by AFM, TEM and WCA measurements. To further investigate the concentration distribution of PTB7-Th and PC71BM within the blend film after 2-chlorophenol flush, the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF SIMS) measurement was carried out. Since sulfur (S) and fullerene cage (C70) are characteristic species for PTB7-Th and PC71BM, respectively, we compared the intensity change in the signals of S and C70 with sputter time. As shown in Fig. 4a, for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film flushed by 2-chlorophenol IPA solution, the content of S− species declines rapidly and almost no C70 has been detected before the sputtering time of 400 s, indicating that PTB7-Th distributes on the surface of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film and the surface PC71BM was removed by 2-chlorophenol flush. With further increasing the sputtering time to over 400 s, both S and C70 signals can be detected and the signal of C70 is much higher than that of S near the bottom, indicating that acceptor materials PC71BM gather at the bottom of the active film and increase with increasing depth. Considering that the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films can form vertical phase separation spontaneously even without any solvent post-treatment,19 to verify the positive effect of 2-chlorophenol on the concentration distribution, we investigate the distribution of PTB7-Th and PC71BM within the active layers before and after 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flush for comparison. As shown in Fig. 4b, for blend films the S signal becomes much stronger after being flushed by 2-chlorophenol (IPA) during the first four hundred seconds. This means that there is more PTB7-Th aggregates in the upper section of the film after 2-chlorophenol (IPA) treatment. Besides, as depicted in Fig. 5c, the C70 signal is first detected in films without 2-chlorophenol flush and the signal is much stronger in the initial 650 s compared with the film after flush treatment. This variation of S− and C70 confirms that 2-chlorophenol indeed removed the PC71BM in the upper section of the blend layers and makes more PTB7-Th gather on the top. To rule out the effect of IPA solvent flush, the concentration distribution of PTB7-Th and PC71BM within the photoactive layer before and after IPA flush treatment was also investigated by TOF SIMS measurement as displayed in Fig. S2.† There is no obvious difference in the S− and C70 signals before and after IPA flush treatment, indicating that IPA does not change the concentration distribution of the blend film. What is more, we have noticed another phenomenon that 2-chlorophenol (IPA) also affects the distribution of iodide irons (I−) which is on behalf of the additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). As shown in Fig. 5d, it can be seen that the I− level decreases effectively after 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flush treatment.

Fig. 4e and f display a three dimensional vertical concentration profile of the blend film flushed by 2-chlorophenol (IPA), in which blue dots represent PTB7-Th and red dots indicate PC71BM. As depicted in the three dimensional diagram, the PTB7-Th and PC71BM distribute homogeneously in the middle section of the blend film, which can enlarge the interfacial section. The upper section of the blend layers gathers more PTB7-Th and the bottom section gathers more PC71BM, which can not only meet the requirement of effective exciton dissociation but also form independent pathways for charge carrier transportation, greatly reducing carrier recombination for inverted PSCs.
2.4. Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the vertical concentration distribution on the photovoltaic performance, the aforementioned optimized PTB7-Th:PC71BM films were used as the photoactive layer in inverted PSCs with the structure of ITO/TIPD/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Al.40 It is well known that methanol and isopropanol are both simple alcohols with low boiling point and inert characteristics to remove the residual additive of DIO, and these solvent treatments can also passivate the surface defects.24,31,33,41 To clarify the inert solvent influence on the photovoltaic performance, a series of devices with different solvent flush treatments (none, methanol, isopropanol) were also fabricated for comparison. Fig. 5a records the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices with different solvent flush treatments under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 simulated sun light, and the dark J–V curves are presented in Fig. 5a. The key performance parameters of open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), filling factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 1, and the statistical results over 20 individual devices are shown in Fig. S3.† As shown in Fig. 5a, the control device without any solvent flush gives a PCE of 6.18%, with a Voc of 0.787 V, a Jsc of 13.19 mA cm−2, and an FF of 59.53%. Flushed by the pure methanol solvent, four parameters of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE are all enhanced to 0.790 V, 17.10 mA cm−2, 64.47%, and 8.71%, respectively, superior to the control device without solvent flush. The IPA flush shows the similar positive effect to the methanol treatment for photovoltaic performance enhancement, and the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE reach 0.784 V, 17.21 mA cm−2, 65.88%, and 8.89% respectively for the IPA flushed device. As expected, the 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flushed device shows the best performance, with a Voc of 0.786 V, a Jsc of 18.50 mA cm−2, an FF of 69.80%, and an overall PCE of 10.15%. The enhancement in Jsc and FF for the 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flushed device should be ascribed to the vertical concentration distribution of PTB7-Th and PC71BM in the blend film as shown in Fig. 4, which facilitates charge separation and transportation. Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the aforementioned devices. The EQE of the devices flushed by methanol and isopropanol are much higher than that of devices without solvent flush treatment in the whole wavelength range. The Jsc values calculated from EQE curves for devices with different solvent flush treatments (none, methanol, isopropanol, and 2-chlorophenol) are 13.10, 16.98, 17.07 and 18.21 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the measured Jsc from the J–V curves within a mismatch of less than 2%. Moreover, the 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flushed device demonstrates a much stronger light response and shows a much higher EQE than methanol or isopropanol flushed devices, which can be ascribed to the fact that 2-chlorophenol removes the upper PC71BM and makes more PTB7-Th aggregate on the top, which reduces carrier recombination and improves the charge collection efficiency. The depth of the pure PTB7-Th region in the photoactive layer can be easily tuned by changing the concentration of 2-chlorophenol. The J–V curves of devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM with different concentration 2-chlorophenol flush treatments are given in Fig. 5c, the performance parameters are listed in Table 2, and the corresponding EQE curves are shown in Fig. 5d. The best performance is achieved with a 0.2 vol% concentration of 2-chlorophenol in IPA. Similarly, the depth of the pure PTB7-Th layer can also be tuned by changing the flush times. The J–V curves for devices flushed one to three times are given in Fig. S4,† and the performance parameters are listed in Table S1.† It can be seen that the Jsc values gradually decreased with increasing flush times, and this should be ascribed to the non-continuous electron transport network induced by the excessive decrease of the PC70BM concentration.

To further confirm the vertical concentration distribution of PTB7-Th and PC71BM within the blend film, conventional devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/Mg/Al were fabricated. Fig. 5e shows the J–V curves of devices with methanol or 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flush treatment. The conventional device with only methanol solvent flush gives a PCE of 7.85%, with a Voc of 0.789 V, a Jsc of 15.13 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65.76%. These values are in good agreement with previous reports.42 After being flushed by 2-chlorophenol (IPA), the four parameters of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE are all decreased to 0.786 V, 13.32 mA cm−2, 62.66%, and 6.56%, respectively, inferior to the control device with only a methanol flush. Fig. 5f shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the conventional devices with methanol or 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flush treatment. It is obvious that the EQE values of devices flushed by 2-chlorophenol (IPA) are much lower than that of devices with methanol flush treatment in the whole wavelength range. These observations from J–V and EQE curves strongly confirm the vertical concentration distribution of PTB7-Th and PC71BM within the blend film induced by 2-chlorophenol flush. The higher concentration of PTB7-Th on the top and the higher concentration of PC71BM at the bottom are not beneficial for the charge transportation in conventional devices, which prevents carrier transport and collection, increases carrier recombination, and reduces the overall performance eventually.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, BHJ blends with ideal morphology and perfect concentration distribution have been achieved by multi-functional 2-chlorophenol (IPA) flush treatment. The concentration distribution can be easily controlled by changing the concentration of 2-chlorophenol in IPA and tuning the flush times. The vertical composition profile of PTB7-Th:PC71BM was confirmed by TEM, WCA and TOF SIMS, indicating that after being flushed by 2-chlorophenol (IPA), PTB7-Th and PC71BM distributed homogeneously in the middle section of the blend films, and the upper section of the blend films gathered more PTB7-Th and the bottom section gathered more PC71BM. This unique concentration distribution can not only meet the requirement of excitons' effective dissociation but also form independent pathways for charge carrier transportation, and eventually greatly reduce carrier recombination for inverted PSCs, resulting in a greatly enhanced PCE of 10.15% in comparison with that of the control device of 6.18%. This simply-processed and easily-controlled method provides a new option to achieve BHJ blends with ideal morphology and perfect concentration distribution for high performance inverted PSCs.

4.2. Device fabrication
The inverted PSCs were fabricated with the structure of ITO/TIPD/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. Glass coated with 2 mm width ITO was successively ultrasonically cleaned twice by using detergent, water, purified water, acetone and isopropanol. Then the pre-cleaned and dried ITO substrate was transferred into the nitrogen-filled glovebox for the following process. TIPD was diluted 20 times in isopropanol before spin-coating at a speed of 4000 rpm on the dried ITO glass and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating PTB7-Th:PC71BM chlorobenzene solution (1:1.5 w/w, polymer concentration of 10 mg mL−1) with 3% volume ratio of DIO additive on the ITO/TIPD substrate. The thickness of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM film is around 100 nm. And then methanol, isopropanol or 2-chlorophenol (IPA) were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s on the photoactive layer to obtain three different solvent flushed samples. After that, the samples were transferred to a vacuum chamber, a 10 nm of MoO3 layer and a 100 nm of Al were thermally deposited on the active layer under a base pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa.
The conventional PSCs were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/Mg/Al. The pre-cleaned ITO substrate was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 15 min. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s (30 nm) on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The photoactive layer and 2-chlorophenol (IPA) were prepared under the same experimental conditions as used in the inverted device. For the control device, methanol was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 20 nm of Mg and 100 nm of Al were thermally deposited under vacuum at a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa.
4.3. Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. Device characterization was performed in a glovebox under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (AAA grade, SAN-EI ELECTRIC Co., Ltd). The EQE was measured using a Systems model QE-DLI lock-in amplifier coupled with a QE-M110 monochromatic and 75 W xenon lamp (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. All the measurements were performed under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature.
4.4. Instrumentation
The surface morphologies of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM photoactive layers with different solvent flush treatments were analyzed using an Agilent 5500 atomic force microscope (AFM) operated in the tapping mode under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy (SKPM) measurements were also carried out on the same AFM using the standard SKPM mode. No voltage was applied between the sample and the tip. H. Bright field TEM was performed using a FEI Tecnai G2 microscope operated at 200 kV. The WCA images wereobtained using a profilometer of Dektak XT (Bruker) under ambient conditions. The secondary ion mass spectrum was obtained using a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer TOF-SIMS 5 from ION-TOF GmbH.
