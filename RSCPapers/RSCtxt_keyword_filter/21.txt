    , Accepted 19th November 2021First published on 22nd November 2021AbstractFor industrial use, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require long-term stability and a cost-effective hole-transport layer (HTL). The PSC stability can be substantially improved via the rational design of a dopant-free HTL that possesses inherent electrical merits. Further, through molecular engineering, via placing fluorinated arms on an established triphenylamine core, superior stability can be achieved using cost-effective precursors and easy synthesis routes. Here we developed a fluorinated triphenylamine-based HTL, probed its structural and electro-optical properties, and demonstrated the practical utility of the HTL in a PSC in its pristine form. The designed fluorinated HTL, called tri(3-fluoro-4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) triphenylamine (FOMePh), gave a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.08%, which exceeded that of doped Spiro-OMeTAD (16.9%) while consuming 2.3-times less material than Spiro-OMeTAD during PSC fabrication. We carried out synthetic cost analysis, and the cost of FOMePh was calculated to be €80.19 g−1 which is four-times lower than the cost of Spiro-OMeTAD. To investigate the impact of fluorine atoms, we synthesized molecules without fluorine atoms (OMePh). FOMePh and OMePh had hole mobilities of 5.9 × 10−4 and 3.59 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are on par with doped Spiro-OMeTAD. The photovoltaic parameters suggest that the performance of OMePh dropped due to its poor film formation abilities compared with FOMePh, and this has a bearing on the performance and reliability of PSCs.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received remarkable attention owing to their outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs),1–6 and they can store solar energy in a chemical fashion in different ways, such as through water splitting, with the production of hydrogen gas (H2) and molecular oxygen (O2) as clean by-products.7,8 PSCs are mainly fabricated using two different configurations, depending on whether the hole-transport layer (HTL) or the electron-transport layer (ETL) is deposited on the transparent conducting oxide (FTO). The former approach is called “inverted architecture” (positive–intrinsic–negative, p–i–n), while the one is termed “standard architecture” (negative–intrinsic–positive, n–i–p).9 The effect of the HTL on hole extraction and stability is fundamental.10–12 However, in n–i–p-based PSCs, the HTL can suffer from low electrical conductivity and poor hole mobility related to p-type organic semiconductors, and this is being addressed through the use of dopants. One of the most studied HTLs is Spiro-OMeTAD, but its poor electrical properties and high cost limit its widespread application.13,14 Moreover, Spiro-OMeTAD shows absorbance near 400 nm, competing with perovskite light absorbance; this can decrease the PCE, since in p–i–n-based PSCs, light passes through the HTL layer first.15 Arguably, doping can increase the amount of extracted charge that is collected at the contact surface between the HTL and perovskite, which can trigger a high fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Doping has been employed in the case of Spiro-OMeTAD and many other HTLs, such as PEDOT:PSS,16 PTAA,17 and P3HT,18 to increase the conductivity and hole mobility, using Li-based dopants, such as LiTFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP), as additives. Nevertheless, Li-based dopants can harm the stability of PSCs due to their highly hygroscopic properties.19,20 To overcome this problem, Hua et al. investigated the influence of fluorine atoms on the hydrophobicity of Li dopants. The results showed that a higher number of fluorine atoms (from 2 to 10 atoms) improved charge-carrier transfer and photovoltaic performance in PSCs.21 The design and validation of innovative cost-effective and dopant-free HTLs22,23 with good electrical properties and high stability are paramount for scalability.24 Fluorination-based molecular semiconductors have high hydrophobicity and rational molecular packing, triggering high hole mobility and conductivity with compatible energy levels with the perovskite when acting as HTLs.25 Recently, doped fluorinated Spiro-OMeTAD with a PCE of 24.8% was reported. This PCE is correlated to lower energy levels in the fluorinated example compared to the pristine one and the enhancing molecular packing in the PSC.6
To fabricate dopant-free PSCs, a pyrene-based HTL was synthesized in multiple steps with triphenylamine substituents, and device performance was investigated. The results showed that a fluorinated HTL has a better PCE compared with a pristine HTL (5.9% vs. 5.0%), and this was ascribed to the quality of the film.26 In a similar fashion, a PSC based on a central fluorinated phenyl core with pendant aryl amines achieved a stabilized PCE of 6% without the addition of ionic additives.27 Hao et al. synthesized a new HTL called BDTOFMeDPA with a benzodithiophene core and di-fluorobenzene and 4,4′-di-methoxydiphenylamine as branches. The optimized PSC with a fluorinated HTL afforded a decent PCE of 14.5%, while the non-fluorinated example delivered a PCE of 11.3% under similar conditions.28 This increase in the PCE is related to an increased photocurrent density, which is associated with efficient charge-carrier extraction and collection. The authors noted that fluorine atoms affected the tuning of energy levels. In addition to high stability and a high PCE, cost is paramount for industrialization. Triphenylamine (TPA)-based HTLs are some of the most cost-effective materials. Bonaccorso et al. reported TPA-based HTLs with phenyl-4-(phenyldiazenyl) aniline branches; 1 g of this new HTL (TPA-AZO) costs $22.76, which is remarkably lower than the cost of Spiro-OMeTAD ($170–475). However, dopant-free TPA-AZO only showed a PCE of 10.07%.29 In the same direction, a TPA core and diphenylethenyl sidearms were synthesized, showing a PCE of only 10.79% with comparative stability under light soaking for 250 h.30 Ko et al. designed a new TPA-based core to mimic N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzidine (MeOTPD), which is well known as one of the best small-molecule-based HTLs; however, the new structure, with the addition of t-BP, LiTFSI, and a cobalt dopant (FK209), only showed a PCE of 12.31%.31 Graetzel et al. reported a 4-methoxytriphenylamine (MeOTPA) core, which exhibited a remarkable overall PCE of 16.1% without any dopants or additives.32 Recently, a dopant-free HTL based on fluorine atoms substituted on 2,2′-bithiophene group has been reported for p–i–n devices with enhanced PV performance.33
Herein, we have designed and synthesized a fluorinated TPA-based HTL (FOMePh) from inexpensive precursors to investigate the effects of fluorine atoms on the film- formation and optoelectrical properties of the HTL, and the effects on the performance and stability of dopant-free HTL-based PSCs. The FOMePh HTL in a pristine state yielded outstanding photovoltaic performance compared to common doped Spiro-OMeTAD because of superior molecular packing and high-quality film formation abilities. However, the reported structure without fluorination (OMePh) showed inferior behavior due to poor film-forming abilities and non-aligned energy levels.34
Undoped FOMePh showed par-level performance and comparable FF and Voc values to doped Spiro-OMeTAD (PCEs of 17.08% and 16.90%, respectively). The molecular structures of the HTLs employed in the present work are shown in Scheme 1.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
For synthesis, bromine (Br2), 3-fluoro-4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline, bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine, palladium(II) acetate, sodium tert-butoxide, MgSO4, and tri-tert-butylphosphine, were purchased from Fisher Scientific and TCI. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Solvents were purchased from local distributors and were used without further purification. All reactions were carried out under an inert environment in a Schlenk tube under N2. For device fabrication, lead iodide (99.9%) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) and employed as received. Lead bromide, LiTFSI, and tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Common solvents, such as DMF, DMSO, isopropanol, ethanol, and chlorobenzene, were purchased from Acros Chemicals and used as received.
2.2. Instrumentation

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Mercury 400 MHz spectrometer in C6D6 solvent. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) signals were recorded using Mettler Toledo DSC 1 apparatus. ESI-mass experiments were performed using a Micromass Q-TOF mass spectrometer. UV/vis spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Cary 60 (Varian) UV/vis spectrophotometer.
2.3. Device fabrication

n–i–p. 
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (NSG 11) was cleaned using the following sequence before use. Ultrasonication (2% Hellmanex water solution for 30 min) was carried out, followed by rinsing with deionized water, acetone, and then isopropanol (IPA); lastly, the electrodes were treated under UV-ozone for 30 min for the removal of any residue on the surface. The TiO2 compact layer was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrate via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C using a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol (1:19). The substrates were kept at 500 °C for a further 30 min after spraying and then left to cool down. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on the electrodes through a spin-coating process (30 s at 4000 rpm); for this, TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) was diluted at a 1:8 ratio in ethanol. The substrates were annealed first at 125 °C and then at 500 °C via four-step heating; finally, they were maintained at 500 °C for 30 min. Upon attaining room temperature, the substrates were treated under UV-ozone for 15 min and transferred to an argon-filled glovebox for perovskite layer deposition. The precursor solution for the mixed perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 was prepared via dissolving FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.2 M), MABr (0.2 M), and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in anhydrous DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v). The perovskite solution was spin-coated in a two-step sequence at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. During the second step, 110 μL of chlorobenzene was dripped onto the substrate as an antisolvent 10 s before the end of the spinning process. The perovskite-coated substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in a glovebox. Upon reaching room temperature, the hole-selective layer was deposited. Spiro-OMeTAD (70 mM) was prepared via dissolving the corresponding amount of material in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Spiro-OMeTAD was doped through adding bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) at molar ratios of 0.5 and 3.3, respectively. 40 μL of HTL solution was spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s in an argon-filled glovebox. Similarly, 30 mM FOMePh and OMePh were pre-heated at 85 °C and 75 °C, respectively, and deposited on top of the perovskite layer. Device fabrication was finished via evaporating a thin layer of silver with a thickness of 100 nm as a cathode under low vacuum (10−6 torr). All solutions were prepared inside an argon-filled glovebox under controlled moisture and oxygen conditions (O2 < 15 ppm, H2O < 2 ppm).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of new HTLs

FOMePh is reported here for the first time (Scheme 2) and it is synthesized in good yield, while OMePh was synthesized according to a previous report with modifications.34,35Scheme 2 shows the one-pot method used for coupling the main core, which is tris(4-bromophenyl)amine (similar to the previous report),35 and the branches, which are made of 2-fluoro-4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline. The final compounds were characterized using an array of spectroscopic techniques, such as NMR (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†), mass spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†), UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 1A and Fig. S4A, ESI†), cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S4B, ESI†), and DSC (Fig. 1C).

(E) J–V measurements from devices to calculate the hole mobilities of different HTLs. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of OMePh and FOMePh were measured in solution form (dissolved in dichloromethane solvent) and as thin films deposited on glass substrates (Fig. 1A and Fig. S4A, ESI†), and the related data are tabulated in Table 1. OMePh and FOMePh display three absorption bands in the 300–350 nm and 400–450 nm regions. The two absorption bands in the 300–320 nm region can be assigned to the n–π* transitions of TPA moieties, while the absorption in range of 400–450 nm is assigned to intramolecular charge transfer involving π–π* electronic transitions.36OMePh shows a λmax value at 346 nm, while the value for FOMePh is 337 nm. We ascribed this minor blue shift to the decreased electron-donating abilities of the fluorinated TPA unit in FOMePh due to the presence of electronegative fluorine atoms. Furthermore, we noted that in thin-film form (Fig. S4, ESI†), the UV-vis spectra show slight red-shifting due to molecular π–π* stacking.37,38 We derived the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with the help of cyclic voltammetry. Due to the presence of fluorine atoms in FOMePh, we see a shift of 51 mV in the redox process from that observed for OMePh (Fig. 1B). Electrochemical analysis of the new HTL shows three consecutive reversible redox peaks, confirming the stability of the HTL in the solution medium. To calculate the HOMO energy levels, the onset oxidation potentials (vs. Ag/Ag+) corresponding to OMePh and FOMePh were calculated to be −0.16 and −0.10 V, respectively. Applying these Eoxonset values to the formula EHOMO (eV) = −(Eoxonset − Eferroceneonset + 5.1), where Eferroceneonset is 0.11 V, the resulting HOMO levels are −4.89 eV and −4.83 eV, respectively, for FOMePh and OMePh. Here the effects of fluorine atoms on the HOMO level decrease are visible;39 arguably, this will allow a higher Voc value to be achieved in devices. The optical band gaps were used to calculate the LUMO levels of the HTLs (ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg), and the values were calculated to be −2.1 and −1.9 eV, respectively, for OMePh and FOMePh (Table 1).

To evaluate the thermal stability, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were made. The second heating cycle DSC curves are shown (Fig. 1C) for OMePh and FOMePh. FOMePh shows a Tg value of 105.7 °C; however, no sign of a glass transition temperature (Tg) was observed for OMePh. The decent thermal stability of FOMePh will allow PSC operation under extreme conditions (>85 °C).
To understand the impact of molecular engineering on electrical properties, we measured the conductivity and hole mobility.40 The conductivities of pristine FOMePh and OMePh were derived via measuring linear current–voltage curves from devices (FTO/HTL/Ag). The conductivities of FOMePh and OMePh were 36.2 and 12 μS cm−1, respectively (Fig. 1D), which are on par with conventional doped Spiro-OMeTAD (36 μS cm−1).
The hole mobilities of pristine FOMePh, OMePh, and doped Spiro-OMeTAD were derived via fitting the J–V curves obtained from hole-only devices (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/Ag), HTL film thicknesses of 120, 76, and 33 nm for Spiro-OMeTAD, FOMePh, and OMePh, respectively) (Fig. S5, ESI†). The hole mobilities of pristine FOMePh, OMePh, and Spiro-OMeTAD were calculated to be 5.9 × 10−4, 3.59 × 10−5, and 6.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Pristine FOMePh exhibits a higher hole mobility than other fluorinated HTLs41 and a comparable hole mobility value to doped Spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting its potential as a dopant-free HTL for use in PSCs (Fig. 1E).
To examine the microstructure of the perovskite and different HTL-coated perovskites, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. It is obvious from SEM imaging that the perovskite layer exhibits a pinhole-free, compact, and uniform surface morphology (Fig. 2A). The microstructures of the FOMePh and OMePh (Fig. 2B and C) layers involve homogenous and heterogeneous surfaces, respectively. OMePh shows a rough surface together with crystallization into microwires. We suggest that fluorine atoms have a predominant influence on the film-forming abilities, while OMePh shows crystallization over the perovskite surface in chlorobenzene solvent. The surface topography can be deduced from AFM images, displaying that the perovskite film exhibits the maximum surface roughness (RMS) of 21.7 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). After coating with different HTLs, the roughness decreases significantly. The RMS value decreases in the order OMePh (8.34 nm) > Spiro-OMeTAD (4.65 nm) > FOMePh (4.23 nm). The AFM topography of FOMePh and Spiro-OMeTAD show that FOMePh and Spiro-OMeTAD involve the uniform and full coverage of the HTL on the perovskite. However, in the case of OMePh, the surface roughness increases, which is ascribed to intermittent and incomplete coverage of the perovskite.

(D) XRD patterns of the pure FAMA perovskite (brown), FAMA-Spiro-OMeTAD (black), FAMA-FOMePh (red), and FAMA-OMePh (blue). The peaks marked with * are from FTO. 
Notably, both the microstructure and surface roughness impact the PSC performance as described in the next PV performance section.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to probe the crystallinity of the perovskites covered with FOMePh, OMePh, and Spiro-OMeTAD thin film (Fig. 2D). The diffractograms show that the HTL does not influence the perovskite layer, which is (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (termed FAMA), and good crystallization is seen. The peaks at 2θ values of 14.25°, 20.16°, 24.72°, and 28.56° represent the typical diffraction peaks of (100), (002), (101), and (110) planes, respectively.
To elucidate the interactions between FAMA and FOMePh, the elemental compositions of the surfaces of pristine perovskite and a sample coated with FOMePh are investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The core-level C, N, O, F, and Pb element peaks are shown in Fig. 3. The components at 283.7, 285.2, and 287.2 eV in the C 1s spectrum are related to C–C from impurities,42 C–NH2 from MA, and CNH2+ from FA, respectively (Fig. 3A).43,44 The difference in the intensities of the C–NH2 and CNH2+ peaks is in line with the ratio of FA to MA in FAMA. In the FAMA sample coated with FOMePh, the intensities of the C–C and C–N peaks have decreased and the peaks are shifted by 0.9 and 0.7 eV, respectively, toward higher binding energies (Fig. 3B). The components in the N 1s spectra at 399.4 and 401.0 eV are related to CNH2+ and C–NH2, respectively, and the shoulder peak at 400.6 eV is related to N in FOMePh (Fig. 3C). The strong peaks at 686.3 and 532.4 eV are F 1s and O 1s peaks in the case of FOMePh, and these do not exist in FAMA (Fig. 3D and E). The core-level lead (Pb2+) spectrum of FAMA presents two distinct peaks at 137.2 and 142.1 eV. Upon HTL deposition, these peaks shifted (by 0.51 and 0.48 eV, respectively), suggesting interactions between N atoms in FOMePh and Pb2+ (Fig. 3F).

3.2 Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the hole transport properties of the synthesized HTLs, we fabricated n–i–p-type PSCs with the structure FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/FAMA/FOMePh or OMePh/Au. Doped Spiro-OMeTAD was used as the HTL for a control PSC. The energy level diagram and device configuration are presented in Fig. 4A and B, respectively. A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a PSC (Fig. 4C) depicts the layer structure, with FOMePh represented.

The average and best PSC performance parameters are listed in Table 2. We noted that the pristine fluorinated HTL shows highly competitive performance, with a best PCE of 17.08% using only 30 mM FOMePh; a PCE of 16.9% was recorded for the PSC with 70 mM doped Spiro-OMeTAD. The impact of fluorine atoms on the performance of the PSC was prominent when compared with OMePh, which gave a PCE of only 4.93%. The poor device performance of PSCs based on OMePh can mainly be attributed to poor film formation and the incomplete coverage of the HTL on the perovskite; this may cause interfacial charge recombination at the perovskite/HTM/Au interface. Device statistics and data for optimizing the concentration of FOMePh for device fabrication are presented in Fig. S7 and Table S1 (ESI†), respectively.

We noted that past reports dealing with the addition of fluorine atoms to HTLs resulted in 5.2,33 0.9%,26 and 0.04%45 increases in the PCE. The high fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) obtained upon the use of FOMePh as the HTL suggest the decisive role played by fluorine atoms in favoring an improved microstructure on top of the perovskite layer; in addition, from microscopy images we deduced uniform and full coverage on the perovskite. This promotes efficient charge extraction at the interface between the perovskite and FOMePh (Table 2 and Fig. 5A).

(D) Steady-state PL spectra from the pristine perovskite, FAMA/FOMePh and FAMA/Spiro-MeOTAD bilayers. 
The hysteresis index (HI) is calculated46 based on forward and reverse scan directions, and both Spiro-OMeTAD and FOMePh show low HI values (Table 2 and Fig. S8, ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the range from 300 to 900 nm shows high photon-to-electron conversion, and it reached a maximum of ∼87% in the case of Spiro-OMeTAD and FOMePh, while for OMePh, it reached a maximum of up to 73% (Fig. 5B). The integrated Jsc values from the IPCE spectra are 19.75 and 19.65 mA cm−2 for FOMePh and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, which are slightly lower with the Jsc values obtained from J–V measurements, due to the mixmatch in the internsity of the light source and in the time gap the experiments were performed. Steady-state photocurrent density measurements are done under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 continuous illumination under ambient conditions for 300 s. Fig. 5C shows that the evolution of the photocurrent density for ∼300 s is completely stable.
3.3 Device kinetics
To investigate the charge extraction behavior at the FAMA/HTM interface, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the different perovskites were recorded on a quartz substrate upon excitation at 500 nm (Fig. 5D). The pristine perovskite exhibits an emission peak at 764 nm. In the case of FAMA/FOMePh, the reduction in the PL intensity indicates that the fluorinated HTM (FOMePh) assists photo-generated hole extraction from the perovskite to the hole-transport layer. The results show that charge carrier extraction at the interface is enhanced in the presence of FOMePh due to higher PL quenching compared with Spiro-OMeTAD.
To further clarify the improvements in the PV parameters, Mott–Schottky and impedance analysis of devices based on different HTLs was conducted. Mott–Schottky measurements were done at 10 kHz under dark conditions. From the x-intercept of the linear region in the Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. S10, ESI†), the built-in potential can be derived. The built-in potential (Vbi) of the PSC based on FOMePh (990 mV) is marginally higher than that of the PSC based on OMePh (980 mV).
The charge transfer dynamics and charge recombination mechanisms in PSCs with dopant-free FOMePh and doped Spiro-OMeTAD were elucidated based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark conditions. To analyze the EIS data, devices were modeled using an equivalent circuit model of Rs + Rctr/CPE1 + Rrec/CPE2 (Fig. S11, ESI†), where Rs, Rctr, and Rrec represent the series resistance, charge transfer resistance at the Au/HTL/perovskite interface, and recombination resistance, respectively (Table S2, ESI†),40,45,46 and the fitted Nyquist plots and bode plots are shown in Fig. 6A and B under an applied bias voltage of 0.95 V. We noted that at a given bias, the Rctr value in the device with the thin FOMePh HTL is much lower than that of the reference device with doped Spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting that the HTL has a significant role in promoting the charge transfer dynamics at the perovskite/HTM/Au interface (Fig. 6C).

(C) Charge transport resistance and (D) recombination resistance at various applied voltages for FOMePh and Spiro-OMeTAD. 
Further, the Rrec values (in Fig. 6D) are higher for the PSC with FOMePh than for the Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC, suggesting lower charge recombination loss between the perovskite film and FOMePh layer (Table S2). The ideality factor (n) was derived from the relationships47Rrec = Aexp(−βqV/KBT) and n = 1/β. The obtained β values for the devices with FOMePh and Spiro-OMeTAD were 0.48 and 0.52, respectively, corresponding to n values of 2.08 and 1.92. To elucidate the impact of different HTMs on the charge lifetime (τ), Bode phase spectra were obtained under dark conditions at 0.95 V (Fig. 6C). The charge lifetime can be derived using the relationship τ = 1/(2πfp), where fp denotes the peak frequency corresponding to the charge-transfer process at the perovskite/HTM interface.48 The FOMePh-based PSC showed a longer charge lifetime of 5.20 μs compared to that of the reference PSC with doped Spiro-OMeTAD (3.18 μs). The longer charge lifetime can be ascribed to lower levels of charge recombination at the perovskite/FOMePh interface, resulting in rapid charge carrier transport in the PSC with FOMePh, which is in agreement with the improved Jsc value obtained from the J–V curve. The origin of the different carrier recombination kinetics in FOMePh-, OMePh-, and Spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs is further investigated based on dark current measurements45 (Fig. S9, ESI†) and the following formula:  
The ideality factor (nid) and saturation current (J0) are calculated via fitting the data to the above equation, where Jdark is the dark current density, V is the applied voltage, q is the electron charge, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
In the semi-logarithmic J–V curve, the dark reverse saturation current (under negative bias) of FOMePh is lower than that of OMePh, leading to a higher Jsc value. Compared with OMePh (J0 = 780 μA cm−2), FOMePh and Spiro-OMeTAD showed lower leakage currents of 0.18 μA cm−2 and 0.0031 μA cm−2, respectively. The ideality factors of 2.01, 2.17, and 2.57 were calculated from the slopes in the forward direction for Spiro-OMeTAD, FOMePh, and OMePh, respectively. The smaller values of n and J0 for FOMePh- and Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs imply reduced interfacial recombination and, consequently, charge transportation; thus, the PV performances are improved.
3.4 Device stability and cost calculations
For reliability purposes, long-term device performance is an important characteristic relating to the operation of PSCs. In the case of the n–i–p device configuration (the present case), a hydrophobic HTL deposited on top of the perovskite has a two-fold function. The HTL extracts and transports holes and also serves as a protecting barrier against atmospheric moisture and oxygen. Thus, to investigate the surface hydrophobicity, water contact angle measurements were performed. FOMePh shows a higher water contact angle than Spiro-OMeTAD and OMePh, indicating its better hydrophobicity due to the non-hygroscopic nature of fluorine atoms, which decelerate the invasion of H2O and O2 thus contributes to improve the stability in PSCs (Fig. 7A–C).

(E) Maximum power point tracking for FOMePh- and Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs without encapsulation for ∼80 h under 1 sun illumination at 27 °C and 40–50% humidity. 
Furthermore, to study the long-term stability of PSCs based on FOMePh, OMePh, and Spiro-OMeTAD, MPP tracking of unencapsulated devices was investigated under continuous 1 sun illumination under ambient condition (∼40–50% RH). The FOMePh-based PSC exhibited higher stability compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC (Fig. 7E); 60% of the initial current output was maintained over ∼80 h, while Spiro-OMeTAD retains only 20% of its initial current. The improved stability of the FOMePh-based PSC is ascribed to combined effects of the uniform HTM protecting layer without any external dopants and the superior hydrophobicity. Fig. 7D displays the PCEs of devices kept outside of a glove box in the dark and under air (∼20% RH) measured under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 on different days over a long time period. A small decrease was observed in the PCE, and ∼85% of the original PCE was maintained after 30 days in the case of FOMePh.
Finally, for industrial endeavors, the calculated costs show that FOMePh has a significantly lower estimated price (€80.19 per g, Tables S3 and S4, ESI†) compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, and it works effectively in its pristine form.
4. Conclusions
We designed and developed a hole-transport material based on a fluorinated triphenylamine core for use in perovskite solar cells. FOMePh can be synthesized from cost-effective precursors in a single-step reaction, reducing the cost/watt ratio.
Fluorinated FOMePh exhibited high hydrophobicity and high hole mobility due to the molecular packing and aligned energy levels with the perovskite. We also synthesized a similar analog without fluorination (OMePh) to deduce the impact of fluorine atoms on the structural and optoelectronic properties. OMePh showed inferior behavior due to its poor film-forming abilities and non-aligned energy levels. Due to its high charge mobility in its pristine form, FOMePh works efficiently at a low molar concentration (30 mM) without any dopants/additives, and it shows superior performance (PCE: 17.08%) compared to doped Spiro-OMeTAD (PCE: 16.90%). FOMePh improves film formation and yields favorable hole mobility and suitable energy levels in its dopant-free state, suggesting that fluorine atoms decrease interfacial obstacles for hole extraction, decrease the series resistance, and improve the fill factor.
The cheap starting materials and simplistic synthetic route used for FOMePh suggest a pathway for cost-competitive and reliable hole-selective-layer development. Our future research will be focused on tuning the energy level via adding further fluorine atoms to the phenyl rings to minimize voltage deficits.
