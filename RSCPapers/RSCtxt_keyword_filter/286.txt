    , Accepted 18th July 2016First published on 19th July 2016AbstractIn recent years, two-dimensional (2D) layered transitional metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have received much attention as promising electrode materials in energy storage. Although recent reports on 2D TMC nanostructures have demonstrated promising electrochemical performances, the major scientific challenge is to develop a viable synthesis process to produce layered structures of chalcogenides (Co, Ni or Fe based TMCs) as anode materials. In this work, we propose the synthesis of layered Co0.85Se nanosheets in a solution based method by using a 2D oriented attachment strategy. The as-prepared Co0.85Se nanosheets exhibit specific capacities as high as 675 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. When the current densities were further increased to 200, 500 and 1000 mA g−1, the reversible capacities can still reach up to 645, 574 and 493 mA h g−1 with excellent cycling life of 95, 85 and 73%, respectively. Li-ion storage performance of layered Co0.85Se nanosheets is higher than that of Co0.85Se microspheres as well as cobalt sulfide. The superior electrochemical performance of Co0.85Se nanosheets is attributed to their 2D layered structure which enhances electrical conductivity and improves diffusion pathways of the Li-ion within the host material. The synthesis method described in this work serves as a general route for the design and preparation of other 2D layered TMCs.
1. Introduction
The development of portable consumer electronic, hybrid-electric or all-electric vehicles, and large-scale industrial energy and power systems has levied huge demands on electricity storage systems. Among various energy storage systems, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) show favourable advantages in terms of energy density, cycling life and calendar life, as well as volumetric specific energy. In recent years, research efforts have been devoted to the design and fabrication of electrode materials with high electrochemical performance.1,2 Electrode materials made out of transitional metal chalcogenides (TMCs, including sulfide, selenide and telluride) have attracted tremendous interest due to their good electrical conductivities and mechanical and thermal stabilities.3–5 At present, a number of TMCs such as CoS2,6 CoS,6,7 NiS2,8 MoS2,9–11 WS2,12,13 SnS2,14,15 MoSe2,16–18 SnSe2,19,20 and Sb2Se321 have been developed for Li-ion storage based on their high specific capacities. However, most research studies on TMCs have been concerned with the synthesis and Li-ion storage performance of metal sulfides3–15 and insufficient attention has been given to the Li-ion storage performance of metal selenides.16–21
Metal selenides possess an attractive potential as anode materials with good electrical conductivity.22,23 Besides, according to the electrochemical mechanism, metal selenides can be converted to Li2Se in a way that is similar to the conversion process of Li2S in metal sulfides during discharge/charge processes.24,25 Recently, Shi et al. reported an improvement of rate performance for ordered mesoporous MoSe2 over mesoporous MoS2.16 It is therefore important to investigate the analogues of MoSe2 such as cobalt, nickel, tungsten or iron selenides with a detailed lithiation mechanism in order to fully understand the metal selenides with Li-ion storage behaviour.
As one of the important TMCs for industrial application, cobalt selenide is known as a metallic conductor and an exchange-enhanced Pauli paramagnet in its ground state with a Curie temperature, Tc, of 124 K.26–28 Stable phases of cobalt selenide including Co9Se8, CoSe, Co0.85Se and CoSe2 can be obtained at room temperature.26,29–31 Recently, nonstoichiometric Co0.85Se has demonstrated promising performances in the fields of energy evolution and storage such as fuel cells, solar cells, and supercapacitors, and even in the catalytic decomposition of toxic pollutants and catalytic hydrogenation of organics.31–36 For example, Gong et al. suggested that Co0.85Se grown on conductive glass substrates exhibited a higher short circuit photocurrent and power conversion efficiency (9.40%) than Pt when used as counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells.31 Banerjee et al. reported that hollow Co0.85Se nanowire arrays on carbon fiber paper possess high pseudo capacitive properties with high capacitance retention and high durability.36 Co0.85Se is also expected to exhibit better electrochemical performance as electrode materials for LIBs due to its higher conductivity. It is also highly ideal for Li-ion storage in host materials with two-dimensional (2D) layered nanostructures, where 2D layered materials provide suitable Li-ion diffusion channels as well as shorter diffusion distance.9–13 Unfortunately, unlike the other TMCs, it is difficult to develop a 2D layered structure for nonstoichiometric Co0.85Se due to its nature of layered structural defects lacking a driving force for 2D layered growth.32 Therefore, nanoscale particles, wires and even sheets of Co0.85Se have been prepared,31–36 but no evidence has indicated that layered Co0.85Se has been successfully synthesized until now. Therefore, it is a big challenge to prepare nonstoichiometric Co0.85Se with 2D layered nanostructures.
In this work, we found that layered Co0.85Se nanosheets can be constructed successfully by a 2D Oriented Attachment (OA) growth of Co0.85Se nanocrystals in solution using Na2SeO3 and Co(AC)2 as precursors. The OA growth method is a new mechanism developed in recent years for growth of crystals, especially anisotropic nanostructures, by which small nanocrystals can be used directly as basic building blocks to combine together along the same crystallographic orientations to form larger ones.37–39 Co0.85Se preliminary nanocrystals (PNs) can be formed first by nucleation growth, and then combined with each other into layered nanosheets via the OA process. By adjusting the reaction parameters, the PNs can also grow into other nanostructures such as microspheres. Moreover, the as-prepared layered Co0.85Se nanosheets exhibited a reversible capacity for Li-ion storage and also possessed much better rate-performance as well as cyclic stability than those of Co0.85Se microspheres, showing a promising potential for application in lithium ion batteries.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of Co0.85Se nanosheets
Co0.85Se nanosheets were prepared by a modified solvothermal method reported by Yu et al.26 Cobalt acetate (Co(AC)2) and sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) were used as Co and Se precursors, respectively. In a typical procedure, Co(AC)2 (1 mmol) and Na2SeO3 (1 mmol) were added into a 40 ml solvent mixture of (diethylenetriamine) DETA and (deionized water) DIW (VDETA/VDIW = 2/1) and was vigorously stirred for 30 min. Afterwards, the solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated to 80 °C for 1 h, followed by increasing the temperature to 180 °C for 16 h. After natural cooling, the black sediments were washed with DIW and ethanol to remove remnants. Subsequently, Co0.85Se nanosheets were collected after vacuum drying at 60 °C overnight. For comparison, Co0.85Se nanomaterials with other morphologies were also synthesized by adjusting the mole ratio of precursors, i.e. Co(AC)2 and Na2SeO3.
Characterization
The morphologies and elemental mapping of the obtained Co0.85Se samples were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a JEOL JSM-7600F microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Co0.85Se materials used for SEM and elemental mapping measurements are coated first on the Cu plate to avoid the signal of carbon from conductive adhesives. The microstructures of Co0.85Se samples were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) on a JEM 2100F microscope. The phase compositions were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Siemens D5005) with Cu Kα radiation (l = 1.54 Å). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were obtained by evaluating N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained by using an ASAP 2020 Micromeritics Instrument at 77 K.
Electrochemical measurements
Lithium ion batteries were assembled in a high-purity argon-filled glove box (O2 < 1 ppm, H2O < 1 ppm) using CR2032 type coin cells. Working electrodes were composed of active materials (Co0.85Se or CoSe2, 80 wt%), acetylene black (AB, 10 wt%) and a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coating on nickel foam. The mass of active materials loading on the electrode is in the range of ca. 2.5 to 3.5 mg. A lithium plate was chosen as a counter and reference electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC) with a volume ratio of 1v/1v.
The galvanostatic discharge/charge measurements were carried out on a multi-channel battery tester (Neware BTS-610). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out in an electrochemical workstation (VMP3, Bio-Logic) in a voltage window from 0.01 to 3.0 V at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) was recorded at a scanning frequency from 10 mHz to 10.0 kHz.
3. Results and discussion
Compositions, morphologies and structures of layered Co0.85Se nanosheets
Typically, Co0.85Se nanosheets were synthesized through a solvothermal reaction by using Co(AC)2 and Na2SeO3 with a mole ratio of 1:1 as precursors. Under natural optical conditions, the as-prepared cobalt selenide is a black powder after washing and vacuum drying. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared nanosheets. The diffraction peaks at 33.7, 45.2, 51.2, 60.7, and 62.9 can be assigned to (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) planes of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Co0.85Se, which are well indexed to the standard diffraction pattern of Co0.85Se (JCPDS card no. 52-1008). The weak diffraction peak appearing at 15.4° maybe attributed to the (002) crystal plane,26 implying the presence of a layered structural Co0.85Se in the product, which is consistent with the HRTEM analysis (see the following discussion). No impurity phases are found, indicating high crystalline degree and high phase purity of Co0.85Se.

The morphology, structure and elemental compositions of the as-prepared Co0.85Se powder were investigated by SEM (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a presents that the as-prepared Co0.85Se are two-dimensional nanosheets with a wave-like structure. Meanwhile, it is noted that the nanosheets are ultra-thin, exhibiting an almost transparent property under the electron beam. Moreover, the magnified SEM image shows a smooth surface of the nanosheets. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra and the corresponding elemental mappings reveal that Co0.85Se nanosheets are composed mainly of Co, Se, C and O elements (Fig. S1† and Fig. 2c–h). The Cu signal comes from the copper substrate used for SEM measurements, while the C signal is from the solvent DETA used in the experiment. Furthermore, Fig. 2d and e show that the spectra of both Co and Se display uniform and homogeneous distribution of the respective elements on the overall nanosheets, confirming that Co0.85Se nanosheets are mainly composed of Co and Se elements, which agrees well with the XRD measurements.

The signal of copper element comes from the Cu substrate. 
TEM measurements reveal the microstructure properties of Co0.85Se nanosheets. The average width of Co0.85Se nanosheets is about 1 μm (Fig. 3a and S2†). Fig. 3b shows that from the tilted side edge of the Co0.85Se nanosheet, it can be estimated that the thickness of the nanosheet is about 5 nm. Moreover, the nanosheet exhibits a layered structure where the interlayer distance is ca. 0.57 nm (Fig. 3b), which should be attributed to the (002) crystal plane. The novel layered nanosheet-like structures of Co0.85Se will enhance the diffusion of the Li-ion and also shorten the length of electron transfer between active materials and a conductive substrate.9–13

Growth mechanism of layered Co0.85Se nanosheets
Various Co0.85Se nanostructures have been prepared in previous reports, however no layered Co0.85Se nanosheets have been observed.31–36 For the first time, cobalt selenides were fabricated with a unique partially layered structure. Hence, it is of great interest to explore the growth mechanism of two-dimensional layered Co0.85Se nanosheets. The HRTEM images of the Co0.85Se nanosheets (Fig. 3c and S2b†) reveal the possible growth mechanism of a 2D nanostructure. It can be clearly seen that the nanosheets are assembled by numerous irregular small nanoplates with a size in the range of 2–10 nm. Meanwhile, Fig. 3d shows a number of clear dislocations originating from the imperfect oriented coherence between the small nanoplates, which is in accordance with the oriented attachment mechanism.37,39
To further confirm the growth mechanism of Co0.85Se nanosheets, various samples were prepared by varying the mole ratio of precursor Na2SeO3/Co(AC)2 while retaining the same growth procedure for Co0.85Se nanosheets. Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of the samples synthesized at a molar ratio of Na2SeO3/Co(AC)2 at 0.5:1, 0.75:1, and 1.5:1. At the ratio of 0.5:1, the obtained sample is still mainly composed of Co0.85Se (Fig. S3a†). Of note, Fig. 4a shows that the as-prepared Co0.85Se exhibits a different morphology where Co0.85Se clusters and forms a microsphere structure. Besides, as shown in Fig. 4b, the microspheres are composed of an aggregation of small nanoparticles instead of nanoplates. When the ratio was further increased to 0.75:1, the morphology was transformed to inclined nanosheets or nanoplates around the microspheres obtained at the preliminary stage. Interestingly, the morphology of Co0.85Se is being evolved into the nanosheet-like structure, but the size of nanosheets is much smaller than that of the sample obtained at a 1:1 ratio. Hence, this implies that the small nanoplates can be considered as the preliminary nanocrystals (PNs) of Co0.85Se, where PNs are typically retained in the nanostructures constructed via the OA growth mechanism.37–39 Furthermore, once the ratio is increased to 1.5:1, the compositions of the obtained sample tend to be uncontrollable, where inhomogeneous and ultra-large nanosheets originating from the partial amount of CoSe2 are present in the sample (Fig. S3c†). Therefore, the morphologies and structures of Co0.85Se are very sensitive to the ratio of precursors, and only a precise molar ratio promotes the 2D growth of Co0.85Se. This result also supports the OA growth mechanism that the ratio of precursors has played an important role in the coherence types of PNs. The schematic diagram of the growth process of Co0.85Se nanostructures is illustrated in Fig. 5. Firstly, plate-like Co0.85Se PNs are formed in the solution by a nucleation growth (Fig. 5b). Thereafter, PNs will grow further into secondary nanostructures such as microspheres and nanosheets via an attachment with each other. The process of attachment growth can be controlled by tuning organic coatings and surface charges on the PNs.40–43 Specifically, the basal planes of Co0.85Se PNs are strongly coupled with DETA,26 which will act as stabilizers to hinder the further coarsening of PNs due to Ostwald ripening.40–43 Simultaneously, the charged surfaces of Co0.85Se PNs induce the anisotropic growth of secondary PNs.41–43 Noticeably, at a lower ratio of Na2SeO3/Co(AC)2, the concentration of the as-prepared PNs is also very low, and a large amount of unreacted Co anions around the PNs will destroy the electric double layers of the PNs, which results in the quick aggregation of PNs into microspheres (Fig. 5c). In contrast, at a higher ratio, the charged Co0.85Se PNs are stabilized in the solutions, and have sufficient time to adjust their orientation, causing anisotropic attachment with each other (Fig. 5d).

Li-ion storage performance of layered Co0.85Se nanosheets
The morphologies and structures of Co0.85Se products play a key role in their Li-ion storage performance. For comparison, Li-ion storage performances of both Co0.85Se nanosheets and microspheres were evaluated using coin cells. The electrochemical activity of Co0.85Se nanosheets and microspheres for Li-ion storage is investigated firstly by cyclic voltammograms (CV) at room temperature (Fig. 6a and b). In the first cycle of Co0.85Se nanosheets, two large cathodic current peaks appear at ca. 1.2 V and 0.6 V, respectively with a slightly weaker anodic peak centred at ca. 1.75 V and a strong one at 2.2 V, respectively. In the 1st discharge curve of the nanosheets (Fig. 6c), one long discharge plateau from 2.0 to 1.1 V, and one discharge slope from 1.1 to 0.01 V are observed, which should correspond to two cathodic peaks at ca. 1.2 V and 0.6 V, respectively. In the 1st charge curve of the nanosheets (Fig. 6c), one charge slope from 1.2 to 2.0 V and one charge plateau from 2.0 to 2.5 V are clearly observed, which should correspond to two anodic peaks, respectively. In order to clear the Li-ion storage mechanism, ex situ measurements were carried out to investigate the morphology and structural changes of the Co0.85Se nanosheets by XRD and HRTEM (Fig. S4†). The XRD pattern shows that three peaks, different from original Co0.85Se, are present when the initial discharge voltage is up to 1.1 V (Fig. S4b†). HRTEM reveals that Co0.85Se nanosheets still possess layered structures, and the interlayer distance is enlarged, which indicates that the discharge plateau from 2.0 to 1.1 V should be ascribed to the formation of LixCo0.85Se by insertion of the Li-ion into the interlayer of Co0.85Se nanosheets.16–20 At a discharge voltage of 0.01 V, diffraction peaks of LixCo0.85Se disappear completely, and Li2Se peaks appear (Fig. S4c†), indicating that the subsequent discharge process from 1.1 to 0.01 V should be attributed to a further conversion reaction of LixCo0.85Se to form Li2Se and metal Co. When voltage is charged to 3.0 V, the XRD pattern shows that the Co0.85Se phase can be recovered (Fig. S4d†), indicating that Li2Se and metal Co are converted back to cobalt selenide according to previous reports about metal selenides.16–20 The HRTEM image reveals that the layered structure of Co0.85Se can be still observed (Fig. S4f†). Therefore, the Li-ion storage mechanism of Co0.85Se can be described by a two-stage reversible reaction as follows:Co0.85Se + Li+ + e− ↔ LixCo0.85Se;LixCo0.85Se + e− ↔ Co + Li2Se
 Fig. 6  CV curves of Co0.85Se (a) nanosheets and (b) microspheres, and initial two discharge/charge curves of Co0.85Se (c) nanosheets and (d) microspheres at the current density of 100 mA g−1. 
Compared with the 1st cycle, two cathodic peaks in the second cycle are shifted positively to 1.45 V and 0.7 V, respectively, which is similar to that in MoSe2 as well as other conversion-type Li-ion storage materials and may be attributed to the structural change of active materials caused by Li-ion activation.9–20 On the other hand, the anodic peaks in the second cycle are fully consistent with that in the 1st cycle. Moreover, both anodic and cathodic peaks of the following cycles are highly overlapped with those of the second cycle, indicating a stable reversible electrochemical reaction.
The CV curves of Co0.85Se microspheres are quite similar to those of Co0.85Se nanosheets, indicating that similar electrochemical reactions occur during the cycles (Fig. 6b). However, after the first cycle, the peak intensities of both anodic and cathodic peaks of Co0.85Se microspheres are decreased significantly. This indicates that the electrochemical activity of microspheres is poorer than that of the nanosheets. Furthermore, Li-ion storage properties of Co0.85Se nanosheets and microspheres are also evaluated by galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements (Fig. 6c and d). The initial discharge and charge capacities of the nanosheets are 887 and 675 mA h g−1, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for the microspheres are 811 and 650 mA h g−1 (Fig. 5d). The observed irreversible specific capacities are typically ascribed to the growth of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) film on the surface of active materials.16,17 Noticeably, the reversible capacities of both nanosheets and microspheres are beyond the theoretical capacity (i.e. 415 mA h g−1), which is calculated by the uptake of 2 mol Li into 1 mol Co0.85Se. This phenomenon is usually observed in metal chalcogenides such as MoS2,9–11 MoSe2,16,17 CoS6,7etc., which is possibly due to storage of Li in the interface of active materials.16,17 Moreover, the exact Li-ion storage mechanism shall be investigated in the following work.

Fig. 7a exhibits the rate performance of the two samples. Compared to Co0.85Se microspheres, layered Co0.85Se nanosheets exhibit a much better high-rate performance. At higher current densities of 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, the reversible capacities of the nanosheets can reach up to 645, 574, 493 and 374 mA h g−1, which maintain about 95, 85, 73 and 55% of capacity at 100 mA g−1, respectively. After the current density returns to 100 mA g−1, the reversible capacity can be maintained as high as ca. 510 mA h g−1, which is 82% of the first reversible capacity of 675 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Moreover, the specific capacity of the microspheres is decreased more rapidly than that of the nanosheets with the current densities increasing. The reversible capacities of the microspheres are decreased steeply from 650 to 573, 466, 343 and 211 mA h g−1 with the current densities increasing from 100 to 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, which are about 88, 72, 53 and 32% of capacity at 100 mA g−1, respectively.

Moreover, Co0.85Se nanosheets also exhibit a much better cyclic performance than that of the microspheres. Fig. 7b displays the cyclic performance of Co0.85Se nanosheets and microspheres at 200 mA g−1 (ca. 0.5 C). The initial reversible capacity of Co0.85Se nanosheets is up to 650 mA h g−1, and the capacity can be maintained at 516 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, which is ca. 79% of initial reversible capacity. For Co0.85Se microspheres, the reversible capacity is decreased gradually from the initial 581 to 170 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, and capacity retention is only 29%. At a higher current density of 500 mA g−1 (ca. 1.2 C), the reversible capacity of the microspheres is decreased rapidly from the initial 576 to 50 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, and capacity retention is only 9%, while the capacity of the microspheres is maintained at 295 mA h g−1, which is ca. 50% of initial reversible capacity (Fig. 7c). Therefore, it can be concluded that both specific capacity and cyclic stability of Co0.85Se nanosheets are better than those of Co0.85Se microspheres. It should be mentioned that, although the cyclic performance of Co0.85Se nanosheets is better than that of Co0.85Se microspheres, it is still unsatisfactory for long-term cyclic stability. This is a general drawback for pure TMC electrodes,9–18 which would be related to pulverization of pure TMCs during charge/discharge processes. Further work is in progress to improve the cyclic stability of Co0.85Se nanosheets by combining them with nanocarbons.
The enhancement of rate-performance and cyclic stability of the nanosheets can be ascribed to their unique two-dimensional layered structures. First, nanosheet-like structures benefit the diffusion of the Li-ion in the host materials. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms in Fig. S5† show the mesoporous characteristic of both Co0.85Se nanosheets and microspheres. The specific surface area of the nanosheets (45 m2 g−1) is obviously larger than that of the microspheres (35 m2 g−1), which means that the nanosheets will provide more Li-ion diffusion channels. Second, nanosheet-like structures can help to improve the conductivity of Co0.85Se. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of both Co0.85Se nanosheets and microspheres, as shown in Fig. 7d, reveal a depressed semicircle in the high- and middle-frequency regions and a straight line in the low-frequency region. The depressed semicircle can be attributed to the formation of the SEI film, contact resistance in high frequency coupled with charge-transfer resistance in mid-frequency, respectively. Fig. 7d shows that the semicircle of the nanosheets is obviously smaller than that of the microspheres. In order to obtain a quantitative analysis, the EIS is modelled by an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S6.† By calculation, the surface film resistance (Rf) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the microspheres are ca. 10.4 and 94.9 Ω, respectively. Both Rf (5.5 Ω) and Rct (56.3 Ω) of the nanosheets are much lower than those of the microsphere electrode, indicating the formation of a better conductive network in the layered Co0.85Se nanosheets. Finally, the nanosheet electrode can better withstand the breakage of Li-ion diffusions than the microsphere electrode. It can be seen that after 50 cycles the Co0.85Se nanosheet electrode still retains the smooth surface and nanosheet structures, while Co0.85Se microspheres have been pulverized into 100–200 nm small nanoparticles and the surface of the electrode is seriously rough (Fig. S7†). It indicates that flexible Co0.85Se nanosheets can be combined with a binder and a conductor to prevent the active materials from falling off the electrode.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared layered Co0.85Se nanosheets for the first time in solution using Na2SeO3 and Co(AC)2 as precursors. The formation mechanism of layered Co0.85Se nanosheets is attributed to the 2D OA growth of Co0.85Se preliminary nanocrystals. The as-prepared Co0.85Se nanosheets exhibit high specific capacitance and excellent rate-performance for Li-ion storage. The facile synthesis of materials and superior electrochemical properties of our 2D Co0.85Se layered structures have provided an important pathway for the development of 2D TMC materials and exhibited huge potential for their applications in next generation LIBs.
