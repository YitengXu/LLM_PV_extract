    , Accepted 25th April 2016First published on 26th April 2016AbstractAchieving the state-of-the-art performance of solution processable and flexible organic electronics requires efficient, stable, and cost-effective interfacial layers (ILs). Here, we report an alcohol soluble phosphine oxide functionalized 1,3,5-triazine derivative (PO-TAZ) as an IL, which remarkably tailors the work function of conductors including metals, transparent metal oxides and organic materials, making it an ideal candidate for an interfacial material in organic electronics. Consequently, PO-TAZ thin films enable the fabrication of organic and organic–inorganic (perovskite) solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 10.04% and 16.41%, respectively, and n-channel organic field-effect transistors with an electron mobility of 8 cm2 V−1 s−1. Owing to the low-cost processing associated with PO-TAZ and the tremendous improvement in device performances as compared to the devices without PO-TAZ along with ambient stability, PO-TAZ is a good choice for efficient organic electronics in large area printing processes.

Broader context
Recently, developing a solution-processed stable interfacial layer (IL) has been an important topic in the field of organic electronics for high device performance and stability. Even though, various efficient ILs have already been reported, low chemical and ambient stability, intricate synthetic and purification methodologies, poor batch-to-batch reproducibility, and high vacuum-based expensive film deposition processes hinder their compatibility with large-area roll-to-roll processing technology, which is required for low-cost flexible organic electronics. Therefore, it is thus extremely desirable to find an efficient IL to avoid the aforementioned problems. Here, we report various highly efficient and stable organic electronic devices by introducing a new neutral organic small molecule based on 1,3,5-triazine, i.e., PO-TAZ, as an IL for the first time. PO-TAZ is easily processable using environmentally friendly solvents, and it exhibits excellent performances in various organic electronic applications such as organic–, organic–inorganic (perovskite) solar cells and organic field-effect transistor devices. PO-TAZ is very simple, easy to synthesize and cost effective, and it can be applicable to other devices to validate its potential and to achieve milestone efficiency for the corresponding devices. This work paves the way for realizing high-performance organic electronic devices in the near future.

1. Introduction
To facilitate electron injection/extraction in modern optoelectronic devices, the incorporation of interfacial layers into air-stable metal electrodes has been widely used.1–3 The appropriate choice of interfacial materials provides a platform to precisely regulate the electrode work function (Φ), protect the semiconductor layer from the diffusion of metals, and mitigate charge accumulation and recombination at the electrodes.4,5 Various materials, such as CsF, LiF, Cs2CO3,6 conjugated7 and non-conjugated polyelectrolytes,8 and fullerene derivatives,9,10 have been utilized for improving electron injection/extraction properties. However, several challenges remain to overcome for the affordable use of the interfacial layer (IL) in printed and large-area devices, such as low chemical and ambient stability, intricate synthetic and purification methodologies, poor batch-to-batch reproducibility, and high vacuum-based expensive film deposition processes. Here, we report a solution-processable phosphine oxide (PO) functionalized 1,3,5-triazine derivative [PO-TAZ, 2-(3-(diphenylphosphoryl)-2,4-difluorophenyl)-4,6-diphenoxy-1,3,5-triazine] as an effective IL in organic solar cells (OSCs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and n-channel organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). PO-TAZ is a very simple structured organic small molecule (Fig. 1a) synthesized by a simple protocol using inexpensive 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (cyanuric chloride) as a starting material. PO-TAZ possesses good solubility in environmentally friendly solvents, e.g., alcohols, owing to the presence of a polar PO group, ensuring compatibility with large-area printing processes. Pioneering studies showed that the PO functional group remarkably reduces the Φ value of Al and Ag by the formation of an interfacial dipole at the semiconductor/electrode interface.11,12 In addition, 1,3,5-triazine-based compounds are well known to be efficient electron transport layers in organic light-emitting diodes.13 Thus, PO-TAZ was designed by combining the functions of both the PO and 1,3,5-triazine moieties and is expected to facilitate electron injection/extraction in organic electronics. The detailed synthetic scheme, procedures, 1H NMR of PO-TAZ, absorption spectra and thermal gravimetric analysis are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S1a and S2). It is noteworthy to acknowledge that pure PO-TAZ is readily obtained by a simple column chromatography technique, which demonstrates more potential than fullerene derivatives and polymer-based interlayer materials, which require intricate synthesis and purification methods. Furthermore, the purification of PO-TAZ via a train sublimation technique also proved the compatibility of PO-TAZ with the vacuum deposition technique.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis of PO-TAZ and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements
PO-TAZ was synthesized as shown in Fig. S1a, ESI:† the intermediate 1 (2-chloro-4,6-diphenoxy-1,3,5-triazine) was prepared by the reaction between cyanuric chloride and phenol in the presence of sodium hydroxide. Then, the chlorine-substituted 1,3,5-triazine unit was coupled with 2,4-difluorobenzeneboronic acid using a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction to give intermediate 2. Finally, PO-TAZ was obtained in a three-step process: regioselective lithiation of intermediate 2, coupling with chlorodiphenylphosphine, and oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. The thermal stability of PO-TAZ was found to be over 300 °C (Fig. S1b, ESI†) and the optical band gap (Eoptg) of PO-TAZ was measured to be 3.99 eV (Fig. S1c, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PO-TAZ was measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and found to be −6.96 eV (Fig. 1b) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of PO-TAZ was calculated to be −2.97 eV from Eoptg and the HOMO. The deep HOMO level for PO-TAZ is due to the presence of the 1,3,5-triazine unit14 in the molecular structure of PO-TAZ. Additionally, the study of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy core level spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†) of PO-TAZ films on Al shows the interaction at the interface between PO-TAZ and Al (coupling between PO and Al). The UPS spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†) of PO-TAZ on ITO displayed a shift in Φ from 4.4 to 2.68 eV, indicating the formation of an interfacial dipole. Additionally, as a further evidence of the effect of PO-TAZ, the photoemission onset of a ZnO film on ITO shifts towards the higher energy direction upon the deposition of PO-TAZ (Fig. 1c), whereas no shift was seen in the valence band region after introduction of PO-TAZ (Fig. 1d). Fig. 2a shows PO-TAZ as an insulating layer in both conventional OSCs and inverted OSCs (IOSCs) with the LUMO level at −2.97 eV. The interfacial dipole between the electrode and the PO-TAZ layer in OSCs, as well as between ZnO and the PO-TAZ layer in IOSCs, is responsible for the observed improvement in charge carrier injection. Due to the shift in the vacuum level in the solid state, the energy barrier for electron injection and collection could be reduced, as shown schematically in Fig. 2b. The decrease in Φ would also result in the increase in the built-in potential (VBI) in conventional OSC and IOSC devices, thus facilitating electron extraction.

2.2. Conventional organic solar cells
Solution-processed conventional OSCs were fabricated using PO-TAZ as the IL with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer containing a blend of poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl] thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl] (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) with the following structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/PTB7:PC71BM (100 nm)/PO-TAZ (5 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 2c). The corresponding devices employing pristine Al, LiF/Al, and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3PO)/Al were also fabricated for a comparative study. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for typical OSCs based on pristine Al, LiF/Al, Ph3PO/Al, and PO-TAZ/Al are shown in Fig. 2d. The optimized OSCs with a pristine Al electrode gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.75%, whereas devices with PO-TAZ yielded a PCE of 7.72%, which is 63.9% higher than the control device (Table 1 and Table S1, ESI†). Along with enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc), the fill factor (FF) was found to be 68.81%, which is higher than that of the control device with an FF of 51.79%, resulting from smaller series resistance (RS) as compared to the control device without PO-TAZ, signifying the effective reduction of the contact resistance (Rc) by the formation of an interface dipole between the fullerene derivative and the Al electrode.15,16 This enhancement is well apparent from the UPS spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†), where the secondary cut-off of the PTB7:PC71BM layer with PO-TAZ shifts to the higher energy direction by 0.51 eV, compared with that of only the PTB7:PC71BM layer. This shift is related to the reduction in the vacuum level of the PTB7:PC71BM layer with PO-TAZ. The dipole layer of PO-TAZ shifts the vacuum level of the adjacent negative electrode layer upwards, leading to better electron transport and extraction when aligned with Al. The PCE of the PO-TAZ-based device is also better than that of OSCs with thermally deposited LiF/Al (PCE = 7.14%). From the structural point of view, both PO-TAZ and Ph3PO possess a polar PO group, which is proposed to modify the Φ of the cathode by interaction of PO with Al.11 The OSCs with PO-TAZ outperform those with Ph3PO, owing to higher Voc (0.70 to 0.74 V) and FF (57.71 to 68.81%). Hence, our molecular design strategy of coupling the 1,3,5-triazine moiety with the PO group leads to a deeper HOMO level (compared to the HOMO level of Ph3PO17) and significantly larger interfacial dipoles. The increase in Jsc for the PO-TAZ device is further supported by external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, which exhibit enhanced light response in the whole 300–800 nm absorption region (Fig. S6a, ESI†).

To understand the effect of PO-TAZ from a topographic perspective, atomic force microscopy was used (Fig. S7, ESI†). The pristine PTB7:PC71BM blend on ITO displayed a smooth surface root mean square roughness of 0.92 nm, while the surface of PTB7:PC71BM with PO-TAZ developed a slightly rougher surface (1.42 nm). We also investigated the wetting properties of PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM/PO-TAZ films with water (Fig. S8, ESI†). The water contact angle of pristine PTB7:PC71BM film was 119° and it was reduced to 92.1° with PO-TAZ and the calculated surface energy showed that PO-TAZ reduced the interfacial tension between the photoactive layer and the electrode (Table S2, ESI†).18 As a result, we expect better electronic contact between the photoactive layer and the cathode.
2.3. Inverted organic solar cells
To investigate the potential use of PO-TAZ as the IL in IOSCs, we fabricated IOSCs with the following configuration: ITO/ZnO (60 nm)/PO-TAZ (5 nm)/PTB7:PC71BM (100 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (10 nm)/Ag (150 nm) (Fig. 2e).19,20 The inverted configuration with ZnO as an electron transport layer was chosen owing to the demonstration of high PCEs in the literature.21 The IOSCs without PO-TAZ exhibited a maximum PCE of 8.72%, whereas the IOSCs with PO-TAZ showed a maximum PCE of 9.93% (Table 1, Fig. 2f and Fig. S6b, ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, the present PCE results using PTB7 with a neutral organic small molecule as an IL are among the highest efficiencies of single junction IOSCs reported so far.22 The beneficial effect of the ZnO/PO-TAZ-based device is that there is accompanied improvement in Voc, Jsc, and FF compared to the pristine ZnO-based devices, arising from the significantly improved Φ shift (Fig. 1c and d). The shift in Φ leads to a reduced electrostatic potential at the ZnO surface owing to the interfacial dipole created by the interaction between the PO group of PO-TAZ and the ZnO surface. Thus, the observed linear relationship between the Φ shift and the interfacial dipole (i.e., dipole moment) suggests that ZnO/PO-TAZ is more effective than the pristine ZnO layer (as ZnO also induces an interfacial dipole) in charge transport and extraction. The enhanced Φ shift induced due to PO-TAZ on the ZnO layer is well articulated using the working principle as shown in Fig. S9, ESI.† As illustrated under flat band conditions, the conduction band of the ZnO layer with PO-TAZ is shifted toward the lower energy direction by 0.4 eV, leading to an increase in VBI, which contributes to the improved Voc (from 0.72 to 0.74 V, Table 1). In addition, the increase in VBI resulting from the introduction of PO-TAZ causes large energy band bending of the photoactive layer under short-circuit conditions (i.e., Fermi levels [EF] of metal electrodes in metal–organic semiconductor–metal structures are aligned to equilibrium). For the ZnO/PO-TAZ device, the bending of the conduction becomes much steeper than that of the device without PO-TAZ, thus facilitating fast extraction of the photogenerated electrons from the ZnO/PO-TAZ layer compared to that of only the ZnO layer, as supported by the decreased RS values (from 3.1 to 1.81 Ω cm2, Fig. S10, ESI†) and thus preventing undesired charge recombination. In addition, the contact angle of water increased from 37.3° (ZnO surface) to 48° (ZnO/PO-TAZ surface). The hydrophobic moieties of PO-TAZ are located on the film surface, whereas the polar group tends to be located near the hydrophilic ZnO (Fig. S11, ESI†). Henceforth, ZnO/PO-TAZ forms an intimate interfacial contact with the photoactive layer. It has to be mentioned that even though PO-TAZ is very thin (5 nm), PO-TAZ does a lot to improve the PCE of the whole device via improving the electron extraction and transport properties.
To verify the accessibility of PO-TAZ in varying photoactive layers in the device, we fabricated IOSCs using a more prominent narrow band gap polymer, poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) (Table 1 and Fig. S12, ESI†). The devices with PO-TAZ showed a much improved PCE of 10.04%, which is higher than that of the device without PO-TAZ (PCE = 8.55%). To analyse the significant effect of PO-TAZ on the electron transport properties of the interlayers, we fabricated electron-only devices containing ZnO and ZnO/PO-TAZ and measured the space charge limited current (SCLC) electron mobility (μSCLC,e). The ZnO/PO-TAZ-based device showed an μSCLC,e of 1.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is two times higher than the μSCLC,e of ZnO with a value of 6.55 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S13, ESI†). The mobility results are well aligned with the higher FF and the improved dark current (forward bias), as shown in Fig. S10, ESI.† The impedance spectroscopy is carried out to study the detailed electrical properties of the PTB7:PC71BM photoactive layer and/or the interface between each layer. The impedance spectroscopy study showed a reduction in the interfacial resistance between the photoactive layer and the ITO electrode (Fig. S14a, ESI†). The ZnO/PO-TAZ device has a significantly reduced bulk resistance as seen from the decreased radius in the Nyquist plot. In addition, the lifetimes of the charge carriers are estimated from impedance spectra. The high frequency peak in the Bode plot depicts the charge transfer and the reciprocal of this frequency defines the effective electron lifetime (Fig. S14b, ESI†).23 The electron lifetime of IOSCs with and without PO-TAZ was calculated to be 23.4 and 7.4 μs, respectively, indicating that the device with PO-TAZ undergoes less charge recombination and more efficient carrier transport. We investigated the capacitance (C)–voltage (V) measurements to understand the impact of the insertion of the PO-TAZ layer between the semiconductor and the electrode on the internal electric field in IOSCs.24 In OSC and IOSC devices, the intrinsic p-doped nature of the semiconducting polymer leads to the formation of a Schottky contact between the electrode and the photoactive layer. The higher doped layers confine the electrical field in the vicinity of the cathode, allowing the extraction of the flat-band potential (VFB) and charge carrier concentration. To estimate the VFB, the C–V characteristics were determined by applying a low AC perturbation signal with fixed frequency and sweeping the DC bias and then further examined using the following Mott–Schottky equation: C−2 = 2(VFB − V)/A2eεrε0N.24 Here, V, e, εr, ε0, N, A, and C denote the bias voltage, charge, relative dielectric constant (εr = 3), permittivity in vacuum, charge carrier concentration, device active area, and capacitance, respectively. The linear region under low forward bias is related to the formation of a Schottky contact and can be fitted to a plot of C−2versus V. VFB can be evaluated by the extrapolation of C−2 = 0 (Fig. S14c, ESI†). The extracted VFB is closely related to the VBI for an identical active layer and a positive variation of VFB is the result of an increased VBI.25 The PO-TAZ/ZnO device shows a higher VFB (0.783 V) compared to 0.741 V of the ZnO based device, owing to the lowering of the Φ of the ZnO layer. This increase in VFB matches the increase in the Voc with PO-TAZ in IOSCs and indicates that the insertion of the new IL induces strengthening of the built-in field, leading to a positive effect on Jsc and FF as a result of more efficient charge extraction and reduction of charge recombination. Finally, we examined the long-term stability of non-encapsulated PTB7:PC71BM-based IOSC devices with and without PO-TAZ stored in air under ambient conditions and their efficiency was measured periodically as shown in Fig. 2g.
2.4. Perovskite solar cells
To further prove the generality of this material, we applied PO-TAZ in methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3)-based planar PSCs with the configuration: ITO/ZnO (60 nm)/PO-TAZ (5 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (250 nm)/Spiro-OMeTAD (200 nm)/Ag (Fig. 3a). The same device without PO-TAZ was used as comparison and the energy level diagrams of those components are shown in Fig. 3b. The device cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image indicates uniform deposition of layers in PSCs (Fig. 3c). Accordingly, the PSCs with ZnO/PO-TAZ showed a significantly improved PCE of 16.41% with an RS of 1.53 Ω cm2 and an Rsh of 27.1 kΩ cm2 compared to PSCs without PO-TAZ with a PCE of 13.92%, with an RS of 3.72 Ω cm2 and an Rsh of 15.5 kΩ cm2, respectively (Fig. 3d, e and Fig. S15a, ESI†). The PCE of 16.41% is one of the best efficiencies reported so far for PSCs with planar heterojunction architecture.26,27 The dramatically higher PCEs of PSCs with PO-TAZ could be ascribed to the improved Jsc and FF, which is consistent with the reduced barrier for carrier extraction into the ITO/ZnO electrode. As shown in Fig. 3f, the PSCs with PO-TAZ showed a slightly higher EQE maximum of 88.19% at 580 nm than that of PSCs without PO-TAZ of 84.80% at the same wavelength. The reduced RS and the enhanced Rsh indicate that the thin PO-TAZ layer reduces the electronic barrier between CH3NH3PbI3 and ZnO layers to improve the photodiode characteristics. To check the reproducibility of device performance, we tested 20 PSC devices that were fabricated with or without PO-TAZ. The PSC devices with PO-TAZ exhibited a high degree of reproducibility in the overall average PCE, when compared to the PSC devices without PO-TAZ (Fig. S15b and c, ESI†).

2.5. Organic field-effect transistors
To demonstrate the versatile potential of PO-TAZ for other organic electronic devices, we further investigate PO-TAZ as the IL in n-channel OFETs. Typically, n-channel OFETs suffer from the existence of a large electron injection barrier owing to the energetic mismatch between the LUMO of commonly used organic semiconductors and Au source and drain electrodes.28 Thus n-channel OFETs were fabricated with poly[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4:5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene) [P(NDI2OD-T2)], PC71BM, and poly[2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-(E)-[2,2-bithiophen]-5-yl-3-(thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile]-co-selenophene-vinylene-selenophene (CNTVT:SVS, 9:1) (Fig. 1a) as n-channel semiconductors and having a top-gate, bottom-contact [TG/BC, architecture = glass/Au (S/D)/semiconductor/PMMA/Au] and a bottom gate, top contact [BG/TC, architecture = n++Si/SiO2/Au (S/D)/semiconductor] structures. Fig. 4a–c, display the typical transfer and output characteristics of PC71BM, P(NDI2OD-T2), and CNTVT:SVS (9:1) OFETs, respectively. All OFET device parameters are summarized in Table 2, which clearly demonstrate the beneficial effect of employing the PO-TAZ interlayer. Thus, the field-effect electron mobility (μFET,e) of PC71BM, P(NDI2OD-T2), and CNTVT:SVS (9:1) devices increases by ∼60%, 300%, and 90% upon Au functionalization with PO-TAZ. For instance, CNTVT:SVS (9:1) OFETs achieve a μFET,e value of 7.4 ± 0.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 (from 5.6 ± 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) for a relatively low process temperature (∼150 °C).29,30 The mobility improvement in these OFETs is due to Rc reduction for electron injection by ∼100% upon PO-TAZ functionalization (Table 2). The effect of PO-TAZ on the OFET performance is almost comparable with other previously reported charge injection layers, such as CsF and PEIE.31,32 However, the greatest benefits of PO-TAZ are the intrinsic stability of this material, highly improved device stability (vide infra) and low temperature processing.

One major issue in n-channel OFETs is their poor ambient and bias stress stability, which mainly results from trap sites concentrated around 3.8 eV owing to hydrated O2 in air.33 The characteristics of P(NDI2OD-T2) and PC71BM OFETs may be altered after exposure to air since these organic semiconductors have borderline LUMO energy (4.0 and 3.7 eV, respectively) for stabilizing these trap sites. The inefficient charge injection from the Au electrode in n-channel OFETs is another source of instability. Thus, we also investigated the ambient and operational stability of P(NDI2OD-T2) and PC71BM OFETs with and without PO-TAZ. P(NDI2OD-T2) OFETs with PO-TAZ showed excellent ambient and operational stability (Fig. 4d and e). The electron mobility of PO-TAZ treated OFETs was almost unchanged after 24 h storage in air. For comparison, the electron mobility of OFETs with pristine Au or CsF treated Au showed more rapid degradation after 120 h. Interestingly, OFETs with a CsF interlayer showed faster degradation than pristine devices even though CsF devices provide better device performance via improved electron injection properties. This is presumably owing to the hygroscopic nature of CsF.34 After 5 days of storage in air, the electron mobility of the PO-TAZ treated OFET slightly decreased (<20%), whereas the electron mobility of the CsF treated or pristine device significantly decreased (45–60%). In addition, P(NDI2OD-T2) OFETs with PO-TAZ exhibit best bias stress stability with only 5% decrease of electron mobility after 50 cycling scans (Fig. S16, ESI†). However, OFETs with CsF or pristine Au showed a more rapid decrease of electron mobility during the cycling test. We also observed the same trend of ambient and bias stress stability with PC71BM OFETs with PO-TAZ and pristine Au (Fig. S17, ESI†). These results indicate that unoptimal contact can accelerate the degradation of these OFETs by generation of joule-heat during the electron injection process.35
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, PO-TAZ, a small molecule containing both the PO group and the 1,3,5-triazine moiety, was developed and utilized as an IL for various organic electronic devices. The competency of PO-TAZ is similar to earlier reported efficient interlayers, with the major advantages of easy and simple synthetic design leading to a high degree of purity of the material combined with the application advantage of both wet coating and vacuum deposition techniques, resulting in the reproducibility of device performance and long-term stability. Incorporation of PO-TAZ in organic and perovskite solar cells as well as n-channel OFETs resulted in impressive performance enhancements, which opens the pathway for mass production in large area printing processes. Such high performances in thin film solar cells and OFET devices are achieved by a combination of favourable Φ controlling of the electrode and the interfacial modification capability of PO-TAZ. Our findings indicate that PO-functionalized 1,3,5-triazine derivatives are exceptional scaffolds for interfacial modification of semiconductors/electrodes in a wide range of optoelectronic devices.

Broader context
Recently, developing a solution-processed stable interfacial layer (IL) has been an important topic in the field of organic electronics for high device performance and stability. Even though, various efficient ILs have already been reported, low chemical and ambient stability, intricate synthetic and purification methodologies, poor batch-to-batch reproducibility, and high vacuum-based expensive film deposition processes hinder their compatibility with large-area roll-to-roll processing technology, which is required for low-cost flexible organic electronics. Therefore, it is thus extremely desirable to find an efficient IL to avoid the aforementioned problems. Here, we report various highly efficient and stable organic electronic devices by introducing a new neutral organic small molecule based on 1,3,5-triazine, i.e., PO-TAZ, as an IL for the first time. PO-TAZ is easily processable using environmentally friendly solvents, and it exhibits excellent performances in various organic electronic applications such as organic–, organic–inorganic (perovskite) solar cells and organic field-effect transistor devices. PO-TAZ is very simple, easy to synthesize and cost effective, and it can be applicable to other devices to validate its potential and to achieve milestone efficiency for the corresponding devices. This work paves the way for realizing high-performance organic electronic devices in the near future.
