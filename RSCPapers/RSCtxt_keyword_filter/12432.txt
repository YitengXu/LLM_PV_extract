    , Accepted 3rd April 2015First published on 8th April 2015AbstractThe structural design of TiO2 photoanodes has proved to be a useful approach in improving the energy conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, a bilayer TiO2 photoanode consisting of rutile nanowires (NWs) infiltrated with anatase nanoparticles (NPs) as a bottom layer and spherical voids (450 nm) in a NP film as the top layer is prepared via a simple one-time spray technique on a 1D TiO2 NW array. The bilayer structure exhibits an excellent dye-loading property and efficient light scattering ability, as confirmed by dye-desorption, diffuse transmittance and reflectance spectra, and incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) results. As a result, the DSSC based on the bilayer photoanode ((1.6 + 2.6) μm) exhibits remarkably higher photocurrent output and overall energy conversion efficiency (3.2 times and 3.5 times higher, respectively) than a 1D TiO2 NW device (1.6 μm) under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation. The enhanced device performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of a large surface area for sufficient dye-loading, efficient light scattering for sufficient light harvesting, fast charge transport for efficient charge collection and a highly porous structure of the top spherical voids layer for fast diffusion of the I−/I3− electrolyte in the bilayer TiO2 photoanode. This study provides a facile route towards improving the photovoltaic performance of 1D TiO2 NW array solar cells based on constructing bilayer structures via a simple one-time spray technique.
1. Introduction
Since the breakthrough work reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 DSSCs have been extensively studied as one of the most promising systems for solar-to-electrical energy conversion because they are made from cheap materials and by lower-cost processing steps.2–6 A typical DSSC is composed of a dye-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 photoanode, a redox couple generally containing iodide/triiodied (I−/I3−) and a counter electrode.7,8 Several recent major advances in the design of photoanode nanostructures,9,10 dyes,11–14 electrolytes15,16 and counter electrodes17–20 in DSSCs have led to record power conversion efficiencies. In particular, the nanostructured photoanode, which serves as a dye carrier and electron transporter, is one of the key components in DSSCs. Photoanodes with large internal surface area for sufficient dye-loading, an excellent light scattering effect for sufficient light harvesting and fast charge transport for efficient charge collection are key factors in obtaining high-performance DSSCs.21 TiO2 has attracted extensive research interest for hydrogen production,22,23 photocatalysis24 and photovoltaic applications.25 For use in DSSCs, the TiO2 photoanode is generally composed of nanometer-sized TiO2 particles with high internal surface areas for a large amount of dye loading.26,27 However, the NP film is always transparent to visible light due to its small particle size, resulting in a significant portion of input sunlight transmitting through the photoanode without being harvested.28 On the other hand, one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures such as nanotube arrays, NW arrays, nanobelts and nanorods have been extensively investigated as photoanode materials in DSSCs due to their excellent photo-generated charge separation and transport properties.29–34 However, the insufficient surface areas of 1D nanostructures have limited the device performance to relatively low levels.35
In this regard, structural design is considered to be a useful approach to make these factors compatible in one TiO2 photoanode. One design approach is to construct 1D heterostructures.36 For example, we have fabricated such a heterostructure for a DSSC photoanode by infiltrating a 1D rutile NW array with anatase NPs, which can combine the advantages of fast electron transport of a NW array and large dye-loading capacity provided by NPs;37 Agrios et al. reported that a ZnO NW–TiO2 NP heterostructure yielded good charge collection and light harvesting in DSSCs.8 A second approach is to design multifunctional hierarchical structures such as branched or 3D morphologies that are particularly advantageous in surface area, light scattering and charge transport.38–43 A third approach is to form layered structures, which generally consist of an active layer and a top scattering layer. The active layer is usually composed of conventional NPs or a 1D NW array, and the top scattering layer can be 3D mesoporous beads, spherical aggregates, fibrous nanowires and hollow spherical structures.44–50
Herein, we construct a bilayer TiO2 photoanode in which the bottom layer is composed of rutile NWs infiltrated with anatase NPs, and the top layer is composed of disordered spherical voids (450 nm) in an NP film. The idea is to introduce NPs with large surface areas for dye-loading and a spherical voids layer with light scattering effects to improve the light harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 NW array while maintaining its excellent electron transport feature. The bilayer structure labeled as TiO2 NW–NP/SVL (spherical voids layer) is prepared by a simple one-time spray technique on a 1D TiO2 NW array. Experimental results show that the dye-sensitized TiO2 NW–NP/SVL bilayer structure displays significantly enhanced light harvesting efficiency compared to a 1D TiO2 NW array. In addition, the highly porous structure of the spherical voids top layer ensures the porosity of the film, feasibly facilitating diffusion of the I−/I3− electrolyte and improving device FF. As a result, under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation, a DSSC based on the TiO2 NW–NP/SVL bilayer photoanode with a film thickness of (1.6 + 2.6) μm exhibits 3.2 times higher photocurrent output and thus 3.5 times higher conversion efficiency than the 1D TiO2 NW device (1.6 μm).
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Tetrabutyl titanate (98%), titanium chloride (99%), and concentrated hydrochloric acid (36–37%) were received from Beijing Chemical Works. Hexachloroplatanic acid was received from Wako chemicals. Anatase TiO2 sol (STS-01) and monodisperse polystyrene spheres were obtained from Ishihara Sangyo. The N719 dye was obtained from Solaronix. Anhydrous acetonitrile and valeronitrile were received from Acros. 1-Propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) and guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) were received from Heptachroma. 4-tert-Butylpyridine was received from TCI. F-doped SnO2 transparent conducting glass substrates (FTO) were obtained from Nippon Sheet Glass (15 Ω □−1).
2.2 TiO2 NW photoanode preparation
Rutile TiO2 NW arrays were prepared on bare FTO substrates via a hydrothermal method following the previously reported procedure.51 In brief, clean FTO substrates (1.25 × 2.5 cm2) were placed upright in autoclaves containing tetrabutyl titanate (98%), concentrated hydrochloric acid (36–38%) and deionized water at a volume ratio of 1:40:40 with the conductive side facing the wall. The autoclaves were heated to 150 °C and kept at a constant temperature for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature in air, the FTO substrates were taken out of the autoclaves, rinsed with deionized water, dried in air, and annealed at 450 °C for 20 min in order to remove any organic ingredients.
2.3 TiO2 NW–NP/SVL photoanode preparation
Monodisperse polystyrene spheres (PS, 10 wt% of 450 nm spherical PS particles dispersed in water) were mixed with anatase TiO2 sol (0.043 g mL−1, ∼20 nm) in a volume ratio of 5:1. The mixture was then placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to obtain a TiO2 NP/PS suspension.49 The suspension was then sprayed using a needle-like automizer onto the as-prepared TiO2 NW array that was placed on a hotplate (T = 60 °C). After the spray process, the photoanode was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min with the temperature increasing at a rate of 5 °C min−1 to burn out the PS particles and simultaneously form a bilayer structure with a bottom NW–NP composite layer and a top spherical voids layer. For comparison, a photoanode composed of only the bottom TiO2 NW–NP composite layer was formed by controlling the spray time. Next, the TiO2 NW–NP and NW–NP/SVL photoanodes were soaked in a TiCl4 (40 mM) aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min to enhance the necking of anatase NPs. Finally, the film was washed with deionized water, dried in air, and sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min.
2.4 DSSC device assembly
The as-prepared photoanodes were immersed overnight in N719 dye solution (0.3 mM in aqueous ethanol) at room temperature. The photoanodes were then taken out, rinsed with ethanol to remove unadsorbed dye molecules and dried in air. Platinized counter electrodes were prepared by the thermal decomposition of 0.05 M hexachloroplatinic acid in 2-propanol onto FTO substrates. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M PMII, 0.1 M GuSCN, 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile:valeronitrile (85:15). The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell, and the electrolyte was then injected into the space between the two electrodes to complete the cell fabrication. The active area of the TiO2 photoanode was determined as 0.1256 cm2.
2.5 Characterization
The morphologies of the photoanodes were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI Quanta 250 field-emission scanning electron microscope). Diffuse transmittance and reflectance spectra of the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were collected on a Lambda UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. The dye-loading amount was determined by desorbing dye molecules from a TiO2 film in 0.05 M NaOH aqueous solution and measuring the absorbance of the desorbed dye solution.
The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation from a Sun 2000 solar simulator (ABET technology). Incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were recorded on a homemade system containing a 450–1000 W Xe lamp (Newport, 66902), a Monochromator (Newport Cornerstone™ 260 1/4 M) and a Keithley 2400 Source Meter.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Technique and morphological characterization
The bilayer structure labeled as TiO2 NW–NP/SVL was obtained from a 1D TiO2 NW array by a simple one-time spray technique followed by annealing to remove PS particles. Fig. 1 schematically shows the synthetic procedure. As the TiO2 NP–PS suspension was sprayed onto the NW array, small anatase NPs (∼20 nm) penetrated into the NW pore space and filled the pores between individual NWs, forming a TiO2 NW–NP composite layer.52 Meanwhile, the large PS particles coated with NPs remained on top of the NW array, forming a spherical voids layer after post-annealing treatment. Fig. 2a and b present the surface and cross-sectional SEM images of the 1D TiO2 NW array used for the subsequent spray procedure. As has been reported in our previous research, TiO2 NWs are tetragonal in shape with square top facets and are almost vertical to the FTO substrate; they have average diameters of about 90 nm and lengths of 1.6 μm. Subsequently, the TiO2 NP–PS suspension was sprayed onto the NW array. The pore space filling of the bottom TiO2 NW–NP layer and the thickness of the top spherical voids layer can be controlled by the spray time. The SEM images in Fig. 2c and d show that when the spray time is 15 min, all the anatase NPs (∼20 nm) penetrate into the NW pore space, forming a monolayer TiO2 NW–NP structure with a film thickness that is the same as the TiO2 NW array. When the spray time is longer than 15 min, a spherical voids layer appears on top of the TiO2 NW–NP layer (1.6 μm), forming a bilayer structure. The SEM images in Fig. 2e–h reveal that the diameters of the spherical voids are ∼450 nm, and the two layers are in intimate contact without any apparent cracks due to the presence and homogeneous property of anatase NPs in both layers. We note that film thickness of the spherical voids layer increases with spray time. For example, when the spray time is extended to 20 min, the thickness of the spherical voids layer is about 1.6 μm (Fig. 2f). When the spray time is extended to 30 and 40 min, the layer thickness increases to about 2.6 μm (Fig. 2g) and 3.6 μm (Fig. 2h), respectively. Therefore, we can conclude that the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL structure has been successfully synthesized by a simple one-time spray technique based on the 1D TiO2 NW array.

3.2 Optical properties
For the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL structure, the bottom TiO2 NW–NP layer is advantageous in dye loading capacity and charge transport, as has been demonstrated in our previous work.37 Meanwhile, the top spherical voids layer can serve as a scattering layer to enhance light harvesting. To evaluate the light harvesting property of the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL structure, the sum of the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the dye-sensitized TiO2 NW, TiO2 NW–NP and TiO2 NW–NP/SVL (spray time: 30 min) films were measured. As shown in Fig. 3, the sum of transmittance and reflectance (T + R) is 36–68% for the dye-sensitized TiO2 NW film in the wavelength region of 400–800 nm. The light loss around 800 nm is mainly due to the light scattering of TiO2 NWs since dye molecules and TiO2 do not absorb light around this wavelength. As expected, the dye-sensitized bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL film exhibits a significantly lower (T + R) in the visible-light region of 400–800 nm, i.e. a higher light harvesting (∼11% at 520 nm), compared to the TiO2 NW film (∼57% at 520 nm). The increased dye-loading capacity should be one reason for the enhanced light harvesting. Dye-desorption measurements show that the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL film exhibits a dye-loading amount of ∼25.6 nmol cm−2, corresponding to a roughness factor of ∼246; for comparison, the dye-loading amount and roughness factor of the TiO2 NW film are ∼2.1 nmol cm−2 and ∼20.3, respectively. This 12-fold increase in roughness factor originates from the excellent dye-loading property of anatase NPs in the bottom layer. It is worth noting that when compared with the monolayer TiO2 NW–NP film, which has a dye-loading amount of ∼13.4 nmol cm−2 and a roughness factor of ∼129, the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL film exhibits a 1.9-fold increase in roughness factor. This observation indicates that the top spherical voids layer also possesses excellent dye-loading property which contributes to the increased dye-loading amount of bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL film. In addition, the light scattering property of the top spherical voids layer should be another reason for the enhanced light harvesting exhibited by the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL film. The top spherical voids layer can confine the incident light within the TiO2 NW–NP/SVL film and enhance light harvesting by dye molecules; the enhanced light harvesting in the wavelength region of 580–800 nm has demonstrated this point. Therefore, we can conclude that we have obtained a bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL structure that shows excellent sunlight harvesting by combining the large dye-loading property of both layers and light scattering ability of the top spherical voids layer.

3.3 Photovoltaic performance
The IPCE spectra of DSSCs assembled from TiO2 NW, TiO2 NW–NP and TiO2 NW–NP/SVL (spray time: 30 min) photoanodes are presented in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the IPCE of bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL DSSC is higher than that of the TiO2 NW device over the spectral range from 420 to 700 nm. The efficiency enhancement around 520 nm indicates that the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL device can generate more photoelectrons due to its large dye-loading amount, which is consistent with the results of the dye-loading measurements. From the efficiency enhancement at 550–700 nm revealed by normalized IPCE data, we note that compared with the TiO2 NW and TiO2 NW–NP devices, the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL DSSC can also improve light harvesting efficiency via the light scattering property of its top spherical voids layer.53 Therefore, the IPCE results yield additional evidence for the large dye-loading property and light scattering ability of the bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL photoanode in sunlight harvesting.

Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics of typical DSSCs assembled from TiO2 NW, TiO2 NW–NP and TiO2 NW–NP/SVL photoanodes with different spray times under AM1.5G simulated solar illumination. The cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. The 1.6 μm-long TiO2 NW-based DSSC exhibits an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 649 mV, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 3.02 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 58.3% and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of only 1.14%. In contrast, the 1.6 μm-long TiO2 NW–NP-based DSSC exhibits Voc, Jsc and FF values of 664 mV, 6.37 mA cm−2 and 62.1%, respectively, with an enhanced η of 2.62%. The performance improvement is mainly due to the increased light harvesting efficiency and charge collection efficiency of the TiO2 NW–NP photoanode compared to the TiO2 NW array, which has been reported in our previous research.37 The η values are improved for all DSSCs based on bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL structures. The TiO2 NW–NP/SVL-30 min-based DSSC exhibits Voc, Jsc and FF values of 644 mV, 9.79 mA cm−2 and 64.5%, respectively, along with the best overall conversion efficiency of 4.07%, which is about 3.5 times higher than that of the TiO2 NW device with a thickness of 1.6 μm. Efficiencies higher than 1.14% could be achieved by TiO2 NW devices with longer NWs; thus, in our case, an efficiency of ∼3.0% is expected to be reached by a 4.2 μm-long TiO2 NW device under the condition that the lateral dimensions of the NWs do not increase greatly with their axial dimensions. If we take an TiO2 NW device with an efficiency 3.0% as a reference, which was achieved by Aydil et al. using ∼4 μm-long NWs (roughness factor ∼200) synthesized by the same hydrothermal method used in the present study,32 a ∼36% enhancement of cell efficiency can still be observed, indicating the superiority of the 1D–3D bilayer photoanode compared with the 1D NW photoanode. Similar concepts have been demonstrated by many other groups.45–47,54 Although the final conversion efficiency (4.07%) is not competitive with state-of-the-art TiO2 NW array-based DSSCs (7–10%),42,43,47,55,56 considering that the film thickness ((1.6 + 2.6) μm) is less than 50% of that employed in the literature, the η value is still remarkable. We note that the device performances obtained from different batches of TiO2 NW–NP/SVL photoanodes exhibit small deviations (see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI†), indicating that the spray technique reported here is reproducible.

The enhanced performance of the TiO2 NW–NP/SVL device is mainly attributed to a 3.2-fold increase of photocurrent output (from 3.02 to 9.79 mA cm−2). The improved light harvesting due to the increased dye-loading amount and efficient light scattering effect are the main reasons for the enhanced photocurrent of the TiO2 NW–NP/SVL device, as demonstrated by the T + R and IPCE results. Moreover, the device fill factor increases from 58.3% for the TiO2 NW device to 64.5% for the TiO2 NW–NP/SVL device, which also contributes to the improvement in device performance. The presence of a rutile-anatase heterojunction should be one reason for the improved FF, which helps the rutile NWs to efficiently collect photo-injected electrons from anatase NPs. This has been demonstrated by open-circuit photovoltage decay and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements in our previous work.37 However, it is not the only reason for the differences with the TiO2 NW–NP device. The highly porous structure of the top spherical voids layer in the TiO2 NW–NP/SVL device should also contribute to the improved FF because it can feasibly facilitate the diffusion of the I−/I3− electrolyte in nanostructures.49 Due to the improvements in Jsc and FF, bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL structure-based solar cells achieve a significantly enhanced energy conversion efficiency of 4.07%. The better photovoltaic performance can be explained by the synergistic effect of a large surface area for sufficient dye-loading, efficient light scattering for sufficient light harvesting, fast charge transport for efficient charge collection and a highly porous structure of the spherical voids top layer for fast diffusion of the I−/I3− electrolyte in the bilayer TiO2 photoanode. In addition, when comparing DSSCs based on bilayer TiO2 NW–NP/SVL structures with different spherical voids layer thicknesses, we note that the photocurrent output increases with the spray time due to enhanced light harvesting. However, the Voc and FF values clearly decrease when the spray time extends to 40 min; this can be attributed to the presence of more surface trap states in the top spherical voids layer, which aggravates interfacial recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.50
4. Conclusions
In summary, a simple one-time spray technique was employed to successfully construct a bilayer TiO2 nanowire–nanoparticle/spherical voids layer structure based on a 1D TiO2 nanowire array. The bottom layer is composed of rutile nanowires infiltrated with anatase nanoparticles, and the top layer is composed of disordered spherical voids (450 nm) in a nanoparticle film. Experimental results demonstrate the large dye-loading capacity and efficient light scattering ability of the bilayer TiO2 nanowire–nanoparticle/spherical voids layer structure, which results in a significantly enhanced light harvesting efficiency. As an example, under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation, a dye-sensitized solar cell based on a bilayer TiO2 nanowire–nanoparticle/spherical voids layer photoanode with a thickness of (1.6 + 2.6) μm exhibits a 3.2 times higher photocurrent output than the 1D TiO2 nanowire device along with an overall energy conversion efficiency of 4.07%, which is 3.5 times higher than that of the TiO2 nanowire device. Combined analysis results confirm that the enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of a large surface area for sufficient dye-loading, efficient light scattering for sufficient light harvesting, fast charge transport for efficient charge collection and a highly porous structure of the spherical voids top layer for fast diffusion of the I−/I3− electrolyte in the bilayer TiO2 photoanode. These advantages render the novel bilayer TiO2 nanowire–nanoparticle/spherical voids layer structure a superior photoanode material for use in dye-sensitized solar cells.
