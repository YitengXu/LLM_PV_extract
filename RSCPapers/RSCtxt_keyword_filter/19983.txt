    , Accepted 1st July 2016First published on 1st July 2016AbstractThe CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells have been fabricated using three-porous-layered electrodes as, 〈glass/F-doped tin oxide (FTO)/dense TiO2/porous TiO2-perovskite/porous ZrO2-perovskite/porous carbon-perovskite〉 for light stability tests. Without encapsulation in air, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells maintained 80% of photoenergy conversion efficiency from the initial value up to 100 h under light irradiation (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). Considering the color variation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer, the significant improvement of light stability is due to the moisture-blocking effect of the porous carbon back electrodes. The strong interaction between carbon and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was proposed by the measurements of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction of the porous carbon-perovskite layers.
Introduction
In 2009, Miyasaka's group found a photovoltaic effect of CH3NH3PbX3 (X: I or Br) perovskite crystals on TiO2 electrodes with a 3.8% conversion efficiency using iodide liquid electrolytes,1 which was exchanged with an organic hole conductor (spiro-OMeTAD) to be solid state devices as 〈glass/F-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au〉 with around 10% conversion efficiencies of solar cells in 2012 by the groups of Miyasaka, Graetzel, Snaith, and Park.2,3 Afterwards, perovskite solar cells were investigated intensively and found to be over 20% conversion-efficiency solar cells.4–8 In the next step, the stability became a big issue for commercialization as solar cells. However, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal can react with water to give PbI2.9–11 At first, our group published the disadvantages of perovskite solar cells, which cannot survive for 16 h without sealing under light irradiation.12 It was found that perovskite solar cells could be stable “under dark conditions without sealing”3,13,14 or “under light with sealing”.2,15,16 In other points of view, without TiO2, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals can be stable “under light irradiation without encapsulation”.17 Therefore, it can be concluded that CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals can decompose rapidly with the co-existence of three elements: light, air and TiO2. Perovskite can be stable just with two elements out of the three. As for air, Haque's group found that O2 is not harmful to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite with light and TiO2.18 Hence, moisture in air should be blocked for the utilization of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite to be solar cells. Qi's group published the effect of spiro-OMeTAD to block moisture for perovskite and showed that pinholes in the spiro-OMeTAD layer deteriorated the photovoltaics of perovskite solar cells.19
There is only one paper about high stability of perovskite-TiO2 solar cells without encapsulation under light over 1000 h, which was published by Han's group.20 The structure of stable perovskite solar cells is 〈glass/FTO/compact-TiO2/porous-TiO2 + perovskite/porous-ZrO2 + perovskite/porous-carbon + perovskite〉, which can be called “fully-printed hole-transporting materials (HTM)-free perovskite solar cells”. The fabrication scheme is illustrated in Fig. 1. Due to the non-vacuum processing without the expensive organic HTM, the processing procedure can be quite facile, resulting in the fabrication of meter-scale modules by students in Han's group.21 The conversion efficiency of the perovskite-solar-cell module was 9%.22 It can be considered that the significant improvement to the light stability without encapsulation20 has been attributed to two points: (CH3NH3)x(HOOC(CH2)4NH3)yPbIz and porous carbon counter electrodes.
 Fig. 1  Fabrication scheme of fully-printed perovskite solar cells using porous carbon counter electrodes with sealing: (a) spray-pyrolysis deposition of the compact (blocking) TiO2 layer; (b) screen printing of TiO2 paste and annealing at 500 °C for deposition of the porous TiO2 layer; (c) screen printing of ZrO2 paste and heating at 200 °C; (d) screen printing of carbon paste and annealing at 400 °C; (e) 2-step (sequential) deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 in the porous electrode. 
Basically, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite can be a 3-dimensional (3-D) crystal. However, the perovskite of (CH3NH3)x(HOOC(CH2)4NH3)yPbIz20 can be a 2-dimensional (2-D) one, which is more stable than a 3-D one.23 Comparing between published XRD results, (CH3NH3)x(HOOC(CH2)4NH3)yPbIz would be a 2-D perovskite.20,23–25 This may be one of the points for the high stability of fully-printed HTM-free perovskite solar cells.
As for carbon counter electrodes, several reports have been published for the stability improvement of perovskite solar cells due to moisture blocking,26 as spiro-OMeTAD.19 However, the carbon counter electrodes by Han's group were porous ones, which have been ambiguous about how to block moisture for the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals.
In this work, in order to understand the high stability of “fully-printed hole-transporting materials (HTM)-free perovskite solar cells” by Han's group, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite has been utilized in porous carbon counter electrodes, without utilization of (CH3NH3)x(HOOC(CH2)4NH3)yPbIz. Light stability tests have been performed with and without encapsulation. The functions of the porous carbon electrodes have been analyzed by XRD and XPS.
Experimental
The fabrication of screen-printing pastes of TiO2, ZrO2 and carbon followed the experimental procedure reported in the literature.27,28 In particular, TiO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles used were from Showa Titanium (3 g, d = 14 nm, F-6) and Alfa Aesar (6 g, d = 40–50 nm, #44886) for the pastes of TiO2 and ZrO2, respectively. For the carbon paste, carbon black powders (1 g, Printex L6, Degussa), graphite (1 g, <20 μm, #282863, Aldrich) and graphite flakes (4 g, 325 mesh, #43209, Alfa Aesar), and ZrO2 powder (0.5 g, d = 40–50 nm, #44886, Alfa Aesar) were placed in a mortar and mixed. Ethyl cellulose solution was prepared beforehand by adding an equivalent amount of two kinds of ethyl cellulose powders in ethanol (5 wt% ethyl cellulose #46080 and 5 wt% ethyl cellulose #86480, Tokyo Chemical Industries, Co. Ltd). To prepare each paste, water (0.5 g mL for TiO2; 1 mL for ZrO2; 10 mL for carbon) and ethanol (20 mL) were added drop-by-drop into the mortar and ground. This solution was transferred from the mortar to a tall beaker with an additional 100 mL of ethanol. Then, the solution was stirred by a magnetic bar for 1 min and by an ultrasonic homogenizer (Vibra cell 72408, Bioblock scientific) for 2 min with intervals of 1 s work and 1 s rest. α-Terpineol (50 g for TiO2, 20 g for ZrO and carbon, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd) was added to the dispersion and stirred by a magnetic bar for 1 min and by an ultrasonic homogenizer for 2 min. Subsequently, the 10 wt% ethyl cellulose solution in ethanol (30 g) was added to the dispersion and stirred by the magnetic bar for 1 min and by the ultrasonic homogenizer for 2 min. Each paste was finalized by the removal of water and ethanol by evaporation at 40 °C at 75 mbar.

Fig. 1 shows the fabrication scheme of the fully-printed HTM-free perovskite solar cells using porous carbon counter electrodes.20,28 For the fabrication of monolithic electrodes, F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (t = 2.1 mm, TEC-15, Nippon Sheet Glass-Pilkington Co. Ltd) were utilized. In order to etch the FTO layer into two parts, Zn powder was poured on the FTO, and hydrochloric acid was poured on the Zn powder. The etched FTO glass plates were washed with glass-cleaning detergent by an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. Then, the substrates were rinsed by water and ethanol. Subsequently, the surface of the substrate was cleaned using a UV-O3 system for 18 min. The dense (blocking) TiO2 layers were coated on the cleaned FTO by spray pyrolysis using a precursor solution of titanium di-isopropoxide bis (acetylacetonate) (TAA; 0.6 mL) in ethanol (9 mL, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan) on a hotplate at 450 °C. The TAA solution was prepared by pouring acetylacetone (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd, Japan) into titanium isopropoxide (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan). The substrate was sintered on hotplates at 500 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the nanoparticle TiO2 (F-6) paste was coated by screen printing to ca. 1 μm thickness and annealed in a ceramic oven at 500 °C for 30 min to give a porous TiO2 layer. When the substrate was cooled, the ZrO2 (#43209) paste was printed to be 4–5 μm on the TiO2 layer to cover the porous TiO2 layer and was dried on a hotplate at 125 °C. Subsequently, the substrate was heated on a hotplate at 200 °C at 1 h. When the substrate was cooled, the carbon paste was printed to be 10–15 μm on the ZrO2 layer. At the same time, the carbon layer was connected to the other FTO layer and sintered at 400 °C (as shown in Fig. 1).
For the deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, a sequential (2-step) method15 was performed with some modification. 1.0 M PbI2 was dissolved in 2 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide by stirring at 70 °C, and deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 film by drop casting at room temperature. In order to introduce the PbI2 solution into the depth of the porous electrode, the air in the pores was evacuated for 30 s in a small vacuum chamber, and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. Then, PbI2 with a porous electrode was dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) for 12 min. Finally, the deposited CH3NH3PbI3 film was dried on a hotplate at 70 °C for 30 min. For the sealing of the device, UV-curing glue (3035B (developed for dye-sensitized solar cells), ThreeBond Holdings Co., Ltd) was set with a glass plate on the perovskite solar cells and cured by a UV light (at 365 nm, NS-ULEDN-102CT, NS-Lighting Co., Ltd) for 20 s to give a glass-plates-sandwiched structure.
The crystal structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (Miniflex II, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation. The CH3NH3PbI3 condition was characterized using two XPS systems (PHI 5000 VersaProbeTM (ULVAC-PHI, Inc.) and a system at the synchrotron of beam line 7b, NewSUBARU, University of Hyogo). Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured for the sample with a light-irradiation area of 4 mm × 4 mm through a shadowing mask by applying an external bias to the cell from the zero bias voltage (forward bias) and measuring the generated photocurrent using a DC voltage current source (B2901A, Agilent) under a solar simulator (1.5 AM, 100 mW cm−2) equipped with a 500 W Xe lamp (YSS-100A, Yamashita Denso). The power of the AM1.5 solar simulator was calibrated using a reference Si photodiode (Bunkou-Keiki Co. Ltd, Japan).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows photographs of the fully-printed HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells using porous carbon counter electrodes with and without sealing under light. The photographs were taken from the light-irradiated glass-substrate side. The sealed cells did not change color during the light irradiation over 300 h. Without sealing, on the other hand, the edge of the cells (ZrO2 part around carbon) changed to yellow until 57 h, due to the conversion of CH3NH3PbI3 to PbI2.12 Some parts of the carbon-covering changed to yellow from the edge, not from the center of the cells. The color changing proceeded during the time course, and the cells changed to yellow completely at 300 h.

The change of the black CH3NH3PbI3-perovskite color to yellow is due to the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 to PbI2 assisted by moisture.9–11 Since the thickness of the carbon layer was ca. 10 μm and the size of the porous carbon counter electrode was 6 mm × 9 mm, the dimension ratio of the porous carbon electrode [=(width)/(thickness)] was 600–900 times. Considering such a blocking effect of crystal conversion from CH3NH3PbI3 to PbI2 at the center of the device, it was apparent that the upper porous-carbon layer can block the introduction of moisture and that H2O was introduced from the edge of the cells, not via the porous carbon layer, due to the large dimension ratio.

Fig. 3 shows the photovoltaic-characteristics variations of the fully-printed HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells under light irradiation with and without sealing. Each data was an average of 5 cells with the error bar. In this case, the initial absolute photovoltaic values (the photocurrent density (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factors (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE)) ranged from 4.63 to 8.06 mA cm−2, 0.802 to 0.891 V, 0.344 to 0.533, and 1.32 to 3.62%, respectively. Although the variations of the initial values were large, the tendencies of degradation of perovskite solar cells were coincident with each other. Hence, in this report, the relative changes were plotted in order to evaluate the stability of the perovskite solar cells. For reference, the photovoltaic data of the sealed cells stored in the dark were also added, which were set under solar-simulating light only for the photovoltaic measurements. The photovoltaic data of the cells stored in the dark were stable during the test, as reported in ref. 3, 13 and 14.
 Fig. 3  Variations of photovoltaic characteristics (Jsc (a and b), Voc (c and d), FF (e and f), and PCE (g and h)) during light exposure (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) in air until 5 h (a, c, e and g) and 370 h (b, c, f and h). 
For the cells without sealing under light, the photocurrent density (Jsc) decreased steadily to 60% from the initial value during the first 5 h (Fig. 3a). But, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) was stable for 5 h (Fig. 3c), and fill factors (FF) increased until 5 h (Fig. 3e). Therefore, the resulting power conversion efficiency (PCE) was stable up to 30 min, but decreased afterward steadily (Fig. 3g). With a 100 h irradiation, Jsc, Voc, and FF changed to 80%, 110% and 90% (Fig. 3b, d and f), respectively, resulting in 80% PCE (Fig. 3h) from each initial value. It was surprising that the cells maintained 80% PCE from the initial value up to 100 h without sealing under AM 1.5 light irradiation (100 mW cm−2), since the solar cells with the structure of 〈TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Au〉 deteriorated in 16 h to almost zero.12 It is apparent that the significant light-stability improvement came from the utilization of porous carbon counter electrodes. However, every photovoltaic parameter decreased afterwards, and then, it reached zero at 370 h, which coincided with the color change of black CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells to yellow (Fig. 2c).
A light stability test with sealed cells by UV-curing glue also has been performed. Although some characteristics of the encapsulated perovskite solar cells (the color, the FF and the Voc) did not change (Fig. 2 and 3c–f), the Jsc and the PCE changed to 40% from the initial value (Fig. 3a, b, g and h) after 220 h irradiation. Afterward, it became stable up to 370 h. The cause of degradation was still ambiguous due to the difficulty of analysis in the packed device. At least, there are two light-degradation schemes: (1) initial drop from 0 to 100 h, which can work in spite of the presence of encapsulation; (2) long-term drop after 100 h, which can be varied with encapsulation. The research to elucidate the issue is ongoing.
To confirm the enhancement effect of the stability by the porous carbon layer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. Fig. 4 shows the XPS patterns of the porous carbon layer with CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite before and after light irradiation for 24 h. XPS can detect elements located at only a few nm depth from the top surface, due to the detection of released electrons which cannot be emitted at deep parts from the substrate. It was reported that the decomposition of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite to PbI2 could be observed by the missing XPS signal of nitrogen in the CH3NH3+ cation.29 However, in spite of the 24 h light irradiation without encapsulation in air, the XPS nitrogen peak of the 〈CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite/porous carbon〉 composite did not change. Therefore, it was quite surprising that PbI2 was not formed at the top surface of the 〈CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite/porous carbon〉 composite by the removal of the CH3NH3+ cation after the 24 h light exposure without encapsulation.
 Fig. 4  XPS patterns of the perovskite/carbon mixed layer: fresh and illuminated for 24 h. 
In order to consider the condition of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal in the porous carbon electrode, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of each combination were compared (Fig. 5). Although an arbitrary unit (a.u.) is utilized, the height of each result did not change. Hence, the height of the peaks can be compared for the discussions. The porous carbon layer can give a single intense peak. The CH3NH3PbI3 crystal by the 1-step procedure can provide an XRD pattern of typical perovskite. Contrarily, the 2-step procedure for the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal added a peak of the PbI2 crystal in the typical CH3NH3PbI3 patterns. The PbI2 peak was lower than the CH3NH3PbI3(110) peak by the 2-step deposition. Using the porous carbon layer, however, the XRD pattern of CH3NH3PbI3 can change drastically, which cannot be due to the simple addition of the XRD patterns of carbon, PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Many CH3NH3PbI3 peaks became prominent in the porous carbon layer. This enhancement may be due to the growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal along the carbon wall in the porous carbon layer. The larger peak of PbI2 than that of CH3NH3PbI3 in the porous carbon layer suggests that the 2-step deposition method for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite can remain as the majority of the PbI2 precursor in the porous carbon layer. Therefore, this phenomenon of crystal enhancement may be attributed to the strong interactions between carbon, PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.
 Fig. 5  XRD pattern of the carbon layer, 1-step CH3NH3PbI3 by spin coating, 2-step CH3NH3PbI3 by spin coating, and 2-step CH3NH3PbI3 by drop casting in the porous carbon layer. The intensity height of each data was not changed for the comparison. 

Fig. 6 shows normalized XPS patterns of “perovskite”, “carbon” and “perovskite + carbon”. XPS can show the chemical information on the elements. PbI2 was deposited beforehand in the porous carbon layer by the 2-step deposition method to give CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Hence, PbI2 can be attached on the carbon directly and can remain on the surface in the carbon pores, which can be observed by XRD (Fig. 5). The center of the carbon pores should be CH3NH3PbI3 due to the 2-step deposition procedure (as shown in Fig. 7). In spite of the presence of the porous carbon layer, the XPS N 1s patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 did not change (Fig. 6a). Hence, the carbon did not give a strong interaction on nitrogen, because CH3NH3+ and the porous carbon did not touch each other directly, due to the remaining PbI2 on the carbon surface by the 2-step deposition method. The XPS C 1s pattern of “perovskite + carbon” was just an addition of the C 1s patterns of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and carbon (Fig. 6b). However, the XPS Pb 4f and I 3d patterns became broader with the porous carbon layer (Fig. 6c and d). Therefore, lead and iodide were influenced by the porous carbon layer, but nitrogen did not have such an influence due to the structure.

In conclusion, Fig. 7 shows the summarized image of the enhancement stability and the degradation mechanism of fully-printed HTM-free CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells using porous carbon counter electrodes. Although perovskite solar cells with the Au counter electrode 〈TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Au〉 without sealing degraded to almost zero efficiency in 16 h under light irradiation,12 those with the porous carbon electrode 〈mp-TiO2 + CH3NH3PbI3/mp-ZrO2 + CH3NH3PbI3/mp-C + CH3NH3PbI3〉 without sealing survived for over 100 h with 80% of the initial efficiency. Since Au did not enhance the durability of the perovskite solar cells, the Au layer may have some pinholes for water molecules to penetrate the Au layer. XPS and XRD show strong contact between CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and porous carbon, resulting in high stability against light with moisture. If it is possible, the measurement of the moisture permeability across the porous carbon layer (with and without perovskite inside) would be quite helpful, which is an interesting topic for future research. It can be considered that the weak contact strength between TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI330,31 may deteriorate the solar cells, due to the introduction of moisture through the gap between TiO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 (as shown in Fig. 7). In order to block H2O penetration from the side of the cells, an amino acid (such as 5-AVA,20 GAVA,32 and so on) would be necessary to enhance the interaction between TiO2 and organo halide lead perovskite.
