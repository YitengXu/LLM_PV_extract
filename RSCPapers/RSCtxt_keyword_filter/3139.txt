    , Accepted 26th October 2016First published on 26th October 2016AbstractIn this study we systematically explored the mixed cation perovskite Csx(CH3NH3)1−xPbI3. We exchanged the A-site cation by dipping MAPbI3 films into a CsI solution, thereby incrementally replacing the MA+ in a time-resolved dipping process and analysed the resulting thin-films with UV-Vis, XRD, EDAX, SEM and optical depth-analysis in a high-throughput fashion. Additional in situ UV-Vis and time-resolved XRD measurements allowed us to look at the kinetics of the formation process. The results showed a discontinuity during the conversion. Firstly, small amounts of Cs+ are incorporated into the structure. After a few minutes, the Cs content approaches a limit and grains of δ-CsPbI3 occur, indicating a substitution limit. We compared this cation exchange to a one-step crystallisation approach and found the same effect of phase segregation, which shows that the substitution limit is an intrinsic feature rather than a kinetic effect. Optical and structural properties changed continuously for small Cs incorporations. Larger amounts of Cs result in phase segregation. We estimate the substitution limit of CsxMA1−xPbI3 to start at a Cs ratio x = 0.13, based on combined measurements of EDAX, UV-Vis and XRD. The photovoltaic performance of the mixed cation perovskite shows a large increase in device stability from days to weeks. The initial efficiency of mixed CsxMA1−xPbI3 devices decreases slightly, which is compensated by stability after a few days.
The recent surge in the field of ABX3-type hybrid inorganic–organic perovskite solar cells has led to a rise of efficiencies from 3.8% in 2009 to currently 22.1%.1–10 Numerous adjustments were made to the initial structure MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium CH3NH3+) in order to obtain a more stable, non-toxic and efficient solar cell material.11–15 Current record-cells usually employ a mixture of different cations and halides, as in FAxMA1−xPbBryI3−y (FA = formamidinium (CH3)2NH+).16–18 In fact, the plain MAPbI3 has up to now failed to reach efficiencies exceeding 20%, a benchmark that its derivatives reached in 2014.10 This shows the importance of a judicial exploration of structural derivatives and a thorough analysis of their properties.
Halide derivatives of the plain MAPbX3 span a broad compositional range (I, Br and Cl) and allow for a continuous adjustment of the bandgap from around 1.56 eV to 3.06 eV, as smaller halides are introduced into the structure.11,19–21 This adjustment brings about an increasing stability towards high ambient humidity but also moves the bandgap into an unfavourable high energy region, that reduces the light harvesting range of the solar cell.11 Furthermore the use of mixed halides is put into question because many Br–I compositions segregate upon light exposure,22 possibly caused by thermodynamic instability of the solid solution.23
On the other hand, A-site cation derivatives of ABX3 perovskites show various enhancements. The FAPbI3 perovskite has a more favourable red-shifted bandgap and is less prone to thermal degradation compared to its MA equivalent.24 However, its photoactive α-phase is only stable at elevated temperature and it tends to transform into the inactive δ-phase at room temperature. More recently, the inorganic caesium lead halide perovskite CsPbI3 has drawn a lot of attention.12,25–32 This material shows great potential, considering that a main reason for the decomposition of perovskites is the high volatility of the organic MA+ cation.33 Cs salts are less volatile than their organic counterparts, which renders the material stable at high temperatures and can yield perovskite solar cells with an impressive thermal stability.34,35 However, CsPbI3 also suffers from poor structural stability of its α-phase, and tends to transform into the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase at room temperature.25 Several attempts have been made to stabilise the α-CsPbI3 with different additives.18,26,32 The only long-term conservation of the dark phase at room temperature was done by co-depositing colloidal nanocrystals, that were sintered to obtain a supersaturation of Cl− dopant.36
Clearly, the options for plain ternary perovskites are limited and even more so within the range of properties that are desirable for photovoltaic applications. Therefore it seems important to further investigate mixed perovskite materials.
A substitution of the halide in the CsPbX3 perovskite can be done for the halide series X = I, Br, Cl, just as in their MA derivatives.27,28 Besides continuous tunability in colour, CsPbX3 materials are viable candidates for applications in tandem cells and exhibit an improved thermal stability.29,30 But just as for MAPbX3 compounds, usage of smaller halide derivatives shifts the bandgap into an unfavourable spectral region. Solid solutions of CsxFA1−xPbX3 have been shown to maintain a desirable absorption onset and stabilise the photoactive α-phase due to a gain in mixing entropy.18 This improves their resistance against photo- and moisture-induced degradation.12,31,32 On the other hand, mixtures of Cs+ with the MA cation as in CsxMA1−xPbX3 seem to be under-explored with only one report by Choi et al., which shows an improved efficiency from 5.5 to 7.7% for a Cs-doping concentration of 10 mol%.37 Interestingly, the more complicated ternary cation mixture Csx(FA0.87MA0.13)1−xPbBr0.17I0.87 was recently investigated by Saliba et al. and cells reached efficiencies of >20% with an impressive improvement of stability under operating conditions.38 In this study we want to shed more light onto the less explored CsxMA1−xPbX3 system by refining the material's compositional space and demonstrating its benefits for photovoltaic applications.17 Therefore, we analysed large-area substrates (7.1 × 7.1 cm2) to facilitate the dipping process and reduces edge effects (e.g. capillary forces) during the cation conversion process. The large conversion area allows for a statistical treatment of the photovoltaic properties, with 169 cells on one substrate (13 × 13 anodic contacts), with otherwise identical processing conditions, therefore creating a continuous compositional spread. We have produced multiple batches to ensure batch-to-batch reproducibility.
1 Experimental
1.1 Substrate preparation
FTO on glass substrates of the size 7.1 × 7.1 cm2 were cleaned by rinsing with a soap solution (2 vol% Hellmanex III in water), deionised water, ethanol and then etched in an argon plasma. A 100 nm layer of TiO2 was coated on top via spray pyrolysis. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited from a 1:10 diluted titania paste (18NR-T, Dyesol) in ethanol via spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, resulting in a 250 nm thick layer.
1.2 Cation exchange
A solution of 460 mg mL−1 PbI2 and 23 mg mL−1 PbCl2 in DMSO was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. Dipping the lead halide film into a solution of methylammonium iodide (MAI) in 2-propanol (IPA) (32 mg mL−1) for 2 min converted the film into the MAPbI3 perovskite. The films were then washed in an IPA bath and annealed with MAI vapor at 140 °C for 60 min according to our previous report.39 To sublime the excess MAI, we then annealed the cells for another 60 min on the hotplate. The Cs+ cation exchange was done in analogy to recent reports.40,41 A supersaturated solution of CsI in IPA was prepared by heating a saturated mixture with excess salt and sonicating it for 60 min. The solution was heated to 80 °C for 30 min and cooled down to 30 °C just before using it. The substrate was dipped into the supersaturated solution with a home-made dip coater. The substrate was partially lifted out of the CsI solution at conversion times of 1, 3, 10, 25 and 40 min in order to get different conversion stages. The film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Thin-film substrates were directly used for elemental analysis. For solar cell fabrication spiro-MeOTAD (72 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was used as a hole transport contact, doped with 34 μL Li-bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (540 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 58 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (80 mM) and spin coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The cells were kept in a dry atmosphere overnight to oxygen-dope the spiro-MeOTAD layer. Finally, an array of 13 × 13 separate silver back contacts (100 nm thickness) were thermally evaporated, thus forming 169 individual solar cells per substrate; an example of a so called library can be found in the ESI (see Fig. E1†). For the anodic contact the perovskite was scratched off the edges of the substrate and the contact was strengthened with sonication soldering. The solar cell fabrication procedure is identical to our previous report, except for the cation exchange.39 Full statistics on cell performance can be found in the ESI (see Fig. E2†) including a comparison to another batch in order to address reproducibility of the results. For the stability testing the cells were stored in clean dry air (about 0.6% humidity) in darkness at room temperature.
1.3 One-step deposition
Equimolar precursor solutions of MAI with PbI2 and CsI with PbI2 were dissolved in DMSO with a concentration of 1 mol L−1, by stirring at 60 °C over 6 h. The mixed cation solutions were prepared by mixing the CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 precursor solutions with the respective ratios x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.75. Solutions were spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.
1.4 Analysis
An overview of measurements performed thin-films and solar cells is given in the ESI (see Fig. E3†). IV performance was measured with a home-build and automated scanner, using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and an active area of 0.026 cm2 of each of the 169 cells, as defined by the size of the metal back contact and the shadow mask. Measurements were performed in forward and backward direction; details about the measurement system can be found in our recent study.42In situ absorption measurements were recorded on thin-films in a cuvette with a CARY UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Thin-film absorbance was measured on a home-build optical scanner, measuring total transmission, total reflection, and specular reflection with millimeter spatial resolution in a high-throughput fashion. A line scan was measured, including 11 points along the dipping axis, therefore measuring more datasets than conversion stages. Details of the optical scanning system can be found elsewhere.43 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bragg Brentano geometry X-ray diffractometer (CuKα1 with λ = 1.5406 Å and CuKα2 with λ = 1.5443 Å; intensity ratio of 2). All diffractograms were corrected against FTO as an internal standard. Baseline removal was performed with fityk 0.9.8.44 For the time-resolved XRD measurements, the cation exchange setup was placed inside the diffractometer and measurements were taken at different stages of the conversion process. The native MAPbI3 sample was loaded and 1 mL of CsI in IPA solution were placed on top. At a set of conversion times (0, 3, 8, 18, 28 and 38 min) the solution was removed and the sample blow-dried in order to measure a diffractogram, after which fresh solution was applied again. SEM images were measured with a field-emission, FEI, Helios 600 high resolution scanning electron microscope. The energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) was done on a 80 mm2 X-max, Oxford Instruments, scanning the entire substrate in analogy to the optical scanning system mentioned above.
2 Results and discussion
The first step for the MAPbI3 A-site cation exchange with Cs+ was to find a solvent that dissolved the CsI salt without decomposing the MAPbI3 perovskite. We screened several solvents that do not dissolve the MAPbI3 (so called anti-solvents). Solvents that were tested include toluene, chlorobenzene, acetonitrile, IPA and mixture of IPA/methanol, but none of them solubilised the CsI to levels close to the commonly used concentrations for cation exchanges (e.g. around 10 mg mL−1 or 63 mmol L−1 for MAI).5 Therefore, the sample was dipped into a supersaturated solution of CsI in IPA (that has a low solubility of CsI) for the conversion. We would like to specify that in this study we used a mixed halide precursor solution of PbI2 and PbCl2. However, we are using the nomenclature MAPbI3 and CsxMA1−xPbI3 to refer to all species made from iodide–chloride mixed halide precursors, for the sake of simplicity. Nevertheless, the Cl does play a critical role during film formation,45–48 and has recently been shown to stabilise the photoactive α-phase of the Cs-perovskite.36 The organic cation exchange was done by dipping the MAPbI3 films into a CsI solution in discreet steps at conversion times of 1, 3, 10, 25 and 40 min, resulting in a partially converted thin-film. The thin-film were characterised using UV-Vis, XRD, EDAX, SEM and optical depth-analysis techniques. We applied line scans or mappings of the whole substrate (details in the Experimental section) in a high-throughput fashion. The perovskite film showed a constant uptake of Cs cations with increasing dipping time. This can be seen from the EDAX line scan that increases up to a Cs ratio of x = 0.5 for 40 min dipping time (see Fig. 1). However, this steady uptake of Cs+ into the structure is opposed by a discontinuity of both structural and optical properties.

(c) An EDAX line scan shows a continuous increase of the Cs-ratio and correlates the drop of absorbance to a Cs ratio x = 0.13, indicating the formation of δ-CsPbI3.

(e) Time-resolved XRD of Cs+ incorporation into MAPbI3 shows two steps. First the (110) reflection shifts (inset), indicating incorporation of Cs+. In the second step pure δ-CsPbI3 builds up at the expense of CsxMA1−xPbI3. 
The UV-Vis analysis showed an initial blue-shift of the absorption edge (see Fig. 1d), caused by an increasing Cs ratio. The same trend was reported for the same material by Choi et al.37 and also for a mixed cation systems with FA.18,38 Longer conversion times (>3 min) resulted in a visible change of colour from dark brown of the MAPbI3 to a bright yellow that can be attributed to either PbI2 or the δ-phase of CsPbI3. Accordingly, the UV-Vis spectrum showed a decrease of the MAPbI3 absorption together with an intensifying absorption around 440 nm. This wavelength corresponds to the signature absorption of δ-CsPbI3 and indicates a discontinuity of the material, which is indicative of a substitution limit. The terminology substitution limit in this context can interchangeably used with miscibility gap. It refers to an intrinsic feature of the material, as we will show later on. PbI2 should show an absorption onset around 510 nm. A more detailed look shows a shifting absorption onset for initial dipping times (≤3 min) of MAPbI3. This indicates incremental changes, namely small inclusions of Cs before the substitution limit. Throughout this work we labelled the incremental conversion of MAPbI3 into the solid solution CsxMA1−xPbI3 as step I, while the transformation of CsxMA1−xPbI3 into the CsPbI3 caused by the substitution limit is labelled as step II. In order to quantify the beginning of the substitution limit (transition from step I to step II), we plotted the absorbance at 450 nm, as a region that is strongly absorbed by the MAPbI3 and below the bandgap of δ-CsPbI3. The absorbance shows a drop after about 3 min conversion, which correlates to a Cs ratio x = 0.13, as measured via EDAX.
Time-resolved analysis of the native MAPbI3 conversion was measured with XRD, as opposed to the spatially resolved analysis of the dipped films in the last section. Two distinctive regions can be seen in the measurement, which correspond to the Cs- and MA-perovskites. An excerpt that shows characteristic peaks of both perovskite domains is shown in Fig. 1e, while the full diffractograms before and after conversion are shown in the ESI (Fig. E4†). During the course of the conversion we observed a decreasing peak intensity of the MA-containing perovskite alongside an increasing intensity of the δ-phase CsPbI3, indicating a substitution limit (step II) in the same fashion as discussed for the UV-Vis spectra above. Another important feature in the X-ray diffractogram is a shift of the MA-perovskite signal towards larger angles, indicating a decrease of the unit cell size. This is an effect of adding small amounts of Cs+ into the perovskite structure, as mentioned before for the step I formation of CsxMA1−xPbI3. The same trend is observed for Cs+ incorporations into FAPbI3 perovskites.49 It shows that the material, despite having a substitution limit, allows for small incorporations of Cs cations. The (110) reflection shifts from 14.137° (at 0 min) to 14.180° (at 28 min), which corresponds to d-spacing values of 6.2598 Å and 6.2409 Å, respectively (assuming λ = 1.5406 Å). This corresponds to a decrease in d-spacing of 1.89 pm. The reduction in d-spacing is following the reduction in unit cell volume, caused by the fact that Cs+ is smaller than MA+. Direction and magnitude of the structural change lines up with our expectations. Tabulated values of ionic radii and changes of structural parameters can be found in the ESI (Table E3†). A more detailed quantitative discussion of this finding will be given later in this text. A blank measurement with IPA and without CsI salt has also been run, which showed a constant peak position. An out of plane movement of the focal plane caused by a layer-by-layer conversion can be excluded because the resulting shift would be beyond the detection limit.
The only comparable study on the system CsxMA1−xPbI3 was done by Choi et al. in 2014, for the full compositional range of CsxMA1−xPbI3 of one-step deposited perovskites.37 In contrast to this work, that study does not consider any phase segregation or substitution limit. Therefore, we conducted analogous measurements on one-step deposited films of the mixed perovskite CsxMA1−xPbI3 in order to address this discrepancy and to ascertain that the substitution limit is an intrinsic thermodynamic feature, rather than a kinetic product. The one-step deposited films all crystallised in their dark phase first, then the pure CsPbI3 changed its colour to yellow after a few seconds on the hotplate, indicating the transition of the α-phase into the δ-phase.26 Perovskites with Cs-contents of 75% and 50% endured several hours and days, respectively, before changing their colour to yellow. This indicates that MA+ cations can stabilise the α-phase for a limited time, as has been reported for several other additives before.18,26,36 UV-Vis analysis of the CsPbI3 shows the distinct absorption onset around 450 nm, which remains conspicuous for decreasing Cs ratios down to x ≥ 0.25. The absorption onset does not show any apparent change in wavelength (see Fig. 2a). On the other hand, the bandgap of MA-rich CsxMA1−xPbI3 compounds blue-shifts continuously, from around 780 nm (1.59 eV) for MAPbI3 to about 770 nm (1.61 eV), as shown in the Tauc plot (see Fig. 2a, inset). Materials with a high Cs content also show an absorption onset around 510 nm, presumably relating to PbI2 as a decomposition product during phase segregation. Analysis with XRD illustrates how the (110) reflection of the MAPbI3 phase decreases in intensity and shifts towards larger angles as a result of Cs-inclusion. We fitted the (110) reflection, assuming a pseudo-cubic structure. The fitted peak position is linear for Cs-ratios x ≥ 0.15 with a slope of 0.4012° (see Fig. 2b and c), which is used later to determine the Cs ratio after various dipping times. We would like to point out that this is beyond the estimated miscibility limit reported in this study (see Table 1) and can be attributed to a kinetic effect, similar to the spinodal segregation reported for mixed halide perovskites.23
 Fig. 2  (a) One-step deposited mixtures CsxMA1−xPbI3 show build up of the absorption onset of δ-CsPbI3 for high Cs ratios x as well as a shifting bandgap for small Cs incorporations, that can also be seen in the Tauc plot (inset). (b) X-ray diffractogram shows pure MAPbI3 and CsPbI3 at the top and bottom with their respective solid solutions in between. (c) The fitted (110) reflection shifts continuously for Cs ratios 0 ≥ x ≥ 0.15. (d) A close up of the MAPbI3 (110) reflection. The Intensity of x = 0 is reduced for the sake of clarity.

A peculiarity is the diffraction peak at 20°, which soars for Cs ratios x = 0.4–0.5, presumably relating to the (110) reflection of the cubic α-CsPbI3 structure. This suggests a stabilisation of the α-phase, which has been demonstrated before for different additives.18,26,36 However, all significant peaks of that phase, coincide with the tetragonal MAPbI3 diffraction pattern, which facilitates a definite conclusion. For Cs ratios x ≥ 0.25 we can see characteristic peaks of the δ-CsPbI3 alongside the mixed phase CsxMA1−xPbI3. Interestingly the peak positions of the δ-CsPbI3 from Cs-rich mixed cation precursors (x ≥ 0.25) are slightly shifted with respect to its pure phase, which could indicate a small solubility of MA+ in the δ-CsPbI3. In conclusion, both synthesis routes, the one-step crystallisation and two-step conversion show continuous structural and optical changes for small inclusion of Cs and a segregation of δ-CsPbI3 alongside CsxMA1−xPbI3 for larger Cs ratios. This indicates that the substitution limit is an intrinsic feature rather than a kinetic effect during the cation exchange. A similar effect of spinodal decomposition has recently been shown for halide mixtures MAPbBrxI1−x, caused by a substitution limit.23
In order to investigate the depth-profile of the conversion process we exfoliated the thin-films with adhesive tape over 15 cycles. Profilometer measurements showed that the exfoliation removed a layer with a total thickness of 60–70 nm after 15 cycles, indicating a partial removal of the capping layer. We measured the optical absorption after each exfoliation for 15 cycles. The full absorption spectra show a decrease in absorption with each exfoliation cycle and can be found in the ESI.† Most interesting are small changes around the bandgap region, which are sensitive to changes in the material, such as the bandgap shift with increasing Cs ratio shown earlier (see Fig. 1d). Therefore, we subtracted the spectrum of the initial spectrum from the exfoliated sample for different time regimes of the dipping (AbsexfolAbsinitial). We can see two types of features in the subtracted spectra: (1) plateau-like regions which are caused by changes in absorbance because we take away material and (2) peaks that are caused by a shifted absorption onset between native and exfoliated thin-film. We corrected the baseline in order to have a direct comparison of the latter. The resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 3. Full absorption spectra and differential spectra with baseline can be found in ESI Fig. E5.† Intuitively, we would expect a faster conversion on the interface between thin-film and solution, because of the direct exposure to the solution and a potentially faster mass transport of Cs+. This would red-shift the absorption onset of MAPbI3 in the converted interface layer and therefore result in a positive peak of the differential spectrum after exfoliation. However, the experiment reveals the opposite effect. A negative peak in the bandgap regime of MAPbI3 (760 nm) demonstrates a Cs-enrichment in the underlying layer. This effect can be seen only for short dipping times < 10 min, which indicates a faster cation exchange in the mesoscopic region. We assume that the increased surface of the underlying mesoscopic layer is responsible for a faster Cs+ uptake. This negative peak also shows a blue-shift which affirms the continuous formation of a solid solution CsxMA1−xPbI3 for small x. Spectra of films formed at longer dipping times ≥ 10 min do not exhibit this peak any more, which indicates Cs-saturation of the CsxMA1−xPbI3 phase. Instead, two peaks appear at around 510 nm and 440 nm, that are allocated to PbI2 and δ-CsPbI3, respectively. Vice versa, their positive signature indicates an enrichment of those species in the mesoscopic layer that is left after exfoliation. The position of the CsPbI3 peak does not shift, which is an indication for the formation of a pure phase without MA inclusions. On the other hand, the PbI2 phase does show a blue-shift for increasing dipping times, which can be explained by intercalation dynamics, that occur during the conversion from the 3D perovskite to a 2D PbI2 structure.50,51 We further would like to add that the presence of PbI2 in the optical measurements stems from the sensitivity of the measurement, opposed to our XRD measurements which show only the perovskite structures CsxMA1−xPbI3 and CsPbI3. SEM images before and after exfoliation can be found in the ESI (Fig. E6†).
 Fig. 3  Optical analysis via exfoliation of the capping layer shows a preferential formation of Cs+ rich domains in lower sections. The spectra of the difference in absorbance (AbsinitialAbsexfol, baseline removed) shows peaks in the range of the bandgaps of CsxMA1−xPbI3, PbI2 and CsPbI3. Negative magnitude of the CsxMA1−xPbI3 peak indicates a higher MA content in the capping layer for short dipping times (t < 10 min). Positive peaks for PbI2 and CsPbI3 indicate and enrichment in the lower mesoporous layer (t ≥ 10 min). 
To quantify the stable region of the mixed phase CsxMA1−xPbI3 we associated the previously described measurements to estimate a limit for the substitution limit in three different ways. Using a Tauc plot, we extracted an absorption onset of 1.618 eV for CsxMA1−xPbI3 after the cation exchange. We related this value to the pure phases of MAPbI3 and α-CsPbI3 in order to conclude the Cs ratio, assuming a linear bandgap shift for small dopant concentrations. For MAPbI3 we measured a bandgap of 1.598 eV (see Fig. 1d) and for α-CsPbI3 we used a value of 1.73 eV (taken from Stoumpos et al.).25 This correlates to a Cs ratio of xTauc = 0.14 ± 0.08. Details about the estimation and an error calculation can be found in the ESI.† The previously discussed thin-film analysis gives an estimate composition of xEDAX = 0.13 ± 0.04 as the elemental composition before the absorbance of CsxMA1−xPbI3 starts to drop as a result of the substitution limit step II conversion (see Fig. 1b). Finally, we estimated the composition from the shifting XRD signal of the time-resolved analysis of the conversion, by comparing the obtained shift with one-step deposited films with a known Cs ratio. As mentioned earlier, we assumed a pseudo-cubic peak profile and fitted the peak shift against the Cs ratio of the thin-film. The resulting linear slope (see Fig. 2c) was related to the obtained shift during cation exchange (0.048° after 28 min) and gave an estimated Cs ratio of x = 12 ± 0.03. Averaging those three methods, we assess the stable regime of CsxMA1−xPbI3 to be between 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.13, as the average of our three methods, and a broad substitution limit for x > 0.13. It is worthwhile mentioning that there are contradicting reports about the mixing Cs+ with FAPbI3 perovskite, with some reports stating continuous miscibility,18 while others report on segregation for Cs ratios x ≥ 10%.12 The formation dynamics of perovskites can be, at least empirically, very well described by the thermochemical radii of the respective elements. The mathematical description of this correlation is given with the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t and octahedral factor μ.52,53 One might argue that the size difference between the Cs cation and MA is too large with 1.81 Å and 2.17 Å as cation radii, respectively.54 However, the FA cation is even larger with 2.53 Å and has been reported to improve stability and reproducibility as a ternary cation perovskite Csx(FA0.17MA0.83)1−xPbX3.38 This points towards bonding effects that go beyond the radii of the respective ABX3 ions and shows the temperamental nature of this class of perovskite. Possible contributions are manifold and could include factors such as mixing entropy, cation shape and polarisation as well as chemical effects like hydrogen bonding, ion movements, spin–orbit coupling or orbital hybridisation.55–58
A Cs-MA cation exchange for perovskite solar cells is useful to overcome the intrinsic instability of the MAPbI3 perovskite,59 which remains a major obstacle towards its commercialisation. We measured decomposition rates of the CsxMA1−xPbI3 solid solution in comparison to the plain MAPbI3 perovskite. Therefore, the respective thin-films were dipped into an IPA solution with different water concentrations between 0 and 5 vol% and in situ UV-Vis transmission was measured. Upon decomposition, the transmission spectra show a drop in the absorbance due to the conversion of the MAPbI3 and an increasing baseline caused by the roughness of the formed PbI2, resulting in an increase in light scattering. Two explanatory spectra are shown in Fig. 4a and b, a listing of all spectra is given in ESI Fig. E7.† We labelled a film as decomposed when the transmission at 450 nm drops below 80% of its initial value. Fig. 4c summarises the time before the films started to degrade. The plain MAPbI3 degraded relatively quickly, within 30 min in anhydrous IPA. As we increased the water concentration in IPA the films decomposed quicker, within 5 min in a solution of 5 vol% water in IPA. The CsxMA1−xPbI3 solid solution showed a significant increase in stability. For water concentrations ≥ 2 vol% the films remained intact for about twice as long. An even better performance was found for water concentrations ≤ 1 vol%, where the films remained stable over the duration of the measurement (10 h) and also did not show any visible decomposition after being kept another 7 days in the same solution. We would like to point out that for the CsxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite the broad spectral absorption remains intact, as opposed to changes in the halide composition that come along with a blue-shifting bandgap.11

MAPbI3 decomposes in less than 30 min for any water concentration, while the CsxMA1−xPbI3 was stable in water concentrations cH2O ≤ 10 wt% throughout the whole measurement (10 hours). (a and b) Shows an example of a decomposition of MAPbI3 in anhydrous IPA, while CsxMA1−xPbI3 remains stable throughout the whole measurement (10 h). (c) Shows a summary of all measured compositions. 
Finally we wanted to investigate the photovoltaic properties of this compound. Our MAPbI3 reference cell showed an average power conversion efficiency PCE of 12.1 ± 1.4% with the best cell achieving 14.2%. The cells had an average photovoltage VOC = 1.01 V, photocurrent ISC = 19.2 mA and fill factor FF = 62.0%. The Cs-containing samples were produced with a cation exchange for 1 min, that resulted in a Cs concentration within the stable region 0 < x < 0.13. A precise estimation of the composition can not be done due to the propagation error of Δx = 0.04 (see Table 1 and ESI† for calculations). The cells showed a slight increase in VOC for all dipping times (see ESI Fig. E2†), which is in agreement with a small blue-shift of the bandgap. The ISC showed a linear drop with dipping time, which is probably caused by the decrease in absorption as the proportion of the yellow δ-CsPbI3 increased (see Fig. 1a). The PCE also drops with increasing dipping time but the decrease in photocurrent is partially compensated by a higher FF for long dipping times. An overview of all PCE values is given in Fig. 5. A full listing of photovoltaic parameters (VOC, ISC, FF and PCE) including distribution histograms is given in the ESI (Fig. E2†). We also evaluated the cell stability over a period of 31 days; during this time the cells were stored in a dark and dry environment (2% humidity) and taken out only for IV testing. Here we saw a trade-off when increasing the Cs-content: a decrease of photocurrent ISC is countered by a markedly improved stability. Dipping the sample for 1 min decreases the average efficiency from 12.1 to 10.3% which decays to 6.48% after 31 days. Dipping for 3 min gives an initial efficiency of 6.73% that changes to 4.56% after 31 days. In comparison, the native MAPbI3 sample decreased in PCE from 12.1% to 2.81% within only a week and went dead after 31 days. A comparison of the decomposition for the best performing native sample and the best performing Cs+ dipped sample can be found in Fig. 5c–e. This shows that even short Cs conversion times have an appreciable impact on stability. Even though the initial PCE is lower for Cs+ treated samples, this is been compensated by an increased stability after about 3 days, when the efficiency of the native sample drops below the mixed cation perovskite CsxMA1−xPbI3.

3 Conclusions
In summary, our study has investigated the incorporation of Cs+ into the MAPbI3 perovskite structure. Dipping the thin-film into a solution of CsI resulted in a continuous uptake of Cs+ over time. We found that an increasing Cs ratio results in a conversion into the δ-CsPbI3, leaving a substitution limit. We compared this cation exchange to a one-step crystallisation procedure for different stoichiometric mixtures CsxMA1−xPbI3 and found an analogous and continuous change of optical and structural properties for small Cs incorporations and a phase segregation for larger Cs contents. We estimate the substitution limit of CsxMA1−xPbI3 to start at a Cs ratio x = 0.13, based on combined measurements of EDAX, UV-Vis and XRD. We believe that these results have important implications for the fabrication of mixed cation perovskites, that are commonly employed in record cells. Furthermore, we looked at stability improvement of the CsxMA1−xPbI3 material itself and in solar cells. Thin-films exposed to a mixture of water/IPA increased their stability from minutes to days. Solar cells showed an improvement in cell lifetime from days to a month, even for small incorporations of Cs+. This study refines the compositional space and gives further manifestation to the temperamental nature of this class of perovskite with implications reaching from material design to solar cell fabrication.
