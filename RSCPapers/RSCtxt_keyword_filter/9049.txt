    , Accepted 14th March 2019First published on 15th March 2019AbstractMolecular level one-dimensional (1D) metal halide perovskites possessing large exciton binding energies are generally considered unfavorable for photovoltaic devices. To date, applying 1D perovskites as active materials for solar cells has not been as well explored as 3D and 2D perovskites. Herein, we report a new low-dimensional hybrid perovskite based on 1D 1,4-benzene diammonium lead iodide (BDAPbI4) perovskite. Counterintuitive to the general belief, a high efficiency of up to 14% was achieved for solar cells based on low-dimensional hybrid perovskites containing 1D BDAPbI4 and 3D MAPbI3. More importantly, these solar cells can retain over 95% of their efficiency upon storage for over 1000 h and show impressive stability under continuous illumination and heating.
1. Introduction
Breakthroughs of three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites in the field of photovoltaics have prompted a renaissance of interest in molecular level low-dimensional perovskites, including two-dimensional (2D), one-dimensional (1D), and zero-dimensional (0D) materials.1–8 Molecular level 2D, 1D and 0D perovskites are bulk assemblies of perovskite quantum-wells, quantum-wires, and molecular species or clusters, respectively, in which metal halide anions are separated by large organic cations.9–18 Until now, 1D perovskites have been significantly underexplored compared to the remarkable progress realized in 3D and 2D perovskites.19,20 The first paper about 1D perovskites was reported in 1995 by Mitzi et al.21,22 Since then, there have been only a handful of reports on 1D perovskite materials.23–34 In 2017, Ma et al. renewed the research interest in 1D perovskites with highly efficient white-light emission.35
So far, only a few organic cations have been shown to form 1D perovskite structures.11,21,23,28–36 Most studies point out that 1D perovskites have relatively large exciton binding energies compared to 3D perovskites due to strong quantum confinement and site isolation. Intuitively, 1D perovskites should have good potential for applications involving radiative hole–electron recombination (i.e. light emission) due to their low exciton dissociation efficiency.35 To date, studies on 1D perovskites mainly focus on light-emitting applications and their applications in solar cells have rarely been studied.
As 1D perovskite phases are isolated by large organic cations in two dimensions, they theoretically can have better stability than their 2D and 3D counterparts. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one report in which a small amount of 1D perovskite is added for enhancing the stability of 3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs),36 and the feasibility of using 1D phases as active photovoltaic materials is yet to be demonstrated. Here, a 1D organic lead iodide perovskite 1,4-benzene diammonium lead iodide (BDAPbI4) with edge-sharing lead iodide chains surrounded by 1,4-benzene diammonium (BDA) cations is proved by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). Perovskite thin films containing 1D BADPbI4 and 3D MAPbI3 (BDAPbI4·n − 1MAPbI3 with n = 2 to 4, referred to as N2, N3, N4 samples) were prepared and used as active layers for efficient PSCs. These samples show limited quantum confinement, long carrier lifetime and fast carrier mobilities, resulting in PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 14.1%. More importantly, PSCs based on these low-dimensional hybrid perovskites exhibited great stability. These results suggest that the applications of 1D perovskites are not limited to light emission, and they, in fact, can be excellent photovoltaic materials.
2. Results and discussion
Single crystals of BDAPbI4 perovskite needles as long as one centimeter were prepared (see details in the Methods section). The crystal structure of the BDAPbI4 perovskite needle was determined using single crystal XRD (CCDC: 632922). The 1D BDAPbI4 crystal (Fig. 1a) has an orthorhombic symmetry with the Pnnm space group.27 An asymmetric unit (Fig. 1b) consists of one BDA cation, four different iodine anions, and two crystallographically distinct half lead ions. Both lead ions are six-coordinated in an octahedral geometry and every octahedron is connected by two neighboring ones via four iodine anions by edge-sharing, forming a 1D lead iodide wire (Fig. 1c). This edge-sharing 1D lead iodide wire is different from typical corner-sharing PbI6 units found in 2D and 3D metal halide perovskites.16,18,37 These lead iodide wires are further connected by ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the BDA cations and iodide anions,38 leading to the formation of a 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite structure.

A BDAPbI4 perovskite thin film sample was prepared and characterized with XRD (Fig. S1†), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies (Fig. 1d and e). An XRD pattern of the 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite thin film is shown in Fig. S1.† The XRD of the 1D perovskite thin film shows a strong peak of (002), which suggests the perpendicular alignment of the crystals.16 Needle crystals are observed in the SEM image (Fig. 1d), which suggests the formation of a 1D structure, as also shown in the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S2†).15Fig. 1e shows absorption (dashed line) and PL (solid line) spectra of the BDAPbI4 perovskite thin film. Due to the strong quantum confinement effect, high energy absorption at ∼480 nm is observed in the 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite thin film, which is much more blue-shifted than that of 2D perovskites.39 Upon excitation at 380 nm, the 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite thin film exhibits broad emission, with a maximum at 610 nm, similar to the features of the 1D lead bromide perovskite [N,N-dimethylethylenediamine]PbBr4.35 This broad emission is due to the formation of self-trapped states in the 1D perovskite, as shown in Fig. 1f.34
Perovskite thin films BDAPbI4·n − 1MAPbI3 with n = 2 to 4 (referred to as N2, N3, N4) were prepared (see details in the Methods section). C 1s core level XPS spectra of the BDAPbI4, N4 and MAPbI3 perovskite thin films were recorded (see Fig. S3†). The BDAPbI4 sample is dominated by C–C species, and MAPBI3 is dominated by the C–N species. The N4 sample shows both MAPbI3 perovskite and BDAPbI4 perovskite XPS features, which indicates the introduction of 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite.40 SEM and cross-sectional SEM images of N2, N3, and N4 samples are shown in Fig. S4.† 1D crystals are unobservable after introducing MA cations into the 1D structure. This is due to the competition between the BDA cations, which can form 1D perovskite wires, and the MA cations, which can expand the perovskite growth outside the 1D wires. The N4 sample shows a compact and uniform thin film, compared to the N2 and N3 samples with some pinholes. PL spectra (Fig. 2a) of the N2, N3, and N4 samples show emission peaks at 480 (yellow line), 530 (purple line), 570 (blue line), and 610 (red line), and a broad peak around 660 nm (black line). The peak at 480 nm is attributed to the 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite phase. PL decays at different wavelengths (660, 700, and 740 nm) in the broad 660 nm peak and fitting results are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1,† which shows different carrier lifetimes. This result suggests that this broad peak is attributed to different phases. Emission peaks at 530, 570, 610 and 660 nm are attributed to the low-dimensional perovskites formed via two possible routes: first, the isolation effect of BDA cations; second, the isolation effect of the 1D BDAPbI4 quantum wires. To have a better understanding of the isolation effect, we intentionally prepared single crystals from a solution of BDAI, MAI and Pb2+. If the isolation is mainly caused by the BDA cations, the BDA cations should be able to play their roles leading to the formation of quasi-low dimensional perovskite crystals with the chemical formula of BDAMAn−1PbnI3n+1. However, only pure 1D BDAPbI4 and 3D MAPbI3 are formed (as shown in Fig. S6†) and quasi-low dimensional BDAMAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite crystals are absent. These results suggest that the formation of a quasi-low dimensional perovskite with the chemical formula of BDAMAn−1PbnI3n+1 can be excluded, and therefore rule out the isolation effect of BDA cations. The remaining possibility of the emission peaks at 530, 570, and 610 nm is the molecular isolation effect of 1D BDAPbI4 quantum wires in the perovskite thin film, which is similar to the situation observed in ethylenediamine lead iodide (EDAPbI4) perovskites.41 To further confirm the isolation effect of the 1D perovskite, HRTEM measurement was conducted on the N4 sample and the HRTEM image of the 1D–3D perovskite regions is shown in Fig. 2b, which clearly exhibits the interaction between 1D BDAPbI4 (marked by the red zone) and 3D MAPbI3 (marked by the blue zone) perovskites. As shown in Fig. 2b, the 3D domains are aligned with a family of lattice planes (200) and the edge-sharing PbI6 units in 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite are preferentially interfaced with 3D domains, displaying linear arrangement and isolating the 3D domains.36 The schematic illustration of the isolation effect is shown in Fig. 2c. The different peak positions at 530, 570, and 610 nm are due to the different strengths of quantum confinement.18,42 XRD patterns of the N2, N3, and N4 samples are shown in Fig. S7,† and their low diffraction patterns are highlighted in Fig. 2d. The presence of low-angle diffraction peaks in Fig. 2d further confirms the formation of low-dimensional perovskite phases. In the N2, N3 and N4 samples, the 1D quantum wires terminate 3D phases molecularly and lead to an enlarged unit cell. This enlarged unit cell can be characterized by the reflections at low diffraction angles.16

(e) PL decay profiles of different emission peaks from N4 perovskite thin films. 
PL kinetics of different emissions in the N4 films were further studied with time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL). PL intensity decays of different emission peaks (480, 530, 570, 610, and 660 nm) and fitting results were measured and are shown in Fig. 2e and Table S2.† An increase in carrier lifetime is observed when the peaks change from short to long wavelength. This increase in carrier lifetime is due to the mitigation of quantum confinement.43 The long wavelength emission peak (e.g. 660 nm) suggests a limited quantum confinement and leads to lower binding energies, which can facilitate exciton dissociation. PL intensity decays of emission at ∼660 nm in N4, N3 and N2 samples and fitting results are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S3.† The N4 sample shows a longer carrier lifetime compared to N3 and N2 samples. This suggests that introducing more 1D perovskite will lead to a strong isolation effect, resulting in a short carrier lifetime. Electron and hole mobilities of these perovskites are estimated via a linear fit from the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) region, as shown in Fig. S9.† Obviously, the N4 device shows a higher current density than N3 and N2 devices in the SCLC region, suggesting higher electron and hole mobilities compared to N3 and N2 samples (see more details in the ESI†). The TRPL and SCLC results suggest that the N4 sample has a long carrier diffusion length compared to N2 and N3 samples.
Solar cells utilizing N2, N3 and N4 perovskites as absorber layers were fabricated and measured under standard AM1.5G illumination. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves with different scan directions and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3. Photovoltaic parameters of these PSCs are shown in Table 1. It is recorded that devices achieve the highest PCE of 14.1% for the N4 sample and 9.0 and 3.8% for the N3 and N2 samples respectively and the PSCs show a negligible J–V hysteresis (Fig. 3a). The high performance of the N4 sample is due to the uniform film (Fig. S4†), long carrier lifetime and fast carrier mobilities, as mentioned above. EQE integrated current densities agree well with that obtained from J–V curves. Statistics of PCEs based on 25 devices with the N2, N3, and N4 samples are illustrated in Fig. S10† and photovoltaic performances of 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite are shown in Fig. S11.† Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on N4, N3 and N2 devices (Fig. S12†). Only one semicircle is resolved, which describes charge transport resistance (Rct). The Rct of the N4 PSC shows a value of 17 Ω cm2, which is smaller than those of the N3 (23 Ω cm2) and N2 (32 Ω cm2) PSCs. This small Rct value in the N4 PSC suggests better charge transport in the N4 perovskite, indicating inhibited charge recombination.

To further clarify carrier transport in the low-dimensional hybrid perovskite, TRPL was carried out on N4 samples with/without the HTL. The TRPL and fitting results of emission at ∼660 nm are shown in Fig. 3c and Table S4.† The carrier lifetime of the sample with the HTL is much shorter than that of the sample without the HTL, suggesting efficient carrier transport between the perovskite layer and HTL. The experiment is repeated on emission peaks at 530 and 570 nm. Interestingly, carrier lifetimes of these phases with/without the HTL show only little changes (Fig. S13 and Table S5†). These results point out that the phases with emission at ∼660 nm play an important role in carrier transport between the HTL and the perovskite layer due to the mitigated quantum confinement. Thus, it is reasonable that a 1D perovskite without isolation effect can show better efficiency than the current structure and the 2D perovskites.
Stabilities of the encapsulated N4 PSC are investigated and the 3D MAPbI3 PSC is also characterized for comparison. After each I–V measurement under 1 sun illumination, the devices were kept in the dark at room temperature (RT) and 85% relative humidity (RH). The measurements were repeated every ∼100 h. Normalized PCE as a function of storage duration is shown in Fig. 3d. The PCE of the 3D PSC decreases to 70% of its original value after 1000 h. In contrast, the N4 PSC retained 95% of its original PCE after 1000 h. Stability tests for N4 and 3D PSCs under continuous illumination and heating are also conducted, as shown in Fig. 3e and f. Obvious degradations are not observed for the N4 PSC under continuous illumination and heating, while the 3D PSC shows significant degradation under the same conditions. These results suggest that the low-dimensional hybrid perovskite shows improved stabilities compared to the 3D counterpart. The enhanced stability of the low-dimensional hybrid perovskite is attributed to the protection of the 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite. 1D BDAPbI4 perovskite, containing hydrophobic large organic cations in two domains, isolates the 3D perovskite molecularly, which can prevent the penetration of water molecules and ion migration.
3. Conclusion
Pure 1D BDAPbI4 and perovskite thin films containing 1D BDAPbI4 and 3D MAPbI3 with ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 were prepared. A high efficiency of 14% was achieved in BDAPbI4·3MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. Low-dimensional hybrid perovskite materials, with long-lifetime carriers and enhanced stability, are promising light absorbers for photovoltaic devices. This insight on 1D perovskites and its impact on optoelectronic device performance will accelerate the progress toward wide-spread applications of 1D perovskites in optoelectronic devices.
4. Methods
Materials
Lead(II)iodide (99.999%), lead(II)oxide (99.999%), methylammonium iodide (anhydrous), methylammonium chloride, hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in H2O), hypophosphorous acid (50 wt% in H2O), toluene (anhydrous), dimethylsulfoxide, and N,N-dimethylformamide (anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1,4-Benzene diammonium iodide was purchased from Greatcell solar. All reagents and solvents were used without further purification unless otherwise stated.
Growth of BDAPbI4 bulk single crystals
PbO powder (223 mg) was dissolved in a mixture of 57% w/w aqueous HI solution (1.0 mL) and 50% aqueous H3PO2 (200 μL) and heated to boiling (at ∼200 °C) under constant magnetic stirring, which formed a bright yellow solution. Then BDAI saturated 57% w/w aqueous HI solution (0.5 mL) was added to the above solution. The mixed solution was then heated to boiling. The stirring was then discontinued, and the solution was left to cool to room temperature during which time needle-shaped crystals started to crystallize. The crystals were cleaned with toluene and thoroughly dried under reduced pressure.44
Single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer with MoKα radiation at 293 K. Single crystals were selected and mounted on a nylon loop in Paratone-N cryoprotectant. Unit cell determination was performed in the Bruker SMART APEX III software suite.
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
The XRD analysis was performed on a Philips X' Pert diffractometer using copper X-ray tube (standard) radiation. The diffraction pattern was scanned over the angular range of 8–40° with a step size of 0.02, at room temperature.
Absorption spectrum measurements
Absorption spectra of perovskite thin films were measured at room temperature using a PerkinElmer model Lambda 2S UV-vis spectrometer in the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm.
Photoluminescence steady state studies
Steady-state photoluminescence spectra of perovskite thin films were obtained at room temperature on a FLS980 spectrofluorometer in the wavelength range from 450 to 800 nm. The instrument response function was 600 ps. The excitation light was 375 nm with a maximum average power of 5 mW and 81.1 ps pulse width.
Time-resolved photoluminescence
Time-resolved emission data were collected at room temperature using an FLS980 spectrofluorometer. The dynamics of emission decay were monitored by using the FLS980's time-correlated single-photon counting capability with data collection for 10000 counts in the maximum channel. Excitation was provided by an Edinburgh EPL-375 nm laser. The average lifetime was obtained from the tri-exponential decays.
Perovskite film fabrication
Different ratios of BDAI and MAI, 1 mmol lead iodide, and 0.4 mmol MACl were dissolved in 1 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide and 1 mmol dimethylsulfoxide to target the formation of perovskites with 1D and 3D ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3. The solutions were stirred at room temperature overnight in a N2 filled glovebox. The perovskite films were prepared by spin-coating the solution at 4000 rpm and antisolvent (i.e. toluene) was dripped during the spinning. Then the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.
Device fabrication and characterization
Solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/C60 (20 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag (70 nm). Thicknesses of the perovskite films were individually adjusted for achieving the highest PCE and were 350, 350 and 400 nm respectively for the N2, N3, and N4 samples (Fig. S4†). The electron- and hole-only devices were fabricated with configurations of ITO/PCBM/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/MoO3/Au. ITO glasses were cleaned by sequential sonication in soap water, deionized water and ethanol, and then treated with ozone plasma for 18 min before use. PEDOT:PSS was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. The samples were then transferred into a N2 filled glovebox and perovskite active layers were formed, as described above. Finally, devices were finished by thermal deposition of C60, 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP, Lumtec) and the Ag electrode. The device active area was 0.1 cm2, defined by the overlap between the ITO substrate and metal electrode. The devices were tested under simulated Air Mass 1.5 irradiance of a 100 mW cm−2 light source calibrated by a reference Si solar cell. The scan rate was 50 mV s−1. EIS results were measured with a ZAHNER IM6 workstation with a frequency range from 1 to 106 Hz under different biases. The obtained spectra were fitted by Z-View software.
