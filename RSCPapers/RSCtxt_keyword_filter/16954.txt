E-mail: OPV.CHINA@yahoo.com; xiaoz@nanoctr.cnReceived 12th August 2013, Accepted 3rd September 2013First published on 3rd September 2013AbstractA pyridine-functionalized pyrazolinofullerene (1) was synthesized in 42% yield via an improved one-pot reaction of C60, 3,6-di(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, and water. The structure of 1 was unambiguously determined by X-ray diffraction of its single crystal. Due to the coordination capability of the functional groups on fullerene, compound 1 was used as a buffer layer to modify ZnO in inverted polymer solar cells. The power conversion efficiency was improved from 3.65% to 4.18% for inverted P3HT:PC61BM solar cells.Due to the unique sphericity and electronic properties of fullerenes, fullerene materials have received extensive attention in the rapidly growing organic electronics research field.1 Fullerene derivatives are highly efficient acceptor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs), a promising technology for cost-effective production of electricity from solar irradiation.2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells based on fullerenes and conjugated polymers has surpassed 10% recently.3 Apart from acting as acceptors, fullerene materials can improve the solar cell performance by working as buffer layers between the active layer and the cathode since these buffer layers can dramatically reduce charge recombination and contact resistance.4 Much effort has been devoted to the development of new fullerene interfacial materials (FIMs) for OSCs.5 Inverted OSCs use a metal oxide (e.g. ZnO)-coated ITO as a cathode and a high work-function metal (e.g. Ag) as an anode, thus possessing much higher stability than conventional cells.6 However, the defects and traps on ZnO and the poor contact between the inorganic ZnO layer and the organic active layer lower the performance of inverted cells.7 The device performance can be improved by coating ZnO with FIMs, such as fullerene self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).7b,8 In designing fullerene SAMs, carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid groups are frequently-used anchoring groups due to easy formation of covalent bonding with ZnO.8 However, the acidic groups on fullerenes could etch the ZnO layer. Therefore, a less acidic group like catechol was recently used for fullerene SAMs, showing good performance. The chelation between catechol and Zn2+ offered a different binding force.8c Being inspired by this work, we think that the basic nitrogen-heterocycle (NHC)-functionalized fullerenes could be good SAM candidates since NHCs can coordinate Zn2+.9 Besides, H-bonding between NHC and hydroxy groups on ZnO provides an additional driving force for self-assembly.10 In this work, a pyridine-functionalized pyrazolinofullerene 1 was facilely prepared through a one-step reaction from C60 (Scheme 1). Two pyridines and one pyrazoline on compound 1 create a chelating function. Compound 1 as a buffer layer on the ZnO surface enhanced the PCE of inverted P3HT:PC61BM solar cells by 15%. Scheme 1  One-pot synthesis of pyrazolinofullerene 1. In the literature, compound 1 was obtained via a hydration-rearrangement reaction of the Diels–Alder product of C60 and 3,6-di(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine.11 An improved one-pot synthesis was developed in this work. Under white light irradiation, refluxing C60, tetrazine, and water in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) directly afforded compound 1 in 42% yield (Scheme 1). Compound 1 was confirmed by spectroscopic methods (see ESI†). The structure of 1 was determined by XRD analysis of its single crystal, which was obtained by slowly diffusing ethanol into CS2 solution of 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the newly-formed pyrazoline ring connects with the [5, 6] junction on fullerene and is in a planar configuration. The pyridine ring connected with the carbonyl group points away from a fullerene cage. These structural features are quite similar to those of an aminated analogue of 1 reported by Balch et al.11 The bond lengths of the three fullerene Csp3–Csp3 bonds, C12–C13, C12–C19, and C13–C22 are 1.615(8) Å, 1.548(8) Å, and 1.550(10) Å, respectively, which are shorter than the corresponding bond lengths in the analogue compound. The absorption spectrum of 1 in chloroform shows a characteristic peak at 430 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†). The cyclic voltammogram of 1 shows three reversible reduction waves with the half-wave potentials at −1.17 V, −1.54 V, and −2.15 V, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†). The LUMO energy level of 1 estimated from the onset reduction potential (−1.10 V) is −4.00 eV.12 This LUMO level is close to the conduction band of ZnO (−4.4 eV), suggesting that 1 is suitable for ZnO modification.13 Compound 1 possesses good thermostability, showing 5% weight loss at 273 °C (Fig. S7, ESI†). Fig. 1  Structure of 1. Ellipsoids were drawn at the 40% level. To form the buffer layer on the ZnO surface, the ZnO substrate was firstly immersed in ODCB solution of 1 (0.1 mg mL−1) for 2 hours.8a,c Then, the physically adsorbed fullerene molecules on ZnO were removed by rinsing the substrate with ODCB. The water contact angle increased from 35° to 63° after modifying the ZnO surface with 1, suggesting that the fullerene layer makes the ZnO surface more hydrophobic. This phenomenon is similar to previous reports on ZnO modification with fullerene materials.8 Inverted P3HT:PC61BM solar cells with the configurations of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (device A) and ITO/ZnO/1/P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (device B) were fabricated to evaluate the effects of the fullerene buffer layer on device performance. J–V curves for devices A and B are shown in Fig. 2a and device performance parameters are listed in Table 1. Under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), the reference device A without a buffer layer gave a PCE of 3.65% with a Voc of 0.59 V, a Jsc of 9.79 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63%, while device B with a buffer layer afforded an enhanced PCE of 4.18%, with a Voc of 0.60 V, a Jsc of 10.47 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66%. The 15% PCE enhancement of device B results from its higher Jsc and FF. Device B shows higher EQE than that of device A (Fig. S8, ESI†). The lower series resistance (Rs) and higher shunt resistance (Rsh) of device B account for its higher FF. The fullerene buffer layer on the ZnO surface provides extra D/A interfaces for exciton dissociation to enhance photocurrent and also helps to reduce the contact resistance.7,14 To further understand the function of 1, we fabricated the bilayer heterojunction solar cells, ITO/ZnO/P3HT/MoO3/Ag (device C) and ITO/ZnO/1/P3HT/MoO3/Ag (device D). Device D with 1 gave higher Jsc and FF, and a much lower Rs compared with that of device C (Fig. 2b, Table 1). These results indicate that compound 1 as a buffer layer acts as a better acceptor than ZnO and might improve electron collection efficiency of the cathode.

By using the SAM technique, the 1-modified ZnO improved the PCE of inverted P3HT:PC61BM solar cells by 15%. This buffer layer enhances exciton dissociation at the interface and reduces contact resistance of the device, leading to higher Jsc and FF. More work on developing highly efficient fullerene materials as buffer layers is ongoing.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the “100 Talents Program” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21102028).Notes and referencesF.
