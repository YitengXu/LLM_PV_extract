    , Accepted 19th April 2022First published on 21st April 2022AbstractThe efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells prepared via hydrothermal methods recently broke the bottleneck of 10%. However, limited by the black-box hydrothermal process, important experimental details, such as the real-time chemical reaction process, precursor temperature and pH in the hydrothermal reactor, have not been acquired accurately until now. Moreover, the hydrothermal method is unfavorable for fabricating large-area devices. Herein, we develop a simple and monitorable chemical bath deposition (CBD) method to fabricate an Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layer. Owing to the open space of CBD, the physical and chemical processes during the whole film deposition could be studied based on the real-time precursor color, pH and temperature. The comprehensive understanding of CBD further guided the optimization of Se/S composition and film thickness. Finally, a champion efficiency of 8.27% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.625 V, a short-circuit current density of 22.98 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 57.6% were achieved, representing the highest efficiency among all CBD-based antimony chalcogenide solar cells.
1. Introduction
Antimony chalcogenides (including Sb2Se3, Sb2S3 and their alloys) have emerged as non-toxic alternative absorber materials to CdTe because of their excellent characteristics, such as high absorption coefficient under visible light, environmentally-friendly constituents, low cost and outstanding physicochemical stability.1–3 Over the last decade, Sb2Se3 and Sb2S3 solar cells have made great progresses in terms of their power conversion efficiency (PCE),4 but Sb2(S,Se)3 alloy solar cells are regarded to have higher efficiency compared to pure Sb2Se3 and Sb2S3 since the optical bandgap of Sb2(S,Se)3 alloy can be continuously adjusted to the ideal bandgap (1.3–1.4 eV) by varying the composition ratio of Se/(Se + S).5–7
As shown in Table 1, different synthetic approaches have been used to prepare Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. In 2014, Seok et al. reported an impressive efficiency of 6.6% based on solution-processed Sb2(S,Se)3.8 Thereafter, vacuum methods such as rapid thermal evaporation (RTE) and vapor transport deposition (VTD) were utilized to prepare Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, but their efficiencies were consistently lower than 7% up to 2019.9 Recently, Chen et al. achieved a breakthrough efficiency of 7.05% using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique.10 Almost simultaneously, Li et al. elevated the efficiency of vacuum-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells to 7.27% via V-shaped bandgap engineering based on a VTD method, which is currently the record efficiency for Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells prepared via a vacuum method.11 In parallel, great achievements have also been made for solution-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. In 2019, Chen et al. achieved an impressive efficiency of 7.82% for Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells via post-selenizing the hydrothermal Sb2S3 films.12 In 2021, the record efficiency for hydrothermal Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells was rewritten as 10.7%, which is the champion efficiency among all antimony chalcogenide solar cells, including Sb2Se3, Sb2S3 and Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.7 It can thus be seen that solution methods have exhibited advantages compared with vacuum methods.

Unlike well-established chalcogenide absorber materials with a high melting point (Cu(In,Ga)Se2: 1340 K; CdTe: 1366 K; Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4: 1120 K), antimony chalcogenides have a low melting point (Sb2Se3: 884 K; Sb2S3: 823 K), thus meaning that antimony chalcogenides can be easily vaporized and decomposed at relatively low temperatures.13 Mass spectrometry results have indicated that the dominant components of Sb2(S,Se)3 at high temperature are SbSe, SbSSe, SbSe2, Sb3SeS2, Sb3Se2S, and Sb3S3, among others in its mass spectrum, much more complicated than that of CdTe.14 These complex intermediate components clarify that vacuum vapor deposition is likely to generate harmful point defects during the film growth and cooling processes. As a result, the complex defects in vacuum-based Sb2(S,Se)3 films may explain their inferior PCEs compared with those of solution-processed devices. Although the recently emerged hydrothermal method led to a device being produced with >10% efficiency, how the Sb2(S,Se)3 film grows during the hydrothermal process has remained unknown until now, because important experimental details, such as chemical reaction, temperature and pH in the hydrothermal reactor, are difficult to monitor in real time. Moreover, it is intrinsically difficult to fabricate large-area devices. Therefore, a simple and monitorable solution-process approach with the capability of large-area preparation is expected to be useful in the fabrication of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.
Chemical bath deposition (CBD) is such a simple solution approach that has several inherent advantages over the recently emerged hydrothermal method. For instances, (i) low-temperature deposition favors flexible and low-cost devices; (ii) real-time monitoring of precursor states and the deposition process can be used to study the film growth mechanism; (iii) large-area fabrication can be applied to photovoltaic modules; (iv) continuous raw material supplement can increase the throughput capacity and allow potential investigation in V-shape bandgap engineering. As a result, CBD is more flexible than the hydrothermal approach. In 2014, CBD was used to fabricate Sb2S3 solar cells and a high efficiency of 7.5% was achieved, which is still the champion efficiency of Sb2S3 solar cells to date.15 Despite its success in being used to fabricate Sb2S3 solar cells, the CBD method has never yet been reported to fabricate Sb2Se3 and Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, perhaps because of a lack of suitable selenium sources. It is notable that Seok et al. fabricated Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells via a two-step process, including spin-coated Sb2Se3 and CBD Sb2S3, but the resulting devices could not be called standard CBD Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.8
In this work, we developed a simple and monitorable CBD method to fabricate Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells for the first time. Benefiting from the open space of CBD, the physical and chemical processes during the formation of Sb2(S,Se)3 films were studied in detail. We monitored the solution pH, the reaction temperature and the solution color in real time during the entire reaction process. Subsequently, the Se composition and the film thickness were optimized carefully. Finally, we successfully fabricated high-quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films and achieved an efficiency of 8.27% based on an FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au device structure.
2. Result and discussion
2.1 Fabrication of Sb2(S,Se)3 films

Fig. 1a shows a schematic diagram of the CBD setup. The detailed experimental process is described in the Experimental section and Fig. S1 (ESI†). In brief, K(SbO)C4H4O6·1/2H2O, Na2S2O3·5H2O, selenourea (SU) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) served as Sb, S, and Se sources and complexant, respectively. Subsequently, a CdS-coated fluoride tin oxide (FTO) substrate was introduced to the precursor for the deposition of an Sb2(S,Se)3 film. The temperature of the chemical bath was set to 90 °C. The time-dependent precursor temperature was monitored in real time (Fig. 1b). The precursor showed a temperature-rise period from room temperature to the set 90 °C during the initial 6 min. After 6 min, the precursor temperature was maintained at 90 °C, with an average fluctuation of ±1 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†) during the entire deposition process, except for a slight disturbance when putting the reaction vessel in the chemical bath.

(e) Relationship between the film thickness and deposition time. 
The temperature evolution of the precursor directly determined the chemical reaction and Sb2(S,Se)3 film deposition processes in the reaction vessel. Therefore, combined with the real-time pH curves, we can deepen the understanding of the reaction process. As shown in the grey area in Fig. 1c, the pH of the solution reduced to 3.35 after adding EDTA because one EDTA molecule contains four –COOH groups (Fig. S3, ESI†). Then, the pH increased to 3.67 after adding K(SbO)C4H4O6·1/2H2O. This was caused by the hydrolytic reaction of K(SbO)C4H4O6·1/2H2O (eqn (1)). (SbO)C4H4O6− + 4H+ → C4H6O6 + Sb3+ + H2O(1)
Following this, after adding Na2S2O3, the pH value slightly increased because of the H+ consumption under acidic conditions (eqn (2)). S2O32− + 2H+ ⇔ H2S2O3(2)
SU had no remarkable impact on the pH value since the concentration of SU was sufficiently low. After all the raw materials were added, the reaction vessel was placed in a 90 °C water bath (white area in Fig. 1c). The pH of the precursor was affected by the balance process between the hydrolysis of K(SbO)C4H4O6·1/2H2O and Na2S2O3 and the ionization of EDTA. The former is a hydrogen consuming process, and the latter is a hydrogen production process (eqn (1) and (2)). When the temperature was lower than 55 °C (red dashed line in Fig. 1c), the ionization degree of EDTA was weaker than the hydrolysis of K(SbO)C4H4O6·1/2H2O and Na2S2O3, accounting for the rapid increase in the precursor pH. The weak ionization of EDTA at <55 °C could be confirmed by the pH of EDTA in pure water (blue dotted line in Fig. 1c). When the precursor temperature was over 55 °C, the EDTA started to dramatically hydrolyze, leading to the reduced increase in pH. When the precursor temperature reached 80 °C (black dashed line in Fig. 1c), EDTA was fully hydrolyzed, and the precursor pH remained almost constant. The more detailed equations of the chemical reactions that take place during the entire CBD process are shown in eqn (S1–S8).†
Next, we discuss the film growth process. According to film growth theory, the growth process of CBD-Sb2(S,Se)3 films can be divided into two processes, nucleus formation and nucleus growth.24 The nucleus formed when the temperature was lower than 80 °C (grey area in Fig. 1b). At this stage, although the temperature was low and pH was not stable (Fig. 1c), electrostatic adsorption between the FTO/CdS substrate and charged ions (e.g. Sb3+, Se2−, S2−) occurred and formed the initial nucleus. When the temperature reached 80 °C, the pH was stable and the nucleus started to grow. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), once the nucleus radius was larger than the critical radius (determined by the thermodynamic equilibrium process), the nucleus continuously grew, however, nuclei with radii smaller than the critical radius degenerated.25 The large nucleus evolved into a continuous film in the manner of an Ostwald annexation mechanism.26 When the critical nucleus crossed the thermodynamic barrier, the nucleus began to grow rapidly. The film growth process is schematically sketched in Fig. 1e. After 5 min of reaction, it was notable that the temperature of the precursor reached 90 °C (dashed line in Fig. 1b) and the color of the precursor turned brown (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating the formation and growth of the critical nucleus. We inferred that the film started to deposit after 5 min. At this stage, the pH and temperature of precursor was located to the stable interval (black dashed line in Fig. 1c), explaining the linearity between the film thickness and deposition time (Fig. 1d). The calculated slope indicated that the deposition rate was about 2.08 nm min−1. When deposition time was longer than 3.5 h, the growth rate became slow because of the reduction of the precursor concentration.
2.2 Characterization of Sb2(S,Se)3 films
As has been thoroughly discussed in the literature, the strong anisotropy of quasi-one-dimensional Sb2(S,Se)3 results in the strong dependence of carrier transport on film orientation.27 Therefore, the study of film morphology and orientation is particularly important in the field of antimony chalcogenide solar cells. The as-deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 films were smooth and pinhole-free but showed spherical-like grains (Fig. 2a). We further confirmed that the spherical-like grains were amorphous clusters according to their featureless X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2b). To crystallize the amorphous Sb2(S,Se)3 films, we annealed the samples in a vacuum tube furnace at 350 °C for 15 min under a nitrogen atmosphere of 50 torr. The annealed film was crystallized, according to the X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2d), and obvious grain boundary texture appeared on the surface of the Sb2(S,Se)3 film (red area in Fig. 2c). Notably, the spherical-like grains remained (green area in Fig. 2c). It is clear that one large grain contains several small spherical-like grains. According to the cross-section SEM image of the annealed Sb2(S,Se)3 film (Fig. 2e), these small spherical-like grains originate from the fluctuation of the FTO/CdS surface. This is consistent with our hypothesis that CBD can be used to deposit film in the manner of a uniform coating.28 Based on the above analysis, the real grain size of our Sb2(S,Se)3 film is as large as 2.5 μm. The large grains can reduce the grain boundary and thereby are beneficial to restraining defect generation.

(e) Cross-section SEM of the annealed Sb2(S,Se)3 film. (f) Energy level alignment of the CBD-Sb2(S,Se)3 with spiro-OMeTAD and CdS. 
2.3 Structure design and fabrication of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells
The XRD pattern of the annealed film (Fig. 2d) clearly shows that the (hk0) orientations are dominant. A previous report pointed out that the (hk0) orientations are not optimal for Sb2X3 (X = S, Se, S/Se) solar cells because of their inferior carrier transportation.29 Thus, in our case, a hole transport layer with matched energy levels and a proper Sb2(S,Se)3 thickness are necessary to promote the collection of photogenerated carriers. We further extracted information on the valence band, conduction band and Fermi level of the annealed Sb2(S,Se)3 film using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S6, ESI†).29 The equilibrium band diagram indicates that there is no transport barrier between Sb2(S,Se)3 and the commonly used electron transport layer CdS and hole transport layer spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 2f).17 Based on the above analysis, we constructed an FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure. The spiro-OMeTAD HTL was spin-coated onto the annealed Sb2(S,Se)3 films, and Au electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation. A schematic diagram of the device structure is shown in Fig. 3a. A typical cross-section SEM is shown in Fig. 3b.

The thickness of the (hk0)-dominated Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layer significantly affects the carrier extraction in the device.30 Therefore, we optimized the Sb2(S,Se)3 film thickness from 140 to 520 nm by adjusting the deposition time from 1.5 to 4.5 h (Fig. 1d and Table 2). As the thickness of the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber layer increased, the device efficiency increased initially, followed by a decrease (Fig. 3c and Table 2). The maximum PCE was 5.33% when the deposition time was 3.0 h and the corresponding Sb2(S,Se)3 thickness was 350 nm. The devices with <350 nm thick Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber experienced penetration loss, thus the photocurrent was dramatically decreased. While, too thick an Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber caused high series resistance, leading to lower Jsc and lower fill factor (FF) values because of the above-mentioned (hk0) orientation issue.

We further adjusted the bandgap of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films via fixing the concentration of TU (161 mmol L−1) and adjusting the concentration of SU from 4.67 to 18.7 mmol L−1. Fig. 4a shows the UV-vis transmittance spectra of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films prepared with different concentrations of SU and annealed at 350 °C for 15 min. The bandgaps of Sb2(S,Se)3 films were fitted as Tauc plots (Fig. S7, ESI†).31 The optical bandgap of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films changed from 1.59 to 1.44 eV as the concentration of SU increased (Fig. 4c). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were further measured to confirm the bandgap evolution.32 As shown in Fig. 4b, with an increase in SU concentration, the PL emission peak shifted from 860 nm (1.44 eV) to 912 nm (1.36 eV). Combining the optical absorption bandgap and the position of the PL emission peaks, the Stokes shift was calculated and is shown in Fig. 4c and Table S1 (ESI†). The minimum Stokes shift was approximatively 0.061 eV, which is much smaller than that of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (0.17 eV) and other chalcogenides.33,34 The small Stokes shift reflects the small energy loss of excited electrons, in favor of a potentially high VOC in the solar cell.35 XRD patterns of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films with different SU concentrations are shown in Fig. 4d (left panel). The XRD diffraction peaks shifted to a lower angle with an increase in the concentration of SU (right panel of Fig. 4d), indicating that more Se was incorporated into the Sb2(S,Se)3 films. Thus, the content of Se in the Sb2(S,Se)3 films could be controlled by varying the concentration of SU in the precursor solution.

Sb2(S,Se)3 films with various Se content (or various bandgap) were assembled into solar cell devices. Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of these devices under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. The statistical device performance as a function of SU concentration is shown in Fig. 5b. The device with SU = 9.34 mmol L−1 achieved a champion PCE of 8.27% corresponding to a VOC of 0.625 V, a JSC of 22.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57.6% (Fig. 5c and Table S2, ESI†), which is the highest efficiency for CBD-based antimony chalcogenide solar cells at present. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of this champion device is shown in Fig. 5d. The EQE loss at 300–550 nm is due to the strong parasitic absorption of the CdS layer (Fig. S8, ESI†).5 According to the EQE, the absorption band edge of Sb2(S,Se)3 is located at ∼880 nm (Fig. S9, ESI†), in line with the fitted optical bandgap in the Tauc plot in Fig. 3c. The integral current density of the device is around 22.57 mA cm−2, in line with the JSC value measured from J–V curves under simulated AM 1.5G solar light. Furthermore, we carried out EDS tests at different sectional points of the champion device. The content of Sb, S and Se in the film is around 52.22–52.97 at%, 39.36∼39.66 at% and 7.67∼8.12 at%, respectively (Fig. S10 and Table S3, ESI†). Finally, the unencapsulated device exhibited 3% relative degradation from 8.27% to 8.03% after being stored under ambient conditions for 5 months (Fig. S11, ESI†), indicating that the CBD method has advantages in the preparation of long-term stable Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.

However, the efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells prepared by CBD is still lower than those prepared via hydrothermal methods. According to the device performance parameters (Table S2†), the low shunt resistance (Rsh) of CBD-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells is the main reason for their efficiency loss. Generally, low Rsh results from pinholes and leakage of current of the device.36 We therefore characterized the device as follows.
2.4 Characterization of the Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells
Physical characterization of the champion device was performed to understand its recombination mechanism and efficiency loss. Fig. 6a shows the semi-logarithmic dark J–V plot. According to the slope between 0 and 0.5 V, the calculated ideality factor (A) of the solar cell was 1.77, which is greater than that of 10%-efficiency hydrothermal devices (A = 1.43), but lower than that of vacuum-based devices (A ≈ 2).5 Fundamentally, A reflects the defect-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination properties of a device. 1 < A < 2 shows that the interface defect recombination is the dominant recombination mechanism in our CBD device. Therefore, interface recombination was responsible for the inferior efficiency compared to the highest-efficiency hydrothermal device.7 To further check the recombination mechanism in our device, we measured the light intensity dependent JSC and VOC values. Fig. 6b shows the power law dependence of the JSC value on light intensity (JSC ∝ Iα, where I is the light intensity), which exhibits a linear relationship on a double logarithmic scale, with α = 0.90. α < 1 means that trap-assisted SRH recombination is the dominant loss mechanism in our CBD-Sb2(S,Se)3 devices.37,38Fig. 6c shows the VOC value as a function of logarithmic light intensity. In this case, the device was measured under open-circuit conditions, and all photogenerated carriers recombine in the absorber layer, because no current is extracted. Therefore, the relationship of VOC ∝ n(kBT/q)ln(I) reflects the carrier recombination process, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and q is the elementary charge.39,40 A trap-free device should have a value of n = 1. Here, for our device, n = 1.63 indicates the presence of trap-assisted SRH recombination. Based on the above characterization, we concluded that the trap-assisted SRH recombination at the interface is the main recombination mechanism and restricts the device performance. The interface recombination can be reduced through interface engineering,37 for example, the recombination in Sb2(S,Se)3 absorbers can be further reduced by carefully controlling the temperature, growth rate, precursor concentration, post-annealing temperature and time, etc. Therefore, there is still great room for improvement of the performance of CBD-based Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells in the future.

(c) Power law dependence of the VOC value on the light intensity. (d) (A/C)2 as a function of bias voltage (V). (e) TPC and (f) TPV characterization of the Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. 
The commonly used capacitance–voltage (C–V) and drive level capacitance profiling (DLCP) measurements were carried out to quantify the defects in the CBD-Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. C–V measurements are an important method to measure the width of the depletion region, the build-in electric field, the defect density, and the defect distribution, which is sensitive to free carriers, as well as defects in the bulk and interfacial defects. DLCP measurements are an advanced C–V characterization technology in capacity building, however they are insensitive to interface defects.30,41,42 Thus, the bulk and interface defects can be determined by comparing the disparity between NC–V (defect density calculated from C–V measurements) and NDLCP (defect density calculated from DLCP measurements). Judging from the characteristics of C–V and DLCP, the interface defect density is 2.81 × 1015 cm−3 (Fig. S12, ESI†), which is responsible for the interface SRH recombination.30 The calculated built-in voltage (Vbi) from the C–V curve of our Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell was 0.891 V, which is much greater than the VOC value, indicating that there is still a lot of room for improvement.
We further investigated the carrier extraction efficiency and carrier recombination lifetime in the solar cells by conducting transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements. TPC measurements are implemented under short-circuit conditions, where the minority carriers are quickly swept out of the space charge region by the electric field. In this case, carriers are injected from the absorber into the buffer layer where they recombine at a faster rate. However, in the case of TPV measurements, photogenerated carriers can only recombine in the region of the absorber because of the open-circuit conditions.43 Thus, by fitting the TPC and TPV curves with a single-exponential decay function, we can preliminarily investigate the carrier extraction and recombination lifetime. As shown in Fig. 6e and f, the fitted carrier extraction and recombination time constants from the TPC and TPV measurements are 2.35 × 10−6 s and 2.83 × 10−3 s, respectively. The long carrier extraction and recombination lifetimes indicate that our CBD-based Sb2(S,Se)3 films have great potential for high performance.
The defect properties were characterized in depth by thermal admittance spectroscopy (AS). As shown in Fig. 7a, temperature-dependent AS were measured from 140 to 360 K with steps of 10 K. Two obvious capacitance steps could be distinguished from the entire curves with shifted frequency, which could be attributed to two defect levels within the bandgap of Sb2(S,Se)3 and denoted as D1 and D2. As is shown in Fig. 7b and c, we obtained the inflection frequencies (f0) for each of the defect levels as a function of temperature by plotting −fdC/df ∼ f curves. Thus, the activation energy (Ea) of the defect levels were calculated according to eqn (3),41,44,45 (3)where f is the temperature-dependent inflection frequency for a defect response, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ν0 is the attempt-to-escape frequency. As exhibited in Fig. 7d, the activation energies of two defect levels were extrapolated from the Arrhenius plots of ln(f0/T2) versus 1000/T, where Ea1 and Ea2 are 0.175 eV and 0.641 eV, respectively. According to the theoretical calculations and experimental results,46,47 the two defect levels can be attributed to interstitial S- (Si) and Sb vacancies (VSb), which usually form under S-rich conditions, as in our case.

Next, the density of states (DOS) of the two types of defects were calculated using eqn (4), which is typically written as48,49 (4)where Nt(Eω) is the defect density per energy of the defect with activation energy Ea, Vbi is the built-in potential, xd is the width of the space charge region, and Eg is the bandgap of the absorber. Eω can be calculated using the following eqn (5):48,49 (5)
The distributions of the DOS of defects D1 and D2 are shown in Fig. 7e and f. The blue scattered spheres correspond to the defect distribution evaluated from the differentiated capacitance spectra, while the blue contour line is extrapolated from the Gaussian-shaped distribution. The defect densities of D1 and D2 were calculated from the integral area of the Gaussian distribution, where the Nt values of D1 and D2 are 9.27 × 1015 cm−3 and 4.89 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The defect energy levels of the Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Defect D2 is close to the middle of the bandgap, and behaves as a recombination center, which hinders carrier transportation and degrades device performance. Compared with reported Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells prepared via hydrothermal methods, the defect densities of the CBD-processed Sb2(S,Se)3 devices are slightly higher but still on the same order of 1015 cm−3.5 This result further verifies that the quality of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films prepared using the CBD method is comparable to that of devices prepared via hydrothermal methods. However, more effort is required to reduce the defect density to <1013 cm−3 if a >10% efficiency is expected.50
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we exploited the feasibility of using CBD to prepare Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells and comprehensively studied the synthesis mechanism of the CBD process via monitoring of the real-time pH, temperature and time-dependent film thickness. The orientation, crystallinity, PL, absorption, Stokes shift and bandgap of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films prepared using this method were further investigated. Devices with a superstrate configuration of FTO/CdS/Sb2(S,Se)3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were constructed, and a champion efficiency of 8.27% (VOC of 0.625 V, JSC of 22.98 mA cm−2 and FF of 57.6%) was achieved. A series of measurements and analysis toward the champion device were carefully conducted, revealing that CBD has great potential in the fabrication of high-performance Sb2(S,Se)3 devices.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Device fabrication
All devices were prepared on FTO-coated glass with a 260 nm transparent conductive layer (SuZhou ShangYang Solar Technology Co., Ltd). The FTO glass was washed in sequence using aqueous detergent solution, acetone, isopropanol, ethanol and deionized water with the assistance of sonication. Each step lasted for 30 min. Then, the FTO glass was dried using compressed nitrogen, and treated with plasma for 10 min. The CdS layer was prepared using the CBD method, where the precursor solution contained 0.015 mol L−1 of CdSO4 (99.99%, Aladdin), thiourea (1.50 mol L−1, CH4N2S, AR, Sinopharm), ammonia (1.56 mol L−1, 25–28%, Sinopharm) and deionized water. A 60 nm CdS film was deposited onto the surface of the processed FTO glass after 18 min reaction at 66 °C. Subsequently, the CdS buffer layer was treated using a anhydrous solution of CdCl2 in methanol (20 mg mL−1 CdCl2 absolute methanol solution) via a spin-coating method at a rotation speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s, and was then annealed at 400 °C for 10 min in air. The preparation process of CBD-Sb2(S,Se)3 was as follows. The antimony source (54 mmol L−1, K(SbO)C4H4O6·1/2H2O, AR, Sinopharm), sulfur source (161 mmol L−1, Na2S2O3·5H2O, AR, Sinopharm), selenium source (selenourea (SU), 4.67–18.7 mmol L−1) and the complexing agent (3.42 mmol L−1, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), AR, Sinopharm) were dissolved in 40 mL of room-temperature deionized water in a glass bottle. The glass bottle with precursor solution was then placed in a 90 °C water bath and taken out after 20 min. At this time, the FTO/CdS substrates were placed in the glass bottle, where the conductive surfaces faced down in the precursor solution. Then, the glass bottle was placed in a water bath at 90 °C for 1–4.5 h to obtain amorphous Sb2(S,Se)3 films with different thicknesses. The temperature and pH value of the precursor solution during the entire film growth process was monitored using a pH meter (DDS-11A/307, Yueping) with a temperature step of 1 °C from 20–100 °C. After the deposition process of the amorphous Sb2(S,Se)3 layer, the as-prepared samples were put into a post-annealing furnace (OTF-1200X-4-RTP, Hefei Kejing Materials Technology Co., Ltd), and annealed at 350 °C for 10 min under nitrogen conditions at a pressure of 50 Torr to crystallize the Sb2(S,Se)3 films. For the preparation of the HTL, 14.5 μL of lithium-bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, 98%, J&K) solution in acetonitrile (ACN, 99.9%, J&K) (520 mg mL−1) and 9.5 μL of pure 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 98%, J&K) were added into 1 mL of spiro-OMeTAD (99.8%, Yingkou Youxuan Trade Co. Ltd) in chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%, SuperDry, with molecular sieves, J&K) solution (40 mg mL−1). Then, the as-prepared spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated onto the FTO/CdS/CBD-Sb2(S,Se)3 surface at a rotate speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s. After being oxidized for 48 h in dry air, gold electrodes with 80 nm thickness were deposited onto the surface of spiro-OMeTAD by a thermal evaporation system (Beijing Technol Science Co., Ltd) at a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa. Finally, the device structure of FTO/CdS/CBD-Sb2(S,Se)3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au was constructed. The active area of the device was 0.09 cm2.
4.2 Film characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns (Philips, X pert pro MRD, with Cu Kα radiation λ = 1.54178 Å) were performed to determine the phase and orientation of the Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films. The morphology of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films was studied by SEM (FEI Nova NanoSEM 450, without Pt coating). The optical transmittance of the Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Instruments, Lambda 950 using an integrating sphere). PL spectra of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films were measured using a Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Lab RAM HR800) with a 530 nm excitation laser wavelength at room temperature. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Specs UVLS, He I excitation, 21.2 eV, referenced to the Fermi edge of argon etched gold) was performed to determine the Fermi level, conduction and valence band positions of the Sb2(S,Se)3 film.
4.3 Device characterization

J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 instrument under dark and AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) conditions in air at room temperature. AM 1.5G conditions were simulated using a 450 W xenon light source (Oriel, Model 9119, Newport) and calibrated to a standard Si solar cell (Oriel, Model 91150V, Newport). For EQE characterization, we used a light source generated by a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport Oriel, 69911) split into specific wavelengths using Newport Oriel cornerstone TM 130 1/8 monochromator (Oriel, model 74004). C–V and DLCP characterization was conducted under dark conditions at room temperature using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200SCS). Transient photovoltage/photocurrent measurements of the Sb2(S,Se)3 thin films were carried out using a home-made system. A 532 nm light beam generated by a solid state laser (STG-03E-1X0, Teem Photonics) was modulated to a pulsed signal (1 kHz) by a function generator (33611A, Agilent). Then, the photovoltage signals from the illuminated device were collected by an oscilloscope (DSOS054A, Agilent). For measurement of thermal admittance spectroscopy, the capacitances of the device were obtained using an impedance analyzer (Agilent E4980A LCR meter), and variable temperature conditions were provided using a liquid nitrogen cryostat (Janis VPF-100) controlled by a temperature controller (Lakeshore 325).
