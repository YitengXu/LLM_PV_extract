    , Accepted 2nd March 2015First published on 2nd March 2015AbstractZn-doped SnO2 nanocrystals were successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. It is found that Zn doping into SnO2 can induce a negative shift in the flat-band potential (VFB) and increase the isoelectric point. As a result, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) based on Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystal photoanodes exhibit longer electron lifetimes and higher dye loading compared to undoped SnO2 based DSCs. The overall power conversion efficiency (η) of the optimized Zn-doped SnO2 based DSC reaches 4.18% and increases to 7.70% after the TiCl4 treatment. More importantly, a remarkable η of 8.23% is achieved for DSCs based on a high-quality double-layer SnO2 photoanode with the TiCl4 treatment, to the best of our knowledge, which is so far the best reported efficiency for DSCs based on SnO2 photoanodes.
1. Introduction
The growing demand for renewable energy sources has led to considerable development in many areas related to the research and manufacture of solar cells. Over the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a promising candidate for future green energy due to their low production cost and efficient photovoltaic performance.1,2 As a crucial component of DSCs, wide-gap semiconductor metal oxides play two significant roles as carriers for dye molecules and transporters for photoinjected electrons. Until now, more than 12% power conversion efficiency has been reported for DSCs based on mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystalline photoelectrodes.3 Semiconductor metal oxides other than TiO2, such as ZnO, SnO2, and Nb2O5, have also been investigated as potential alternatives to TiO2.4–10 Among them, SnO2 possesses a higher electron mobility (∼100–200 cm2 V−1 S−1)11,12 than TiO2 (<1 cm2 V−1 S−1),13 suggesting faster diffusion transport of photoinjected electrons to a transparent conductive oxide current collector. Moreover, in comparison with TiO2, SnO2 has a larger band gap (3.6 eV), which would create fewer oxidative holes in the valence band, resulting in a low sensitivity of UV degradation and enhancement of the long-term stability of DSCs.14
However, the overall power conversion efficiencies (η) of SnO2 based DSCs reported so far are much less than those of TiO2 based DSCs. The inferior photovoltaic performances of DSCs with SnO2 photoanodes are ascribed to the following: (1) an ∼300 mV positive shift of the conduction band edge of SnO2 in contrast to that of TiO2, leading to a faster electron recombination of photoinjected electrons with the redox electrolyte and a lower open circuit voltage (Voc);15 (2) a lower isoelectric point (iep, at pH 4–5) than anatase TiO2 (iep, at pH 6–7),6 resulting in less adsorption of the dye with acidic carboxyl groups. To solve these issues, a general strategy has been developed to enhance the photovoltaic performance of SnO2 based DSCs by coating on SnO2 photoanodes with a thin shell layer of semiconducting or isolating metal oxides, such as TiO2, ZnO, MgO, and Al2O3.6,14–21 It has been found that these thin shell layers can inhibit interfacial electron recombination and enhance the cell performance. Kuang et al. have achieved a highly efficient DSC with a power conversion efficiency of 6.8% based on the TiO2 coated hierarchical SnO2 octahedra.22 Recently, Lee and his co-worker have reported that Zn doping in ordered mesoporous SnO2 with a 2D hexagonal structure can tune the sub-band-edge surface states and improve the power conversion efficiency of ordered mesoporous SnO2 based DSCs from 0.81 to 3.73%.23 Shortly after that, Dou et al. reported that the power conversion efficiency of DSCs based on Zn-doped SnO2 nanoflowers with high electron mobility can reach 3.0% and increase to 6.78% after TiO2 coating.24 Therefore, incorporating both the advantages of Zn-doped SnO2 and TiO2-coated SnO2 is a good choice for improving the photovoltaic performance of SnO2 based DSCs.
To date, photoanodes are all comprised of nanocrystalline particles for high-efficiency DSCs due to their large surface area.3,25–32 However, DSCs based on Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystal photoanodes have not been investigated. Herein, we present the synthesis of Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystals by a simple hydrothermal method and their use as photoanodes in DSCs. It is found that Zn doping can suppress the interfacial electron recombination and enhance dye-uptake capabilities. Consequently, the performance of Zn-doped SnO2 based DSCs has a more than three-fold improvement compared to that of undoped SnO2 based DSCs. Moreover, after the TiCl4 post-treatment of the photoanode, the Zn-doped SnO2 based DSCs exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.70%. Finally, by employing a high-quality double-layer SnO2 film with the TiCl4 post-treatment, the performance of the Zn-doped SnO2 based DSCs is further enhanced, achieving a remarkable efficiency of 8.23%. To the best of our knowledge, DSCs based on the SnO2 photoanode that exceed the power conversion efficiency of 8% are prepared for the first time.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), potassium stannate trihydrate (K2SnO3·3H2O), urea, titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4), ethanol and acetone were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 1,3-Dimethylimidazolium (DMII), lithium iodide (LiI), iodine (I2), tert-butylpyridine (TBP), guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS), acetonitrile, valeronitrile, tert-butanol, ethyl cellulose powders (nos 46070 and 46080), α-terpineol, and chenodeoxycholic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The C106 dye was synthesized according to the literature method.28
2.2 Synthesis of undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystals
The undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Typically, a mixture of 20 mL of deionized water containing 0.6 M of SnCl4·5H2O and a predetermined amount of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 at.% atom ratio to SnCl4·5H2O) was slowly added to the ammonium hydroxide solution that was prepared by mixing 16 mL of NH4OH with 24 mL of deionized water. The mixture was stirred for 2 h. The solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the white products were centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and finally dried at 60 °C.
2.3 Synthesis of SnO2 spheres
SnO2 spheres were prepared using a modified hydrothermal method in an ethanol–water mixed solvent.33 In a typical experiment, 19 mM K2SnO3·3H2O and 0.1 M urea were added to a mixed solution of 12 mL ethanol and 18 mL deionized water. After mild magnetic stirring for 10 min, the solution was then transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 20 h. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the obtained products were centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and finally dried at 60 °C.
2.4 Electrode preparation and device fabrication
The typical preparation of the SnO2 paste is according to the standard procedure for the DSC electrode fabrication.34 The photoanode was prepared by screen printing the paste onto a pre-cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, Solar, 4 mm-thick) with an active area of ∼0.283 cm2 and a thickness of ∼8.5 μm. The TiCl4 treatment for the SnO2 nanoparticle films was performed by immersing the SnO2 photoanodes into a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. After that, the photoanodes were washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove residual TiCl4, and then sintered at 500 °C in air for 30 min. Finally, the photoanodes were stained by immersing them into a dye solution containing C106 dye (150 μM) and chenodeoxycholic acid (2 mM) in the mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio: 1/1) for 20 h. The dye-coated SnO2 electrode was subsequently washed with acetonitrile, and then assembled with a thermally platinized FTO positive electrode. The two active electrodes were separated with a 25 μm-thick Surlyn (DuPont) hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was filled with electrolytes using a vacuum back filling system. The electrolyte-injecting hole on the counter electrode made with a sand-blasting drill was sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass cover by heating. The electrolyte is composed of 1.0 M DMII, 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 1.0 M TBP, and 0.1 M GNCS in the 85/15 (volume ratio) mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile.
2.5 Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) observations were carried out with a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope operating at 200 kV. Field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-6700F microscope operating at 5 KV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were obtained from a PHI 5700 ESCA system. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined by N2 adsorption–desorption at 77 K using a BELSORP-max surface area analyzer. UV-vis absorbance spectra were recorded using Shimadzu 3600 UV-vis spectrophotometers. The dye loading capability was estimated by desorbing the dye into an ethanol–water mixed solution (volume ratio: 1/1) containing 0.1 M NaOH and subsequently measuring the absorption spectrum using a Shimadzu 3600 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The flat-band potential (VFB) was calculated from the Mott–Schottky plots. The standard three-electrode configuration was used, with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and the Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference.
2.6 Photovoltaic measurements
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a Zolix Omni-λ300 monochromator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp were used to measure external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 2 s under full computer control. A Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon diode used for EQE measurements was calibrated at the National Institute of Metrology, China. A model LS1000-4S-AM1.5G-1000W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was tested with a PMA2144 pyranometer and a calibrated PMA 2100 dose control system. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were obtained by applying a bias potential to a testing cell and measuring the photocurrent with a Keithley 2400 source meter under full computer control. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during all measurements. An antireflection film (λ < 380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) is adhered to the DSC photoanode during EQE and J–V measurements.
2.7 Transient photovoltage decay and charge extraction measurements
Transient photoelectrical experiments35 were performed on an Autolab-PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation with the ADC10M high-speed module, which can satisfy 100 ns time-resolved current and voltage tests. The static and perturbing lights were supplied with home-made white and red light-emitting diode arrays. We employed a red light to generate a photovoltage perturbation near the open circuit photovoltage of a testing cell under the irradiation of a certain white light and measured the voltage decay thereafter. The modulated photovoltage by the red pulse of a testing cell was below 5 mV and the transient signals follow a mono-exponential decay. Fitting an exponential function to the photovoltage decay can produce the electron lifetime. The electron density was estimated by the charge extraction method. A testing cell was first kept at open circuit under white light and subsequently the white light was turned off upon switching the cell from open circuit to short circuit to record the resulting current transient, and the electron density was obtained by current integration.
3. Results and discussion
The crystallographic structures of the undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles were determined by XRD as shown in Fig. 1. All of the diffraction peaks can be indexed to tetragonal rutile SnO2 (JCPDS, 41-1445). No diffraction peaks from other crystalline impurities were detected. This suggests that the dopants are well-dispersed and do not cause obvious variation in the SnO2 lattice structure. However, the intensities of the diffraction peaks gradually reduce and the full-width at half-maximum increases with an increase in the Zn-doped content, which may be attributed to a decrease in the grain size upon incorporation of Zn into the SnO2 crystal lattice.36 Further, the morphology of the undoped and 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles was characterized by TEM, as displayed in Fig. 2a and b. It is found that some larger particles obviously reduce in the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles compared to the undoped SnO2 nanoparticles. The average grain size of the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles is ∼15 nm. The representative HRTEM image of the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles is displayed in Fig. 2c. The clear lattice fringes in the HRTEM image indicate that these nanoparticles possess a single crystal structure. The inter-planar spacing is ∼0.334 nm, corresponding to the (110) plane of rutile SnO2.

To obtain more concrete proof for Zn doping in SnO2, XPS measurements were conducted on the undoped and 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 3a presents a comparison of the Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 transition peaks. Compared to the undoped SnO2 nanoparticles, the binding energies of Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 in the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles decrease from 487.4 to 486.6 eV and from 495.9 to 495.1 eV, respectively, which may be ascribed to oxide deficiency.37 It is also found that the O 1s transition peak shifts from 531.1 to 529.8 eV upon Zn doping (Fig. 3b). The shoulder peak could be attributed to Sn–O–Zn coordination.23 As shown in Fig. 3c, the binding energies of the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 transition peaks are 1020.4 and 1044.3 eV, respectively, which confirms the presence of Zn in the doped SnO2 nanoparticles.

The undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles were used as photoanodes for DSCs. Fig. 4a shows the J–V characteristics of the cells based on the undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 photoanodes under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), Voc and fill factor (FF) of the cell with the undoped SnO2 photoanode are 9.24 mA cm−2, 335 mV and 0.428, respectively, generating a low η of 1.32%. When employing the Zn-doped SnO2 photoanodes, the Voc and Jsc values of the cells are significantly enhanced. A maximum η of 4.18% is obtained for the cell based on the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 photoanode.

For DSCs with a fixed redox electrolyte, it is widely recognized that the Voc value is determined by the electron quasi-Fermi level in a given semiconductor material. To ascertain the influence of the Zn doping in SnO2 on the band edge or quasi-Fermi level, the flat-band potentials of undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 photoanodes were measured from the Mott–Schottky analysis.38–42 The VFB can be determined by the following Mott–Schottky equation43 (1)where C is the differential capacitance of the space-charge region, e is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, ND denotes the donor density, A is the surface area of the electrode, V is the electrode potential, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. VFB is the intercept extrapolating a straight line from the plot of the square of the space charge capacity against the applied potential. As shown in Fig. 4b, with increasing the Zn content, the VFB shifts from 0.19 V for the undoped SnO2 photoanode to −2.50 V for the 4 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 photoanode. The negative movement may be caused through the passivation of the sub-band-edge surface states by doping Zn into the SnO2 framework, leading to the upward shift of the quasi-Fermi level, which may interpret the enhanced Voc witnessed in the corresponding cells.23,41
To comprehend the Jsc increment of the cells based on Zn-doped SnO2 photoanodes, we measured the EQE spectra of these cells, as displayed in Fig. 4c. The EQE data follow the same trend observed for the Jsc of the Zn-doped SnO2 based cells. The EQE of the undoped SnO2 based cell is about 59% at 540 nm. However, the incorporation of Zn into SnO2 causes an obvious increase in EQEs over the entire spectral range compared to the undoped SnO2. The cell with the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 photoanode exhibits a maximum EQE of ∼74% at 540 nm. However, when the Zn-doped content is more than 2 at.%, the cell shows a lower EQE compared to other Zn-doped SnO2 based cells but is still higher than that of the undoped SnO2 based cell.
According to the above mentioned results, the negative movement of the VFB may also be interpreted as a shift in the position of the conductor band edge of SnO2 to higher potentials owing to Zn doping.41 The higher conductor band edge may impede injection of photoelectrons and thereby degrades the EQE.
In contrast to the undoped SnO2 based cell, the enhancement in the EQE and Jsc for the Zn-doped SnO2 based cells may be intimately related to the dye loading and interfacial electron recombination.44 The adsorbed amounts of dye molecules on different photoanodes were quantified from UV-visible absorption spectra. As shown in Table 1, the Zn doping can enhance the dye-uptake capabilities of SnO2 photoanodes. With the increase of the Zn-doped content, the adsorbed amounts of dye molecules increase from 3.94 × 10−7 to 5.95 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which can be explained by measuring the isoelectric points of undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. S1,† compared to the isoelectric point of the undoped SnO2 nanoparticles, the presence of Zn in SnO2 nanoparticles increases the isoelectric point from 4.3 to 5.1, which favors the attachment of dye molecules with acidic carboxyl groups.6 Accordingly, the Zn-doped SnO2 based cells exhibit higher EQE and Jsc values.
To clarify the effect of the Zn doping in SnO2 on the electron recombination process, we tested the dark current of the undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 based cells. Although the dark current is not a direct measurement of the electron recombination, it is meaningful when similar devices are compared. As displayed in Fig. S2,† the dark current of the cell gradually decreases with increasing the Zn-doped content at a given potential, suggesting that Zn doping in SnO2 can restrain the electron recombination at the oxide/electrolyte interface. We further resorted to the transient photoelectric decay technique to measure the electron lifetime (τe) in the undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 based cells. As depicted in Fig. 4d, the τe in the Zn-doped SnO2 based cells is significantly higher than that of the undoped SnO2 based cell at a certain extracted charge (Q) and increases with increasing the Zn-doped content, which is consistent with the trend observed in the dark current. The higher τe is attributed to the high electron mobility for the Zn-doped SnO2 photoanodes.24,45,46 It is well known that the τe in DSCs is the key quantity that determines the recombination dynamics of solar cells.47 The enhancement of the τe in Zn-doped SnO2 based cells shows the obvious inhibition of the electron recombination at the oxide/electrolyte interface. A low electron recombination rate is highly desirable to achieve a high charge-collection efficiency, which will also contribute higher EQE and Jsc as well as Voc.
In order to enhance their performance, the undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 photoanodes were subjected to a treatment by a solution of TiCl4. Fig. S3† shows the J–V characteristics of the undoped and Zn-doped SnO2 based cells with the TiCl4 treatment under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are also listed in Table 1. Compared to the cells without the TiCl4 treatment, the photovoltaic parameters of the cells with the TiCl4 treatment are significantly enhanced. The 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 based cell with the TiCl4 treatment achieves a power conversion efficiency of 7.70%. It is noteworthy that the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 based cell with the TiCl4 treatment exhibits a higher efficiency compared to the DSCs based on SnO2 photoanodes reported by other authors (Table S1†), which is attributed to the high quality Zn-doped SnO2 photoanode and C106 dye with high molar extinction coefficient. Moreover, it is found that the τe in the cells with the TiCl4 treatment is longer at a certain extracted charge than that in the cells without the TiCl4 treatment (Fig. S4†), which is because the TiCl4 treatment can improve the electronic connection of adjacent SnO2 nanoparticles while slowing down the recombination processes,48 resulting in the higher Voc. After the TiCl4 treatment, the Jsc enhancement of the cells is due to the increment of the dye loading (Table 1) as well as the suppression of the interfacial electron recombination.
We further employed a high-quality double-layer film via the TiCl4 treatment, with a transparent layer based on 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystals and a scattering layer based on SnO2 spheres (Fig. S5†), to obtain a high-performance cell. As shown in Fig. 5, this cell has a Jsc of 17.87 mA cm−2, a Voc of 670 mV, and a FF of 0.687, yielding a remarkable efficiency of 8.23% under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight. To the best of our knowledge, DSCs based on the SnO2 photoanode that exceed the power conversion efficiency of 8% are prepared for the first time. The EQE spectrum of this high-efficiency cell is shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The EQEs exceed 80% in the region between 470 and 640 nm. In view that the DSC is a very promising candidate for the conversion of weak light to electricity,2 we also measured cell efficiencies by attenuating AM1.5G full sunlight with a set of neutral metal meshes, and detailed cell parameters are collected in Table 2. At a light intensity of 12.16 mW cm−2, this cell reaches an impressive efficiency of 8.69%.

In summary, we have successfully synthesized Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystals under hydrothermal conditions and investigated their performance when applied as a photoanode material in DSCs. Zn doping into SnO2 is observed to induce a negative shift in the flat-band potential and increase the isoelectric point. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency of 4.18% is achieved for the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 based DSC, which is a more than three-fold improvement in comparison with the undoped SnO2 based DSC. The enhancement in performance is ascribed to improve electron lifetimes and dye-uptake capabilities. Moreover, after the TiCl4 treatment of the photoanode, the 2 at.% Zn-doped SnO2 based DSC exhibits an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.70%. In conjunction with a high-quality double-layer SnO2 film with the TiCl4 treatment, the cell performance is further enhanced, reaching a remarkable efficiency of 8.23%. DSCs based on the SnO2 photoanode that exceed the power conversion efficiency of 8% are prepared for the first time. Our work demonstrates that the Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystals coated with TiO2 are a promising photoanode material for boosting the performance of DSCs.
