    , Accepted 16th November 2013First published on 21st November 2013AbstractHierarchical structures are believed to be a viable approach to achieve higher conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In this report, a novel three-level hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure with the first level made up of nanourchins (NUs), the second level composed of nanowires (NWs), and the third level made up of nanoparticles (NPs) was synthesized using an ion-modified hydrothermal method and subsequent TiCl4 treatment. The hierarchical structure based DSSCs have achieved an overall conversion efficiency of 3.25%, which is 103.1% higher than that of their counterpart, pure NW based DSSCs. This improvement is attributed to the larger surface area and stronger light scattering effect of this new three-level hierarchical nanostructure, which reveals the significance and broad applications of hierarchical nanostructures.
Introduction
Nowadays, people are facing two critical challenging issues—environmental pollution and the lack of renewable energy resources. Thus, developing an environment-friendly and renewable energy resource is of great urgency, and solar cells will play a major role towards solving these problems. Over the past few decades, many kinds of solar cells have been designed and fabricated. In particular, since 1991, DSSCs have been found to have many advantages: they have a low cost, they are easily mass produced, and they entail simple fabrication equipment.1–4 For DSSCs, the fabrication and modification of photoanodes have gained great attention.5–9 Due to fewer grain boundaries, lower transfer resistance, and longer electron lifetime of 1 dimensional (1D) NWs than 0D NPs, TiO2 NW based DSSCs have been expected to outperform NP based DSSCs. Several methods, including template-assisted methods, electrochemical anodic oxidation methods, chemical vapor deposition, and hydrothermal methods,10–14 have been employed to synthesize oriented TiO2 nanorod/tube/wire arrays. However, the energy conversion efficiency of TiO2 NW based DSSCs is still lower than that of TiO2 NP based DSSCs probably resulting from lower surface area and lower dye loading of 1D NWs than 0D NPs.
In order to improve the performance of DSSCs, some strategies and new methods have been developed. One of the strategies is to increase the roughness and surface area by introducing NPs, thus increasing the loading amount of dye molecules. For example, double-layer films of NWs and NPs were fabricated to improve surface area and electron transport rate to enhance the energy conversion efficiency.15 Another strategy is to enhance the light scattering capabilities of photoanodes using specific designs. For example, a method of placing a layer of microparticles as scattering centers on top of the photoanode was developed. ZnO plates of 100–500 nm in size were placed on top of ZnO aggregates, and 47% enhancement in conversion efficiency was observed with the plate-like scattering layer.16 Later, another new method involving clean room processing techniques to fabricate photoanodes with periodic microstructures was proposed. A macroporous SU8 structure (size of ~500 nm) was firstly fabricated using a lithography method in a clean room and then was filled with TiO2 NPs before removing the macroporous structure.17 Recently, another new method was developed to enhance light scattering by introducing aerogel18 or polystyrene sub-micrometer spheres19 into the photoanode, which has been proved to be effective in improving the conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Nanostructures with larger surface area, higher dye loading, stronger light scattering capability, yet simpler fabrication procedures and lower manufacture cost are expected to be employed in DSSCs.
In this work, three-level hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure based photoanodes were firstly fabricated using a hydrothermal method and a subsequent TiCl4 treatment process. The configuration of the three-level hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure based DSSC is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1(b) illustrates the first level, a NU structure, while the second level is composed of an assembly of NWs. This kind of NU structure at the micrometer scale should be beneficial for light scattering in DSSCs. Fig. 1(c) illustrates a NW coating with numerous NPs, the third level, which is introduced after TiCl4 treatment. The NU, NW, and NP are the three different levels of components of the hierarchical nanostructure.

Experimental procedure
Preparation of photoanode
Fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) (17 Ω sq−1) conducting glass was purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Electronic Components Co., Ltd., and the chemicals were purchased from Guangzhou Chemical Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without any further purification.
The DSSCs were assembled through the following method. The FTO glasses (17 Ω sq−1, 1 cm × 2 cm) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min in ethanol, washed for 10 min in deionized water, and then dried by nitrogen purging. The TiO2 nanostructure was prepared through a modified hydrothermal procedure. The solution for the hydrothermal synthesis was a mixture of concentrated HCl (36 wt%), H2O and TiCl4 (volume ratio is 25:25:1.2, respectively). Next, the mixture solution went through ultrasonic treatment under ambient conditions for 15 min before adding a small amount of cation salts (CuCl2·2H2O, 0.1 M) and then kept for another 10 min under the same conditions. After that, the solution was poured into a Teflon lined autoclave. The FTO-glasses were placed into the solution against the wall with their conducting sides facing up. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 140 °C for 12 h in an oven.20 When the reaction was over, the autoclave was taken out immediately and cooled with tap water. The FTO was taken out, rinsed with deionized water to wipe off impurities, and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 20 min. Lastly, the substrate was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain the NU anode. In comparison, pure TiO2 NW anodes were synthesized through a similar procedure but without any copper ions.2 A three-level hierarchical anode (also called NU + TiCl4 anode) was obtained when the NU sample was further treated with TiCl4 (0.2 M) at 70 °C for 1.5 h, followed by an annealing process at 450 °C in air. Similarly, the NW anode went through TiCl4 treatment and an annealing process to coat a layer of NPs (called NW + TiCl4 anode).
Fabrication of the solar cells
The prepared photoanodes were immersed in anhydrous ethanol containing commercially available N719 dye (0.5 mM, cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis(tetrabutylammonium); Solaronix Co.) and kept for 12 h at room temperature. Pt counterelectrode (CE) was prepared by sputtering Pt on FTO for 30 min. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode (active area 0.1 cm2) and Pt-deposition counterelectrode were assembled into the sandwich-type cell. The redox electrolyte (0.3 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (MPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine (TBP)) in methoxypropionitrile was injected into the cell from the side by capillarity.
Characterization and instruments
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Abet Model 11000, light intensity is 100 mW cm−2), calibrated with a standard silicon solar photodiode (BS520, Bunkoh-Keiki Co. Ltd.). The active area was 0.1 cm2. The morphology of the samples was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, LEO 1530) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL TEM 100CX). Also, a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimazu UV-2550) was employed to obtain the absorption spectra of the photoanodes within the range of 300–800 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were taken using a computer-connected electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT 3, Princeton Applied Research).
Results and discussion
Morphology analysis

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the prepared pure TiO2 NW anode and three-level TiO2 nanostructure (that is, NU + TiCl4) anode. Fig. 2(a) shows a top-view of the pure TiO2 NWs, indicating that the diameters of the TiO2 NWs are in the range of 200–300 nm. Fig. 2(b) shows a tilted-view SEM image of the NWs, from which we can see that the length of the NWs is about 3 μm and that the crystalline NWs mainly grow vertically. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show top-view and side-view images of the prepared NU + TiCl4 anode. It can be noted that an additional layer of NUs appeared after the introduction of copper ions to the reaction solution. The thickness of the NU layer is ~20 μm, which is much thicker than the bottom layer of the NWs. The above SEM images can only show the first level (NUs) and the second level (NWs) of the hierarchical nanostructure, which are at sub-micrometer scale. In order to see the third level (NPs) at nanometer scale, electron microscope investigation at a higher resolution is needed. Fig. 2(e) and (f) are high resolution SEM images of TiO2 NWs without and with TiCl4 treatment, respectively. It can be easily observed that the NWs in Fig. 2(f) have many NPs covering the entire surface and their diameter is slightly thicker than that of the untreated NW in Fig. 2(e). This kind of three-level hierarchical nanostructure is believed to enhance the photoconversion efficiency due to a larger surface area for dye absorbing and a stronger light scattering effect.

TEM analysis
In order to study the microstructure of TiO2 hierarchical nanostructure surface, we have analyzed these samples with and without TiCl4 treatment using TEM. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show TEM images of a representative NW broken from the NU anode. Fig. 3(c) is a selected-area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) from this TiO2 NW, which confirms that the rutile TiO2 NWs are grown along the c axis, that is, the [001] direction. The surfaces of NW are smoothly clean and the tip of the NW splits into a few smaller NWs, compatible with the SEM image in Fig. 2(e). Fig. 3(d) shows a NW taken from the NU + TiCl4 anode, whose entire surface is covered with TiO2 NPs. Meanwhile, the morphology is consistent with the SEM image in Fig. 2(f). Fig. 3(e) is an enlarged TEM image, which shows that NPs are 8–20 nm in diameter. The six diffraction rings in Fig. 3(f) correspond to (110), (101), (210), (211), (002) and (301) planes of rutile TiO2.

XRD analysis
XRD results in Fig. 4 indicate that all TiO2 anodes are well crystallized in rutile form after the annealing process at 450 °C. All of them have the basic peaks of rutile TiO2, such as (110), (101), (111), (211), (220), (002), (301) and (112), while some changes are observed in relative peak intensity. The intensity of the (002) peak is an excellent indicator of the change. The (002) peak in the NW anode is highest among the four anodes, because all NWs in this NW anode grow along the [001] direction and vertically on the substrate. The NWs on the NU anode grow randomly; therefore, the (002) peak of the NU anode is much lower than that of the pure NW anode. NPs induced by TiCl4 treatment cannot cause a noticeable change in the (002) peak intensity because the amount of NPs is still limited compared to that of NWs. However, the small amount of NPs can still significantly change the surface morphology and in turn enhance dye loading for DSSC application.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of different DSSC anodes (NW, NW + TiCl4, NU, NU + TiCl4). 
Now, we should pay attention to the possible growth mechanism of the hierarchically structured TiO2. FTO substrate has a similar structure to rutile TiO2, and this similarity makes it possible to promote epitaxial nucleation and the growth of rutile TiO2 NW on FTO. According to the periodic bond chain theory,21–23 the strongest chemical bond is the one which grows at the fastest speed in the crystal, and the [001] direction of rutile TiO2 has the strongest chemical24 bond and the corresponding fastest growth rate in rutile TiO2. Therefore, TiO2 grows in the form of wires rather than particles. However, the obtained NW would be etched into many smaller TiO2 NWs in the range of 10–30 nm because of reverse reaction in the hydrothermal process.25 For the growth process of TiO2 NU, TiO2 can nucleate not only on the FTO substrate but also in the solution. Tiny single crystals of TiO2 appear, aggregate into larger polycrystal particles to minimize the surface energy in solution, and land on the FTO substrate. With the continuing reaction, NWs can epitaxially grow out of each (001) facet of the aggregated TiO2 particles and form NUs.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs

Fig. 5 shows photovoltaic performances of DSSCs measured at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs can be obtained by analyzing the I–V curves. They include four parts: (a) the short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc); (b) the open circuit voltage (Voc); (c) the fill factor (FF); and (d) the overall energy conversion efficiency of the cells (η). The cell fill factor (FF) obeys eqn (1): (1)and the Vmax and Jmax are the voltage and the current density under the maximum power outputting condition, respectively. Considering the FF parameter, the energy conversion efficiency can be estimated from eqn (2): (2)
 Fig. 5  
I–V curves of different DSSC anodes (NW, NW + TiCl4, NU, NU + TiCl4). 
The results of the photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs are listed in Table 1, which gives the corresponding short-current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and cell efficiency (η) for DSSCs with and without TiCl4 treatment. When the NU anode replaces the NW anode, the Jsc of DSSCs increases from 5.15 mA cm−2 to 6.17 mA cm−2. Also, the FF improves from 0.44 to 0.55. The increases of Jsc and FF are attributed to the higher light-harvesting (owing to the stronger light scattering and higher dye adsorption on NU). After TiCl4 post-treating of TiO2 NW, the Jsc of DSSCs based on the NW + TiCl4 anode increases up to 6.8 mA cm−2, yielding an increasing efficiency up to 2.14%. Besides, after TiCl4 post-treating of TiO2 NU, the Jsc and Voc of DSSCs based on the NU + TiCl4 anode increase to 8.27 mA cm−2 and 0.73 V, corresponding to an energy conversion efficiency of 3.25%. As a result, our novel three-level hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure based DSSCs, that is, the NU + TiCl4 DSSCs, exhibited remarkable enhancement in conversion efficiency, 34.3%, 51.8%, and 103.1% improvement compared to NU, NW + TiCl4, and NW DSSCs, respectively.

EIS analysis
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is used to investigate the charge transport and recombination in DSSCs, which provides an explanation of the enhancement mechanism of TiCl4 post-treating. Fig. 6 shows Nyquist plots of DSSCs based on four different photoanodes. Measurements were taken at a bias voltage of 0.6 V in the dark, and the frequency range is from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz. The equivalent circuit model is shown in the upper left corner of Fig. 6a. Rs represents the lumped series resistance for the transport in FTO and all the corresponding resistances outside of the cell, which correspond to the length from zero to the start point of the curve in Nyquist plots. For each sample, three semicircles are observed, including a small one at high frequency, a large one at medium frequency and an inconspicuous one at low frequency. They are, respectively, assigned to the electrochemical reaction at the Pt counterelectrode (Rct1) and chemical capacitance (CPE1), the charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte (Rct2) and chemical capacitance (CPE2) and the charge diffusion process of I−/I3− ions (Zw). Compared with the cell assembled with the TiO2 NW anode, the cell assembled with the TiO2 NW + TiCl4 anode shows significant reduction on Rct2. The same phenomenon is also observed on the TiO2 NU and TiO2 NU + TiCl4 assembled cells, which means that the TiCl4 treatment makes the electron transfer easier at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte.26 TEM and SEM demonstrate that NPs are produced and adsorbed on the TiO2 NW surface, leading to the great enhancement of surface area.

UV-Vis dye-absorption amount analysis
It is believed that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs is greatly correlated with the dye adsorption amount. Fig. 7 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of desorption dye from N719-sensitized anodes. According to the Lambert–Beer law, the absorbance is proportional to the solution concentration. (3)where A is the absorbance, T is the ratio of transmitted intensity to incident intensity, c is the concentration of the sensitizing dye in the solution, b is the thickness of the solution and K is a constant called the absorption coefficient due to the environment. From the equation, the calculated molar quantities of N719 absorbed on different TiO2 anodes are shown in Table 2. After the TiCl4 treatment, on the one hand, the amounts of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 NW + TiCl4 anode and TiO2 NU + TiCl4 anode increase by 39.5% and 32.8%, respectively, which are ascribed to the high surface area for the TiCl4 treated samples. On the other hand, the TiO2 NU anode shows a 54.5% increase of dye adsorption amount when compared with the TiO2 NW anode because the TiO2 NU anode is thicker than the TiO2 NW film. Therefore, our novel three-level hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure based anode, that is, the NU + TiCl4 anode, exhibited remarkable enhancement in dye adsorption, 47.1% more than the NW + TiCl4 anode and 105.2% more than the NW anode. The increase of dye adsorption greatly improves the performance of the solar cells.

Conclusions
We achieved a novel three-level hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure through an ion-modified hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent TiCl4 treatment. This new nanostructure consists of three levels: the first level is composed of NUs, the second level is made up of NWs, and the third level is composed of NPs. The obtained DSSCs based on three-level hierarchical nanostructures, due to their greatly enhanced dye absorption and light scattering capabilities, achieved a conversion efficiency of 3.25%, which is remarkably 103.1% higher than that of the counterpart NW DSSCs. Our findings pave the way for the design and fabrication of new types of DSSCs with better performance.
