    , Accepted 20th April 2020First published on 20th April 2020AbstractRevitalized attention in cost-effective vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) to ensure high-performance next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) via an easy synthesis protocol, with increased capacity, and two-dimensional (2D) Li-ion transportation pathways, results in a higher power capability than for one-dimensional (1D) migration pathway cathodes, such as LiFePO4. V2O5 has pride of place as a maximum reversibility cathode amongst other cathode materials and overcomes the obstacle of high energy density for LIBs by the evolution of different phases according to the degree of lithium intercalation. The four phase transformations of α ↔ ε, ε ↔ δ, δ ↔ γ, and γ ↔ ω, according to the Li-insertion numbers, can have different equilibrium potentials vs. Li, which is worth mentioning. Furthermore, this 2D-layered structure attains the theoretical capacity of 147 mA h g−1 in the limited 1 mol Li-insertion, which is comparable to the performance of LiFePO4 in terms of both working potential and capacity. Excess Li-intercalation leads either to large polarization or induces structural destruction, which makes this fascinating cathode unfit for potential applications. Although there are a few review articles available on V2O5-based cathodes, no reports exist on the fabrication of full-cells using this cathode. This review pays particular attention to the recent improvements in V2O5-based LIBs paired with different kinds of anodes, namely insertion, conversion, and alloying types. Challenges in the development of V2O5-based LIBs that would help to achieve advanced batteries in future, especially limiting 1 mol Li-ion intercalation to enable a promising candidate, are also discussed.Subramanian NatarajanSubramanian Natarajan is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Nanomaterials and Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Jeju National University, South Korea.

Introduction
In the 21st century, the impending scarcity of non-renewable energy resources has a strong influence on research to discover alternative sustainable energy sources, such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, photovoltaics, geothermal energy, biomass, nuclear fusion, and fission. To achieve this goal, scientific innovations and solutions for advanced energy storage have been receiving much attention in recent years. Exclusively, research on electrochemical energy storage devices is believed to be a solution to the energy shortage issue; however, the development of these devices is necessary to succeed in the regulation of power and leveling of the load. Various energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),1–9 multivalent rechargeable batteries (Al3+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+),10–13 lithium–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries,14–20 sodium-ion batteries (NIBs),21–28 and supercapacitors (SCs)29–38 are expected to be involved in high energy and power applications in the near future, although some of the technologies need to be researched further to rectify their drawbacks. Amongst these energy storage devices, the “Nobel prize-honored LIB” is still being researched even after its commercialization, based on the configuration of Nobel prize winner Akira Yoshino.39,40 Although enhancement in electrochemical performance is desperately needed, particular efforts are required on the cathode materials, owing to their consideration as a promising candidate for many applications, such as personal electronics, electric vehicles, smart grids, and hybrid electric vehicles, even though LIBs use raw materials that are scarce and high cost.6,41,42
The construction of LIBs in a sealed case generally includes a couple of current collectors for the cathode and anode, with the respective active materials paste either in the aqueous or non-aqueous electrolyte, and the electrodes being separated using a polyolefin membrane.5,43 The charging and discharging in LIBs happens due to the intercalation (Li-insertion) and deintercalation processes (Li extraction), where Li-ion revisits the positive and negative electrodes through the assistance of the electrolyte. The LIB powers a device using the production of electrons, where the lithium bound to the anode material breaks down during the discharging process, while the Li-ion moves and becomes bound with metal oxides on the cathode side. The Li-based metal oxide leaves the Li during the charging process, which allows the lithium ions to migrate to the anode with the electrons.2,44,45 Also, it is well-known that first-generation LIBs possessed a layered structure cathode (LiCoO2) and anode (graphite), which guaranteed enough space for the Li ions to be intercalated, which is usually essential to achieve high electrochemical performance.46–48 The properties of the cathode and anode materials are the deciding factors determining the energy storage capability of the electrochemical cell, although the affordability is restricted by the cathode material. Therefore, exploration of cost-effective and high-performance cathode materials is of much importance to realize advances in LIB technology.6,49
Lithium transition metal oxides are desirable choices as LIB cathodes owing to their attractive features of high electrochemical potential vs. Li, high theoretical capacity, and flexible layered structure for the transport of Li ions.50,51 This is clearly reflected in the commercially available LIBs, which contain mostly LiCoO2, LiNixMnyCozO2, LiMn2O4, and LiFePO4, until now.52–55 Currently, the scarcity and price of raw materials for the production of LIBs, such as Li, Co, and Ni, have been increasing dramatically, and are likely to rise further in future, urges researchers to find easy-access alternative sources, such as Fe- and V-based cathodes.22 Yet, next-generation LIBs should also possess high energy density and display good rate performance at low cost with improved safety features, so as to accommodate the rising demand for novel technologies.56 Some previously developed insertion materials, which were rejected in the past, are of renewed interest due to their diverse properties. One such material, V2O5, has been growing in use as a potential cathode because of its abundance, ease of preparation, low cost, high energy density, and good safety properties.57,58 Interestingly, the electrochemical performance of V2O5 is analogous to that of olivine LiFePO4, but the LiFePO4 synthesis process is arduous since it is an insulator and stabilizing Fe in the 2+ state requires an inert environment. On the other hand, V2O5 synthesis is very simple and offers two-dimensional (2D) Li-ion transport, which facilitates a much better power capability than LiFePO4. Similarly, it should be noted that both V2O5 and commercialized LiCoO2 are layered-type materials, and both reveal the same capacity of ∼150 mA h g−1 with different Li-insertion numbers.59 Generally, LiCoO2 has a theoretical capacity of ∼280 mA h g−1 for 1 mol of Li, although 0.5 mol of Li is extracted to maintain the structural stability, which shows only ∼150 mA h g−1 between 3 and 4.2 V. In the case of V2O5, the limiting Li-insertion of 1 mol into the matrix provides 147 mA h g−1 at a working potential of 3.4 V. In terms of toxicity, both layered materials perform in the same way, but LiCoO2 is far better than V2O5 in phase transitions, the chemistry involved in the electrochemical process, and crystal structure.59
Assembling a LIB using V2O5 with a graphite anode is complicated as it does not contain Li ions initially. This can be rectified by pre-lithiating the electrodes, which gives rise to low-cost and high energy density LIBs.60–62 Its morphology, wealth of chemistry and intricate processes make V2O5 a fascinating material for application in LIBs.48,63–67 Several reviews have been published on V2O5 as electrodes in LIBs.10,48,56,65,67–73 Most reviews are focused on the fundamentals of strategies in the synthesis of V2O5, developments in the various V2O5 nanostructures, such as nanobelts, nanowires, nanotubes and nanorods, influences of cation doping, carbon hybridization, and defects. In addition, reviews are available on the relationship between the structure and properties of layered V2O5 for LIBs. However, recent progress has been made in the fabrication of full cells using this low-cost V2O5 as the cathode with different kinds of anodes, which urgently requires more focus in order to develop high-performance LIBs. In this respect, to our knowledge, no review article or report has yet focused on this aspect. Here, we provide comprehensive information about full-cell fabrication with the aim of addressing the problems when constructing V2O5-based cathodes for LIBs. Overall, the scope of this review is first to give a synopsis regarding the crystal structure and the properties of V2O5 during the intercalation process, then to provide detailed statistics for the electrochemical performance of V2O5-based electrodes when paired with insertion-, conversion-, and alloy-type anodes. In addition, detail on the progress in the construction of solid-state batteries has been included, which may inform the next steps in the advance of LIBs based on V2O5-based cathodes. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges, which need to be addressed for V2O5-based LIBs, are also debated.
Structure and properties of V2O5
Generally, the intercalation compound V2O5 has an orthorhombic crystal structure, where the V2O5 layers are arranged over a weak van der Waals force that emanates below the Pmmn 59 space group.68,74 The edge- and corner-sharing in the orthorhombic crystal structure of V2O5 gives a weaker V–O interactions in the c-direction, thus providing the arrangement of layered V2O5 sheets.68,75 It can be seen from Fig. 1b that there are three different types of oxygen centers, named terminal (O1), bridging (O2) and integrated chain (O3) oxygen atoms, which possess different bond lengths in the crystal structure. The terminal O1 atom exhibits a very small bond length of ∼1.54 Å; the O2 atom acts as a bridge to link two proximate V atoms by corner-sharing in the role of VO5 square pyramids, with a bond length of 1.77 Å. Similarly, the three V atoms connected by O3 atoms through edge-sharing in the form of VO5 square pyramids have related bond lengths of 1.88, 1.88, and 2.02 Å.76In lieu of this, the square pyramids can be transformed into a distorted octahedron by the addition of one or more oxygen atoms with a bond length of ∼2.81 Å. Moreover, V2O5 also exists in the form of hydrated V2O5, which can be altered into the orthorhombic structure above 320 °C.77

The weaker van der Waals interaction between the adjacent layers supports V2O5 in undergoing many phase transitions of α, γ, δ, ε, and ω based on the degree of Li-ion intercalation (x) during the electrochemical process, which is replicated in the V2O5 discharge profile.59 The two-phase regions, such as α/ε, ε/δ, and δ/γ, are responsible for attaining the three corresponding unique potential plateaus at 3.4, 3.2, and 2.3 V vs. Li, respectively.78 The α phase forms when 1% of Li is intercalated into the crystalline V2O5, whereas the ε phase of LixV2O5 can also appear at 0.35 < x < 0.7 at room temperature; however, these two phases are analogous to that of the pristine V2O5. Further intercalation of Li in the range 0.7 < x < 1 brings about the δ phase of wrinkled V2O5 layers.59,79,80 In addition, the phase transitions of α ↔ ε and ε ↔ δ will be reversible if there is reorganization of the V–O bonds. A γ phase of LixV2O5 arises due to the high intercalation of Li (1 < x < 2), with even more vivid V2O5 layers compared to the δ phase.81 However, an irreversible phase, ω-LixV2O5, is likely to form when the Li-intercalation exceeds the range of 2 < x < 3, which yields formation of the tetragonal structure that disappears after one cycle.82–84 From the above results, it is recognized that Li-intercalation in the range x ≤ 1 confirms the formation of α, ε, and δ phases through the discharge process. In addition, it can be concluded that the intercalation process is topotactic, which ensures that numerous cycles can be performed without altering the matrix, by restricting the Li-insertion to 1 mol, in order to ensure the structural stability, reversibility and power capability of this cost-effective 2D V2O5 material.68,85
V2O5 with insertion-type anodes
Generally, intercalation-type materials behave as a host to receive guest ions and also eliminate their structural irreversibly in LIBs. Transition metal oxides (e.g., TiO2), chalcogenides (e.g., TiS2), and polyanion compounds (e.g. LiTi2(PO4)3) are excellent materials as hosts to accept Li+ into the network. In the case of anode materials, carbonaceous materials (e.g., graphite, hard carbon) now dominate in commercially viable LIBs in the energy market, following the failure of Li metal as an anode in LIBs due to dendrite formation, which causes batteries to catch fire. However, the class of graphitic and non-graphitic carbon used, on the basis of highly reversible lithium-ion storage, also involves a serious issue of ∼10% volume change during the Li-intercalation process, which reduces the battery cycle life.2,5,43
Free-standing graphene paper, however, occupies an ingenious position owing to its distinctive properties of high surface area, good mechanical strength, and greater electrical conductivity and has led to the acquisition of high energy and power density for flexible LIBs for bendable electronic devices. Kang and co-workers86 showed for the first time, that this flexible material template could be added into V2O5 using a pulsed layer deposition method, and they lithiated the graphene paper electrochemically in order to use it as the cathode and anode materials for fabrication of a flexible battery that exhibited a first discharge capacity of ∼15 μA h cm−2. In the same way, hybridizing V2O5 with reduced graphene oxide increases the ionic diffusivity, which revealed a high capacity of ∼213 mA h g−1 and presented an admirable energy density of 106.5 W h kg−1 when pairing with lithiated graphite, with the aim of achieving a Li metal-free full battery.87 Similarly, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VA-CNTs) dominate over carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in improving the electrolyte accessibility, thereby transporting more charges by means of its definite pore structure and larger surface area properties. For the first time, Lu et al.88 developed a prototype LIB using the combination of V2O5@CNT and VA-CNT electrodes able to achieve high energies and power densities of 297 W h kg−1 and 12 kW kg−1, respectively, and using the ionic liquid N-ethyl-N,N-dimethyl-2-methoxyethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide as an electrolyte to achieve a large electrochemical window for high rate applications.
Another type of high-capacity anode material, in the form of nanoscale metal oxides, has recently been explored, following the first study from Tarascon's group.89 Metal oxides undergo lithiation and delithiation processes via three different mechanisms, namely, insertion/extraction, conversion/displacement, and alloying/dealloying.34,90 The insertion/extraction mechanism was noticed first in various types of materials, including anatase phase TiO2. Generally, TiO2-based materials insert the Li+ into their structure at ∼1.75 V vs. Li, which is better than in carbon-based materials where the same process takes place close to 0 V vs. Li.91 At the same time, substitution of this promising material in place of the carbon material wipes out the concerns of lithium metal deposition and dendrite formation without the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase layer (SEI) on the surface. However, the SEI forms in the carbon, which brings about a first-cycle irreversible capacity loss problem. These great advantages, especially safety, make TiO2-based anodes suitable for use in aerospace and aviation applications. Among these materials, “zero-strain” Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) involves a very slight volume change of 0.2% during the Li+ intercalation process, and has been successfully commercialized.92 Cheah et al.93 first used this material to build a full cell assembly, with LixV2O5 as a cathode to rectify capacity fading issues during cycling. Generally, the structural arrangement in the V2O5 provides the possibility of a reversible Li-insertion/extraction process in the range of 3 mol, owing to the multiple oxidation states of vanadium, which helps to achieve a capacity of >300 mA h g−1. Nevertheless, capacity fading occurs once 2 mol Li-insertion is reached while cycling, due to structural changes and irreversible phase transformation. Therefore, the authors in this study adjusted the cut-off potential to restrict the Li-insertion to 1 mol, and confirmed this through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As a result of this, 1D V2O5 nanofibers achieved a good cycling life in the operating potential of ∼3.3 V vs. Li, and were prepared via an electrospinning technique. For practical applications, the full-cell has been constructed using commercialized spinel LTO as an anode and electrochemically prelithiated V2O5 (LiV2O5) as a cathode, offering first charge and discharge capacities of ∼125 and ∼119 mA h g−1, respectively. Capacity fading has been observed, however, as the cell is only able to achieve ∼84% of its initial capacity retention at 1.8 V, mainly because of poor affinity towards the electrolyte (LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate), which consists of linear carbonates. This same issue of capacity fading was noted in a half-cell configuration for V2O5 nanofibers.79 However, the restricted Li-insertion into the V2O5 structure paved the way for achieving good cycling performance. In addition, the fabricated full cell displayed a high energy density of ∼215 W h kg−1, suitable for high-power applications such as electric vehicles in the near future.
The same research group94 prepared submicrometer-sized V2O5via a urea combustion technique, chemically lithiated the V2O5 for three days using various concentrations (0.2–3.0 mol) of n-butyl lithium and found that the addition of 2 mol butyl lithium collapsed the V2O5 structure, as determined through XRD analysis. Intercalation of 0.5 and 1 mol butyl lithium into V2O5 formed two phases of ε-Li0.5V2O5 and δ-V2O5, respectively, which are considered as reversible phases, and which were confirmed from the electrochemical extraction of 0.2 and 0.5 mol of Li. In addition, it should be noted that higher intercalation (2 and 3 mol) of Li caused formation of the irreversible phases of γ-Li2V2O5 and ω-Li2.5V2O5 and changed the crystal structures to the distorted one. Furthermore, the full-cell with LTO as an anode was assembled in this study; however, it showed only a first charge and discharge capacity of ∼92 and 75 mA h g−1, respectively. In addition, less capacity retention of 67% was obtained in the operating potential of ∼1.75 V, which is much less than in the previous work. Three years later, Ren et al.95 paired the same couple of V2O5/LTO, which exhibited a high capacity performance of ∼139 mA h g−1 between 1.0 and 2.5 V at 1C and also retained ∼106 mA h g−1 even after 100 cycles, thus endorsing the good cycling stability for various applications. In this study, the researchers used the strategy of preparing hierarchical and multishell hollow V2O5 structures, which could be more beneficial for an effective charge–discharge process, through acquiring a larger surface area and high volumetric density of the LIBs. Furthermore, the results obtained highlighted the hierarchical V2O5 hollow structure in terms of its high electrochemical performance compared with the multishell V2O5 hollow structure, showing ∼147 mA h g−1 in the range 2.5–4.0 V at 1C (Fig. 2).

Similarly, V2O5 hollow microclews were reported by Mai and co-workers96via a simple solvothermal method, with the intention of enhancing the Li-ion diffusion kinetics so as to attain good cycling performance and high rate capability. Many attempts have been made to improve the diffusion of Li-ion by engineering the V2O5 into nanowires,97 nanobelts,98 nanorods,99 and porous structures.63 Nevertheless, these kinds of nanomaterial suffer from high tap density properties that lead to low volumetric energy density of the cell. In addition, the involvement of these nanometer-sized materials in side reactions when extending the electrode/electrolyte contact could result in safety issues and have a high chance of affecting the cycling performance of the material. Therefore, the authors attempted to prevent these kinds of problems by preparing a material composed of both nanosized and micrometer-sized particles (i.e. hierarchical superstructure) and constructed a device with lithiated Li3VO4@CNT as the anode. The reasons for choosing the anode material Li3VO4 were that it possesses the highest valence state of vanadium amongst Li–V–O compounds, affording a potential of ∼0.5–1 V vs. Li and a high theoretical capacity, and so is a promising and safer material compared with other intercalation compounds of graphite and LTO that demonstrate a potential of ∼0.1 and ∼1.5 V vs. Li, respectively.63 This insertion anode was first established in 2013, and it was stated that the volume expansion would be 4% if x = 2 in the Li3+xVO4 crystal structure through evading the advantage of dendrite formation.100 However, this new material still needs to be subjected to different approaches, such as carbon compositing or coating, in order to boost the conductivity of the material. Such a material coupled in a full-cell presented a first discharge capacity of 139 mA h g−1 in a mixture of carbonates of LiPF6 as electrolyte, as well as exhibiting 71.7% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 6.7C. The cell exhibited a very decent rate performance (at 20C), and the cell rendered a capacity of 70 mA h g−1 with 97% coulombic efficiency, which was mainly attributed to the good structural integrity of the V2O5 electrode through acquiring the benefits of short Li-ion transport, rapid electrolyte penetration and effective pulverization suppression.
Unfortunately, these V2O5 hollow structures could not maintain a controllable shell thickness, since these types of morphologies are very sensitive to temperature, pH, the concentration of precursors, and additives. Therefore, tuning the hierarchical thickness of hollow V2O5 materials has the possibility to give full interaction of the electrolyte with their unaffected surface microstructure. Shan et al.101 found a route to prepare the hierarchical surface of V2O5 hollow spheres using a template-free method with the benefit of adjusting the shell thickness by directing the internal diffusion. In addition, they used Li3VO4@CNTs as the anode material in the construction of a full cell with V2O5 exhibiting a specific capacity of 55 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1 assuring the good cycling stability of the device. Thus, a fabricated device able to light an LED device owing to a high voltage of 3.2 V emphasizes how the structural design of electrode materials can enhance the performance of LIBs (Fig. 3).

Generally, the most important criteria are material dissolution and structural changes in a liquid electrolyte, which severely diminish the electrochemical performance of the battery. In addition, V2O5 thin films are also considered as inappropriate in practical thin-film battery applications as a result of unwanted side reactions with aqueous electrolyte, which result in poor cycling stability after prolonged cycling.102 In this situation, an all-solid-state or quasi-solid-state battery would be a more appropriate device, as it is usually fabricated by thin-film materials to ensure high safety and could possibly offer more benefits, such as high flexibility, no electrolyte leakage, and long cycling life. Gerbaldi et al.103 have directly grown the methacrylic-based polymer electrolyte on V2O5 thin film via a UV-induced photopolymerization deposition process giving easy penetration of electrolyte ions to get easy access to an electrode material, thus accomplishing long cycling stability and high rate capability for the miniaturized device. It should be noted that the V2O5/polymer electrolyte multiphase composite paired with the graphite anode in the prototype battery presented 75 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 5C after 500 cycles in a lithium metal anode configuration, which could help in the construction of high rate capability energy storage devices.
A major revolution has occurred in the fabrication of a three-dimensional full cell device based on a V2O5 cathode material, which sets all components in a single nanopore structure to provide a definitive miniaturization energy storage device. Liu et al.104 designed such a device (Fig. 4) using atomic layer deposition (ALD), by coating the Ru metal, as a current collector, with α-V2O5 active material at two ends of anodic aluminium oxide nanotube arrays (AAO) and placing the pre-lithiated V2O5 as the anode, making self-alignment of the electrodes in the device closer within each nanopore, as well as giving room to electrons and ions for fast transportation within the nanopores of the AAO. It can be seen that the single cell possesses a length of 50 μm and an outer diameter of 250 nm in the fabricated device, from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-section image (Fig. 4a). The top view SEM image (Fig. 4b) revealed the AAO nanopores after the ALD process, and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images confirmed the growth of Ru and V2O5, showing that the fabrication of a high-power full-cell can be done efficiently using a single substrate via the controlled-conformality ALD process. The as-formed all-in-one nanopore battery acquired exceptional performance in full- and half-cell assemblies, retaining more than 80% initial capacity at 5C, and further providing a good cycle life of 1000 cycles in the voltage window 0.2–1.8 V. This was mainly because of the coaxial nanotube construction with the integrated Ru current collector, where the thin V2O5 layer deposited facilitated fast ion and electron transport.

V2O5 with conversion-type anodes
Several types of materials are being used as cathodes and anodes to build high-performance Li-ion batteries for advanced applications. Among these materials, Li-based transition metal compounds, including LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2, LiCoO2, LiFePO4, as well as V2O5, have served as good candidates in the development of high-performance cathode materials. In the same way, anode materials, such as intercalation, conversion, and alloying compounds, have played a role in accomplishing highly reversible lithium storage properties.2,5,90,105 Furthermore, researchers are exploring new kinds of suitable materials to increase the cycling performance of LIBs. In this respect, the development of 3D-ordered macroporous materials, for example, inverse opals, provide many opportunities, by means of their physical properties, to routes for increasing the cycling stability of LIBs. The high surface area and macropores of 3D inverse opals allow the active material to gain direct access to the electrolyte, which ensures good ionic and electronic conductivity. O'Dwyer and co-workers106 successfully produced the first all inverse opal LIB via pairing intercalation-type V2O5 as the cathode and conversion-type Co3O4 as the anode without using any binder or conductive agents, with the full cell exhibiting ∼150 mA h g−1 after 175 cycles. In asymmetric testing, the combination of dual-mode oxide pairs possessing quick charging (8C) and slow discharging (2C) achieved a pathway to obtain high capacity and high rate stable LIBs for advanced LIB applications.
Another study reported the contribution of flexible V2O5 as a cathode for bendable LIBs by using NiCo2O4 as the anode material after pre-lithiation.107 First, 1D nanostructures of binder-free V2O5 and NiCo2O4 nanowires were grown on the carbon fabric (CF) using a hydrothermal method, followed by calcination, to achieve effective electron transport and a stable structure. In a half-cell configuration, the V2O5-CF demonstrated a specific capacity of ∼265 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 and retained 91% capacity after 100 cycles with 198 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. The anode, NiCo2O4 was pre-lithiated as no electrode contained lithium as well, so as to develop the electrochemical potential difference between the cathode and anode. The resultant pre-lithiated material exhibited a low discharge capacity of 1077 mA h g−1, compared to bare NiCo2O4, mainly because of formation of the SEI layer during the pre-lithiation process. A polyethylene oxide-based quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte has been used to avoid safety issues, showing a specific capacity of ∼149 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 when a full cell was fabricated; however, the same full cell attained a capacity of 155 mA h g−1 in the liquid electrolyte with an energy density of ∼364 W h kg−1 at 240 W kg−1. This full-cell revealed a high energy density of ∼385 W h kg−1 at ∼250 W kg−1 in 1 M LiPF6-based electrolyte. Fig. 5d shows the set-up used to validate simultaneously the electrochemical performance and flexibility of the flexible LIB powering an LED light (Fig. 5a). In addition, this bendable device had a better capacity of 187 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 and it presented almost the same value after different folding and bending states (Fig. 5e and f).

V2O5 with alloy-type anodes
Interest in alloy-type anode materials has been growing in order to replace the “unsafe behaviour” of graphite, which is the current preference for the anode material in LIBs. Alloy-type anodes can be identified as high capacity and are well-known for their lower working potential.34,90 Usually, alloy-type anodes have 2–10 times higher theoretical specific capacity than graphite, and are significantly better than the recently commercialized anode material Li4Ti5O12, showing a 4–20 times higher capacity. Moreover, the moderate operation potential for alloy materials vs. Li avoids lithium deposition, which occurs at ∼0.05 V vs. Li if graphite anodes are used.2,6 Mostly, tin, silicon, antimony, germanium, and aluminium have been scrutinized as anodes due to their natural abundance and environmentally friendly features. The group from the University of Maryland104 who designed the symmetric 3D nanobatteries based on V2O5 electrodes, extended their study by replacing the V2O5 anode with SnO2 after pre-lithiation and fabricated an asymmetric device using the same ALD technique.108 In addition, they substituted the Ru current collector with a Pt current collector in which the nanobatteries were connected in parallel. The fabricated device presented higher energy, of 4.6 times, and superior power density, of 5.2 times, than the previously reported symmetric device (V2O5-based electrodes) via fine tuning of the output voltage between 0.3 and 3.0 V. Moreover, in the presence of organic electrolyte this promising device maintained 98% of its original capacity even after 550 cycles at the higher rate of 25C, prompting the researchers to suggest it as a future battery technology. Long et al.109 were the first to find a route for the fabrication of 3D thin-film solid-state batteries that would lay the foundations to move this research forward in a successful direction.
Enhancing both energy and power densities concurrently through engineering for thin-film solid-state batteries on 3D substrates is an effective method. The same group110 has come up with an innovative idea to construct 3D solid-state batteries by growing five conformal layers using the same ALD technique. The 3D fabrication was done using a Si substrate using deep reactive ion etching and photolithographic patterning methods to attain cylindrical pore arrays with the desired parameters. Subsequently, the ALD method was applied to deposit all five battery-active layers; then, physical vapor deposition was used to deposit a Cu mask for each battery followed by low-energy Ar+ ion milling, which separates each battery. In order of deposition for the 3D cell: Ru was formed at 250 °C in a furnace tube reactor with a thickness of 40 nm; LiV2O5 was formed electrochemically at a C/3 rate with 2.8 V after V2O5 deposition in the range of 70 nm; and solid electrolyte Li2PO2N of 40–100 nm was grown up in an ALD reactor at 250 °C using the desired reactants. Furthermore, deposition of the 10 nm SnNx anode was achieved in the ALD reactor by engaging (dimethylamido)tin and an N2 plasma, followed by 25 nm TiN deposition at 200 °C. It should be noted that the whole process occurred at or below 250 °C showing the capability of the ALD technique for growing materials uniformly under low-temperature conditions.111,112 The fabricated 3D thin-film solid-state battery, which consists of a multilayer battery structure, accomplished an admirable cycling capacity of 400 cycles with only 0.02% capacity loss per cycle and achieved 2.6 μA h cm−2 (37 μA h cm−2 μm, normalized to the cathode thickness). However, it should be noted that the real breakthrough could be realized by substituting the LiV2O5 cathode with LiCoO2, which should be grown conformally.
Another vapor phase chemistry method, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), was used to synthesize graphitic carbon layers that supported the formation of binder-free-based V2O5, where V2O5 is made by an in situ technique. By employing flexible SnOx-CNT as an anode, the full-cell was constructed with this flexible electrode in 1 M LiPF6-based electrolyte for the first time. The preparation of V2O5@CNT through electrospinning, followed by the CVD technique, showed excellent flexible, robust, and free-standing behaviour. With excellent performance observed in a half-cell configuration, the cathode revealed its Li storage properties in a full-cell by showing 224 mA h g−1 reversible capacity at 0.1C, a rate capability at 30 A g−1 retaining a capacity of >90 mA h g−1 and a cycling performance over 200 cycles with 0.04% per cycle capacity loss. Moreover, a flexible V2O5@G-Sn-based prototype battery was developed to examine electrode design for real applications, which presented outstanding cyclic and mechanical properties (Fig. 6).113

Conclusions and future perspectives
Increasing demand for high-energy and high-power electronic appliances is a constant trend, in order to gain better quality electric vehicles, advanced portable electronics, and effective grid-scale stationary storage. Research is still needed to focus on improving the energy density, power density, cycling life, safety features, and rate capability for the development of a new generation of batteries using low-cost and high-performance cathode materials. Among the developments of new potential cathodes, V2O5 displays the outstanding properties of low cost, high abundance, good safety characteristics and excellent lithium storage behaviour, which results in the V2O5 intercalation cathode being a good contender to replace existing commercial cathodes, such as layered LiCoO2, spinel LiMn2O4, olivine LiFePO4, and other types of cathodes in LIB applications. Nevertheless, to commercialize V2O5 as a high-performance cathode for practical applications, some challenges associated with its low discharge voltage, poor cycling life, low electrical conductivity, and some other properties need to be overcome efficiently. Comprehensive research has reported that the above-mentioned drawbacks can be avoided via tailoring the surface properties, enhancing the crystallinity, using a suitable strategy for the chemical composition, and constructing micro- as well as nanostructures.114 However, these improved properties should be well studied when a full cell is constructed for practical applications that provide a real breakthrough for real-world applications. The chemical, electrochemical, structural features, and intercalation mechanism of V2O5-based composites are summarized in this review for the full-cell application when this intercalation cathode is paired with different categories of anodes.
The hierarchical structure of V2O5 with different scales of well-aligned nanopores from both nano- to micro-scale could offer extraordinary capacity and cycling stability, by providing enough space to promote fast electron transport to obtain more current collection, and the nanosized V2O5 electrodes, which can sustain larger stresses, can encourage long cycling life before pulverization, compared with bulk V2O5 electrodes.114 In addition, compared with 1D and 2D structures, 3D hierarchical V2O5 nanostructures are more attractive, increasing the transport kinetics of ions and electrons through their semi-continuous conductive networks, as well as having the potential to preserve structural stability. Moreover, the micro- and nanostructures are supposed to overcome the agglomeration issues, which brings enhanced capacity performance for high-performance energy storage devices. A few reports have considered the synthesis of 3D-hierarchical nanostructures, such as hollow spheres and hollow microclews, through the solvothermal technique, which have the potential to be upgraded. In addition, microwave irradiation has attracted attention in recent years and is able to synthesize different kinds of morphologies and innovative nanostructures by reducing time and energy consumption.115,116 Greater electrochemical performance will be achievable if we intervene more in the electrode design, fabrication, and construction of the V2O5 and V2O5-based composites. Addition of carbon materials, such as graphene or carbon nanotubes, into the V2O5 could augment the electrical conductivity and maintain the structural stability. A few efforts have demonstrated the hierarchical core–shell structures for assembling state-of-the-art V2O5 and V2O5-based composite electrodes, which benefit from considerable performance gains by combining multiple factors. In addition, there are many experimental approaches that have given their best for producing high-performance V2O5 and V2O5-based composites, as discussed earlier, based on these requirements. However, low-cost and practical preparation techniques are a prerequisite for implementing large-scale synthesis when it comes to the commercialization process. In this regard, three approaches, solution-processed, combustion, and solid-state reactions, have the potential to allow bulk synthesis of V2O5, and microwave irradiation can also be considered for large-scale preparation, in an attempt to reduce the energy consumption.
In addition, doping of V2O5 with cations should be investigated, as there are no reports available for the full-cell assembly, as well as doping with two or three different cations to attain desirable electrochemical activity. Additionally, comprehensive studies show that structural defects (vacancies or local disorder) of V2O5 are required, which can greatly impact the V2O5 performance. With regard to current collectors, the lightweight as well as porous and hierarchical characteristics of Ni foams, graphite foams, graphene paper, and carbon nanotube sponges could be employed for improved electrochemical activity. Moreover, development of the fabrication of flexible free-standing V2O5 electrodes should be encouraged for wearable electronics applications. At the same time, constructing 3D thin-film solid-state batteries by a simple and cost-effective process should be appreciated, as the use of liquid electrolytes in conventional LIBs significantly hinders the scope for their miniaturization for various potential applications. Vapor phase chemistry techniques, such as ALD, result in uniform growth of thin conformal films in hundreds of different aspect ratios and is suitable for creating miniaturized components. Some reports are available showing greater electrochemical performance involving expensive processes and more complicated steps; however, studies are urgently needed for commercial processes that are simple, cost effective, and environmentally friendly for the mass production of V2O5 electrodes. Overall, the study of V2O5-based full-cells and their intercalation mechanisms, engenders a message to design a flawless, effective process for the development of novel electrode materials that will assist in gaining advanced V2O5-based energy storage devices.
In a full-cell configuration, few studies have utilized more than one Li to fabricate the full-cell, which eventually leads to the fade in capacity. However, limiting lithiation into V2O5 to 1 mol results in excellent cyclability, and this limiting also has promising features. Some research has considered extension of the voltage window to permit the third Li-ion intercalation. In brief, many recent reports on V2O5 with 3 mol of Li-ion intercalation show a superior capacity of 360 mA h g−1 or above, although this process was assessed to be problematic in the beginning by reason of formation of the stable ω-phase, which is irreversible, and structural destruction. This eventually leads to severe capacity fade upon cycling. Generally, demonstration of the two-Li-ion intercalation mode on V2O5 is quite common owing to the practical selection of the applied voltage window and formation of the stable γ-phase, which offers a theoretical capacity of 294 mA h g−1 as well as delivering maximum specific capacity of >275 mA h g−1 practically, based on recent studies. In the case of 1 mol Li-ion intercalation on V2O5, the reported studies revealed a maximum specific capacity in the range 135–147 mA h g−1 with a working potential of ∼3.3 V vs. Li. These three different intercalation processes highlight three different results and encourage advanced nano-architectures, such as hierarchical, which improve the electrochemical performance of the V2O5 electrodes, through controlled synthesis techniques.48 Another interesting fact is that the voltage profile is similar to the LiFePO4 working potential window. This limited lithiation mode of V2O5 should be explored further as a strong contender to the LiFePO4 cathode in terms of high power capability owing to the 2D Li-ion transport, compared with the 1D migration in the olivine phase. Limiting the lithiation up to 2 mol is another important prospect to retain the structural integrity of the V2O5 phase. However, there is a huge polarization between 1 mol (∼3.3 V vs. Li) and 2 mol (∼2.2 V vs. Li) intercalation, which hinders the potential use of the cathode. Therefore, 1 mol of Li with a higher working potential (∼3.3 V vs. Li) and a decent capacity of 147 mA h g−1 is tailor-made for potential applications, which was clearly demonstrated by Cheah et al.79,94 and Ren et al.95 Further study should be focused on limiting to 1 mol of Li in the V2O5 structure, and also the possibility of pairing graphite, which could offer 3.2 V as a working potential. This configuration is comparable to the commercially available LiFePO4/C system. Unfortunately, no such efforts have been carried out to date, and so this provides another opportunity for researchers to fabricate a potential V2O5 energy storage device.
