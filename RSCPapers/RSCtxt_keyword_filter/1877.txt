    , Accepted 21st March 2016First published on 1st April 2016AbstractThe fundamental science behind the design of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells lies in the formation of energy level gradients for efficient charge separation and collection. Tuning the energy levels at the device electrodes by the right choice of the components is a key requirement for achieving enhanced characteristics. Here we demonstrate control and optimization of OPV cell performance by using a set of polypyridyl complexes based on iron, ruthenium, and osmium centers with tunable frontier orbital energies as interlayers for inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells. We found that changing the metal center of isostructural transition-metal complexes results in evident shifts of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the work functions of the corresponding interlayers, which has a prominent effect on the device performance. We generalize our approach by combining the interlayers with different sets of photoactive materials to test the electron transporting as well as the hole blocking characteristics of the interlayers.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ OPV) cells comprising blends of conjugated polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors have attracted considerable interest in the field of renewable energy for both fundamental and technology-driven studies.1–3 Such cells hold potential for efficient, cost-effective solar energy conversion and the development of unconventional optoelectronic materials and processing.4–8 During the past two decades, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ OPVs has undergone a significant improvement owing to the development of novel polymeric and small molecule-based donor materials,3,9–14 efficient interlayers,15–25 and device fabrication and engineering.13,26–29 In a BHJ OPV device, the photoactive layer is sandwiched between charge carrier selective interlayers and the electrodes. In order to minimize the energy barrier between the photoactive layer and a high work function (WF) cathode (e.g., ITO or FTO), it is necessary to introduce a buffer layer at their interface. The selection of an effective electron transporting/hole blocking buffer layer, which can effectively build-up the symmetry breaking, is one of the key approaches to enhance OPV cell performance. Such a layer must (i) possess suitable energy levels to improve the charge-selectivity of the corresponding electrodes, (ii) have sufficient conductivity to reduce resistive losses, (iii) be chemically and physically robust to prevent undesirable reactions at the active layer or electrode interfaces and endure device processing, and (iv) have a smooth and contiguous morphology. Amorphous transition metal oxides such as TiOx and ZnO have been used as interlayers in inverted OPV cells owing to their large band gaps and conduction bands well-aligned with the fullerene LUMO.30–34 The use of sol–gel chemistry for the formation of metal oxide films results in difficulties in controlling the film morphology, chemical composition, and conductivity, particularly at low processing temperatures. An alternative approach employs alkali metal compounds such as Cs2CO3, which alters the ITO WF by forming an interfacial dipole layer.35,36 However, the poor hole-blocking ability of the Cs2CO3-modified ITO cathode reduces the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).25 Recently, several compounds have been introduced as cathode-modifying materials, such as conjugated polyelectrolytes,16 polymers,17–19 and small molecules.20,21 Modifiers based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of dipolar molecules have also been used for tuning the ITO WF.22–24 Therefore, organic or metallo-organic electron transporting layers (ETLs) are advantageous due to their ability to tune and optimize the properties of this layer by simple synthetic means and for their use in developing all-organic devices.
Here we demonstrate how subtle and easily achievable variations in the energy levels of metal–organic ETLs are crucial for device operation. We report the use of a series of SAMs, SAM1-Ru, SAM2-Os, and SAM3-Fe, which are based on three isostructural metal–polypyridyl complexes (1-Ru, 2-Os, and 3-Fe; Fig. S1, ESI†), as ETLs for inverted OPVs (Fig. 1). The energetics of these SAMs can be varied systematically by changing the metal center, while retaining the structural properties of the ETL. Moreover, the excellent stability of the complexes under different processing conditions, the facile monolayer deposition methodology, and the homogeneous and smooth monolayer surface (The roughness of the three monolayers is Rrms = 0.2–0.3 nm, as measured by AFM) make these ETLs excellent candidates for inverted BHJ OPVs.15,37 Keeping in mind the well-known importance of energy level matching across the cell, our fundamental approach shows that the energetic alignment of the ETL with other cell components determines the performance parameters of these devices.

Results and discussion
The SAMs are fabricated by covalently anchoring the metal complexes (1-Ru, 2-Os, and 3-Fe) upon heating functionalized ITO substrates in precursor solutions (Fig. 1a). The resulting SAMs were characterized by UV/Vis spectroscopy, ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The optical spectra of the SAMs on optically transparent ITO/glass substrates exhibit distinct metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands (λ = 420–820 nm; Fig. 2a). The surface coverage according to the optical data was found to be ∼1.3 molecules per nm2 for all three SAMs (ESI†). The SAM thickness is independent of the metal center and was found to be ∼2.0 nm as determined by ellipsometry. CV measurements of SAM-coated ITO substrates revealed reversible oxidations for all metal complexes (Fig. S2, ESI†) according to which, combined with the optical data, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the SAMs were estimated to be −5.6 eV and −3.8 eV for SAM1-Ru, −5.2 eV and −3.7 eV for SAM2-Os, and −5.4 eV and −3.6 eV for SAM3-Fe, respectively (ESI† and Table 1).15,38

Fig. 2b displays the results of the UPS measurements on the three SAMs and the corresponding bare ITO substrate. These spectra reveal a reduction in the WF from 4.77 eV for bare ITO to 4.38 eV (SAM1-Ru), 4.56 eV (SAM2-Os), and 4.41 eV (SAM3-Fe), as calculated from the photoemission onset.17,21
The SAMs were incorporated into three types of inverted OPV cells with the following photoactive blends to demonstrate the interlayer function (Fig. 1b): (i) P3HT:[60]PCBM, (ii) P3HT:ICBA, and (iii) PTB7:[70]PCBM. BHJ OPVs were fabricated by spin-coating a solution of P3HT:[60]PCBM (15:12 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene + 4% (vol.) 1-chloronaphthalene, 1000 rpm), P3HT:ICBA (20:20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene + 4% (vol.) 1-chloronaphthalene, 800 rpm), and PTB7:[70]PCBM (10:15 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene + 3% (vol.) 1,8-diiodooctane, 800 rpm) onto ITO/SAM. The photoactive layer thicknesses are ∼130 nm (blend i), ∼210 nm (blend ii), and ∼100 nm (blend iii). Next, the substrates that contain P3HT:[60]PCBM and P3HT:ICBA as the photoactive blends were annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min under nitrogen. Subsequently, 8 nm of the hole-transporting layer (HTL; MoO3) and 120 nm of the metal anode (Ag) were vacuum-evaporated to complete the devices. Each device type offers a unique combination of energy level arrangement. Fig. 1a schematically shows the details of the device structure and Fig. 3 shows the energy levels of the ITO cathode, the different ETLs, the donor and the acceptor materials, MoO3, and the Ag anode. The metal complexes (1-Ru, 2-Os, or 3-Fe) are well-matched in LUMO energies with the acceptor materials ([60]PCBM, ICBA, and [70]PCBM), as are the HOMO energy barriers with the donor materials (P3HT and PTB7), making them good candidates to transport electrons and to block holes on the ITO side. Fig. 3 shows representative J–V measurements of the OPV cells i–iii with SAMs based on the metal complexes (SAM1-Ru, SAM2-Os, and SAM3-Fe), as well as bare ITO control devices. Fig. 4 and Fig. S3 (ESI†) show the corresponding dark currents and external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots. OPV performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. We observed a clear dependence of the cell performance on the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and on the WFs of the SAMs. SAM1-Ru has the lowest-lying HOMO and LUMO and the lowest WF, making it the most suitable electron transporting and hole-blocking layer with all three photoactive blends (PCE = 2.8%, 4.0%, and 5.3% with blends i, ii, and iii, respectively). SAM2-Os has a lower LUMO level compared with SAM3-Fe, but at the same time, a higher HOMO level and WF. The combination of these SAMs with different donor and acceptor materials determines the final cell performance efficiency. Thus, for blend i, the LUMO levels of the SAMs have the highest effect on the obtained performance parameters (Fig. 3a). The LUMO effect is reflected by the higher fill factor of the SAM1-Ru-based cell (FF = 55.0%) compared with the other two SAM-based cells (FF = 52.4% and 48.0% for SAM2-Os and SAM3-Fe, respectively). The resulting PCE values (2.8%, 2.6%, and 2.3% for SAM1-Ru-, SAM2-Os- and SAM3-Fe-based cells, respectively) follow the same trend and increase with the decrease in the LUMO levels of the SAMs. A similar trend is observed with blend ii (Fig. 3b), in which the FF of cells containing SAM2-Os (45.9%) is higher than in the case of SAM3-Fe (41.2%), resulting in higher PCE with the former (2.7% vs. 2.5% for SAM2-Os and SAM3-Fe, respectively). The relative difference in the PCE values between SAM2-Os and SAM3-Fe is smaller with blend ii compared with blend i. This effect can be attributed to the lower HOMO level of SAM3-Fe compared with SAM2-Os, which enhances the hole-blocking ability of the former. The HOMO levels of the ETLs have a higher impact in this case due to the change in the HOMO level of the acceptor, while all other energy levels remain unchanged, when switching the photoactive blend from i to ii (−6.0 eV, −5.8 eV). The third cell type exhibits significantly higher performance parameters compared with the other cells (Fig. 3c and Table 2), as expected from replacing the photoactive layer with the PTB7:[70]PCBM mixture (blend iii).3 The SAM1-Ru-based cell exhibits the highest performance parameters (Jsc = 13.82 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.70 V, FF = 55.1%, and PCE = 5.3%). However, the energetics of blend iii result in SAM2-Os and SAM3-Fe showing similar efficiency (PCE = 4.3% and 4.4%, respectively) despite the lower LUMO of SAM2-Os, due to the higher Jsc (14.83 mA cm−2 vs. 13.48 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.62 V vs. 0.61 V) of SAM3-Fe compared with SAM2-Os. This effect can be attributed to the lower-lying HOMO and the lower WF of SAM3-Fe compared with SAM2-Os: since the PTB7 donor has a lower HOMO compared to P3HT, the HOMO level and the WF of the ETL play a more significant role when considering charge carrier selectivity.

Using the three different SAMs, we were able to control and adjust the series and the shunt resistance of the OPV cells (Table 2). The dark J–V curves of the inverted OPV cells, based on a bare ITO substrate (Fig. S3, ESI†), exhibit low current in the forward direction and a high leakage current in the reverse direction due to the high series resistance (Rseries = 5.87 Ω cm2, 31.76 Ω cm2, and 3.70 Ω cm2 with blends i, ii, and iii, respectively) and the low shunt resistance (Rshunt = 3.0 × 102 Ω cm2, 1.1 × 102 Ω cm2, and 4.2 × 101 Ω cm2 with blends i, ii, and iii, respectively). As expected, ITO alone cannot extract electrons and block holes, and the bare-ITO-based OPVs perform poorly (PCE = 0.1–0.3% with all three blends). Using the SAMs as ETLs, the electron selectivity of the bottom contact improves significantly. In all cases, Rseries, which is measured at 2.0 V of dark current and is attributed to the bulk conductivity of each of the functional layers and the contact resistance between them, is directly proportional to the LUMO level of the SAM: (1) blend i: 1.76 Ω cm2 and 2.72 Ω cm2 for cells with SAM1-Ru (lowest-lying LUMO) and SAM3-Fe (highest-lying LUMO), respectively; (2) blend ii: 11.54 Ω cm2 (SAM1-Ru) and 51.58 Ω cm2 (SAM3-Fe); (3) blend iii: 3.75 Ω cm2 (SAM1-Ru) and 6.64 Ω cm2 (SAM3-Fe). The Rseries values of cells that contain SAM2-Os fall in between the two extremes for all photoactive blends. However, the shunt resistance, which is measured at 0 V of dark current, does not follow a particular trend but is significantly increased compared with an unmodified ITO. High shunt resistances suggest that our SAMs efficiently suppress leakage currents.
Conclusions
In conclusion, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) comprising metal complexes can be used as energetically tunable electron transporting layers (ETLs) for fabricating inverted OPVs. In this fundamental study of the properties of ETLs, we have developed a methodology, which is based on the use of coordination complexes. The rational energy level tuning can be applied to various types of OPV cells. Our results show that the device performance strongly depends on the metal center, the photoactive blend, and their combination. Our approach is demonstrated by using three isostructural metal–polypyridyl complexes consisting of the iron–ruthenium–osmium triad as the ETLs with different combinations of photoactive layers. Subtle changes in the energetics of the SAMs are enabled by changing the metal center, and have a pronounced effect on the OPV cell performance. With the P3HT:[60]PCBM and the P3HT:ICBA blends, a clear connection between the ETL LUMO and the cells’ efficiency is observed. However, using the PTB7:[70]PCBM blend, both LUMO and HOMO energies and the work function of the ETL play a role. These results provide insights for further device optimization and show that the device efficiency can be controlled by tuning the energy levels of the ETLs with regard to other cell components using different metal centers in a series of polypyridyl complexes.
