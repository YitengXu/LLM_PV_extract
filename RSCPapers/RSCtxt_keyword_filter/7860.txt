    , Accepted 15th October 2019First published on 15th October 2019AbstractThe introduction of a third component into the binary system to construct a ternary architecture is widely applied to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a small molecule donor, SM1, was introduced into the PM6:Y6 binary system where a high PCE of up to 16.55% was achieved after the addition of 15 wt% of SM1 in the donors with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.831 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.7 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 77.5%, which was much higher than that of the PM6:Y6 binary systems (15.75%), presenting a Voc of 0.845 V, a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.7%. The introduction of SM1 improved the charge extraction, exciton dissociation, and blend of the morphology while effectively reducing bimolecular recombination. As a result, the Jsc and FF of the ternary devices greatly improved. This study presents an effective method to improve the PCE by adopting a ternary strategy, while at the same time, promoting a simple fabrication technology.
Introduction
The solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have become an indispensable part in renewable energy. In addition, the OSCs have many advantages, such as lightweightness, flexibility and the potential for a large-area roll-to-roll production.1–9 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is an important parameter for evaluating the performance of the OSCs. Recently, the PCEs of the single junction OSCs were developed to over 16% and the tandem OSCs were developed to over 17%.10,11 The BHJ of OSCs were often very thin to realize the effective charge collection efficiency. The thin BHJ films meant that limited lights were absorbed, particularly those that were away from the absorption peaks.6,12,13 In recent years, the development of narrow-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors such as Y6 have extended the absorption to the near infrared region.14 Blending non-fullerene acceptors with wide-bandgap donors such as PM6 have been commonly used in high-efficiency OSCs.15,16 Tandem and ternary strategies were effective in further broadening the absorption of the OSCs.4,11,13,17–21 The thickness of each active layer was fine-tuned to obtain the best performance in the tandem solar cells. Multilayer structural tandem solar cells are both expensive and complex to manufacture. Alternatively, ternary OSCs can be easily fabricated and can increase light harvesting by introducing a third component, which has complementary absorption compared with the “host” binary systems. The introduction of the third component dilutes the chromophores in the original binary system and increases its complexity so that fine regulation was made among the light absorption as well as the thicknesses of the active layer and fill factor (FF).6,20,22–24 In regard to the PM6:Y6 binary system, many groups have attempted and the PCE of the OSCs have recently increased to over 16%.3,13,25 Our group introduced a fullerene acceptor, PC71BM, into PM6:Y6 to broaden the absorption spectra and improve the morphology of the mixed film, thus improving the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and FF.13 Achievements have been made recently, which proved that the ternary strategy was a promising and efficient strategy to achieve high-efficiency OSCs.
The ternary strategy increased light harvesting, improved nano-morphology,26 and enhanced the charge mobilities, thus improving the open-circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc, and FF.4,19,20,27,28 The energy transfer model, charge transfer model, alloy model, and parallel-like model were employed to better understand and design the ternary solar cells.4 The absorption spectra of the donor and the emission spectra of the acceptor should overlap in the energy transfer model. Energy is transmitted to the acceptor chromophore by the excited donor chromophore via non-radiative dipole–dipole coupling.29,30 The third component is often located in the interface for the effective charge transfer to occur, and typically, Voc is dominated by the HOMOs of the two donors, thus the energy level of the third component needs to be carefully selected.6,31,32 In a parallel-like model, each sub-cell operates independently and the voltage of the ternary cell is between the two binary cells. In addition, this model can generate more D–A interfaces to provide more channels for charge transfer.33 In the alloy model, the third component can be tightly combined with the host component by electronic coupling, thus forming a new state called an alloy donor or alloy acceptor.34,35 This can regulate the level of the donor or acceptor, thus improving the morphology of the active layer and promoting phase separation.30
In this study, a ternary system was constructed by introducing a small molecule donor, SM1,36 into the PM6:Y6-based binary system. The best PCE of 16.55% was achieved with a Voc of 0.831 V, a Jsc of 25.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.5%, after incorporating 15 wt% of SM1 into the matrix. The PM6:Y6 binary OSCs exhibited a PCE of 15.75% with a Voc of 0.845 V, a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.7%. Although PM6 and SM1 showed a similar optical band gap, the similar structures ensured a good compatibility between them and that the main morphology of the PM6:Y6 binary systems would not change. In addition, the highly ordered intermolecular stacking of SM1 improved the morphology and the domain size without sacrificing the high charge transfer performance of the polymer.20,37 The improvement in the Jsc and FF were attributed to the effective exciton dissociation and charge extraction, lower bimolecular recombination, and optimized morphology. An alloy donor was formed and an energy transfer occurred between SM1 and PM6. The results proved that constructing ternary systems by introducing the small molecular donor was an effective way to further improving the PCE of the OSCs.
Experimental
The structure of the devices was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al. PM6, Y6, and SM1 were dissolved in chloroform (CF). The total concentration was kept constant at 16 mg mL−1 and a D:A ratio of 1:1.2. 1-Chloronaphthalene (CN) (0.5%, v/v) was added into the solution before spin-coating. PDINO was dissolved in methanol. The ITO was sequentially washed with soapy water, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. Then, the ITO was treated by UV-ozone for 25 min before use. PEDOT:PSS was spin-casted onto the ITO at 3000 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 130 °C for 20 min. Then, the substrates were moved to a glovebox filled with nitrogen. The active layer was spin-casted at 2500 rpm for 30 s and baked at 110 °C for 10 min. PDINO was then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s to achieve a thickness of ∼5 nm. An Al electrode (∼100 nm) was deposited under a vacuum pressure of ∼5 × 10−3 mbar.
Results and discussions

Fig. 1(a) shows the chemical structure of PM6, Y6 and SM1. As presented, PM6 and SM1 demonstrated a similar backbone, which ensured a good compatibility between the donors. Fig. 1(b) shows the normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the pure films. PM6 and SM1 displayed a strong absorption range between 500–650 nm and the absorption of SM1 had a blue-shift compared with PM6, which broadened the absorption spectrum. Y6 showed an intense absorption range of 600–1000 nm. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the blended films were further investigated, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The intensity of the absorption peaks increased in the short wavelength region with the increase in the SM1 content owing to the intense absorption of SM1 in 200–600 nm. The energy levels of PM6, Y6, and SM1 are shown in Fig. 1(d) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was applied to measure the onset oxidation and reduction potential, as demonstrated in Fig. S1.† SM1 exhibited a higher HOMO of −5.25 eV more than that of PM6 with −5.50 eV, which might have increased the HOMO of the donors and affected the Voc of the OSCs.

The J–V curves of the PM6:SM1:Y6-based systems with a different SM1 content are illustrated in Fig. 2(a) and the detailed photovoltaic properties of the OSCs are shown in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the PM6:Y6 binary device exhibited a PCE of 15.75% with a Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.845 V, 25.3 mA cm−2, and 73.7%, respectively. It was found that the Jsc and FF were improved due to the decrease in the Voc with the introduction of SM1. By introducing a 15% SM1 content in the blends, the best PCE of 16.55% was achieved for the ternary devices with a Voc of 0.831 V, Jsc of 25.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 77.5%. The J–V curves and EQE spectrum of the optimal OSCs are shown in Fig. S2.† The histograms of the PCEs and the stabilities of the binary and optimum ternary OSCs are shown in Fig. S3 and S4,† respectively. The Voc, Jsc and FF decreased as the SM1 content increased. The SM1:Y6 binary device showed the worst performance with a PCE of 5.18%, a Voc of 0.714 V, a Jsc of 18.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 39.8%.

To better understand the influence of the SM1 content on the improved OSC performance, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) were surveyed and shown in Fig. 2(b). When the SM1 content in the donors was 0, 15, and 100 wt%, the integral current measured from the EQE test was 23.76, 24.44, and 20.37 mA cm−2, respectively, corresponding to the Jsc measured from the I–V test. Compared to the binary device, the EQE values for the ternary devices showed an enhancement in the 500–600 nm region as the SM1 content increased to 20 wt%. This explained that the small addition of SM1 might have resulted in more photon harvesting and facilitating the exciton dissociation between PM6 and Y6. However, as the SM1 content continued to increase, the EQE values began to decrease, indicating an inefficient exciton dissociation despite the increase in photon harvesting by the addition of SM1.
The photogenerated current (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) were employed to study the exciton dissociation and charge extraction process.22Jph is defined as Jlight − Jdark, Jlight is the current density tested under standard illumination, and Jdark is the current density tested in dark. Veff is defined as V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the compensation voltage when Jph(V0) = 0 and Vbias is the applied voltage. P(E,T) represents the charge collection ability of the devices and is given by the following equation: P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat(1)where Jsat is the value when Veff ≥ 2 V. Fig. 3(a) shows the Jphversus Veff curve when the SM1 content in the donor was 0, 15 and 100 wt%. The calculated Jsat values for a 0, 15, and 100 SM1 wt% were 25.9, 25.8, and 19.5 mA cm−2 and the corresponding P(E,T) values were 0.976, 0.996, and 0.934. The higher value for the P(E,T) tested in the optimal ternary OSCs indicated a more effective exciton dissociation and charge extraction, which created more channels in the D/A interfaces and thus improving the Jsc.

The recombination mechanism for the devices related to the dependence of Voc and Jsc on the light intensity (Plight) were measured and plotted in Fig. 3(b and c). The relationship between Jsc and Plight was given by the formula: Jsc ∝ PlightS, where the bimolecular recombination appeared to be lower when the S value was closer to 1.20,38–40 As shown in Fig. 3(b), the calculated S for the PM6:Y6 and SM1:Y6 binary films was 0.994 and 0.879, respectively, while the optimal ternary film demonstrated the highest S of 0.998. Therefore, the bimolecular recombination was reduced by introducing SM1 and this was also consistent with the trends for the FFs shown in Table 1. The trap recombination was estimated by the ideality factor, , where q is the elementary charge and k is the Boltzmann constant. A ideality factor, nid,d, closer to 1 represented a more ideal recombination and when the value was higher, it meant that more trap-assisted recombination occurred. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the calculated nid,d for the binary films of PM6:Y6 was 1.131, and the value dropped to 1.041 after adding a 15 wt% of SM1 into the donors. This result indicated that the introduction of SM1 into PM6:Y6 binary-based systems produced a more ideal recombination, which was consistent with the Jscversus the light intensity result. The SM1:Y6 binary system displayed the highest nid,d of 1.141, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination in this system was very serious. Therefore, the device showed the worst photovoltaic performance. In addition, as shown in Fig. S5,† a space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to measure the hole and electron mobilities of the PM6:SM1:Y6 systems with a different content of SM1. The hole and electron mobilities were relatively balanced by introducing 15 wt% of SM1.
To further investigate the function for the third component in the PM6:SM1:Y6 ternary devices, the change in Voc was measured by increasing the SM1 content, and the result is shown in Fig. 4(a). The voltage decreased linearly with the increase in the SM1 content. Voc decreased as the holes were most likely transferred to the higher HOMO energy levels because the HOMO of the donors was increased by the addition of SM1. The linear variation in the voltage with the SM1 content and the good compatibility of SM1 and PM6 indicated that the two donors might have preferred to form an alloy donor.30 The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure and blended films of the two donors, SM1 and PM6, were measured under 550 nm of light excitation, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Obviously, the neat SM1 film showed a strong PL emission intensity at 675 nm and PM6 showed a weak PL emission intensity at 665 nm. After introducing a 20 wt% of SM1, the PL emission intensity almost quenched to one-tenth of its original intensity, indicating that an energy transfer existed from SM1 to PM6.30 As the SM1 content continued to increase, the PL emission intensity slightly enhanced. In addition, the energy transfer was well-supported by the overlap in the emission spectra of SM1 and the absorption spectra of PM6,4 as shown in Fig. S6.†

A grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization was performed to investigate the molecular stacking and orientation of the blended films. Fig. 5(a–c) shows the 2D diffraction pattern and Fig. 5(d) shows the line-cut profiles along the in plane (IP) and out of plane (OOP) direction of the binary and ternary films. The diffraction pattern and line-cut profiles of pure Y6 and SM1 are shown in Fig. S7.†Fig. 5(a) was obtained from our previous work for13 PM6:Y6 binary based systems where there were (100) peaks along qxy = 0.299 Å−1 (d = 20.99 Å) in the lamellar diffractions and π–π stacking diffractions along qz = 1.76 Å−1 (d = 3.57 Å). This meant that the binary blended films had a preference for a face-on orientation. A similar but stronger diffraction pattern was observed by introducing a 15 wt% of SM1 into the PM6:Y6 binary based systems, thus suggesting that the more ordered orientation was formed in the ternary systems. In the SM1:Y6 binary based film, the diffraction patterns appeared as an arc, which indicated that the aggregation of the molecules tended to be isotropic. The following equation was used to calculate the coherence length (Lc) to study the crystallinity of the blended films: Lc = 2πk/fwhm(2)where k is the shape factor and fwhm is the half-width at the diffraction peak. The calculated Lc of PM6:Y6 and PM6:SM1:Y6 (containing 15 wt% of SM1 in donors) systems were 1.628 and 1.773 nm. The increased Lc in the ternary OSCs corresponded to a higher crystallinity and indicated a better phase separation,22 which was favorable for charge dissociation and transport. Meanwhile, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to investigate the surface morphology of the binary and optimized ternary blend films as shown in Fig. 5(e–g). Detailed AFM images of PM6:SM1:Y6 with different SM1 content were exhibited in Fig. S8.† According to Fig. 5(e), the binary PM6:Y6 blend film demonstrated an excellent interpenetrating network morphology that was accompanied by a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.20 nm, thus ensuring its effective charge transport. With the introduction of the small SM1 molecular donor (15 wt%), the morphology of the ternary blend films did not change significantly as evidenced by the similar roughness of around 1.05 nm, thus indicating a good compatibility between the two donors. The nanomorphology was transformed when the SM1 content was increased to over 50 wt%, where the RMS roughness was consequently increased to over 2 nm. This was related to the strong crystallinity of small molecular SM1, and thus, might have negatively affected the charge transfer capability and device performance.

Conclusion
In summary, the performance of the ternary OSCs was well optimized by introducing the small molecular donor, SM1. A PCE of 16.55% with a Voc of 0.831 V, a Jsc of 25.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.5% were achieved by introducing 15 wt% of SM1 into the PM6:Y6 blends. The binary systems demonstrated a PCE of 15.75%, a Voc of 0.845 V, a Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.7%. The Jsc and FF were improved due to an efficient charge extraction, efficient exciton dissociation, lower bimolecular recombination, and optimized morphology. In addition, an alloy donor was formed between the two acceptors, and an energy transfer occurred from SM1 to PM6, which accelerated the efficient charge transfer processes. The results revealed that the ternary strategy was an effective method for further improving the performance of the OSCs.
