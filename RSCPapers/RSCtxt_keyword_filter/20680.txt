    , Accepted 26th October 2015First published on 29th October 2015AbstractThe power conversion efficiency of metal-free organic dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is now comparable to ruthenium-based polypyridyl and zinc-based porphyrin dyes. We have computationally investigated the structural, electronic and optical properties of a series of metal free organic dyes and their corresponding silicon substituted dyes. The DFT and TD-DFT calculations revealed that silicon substituted organic dyes have higher efficiency than the corresponding silicon free organic dyes. The computational results showed that the presence of silole units as a spacer group can significantly affect the performance of DSSCs compared to typically using thiophene as a spacer unit. These results corroborate the experimental observations reported in the literature. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations performed at the CPCM–CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory showed better agreement with the experimental absorption spectra of some reported metal free organic dyes having silole in the spacer group compared to other functionals and are employed in this study. Indoline donor based dye 5 showed a much shorter absorption spectrum (absorption peak at 425 nm) and smaller electron injection driving force (ΔGinjection = −1.77 eV) than the corresponding dye 8 containing silicon substituted indoline as a donor and a silole group as a spacer unit. λmax = 502 nm and ΔGinjection = −1.82 eV calculated for dye 8 are much larger than the corresponding silicon free dye 5. The silicon based dye 8 helps in achieving a much lower ΔGregeneration value than 5, which can facilitate the faster electron injection rate from the dye to the semiconductor TiO2. Dye 8 should also have a higher Voc value compared to other dyes (5–7) due to favourable interaction with the electrolyte (I−/I3−). The higher planarity and better conjugation in dye 8 facilitate the transfer of electrons from the dye molecules to the semiconductor TiO2. The calculations performed with phenyl protecting groups near the silicon center of the dye molecule 8 to diminish the dimerization process showed very similar optical properties as obtained with the corresponding unprotected dye system. The designed julolidine and pyrrolo-indolizine donor based dyes also showed a similar trend as observed for indoline donor based dyes.
1. Introduction
The design and realizations of metal-free organic sensitizers are of current interest for their application in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The performance and stability of DSSCs have shown great improvements since the pioneering work of O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991.1 Although an inorganic solar cell still dominates the photovoltaic field, its application in technologies is limited due to higher cost or hazardous materials involved in the process.2–7 Ruthenium and zinc complexes have been demonstrated as important materials for photovoltaic applications.8–19 Due to higher cost, low synthetic yield, tedious synthetic procedures, purification protocols and a resource restriction of the noble metal ruthenium, considerable efforts have been made for the development of metal-free organic sensitizers in recent years.20–23 The design and synthesis of a large number of metal-free organic dyes have drawn widespread academic and commercial attention mainly because of the abundance of raw materials, low cost, flexibility of molecular design and higher molar extinction coefficients. Several organic molecules such as triphenylamine, indoline, coumarin, cyanine, perylene, carbazole etc. have been used as donor groups in D–π–A metal-free organic dyes.24–30 The efficiency of a D–π–A system is significantly improved by lowering the E0–0 energy-gap.31E0–0 is the electronic vertical transition energy corresponding to λmax. Efficient electron injection and dye regeneration which are important parameters for efficient dyes are influenced by the energy location of the ground state oxidation potential (S+/0) and the excited state oxidation potential (S+/*).32 Thus, the aforementioned parameters are important for the design of efficient organic dyes. A few metal-free organic dyes have shown comparable efficiency for metal-coordinated dyes in DSSCs.33–35
Recently, silicon based dyes have shown promise for solar cells due to their ability to tune HOMO–LUMO energy levels and excellent stability.36 The silole unit in polymers and copolymers has been investigated for organic photovoltaics, such as organic field-effect transistors.37 However, silicon based dyes have not been investigated extensively for the design of organic sensitizers for the application of DSSCs. In this article, we have examined the effect of silicon substitution on the cell performance of a series of metal-free organic dyes having a D–π–A structure. The silicon substituted indoline, julolidine and pyrrolo-indolizine donor based organic dyes (containing silabenzene and silole as spacer groups) have shown promise in enhancing the cell performance compared to silicon-free organic dye molecules.
2. Computational details
The overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a solar cell can be calculated from eqn (1). (1)
Here, Voc is the open-circuit photovoltage, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor and Pinc is the incident solar power on the cell.
The short-circuit current density Jsc in DSSCs is determined as38 (2)where LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency and it can be calculated by LHE = 1 − 10−f, f is the oscillator strength. Φinjec is the electron injection efficiency and ηcollect is the charge collection efficiency. Φinjec can be calculated through the driving force ΔGinjection (electrons injecting from the excited states of dye molecules to the semiconductor substrate) and it is the difference between the oxidation potential of the excited dye (Edye*), and the reduction potential of the CB of the semiconductor (ECB, −4.00 eV).39 ΔGinjection = Edye* − ECB(3) The excited state oxidation potential (Edye*) was estimated by40 Edye* = Edye − λmax(4)where Edye is the ground state oxidation potential of the dye and λmax is the vertical transition energy corresponding to the maximum absorption. The regeneration efficiency (ηreg) of the oxidized dye is associated with the regeneration driving force (ΔGregeneration). The dye regeneration (ΔGregeneration) is determined by the differences between the Edye and the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.58 eV).41 The Jsc value in DSSCs increases with increasing the LHE and ΔGinjection. The Jsc value also increases with decreasing ΔGregeneration value.
The Voc in DSSCs can be described by38 (5)where, q is the unit charge, Ec is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor substrate, kT is the thermal energy, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band, NCB is the density of accessible states in the conduction band, and Eredox is the reduction–oxidation potential of the electrolyte. ΔCB is the shift of the conduction band when the dyes are on the semiconductor.42
The ground-state geometries were fully optimized using the DFT functional i.e., the B3LYP and 6-31G* basis set for C, H, O, N, S atoms, whereas the effective core potential (ECP) LANL2DZ basis set for Ti.43–45 Positive vibrational frequencies confirmed that the optimized structures have the lowest energy. We have optimized different conformers of the dyes and performed our further calculations with the most stable conformer (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Earlier studies proved that this method could provide a reasonable geometry with a much lesser computational cost which is comparable to the MP2 optimized geometry.46 The absorption spectra of dyes were obtained by single-point of the optimized ground-state geometries in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at CPCM–CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* and CPCM–M06-2×/6-31+G* levels of theory.47–49 THF has been used as a solvent in this study because most of the absorption spectra of silole containing dyes are reported in this solvent.50 Here we have considered 30 lowest singlet–singlet excitations. The oxidation potential of the dyes were calculated at the CPCM-B3LYP/UB3LYP/6-311G** level of theory of the neutral and cationic dyes. The dipole moment of the TiO2 bound dyes were calculated at the CPCM-B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. We have calculated the μnormal of the studied dyes adsorbed onto the (TiO2)6 cluster. The semiconductor surface is parallel to the yz plane and the dipole moment of the dyes along the x-axis is considered as μnormal. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09.51
3. Results and discussion
To identify a reliable DFT functional to predict the photophysical properties of dyes with silole systems, we have examined D–π–A pattern organic dyes containing a dithienosilole unit as a π-spacer unit (Fig. 1). The organic dyes 3-(6-(1-(2-(carbazol-9-yl)-thiophen-5-yl)-ethynyl)-4,4-dioctyl-dithieo[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole-2-yl-)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (CTDTSCA, dye 1), 2-cyano-3-{5′-{2-{4-[N,N-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-phenyl)amino]phenyl}-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-5-yl}-3,3′-din-hexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene-5-yl}acrylic acid (C219, dye 2), TP6CADTS (dye 3) and TPCADTS (dye 4) have been optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory and the absorption spectra of these molecules were computed using TDDFT calculations.50,52 Five different exchange–correlation functionals, including four hybrid functionals (B3LYP, HSEPBE, M062X and BHandHLYP) and one long range corrected functional (CAM-B3LYP) with the 6-31+G* basis set were employed to calculate the vertical transition energies.45 The experimental maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of the reported dyes 1–4 (Fig. 1) and the calculated absorption wavelength (λmax) are given in Table 1.50,52 The calculated results suggest that M062X and CAM-B3LYP showed in general better agreement with the experimental results compared to other DFT functionals employed for these systems. These DFT functionals are reasonable to predict the absorption spectra λmax of these organic dye molecules, however, they slightly overestimate the calculated values. We have considered the CAM-B3LYP functional to calculate the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the designed dyes in this study as this method has been extensively employed to calculate the vertical transition energies of D–π–A dye molecules.53 Nonetheless, we have also reported λmax at the M06-2X/6-31+G* level of theory of the designed dyes for reasonable agreement with the experimental results of the reference dye molecules (Table S1, ESI†).

A few reports using a silole unit as a π-spacer in the D–π–A dye system has shown promise in enhancing the efficiency of DSSCs.37 The silole spacer unit can possibly help in achieving planarity in the D–π–A dye, which could subsequently facilitate the electron transfer to the semiconductor.37 However, the use of silicon containing dyes have not received much attention despite its improved performance. In this article, we have designed a series of metal-free organic dyes possessing silicon in the donor/spacer units and compared the results with the corresponding silicon free dyes. The silicon free donor groups indoline and julolidines have been considered because of their better efficiency as donor groups in organic dyes.54–61 Even though pyrrolo-indolizine has been reported earlier, this group has been exploited computationally as a donor group for the first time.62 The typical π-spacers fluorenes and thiophene have been chosen and modified in the study.63–68
Indoline, julolidine and pyrrolo-indolizine as donor groups with fluorenes and thiophene as π-spacer units in dye molecules have been examined (dyes 5, 9 and 13, Fig. 2) computationally. The calculated results of these systems have been treated as reference for the corresponding designed dye molecules containing silabenzene as part of donor groups (dyes 6, 10 and 14) and silole spacer groups (dyes 7, 11 and 15, Fig. 2). Finally the dyes 8, 12 and 16 (Fig. 2) were designed where Si was present in both donor and spacer units. The substitution of a thiophene spacer group with a silole group is known; however, a silicon containing donor group has not reported. The synthesis and isolation of a neutral silaaromatic compound that is stable at ambient temperature were dampened by the high reactivity of SiC double bonds. However, silabenzene was prepared and found to be stable in THF/Et2O/petroleum ether (4/1/1) solutions at −100 °C.69 Further efforts in this direction led to the synthesis and characterization of the first neutral silaaromatic species that is stable at ambient temperature, a 2 silanaphthalene, by taking advantage of an efficient steric protection group, the 2,4,6-tris[bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl] phenyl (Tbt) group.70 The synthesis of stable 1-Tbt-silabenzene was reported, and its structure was determined as a single crystal X-ray structure, which revealed that silabenzene is planar.71
 Fig. 2  Molecular structures of the studied dyes 5–16. 
It is well known that in n-type DSSCs, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the dyes should be lower than the redox potential. The value is −4.80 eV in the case of the I−/I3− redox couple.72 This ensures avoiding charge recombination between photoinjected electrons in TiO2 and oxidized dye sensitizers.73 Moreover, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level must be above the conduction band of TiO2 (ECB, −4.00 eV)39 to inject electrons effectively. The frontier molecular orbital energies of the dyes (5–8) are shown in Fig. 3. The HOMO energy of dye 5 is −6.34 eV, which is below the valance band of TiO2. The LUMO energy value is −1.92 eV and it ensures the regeneration of the dye. Dye 6 containing silicon substituted indoline as a donor group showed a remarkable change in the molecular structure compared to the silicon free dye 5.
 Fig. 3  Frontier molecular energy level diagrams of dyes 5–8. 
The longer Si–C bond helps in diminishing the steric repulsion between hydrogen atoms of the donor/spacer groups and attaining planarity (Fig. 2). Such changes in the molecular structure of dye 6 resulted in higher conjugation and planarity compared to dye 5. The planarity is reflected from the dihedral angle (θ) between the donor group and the rest of the dye molecule. The dihedral angle (θ1) of reference compound 5 is found to be −145.08° which is much smaller compared to 6 (−178.23°) (Scheme 1). The conjugation is also reflected from the lower HOMO–LUMO energy gap of dye 6 (3.68 eV) compared to 5 (4.42 eV). In the case of dye 7, the thiophene group is replaced by the silole group and the indoline ring is taken as the donor group (Fig. 2). This change in dye 7 reduced the steric repulsion between the hydrogen atom of fluorene and silole that consequently helped in achieving planarity in the system. This arrangement also leads to a lower HLG value (4.18 eV) of 7 compared to 5. This study has been extended with dye 8, where the donor and spacer groups contain silicon substituted indoline and silole groups, respectively. The HLG value is lowest in the case of 8 (3.43 eV) compared to dyes 5–7. The geometrical analysis of dye 8 suggests that it achieved better planarity than reference dye 5. The higher dihedral angles θ1 (179.51°) and θ2 (173.44°) of dye 8 than dye 5 (θ1 = −145.08° & θ2 = 156.88°) help attaining more planarity in the system. The HOMO–LUMO energies of dyes 5–8 indicated that both the silicon substituted indoline and silole groups reduce the HLG but it is lowest for compound 8 which contains silicon containing donor and silole spacer groups. The HOMOs are situated below the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.80 eV) and the LUMOs of all dyes are located over the conduction band of the TiO2 surface (ECB, −4.00 eV) (Fig. 3). These favourable energy bands facilitate the electron injection from dye to the TiO2 surface.

1 and θ2 (in green color) are the dihedral angles between the donor and the spacer unit as well as the spacer and the spacer unit, respectively of D–π–A systems (where D = donor group, X = S or SiH2 and A = acceptor group). 
We have also examined the influence of silicon substitution on the electronic properties of other studied systems, i.e., julolidine based donor dyes 9–12 and pyrrolo-indolizine based dyes 13–16 (Fig. 2). Dye 12 containing silabenzene in julolidine as a donor group and a silole unit in the spacer showed lower HLG than other dyes (9–11) in the series due to higher planarity (Fig. S3, ESI†). The larger dihedral angles of dye 12 (θ1 = −178.23° & θ2 = −171.82°) than the silicon free dye 9 (θ1 = −144.78° & θ2 = −156.22°) aids in attaining higher planarity in the former dye molecule. The pyrrolo–indolizine system has also been explored in dye molecules for DSSC performance. Similar to 12, dye 16 with silicon in both donor and spacer groups showed better planarity (θ1 = −178.47° & θ2 = −172.18°) than the silicon free dye 13, which helps in achieving effective conjugation and a lower HLG value (Fig. S4, ESI†). The calculated results reveal that the presence of the Si system in the dye molecules can significantly improve the electronic properties compared to the corresponding silicon free dyes.
The calculated frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) suggest that in the HOMO the orbital contribution is mainly on the donor and spacer groups and the LUMO mainly resides on the anchoring and spacer groups (Fig. S5, ESI†). Such FMOs can show a strong D–π–A character in the molecule which is required for the efficient electron injection from the excited dye to TiO2.
The electron injection process from the excited dye to TiO2 can be examined by TDDFT calculations for the studied dyes. These calculations were performed in the CPCM continuum solvation model at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* level of theory. The calculated maximum absorption wavelength (λmax), oscillator strength (f) and the corresponding electronic transitions are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4. The absorption wavelength maximum for dye 6 appeared at 457 nm, which is much higher than the silicon free dye 5 (425 nm, Fig. 4). The red-shift observed in the case of 6 is due to lowering of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap with the substitution of the Si atom in the system (Fig. 3). Dye 7 showed even higher absorption maximum (486 nm) than 5 and 6. Dye 8 showed the highest absorption maximum (502 nm) in the series. Furthermore, we have calculated the absorption spectra of dyes 9–12 and 13–16 (Fig. S6, ESI†). The results followed the similar trend as obtained for 5–8 (Table 2). The calculated results suggest that λmax can be enhanced either by a silicon substituted donor group or a silole spacer group but the value will be highest for the compound which contains both silicon in donor and spacer groups. However, the higher reactivity of SiC double bonds in silabenzene is known to be a problem.71 This problem has been circumvented by protecting the silicon center with protecting groups.71 Hence, we have examined the indoline based dye 8 with phenyl as protecting groups close to the silicon center to avoid the dimerization process (Fig. S7, ESI†). The absorption wavelength maximum was found to be 501 nm similar to that of the unprotected dye 8 (Table S2, ESI†).

 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of dyes 5–8 in THF. 
DSSC performance also depends on the short-circuit current density which subsequently depends on the LHE, ΔGinjection and ΔGregeneration. The LHE, ΔGinjection and ΔGregeneration values have been calculated and shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The calculated results suggest that all the designed dyes 5–8 have very high LHE values and are largely comparable. It has been shown that for dye 6, ΔGinjection increases with respect to the reference dye 5 (Table 3). However, the LHE value is slightly lower than dye 5. Therefore, the Jsc of dye 6 may not be very efficient than dye 5. The ΔGinjection and LHE values calculated for 8 are slightly better than the reference dye 5 (Tables 2 and 3). The most important change found for dye 8 compared to dye 5 is the ΔGregeneration value. The ΔGregeneration value of dye 8 is much lower than dye 5, which facilitates the faster electron injection rate from the dye to TiO2 (Table 3). The smaller value of dye regeneration also helps in avoiding charge recombination between the photooxidized dye and the injected electron and minimize dye degradation.74 Therefore, it can be predicted that dye 8 should have better Jsc than the reference dye 5. The calculated LHE, ΔGinjection and ΔGregeneration values for dyes 9–12 and 13–16 suggest that dyes containing a silicon substituted group as a donor and silole as a spacer group should have better short-circuit current than the corresponding silicon free systems (Tables 2 and 3). The relative trend of ΔGinjection calculated using 5–8 reveals that the silicon containing donor group (6) can improve this parameter compared to the silole spacer unit present in the dye molecule (7). Dye 8 with a phenyl protecting group also showed much larger ΔGinjection as obtained for 8 (Table S2, ESI†).

As mentioned in computational methods, μnormal is related to the shift of the conduction band and that will lead to a change in Voc.75 It has been shown that the larger vertical dipole moment of the adsorbed dye pointing outward the semiconductor surface can yield to larger Voc. The calculated μnormal of the studied dyes are shown in Table 4. The calculated results suggest that the dyes containing a silicon substituted group as a donor and silole as a spacer group (dyes 8, 12 and 16) lead to larger μnormal values than the corresponding silicon free dyes (dyes 5, 9 and 13) (Table 4 and Fig. 5). Dye 8 with a phenyl protecting group also showed a larger μnormal value than the corresponding dye 5 (Table S2, ESI†).

 Fig. 5  Calculated vertical dipole moment of dyes 5-(TiO2)6 and 8-(TiO2)6 at THE CPCM-B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory in tetrahydrofuran solution. The semiconductor surface is parallel to the yz plane. 
The high Voc values also depend on the injected electron in the conduction band of the semiconductor that could recombine with the redox couple (I−/I3−) in the electrolyte and the oxidized organic dyes. It has been perceived that the higher the iodine concentration close to the TiO2 surface, the shorter the lifetime in the CB, which decreases the Voc values.76,77 We have calculated the dye⋯I2 interaction at the M06-2X/6-31G* level of theory using the LANL2DZ basis set for the I atom in the gas phase calculations. It has been reported that the nonbonding interaction of I2 with the CN bond of the anchoring group of the dye is stronger than I2⋯S interaction.76,77 Thus, we have considered only the I2⋯CN interaction in these systems. The optimized molecular structures of the dye⋯I2 complexes are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The CN⋯I2 distance for dye 8 (2.814 Å) is longer than the corresponding silicon free dye 5 (2.783 Å). The relatively long distance of the electrolyte from the anchoring of dye 8 would help in enhancing the electron lifetime in the CB, which subsequently can increase the Voc value compared to the other dye systems studied here. Similar results were also obtained for the julolidine donor based dyes (9–12) and the pyrrolo-indolizine donor based dyes (13–16) (Fig. S9, ESI†). The calculated μnormal and I2⋯CN interaction distances reveal that silicon substituted dyes should have better Voc compared to silicon free dyes.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we have performed computational experiments to design a series of metal free organic dyes containing the silicon substituted group as a donor and a silole group as a spacer unit to achieve higher efficiency of DSSCs. The silicon substituted dyes modulate the geometry to achieve higher conjugation in the system for better optical properties compared to silicon free dyes. The level of theory employed in the study has been compared with the known experimental results. The calculated absorption spectra at the CAM-B3LYP showed better agreement with the reported experimental absorption spectra of some metal free organic dyes having a silole unit in the spacer group. The designed dyes 8, 12 & 16 with a silicon substituted group as a donor and a silole group as a spacer unit showed much redshifted absorption spectra, electron injection driving force, electron regeneration energy and vertical dipole moment compared to their corresponding silicon free dyes 5, 9 & 13, respectively. The silicon substituted dye 8 showed the absorption spectrum maximum at 502 nm, whereas the silicon free dye 5 showed the absorption spectrum maximum at λmax = 425 nm. Furthermore, the factors Jsc and Voc obtained using silicon substituted dyes help in decreasing the ΔGregeneration values responsible for the fast electron injection rate into TiO2. The dye with protecting groups around the silicon centre shows similar properties obtained using the corresponding unprotected dye system. The enhancement of the optical and electronic properties was also observed for silicon based julolidine (12) and pyrrolo-indolizine (16) dyes as observed for indoline dye 8. This work is inferred to be useful for designing metal free organic dyes with excellent properties to augment the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. We will explore the importance of the N-oxide group in solar dye molecules to augment the efficiency of DSSCs.78
