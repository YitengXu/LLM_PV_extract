The efficient charge-carrier generation and collection, comparable to those of polymer/fullerene solar cells, are found to be the main reasons for the superior device performance.

Broader context
Polymer/polymer blend solar cells, consisting of polymer donors and acceptors, have numerous advantages over polymer/fullerene solar cells, including the flexible molecular design and larger scope for tuning of optical, electronic, and morphological properties of the materials. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer/polymer blend solar cells is still far less than that of polymer/fullerene solar cells mainly because of lower charge generation and collection efficiency. Herein, we report polymer/polymer blend solar cells with a PCE of 5.73%. We found both charge-carrier generation and collection efficiencies to be as high as 80%, which is comparable to those of efficient polymer/fullerene solar cells. This finding indicates that the potential of polymer/polymer blend solar cells is equivalent to that of polymer/fullerene solar cells.

Currently, the most widely studied polymer-based solar cells consist of a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure in which a conjugated polymer is mixed with a low-molecular-weight fullerene derivative. In these systems, the conjugated polymer acts as an electron donor and the fullerene derivative acts as an acceptor. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells have increased over the past two decades, and approached 9.2% in single-junction cells.1,2 This improvement is mainly because various low-bandgap donor polymers have been developed with rational molecular designs.3–7 On the other hand, polymer/polymer BHJ solar cells, which consist of a polymer donor and a polymer acceptor, have a number of potential advantages over conventional polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells. Of particular importance is the flexible molecular design of not only the donor but also the acceptor polymers, which allows for fine tuning of the optical, electronic, and morphological properties of the materials. Consequently, recent studies have been devoted to developments of polymer acceptors.8
Owing to considerable efforts in synthesizing various polymer acceptors and optimizing the blend morphology, the PCE of polymer/polymer BHJ solar cells has been steadily improving up to 2–4% in the last few years.8–19 However, these PCEs are still much lower than the efficiencies of polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells. Even in the most efficient polymer/polymer BHJ solar cells, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) is as low as 40–50%,15,16,18,19 which is far below that of polymer/fullerene solar cells (70–80%).1,3–5 Such low EQEs of polymer/polymer BHJ solar cells are generally considered to be due to poor charge-carrier generation and/or collection efficiencies,8,17,20–22 implying that polymer/polymer BHJ solar cells might be inherently inferior to polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells.
In this article, we demonstrate highly efficient donor/acceptor polymer blend solar cells with a maximum EQE of ∼60% and a PCE of 5.73%, which are the highest efficiencies reported for polymer/polymer BHJ solar cells. Based on the applied reverse (negative) voltage dependence of the photocurrent at varying incident light intensities, we found that both the charge-carrier generation and collection efficiencies were as high as 80% in this polymer blend. Our finding demonstrates that polymer/polymer solar cells have the potential to improve the device performance, making it as efficient as polymer/fullerene solar cells.
Poly{[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} [P(NDI2OD-T2); Polyera ActivInk™ N2200]23 is one of the attractive polymer acceptor alternatives to fullerenes owing to its high electron mobility, high electron affinity, and light absorption ability at near-infrared wavelengths. Among the low-bandgap polymer donors reported, of particular interest are a series of copolymers composed of alternating benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) units (denoted PBDTTTs) since they offer very high PCEs for polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells. This is because of their strong absorption in the long-wavelength region and good hole mobility on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.24–26 In particular, PBDTTTs based on the thienyl-substituted BDT units have been reported to exhibit higher hole mobilities than those based on alkoxy-substituted BDTs.27 We therefore utilized poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][2-[[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]carbonyl]-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PBDTTT-EF-T)28 as a polymer donor and N2200 as a polymer acceptor (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b, both PBDTTT-EF-T and N2200 exhibited efficient absorption at around 700 nm, where the photon flux of the solar spectrum is the highest, which is important for obtaining a large short-circuit current density (JSC). Moreover, the energy offsets both in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs, 0.8 eV) and highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs, 0.7 eV) are sufficient to promote efficient electron transfer from the photoexcited state of PBDTTT-EF-T and hole transfer from the photoexcited state of N2200, respectively (Fig. 1c).29

(c) Energy level diagram of PBDTTT-EF-T and N2200 neat films. The HOMO levels were evaluated by photoelectron yield spectroscopy, and the LUMO levels were estimated by adding the optical bandgap energy, calculated from the 0–0 transition, to the HOMO energy (ESI, Fig. S6†). 
The PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 blend was spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution onto poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate)-coated (PEDOT:PSS-coated) indium–tin–oxide (ITO) substrates. The weight fraction of PBDTTT-EF-T in the blend was 50%, and the film thickness of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 active layer was adjusted to 100 ± 10 nm. Fig. 2 shows the J–V curves and the EQE spectrum of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell with the best PCE. The photovoltaic parameters obtained were JSC = 13.0 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.794 V, FF = 0.556, and PCE = 5.73% under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. We note that the value of JSC was close to the photocurrent density calculated by integrating the EQE spectrum with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum (the error was ∼3%). An EQE value over 50% at 380 nm indicates that N2200 successfully contributes to the photocurrent generation because light absorption at wavelengths around 380 nm is mainly accomplished by N2200, as shown in Fig. 1b. More importantly, the EQE exceeded 60% in range of 620–720 nm and was still as high as 50% even at 740 nm. The broken line in Fig. 2b is the reflection absorption spectrum of a PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 blended film with a thickness of ∼100 nm, revealing that more than 90% of the incident photons are absorbed around 700 nm because of the efficient light absorption by both PBDTTT-EF-T and N2200. The efficient light absorption at the near-infrared wavelength ranges is responsible for the large JSC measured for the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell. As a result, the values for JSC, maximum EQE, and PCE are the highest reported thus far for polymer/polymer BHJ solar cells. The solar cell performances of the device are summarized in Table 1.

To address the origin of the efficient conversion of absorbed photons into the photocurrent in the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell, we first focus on the charge-carrier generation and then discuss the charge transport. Fig. 3 shows the net photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the applied reverse (negative) voltage under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Here, Jph is given by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the Jph was saturated at reverse voltages higher than −6 V, suggesting that at a reverse voltage of −6 V, the electric field within the device would be large enough to sweep out all charge carriers to the electrodes prior to recombination.30,31 In other words, all of the photogenerated charge carriers in the device are collected at reverse voltages higher than −6 V. The reverse saturation photocurrent density Jph,sat was 17 mA cm−2. On the other hand, the maximum obtainable photocurrent density (Jmax) was calculated to be ∼22 mA cm−2 from the integral of the product of the reflection absorption of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 active layer and the incident photon flux density of AM 1.5 G solar light (ESI, Fig. S2†). Therefore, the charge-carrier generation efficiency in the device can be estimated from the ratio of Jph,sat to Jmax. The Jph,sat/Jmax ratio was as high as 77%, suggesting efficient charge-carrier generation in the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell. The exciton quenching efficiency following light absorption is also estimated based on the photoluminescence (PL) quenching.18 The PL spectra of the blended films were measured by exciting the PBDTTT-EF-T component at 500 nm (excitation fraction is 78%) and the N2200 component at 400 nm (excitation fraction is 72%). The PL quenching efficiencies of PBDTTT-EF-T and N2200 were >99% and 86%, respectively, for the blended film of PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200. The efficient PL quenching of both donor and acceptor polymers is consistent with the efficient charge-carrier generation as mentioned above, suggesting that charge-carriers are generated with minimal loss of absorbed photons in the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell. Fig. 4 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographical and phase images (1 μm × 1 μm) of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 blended film: no distinct phase-separated domain structures were observed. The fine surface morphology is consistent with the efficient PL quenching of both PBDTTT-EF-T and N2200, which implies that the donor and acceptor polymers are mixed on the nanometer scale. We therefore conclude that efficient charge-carrier generation following light absorption is one of the key contributors to the large EQE observed for the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell.

The Jph values were obtained by subtracting the current density in the dark (JD) from that under illumination (JL) as Jph = JL − JD. Jph,sat and JSC represent the reverse saturation photocurrent density and short-circuit current density, respectively.

Then, we discuss charge transport under short-circuit conditions. From the ratio of JSC to Jph,sat, the charge collection efficiency was estimated to be as high as 79% under the short-circuit conditions. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5a, the charge collection efficiency (JSC/Jph,sat) was almost nondependent on the illumination intensities ranging from 0.32 to 100 mW cm−2. If charge transport under the short-circuit conditions suffers from bimolecular recombination, the increased charge-carrier density with light intensity should increase the magnitude of bimolecular recombination rates and thus decrease the JSC/Jph,sat ratio. Therefore, the nondependence of JSC/Jph,sat on illumination intensity suggests that bimolecular recombination is not dominant under the short-circuit conditions. The 21% loss in Jph might be due to geminate recombination of charge carriers. To further confirm this, we measured the illumination intensity dependence of JSC. As shown in Fig. 5b, JSC followed a power-law dependence JSC ∝ PlightS with a slope S of 0.96 for the entire range of illumination intensities (Plight). The value of the slope being close to unity is also indicative of negligible bimolecular recombination.32–36 These results demonstrate that photogenerated charge carriers in the device are efficiently transported to the electrodes prior to bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. Thus, we conclude that efficient charge collection is another key contributor to the large EQE observed for the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell. Here, we note that the loss in Jph was 42% at the maximum power point, indicating that bimolecular recombination is not negligible at the low electric fields.

(b) Incident light intensity (Plight) dependence of JSC. The data were fitted by a solid line according to JSC ∝ PlightS with a slope S of 0.96; S was given by a least-squares fit over the entire range of light intensities. 
Finally, we focus on the charge-carrier mobility in the active layer, because the charge collection efficiency is determined by the competition between carrier sweep-out, which is limited by the charge-carrier mobility, and bimolecular recombination loss. We measured the hole mobility μh and the electron mobility μe in both the neat and blended films using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the Mott–Gurney equation (ESI, Fig. S3†).37,38 The PBDTTT-EF-T neat film exhibited a hole mobility of μh = 9.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The N2200 neat film exhibited an electron mobility of μe = 4.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. In the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 blended film, μh and μe were evaluated to be 3.4 × 10−4 and 3.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The high charge-carrier mobility on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the blended film can reduce the carrier sweep-out time and hence improve the charge collection under the short-circuit conditions. In addition, the SCLC measurements show that the hole mobility of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 blended film is similar to the electron mobility. In other words, a balanced charge transport between the hole and the electron can be achieved in the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 device. A balanced charge-carrier transport is important for the improvement in FF because it would reduce the build-up of space-charges.39,40 It is known that the space-charge-limited photocurrent shows a square root power dependence on the voltage, and thus, limits the maximum FF to only 0.42.39,40 In Fig. 6, the Jph of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell was plotted against the effective applied voltage (V0 − V), where V0 is the compensation voltage at which Jph is zero. Apparently, the Jph was free from space-charge effects discriminated by Jph ∝ (V0 − V)1/2, as depicted by the broken line in Fig. 6.39,40 We therefore conclude that the high and balanced charge-carrier mobility on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 not only reduces the carrier sweep-out time under short circuit conditions, but also suppresses the build-up of space-charges in the device, leading to improvements in EQE and FF, and consequently PCE. A FF of 0.47 was obtained even for the 150 nm-thick active layer (ESI, Fig. S5†). This value is still higher than 0.42, indicating that charge carriers are collected at the electrodes without the space-charge limit even in the thick active layer.

The broken line represents the square-root dependence of the Jph on the voltage. 
In conclusion, we demonstrate that a PCE of 5.73% can be achieved even for polymer/polymer BHJ solar cells. This is mainly because the charge-carrier generation and collection efficiencies are both as high as ∼80%, which is comparable to those of efficient polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells.1,3–5,29 This finding represents that polymer/polymer solar cells are not inherently inferior to polymer/fullerene solar cells, but rather that they have great potential as an alternative to polymer/fullerene solar cells. Recently, Polyera Corporation announced achieving a PCE of 6.47%,8 demonstrating that the potential for highly efficient polymer/polymer solar cells was not confined to our donor/acceptor polymer systems but rather versatile and achievable for other combinations of donor and acceptor polymers too. As shown in Fig. 1b, both donor and acceptor polymers used in this study have a large absorption band from 550 to 800 nm and an “absorption window” from 400 to 550 nm at the same time. In other words, the device efficiency in this study is mainly limited by the weak absorptivity in the visible range rather than by charge-carrier generation and collection. Such absorption loss can be overcome by using donor and acceptor polymers with complementary absorption bands. If the complementary absorption spectrum ranges from 350 to 800 nm, we can achieve a JSC value of 16 mA cm−2 even with an EQE of 60%. Moreover, using a wider HOMO–LUMO bandgap acceptor polymer with a LUMO energy level larger than that of our acceptor by more than 0.2 eV (or a donor polymer with a HOMO energy level smaller (deeper) than that of our donor by more than 0.2 eV) will allow the VOC to rise above 1 V. Consequently, a PCE of 8% should be achievable. In addition, we note that the device shown in this study was fabricated by simply spin coating an active layer onto a normal ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Processing approaches such as using solvent additives5,41,42 and novel interfacial layers combined with an inverted device structure,1,43 will further increase the PCE. We, therefore, believe that the PCEs of polymer/polymer blend solar cells can be further improved up to 9%, as in the case of state-of-the-art polymer/fullerene solar cells.

Broader context
Polymer/polymer blend solar cells, consisting of polymer donors and acceptors, have numerous advantages over polymer/fullerene solar cells, including the flexible molecular design and larger scope for tuning of optical, electronic, and morphological properties of the materials. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer/polymer blend solar cells is still far less than that of polymer/fullerene solar cells mainly because of lower charge generation and collection efficiency. Herein, we report polymer/polymer blend solar cells with a PCE of 5.73%. We found both charge-carrier generation and collection efficiencies to be as high as 80%, which is comparable to those of efficient polymer/fullerene solar cells. This finding indicates that the potential of polymer/polymer blend solar cells is equivalent to that of polymer/fullerene solar cells.


 	Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures of PBDTTT-EF-T and N2200. (b) Absorption coefficients (α) of PBDTTT-EF-T (solid line) and N2200 (broken line) neat films spin-coated from chlorobenzene. (c) Energy level diagram of PBDTTT-EF-T and N2200 neat films. The HOMO levels were evaluated by photoelectron yield spectroscopy, and the LUMO levels were estimated by adding the optical bandgap energy, calculated from the 0–0 transition, to the HOMO energy (ESI, Fig. S6†).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) J–V characteristics of a PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell with the best PCE of 5.73% under AM 1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (solid line) and in the dark (broken line): JSC = 13.0 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.794, and FF = 0.556. (b) EQE (solid line) and reflection absorption (broken line) spectra of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell.	 


Best	13.0	0.794	0.556	5.73
Averagea	13.0 ± 0.22	0.795 ± 0.00	0.534 ± 0.01	5.50 ± 0.08

 	Fig. 3  Photocurrent density (Jph) of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell as a function of the applied reverse (negative) voltage under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The Jph values were obtained by subtracting the current density in the dark (JD) from that under illumination (JL) as Jph = JL − JD. Jph,sat and JSC represent the reverse saturation photocurrent density and short-circuit current density, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Tapping-mode AFM topographical (left) and phase (right) images (1 μm × 1 μm) of a PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 blended film. The scale bar corresponds to a length of 0.5 μm. The film was spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution onto a glass substrate.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Charge transport efficiencies under short-circuit conditions (JSC/Jph,sat) obtained at varying incident light intensities ranging from 100 to 0.32 mW cm−2; Jph,sat is the reverse saturation photocurrent density. (b) Incident light intensity (Plight) dependence of JSC. The data were fitted by a solid line according to JSC ∝ PlightS with a slope S of 0.96; S was given by a least-squares fit over the entire range of light intensities.	 

 	Fig. 6  Photocurrent density Jph of the PBDTTT-EF-T/N2200 BHJ solar cell plotted against the effective applied voltage (V0 − V) under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2; V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and V is the applied voltage. The broken line represents the square-root dependence of the Jph on the voltage.
