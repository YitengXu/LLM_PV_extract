    , Accepted 15th May 2021First published on 14th June 2021AbstractDeveloping non-precious metal catalysts capable of both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium is of great significance in the electrocatalytic water-splitting industry. Herein, a novel nanoforest-like NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu heterojunction with excellent overall water splitting activity and long-term stability is synthesized through the facile substrate etching and hydrothermal crystallization processes. The nanotree-like NiCo2O4/CuxO supported on Cu foam achieves a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at small overpotential (η10 = 92 mV for the HER; η10 = 213 mV for the OER), which is significantly ahead of the corresponding pristine catalyst NiCo2O4/Cu (η10 = 295 mV for the HER; η10 = 349 mV for the OER) and CuxO/Cu (η10 = 309 mV for the HER; η10 = 347 mV for the OER). In addition, NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu can work stably for more than 125 h, and the stability is superior to the noble metal catalysts (Pt/C and RuO2) at different potentials. The electrons transfer from Cu2O to NiCo2O4 with the formation of Cu–O bonds at the interface, making parts of the relatively inert Cu(I) into the active Cu(II), introducing abundant new active sites. The hierarchical self-supported nanoforest-like structure enlarges the electrochemically active surface area and ensures the bonding strength of NiCo2O4/CuxO with the Cu skeleton, giving rise to excellent stability. The superb electrocatalytic performance and stability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu makes it a promising bifunctional catalytic material for overall water splitting. This study provides new testimony of interface effects and the mechanism may inspire the extending design of more effective catalysts.
1. Introduction
The rapid development of industrial civilization is supported by massive consumption of traditional non-renewable energy sources, followed by the shortage of fossil fuels and severe environmental deterioration.1 Hydrogen, clean and sustainable energy, regarded as a promising alternative to fossil fuels has aroused worldwide attention in recent years.2 Water electrolysis, which can be powered by inexhaustible wind or solar energy, is a feasible electrochemical method to produce hydrogen sustainably.3 Overall water splitting including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be effectively facilitated by the utilization of appropriate catalysts. To date, noble metal and their derivatives are well known as the top-class efficient electrocatalysts, such as platinum-based catalysts for the HER and ruthenium-based catalysts for the OER.4,5 However, the scarcity and pricy cost of the noble-metal materials impose obstacles to their widespread applications. In addition, the HER performances of Pt-based electrocatalysts are impaired greatly in alkaline media, whereas electrolytes widely employed in the commercial water electrolysis industry are alkaline solutions.6 Thus, it is in high demand to explore non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of both the HER and the OER with excellent efficiency and stability in an alkaline environment.
The apparent activity of a catalyst highly depends on its composition and structure. Exploiting materials with superb intrinsic catalytic activity is essential, and constructing a unique microstructure that can expose more active sites is also important to enhance the apparent activity. Diverse series of earth-abundant transition metal compounds, such as transition metal dichalcogenides,7,8 selenides,9,10 phosphides,11,12 oxides,13,14 hydroxides,15,16 and carbides,17,18 are identified as the promising substitutes for precious-metal catalysts in recent years. The water splitting reaction sets off at relatively high potential, but most compounds cannot preserve the original composition and structure under such conditions. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have excellent corrosion resistance at high potential in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. Moreover, the inexpensive TMOs are diverse in structures and variable in valence states, showing rosy prospects for commercial water splitting applications. NiCo2O4, a typical spinel transition metal oxide, has shown eye-catching potential in supercapacitors and batteries due to its abundant multiple oxidation states.19,20 However, the activity of NiCo2O4 as an efficient bifunctional water-electrolyzing catalyst is far inferior to to that of other excellent non-noble catalysts or only shows the ability to facilitate water oxidation. For example, Lin et al. synthesized NiCo2O4 hollow microcuboids and found that η10 (overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2) for overall water splitting was 1.65 V.21 Liu et al. reported a 3D core–shell NiCo2O4 consists of a NiCo2O4 nanowire core and a NiCo2O4 nanoflake shell, which achieved a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with an overpotential of ∼320 mV for the OER.22 The researchers have confirmed that combining TMOs with other conductive compounds to construct heterogeneous interfaces is a feasible strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance.23 For example, Wang et al. synthesized a unique NiCo2O4@MnO2 nanoarray in situ anchored on carbon textile and found that the hybrid performed better than pristine NiCo2O4 or MnO2 in the OER.24 Qiao et al. prepared a hierarchically porous N-graphene/NiCo2O4, showing a remarkable OER catalytic activity (η5 = 373 mV) which is comparable to IrO2.25
Owing to the high abundance and low price, copper oxide is a kind of non-precious electrocatalyst with industrial application potential. Groot et al. reported a nanoleaf-like CuxO self-assembled on a Cu substrate, which can obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an applied potential of 1.75 V in the alkaline electrolyte (pH = 11). Du et al. synthesized bind-free CuO on FTO by the electrodeposition method, as an efficient electrode for the OER exhibiting a current density of 1 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 430 mV in KOH (1 M).26 Importantly, in addition to its intrinsic activity, copper oxides are easy to be in situ synthesized upon conductive metal copper on a large scale.27–29 Without using polymer binder not only allows the catalysts to possess better electrical conductivity, but also prevents them from falling off in the process of gas generation, leading to better stability. It is worth noting that the construction of a hierarchical structure can significantly expand the surface area of the catalyst and provide abundant channels, through which the electrolyte can fully contact the internal catalyst, as well as the generated gas can duly diffuse.30–32 Therefore, we expected that creating a hybrid of copper oxides and NiCo2O4 with a hierarchical structure can exhibit superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting.
Herein, a self-supported hierarchical nanoforest-like NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu heterojunction was designed and synthesized. Considering that CuxO can in situ grow upon Cu foam on a large scale, CuxO/Cu is preferable to serve as the substratum of the hierarchical structure, meanwhile NiCo2O4 acts as the superstratum. This unique structure enables the heterojunction to possess an expanded surface area, more electrochemically active sites, and abundant pathways for electrolyte and product transport. The chemically bonded heterojunction interface induces a built-in electric field, which accelerates the transfer of electrons during the reactions. The electrons transfer from Cu2O to NiCo2O4 through the Cu–O bonds at the interface, oxidizing parts of inert Cu(I) into active Cu(II), introducing abundant new active sites. NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu significantly outperforms the two individual counterparts in catalytic electrolyzing water under the alkaline conditions. The superior activity and stability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu for both the HER and the OER make it a promising candidate to substitute the noble-metal electrocatalysts.
2. Experimental section
All reagents are of analytical grade and used directly without further purification.
2.1 Synthesis of Cu(OH)2/Cu and CuxO/Cu
Cu(OH)2/Cu was prepared by a chemical etching method. Typically, 8 mL NaOH (10 M) was slowly dropped into 22 mL (NH4)2S2O8 (0.18 M) to obtain the etching solution. After ultrasonic cleaning with dilute hydrochloric acid and ethanol, Cu foam was cut into 3 × 2 cm2 pieces then immersed into the above-mentioned etching solution for 20 min. The color of the Cu foam changed from yellow to blue, and the product was Cu(OH)2/Cu. Washed by deionized water repeatedly and dried in an oven overnight, Cu(OH)2/Cu was annealed in air at 350 °C for 2 h to get CuxO/Cu.
2.2 Synthesis of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu
NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu was synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Typically, 1 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.5 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and 0.5 g urea were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water and stirred for 30 min. Then, Cu(OH)2/Cu and the mixed solution were transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 120 °C for 6 h. Washed by deionized water thoroughly and dried overnight, the hydrothermal products were annealed at 350 °C for 2 h in air to obtained NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu. The time of the hydrothermal reaction changed from 4 h to 8 h, and the samples were denoted as NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu-X (X means the hydrothermal time).
2.3 Synthesis of CoxOy/CuxO/Cu and NixOy/CuxO/Cu
Similar to the 2.2 steps, except adding the only Co source or the Ni source in the hydrothermal process.
2.4 Synthesis of NiCo2O4/Cu
Similar to the 2.2 steps, except that Cu(OH)2/Cu was replaced by bare Cu foam.
3. Characterization
The phase of the samples was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance, Cu Kα, 2θ in the range from 10° to 80° with a step of 0.02°). The morphology of catalysts was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Supra) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai, G2F30). Elemental analyses were studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-OES, Thermo, iCAP 7400). The chemical states of samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Escalab 250Xi, Al Kα). The specific surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method based on nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms measurements carried out on a Beishide 3H-2000PS1 Gas Sorption and Porosimetry system. The Raman spectra were obtained at a laser wavelength of 532 nm (Renishaw inVia).
4. Electrochemical measurements
The HER and OER electrochemical tests were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Princeton Versa STAT) with a three-electrode electrolytic cell. N2-purged KOH solution (1 M) was used as an electrolyte for the HER and O2-purged one for the OER. A Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) electrode and a graphite electrode worked as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The samples (1 × 1 cm2) were used as working electrodes directly. The Pt–C/Cu and RuO2/Cu electrodes for comparison were prepared by dropping the ink (2 mg 20% Pt/C or RuO2 mixed with 70 μL of anhydrous ethanol and 6 μL of Nafion solution with ultrasonic treatment for 30 min) directly on a piece of Cu foam (1 × 1 cm2), and dried overnight at room temperature. For the sake of eliminating the influence of ohmic impedance to reveal the intrinsic catalytic properties, the potential was calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) value with iR correction according to the following equation: ERHE = EHg/HgO(1 M KOH) + 0.098 + 0.0591 × pH − iR. Before electrical measurements, all the samples were activated by 50 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The HER and OER catalytic performances were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a sweep rate of 1 mV s−1. The stabilities of the catalysts were investigated by the chronoamperometry test. Electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) were evaluated by CV measurements from 1.10 V to 1.20 V versus RHE with scan rates of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were studied with an amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range from 0.10 Hz to 10 kHz at open circuit voltage. The electrical conductivity was tested using the four-probe method.
5 DFT calculations
All the density-functional theory (DFT) computations were performed using the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) based on the pseudopotential plane wave (PPW) method. Electron–ion interactions were described using the ultrasoft (USP) potentials. A plane-wave basis set was employed to expand the wave functions with a cutoff kinetic energy of 400 eV. For the electron–electron exchange and correlation interactions, the functional parametrized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE), a form of general gradient approximation (GGA), was used throughout. The van der Waals interaction was described using the DFT-D2 method proposed by Grimme. During the geometry optimizations, the bottom atoms were fixed at the bulk position. In this work, the Brillouin-zone integrations were conducted using Monkhorst–Pack (MP) grids of special points. A (1 × 2 × 1) k-point grid was used for the model supercell. The convergence criterion for the electronic self-consistent field (SCF) loop was set to 1 × 10−6 eV per atom. The atomic structures were optimized until the residual forces were below 0.03 eV Å−1, and the cell parameters were also optimized with the finite basis correction until the stress was less than 0.05 GPa. The DFT+U method was applied to obtain the optimized bandgap when calculating the band structure and the density of state (DOS) with Ueff = 5.5 eV for 3d orbitals of Ni, 4.4 eV for 3d orbitals of Co, and 7.14 eV for 3d orbitals of Cu.33–35
6 Results and discussion
The preparation process of the three dimensional hierarchical NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu nanoforest is illustrated in Fig. 1a. As a substrate, Cu foam provides an affluent surface area for Cu(OH)2 to grow. Through a facial chemical etching method, vertically aligned Cu(OH)2 nanorods (NRs) are synthesized in situ on the Cu foam evenly. Subsequently, NiCo-precursor nanoneedles (NNs) anchor on Cu(OH)2 NRs after undergoing a low-temperature hydrothermal process. By calcining in air, Cu(OH)2 and NiCo-precursors are converted to CuxO and NiCo2O4, respectively.

(c) TEM image, (d) HRTEM image; the insets are the IFFT images of the marked areas, (e) SAED pattern, (f) HAADF image, and (g) corresponding elemental mapping of an individual NiCo2O4/CuxO nanotree. 
The morphologies of samples are observed by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. S1,† Cu(OH)2 NRs with a length of 7–13 μm and diameter of ∼350 nm are fully distributed on the surface of commercially available Cu foam after a chemical etching procedure. No cracking and shedding can be observed on Cu foam, indicating the excellent mechanical bond between Cu(OH)2 NRs and the Cu substrate. The CuxO NRs formed after calcination treatment are curlier than Cu(OH)2 (Fig. S2†). Fig. 1b and S6† are SEM images of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu. Acicular NiCo2O4 NNs assemble on CuxO NRs vertically to form a nanotree; well-aligned nanotrees grow on the Cu foam skeleton to form the nanoforest. The TEM image in Fig. 1c reveals the characteristic structural feature of an individual NiCo2O4/CuxO nanotree. Compared with NiCo2O4 NNs growing directly on the Cu foam skeleton (Fig. S3 and S4,† ∼2 μm in length and ∼100 nm in diameter), the pin-shaped NiCo2O4 in heterojunction is only ∼300 nm in length and ∼10 nm in diameter. Compared with flat Cu foam, the surface of Cu(OH)2/Cu is rougher and the radius of curvature of the nucleation surface is smaller. So the energy barrier to form a critical nucleus on the surface of Cu(OH)2/Cu is lower than that on Cu foam, resulting in the formation of more crystalline nuclei of the NiCo-precursor on the surface of the Cu(OH)2/Cu. Besides, the hydroxyl groups of NiCo-precursors are more likely to bind to the hydroxyl groups in Cu(OH)2, which makes NiCo-precursors prefer to grow on the nanorods. The size of the crystal depends on the driving force of the growth, that is, the concentration of raw materials in the solution. With the same concentration, the more crystal nuclei formed, the smaller the size of the crystal. In addition, the steric hindrance effect also contributes to the formation of smaller NiCo2O4. The size reduction of NiCo2O4 greatly increases the specific surface area of the catalyst (Table S1†).36 As shown in the SEM images of the samples with different hydrothermal reaction times (Fig. S7†), the surface of Cu(OH)2 NRs is significantly rougher after 0.5 h of the hydrothermal reaction, indicating that a large number of NiCo-precursor crystal nuclei are formed on the surface. With the prolongation of the reaction time, the NiCo-precursor gradually grows into a nanoneedle shape perpendicular to Cu(OH)2. When the reaction time was 4 h, the nanotrees close together disperse into more evenly spaced nanotrees as the NiCo-precursor grows larger. With the reaction time exceeding 6 h, the size of the NiCo-precursor keeps increasing, and the nanoneedles self-aggregate to form nanoflowers, which would cover the highly active heterogeneous interface.
Lattice fringes of Cu2O, CuO, and NiCo2O4 are shown intuitively in the HRTEM images (Fig. 1d) taken at the interface of NiCo2O4 and CuxO. The interplanar spacing widths of 0.243, 0.232, and 0.245 nm are corresponding to the (111) crystal plane of Cu2O, the (111) plane of CuO, and the (311) plane of NiCo2O4, respectively.37,38 From the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) images of the marked areas, many dislocation defects can be found, which are usually regarded as active sites.39 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirm the coexistence of the three different phases and the polycrystalline structure of NiCo2O4/CuxO (Fig. 1e). The EDS spectrum in Fig. S8† shows that Ni, Co, Cu, and O coexist in NiCo2O4/CuxO. The atomic percentage of Ni/Co obtained by EDS is 9.32/14.60. The ICP-OES, which is more accurate than EDS in the element, quantitative analysis is applied to further confirm the content of transition metal elements in the samples (Table S2†). It can be seen that the molar ratio of Ni to Co is close to 1:2. From the element mapping images (Fig. 1f and g), it can be seen that Cu is only dominant in the trunk region, while Ni, Co, and O are uniformly distributed in the whole nanotree. The line scan elemental distribution is consistent with the element mapping result (Fig. S9†). The signal of Cu shows up in the trunk region, while Ni, Co, and O can be detected in the trunk and branches.
The crystal phases of as-prepared samples are confirmed by XRD. As shown in Fig. S10,† the diffraction peaks of nanorods formed on the surface of Cu foam after chemical etching correspond to the standard pattern of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2 (JCPDS #72-0140). In addition, the formation of amorphous Cu(OH) and the reactions (Cu + 2OH− → CuO + H2O + 2e−; 2Cu2+ + 2e− + 2OH− → Cu2O + H2O) occurred leading to the formation of Cu2O.40,41 After calcining in air, a compound of CuO (JCPDS #48-1548) mixing Cu2O (JCPDS #34-1354) is synthesized.42,43 Fig. S11† reveals that the NiCo-precursor is identified as Co(CO3)0.5(OH)!0.11H2O (JCPDS #48-0083) mixing Ni2CO3(OH)2!H2O (JCPDS #29-0868), which transformed into cubic NiCo2O4 (JCPDS #20-0781) by annealing at 350 °C for 2 h.44Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu, which is consistent with the lattice fringes in HRTEM image (Fig. 1d). Peaks at 36.70° and 64.80° are indexed as (311) and (440) reflections of NiCo2O4; peaks at 35.54°, 38.71°, 48.72°, 37.01°, 42.61°, and 62.44° correspond to (11−1), (111), (20−2) crystal planes of CuO and (111), (200), (220) planes of Cu2O. The peak intensity of CuO is slightly stronger than that of Cu2O in the XRD pattern of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu, different from the XRD pattern of CuxO/Cu, where the diffraction peak of Cu2O is higher than that of CuO. The Raman spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 2b. The characteristic Raman bands at 108/147/216/415/522 cm−1 and 296/350/635 cm−1 correspond to Cu2O and CuO in CuxO/Cu, respectively.45 The peaks at 181/526 cm−1 and 653 cm−1 correspond to the F2g and A1g modes of NiCo2O4.46 The shoulder peak at 459 cm−1 corresponds to the Eg mode of NiCo2O4. The characteristic Raman peaks of CuO are stronger than that of Cu2O in NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu, but the opposite is true in CuxO/Cu. The Raman spectra are consistent with XRD patterns, suggesting that the proportion of CuO in CuxO increases as the formation of heterojunction. All the above-mentioned characterization results confirm the successful formation of the NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu nanoforest.

XPS is applied to analyze the elemental composition and chemical valence state of the catalysts within a depth of 10 nm (Fig. S12† and 2c–f). Fig. 2c–f show the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni, Co, Cu, and O, respectively. The two peaks at 854.6 eV and 872.7 eV correspond to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 2c).47 Further deconvolution of Ni 2p peaks confirms the coexistence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ (854.4 eV and 872.2 eV belong to Ni2+; 856.1 eV and 873.8 eV belong to Ni3+). The two satellite peaks of Ni 2p located at 861.2 eV and 879.2 eV, respectively. Compared with NiCo2O4/Cu, no obvious shift is observed. The peak area is applied to quantify the ions of different valence states (Table S3†). The content of Ni3+ increases from 50.91% (NiCo2O4/Cu) to 55.22% (NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu), indicating that Ni is slightly oxidized after combining with CuxO.48 Similar to the spectra of Ni 2p, characteristic spin orbit doublets and two shakeup satellite peaks can be observed in the Co 2p spectra (Fig. 2d). The peaks at 779.7 eV, 794.8 eV are ascribed to Co3+, and peaks at 781.5 eV, 796.8 eV belongs to Co2+.42 The percentage of Co2+ increases from 50.05% (NiCo2O4/Cu) to 56.73% (NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu), indicating that Co is slightly reduced after combining with CuxO. Peaks at 932.9 eV and 953.9 eV in Fig. 2e correspond to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2. Compared with the spectrum of Cu 2p in CuxO/Cu, a positive shift of about 0.5 eV can be observed, which indicates the strong electronic interaction between CuxO and NiCo2O4.49,50 The proportion of Cu2+ increases from 46.12% (CuxO/Cu) to 70.52% (NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu), indicating that Cu+ is partially oxidized to Cu2+, which is consistent with XRD patterns and Raman spectra (Fig. 2a and b). According to the above results, it is speculated that Cu–O bonds are formed at the heterogeneous interface and electrons are transferred from CuxO to NiCo2O4. In Fig. 2f, the peak at 529.5 eV is assigned to metal–oxygen bonds, and the peak at 531.1 eV is from the defect sites in small size materials with low oxygen coordination.38,51 The peak at 532.6 eV is associated with the hydroxyl groups or water adsorbed on the surface.52
To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu, LSV measurements were carried out with a sweep rate of 1 mV s−1 in a three-electrode electrolytic cell. NiCo2O4/Cu, CuxO/Cu, RuO2/Cu, and bare Cu foam as comparison were tested under the same conditions. It is obvious from the polarization curves in Fig. 3a that compared with NiCo2O4/Cu (η10 = 349 mV) and CuxO/Cu (η10 = 347 mV), NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu exhibits the lowest onset potential and overpotential (η10 = 219 mV). NiCo2O4 NNs and CuxO NRs grown on Cu foam can both be activated as the OER reaction centers (lower η10 than bare Cu foam).53,54 By combining NiCo2O4 and CuxO, the OER electrocatalytic performance of the heterojunction is significantly improved. It is worth noting that the OER activity of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu surpasses that of the commercial RuO2 (η10 = 294 mV), signifying that NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is an extremely efficient OER catalyst. Since the oxidation peak at ∼1.33 V only shows up in the LSV curves of CuxO/Cu and NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu, it is attributed to the oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+ (inset in Fig. 3a).55 The peak current of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is larger than that of CuxO/Cu, which may be because the heterogeneous interfaces facilitate electron transfer and accelerate the oxidation of Cu+. The XPS spectra (Fig. S13a†) show that with the high anodic current in alkaline solution, a part of Cu0 can be oxidized to Cu2+ on the surface of Cu foam. The etching rate of Cu in alkaline solution is demonstrated by the ICP-OES (Table S4†). It can be clearly seen that the etching rate of the Cu substrate of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is relatively fast in the first 12 h of the reaction, and then the total amount of etched Cu gradually stabilizes as the reaction continues. As a comparison, bare Cu foam shows a similar trend. As the reaction time increases, the etching rate of Cu gradually slows down. This is due to the gradual oxidation of Cu foam to copper oxide as the reaction proceeds, which is proved by XPS results (Fig. S13a†). The copper oxide covering the surface prevents the electrolyte from contacting Cu foam and slows down the etching rate. Compared with bare Cu foam, the etching rate of Cu in NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu whose surface is densely covered by the nanoforest is significantly lower, indicating that Cu foam as the substrate in NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is relatively stable. LSV curves of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu which deducts the current of Cu foam are shown in Fig. S13b,† and there is no significant difference, indicating that the contribution from Cu to Cu(II) in the as-obtained anode current is negligible.

The OER kinetics of the electrocatalyst is assessed by Tafel slopes (Fig. 3b). According to the equation η = a + blogj, overpotential (η) is linearly related to the logarithm of current density (j) in the high overpotential region.56 The lower Tafel slope indicates that smaller overpotential is required to increase the same current density, that is, the kinetics of the reaction is preferable.57 The Tafel slope of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is 77.8 mv dec−1, much lower than NiCo2O4/Cu and CuxO/Cu. In addition, it is comparable to RuO2/Cu, suggesting that NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu as a candidate is an alternative to noble-metal OER catalysts (comparison with other non-noble catalysts is shown in Table S5†).
The HER performance of catalysts is assessed in N2-saturated KOH (1 M) solution. The NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu heterojunction exhibits a low overpotential of 92 mV as attaining a current density of 10 mA cm−2, much lower than that of NiCo2O4/Cu and CuxO/Cu (Fig. 3d). The Tafel slope of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is significantly lower than the corresponding individual NiCo2O4/Cu and CuxO/Cu, suggesting NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu undergoes a faster HER process (Fig. 3e). This result confirms that the combination of NiCo2O4 and CuxO can facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction. Although 20% Pt–C/Cu exhibits the lowest overpotential (η10 = 24.5 mV) and Tafel slope (25.7 mV dec−1), the excellent HER performance of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu also ranks forefront of non-noble metal HER catalysts (Table S6†).
To compare the electrocatalytic performance of NiCo2O4/CuOx/Cu, NiCo2O4/Cu, and CuOx/Cu accurately, LSV curves normalized by the mass loading are shown in Fig. S14.† It can be seen that the mass activity of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is better than that of NiCo2O4/Cu and CuxO/Cu. The TOFs of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu (Fig. S15,† 0.0036 s−1 for the OER and 0.033 s−1 for the HER, η = 300 mV) is higher than that of NiCo2O4/Cu (0.00015 s−1 for the OER and 0.0015 s−1 for the HER, η = 300 mV) and CuxO/Cu (0.00013 s−1 for the OER and 0.00096 s−1 for the HER, η = 300 mV). The Faraday efficiencies (Fig. S16†) of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu for the OER and the HER are 99% and 98%, respectively. These results further confirm the superior performance of the heterojunction. CoxOy/CuxO/Cu and NixOy/CuxO/Cu are synthesized by adding only the Co source or the Ni source in the hydrothermal process. XRD patterns (Fig. S17†) show that the main components of CoxOy and NixOy are Co3O4 and NiO respectively. The morphologies of CoxOy/CuxO/Cu and NixOy/CuxO/Cu are shown in Fig. S18.† From Fig. S19† it can be seen clearly that the performance of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is better than that of CoxOy/CuxO/Cu and NixOy/CuxO/Cu. The superior electrocatalytic performance of binary metal oxides NiCo2O4 due in part to its better electrical conductivity compared with the corresponding single oxides Co3O4 and NiO.58 Besides, NiCo2O4 can take advantage of the variable but stable redox couples of both Ni (Ni2+/Ni3+) and Co (Co2+/Co3+), which can provide more potential active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance.58
The long-term durability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is confirmed by the chronoamperometry measurements. For the OER, as shown in Fig. 3c, current density retains ∼10 mA cm−2 without obvious degradation after 125 h at a constant potential of 1.51 V. As for the HER, NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu affords a current density of ∼20 mA cm−2 at a static potential of 1.48 V for 150 h (Fig. 3f), indicating the superior stability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu. The almost overlapping polarization curves (before and after 500 CV cycles) further evidenced the excellent OER and HER stability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu. The multipotentiometry stability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu, PtC/Cu, and RuO2/Cu is shown in Fig. S20.† It can be seen that the performance of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is better than that of noble metal catalysts at different current densities. The superb stability is attributed to the unique self-supported hierarchical structure. The In situ growth of CuxO and hydrothermal crystallization of NiCo2O4 ensure the bonding strength between CuxO, NiCo2O4, and the Cu foam skeleton. The nanoforest-like hierarchical structure provides abundant open channels for gas products to emit, thus prevents NiCo2O4/CuxO from falling off in the process of gas generation.
As exhibiting both efficient and stable OER and HER performances in alkaline media, NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is expected to be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. A two-electrode system cell, in which NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is used as the anode and the cathode synchronously, is employed to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity and stability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu. The current density reaches 10 mA cm−2 at the cell voltage of 1.61 V and remains steady for 30 h (Fig. 3g), which is comparable to the first-rank non-noble water-splitting catalysts recently reported (Table S7†). From the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 3g and S21, S22†), it can be visually evidenced that the micromorphology of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu remains intact after use. From the HRTEM image of the used NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu (Fig. S23†), the heterogeneous interface is clearly visible. The phase composition derived from lattice fringe spacing does not change, which is also confirmed by XRD (Fig. S24†) and XPS results (Fig. S25 and Table S8†). The above results declare reasonably that NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is a rational bifunctional non-noble electrocatalyst with efficient and stable performance.
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) embodies the amount of exposed active sites of the electrocatalyst, which play a pivotal role in facilitating the catalytic reaction.59 As the value of ECSA is theoretically proportional to the double layer capacitance (Cdl), Cdl is often used as an indicator to compare the number of exposed active sites. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of catalysts measured in the non-faradic region from 1.1 V to 1.2 V (vs. RHE) with different scan rates (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mV s−1) are shown in Fig. S26.† The value of Cdl equals the slope of the plot of Δj/2 against the scan rates (Fig. 3h). The Cdl of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is much higher than that of NiCo2O4/Cu and CuxO/Cu, implying that the hierarchical nanoforest-like structure with the abundant heterogeneous interface can expose more active sites. The built-in electric field at the interface can accelerate electron transfer, which is proved by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Nyquist plots of the catalysts are all typical semi-circular arcs (Fig. 3i). Compared with the two individual counterparts, the smallest radius of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu represents the smallest charge transfer resistance (Rct), indicating superior activity.
In addition, the effect of the hydrothermal time on the morphology and electrocatalytic performance of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu is investigated by changing the reaction time from 4 to 8 hours. The SEM images of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu-4 and NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu-8 are shown in Fig. S7.† The short reaction time leads to insufficient growth of NiCo2O4 NNs on Cu(OH)2 NRs, which reduces the surface area and the number of active sites exposed, resulting in an inferior electrocatalytic performance (Fig. S27†). Nevertheless, NiCo2O4 NNs not only deposit on Cu(OH)2 NRs but also assemble to be nanoflower-like species as reaction time prolongs. The BET surface area of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu-8 enlarges compared with that of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu-6 due to the formation of the NiCo2O4 nanoflower. However, according to the result of ECSA measurements (Fig. S28†), active sites of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu-8 tail off instead. Because a part of the heterogeneous interface is shielded by the nanoflowers, the electrolyte cannot reach the active sites at the interfaces, making it display minimum activity. These results indicate that the well-grown heterojunction formed by chemical-bonding NiCo2O4 NNs and CuxO NRs is the key to improve the electrocatalytic performance.
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are to theoretically demonstrate the effect of the heterojunction interface on the catalytic performance. According to the XRD and HRTEM results, Cu2O (111) and NiCo2O4 (311) are used to represent CuxO and NiCo2O4 to simplify the calculation. The heterojunction is formed by the superposition of Cu2O (111) and NiCo2O4 (311) (Fig. 4a and S29–S31†). The binding energy of the heterojunction is −40.6108 eV, indicating that Cu2O and NiCo2O4 are bonded by chemical bonds, rather than weak van der Waals forces. According to Bader charges (Table S9†), the charges on the Cu atoms in Cu2O shift to the O atoms in NiCo2O4 through the Cu–O bond at the interface, making Cu in the heterojunction more positive compared with pristine Cu2O. The calculated density of states (DOS) is shown in Fig. 4b. There is a gap at the Fermi level in the DOS of Cu2O, while the DOS of the hybrid is continuous, indicating its intrinsic metallic characters.60 Besides, the DOS of NiCo2O4/CuxO is lower than that of NiCo2O4 and higher than that of CuxO at the Fermi level, indicating that electrons are withdrawn from Cu2O to NiCo2O4, which is consistent with the theoretical Bader charge analysis and the experimental XRD, Raman, and XPS analysis (ratio of Cu(II) increases as the formation of the heterojunction).48 Cu2+ can shuttle through transient oxidized (Cu3+ and Cu4+) or reduced (Cu+ and Cu0) states, which is a preferable center for participating in electrochemical oxidation and reduction processes.61–64 In addition, Co and Ni sites have also been confirmed by abundant reports to be excellent catalytic active sites.25,65 Due to the strong charge transfer at the interfaces in NiCo2O4/CuxO, additional active Cu(II) sites for adsorption of intermediates such as OH, O, and OOH species are exposed.64

The band structure of catalysts is shown in Fig. 4c. The bandgap of Cu2O is 1.12 eV and that of NiCo2O4 is 0.07 eV. The bandgap of NiCo2O4/CuxO decreases to 0.02 eV, indicating that the heterojunction is more metallic.66 The experimentally measured conductivity (Fig. 4d) is consistent with the theoretically calculated bandgap value. Faster transmission of electrons is more beneficial to the electrocatalytic water splitting reaction, which is a key reason why the NiCo2O4/CuxO exhibits the best.
7 Conclusion
In summary, a three-dimensional and self-supported nanoforest-like NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu has been synthesized through simple chemical etching followed by a hydrothermal and annealing process. NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu exhibits superior performance for both the OER and the HER in the alkaline media. It presents a η10 of 92 mV for the HER and a η10 of 213 mV for the OER. In addition, the catalyst remains stable for more than 125 h. The excellent bifunctional overall water splitting performance and stability of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu can be attributed to the following factors. The electrons transfer strongly from Cu2O to NiCo2O4 with the formation of Cu–O bonds at the interfaces, making parts of Cu(I) into active Cu(II), introducing abundant new active sites. The built-in electric field at the interface of the strongly coupled NiCo2O4 and CuxO facilitates the transfer of electrons, thus accelerates the water splitting reaction. The three-dimensional nanoforest structure greatly increases the specific surface area of NiCo2O4/CuxO/Cu and provides abundant channels which enable the electrolyte to reach the inner surface of the catalyst, as well as the generated bubbles to be emitted more easily, ensuring long-term stability. This study provides a new testimony of interface effects and the mechanism may inspire extending the design of more effective catalysts.
