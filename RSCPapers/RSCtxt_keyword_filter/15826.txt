    , Accepted 22nd September 2020First published on 23rd September 2020AbstractBuilding integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) are attached to commercial and residential structures to enable solar energy harvesting. While conventional Si photovoltaics (PVs) are dominant in the current market, second and third generation thin film solar cells based on amorphous Si, CdTe, CIGS, perovskites or organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are often considered as an alternative for BIPV applications since they may offer reduced costs compared to Si PVs. Indeed, recent advances in performance suggest that lightweight, flexible and visibly transparent OPVs can potentially be integrated into windows or other applications to which Si PVs are less well suited. Here, we estimate the cost of high efficiency, semitransparent OPVs (ST-OPVs) based on solution processing in a roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing line. Assuming modules with 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE), a 70% geometric fill factor (GFF), and 95% inverter efficiency, we anticipate a %1.6 per Wp module manufacturing cost that includes the cost of the microinverter to condition the OPV dc output to be compatible with the ac line voltage of the building. The materials and inverter cost comprise ∼90% of the total module cost. Hence, with simplified material synthesis and a lower inverter cost, including marginally improved PCE and GFF, we expect the cost can be as low as $0.47 per Wp. While the module costs ∼60% of the average (uninstalled) double-pane window, we expect the payback period can be as short as 2 to 6 years, suggesting that OPVs can be an economic and attractive candidate for BIPV applications.
I. Introduction
Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) are a space-efficient means for harvesting solar energy by replacing or covering a part of a building (e.g. rooftop, façade or windows) with photovoltaic modules.1–4 More than 80% of the current BIPV market is based on rooftop installed crystalline Si (c-Si) modules, with the remaining 20% installed mostly on façades.4,5 Integration of c-Si photovoltaics onto windows, however, has the disadvantage of visible opacity,6,7 requiring that the cells be perforated with holes, or applied in strips. Both strategies result in a reduction in their geometric fill factor (GFF, is the ratio of active cell to total module area), and hence limit the power that can be produced. An alternative approach is to employ visibly semitransparent photovoltaics based on organic semiconductors, quantum dots and perovskites integrated onto windows.1–3,8–10 However, besides organic semiconductors, application of such materials in BIPV systems has not been reported due to inadequate device performance and reliability, limited scalability, toxicity of materials, or high manufacturing cost compared to c-Si photovoltaics.1,2 Despite the scalability and successful demonstration of display manufacturing on an enormous scale, organic semiconductors are often considered to be an immature alternative to c-Si PVs within the BIPV industry.1,2 Recently, organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) based on DBP:C70 with accelerated intrinsic lifetimes extending to T80 = 27000 y have been reported,11 where T80 is the time of operation for the PCE to drop to 80% of its initial value. Furthermore, OPVs with cell PCE > 17%,12 module PCE > 14% (ref. 13) and neutral density, semi-transparent OPVs (ST-OPVs) with PCE > 10% have been reported.14
The visible transmittance of the ST-OPV cell is another important metric determining how well the technology is suited for use in power generating windows. To define transparency of the device, the average visible transmittance (AVT) which is the arithmetic mean of transmittance of the cell from 400 to 650 nm is often used. However, a more apt comparison that quantifies the appearance of the sunlight entering an interior space is provided by average photopic transmittance (APT), which is the transmittance of the cell weighted by the spectral response of human eye to a window illuminated by an AM 1.5G reference spectrum. Then, the light utilization efficiency (LUE), which is the product of PCE and APT, combines these factors into a ST-OPV figure of merit.15,16 A compilation of the LUE vs. APT for a range of thin film technologies (including amorphous Si – a-Si – perovskites, and OPVs) originally summarized by Lunt et al.16 and updated by Li et al.15 is provided in Fig. 1, and device performance of highlighted results are shown in Table 1. Apparently, ST-OPVs have the highest combination of transparency and efficiency, with a maximum LUE = 5%, compared with other thin film solar cell technologies. Given the scalability of OPVs using printing or other roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing processes,17–19 and their possibility for exceptionally long operational lifetimes,11 these advances point to their particular suitability for BIPV applications, especially for semi-transparent power generating windows.

Beyond these promising studies of laboratory cell performance, the acceptability of a PV technology ultimately hinges on the cost to produce large scale modules at high volume. Several different estimates of OPV module cost have varied from $0.2 to $1.2 per Wp based on differing assumptions of materials sets employed, and on module efficiencies that range from 5–10%.20–24 Up until now, however, most cost analyses are based on opaque cells while also omitting the costs of inverters, and miscellaneous costs such as sales, administrative, marketing, and R&D. Furthermore, they do not consider recent significant advances in OPV technology that have occurred over the last few years. In this work, we estimate the manufacturing cost of semitransparent OPV modules based on assumptions and accuracy corresponding to Class 4 of the Cost Engineering Classification System.25 Starting with estimations of high throughput R2R equipment costs needed for realizing a high efficiency single junction ST-OPV structure, we estimate the maintenance, utility, labor and materials costs. We further estimate costs due to the inclusion of a microinverter for making the solar output compatible with most in-building ac electrical systems. Inclusion of the inverter significantly simplifies power window installation,26 but is counterbalanced by the added cost of the inverter. Assuming the PV modules are integrated within double-pane windows to simplify encapsulation, we expect a manufacturing cost of $106.16 per m2. This places a premium on the average double-pane window cost in the U.S. of $106.80 per m2 (ref. 27–29) including the sealant, frame and assembly costs, based on market data and assuming a 30% margin. We estimate the cost can be as low as $57.24 per m2, provided that the materials and inverter costs can be incrementally reduced. We assume a base case semitransparent module PCE = 10%, which compares with current non-transparent module PCE > 14%.13 With GFF = 70%, and an inverter efficiency of ηinv = 95%, the estimated module cost without the inverter is $0.68 per Wp, at ∼160 MW annual production volume. We estimate a microinverter cost of $0.78 per Wp based on market data, which is similar to the household scale Si PV microinverter cost of $0.45 per Wp30 considering the efficiency differences between the two PV technologies. Assuming modest cost reductions in microinverters, OPV materials, contacts and optical coatings, we estimate the total system cost including miscellaneous costs can be further reduced from $1.6 per Wp to $0.47 per Wp in the foreseeable future. This suggests an energy payback period of 2 to 6 years depending on the window orientation, local cost of electricity, and location of installation.
II. Cost estimate assumptions and results
We divide the manufacturing cost into four categories – capital equipment, labor, utilities and materials. Additional miscellaneous costs including marketing, general and administrative (G&A), and research and development (R&D) are assumed to be 10% of total manufacturing cost based on recent 3 year average of PV manufacturing industry standards.31 Then, the desired OPV module structure for cost analysis is chosen and performance assumptions are established. For this analysis, we assume a 1 m wide R2R manufacturing web for PV module fabrication. Fig. 2(a) shows a schematic of an archetype semitransparent OPV cell structure. Starting from a flexible barrier substrate, the first deposited layer is the transparent cathode, followed by the cathode buffer/exciton blocking layer, active layer, anode buffer, and transparent anode. The layers are encapsulated by a second barrier substrate. For transparency, a mixture of non-fullerene acceptors and energy-level-matched donors that selectively absorb near-infrared (IR) photons are used as the active layer.32–36 Optical layers for outcoupling the visible and reflecting the IR photons are included to increase efficiency and transparency.15
 Fig. 2  A schematic of an (a) archetype semitransparent OPV device structure, and (b) proposed PV module layout for window integration. The microinverter (μ-inverter) is positioned outside of the viewing area, and individual cells are laid out in a series–parallel array configuration. 
A conceptual, schematic top view of a ST-OPV module integrated into a 1 m × 2 m window used in our cost estimates is shown in Fig. 2(b). An array of 2 cm × 2 cm ST-OPV cells are connected in a series–parallel circuit within the window module. Electrical interconnects and a microinverter for each module are integrated outside the viewing space of the window. The transparent PV cell foils can be directly attached onto a single-pane window surface without additional encapsulation,4,9 or they can be inserted into the pocket of a double-pane window37 as shown in Fig. 3. In this analysis, we use the latter configuration since it allows for simplified OPV encapsulation with inert gas commonly used within the gap between the panes. The optical coupling layers can be separately deposited onto the inner surfaces of the opposite panes. Integration of the optical coupling layers with the PV module itself is simplified compared to the direct attachment onto a single-pane window, which requires deposition of all layers onto the substrate film, or integration with the encapsulating lid.
 Fig. 3  Illustration of ST-OPV integrated onto windows. (Left) the PV module is laminated onto a single pane, and (right) into the pocket between a double pane, thermally insulating window. Typically, inert gas fills the gap between the panes. 

Fig. 4 shows materials choices and manufacturing processes used in the study. Starting from an ITO-coated transparent PET substrate, the bottom contact is patterned by laser scribing. The ZnO cathode buffer/exciton blocking layer, PTB7-Th:BT-CIC active layer, and MoO3 anode buffer are consecutively applied via slot-die coating. Each solution process is followed by solvent annealing in an oven integrated within the R2R tool. Before top contact deposition, the active layer is patterned for interconnect attachment using laser scribing. Contact layers are patterned during printing and sputtering and do not require additional scribing. The roll is transferred into a vacuum chamber for thin Ag transparent top contact15 R2R sputter deposition. After contact patterning, the roll is encapsulated by attachment of a second barrier substrate, spliced into the desired size, laminated onto a glass pane, and assembled into the double pane window.

A list of required manufacturing equipment and their annual costs assuming 10 year linear depreciation is summarized in Table 2. Here, we assume a 10 year equipment lifetime, although depreciation rates of 5 to 7 years are often used to maximize financial efficiency (i.e. to reduce soft costs due to tax adjustments, etc.).38,39 An accurate plant cost estimate depends on location and total area. For our estimate, therefore, we simply assume a plant cost of four times the total equipment cost, with an additional 10% contingency for waste handling.22,40 The machine platform comprises a skeletal support structure and R2R web manipulation components including rollers, tensioning systems, motors, etc. Printing and slot-die coating stations include baking ovens for thermal annealing the films after coating. Scribing and test/sort equipment costs were estimated by proportionally scaling the lamination station cost.23 Assumptions for labor, utilities cost and production parameters are provided in Table 3. A 5 m min−1 roll translation speed during deposition ensures stable thickness and quality control of each layer.23,38,39 Considering a 1 m web width and 5% roll preparation time during the manufacturing cycle, the annual PV module production area is 2.25 × 106 m2, assuming 11 month per year and 24 h d−1 utilization. This production rate corresponds to ∼160 MW y−1 production, assuming a base case module performance of GFF = 70%, ηinv = 95% and PCE = 10%, which is consistent with recent advances in ST-OPV efficiency of nearly 11% (ref. 14) and a reported opaque OPV module efficiency of 14%.13 Here, GFF = 70% is a conservative estimate that allows room for inter-cell contacts, and window structures outside of the viewing area. We also assume one unskilled personnel per each lamination, splicing and scribing station, and one skilled personnel per each coating and printing station, resulting in a total of 6 unskilled labor and 5 skilled labor per production line. With 55% employee benefits, $15 per h and $20 per h unskilled and skilled wages, the annual labor costs are $1.2MM and $1.3MM, respectively. As our estimate is not at a stage to confirm detailed manpower cost such as marketing, human resources, legal or financial cost, the marketing and selling costs are included in the 10% miscellaneous cost. Additional labor might be required when detailed manpower structures are confirmed. We include electricity costs of $83K per year for sputtering and $44K per year for coating and printing utilities support based on estimated power consumption and an industrial electricity costs of $0.07 per kW per h.41 Lamination, splicing and testing/sorting stations are assumed to use half the power of the coating and printing stations. Additional utilities costs such as process chilled water are $100K per system per year. Maintenance of $10K per year is assumed for each station.

With these assumptions, the manufacturing cost is calculated by dividing the total cost for annual production by the area produced, as listed in Table 4. Materials costs for each layer is the product of the amount of material required, and the source material cost based on weight, assuming 80% material utilization efficiency for solution processed layers, and 25% for sputtered layers.38,39 Since active layer materials costs are unavailable in volume quantities, we estimate the bulk organic semiconductor cost based on $31 per g per synthesis step, times number of steps required.42 A three-step synthesis of PTB7-Th,43 and five-step synthesis of BT-CIC32,33 for a PTB7-Th:BT-CIC 1:1.5 mixture results in $130.2 per g. Using the density of the mixture after annealing, and an active layer thickness of 160 nm, we obtain $29.67 per m2 for the active layer materials. Materials cost estimates for ITO on PET, barrier substrates, ZnO, MoO3, and Ag are provided in ESI, Table 1.†

The optical coating structure depends on the location and orientation of the installation. We estimate the cost of the coating by subtracting the cost of glass without coating ($3 per m2), from the cost of glass with an anti-reflective coating ($7 per m2).44 A microinverter is required to combine the outputs of several photovoltaic modules into the ac power line of the building to compensate for non-uniform solar illumination on each module.26 For a 2 m × 1 m module comprising an array of series and parallel connected 2 cm × 2 cm cells, each with an open circuit voltage of 0.7 V and short circuit current of 16 mA cm−2 for APT = 50%,15 we estimate a 16 Adc and 34 Vdc maximum module output. We use an inverter price of $52 per m2 estimated by applying a 20% bulk purchase discount from the commercial price.45 With an additional 10% miscellaneous cost premium, we arrive at a total module cost estimate of $48.96 per m2 and $106.16 per m2 without and with the inverter, respectively.
Although our materials cost estimates are as realistic as possible at this time, we nevertheless expect a ±30% error for active layer and optical layer coatings, considering the lack of information on bulk-production active layer materials cost, and location and orientation dependence of the window. We expect a potential ± 20% error for other PV layers due to cost variations between different vendors, and the expected purchase volume. A sensitivity chart according to the estimated errors is shown in ESI, Fig. 1.†
III. Discussion
Our analysis indicates that materials cost comprises ∼90% of total PV module manufacturing cost. This result agrees with previous analyses normalized to our production levels that indicate the material costs are dominant, accounting for 90–98% of total module cost.20–24 Due to high R2R system throughput, the fixed costs scale inversely, whereas material and microinverter costs scale linearly with the area produced. Indeed, this conclusion is consistent with other volume-manufactured PV technologies where materials are found to consume a large fraction of the total system cost.30,44,46,47 The production of 160 MW y−1 can lead to additional costs for handling and warehousing; considerations needed to refine future cost estimates.

Fig. 5(a) shows a potential scenario in materials cost reduction without including the 10% miscellaneous cost contribution. The most expensive device component is its active layer due to its thickness, and the several steps used in materials synthesis. If the materials require only a 2-step synthesis, the materials cost can be reduced by 38%. The ITO on PET anode and the optical coating are the next most expensive contributions. This suggests that development of cost-effective, flexible and transparent contacts is an important challenge to be met for reducing ST-OPV costs. With the assumption of 50% future reduction in the bottom contact, optics and barrier substrate costs, the total materials cost is reduced by additional 11%. PV glass cost including the module, inverter and miscellaneous costs compared with double-pane windows27–29 is shown in Fig. 5(b). Initial estimates suggest that PV glass is approximately twice as expensive as an average double-pane window. With modestly improved cost efficiencies, the additional cost from PV module integration can be only ∼60% of the average, uninstalled windows cost. Another important factor to consider is that double-pane windows are priced between $50 per m2–$200 per m2, from low-end to high-end models.27–29 Considering that power generating windows will be positioned as high-end products, the PV module cost can range from 33% to as low as 25% of the total installed power generating window cost.
 Fig. 5  Waterfall diagrams showing (a) materials cost in manufacturing ST-OPV modules with the impacts of several cost reduction scenarios, and (b) total PV glass cost including the window panes and the impacts of several cost reduction scenarios. 
The module cost including the microinverter is shown in Fig. 6. Additional simplifications in materials synthesis and a 50% reduction in microinverter costs changes the module cost from a base case of $1.6 per Wp, to $1.16 per Wp. Provided that ST-OPV lab efficiency is increased to yield a module PCE = 15% and GFF = 90%, the cost further reduces to $0.47 per Wp. These realistic improvements in performance in the near future suggest that the production cost of ST-OPVs can be on par with Si photovoltaics.30

To estimate the economic feasibility of ST-OPV windows, we simulate annual power generation from a BIPV module with PCE = 15%, GFF = 90% using the PV-GIS tool48 in multiple regions across the U.S., from latitudes 27° to 48°. For comparison, a calculation based on the annual solar path assuming uniform, AM 1.5G solar irradiance of 800 W m−2 is also provided to show the latitude dependence without effects of weather or altitude of different locations.46
Five different configurations were modelled: east and south facing windows, east and south facing 45° tilted surfaces, and the optimal orientation determined by the PV-GIS tool. The data points in Fig. 7 show the estimate based on annual solar irradiance data, whereas dashed lines show calculations based on uniform irradiance throughout the year. Bars centered at each data point allow for variants in altitude differences within the regions at the same latitude.
 Fig. 7  Simulated annual power generation from ST-OPV windows vs. latitude. The calculations are shown for different module orientations, and are based on annual solar irradiance from the PV-GIS tool (data points), and based on uniform, AM 1.5G, 800 W m−2 (peak) solar irradiance (dashed lines). The vertical bars for each data point account for variations in average cloud cover and altitudes at different locations within a given latitude. 
There is only a small dependence of annual power generation on latitude for south facing, 45° tilted surfaces, and east facing windows. East facing 45° tilted surfaces show a monotonic decrease, and south facing windows show an increase of power generation with increasing latitude. With the module cost estimate of $55.52 per m2, and a typical residential electricity cost of $0.13 per kW per h,41 the payback period of the ST-OPV window module ranges from 2 to 6 years, depending on the location and orientation of the installation.
IV. Conclusion
Our study of the manufacturing cost for ST-OPV modules used in power generating windows suggests that high throughput R2R manufacturing can potentially enable large scale production of economically feasible and visually attractive building applied solar harvesting appliances. A principal conclusion of our analysis is that materials and microinverter costs are the dominant contributors to total module cost, significantly overtaking the costs of equipment and other miscellaneous operational costs. Starting from $1.6 per Wp estimate based on current ST-OPV performance, we expect the cost could be as low as $0.47 per Wp with modest future improvements in module performance and production cost reductions. When used in high end, double-pane thermally insulating windows, we anticipate an average energy payback period of 2 to 6 years, depending on the location, window orientation and local electricity cost of the installation.
