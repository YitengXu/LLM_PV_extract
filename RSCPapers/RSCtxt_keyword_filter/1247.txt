    , Accepted 6th February 2023First published on 7th February 2023AbstractThe photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is determined by the morphology and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films. The Ostwald ripening process is a promising strategy to enhance the quality of perovskite films. Herein, a novel solvent bath annealing (SBA) treatment is developed to introduce Ostwald ripening of perovskite films in a liquid-phase solvent bath. A mixed solvent containing a poor solvent and a small amount of good solvent for perovskite is the key to inducing perovskite grain growth during SBA treatment. During the SBA process, the diffusion length of the perovskite–solvent complex is extended by the poor solvent liquid, which allows the grain size to increase significantly from 100 to 600 nm, accompanied by improved crystallinity. The SBA process further enables defect passivation and hydrophobic modification of the perovskite film when 1H,1H-perfluorooctylamine additive is added in the solvent bath. The carrier lifetime was improved from 137 to 428 ns due to the reduced defect density. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is improved from 18.43% to 20.86% by the SBA process. The device retained 86% of its initial PCE after exposure to a high humidity environment (RH = 85%) for 300 h. Our work exhibits a promising strategy for large-scale modification of perovskite films for efficient PSC fabrication.
1. Introduction
Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted significant attention due to their high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, tunable band gap, easy fabrication and high compatibility with flexible devices.1,2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has exceeded 25%, demonstrating their bright prospects as next generation low-cost photovoltaics.3–6 The PCE and stability performance of PSCs are strongly related to the morphology and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films, which heavily depend on the fabrication process. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the quality of the perovskite film through optimization of the film deposition and posttreatment processes to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.7–9 Generally, high-quality perovskite films have the characteristics of large grain size to reduce grain boundaries, high crystallinity to offer good optoelectronic properties and high uniformity and compactness to avoid shunting paths.10–12 Depositing a uniform perovskite film requires fast removal of solvents from the precursor solution through antisolvent quenching, gas blowing or heating. Although these strategies can generate uniform films over a large area, fast crystallization usually leads to small grains and poor crystallinity. High-density grain boundaries can cause nonradiative carrier recombination and introduce water penetration paths in perovskite films, which are detrimental to the performance and stability of PSCs.13–16
High-quality perovskite films with large grains and good crystallinity can be achieved by tuning the nucleation and growth rate through solvent and additive engineering.17,18 Typically, film quality is enhanced by forming Lewis acid–base complex intermediate phases between the perovskite and solvents or additives to slow down the nucleation rate and promote grain growth.19 Various solvents have been demonstrated to form intermediate phases with perovskite materials, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),20 tetramethylene sulfoxide (TMSO)21 and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).22 Recrystallization through posttreatment is also an effective way to improve the quality of the film after film deposition.23,24 Organic halide salt- and solvent-assisted post annealing steps have been applied to perovskite films, which induces Ostwald ripening in perovskite films and thus improves the film quality.25–28 Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) has been shown to be an effective strategy to induce Ostwald ripening in perovskite films. Huang et al. reported an N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent vapor-assisted annealing process to promote grain growth and produce larger grain sizes, in which DMF vapor allows fast mass transport over longer distances than conventional thermal annealing (TA).29 Moreover, alcohols,30,31 methylammonium chloride,32 methylammonium iodide,33 hydrochloric acid,34 triethylenetetramine,35etc. can also be used in solvent vapor annealing processes. Nevertheless, it is difficult to precisely control the vapor pressure in closed containers (usually Petri dishes) during SVA processes. Inhomogeneous solvent vapor distribution and insufficient/excessive solvent vapor lead to poor reproducibility during SVA processes. Although solvent vapor promotes mass diffusion and transport, Ostwald ripening is usually restricted to the surface of films during the SVA process. Therefore, it is in high demand to develop an effective and reproducible solvent-assisted post annealing process to achieve uniform and high-quality perovskite films. Zhou et al. reported a “liquid medium annealing” process, which provides a uniform heating field to promote uniform growth of perovskite films, providing a reproducible method for all-weather fabrication of high-quality perovskite films.36
Herein, we develop a new liquid medium-assisted Ostwald ripening process called solvent bath annealing (SBA) to achieve high-quality perovskite films for efficient and stable PSCs. In brief, perovskite films are immersed in a mixture solvent containing a poor perovskite solvent as a liquid phase heating and mass transport medium and a small amount of good perovskite solvent to induce Ostwald ripening in perovskite films. The good perovskite solvent, e.g., DMF, forms a perovskite–DMF complex to enable dissolution and recrystallization of perovskite crystals during the SBA process. The liquid convection of the poor perovskite solvent offers a medium to achieve uniform heating and DMF distribution. The solvent bath also promotes the diffusion of the perovskite–DMF complex in the liquid phase, which enhances the Ostwald ripening process. The average grain size of the perovskite film is increased from 100 nm to 600 nm after the SBA process, and the crystallinity of the perovskite film is greatly improved. The SBA process is compatible with posttreatments that involve additives in anti-solvents. We further demonstrated that by incorporating 1H,1H-perfluorooctylamine (PFA) in the SBA process, the perovskite surface is effectively passivated and becomes hydrophobic. The PCE of PSCs prepared with the PFA-SBA process is improved from 18.43% to 20.86%. Meanwhile, with the enhanced hydrophobicity by the PFA-SBA process, the treated PSCs retained 80% of their initial PCE after exposure to a high RH (relative humidity) of 85% for 300 h, while the PCE of the control device dropped to 40% of the initial value after 60 h under the same conditions. Our work demonstrates a facile posttreatment of perovskite films to improve the PCE, stability and reproducibility of PSCs through the liquid phase Ostwald ripening process, exhibiting great prospects for the large-scale fabrication of efficient PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
A schematic diagram of the SBA process is displayed in Fig. 1. In brief, the as-deposited perovskite film is immersed in a mixed solvent containing a nonpolar solvent and a small amount of good perovskite solvent and then annealed at 100 °C. Among the mixed solvent systems, chlorobenzene (CB) is chosen as the nonpolar solvent because of its low solubility for perovskite materials. In the conventional thermal annealing (TA) process, the perovskite film receives heat only from the underneath hot plate. In the SBA process, chlorobenzene functions as a heat conduction medium with convectional uniform heating (Fig. 1a). In addition, the liquid medium in the SBA also provides a closed space to prevent reactant loss and reduce the interference of water and oxygen in the ambient environment.36

Ostwald ripening is a process in which small crystals gradually disappear, and large grains continue to grow larger. The smaller grains in the film possess a higher Gibbs energy at the grain boundary. Thus, the mass in the smaller grains continuously migrates to and recrystallizes at the edge of large grains (as depicted by Fig. 1b) to reduce the total Gibbs energy of the film. Therefore, Ostwald ripening can enlarge the grain size and enhance the crystallinity of perovskite films. Ostwald ripening can be achieved through conventional thermal annealing (TA), but crystal growth during the TA process usually faces high energy barriers for solid-state diffusion. During the solvent vapor annealing (SVA) process, the perovskite material is dissolved in the thin solvent layer and recrystallized at larger grains. Typically, perovskite dissolution occurs through the formation of a perovskite–solvent complex with coordination bonds.37,38 Therefore, strong chemical interactions between solvent molecules and perovskite materials are vital to the Ostwald ripening process.39–41 The SBA process uses similar polar solvents to that used in SVA, but the nonpolar solvent (CB) serves as a liquid medium to support mass transport. Instead of transport through the thin liquid layer on the film surface, the perovskite–solvent complex can be transported through a large volume liquid medium in the SBA process. The perovskite–solvent complex would achieve a longer diffusion length in the liquid medium, which is different from the SVA process. The convection of CB also homogenizes the transport of the perovskite–solvent complex. Therefore, SBA-induced Ostwald ripening can be faster and more uniform.
The chemical interactions between DMF and the perovskite were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As shown in Fig. 1c, the carbonyl group (CO) vibration peak of DMF shifts from 1661 cm−1 to a lower wavenumber of 1635 cm−1 when PbI2 is added due to the formation of the PbI2–DMF complex through Pb–O coordination.42 In the mixed solvent of DMF/CB, the CO vibration peak of DMF shifts to 1682 cm−1 due to the induced effect from CB.43 The CO vibration peak of DMF consistently shifts to a lower wavenumber with PbI2 in the DMF/CB mixed solvent, suggesting that the PbI2–DMF complex also forms in the DMF/CB mixed solvent. In addition, in both pure DMF and DMF/CB mixed solvent, the interaction between DMF and MAI through hydrogen bonds results in the amino group (N–H) vibration peak at 970 cm−1 (Fig. 1d), indicating the formation of the MAI–DMF complex. Therefore, the two precursor materials of MAPbI3 perovskite, i.e., PbI2 and MAI, both have strong chemical interactions with DMF molecules in the SBA process, which promotes dissolution and recrystallization in the Ostwald ripening process.
Mixed solvents play a vital role in the effects of SBA processes. The typical solvent for the perovskite precursor solution DMF has strong chemical interactions with both PbI2 and the organic halide. In contrast, isopropanol (IPA) is a poor solvent for PbI2, indicating a weak chemical interaction with PbI2. Fig. S1a† shows the solubility of perovskite films in SBA solvents with different solvent additives (1% DMF or 1% IPA). The IPA/CB solvent was clear after SBA treatment. While the DMF/CB solvent became dark yellow, indicating that the perovskite was partly dissolved in the DMF/CB mixed solvent. The solvents were dried after SBA post treatment. The vial of IPA/CB remains clear, while the vial of DMF/CB contains solid residues. The drying weight of the solvents (Fig. S1b and c†) showed that more solid residue was left in the DMF/CB vial (0.64 wt%) than in the IPA/CB vial (0.14 wt%). The dried powder in DMF/CB was confirmed to be perovskite using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S1d†). The results show that the additive solvent needs to be a good solvent for both PbI2 and organic halide to dissolve the perovskite material and enable Ostwald ripening in the SBA process.
To further understand the effect of solvents in the SBA process, seven solvents with increasing polarity were selected as solvent additives in the SBA process. They were IPA (4.3), methyl isopropyl ketone (MIPK) (4.5), acetone (5.4), acetonitrile (6.2), DMF (6.4), methanol (6.6) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (7.2). The solubilities of MAI and PbI2 in those solvents were measured (Fig. 2i). From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 2a–h, it is found that the grain size does not increase when the solvent is only good solvent for MAI but poor solvent for PbI2 (IPA, acetone, acetonitrile, and methanol). The perovskite crystal grows only when the solvent has good solubility for both MAI and PbI2, such as MIPK, DMF and DMSO. The grain sizes of the SBA-DMF and SBA-DMSO films are larger than that of SBA-MIPK, which may be due to the higher solubility of DMF and DMSO for MAI and PbI2. Since FAI is the main component of perovskite in this paper, the solubility of FAI in different polar solvents was also measured (Table S1†). FAI and MAI have similar solubility in polar solvents. The results show that the stronger the interaction of the solvent with PbI2 and organic halide, the larger the crystal size. We also employed MIPK and methanol together as solvent additives in the SBA process (Fig. S2†). It is found that the grain size of the SBA-MIPK-methanol treated film is further increased compared with that of SBA-MIPK. The good solubility of MAI in methanol makes up for the poor solubility of MAI in MIPK and results in better crystal growth. The results show that strong interactions between the solvents and the constituents of perovskite materials (PbI2 and MAI in our case) are key to the crystal growth in the SBA treatment.

The solubility was classified into three categories: good (green) with S ≥ 10; medium (yellow) with 0.1 ≤ S < 10; poor (red) with S ≤ 0.1. 
PSCs were fabricated with perovskite films treated by SBA processes with different polar solvents. The influences of additive solvents on the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Fig. S3.† It is observed that the PSCs with DMF- or DMSO-based SBA processes exhibit higher short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and PCE than the devices with IPA-based SBA processes (Fig. S3†). Although polar solvents with higher polarity (e.g. DMSO) produce larger grain sizes, pinholes also form after the SBA treatment, which may reduce the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and FF of the PSCs. Therefore, DMF was selected as the additive solvent for SBA treatment in this work, due to its appropriate solubility and interactions with both the PbI2 and organic halide salts.
The morphologies of perovskite films by the three different annealing processes TA, SVA and SBA are compared. The top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films are shown in Fig. 3a–c. For the TA process, the perovskite film is composed of small grains with an average grain size of 100 nm, and there is a thin layer of small grains on top of the perovskite film, which should be a result of the fast solvent quenching by anti-solvent dripping during spin coating. The small grain size in the perovskite film may hinder charge transport, induce nonradiative recombination and cause J–V hysteresis,44 deteriorating the PSC performance. The average grain size of the perovskite film increases to 260 nm after the SVA process, and the small crystals at the surface are mostly removed. The crystal growth induced by solvent vapor is consistent with previous reports.29–31 The grain size of the perovskite film after SBA treatment is significantly higher than that of the TA and SVA treatments. The average grain size increased to 600 nm, with some grains exceeding 1 μm. In addition to lateral grain growth, the SBA treatment transformed the grains into columnar grains in the vertical direction, which can reduce the carrier transport barrier in the vertical direction in PSCs.29,45,46 The change in the perovskite grain size with annealing time is shown in Fig. 3d and S4.† With the TA process, the perovskite grain size grows rapidly within 15 min and increases slowly thereafter due to the slow diffusion in the solid state. With SVA, the grain growth continues for a longer time to 45 min and saturates at larger sizes. The grain growth slows down after prolonged heating, which should be due to the gradual loss of solvent vapor through the unsealed Petri dish cover. In comparison, the grain growth continued for more than 75 min, and the grain size increased after the SBA treatment. This is because of the larger amount of polar solvent and better sealing in the SBA process. Fig. S5† shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of perovskite films based on TA, SVA, and SBA with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 14.1, 20.9 and 25.3 nm, respectively. The larger roughness of SVA and SBA films is due to the larger grain size of the films. The grain size is obviously more uniform in the SBA films than the SVA film. The results demonstrate that the liquid medium in the SBA process enhances Ostwald ripening by promoting the transport of the perovskite–DMF complex in the liquid phase.

To further study the influence of the SBA process on the crystallinity of the perovskite films, X-ray diffraction characterization was conducted. As shown in Fig. 3f, three strong characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.1°, 28.5° and 31.9° are present in all XRD patterns, corresponding to the (110), (220) and (310) planes of the perovskite crystal structure.30,47 The full width at the half maximum (FWHM) of TA, SVA and SBA at 2θ = 14.1° is 0.56°, 0.52° and 0.47°, respectively. A smaller FWHM indicates larger perovskite grains in the film with the SBA process, which is consistent with the SEM results.48 Meanwhile, the intensity ratio of the (110)/(112) plane is increased from 5.1 for the TA film to 5.9 for the SVA film and 8.3 for the SBA film. The higher relative intensity of the (110) plane in the SBA-treated film suggests a preferable orientation of the perovskite crystals.40,49 In addition, the peak at 2θ = 12.8° attributed to the excess PbI2 in the perovskite films disappears from the SBA-treated film, which is also consistent with the SEM observations.31 Bright plate-shaped particles are observed at the grain boundaries of the TA- and SVA-treated films, which can be attributed to the residual PbI2 in the perovskite films (Fig. 3a and b).50 The plate-like PbI2 particles clearly disappear from the SBA-treated film. The residual PbI2 is removed due to the strong chemical bonding between the DMF molecule and PbI2. Therefore, the perovskite film shows enhanced crystallinity and a more preferable orientation with less impurity after the SBA process.
The perovskite films show a larger grain size and better crystallinity after the SBA process, which can in turn change the performance of the resulting PSCs. PSCs are fabricated with a device structure of ITO/SnO2/Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Fig. 4a and b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the statistics of PCEs of PSCs based on the TA, SVA and SBA processes (denoted as TA-PSCs, SVA-PSCs and SBA-PSCs, respectively). The SBA-PSCs exhibit the highest PCE with a Voc of 1.12 V, a Jsc of 23.14 mA cm−2, an FF of 78.06% and a PCE of 20.25%, while the PCEs of the TA-PSCs and SVA-PSCs are lower at 18.43% and 19.27%, respectively. As shown in Fig. S6,† the performance improvement of SBA-PSCs mainly comes from the Jsc (23.14 mA cm−2), which can be attributed to the improved absorption of the SBA films (Fig. 4f). The higher absorption could be due to the enhanced perovskite film quality benefiting from vertical single grains and enlarged grain size.30,51 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 4c. The integrated photocurrent densities of TA-PSCs and SBA-PSCs are 22.01 mA cm−2 and 22.91 mA cm−2, respectively, which are close to the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. The EQE of SBA-PSCs outperforms that of the TA-PSCs in the wavelength range of 350 to 750 nm and exceeds 80%, consistent with the absorption improvement. The J–V hysteresis of TA and SBA-PSCs is shown in Fig. S7.† The SBA-PSC shows a smaller J–V hysteresis. The steady-state output current densities of the TA-PSCs and SBA-PSCs are 22.31 and 23.29 mA cm−2, corresponding to steady-state output PCEs of 18.09% and 20.01%, respectively (Fig. 4d). The J–V hysteresis and stable output results confirm the reliability of the J–V measurements.

(c) EQE spectra, (d) steady-state output at the maximum power point and (e) dark J–V curves of the TA-PSCs and SBA-PSCs. (f) Absorption and PL spectra of the TA- and SBA-treated perovskite films. 

Fig. 4e shows the dark J–V curves of the TA-PSCs and SBA-PSCs. The SBA-PSCs show a lower leakage current at negative bias and smaller series resistance at high positive bias. This can be attributed to the improved film quality and reduced defect density in the SBA films.30,31 The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite films after the SBA process are characterized and shown in Fig. 4f. The absorption spectra show almost identical absorption edges, indicating that the SBA process does not change the composition and bandgap of the perovskite films. The light absorption of the SBA-treated film is higher than that of the TA-treated film, which explains the higher EQE and Jsc of the SBA-PSCs. Since the two perovskite films have similar thicknesses, the higher absorption can be attributed to the higher perovskite film quality with a larger grain size and more backscattering due to the rougher film surface after the SBA treatment. The steady-state PL intensity of the SBA-treated perovskite film is also much higher than that of the TA-treated film, indicating a reduced defect density from the SBA process.52
A suitable DMF concentration in the mixed solvents of SBA processes is essential to achieve high performance in the SBA-PSCs. The film morphology and photovoltaic performance of SBA-PSCs with different DMF concentrations are shown in Fig. S8 and S9.† When the DMF volume ratio increases from 0 to 1%, the perovskite grains grow gradually. The film with 1% DMF shows larger grains as well as the best compactness and uniformity. With higher DMF concentration in the SBA solvent, the grain size only increases slightly, but the film starts to show pinholes and cracks, affecting the film compactness. When the concentration is further increased to 4%, the perovskite film is partially dissolved by the excessive DMF. Fig. S9 and Table S2† show the PCE of PSCs treated with different DMF concentrations, and the 1% DMF device shows the highest PCE.
Passivation is an effective way to improve the performance and stability of PSCs. Many passivation agents are introduced into PSCs through additives in the anti-solvent during the spin coating process.53–55 Since the main part of the solvent in SBA is a poor solvent of perovskite which can be also used as an anti-solvent during spin coating. It is natural to consider adding a passivation agent to the SBA solvent to passivate the perovskite films. Here, we demonstrate that the SBA process not only can improve the film quality through Ostwald ripening but also can perform surface passivation by introducing passivation agents in the solvent bath. 1H,1H-perfluorooctylamine (PFA) is taken as an example, which is introduced into the mixed solvent for the SBA process (denoted as PFA-SBA), as depicted in Fig. 5a. The molecular structure of PFA is also shown in Fig. S10a.† Fig. S11† shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of perovskite films based on TA and SBA-PFA. The two main peaks of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 at 138.3 and 143.1 eV both shifted to lower energy after PFA treatment. The two small Pb0 peaks at 136.6 and 141.4 eV disappeared. This should be due to the amino groups in PFA that act as a Lewis base to coordinate with the unsaturated Pb2+ to passivate the defects of the perovskite film.54 Moreover, the two peaks of I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2 at 619.1 and 630.6 eV also shifted to lower binding energy after PFA treatment, which is due to hydrogen bonds (N–H·····I) formed between amino groups and I− in the perovskite (Fig. S11†).56 The fluorinated alkyl chain can increase the hydrophobicity of the perovskite films, therefore improving their humidity stability. The water contact angle of the perovskite film increased from 53.8° of the TA film and 65.3° of the SBA film to 82.2° after the PFA-SBA treatment as shown in Fig. 5b. The PFA modification of perovskite films is confirmed by the XPS of the PFA-SBA treated films in Fig. 5c. The peak near 685.7 eV corresponds to the F1s peak,54 which proves that F exists on the surface of the perovskite film after the PFA-SBA treatment.

SEM results show that adding PFA to the SBA process does not alter the grain growth process by Ostwald ripening (Fig. S10b†). PFA is an insulating molecule that can hinder charge transport if the passivation layer is too thick. The concentration of PFA was optimized to achieve the best modification effect to the perovskite film, and detailed information is shown in Fig. S12 and Table S3.† At a concentration of 15 mg mL−1, the champion device treated with PFA-SBA achieves a Voc of 1.14 V, a Jsc of 23.73 mA cm−2, an FF of 77.1%, yielding a high PCE of 20.86% (Fig. 5d). The photovoltaic parameters of the best PSC device with TA, SBA and PFA-SBA treatments are summarized in Table S4.† It is worth mentioning that the hysteresis index of the PFA-SBA PSC dropped to negligible 2.4% compared to 7.3% of the TA-PSCs (Fig. S7 and S13†) benefiting from the passivation effect of PFA. Fig. 5e shows the EQE spectra of the device based on TA and PFA-SBA. The integrated photocurrent density of the PFA-SBA-based PSC is 23.28 mA cm−2, consistent with the JSC from the J–V curve. The EQE of the PFA-SBA-based PSC is higher than that of the TA device over the whole response range, suggesting successful passivation of the PFA molecule. The PFA-SBA-based PSCs demonstrate better stability at the maximum power point (Fig. S14a†) and reduced dark current compared with TA-PSCs (Fig. S14b†).
The improvement of PFA-SBA-based PSCs originates from the enhanced optoelectronic properties by SBA treatment and PFA passivation. The optical absorption of the PFA-SBA film is slightly higher than that of the TA and SBA perovskite films (Fig. S14c†). The PL intensity is further enhanced by the PFA-SBA treatment, suggesting that the nonradioactive recombination is suppressed due to defect passivation of PFA (Fig. S14d†). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was performed (Fig. 5f) to study the carrier dynamics in the perovskite film, with the fitting information presented in Table S5.† The average carrier lifetime is 137 ns for the TA-treated perovskite film, while the lifetime is extended to 396 ns after SBA treatment and 428 ns after PFA-SBA treatment. A longer τ1 (68 ns) indicates that the trap density on the film surface is reduced by PFA-SBA treatment.57 The defect density of the perovskite films is also characterized by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 5g) with a device structure of ITO/NiOx/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The VTFL values of films treated with TA, SBA and PFA-SBA are 0.11, 0.16 and 0.22 V, respectively. The lower VTFL suggests a lower defect density. As summarized in Table S6,† the defect density of the PFA-SBA-treated film is 3.04 × 1014 cm−3, which is much lower than that of the SBA-treated film (4.15 × 1014 cm−3) and the TA-treated film (6.09 × 1014 cm−3).58,59 The impressive performance improvement of PFA-SBA-treated PSCs originates from the prolonged carrier lifetime and reduced nonradiative recombination, benefiting from both PFA passivation and enhanced film quality through the liquid phase Ostwald ripening process.
Apart from the PCE improvement, the stability performance is enhanced by the PFA-SBA process simultaneously, benefiting from the hydrophobic fluorocarbon chain in PFA. We characterized the humidity stability of devices at a high relative humidity of 85% (Fig. 5h). The humidity stability is greatly enhanced by the PFA-SBA treatment. The PCE of the TA-PSC decayed sharply to below 40% of the initial value within 60 h, while the PFA-SBA-PSC could still maintain 86% of the initial PCE after 300 hours. PFA-SBA effectively improves the hydrophobicity of the film, thereby enhancing the device durability in a humid environment. The stability improvement can be further attributed to grain growth and defect passivation of the PFA-SBA treatment, which suppresses water and oxygen penetration through defects.60
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we developed a novel liquid-phase Ostwald ripening process through a SBA process. By mixing a small amount of polar solvent in the poor perovskite solvent for the solvent bath, the SBA process can increase the grain size and crystallinity of perovskite films. The polar solvent to introduce Ostwald ripening needs to present strong interactions with both PbI2 and organic halides. The grain size of the perovskite film notably increases owing to the enhanced diffusion of the perovskite–solvent complex in the liquid medium. Meanwhile, the crystallinity of the perovskite film is improved with more orientated perovskite crystals. Benefiting from the enhanced optoelectronic properties, the champion PCE of PSCs increased from 18.43% to 20.25% after the SBA process. Moreover, introducing a perovskite passivation agent PFA into the SBA process can further passivate the defects in the perovskite film and modify the film surface to be hydrophobic, thereby improving the PCE and humidity stability of PSCs. The PSCs with PFA-SBA retain 86% of their initial PCE after exposure to an environment with a high RH of 85% for 300 h. The SBA approach has the advantages of high reproducibility, low cost, and facile process, which provides promising prospects for large-scale production and commercial application of efficient PSCs.
