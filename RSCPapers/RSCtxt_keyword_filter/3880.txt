, Accepted 14th July 2016First published on 15th July 2016AbstractWe report density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations on a novel organic ligand and a novel class of ruthenium complexes; cis-RuL2X2 with L = 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-bis ethyl ester phosphonate and phosphonic acid, X = Cl, CN or NCS. The calculations show that cis-configurations are more stable than the trans-counterparts. The DFT results have been used to help design such novel complexes for potential use as sensitizers. We demonstrate the opportunity to synthesize such complexes with high purity. The synthesis of these complexes relies on the preparation of the key intermediates cis-Ru(2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-bisdiethyl ester phosphonate)Cl2. These complexes were characterized by 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR, elemental analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. The NCS complex shows the smallest optical band gap followed by the Cl and CN complexes, respectively, with the highest performance upon use as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells.
1. Introduction
With the looming energy crisis and the depletion of petroleum and natural-gas reserves, various ways have been investigated to convert sunlight directly into chemical fuel or electricity.1 However, the capital cost of such devices is still inconvenient for large-scale implementation. To this end, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their high quantum efficiency giving the opportunity of low-cost conversion of solar energy into electrical power.2 The ongoing research into DSSCs is mainly focused on the optimization of all cell components; namely, the photoactive material, the dye and the redox electrolyte.3
The development of optically active sensitizers over a wide region of the solar spectrum is a hot topic nowadays. In particular, ruthenium (Ru)-based complexes have been extensively used as sensitizers.4,5 Ruthenium metal has been particularly investigated for a number of reasons:6 (1) it has octahedral geometry that enable the introduction of specific ligands in a controlled manner; (2) it forms very inert bonds with imine nitrogen centers; (3) it possesses various stable and accessible oxidation states. However, the main problem limiting the further development of sensitizers is the fact that dyes with high absorption coefficients has narrow bands and vice versa. Consequently, the optimization of sensitizers is mainly based on “guess-and-check” procedures. A more systematic approach is required in order to find optimum sensitizers with the required specifications. In this regard, density function theory (DFT) calculations are considered ideal to solve the “guess-and-check” problem involved in the design of DSSCs as well as solar hydrogen production systems. Specifically, it can be used to study the changes in the optical and electronic structures of the sensitizers.
Herein, we report detailed DFT calculations on new cis-ruthenium complexes with coordinated bipyridine bisphosphonate ligands. Our DFT findings were confirmed via the preparation and characterization of such sensitizers and their use in dye-sensitized solar cell devices.
2. Computational and experimental methods and materials
2.1 Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory
The molecular geometry for all complexes and ligands was fully optimized using 6-31+G mixed basis sets for C, H, N, O, P, Cl and S atoms and effective core potential LANL2/LANL2DZ basis set7–10 for Ru atom with the density functional (DFT) level. The DFT calculations were carried out using the hybrid three-parameter density functional method abbreviated as B3LYP, which includes Becke's 3-parameter gradient exchange correction function (B3)11 and the Lee, Yang and Parr correlation functional.12,13 The B3LYP method typically provides energetic better than Hartree–Fock method14 and can reproduce better geometrical parameters comparable to the experimental values than any other method.15 No symmetry constrains were implemented during all the geometry optimization procedures. All possible configurations for the complexes were calculated and the one shown here is the lowest in energy or the global minimum for each complex. All the geometry optimization, vibrational frequency calculations were done using the Gaussian 09 software package.16 The optimized structures were visualized using Chemcraft version 1.6 packages.17 The bond dissociation energy of A–B bond is calculated by subtracting the total energy of the optimized geometry for AB molecule from single point energy of its constituents A and B at the same geometry, which is more accurate than substring it from optimized energy of isolated molecules as this would include some part of possible conformation relaxation energy changes. Ionization potential and electron affinity of cation and anion total energy subtracted from neutral total energy at optimized geometry without further optimization as electron movements are assumed to be faster than nuclear ones. Time-dependent DFT calculations were done on optimized geometry using number of excited states equal to 10. Exciton binding energies were estimated by the difference between LUMO and HOMO in DFT and in TD-DFT calculation. The electronic absorption spectra were created using convolution with Gaussian function using Gauss View Software18 using UV-Vis peak Half-Width at half height of 0.1 eV.

3. Results and discussion
The optimized geometry of the cis- and trans-configurations of the synthetized sensitizers is shown in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively with their energetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Our calculations showed that cis-configurations are more stable than the trans-counterparts. The PO bond length was calculated to be 1.49 Å in all complexes. The Ru–N bond (connected to the organic part) length was found to be similar in all complexes with a range from 2.15 Å to 2.20 Å. Furthermore, the difference between the cis- and trans-configurations is less than 1%, indicating that the main change in bond lengths is around the Cl, CN and NCS ligands. In the cis-configurations, the Cl–Ru–Cl, NC–Ru–CN and SCN–Ru–NCS bond angles are 86.9°, 93.7° and 91.1°, respectively. On the other hand, in the trans-configurations, the Cl–Ru–Cl, NC–Ru–CN and SCN–Ru–NCS bond angles are 176.4°, 179.5° and 179.3°, respectively. In NCS complexes, the N–C–S bond angle is 177.8° and 179.5° for the cis- and trans-configurations, respectively. In case of the CN complexes, only hydrogen bonds are formed between the N of the CN group and H of phosphate group. Note that this interaction does not exist in the other two complexes. The calculations showed that two hydrogen bonds with average length of 1.77 Å are observed in the trans-configuration while only one hydrogen bond with 1.73 Å is formed in case of the cis-configuration due to geometrical orientation of the phosphate groups.

The Ru–Cl, Ru–CN and Ru–NCS bond lengths are 2.18 Å, 1.98 Å and 2.11 Å and 2.49 Å, 2.05 Å and 2.06 Å for cis- and trans-configurations, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the longer bond lengths in case of Ru–Cl may be the reason for the greater total energy difference ΔET between cis- and trans-configuration of this complex relative to the others. The energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) for the complexes under study are summarized in Table 1. The energy gap (ΔE) between ELUMO and EHOMO is inversely proportional to the reactivity of the complex. The reactivity as function of ΔE is in the order Cl > NSC > CN and NSC > Cl > CN for trans- and cis-configurations, respectively. The dipole moment of the cis-configuration is larger than that of the trans-counterpart. The bond dissociation energy between Ru metal and ligand has been calculated. The Ru–Cl, Ru–NCS and Ru–CN bond energies are 75.70, 96.19 and 118.89, and 97.63, 115.19 and 151.99 kcal mol−1 for trans- and cis-configurations, respectively. These numbers clearly show that the strength of the inorganic ligands is in the order CN > NCS > Cl. It further explains the greater stability of cis- over trans-configuration by at least 20%. On the other hand, the average Ru–N bond (where N is in the organic ligand) dissociation energies do not show that greater variance where they are 27.11, 32.89 and 35.09, and 34.13, 35.97 and 35.78 kcal mol−1 for Cl, NSC and CN complexes with trans- and cis-configurations, respectively. The NBO charges on Ru are 0.13, −.017 and −0.32 for NCS, Cl and CN complexes, respectively. The most positive charge is observed on P atom, which is almost 2.4 in all complexes. However, the most negative charge is observed on adjacent O atom in the PO with a value of about −1.1 in all complexes.
The optical parameters have been theoretically studied for the cis-conformer only and the main characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The calculation of ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) was done by subtracting the total energy of the ionic complex from neutral one at the same geometry. It is worth mentioning that the IP and EA seem to be shifted by about 1 eV relative to the EHOMO and ELUMO. In addition, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the optical electronic absorption spectra and exciton binding energies, with the detailed data represented in Table 3. The NCS complex shows the smallest optical band gap, the highest oscillator strength and the lowest exciton binging energy followed by the Cl and CN complexes, respectively, indicating a better performance for use as a sensitizer in solar cells application. The electronic absorption spectra are shown for the three complexes in Fig. 3. The CN and NCS have three bands at 385 nm, 455 nm and 505 nm, and 461 nm, 610 nm and 671 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the Cl complex spectra have almost one main band at about 530 nm and other bands seem to be overlapped underneath and appearing as shoulders. As a general trend, the HOMO and HOMO−1 orbitals are either π orbital on CN and NCS or p-orbital on the Cl along with d-orbital form Ru atom, see Fig. 4. The LUMO and LUMO+1 are π* orbital localized on one of the two bipyridine ring. The LUMO+2 and LUMO+4 are also π* orbital on both of the two bipyridine ring. Furthermore, all the calculated electronic absorption spectra involve transitions from d-orbital on metal along with orbitals on Cl, CN or NCS to orbitals on bipyridine rings.

Based on the promising DFT results, herein, we show the possibility to synthesize such complexes. However, we will limit our discussion to the cis-Ru complexes as an example. The investigated complexes are of the general formula cis-RuL2X2 with L = 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-bis(diethyl methyl phosphonate) and 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-bis(methylphosphoric acid). The preparation of this type of complexes usually involves two steps.22,23 The first complex consists of refluxing two equivalent of the bidentate ligand L with 1 equivalent of ruthenium trichloride in DMF to yield a cis-RuL2Cl2. In the second step, the diethyl phosphate was hydrolysed to phosphonic acid, and then the chloride ligands are substituted by potassium thiocyanate or potassium cyanide. This is achieved by heating in a mixture of methanol or ethanol and water to prepare complex that contains cyanide and thiocyanate. The preparation of complexes with different positions (such as 4, and 5) has been previously patented by Grätzel et al.24 However, no preparation and characterization of ligand and complexes were reported in the open literature. Herein, we report on the synthesis of new ligand and new complexes, which are shown in Scheme 1 and 2.
 Scheme 1  Reaction and conditions: (i) P-CPBA, CHCl3 at 0 °C 2 d (ii) KCN, H2O, PhCOCl, DCM, 12 h (iii) EtOH, H2SO4, reflux, 12 h (iv) NaOH, EtOH, reflux 12 h (v) NaBH4, DCM, r.t. 6 h (vi) HBr, H2SO4, reflux, 8 h (vii) P(OEt)2, CHCl3, reflux 5 h. 
 Scheme 2  Stepwise synthesis of the Ru-based complexes. 
Starting from the phosphonated bipyridine as a ligand, these complexes were prepared using Ru(DMSO)4Cl2 and RuCl3 in water to get highly pure complexes. This could be clearly seen from the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude reaction mixture that indicated a lower amount of impurities when Ru(DMSO)4Cl2 was used. This is probably due to the use of a ruthenium(II) precursor with weekly binding ligands (DMSO). A purification step was necessary to remove tris-bipyridine ruthenium complex that was formed during the reaction. The resulting complexes were purified and crystallized using column chromatography. The diethyl ester phosphonate groups were fully hydrolyzed by heating the complexes in hydrochloric acid solution. Chloride ligand exchange with thiocyanate or cyanide was subsequently performed in water with an excess of monodenate ligands. These complexes were found to be soluble in methanol and water with a larger solubility at basic pH.
The NMR spectra of the complexes were measured in D2O and CD3OD solutions to achieve sufficiently large concentrations, compatible with fast spectrum recording and high signal-to-noise ratio. The 1H NMR spectra of all complexes show six sharp and well-resolved signals in the aromatic region, corresponding to the six magnetically inequivalent protons of the bipyridine (Fig. 5). Using D2O as a solvent, the downfield shifted protons resonance peaks can be assigned to the protons H3 and H4 that are merged in one peak. On the other hand, upon using CD3OD as solvent, H3 and H4 peaks were found to be very close to each other. The assignment is based on the assumption that deshielding of the protons can be due to an induced magnetic field created by the ring current on bipyridine aromatic moieties. This deshielding is only significant at short distance and therefore affects only protons that are close to the bipyridine. In this case, we found that the complexes are cis-octahedral, with two equivalent bipyridine ligands. In complex (I) in Scheme 2, the two 6,6′-methylene phosphonate ethyl ester groups (CH2PO3Et) are inequivalent and they give rise to four multiplets. Therefore, the observed patterns are in agreement with the cis geometry of the complexes. The results were also confirmed via 13C and 31P NMR spectra, which were recorded in D2O and CD3OD as solvents, see the ESI.† The trans geometry would have resulted in simpler NMR due to the higher symmetry and would have yielded only three peaks in the aromatic region due to the four magnetically equivalent pyridine units.

Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded in KBr pellets, and the vCN bands of complex (III) and (IV) were located, respectively at 2052 cm−1 and 2113 cm−1, see the ESI† for more details. It was demonstrated that the band appears around 2110 cm−1 can be assigned to N-bound thiocyante.25,26 Note that it is shifted to lower energy for the S-bound complex to 2052 cm−1.
To validate the results, dye-sensitized solar cell devices were fabricated using the synthesized complexes as sensitizers to TiO2 nanotubes under AM 1.5 illumination (Fig. 6 and Table 4), as detailed in our previous report. Note that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases in the order –SCN > –CN > –Cl, resulting in PCE of 1.91, 2.38 and 2.9%, respectively. Note that those efficiencies are at least twice that reported for the same complexes with the substituents in the 4- and 5-positions,27 confirming the importance of the position of the functional group in determining the performance of the Ru-complexes.

4. Conclusion
DFT and TDDFT calculations were performed on cis-[Ru(bipyridine)2(phosphonic acid)2]X2 where X = Cl, CN complexes. Due to geometrical orientation of the phosphate groups, two hydrogen bonds with average length of 1.77 Å were observed in the trans-configuration with only one hydrogen bond with 1.73 Å is formed in case of the cis-configuration. The order of reactivity as function of ΔE was found to be in the order Cl > NSC > CN and NSC > Cl > CN for trans- and cis-configurations, respectively. The dipole moment of the cis-configuration is larger than that of the trans-counterpart. The NCS complex shows the smallest optical band gap, the highest oscillator strength and the lowest exciton binging energy followed by the Cl and CN complexes, respectively, indicating a better performance for use as a sensitizer in solar cells application. The CN and NCS have three bands at 385 nm, 455 nm and 505 nm, and 461 nm, 610 nm and 671 nm, respectively. These complexes were found to be soluble in methanol and water with a larger solubility at basic pH. The cis-configuration of such novel ruthenium complexes was prepared and characterized by several spectroscopic methods. Upon their use as photosensitizers in DSSC devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases in the order –SCN > –CN > –Cl, resulting in PCE of 1.91, 2.38 and 2.9%, respectively. We hope that our work will open a new route toward the synthesis and use of optically active Ru-complexes based on phosphonate functional groups compared to carboxylic counterparts.
