    , Accepted 11th June 2021First published on 12th June 2021AbstractLow-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper (LDRP) perovskites have attracted great attention due to their superior stabilities. However, these LDRP perovskites are required to grow vertically with respect to the substrates to enable efficient charge transport for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we introduce a strategy to form a highly vertically oriented LDRP phase by introducing bromide (Br) into organic ammonium spacer of butylamine (BA) lead halide perovskites, i.e., (C4H9NH3)2MA4Pb5BrxI16−x. The LDRP perovskites with a small amount of Br (I–Br–I system with Br:PbI2 = 2:5 (molar ratio)) show the best abilities to form high-quality thin films and excellent vertical crystalline orientation, which facilitates charge transport and thus leads to highly efficient PSCs. As a result, a high champion PCE of 15.75% is achieved for the I–Br–I LDRP PSC compared to that of the pure iodine (I–I–I) device (12.15%). This work provides a new way to achieve efficient and stable LDRP PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites with the ABX3 structure, where A+ is an organic cation or cesium cation, B2+ is a metal cation, and X− is a halide anion, have been leading to a record-breaking efficiency of 25.5% in the field of photovoltaics due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties.1–6 Unfortunately, such perovskite materials cannot survive the long-term exposure to the external environment, hindering their way to commercialization. Recently, low-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper (LDRP) perovskites, such as (BA)2MA3Pb4I13, have emerged as a promising photoactive layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs).7–9 The LDRP perovskites have unique crystal structures in which large organic amine cations are inserted between inorganic slabs, generating intrinsic protection layers and passivation layers against adverse environments.10 The LDRP perovskite was first applied in PSCs in 2014 exhibiting good environment stability that the encapsulated perovskite was left in a low-humidity environment for 20 days without decomposition.11 In a few short years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LDRP PSCs underwent rapid development from 4.37% to 19.06% in planar configurations.12–15
Large organic ligands and inorganic slabs serve as insulating barrier layers and well layers respectively, forming a self-assembled multiple-quantum-well structure.16 Compared to their 3D counterparts, the charge transport of LDRP perovskites along the out-of-plane direction is low due to the insulating nature of the organic layers, which hinders further efficiency improvement of the LDRP PSCs. To overcome this issue, inorganic slabs of the LDRP perovskite films must be aligned vertically to the substrate surface to achieve efficient charge transport.17 Therefore, possibilities to control the growth orientation of the LDRP perovskite films intrigue researchers' great interest. Hot-casting technology was first developed to induce the vertical growth orientation of inorganic slabs, and a power conversion efficiency of 12.51% was realized for (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 PSCs.17 Since then, studies on achieving highly orientated LDRP perovskite crystals have flourished.18–22 Besides the crystal growth temperature, diverse additives such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),23,24 NH4Cl,25 NH4SCN,25,26 thiourea (THA),27 NH4Cl&NH4SCN,25 DMSO&CH3NH3Cl (MACl)28 and DMSO&NH4Cl,29 have been confirmed to effectively induce highly vertically oriented growth of the perovskite frameworks. Additionally, an anti-solvent was also incorporated to enhance the vertical growth.30 In terms of component regulation, a preferential out-of-plane crystallographic orientation of the octahedron in LDRP perovskites was obtained by replacing MA+ partially or completely with FA+ or Cs+.31–35 The efficiencies of the LDRP PSCs got greatly improved by the above-mentioned strategies, however, they are still lagging behind compared to their 3D counterparts. Studies are not sufficient on tuning the growth orientation of LDRP perovskite thin films, which is a primary way to enhance charge transport in LDRP PSCs, and more efforts are needed.
Herein, we introduce a strategy to form a highly vertically oriented LDRP phase by introducing bromide (Br) in organic ammonium spacer of butylamine (BA) lead halide perovskites, i.e., (C4H9NH3)2Pb5MA4BrxI16−x. The LDRP perovskites with a small amount of Br (Br:PbI2 = 2:5 (molar ratio)) show the best abilities to form high-quality thin films and excellent vertical crystalline orientation, which facilitates charge transport and thus leads to highly efficient PSCs. As a result, a champion PCE of 15.75% is achieved for the I–Br–I LDRP PSC compared to that of the I–I–I device (12.15%). Our results reveal important progress towards understanding the role of Br in LDRP perovskites and provide an alternative approach for improving the efficiency and stability of LDRP perovskite PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials preparation
Methyl acetate (MAAc) was synthesized by mixing methylamine (Alfa Aesar) and glacial acetic acid (45 wt% in water, Alfa Aesar) at a 10:3.2 volume ratio at 0 °C with constant stirring. The reaction took over 2 hours. The resulting clear solution is evaporated with a rotary evaporator, followed by freezing in a refrigerator to form white crystals. The MAAc crystals were washed with diethyl ether several times to remove the unreacted impurities. Lastly, they were purified by dissolving in ethanol followed by evaporation of solvent with a rotary evaporator. The resulting target reagent is stored in a drying cabinet. The other reagents were purchased from commercial vendors and used as received, including PEDOT:PSS (Clevious PVP. AL 4083, Heraeus, 1 g mL−1), methylamine iodide and methylamine chloride (MAI and MACl, 99.5% Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd.), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.99% TCI (Shanghai) Development Co., Ltd.), butylamine iodide and butylamine bromide (BAI and BABr, Xi'an polymer light technology corp), PC61BM(Nano-C), lithium fluoride (LiF, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich).
2.2 Perovskite solution preparation
BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1−xBrx (Br–Br–Br, I–Br–Br, I–I–Br, I–Br–I and I–I–I) precursor solutions: Solid PbX2 (X = I, Br), BAX (X = I, Br) and MAX (X = I, Br) were dissolved at a molar ratio of 5:2:4 in MAAc, followed by stirring at 60 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen-filled glove-box.
2.3 Device fabrication
Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with Hellmanex III detergent in DI water, DI water, acetone, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol, respectively, and dried in an oven overnight. Before use, the ITO substrates were cleaned with UV-O3 for 15 min and the PEDOT:PSS solution was filtered with a 0.45 mm nylon filter. The PEDOT:PSS (4083, Heraeus) aqueous solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 5000 rpm for 50 s and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in the ambient atmosphere. The perovskite films were prepared by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s by the AASP method, and annealing at 60 °C for 2 min and 100 °C for 3 min. The above steps are done in an atmospheric environment. Then a solution of PCBM in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 15 mg mL−1 was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 1000 rpm for 60 s and 2000 rpm for 2 s. Finally, the modified layer LiF and the electrode Al were evaporated on the perovskite film to a thickness of 1 nm and 100 nm, at a speed of 0.14 Å s−1 and 7 Å s−1, respectively, under a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa.
2.4 Solar cell characterization
The device characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G illumination using an Enlitech SS-F5-3A solar simulator, and the J–V characteristics were measured using J–V sweep software developed by Enlitech Ltd. and a Keithley 2400 source per meter unit. Current–voltage curves were measured in the forward scan range of −0.1 to 1.1 V and the reverse scan range of 1.1 to −0.1 V.
2.5 Thin film characterization
The SEM (JEOL, JSM-7800F) measurement was performed based on the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite. The XRD (Smartlab (3 kW)) measurement was performed based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the perovskite films on quartz glasses was collected using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV-1750, SHIMADZU) at room temperature. The PL spectrum was measured by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, HITACHI) with a 200 W Xe lamp as an excitation source. GIWAXS measurements were conducted on beamline 7.3.3 at Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and crystal structure of LDRP perovskites
The LDRP perovskite films, i.e., (C4H9NH3)2MA4Pb5BrxI16−x (<n> = 5) are prepared using an annealing assisted solution process (AASP) with methylamine acetate (MAAc) as the precursor solvent.36 To investigate the effects of incorporating Br into the perovskite crystals, five perovskite precursor systems are constructed, i.e., 5PbI2 + 2BAI + 4MAI (I–I–I), 5PbI2 + 2BABr + 4MAI (I–Br–I), 5PbI2 + 2BAI + 4MABr (I–I–Br), 5PbI2 + 2BABr + 4MABr (I–Br–Br) and 5PbBr2 + 2BABr + 4MABr (Br–Br–Br) with the molar ratio of Br to PbI2 increased from 0:5, 2:5, 4:5, 6:5 to 16:0.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements are conducted to investigate the crystallinity of the five LDRP perovskite films, as shown in (Fig. 1). Two distinct and dominant Bragg reflections (111) and (202) are observed in all films, assigned to the crystallographic planes of PbX64− octahedral layers aligned vertical to the substrate respectively. To give a clear view, the (111) and (202) peaks are magnified respectively in (Fig. 1b and c). The (111) and (202) peaks of the I–I–I films are centered at 14.19° and 28.50°. With the increase of the Br content, the peaks redshift with peak (111) at 14.24°, 14.29°, 14.36° and peak (202) at 28.61°, 28.71°, 28.90° for I–Br–I, I–I–Br, and I–Br–Br films respectively. This can be attributed to the decreased lattice spacing by gradual substitution of small Br for large I.37 The Br–Br–Br film has two peaks located at 14.94° and 30.33°, which is consistent with previous reports.38 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of (111) peak for the five films were compared and are summarized in Fig. S1† and Table S1†. The FWHM for the I–I–I film is 0.143 nm which decreases to 0.119 nm (I–Br–I) and 0.131 (I–I–Br) nm after introducing moderate Br contents into the perovskite crystal lattice. This indicates a more outstanding crystallinity than that of the I–I–I film. When incorporating large amount of Br into the perovskite crystal lattice (I–Br–Br), the FWHM increases to 0.206 nm, demonstrating the formation of small crystal grains. In addition, the peak shape (202) for the I–Br–Br film is asymmetric, which may imply the asymmetric lattice structure induced by the high Br content.

3.2 Surface morphologies and PL spectra of LDRP perovskites
The surface morphologies of the five LDRP perovskite films are characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1d). The morphology of the I–I–I film is poor with non-uniform grains and large pin-holes, which is not beneficial for charge transport. After introducing Br into the perovskite crystal lattice (I–Br–I, I–I–Br and I–Br–Br), the films exhibit dense-grained uniform morphologies with less and smaller pin-holes. Especially for the I–Br–I film with a small amount of Br (Br:PbI2 = 2:5 (molar ratio)), the grains are larger, which would improve the charge transport through or along the grain boundaries. The morphology of the Br–Br–Br film shows large cubic crystals, indicating the superior crystallinity of the film, which corresponds to the relatively narrow FWHM in the XRD results (Fig. S2†). However, the coverage of the Br–Br–Br film is low, and is similar to the morphologies of 3D MAPbBr3 perovskite films.39 This indicates that the LDRP perovskite with pure Br tends to form RP phases with high n value. Fig. S2† presents the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) images of the five perovskite films. Br is uniformly distributed on the surface and is mostly observed on the crystal face rather than the grain boundary, and the content ratio of I and Br is consistent with the raw material ratio (Table S2†), indicating that Br is effectively incorporated into the perovskite crystal lattice.
The steady-state absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the five LDRP perovskite films are shown in (Fig. S3†). The I–I–I film shows an absorption edge of 780 nm, which is a typical 2D/3D mixed film, in line with the previous reports.40 After Br is introduced into the perovskite crystal lattice, the absorption edge blueshifts for I–Br–I, I–I–Br and I–Br–Br films respectively, which could be attributed to the changed crystal lattice constants. The absorption edge finally shifts to 542 nm for Br–Br–Br films, which is close to that of the perovskites with the 3D phase.7 Compared to the symmetric spectra of the I–I–I and Br–Br–Br films, the I–Br–I, I–I–Br and I–Br–Br films exhibit an asymmetric spectral shape, likely due to the coexistence of the RP perovskite phases with different n values. This can be further demonstrated by the PL emission of I–Br–I at 740 nm (Fig. S3†), which can be assigned to the 3D phase in our perovskite films, which is consistent with the current report.40
3.3 Br induced vertical growth of the perovskite grains proved by GIWAXS
The crystal orientation is crucial for charge transport in LDRP perovskite films. To further elucidate the crystal orientation of the five LDRP perovskite films, we performed in situ Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) analysis using synchrotron radiation. Fig. 2a–e show the scattering patterns of the films with different contents of Br, where sharp and discrete Bragg spots are observed for all five perovskite films, indicating good vertical crystalline orientation in the thin films. The coordinate value of the (111) crystalline plane in the qz-axis direction gradually increases, i.e., from I–I–I (qz = 10 nm−1) to Br–Br–Br (qz >10 nm−1) with increased Br content due to the decreased lattice spacing, which is consistent with the XRD results. The I–I–I film shows both Bragg spots and Debye–Scherrer rings, indicating considerable randomness of the polycrystalline orientation in the films. After Br is introduced (I–Br–I, I–I–Br and I–Br–Br), the (111) peaks exhibit lower diffraction intensity along the same rings from the pole figures along the same rings (Fig. S4†), while the intensity of (202) peaks still increased, which can be attributed to the excellent vertical growth of the perovskite grains. This characteristic is not reflected in the Br–Br–Br film, indicating that excessive Br would undermine the vertical crystalline orientation in the film. Schematic illustrations of crystal orientation for I–I–I, I–Br–I and Br–Br–Br perovskite films are presented in Fig. S5.† Combined with the SEM results, it is clear that the I–Br–I film with superior vertical growth orientation and better film quality has great potential to improve the charge transport.
 Fig. 2  GIWAXS images for the (a) I–I–I, (b) I–Br–I, (c) I–I–Br, (d) I–Br–Br, and (e) Br–Br–Br perovskite films and (f) the schematic illustration of the structure change after incorporating Br. 

Fig. 2f shows a schematic representation of the crystal growth of LDRP perovskites with and without Br. Usually the generation of vacancies and defects in 3D ABX3 perovskites is due to ion migration.41,42 In the I–I–I perovskite, the loss of I could distort the octahedral structure, and the hydrogen bonding of I⋯H–N between the inorganic framework and the organic amine molecule would become invalid (Fig. 2f, top), resulting in an unstable crystal structure. In comparison, Br could incorporate into the perovskite lattice and interact with BA by Br⋯H–N hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2f, bottom).43 This could stabilize the structure of the inorganic layer and reduces the disorder in the perovskite thin film, leading to ordered orientation growth.
3.4 Film quality of LDRP perovskites
To probe the impact of Br on carrier dynamics in LDRP perovskite films, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was conducted. Considering the optimal vertical crystalline orientation and film quality, the I–Br–I perovskite film is chosen to compare with the pure I film (I–I–I). The perovskite film (I–I–I, I–Br–I), PEDOT:PSS/perovskite bilayer and perovskite/PCBM bilayer are deposited on the quartz respectively, and the corresponding TRPL spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The PL decay of I–Br–I LDRP perovskite films exhibits a longer fluorescence lifetime (43.10 ns) than that of the I–I–I perovskite film (31.73 ns) (Fig. S6†), demonstrating the excellent charge transport in the vertical orientated grains and improved film quality after introducing Br in the LDRP perovskites. In addition, the charge extraction capability is revealed using carrier transfer time (τCT) and carrier extraction efficiency (η) by the following equations:44 1/τheterojunction = 1/τperovskite + 1/τCT(1) η = τheterojunction/τCT.(2)
 Fig. 3  The TRPL spectra of the (a) I–I–I and (b) I–Br–I LDRP perovskite films with or without the PEDOT:PSS or PCBM charge transport layer. 
The calculated values of τCT for PEDOT:PSS/I–I–I perovskite and PEDOT:PSS/I–Br–I perovskite are 7.85 and 2.51 ns, while those for I–I–I perovskite/PCBM and I–Br–I perovskite/PCBM are 2.51 and 2.25 ns respectively. Meanwhile, the values of η get improved from 80.13 to 94.18% for the PEDOT:PSS/I–Br–I perovskite bilayer, and from 90.69 to 93.33% for the I–Br–I perovskite/PCBM bilayer (Table S4†). The shorter τCT and larger η could explain the more effective charge transfer in the LDRP perovskite film and more effective carrier extraction in the transport layer and contact interface after introducing Br.
We then further investigated the trap-state density and charge mobility using the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique in the LDRP perovskites.45,46 We collected the dark current–voltage characteristics for the hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/perovskite (260 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Au (120 nm)) and the electron-only device (ITO/SnO2 (20 nm)/perovskite (260 nm)/PCBM (100 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm)) (Fig. S7†). The trap-state density is determined from the trap-filled limit voltage using the following equation:47 (3)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr (=25.7) is the relative dielectric constant,48,49VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region, q is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. After introducing Br, the trap-state density significantly decreases from 2.02 × 1016 cm−3 (I–I–I) to 6.50 × 1015 cm−3 (I–Br–I) (Table S4†). The intrinsic electron and hole mobilities are also estimated using the Mott–Gurney Law:47 (4)where μ is the charge mobility, and V and J are the applied voltage and applied current. The charge mobility of I–Br–I devices is 3.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron and 1.05 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole, which is higher than that of the I–I–I analogues (3.68 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron and 8.55 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole). The introduction of Br leads to an enhancement of charge carrier mobility by an order of magnitude compared to the I–I–I system, which is due to the excellent vertical crystalline growth facilitating the charge transfer.
3.5 Device performance of the LDRP perovskites
We finally examine the effects of introduction of Br in LDRP perovskites on PSC performance. The device is fabricated with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al, as shown in (Fig. 4a). The I–Br–I perovskite with superior characteristics is chosen to compare with the pure I LDRP perovskite (I–I–I). The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs are measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 4a), and their photovoltaic values are summarized in Table 1. For the PSC with the I–I–I LDRP perovskite, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill-factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are 0.96 V, 15.91 mA cm−2, 79.09% and 12.15% respectively. After introducing Br in the LDRP perovskites (I–Br–I), the device shows a PCE of 15.77% with a VOC of 1.01 V, a JSC of 20.41 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.71%, which is an obvious amelioration compared to the I–I–I based device. The enhanced VOC can be attributed to the incorporation of Br in the I–I–I LDRP perovskite lattice, which has been demonstrated to widen the band-gap,7 and the reduction of trap density in the perovskite films (Table S4†). The improvement of JSC can be ascribed to the improved charge transport, which originates from the preferential vertical crystalline orientation in the I–Br–I LDRP perovskite. The lowered FF for the I–Br–I device may stem from the decreased contact quality between the perovskite layer/charge transport layer, which could be alleviated by interface engineering. Table S5† summarizes the performance of literature reported LDRP PSCs based on BA based 2D perovskites with the same n value (n = 5). Note that though our PCE is not the highest (Table S5†), the perovskite film is achieved by one-step spin-coating in air without any additives in the perovskite precursor. The reproducibility of the PCE is evaluated by characterizing 50 individual PSCs based on I–I–I and I–Br–I LDRP perovskites. The I–Br–I device shows better reproducibility than the I–I–I device (Fig. 4b), indicating that high-performance devices can be repeatedly fabricated by introducing Br in the LDRP perovskite.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the corresponding integrated JSC are shown in (Fig. 4c). The I–Br–I device exhibits higher EQEs than the I–I–I device. The integrated JSC is calculated to be 19.84 mA cm−2 after incorporating Br in the LDRP perovskite, which is within 3% of the JSC measured under AM 1.5G standard irradiation. The hysteresis of the devices is studied by measuring the J–V curves with forward and reverse voltage scanning (Fig. S8†), and the hysteresis can be neglected in both I–I–I and I–Br–I devices. In Fig. 4d, the steady-state short-circuit photocurrent and steady-state PCE output are measured by applying a constant voltage (Vconst) at the maximum power point (MPP). The I–Br–I PSCs achieve a higher steady-state current density of 18.59 mA cm−2 and a higher steady-state PCE of 15.25% (Vconst = 0.82 V) than that of the I–I–I devices with a steady-state current density of 13.67 mA cm−2 and a steady-state PCE of 11.76% (Vconst = 0.86 V), suggesting that the introduction of Br improves the vertical crystalline growth and film quality, contributing to most of the enhancement of the current density and the device efficiency.
In addition, we also test the air and thermal stability of the I–I–I and I–Br–I LDRP perovskite thin films, and the stability of the device respectively. When exposed to air or heated at 85 °C in a glove box, there are no changes in the XRD patterns for the I–I–I and I–Br–I LDRP perovskite thin films after a period of time (Fig. S10 and S11†), indicating good film stability. When incorporating the two perovskite thin films in the PSCs respectively, the I–Br–I device maintains 90% of the initial PCE value over 1400 h while the I–I–I device degrades to 42% of the initial value (Fig. S11†), which is related to the improved quality of the thin films.
4. Conclusion
The effects of incorporating Br into LDRP perovskite crystal lattices are systematically investigated by constructing five LDRP perovskite precursor material systems (I–I–I, I–Br–I, I–I–Br, I–Br–Br and Br–Br–Br). The introduction of Br could facilitate the ordered orientation growth of perovskites and prevent the formation of defects, which stabilizes the structure of the inorganic layer and reduces the disorder in the perovskite thin films. The vertical oriented growth of perovskite crystals enhances the charge transport and thus the performance of the PSCs. Among the five systems, the system with a small amount of Br is optimal (I–Br–I) with a high champion PCE of 15.75% compared to that of the I–I–I device (12.15%). Most importantly, the I–Br–I PSCs show improved stability over that of the I–I–I device, indicating a potential way to achieve long-term stability in LDRP perovskite devices.
