    , Accepted 13th January 2020First published on 14th January 2020AbstractNew electron-donating fused-ring cores based on tetrathienoacene were designed, with which new NIR-sensitive fused-ring electron acceptors, F8IC1 and F10IC1, were synthesized. Compared with the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based counterpart F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1 show heavily elevated HOMO and slightly elevated LUMO levels, bathochromic absorption spectra with reduced optical bandgaps, and enhanced electron mobilities. Paired with the polymer donor material PTB7-Th, the organic photovoltaic devices based on F8IC1 and F10IC1 show synchronous enhancement of open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and fill factor. The single-junction cells based on F8IC1 and F10IC1 achieve efficiencies of 10.7% and 12.3%, respectively, surpassing those of the F6IC-based control cells (7.00%).
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ)1,2 organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn tremendous attention thanks to their unique features, e.g., light weight, easy preparation, low cost, flexibility and semitransparency.3–5 During the past twenty years, fullerene derivatives have been the most popular electron acceptors in OSCs since they have high electron mobility, large electron affinity and isotropic electron transport properties.6,7 However, there exist some drawbacks for fullerene acceptors, including difficult chemical modification, inferior visible light absorption, limited modulation of electronic properties, and weak endurance against external stress, which hindered the sustainable development of this field.8 As a consequence, non-fullerene acceptors have received increasing attention.9,10 Since 2015, we have developed a new series of non-fullerene electron acceptors with an “A–D–A” architecture, such as the star-molecule ITIC,11 and pioneered the concept “fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs)”, which has become the hot research frontier of this field.12–26 The photovoltaic cells composed of FREAs achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 13–16%27–39 for single-junction devices and 15–17%40–42 for tandem devices. FREAs outperform fullerene acceptors because they possess several advantages, such as facile molecular tailoring, adjustable energy levels, good electron mobility, a high exciton diffusion coefficient,43 and strong photoresponse in the visible and even the near-infrared (NIR) region.44,45
Generally, efforts devoted to reinforcing the performance of FREAs can be divided into three main aspects, including modifications of fused-ring cores, end groups and side groups. Engineering of fused-ring cores and end groups can tune the absorption range and energy levels.46 End group engineering has been intensively studied through using different electron-withdrawing units and various substitutions of end aromatic rings.10 However, this strategy usually cannot improve open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) simultaneously because stronger electron-withdrawing end groups can red-shift absorption but down-shift the LUMO energy level, resulting in higher JSC but lower VOC.16 Through proper modification of the fused-ring core in FREAs, red-shifted absorption and an up-shifted LUMO energy level can be realized at the same time, and thus a higher VOC and JSC can be achieved simultaneously.
Tetrathienoacene has been investigated in organic thin film transistors47–50 and dye-sensitized solar cells51 because of its high mobility and strong electron-donating ability, but it has rarely been used in OSCs. For example, Peng's group reported low-bandgap polymer donors based on tetrathienoacene and diketopyrrolopyrrole with high hole mobilities.52 We synthesized F11IC with enhanced mobility through extending the outermost thiophene of indacenodithiophene into tetrathienoacene.53 In this work, we developed new fused-ring cores based on tetrathienoacene, with which new FREAs, F8IC1 and F10IC1, were synthesized (Fig. 1). The rigid, symmetrical and coplanar structure of these fused-thiophene cores can minimize reorganization energy and facilitate molecular packing, which favours charge transport. On the other hand, these fused-thiophene cores have strong electron-donating ability and extended π-conjugation, which can up-shift energy levels and red-shift the absorption of the FREAs. Indeed, compared with our previously reported thienothiophene-based F6IC, tetrathienoacene-based F8IC1 and F10IC1 exhibit elevated energy levels, bathochromic absorption spectra, narrower bandgaps and enhanced mobilities. When blended with PTB7-Th,54 F8IC1- and F10IC1-based cells exhibit synchronously enhanced VOC, JSC and fill factor (FF). Eventually, the cells composed of F10IC1 and F8IC1 achieve PCEs of 12.3% and 10.7%, respectively, far exceeding that of the F6IC-based cells (7.00%). The efficiency of 12.3% is among the best values reported for ultra-narrow bandgap (<1.30 eV) FREA-based single-junction binary-blend cells.55–57

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The synthesis routes are illustrated in Scheme S1.† The new molecules were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis (ESI†). F8IC1 and F10IC1 are easily soluble in chloroform and dichloromethane and are thermally stable up to 355 and 359 °C with 95% weight maintained, respectively (Fig. S1†).
The visible-NIR light absorption spectra of F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1 in chloroform solution are illustrated in Fig. 2a. F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1 exhibit maximum absorption peaks at 762, 761, 778 nm, respectively. These results suggest that F10IC1 has relatively stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) than F6IC and F8IC1 accompanied by its red-shifted absorption relative to F6IC and F8IC1, implying that the outermost units of the fused-ring cores have a more significant influence on ICT since they are spatially closer to the electron-withdrawing end groups. At the maximum absorption peaks, the three molecules show gradually increased molar extinction coefficients in the interval of 1.8 to 3.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (Table 1). The thin films of F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1 show maximum absorption peaks at 800, 820, and 814 nm, which are red shifted by 38, 59, and 36 nm relative to those in solution, respectively (Fig. 2b). Compared with those of F6IC and F10IC1, the absorption peak of the F8IC1 film shows a larger red-shift, suggesting that F8IC1 molecules have stronger aggregation in the film. The optical bandgaps calculated from the absorption edges are estimated to be 1.36, 1.32, and 1.29 eV, for F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry is used to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energies of F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1 (Fig. 2c). The HOMO levels of F6IC, F8IC1, and F10IC1 are calculated to be −5.68, −5.43, and −5.35 eV, respectively, while the LUMOs of F6IC, F8IC1, and F10IC1 are −4.04, −3.99, and −3.96 eV, respectively (Fig. 2d). Increasing the core size notably elevates the HOMO levels and slightly elevates the LUMO levels. The electron mobilities of the F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1 pure films are 9.1 × 10−4, 1.1 × 10−3 and 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, as measured by space-charge-limited current (SCLC)58 (Fig. S2†).

Photovoltaic properties
The commercial polymer donor material PTB7-Th possesses intense absorption in the interval of 550 to 750 nm, which complements those of F6IC, F8IC1, and F10IC1. The energy levels of PTB7-Th align well with those of F6IC, F8IC1, and F10IC1 (Fig. 2d), ensuring sufficient exciton dissociation. Thus, we fabricated inverted BHJ solar cells consisting of indium tin oxide/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. The device processing parameters, including spin-coating speed, donor:acceptor ratio, additive diphenyl ether (DPE), and thermal annealing conditions, were carefully optimized (Tables S1–S3†). The J–V curves of the optimized cells are presented in Fig. 3a. The PTB7-Th:F6IC-based best OSC exhibits a PCE of 7.00% with a VOC of 0.609 V, JSC of 18.15 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.1%. The PTB7-Th:F8IC1-based best OSC gives a PCE of 10.7% with a VOC of 0.683 V, JSC of 22.25 mA cm−2, and FF of 70.4%. The PTB7-Th:F10IC1-based best OSC gives a champion PCE of 12.3% with a VOC of 0.723 V, JSC of 23.44 mA cm−2, and FF of 72.4% (Table 2). Extending the fused-ring core size leads to synchronous enhancement of VOC, JSC and FF. The enhancement of VOC is consistent with the up-shift of the LUMO energy level with the increasing core size.

As shown in Fig. 3b, all the OSCs show photoresponse in the range from 300 nm to ca. 900 nm, and F10IC1-based devices show photoresponse even up to 950 nm. The highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) of F6IC-, F8IC1-, and F10IC1-based OSCs is 67.9%, 76.8%, and 76.6%, respectively. The EQE is broadened and enhanced from F6IC to F8IC1 and F10IC1, similar to the trend of JSC. The calculated JSC values from the EQE are consistent with those from the J–V measurements.
The photocurrent (Jph) with the effective voltage (Veff) was studied (Fig. 3c).59 At Veff > 2 V, Jph reaches saturated photocurrent (Jsat). The JSC/Jsat ratios for the F6IC-, F8IC1-, and F10IC1-based devices are calculated to be 93.7%, 95.6%, and 96.9%, respectively, suggesting that the charge generation and collection of F8IC1/F10IC1-based devices are more efficient than those of F6IC-based devices. To explore carrier recombination behaviors, the JSC change with light intensity (Plight) is investigated and the JSC follows: JSC ∝ Plightα (Fig. 3d). The α value is estimated to be 0.951, 0.962 and 0.965 for devices based on F6IC, F8IC1, and F10IC1, respectively, indicating negligible bimolecular recombination.
SCLC is used to detect charge carrier mobilities of the blend films (Fig. S3†). PTB7-Th:F8IC1/F10IC1 blends (μh = 5.5/6.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe = 3.9/6.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) show higher hole and electron mobilities than PTB7-Th:F6IC blends (μh = 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe = 9.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The μh/μe ratios of F6IC-, F8IC1-, and F10IC1-based blends are 2.4, 1.4, and 1.1, respectively. The F8IC1- and F10IC1-based blends show faster and more balanced charge transport than the F6IC-based blend, which contributes to the higher FFs.60,61
Film morphology
The active layer surface morphology was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The F6IC-, F8IC1-, and F10IC1-based blends show a smooth surface with a small root-mean-square roughness of 1.33, 0.90, and 1.26 nm, respectively (Fig. S4†).
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to investigate crystallinity and molecular stacking in films (Fig. 4).62 The out of plane (010) peaks of PTB7-Th, F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1 are located at q ≈ 1.58, 1.70, 1.78 and 1.80 A−1, respectively. According to the fitting results, the coherence lengths (CLs) of the out-of-plane (010) peaks of the donor are ∼8, 12 and 17 Å for F6IC-, F8IC1-, and F10IC1-based blends, respectively. The crystallinity of PTB7-Th in F8IC1 and F10IC1-based blends is higher than that in the F6IC-based blend, which is responsible for the higher hole mobilities. The CLs of F6IC, F8IC1, and F10IC1 in the blends are about 14, 17 and 19 Å, respectively. The crystallinity of F8IC1 and F10IC1 is higher than that of F6IC, which is responsible for the higher electron mobilities.

Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was used to acquire the phase separation information of the active layers (Fig. 5).63,64 The domain sizes of the blend films, calculated from fitting the Gaussian function, are about 16, 17 and 30 nm for F6IC-, F8IC1-, and F10IC1-based blends, respectively. The small domain size causes serious charge recombination though it may promote exciton separation to some extent. The domain size of PTB7-Th:F10IC1 is appropriate for both exciton separation and charge transport. The relative phase purities of F6IC-, F8IC1-, and F10IC1-based blends are 0.98, 0.90 and 1, respectively. The phase purity of PTB7-Th:F10IC1 is the highest among those of these three systems, which contributes to its better charge transport. The suitable domain size with the highest phase purity in the PTB7-Th:F10IC1 blend is responsible for its better charge transport, contributing to the higher JSC and FF.

Conclusion
Two new NIR-absorbing FREAs, F8IC1 and F10IC1, based on strong electron-donating tetrathienoacene were designed and synthesized. Together with the thienothiophene-based F6IC, we systematically investigated the effects of core engineering on the electronic and photonic properties, mobility, film morphology and device performance. Relative to the thienothiophene-based F6IC, F8IC1 and F10IC1 with the tetrathienoacene core exhibit markedly up-shifted HOMO and slightly up-shifted LUMO levels, red-shifted absorption, and better electron mobilities, which promote VOC, JSC and FF. When extending the core size of the FREAs, the VOC of the cells based on F6IC, F8IC1, and F10IC1 gradually increases from 0.609 to 0.683 and 0.723 V, the JSC gradually increases from 18.2 to 22.3 and 23.4 mA cm−2, and the FF gradually increases from 63.1% to 70.4% and 72.4%. Finally, the single-junction binary-blend OSCs consisting of PTB7-Th:F10IC1 achieve the best efficiency of 12.3%, demonstrating that tetrathienoacene is a good building block for synthesis of high-efficiency NIR-absorbing FREAs.
