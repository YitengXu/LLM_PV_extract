    , Accepted 12th July 2017First published on 13th July 2017AbstractSolution-processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells have been achieved using unsymmetrical metalloporphyrin–PBI dyads as small molecular donors. Due to panchromatic absorption, a photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 6.18% was obtained for 3-Zn:PC71BM with a remarkable energy loss (Eloss) of 0.60 eV, which is in line with the best values recorded so far for porphyrin-based small-molecular donors.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ), with small molecules as the donor–acceptor blend in the absorber active layer, have emerged as promising for reaching higher values of PCE.1,2 Due to the thickness limitation imposed to obtain good carrier extraction, an efficient molecular donor–acceptor framework with outstanding light absorption is a must. Further, the compound must offer easier solution-processability and higher thermochemical stability.3 Therefore, it is necessary to identify and optimize different parameters, such as the nature of the pigments, absorption profiles, and their inter-linking and suitable energy levels, to achieve efficient light harvesting.4 Members of the porphyrin family are attractive candidates for artificial light harvesting antenna complexes, but their absorption maxima (Soret bands) are confined to the near-ultraviolet (NUV) range, limiting their efficiency.5 The appropriate functionalization of porphyrins can result in an extended absorption range. In 2014, Peng and co-workers6 reported a PCE of 7% from a small molecular donor based on a Zn–porphyrin derivative. Since then, the application of porphyrin based D–π–A derivatives in solution-processed BHJ-OSCs has gained huge momentum.7
Perylenebismide (PBI), on the other hand, has strong absorption in the visible range (between the Soret and Q bands), aptly complimenting that of porphyrins.8,9 PBI is a structurally robust electron acceptor and inherits superior photo- and chemical stability from the polyaromatic core. Hence the intriguing electronic features of both the molecular systems can be coupled together to generate a novel class of chromophore with panchromatic absorption for photovoltaic applications. However, PBI–porphyrin derivatives have always been utilized as acceptor motifs in devices and have never been explored as donor motifs.10
In this context, herein we describe the synthesis and characterization of simple PBI–porphyrin adducts that can act as donors for solution-processed BHJ-OSCs. An alkyne linker between the chromophores is preferred for efficient electronic interaction while alleviating the chance of aggregation. As the properties of porphyrins are known to be dependent on the central metal ion, an investigation on the effect of metals on the PCE will shed light on further improvements. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report of an alkyne-linked PBI–metalloporphyrin derivative being used as a donor for the fabrication of solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells and it was found to yield a high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Compounds 1–3 were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling (Scheme 1) between 10-ethynyl-metalloporphyrin11 and 1-bromo-perylenebisimide12 (Schemes 1 & 2 in the ESI†). All the molecules were characterized by NMR spectroscopy as well as by high resolution mass spectrometry (APCI-HRMS). An unambiguous proof for the structure of the dyads is important to derive the structure–property correlation, but initial attempts failed due to aggregation. If axial ligation can be used to increase the co-ordination number of metalloporphyrins, then stacking can be avoided to some extent with improved solubility. To verify this, crystallization in pyridine was tried for 1–3. Plate-like single crystals of 1-Ni of moderate quality were thus obtained for the diffraction experiments. The structure of 1-Ni (Fig. 1) reveals a coplanar PBI–porphyrin platform with two pyridine molecules coordinated to the Ni(II) center. It is believed that the alkyne linker restrains the two chromophores to be coplanar.

Interestingly, the two pyridine rings are not only coplanar with each other but they are coplanar with the mesityl rings on the meso-positions as well. Due to the presence of two axial pyridine ligands, an otherwise expected head-to-tail packing of the donor–acceptor scaffold is prevented. This leads to a homo-dimer kind of arrangement in the asymmetric unit cell with the PBI units of the two nearby molecules stacking over each other. The asymmetric unit cell contains two molecules of 1-Ni. One of the molecules is severely disordered on the PBI unit. The disordered molecule displays a tilt about the alkyne linkage and reveals a rotamer of the other molecule. While it is normal to expect rotation about the alkyne axis, evidence for the same in the solid state has been obtained.
The UV/Vis NIR spectra of the dyads 1–3 were obtained from a diluted (10−6 M) chloroform solution (Fig. 2). The absorption spectral features of the current dyads differ substantially from their constituents i.e. PBI and porphyrin. These dyads exhibit panchromatic absorption that extends from 400 nm to 820 nm (Table 1). The absorption spectra reveal bathochromically-shifted intense bands at 426, 428 and 434 nm, respectively, for compounds 1–3 with very large molar extinction coefficients (Table S1†) and these can be assigned to the Soret band of the porphyrin. Another notable feature in the spectra was the broad absorption bands between 490–590 nm. This region lacks discernible vibronic progression, a characteristic of unsubstituted PBI, hence it was less recognizable as PBI based π–π* transition or the Q-band features of porphyrin. The most remarkable feature in the spectra was the emergence of an intense, structure-less, broad band from the visible (600 nm) to NIR (820 nm) region. This band was indicative of a considerable porphyrin → PBI charge transfer. A red shift in all the peaks was visualized on moving from 1-Ni to 3-Zn through 2-Cu. The CT band showed a huge red shift in 3-Zn owing to the better donating ability of Zn–porphyrin.

The non-emissive nature of these dyads further corroborates a strong electronic communication between the donor and acceptor. A negligible shift in the Soret band was observed upon increasing the solvent polarity; however the CT bands were characterized by hypsochromic shifts (Fig. S22–S24†). To prove the intramolecular nature of the charge transfer in 3-Zn, an equimolar solution of PBI was mixed with a solution of Zn–porphyrin. The absorption spectrum of this mixture (Fig. S25†) was found to be a sum of its constituents without any CT transition. These observations essentially support the red shift in the optical absorption of these dyads being facilitated by an ethynyl bridge.
The absorption spectra of dyads recorded in a thin film cast from THF appeared to be red-shifted and broader compared to those in solution (Fig. 2). These features can be attributed to the extended π-backbone in these molecules resulting in stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interactions. Such an ordered packing would facilitate high charge mobility. The optical band gaps estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra were found to be 1.58 eV, 1.53 eV and 1.38 eV for 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
The DFT-computed HOMOs of compounds 1–3 show a major contribution from the porphyrin unit with scarce delocalization onto the PBI core. The LUMO, on the other hand, is mainly localized over the PBI framework with some delocalization on the alkyne bridge (Fig. 3 & S26†). Thus, the HOMO–LUMO transition can be attributed to the CT transition observed in the absorption spectrum, which is in agreement with earlier studies.9c,12c.

The redox potentials were measured with respect to a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and are summarized in Table 1. All three dyads showed three reversible, well-defined one-electron reductions and two one-electron oxidations reflecting the structural robustness (Fig. 3). The values of HOMO/LUMO are −5.42 eV/−3.82 eV, −5.40 eV/−3.82 eV and −5.26 eV/−3.74 eV for 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The LUMO offset between these dyads and PC71BM (LUMO = −4.15 eV) is higher than the exciton binding energy, indicating an efficient exciton dissociation if used as a donor along with PC71BM to produce solution-processed BHJ OSCs.
Solution-processed BHJ-OSCs were fabricated employing 1-Ni, 2-Cu and 3-Zn as the donors and PC71BM as the electron acceptor. A conventional device structure of indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/(PEDOT:PSS)/1-Ni or 2-Cu or 3-Zn:PC71BM/PFN/Al was employed (see the ESI†). A 1:2 weight ratio of donor to acceptor delivered the best photovoltaic response. Pyridine was used as an additive for the active layer. The ratio of pyridine in THF was varied from 0.5 v% to 3.5 v% and it was found that 3 v% gave the best result. The PCE values were found to be 4.51%, 5.42% and 6.18% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.34 mA cm−2, 10.13 mA cm−2 and 12.25 mA cm−2, respectively, for 1-Ni, 2-Cu and 3-Zn based devices (Fig. 4a and b & Table 2). The Voc values were lower for the 3-Zn based device compared to the other two analogues, which is related to the higher HOMO of the 3-Zn dyad. The charge carrier mobility in the BHJ active layer is crucial for the overall PCE of an organic solar cell.14 The hole mobilities were found to be 0.87 × 10−4, 0.96 × 10−4 and 1.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1-Ni, 2-Cu and 3-Zn based devices, respectively (Fig. 4d). However, the electron mobility for these active layers (measured using the electron-only devices) remained the same for all of the three devices, i.e. 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.

The larger hole-mobility values of 3-Zn:PC71BM indicate more balanced charge transport in a BHJ device based on 3-Zn:PC71BM. The trend followed for the values of Jsc, FF and PCE is consistent with the values of hole-mobility. To understand the effect of the metal in the porphyrin unit on the photogeneration of the charge carriers in organic solar cells, we further investigated the variation in the photocurrent (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4c). The value of Veff corresponds to the strength of the electric field within the device for extracting charge carriers.
From Fig. 4c, it can be visualized that in the device based on 3-Zn, Jph saturates at a lower voltage than the other two devices, due to the lower internal electric field needed for extracting the charge carriers. The estimated values of the maximum generation rate of charge carrier Gmax are 8.38 × 1027 m3 s−1, 8.67 × 1027 m3 s−1 and 1.01 × 1028 m3 s−1, respectively, for devices based on 1–3. This is consistent with the increase in Jsc, as well as the absorption spectra, indicating more exciton generation and dissociation in the active layer in the 3-Zn based devices.
Another promising feature of 3-Zn for application in small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) is the low energy loss associated with it. The energy loss (Eloss) is defined as Eloss = Eg − qVoc, where Eg is the optical bandgap of the donor materials.15 The Eloss for 3:PC71BM (0.60 eV) is lower than that for 1:PC71BM (0.68 eV) and 2:PC71BM (0.64 eV) and is beneficial for high Jsc and PCE. Our devices showed comparable Voc with low energy loss similar to recent reports.10 The low Eloss and high EQE, even in the NIR region, for 3-Zn are in line with the best SMOSCs.
In summary, the novelty of the current work is the first demonstration of the utility of metallated porphyrin–PBI derivatives as donors in BHJ-OSCs, through appropriate functionalization. Their intensive D–A interactions, favourable band gap, planarity in structure and panchromatic absorption highlight them for promising applications in solution-processed BHJ-OSCs. The device based on 3-Zn:PC71BM showed an impressive overall PCE of 6.18% with a strikingly lower Eloss of 0.6 eV. Moreover, the present dyads offer tunability with respect to structural modifications at the PBI bay as well as the porphyrin meso-handle. We strongly believe that this flexibility for functionalization can further be exploited for device improvements.
