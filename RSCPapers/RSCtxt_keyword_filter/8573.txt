Herein, solution processed tandem solar cells, with highly transparent titanium oxide (TiO2) and graphene oxide (GO) as an efficient recombination layer, were designed, fabricated and characterized. We have adopted poly[(4,4′-bis(3-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:′′3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,5-(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole]:indene-C60 bisadduct (PSEHTT:ICBA) and poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl]:[6,6]-phenyl-C70 butyric acid methyl ester (PSBTBT:PC70BM) as the active layers for the front and rear cells, respectively. The TiO2/GO serves as an electron and hole collecting and recombination layer. The tandem solar cells showed a high open circuit voltage (VOC) 1.62 V, a moderate short circuit current density (JSC) 8.23 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) 62.98%, leading to the power conversion efficiency of 8.40%. The obtained VOC value of tandem solar cells is ideal for the summation of VOCs attained from front and rear cells and it is evident that our tandem solar cells are well connected in series. Moreover, this tandem cell exhibits a 20% drop in conversion efficiency under continuous AM illumination for 2880 h.IntroductionOrganic solar cells can be now considered as moving quickly towards commercialized maturity for large-scale applications, where Heliatek reported the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 12% integrating two different absorber materials of vacuum deposited oligomers, which convert light at different wavelengths on a 1.1 cm2 substrate.1 Organic solar cells have been extensively studied due to various advantages such as cost effectiveness, light weight, mechanical flexibility and simple fabrication process. Although, the efficiency of organic solar cells has increased significantly, a few basic but critical issues in obtaining high efficiency must be overcome, namely low charge carrier mobilities and a narrow absorption window. One of the approaches to improve the absorption is stacking two or more organic solar cells with different absorption characteristics in so-called tandem solar cells.2–9 It has been reported that series connected tandem solar cells with complementary absorption exhibit a high VOC, which is nearly ideal to the summation of the VOC's for front and rear cells, while the JSC is slightly lower than that of the single cell.6–8 It is generally accepted that for series-connected tandem solar cells, a precise optimization of the absorption window and photo-generated current in front and rear cells can be realized by employing first a thin charge-separation layer with a large band gap material, and the second thick charge-separation layer with a narrow band gap material, which will theoretically and experimentally result in well balanced photo-generated currents in the front and rear cells.There are also reported works on other types of tandem solar cell which are connected in parallel.10–12 Unlike series-connected cells, the JSC in an ideal parallel connected tandem solar cells can be realized by the summation of the JSCs in the front and rear cells. For parallel tandem solar cells, the front and rear solar cells may be either connected or not connected by external circuits.Regarding series tandem solar cells, the recombination layer is one of the most important features to realize high performance tandem solar cells, in which it must have a zero resistance electrical connection between the front and rear cells so that one can minimize or avoid the electrical potential loss. In addition, to minimize the energy loss when the carriers penetrate the recombination layer, Ohmic contact between the recombination and photoactive layers is always desirable. This layer also basically serves as charge recombination regime aligning the quasi Fermi level of the holes in one cell to that of the electrons in another cell, where the carriers are transported to prevent the front and rear cells from charging. Besides, the selected and proposed recombination layer must also have high transparency in order to reduce absorption loss, and finally it must be able to protect and shield the front cell from any kind (physical or chemical) of solvent penetration during the coating of the rear cell. This is due to the fact that solvent penetration can affect the recombination layer between front and rear cells. By taking this into account, one should be able to avoid any reduction in VOC in the tandem solar cells.Inspired by the importance of the recombination layer in tandem solar cells, researchers have published many reports showing a better electrical connection between the front and the rear cells. Table S1† summarizes the reported recombination layers available in the literature.13–34 As shown in Table S1,† one can basically distinguish 3 different types of recombination layer namely: (i) a recombination layer which enables thermal evaporation of subsequent subcells; (ii) a recombination layer allowing solution processed subsequent subcells; and (iii) the other recombination layer.In this report, we demonstrate the design, construction and characterizations of tandem solar cells, with each layer deposited from solution except the top and bottom electrodes. A TiO2/GO recombination layer coated from a solution process was used to connect the front and rear cells.Results and discussionFig. 1a and b shows the schematic structure of the fabricated tandem solar cell together with its chemical structures. PSEHTT:ICBA and PSBTBT:PC70BM are the photoactive layers for the front and rear cells, respectively. The tandem solar structure consists of the following layers: indium tin oxide (ITO); graphene oxide (GO); poly[(4,4′-bis(3-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:′′3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,5-(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo)[5,4-d]thiazole]:indene-C60 bisadduct (PSEHTT:ICBA);35 titanium dioxide (TiO2); GO; poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS); poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d] silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl]:[6,6]-phenyl-C70 butyric acid methyl ester (PSBTBT:PC70BM); zinc oxide (ZnO); and Al. From this Figure, we can see that the two photoactive layers are stacked with an n-type metal semiconductor TiO2 and hole transport layer GO. The electrons from the front cell combine with the holes from the rear cell at the stacked TiO2/GO recombination layer. Fig. 1  (a) Device structure of the polymer tandem solar cells with TiO2/GO as the recombination layer, (b) chemical structures used as photoactive layers, (c) simulated photocurrent generated in tandem solar cells as a function of the thicknesses of the front and rear photoactive layers, and (d) energy levels alignment of all materials used in this study. Simulations of the JSC of the tandem solar cells were carried out to aid the selection of the active layer thicknesses. Fig. 1c displays simulation results of the dependence of JSC on the thicknesses of the active layers. From these simulations, the JSC reaches an optimum value, around 9.0 mA cm−2, when the thicknesses of the PSEHTT:ICBA and PSBTBT:PC70BM layers are around 80 nm and 110 nm, respectively. The optimum value is in agreement with our experimental value (which will be discussed below). The energy level diagram of the organic tandem solar cell is shown in Fig. 1d. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the organic materials are shown along with the work functions of the metal layers. Owing to a conduction band of 1.3 eV (GO layer), electrons in the PSEHTT can be efficiently blocked by an energy barrier of about 2.0 eV.35 The GO valence band of around 4.9 eV should not hinder hole transport. Since the TiO2 has a deep valence band of about 8.1 eV, holes from PC70BM will also experience some barrier of about 1.8 eV. Thus, the electrons and holes coming from the front and rear cells, respectively will recombine in the TiO2/GO recombination layer. From this energy level, and due to the fact that these two cells are connected in series, we can calculate the total VOC of the fabricated tandem solar cells as the summation of the VOCs for front and rear cells, respectively. The energy level of ICBA, PSBTBT, and PCBM have been obtained from the literature.36–38It is worth noting that the thickness of TiO2 and GO could affect the photovoltaic performance, but in this work we fixed the thickness of the interconnecting layer so that should be thin enough (∼35 nm) to avoid large series resistance. Another factor that affects the performance of our tandem solar cells is the thickness of the front and rear photoactive layers. We have optimized the single cells by changing the active layer thickness and found that 80 and 110 nm is the optimum thickness for the front and the rear cells, respectively.In order to understand better the photovoltaic performance, especially in terms of the change in the photocurrent and photovoltage, Fig. 2 reveals the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of (Fig. 2a) ITO/GO/PSEHTT:ICBA and (Fig. 2b) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PSBTBT:PC70BM of front and rear cells, respectively, while Fig. 2c shows the transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) image of the TiO2/GO recombination layer. We can observe that no damage or defect can be detected from this TEM image. An obvious change in surface morphology was observed in each pair of the composite thin films, that is, PSEHTT:ICBA and PSBTBT:PC70BM, indicating that the observed variation in photocurrent might come from the morphology. However, the RMS roughness value for the front cell is rather high, approximately 9.77 nm, while the rear cell has an RMS value of only 1.20 nm. As we can also see from Fig. 2b, the RMS roughness of the rear cell is lower than that of the front cell. This indicates that the TiO2/GO recombination layer has successfully functioned as a robust support for the fabrication of multiple layers of the rear cell and also shielded the front cell from any deterioration during the fabrication process. Fig. 2  AFM images of (a) GO/PSEHTT:ICBA and (b) PEDOT:PSS/PSBTBT:PC70BM layers coated on an ITO substrate. (c) TEM image of the TiO2/GO recombination layer deposited on an Si substrate. Fig. S1† reports the absorbance spectra of PSEHTT:ICBA and PSBTBT:PC70BM thin films. From the spectra, the average transmittance for PSEHTT:ICBA and PSBTBT:PC70BM thin films are 61 and 57%, respectively.Fig. S2† illustrates a wide XPS scan of TiO2 while the higher resolution spectra of C 1s, O 1s and Ti 2s are shown in Fig. S2b–d.† The C 1s signal for the TiO2 samples is located at a binding energy of 285.10 eV (Fig. S2b†). The O 1s signal for a hydrophobic TiO2 film is shown in Fig. S2c,† indicating a peak at 530.64 eV and a shoulder toward the side of higher binding energies. The same FWHM and Lorentzian/Gaussian mix values were used in the curve resolution of the O 1s spectra. The curve-resolved O 1s signal of the TiO2 sample results in a second peak located at a binding energy of 531.86 eV. This secondary peak is assigned to OH species on the surface. The locations of the binding energy for this peak agree well with the reported value for bulk oxide (O2−).36 The Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 spin–orbital splitting photoelectrons for both samples are located at binding energies of 465.28 and 459.36 eV, respectively, as seen in Fig. S2d.† The peak separation of 5.92 eV between the Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 signals is in agreement with the reported literature value.39 The FWHM of the Ti 2p3/2 signal was 1.2 eV for this sample.Fig. S2e† shows wide scan of XPS of GO, while Fig. S2f† shows the C 1s spectrum, respectively. For an as-cast GO film the C 1s signal is divided into two major peaks: a carbon–carbon peak of CC/C–C in aromatic rings (284.6 eV) related to sp2 carbon bonding; carbon–oxygen peaks of C–O (286.1 eV), CO (287.5 eV), and C(O)–(OH) (289.2 eV) related to sp3 carbon bonding.40Fig. S3† displays the XRD patterns for both front and rear cells recorded at room temperature using Cu Kα (1.54 Å) as the incident radiation. From these patterns, we can see that the PSEHTT:ICBA and PSBTBT:PC70BM are both crystalline in nature.The IR spectrum of the TiO2 film shows ν(CH) stretching modes of the –CH3– of the metal oxide region around 2800 cm−1 (Fig. S4a†). Although the specimen is hydrophobic, the band appearing from 3420 to 3680 cm−1 indicates the presence of hydroxyl groups. The absence of the sharp bands in the region of 3630–3680 cm−1 suggests that the hydroxyl groups represented by these bands are completely modified by the metal oxides via surface modification. The band for the bridging hydroxyl group, 3420 cm−1, is still evident, but the band for the monodentate hydroxyl group, 3500 cm−1, is not resolved. The presence of different types of oxygen functionalities in GO (Fig. S4b†) was confirmed at 3400 cm−1 (O–H stretching vibrations), at 1720 cm−1 (stretching vibrations from CO), at 1600 cm−1 (skeletal vibrations from unoxidized graphitic domains), at 1220 cm−1 (C–OH stretching vibrations) and at 1060 cm−1 (C–O stretching vibrations).41Fig. 3a shows a comparison of the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the tandem solar cells and corresponding single active layer front and rear solar cells. Their structures are front cell: ITO/GO (10 nm)/PSEHTT:ICBA (80 nm)/TiO2 (40 nm)/Al (100 nm), rear cell: ITO/GO (10 nm)/PSBTBT:PC60BM (100 nm)/ZnO (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) and tandem cells: ITO/GO (10 nm)/PSEHTT:ICBA (80 nm)/TiO2 (40 nm)/GO (10 nm)/PEDOT:PSS/PSBTBT:PC70BM (110 nm)/ZnO (10 nm)/Al (150 nm). Device performance is tabulated in Table 1. The front cell demonstrates a VOC = 0.94 ± 0.02 V, a JSC = 10.39 ± 0.3 mA cm−2 and a FF = 66 ± 0.2%, leading in a PCE = 6.42 ± 0.1% averaged over 117 devices. The rear cell demonstrates a VOC = 0.68 ± 0.03 V, a JSC = 13.14 ± 0.2 mA cm−2 and a FF = 62 ± 0.3%, leading in a PCE = 5.51 ± 0.1% averaged over 117 devices. Finally, the tandem solar cells demonstrate a VOC = 1.62 ± 0.01 V, a JSC = 8.23 ± 0.2 mA cm−2, a FF = 63 ± 0.2% and a PCE = 8.40 ± 0.2%, averaged over 117 devices fabricated in five different runs. However, the best tandem cell exhibited a VOC of 1.65 ± 0.02 V, a JSC of 8.68 ± 0.2 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 68 ± 0.2%, resulting a PCE of 8.60 ± 0.2%. It is worth noting that the obtained values of JSC are in good agreement with the values predicted via optical simulations (see Fig. 1c). As tabulated in Table 1, the JSC of tandem solar cells is lower than that of the JSCs for the front or rear cells. This is because the JSC of the rear cell will certainly be low since, the incoming light has to pass through multiple stacks of layers before it can reach the photoactive layer in the rear cell, thus JSC in the rear cell is normally less that of the front cell since it is less absorbing. By taking this into account, we have constructed our tandem solar cells based on different polymers leading to the highest measured power conversion efficiency, PCE, of about 8.60%; still the JSC of our tandem solar cells are slightly lower than those of the front and rear cells. The statistical data (see Table 1) reveals that the VOC of our tandem solar cells is the ideal summation of the VOCs of the front and rear cells. As noted above, the merging process of the electrons from the PSEHTT:ICBA-based solar cell, with the holes from the PSBTBT:PC70BM-based solar cell can be observed at the TiO2/GO recombination layers. As a result, the key observation in this study is that a perfect or resistance-free recombination layer induces a high VOC. The VOC of the prepared tandem solar cell is 1.62 V, reaching 100% of the summation of the front and rear VOCs. These numerical data provide evidence that our fabricated front and rear cells have been effectively connected in series, as shown in Fig. 3a. This also implies that the energy level alignment between the work function of TiO2 and the ionization energy of PSEHTT as well as the work function of TiO2/GO and the electron affinity of PC70BM allows, under illumination, for the alignment of the quasi-Fermi levels of the bottom and top cells without loss in the photovoltage generated by the cell.

However, a number of studies have reported the presence of S-shaped kinks in single layer devices, which leads to reduce photovoltaic parameters such as FF, VOC and JSC. One possible explanation is due to the presence of charge traps. Recently, we have also observed S-shaped kinks in tandem solar cells of pristine devices, where in these works various recombination layers have been adopted.24,26,42 In these reported studies, the authors concluded that one alternative way to eliminate S-shaped kinks is with UV illumination treatment. Conversely, in our previous reported work employing a ZnO/PEDOT:PSS recombination layer, we have demonstrated that no UV illumination treatment is needed in order to obtain a high FF.43 Loo and Schmidt et al.44,45 also demonstrated a low FF in their pristine device containing titania as an electron selective layer. However, they were able to improve the FF upon illumination with UV light, and they attribute this enhancement to a reduction of the metal-oxide work function. When the metal-oxide served as electron-collecting electrodes, the work function reduction is well-matched to the electron affinity of the acceptor material and subsequently enhances the device performance. Thus, we can conclude that in order to achieve a reasonable value of FF, the work function of the cathode must be well matched with, or smaller than, the electron affinity of the acceptor in the active layer. From Table S2,† one can see that only a few reported works with specific recombination layers are able to get an ideal VOC from the summation of the VOC from the front and the back cells. As mentioned above, by means of TiO2/GO layer we are able to obtain a perfect summation of these VOCs.In Fig. 3b the PSEHTT:ICBA-based front cell gave a photoresponse from 350 to 700 nm with the highest EQE value at 456 nm which corresponds to 58%. Meanwhile, the rear cell consisting of PSBTBT:PC70BM gave a wider photoresponse from 350 up to nearly 900 nm. As we can see from the rear cell, the highest EQE value is 43% at 610 nm wavelength. The EQE spectra followed the absorption spectra very well.As is generally accepted, PEDOT:PSS may lead to considerable device instabilities not only in OSCs but also in other organic devices, which is an essential motivation to replace PEDOT:PSS with a transition metal oxide (TMO) hole–extraction layer. Astonishingly, as shown in Fig. 4, the use of a TiO2/GO layer instead of PEDOT:PSS allows for drastically improved device stability for devices under continuous illumination. The cell temperature was 48–50 °C with 30% relative humidity during the measurements. After 720 hours, the cell efficiency drops to about 8.3% of the initial PCE. The observed decrease of the PCE in all cases is mainly due to a deterioration of both JSC and FF (this can be evidenced by the increment of the RS from 23 to 29 Ω cm2). Recent review on PEDOT:PSS as anode interlayer have been discussed by Krebs et al.46 however, in spite of this extensive review, the particular causes of device instability owing to the incorporation of PEDOT:PSS are still controversial. In addition and in agreement with our observation, Voroshazi et al.47 have recently studied the degradation of OSCs based on PEDOT:PSS where they found that the degradation occurred even under an inert atmosphere. They proposed that the degradation is possibly due the residual moisture in the PEDOT:PSS layer which causes corrosion of the cathode layer. A comparable mechanism may be responsible for the deterioration of our cell in an inert atmosphere. On the other hand, the cell with TiO2/GO recombination layer are found to show dramatically improved stability, where after 2880 hours of continuous illumination the PCE retains 80% of its initial value (Fig. 4). The observed decrease in the PCE is mainly due to a deterioration of both JSC and FF, although the VOC is almost unchanged. We can therefore conclude that our solution processed TiO2/GO recombination layers allow for OSCs with a long-term stability. Fig. 4  Efficiency decays of organic tandem solar cells. Data is plotted every 720 hours and averaged over 117 identical devices. Today, there are basically two groups that have reported organic tandem solar cells with the efficiency of higher than 10%1,2 and the best PCE for tandem solar cells has been demonstrated by Heliatek1 using vacuum deposition technique. On the other hand, Yang et al.2 have demonstrated an all solution processed tandem cell with a high PCE of about 10.6%. They2 reported also that their encapsulated device retained more than 90% of this after 30 days of air exposure. However, it is worth noting that even though our fabricated device has been outperformed by the others (Heliatek and Yang Yang groups), the stability of our device is excellent under long-time continuous illumination.ConclusionsIn summary, we demonstrated extremely stable all solution processed organic tandem solar cells using an inorganic recombination layer. The TiO2/GO layer has been shown to display a large LUMO and HOMO contrast between its two interfaces with the bottom and top active layers, leading to low absorption losses and to be robust enough for the fabrication of tandem solar cell devices using all-additive solution processing. Despite its simple architecture, the recombination layer was found to be robust enough to withstand the solution-based processing conditions of the rear cell. The high efficiencies, averaging 8.4% and high fill factors, averaging 63%, measured in these tandem cells show that a metal-oxide semiconductor such as TiO2 modified with air-stable GO, is an excellent candidate as a recombination layer for highly efficient tandem solar cells. With this recombination layer, higher efficiency could be achieved if donor polymers with a broader and more complementary spectral absorption were employed. In addition, this simple organic tandem solar cell has shown extremely stable behavior under long and continuous light illumination.ExperimentalMaterials preparationITO glass substrates with a sheet resistivity of ∼15 Ω sq−1 were patterned using acid etching and cleaned in sequential ultrasonic baths of detergent in deionized water, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. Nitrogen was used to dry the substrates after each of the last three baths. Graphene oxide aqueous solution (Graphene Supermarket) was purchased and used without further purification. The sol–gel method for producing TiO2 is as follows: titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, Aldrich, 99.999%, 10 mL) was prepared as a precursor and mixed with 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99%, 50 mL) and ethanolamine (H2NCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99%, 5 mL) in a three-necked flask equipped with a condenser, a thermometer and an argon-gas inlet/outlet. Then, the mixed solution was heated at 80 °C for 2 h in a silicon-oil bath under magnetic stirring, following by heating to 120 °C for 1 h. The two-step heating (80 and 120 °C) was then repeated. The typical TiO2 precursor solution was prepared in isopropyl alcohol. Poly[(4,4′-bis(3-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:′′3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,5-(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo)[5,4-d]thiazole]:indene-C60 bisadduct (PSEHTT–ICBA) (1:1, weight ratio) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) and 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT) (ODCB–ODT = 100:2.5, v/v) for the first active layer. The second active layer of PSBTBT:PC70BM was prepared with a 1:1 weight ratio in chloroform solution (10 mg of PSBTBT/1 mL of solvent). The PSEHTT has been synthesized according to the published work by Jenekhe and co-workers,35 ICBA and PCBM have been supplied from Lumtec while PSBTBT has been purchased from Solarmer.Device fabrication and characterizationThe GO solution was spin coated onto ITO substrates, at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 120 °C for 20 min on a hot plate in ambient air. The thickness of GO was estimated to be around 7.5 nm. Later, the substrates were immediately transferred into a N2-filled glove box. The front photoactive layer of PSEHTT:ICBA was coated by spin coating at a speed of 800 rpm for 30 s and vacuum dried for 1 h. The estimated thickness was approximately 80 nm. The first recombination layer, TiO2 was then spin coated on top of the front photoactive layer at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. After spin-coating the TiO2 layer, the substrates were left in a hydrolysis process for an hour before they were annealed on a hot plate in ambient air at 100 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the TiO2 layer was estimated to be around 40 nm. Afterward, GO as the second recombination layer was coated onto TiO2 following the same conditions as previously described.48 Subsequently, the rear photoactive layer of PSBTBT:PC70BM was coated by spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 30 s. The thickness of PSBTBT:PC70BM was estimated to be approximately 110 nm. Next, a 20 nm of ZnO was deposited on the substrates at a spin speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min. Substrates were finally loaded into a vacuum thermal evaporation system, and 100 nm of Al was deposited through a shadow mask. The overlap area between the patterned ITO and evaporated Al was 0.04 cm2. In this work, more than 117 devices have been fabricated with 90% of these devices demonstrated the PCE of more than 8%, and the average of our tandem cells is 8.40%. All thicknesses were measured by AlphaStep on independent films deposited on ITO substrates. One can expect thickness variations of approximately 10% to 20% with different batches as well as thickness inhomogeneities created by spin coating. For tandem solar cells, the layers comprising PSEHTT:ICBA/TiO2/GO/PEDOT:PSS/PSBTBT:PC70BM were electrically isolated using toluene and methanol, along the perimeter defined by the area of the top electrode to avoid the fringing effects and also prevent overestimation of the photocurrent generated by the tandem cell. During the measurements and stability tests, a shadow mask (0.04 cm2) with a single aperture was placed onto the tandem solar cells in order to define its photoactive area. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2410 source unit. The EQE measurements were performed using EQE system (Model 74000) obtained from Newport Oriel Instruments USA and HAMAMATSU calibrated silicon cell photodiode used as a reference diode. The wavelength was controlled with a monochromator 200–1600 nm. Simulations of the optical properties of the cells were carried out using the transfer matrix method.49AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by CAPES-PNPD and Industrial Strategic Technology Development (10045269, Development of Soluble TFT and Pixel Formation Materials/Process Technologies for AMOLED TV) funded by MOTIE/KEIT.Referenceshttp://www.heliatek.com/?lang=en.J.
