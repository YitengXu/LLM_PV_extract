    , Accepted 17th August 2017First published on 17th August 2017AbstractWe present here a symmetrically structured bifacial solar cell tailored by two fluorescent photoanodes and a platinum/titanium/platinum counter electrode, yielding extra-high short-circuit current densities as high as 28.59 mA cm−2 and 119.9 μA cm−2 in simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5) and dark–light conditions, respectively.
Photovoltaics are photoelectric conversion devices that can convert solar energy into electricity by complicated photochemical or photoelectrochemical processes. Mesoscopic solar cells including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs, Grätzel cells),1 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells,2 polymer solar cells,3 and perovskite solar cells4 are highlighted by simple manufacturing, cost-effectiveness and increasing efficiency, therefore they are regarded as promising candidates for silicon solar cells. Great achievements have been made by either optimizing cell architectures or upgrading new materials and techniques. Unfortunately, a remaining challenge throughout the history of mesoscopic solar cells is weather- and theory-dependent electricity output.5 A desirable property in designing high-efficiency solar cells is to realize maximal absorption and conversion of solar energy into electricity. The state-of-the-art devices absorb photons using light absorbers and convert them into electrons under sunlight illumination, therefore the low-energy photons from infrared light in dark conditions are useless, making a zero output for photovoltaics. Although partial near-infrared light below 1000 nm can be converted into visible light for up-converting mesoscopic solar cells, the incorporation of nanostructured up-conversion materials always destroys percolating electron pathways, yielding enormous electron traps and limited efficiency enhancements on sunny days, not to mention persistent power generation in dark–light conditions.6,7 Additionally, the theoretical efficiency of mesoscopic solar cells individually is highly dependent on the Shockley–Queisser principle, limiting the further improvement of electricity output.8,9 Following this line of thought, a challenging objective for markedly enhancing the total power generation is to either increase the solar cell efficiency under irradiation or to develop persistent photoelectric conversion ability in the dark, not to mention the combination of these two challenges into a single mesoscopic solar cell device.
Previous study in this field was mainly placed on integrating nanogenerators developed by Wang or rain energy-harvesting films from our group with photovoltaics.10–14 In this article, we present a sustainable power source with extra-high short-circuit current by fabricating bifacial Grätzel cells with economically viable materials and scalable fabrication technologies. Featuring light absorbing–converting–releasing behaviors of photoanodes, the so-called hybridized bifacial solar cells are demonstrated to yield electricity persistently under ambient sunshine and in a completely dark environment. Different from traditional bifacial devices,15,16 the rear light is utilized with high-efficiency without passing through transparent counter electrodes and liquid electrolytes.17 Moreover, photogenerated electrons from both front and rear sides are simultaneously collected by a metallic Ti substrate, yielding an extra-high short-circuit current output from a single solar cell device.

Fig. 1a illustrates the schematic diagram of our bifacial solar cell with symmetrical glass/FTO/dye-TiO2/LPP (long persistence phosphor)/electrolyte|Pt/Ti/Pt|electrolyte/LPP/dye-TiO2/FTO/glass architecture, comprising of two dye-sensitized TiO2/LPP photoanodes, bilayer redox electrolyte having I−/I3− couples and a Pt/Ti/Pt counter electrode (CE). According to the charge-transfer processes in Fig. 1b, the Pt/Ti/Pt CE has dual functions in catalyzing I3− reduction reaction (the corresponding characterization of electrocatalytic ability is presented in Fig. S1, ESI†) and collecting electrons from external circuits,18,19 doubling short-circuit current in a single device. The dye-TiO2 photoanode converts photons from visible light into electrons, as shown in Fig. 2a, the incident light below 550 nm is almost absorbed by photosensitive dyes. However, critical light loss beyond 550 nm is observed and it reaches maximal 60% in the near-infrared region. By modifying the mesoscopic TiO2 film with long persistence phosphors, the lost light across the dye-TiO2 layer suffers re-absorption by LPPs (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2, ESI†), emitting monochromatic green photofluorescence, as shown in Fig. 2b. The TiO2/LPP photoanode has broad emission peaks centered at 515 nm under excitation ranging from 600 to 950 nm. The emission spectra demonstrate that the fluorescent photoanode has an ability to up-convert near-infrared light into visible light, which matches the absorption peak at 526 nm for N719 dye (Fig. 2c).20 In this fashion, the green emission from LPP phosphors will further excite N719 dye to release electrons persistently, which can be cross-checked from the optical images of bifacial photovoltaics under completely dark conditions, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is obvious that the color of the dye-TiO2/LPP photoanode areas is much darker than that of the boundary areas, meaning that the fluorescence can be almost completely absorbed by organic dyes. It is well-known that LPPs are energy-storing optical materials that can absorb light ranging from ultraviolet to infrared regions and persistently emitting visible fluorescence for maximal hundreds of hours after ceasing illumination.21 Therefore, the green-emitting TiO2/LPP photoanode can last for several hours under dark conditions (Fig. S4, ESI†), realizing power generation of the resultant solar cells at night. By developing robust LPPs with super-long afterglow and high luminescence intensity for solar cell applications, the generating duration can cover the whole night.

Fig. 2d compares the J–V characteristics of various solar cells under simulated sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5). As shown in Table 1, the device without LPP phosphors yields an η of 7.1%, Voc of 0.723 V, Jsc of 13.33 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.6% upon illumination from the front or rear side. Intriguingly, upon simultaneous illumination from two sides, this architecture equals to parallel connection of two symmetric solar cells, therefore creating nearly unchanged η, Voc, FF and doubled Jsc. Both photovoltaics yield zero current and voltage in completely dark conditions because the dark J–V curve passes through the origin of coordinate, as shown in Fig. 2d. This result demonstrates that the final solar cells do not have an ability to generate electricity in the dark. Upon generation by the green-emitting TiO2/LPP photoanode, the η and Jsc are increased to 7.57% and 15.01 mA cm−2 for single-side irradiation without degrading the interfacial charge-transfer resistance (Fig. S5, ESI†), respectively, arising from up-conversion and green photofluorescence compensation of LPPs (which can also be cross-checked by the IPCE measurement, as shown in Fig. S6, ESI†). A Jsc as high as 28.59 mA cm−2 is recorded on two TiO2/LPP photoanodes tailored by solar cells with simultaneous bifacial irradiation. To date, the experimental results along with extra-high Jsc output from a single solar cell show great potential application of these bifacial solar cells with symmetric structures in enhancing the total power output by capturing scattering light from the rear side.

Apart from extra-high Jsc under sun illumination, these bifacial solar cells are also highlighted by the persistent power generation in the dark. As shown in Fig. 3a, the dark J–V curves illuminated from a single side or both sides do not pass the coordinate origin when ceasing sunlight, suggesting an electricity output even at night. In comparison to a zero power output for traditional photovoltaics in the dark, the device under single-photoanode excitation yields a power output of 11.62 μW cm−2 (see Table 1) with a Voc of 0.325 V, Jsc of 64.46 μA cm−2 and FF of 55.5%. Similarly, after being exposed to two-sided illumination for five minutes and ceasing irradiation, the current density and electricity output of bifacial solar cells are doubled to 119.9 μA cm−2 and 22.27 μW cm−2 under dark conditions, respectively. In this conclusion, the solar cell that can generate two-fold electric energy under both sunny and dark–light conditions has been experimentally realized, showing the rational design of bifacial photovoltaics assisted by two TiO2/LPP photoanodes and a Pt/Ti/Pt CE. Meanwhile, Fig. 3b presents the histogram for power output extracted from 50 devices for single-side and bifacial solar cells, demonstrating the high degree of reproducibility by using the TiO2/LPP anode as “sun” under dark conditions.

In addition to the efficient electricity generation, one of the most important requirements for bifacial solar cells is the prolonged luminescence of the TiO2/LPP photoanode to persistently re-excite dye molecules under the dark–light conditions. As shown in Fig. 3c, the time-resolved PL delay measurement of the TiO2/LPP photoanode has been conducted to validate the optical afterglow lasting time. Obviously, the fluorescence intensity has an abrupt reduction within the first several minutes and subsequently degrades moderately over the next few hours, which can also be cross-checked according to the optical images (see Fig. S4, ESI†). It is known that the electricity output is highly dependent on the incident light intensity.22 Following this line of thought, it is expected that the power output of bifacial solar cells will delay gradually under absolutely dark conditions. For this purpose, the normalized parameter delay behaviors of the bifacial device as a function of storage time have been investigated as shown in Fig. 3c and the corresponding J–V curves under various delay-time are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†). After operating in dark–light conditions for forty-minutes, around 47% of the initial electricity output can still be retained. Therefore, in a realistic environment such as a power station, the surrounding light (scattering and reflected light) passing through the dye-TiO2 film can be re-absorbed and stored in LPP phosphors owing to the up-conversion ability, leading to the feasible path to optimize integral power output. In addition, exploring advanced LPP materials with prolonged luminescence lifetime and enhanced intensity to fabricate bifacial electricity-generated all-weather solar cells may induce a photovoltaic revolutionary in the future.23
Furthermore, superior sensitivity to solar irradiation for bifacial solar cells is a determination in practical applications within micro-electrical modules.24,25 Intriguingly, the photo current signals from various devices with or without LPP materials can be up to the maximized values along with the exposure to simulated solar light, whereas quenching to the lowest values upon removing the energy sources (the “light-on” effect as shown in Fig. 3d), demonstrating the effective charge-transfer along the TiO2 network (see Fig. S5, ESI†). It should be noted that the dark current for LPP tailored bifacial solar cells is doubled in comparison to single-side solar cells and much higher than that of zero from the traditional device, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†).
In summary, a bifacial solar cell, doubling short-circuit current and power outputs as well as persistently generating electricity in the dark, has been experimentally realized by a new device architecture. The photo Jsc is as high as 28.59 mA cm−2 with a conversion efficiency of 7.1% under simulated sunlight irradiation, while the dark Jsc is determined to be 119.9 μA cm−2 with the output power of 22.27 μW cm−2. The extra-high short-circuit current and efficiency arise from electron stacking from two side re-utilization of green photofluorescence. This work moves us forward to high energy-harvesting photoelectric devices via converting full-spectrum sunlight into monochromatic light and breaking the impasse of weather-limited electricity generation.
