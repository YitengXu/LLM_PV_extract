    , Accepted 27th December 2018First published on 28th December 2018AbstractSolution-processed organo-lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising optical gain media for tunable coherent light sources. The lasing performance is generally determined by the as-synthesized crystal quality. Noble metal nanostructures have been widely utilized to enhance optical responses due to their unique property of localized surface plasmon resonance. Herein, we report a simple method to enhance the near-infrared amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) performance of MAPbI3 polycrystalline films by solution-processing a PMMA spacer layer and an Au NR-doped PMMA top layer on perovskite thin films. As a result, the ASE threshold of the triple-layer perovskite film was significantly reduced by around 36% and the ASE intensity increased by 13.9-fold, compared to the pristine film. The underlying mechanism was attributed to the combined effects of surface passivation by PMMA and plasmon resonance enhancement of Au NRs. The passivation effect results in suppressing the nonradiative recombination and prolonging excited state decay, which have been investigated by transient absorption and pump–probe measurements. The plasmon effect is systematically studied through distance-dependent and spectra-dependent plasmon enhanced emission. The perovskite films with PMMA and Au NR coating showed great stability for 180 min under intense pulse laser continuous irradiation. The improved ASE performance still remained after leaving the film under the atmosphere for more than one month. We have successfully demonstrated a highly stable and sustained ASE output from MAPbI3 films under pulse laser excitation. This study provides a general approach for exploring plasmonic nanostructures in combination with polymers in the development and application of low-cost solution-processed semiconductor lasers.
Introduction
Halide perovskite materials have been known to display excellent optoelectronic properties and are easily fabricated by solution-processing. They have been utilized in the development of solar cells and light-emitting devices. The power conversion efficiency of solution-processed perovskite solar cells has rapidly exceeded 20% within a very short term, due to the large absorption coefficient, balanced and long diffusion length, low density of defect states and high ambipolar charge mobility property in perovskite materials.1–3 Meanwhile, by altering the halide constituent to engineer their bandgap, perovskite thin films show tunable emission from the ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelength range with high quantum yields, making them attractive candidates as noncoherent and coherent light source materials.4–10 Taking advantage of a large absorption coefficient and a low defect density, researchers have experimentally demonstrated that perovskites can act as admirable optical gain media for high performance solution-processed semiconductor lasers. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), one typical type of lasing phenomenon, was firstly demonstrated in organo-lead halide perovskite (MAPbX3, where X = Cl, Br, or I) thin films at low temperature by Xing et al. in 2014.6 Following this work, perovskite thin films were integrated with various cavity configurations such as the distributed Bragg reflector and whispering-gallery resonator to realize room temperature lasing.11–15 Very recently, Giebink et al. have made use of MAPbI3 thin films with phase transition as their gain material and produced a second-order distributed feedback laser, demonstrating continuous-wave lasing under optical pumping at a low temperature below 160 K.16 These promising results bring us closer to achieve the ultimate goal of developing an electrically pumped laser by using solution-processed perovskite films. However, without the complex resonator configurations, the main laser characteristics are mostly determined by the crystal quality of perovskite films. Additionally, the organo-lead perovskite films suffer from intrinsic poor stability under the atmosphere and moisture, which dramatically restricts their lasing performance. It is strongly desirable to find an effective way to directly improve the lasing performance as well as the stability of the as-prepared perovskite films.
Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely utilized to enhance absorption and emission intensity due to their unique optical property of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The combination of noble metal NPs and gain materials has been proved to be a good strategy for improving the lasing performance. For example, Heydari et al. demonstrated threshold reduction and emission enhancement owing to the coupling effect between gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and gain polymer layers in a random laser system.17 Ma et al. reported using gold nanospheres (Au NSs) to improve the ASE performance of a red-emissive polymer by increasing the density of the excited states (gain) and decreasing energy losses (loss).18 Song et al. deposited aluminum nanoparticles (Al NPs) onto CsPbBr3 nanorods by electron beam evaporation and achieved plasmon enhanced lasing performance.19 Apart from the high cost of electron beam evaporation, this method can hardly control the shape of the metal NPs to tune the LSPR wavelength, and thus hinders the plasmonic enhancement of tunable emission colour from the big family of perovskite films. Coating noble metal NPs with various shapes onto perovskite thin films using solution processing seems a simple approach for applications of plasmonic enhancement. Gold nanorods (Au NRs) with transverse (∼520 nm) and tunable longitudinal LSPR (700–900 nm) bands are coincident with the absorption and emission bands of organo-lead halide perovskites, respectively. It is likely that Au NRs will induce a significant plasmonic enhancement on the ASE lasing performance of MAPbI3. So far the studies on taking advantage of LSPR of Au NRs to optimize the lasing characteristics of perovskite thin films are rare. One of the major challenges is that the as-prepared water-dispersed Au NRs cannot favourably interact with the organic perovskite precursor. Directly coating them on the perovskite film will destroy the polycrystalline structure of perovskites by erosion of water. Based on our previous work, the original hydrophilic CTAB surfactant of Au NRs can be replaced with alkanethiol molecules such as PEG-SH through the strong binding interaction between Au and the thiol group of PEG-SH.20 As a result, the PEG-SH-modified Au NRs can be well dispersed in various organic solvents, providing the opportunity of integrating Au NRs with perovskites through solution-processing.
In this work, we developed a simple approach to improve the ASE performance of MAPbI3 thin films by employing the polymer PMMA and Au NRs. After replacing CTAB with PEG-SH, Au NRs can well disperse within the PMMA chlorobenzene (CB) solution. The blend of Au NRs and PMMA was easily spin-coated onto fresh MAPbI3 thin films. Due to the surface passivation from the polymer as well as the plasmonic effect from Au NRs, the laser threshold of MAPbI3 thin films was reduced by more than 36% and the output lasing intensity is significantly increased by over ten times. More excitingly, the poor stability of perovskite films under irradiation and atmosphere is dramatically improved by polymer coating, due to the strict isolation from air and moisture in the atmosphere.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead(II) iodide (PbI2), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and ascorbic acid were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Ethanol and chlorobenzene were purchased from J&K Scientific. Silver nitrate (AgNO3), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) hydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and O-[2-(3-mercaptopropionylamino)ethyl]-O′-methyl-polyethylene glycol (PEG-SH, Mw 5000) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All solvents were of analytical grade and used as-received without any further purification.
Preparation of PEG-SH-capped Au NRs
Au NRs were prepared according to a previously reported seed-mediated method.21 First, HAuCl4 (50 mM, 50 μL), CTAB aqueous solution (0.1 M, 10 mL) and ice-cold NaBH4 (10 mM, 0.6 mL) were mixed in a flask to form a brownish-yellow seed solution. This seed solution was kept at room temperature for 4 h. Then a mixture of CTAB solution (0.1 M, 40 mL), HAuCl4 (50 mM, 0.4 mL), different amounts of AgNO3 (10 mM), HCl (1 M, 0.8 mL) and ascorbic acid (0.1 M, 0.32 mL) were blended as a growth solution. The growth solution became colourless after gentle shaking. Finally, the seed solution (100 μL) was added into the growth solution and the reaction mixture was left undisturbed overnight. The obtained Au NRs were purified once by washing with deionized water to remove excess CTAB and re-dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water. The PEG-SH capped Au NRs were prepared by using a method previously reported by Thierry et al.22 The aqueous Au NR solution (5 mL) was mixed with 2 mL of 2 mM PEG-SH solution and the reaction mixtures were left overnight under vigorous stirring. In this process, the original CTAB surfactant molecules on the surface of Au NRs were replaced with PEG molecules through the formation of strong binding between Au and the thiol group of PEG-SH.
Preparation and characterization of MAPbI3 thin films
MAPbI3 films were prepared via a modified two-step process, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. 40 μL of 400 mg mL−1 PbI2 precursor solution (DMF) was spin-coated on a quartz substrate at 2800 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 80 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 60 μL of 35 mg mL−1 MAI solution (ethanol) was deposited on the annealed PbI2 layer by spin coating at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Then this blend layer was heated at 100 °C for 2 h, resulting in the formation of the MAPbI3 film. The polymer and Au NRs were subsequently coated on the top. 50 μL of PMMA solution (CB) with different concentrations was dropped onto the MAPbI3 films by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s, respectively, forming a space layer between Au NRs and the perovskite film to further investigate the distance dependent plasmonic enhancement. Finally, 80 μL of PEG-SH capped Au NRs (20 pM)–PMMA (15 mg mL−1) solution (CB) was cladded as the top layer. All experiments were performed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The microstructures of perovskite films were investigated using both scanning electron microscope (SEM, Merlin) and atomic force microscope (AFM, LT STM). The crystallinity was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO MPD).

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and lifetime measurements
PL spectra and lifetime measurements were performed by utilizing both femtosecond and nanosecond pulse lasers as the excitation sources. The femtosecond excitation source was an output at a central wavelength of 520 nm with a pulse duration of 120 fs and a repetition rate of 1 kHz, which is generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime) pumped by using a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator seeded regenerative amplifier (Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace). The nanosecond (ns) pulsed laser is the output of the tunable laser (Opolette™ 355 LD) with a wavelength of 520 nm, a pulse duration of 7 ns, and a repetition rate of 20 Hz. The excitation beam was focused onto the sample with a beam diameter of 250 μm. The emission was collected by using a pair of lenses at the direction perpendicular to the excitation beam to minimize the scattering and directed into a monochromator (Princeton Instruments, Acton 2300i) with two exit ports. One port is coupled with CCD (Princeton Instruments, Pixis 100B) for PL spectrum measurement. The other port is mounted with a photon counting detector combined with a Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system (HydraHarp 400) for PL lifetime measurements. A long-pass filter with the cut-off wavelength at 645 nm was placed at the entrance of the monochromator to remove the scattering from the excitation light.
Transient absorption and pump–probe measurements
Time-resolved transient absorption and pump–probe measurements were performed by using the same femtosecond laser system for PL measurements. The regenerative amplifier laser gives output laser pulses with a central wavelength at 800 nm and a pulse duration of 100 fs. The 500 nm output laser pulse of the optical parametric amplifier (Spectra Physics, TOPAS-Prime) was utilized as the pump beam. A small portion of the 800 nm beam from the amplifier laser was focused onto a 1 mm sapphire plate to generate white light continuum. The white light beam was split into two beams, one as the probe and the other as the reference to correct the pulse-to-pulse intensity fluctuations. The intensities of the signal and reference beams were measured by using photodiodes that were connected to lock-in amplifiers and a computer. The pump beam was focused onto the sample with a beam size of 250 μm and overlaps with the smaller-diameter (100 μm) probe beam. The delay between the pump and probe pulses was varied by using a computer-controlled translation stage (Newport, ESP 300). The pump beam was modulated by using an optical chopper at a frequency of 500 Hz. The variation transmittance at the selected probe wavelength by using a monochromator (Princeton Instruments, Acton SP2150i) is recorded as a function of time delay between pump and probe pulses. All the experiments were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
The MAPbI3 film with a thickness of ∼350 nm was prepared via a modified two-step process, as demonstrated in Fig. 1a. The details are described in the Experimental section. The morphology of the as-prepared perovskite film is presented in Fig. 1b–e. The AFM image (Fig. 1b) gives the mean square average roughness of the perovskite film of ∼11.4 nm. As shown in SEM and its cross-section images (Fig. 1c–e), the grains of the MAPbI3 film closely pack without any pinhole, indicating the good polycrystalline quality of the perovskite thin film. After covering the polymer layer, the surface of the film became much smoother (ESI, Fig. S1†). The thickness of the polymer layer can be varied by the concentration of PMMA in CB solution. The absorption and PL spectra of the perovskite film (Fig. 2a) are in good agreement with the previous results reported on solution-processed MAPbI3 films.23,24 The observation of narrow-band emission located at 770 nm indicated a high-quality perovskite film with a low density of defect states. The good crystallinity of the perovskite film was also confirmed by the narrow line width of diffraction peaks in XRD patterns in Fig. 2b. As PMMA is a highly transparent polymer with a non-crystalline nature, it does not exhibit any sharp diffraction peaks in XRD patterns and only contributes to the baseline observed in our measurements. The perovskite films with and without PMMA coating all show a set of dominant diffraction peaks located at 14.07°, 28.42° and 31.92°. According to the previous report, these three peaks can be assigned to the (110), (110) and (310) planes of MAPbI3 crystalline films, respectively, suggesting the formation of a tetragonal structure.25–28 The XRD peak at 12.60° related to the (001) plane of PbI2 is attributed to the remnant unreacted PbI2 or the conversion from MAPbI3 into PbI2 by degradation.25,29,30 Compared to the pristine perovskite film, the film with PMMA coating shares obviously higher diffraction peak intensity and the peak intensity ratio of PbI2 (001 plane, 12.60°) to that of MAPbI3 (110 plane, 14.07°) increased from 18% to 24% without PMMA, which provide evidence for the low degradation of MAPbI3 by PMMA encapsulation.25,30 PMMA is hydrophobic and effectively blocks moisture corrosion of MAPbI3 lattices, and thus a larger quantity of MAPbI3 crystalline films and a smaller amount of PbI2 were observed in the MAPbI3/PMMA film. Besides, the passivation of PMMA (discussed later) was found to reduce the trap densities by electronically compensating the iodide vacancy along the boundary, which may also retard perovskite degradation to PbI2 by hindering the reaction with oxygen.25Fig. 2a also demonstrates the absorption spectra of Au NRs that were utilized to investigate the plasmonic effect on the emission of perovskite films. The Au NRs with a dimension of 23 × 70 nm display a longitudinal LSPR at 775 nm which overlaps with the absorption and emission of perovskite films and were expected to achieve plasmon enhanced emission of the perovskite film. As the prepared aquatic Au NRs will destroy the crystalline structure of the perovskite by erosion of water, the original hydrophilic CTAB surfactants were replaced with PEG-SH. The PEG-SH-modified Au NRs can be well dispersed in the PMMA gel CB solution, enabling solution-processing of Au NRs on the top of the perovskite film to study the plasmonic influence of Au NRs. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the LSPR peaks of Au NRs doped in the PMMA film are slightly blue shifted (∼3–5 nm) due to the change of the refraction index from CB (n = 1.52) to PMMA (n = 1.49), but still well overlapped with the absorption and emission of perovskite films due to the broad LSPR bands of Au NRs.

(b) XRD patterns of quartz/PMMA, MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/PMMA films. 
Before investigating the plasmon effect, power-dependent PL measurements were conducted on MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/PMMA films to clarify the encapsulation activities by the pure PMMA layer. The thickness of the PMMA coating is ∼40 nm (Fig. 1e). As shown in Fig. 3a and b, upon gradually increasing the excitation fluence of femtosecond laser pulses, ASE was observed under intense excitation fluence. Under low excitation fluence, spontaneous emission (SE) was obtained, which is identical to the steady-state PL shown in Fig. 2a. As the excitation fluence increased, a sharp narrow peak at 793 nm appeared and quickly became dominating. Fig. 3c shows that the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak narrows sharply from 55 to 8 nm under high excitation fluences, indicating the SE-to-ASE transformation. Compared to the pristine perovskite film, the ASE threshold of the PMMA coated film decreases from 26.5 to 16.9 μJ cm−2. Consistent with the previous report on the MAPbBr3 films, the polymer coating (∼350 nm) can reduce the ASE threshold due to both surface passivation and symmetric waveguide (SWG) effects provided by the polymer layer.31 In our case, the polymer coating is much thinner (∼40 nm). Therefore the SWG effect was greatly suppressed and the enhancement caused by the SWG effect could be ignored.31,32 The passivation by PMMA coating seems to play a crucial role in the reduced ASE thresholds in the PMMA coated perovskite film. The carbonyl oxygen atoms in the ester groups of the PMMA chain with positive charges will interact with the electron-rich sites such as the excessive halide ions by nucleophilic addition, resulting in passivation of deep trap states caused by the halide ions on the surface of the perovskite film.25,31,33 This passivation will reduce the density of defect states and thus greatly restrain the nonradiative recombination, which is beneficial for achieving population inversion and reduction of nonradiative losses. Consequently, the ASE threshold of PMMA coated MAPbI3 is reduced by around 36% compared to that of the uncoated film. To be more general, we also performed the ASE measurements under nanosecond pulse laser excitation (520 nm, 7 ns, 20 Hz). Similarly, the ASE threshold reduced from 47 μJ cm−2 to 31 μJ cm−2 (Fig. 3d). Compared to femtosecond pulse laser excitation, the higher threshold under ns laser excitation is ascribed to the shorter Auger recombination lifetime with a timescale of ps.34–36 For illustration purposes, we demonstrate all the results of the film with Au NR coating under femtosecond pulse laser excitation.

To investigate the plasmonic effect on the ASE performance of the perovskite film, Au NRs in PMMA solution was sequentially spin-coated onto the MAPbI3/PMMA films. The doping concentration of Au NRs in PMMA is very low and aggregation induced coupled NPs are negligible. As shown in Fig. 4, the PMMA space layer with a gradually increased thickness (0–45 nm) provides a separation between the perovskite and Au NRs, which allows us to study the distance dependence of the plasmon effect. The ASE intensity was found to strongly depend on the thickness of the PMMA middle layer that separates Au NRs and the perovskite, which is consistent with the previously reported results that metal enhanced photoluminescence is strongly separation distance dependent.37–39Fig. 4a shows the excitation power dependent ASE spectra of samples with maximum ASE intensity enhancement, which occurs at a PMMA layer thickness of 8 nm with an enhancement factor of 2.4 compared to the film with PMMA coating and 13.9 compared to the pristine film without PMMA coating. The thinner or no space layer resulted in reduced ASE intensity or even ASE quenching, while a larger thickness of the space layer resulted in less ASE intensity enhancement. Generally, there are three possible mechanisms responsible for the ASE intensity variation: excitation efficiency being enhanced by local field amplification, surface plasmon induced increased radiative decay rate, and non-radiative energy transfer induced quenching.40,41 The first two factors result in emission enhancement, which requires excellent spectra overlap between perovskite excitation and emission spectra with the LSPR wavelength of Au NRs. As shown in Fig. 2a and 4b, Au NRs with longitudinal LSPR at a peak wavelength of 775 nm, which are well overlapped with the excitation and PL spectra of perovskites, obviously enhanced the ASE intensity of the perovskite film. While the film with shorter Au NRs (longitudinal LSPR peak at 670 nm), which are poorly overlapped with the emission of perovskites although the transverse LSPR still matched with an excitation wavelength of 520 nm, shows no enhancement on ASE intensity. These results indicated that the first mechanism (excitation efficiency enhanced by local field amplification) can be excluded in our experiments due to the very weak local field of transverse LSPR, but the second mechanism (surface plasmon coupled emission) should play a dominant role in the observed ASE intensity enhancement. As mentioned, all three mechanisms are strongly dependent on the space distance between the emission medium and metal NPs. The local field of LSPR coupling emission enhancement is proportional to the power of the local electric field, which decays exponentially with the separation distance. The third mechanism of energy transfer induced quenching dominates at the surface and quickly drops off with increasing space thickness. In our experiment, both the energy transfer induced quenching and LSPR coupled emission enhancement affect the ASE intensity. When Au NRs and MAPbI3 are very close or in direct contact (the space thickness is less than 8 nm), the third mechanism of energy transfer induced quenching dominated, resulting in the observed decrease of ASE intensity phenomena. When the separation distance increases, the second mechanism of surface plasmon-coupling induced radiative decay rate increase becomes dominant, resulting in significant ASE intensity enhancement as observed. The enhancement factor decreases with increasing separation distance. Consequently, the optimal enhancement occurred at an intermediate spacer thickness of ∼8 nm. Compared with the obvious improvement in ASE intensity, the lasing threshold seems unaffected by the plasmon effect, which is attributed to the negligible local field enhanced excitation efficiency induced by the transverse LSPR at the excitation wavelength. The slightly lower threshold observed without the spacer was ascribed to the higher transmittance at the excitation wavelength of the PMMA layer with a smaller thickness.

The numbers indicated in the labels represent the thickness. 
Based on the above discussion, the lasing threshold reduction and intensity enhancement of the MAPbI3 film can be ascribed to the surface passivation of the polymer layer and surface plasmon enhancement of Au NRs, which suppress the non-radiative recombination and increasing radiative decay rate, resulting in an increased internal quantum yield. To further investigate these processes, time-resolved measurements were performed on MAPbI3, MAPbI3/PMMA and MAPbI3/PMMA (thickness = 8 nm)/Au NR films. Transient absorption (TA) spectra of all films display the same valley with a peak wavelength of 750 nm, which is equal to the band gap energy of MAPbI3 (ESI, Fig. S4†). This negative optical density change (ΔOD) was attributed to the ground state bleaching of inter-band transition, consistent with previously reported results.3,29,42 The temporal evolution of TA at a band-edge transition wavelength of 750 nm and an emission wavelength of 770 nm on MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/PMMA films were presented in Fig. 5. The single wavelength dynamics show a strong pump-fluence dependence, which was well explained with the free carrier recombination model including single-carrier trapping and electron–hole radiative recombination.43,44 The decay lifetime becomes shorter with increasing pump fluence due to Auger recombination.34,45 Under weak pump fluence lower than the ASE threshold, all the dynamics shows a transient bleaching build-up within ∼14.9 ps and a relaxation recovery in a timescale of 2–3 ns. This slow build-up transition is indicative of the carrier accumulation based on the state-filling effect. Under intense pump fluence above the ASE threshold, the build-up process rises within hundreds of fs just after pumping, which facilitates the population inversion of ASE by very quick carrier accumulation and less optical losses. Compared with the temporal decay at different probe wavelengths, we found that the recombination dynamics at an emission wavelength of 770 nm exhibited a stronger dependence on pump fluence than that of inter-band transition at a wavelength of 750 nm. The relaxation decay of the perovskite with PMMA coating has an obviously longer lifetime compared with the pristine perovskite. Based on the free carrier recombination model, the recovery dynamics can be well fit with a single exponential function at a probe wavelength of 750 nm and a biexponential function at a probe wavelength of 770 nm.3,42,43 Under an identical pump intensity, the perovskite film with polymer coating possesses less defects by passivation, leading to a slower recombination rate by reducing trap-assisted recombination channels. This longer recombination time is also supported by the observed longer emission lifetime as shown in Fig. 6. The emission lifetime of MAPbI3 with polymer coating is longer than that of the pristine film, due to the surface passivation effect of PMMA.31 In contrast, the MAPbI3/PMMA film with the Au NR top layer shows a shorter emission lifetime than the MAPbI3/PMMA film. A biexponential function was used to well fit the emission decay. The effective decay time constant of the MAPbI3/PMMA film is 6.8 ns, and decreases to 6.3 ns with Au NRs. The shortened PL lifetime suggests that interactions with LSPR of Au NRs resulted in an increased radiative decay rate, which can be regarded as strong evidence of surface plasmon-coupling enhanced emission.17,37 However, the pump–probe dynamics curves are similar on MAPbI3/PMMA with and without the Au NR top layer (ESI, Fig. S5†), which is due to the limited scan range of the decay time (up to 2.1 ns).

Finally, the excellent stability of the polymer and Au NR coated perovskite film was demonstrated to show great potential for practical applications. As shown in Fig. 7, the ASE spectra of the film with the polymer and the Au NR coating have nearly no obvious variation under continuous irradiation for 180 min under excitation with a femtosecond pulse laser at a fluence of 25.4 μJ cm−2, revealing promising photostability. The tiny variation of the spectra is ascribed to the fluctuation of the pulse laser during the measurement. Additionally, the stability of the film against aging was tested by maintaining the films at room temperature without any protection under the atmosphere (with average humidity of 50%) for 48 days or even longer. Similar spectra were obtained from fresh and 48 day old samples under the same excitation fluence. The minor changes of the spectra arise from the difference of different excitation points in the films. We have checked with more than tens of different points to double confirm that similar spectra were observed on fresh and aged samples by covering the polymer coating. The polymer exhibits a prefect encapsulation effect from air and moisture, consequently greatly improving the ASE stability of the perovskite film.

Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a facile solution processing approach to enhance the ASE performance of MAPbI3 perovskite films. Through coating of a PMMA spacer layer and an Au NR top layer, the perovskite film shows a remarkable reduced ASE threshold and enhanced ASE intensity. The ASE threshold of the perovskite thin films was significantly reduced from 26.5 to 16.9 μJ cm−2 due to the surface passivation of the PMMA layer, supported by the prolonged emission lifetime as confirmed by pump–probe measurements. The maximum intensity enhancement was achieved when the PMMA spacer layer thickness was 8 nm and the longitudinal LSPR wavelength of Au NRs overlapped with the emission of the perovskite film. The underlying plasmon enhancement mechanism can be ascribed to a competition effect of increased radiative and non-radiative decay rate induced by Au NRs. More importantly, the perovskite films with PMMA and Au NR coating show great stability with stable and sustained output within 180 min under intense pulse laser irradiation. Furthermore, the super-stable ASE performance can be reproduced by arbitrarily storing the film under the atmosphere for 48 days or even longer, benefitting from strict encapsulation of polymer cladding. Our results demonstrate a highly stable near-infrared ASE output with low thresholds and strong intensity from MAPbI3 polycrystalline films under both fs and ns pulse lasers, which may provide a general method for exploring plasmonic nanostructures in combination with transparent polymers in the development and application of perovskite lasers.
