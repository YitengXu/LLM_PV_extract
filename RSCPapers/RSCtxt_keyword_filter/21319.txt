    , Accepted 11th December 2018First published on 13th December 2018AbstractSmall-area perovskite solar cells (PSCs), prepared by a spin-coating technique have rapidly achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% and improved stability. Large-area and efficient PSCs prepared by the scalable deposition technique are urgently required for continuous mass production. Herein, high quality perovskite films and devices have been prepared via a newly developed grooved roller coating (GRC) technique. A critical groove depth of 6 μm has been proven to generate uniform perovskite films with average 594 nm sized grains and a shifted dominant plane from (110) to (224). Time-resolved photoluminescence confirms the balanced interfacial charge transfer (60.8 ns) and bulk transport life time (140.6 ns) for efficient PSCs. GRC-prepared perovskite films demonstrate competitive qualities compared with those prepared by a standard spin-coated (SSC) technique, based on both of which PSC shows a similar PCE of 15.26% for the GRC and 15.76% for the SSC. Finally, the PSCs based on fully roller-coated SnO2, perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD achieve a PCE of 12.34%, which is the highest PCE value obtainable by the roller coating technique and the first PCE obtained by fully roller coating. Therefore, the results predict that GRC could be a facile and effective method for large-area and continuous mass production of PSCs for future commercialization.
Introduction
Significant progress has been made in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for small areas using spin-coating methods, resulting from advances in high-quality and controllable crystallization of perovskite films. Since 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lab-scale perovskite solar cells has rapidly improved from 3.8% to 23.7%,1–7 revealing their tremendous commercial potential as a new generation of thin film photovoltaics. However, the active area of devices made via laboratory-scale methods like spin coating are still hovering in the doorway of industrialized application, because the film processed by spin coating is inhomogeneous over large areas. Otherwise, the spinning process is an inefficient and non-continuous process along with an inevitable waste of materials. Therefore, it is widely considered difficult to be compatible with low-cost continuous industrialized production. In order to scale up the area of perovskite thin films, various scalable solution deposition methods, such as blade coating,8–12 soft-cover deposition (SCD),13,14 spray coating,15,16 slot die coating17,18 and so on,19–25 have been developed. Although these technologies have made a breakthrough, which obviously increased the performance of large-area PSCs, there are still many problems that need to be addressed simultaneously, for example, antisolvent extraction in a one-step method, the utilization rate of materials, and suitability for continuous R2R processing.23,26,27 The PSCs with successively roller-coated PbI2 and MAI, first investigated by Na and co-workers,28 showed PCEs up to 7.35% with the aid of an additive, which also demonstrated the capability of continuous mass production on flexible substrates by a R2R process. However, the PCE of 7.35% by the flat roller coating is still too low in the PSCs field. The precise control of the thickness and the quality of functional thin films forming PSCs should be further manipulated.
In this work, we firstly adopted a special roller with regular grooves on the surface for a facile one-step fully roller coating process, which is called the grooved roller coating (GRC) method. The groove structure on the roller surface is unique and critical for fabricating high-quality thin films in this work. The thickness and quality of the GRC-coated thin films can be controlled by the tunable groove depth which is finally determined to be 6 μm. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of precursor solution concentrations in the GRC processes and found the proper concentration of 1.1 M produced perovskite films with relatively uniform and average 594 nm sized grains. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements also confirmed the balanced interfacial charge transfer time of 60.8 ns and long bulk lifetime of 140.6 ns, which is vital for outstanding cell performance. Eventually, we obtained a large (100 cm2) and specular perovskite film based on which the device achieves a competitive PCE of up to 15.3% in a 0.1 cm2 active area and a 23 times higher utilization ratio of material than that of the spin-coating method. Furthermore, we fabricated the first fully roller-coated PSCs via GRC technique, differing from previously reported research, mainly focusing on perovskite films themselves rather than the electron transport layers (ETLs) and the hole transport layers (HTLs). Among the fully roller-coated ETLs, perovskite and HTLs prepared by the GRC method, the best device showed a PCE of 12.3%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest PCE value of fully roller-coated PSCs and the first reported PCE by the GRC method. More interestingly, the GRC developed here has the unique advantage of depositing uniform films onto flexible substrates since the straight roller itself can flatten the uneven surface of flexible substrates while simultaneously transferring the precursor solution through the various groove's structures. Therefore, we believe that the GRC technique is a facile and competitive route to realize the commercial applications of up-scaling most solution-processed thin film optoelectronics including PSCs.
Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals and solvents were used as received unless stated otherwise. The grooved roller is commercially available. The SnO2 colloid precursor was obtained from Alfa Aesar (tin(IV)oxide). The perovskite precursor solution contained a mixture of MAI and PbI2 (1:1, molecular ratio) in anhydrous DMF:DMSO 9:1 (v/v). Methylammonium acetate (MAAc) was synthesized according to the reported literature with a slight modification.29 Briefly, 50 ml of ethanol, 5 ml of acetate (99.5%, Aladdin Reagents), and 12 ml of methylamine (30–33 wt% in ethanol, Aladdin Reagents) were added sequentially in a 250 ml round-bottom flask. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and then put into a vacuum chamber with a solid desiccant (silica gel). The chamber pressure was maintained at 0.1 MPa for 24 h. The resultant colorless and viscous liquid was stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox for further use.
Device fabrication
FTO glass was cleaned sequentially in detergent, acetone, isopropanol and deionized water before using. The FTO was cleaned by UVO for 15 min. Then, the SnO2 nanoparticle film (7.5%), as an ETL, was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s, or roller-coated at a speed of 10–50 mm s−1 using a roller with a groove depth of 6 μm, and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 30 min.31 After that, 50 μl of a 1.3 M MAPbI3 precursor solution with an additive (10–15% MAAc, volume ratio) was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 3000 rpm for 70 s onto SnO2 surface, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Meanwhile, MAPbI3 precursor solution of a different concentration, with the additive (10–15% MAAc, volume ratio), was dropped onto SnO2 surface and instantly roller-coated at a speed of 10–50 mm s−1 using a roller with groove depths of 2 μm, 6 μm and 10 μm, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. During this coating process the SnO2 substrate was heated to 40 °C. The hole transporting layer (HTL) solution was prepared by dissolving spiro-OMeTAD (80 mg), tBP (28.5 μl) and a Li-TFSI (35 μl) solution (260 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile) in 1 ml chlorobenzene and spin casted on the perovskite film at 6000 rpm for 30 s, or roller-coated at a speed of 10–50 mm s−1 on top of the perovskite absorbing layer film. Then, an Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. Otherwise, N2 gas flow was also introduced to the dry wet-films acceleratedly in all roller-coating processes.
Characterizations
The absorption spectra were measured with a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000) in the wavelength range of 300 to 1200 nm at room temperature. The morphology of the perovskite films was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F). A solar simulator (HAL-320, Asahi Spectra Co. Ltd., Japan) with a compact xenon light source was used to produce the simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), and the calibration of the light was carried out by a detector (CS-20, Asahi Spectra Co. Ltd., Japan) with a silicon reference cell. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells were measured at 25 °C. The scanning step was 40 mV for the J–V curve measurement. Unless specified, a bias scan from 1.2 V to −0.2 V was run first (reverse scan) followed by a return back (forward scan) with a delay time of 50 ms. A metal mask with a window of 0.1 cm2 was covered on the light illumination side to define the active area of the cell. The spectral response was measured by an external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurement) with a scanning step of 10 nm. A xenon arc lamp was used as the monochromatic light excitation source and filtered by a double grating. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed by a spectrometer (Edinburgh FS5) at room temperature with a laser wavelength of 532 nm and power of 0.2 mW respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were studied on a Rigaku ATX-XRD with Cu Kα radiation (k = 1.5405 Å).
Results and discussion
The coating process is schematically presented in Fig. 1, from which it can be seen that the functional layers of the ETL, perovskite and HTL are coated by the grooved roller coating (GRC) technique sequentially or individually to form perovskite solar cells. Basically, the coating process by the GRC, with a manual feeding of solution, is conducted according to the procedures for the lab-scale demonstration, as shown in Scheme S1.† First of all, a tiny amount of the precursor solution, which is different from the mass amount of solution used for the conventional coating techniques like spin-coating, spraying or doctor blading, is dropped across one edge of the substrate. Secondly, the precursor solution is squeezed by the grooved roller with a controlled speed towards one direction, which forms a uniform wet layer of the precursor solution with a controlled thickness precisely confined by the groove depth. Finally, the wet layer of the precursor solution is dried or solidified by N2 blowing or heating at a certain temperature to form the functional layers of the ETL, perovskite or HTL. Compared with other coating techniques like the standard spin-coating (SSC) method, the utilization ratio of material by the GRC is impressively high. It is approximately 49.3%, based on the calculations in Table S1 of the ESI,† which is about 23 times higher than 2.1% of the SSC. As far as we know, this utilization ratio of material is one of the highest reported values,13,30 which will certainly enhance the overall cost-performance. Furthermore, this utilization ratio of materials can be further improved with an automatic and continuous feeding apparatus as schematically demonstrated in Scheme S2.† Meanwhile, the GRC is considered as an effective method for large area and continuous mass production towards future commercialization. This is because the production capability of GRC can be at least 72 m2 h−1, based on a calculation assuming a length of 400 mm (the longest dimension on the market, but it can be home-made even longer) of the commercially available roller and a rolling speed of 50 mm s−1 (which can be accelerated depending on the demand). Fig. S1† presents 100 cm2 sized perovskite films fabricated via the GRC in just 2–3 seconds, where the uniform and integrated morphology in the left image obviously demonstrate the advantage of the GRC method over the spin coating method. Another important aspect that should be mentioned is that as one of the contact deposition techniques, the GRC developed in this work has a unique application advantage on flexible substrates since the straight roller itself can flatten the uneven surface of flexible substrates while simultaneously transferring the precursor solution, by varied groove structures such as depths, width and even complex patterns.
 Fig. 1  Schematics of the grooved roller coating (GRC) method to prepare the perovskite solar cells, layer by layer, based on the solution process where the thickness of each layer can be basically controlled by the groove depth. TCO, ETL, PVK and HTL stand for the transparent conducting oxide, the electron transporting layer, the perovskite and the hole transporting layer, respectively. 
The first prerequisite to achieve excellent cell performance is constructing each functional layer with a reasonable thickness, especially for the perovskite absorber layers. The GRC can freely adjust the thickness of each functional layer. Taking the perovskite layer as an example, we prepared the perovskite layers with different thicknesses by varying the groove depth to 2 μm, 6 μm and 10 μm. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the thickness of the central perovskite layers changes from 300–400 nm for the 2 μm groove depth (Fig. 2a), 400–500 nm for the 6 μm groove depth (Fig. 2b), and 600–800 nm for the 10 μm groove depth (Fig. 2c), indicating that even by controlling the groove depth only, the thickness of the perovskite layer can be effectively tailored from 200 nm to 1000 nm. According to the literature,4–6 the optimal thickness for an efficient PSC is about 450 nm, therefore, the roller with a groove depth of 6 μm is the best choice for the 1.1 M precursor solution. Interestingly, it was noticed that the thickness of the perovskite layer on the substrate with dimension of 2 cm × 4 cm can be divided into three regions during the GRC with the manual feeding of solution: the initial region, stabilized region and recirculating region. For the initial region, covering the first 1 cm length of the substrate where the precursor solution is introduced before coating (as seen in the Scheme S1a†), the nucleation process takes place over a relatively longer time since the excessive amount of the precursor solution postpones the supersaturation and limits the nucleation for a thicker film, resulting in a relatively thin thickness of less than 200 nm. The case is different for the stabilized region where the thickness of the wet layer is only few micrometers (as seen in the Scheme S1b†), and the nucleation happens quickly under solvent evaporation for local supersaturation, leading to the formation of a perovskite layer with uniform thickness across the central 2 cm length of substrate. The rapidly increased thickness in the recirculating region is due to the fact that when finishing the coating process, the redundant precursor solution from the roller recirculates back onto the substrate and accumulates for a thicker perovskite layer covering the last 0.5–1 cm length of the substrate (as seen in Scheme S1d†). It should be mentioned that with an automatic and continuous feeding apparatus (like a syringe pump or other designs) to replace the current manual dropping method for future continuous mass production, both the initial region and recirculating region could be avoided, or at least minimized. Therefore, the GRC is an effective way to prepare uniform and large-scale films for PSCs. Fig. S2† demonstrates the GRC prepared perovskite film with dimensions of 4 cm × 6 cm where the initial region and recirculating region are confined.
 Fig. 2  Thickness distributions of perovskite films coated by the GRC method with a variation of groove depth of 2 μm in (a), 6 μm in (b) and 10 μm in (c). The dimensions of the conducting substrate are 20 mm × 40 mm and the concentration of the perovskite precursor solution is 1.1 M. 
In order to prepare the highly efficient PSCs, the quality of the perovskite layer should be elaborately tailored first. To this end, we scrutinized the effect of the precursor solution concentration on the quality of the perovskite films. Firstly, the thickness distribution maps of the perovskite films are presented in Fig. 3a–e with a variation of the precursor concentration from 1.3 M to 0.5 M. It can be seen that all of the maps demonstrate a similar distribution trend with the aforementioned three regions, while the thickness of the central perovskite layers gradually changes from 400–1000 nm for the 1.3 M solution, 450–500 nm for the 1.1 M solution, 400–440 nm for the 0.9 M solution, 300–400 nm for the 0.7 M solution and 200–300 nm for the 0.5 M solution in Fig. 3a–e, respectively. These results indicate that the concentration of the precursor solution is another effective factor to control the thickness of the perovskite layers and the optimal concentration is 1.1 M, judged solely from the reasonable thickness of 450–500 nm for efficient PSCs.

The groove depth used in this experiment was 6 μm and the dimensions of the conducting substrate were 20 mm × 40 mm. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed firstly to investigate the morphology of the perovskite layers prepared with different concentrations. It can be obviously seen in Fig. 4 that a higher concentration solution produces a general perovskite layer with a larger grain. A possible reason is the fact that with the same wet layer thickness, which is controlled by the same groove depth, a higher solution concentration accelerates the supersaturation and facilitates grain growth with sufficient solutes supplied for larger grains eventually. According to the SEM images shown in Fig. 4, the average grain size is about 510 nm for the 1.3 M solution with a wide size distribution, having some grains even larger than 1500 nm and some tiny grains even smaller than 90 nm (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the 1.1 M solution prepares a perovskite layer with a narrower size distribution, having an average grain size of 594 nm and few grains larger than 1000 nm and smaller than 120 nm (Fig. 4b). For diluted solutions, the perovskite films exhibit relatively smaller average grain sizes, which are 446 nm for the 0.9 M solution (Fig. 4c), 397 nm for the 0.7 M solution (Fig. 4d) and 284 nm for the 0.5 M solution (Fig. 4e). The grain size distributions for those films are relatively wider than those obtained from the concentrated solutions. At the same time, there are some pinholes observed in the perovskite films from the 1.3 M and 0.5 M solutions. This could be because the vigorous grain growth and the lower flowability of the solutes in the limited amount of solvent fail to fill the small gaps between the grains for the 1.3 M solution. An inadequate solute supply in the 0.5 M solution generates certain difficulties in fully covering the whole substrate during the grain growth, as also evidenced by the relatively thin thickness of 200 nm, shown in Fig. 3. It is well known that films with larger grains and pinhole-free morphologies are always desirable for better cell performance due to minimized defects located along the grain boundaries and non-occurrence of short circuits through pinholes. Therefore, the 1.1 M perovskite precursor solution is currently the best choice with regard to grain size and morphology.

The grain size distribution is plotted in (f) by counting all grains in each SEM image. The scale bar represents 400 nm in all SEM images. 
The crystal structure was further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 5, based on the perovskite films obtained from various concentrated solutions. The typical peaks at 14.0° and 28.0° are indexed as planes of (110) and (220) for all MAPbI3 perovskite films in this study, as shown in Fig. 5a. The increasing intensity of (110) clearly indicates well crystalline nature and an increased grain size of the perovskite films (Fig. 5b), which is consistent with the observation of the SEM images in Fig. 4. At the same time, the crystal orientation reconstruction has been observed in the perovskite films obtained from the 1.3 M and 1.1 M solutions since the peaks at 20.0° of plane (112) and 40.0° of plane (224) are obviously detected where the dominant plane shifts from (110) to (224) for the film of the 1.1 M solution. This shift is possibly due to the methylammonium acetate (MAAc) assisted reorientation of PbI2 from (001) to (101) via the formation of the intermediate adduct of PbI2·MAAc.21 Moreover, the PbI2 peaks of (001) are magnified in Fig. 5c, where, except for the nearly complete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite for the 1.3 M solution, there are certain residuals of PbI2 detected for other perovskite films, especially for that of the 1.1 M solution. According to the literature, a slight amount of PbI2 within perovskite films could passivate the grain boundaries or the surface of perovskite films and result in a positive effect of cell performance.31,32

The optical properties of perovskite films were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy, while the charge transfer and recombination behaviors were characterized by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). The results are shown in Fig. 6. First of all, the absorption measurement results, shown in Fig. 6a, reveal a steadily increasing light harvesting ability of the perovskite films as the thickness increases. As shown in Fig. 6b, the PL intensity gradually increases as the solution concentration increases suggesting the results are mainly influenced by the thickness of the perovskite films, since the extraction layer of SnO2 is the same. In Fig. 6c, the PL decay is fitted by a bi-exponential rate law:33Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + y0where A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes and τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes for the fast and slow recombination, respectively. The long lasting component is due to the recombination occurring in the bulk of the perovskite structures, whereas the fast relaxation component could be attributed to the surface recombination.34 The decay is mainly attributed to trap-assisted recombination at defects. The rapid decay time, τ1, of the perovskite films gradually increased from 23.1 ns through 56.6 ns to 100 ns as the concentration increased from 0.5 M through 0.7 M to 0.9 M, as shown in Table S2,† indicating a faster charge transport at the interfaces of perovskite/SnO2 for the perovskite films prepared with lower concentrations. This might be due to better contact between the perovskite films with small grains and charge extraction layers. The slow decay lifetime, τ2, within the perovskite films increased from 84.2 ns to 205 ns as the concentration increased from 0.5 M to 0.9 M, indicating longer lifetimes or fewer defects within the larger grain based perovskite films, which is consistent with the SEM results. Based on the fitted results in Table S2,† the charge transport behaviors are different for the perovskite films of 1.1 M and 1.3 M. The crystal structure changes from the dominant plane (110) to the plane (224), resulting in a faster charge transfer of τ1 (60.8 ns) and a shorter lifetime of τ2 (140 ns) for the 1.1 M solution, compared with those of the 1.3 M solution. As a result, the balanced charge transfer and recombination behaviors in the perovskite films from the 1.1 M solution may be vital for a better performance of the PSCs.

Based on the results discussed above, the optimal condition was finally determined to be the solution concentration of 1.1 M and the groove depth of 6 μm for device fabrication by the GRC technique. With the aim of fully preparing PSCs by the GRC technique, the ETL (from an aqueous SnO2 solution) and HTL (from a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene solution) have been prepared with the same GRC technique on conducting substrates. Taking the ETLs as an example, Fig. S3† presents the thickness distribution of the ETLs prepared by the GRC with a groove depth of 6 μm. It can be obviously seen that the thickness of the whole ETLs is about 83 nm, which is thick enough as an efficient ETL.
The J–V curves are plotted for direct comparison in Fig. 7, and the detailed photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 1 and plotted in Fig. S4.† It can be seen from Table 1 that the PSCs prepared with the standard spin-coating (SSC) method, that is device A, achieve a PCE of 15.76% with reverse scanning (RS) and 14.63% with forward scanning (FS). If the perovskite layer was prepared by the GRC method, the PCE of the PSCs (device C) demonstrates almost identical values compared with the PSCs of device A, which is 15.26% for RS (corresponding to about 98% of RS-PCE of device A) and 14.80% for FS (even slightly higher than FS-PCE of device A). It proves that the quality of the GRC-perovskite layer is impressively competitive with that prepared by the SSC method. The long-term stability of the PSCs with a GRC-coated perovskite layer was monitored continuously for 500 h by storing the PSCs in a N2 filled glove box in dark conditions. As shown in Fig. S5,† >87% of the initial PCE was maintained, which is frankly reasonable although not impressive, but could be further improved by interfacial modification for better interfacial charge extraction, defects passivation or encapsulation.35,36 The PSCs with fully GRC coated ETLs, perovskite and HTLs were prepared as well which display an RS-PCE of 12.34% (corresponding to 78% of the RS-PCE of the SSC based PSCs) and FS-PCE of 12.29% (corresponding to 84% of the FS-PCE of the SSC based PSCs). This relatively inferior performance is mainly attributed to the deteriorated fill factor (FF) by the GRC coated HTLs, which might be caused by the relatively higher series resistance of the devices because of the greater thickness of the HTLs, as shown in Table 1. However, the performance of the fully GRC prepared PSCs is still one of the best results obtained by the rolling coating process,28,37,38 revealing its great potential as the scalable deposition technique for large area and continuous high-volume production of PSCs in the future.

Conclusions
To conclude, high quality perovskite films have been prepared via a newly developed grooved roller coating (GRC) technique. The optimal groove depth of 6 μm has been determined to generate uniform perovskite films with average 594 nm sized grains and a shifted dominant plane from (110) to (224). TRPL confirms the balanced interfacial charge transfer (60.8 ns) and bulk transport (140.8 ns) behavior for efficient devices. The GRC-prepared perovskite films demonstrate competitive qualities compared with those of the spin-coated method, based on both of which PSC shows an almost identical device PCE of 15.26% for GRC and 15.76% for SSC. Finally, the PSCs with fully roller-coated SnO2, perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD achieve a PCE of 12.34% with a slightly inferior fill factor, which is the highest PCE value obtained by the roller coating technique and the first PCE by the GRC technique. Therefore, the results predict that the GRC could be scalable and an effective method for continuous mass production of all solution processed thin film optoelectronic devices, including PSCs, for the future commercialization.
