    , Accepted 28th June 2016First published on 28th June 2016AbstractIncreasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) along with the fill factor (FF) is pivotal for the performance improvement of solar cells. In this work, we report the design and construction of a new structure of CdS/CdTe/Al2O3/Cu using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method, and then we control Cu diffusion through the Al2O3 atomic layer into the CdTe layer. Surprisingly, this generates a novel p-type and metallic dual-functional Cu–Al2O3 atomic layer. Due to this dual-functional character of the Cu–Al2O3 layer, an efficiency improvement of 2% in comparison with the standard cell was observed. This novel dual-functional back contact structure could also be introduced into other thin film solar cells for their efficiency improvement.
Although emerging CdTe based thin film photovoltaics (PVs) share the traditional crystalline silicon market and have advantages of competitive efficiency, long term stability and light weight,1–3 there are numerous researchers who still explore new routes to further increase their performance.4–9 From the view of the device structure (front electrode/n-type layer/p-type layer/back electrode) of CdTe thin film solar cells, designing novel structures for the back electrode in order to increase the ability to collect and transport photon-generated holes is an important route for the performance improvement. In CdTe thin film solar cells, the CdTe material has a higher work function (5.5 eV) than most metals, such as Al, Ag, Mo and Zn. Accordingly, the natural contact between the CdTe layer and various metals would produce a high Schottky barrier, which always leads to a “roll-over” phenomenon in the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics. This phenomenon greatly decreases the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), and so the device performance finally deteriorates.10 To solve this problem, the common method is to introduce a back contact layer with an appropriate work function on the CdTe layer to decrease the back contact potential barrier. So far, there is much research focusing on Cu-containing materials, such as ZnTe:Cu, Cu2S, Cu9S5, Cu nanowire graphene slurry, etc.11–15 These Cu-containing materials could form a degenerate heavy p+ dopant in the adjacent CdTe layer and generate a CdTe/CuxTe interface, which would greatly improve the hole collecting ability of the back electrode and increase the Jsc.10 However, this method always brings other problems. The element Cu has a great mobility in the CdTe layer, and it diffuses easily into the p–n junction region. This will result in the decrease of Voc and FF, and the performance of solar cell will greatly deteriorate.16,17 Consequently, controlling the Cu diffusion in the CdTe layer is extremely important in order to get high-performance solar cells.18
In our previous work, we demonstrated that CdTe solar cells based on an ultra-thin Al2O3 layer prepared using atomic layer deposition (ALD) displayed superior performance due to the optimized rectification and tunnelling effects.19 However, the short circuit current (Jsc) decreased slightly due to the rectification effect of the ALD-Al2O3 layer compared with that of the standard cell. Moreover, the Cu film on the CdTe layer could easily diffuse into the p–n junction region, so as to deteriorate the device performance and reduce the cell stability. In another study, we found an appropriate p-type semiconductor (digenite Cu9S5 nanocrystalline film) to act as the back electrode to match with the p-type CdTe (p-type (CdTe) + p-type (Cu9S5), called the p + p model), which produced a good Ohmic contact at the back electrode and a high-performance CdTe thin film solar cell was achieved.14
We noted that Cu and Al2O3 could interdiffuse at the interface to form a p-type Cu–Al2O3 semiconductor film after annealing.20–22 In this paper, we report the design and construction of a new structure of CdS/CdTe/Al2O3/Cu using the ALD method. On one hand, we hope to control Cu diffusion into the CdTe layer using the Al2O3 film. On the other hand, the p-type Cu–Al2O3 layer after annealing might be beneficial for hole transportation and could improve the cell efficiency.23 Surprisingly, the Cu–Al2O3 layer was found to be a p-type and metallic dual-functional layer. It not only increased the Voc and FF due to the p + p (p-type (CdTe) + p-type (Cu–Al2O3)) model with favourable energy level matching at the back electrode, but also avoided the decrease of the Jsc because of its unique metallic conductive property. In addition, the Cu–Al2O3 layer effectively controlled the Cu diffusion and helped to implement the optimal Cu distribution in the CdTe layer, which greatly increased the quantum efficiency in the shorter wavelength range of 500–600 nm. Finally, taking into account the multiple advantages of the novel dual-functional Cu–Al2O3 layer, an efficiency improvement of 2% in comparison with the standard cell was achieved.
The new device structure of FTO/CdS/CdTe/Al2O3/Cu/Au is presented in Fig. 1a. Accordingly, four cells with Cu films of different thicknesses (3, 6, 9 and 15 nm) were fabricated, and the standard cell (STD) was also prepared for reference. The optimized thickness of the Al2O3 film was found to be around 2 nm, because a thicker Al2O3 layer would greatly hinder the Cu diffusion (Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). The cross-sectional image of the CdTe cell was characterized using SEM (Fig. 1b). The thickness of the CdTe layer and the size of the CdTe grain could be estimated as 4–5 μm and 1–2 μm, respectively. These cells were all annealed at the optimized conditions (250 °C, 30 min in the glovebox).
 Fig. 1  (a) The design of a device structure for a CdTe solar cell; (b) cross-sectional SEM image of the CdTe solar cell; (c) J–V characteristics of CdTe solar cells with different Cu thicknesses on 2 nm ALD-Al2O3, the inset is the J–V characteristics of CdTe solar cells in a range of −0.2–1 V; (d) evolution of the photovoltaic parameters, including Jsc, Voc, FF and the PCE for the solar cells with different Cu thicknesses. 

J–V characteristics were measured for all these cells as shown in Fig. 1c. When the thickness of the Cu film is 9 nm, the best efficiency (13.0%) is obtained which is nearly 2% higher than that (11.2%) of the standard cell. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1c, the J–V curve presents a “roll-over” phenomenon when the thickness of the Cu film is 3 nm. It might be due to the imperfect CuxTe layer caused by the insufficient Cu diffusion into CdTe layer. In contrast, a “cross-over” phenomenon is observed when the thickness of the Cu film gets to 15 nm, which might be due to the excessive Cu diffusion into the p–n junction.17 The detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†) and plotted in Fig. 1d. It is clear that all the photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and power conversion efficiency (PCE), increase with the increasing thickness of the Cu film, and reach their maximums when the thickness of the Cu film is 9 nm. In the best case, the Voc and FF are both larger than those of the standard cell, and the Jsc value is nearly equal to that of the standard cell. Consequently, we could conclude that the improvement in PCE was due to the increase of Voc and FF when retaining the high Jsc.
To get insight into the relationship between the improved performance and the properties of the Cu–Al2O3 film after annealing, a device with a typical metal–insulator–semiconductor structure was designed as shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. It was composed of FTO/Cu/ALD-Al2O3/40 nm insulation layer (Al2O3)/Au. Its capacitor character was evaluated at room temperature using high frequency (1 MHz) CV hysteresis curves. The gate bias was swept from inversion to accumulation (forward sweep: −1.5 to 1.5 V). As shown in Fig. 2a, the capacity decreases as the voltage increases, which demonstrates that there is a p-type semiconductor layer forming under the insulation layer.24,25 The result is consistent with the process of Cu + O → Cu2O and Cu2O + Al2O3 → CuAlO2,26 and the mechanism is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Considering the similar bond lengths of Cu–O (1.866 Å) and Al–O (1.911 Å), we guess that the plentiful Cu atoms would take the place of Al atoms, and produce the p-type CuxAlO2.

The inset is the device structure for the capacitance–voltage (CV) measurement; (b) I–V curves of 2 nm Al2O3 devices, the top left shows the device structure for voltage current characteristic (I–V) measurement, the bottom right shows the resistance of the devices with Cu of various thicknesses; (c) the temperature-dependant resistance of the devices with Cu of various thicknesses; (d) the EDX linescan curves of TEM for the Cu–Al2O3 thin film; the top left shows the schematic of the Cu diffusion procedure through the Al2O3 film and the top right shows the TEM image of the Cu–Al2O3 film. 
In order to evaluate the electroconductive property of this annealed Cu–Al2O3 film, a device, whose structure is shown in the top left of Fig. 2b, was designed. The thickness of the Al2O3 film was fixed as 2 nm, and the thickness of the Cu film was adjustable (3, 6, 9 and 15 nm). Their I–V curves were measured in the voltage range of −1.0 to 1.0 V (Fig. 2b). When the thickness of the Cu film was 3 nm, the blue line is not a straight line, which might be due to a small rectification effect and is consistent with our previous work.19 Correspondingly, the resistance versus thickness curve is plotted in the inset of Fig. 2b. When the thickness of the Cu film is more than 6 nm, the I–V curve is straight and the resistance is very low (33–14 Ω), showing a good Ohmic contact between the Cu–Al2O3 film and the Au electrode. The varied-temperature resistances were further measured as shown in Fig. 2c. Remarkably, the device resistance linearly increases with the increasing temperature when the thickness of the Cu film is 6 and 9 nm. They both present a unique metallic conductive property, and the temperature coefficients of their resistance are both estimated as 6.1 × 10−4 °C−1 by calculating the slopes of two lines.27 Moreover, the device resistance with a 9 nm-thick Cu film is always lower than that with a 6 nm-thick Cu film at the same temperature. Based on the analysis above, a Cu–Al2O3 layer with an excellent metallic conductive property after annealing was obtained when the thickness of the Cu film was 9 nm. This excellent conductive property might be beneficial to the transport and collection of photogenerated holes, and leads to a high-performance solar cell. In contrast, when the thickness of the Cu film is 3 nm, the device resistance doesn't increase with increasing temperature, and implies that it shows a kind of semiconductive property.
In order to verify the effect of Al2O3 on the controllable Cu diffusion, we designed and constructed a device to verify the Cu diffusion through the Al2O3 thin film at 250 °C as shown in Fig. 2d. The EDX linescan of TEM was performed to observe the element distribution in the cross section of the device. Obviously, the Cu content in the silica gel layer is higher than in the Al2O3 thin film, which means Cu can diffuse through the Al2O3 thin film. Moreover, the Cu content showed a gradient decrease trend at the Cu/Al2O3 interface, and then kept a constant level in the Al2O3 thin film. This indicated that Cu could be embedded in the Al2O3 thin film to form a p-type and metallic Cu–Al2O3 layer (Fig. 2a and c). In addition, it also indicated that the Al2O3 film could effectively control the Cu diffusion. This phenomenon is in line with our initial prediction.
Carrier lifetime is an important parameter to reflect the recombination level of photo-generated carriers in solar cells. In order to quantitatively evaluate the enhancement of carrier lifetime in the solar cells above, small-amplitude intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was carried out under a 560 nm light source (Fig. 3a). The back contact hole injection lifetime could be extracted from the formula, τ = (2πfmax)−1, where τ is the carrier lifetime and fmax is the maximum response frequency.28,29 As shown in Fig. 3b, the carrier lifetime of these cells are monotonically increasing until the thickness of the Cu film gets to 9 nm, which is consistent with the tendency of various photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 1d). This phenomenon could be explained by the controllable Cu diffusion via the ALD-Al2O3 film and the improved carrier transport ability by the annealed Cu–Al2O3 layer. When the thickness of the Cu film is not enough (3 nm), the CuxTe back contact could not be constructed well, and the photogenerated holes could not be efficiently transported to the back electrode, resulting in a shorter hole lifetime than that of the standard cell. When the thickness of the Cu film is around 6 and 9 nm, the CuxTe back contact could be efficiently constructed by Cu diffusion while not damaging the p–n junction, so the hole lifetimes are longer than the standard one. When the thickness of the Cu film increases to 15 nm, excessive amounts of Cu diffuse into the p–n junction, which results in the decrease of the carrier lifetime.

The valence and conduction band offsets are represented. All of the values are given in eV; (e) EQE of the CdTe solar cell with different Cu thicknesses on 2 nm ALD-Al2O3; (f) the schematic diagram of the Cu diffusion mechanism in the CdTe solar cell. 
To obtain the energy band structure of both the Cu–Al2O3 and Cu-doped-CdTe (CuxTe) regions around the CdTe/Cu–Al2O3 interface, the normalized valence band spectra for the solar cells above are presented in Fig. 3c and Fig. S8 (ESI†). In Fig. S8a (ESI†), the valence band maximum (VBM) of the CdTe surface can be determined as EVBM = 0.60 eV using the linear extrapolation method. Similarly, the VBM values of the different annealed Cu–Al2O3 films were also obtained. The VBM value of the Cu–Al2O3 film in the optimized 9 nm-Cu cell is determined as EVBM = 0.15 eV (Fig. 3c). All the VBM values are shown in the upper left inset of Fig. 3c, where the minimum VBM value emerges when the thickness of the Cu film is 9 nm. Using the values obtained, the offset between the valence band positions of CuxTe and Cu–Al2O3 is derived as 0.45 eV (ΔEVB = 0.45 eV) at the CdTe/Cu–Al2O3 interface in the optimized 9 nm-Cu cell. The ΔEVB values for all the cells are also shown in the Fig. 3c inset, where the 9 nm-Cu cell has the maximum ΔEVB value. In order to obtain the conduction band offset (ΔECB), the band gaps of CuxTe and Cu–Al2O3 are needed. The band gap is 1.04 eV for the CuxTe layer,30,31 and the band gap of the Cu–Al2O3 layer is obtained as 2.7 eV from the UV-Vis transmission spectra in Fig. S7 (ESI†). So a conduction band offset of ΔECB = 2.11 eV is estimated in the best cell. The energy band diagram of the CdTe/Cu–Al2O3 interface can be established as shown in Fig. 3d. The values of EVBM, ΔEVB and ΔECB are listed in Table S5 (and Fig. S8, ESI†) for all the cells. In the best cell, the photon-generated holes in the CuxTe region could easily jump over the contact potential barrier of ΔEVB = 0.45 eV into the Cu–Al2O3 region. The energy band structures of CuxTe and Cu–Al2O3 match very well with each other (Fig. 3d), which will enhance the hole collection and transport efficiency from the CdTe layer to the Cu–Al2O3 layer, and improve the performance of the CdTe cells. Therefore, the high performance of the best cell partly originated from the favourable energy level matching at the CdTe/Cu–Al2O3 interface.
In summary, we constructed a unique device structure of Cu/Al2O3 as the back contact of a CdTe solar cell using ALD. Notably, the annealed Cu–Al2O3 film presents an excellent p-type and metallic dual-functional property, which can not only increase the Voc and FF due to the p + p model with a favourable energy level, but also avoid the decrease of Jsc because of its metallic conductive property. Combining all these advantages in the optimal cell, the best efficiency (13.0%) was obtained, which was 2% higher than that of the standard cell. This efficiency improvement could be implemented in other thin film solar cells, like CIGS, CZTS, and α-Si thin film solar cells, if such dual-functional structures are introduced into these cells.
