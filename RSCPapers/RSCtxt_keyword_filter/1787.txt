However, complete substitution of Pb by Sn undermines the stability of perovskite materials and devices. Therefore, partial substitution of Pb by Sn has attracted much interest to balance environmental considerations and device performance. Here, we exploit the Sn ratio to optimize the band alignment in Pb–Sn mixed perovskite solar cells with an inverted structure. The band edge properties of Pb–Sn mixed triple cation perovskites (Cs/MA/FAPb1−xSnxX3, X = Cl, Br, I) for efficient inverted solar cells are studied via simulation and experiment. The optimized solar cell with x = 0.336 shows the highest power conversion efficiency of 16.10% along with negligible hysteresis. We demonstrate that the devices are stable and maintain 93% of the initial PCE under ambient conditions for 30 days. These results suggest that bandgap engineering is a feasible approach to balance the efficiency and stability of Pb–Sn mixed PSCs.
1. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead (Pb) halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been improved rapidly within the last several years.1–5 However, the toxic metal Pb in perovskites impedes the progress of the commercialization of PSCs. Thus, there is an urgent need to replace Pb in halide perovskites with non-toxic or less-toxic cations.6,7
Among the possible candidate elements, Sn is the most viable one to replace Pb in the perovskite structure because such replacement simultaneously maintains the high structural and electronic dimensionalities, which play a critical role in the performance of solar cells.8–11 Nonetheless, it is still a challenge for the fabrication of high-performance Sn-based PSCs. The first issue is the facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+.12–22 For example, CsSnI3,15,23–25 MASnI3 (ref. 12 and 17) and FASnI3 (ref. 18 and 26) films are not stable due to reconstructive phase transitions induced by thermal or oxygen exposure. Furthermore, Sn vacancies (VSn) are easily formed due to the low formation energy.15 Second, lithium (Li) and/or cobalt (Co) salts in hole transport materials (HTM), for instance, polytriarylamine (PTAA) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), degrade the performance of Sn-based PSCs.26–28 Third, the mismatched energy levels between charge-selective layers and Sn-containing perovskites result in poor photo-generated carrier collection.12,29–31 Finally, the rapid crystallization of Sn-based perovskite films during spin-coating leads to the formation of non-uniform and discontinuous films, degrading the performance of Sn-based PSCs.32–35
To obtain high-performance Sn-based PSCs, Hatton et al. improved device stability and efficiency by co-depositing CsSnI3 perovskite precursors with SnCl2.25 Inverted device architectures have been employed to suppress the negative impact of salt-doped HTMs on Sn-containing perovskite films.11,26,28 Kanatzidis et al. tuned the band gap of MASnI3−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) from 1.3 to 2.15 eV by changing the ratios of I and Br and obtained the highest PCE of 5.73% with MASnIBr2 (Eg = 1.75 eV).12 Meanwhile, they also claimed that hydrazine vapor could potentially suppress the formation of a high-oxidation Sn4+ state. The stability of Sn-based two-dimensional PSCs has been demonstrated to also outperform their three-dimensional counterparts.19,22 Recently, Ning et al. prepared a lead-free 2D-quasi-2D-3D hierarchy structure perovskite and achieved a record PCE up to 9.41% for the lead-free perovskite.36 However, for Sn-containing PSCs, simultaneously obtaining long-term stability and high efficiency is a great challenge.
It has been demonstrated that triple cation PSCs exhibit long-term stability and high efficiency.37,38 In this paper, we optimized the bandgap alignment of triple cation PSCs by substituting Pb with Sn through experiments and simulations. To prevent the degradation of Sn-based perovskites induced by the salt-doped HTM (Spiro-OMeTAD/PTAA), inverted Pb–Sn mixed triple cation PSCs with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) HTM are fabricated. The obtained device with a champion PCE up to 16.10% exhibits good stability and negligible hysteresis.
2. Results and discussion
Several groups have utilized the optimized composition of Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16PbX3 to fabricate efficient and stable PSCs.37,38 Following this optimized composition, we prepared inverted PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb1−xSnxI2.48Br0.52/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/Ag. Here, x is the molar ratio of Sn/(Sn + Pb). The values were set to 0.000, 0.084, 0.168, 0.252, 0.336, 0.420 and 0.840 in our experiments. As shown in Fig. 1a, the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the champion device (Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb1−xSnxX3, x = 0.336) reveals that the thickness of the perovskite layer is around 445 nm. The champion device with an active area of 0.04 cm2 shows the highest PCE of 16.10%, Jsc of 26.59 mA cm−2, and FF of 76.01% under reversed scan (RS), as displayed in Fig. 1b. In Fig. 1c, the integrated value of Jsc (26.19 mA cm−2) from the EQE spectrum is consistent with the results of the J–V curve. The steady state photocurrent output at the maximum power point under an applied voltage of 0.68 V was stable after 200 s continuous 1 sun illumination (Fig. S1†). Fig. 1d shows the J–V curves of the PSCs with different x values. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, PCE and FF, of these PSCs are listed in Table S1.† The results confirm that the device with x = 0.336 shows the best performance. With Sn substitution, the Jsc firstly increases from 19.82 mA cm−2 (x = 0.000) to the maximum 26.59 mA cm−2 (x = 0.336) and then decreases to 15.95 mA cm−2 (x = 0.840). In Fig. 1e, the EQE curves show that the intensity in the short-wavelength region (400–800 nm) and long-wavelength region (800–950 nm) slowly increases as x increases from 0.000 to 0.336, indicating an enhanced light harvest and improved Jsc. For x = 0.420 and 0.840, the Jsc deteriorates due to the considerable EQE loss in the short-wavelength region (400–800 nm). The EQE loss may be ascribed to the reduced carrier lifetime and the increased recombination between the interfaces. In Table S2,† the values of integrated Jsc are summarized and in good agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves.

To investigate the dependence of performance on bandgap alignment in the Pb–Sn mixed PSCs, we conducted ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements to determine the VBM and CBM of Pb–Sn mixed perovskites. The UPS spectra, including onset (Ei) and cut-off (Ecut-off) energy regions, are displayed in Fig. 2a and b. According to the equation presented below:39 EVBM = 21.2 − (Ecut-off − Ei)(1)we calculated the VBM and CBM. We have the energy level diagram of Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb1−xSnxX3, along with the carrier transport layers and electrodes, as shown in Fig. 2c. The UPS spectra for carrier transport layers and electrodes are referenced from ref. 29. It is seen that the VBM and CBM gradually rise with the increase of the Sn content. The results are consistent with previous reports as well.29,30 The bandgap engineering enables the bandgap of perovskites to match the charge selective layers, facilitating the collection of photogenerated carriers.40 According to the results in Fig. 2c, the HOMO position of the hole transport layer (HTL) and the LUMO position of the electron transport layer (ETL) are the best bandgap alignments to the VBM and CBM of the perovskite films with x = 0.336.

To further understand the x dependence of the bandgap and band edge positions of Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb1−xSnxI2.48Br0.52, we performed density functional theory calculations with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) function. As the atomic orbitals of A-site cations contribute little to the band edges, we use large Fr cations to replace the mixed triple A-site (Cs/FA/MA) cations (note that Fr is radioactive and not suitable for actual optoelectronic applications). For the arrangement of the mixed Br/I cations, many possible configurations were examined, and the one with the lowest energy as well as reasonable bandgap was considered as the ground-state configuration and employed for calculations (see Fig. S2†). Fig. 3a shows the calculated bandgaps of FrSnxPb1−xI2.48Br0.52. For FrPbI2.48Br0.52 (i.e., x = 0), the bandgap calculated without spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is 1.51 eV, close to the experimental value of 1.61 eV. With the inclusion of SOC, the bandgap is largely reduced to 0.45 eV, which is mainly attributed to the splitting of the Pb 6p states, as shown in Fig. 3c. For FrSnI2.48Br0.52 (i.e., x = 1), the non-SOC and SOC bandgaps are 0.44 and 0.09 eV, respectively, showing a much smaller SOC-induced bandgap reduction as compared to FrPbI2.48Br0.52, which is due to the smaller relativistic effect of Sn as compared to Pb. Both the non-SOC and SOC bandgaps of FrSnxPb1−xI2.48Br0.52 decrease monotonically with an increase in x from 0 to 1, which is consistent with the experimentally observed trend of the bandgap change shown in Fig. 2c. Fig. 3b shows the aligned valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) positions of the FrSnxPb1−xI2.48Br0.52 system. It is seen that the VBM of FrSnxPb1−xI2.48Br0.52 rises as the x value increases, regardless of whether SOC is included or not, which is consistent with the experimental observations. The VBM of FrSnI2.48Br0.52 is 0.87 eV higher than that of FrPbI2.48Br0.52. As seen in Fig. 3c and d, the Sn 5s orbitals are much higher in energy than the Pb 6s orbitals, and thus the Sn 5s orbitals can push the VBM to a much higher energy level by forming antibonding states with the halogen p orbitals than the Pb 6s orbitals. The non-SOC CBM of FrSnxPb1−xI2.48Br0.52 drops slowly as the x value increases, which is inconsistent with the experimentally observed CBM rise shown in Fig. 2c. The inconsistency is caused by the neglect of the SOC, which has been shown to be important to describe the electronic properties of heavy metal-containing compounds correctly. With the inclusion of the SOC, the CBM rises slowly as the x value increases, which agrees with the experimental investigations. As shown in Fig. 3b, compared with the SOC-VBM, the SOC-CBM rises much more slowly, which leads to gradually reduced bandgaps, enabling the bandgap engineering for better photovoltaic performance.

Note that the energy levels in (b) are aligned by the averaged electrostatic potentials at Fr atoms and the zero energy is set to the VBM of FrPbI2.48Br0.52 calculated without SOC. For each x value, eight random Pb/Sn configurations were examined, the results of which exhibit rather small discreteness.

It is well known that the hysteresis issue can be suppressed by different techniques.41,42 Therefore, it is important to study the hysteresis behavior of the PSCs in this work. The J–V curves of PSCs with different x are measured under a forward scan (FS) and reverse scan (RS) at a rate of 10 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 4a and S3.† To quantify the hysteresis effect, a modified J–V hysteresis index (HI) is calculated by using the following equation:41  where JRS (0.8Voc) and JFS (0.8Voc) represent the photocurrent density at 80% of Voc for the RS and FS. The large value of the hysteresis index indicates a serious hysteresis. As shown in Fig. 4a, the hysteresis index firstly decreases from 0.198 (x = 0.000) to the lowest value 0.005 (x = 0.336), and then increases to the highest value −0.376 (x = 0.840). The negative value means that the forward scan curve is better than the reverse one.

Although the fundamentals of hysteresis are currently inconclusive, we ascribe the following two reasons to the hysteresis behavior in the Pb–Sn mixed PSCs.43–46 Firstly, the hysteresis of PSCs depends on the crystal size of perovskites.41 As shown in Fig. S4,† the grain size of the Pb–Sn-mixed halide perovskite films increases with the Sn substitution. Fig. 4b shows the distribution of grain size for the perovskite with different ratios of Sn. The perovskite film with x = 0.000 exhibits the smallest grain size, and the largest grain size is obtained from the perovskite with x = 0.840. Notably, the morphology of perovskite films with x > 0.336 is not uniform and compact, and some cracks appear between grain boundaries. For the device with x = 0.000–0.336, the hysteresis gradually reduces with the average grain size increasing from 252 to 316 nm. Similar results have been reported by Park et al.41 However, as the grain size continually increases (x = 0.420, 0.840), the hysteresis is obvious again due to the discontinuous morphology of perovskite films.
Secondly, the ion capacitance in PSCs causes the hysteresis.44 As shown in Fig. S5,† while the bias voltage (Vapp) is from 0 V to 500 mV, the champion device (x = 0.336) exhibits low ion capacitance from 2.63 to 3.97 nF cm−2 at 10 Hz, indicating negligible ion accumulation in the device. Nevertheless, the ion capacitance increases to 0.048 μF cm−2 and 0.191 μF cm−2 at a higher bias voltage (800 mV and 1 V), respectively. The results show that the ion capacitance increases with Vapp. The existence of ionic capacitance is due to the bandgap mismatch between the perovskite layer and the charge-selective layers. Here, a physical model (Fig. 4c–f) is used to illustrate the ion capacitance induced by charge accumulation. As shown in Fig. 4c, the champion device (x = 0.336) displays the optimized bandgap alignment without bias voltage. However, the energy level of the PSCs with x = 0.000 is offset (ΔE1 and ΔE2 in Fig. 4d), which is mainly derived from the bandgap misalignment between the perovskite layer and charge-collective layers at interfaces. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, at a bias voltage of 0.9 V, the band inversion results in the accumulation of negative ions and electrons at the interface of perovskite/HTL and holes and positive ionic charges at the interface of perovskite/ETL. Guerrero et al. also reported that the charge accumulation is due to the energy level misalignment at the interface.44 For the device with x = 0.336, the bandgap alignment facilitates the charge transport across the interface and results in negligible hysteresis. But for the device with x = 0.000, the band offsets (ΔE1 and ΔE2) form barriers to block the transport of charges. Therefore, ion capacitance is formed between the interfaces and leads to serious hysteresis behaviors.

Fig. 5a shows the XRD patterns of the Pb–Sn mixed perovskite films. Two typical peaks (at around 14° and 28°), corresponding to (110) and (220) crystal phases, are detected in those XRD patterns. And it is noted that there is no displacement in the Bragg diffraction angles of the two typical peaks, suggesting that the substitution of Pb with Sn causes no disturbance of the lattice orientation. Remarkably, the intensity of diffraction peaks increases with the Sn ratio increasing from 0.000 to 0.420. The intensity of the peak ascribed to the (110) plane reaches the highest value for the mixed perovskite with x = 0.336, and then decreases with the further increase of Sn (x = 0.420, 0.840). Fig. 5b shows the absorption spectra of the Pb–Sn mixed halide perovskite films. An obvious red-shift from 770 nm to 920 nm can be observed as the x value increases, indicating that the substitution of Pb with Sn in Pb-based perovskite materials can effectively reduce the bandgap. The result is also confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum as shown in Fig. 1e. In Fig. S6,† the bandgap is calculated by plotting [E × (1 − EQE)]2 against E and extrapolating the linear portion of the EQE spectra. The results (Fig. S7†) show that the bandgap of the Pb–Sn mixed perovskite films decreases from 1.61 eV (x = 0.000) to 1.36 eV (x = 0.840). Tauc plots of the Pb–Sn mixed perovskite layers in Fig. S8† show a similar bandgap change tendency to that exhibited in Fig. S7.†Fig. 5c shows the high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the Sn 3d region for the mixed perovskite films. The intensity of Sn4+ of the perovskite with x = 0.336 is much lower than that of the perovskite with x = 0.840, indicating that Sn2+ in perovskites is easily oxidized to Sn4+ with the content of Sn increasing. As shown in Fig. 5d, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decays of the perovskite films are determined to study the lifetime of photogenerated carriers further. The fitted parameters are listed in Table S3.† Due to the increase of defect density introduced by Sn, the incorporation of Sn into perovskite films leads to the decrease of the average carrier lifetime (τavg).

(c) High-resolution XPS spectra of the Sn 3d region for the perovskite films (x = 0.336, 0.840). (d) TRPL decay of the perovskite films (x = 0.000, 0.252, 0.336, 0.420). (e and f) Stability test of the PSCs in air for 30 days. 
We carried out stability tests for the champion device in air (Fig. 5e and f). It is worth noting that the device retains 93% of its initial PCE after 30 days with barely changed FF and Voc. This slight degeneration of PCE is mainly attributable to the deterioration of Jsc, caused by the oxidation of Sn2+ in air and PbI2 formation from film degradation. In Fig. S9a and b,† we further measured the absorption and XRD spectra of a solar device based on the x = 0.336 perovskite after the device was in ambient air for 30 days. The absorption spectra of the device show nearly consistent photo-absorption. As shown in the results of XRD patterns, a weak PbI2 peak is observed for the aged device at 12.7° due to the film degradation. The long-term stability indicates that using the inverted structure based on tripe cation Pb–Sn-mixed perovskites is an effective approach to improve the stability of PSCs. Fig. S10† shows the statistics of different parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) of the PSCs. The statistical results demonstrate that the PSCs with x = 0.336 exhibit the highest performance and the results are highly reproducible.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we report the fabrication of inverted PSCs with a Pb–Sn mixed triple cation perovskite via a simple one-step method. The mixed Pb–Sn PSCs with 0.336 of Sn show the best bandgap alignment and the highest PCE of 16.10%. The bandgap engineering in mixed Pb–Sn-based PSCs is demonstrated as a feasible method to suppress the hysteresis. The inverted Sn-containing PSCs are stable since the champion device still retains 93% of its initial PCE in air for 30 days. We propose a potential possibility for the fabrication of Pb-free perovskite optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, photodetectors, light emitting diodes, etc.
4. Experimental section
Materials
FAI (99.99%), MABr (99.99%), PbI2 (99.999%), PbBr2 (99.99%), PEDOT:PSS, PC61BM, ITO (substrate, sheet resistance is 15 Ω sq−1) and chlorobenzene were purchased from YouXuan. CsI (99.9%), SnI2 (99.99%), dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Film preparation
The preparation of the precursor solution was performed according to our previous investigation on triple cation perovskites.1 The Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16PbI2.48Br0.52 precursor solution without SnI2 was prepared by dissolving FAI (1 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in 400 μl DMF and 100 μl DMSO. After being stirred for more than 3 h, 21 μl CsI (1.5 M) solution was added to this perovskite solution and the mixture was stirred for an hour before use. For precursor solution containing SnI2, we maintained the same concentration of other substances, merely changing the molar amount of PbI2 and SnI2. All of these preparations were done in a glove box.
Device fabrication
ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 15 min each. Then the cleaned ITO was treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 15 min before device fabrication. The PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was filtered by using a 0.45 μm filter before use, and then the PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated on the cleaned ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 40 s, and then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min under ambient conditions. The perovskite precursor solutions of Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb1−xSnxI2.48Br0.52 with different x values (0.000, 0.084, 0.168, 0.252, 0.336, 0.420 and 0.840) were deposited on the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then at 5000 rpm for 40 s in a glove box. 0.3 ml anti-solvent of chlorobenzene was added dropwise onto the spinning substrates at the last several seconds and then the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. Then, PC61BM solution (20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 90 nm thick Ag electrode was evaporated under high vacuum (<1 × 10−6 Torr).
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a Bede D1 system with Cu Kα radiation. SEM was performed by using a field emission fitting SEM (FEI-Inspect F50, Holland). The UV-vis absorption spectrum was measured by using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3101 PC). J–V curves were measured in air using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G solar irradiation. XPS was performed using a Kratos XSAM 800 X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer. The UPS spectra were measured using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD photoelectron spectrometer with an incident radiation of He I (21.2 eV). The dark capacitance curve was measured by using an Agilent 4294A under dark conditions using different DC applied biases with an AC frequency range of 10 Hz to 0.1 MHz. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the samples were measured using a Fluorolog-3 fluorescence spectrophotometer, and a 510 nm laser was employed as the excitation light, and a double-exponential decay model was used to fit the PL decay.
DFT calculations
DFT calculations were performed for Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb1−xSnxI2.48Br0.52 with the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)47 functional as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.4) code.48 The energy cutoff for the plan-wave basis was set to 300 eV. A 3 × 3 × 3 supercell was used to model the Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb1−xSnxI2.48Br0.52 compounds, and correspondingly, a Γ-only k-mesh was used to sample the Brillouin zone. To simplify the calculations, we replaced (Cs/MA/FA) with Fr, all of which contribute little to the band edges. For the configuration of I/Br anions, we examined many possible models and selected the one with the lowest total energy and a reasonable bandgap as the ground-state configuration for all the following calculations. For each x value, we examined eight configurations and found that the results showed a good convergence. All models were fully relaxed until the total force on every atom was smaller than 0.03 eV Å−1. For the electronic structure calculations, the SOC effect was also considered.
