    , Accepted 10th April 2022First published on 12th April 2022AbstractQuantum dot (QD) photodetectors with low cost, a tunable spectral response range, the great possibility of multiple-exciton generation, and excellent detective performance have shown significant advantages in the fields of optical communication, imaging, and biological monitoring. However, QD photodetectors are facing challenges such as materials toxicity, poor stability, material integration difficulty, etc. Thus, the performance of these photodetectors still lags far behind their traditional Si-based counterparts, which have been widely applied commercially. This review presents a general overview focusing on the material selection and device architecture design, specifically on the evaluation parameters of the photodetector, the strategies to improve the quality of the QD active layer, the matching degree of the transport layer, and the efficiency of the constructed devices. Moreover, based on an in-depth fundamental understanding of the quantum size effect of various QDs, visible-, near-infrared, and short-wavelength infrared QD photodetectors are deliberated. The application practices and current research progress of QD photodetectors are summarized at the end, followed by potential improvements to inspire the development of QD photodetectors in more industries.
1. Introduction
Photodetectors have been widely applied in various fields, including optical communication systems, imaging technology, biological sensing systems, smartphones, etc. The operating principle is converting captured optical signals (such as ultraviolet, visible, or infrared light) to electrical signals.1–4 Semiconductors are widely utilized as one of the ideal materials for photodetectors due to their capability of realizing the efficient conversion of an optical signal to an electrical signal. For example, single-crystalline silicon (Si),5–7 gallium nitride (GaN),8–10 conjugated polymers,11,12 and perovskite films1,13–15 have been deeply investigated and successfully applied in photodetectors. However, these materials still suffer from a high-cost problem due to the rigorous manufacturing processes and/or the concern of material instability.16 To address these issues, it is urgent to exploit substitutive materials to improve the stability of photodetectors and reduce the cost as well.
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs), with a size smaller than or close to their exciton Bohr radius,17 exhibit unique physical and chemical properties,18 such as a tunable bandgap, large absorption coefficient, and multiple exciton generation (MEG) mechanism.19–22 Notably, due to the MEG effects, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of QD-based devices can reach up to 100%. Benefitting from these advantages, QDs demonstrate great potential as one of the most promising candidates for photodetectors. Depending on the bandgap and the as-exhibited light absorption range, QD-based photodetectors can be roughly classified into three types. The first type is the ultraviolet (UV) photodetector, and some typical materials can be cited as ZnO QDs and ZnSe QDs (Fig. 1a). The visible (Vis) photodetector is the second type which is fabricated based on CdS QDs, CdSe QDs, or perovskite QDs (Fig. 1b). The active layer of the infrared photodetector is mainly composed of narrow bandgap QDs (e.g., PbS QDs and HgTe QDs), and this is classified as the third type of photodetector (Fig. 1c). The main criterion for QD classification is based on the fact that these QDs have intrinsically distinct bandgaps and thus exhibit different spectrum ranges. Furthermore, the structure design mode of the QD photodetector can also affect device performance or application fields (Fig. 1g–i). There are three primary types of photodetector structures summarized in Fig. 1d–f: photoconductors, phototransistors, and photodiodes. Besides, photomultiplication (PM) type organic photodetectors (OPDs) have recently been proved to have considerable potential to achieve excellent EQEs and a tunable spectral response range. The working mechanism of PM type OPDs is attributed to the interfacial trap-assisted hole tunneling injection from external circuits, which provides an important reference to further optimize the structure of QD photodetectors.23–26

Recently, photodetectors, especially PbS QDs photodetectors, have been developed successfully because of QD optimization and the well-designed device structure. In 2005, Mcdonald et al. fabricated PbS QD based photodetectors by the solution-processed method, achieving different absorption wavelengths of 955, 1200, and 1355 nm. They found that the ratio of photocurrent to dark current is only 630 and the maximum responsivity (R) of the photodetector is about 3.1 mA W−1 under controlled conditions (−5 V bias and 975 nm laser irradiation).27 This farsighted research not only contributes to the development of near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors but also sheds light on the application of optical communication systems and biological applications. Thereafter, the performance of the PbS QD photodetectors was gradually improved through various optimization methods such as ligand engineering (conductivity improvement), an innovative preparation process (inkjet printing), and fresh structural design. To sum up, the types of QDs and the structure of devices are key factors for constructing high-performance photodetectors. Meanwhile, it has been proved that some span-new methods also contribute to the entire photodetector system, such as developing ligand engineering to modify QDs, passivating agents to reduce trap states, constructing bilayer films to realize broadband response, integrating multiple devices to achieve energy conversion, and designing a brand-new transport layer.28–33
Motivated by the rapid development of QD-based photodetectors, this review presents an overview from the perspectives of QD selection and optimization, and photodetector structure design. It begins with careful discussions about the performance parameters of photodetectors, which can serve as the evaluation indicators in the QD selection for typical photodetectors. The second section highlights the operating principles and illustrates several conventional structures of photodetectors. Subsequently, bandgap profiles of QD based photodetectors and their variety in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions are summarized. Lastly, the potential applications and innovations of QD based photodetectors are presented, followed by the possible opportunities and challenges for further improvement in the future.
2. Basic parameters for quantifying the performance of QD based photodetectors
Different commercial applications have different requirements on the characteristics of photodetectors, so it is crucially important to clarify their evaluation metrics. Nowadays, there are many kinds of photodetectors, and the method of obtaining index parameters should be specified when evaluating and comparing the performance of photodetectors,37,38 such as whether the detectivity (D*) of the photodetector is calculated by dark current density or by noise equivalent power (NEP). Therefore, it is important to define the basic parameters of photodetectors for judging their suitable applications. Some conventional parameter metrics are briefly described and summarized below.
2.1 On–off ratio
The on–off ratio (α) is defined as the ratio of the photocurrent (or photocurrent density) to the dark current (or dark current density) at a certain voltage.1,38 It is depicted by the following equation: (1)where Ilight, Idark, Jlight, and Jdark are the photocurrent, dark current, photocurrent density and dark current density, respectively. Increasing the photocurrent is one of the effective methods to increase α. Guo et al. applied the surface ligand exchange method to replace the long-chain ligands with short-chain ligands at the surface of CuInSe2 QDs, thereby improving the electrical conductivity of QDs. With this treatment, α was increased from 188 to 417 at 0 V.28 Shen et al. improved α by adjusting the concentration ratio of CsBr/KBr to optimize the quality of CsPbBr3 QDs.39 Another effective way to increase α is reducing the dark current which is a significant factor for high-sensitivity photodetectors. Shen et al. effectively suppressed the dark current by ameliorating the device structure (adding an electron blocking layer) and dramatically improved the performance of CdSexTe1−x QD based photodectors.40
2.2 Response time (τ)
Response time, τ, is usually employed to characterize the reproducibility of the photocurrent and dark current and the sensitivity of the photodetector.41Fig. 2a and b show two different approaches to measure τ. In Fig. 2a, the rise time (τrise) or decay time (τdecay) is the duration of the transient current density increase from 10% to 90% of the maximal current density, or decrease from 90% to 10% of the maximal current density, respectively.18,24,29,33,40,42,43 The τ is closely related to the film quality, the roughness of the surface or interface and the trap states.32,44 Hence, a smaller τ indicates a more sensitive photodetector to the light signal. Besides, the transient photocurrent (TPC) is another important parameter to indicate the sensitivity of the photodetector as shown in Fig. 2b. The TPC curves are obtained by the single exponential fitting. The response time of the device decreases with increasing the working area, which means that the response time is determined by the resistance–capacitance constant (RC). To clarify further, for a certain resistance, the capacitance of the device determines the relationship between τ and the active area.

(d) Frequency response of perovskite photodetectors. Reprinted from ref. 2 with permission from Wiley. 
2.3 Responsivity (R) and external quantum efficiency (EQE)
Parameters R and EQE reflect the light-response limit of the photodetectors which indicates the light-absorption ability of the active layer. R is defined as the ratio of output photocurrent to the incident light power, while EQE refers to the number of electrons detected by the unit photon. These two parameters mainly depend on the device architectures and recombination rates of charge carriers.1,15,45 The relationship between R and EQE can be expressed by formula (2):2,46 (2)where Llight is the incident light power, e is the elementary charge, c is the light speed, ħ is the Planck constant, and λ is the wavelength of incident light. Fig. 2c shows absorption/responsivity profiles of QDs with different bandgaps as a function of the wavelength. The absorption peak of CH3NH3PbCl3 QDs, CsPbI3 QDs, and PbS QDs are approximately at 425 nm, 700 nm, and 1000 nm, respectively. Obviously, the R of the photodetector is consistent with the absorption of QDs.
2.4 Noise equivalent power (NEP) and detectivity (D*)
The parameter NEP expresses the incident power required to produce a unit signal-to-noise ratio within a bandwidth of 1 Hz.38 It indicates the lowest light intensity that cannot be distinguished from the noise current. In 2015, Huang et al. directly measured the NEP by using a green light LED with an emission peak of 560 nm and the measured value is in good agreement with the calculation results.15 NEP can be obtained by the following formula: (3) (4)where inoise, ishot, ithermal, i1/f, and ig–r, are the total noise current, shot noise current, thermal noise current, flicker noise current, and generation–recombination noise current, respectively.46

D* is another important parameter to evaluate the performance of a photodetector; it is the weakest light that can be detected by the photodetector.47 Generally, the D* of a photodetector is obtained in two ways. It can be calculated from NEP and the square root of the active area and electrical bandwidth (shown in formula (5)),37,48 or by dark current density (formula (6)) when the noise current is independent of the frequency and the resistance is only related to the shot noise current.1 (5) (6)where A is the active area of the device, B is the bandwidth, and q is the electronic charge. It is worth noting that formula (5) and formula (6) are appliable to different prior conditions.38,48 Blind use of dark current density to evaluate the D* of the photodetector likely leads to overestimation of the results.
2.5 Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and linear dynamic range (LDR)
Another two important parameters SNR and LDR reflect the quality of photodetectors, and the expressions are below. (7) (8)
SNR provides signal information for background noise.43 Therefore, it can be clearly distinguished from the noise current value.38 Larger SNR indicates less prominent disturbances from background noise, and a higher sensitivity of the device.32 LDR can be used to represent the range of incident light intensity that the device can detect, which can be defined in decibel (dB) as linear responsivity.38,48–50 Higher LDR indicates that the photodetector can detect the light intensity in a wider range.
2.6 3 dB cut-off frequency (f−3dB)
The last important parameter is the 3 dB cut-off frequency (f−3dB), which characterizes how photodetectors respond to the modulated light of different frequencies. The modulation bandwidth is defined as the frequency at the value of −3 dB, and it depends on the carrier lifetime and RC circuit time.15,37,38 In general, one can obtain a larger f−3dB by reducing the active area, which means that signals can be received and transmitted when the modulation bandwidth is below f−3dB. The response bandwidth curve is illustrated in Fig. 2d.2,15,51 Importantly, the frequency response of the noise current needs to be fully considered, which is crucial for obtaining a reliable D*.37
Various types of QD based photodetectors have been well-developed and widely applied in several fields. However, we still need to focus on the standardization of these devices in terms of evaluation parameters. Table 1 summarizes the key parameters and definitions of photodetectors.

3. Device architectures and operation mechanisms
Based on the device structure, QD based photodetectors can be typically divided into three categories, which are photoconductors, phototransistors, and photodiodes (Fig. 3). The photoconductor works via modulating the semiconductor resistance or conductivity under light irradiation (Fig. 3a).54 The basic index for evaluating the performance of photoconductors is Gain (G), which can be defined as the ratio of the lifetime to the drift time of the carriers’ transport between two electrodes. Noting that the G value of the photodetector is closely related to the light absorption of active materials, the distance between the electrodes, carrier mobility, and additional bias voltage. Among them, modifying the additional bias voltage is an effective way to achieve a higher R and G, though it may lead to suppressed dark current.

(d) Schottky-type photodetector and its vertical heterojunction photodiode evolved by adding (e and f) a transport layer or (f) a blocking layer. 
Phototransistors generally include two types of structures, which are the bottom-gate structure and the top-gate structure (Fig. 3b and c). Under light illumination and source-and-drain voltage, electrons and holes flow to the electrodes to form photocurrent. Compared to photoconductors, phototransistors have three electrical contacts. In this case, not only adjusting the source-and-drain voltage and light irradiation intensity but also changing the gate voltage can improve the performance of the phototransistor.
The multifarious structures of the photodiode are shown in Fig. 3d–g. The working principle of photodiodes with different structures is similar, all of them work based on constructing a built-in electric field to effectively separate and collect carriers.54 The Schottky-type structure (Fig. 3d) of photodiodes is the simplest. The band energy difference between semiconductors and metals is the driving force, beneficial for carrier migration. Moreover, photodiodes with vertical structures have also been developed. For example, heterojunction structure-based photodiodes are designed by introducing a hole transport layer (HTL) or an electron transport layer (ETL), as shown in Fig. 3e. The device with a p–n structure or p–i–n structure (Fig. 3f and g) operates through the built-in electric field which helps separate electrons and holes to generate photocurrent. Obviously, photocurrent is a critical parameter in terms of device performance. A high photocurrent usually indicates that carriers in the device can be separated effectively and promptly. Besides, one important advantage of photodiodes is that the bias voltage is unnecessary as most devices can obtain a stable current at 0 V, suggesting that this type of photodetector is self-powered. More information about photodiode-type photodetectors will be elaborated below.
3.1 Schottky-type and heterojunction-type photodiode
The operation fundamentals of the Schottky-type photodiode are schematically illustrated in Fig. 4a. Generally, when bias voltages of different strengths are applied to the photodetector, more prominent conductivity and G can be obtained. However, the biggest limitation of the widespread use of photodetectors is the slow response speed.55,56 In 2006, Konstantatos et al. developed a solution-processed method to prepare a Schottky-type infrared photodetector, which exhibits a large photoconductive G (Fig. 4b). The R reached 103 A W−1, which is better than those prepared by the epitaxial growth method.56 Therefore, the solution-processed method was regarded as a promising way to prepare various low-cost electronic devices. In 2009, Clifford et al. used ligand engineering to passivate the surface of QDs and designed a high-performance PbS QD-based photodetector with Schottky configuration.57 They found that the temporal response, one of the performance parameters, was affected by two processes: one is electron drift (fast process), and the other is electron diffusion (slow process). This group designed a Schottky-type photodetector with all depletion regions being involved in improving device sensitivity to reduce the response time. Fig. 4c illustrated electrons generated in the quasi-neutral region transferring to the depletion region. Their excellent work helps researchers to deeply understand the dynamic kinetics of carriers in the Schottky-type photodetectors and provides a reference for designing highly sensitive photodetectors.

Reprinted from ref. 43 with permission from Wiley. 
Photodetectors with heterojunction structures (Fig. 4d) have also received great attention in recent years. In 2015, Kim et al. found a heterojunction between QDs and TiO2 with also a gradient arrangement between QDs of different sizes, which means it was easier for carriers to overcome the barrier between the conduction band of small sized QDs and the metal. In this case, they creatively fabricated a heterojunction-type photodetector with multi-sized PbS QDs using a centrifugal colloidal casting method (Fig. 4e), and obtained a stable quantum-gradient photodiode with a detectivity of 2.4 × 1013 Jones.58 This method was applied to assist multiple-sized QDs to form a film vertically and has proved to effectively reduce the noise current and guide the preparation of large-scale QD-based photoelectric devices. Since then, heterojunction photodetectors have been extensively studied and presented excellent performance. For example, in 2017, Zheng et al. constructed a flexible heterojunction photodetector using perovskite QDs (MAPbI3 QDs) and TiO2 nanotubes by electrospinning and solution-processed methods.59 This photodetector exhibited outstanding flexibility, which contributes to maintaining considerable detectivity (∼1012 Jones) after repeated 200 cycles of bending. In 2017, Ren et al. prepared a heterojunction photodetector composed of bilayer PbS QDs, which were modified with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) ligands or tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) ligands (Fig. 4f).43 Their photodetector presented a better response speed and signal-to-noise ratio than PbS QD-based Schottky-type devices and exhibited an excellent weak light response and sensitivity.
3.2 Multilayer vertical photodiode
The working principle of multilayer vertical photodiodes (p–n photodiode and p–i–n photodiode) is that free electron–hole pairs are generated under light excitation and then separated and transferred to ETL and HTL, which convert the optical signals to electrical signals (Fig. 5a). In 2005, Oertel et al. designed a CdSe QD photodetector with a sandwich structure to build an electrochemical cell.60 By treating the films with n-butylamine, the exciton separation and charge transport capability were improved. The ratio of photocurrent to dark current was greater than 103 at 0 V, while the EQE was only 0.13% without bias, though the emergence of CdSe QD photodetectors laid the foundation for the development of QD based photodetectors.60,61 In 2009, Tobias and collaborators successfully prepared a vertical PbS QD-based photodetector and used it for near-infrared image display, as shown in Fig. 5b and c.62 Specifically, the PbS QDs were incorporated into the PCBM and P3HT blend layer by employing ambipolar transmission, and they found that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) energy level of PCBM matched well with PbS QDs, and P3HT had the function of hole transport, the carriers were more effectively separated to the top and bottom electrodes. The specific detectivity of this photodetector reached 2.3 × 109 Jones at the frequency of 170 Hz, and the responsivity was more than 0.5 A W−1. Subsequently, it has been proved that the structural design of the double-layered OPDs is beneficial to enhance the EQE of the photodetector.24,63 The active layer and MP layer can effectively control the response range and EQE of the photodetector.63 In 2015, Lee et al. applied the 1,1-bis[(di-4-tolylamino) phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC) as a hole transport layer to increase the D* (7 × 1013 Jones) and EQE (18700% at −13 V) of the PbS QD based photodetector,64 which was entirely comparable to commercial InGaAs photodiodes, as shown in Fig. 5d and e.65 The G mechanism of this high-performance device came from forming an electronic barrier at the TAPC interface under reverse bias, which caused the tunneling effect of electrons. Except for various QDs, vertical photodiode-based detectors were also investigated in their preparation methods. In 2019, the Sargent group used an inkjet printing (Fig. 5f) method to prepare a NIR photodetector (Fig. 5g).66 The preparation of each layer in photodetectors was strict, aiming at effectively separating electron–hole pairs and preventing the malignant carrier's recombination. Considering the viscosity, tension, and nozzle clogging, they chose the best solvent of n-butylamine (BTA): N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to optimize photodetectors and obtained a D* higher than 1012 Jones in the near-infrared region, which is the highest D* reported to date by this technology. This preparative technique provides routes for large-scale production and integration of sensors. In 2020, Zhou et al. modified the ETL (ZnO) with Ag nanoparticles to prepare a high-performance up-conversion photodetector by solution processing. Both the PbS QDs layer and CdSe/ZnS QDs layer were used together as absorption layers to absorb near-infrared and visible light.30 The schematic diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 5h. There was a large barrier between the ITO layer and ZnO layer in a dark environment, but photogenerated electrons could be captured by Ag nanoparticles (existing in the ZnO layer) under light irradiation, which increased the bending of the energy band and reduced the charge transport barrier, thus accumulating current (Fig. 5i). The optimized device presented a high D* of 6 × 1012 Jones. In brief, various advancements in photodetectors have been achieved by developing device configurations, preparation methods, and wide applications, which paves the way for obtaining high-performance devices and commercial applications. Table 2 summarizes the benefits and drawbacks of photodetectors with different configurations.

4. Photodetectors with QDs in different absorption ranges
It has been known that when the energy given by the excitation photons is larger than the bandgap of semiconductors, electron–hole pairs can be generated and then separated to convert optical signals to electrical signals.1 For instance, when the bandgap of QDs is smaller than 3.1 eV, they can only absorb light within 400 nm and can only detect the optical signals in the ultraviolet (UV) region. According to the definition of the response spectrum, photodetectors can be classified into UV photodetectors (wavelength <400 nm), visible (Vis) photodetectors (wavelength 400–780 nm), and near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors (780–3000 nm). Moreover, there are narrowband detectors (only detect specific light sources), mid-and far-infrared detectors (>3000 nm), imaging photodetectors, and thermal photodetectors. Table 3 summarizes the performance parameters of QD photodetectors with a broad response range from the ultraviolet region to the near-infrared region.

4.1 UV QD-based photodetectors
UV light corresponds to the high-energy region of the X-ray spectrum to the edge of the visible region (10–400 nm). The UV radiation (320–400 nm), emitted from the sun is incident on the Earth's surface, damaging human skin and even inducing cancer.67 Moreover, compared with visible and infrared light, the transmission of UV signals avoids the interference of the surroundings, and therefore UV photodetectors are broadly employed in missile early warning tracking, fire alarms, and cancer cell detection.67,68
ZnO, with a direct bandgap of ∼3.3 eV and is easily synthesized, has been one of the promising materials for UV photodetectors. ZnO-photodetectors were initially investigated in the early 20th century, followed by various research studies about releasing the issue that the Schottky structure ZnO-photodetector lacked low-cost manufacturing methods and considerable device performance.68,69 In 2010, Yang et al. fabricated a ZnO-based photodetector by combining polymer-ZnO QDs with graphene. The device exhibited an outstanding α at ∼108.70 Utilizing the excellent stability, flexibility, and high carrier transport of graphene,71,72 Shao and collaborators prepared ZnO QD/graphene based UV photodetectors and achieved a high R of 247 A W−1 at 325 nm and sensitive response speed (τrise of 14 ms, τdecay of 11 ms).73 In 2013, Guo et al. revealed that the largest contributor to effective charge transport is oxygen molecules in ZnO QDs/graphene photodetectors.74 ZnO QDs are confirmed to have a large specific surface area, so a large number of hole defects are produced, and the oxygen molecules attach to the surface of QDs when exposed to air. Both of them favor the capture of free electrons. When the energy of the photon is sufficiently high, the holes can be captured by the surface state, and then the adsorbed oxygen ions will be released, and the unpaired electrons will be transferred to the graphene layer. When the light source disappears, the oxygen molecules will re-absorb on the surface of QDs and restore the transport of graphene. The auxiliary charge transfer mechanism of oxygen molecules can greatly improve the G of the conductive photodetectors. Similarly, Shao et al. prepared ultrasensitive heterojunction photodetectors using ZnO QDs, and obtained a maximum R of 108 A W−1 in the UV region, which is comparable to that of Si-avalanche photodiodes (APDs), GaN photodetectors, and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), as shown in Fig. 6a.75 Gong et al. pointed out that if the Zn (AC) shell at the surface of the ZnO core could be removed completely, it would be more effective for ZnO QDs/graphene to form the van der Waals interface and dissociate excitons as well (Fig. 6b). They achieved an outstanding D* of 7.5 × 1014 Jones and a photoconductive G of 3.6 × 109.34 Furthermore, Li et al. assembled ZnO QDs and Zn2SnO4 nanowires into a heterojunction photodetector and used it for UV image sensing, which is shown in Fig. 6c.76 Notably, ZnO QD based devices are the main UV-photodetectors nowadays,34,76,77 but other wide-bandgap QD- (such as ZnS QDs,78,79 CdS QDs80 and graphene QDs81) based photodetectors are also being rapidly developed and widely applied in the UV region.

4.2 Vis QD-based photodetector
The Vis region (400–780 nm) of light is generally defined as the range that human eyes can perceive. Cd-chalcogenide (e.g., CdS, CdSe and CdTe) QDs and perovskite (e.g., MAPbX3, or CsPbX3, X = I, Cl, Br) QDs with a high light absorption coefficient and tunable light absorption range in the Vis region have been considered as promising QDs for Vis photodetectors.
For example, by tuning the particle size of CdSe QDs, the optical response can be achieved in the range of 400–600 nm.82,83 In 1996, Greenham et al. made the first attempt to introduce CdSe nanocrystals into photoconductors and simulated the charge transfer process by adjusting the electrical conductivity of the device, which paves the way for CdSe QD photodetectors.61 The following studies were focused on improving the quality of CdSe QDs by constructing a core–shell structure or ligand engineering. With these high-quality QDs, high-performance photodetectors were obtained. In 2019, Kim et al. developed a full-color photodetector with ultra-stable Sn2S64− chalcometallate ligand capped CdSe QDs (5–7 nm diameter) in the Vis region (Fig. 6d).84 Compared with SCN-ligands, Sn2S64− ligands contributed to reducing sulfur vacancies, thus reducing the charge trapping states at the surface of QDs. Integrating the Sn2S64− capped multi-sized QDs with amorphous indium–gallium–zinc-oxide (a-IGZO), the photodetectors achieved R of 8.3 × 103 A W−1 and D* of 4.2 × 1017 Jones. Perovskite QDs are another promising material for Vis photodetectors.59,85 Perovskite QDs, with a basic frame of ABX3 (A = CH3NH3 (MA), Cs; B = Pb, Bi, Sn; X = I, Br, Cl), can achieve absorption and PL emission in almost the entire Vis region by changing the composition of halide or tuning the size of QDs, as shown in Fig. 6e.86,87 In addition, perovskite QDs also show an outstanding PL quantum yield and high color purity.87–89 In 2017, Chen et al. prepared a high-quality phototransistor based on CsPbBr3 QDs and organic semiconductor (dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophen (DNTT)) for the first time. The optimized photodetector has an impressive D* of 2.0 × 1014 Jones and an excellent EQE of 67000%.90 In 2018, Wu and collaborators integrated CsPbI3−xBrx QDs into monolayer MoS2 to fabricate phototransistors.85 The authors show that the 0D–2D mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) are beneficial for interfacial photocarrier separation and efficient carrier injection into the MoS2 layer. Compared to no G electric field, the Schottky barrier increases when the G electric field is negative, and the photocurrent mainly contributes to the channel current. When the G voltage is large enough, the channel current increases significantly due to the increased thermionic current and tunneling current. Therefore, due to the synergy between the photogate mechanism and the Schottky barrier, the R, D* and EQE of the optimized phototransistor reach 7.7 × 104 A W−1, 5.6 × 1011 Jones, and 107%, respectively. Besides, Shen et al. applied CsBr/KBr to synthesize CsPbBr3 QDs.39 Br−, providing a Br-rich environment, was beneficial for reducing Br vacancies during the QDs synthesis process; and K+, with a smaller radius, could occupy the interstitial sites of the lattice to further compensate for halide vacancies and Cs vacancies. In this case, both the nonradiative recombination and halide migration could be largely suppressed, thus obtaining high-performance QDs and photodetectors. The optimized device exhibited a high open-circuit voltage (1.3 V), R (10.1 A W−1), and D* (9.4 × 1013 Jones) (Fig. 6f). To date, researchers have made efforts to improve the performance and the stability of photodetectors in the Vis region through selecting light-sensitive QDs, modifying device structures, and optimizing transport layers.
4.3 Near-infrared (NIR) QD-based photodetector
The infrared photodetector is widely taken as a key component in infrared night vision detection, reconnaissance, optical communication, and imaging.91,92 Considering the bandgap limitation of materials with response spectra in the Vis region, other materials that could absorb lights in the NIR region, were very important for fabricating NIR photodetectors. PbS QDs, which have a broadly tunable bandgap and large exciton Bohr radius (∼18 nm), are deeply studied and widely applied to prepare NIR photodetectors.54 The Sargent group has conducted in-depth research on the physical and chemical properties of PbS QDs and developed a variety of ligands capped PbS QDs.36,93,94 This research ensured the subsequent fabrication of high-performance solar cells or photodetectors. They tuned the photo-response range based on the size effect of QDs and investigated the position of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of PbS QDs capped by different ligands (Fig. 6g),95 which was conducive to choosing a suitable energy band structure to realize a diode photodetector.
Researchers have prepared NIR QD-based photodetectors with different configurations.54,96 For example, a PbS QD-based heterojunction photodetector with D* more than 1012 Jones was obtained 10 years ago.27,55–57 In 2012, Pal et al. prepared two types of photodetectors, using PbS QDs as the photoactive layer and oxide (ZnO or TiO2) as the charge transport layer.50 The architectures of the photodetectors are ITO/HTL/QDs/ETL/Al and ITO/ETL/QDs/Au, respectively. Compared with single transport layer devices, a double transport layer-detector can effectively reduce the dark current and noise current, which is beneficial to improving D* (>1012 Jones). In 2014, Manders et al. prepared a photovoltaic detector that exhibited a low Jdark of 20 nA cm−2 and high specific D* of 1.2 × 1012 Jones, which is comparable to the performance of commercial Si and InGaAs photodetector counterparts. Besides, the displayed LDR and bandwidth also indicated that the device had imaging capabilities.97 PbS QD-based NIR photodetectors have been obtained with fascinating properties,98 other NIR QDs, such as PbSe,99,100 HgTe,101–103 CdSexTe1−x29,40 and toxic-free CuInSe2 QDs28,33 have also been applied and studied on the NIR photodetectors. Tian's group investigated CdSexTe1−x QD photodetectors for the first time (Fig. 6h).29 They converted an oleic acid (OA) ligand to an iodine-based ligand (TBAI) using an in situ ligand exchange method, thus passivating the surface trap of CdSexTe1−x QDs and increasing the loading capacity of QDs. The optimized photodetector showed a broadband response covering the UV-vis, Vis, and NIR region (300–800 nm), remarkably high R (53 mA W−1) and D* (>1013 Jones). In addition, Tian's group also developed toxic-free CuInSe2 QD-based NIR photodetectors.28 The mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) ligand encapsulated CuInSe2 QD-based photodetectors present a broadband response region (300–1100 nm), promising D* (7.5 × 1010 Jones) at 1000 nm and fast response speed (<0.02 s). Subsequently, the author improved the crystal quality and reduced the trap states of CuInSe2 QDs by doping Mn2+ into CuInSe2 QDs (Mn-CuInSe2 QDs) (Fig. 6i).104 The corresponding photodetector gave a broadband response (300–1100 nm) and fast response speed (0.76 μs). In addition, the R in the NIR was increased to 30 mA W−1, and the D* was improved to 4.2 × 1012 Jones. Although its performance is not as good as that of Pb-based QD photodetectors, it still opens a window for the development of eco-friendly photodetectors. Table 3 and Fig. 7 summarize the D* and R of QD photodetectors in detail. In future studies, more attention should be paid to optimizing both QD quality and device structures.

4.4 Photodetectors based on the synergy of multiple QDs
In recent years, lead halide perovskite films have been fully developed in the fields of solar cells119–122 and photodetectors.1,3,4,15,42,47 Perovskite-based photodetectors have superior advantages in the Vis region. Some researchers41,123,124 combined NIR QDs with perovskite materials to prepare high-performance photodetectors with a broadband response. The perovskite active layer provides a light response in the Vis region, while the QD layer provides a light response in the NIR. Zhang et al. used SCN- to passivate the surface of PbS QDs and combined it with the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) layer to fabricate a broadband photodetector from UV to the NIR (365–1550 nm) region (Fig. 8b).41Fig. 8a shows the structure schematic of the composite device, in which the PbS QDs are applied as NIR absorption materials. Due to the complementary light absorption, the composite photodetector exhibited an excellent R of 255 A W−1 at 365 nm and 1.58 A W−1 at 960 nm, with corresponding D* of 4.9 × 1013 Jones and 3.0 × 1011 Jones, respectively (Fig. 8c). In addition, the device also gave a fast response speed of 42 ms. Similarly, Zhu et al. combined PbSe QDs with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) to build a flexible broadband photodetector, as shown in Fig. 8d.123 PbSe QDs, the introduced near-infrared absorption source, could extend the light response range to 2600 nm, as shown in Fig. 8e. The photocurrent increase of photodetectors in the visible and infrared regions was due to the trap-assisted photomultiplication effect. The D* of the optimized photodetector was 4.48 × 1012 Jones, 1.22 × 1012 Jones, and 2.93 × 1012 Jones at 500 nm, 1300 nm and 2400 nm, respectively (Fig. 8f). In 2018, Guo et al. mixed the p-type CuInSe2 QDs with the PEDOT:PSS to prepare a perovskite photodetector.33 The research found that the perovskite film became denser when mixing HTL in the basement. The CuInSe2 QDs acted as the nucleation sites to stimulate the longitudinal growth of the perovskite film, according to the results of surface SEM and cross-sectional SEM.33 Subsequently, Guo et al. adopted eco-friendly toxic-free CuInSe2 QDs as an NIR absorbing material and combined them with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3) to achieve a broadband response (Fig. 8g–h).124 They concluded that CuInSe2 QDs acted as a NIR source and blocked the migration of free electrons to the HTL as well. Their optimized double active layer photodetectors gave a broadband response from 300 nm to 1100 nm, and the R in the NIR exceeded 20 mA W−1. The specific D* of the photodetector was >7.0 × 1012 Jones in the Vis region and 7.7 × 1011 Jones in the NIR region, as shown in Fig. 8i. In addition, these photodetectors presented good stability, which was attributed to the fact that the existence of the CuInSe2 QDs layer assisted to grow a denser and more hydrophobic perovskite layer.

The studies mentioned above all use QDs as auxiliary sources to fabricate high-performance photodetectors. This mainly depends on the broadband response of the narrow bandgap QDs. Combining two kinds of material, drawing on the merits of one to offset the weakness of the other, on the one hand, brings an opportunity for photodetectors to perform better while bringing challenges during development as well.
5. Applications
Currently, the research focus of QD-based photodetectors is both on obtaining excellent performance and on incorporating them into other devices for application in various fields. In this chapter, we will elaborate on it from the perspectives of flexible photodetectors, toxic-free QDs photodetectors, QDs ancillary engineering, and commercial applications.
5.1 QD-based flexible photodetectors
Flexible electronic devices are more accessibly integrated with other accessories than rigid devices due to their flexibility, portability, pressure resistance, and enormous potential for applications in biological signals, intelligent windows, and wearable devices.125,126 Therefore, the fabrication of high-performance flexible devices is vital for subsequent commercial applications.
Mitra et al. synthesized carbon-doped ZnO QDs by femtosecond-laser ablation in a liquid (FLAL) method and prepared flexible photodetectors in the deep-UV region (Fig. 9a).127 The QDs obtained by this method did not suffer from any degradation caused by humidity conditions or other external factors. The flexible photodetectors showed a stable responsivity after 150 cycles of bending, suggesting that the device had good flexibility and light stability. In 2013, Zheng et al. prepared flexible photodetectors with perovskite QDs and single-walled carbon nanotubes.128 Due to the outstanding mechanical activity and stretchability of the reticulate substrate, the authors assembled it on medical tape before attaching it to leaves to detect sunlight intensity, as shown in Fig. 9b. The photocurrent reflected by the flexible detector increases as the intensity of the sunlight shining on the leaves increases. This phenomenon indicates the potential outdoor application of the photoelectric detection system. Shen et al. synthesized high crystallinity CsPbBr3 QDs with the addition of CsBr/KBr, which exhibited a low defect density and were applied in flexible detectors (Fig. 9c).39 Due to the low defect density and excellent crystallinity of the processed CsPbBr3 QDs, the corresponding devices exhibited an excellent R (10.1 A W−1), a specific D* (9.35 × 1013 Jones), and an outstanding open-circuit voltage (1.3 V). These performance parameters are comparable to those of perovskite QD-based rigid photodetectors. NIR QD-based flexible detectors have also received significant attention and fast development. The flexible PbS QD-based photodetectors prepared by Wei et al. presented ultra-sensitivity under different light intensities at 40 V (Fig. 9d).32 The values of R, D* and SNR of these flexible devices are almost at the same level as their rigid device counterparts. In addition, the bilayer flexible photodetectors also possess excellent fatigue resistance properties (500 times with a bending angle of 60°). In 2019, Shen et al. prepared a CdSexTe1−x QD-based flexible photodetector with a double HTL (PEDOT:PSS and P-TPD) (Fig. 9e).40 The device achieved excellent D* (>1012 Jones) and a suppressed Jdark (∼106 mA cm−2), suggesting that the double HTL could effectively improve carrier separation and prevent electrons from diffusing to the hole layer. At the same time, flexible photodetectors also exhibited good response and fatigue resistance under weak illumination, as shown in Fig. 8f. Due to the excellent properties of portability, flexibility and integration, flexible devices show great potential to replace conventional rigid photodetectors. Thus, preparing low-cost, foldable, and high-performance flexible photodetectors is of great significance.

5.2 Imaging and biological monitoring
The photodetector is a core component for image display by switching between optical and electrical signals. UV-Vis imaging can be used in crime investigation, fire monitoring, and information recognition, while infrared imaging can be used in the fields of biological health monitoring, thermal imaging, and autonomous driving assistants. In 2017, Li et al. integrated a flexible UV photodetector based on ZnO QDs in a 10 × 10 array to perceive the display imaging of letters in a bent state (Fig. 10a).76 The probe on the top of the device collected the test data and recorded the denary logarithm of the photo-dark current ratio. They found that when the letter “E” blocked the optical signal, the device displayed a lower value while the remaining areas referred to high values, indicating that the image of the letter could be clearly displayed. Similarly, Zhang et al. also prepared a photodetector array for sensing UV to NIR images (Fig. 10b).41 First, the mask between the light source and the photodetector transmitted or blocked the light signal; then, the light spot moved between the pixels by moving the target template, and the signal was detected by the photodetector. They found that when the light was directly passed through the designed letter mask, the reflected current was relatively larger than that in the covered area. Under 520 nm light illumination, the letter “E” could be clearly identified. In 2019, Kim et al. reported a skin-like two-dimensionally pixelized full-color photodetector integrated with QDs of various-size and amorphous indium–gallium–zinc-oxide (shown in Fig. 10c).84 Through the chalcometallate ligand processing, the device gave an ultra-high detectivity of 4.2 × 1017 Jones and responsivity of 8.3 × 103 A W−1 over a broad range from 365 nm to 1310 nm. Choosing 3 nm, 5 nm, and 7 nm CdSe QDs and 10 nm PbS QDs as the blue, green, red and NIR light sources, the author used this photodetector array to measure the absorption of different light by finger capillaries since the finger transmission ability by light depends on the absorptivity of deoxy- and oxy-hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The results indicated that the light absorption data measured by the photodetector could effectively analyze and monitor the health of a human body. In 2018, the Guyot-Sionnest group prepared HgTe QD-based photovoltaic detectors, which offset the limitations in the sensitivity of photoconductive HgTe QDs devices.101 They applied a solid-state cation exchange method to chemically modify the interface. The detectivity was improved to 109 Jones at the wavelength of 5 μm, which is comparable with commercial photodetectors. Subsequently, the author fabricated a single-pixel interference-enhanced HgTe QD-based photodetector for scanning imaging (Fig. 10d). They realized that the area covered by the glasses and metal rods was dark due to the blockage of the heat radiation from the human body. This photodetector was expected to be used in military defense. Thereafter, the Guyot-Sionnest team manufactured two-terminal QD dual-band photodetectors, which could switch the spectral response in two distinct bands.129 By adjusting the bias polarity and the bias amplitude, the photodetector could achieve a modulation frequency up to 100 kHz and a detectivity over 1010 Jones. Besides, the photodetector also realized dual-band infrared imaging and remote temperature monitoring. In 2020, the upconversion photodetector fabricated by Zhou et al. was used for image display and biological monitoring.30 The equipment integration is shown in Fig. 10e. Specifically, the author placed a mask in front of the detector and irradiated the mask with 980 nm infrared light, finding that the image could be easily recognized (Fig. 10f). Fig. 10g is a tissue section picture from a mouse breast cancer cell sample irradiated with 940 nm infrared light. The dark area in the picture has a higher cell density, resulting in weak visible emission.

6. Conclusions and outlook
Quantum dots are recognized as potential active materials for photodetectors due to their multiple advantages, such as a tunable bandgap, large absorption coefficient, strong surface modification tolerance, and low-cost solution-processable preparation. In this work, the research progress of QD photodetectors has been reviewed from the perspectives of basic parameters, device architectures, and working principles. Profound discussions are presented regarding QD-based photodetectors with spectra absorption in the UV, Vis, and NIR regions, and their applications in imaging and biological monitoring. In addition, this review provides comprehensive insight into the design and in-depth utilization of innovative photodetectors in various areas.
Although the performance of QD-based photodetectors has been dramatically improved through methods of ligand engineering, adding barrier layers, and ameliorating device structure, their commercial application is still hindered by some drawbacks. We propose the following suggestions to further improve and develop QD photodetectors:
(1) Further optimize the performance of QD photodetectors. Photodetectors with high performance require excellent responsivity, detectivity, sensitivity and stability, and researchers could make an effort toward the regulation of QD active layers, device structure design and preparation process optimization.
(2) Improve device stability. For example, perovskite QDs have great advantages in photoelectric conversion efficiency, but their stability becomes a limitation when integrating with photodetectors. A surface engineering strategy or inserting some passivation layers would be effective solutions to improve the stability of QD photodetectors.
(3) Develop eco-friendly QD photodetectors. Although Pb-based and Hg-based QD photodetectors have been well developed, their toxicity impedes their further application. Therefore, it is important to develop nontoxic QDs and enable the development of nontoxic QDs photodetectors.
(4) Realize multi-functional applications. On the basis of realizing the excellent performance of the QD photodetectors, expanding the diversified application fields of QD photodetectors is an important link to continuously promote the development of QD photodetectors.
In summary, we hope that this review can deepen the understanding of the basic physical and chemical mechanisms of QDs and photodetectors, so as to promote the research and development of QD-based photoelectronic devices in various industries.
