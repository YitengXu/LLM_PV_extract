    , Accepted 21st April 2019First published on 2nd May 2019AbstractWe report two efficient donor materials for organic solar cells, namely Si-BDP and Ge-BDP, composed by the novel union of thienyl Bodipy wings and a dithienosilole/dithienogermole core. These new donor molecules exhibited excellent solubility in organic solvents, extended π-conjugation and low-lying energy levels that matched with fullerene acceptors, supporting their application as donors in OSCs. Under optimized conditions and using PC70BM as an acceptor, desirable PCEs of 4.58% and 4.12% were observed for Si-BDP and Ge-BDP, respectively.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn substantial attention as competent candidates to solve the increasing energy crisis. OSCs possess several merits such as light weight, flexibility, copious availability, uncomplicated fabrication, and a low-cost manufacturing process.1–4
Regarding the donor materials for OSCs, extensive research has centered on polymeric donors. Though polymers represent the most important class of donor-type semiconducting materials, there exist several disadvantages, such as low batch-to-batch reproducibility, polydispersity, difficult synthetic protocols and purification methods. These obstacles lead to multiple processing and performance limitations. In contrast, small molecules (SMs) possess a specific molecular weight, distinct molecular structure and high purity without batch-to-batch variation. Absorption profiles and orbital energy levels of SMs can be fine-tuned with suitable structural modifications so as to match the device characteristics to a specific given acceptor, which is highly difficult in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Moreover, the reproducible fabrication protocols of SM-based OSCs provide a better understanding of molecular structure–property relationships and facile commercialization.5,6 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 10% have been achieved by various solution-processed SMs,7–9 matching those of polymer-based OSCs.10–13
Various SM donor materials that have been reported for bulkheterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have accommodated a conjugated thiophene backbone,14 dithienosilole (DTS),15,16 dithienogermole (DTG),17 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),18 and porphyrin systems.19,20
The unique properties of borondipyrromethene (Bodipy) dyes, such as facile synthesis, strong absorption in the UV-Vis region with high absorption coefficients, excellent photochemical and thermal stability, and appropriate energy levels, make them potent candidates for OSCs. In recent years, several research groups including our group have directed efforts in exploring Bodipy dyes as competent materials for systems of OSCs and DSSCs.21–29 Recently, our group reported a record PCE of 7.2% for a Bodipy-based donor for solution-processed SM-OSCs.30 Despite these achievements, it is still necessary to investigate novel and justified structural modifications on a Bodipy core in pursuit of efficient donor materials.
In this manuscript, we present two donor molecules comprising two Bodipy units that are symmetrically conjugated to electron-rich DTS/DTG units (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of Si-BDP, Ge-BDP. 
The 3,5 symmetrically substituted thienyl Bodipy units are linked through their meso-positions to 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-germolo-[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene scaffolds to give Si-BDP and Ge-BDP, respectively. The aliphatic side chains (i.e., 2-ethylhexyl) in these molecules play an important role in improving the morphology, which further boosts the photovoltaic performance of the device.31
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route to obtain the target materials i.e., Si-BDP and Ge-BDP, is presented in Scheme 1. The compound 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (1b) was synthesized according to reported procedures.32,33 The compound meso-bromo thienyl Bodipy (2a) was prepared by a classic one-pot synthesis using 5-bromo-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde (2) as a precursor.34 A Knoevenagel-type reaction of 2a at the C3 and C5 positions with 1b produced the compound EHT-BDP (3). A Stille coupling between 3 and bi-stannylated DTS and DTG afforded the target molecules Si-BDP and Ge-BDP, respectively. The molecular structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The characterization spectra of Si-BDP and Ge-BDP can be found in the ESI.†

Optical properties
The absorbance spectra of Si-BDP and Ge-BDP dyes in solution and thin film were investigated using UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy, shown in Fig. 2. These two dyes show identical optical properties in dichloromethane (DCM). Broad absorbance spectra were observed for these Bodipy donors with a λmax of 690 nm and λonset of 722 nm, resulting in an optical bandgap of 1.7 eV. Absorbance spectra were also recorded in the solid state (thin films), showing sufficient overlap with the solar spectrum with a λmax of 716 nm and λonset of 786 nm with a corresponding optical bandgap of 1.57 eV.35 From solution to thin film, a redshift of 26 nm was observed. Annealing the Si-BDP and Ge-BDP thin films at 90 °C for 5 minutes induced negligible changes in the absorbance spectra when compared to the films as-cast.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry was used to estimate the redox potentials of the dyes Si-BDP and Ge-BDP using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in dichloromethane as the supporting electrolyte. To estimate the frontier molecular orbital energy levels i.e., highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the cyclic voltammograms were calibrated using an external reference of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+).36 The dyes Si-BDP and Ge-BDP bear identical HOMO–LUMO energy levels and were calculated to be EHOMO = −5.47 eV and ELUMO = −3.76 eV. The cyclic voltammograms of these dyes are presented in Fig. 3. These energy levels demonstrate their strong suitability as donor materials in combination with fullerene acceptors for efficient photovoltaic performance.37

The oxidation and reduction potentials of the dyes were further confirmed by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using 0.1 M TBAPF6 in DCM as the electrolyte. The differential pulse voltammograms of the oxidation peaks of Si-BDP and Ge-BDP are exhibited at 0.678 and 0.670 (V), respectively, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The CV and DPV data support the electrochemical parameters calculated above and are in agreement with the results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Density functional theory calculations
The geometry and computed parameters of the Bodipy dyes were performed using the Gaussian 09 program package.38 The optimized geometries of Si-BDP and Ge-BDP are shown in Fig. 4. The DFT calculations that were used to obtain the frontier orbital energies and wavelength maxima of these dyes are in good agreement with the experimental data as listed in Table 1.

Photovoltaic characteristics
OSCs based on Si-BDP and Ge-BDP as donors with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Bodipy:PC70BM/Al (Fig. 5a) were fabricated. The active layer is made up of 1:1 (w/w) Bodipy donor, PC70BM acceptor (100 nm) and solvent additive (0–1% v/v). The energy levels of the different components of the device are presented in Fig. 5b.

The active layer of the devices were processed from chlorobenzene solution with varying quantities of solvent additive, i.e., 1,8 diiodooctane (DIO), and the photovoltaic parameters were investigated. Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of these devices. When no additive is present (i.e., 0% DIO), the device with Si-BDP:PC70BM produced a PCE of 4.16% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.767 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 10.09 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.538, whereas the device with Ge-BDP:PC70BM produced a Voc of 0.774 V, Jsc of 9.41 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.538, resulting in a PCE of 4.12%. Further addition of 0.4% DIO (v/v) to the active layer blend of the Si-BDP-based device resulted in a slight improvement in the PCE from 4.16% to 4.58%. Upon the additional increase of DIO content to 1%, the PCE dropped to 2.42%. Regarding the Ge-BDP-based device, upon the addition of 0.4% and 1% (v/v) DIO, the PCE decreased from 4.16% to 3.55% and 2.79%, respectively. The device performances under various conditions are presented in Table 2.

Experimental section
Instrumentation and materials
All precursor materials were purchased directly from commercial sources and were used without any further purification, and solvents were dried under vacuum by following standard procedures. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-Avance spectrometer. All the NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 with TMS as the internal reference. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry were performed on a CH Instrument with a three-electrode system.
Synthetic procedures

Synthesis of 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (1b). 
2-(2-Ethylhexyl)thiophene (1a) was synthesized by the procedure reported in literature.28 Compound 1b was prepared by a Vilsmeier reaction of 1a, following a similar procedure to earlier reports.29 To the stirred solution of anhydrous DMF (0.8 mL, 10.18 mmol) in 10 mL dichloroethane (DCE) at 0 °C in a 50 mL round bottom flask under nitrogen atmosphere, POCl3 (0.9 mL, 10.18 mmol) was added dropwise for 5 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Then, compound 1a (2 g, 10.18 mmol) was added in a dropwise manner at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to reach RT; then, it was stirred for 3 h at 70 °C and monitored by TLC. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT and poured into ice water, and then carefully neutralized with a 10% NaOH solution. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane, and after the removal of the solvent, the crude mixture was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel eluting with hexanes/ethyl acetate (8:2) to give compound 1b as a colorless oil. (1.48 g, 65%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ ppm 9.82 (s, 1H), 7.61 (d, J = 3.8 Hz, 1H), 6.88 (d, J = 3.67 Hz, 1H), 2.81 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 1.63 (m, 1H), 1.37–1.28 (m, 8H), 0.91–0.87 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): δ ppm 182.3, 156.2, 141.7, 136.9, 126.7, 41.3, 34.6, 32.2, 28.6, 25.4, 22.8, 14.0, 10.6.


Synthesis of EHT-BDP (3). 
4,4-Difluoro-8-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (2a) was synthesized by a classic one-pot synthesis using 5-bromothiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (2) and 2,4 dimethyl pyrrole in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid to form a dipyrromethane intermediate. This was followed by an oxidation reaction in the presence of DDQ to form dipyrrin, which in turn complexed with BF3·Et2O in the presence of triethylamine to produce Bodipy 2a in a 26% yield.30 Compound 3 was synthesized from 2a and 1b using a Knoevenagel-type reaction. The reaction was carried out in a 50 mL two-necked round-bottom flask. A mixture of 2a (1.13 g, 2.76 mmol, 1 eq.), 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (1b) (1.3 g, 5.8 mmol, 2.1 eq.) and piperidine (0.5 mL) in 15 mL toluene and 0.4 mL acetic acid was added, and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 8 h. Any water formed during the reaction was azeotropically removed by using a Dean–Stark apparatus. After disappearance of the aldehyde (as monitored by TLC), the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the crude products were purified by column chromatography (dichloromethane/hexanes, 1/9, v/v). Compound 3 was isolated as a dark green powder (EHT-BDP), 1.02 g, yield 45%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm 7.40–7.28 (m, 4H), 7.11–7.09 (m, 1H), 7.05 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 6.79 (d, J = 3.7 Hz, 1H), 6.71 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 6.60 (s, 2H), 2.77 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 4H), 1.74 (s, 6H), 1.63 (dd, J = 13.5, 7.5 Hz, 2H), 1.41–1.34 (m, 4H), 1.32 (d, J = 1.8 Hz, 12H), 0.94–0.89 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm 152.77, 148.15, 141.48, 140.36, 137.04, 134.35, 130.27, 129.97, 128.94, 127.27, 126.42, 118.17, 117.17, 113.71, 41.57, 34.78, 32.46, 28.90, 25.60, 23.05, 14.18, 14.09, 10.85.

Synthesis of Si-BDP. 
A 25 mL glass round-bottom flask was charged with EHT-BDP (173 mg, 0.21 mmol), 5,5′-bis(tributylstannyl)-3,3′-di-2-ethylhexylsilylene-2,2′-bithiophene (compound 4, 100 mg, 0.1 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (18 mg, 0.02 mmol), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (9 mg, 0.03 mmol) and toluene (8 mL) under N2. The reaction mixture was heated to 110 °C for 6 h. Upon cooling, the material was then purified by flash chromatography using hexanes/chloroform (9.5:0.5). After fraction collection and solvent removal, the compound Si-BDP was obtained as a green solid with an isolated yield of 62%. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm 7.34 (t, J = 13.0 Hz, 4H), 7.18 (d, J = 2.6 Hz, 2H), 7.06 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 6.91 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 1H), 6.72 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 2H), 6.61 (s, 2H), 2.77 (d, J = 6.7 Hz, 4H), 1.82 (s, 6H), 1.65 (s, 2H), 1.56 (s, 3H), 1.51–1.27 (m, 20H), 1.24–1.00 (m, 8H), 0.92 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 12H), 0.82 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm 152.60, 148.03, 147.68, 144.43, 141.65, 140.41, 139.83, 137.39, 134.51, 133.40, 129.78, 129.32, 128.81, 128.35, 127.13, 126.39, 123.16, 118.03, 117.27, 41.56, 35.95, 35.61, 34.77, 32.45, 29.09, 28.89, 28.83, 25.59, 23.05, 17.60, 14.18, 10.91, 10.84. MALDI-TOF (m/z): calculated for C110H140B2F4N4S8Si: 1898.87; observed (M+): 1898.97.

The compound Ge-BDP was synthesized by following the synthetic procedure described above, and was obtained as a green solid in 68% isolated yield. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm 7.36 (q, J = 15.9 Hz, 8H), 7.18 (d, J = 2.6 Hz, 4H), 7.06 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 4H), 6.91 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 6.72 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 4H), 6.61 (s, 4H), 2.77 (d, J = 6.7 Hz, 8H), 1.82 (s, 12H), 1.65 (s, 4H), 1.56 (s, 6H), 1.49–1.25 (m, 40H), 1.23–0.99 (m, 16H), 0.92 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 24H), 0.82 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm 152.59, 148.02, 145.81, 145.31, 141.67, 140.41, 139.91, 137.21, 134.52, 133.32, 129.77, 129.32, 128.81, 128.39, 127.18, 126.39, 123.07, 118.03, 117.28, 41.57, 37.03, 35.50, 34.78, 32.46, 28.90, 25.59, 23.12, 23.05, 20.82, 14.19, 10.99, 10.85. MALDI-TOF (m/z): calculated for C110H140B2F4N4S8Ge: 1945.82; observed (M + 1+): 1946.82.

Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) studies
DPV studies were performed using an electrochemical analyzer having three electrodes, namely, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a glassy carbon working electrode and a platinum wire counter-electrode. The oxidation potentials of the dyes Si-BDP and Ge-BDP were measured using a supporting electrolyte i.e., 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in dichloromethane, with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple as an internal redox standard.32 The DPVs of the oxidation peaks of Si-BDP and Ge-BDP appeared at 0.678 and 0.670 (V), respectively, shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Density functional theory calculations
The frontier molecular orbital energy levels associated with the designed Bodipy donor molecules were calculated by performing ab initio calculations based on the time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) using the B3LYP/6-311g(d,p) basis set. The excitation energy and oscillator strength for the lowest singlet–singlet transitions for Si-BDP and Ge-BDP dyes were obtained by TD-DFT calculations using the same basis set, presented in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†).
Fabrication of organic solar cells
A commercially available ITO glass substrate was cleaned with soap solution and then with ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone and propan-2-ol sequentially for 15 minutes each. The substrates were dried in an oven and then exposed to ultraviolet ozone irradiation for 15 min. The standard device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active-layer/Al is as follows. A thin layer 30 nm of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 1 min onto the above ITO substrate and dried at 140 °C in air for 15 min. The donor and acceptor concentration in chlorobenzene being 5 mg mL−1 (1:1 w/w blend ratio) and DIO (0–1% v/v), the active layers were spin-coated at 1500 rpm in a glove box. The thickness of the active layer was measured to be 100 nm. Then, a 100 nm aluminum (Al) cathode was thermally evaporated. The active device area was measured to be 10 mm2 as defined by a shadow mask. These fabricated solar cells were encapsulated with epoxy and cover glasses and exposed to ultraviolet irradiation for 15 min. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured by a solar simulator from Sciencetech (model-SS 150, class-AAA) at 1 sun illumination, i.e., 1000 W m−2 light intensity. Current vs. voltage (J–V) data was acquired using a Keithley 2420 source meter.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed new donor molecules based on thienyl Bodipy wings conjugated to DTS and DTG cores. Under optimized conditions, desirable PCEs of 4.58% and 4.12% were observed for the newly synthesized Si-BDP and Ge-BDP, respectively. The EQE spectra of these devices exhibit a broad absorption from 300–800 nm. Furthermore, our study on these materials demonstrates their competent PCEs, which surely paves the way for upcoming developments in designing more promising Bodipy donor materials for OSCs.
