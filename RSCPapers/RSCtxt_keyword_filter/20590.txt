    , Accepted 25th August 2021First published on 26th August 2021AbstractLow-cost Ni@C core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by means of the electrical explosion of wire method and were applied as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. XPS, HRTEM, and BET results revealed that the carbon shell effectively protects the metallic core from oxidation while providing a porous structure that yields a high surface area, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity. Through material analysis, we established a link between synthesis conditions and resulting morphology, electronic and crystal structure of the outer layers of Ni@C NPs. Thanks to the optimum morphology and favorable shell electronic structure, Ni@C(15%) showed superior catalytic activity. An electrolyzer based on bifunctional Ni@C(15%) required only 1.71 V of voltage to deliver 10 mA cm−2. The overpotential for water splitting is 0.12 V lower than that for a Ni benchmark electrolyzer. A stable and scalable PV-electrolysis system for water splitting that is fully based on all-inorganic CIGS PV and Ni@C(15%) was constructed. Water splitting is driven at a high current of ∼10 mA under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, corresponding to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 8.14% with 11.65% efficiency of the sub-module at the operating point. The efficiency of the STH device can be increased up to 10% by increasing the operating current through a further decrease of the Ni@C(15%) catalyst overpotential by optimization of its electronic structure.
Introduction
Hydrogen and oxygen production by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting is a promising method by which clean energy could be produced without leaving a carbon footprint.1,2 Unfortunately, to date the production cost of hydrogen is still higher than that of the gasoline-equivalent.3 One of the promising solutions is to use sunlight as a source of energy. In relation to this, a solar cell (SC) can be connected to an electrolyzer and electricity can be continuously supplied. To date, the R&D in the field of photovoltaics for hydrogen (or solar-to-hydrogen (STH) in short) production is directed towards highly efficient, scalable, and low-cost devices. Among the most promising SC candidates for this purpose are crystalline silicon (c-Si), Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS), and perovskite SCs.4 However, third-generation SCs, including perovskite solar cells (PSCs), are unstable under ambient conditions; large-scale and long-term implementation of PSCs is hindered by stability issues. An STH setup powered by c-Si modules demonstrated an STH efficiency of 9.7%. An STH setup based on CIGS solar cells exhibits an STH efficiency of ∼11%. The CIGS SC production cost is significantly lower than that of the Si SC due to the use of less material and lower energy requirements for manufacturing. Additionally, thin-film SCs have a significantly lower energy payback time than c-Si SCs (one year for CIGS vs. two years for c-Si SCs).5 Furthermore, comparable photoconversion efficiency values of lab-scale SCs based on CIGS (22.9%) and c-Si (25.6%) make the CIGS SC a promising alternative.6
Water splitting occurs in an electrolyzer, where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs at the cathode. The materials of the electrodes play an essential role in enhancing the efficiency of the overall reaction.7 During the electrolysis process, 1.23 V is the overall theoretical potential difference that must be applied to water splitting. In reality, potential values in the range of 1.8–2.4 V are commonly applied in commercial electrolyzers due to the high overpotentials of the HER and OER.8–11 Electrodes made of noble-metal catalysts such as Pt, RuO2, and IrO2 are considered superior catalysts due to their superior kinetics and lower overpotentials.12,13 However, their high cost and natural scarcity limit the applications of noble metals. Transition-metal catalysts such as Ni, Fe, Co, and their derivatives can effectively replace the aforementioned noble metals due to their low cost, high availability, and fair catalytic activity.14–17 The morphology of the catalyst plays a very important role and can critically affect the performance of the catalyst.18–20 For example, in the work by Shen et al.,19 the excellent electrochemical performance of CoNi2S4 with various morphologies was demonstrated. Wang's group20 prepared MoS2–carbon composites with different morphologies and optimized the morphology for high catalytic activity for the HER. However, one general problem is that non-precious metals and their oxides are only stable at a neutral pH, limiting their applications in various types of electrolyzers.21 One possible solution to this issue is to alloy a transition metal with a noble metal.22 Alternatively, the metal catalyst can be covered with a shell, which dramatically improves its stability. Recently, carbon-based materials were shown to be highly durable in acidic and alkaline media.23,24 A promising strategy to increase the stability of a transition-metal catalyst is to wrap it inside a protective carbon layer.
Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in carbon (referred to as Ni@C) via the one-step electric explosion of wire (EEW) method. By tuning the composition of the gaseous chamber environment, it is possible to control the morphology of the synthesized NPs. Both size and shell thickness can be tuned by adjusting the CH4/Ar ratio. The outer shell has high conductivity due to the existence of a polyconjugated sp2 network, which promotes the catalytic reaction. Furthermore, the carbon shell completely prevents direct contact between the electrolyte and the encapsulated metal NPs, protecting the latter from degradation in a reactive chemical environment. Thus, these catalysts show good long-term stability. Linking synthesis, structure, and catalytic activity, we discovered that synthesizing Ni@C NPs with CH4/Ar = 15% is the optimum strategy for obtaining a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst towards both the OER and HER in alkaline electrolytes. A stable and scalable PV-electrolysis system for water splitting based on an all-inorganic CIGS solar sub-module was also constructed as part of this study. The sub-module includes an interconnected series of CIGS cells. The CIGS sub-cell fabrication procedure was chosen to obtain suitable electrical characteristics to fit the overpotential required for water splitting. The solar module operates with a near-maximum solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Water splitting proceeds at a high current of ∼10 mA under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, corresponding to an STH efficiency of 8.14%.
Results & discussion
Surface analysis of Ni@C
During EEW in an inert atmosphere, ions represent primary condensation centers and are correlated with the expansion rate of the primary material.25 Upon the introduction of methane into the chamber, the particle formation mechanism slightly changes due to the rapid thermal decomposition of CH4 into hydrogen and solid carbon around the explosion area. The explosion results in carbon atoms wrapping the nickel particles in the core@shell Ni@C structure. Once C atoms wrapped the particles, their growth stops. Logically, the CH4/Ar ratio would impact the particle diameter (a higher amount of C atoms could lead to the rapid formation of small Ni@C particles) and the amount of C atoms in the shell. The morphology of the obtained Ni@C NPs was investigated using TEM measurements, as shown in Fig. 1a–e and S1–S5.† The following analysis revealed the spherical shape of Ni@C NPs with a quite noticeable size deviation. The calculation results of the average diameter and shell thickness are presented in Fig. 1i and S6.† The shell thickness changes with changes in the particle size, as indicated in the representative HRTEM image of Ni@C(15%), Fig. 1f. The observed crystalline features in the Ni@C shells are typically graphitic layers with a lattice fringe of 3.4 Å (Fig. 1f). EDS-mapping analysis of Ni@C(15%) shows the encapsulation of Ni inside the carbon shell (Fig. 1g–h). Ni@C(0%) exhibits well-defined spherical nanoparticles of an average diameter of 51.1 nm. It is worth mentioning that the shell that wraps NPs is amorphous (Fig. S1c†), suggesting that the outer layers could be NiO formed due to oxidation during collection and handling. When CH4 is introduced into the reaction chamber the average particle size decreases almost two-fold. Such an observation is in good agreement with the synthesis hypothesis about the formation of Ni@C core@shell NPs. The shell structure of Ni@C(5%) appears to be mixed, exhibiting features of both – amorphous NiO and crystalline graphite (Fig. S2c†). Perhaps, although carbon atoms effectively wrap Ni nanoparticles, the number of layers is not enough to prevent oxidation of the metallic core. A further increase of the CH4/Ar ratio leads to a further reduction of the average diameter (Ni@C(10%)) and remains almost unchanged for Ni@C(15%) and Ni@C(20%). In contrast to the average diameter, the shell thickness significantly increases upon increasing CH4/Ar over 15%.

XPS is a powerful tool for probing the surface structure of nanosized materials;26,27 thus to gain insight into the surface chemistry of the synthesized nanoparticles, XPS measurements and analyses were performed. Because the synthesized particles are assumed to consist of two elements, the Ni2p and C1s core levels are of utmost interest during the measurements. Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of Ni2p and C1s core levels for all samples under study. The results of the deconvolution of the Ni2p core-level spectra recorded for all samples are given in Table 1. There are dramatic changes in the shape and intensity of the signals recorded for the samples with non-zero carbon contents. The Ni2p spectrum of Ni@C(0%) NPs decomposed into four components of metallic Ni, two NiOx features, and satellite features. The binding energies of the oxide peaks were assigned according to the representative XPS lines of standard compounds reported in the literature.28 It was observed that the peak of metallic Ni becomes steeper with an increase in the carbon content; thus, all of the nickel present in the samples is metallic for the Ni@C(x) NPs in the x = 10%, 15%, and 20% cases (Fig. 2a). Ni@C(5%) appears to be an intermediate state, where most likely a thin oxide layer exists under the carbon shell, which is in good agreement with the TEM results (Fig. S2c†). Regarding the C1s core level, the peak intensity increases noticeably upon the introduction of the carbon shell (Fig. 2b). The carbon spectrum decomposed into two components, carbon represented by a C–C bond and carboxyl groups.29 The results of the deconvolution of the C1s core-level spectra recorded for the catalysts under study are given in Table 2.

Raman spectroscopy was carried out to characterize the degree of disorder in the crystal structures of carbon in the Ni@C NPs. All acquired spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra show two intense features in the range of 1200–1700 cm−1 and low-intensity 2D Raman mode in the range of 2600–3200 cm−1. The intense peaks are related to the first-order allowed tangential G band and the disorder-induced D mode.30 The fitting yields the G band and the disorder-induced D, D*, and D** peaks.31 The G mode is related to the in-plane motion of C sp2 atoms, and it is common to all sp2 carbon systems.32 The D mode is forbidden in perfect graphite and only active in the presence of disorders. Meanwhile, the 2D band is not related to the functional groups or sp3 carbon, but to the ‘physical’ defects. The increase of defects leads to the broadening of the 2D band and the rise of the modulated 2D band.31 The sp2 sites tend to cluster in an sp3 matrix and the area ratio of the D and G bands varies with the size of the sp2 clusters in carbon.33 A comparison of the spectra recorded for Ni@C(5%), Ni@C(10%), Ni@C(15%), and Ni@C(20%) NPs yields ID/IG area ratios of 0.59, 0.61, 0.83, 0.90, respectively. The lowering of the ID/IG ratio points out the increase in the average size of the sp2 clusters. The estimated Tuinstra and Koenig relation size of graphitic clusters in the shell for synthesized NPs follows the sequence of 75 Å (Ni@C(5%)), 72 Å (Ni@C(10%)), 53 Å (Ni@C(15%)), and 48 Å (Ni@C(20%)). Kaniyoor et al.31 found that the ‘physical’ defects (not functional groups) cause the suppression of the 2D band. In the case of Ni@C, all spectra show well distinguishable profiles of 2D bands, but not a modulated bump. The peak intensity ratio of I2D/IG was estimated to be around 0.5 for all synthesized Ni@C NPs. This result suggested a comparatively low-defective structure for all Ni@C NPs, leading to a comparable impact on their conductivity. Fundamentally, the electrical properties correlate closely with defects and the sp2 site content, as well as with the degree of sp2 clustering. Given that the conductivity of the carbon shell increases with increasing the dimension of sp2 clusters in a network of sp3 bonded carbon, the CH4/Ar ratio in the reaction chamber should be chosen as 5%. However, to deduce the optimal synthesis condition, the Raman analysis data should be combined with data obtained from other analysis tools.

N2 adsorption/desorption measurements were carried out to evaluate the specific surface area and pore size of the as-synthesized Ni@C NPs. BET data (Fig. S7†) show that the increase in the CH4/Ar ratio leads to the increase in the BET surface area. The observed isotherm is type “III”, which is characteristic of non-porous materials with weak interactions with an adsorbate. Therefore, the pores in this material are likely to be slits between smaller nanoparticles on the surface of bigger particles. Their presence was previously confirmed by TEM measurements and are clearly visible in TEM micrographs in Fig. S1–S5.† In summary, the increase of the surface area in the sequence of Ni@C(0%) < Ni@C(5%) < Ni@C(10%) is attributed to the significant decrease of the average particle size, while the increase in the surface area in the sequence of Ni@C(10%) < Ni@C(15%) < Ni@C(20%) originates from better coverage (i.e. lower interparticle distance).
A combination of TEM, Raman, XPS, and BET data allows us to draw a conclusion on the optimum morphology, shell structure, and surface area for the highest catalytic activity. From the TEM and XPS results it can be concluded that the shell thickness continuously increases with the increase of the CH4/Ar ratio. The increase of the carbon shell thickness may result in a decrease in the catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst,32 making Ni@C(20%) less likely to have the highest catalytic activity. The XPS data indicate the presence of a thick amorphous oxide shell in Ni@C(0%) and Ni@C(5%). Additionally, from TEM data, it can be observed that these samples have a higher average particle diameter, which results in a significantly lower surface area, which is in good agreement with the BET results. For the aforementioned reasons, the CH4/Ar ratios in the reaction chamber of 0%, 5%, and 20% are not favorable synthesis conditions. At this point, it is hard to say which of the intermediate NPs of Ni@C(10%) and Ni@C(15%) are a better choice. The advantage of Ni@C(10%) is the larger sp2 cluster size (from Raman) and thinner carbon shell thickness (from TEM), while Ni@C(15%) has a higher surface area (BET) and higher surface at% of sp2 states (from XPS). Further, electrochemical analysis is required to reveal which of the properties will affect the catalytic activity the most.
HER and OER performances
The electrochemical performances of the developed bifunctional catalysts were analyzed using a three-electrode configuration with a rotating disc electrode. The developed catalysts were compared to commercial Pt/C (20% Pt/C) coated on glassy carbon. All measurements were done in a 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 at room temperature. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the commercial Pt/C and synthesized catalysts are presented in Fig. 4a. A minimum required overpotential (η) of 182 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 was recorded for Ni@C(15%) and Ni@C(10%), while a maximum value of 280 mV was required for Ni@C(0%). Tafel plots were used to identify the rate-determining step of the HER, as shown in Fig. 4b. Although the overpotential required for 10 mA cm−2 is similar for the Ni@C(10%) and Ni@C(15%) catalysts, the Tafel slope of the Ni@C(15%) catalyst showed the lowest value of 103.3 mV dec−1 compared to those of 140.3, 139.7, 169.1, and 181.8 mV dec−1 recorded for Ni@C(10%), Ni@C(20%), Ni@C(5%), and Ni@C(0%), respectively. This value is significantly higher than that calculated for the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 4b), but it is acceptable for a transition metal. The obtained results proved the highest electrochemical activity of the Ni@C(15%) catalyst among the synthesized catalysts. It should be noted that the developed Ni@C(15%) catalyst showed a lower value of the Tafel slope than those reported for Ni@N-doped carbon (190 mV),34 NiCuO (205 mV),35 Fe–Ni@NC-CNTs (202 mV),36 Ni0.5Fe0.5-HP (215 m V),37 Si3Te2 (237 mV),37 NiSe2@NG (248 mV),37 Ni–Fe–C–Mo (254 mV),37 PO–Ni/Ni–N-CNFs (262 mV),38 and NiFeLDH-NS@DG10 (300 mV).39 The results of a comparative analysis of the HER overpotentials and the Tafel slopes of the synthesized catalysts as well as the corresponding data reported in the literature are presented in Fig. 4c.

The mechanism of the HER process could be determined using the Tafel slope value in an alkaline solution.40 The choice is based on the slope value. The Volmer reaction (Tafel slope > 120 mV dec−1) corresponds to the discharge step, which is considered as the rate-determining step owing to the difficulty of water dissociation, while the Heyrovsky reaction (40 mV dec−1 < Tafel slope < 120 mV dec−1) corresponds to electrochemical hydrogen desorption. For slope values less than 30 mV−1, the mechanism would involve hydrogen recombination, which determines the HER reaction rate fit to chemical desorption. Therefore, the Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction mechanism (H2O + e− → Hads + OH−, Hads + H2O + e− → OH− + H2↑) for the HER process can be considered for the Ni@C(15%) catalyst, where Hads is attributed to the H atoms adsorbed on the surfaces of the catalysts.
We also investigated the electrocatalytic properties of Ni@C NPs toward catalyzing the OER at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in a 1.0 M KOH solution. The commercial RuO2 catalyst was used as a reference. Fig. 4d shows the OER polarization curves. As can be seen, the Ni@C(15%) sample exhibits the lowest overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm−2, demonstrating the highest OER activity compared to the activities of the other catalysts under study. Moreover, the overpotential recorded for the Ni@C(15%) catalyst was 50 mV lower than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst.
Additionally, Ni@C(15%) exhibits the smallest Tafel slope value of 49 mV dec−1, which is noticeably smaller than the values of 105, 119, 102, 87, and 77 mV dec−1 obtained for the RuO2, Ni@C(0%), Ni@C(5%), Ni@C(10%), and Ni@C(20%) catalysts, respectively (Fig. 4e). The result indicates that the Ni@C(15%) catalyst is most favorable for the OER kinetics and exhibits the highest catalytic activity among the synthesized catalysts. It should be noted that the measured overpotentials for Ni@C NP catalysts in 1 M KOH are lower than the overpotentials of the reported catalysts.41–48 The results of the comparison of the OER overpotentials at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and the Tafel slopes obtained here with the corresponding data for catalysts reported in the literature are given in Fig. 4f.
Electrochemical analysis and stability of the catalyst
The electro-chemically active surface area (ECSA) is an effective parameter to use when evaluating the relative electrocatalytic activity of the material for the HER and OER. Because the ECSA is proportional to the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), it was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements performed at different scan rates in the non-faradaic capacitive range of 1.07 to 1.17 V vs. RHE (Fig. S8, ESI†).49Fig. 5a shows the charging current density measured at an overpotential value of 1.12 V plotted as a function of the scan rate for five catalysts, giving the differential capacitance of the interface. These results show that the Cdl values follow the sequence of 0.05, 0.06, 0.10, 0.10, and 0.20 mF cm−2 corresponding to the Ni@C(5%), Ni@C(0%), Ni@C(10%), Ni@C(20%), Ni@C(15%) catalysts, respectively. According to the obtained data, the Ni@C(15%) catalyst appears to be the most efficient catalyst with the highest ECSA and an abundance of catalytically active sites.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the synthesized catalysts were performed to highlight the kinetics of the catalysts toward the HER and OER. Fig. 5b shows the Nyquist plots obtained under an applied potential of −1.1 V (vs. RHE) at room temperature. All of the samples showed one well-resolved semicircle in the Nyquist plots. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) is controlled by the semicircle in the high-frequency region, associated with the overall rate of the HER and OER. The data of the charge transfer resistance of the developed catalysts are given in Table 3. A minimum Rct value of 90.5 Ω was achieved for Ni@C(15%), suggesting the ultrafast kinetics and a superior faradaic process leading to the promotion of the electron transfer. Therefore, the Ni@C(15%) catalyst shows excellent HER and OER electrocatalytic activities.

The electrochemical analysis data allow us to link the structural properties of Ni@C to its catalytic activity. Namely, Ni@C(0%) has the lowest catalytic activity due to the highest value of the Tafel slope (both HER and OER) because of the biggest average particle size (from TEM), lowest surface area (BET), and highest Rct from the thick NiOx layer covering the nanoparticles (from TEM and XPS). As compared to NiC(0%), Ni@C(5%) has a lower overpotential and lower Rct and Cdl, and thus its catalytic activity is better than NiC(0%). A further increase of the CH4/Ar ratio to 10%, results in a lower average particle size, disappearance of the oxide layer (higher shell conductivity), and higher specific surface area, which in turn resulted in a noticeable decrease of the overpotential for the HER as well as the OER. The obtained data indicate that Ni@C(15%) NPs are the most efficient catalyst with the lowest Rct value among the synthesized samples. The observed results could be attributed to a more favorable carbon shell structure (as suggested by XPS) and higher surface area (from BET). In contrast to Ni@C(15%), Ni@C(10%) NPs have higher Rct and therefore lower catalytic activity. Therefore, optimized synthesis conditions for Ni@C NPs are performing the explosion in a chamber with a CH4/Ar ratio of 15%.
To evaluate the catalytic stability toward the HER and OER, long-term stability tests were conducted at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH for over 18 hours (Fig. 5c and d). Although the overpotential value of Ni@C(15%) is higher than that of cPt/C, Ni@C(15%) exhibits noticeably better stability. Surprisingly for the Ni@C(15%) sample, the overpotential value even decreased slightly after 18 hours of operation, indicating the exceptional stability of the catalyst. Unlike Ni@C(15%), commercial cPt/C showed an 81 mV increase of the overpotential, indicating lower long-term operation stability as compared to that of the developed Ni@C(15%) electrocatalyst. Furthermore, Ni@C(15%) reveals high stability in the OER as well, as can be seen in Fig. 5d. Therefore, the developed Ni@C(15%) catalyst is a promising alternative bi-functional catalyst for the HER and OER long-term operation in a strong base electrolyte.
Electrochemical overall water splitting
Based on the electrochemical results, among the synthesized catalysts, Ni@C(15%) is the most efficient electrocatalyst toward both the HER and OER in an alkaline electrolyte. Therefore, a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer was constructed. Ni@C(15%) was employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. For comparison, electrolyzers based on the benchmark RuO2(+)‖Pt–C(−) and Ni foam (+)‖Ni foam (−) electrodes were also tested (Fig. 6a and b).
 Fig. 6  (a) LSV polarization curves of the Ni@C(15%) (−)‖Ni@C(15%) (+) electrolyzer and of the benchmark RuO2 (+)‖Pt–C (−) and Ni foam (+)‖Ni foam (−) electrolyzers in a two-electrode configuration at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. (b) Chronoamperometry curve of the Ni@C(15%) (−)‖Ni@C(15%) (+) electrolyzer at a cell voltage of 1.73 V. (c) Polarization curves of the benchmark Pt–C/RuO2 catalyst with a voltage difference of 1.60 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. (d) Polarization curves of the Ni@C(15%) catalyst. A voltage difference of 1.71 V was recorded at a fixed current density of 10 mA cm−2. 
As can be seen in Fig. 6a, the Ni@C(15%) (−)‖ Ni@C(15%) (+) electrode required a net cell voltage of 1.73 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting. This value is only 60 mV higher than that of the benchmark RuO2 (+)‖Pt–C (−) electrode, but it is much lower than the net cell voltage of 1.83 V obtained for the Ni foam (+)‖Ni foam (−) electrode. For a two-electrode configuration, the net cell voltage required to achieve a particular current density for overall water splitting should be close to the potential difference between the two half-reactions. In order to verify this for our systems, the steady-state polarization curves were recorded for the RuO2 (+)‖Pt–C (−) and Ni@C(15%) (−)‖Ni@C(15%) (+) electrodes, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. These electrodes delivered a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at net cell voltages of 1.60 and 1.71 V, respectively. The determined voltage values are very close to the values of 1.65 and 1.73 V required for overall water splitting (Fig. 6a).
The long-term stability was further evaluated for the Ni@C(15%) (−)‖Ni@C(15%) (+) and benchmark RuO2 (+)‖Pt–C (−) electrolyzers at constant potentials of 1.73 and 1.65 V, respectively (Fig. 6b). The long-term stability was also evaluated by performing overall water splitting in a two-electrode configuration at a constant potential of 1.73 V for Ni@C(15%) and 1.65 V for benchmark electrodes (Fig. 6b). The current of the Ni@C(15%) (−)‖Ni@C(15%) (+) electrolyzer showed fair stability for over 24 h. In contrast, the RuO2 (+)‖Pt–C (−) electrolyzer revealed a gradual decrease in the current within 24 h. The ESI video† included as part of this study shows water electrolysis on the Ni@C(15%) (−)‖Ni@C(15%) (+) electrode at a constant cell voltage of 1.73 V. A steady current output with a vigorous release of H2 and O2 gas bubbles at the cathode and anode for over 24 h was recorded. Thus, the Ni@C(15%) catalyst demonstrates high activity and good stability for overall electrochemical water splitting.
Construction and optimization of the PV-driven water splitting setup for minimal energy loss
For photovoltaic-driven water splitting, CIGS sub-modules were integrated with a water-splitting unit to create a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) system. The CIGS module captures sunlight and converts it into electricity, directly feeding the electrochemical water-splitting unit. A schematic illustration of the STH setup is shown in Fig. 7a (detailed in the ESI†). Given that the typical Voc of one CIGS cell is ∼0.6 V and a voltage of 1.73 V is required for the Ni@C(15%) electrolyzer to drive the water-splitting process, a minimum number of three CIGS cells should be connected in series to power the electrolyzer. Therefore, solar sub-modules consisting of three and four CIGS cells were connected via a serial connection (further labeled as CIGS-3 and CIGS-4, respectively). In our STH system, the minimal energy loss during electrical to chemical energy conversion was achieved by optimization of the sub-module structure. Taking into account that a voltage of 1.73 V is required for the Ni@C(15%) electrolyzer to drive the water-splitting process, both sub-modules can be used for the construction of a solar-energy-driven water splitting system. Isc values of 11.12 and 11.40 mA along with Voc values of 1.81 and 2.42 V were recorded for the CIGS-3 and CIGS-4 sub-modules, respectively. The performance of the STH setup can be preliminarily estimated via the determination of the operating point (intersection of the IV or PV curve of the CIGS sub-module and LSV curve of the electrocatalyst system operated in a two-electrode configuration). The operating point is the key concept when linking the solar cell and electrolyzer to the STH system. The current (Iop) and voltage (Vop) define the operational regime of the solar cell and electrolyzer, allowing the calculation of the efficiency of the solar cells under the STH operating conditions. The operating point was derived from the I–V, P–V, and LSV curves of the solar sub-modules and the electrolyzer, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7b and c. The importance of adjusting the electrical output of the solar cell with regard to the performance of the electrocatalyst becomes apparent from the comparison of the operating points of the STH systems equipped with CIGS-3 and CIGS-4. The efficiency of CIGS-3 at the operating point is ∼5.61% and that of CIGS-4 is ∼11.65%, while the maximum efficiency for both sub-modules is ∼11.70%. Therefore, due to the unfavorable operation regime, more than half of the potential electricity that could be generated by CIGS-3 is unused. Next, the operating current of the STH units based on CIGS-4 was recorded in an unbiased light-driven configuration (Fig. 7d). We found that the current is consistent with the value of 10 mA estimated from the intersections of the I–V curves of the CIGS-4 sub-module and the LSV curves of the Ni@C(15%) catalyst (Fig. 7b). The similarity between the actual and estimated operating photocurrents indicates that both CIGS modules were well integrated into the STH device without any significant electrical resistance (Fig. 7b–d). Meanwhile, CIGS-4 operates in a regime in close proximity to Pmax, as indicated in Fig. 7c. This observation mainly stems from the suitable PV characteristics of the CIGS solar cell, in particular Voc and FF.

For a solar-driven water-splitting system that produces only H2(g) and O2(g) as the outputs, the system efficiency is commonly designated as the STH efficiency50 and is calculated as follows: (1)where Psun is the input power from solar illumination and Iop is the operating current of the system (under the assumption that the faradaic efficiency for hydrogen and oxygen production is 100%). For efficient STH production, the solar water-splitting unit should be operated at a high current density and with Vop slightly lower than the voltage at the maximum power operating point (VMPP) of the PV component.
In our STH system, the operating point is located near the maximum power point Pmax of the module (Fig. 7c). The water-splitting reaction is driven at a high current density. This yields an operating current of ∼10 mA under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, corresponding to an STH efficiency of 8.14% (calculated using eqn (1)). According to the stability data (Fig. S10, ESI,† and the subsequent discussion), an STH efficiency of ∼8% can be maintained for at least three hours under 1-sun illumination. Another virtue of the constructed system is its quick response to the changes in the incident light irradiance. Unlike the PSC-based STH system, CIGS-STH shows no decrease in the photocurrent under chopped irradiation (Fig. 7e) and the photocurrent remains at the same level during the measurements.51
The efficiency of the STH device can be enhanced to 10% with a further increase in the operating current. Two possible pathways can be suggested. The first is to prevent losses in photocurrent by minimizing the shadowing losses on the front side of the CIGS cells. The lowering level of shadowing losses will increase the operating current of the STH device. The second pathway to increase the operating current is a decrease in the overpotential of the Ni@C(15%) NP catalyst by optimizing its chemical composition.
Conclusions
In this work, Ni@C was successfully fabricated using a one-step EEW process. By tuning the synthesis conditions, we were able to establish a link between the CH4 content in the feed gas, and optimal morphology, structure, and electronic properties of the Ni@C core@shell NPs required for high catalytic activity. Next, combining the BET, TEM, XPS, Raman results with electrochemical measurement data, it was found that Ni@C(15%) is the most efficient electrocatalyst due to its favorable morphology and electronic structure of the carbon shell. In the HER and OER, the overpotentials of Ni@C(15%) in an alkaline solution are only 182 mV cm−2 and 290 mV cm−2 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The main advantage of Ni@C(15%) is its bifunctionality and better operation in alkaline electrolytes, superior as compared to those of the conventional noble-metal-based catalyst. The second half of this work was dedicated to the construction of a solar sub-module based on CIGS solar cells and optimization of the STH setup. The developed STH system showed good energy efficiency, and the efficiency of the employed CIGS sub-module at the operating point is only 0.04% less than its maximum. Furthermore, the constructed STH setup shows good stability, suggesting a potential direction for the development of STH devices based on a CIGS sub-module. The constructed CIGS solar sub-module exhibits an efficiency of ∼11.69%, with an efficiency of 11.65% at the operating point for solar-induced water splitting. However, due to the high overpotential values of the developed catalyst, the overall water-splitting efficiency was 8.14%. This value can be improved by increasing the short-circuit current of the sub-module while also lowering the overpotential for water splitting.
Experimental section
Materials
Nickel foam (>99.5%, thickness 4.6 mm, density 350 g cm−2) was supplied by Invisible Inc., Korea. Commercial Pt/C (activated carbon-supported Pt NPs, 20 wt% Pt), ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2, 99.9% trace metals basis), and potassium hydroxide (KOH, 99.99% trace metals basis) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA). The Nafion D521 solution (5 wt%) used here was purchased from DuPont (USA). Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm−1 from a JL–RO 100 Millipore-Q Plus purifier was used throughout the experiments.
Synthesis of Ni@C NPs
The Ni@C NPs were synthesized using the one-step EEW method.25,52,53 Briefly, a Ni wire is heated by the passage of a high-density pulse current, inducing the evaporation of Ni atoms. Ni NPs are formed by the condensation of the as-evaporated Ni atoms. When methane (CH4) enters the reaction chamber, it is immediately converted to highly active atomic C and H. The adsorption of C atoms on Ni NPs results in the formation of a carbon shell, completing the formation of the core–shell Ni@C NPs. Throughout the experiment, the chamber pressure is maintained at 0.15 MPa. The superheating factor K was maintained at 3.94, where the applied voltage was 25 kV and the capacitance was 6 μF. The Ni wire was 0.4 mm in diameter and 80 mm in length. The pulse current density and the pulse discharge duration were 238 kA mm−2 and 2 μs, respectively.
Optimization of the catalyst for water splitting was performed by adjusting the composition of Ni to C to obtain the highest catalytic activity. For this purpose, the proportion of CH4/Ar in the synthesis chamber was tuned in the range of 0 to 20%. The obtained catalysts are referred to as Ni@C(0%), Ni@C(5%), Ni@C(10%), Ni@C(15%), and Ni@C(20%). The number inside the brackets represents the percentage of CH4 in the CH4/Ar mixture used during the synthesis step.
Electrode fabrication and electrochemical measurements
To prepare the catalyst ink, Nafion solution, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water were mixed at a volume ratio of 0.02/20/80/. Next, 5 mg of catalysts were dispersed in 1 ml of the mixture and ultrasonicated for one hour (Scheme S1, ESI†).
The measurements of the electrochemical performance of the catalysts were carried out using a three-electrode configuration with a rotating disc electrode. For this purpose, an RRDE-3A rotating ring-disk apparatus (ALS Co., Ltd, Japan) was used. A Hg/HgO electrode and a platinum wire were employed as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A glassy carbon (GC) electrode (0.071 cm2) covered with the synthesized catalyst served as the working electrode (WE). For this purpose, a 3 μL solution of the catalyst ink was coated on a GC electrode and dried in an ambient atmosphere to obtain a catalyst density of 0.63 mg cm−2. Polarization curves were recorded at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 for the OER and HER at a disk rotation speed of 1600 rpm. A low scan rate was chosen to minimize the capacitive current and ensure steady-state behavior on the electrode surface. The current density was calculated by normalizing the geometrical surface area of the electrode. All potentials are referenced to the scale of a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed at an amplitude of 0.01 V at different bias potentials in the range of −0.10 to 0.20 V. Impedance spectra were recorded in the frequency range of 105–0.01 Hz. The accuracy levels of the equipment used (Ivium Technologies Netherlands) for the CV, PV, EIS, and Tafel measurements are 0.2% for the applied potential and 0.2% for the measured current. The Ni@C catalyst electrode was prepared by coating the catalyst ink onto Ni foam (1 × 1 cm2). To remove the surface oxide layer, the Ni foam was cleaned with water, ethanol, and acetone under ultra-sonication for 15 min each. The Ni foam was then soaked in the catalyst ink and dried at an ambient temperature. This procedure was repeated ten times.
Fabrication of CIGS solar cells
In this work, Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin-film solar cells with the Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO: Al/Al-grid conventional structure were used. CIGS absorbers with the (Cu/(In + Ga) ∼ 0.88 and Ga/(In + Ga) ∼ 0.36) composition yielding a bandgap of approximately 1.2 eV were deposited by the co-evaporation of Cu, In, Ga, and Se elements through a three-stage process.54 A CdS buffer layer and a conventional ZnO bi-window layer were consequently deposited on the CIGS absorber. A CdS film with a thickness of 50 nm was grown by chemical bath deposition from a chemical bath (60 °C) containing CdSO4 (1.5 mM) as a Cd source, thiourea (150 mM) as a sulfur source, and NH3 (1.5 M) as a complexing agent. The window layer with the structure of an i-ZnO layer (50 nm) and an Al-doped ZnO layer (350 nm) was deposited by means of RF-magnetron sputtering. Finally, a 350 nm-thick Al grid was grown using an aperture by thermal evaporation. The detail processing of the CIGS solar cell is described in the literature.55
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out using a JEM-ARM200F device (Jeol Ltd, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The average size of the NPs was calculated using ImageJ software, and a minimum of 700 particles per sample was counted for statistics. To calculate the carbon-shell thickness, at least 50 particles with distinguishable shells were considered. Based on the observed deviation of the shell thickness, the shell thickness was assumed to have a linear dependence on the particle size. The average shell thickness was calculated from the average particle diameter. To investigate the chemical state of the Ni@C NPs, a K-Alpha spectrometer model from Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA) equipped with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.65 eV) X-ray radiation at a base pressure of 10−10 Torr was used. The data were fitted using Thermo Avantage software (Thermo Scientific). The fittings were performed by combining Shirley's and Tougaard's backgrounds.27 Fitting of the Ni2p peaks was carried out following two models: a simple 4-peak model for mixed compounds with a low Ni content56 and a 3-peak model for metallic Ni.57 Experimental values have precision limited to ±0.1 eV. Raman analysis was conducted using a LabRAM HR-800 (Horiba, Japan) with a 514 nm laser in a range of 1000–3500 cm−1. The accuracy of the Raman spectrometer is around 1 cm−1.
Measurements of nitrogen adsorption at 77 K using a BET surface area & porosimetry analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP2020, USA) were conducted to obtain the specific surface area, pore-volume, and pore size of the Ni@C NPs. The PV characteristics of the solar cells were measured under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 illumination. An ABET Technologies Sun 3000 solar simulator was used as the light source. The solar simulator was calibrated using the PECSI01 silicon reference cell calibrated by HS Technologies.
