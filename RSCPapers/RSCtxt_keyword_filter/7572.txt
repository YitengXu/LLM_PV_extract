    , Accepted 3rd September 2018First published on 3rd September 2018AbstractThree furan-fused BODIPYs were synthesized with perfluorinated methyl, ethyl and n-propyl groups on the meso-carbon. They were obtained with high yields by reacting the furan-fused 2-carboxylpyrrole in corresponding perfluorinated acid and anhydride. With the increase in perfluorinated alkyl chain length, the molecular packing in the single crystal is influenced, showing increasing stacking distance and decreasing slope angle. All the BODIPYs were characterized as intense absorbers in near infrared region in solid state, peaking at ∼800 nm with absorption coefficient of over 280000 cm−1. Facilitated by high thermal stability, the furan-fused BODIPYs were employed in vacuum-deposited organic solar cells as electron donors. All devices exhibit PCE over 6.0% with the EQE maximum reaching 70% at ∼790 nm. The chemical modification of the BODIPY donors have certain influence on the active layer morphology, and the highest PCE of 6.4% was obtained with a notably high jsc of 13.6 mA cm−2. Sensitive EQE and electroluminance studies indicated that the energy losses generated by the formation of a charge transfer state and the radiative recombination at the donor–acceptor interface were comparable in the range of 0.14–0.19 V, while non-radiative recombination energy loss of 0.38 V was the main energy loss route resulting in the moderate Voc of 0.76 V.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaic cells, converting solar radiation into electricity, are regarded as the most promising clean energy technology. Because of the capability for light absorption, inexpensiveness and flexibility, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention.1 Research on both material design and device optimization are focused mainly on the enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE);2,3 recently, values higher than 13% have been reported for both polymer and small molecule devices.4–6 Owing to solvent-free manufacturing process, vacuum-deposited OSCs have shown distinct advantages in preparing multi-junction devices consisting absorbers with a complementary photoactive region with respect to the solar spectrum.7,8 Moreover, the employed small molecules that have well-defined molecular structures can be purified by sublimation, and the thickness of the deposited layers can be controlled accurately by quartz crystal microbalance, which guarantees consistent device quality between batches.
Several classes of materials have been reported as efficient absorbers in vacuum-deposited OSCs, including metal-phthalocyanine,9 oligomer thiophene10,11 and molecules with donor–acceptor geometry.12,13 Most of these materials, however, have intense absorption only in the visible light region, leaving the relatively large energy flux in the near-infrared (NIR) region unused. Thus, NIR absorbers for vacuum-deposited OSCs are in demand, particularly for multi-junction devices.14 Recently, we have demonstrated that BODIPYs can be promising NIR electron donors;15 a serial connected tandem device constructed by a BODIPY (BDP-1 in this study) and an oligomer (thiophene) as NIR and green absorber, respectively, achieved a high PCE of 10%.16 Since the short-circuit current (jsc) of each subcell is the limiting factor of the overall jsc in this type of tandem OSCs, it is necessary and feasible to develop novel BODIPY NIR donors with decent jsc values. Moreover, due to the unavoidable energy loss in OSCs, the open-circuit (Voc) of NIR devices usually suffers from the absorbed low energy photons.17 Thus, the energy loss mechanism needs to be clarified to support further investigation.

j
sc is closely related to the active layer absorbance and morphology.18 Alkyl chain substituents have been employed to modify small molecule donors for better device performance.10,19,20 In this study, based on BDP-1, as shown in Scheme 1, with a trifluoromethyl group on the meso-C, two derivatives BDP-2 and BDP-3 with perfluorinated ethyl and n-propyl were synthesized. The extension of the alkyl substituent on the meso-C is intended to optimize the inter- and intra-molecular interaction of these donors in the mixture with C60 as the acceptor. Moreover, the application of perfluorinated alkyl substituents is expected to facilitate the sublimation behaviour of these materials. The best performance is obtained in the device of BDP-2 with a notably high jsc of 13.6 mA cm−2 for vacuum-deposited single junction device. Moreover, the energetic offset between excited electrons and the electron potential provided by the device can be quantified as follows: qVoc = Eopt − ΔECT − ΔErec(1)where q is the elementary charge, Eopt is the optical bandgap of the donor, ΔECT is the driving force for the charge separation at the donor–acceptor interface to form a charge transfer (CT) state and ΔErec is the free carrier recombination loss that can be further divided into radiative (qΔVr) and non-radiative (qΔVnr) recombination losses.21 Energy loss investigation indicates a low ΔECT of 0.14 eV and a typical ΔErec of 0.57 eV in the device of BDP-2, resulting in a decent Voc of 0.76 V for NIR OSCs with EQE peaking at ∼790 nm.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and single crystal structure
As shown in Scheme 1, the BODIPY precursors without BF2 moiety (preBDP-1/2/3) are obtained in good yields (over 50%) from the same starting material, 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4H-furo[3,2-b]pyrrole-5-carboxylic acid. The perfluorinated alkyl substituent on the meso-position is determined by the perfluorinated carboxyl acid and anhydride used in the dimerization reaction: trifluoroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic anhydride for preBDP-1, pentafluoropropionic acid and pentafluoropropionic anhydride for preBDP-2, and heptafluorobutyric acid and heptafluorobutyl anhydride for preBDP-3. A possible reaction mechanism is illustrated in Scheme S1 in the ESI.† The final BODIPYs are prepared according to the conventional method by reacting the precursors with boron trifluoride etherate in the presence of organic base.22 Then, they were isolated by column chromatography in high yields (over 60%). All the compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 19F NMR and ESI-MS. The reaction details and the characterizations can be found in ESI.†
Single crystal samples suitable for the X-ray diffraction measurements were obtained by slow diffusion of isohexane into DCM solution at room temperature. The molecular structures of all the BODIPYs are illustrated in Fig. 1(a), and the crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1 and S2 in ESI.† In spite of the rotatable single C–C bond, the peripheral 4-methoxyl phenyl moieties in all the molecules show good planarity with respect to the furan fused dipyrromethene core with dihedral angles less than 10°. For BDP-1 with a –CF3 group on the meso-C, boron is coordinated in a slightly disordered tetrahedral atmosphere with the two fluorine atoms located almost symmetrically along the molecular plane. However, in BDP-2(–C2F5) and BDP-3(–C3F7), the coordinating tetrahedral structures are more disordered, which is ascribed to the out-of-surface dipole angles caused by the extended –C2F5 and –C3F7 moieties. Furthermore, the packing behaviour is significantly affected by the different perfluorinated alkyl substituents, as shown in Fig. 1(b). All the molecules adopt a stair-case arrangement with the slope angle increasing from 14.8° in BDP-1 to 27.1° and 37.7° in BDP-2 and BDP-3, respectively, which indicates J-type aggregation.23 Furthermore, the distance between adjacent molecular planes is kept similar (∼3.5 Å). This effect is due to the increase in intramolecular interactions among the perfluorinated alkyl chains with the increase in length.

2.2 Photophysical and thermal properties
The absorption spectra of both the precursors and the BODIPYs are recorded in diluted DCM solution, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The precursors have featureless absorption bands ranging from 500 to 700 nm, with molar extinction coefficients of over 100000 L mol−1 cm−1 for preBDP-1 and preBDP-3 and over 40000 L mol−1 cm−1 for preBDP-2. The absorption maximum of preBDP-1 is around 630 nm, while the spectra of preBDP-2 and preBDP-3 are slightly red-shifted, with maxima located at ∼640 nm. After coordination with the BF2 moiety, the absorption peaks of the BODIPYs are significantly enhanced and red-shifted. All the three BODIPYs present similar absorption profiles, with an extremely intense main peak at around 724 nm and a moderate vibronic peak at 657 nm. The molar extinction coefficients of BDP-1 and BDP-2 have a similar value of around 330000 L mol−1 cm−1, while the value of BDP-3 is still as high as 296400 L mol−1 cm−1. The significant improvement in the extinction coefficients from the precursor to the BODIPYs can be attributed to the additional rigidity provided by the six-member coordination structure, induced by the boron center.22 Moreover, the red-shift of the absorption maxima can be explained by the decreased HOMO–LUMO band gap because of the electron deficiency of the BF2 moiety (Table 1).

The absorption of the BODIPYs in solid state was also investigated, and the spectra of vacuum-deposited 50 nm neat films on quartz substrate are shown in Fig. 2(b). As compared with solution spectra, the solid-state absorption spectra show significantly broadened peaks, covering a wide range from 550 to 900 nm. Moreover, the absorption maxima are red-shifted to 790 nm for BDP-1 and 780 nm for BDP-2 and BDP-3. The broadening effect can be attributed to the distribution of the energetic states in the amorphous films generated by the polarization in all directions, while the red-shifts are attributed to the J-type aggregation, as demonstrated in the single crystal packing behaviour.24 The absorption coefficients of all the BODIPYs are higher than 280000 cm−1 and particularly, that of BDP-2 reaches a notably high value of 345000 cm−1. This result demonstrates that these molecules are intense absorbers, and can harvest photons efficiently from deep red to near infrared region.
For small molecules used in vacuum-deposited OSCs, adequate thermal properties are required to guarantee purification by gradient sublimation. Thermogravimetric (TG) plots of the BODIPYs are illustrated in Fig. 2(c). All the compounds are stable when the temperature is below 270 °C. Taking a weight loss of 5% as the reference, the highest decomposition temperature is found for BDP-1 at 314 °C. With the increase in length of the perfluorinated alkyl chain, the decomposition temperature decreases gradually to 306 °C and 277 °C for BDP-2 and BDP-3, respectively. The melting point, indicated by the endothermic peak in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) plots of BDP-1 (Fig. 2(d)) is the lowest at 238 °C, and increases to 308 °C and 258 °C for BDP-2 and BDP-3, respectively. Such excellent thermal properties allow efficient purification by gradient sublimation under a low pressure of 10−8 mbar. Materials with high purity that can be used in organic electronic devices were obtained with reasonable yield (over 60%) at a temperature lower than 200 °C, which makes them promising NIR donor candidates in vacuum-deposited OSCs.
2.3 Energetic characterization by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations
In order to obtain the energy level of the frontier molecular orbitals, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The CV curves and the calculated HOMO/LUMO electron distribution plots are illustrated in Fig. 3(a)–(c). All the molecules present reversible redox peaks in both positive and negative regions. This indicates that the chemical stability of their cation/anion is good and readily reduced and oxidized back to the neutral form. Accordingly, the electron donor molecules in OSCs are continuously oxidized and reduced to provide photocurrent under illumination. Thus, these BODIPYs are favourable donors due to their high electrochemical stability, and long device lifetime can be expected. Using ferrocene and ferrocenium as internal references, we found that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are slightly influenced by the different perfluorinated alkyl substituents on the meso-position. BDP-1 and BDP-3 possess almost the same values of HOMO (−5.22/–5.23 eV) and LUMO (−3.76 eV), while the band gap of BDP-2 is the largest with HOMO of −5.25 eV and LUMO of −3.68 eV.

Theoretical calculations of HOMO and LUMO orbitals show that the electrons are delocalized over the entire molecule on both HOMO and LUMO for all the BODIPYs. This indicated the presence of highly overlapped π and π* orbitals, between which the electron transition take places, and the extremely high absorption intensity in both solution and thin film can be explained. Efficient electron delocalization is attributed to the good planar molecular structures that facilitate large conjugation systems over both dipyrromethene core and the peripheral 4-methoxyl phenyl moieties. However, it can be found that the perfluorinated alkyl chains have negligible contribution to neither HOMO nor LUMO, and this is the reason for the subtle energy level variation in different BODIPY molecules.
2.4 Photovoltaic properties and device physics investigations
Vacuum-deposited BHJ OSCs comprising the BODIPY donors and C60 acceptor were fabricated in a conventional n-i-p architecture: ITO/MH250:W2(hpp)4 (7 wt%, 5 nm)/C70 (15 nm)/donor:C60 (1:2, v/v)/BPAPF (5 nm)/BPAPF:NDP9 (10 wt%, 40 nm)/NDP9 (1 nm)/Al (100 nm).8 Tetrakis(1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidinato)ditungsten(II) (W2(hpp)4)-doped N,N-bis(fluoren-2-yl)-naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide (MH250) and NDP9-doped 9,9-bis[4-(N,N-bis-biphenyl-4-yl-amino)phenyl]-9H-fluorene (BPAPF) serve as electron and hole transporting layer (ETL/HTL), respectively. A neat layer of C70 was employed between the ETL and the BHJ as the hole blocking layer (HBL), which also contributes to photocurrent generation.16 Additional 1 nm layer of NDP9 between the Al anode and p-doped BPAPF serves as a hole extraction layer. The substrate temperature and the BHJ thickness were varied to optimize the photovoltaic parameters, as summarized in Table S3 in the ESI.† The best device structure has a BHJ of 50 nm, and the best substrate temperature is 100 °C for the device of BDP-1. The best device of BDP-2 and BDP-3 were obtained for the substrate treated at 110 °C.
The current density–voltage (j–V) curves and the EQE spectra of the optimized devices for each BODIPY are presented in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Their PV parameters are summarized in Table 2. Compared with the BPD-1 device, subtle but noteworthy PCE enhancement can be observed in device of BPD-2 and BPD-3 from 6.0% to 6.4% and 6.1%, respectively. A Voc of 0.72 V is obtained in the BDP-1 device, and it increases to 0.76 and 0.75 V for BDP-2 and BDP-3 devices. These are decent values for such NIR absorbers with high lying HOMO and ionized potential.15 Significant contribution to the EQE spectra from BODIPY donors can be found ranging from 600 to 900 nm with the maxima peaking at ∼790 nm. High peak values of ∼68% can be attributed to the intense absorption due to the very thin absorber layer (33.3% v/v of donor in 50 nm BHJ). Moreover, the transport and extraction of the free charge carriers are inferred to be efficient, and the charge accumulation on the interfaces is well-suppressed, which is also demonstrated by the high FF (over 0.60) in all the devices. In terms of jsc, as summarized in Table 2, all the three devices possess high values (over 13.5 mA cm−2) according to the experimental data. By integrating their EQE spectra with the solar spectrum, we calculated the jsc values of BDP-1 and BDP-2 to be around 14.2 mA cm−2, which is slightly higher than that of BDP-3. Such unusual high jsc values for small molecule vacuum-deposited OSCs can be attributed to intense absorption demonstrated by the device absorption spectra shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† However, although the devices BDP-2 and BDP-3 with longer alkyl substituents present even higher absorption, which can be attributed to decrease in crystallinity in their blends, their jsc values are comparable with that of BDP-1. It is inferred that the geminate recombination is more significant in the device of BDP-2 and BDP-3 than in BDP-1.

The free charge carrier recombination dynamics were investigated by light intensity dependent j–V characterization for the optimized devices, as illustrated in Fig. 4(c)/4(d). The dependence of jsc on light intensity is described as a power-law relationship by the following equation: (2)where q is the elementary charge, EQE(λ) and Φ(λ) are the EQE value and at solar spectra energy flux at certain wavelength, and Ilight is the incident light intensity.25–27 The nearly linear dependence of jsc as a function of Ilight in double-logarithmic scale indicates that charge carrier losses in the bulk are dominated by monomolecular recombination.28 The exponential factor α is close to 1 when the bimolecular recombination in the device is weak. For all the three OSCs, the calculated α is similar (∼1.00), which suggests that all the devices have similar and negligible bimolecular charge recombination. Moreover, the Voc of the OSCs exhibits a linear dependence on ln(Ilight), giving a slope of nkBTq−1, where kB is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the elementary charge and n is an ideality factor.29 The value of n represents the dominant recombination mechanism. If n is close to 1, bimolecular recombination dominates, while trap-assisted recombination is more significant if n is close to 2. These values range from 1.10 to 1.17 in the devices, suggesting that the interfacial trap density between donor and acceptor of all these devices are low. This can be attributed to the high material purity and good film quality deposited in high vacuum.
The active layer morphology is investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as illustrated in Fig. S4.† All the active layers have relatively smooth surface according to the AFM height images. The root-mean-square roughness (rms) of the BDP-1 blend is 1.29 nm, which decreases to 0.96 nm in the BDP-2 blend. The BDP-3 blend layer presents the highest level of roughness with an rms value of 1.86 nm. Moreover, distinct interpenetration pathways can be observed in BDP-2 and BDP-3 blend layers, with the domain size in the BDP-2 blend larger than that in the BDP-3 blend. Such patterns cannot be observed in the BDP-1 blend layer, indicating fine mixing between donor and acceptor.
To quantify the energy loss, which is defined as the difference between Eopt and qVoc, Eopt and the energy level of the CT state (ECT) were quantified using both highly sensitive EQE (sEQE) and electroluminescence (EL) spectral measurements on full OSC.30,31 The EL spectrum was measured at the lowest possible applied voltage; increasing the voltage did not result in a spectral shift. In Fig. 5(a), no clear shoulder peaks of the sEQE spectra, which are identified with a CT state absorption, can be observed. This indicates that ECT and Eopt of BODIPY, which has a lower optical gap than the acceptor C60, are close-lying energetically. Owing to close Voc values and almost identical sEQE spectra of all the three devices, it is inferred that Eopt and ECT are similar in all the three devices, and the devices possess comparable energy loss mechanisms. Thus, the study of energy loss was performed in the best performing device of BDP-2.

As shown in Fig. 5(b), the optical band gap Eopt was first estimated by the Gaussian fit in the high energy regions of the EL and sEQE spectra by the following equations:32 (3) (4)
In these equations, kB is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and E is photon energy. The fit parameters include Eopt, λ (reorganization energy) and f (related to the density of donor's first excited states and their coupling matrix with the ground state). Due to the multiplication and division of the spectrum by photon energy E, the spectrum used in eqn (3) and (4) are referred to as reduced absorption and emission spectrum. The fitted curves were plotted as red and black dash lines for EL and sEQE spectrum, respectively. The values of Eopt obtained by the fitting of EL and sEQE spectra coincide with their crossing point of 1.47 eV. The CT state energy ECT was further estimated by fitting of EL and sEQE spectrum as red and black dot lines, respectively, in Fig. 5(b) using the same Gaussian fit equation:32 (5) (6)where ECT is a fitting parameter. An ECT value of 1.33 eV is obtained. Thus, a low driving force ΔECT of 0.14 eV is demonstrated and is already available for efficient charge separation. Such a small energy offset between Eopt and ECT is the reason for the absence of the shoulder absorption peak in the sEQE spectra in the low energy region. A CT state can decay back to the ground state or dissociate into fully free charge carriers. If the charge carriers on a CT state would only recombine radiatively, the Voc would reach its upper limit known as Vr, which can be calculated as follows:21 (7)where jsc is obtained by integrating the product of the sEQE spectrum and the solar AM1.5G spectrum, and jr0 is the radiative limit of the dark current, which is obtained by integrating the product of sEQE spectrum and black body spectrum at room temperature.32 Herein, Vr was calculated as 1.14 V, and the energy loss generated by the radiative recombination qΔVr was calculated as 0.19 eV using the following equation: qΔVr = ECT − qVr(8)
However, the experimentally measured Voc is lower as a result of energy loss due to unavoidable non-radiative recombination, which is usually the main energy loss factor. ΔVnr can be determined experimentally by the EL quantum yield EQEEL as follows:21 (9)ΔVnr was calculated to be 0.38 V. This value is in line with the values for most of the organic blends suffering non-radiative recombination losses from 0.3 to 0.4 V, as reported in literature.33 The overall energy loss scheme is shown in Fig. 5(c) with every factor quantitated with experimental data. Although the moderate Voc of 0.76 V results from non-radiative recombination voltage loss of 0.38 V, the fact that the rather high peak EQEs close to 70% can be achieved with a driving force of only 0.14 eV is encouraging.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, three furan-fused BODIPY NIR absorbers have been synthesized with increasing perfluorinated alkyl chain substituents on the meso-C. By using different combinations of perfluorinated acid and the corresponding anhydride, the meso-substituent can be extended from trifluoromethyl to perfluorinated ethyl and n-propyl. Single crystal structures reveal that all the three molecules adopt a planar structure, but their packing behavior is significantly influenced by the meso-substituents with different perfluorinated alkyl chain length. The slope angle between adjacent molecules increases along with the increase in meso substitution, while the perpendicular distance between the two molecules remains constant. Owing to the intense absorbance, excellent thermal stability, as well as appropriate HOMO/LUMO energy levels, all these BODIPYs were fabricated in vacuum-deposited BHJ OSCs with C60 as the electron acceptor. With the EQE maxima at ∼790 nm and on-set at ∼900 nm, all the BODIPYs are demonstrated as efficient NIR small molecule donors with PCEs over 6.0%. Due to the favourable morphology of the BDP-2 blend layer, a high jsc of 13.6 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.64 and a PCE of 6.4% were obtained with a reasonable Voc of 0.76 V. Detailed energy loss mechanism was quantified based on the device of BDP-2, indicating that the main voltage drop stems from non-radiative recombination at ∼0.38 V, which is a typical value for OPV material blends. The other part includes radiative recombination, leading to energy loss of ∼0.19 V and a rather low charge separation loss of ∼0.14 V. This study again demonstrates that BODIPY molecules can be promising NIR electron donor materials with high jsc, and decent PCE can be expected in vacuum-deposited tandem devices incorporation with such materials.
4. Experimental
4.1 Cryptography
A suitable crystal was selected and mounted on a glass fibre with two-component glue on a Bruker SMART APEX2 area detector diffractometer. The crystal was kept at T = 100 K during data collection. Using Olex2 (Dolomanov et al., 2009), the structure was solved with the ShelXT (Sheldrick, 2015) structure solution program, using the Direct Methods-based solution method. The model was refined with version 2013-4 of ShelXL (Sheldrick, 2008) using least squares minimization. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were generated by their idealized geometry and refined within a riding model.
4.2 Photophysical, thermal and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra in solution were recorded on a Perkin Elmer λ 25 spectrometer at room temperature. All the solution samples had a concentration of 1 × 10−5 mol L−1. The absorption spectra in solid state were recorded on a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. All the vacuum-deposited neat film samples have a thickness of 50 nm on quartz substrate. An integrating sphere was used to measure the reflection (R) and the transmission (T) of the film, and the absorption (A) was calculated as A = 1 − R − T.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted using a Metrohm μ-Autolab instrument in a single component cell under nitrogen atmosphere. A conventional three-electrode system was built with a platinum disk working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (silver rod coated by AgCl electrochemically). The DCM solutions of all the compounds had a concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1 with 0.1 mol L−1 tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) as a supporting electrolyte.
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a Netzsch STA 449C instrument and differential scanning calorimetry was performed on a DSC 1 from Mettler Toledo. All the measurements were recorded under nitrogen flow of 30 mL min−1 with a ramp rate of 5 K min−1 in ceramic crucibles.
4.3 Theoretical calculations
Both density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were performed using Gaussian09 software. The initial molecular geometry was created from experimental data from the single crystal X-ray diffraction. The geometry optimization was performed first at a B3LPY/6-31G (d, p) level. Solvent effect was taken into consideration using C-PCM solvent model in DCM. On the basis of the optimized geometry, vertical transition properties were simulated by TD-DFT calculations at the M062x/6-31G (d, p) level with the solvent effect simulation in DCM using C-PCM model.
4.4 Device fabrication and characterizations
Organic solar cells were fabricated on pre-structured indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (26 Ω sq−1, 84% transparency, Thin Film Devices, USA). Four individual devices were deposited on a single sample with an active area of 6.44 mm2 each, and a reflecting back contact was deposited through patterned shadow masks. Physical vapor deposition was performed in high-vacuum chambers (K. J. Lesker, UK, p ≤ 10−7 mbar) at a deposition rate of ∼0.4 Å s−1. The substrate was heated during the deposition by four 50 W halogen lamps over the substrate, and the temperature was monitored with an uncertainty of ±5 K. The freshly fabricated devices were transferred in nitrogen atmosphere into the glovebox for the glass–glass encapsulation. The glass cover was fixed by UV hardened epoxy glue and a moisture getter (Dynic Ltd., China) was inserted between the glass cover and the deposited layers.
The EQE spectrum was measured for each device under monochromatic illumination from a Xe lamp (oriel Xe Arch-lamp Apex, Newport, USA) modulated by a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 1/4m, Newport, USA) and an optical wheel chopper. The generated photocurrent was amplified by a lock-in amplifier (SR 7265, Signal Recovery, USA). All the EQE measurements were conducted with an aperture mask of 2.78 mm2 and without bias illumination. A calibrated Si reference photodiode (Hamamatsu S1337, JP) with known spectral response was used to obtain the spectral response of a test cell.
The illuminated j–V characteristics were recorded under illumination from a sun simulator (16S-003-300-AM1.5, Solar Light Co., USA). A Hamamatsu S1337-33BQ Si photodiode was used to monitor the intensity. Electrical measurements were performed using a CAS 140 CT spectrometer. The illumination intensity for each device was recalculated according to the mismatch factors determined from the EQE measurements and the spectrum of the sun simulator.
The theoretically estimated jsc values were obtained by integrating the EQE spectra with the AM1.5G solar spectra according to the following equation: jsc = q∫EQE(λ)AM1.5G(λ)dλ(10)
4.5 Sensitive EQE and EL measurements
For the PV-sensitive EQE measurements, the light of a quartz halogen lamp (50 W) was chopped at 140 Hz and coupled into a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260 1/4m, USA). The resulting monochromatic light was focused onto the OSC, and its current at short-circuit conditions was fed to a current pre-amplifier before the current was analysed with a lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery 7280 DSP, USA). The time constant of the lock-in amplifier was chosen to be 0.5 s and the amplification of the pre-amplifier was increased to resolve low photocurrents. PV EQE was determined by dividing the photocurrent of the OSC by the flux of incoming photons, which was obtained with a calibrated Si and InGaAs photodiode.
Electroluminescence measurements were obtained using an Andor SR303i-B spectrometer equipped with a cooled Si and cooled InGaAs detector array (DU420A-BR-DD and DU491A-1.7, UK). The spectral response of the setup was calibrated with a reference lamp (Oriel 63355). The emission spectrum of the OSCs was recorded at different injection currents with respect to voltages, which were lower than or at least similar to Voc of the device at 1 sun illumination. Driving power was supplied by a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter.
