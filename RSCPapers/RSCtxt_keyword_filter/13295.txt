    , Accepted 14th September 2017First published on 15th September 2017AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have been widely studied because of their potential importance in industry. A variety of luminescent materials have been developed and used for LSC fabrication such as organic dyes and semiconductor quantum dots. However, fabricating LSCs with a cost-effective method and environmentally friendly materials is a great challenge. Here, N-doped carbon-dots (N-CDs) are for the first time reported to be used as phosphors for LSC fabrication. The properties of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with various thicknesses are investigated. When the N-CDs/PMMA thin film thickness is 6.67 μm and only one side of LSCs is covered by photovoltaic cells, the performance of the LSCs is optimal, and the values of Voc, Jsc, FF, ηopt and η can reach up to 0.46 V, 13.68 mA cm−2, 62.89%, 4.75% and 3.94%, respectively. Moreover, the photostability of the LSCs is excellent. Results show that N-CDs are able to be effective luminophores for LSC fabrication. Our technique makes the industrial applications of LSCs more feasible since N-CDs have advantages such as high stability, low cost, low toxicity and high photoluminescence quantum yield.
1. Introduction
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are devices that collect sunlight through absorption of incident photons by luminophores and then re-emit them into a waveguide directing the photons onto photovoltaic cells mounted on substrate edges.1–3 The advantages of LSCs are striking, e.g., no tracking or cooling is required and only a small side area needs to be covered by expensive photovoltaic cells.4 Thus, LSCs have attracted extensive research interest since they can realize semi-transparent photovoltaic windows.5–7
There are a variety of luminescent materials used for LSC fabrication including organic dyes,8–10 metal oxides,11 and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs).12–14 However, organic dyes have inherent problems such as narrow absorption bands and rapid photobleaching.15,16 Although semiconductor QDs can be effectively used in LSC technology due to their advantages such as widely tunable absorption spectra, photostability and high photoluminescence quantum yield,12,17–20 shortcomings such as the high toxicity and cost of traditional semiconductor QDs using heavy metals as elements greatly limit their industrial applications.21 Therefore, it is a great challenge to fabricate LSCs with a cost-effective method and environmentally friendly materials which is an important point for practical uses.
Carbon-dots (CDs) discovered in 2004 (ref. 22) have many unique strengths such as high stability, easy fabrication, low cost and low toxicity compared to QDs.17,23 So they have been widely used in many different areas including biosensors, bioimaging, and photocatalysis.24,25 It has been reported that the band gap and electronic density of CDs can be well tuned to improve the quantum yield by chemical heteroatom doping.26 Among a variety of chemical heteroatom doping techniques, N-doping of CDs (N-CDs) is the most popular way to improve the properties of CDs such as high photoluminescence quantum yield.27,28 The high photoluminescence quantum yield properties of N-CDs make them a very promising candidate for LSC fabrication.
So far, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on CDs used as luminophores for the fabrication of LSCs. In this study, we present the first report that N-CDs can be employed to fabricate LSCs. Results show that N-CDs are able to be effective luminophores for LSC fabrication. Our technique makes the industrial applications of LSCs more feasible which presents potential applications in our daily life.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
In the present study, citric acid, urea, and methyl methacrylate (MMA) (purity ≥ 99.0%; supplied by Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd., China), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (purity ≥ 99.0%; supplied by Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd., China), ethanol (C2H6O) (purity ≥ 99.7%; supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) were used as received. Microscopy slides (float glass; supplied by Citotest Labware Manufacturing Co., Ltd., China) were used as substrates.
2.2 Preparation of N-CDs
First, 3.0 g of citric acid and 2.0 g of urea were dissolved in 10 mL pure water and a transparent solution was obtained. Next, it was heated in a microwave oven (800 W) for about 5 min. The color of the solution changed to brown and finally a clustered solid was formed. The carbon nanodots were then transferred to a vacuum oven and heated at 50 °C in order to remove any residual small molecules. The aqueous solution of carbon nanodots could be purified after filtration with a cylinder filtration membrane filter (0.22 μm).
2.3 Preparation of N-CDs/PMMA thin-film LSCs with various thicknesses
Microscopy slides, used as substrates, were cut into dimensions 2.5 × 1.6 × 0.1 cm3 and polished around the edges, and then cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water by ultrasonic cleaning for 30 minutes, respectively. A blend of 25 mL of MMA monomer with 2.62 g of PMMA polymer (PMMA and MMA, 1:9, 10 wt%) was heated to 60 °C on a magnetic stirrer until the PMMA granules were dissolved completely. The blend was stirred vigorously for 1 h. N-CDs (0.1 wt%, 0.3 wt%, and 0.5 wt%) dispersed in 1 mL ethanol were added to 8 mL of the blend of MMA and PMMA and the mixtures were stirred for 5 minutes (60 °C) to form a homogeneous N-CDs/polymer slurry of appropriate viscosity, respectively. These N-CDs/polymer mixtures were then spin-coated on glass substrates at 3000 rpm respectively, which turned into highly uniform and transparent thin films after evaporation of ethanol. To gain different thin film thicknesses, spin-coating with various times was employed. A prepolymer thin film (PMMA and MMA, 1:9, 10 wt%) was coated on the top, which was used as a protecting and spacing film for the thin film. The thin film and the prepolymer film were dried at 60 °C for 2 h in a drying oven. These N-CDs/PMMA thin-film LSCs (with an active area of 4 cm2) were then coupled with a monocrystalline silicon solar cell (with an active area of 0.16 cm2) for subsequent testing.
2.4 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted using a JEM-1010 TEM (JEOL, Japan). The morphology of the N-CDs/PMMA thin-film was observed with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, HITACHI, Japan). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV2600, Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (QM/TM/NIR, Photon Technology International Corp., USA) at an excitation wavelength ranging from 370 nm to 530 nm and a scan speed of 600 nm min−1. The photovoltaic properties of the N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with various thicknesses were obtained with a solar simulator (IV4112, Newport Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun). The active illuminated area of all the thin-film LSCs was 2.5 cm × 1.6 cm.
3. Results and discussion
The N-CDs were prepared according to the experimental procedure described in the Experimental. The TEM technique was employed to obtain the information about the size and shape of the N-CDs. A drop of N-CD solution was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid followed by drying in air, which was then used for TEM characterization. As shown in Fig. 1a, it can be observed that the N-CDs had spherical shapes which exhibited a narrow size distribution with an average size of around 2.8 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 1b). Also, most of the N-CDs possess a nearly spherical shape, which are well dispersed without apparent aggregation. These N-CDs with different weight percentages in polymer solutions were subsequently used and spin-coated on glass substrates to form N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs in the following experiments.

The UV absorbance spectrum of N-CDs dispersed in ethanol is shown in Fig. 2a. It showed that N-CDs had a broad absorption band in the range of 300–600 nm and a maximum intensity at around 350 nm. Fig. 2b shows fluorescence emission spectra excited by light with different wavelengths. The results revealed that the peaks of the as-prepared N-CDs dispersed in ethanol shifted from 500 nm to 562 nm when the excitation wavelength changed from 380 nm to 530 nm. The fluorescence emission of the as-prepared N-CDs dispersed in ethanol first increased, and then decreased with the increase of the excitation wavelength. The maximum fluorescence emission of the as-prepared N-CDs dispersed in ethanol appeared at 546 nm under 490 nm excitation. The fluorescence behavior depending on excitation is supposed to be attributed to the distribution of different emissive sites.24

It was reported that in order to obtain optimal results a high concentration of luminophores is required since intermolecular energy-transfer efficiency is a very important limiting factor.29 However, higher concentrations will result in larger losses which are caused by self-absorption and possibility of luminophore aggregations.30 Therefore, an appropriate concentration of N-CDs (0.3 wt%) was first chosen to study. LSC devices were constructed by spin casting a blend of MMA and PMMA containing 0.3 wt% N-CDs on top of a square piece of glass slide. We prepared N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSC samples with different thin film thicknesses controlled by spin-coating times. The cross-sectional FESEM images of these N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSC samples with various thicknesses are shown in Fig. 3. According to Fig. 3, the blank sample thickness was 0.41 ± 0.02 μm. The thicknesses of the different samples were 0.96 ± 0.05 μm, 3.73 ± 0.08 μm, 5.38 ± 0.07 μm, 5.56 ± 0.03 μm, 6.67 ± 0.06 μm, 7.76 ± 0.07 μm, and 8.03 ± 0.05 μm measured from SEM cross-sectional images, respectively.

The UV absorbance spectra of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSC samples with different thin film thicknesses are shown in Fig. 4a. It shows that there was a small adsorption at 381 nm. And the absorbance intensity increased with the film thickness which might be attributed to the fact that more N-CDs are contained in the thicker N-CDs/PMMA film. Fig. 4b shows the corresponding optical transmittance spectra of Fig. 4a which indicates that the visible light transmittance of LSCs with different thin film thicknesses is excellent: for the blank sample, the visible light transmittance could reach 90%; and the visible light transmittance could remain above 75% even when the film thickness reached 6.67 μm which means that our fabricated LSCs can realize semi-transparent photovoltaic windows.

Fluorescence emission spectra of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with different thicknesses excited by light with different wavelengths were investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, the peaks of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with different thicknesses all shifted from 420 nm to 600 nm when the excitation wavelength changed from 370 nm to 530 nm. The maximum fluorescence emission of the N-CDs/PMMA thin films with different thicknesses all appeared at 420 nm under 370 nm excitation.

Fig. 6a and b show photoluminescence spectra of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with different thicknesses under 370 nm and 470 nm excitation, respectively. The results clearly showed that the intensity greatly increased with the N-CDs/PMMA thin film thickness first, and then gradually decreased, which should be attributed to the fact that more N-CDs are contained in the thicker N-CDs/PMMA film. The maximum intensity appeared when the film thickness was 6.67 μm. Fig. 6c is a schematic illustration of the LSC made of a polymer matrix comprising N-CDs. It should be noted that only one side of the LSC is covered by photovoltaic cells during J–V measurement in our case.

(c) Schematic illustration of the LSC made of a polymer matrix comprising N-CDs: light incident onto the face of the thin film LSC is absorbed by N-CDs and re-emitted at a longer wavelength randomly. Because of a higher refractive index of the plate than that of air, most of the emitted photons are trapped inside the plate by total internal reflection and guided to the edges. Note: in our case, only one side of the LSC is covered by photovoltaic cells. 
The J–V characteristic curves of the N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSC samples with different thicknesses and monocrystalline silicon solar cells are shown in Fig. 7. The results indicated that the photocurrent density obviously increased with the film thickness at the same voltage until the film thickness reached 6.67 μm. Then, the photocurrent density slightly decreased with the film thickness.

The evaluation of the performance of the LSC devices studied in this work was carried out by testing them under AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 and by considering the following parameters.20,31
The most evident feature of a LSC is its geometric gain G, a ratio of the top surface area (Atop) relative to the edge surface area (Aedge) of the LSC, which is dependent on the dimensions of the LSC. G = Atop/Aedge(1)
The optical conversion efficiency is the ratio of the power coming out of the edge of the LSC (Pout) relative to the power coming in (Pin) through the top surface. ηopt = Pout/Pin(2)
When characterizing an LSC with PV cells attached, ηopt can be simply defined as (3)where ILSC is the short circuit current from a cell attached to the thin-film LSC and Isc is the short circuit current measured for the same solar cell under direct illumination with the same light source.
The effective concentration factor C is, therefore, a measure of the optical efficiency ηopt of a LSC of a given geometric gain G. C = G × ηopt(4)
Another metric also used to define the performance of an LSC is the overall power conversion efficiency η defined as η = Jsc × Voc × FF(5)where Jsc is the short circuit current density, Voc is the open circuit voltage, and FF is the fill factor. The values of Jsc, Voc, and FF were obtained from the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves.
The photovoltaic parameters such as Voc, Jsc, fill factor, G, and ηopt are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the values of Jsc, ηopt, and η first increased with the thickness of N-CDs/PMMA thin films and then decreased.32 The values of Voc, Jsc, FF, ηopt and η could reach up to 0.46 V, 13.68 mA cm−2, 62.89%, 4.75% and 3.94%, respectively, for the N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSC with a thickness of 6.67 μm. More importantly, the overall power conversion efficiency η of the LSC increased from 1.34% for the pure PMMA thin film LSC to 3.94% for the N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSC with a thickness of 6.67 μm. The performance enhancement is mainly due to the addition of N-CDs which absorb light with a short wavelength and emit light with a long wavelength that is more sensitive for the monocrystalline silicon solar cell.33

Meinardi et al.5 obtained freestanding and colourless slabs which were suitable for the realization of photovoltaic windows by incorporating CuInSexS2−x quantum dots into photo-polymerized poly(lauryl methacrylate). They achieved an optical power efficiency (ηopt) of 3.2%. Waldron et al.34 used PbSe quantum dots to prepare a LSC with a power conversion efficiency of 4.74%, which is also the highest known broadband overall power conversion efficiency of any system using QDs as the luminophores by calculation or measurement. Compared to the above results, although only one side of the LSC is covered by photovoltaic cells during measurement in our case, our LSCs still can achieve an optical power efficiency of 4.75% and a power conversion efficiency of 3.94% which is close to their results. Thus, our results have demonstrated that N-CDs are able to be effective luminophores for LSC fabrication.
We also performed the photostability test of N-CDs/PMMA films. As shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† the photoluminescence (PL) intensity and power conversion efficiency of the sample only slightly decreased after the sample was exposed to sunlight for 4 months which means that the photostability of the LSCs is excellent.
Finally, in order to optimize the doping rate of N-CDs in PMMA films, two additional concentrations of N-CDs (0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt%) were investigated in our experiments. According to the results (Fig. S3–S5 and Table S1†), when the concentration of N-CDs was 0.1 wt%, the influence of film thickness on the photoluminescence (PL) intensity was similar to the above results, while the influence of film thickness on the power conversion efficiency of LSCs containing 0.1 wt% N-CDs was small, and the power conversion efficiency only slightly increased with the film thickness. Once the concentration of N-CDs was 0.5 wt%, the performance of LSCs (Fig. S6–S8 and Table S2†) was quite similar to that of LSCs containing 0.3 wt% N-CDs. All results reveal that the power conversion efficiency could be maximum when the concentration of N-CDs is 0.3 wt% and the film thickness is 6.67 μm.
4. Conclusion
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) have been widely studied because of their potential importance in industry. Since N-CDs have many unique strengths such as high stability, low cost, low toxicity and high photoluminescence quantum yield, they are able to be promising candidates for LSCs. Here we for the first time reported that N-CDs could be used as phosphors for LSC fabrication. The properties of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with various thicknesses were investigated and the results showed that N-doped carbon-dots could be successfully employed as effective luminophores for LSC fabrication. Moreover, our results revealed that the power conversion efficiency first increased with the N-CDs/PMMA thin film thickness and then decreased. When the N-CDs/PMMA thin-film LSC thickness is 6.67 μm, the performance of the LSCs is optimal, and the values of Voc, Jsc, FF, ηopt and η can reach up to 0.46 V, 13.68 mA cm−2, 62.89%, 4.75% and 3.94%, respectively. Moreover, the photostability of the LSCs is excellent. We hope that our technique would make the industrial applications of LSCs more feasible.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Typical TEM image of N-CDs. (b) The diameter distribution of N-CDs.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) UV-vis spectrum of N-CDs in ethanol. (b) Photoluminescence spectra of N-CDs dispersed in ethanol excited by light with different wavelengths.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a–h) SEM cross-sectional images of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with different thicknesses (0.3 wt% N-CDs).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Absorption spectra and (b) transmittance spectra of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with different thicknesses (0.3 wt% N-CDs).	 

 	Fig. 5  Photoluminescence spectrum of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with different thicknesses (0.3 wt% N-CDs).	 

 	Fig. 6  Photoluminescence spectra of N-CDs/PMMA thin film LSCs with different thicknesses (0.3 wt% N-CDs) under 370 nm (a) and 470 nm (b) excitation. (c) Schematic illustration of the LSC made of a polymer matrix comprising N-CDs: light incident onto the face of the thin film LSC is absorbed by N-CDs and re-emitted at a longer wavelength randomly. Because of a higher refractive index of the plate than that of air, most of the emitted photons are trapped inside the plate by total internal reflection and guided to the edges. Note: in our case, only one side of the LSC is covered by photovoltaic cells.
