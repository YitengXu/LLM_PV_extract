    , Accepted 9th November 2019First published on 11th November 2019AbstractTo understand the light enhanced moisture degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) material, we carry out a series of first principles calculations and find the decisive role played by the giant photostriction effect. The photostriction effect in MAPbI3 material changes the charge distribution and thus the bonding interactions between atoms. This effect enhances the adsorption and penetration of H2O molecules nearby the MAPbI3 surface after the above band gap illumination, which is ascribed to the alternation of bonding interactions between MA molecules, H2O molecules and PbI networks. Owing to the straightening of the PbI networks induced by the photostriction effect, the band gap of MAPbI3 decreases, leading to more photon absorption and thus self-accelerated photostriction processes. Hence the photostriction effect could accelerate the moisture decomposition of MAPbI3 perovskite under illumination. Therefore, to develop perovskite solar cells with strong moisture resistance, an effective strategy is to develop perovskite materials with no or a minor photostriction effect.
Introduction
There have been intensive investigations on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in recent years because the power conversion efficiency of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) solar cells has been increased from 3.8% to 22.1% in five years.1,2 The hybrid organic–inorganic nature of PSCs results in low cost, simple fabrication and high efficiency; hence it is considered as one of the most promising solar cell materials. However, the practical application of MAPbI3 is limited due to the poor stability. When MAPbI3 is exposed to moisture, oxygen, thermal and sunlight, it degrades easily.3–9 Numerous studies have been performed on the degradation of perovskite solar cells, particularly regarding the role of water molecules. In the moisture environment, the dark brown MAPbI3 perovskite undergoes rapid decomposition to its precursor components, resulting in a significant decline of the device performance.10–13 Lots of reports assumed that the moisture induced decomposition is the dominant factor to worsen the stability of MAPbI3 devices under ambient conditions.14 Nevertheless, the decomposition also arises under continuous light irradiation; Qi et al. discussed the I2 vapor induced degradation in iodide-based perovskites under light illumination,15 and some other researchers reported the oxygen induced degradation under sunlight.5,7,14
More surprisingly, when MAPbI3 material is subjected to sunlight irradiation in a moist environment, it degrades much more quickly than it does in the dark. That is, the light irradiation and the moisture play dual synergistic roles in the decomposition of MAPbI3 material.11,14,16 We call this phenomenon the light enhanced moisture degradation effect. This effect is critical because sunlight and moisture are inevitable in the working environment of solar cells. However, very little is known about the mechanism accounting for this phenomenon. Coincidentally, Zhou et al. found the giant photostriction in MAPbI3 and other perovskites,17–20e.g., light-induced lattice expansion of >1200 ppm for MAPbI3. Under sunlight irradiation and above gap absorption, the photo-generated carriers transfer between different atoms and thus change the electron distribution throughout the whole lattice.21 This weakens the Coulomb interactions between the organic group and the inorganic framework11 and thus changes the lattice parameters of MAPbI3 accordingly. As is well known, the geometric structure of a material determines its external performance. Therefore, it is a rational assumption that this giant photostriction effect may play a key role in the exceptional light enhanced moisture decomposition, but little investigation has been done on this. In previous investigations, ab initio simulations provide deep and precise insight into the activity of water molecules in MAPbI3.22–28 So in this study, we carry out a series of well-designed DFT simulations to study the behaviors of the water molecules nearby the surface of MAPbI3 after light-induced dilation.29,30 Finally, we reveal the relationship between the light enhanced moisture decomposition and the photostriction effect in MAPbI3 material, which leads us to develop effective strategies to improve the stability of PSCs.
Simulation and calculation details
We use the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP) to perform the density functional theory calculations.31,32 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional parameterized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) method is employed to describe the electron–electron exchange and correlation effects.33 van der Waals forces are considered using the optb88-vdW functional for the weak interactions between water molecules, PbI6 octahedra and MA molecules.34 The PAW method35 with a cutoff energy of 400 eV is used to expand the electronic wave functions. The SCF energy and the residual force are 10−4 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. Monkhorst–Pack meshes of 3 × 3 × 3 and 2 × 2 × 1 are used to integrate the first Brillouin zone for the bulk crystal and surface slabs, respectively. A vacuum layer of 15 Å is added during the construction of the surface slab to eliminate the interactions between periodic images. The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method is adopted to determine the minimum energy migration pathway of water molecules nearby the surfaces.
Results and discussion
In our previous studies, we show that MAPbI3 perovskite crystallizes in the tetragonal phase.36 The bonding interactions between inorganic and organic constituents give rise to the obvious fittings of PbI6 octahedra and the out-of-plane rotations of MA molecules, which are illustrated by the buckling of the Pb–I–Pb angle. We name this normal configuration as phase α in this study and plot it in Fig. 1(a). In the optimized tetragonal MAPbI3 lattice, the Pb–I bond lengths, the (CH3)–I bond lengths, (NH3)–I bond lengths, and the Pb–I–Pb angles are 3.14–3.21 Å, 3.10–3.23 Å, 2.67–3.08 Å and 150.29–152.63°, respectively. From Fig. 2 we can see that the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) of MAPbI3 are predominantly produced by the anti-bonding states between Pb-6p and I-5s orbitals and between Pb-6s and I-5p orbitals, respectively. The MA molecules contribute little to the band gap directly; however, they affect the electronic structures indirectly via changing the inorganic PbI frameworks. When MAPbI3 is illuminated by the above-band-gap light, electrons transit from the VBM to CBM, i.e., charges transfer mainly from the hybridized I-5p orbitals to the Pb-6p orbitals. The free carriers transfer between atoms, beneficial for MAPbI3 to separate the photo-generated carrier. However, the interatomic charge transfer also results in the reduction of the electron density around I atoms. As mentioned above, the buckling of PbI6 octahedron originates from the bonding interaction between I atoms and MA molecules. Hence with the decrease of charge density around I atoms, both I–MA bonding interaction and thus the buckling of PbI inorganic networks decrease. The straightening of PbI networks gives birth to the lattice expansion and is responsible for the observed giant photostriction of MAPbI3.18–21,29,30,37,38 The geometric change induced by the photostriction will certainly alter the physical properties of MAPbI3, such as electronic properties and the surface properties and thus affect the moisture decomposition accordingly, which will be discussed below elaborately.

The moisture decomposition of MAPbI3 material is predominantly determined by the role of water molecules, including their adsorption, penetration and the dissociation of the bonding interior. Previous reports show that surfaces of MAPbI3 adsorb water molecules easily. When the adsorbed water molecules penetrate into the interior of the bulk, the bonding interactions between organic and inorganic parts are easy to be destroyed by the invasive water molecules.25,39–41 So the adsorption and penetration of water molecules are both critical accounting for the moisture decomposition or moisture resistance of perovskites. In respect of the adsorption behaviors, we put water molecules on three adsorption positions (marked I, II and III) on the MAPbI3 surface and calculate the corresponding adsorption energies. As plotted in Fig. 3, position I just lies above the hollow site surrounded by the Pb–I square. Position II is located near a corner of the Pb–I square with two hydrogen atoms in the H2O molecule pointing downward. Position III is also near a corner of the Pb–I square, but with the H2O molecule parallel to the PbI surface. In the normal α phase of MAPbI3, i.e., no photostriction, owing to all negative adsorption energies in Table 1, we confirm that all configurations can adsorb H2O molecules spontaneously. More interestingly, no matter where the initial position of the H2O molecule is, and no matter if the H2O molecule is parallel or perpendicular to the surface, the relaxed H2O molecule in each configuration always moves to the corner of the Pb–I square. The O atom of the H2O molecule bonds with the Pb atom at the corner, and H atoms bond with I atoms nearest to the corner Pb atom. Thus the adsorbed H2O molecule is parallel to the PbI networks in MAPbI3.

After the adsorption of the water molecule on the surface of MAPbI3 perovskite, the transfer of the H2O molecule above the surface into the interior is also crucial for the moisture decomposition. We put a H2O molecule into the cage below the outmost PbI layer to represent the configuration after penetration, as illustrated in Fig. 3(d). Using the adsorbed and penetrated configurations as the initial and final models, respectively, we perform CI-NEB calculations and get the migration energy barrier for the penetration of the H2O molecule in phase α. The H2O molecule encounters a maximized energy barrier of ∼0.39 eV in the most stable PbI-T (PbI network terminated) surface of MAPbI3 during the penetration process.42 We should keep in mind that there are two kinds of surfaces for MAPbI3: the MA molecule covered surface and the PbI network terminated surface. In the MA-covered surface, because of the weak bonding interaction between the outmost MA molecule and the sub-surface PbI inorganic layer, the outmost MA molecule can be rotated or removed easily by the adsorbed H2O molecule, which destroys the surface, while on the PbI network terminated surface, the moderate bonding interactions between Pb and I atoms inside the inorganic layer make it more difficult to be destroyed by the adsorbed H2O molecule. The migration energy barrier on the MA molecule covered surface is smaller than the latter, so we take the migration energy barrier on the PbI-T surface to represent the strongest moisture resistance of MAPbI3 perovskite.24,42
As the photostriction effect arises in MAPbI3 material, the adsorption and penetration phenomena of water molecules should be reconsidered carefully. As aforementioned, it is proposed that under the sunlight irradiation, the Coulomb interactions between the amine group and the PbI network in MAPbI3 are weakened, which releases the distortion and tilting of the PbI6 octahedra and straightens the Pb–I–Pb networks. This in turn expands the lattice and gives rise to the giant photostriction effect. To mimic this phenomenon, we construct several configurations by increasing the Pb–I–Pb angles but fixing the bond lengths. Three MAPbI3 configurations with incremental Pb–I–Pb angles of 166.08°, 173.08° and 180.00° are considered, and we denote them as β, γ and ε phases and show in Fig. 1(b)–(d), respectively. When we take the photostriction effect into account, we find that the configuration possessing the lowest adsorption energy of H2O in each phase is always the one with H2O bonding with the corner Pb atom and parallel to the PbI networks, as shown in Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI.† With the increase of the Pb–I–Pb angle and thus the lattice expansion of MAPbI3, the adsorption energies listed in Table 1 decrease monotonically. The reduced adsorption energy means that the H2O molecule is easier to adsorb with the straightening of the Pb–I–Pb angle. As explained above, when the H2O molecule is located on the PbI-T surface of MAPbI3, the O atom tends to bond with the Pb atom. Because the photostriction effect increases the electron density around the Pb atom, the bonding interaction between H2O and the Pb atom becomes stronger than before. This is why the H2O molecule is adsorbed easier to the PbI-T surface of MAPbI3 perovskite after photostriction emerges.
The migration process in the MAPbI3 lattice is investigated after the appearance of photostriction as well. For each photo-induced dilation lattice, i.e., phases β, γ and ε, we also employ the configuration shown in Fig. 3(d) to represent the case of H2O penetrating below PbI networks. Using the adsorbed and penetrated configurations as the initial and final models, respectively, we obtain the CI-NEB simulated migration energy barriers for the penetration of H2O molecules in phases β, γ and ε, respectively. From Fig. 4(a) we can see that with the increase of the Pb–I–Pb angle, the migration energy barrier of adsorbed water from the surface to the subsurface decreases manifestly. In other words, due to the photostriction effect, when the adsorbed water molecule penetrates into the interior of MAPbI3, the resistance it encounters will become weaker and weaker. This also means that more and more water molecules have chances to penetrate into the bulk of MAPbI3 perovskite and destroy the lattice to decomposition. This result is consistent with the experimentally observed light enhanced moisture decomposition of MAPbI3. To explain this, we should look for the exact description of the motion of the water molecule during its penetration process.
 Fig. 4  (a) Migration energy barriers of adsorbed H2O molecules on surfaces of MAPbI3 in phases α, β, γ and ε. (b) Illustration of the penetration trace of H2O near the surface of MAPbI3. The red dashed curve and the red arrow in (b) are the guideline for the penetration path and the initial orientation of the MA molecule without the penetrated H2O molecule, respectively. 
First, for the case without a photostriction effect, when the water molecule above the surface moves downward until it penetrates the PbI network, it will encounter the MA molecule in the cage below the PbI network. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the CH3-moiety of the MA molecule shifts downward to make room to accommodate the invasive H2O molecule. As a result, the NH3-radical moves upward to maintain the completeness of the MA molecule. Eventually, the MA molecule rotates evidently from the position before penetration of H2O, which is illustrated in Fig. 4(b). The resistance that the invasive H2O encounters is predominantly generated by the MA molecule. The highest energy barrier during the penetration appears when the MA molecule impacts the largest repelling interaction against the invasive H2O molecule. This is the moment when the hydrogen bonds between I atoms in the PbI networks and the MA molecule begin to break and the MA molecule starts to rotate. As is well known, the hydrogen bonding interactions between the PbI networks and MA molecules maintain the unique structure of MAPbI3.41 The break of hydrogen bonds caused by the water molecule will inevitably weaken the stability of MAPbI3 material. Second, when the light induced lattice dilation arises, the Pb–I–Pb angles increase and the hydrogen bonding interactions between organic/inorganic moieties reduce. Hence the break of these bonds becomes easier than before. This also means that when the MA molecule is repelled by the invasive H2O molecule, it is more likely to be rotated away from the initial orientation. That is, the resistance generated by the MA molecule decreases, which is demonstrated by the reduction of the energy barrier shown in Fig. 4(a). The lower energy barrier means the adsorbed water molecules have a higher possibility to transfer into the interior of MAPbI3 than they do before light irradiation. And as discussed in previous reports, when the adsorbed water molecules penetrate into the first layer of the surface, they will have more chance to migrate deeper into the interior of the MAPbI3 lattice and enhance the dissociation of this perovskite structure.23 So the light irradiation can accelerate the moisture decomposition of MAPbI3 material. Nevertheless, the lattice dilation induced by the photostriction effect would not only decrease the penetration energy barrier of water molecules, but also has large possibility to reduce migration barriers of other molecules, such as I2-vapor molecules, which is considered as one of the main origins to dissociate iodide-based perovskites.15 However, this needs further calculations.
Besides the adsorption and penetration behaviors of H2O molecules nearby the surface, another interesting electronic behavior, i.e., the modulation effect on the band gap of MAPbI3 perovskite introduced by the photostriction effect, also contributes to the light enhanced moisture decomposition of MAPbI3 perovskite. With the increase of the Pb–I–Pb angle in the MAPbI3 lattice resulting from the photostriction effect, the calculated band gap decreases with values of 1.55 eV, 1.14 eV, 1.09 eV and 1.04 eV for phases α, β, γ and ε, respectively. This phenomenon can be understood by a special relationship between the geometric structure and the electronic structure in MAPbI3. As mentioned above, in ideal orthogonal PbI networks, i.e., the Pb–I–Pb angle equals 180°, the CBM and VBM of MAPbI3 are predominantly anti-bonding states between Pb-6p and I-5s orbitals and between I-5p and Pb-6s orbitals, respectively.36 The bonding coupling only takes place between the p orbitals and s orbitals. The Pb-6py and I-5px orbitals are in the nonbonding state, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). However, in natural MAPbI3 perovskite, the PbI networks are not ideal orthogonal and the PbI6 octahedra are distorted. The deformation of PbI6 octahedron generates the transverse displacement between Pb and I atoms, which is exhibited by the reduction of the Pb–I–Pb angle, as shown in Fig. 1. This transverse shift makes the coupling interaction between Pb-6p and I-5p turn from the nonbonding state to the bonding states, as shown in Fig. 5(b), while it weakens the bonding interaction between p/s orbitals. As discussed above, the CBM and VBM of are all antibonding states of Pb-6p/I-5s orbitals and Pb-6s/I-5p orbitals, respectively. The decrease of the coupling interactions between s/p orbitals of Pb and I atoms shifts both band edge levels downward. Vice versa, when the photostriction effect works, PbI networks in MAPbI3 tend to change from the original twinkled state to the ideal orthogonal coordinated, the Pb–I–Pb angle increases and the transverse displacements between Pb and I atoms tend to diminish. This means that the p–p coupling interaction between Pb and I atoms weakens, and the CBM and VBM shift upward. The VBM is more sensitive to the variation of coupling, so it increases more and reduces the band gap.43 Considering the band gap modulation effect, the photostriction phenomenon of MAPbI3 perovskite is a self-accelerated process. First, the light irradiation and the optical absorption make the lattice expand. Second, the lattice expansion reduces the band gap and the absorption threshold. Third, the reduced absorption threshold causes MAPbI3 material to absorb more photons with a lower energy. Finally, the extra absorption starts a new photostriction process. Hence, this self-accelerated photostriction effect will speed up the moisture decomposition process and worsen the stability of MAPbI3 perovskite.

Conclusions
Above all, by a series of first principles calculations, we analyze the light enhanced moisture degradation of MAPbI3 material. When MAPbI3 is illuminated by the above band gap light, a giant photostriction effect arises. This photostriction makes the adsorption of the H2O molecule on the MAPbI3 surface easier for the reinforcement of coupling interaction between the H2O molecule and Pb atom. Due to the weakening of coupling interactions between MA and I atoms, the MA molecule rotates more easily than before, reducing the resistance against the penetration of the invasive H2O molecule. So the adsorption and penetration of H2O nearby the MAPbI3 surface are enhanced after the above band gap illumination. Because the photostriction effect of MAPbI3 straightens the PbI networks, the band gap of MAPbI3 perovskite decreases, leading to more photon absorption and thus self-accelerated photostriction process. Therefore, the photostriction effect could speed up the moisture decomposition of MAPbI3 perovskite. Making this clear, we could get new strategies to develop PSCs with strong moisture resistance, i.e., looking for perovskite materials with no or a minor photostriction effect.
