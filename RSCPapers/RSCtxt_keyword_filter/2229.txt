    , Accepted 13th March 2013First published on 26th March 2013AbstractPoly[4,4-di(2-ethylhexyl)dithienogermole-2,6-diyl] was prepared by palladium-catalyzed Stille homocoupling of 6-bromo-2-(trimethylstannyl)-4,4-di(2-ethylhexyl)dithienogermole, while a similar cross-coupling of 2,6-dibromo-4,4-dioctyldithienogermole with 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,4-dioctyldithienogermole provided poly(4,4-dioctyldithienogermole-2,6-diyl). These polymers showed broad absorption bands in the UV-vis spectra, which were red-shifted from that reported previously for the silicon analogue poly(dithienosilole-2,6-diyl). Potential applications of the polymers as active materials for bulk heterojunction-type polymer solar cells and thin film transistors were explored.
Introduction
Element-bridged bithiophenes have been extensively studied as the building units of functional π-conjugated oligomers and polymers.1 In these systems, the bithiophene unit is fixed to be highly planar by the bridge to enhance conjugation. In addition, the element often exhibits unique electronic effects to manipulate the bithiophene electronic states realizing the desired functionalities. We are interested, in particular, in the group 14 (ref. 2 and 3) and 15 (ref. 4) metal-bridged bithiophenes, namely dithienometalloles (Chart 1). In these molecules, bonding interaction between the metal vacant orbital and the bithiophene π*-orbital operates in the LUMO to stabilize it, while the HOMO remains nearly intact, leading to further minimized HOMO–LUMO energy gaps. Such interesting electronic effects of the bridging metals provide opportunities to utilize dithienometallole derivatives as organic device materials. Among these dithienometalloles, dithienosilole (DTS, M = SiR2) has been widely studied as the donor unit of donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers that can be used as photovoltaic materials for bulk heterojunction-type polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs).5 DTS homopolymers were also prepared by us6 and Marks et al.,7 independently. However, no functionalities with high performance were reported for these DTS homopolymers, except for their use as electroluminescence materials,6a in spite of the fact that they exhibit extended conjugation, as compared to conventional polythiophene derivatives. In 2011, we introduced dithienogermole (DTG, M = GeR2) as a new element-bridged bithiophene system and prepared D–A polymers with DTG as the donor, which showed photovoltaic applications.3 Nearly simultaneously, Reynolds et al. and Leclerc et al. also prepared DTG-containing D–A polymers.8 In these studies, the cells based on some of the DTG-containing D–A polymers showed higher performance than those of the DTS-containing analogues.3c,8a

In this paper, we report for the first time the synthesis of DTG homopolymers and their applications as photovoltaic and semi-conducting materials. It was anticipated that replacement of the silicon bridging atom with a heavier germanium atom led to better interchain interaction in the solid states, which would be of importance to give rise to high carrier transporting properties. In addition, the dialkylgermylene unit with longer Ge–C bonds is more flexible than the dialkylsilylene unit, which would avoid the steric repulsion between the chains by moving to appropriate positions also to allow the rather strong interchain interaction. These polymers are thus potentially interesting for applications as BHJ-PSC and organic thin film transistor (TFT) materials.
Experimental
General
All reactions were carried out in dry argon. Chlorobenzene, toluene, and ether used as the reaction solvents were distilled from CaH2 and stored over activated molecular sieves until use. The starting compounds 2,6-dibromo-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithienogermole (DTG1Br2),3a 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,6-bis(trimethylsilyl)dithienogermole (DTG1Si2),3a and 2,6-dibromo-4,4-dioctyldithienogermole (DTG2Br2)8b were prepared as reported in the literature. NMR spectra were recorded on Varian 400-MR and System-500 spectrometers. APCI mass spectra were measured on a Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL spectrometer at N-BARD Hiroshima University, while EI mass spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu QP-2020A spectrometer. UV-vis absorption and PL spectra were measured on Hitachi U-3210 and Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometers, respectively. Polymer molecular weights were determined by GPC, using serially connected Shodex KF2001 and KF2002 columns and THF as the eluent. BHJ-PSC3b and TFT10 devices using the present polymers were fabricated as reported in the literature.
Preparation of 6-bromo-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2-(trimethylstannyl)dithienogermole (DTG1BrSn)
To a solution of DTG1Br2 (2.064 g, 3.323 mmol) in 30 mL of ether was added an n-butyllithium solution (2.00 mL, 1.65 M in hexane) slowly at −80 °C. After stirring at this temperature for 30 min, trimethyltin chloride (0.801 g, 4.020 mmol) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The mixture was poured into ice-water, and the organic layer was separated and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the solvent was evaporated, the residue was purified by preparative GPC eluting with toluene to give 0.682 g of DTG1BrSn as a yellow viscous oil (30% yield as a diastereomeric mixture); 1H NMR (δ in CDCl3, 500 MHz) 7.06 (s, 1H), 6.96 (s, 1H), 1.46 (m, 2H), 1.34–1.11 (m, 20H), 0.87–0.76 (m, 12H), 0.37 (s, 9H); 13C NMR (δ in CDCl3, 125 MHz) 151.54, 151.53, 151.52, 147.12, 147.07, 147.01, 144.24, 144.19, 144.14, 143.92, 143.77, 143.62, 138.10, 138.09, 138.07, 137.56, 137.54, 137.52, 132.39, 110.12, 36.93, 36.88, 35.40, 35.38, 28.89, 28.84, 28.73, 28.71, 23.01, 22.98, 20.74, 20.72, 20.61, 20.59, 14.14, 10.88, 10.84, −8.18; HR-MS (APCI) calcd: [M+] 706.03743, found: 706.03772.
Preparation of 2,6-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,4-dioctyldithienogermole (DTG2Sn2)
To a solution of DTG2Br2 (2.223 g, 3.579 mmol) in 75 mL of ether was added an n-butyllithium solution (4.40 mL, 1.64 M in hexane) slowly at −80 °C. After stirring at this temperature for 30 min, trimethyltin chloride (1.727 g, 8.667 mmol) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The mixture was poured into ice-water and the organic layer was separated and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the solvent was evaporated, the residue was purified by preparative GPC eluting with toluene to give 1.303 g of DTG2Sn2 as a yellow oil (46% yield); 1H NMR (δ in CDCl3, 500 MHz) 7.08 (s, 2H), 1.49 (m, 4H), 1.35–1.15 (m, 24H), 0.87 (t, 6H), 0.38 (s, 18H); 13C NMR (δ in CDCl3, 125 MHz) 152.58, 144.02, 137.72, 137.34, 32.86, 31.85, 39.26, 29.15, 25.63, 22.66, 14.38, 14.11, −8.10; HR-MS (APCI) calcd: [M+] 792.09172, found: 792.09313.
Preparation of poly[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithienogermole-2,6-diyl] (pDTG1)
A mixture of DTG1BrSn (0.682 g, 0.967 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (17.7 mg, 0.019 mmol), P(o-tol)3 (29.4 mg, 0.097 mmol), and 15 mL of chlorobenzene was vacuum degassed and heated to reflux for 5 days. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and the resulting precipitates were filtered. A solution of sodium N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate trihydride (3.1 g) in 30 mL of water was added to the filtrate and the mixture was heated to 80 °C with stirring for 2 h. The organic layer was separated and washed in the following order: with water, 3% acetic acid aqueous solution, and water again. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed under vacuum. Reprecipitation of the residue from chloroform/methanol gave polymeric substances, which were then placed in a Soxhlet apparatus and washed with hot methanol, hexane, and acetone. Finally the residue that remained insoluble in those hot solvents was extracted with hot chloroform. The chloroform solution was poured into hexane and the resulting precipitates were collected to give pDTG1H (0.274 g, 55%) as black solids: m.p. >300 °C, 1H NMR (δ in CDCl3, 400 MHz) 7.10 (s, 2H), 1.53 (m, 2H), 1.36–1.18 (m, 20H), 0.89–0.80 (m, 12H); 13C NMR (δ in CDCl3, 100 MHz) 145.27, 144.47, 138.21, 126.00, 37.01, 35.48, 28.95, 28.78, 23.06, 20.77, 14.18, 10.90. A lower molecular weight fraction pDTG1L was obtained by precipitation of the polymeric substances that were soluble in hot hexane from ethanol (41% yield) as black solids, which provided essentially the same NMR spectra as those of pDTG1H.
Preparation of poly(4,4-dioctyldithienogermole-2,6-diyl) (pDTG2)
A mixture of DTG2Sn2 (330.9 mg, 0.419 mmol), DTG2Br2 (260.5 mg, 0.419 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (7.7 mg, 0.008 mmol), P(o-tol)3 (12.9 mg, 0.042 mmol), CuO (33.5 mg 0.421 mmol), and 18 mL of chlorobenzene was vacuum degassed and heated to reflux for 5 days. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and the resulting precipitates were filtered. A solution of sodium N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate trihydride (3.1 g) in 30 mL of water was added to the filtrate and the mixture was heated to 80 °C with stirring for 2 h. The organic layer was separated and washed in the following order: with water, 3% acetic acid aqueous solution, and water again. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed under vacuum. Reprecipitation of the residue from chlorobenzene/ethanol gave polymeric substances, which were then placed in a Soxhlet apparatus and washed with hot ethanol and hexane. Finally the residue that remained insoluble in those hot solvents was extracted with hot cyclohexane. The cyclohexane solution was poured into benzene:ethyl acetate = 3:2 and the resulting precipitates were collected to give pDTG2H (152.9 mg, 39%) as black solids; m.p. >300 °C, 1H NMR (δ in C6D4Cl2, 500 MHz) 7.35 (s, 2H), 1.58 (m, 4H), 1.37–1.10 (m, 24H), 0.87 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H); 13C NMR (δ in C6D4Cl2, 125 MHz) 33.20, 32.18, 29.69, 29.47, 25.94, 23.04, 14.37 (sp2 carbon signals could not be seen, due to the polymer low solubility). A lower molecular weight fraction pDTG2L was obtained by precipitation of the polymeric substances that were soluble in hot hexane from ethyl acetate:hexane = 2:1 (24% yield) as black solids, which provided essentially the same NMR spectra as those of pDTG2H. Again, no sp2 carbon signals were observed, even by an overnight NMR measurement.
Preparation of 6-bromo-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2-(trimethylsilyl)dithienogermole (DTG1BrSi)
To a solution of DTG1Si2 (3.032 g, 4.989 mmol) in 20 mL of chloroform was added NBS (0.893 g, 5.017 mmol) in several portions with ice-cooling. After the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, the mixture was poured into 200 mL of water. The organic layer was separated and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography eluting with hexane to give 2.684 g (88% yield as a diastereomeric mixture) of DTG1BrSi as a dark yellow viscous oil: 1H NMR (δ in CDCl3, 500 MHz) 7.11 (s, 1H), 6.97 (s, 1H), 1.41–1.49 (m, 2H), 1.34–1.11 (m, 20H), 0.86–0.82 (m, 6H), 0.79 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 6H), 0.37 (s, 9H); 13C NMR (δ in CDCl3, 125 MHz) 151.12, 147.01, 146.95, 146.89, 144.57, 144.50, 144.45, 144.41, 144.24, 141.00, 140.98, 140.97, 136.49, 136.47, 136.46, 132.44, 110.57, 110.58, 110.54, 36.94, 36.88, 35.43, 35.39, 28.91, 28.84, 28.74, 28.72, 22.99, 22.96, 20.73, 20.71, 20.60, 20.57, 14.13, 10.88, 10.83, 0.04; HR-MS (APCI) calcd: [M+] 614.11216, found: 614.11279.
Preparation of 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(trimethylsilyl)-2-(trimethylstannyl)dithienogermole (DTG1SiSn)
To a solution of DTG1BrSi (2.684 g, 4.368 mmol) in 20 mL of ether was added dropwise n-butyllithium in hexane (2.70 mL, 1.64 M in hexane) at −80 °C. After stirring the mixture for 30 min at this temperature, trimethyltin chloride (1.201 g, 6.026 mmol) was added and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The mixture was hydrolyzed with ice-water and the organic layer was separated. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was subjected to preparative GPC eluting with toluene to give 0.837 g of DTG1SiSn as an yellow viscous oil (27% yield as a diastereomeric mixture): 1H NMR (δ in CDCl3, 500 MHz) 7.12 (s, 1H), 7.07 (s, 1H), 1.51–1.44 (m, 2H), 1.34–1.10 (m, 20H), 0.84–0.77 (m, 12H), 0.37 (s, 9H), 0.32 (s, 9H); 13C NMR (δ in CDCl3, 125 MHz) 152.03, 151.82, 145.61, 145.29, 140.08, 137.79, 137.65, 136.73, 36.94, 35.44, 35.42, 28.93, 28.89, 28.76, 23.01, 20.60, 14.17, 10.88, 0.096, −8.179; HR-MS (APCI) calcd: [M + H+] 701.17427, found: 701.17480.
Preparation of 4,4,4′,4′-tetrakis(2-ethylhexyl)-6,6′-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′-bi(dithienogermole) (dDTG1)
A mixture of DTG1BrSi (1.280 g, 2.083 mmol), DTG1SiSn (1.528 g, 2.188 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (0.150 g, 0.123 mmol), and toluene (20 mL) was heated to reflux for 12 h. The resulting mixture was filtered and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was then subjected to silica gel column chromatography eluting with hexane to give 1.889 g of dDTG1 as an yellow viscous oil (85% yield as a diastereomeric mixture): 1H NMR (δ in CDCl3, 500 MHz) 7.14 (s, 2H), 7.08 (s, 2H), 1.50 (m, 4H), 1.38–1.15 (m, 48H), 0.85–0.79 (m, 24H), 0.34 (s, 18H); 13C NMR (δ in CDCl3, 125 MHz) 151.69, 151.69, 151.67, 145.94, 145.79, 145.64, 145.26, 145.21, 145.16, 144.59, 144.54, 144.50, 140.67, 140.65, 140.63, 138.22, 136.71, 136.69, 136.67, 125.98, 37.01, 36.95, 35.49, 35.42, 28.97, 28.86, 28.80, 28.77, 23.02, 23.01, 20.72, 20.64, 20.62, 14.16, 10.89, 10.88, 0.082; HR-MS (APCI) calcd: [M+] 1070.38820, found: 1070.38628.
Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis
Poly(dithienogermole-2,6-diyl)s, pDTG1 and pDTG2, with branched and linear solubilizing alkyl groups on the germanium atoms were prepared as shown in Scheme 1. For pDTG1, monolithiation of DTG1Br2, followed by treatment of the resulting monolithiated DTG with trimethyltin chloride gave bromo(trimethylstannyl)dithienogermole DTG1BrSn, which was polymerized by a palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction to give pDTG1. Polymer pDTG1 obtained from this reaction was fractionally extracted by using a Soxhlet apparatus to provide higher and lower molecular weight fractions pDTG1H and pDTG1L, respectively, as summarized in Table 1. In contrast to DTG1Br2, a similar reaction of dibromodioctyldithienogermole DTG2Br2 with 1 equiv. of n-butyllithium proceeded non-selectively to produce a mixture of the starting dibromide, and mono- and dilithiated dithienogermole in an appropriate ratio of 1:2:1, due to the low solubility of DTG2Br2, and therefore we prepared bis(trimethylstannyl)dithienogermole DTG2Sn2 as the monomer. Stille cross-coupling of DTG2Sn2 with DTG2Br2, as shown in Scheme 1, followed by fractional extraction provided pDTG2H and pDTG2L (Table 1).

These DTG-polymers were characterized mainly by NMR analysis. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the polymers were consistent with the regular structures shown in Scheme 1, although sp2 signals were not clearly seen for pDTG2, due to its low solubility. To obtain further information about the polymer structures, we prepared DTG dimer dDTG1 by a Stille cross-coupling reaction of monobromo- and monostannyldithienogermole (DTGBrSi and DTGSiSn), as shown in Scheme 2. Fig. 1 represents the comparison of the sp2 carbon regions of pDTG1H and dDTG1, in which the signals of DTG1H appear at nearly the same chemical shifts as those of the inner thiophene ring signals of dDTG1. No evident differences in the NMR spectra, depending on the molecular weights, were noted.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of the DTG dimer. 
 Fig. 1  Aromatic regions of 13C NMR spectra of pDTG1H and dDTG1 in CDCl3. Splitting ascribed to the existence of diastereomeric germylene units, with respect to two chiral 2-ethylhexyl substituents, is observed for some of the signals. 
Optical properties of the DTG polymers are also summarized in Table 1 and the UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra are depicted in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. The DTG polymers possess red-shifted absorption maxima, relative to that of dDTG1 (λmax = 440 nm in chlorobenzene). They are red-shifted also from that reported for a similar DTS polymer with hexyl groups on the centre silicon atoms (pDTS in Chart 2, λmax = 533 nm in THF and 535 nm as a film).7b Although the molecular weight of pDTS was reported to be Mn = ca. 9000, lower than those of the present DTG polymers, the differences of the λmax values between pDTG1/pDTG2 and pDTS appear too large to be ascribed to only the molecular weight differences. It is also noteworthy that the present DTG polymers show highly red-shifted absorption bands as compared to those of regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (p3HT in Chart 2, Aldrich Sigma Inc., head-to-tail content >95%, λmax = 458 nm), which is known as a typical polythiophene that exhibits a variety of applications.1 These are indicative of the large germanium bridging effects that enhance conjugation. The polymers exhibit no significant shifts of the absorption maxima depending on the molecular weights, indicating that the polymer conjugation lengths were nearly saturated at the stages of pDTG1L and pDTG2L (Fig. 2a). The absorption bands of pDTG1 with sterically bulky 2-ethylhexyl groups in solution are at higher energies than those of octyl-substituted pDTG2. Both the polymers show shoulder peaks at longer wavelengths, which are enhanced with increasing the molecular weights and rather intensified for pDTG2 as compared to pDTG1.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of DTG polymers in chlorobenzene (a) and as films (b). 
 Fig. 3  PL spectra of DTG polymers in chlorobenzene excited at the absorption maxima. 
 Chart 2  Polythiophene derivatives. 
Measuring the spectra of pDTG1H and pDTG1L as films shifted the maxima to lower energies by approximately 37 and 35 nm, respectively, from those in solution (Fig. 2b). The red shifts seem to be due to the enhanced interchain interaction of the polymers in films. In contrast to this, pDTG2H and pDTG2L exhibit maxima in films, red-shifted only by 4 and 7 nm, respectively, from those in solution. However, the shoulder peaks approximately at 660 nm in the solution spectra are markedly enhanced in films, indicating the interchain interaction, similar to pDTG1. The PL spectra of the polymers are presented in Fig. 3, whose maxima are at nearly the same wavelengths, regardless of the substituents and the molecular weights. However, pDTG2 showed enhanced shoulders approximately at 700 nm in the PL spectra, when compared to pDTG1. It is likely that pDTG2 with less hindered octyl groups readily forms intramolecular π-stacking even in the solution phase, being responsible for the enhanced PL shoulders, which would be also a reason for the red-shifted absorption maxima and the relatively intensified shoulder peaks of pDTG2 relative to those of pDTG1 in solution. The absolute PL quantum efficiencies were determined by using an integration sphere to be less than 2%. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the polymer cast films on platinum electrodes were examined in acetonitrile containing lithium perchlorate as an electrolyte, which showed pseudo-reversible anodic peaks. Based on the onset potentials, the HOMO energy levels were estimated to be approximately −5.0 eV for pDTG1 and −4.8 eV for pDTG2. These HOMO levels are a little lower than or comparable to that reported for p3HT (−4.80 eV) estimated by a similar CV measurement of the film.9 The polymers exhibited good thermal stability in a nitrogen atmosphere with the 5% weight loss temperatures (Td5) approximately at 400 °C in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Table 1).
Photovoltaic and semi-conducting properties
BHJ-PSCs based on the present DTG polymers as the host materials were fabricated with the structure of ITO (150 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/DTG-polymer:PC70BM (70–85 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al (80 nm) and the active area of 0.25 cm2. The active layers were prepared by spin-coating o-dichlorobenzene solutions of the blends of the polymers and PC70BM in a weight ratio of 1:3.6 containing 2.5 vol% of diiodooctane as a processing additive. The cells showed clear photovoltaic activities whose J–V (current density–voltage) curves and IPCE (incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency) spectra are depicted in Fig. 4. The IPCE spectra fitted the UV spectra of the polymer films and the edges reached approximately 750 nm, reflecting the low band gap properties of the polymers. Annealing of the active layers as well as the devices did not affect the results.

The cell parameters are summarized in Table 2. The cells with pDTG1 showed higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) but lower short-circuit current density (Jsc), than those with pDTG2, in accordance with the lower-lying HOMO and the less degree of interchain interaction of pDTG1. The molecular weights of the polymers exert a significant influence on the cell performance and the higher molecular weights led to higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). Increasing the molecular weights facilitated the carrier conduction to increase Jsc, presumably due to the enhanced interchain interaction, although Voc was slightly lowered. The best performance among the cells examined was achieved by using pDTG1H with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 1.71%.

To examine the polymer semi-conducting properties, we fabricated bottom contact type thin film transistors (TFTs) with spin-coated films of the DTG polymers having a thickness of ca. 30 nm as the active layers. The devices showed a clear p-type transistor response as summarized in Table 2, in contrast to pDTS, which was previously demonstrated to be TFT inactive.7 For the TFTs with pDTG1, annealing the devices at 60–140 °C decreased the mobility by approximately 2 and 1 order(s) of magnitude for pDTG1H and pDTG1L, respectively. However, the mobility of pDTG2H and pDTG2L was enhanced by annealing by approximately 3 and 1.5 times, respectively. Annealing the polymer films did not significantly affect the UV-vis absorption spectra, but 4 nm blue shifts were observed for both pDTG1H and pDTG1L upon annealing over 100 °C. Higher performance was achieved by using pDTG2 with less hindered octyl groups, relative to pDTG1. The higher molecular weights resulted in the higher performance for both pDTG1 and pDTG2. All the polymer films were amorphous and XRD measurements of the films provided no detectable diffraction peaks.
Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized poly(dithienogermole-2,6-diyl)s, pDTG1 and pDTG2, as new polythiophene derivatives. Optical and electrochemical measurements of the DTG polymers clearly indicated the extended conjugation in these polymers, as compared to the silole analogue pDTS and a conventional polythiophene p3HT. We fabricated BHJ-PSCs using the present polymers as the host materials and PC70BM as the dopant and obtained the maximum PCE of 1.71% achieved by employing pDTG1H. The p-type semi-conducting properties of the DTG polymers were also explored. Studies to improve the device performance by tuning the polymer structures and the device fabrication process and also on exploring other functionalities are now under way.
