    , Accepted 5th September 2020First published on 7th September 2020AbstractThe properties of TiO2 can vary greatly, depending on the size and morphology of the particles used. The modeling of TiO2 nanoparticles of various diameters, and the study of their properties and morphology are of great interest for identifying the factors affecting the properties of nanoparticles. In this paper, the theoretical study based on the modeling of nanoparticles of TiO2 and the relationship between morphological parameters and calculated descriptors has been carried out. As a result of simulation, the nanoparticle structures of the composition Ti17O34–Ti568O1136 have been obtained. The surface analysis of nanoparticles has been carried out, and their density is calculated. We explained the increase in N3 dye adsorption and photovoltaic parameters with the decrease in the surface area of nanoparticles. We found that dye adsorption, short circuit photocurrent density, and power conversion efficiency are related to the solvent accessible surface area of the nanoparticle as well as the accessible surface area of oxygens.
Introduction
TiO2 is an important material in the production of solar cells.1 It is also widely used in the food and cosmetic industries, the manufacture of paints and plastics and in many other areas.2,3 At the same time, the predominant direction in the study of TiO2 is nanotechnology.4,5
TiO2 nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes can be synthesized using modern synthetic methods. One of the promising applications for TiO2 nanoparticles is the production of dye-sensitized solar cells DSSC, the so-called Gretzel cells. The first dye-sensitized solar cells based on TiO2 were developed by Gretzel in 1991, with the efficiency between 7.1% and 7.9%.6 Currently, the power conversion efficiency of Gretzel's solar cells has reached 14%.7–10
Numerous studies have shown that dyes,9,11–15 electrolytes16,17 and the film thicknesses of solar cells18 have an influence on the efficiency of solar energy conversion. In addition, the properties of a solar cell depend on the dispersion and structural characteristics of TiO2.19–25 The DSSCs with large TiO2 particle sizes have lower power conversion efficiency than those with small TiO2 particle sizes.18 To increase the power conversion efficiency, the authors studied the effect of TiO2 particle size on the power conversion efficiency in elements with two-layer and three-layer structures.18 The authors determined that the choice of nanoparticle size in the bottom layer is the most important. The DSSCs with a nanoparticle size of 5 nm in the bottom layer have a higher power conversion efficiency than DSSCs with larger particle sizes, namely 100 and 200 nm.18
At the same time, there are examples, which show the increase in photovoltaic parameters with the increase in the size of nanoparticles used in the films of the solar cells.26 It was demonstrated that with the increase of the TiO2 nanoparticle size, both the power conversion efficiency and the short circuit photocurrent density increase. The authors explain the growth of photovoltaic characteristics with increase in size of nanoparticles by the increase in the N3 dye adsorption on the surface of TiO2. The N3 dye adsorption on the film of a solar cell increases with increase in the TiO2 particle size. An important parameter influencing the dye adsorption on TiO2 nanoparticles is the surface area. It is obvious that the surface area decreases with increasing nanoparticle size, which consequently should lead to the decrease in the amount of the dye adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticles. However, in some cases, the authors determined that the dye adsorption on TiO2 increases with the increase of nanoparticle size. Therefore, it is difficult to explain this fact with the surface area.26
Recently, Ichijo et al.27 described the TiO2 nanoparticle preparation that was carried out under strict control of particle size using a Pd12L24 spherical complex as an endo-template. The study of the synthesized nanoparticles showed that depending on the conditions, they can have different molecular weights due to different densities of nanoclusters. The change in the density of nanoparticles is associated with the structure, which affects their adsorption properties.
The theoretical studies on the morphology of nanoparticles and surface roughness may provide useful insights into the understanding of the effect of TiO2 particle size on dye adsorption and photovoltaic parameters.28 Numerous works have been devoted to the modelling of anatase nanoparticles with subsequent optimization of the geometry of the resulting structures by density functional theory (DFT)29–31 methods. A lot of recent publications describe the interactions of water, thiophene, and amino acids with TiO2 nanoparticles.32–34 The influence of the shapes (cube, ellipsoid, sphere, and cuboid), the sizes and the surface morphology of the anatase nanoparticles on their electronic structure and adsorption properties was investigated by Grishina et al.35 The electronic structure of the nanoparticles was investigated using the AlteQ method. As a result, it was shown that the shape and the morphology of nanoparticles influence the fraction of the accessible surface area of oxygens in the total accessible surface area of the nanoparticle, as well as the absolute value of charge of titanium and oxygen atoms.
Despite the large number of studies on the surface morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles, the effect of TiO2 particle size on dye adsorption and photovoltaic properties, a lot of questions still remain unanswered. Currently, the most efficient DSSCs use nanoparticles above 5 nm.36,37 One of the possible variants of modelling nanoparticles includes the translation of anatase unit cell along the three axes a, b, and c.29 At the same time, using this approach it is difficult to obtain the spherical nanoclusters above 5 nm in diameter. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach that predicts properties (specific surface values, electronic properties, density, solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and accessible surface area of oxygens (SO)) for anatase spherical nanoparticles above 5 nm in diameter. The obtained properties can be used to predict dye adsorption and photovoltaic characteristics of nanoparticles. Chou et al.26 investigated the dye adsorption, and photovoltaic parameters of nanoparticles of sizes 9.8 nm, 10.7 nm, 15.3 nm, 18.9 nm, and 22.5 nm, measured under the same conditions. Fabrication details of the studied devices are the following: dye – ruthenium complex N3 (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)), and liquid electrolyte, consisting of 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.1 M iodine, 0.6 M tetra-butylammonium iodide and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile. The values of short circuit photocurrent density, power conversion efficiency, and dye adsorption are given in Table 1.

Computational methods and discussion
Modelling the structure of nanoparticles
To determine the causes that affect the dye adsorption and the photovoltaic properties of TiO2, 48 nanoparticles of various diameters were modelled. Structural modelling was based on the translation of the anatase unit cell38 along the three axes a, b, and c (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Anatase unit cell structure. 
The studied clusters contained from [3 × 3 × 1] to [10 × 10 × 3] unit cells. The geometry of the clusters was reduced to the spherical shape (Fig. 2) with subsequent regulation of the stoichiometry of the number of atoms located on the surface of the structure. The regulation was performed based on the principle of the search for the most stable nanoparticle with the lowest energy Etotal, described below. Defects (looses) are mostly formed in place of removed atoms. The difference in total energies for stable and unstable particles is 1.61–2.62 kcal mol−1 for Ti131O262, for larger particles the difference in energies becomes larger, e.g. 5.01–20.74 kcal mol−1 for Ti568O1136. Then, the difference in the total energies per one TiO2 fragment varies from 0.012 to 0.036 kcal mol−1. Thus, the difference grows with the growth of size of nanoparticles and it becomes significant for the experimentally studied nanoparticles. As a result, 48 complexes (TiO2)n were prepared for calculations, where n = 17–568.

Study on the morphology of nanoparticles
We performed the analysis of the morphology of the obtained nanoparticles. The nanoclusters have internal through voids, so-called tunnels.39,40 The tunnels are formed as a result of the translation of the initial TiO2 unit cell. The number and length of the tunnels in the structure increase with increasing diameter of the nanoparticle. The arrangement of atoms in the tunnels and their sizes do not allow the dye to penetrate inside, but the dye can be located at the entrance to the tunnel. The entrance in the tunnels forms pores that are on the surface of the nanoparticle. Also, pores are formed between the atoms of the lateral fragments of the tunnels located on the surface of the nanoparticles. The pore sizes do not change with increasing nanoparticle diameter (Fig. 3), while the number of pores on the surface increases.
 Fig. 3  Pores and tunnels of the nanoparticles obtained from the nanorod [5 × 5 × 4]. 
Surface roughness of the structures is formed with the participation of oxygen atoms covalently bonded to two and three titanium atoms (Fig. 4). Oxygen interacting with two titanium atoms (biconnected or so-called bridge oxygen) is characterized by a greater value of the solvent accessible surface area than oxygen bound to three titaniums (triconnected oxygen).
 Fig. 4  Fragment of nanoparticles. Oxygen atoms forming a pore on the surface: 1 – oxygen bound to two titanium atoms, and 2 – oxygen bound to three titanium atoms. 
As the diameter of the sphere increases, the amount of the bridge oxygens and the number of pores formed with its participation increase. Such pores are characterized by the size of 3.78 Å, which exceeds the van der Waals radii of atoms. Biconnected oxygen is also involved in the formation of pores 4.85 Å and 7.22 Å in size (distances between two of the most distant atoms as shown in Fig. 5), but in this case, pore formation is carried out not only with the participation of the bridge oxygen, but also with oxygen covalently bound to three titanium atoms. Thus, it can be assumed that, first of all, N3 dye molecules interact with bridge oxygen atoms. If all biconnected oxygens already interact with the dye, then the N3 dye adsorbs on the surface of the nanoparticle via the triconnected oxygen. In this case, the interaction of dye with the nanoparticles can occur both with the incorporation into the pore, and with the formation of π-stacking interactions. The incorporation of dye into the pore is possible if the compound has an unfolded structure or side chains. The π-stacking arrangement of the dye is expected in the region of the smooth surface of the nanoparticle. Such an arrangement of dye is typical of structures in which there are no side chains, which allows the compound to be complementary to the surface of the nanoparticle (Fig. 5). Thus, the structural features of the surface of the nanoclusters that provide interaction in the dye-TiO2 system are established.
 Fig. 5  Surface morphology of the nanoparticles. 
Modelling of intermolecular interactions between the N3 dye and the TiO2 nanoparticles
To investigate how the N3 dye is adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles, modelling of TiO2–dye complexes was carried out. Modelling was carried out for the N3 dye taking into account the influence of ethanol used as a solvent in the dye bath. Modelling of TiO2 complexes with the N3 dye and energy minimization by geometrical parameters were carried out within the MOPS algorithm in the combined MM3/MERA (model of effective radii of atoms) force field with an implicit accounting of the influence of the solvent. Application of this algorithm was shown when studying organic and inorganic systems.41–62
The MOPS algorithm
The MOPS algorithmis based on the assumption that structural changes in molecules mainly arise as a result of motion. Then the directions of molecular motion can be determined from the equation:GFL = LΛF – matrix of force constants (Hessian), which are defined as the second derivative of the energy by the coordinate, G – an inverse mass matrix, and Λ and L – eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A = GF, respectively. Elements of diagonal Λ-matrix are squares of vibrational, rotational and translational frequencies. Each L-vector shows the direction of atomic motion during vibration/rotation/translation.
The MOPS allows you to find the geometry of the most stable complex. In this case, the following search stages are implemented:
1. Presupposes a geometry of the starting complex. Minimizes the energy of the starting complex.
2. Calculates Hessian of potential energy for the complex, finds Λ and L of the matrix A = GF.
3. Moves the atoms of the complex along each of the modes in two directions (positive and negative) to reach the nearest maximum of potential energy.
4. After overcoming the maximum, the potential energy of the complex is minimized in Cartesian coordinates. The geometry of the complex changes. The minimum of potential energy also changes.
The energies of stages 4 and 2 are compared. If the energy determined at stage 4 is smaller than that obtained earlier at stage 2, then the new complex is saved and used for a further search. Stages 2–4 are performed again for the complex with the lower energy. If all newly discovered potential energy minima are higher than the minimum found at the previous cycle (number (n − 1)), then the complex (n − 1) is the final result. Only those vibrational modes were taken into account that change the conformation of the dye and the orientation around the nanoparticle. The potential energy and Hessian of the complexes have been computed using MM3. MM3-MERA force field total energy of the complexes equals the sum of MM3 total energy (EMM3) and MERA energy (EMERA): Etotal = EMM3 + EMERA.
MERA model
MERA is a non-parametric approach estimating the energy (Eij) of atom–atom interactions including electrostatic and van der Waals energies with the estimation of the probabilities (pij) of contacts. It reproduces experimental heats of evaporation, enthalpy and entropy of formation, etc.41–62      where Uij is the depth of the potential; Reij is the equilibrium distance, which can be considered as the sum of van der Waals radii of atoms Reij = ri + rj determined from the principle of equalization of internal and external pressures in atomic balloons;44qi and qj are the charges of the atoms i and j determined based on the electronegativity equalization principle63 as described in ref. 44; ε0 is the vacuum permittivity; pij is the probability of the intermolecular atom–atom interaction; nij is a coordination number of ith atom with respect to the jth atom; Si is the solvent accessible area of the ith atom.
The simulation of “TiO2 nanoparticle–N3 dye” complexes
The use of Etotal as a criterion for the stability of the complex in the MOPS algorithm made it possible to take into account the entire spectrum of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions of the nanoparticle and the dye. This allowed us to simulate their geometrical adjustment to each other in the solvent used. The simulation of “TiO2 nanoparticle–N3 dye” complexes accounting for the solvent showed that the dye is oriented toward the nanoparticle surface by three carboxyl groups (Fig. 6). The dye molecule is bulky; it has four potential centers (carboxyl groups) for the formation of the intermolecular hydrogen bond. In this regard, the dye is oriented complementary to the surface of the pore, and not on the smoothed region of the nanoparticle. Thus, one carboxyl group is oriented toward pores with the size of 3.78 Å. In this case, the length of the hydrogen bond between the hydrogen of the dye and the biconnected oxygen of TiO2 is 2.25 Å. The second carboxyl group is oriented toward the pore with the diameter of 4.85 Å. Such an arrangement leads to the formation of the van der Waals contact between the hydrogen of the bipyridyl system and biconnected oxygen of TiO2, being 2.56 Å apart. The second bipyridyl with the carboxyl group also enters the 3.78 Å diameter pore of the nanoparticle. DFT modeling of the dye on the nanoparticle surface, carried out by Schiffmann et al.,64 confirms the orientation of the dye by carboxyl groups to the nanoparticle surface. We demonstrated that the surface structure of nanoparticles affects the interaction patterns in the “N3 dye–TiO2 nanoparticle” system.

Calculation of the density of nanoparticles
An important parameter influencing the dye adsorption on TiO2 nanoparticles is the surface area (SA). The surface area of the studied nanoparticles decreases with the diameter increase (Fig. 7). The increase of the dye adsorption with the size increase and the surface area (SA) decrease can be explained by the developed porosity of the surface. When adsorbate molecules enter the pores, they interact with the internal surfaces of the nanoparticle pores, which leads to the increase in the dye adsorption. Thus, information about the presence of pores or their absence, about the size of pores and their depth can be the key for assessing the dye adsorption on nanoparticles. It is difficult to determine the structural features of the surface of nanoparticles used for solar cells. One way to evaluate the porosity of compounds is to determine the density of the structure. Generally, structures with a developed surface and deep pores are characterized by a lower density, and vice versa; structures with a smooth surface have higher density. We calculated the density of all the considered nanoparticles using the MERA model. The calculations were performed using the web-portal ChemoSophia.65 An analysis of the results showed that the density of nanoparticles increases with the diameter increase (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 7  The dependence of the surface area (SA) on the diameter of the nanoparticle: SA = 4967.11 − 71.37·D + 0.67·D2.1, and R = 0.94, St. Err. = 21.24 Å2 g−1. 
 Fig. 8  Relationship between the density of nanoparticles and diameter: ρ = 0.48·D/(1 + 0.17·D), and R = 0.94, St. Err. = 0.017 g ml−1. 
On the graph, it is possible to identify areas corresponding to the nanoparticles, which have equal sizes but different densities. This is due to the features of the location of the tunnels in the nanoparticles, as well as the number and the size of pores on the surface of the nanoparticles. The probability of obtaining the nanoparticles with different characteristics with the equal diameter of the nanoparticles is confirmed experimentally by Ichijo et al.27 The authors obtained nanoparticles of equal size, but with different molecular weights. Using the molar mass, we calculated the density for these nanoparticles. As a result, different densities were obtained for the nanoparticles of equal diameter. Moreover, the calculated densities for the model nanoclusters correspond to the experimental density obtained for nanoparticles, which were prepared with strict control of particle size using a Pd12L24 spherical complex as an endo-template.27 So, the nanoparticle with the diameter of 2.2 ± 0.2 nm and the molecular weight of 10386 g mol−1, has the density value of 2.29 g ml−1 (Table 2). The densities of model nanoparticles with the similar molar masses of 10071 g mol−1 and 11301 g mol−1 are 2.26 g ml−1 and 2.31 g ml−1, respectively. Density was calculated as follows (1): (1)where ρ is the density, Mr is the molecular weight, Na is the Avogadro number, 0.74 is the packing coefficient of the spheres, and V is the volume of the sphere.

Agreement of the densities for the nanoparticles obtained using the experimental and the theoretical methods shows that the nanoparticles obtained by unit cell translation can be used to predict the adsorption properties of the various systems (Table 2).
The influence of molecular characteristics on dye adsorption and photovoltaic parameters
Further analysis was based on the search for descriptors describing the surface of the nanoparticles to determine the laws between the established parameters and the adsorption capacity of nanoparticles. We calculated for each nanoparticle more than 500 geometric and quantum chemical descriptors, namely, the accessible surface area of atoms in nanoparticles, the sum of intersection-free volumes of atoms in nanoparticles, the sum of accessible surface area fractions of oxygen total surface area, the number of electrons per unit of matter density, the surface area for nanoparticles, the energy of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, and the number of unbound electrons of oxygen. The descriptors were calculated using the MERA model. The calculations were performed using the web-portal ChemoSophia.65
The analysis of the obtained descriptors showed, that larger nanoparticles are energetically more stable (E) than smaller nanoparticles (Fig. 9). The solvent accessible surface area of the nanoparticle (SASA) and the accessible surface area of oxygens (SO) are identified as the most important characteristics that allow one to determine the adsorption properties of the nanoparticles (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  The relationship of solvent accessible surface area of the nanoparticle (SASA) (left), the accessible surface area of oxygens (SO) (middle), and the energy of the nanoparticles (E) (right) with the diameter (D, Å) of the nanoparticles. 
With the increase of the diameter of the nanoparticle, the number of oxygen atoms on the surface of the nanoparticle increases, i.e. the number of potential centers for interaction between the N3 dye and the surface of the nanoparticle increases, which leads to the increase of the adsorption of N3 dye on TiO2. The obtained dependences are described by a quadratic function with a slight deviation from it.
Deviations can be explained by the fact that the dye accessible surface area is determined not only by oxygens that are on the surface of the complex, but also by oxygens located inside the volume of the clusters, namely in pores. In all other cases, the deviations of the parameters from the cubic and quadratic degrees are determined by the structure of the nanoparticle: different sizes of oxygen and titanium atoms in the structure of the nanocluster, their ratio, and also the curvature of the surface of the compound.
Another important descriptor is the number of unbound electrons of oxygens (Ne) (Fig. 10). With the increase of the diameter of the nanoparticles, the amount of oxygen on the surface and inside the sphere increases and, consequently, the number of unbound oxygen electrons increases. Unbound oxygen electrons allow the nanoparticle to participate in the formation of intermolecular bonds, thereby increasing its adsorption properties. In this case, it can be assumed that the interactions of molecules with the surface of the nanoparticle can be electrostatic in nature. The ability of nanoparticles to participate in electrostatic interactions can be estimated by the value of the Coulomb energy (Ec). Larger diameter nanoparticles are more prone to the formation of intermolecular electrostatic interactions than smaller structures, which are characterized by the minimal Coulomb energy and the minimal value of unbound oxygen electrons (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  The relationship of the free electrons of oxygen (Ne) and the Coulomb energy (Ec) with the diameter of the nanoparticles. 
The obtained dependences are described by a power function. The relationship is described by eqn (2) P = a + b·D + c·De(2)where P is a descriptor, D is the diameter of model nanoparticles, and a, b, c and e are coefficients. The a, b, c, e and correlation coefficient R are shown in Table 3. The obtained nonlinear regression models made it possible to predict properties of interest, which TiO2 nanoparticles of much greater sizes should exhibit. Based on the proposed eqn (2), we calculated descriptors for particles with sizes of 9.8 nm, 10.7 nm, 15.3 nm, 18.9 nm, and 22.5 nm. The obtained values were used to analyze the photovoltaic properties of nanoparticles and dye adsorption characteristics (Table 4). The results presented by Chou et al.26 show that the N3 dye adsorption increases with the nanoparticle size increase, and the surface area decrease (Table 1). The increase in dye adsorption can be associated with structural features of the surface of the nanoparticles. It can be assumed that if there are deep pores in the nanoparticles, then this should be reflected in the density of the substance. We calculated the density for the nanoparticles with diameters of 9.8 nm, 10.7 nm, 15.3 nm, 18.9 nm, and 22.5 nm. As a result, it was found that the density of nanoparticles is lower than the density of nanoparticles obtained by translation of the anatase unit cell, as well as it is lower than the density of nanoparticles, which were prepared with strict control of particle size using a Pd12L24 spherical complex as an endo-template (Table 4). Moreover, with increasing diameter, the density decreases (Fig. 11). It can be assumed that the surface of the studied nanoparticles is loose, probably with a large number of deep pores, which leads to the increase in the adsorption of dye molecules on the surface. Porosity increases with increasing diameter, but this is not enough to increase the surface area of large nanoparticles. The surface area enhances the adsorption of molecules, but is not a key factor to affecting adsorption of nanoparticles. N3 dye adsorption on the TiO2 may be related to the properties of the nanoparticle itself. Nonlinear estimation showed the relationship of the dye adsorption to the descriptors. We found that dye adsorption on the surface of the nanoparticles increases with the increase of the accessible surface area of oxygens (SO). As the surface of the nanoparticle grows, the number of contact centers increases. This leads to the increase in the number of N3 dye–TiO2 contacts. The graphs of the obtained dependence are presented in Fig. 12. With the increase in the size of nanoparticles, not only dye adsorption, but also photovoltaic parameters change (Table 4). To determine the properties of nanoparticles that affect the photovoltaic characteristics, the relationship between descriptors and photoelectric parameters was analyzed. It was found that the most noticeable relationships are observed both for the short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and the power conversion efficiency (η%) with the accessible surface area of the nanoparticle (Fig. 13a and c). There are analogous relationships of both Jsc and η with the accessible surface area of oxygens (Fig. 13b and d).

We determined that all relationships are well described by the Langmuir equation. It was shown that the photoelectric properties (η (%) and Jsc (mA cm−2)) increase with increasing descriptors. In the first part of the graphs, the maximal increase of the photovoltaic parameters is observed until the power conversion efficiency equals 4.25% and the short circuit photocurrent density equals 10.6 mA cm−2. In the second part of the graph, with increasing descriptors, the growth of photovoltaic parameters slows down until the power conversion efficiency equals 5.19% and the short circuit photocurrent density equals 12.2 mA cm−2. Then curves reach the saturation region. The obtained dependence can be explained by the ability of nanoparticles to participate in intermolecular interactions. It can be assumed that the number of potential centers of intermolecular interaction of nanoparticles increases with increasing SASA and SO descriptors.
This leads to the increase in the interaction of N3 dye with the surface of the nanoparticles. “N3 dye–TiO2” interactions intensify electron generation and efficient charge transfer, which affects the growth of photoelectric characteristics as well. With a further increase in descriptors the amount of unoccupied oxygens decreases, which leads to the slowdown in growth of η and Jsc. Then there are only occupied oxygens on the surface of the nanoparticle and saturation of the TiO2 monomolecular layer is observed.
The relationships are well described by the Langmuir equation:D1 = k + lPm1/(1 + Pn1),where D1 is dye adsorption (mmol kg−1), Jsc (mA cm−2) or η (%); k, l, m, n are coefficients; P1 is a descriptor.
The coefficients k, l, m, and n and the correlation coefficients are shown in Table 5.

Thus, it was shown that the surface characteristics of nanoparticles, such as solvent accessible surface area, and accessible surface area of oxygens, affect N3 dye adsorption and photovoltaic parameters. We found the relationship of dye adsorption with SASA and SO. We also found the relationship of Jsc and η to SASA and SO.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we highlight that N3 dye is oriented by carboxyl groups to biconnected oxygen of nanoparticles. This orientation of the dye was found using the MOPS algorithm with the implicit accounting of the influence of the solvent. This helped to explain the increase in N3 dye adsorption and photovoltaic parameters with the decrease in the surface area of nanoparticles. We identified the properties of nanoparticles that determine the change in N3 dye adsorption and photovoltaic characteristics. We demonstrated that the key factor affecting the N3 dye adsorption and photovoltaic parameters are the properties of the nanoparticle itself, namely, oxygen atoms interacting with N3 dye. In this regard, we found that N3 dye adsorption, short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), and power conversion efficiency (η%) are related to the oxygen accessible surface area of the nanoparticle. The found relationships are described by the Langmuir equation. The results can be used to create nanoparticles with the desired properties, architecture, surface morphology and to predict dye adsorption and photovoltaic parameters for nanoparticles of various sizes.
