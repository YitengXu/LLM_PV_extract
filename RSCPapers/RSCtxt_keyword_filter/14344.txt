    , Accepted 16th December 2021First published on 16th December 2021AbstractWe have synthesised and characterised novel organic–inorganic hybrid crystals: (C3N2H5)3Sb2I9 and (C3N2H5)3Bi2I9 (PSI and PBI). The thermal DSC and TG analyses indicate four structural phase transitions (PTs) at 366.2/366.8, 274.6/275.4, 233.3/233.3 and 142.8/143.1 K (on cooling/heating) for PSI and two reversible PTs at 365.2/370.8 and 252.6/257.9 K for PBI. Both analogues crystallize at room temperature in the orthorhombic Cmcm structure, which transforms, in the case of PBI, to monoclinic P21/n at low temperature. According to the X-ray diffraction results, the anionic component is discrete and built of face-sharing bioctahedra, [M2I9]3−, in both compounds, whereas cations exhibit distinct dynamical disorder over high temperature phases. Dielectric spectroscopy and 1H NMR spectroscopy have been used to characterise the dynamical state of the C3N2H5+ cations. The ferroelastic domain structure has been characterised by observations under a polarized optical microscope. Both compounds are semiconductors with narrow bandgaps of 1.97 eV (PBI) and 2.10 eV (PSI).
Introduction
Semiconducting hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are an alternative for inorganic materials in photovoltaic technology or widely understood optoelectronics, due to easy solution processing and low production costs.1 The inorganic semiconductors which are used in photovoltaic cells (solar cells), including crystalline, multicrystalline, amorphous, and microcrystalline Si, the III–V compounds and alloys, CdTe, and the chalcopyrite copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) all have a covalent nature.2,3 HOIPs, unlike conventional materials, are ionic crystals.4–6
Metal halide perovskites are attractive solar cell absorbers in p–i–n or n–i–p junctions, where the perovskite i-layer acts as an intrinsic semiconductor.7 3D perovskites have a general formula of ABX3. Their crystal structure is built of halide anions X = I−, Br−, and Cl−, which are coordinated to a divalent metal cation B = Sn2+ or Pb2+. In the A position, small ammonium cations are incorporated. A serious disadvantage of 3D perovskites as the precursor for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is their instability in air. Lead halide perovskite solar cells were first reported in 2009.8,9 Due to a toxic threat of Pb to the environment, an attempt has been made to replace Pb(II) with Sn(II). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these Sn(II)-based cells exceeded 10%. However, they did not achieve sufficient air stability, owing to the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, which decreased the PCE.3
Bi(III) and Sb(III) based HOIPs represent a new line of research as they exhibit less toxicity and better air stability.10–13 Among other parameters that should be considered for an active layer, the following ones are the most important: the charge concentration (density of states) and mobility, charge carrier lifetimes, bandgaps together with valence and conduction band levels, direct or indirect electron transition characteristics and photocurrent density.8 In these circumstances, halobismuthates(III) and haloantimonates(III) form a promising class among organic–inorganic compounds. Over the last three decades, they have been extensively studied as functional materials for optoelectronics, mainly due to their encouraging electrical, optical and elastic properties. Many of these compounds crystallize in the polar space groups exhibiting non-linear optical, piezoelectric and ferroic (ferroelastic/ferroelectric) properties.14–18 It should be underlined that ferroelasticity within organic–inorganic hybrid materials has recently evoked much interest due to the unique mechanical properties of these materials, such as spontaneous strain, strain–stress hysteresis, and domain conversion, and thus, these materials have potential applications in piezoelectric sensors, mechanical switches, and multiple-state memories.
Numerous structural studies have shown that Sb(III)/Bi(III) halide derivatives based on various organic amines revealed a rich diversity of anionic networks.19–23 Within this organic–inorganic hybrid family, zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), and two- dimensional (2D) networks and rarely (3D) inorganic networks were observed. From the dielectric point of view the most attractive compounds appear to be the following chemical stoichiometries: R5M2X11 – (0D), R2MX5 – (1D), RMX4 – (1D) and R3M2X9 – (2D), (where R is organic amines, M = Sb(III), Bi(III) and X = Cl, Br, I), which can exhibit ferroelectric properties. Two aspects dominate in intensively conducted research on iodide analogs characterized by R3M2I9 stoichiometry:
(i) Promising electrooptic properties predisposing e.g. iodide derivatives to be used in solar cells.
(ii) Ferroic properties (ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity) generated by numerous structural phase transitions (PTs) in a wide temperature region.
Generally, R3M2X9, a class of haloantimonates(III) and halobismuthates(III) (X = Cl and Br), depending on the halogen atom and organic cation size, may adopt a (0D), (1D) or (2D)-anionic structure, whereas the iodide derivatives from this subclass adopt solely face-sharing bioctahedra (0D). The most studied and promising compound from the viewpoint of its electrooptical properties appears to be the (CH3NH3)3Bi2I924 analog which belongs to the ternary non-toxic metal halide perovskite-like materials (A3M2X9; A = Cs+, MA+, Rb+; M = Bi, Sb; X = I−, Cl).
Ferroic properties within an R3M2I9 subclass have been found to be very attractive from the viewpoint of basic research. Ferroelectricity was disclosed so far for five compounds containing in the structure relatively small organic cations i.e. methylammonium (MA),26 formamidinium (FA),25,26 trimethylammonium (TMA)27 and N,N-dimethylimidazolium.28 Most of these analogs undergo complex sequences of phase transitions (PTs), where ferroelectricity appears simultaneously with ferroelastic properties. The ferroelectric properties are due to temperature changes in the dynamics of polar organic molecules. In the case of derivatives adopting R3M2I9 stoichiometry, non-ferroelectric structural PTs appear which are accompanied by a change in the symmetry of crystals (the ferroic transition) and, as a consequence, the ferroelastic properties. Note that ferroelasticity in these compounds has been examined only fragmentarily. Interesting examples of such ferroelastics are [C(NH2)3]3Bi2I9 and [C(NH2)3]3Sb2I9 – guanidinium,29 and (C3N2H5)3Bi2I9 and (C3N2H5)3Bi2I9 – imidazolium30 analogs, which reveal a series of intermediate phases. The prototypic paraelastic phase for these compounds belongs to a hexagonal symmetry (space group P63/mmc). Ferroelasticity can be explained as a consequence of a hexagonal to orthorhombic, 6/mmmFmmm, phase transition. Encouraged by the already mentioned and characterized R3M2I9-type derivatives we extended our studies to other lead-free analogs containing small aromatic polar pyrazole amines in their structures and adopting the M2I93− anionic network (0D). It turned out that these compounds are very stable and resistant to moisture, which predisposes them to possible applications.
Here, we report complex physicochemical characterization of two pyrazolium analogs, [C3N2H5]3Bi2I9 (PBI) and [C3N2H5]3Sb2I9 (PSI), characterized by the 0D anionic network. In order to analyze the changes in the molecular dynamics of PBI and PSI in PTs we intend to use the 1H NMR method. The electric properties are investigated using complex permittivity measurements, in a wide temperature and frequency range. The main motivation of the current research is to provide information on the electronic properties (e.g. energy gap, UV–vis spectrum and theoretical calculations) and the electrical conductivity, which determine the applicability of these materials in optoelectronics.
Results and discussion
Thermal analysis
We performed thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DSC) in order to check the thermal stability of the PSI and PBI compounds. The experiment was carried out in an inert gas (N2) environment starting from room temperature until the sample reached a constant weight. Both compounds, PSI and PBI, exhibited the same thermal stability and decomposed at about 450 K (see Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI†).
The analysis of the thermal (DSC) results for PSI reveals that it undergoes four reversible solid-to-solid transitions. The phases are numbered starting from the highest temperature phase. The data concerning the phase transitions (PTs) (thermodynamic parameters) are presented in Table S4 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1a, PTs are manifested by sharp endothermic/exothermic peaks, upon heating/cooling cycles, respectively. Both the shape of the peaks and significant changes of the enthalpy and consequently of the entropy, accompanying the II → III (ΔH = 3.3 kJ mol−1 and ΔS = 12 J mol−1 K−1) and IV → V PTs (ΔH = 2.7 kJ mol−1 and ΔS = 19 J mol−1 K−1), indicate the first-order nature of these transitions. The III → IV transformation may be classified as a continuous one, whereas the I → II transition (ΔH = 0.3 kJ mol−1 and ΔS = 1 J mol−1 K−1) may be defined as close to discontinuous.

In turn, PBI undergoes only two reversible PTs (Fig. 1b) at 253/258 K and 365/371 K on cooling/heating. Values of ΔH and ΔS are presented in Table S4 (ESI†). The I → II transition exhibits features close to the discontinuous one, whereas the II → III transition is clearly of first-order (discontinuous).
Crystal structure

PSI and PBI, as the majority of iodoantimonates(III) and iodobismuthates(III) crystallizing with small-size alkylammonium and non-substituted heteroaromatic cations, adopt the R3M2I9 stoichiometry. Z. Jin et al.31 have reported a critical review devoted to the structures, theoretical prediction, preparation methods and photovoltaic performances of several lead-free group VA metal (Bi and Sb) halide based perovskites and their derivatives, especially A3M2X9, rudorffite and double perovskites. In the literature it was shown that A3Bi/Sb2I9 derivatives treated as OD-type perovskites adopt discrete bioctahedral units.32–37
The anionic component is discrete and built of face-sharing bioctahedra [M2I9]3−, whereas pyrazolium cations exhibit distinct dynamical disorder. The room temperature structure (II) is orthorhombic, with a Cmcm space group. The existence of the high-temperature hexagonal symmetry (I) is reflected in the presence of ferroelastic domains at room temperature. Due to the sample decomposition over the constant flow of hot nitrogen stream we were not able to collect the diffraction data in phase I. However, as there is no reason to suppose that PSI and PBI behave differently from guanidinium (G),29 imidazolium (Im),30 and methylammonium (MA) analogues24 we may assume the prototypic, high-temperature hexagonal P63/mmc symmetry in PSI and PBI, as it is common for all the above-mentioned HOIPs. Additionally, the Cmcm phase is common to PSI and PBI as well as to G and Im based iodoantimonates(III) and iodobismuthates(III). The amines in the hexagonal phase are highly disordered. Temperature lowering freezes the movements of the molecules and lowers the symmetry inducing structural phase transitions.
The complex ferroelastic structure existing already in the orthorhombic phase disallowed the determination of the crystal structure of the next low-temperature phases present in all these materials due to heavy crystal twinning. The results presented in this paper may be a breakthrough of this issue, as we provide the solution for the low-temperature phase of PBI after the mmmF2/m phase transition.
In the room temperature orthorhombic phase II the discrete bi-octahedral units are symmetrical due to the mirror plane passing through the bridging iodine ligands. Protonated pyrazolium cations (Pyr+) are distributed between the anionic part with the ring planes laying in (bc) crystal planes. As in Im there are two independent molecules in phase II, one of which is ordered and the other is split through the m mirror plane. Both possess large thermal displacement parameters signifying the pronounced thermally induced disorder. Fig. 2 shows the crystal packing in the Cmcm phase II of PBI.
 Fig. 2  Rearrangements of the crystal structure in PBI during the low-temperature PT (a) and temperature dependence of the crystal lattice parameters of PBI (b). 
Temperature lowering boosts huge rearrangements of the crystal structure. The PT associated with symmetry lowering to monoclinic P21/n leads to the reconstruction of the cationic substructure by rotation of the Pyr+ rings by nearly 90 degrees. This totally affects the distances between the complex anions, especially in planes perpendicular to chex. The unit cell elongates in the a-direction by almost 1.5 Å, which enlarges the separation distance between the neighboring [M2I9]3− units in (ca) crystal planes; and at the same time, it collapses in the b-direction by nearly 3 Å, reducing the distance within every second [M2I9]3− along b from 17.2 to 14.5 Å at 252.6 K. All these changes are accompanied by a significantly smaller increase of the c parameter, see Fig. 2.
Interestingly, this PT does not affect the structure of the polyhedra. In both phases (Cmcm and P21/n) the anionic substructure is assembled of face-sharing [M2I9]3− bioctahedra with M–I distances and I–M–I angles characteristic of iodoantimonates(III) and iodobismuthates(III).38 The ‘trans’ effect39 is present in both phases. Bridging Bi–Ib bonds are noticeably longer than the terminal Bi–It distances (3.2364(15) vs. 2.9755(15) Å at RT, II). This difference is preserved in phase III. Also, an average bond length, polyhedral volume, bond length distortion, and bond angle variance do not change significantly with temperature. All these parameters are presented in Table 1. Thus, the [M2I9]3− anions are stable in both phases and the symmetry lowering from m to 1 introduces only minor distortions.

In the low-temperature phase, Pyr+ interacts with the anionic component via weak N–H⋯It hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds do not form a polymeric structure. Terminal iodine ligands act as acceptors interacting with one Pyr+ cation from each side of the bi-octahedral unit. Table S3† presents the geometry of these interactions.
The structural transformations in PBI and PSI are triggered by the huge changes in cation dynamics conjugated with significant rearrangements of organic constituents. In all A3(Bi/Sb)2I9 compounds, built of small polar amines (A), the high-temperature phase (I) is characterized by easy molecular motion, including in-plane and out of plane rotations, see Fig. 3. During the (I → II) PT to the orthorhombic phase the organic molecules change their spatial arrangement by out of plane rotations up to 90°. In II the number of disordered positions seems to be reduced, however, huge atomic displacements (principal mean square atomic displacements U reaching up to 0.4 Å) as well as splitting of ring atoms show that there is still a high degree of disorder present in the organic part of the structure. PBI completely orders after transformation to the monoclinic system in III. This final ordering process involves massive reorganization among the components of the structure. Fig. S2† presents the basic building units of phases II and III drawn at the same probability level.

Most of the known R3M2I9 type (R-organic cations) compounds usually exhibit high-temperature paraelastic → ferroelastic PT. However, one can distinguish different possibilities according to the Aizu notation: (i) 6/mmmFmmm, (ii) 6/mmmF2/m and (iii) 6/mmmFmm2. Case (iii) is encountered extremely rarely and leads to the ferroelectric/ferroelastic transition. In the case of both PSI and PBI, the ferroelastic (i) transformation is present, whereas the (ii) 6/mmmF2/m is realized indirectly in PBI. As the distortion of the anionic network is extremely large it makes the parallel/ferroelectric alignment of pyrazolium dipoles difficult.
Dielectric response
The X-ray diffraction pattern shows the change in the dynamical state of cations during successive phase transitions. The reorientations of the cations are accompanied by a change of a dipole moment in a unit cell and it should affect the dielectric response of the crystal. We did indeed observe at PT temperatures remarkable changes both in the real and imaginary parts of the electric permittivity values.
The dielectric response was measured on the polycrystalline form (as a pellet with S = 19 mm2 and d = 1 mm). We failed to measure single crystal samples, both of PSI and PBI, because they break at II → III PT. Fig. 4 shows the complex dielectric permittivity as a function of temperature in the frequency range between 2 kHz and 2 MHz for PSI. In the vicinity of PT at 275 K (upon cooling run) the jump of ε′ from 140 to 80 is observed. The following PT at 233 K is also accompanied by a jump in ε′ from 55 to 25. The subsequent PT, IV → V, also exhibits a significant step change in the ε′ value of the order of 5 units.
 Fig. 4  Temperature dependence of real (a) and imaginary (b) parts of the complex electric permittivity of PSI. 
For the PBI, the paraelastic–ferroelastic PT, I → II, at 365 K (on cooling) is hardly visible in the ε′(T) and ε′′(T) functions (Fig. 5). In turn the II → III PT manifests as a distinct sickle-shaped change. Similar anomalies in the shape of the temperature dependencies of dielectric losses are also present (Fig. 5b).
 Fig. 5  Temperature dependence of real (a) and imaginary (b) parts of the complex electric permittivity of PBI. 
From the ε′′(T, ω) results the ac conductivity, σac, has been calculated according to eqn (1): σac,total = ε0ε′′ω(1)where ε0 is the free space permittivity and ω is the angular frequency.
The Arrhenius plots, lnσac (between 400 and 3300 Hz) versus reciprocal temperature, 1000/T, are shown in Fig. 6a and b. The linear dependencies indicate the semiconducting properties of both compounds with the activation energies, Ea, being equal to ca. 0.15 and 0.36 eV for PSI and PBI, respectively. It should be noted that Ea, particularly for the Sb analog, depends on frequency (Ea values are equal to ca. 0.18 and 0.11 eV at 436 and 2577 Hz, respectively).
 Fig. 6  Temperature dependence of the ac conductivity [S m−1] (log scale) from the alternating current measurements for PSI (a), PBI (b) and frequency dependence of the ac conductivity, σac, on a log–log scale, measured in the solid phase I of PSI (c) and PBI (d) at selected temperatures. 
The conductivity of PSI and PBI can be analysed based on Jonscher's law:41 σtotalac = ε0εtotal′′ω = σdc + Aωn + ε0εtotal′′ω, [S m−1](2)where σdc corresponds to the direct current conductivity, which as a material property should be independent of frequency; the second component describes the ac conductivity and A is the temperature dependent constant; 0 < n < 1 is the power exponent; ω = 2πf (f [Hz]) is the angular frequency; and ε0 is the free space permittivity. The third component defines dielectric losses related to the dielectric relaxation process and its contribution can be evaluated from eqn (2).
The frequency dependency of the ac conductivity on a log–log scale for PSI and PBI is shown in Fig. 6c and d. For semiconductors the ac contribution (Aωn) is observed as a straight line in the presented figures with a slope equal to n. The n values were estimated using eqn (2) for a frequency interval between 436 Hz and 10000 Hz. The n coefficient represents the degree of interaction of mobile electrons. Various models have been proposed by Ghosh42 on the basis of the temperature and frequency dependence of n. When the n exponent is temperature independent but frequency dependent, the quantum mechanical tunnelling (QMT) model should be taken into account.43 If the n value is both temperature and frequency dependent and a strong increase of ac conductivity with an increase in temperature is observed, then the electron migration should be described by overlapping large-polaron tunnelling (OLPT).44
The temperature variation in the exponent n is presented as an inset in Fig. 6c and d. For the presented conductivity results for PSI in phase I it is clearly seen that we deal with the last model corresponding to the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) one, because the n exponent decreases on heating of the compound between 280 and 340 K. This model initially has been developed by Pike45 for single-electron hopping and extended for two electrons by Elliot.46 According to this model the charge transport is between two localized states due to electron hopping over the potential barrier and the n exponent should decrease with an increase in temperature.
For PBI the n exponent is temperature independent but frequency dependent, which may represent the quantum mechanical tunnelling (QMT) model.43
Dielectric relaxation (PSI)
In the two phases, phases II and III, of PSI the dielectric relaxation was observed. Typical Cole–Cole plots are presented in Fig. 7. The parameters of dielectric relaxation were estimated on the basis of a four-parameter Cole–Cole (eqn (3)) function: (3)where ε0 and ε∞ are the low and high frequency limits; ω is the angular frequency (ω = 2πf, f[Hz]); τ is the macroscopic dielectric relaxation time; and α is a parameter that represents a measure of distribution of relaxation times.
 Fig. 7  The selected Cole–Cole diagrams for some temperatures in phases II and III of PSI. 
Two frequency regions of the dielectric response, between 500 and 10000 Hz and above 10000 Hz, can be distinguished. The low frequency region has been discussed above in terms of the electric conductivity, whereas the high frequency one will be discussed now in terms of the dielectric relaxation. The parameters of the dielectric relaxation were determined by a fitting procedure exclusively in phase II, because the crystal in PT at 275 K, even in the polycrystalline form, is strongly distorted due to its ferroelastic domain structure, and the dielectric results are not reproducible. The Arrhenius plot, lnτ vs. 1000/T, for the dielectric relaxation time within phases II and III of PSI is depicted in Fig. 8. The activation energy for the dielectric relaxation of PSI estimated on the basis of the Arrhenius relationship is equal to 9.54 kJ mol−1 (0.10 eV) and 33.02 kJ mol−1 (0.34 eV) for phases III and II, respectively.

Proton magnetic resonance (1H NMR)
The temperature dependencies of the nuclear relaxation time, T1, for protons in PSI and PBI are shown in Fig. 9. Two minima of the different depths at about 95 K (T1 min = 0.23 s) and 220 K (T1 min = 0.46 s) at 25 MHz Larmor frequency were found for PBI. The high-temperature minimum is clearly distorted with a significant non-linear increase in the value of T1, deviating from the usually expected linear increase. For PSI also two minima are visible. The first fully shaped one, with a minimum at about 100 K, has a depth of T1 min = 0.22 s. However, the other one is not regular, since it overlaps with the effects related to PTs at 233.3 and 274.6 K. Therefore, only the activation energy from the linear part of the T1vs. 1/T curve was estimated. For both compounds the nonlinear characteristic of T1(1/T) is visible close to PT temperatures. It seems that in this temperature range some critical phenomena are present, which atypically modulate the molecular dynamics of the pyrazolium cations during PTs. In our opinion the pseudo-C5 jumps of the pyrazolium cations contribute to high temperature minima. In turn, at the lowest temperatures, the observed minimum may be assigned to the proton dynamics in the N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds. The rate of the observed proton relaxation in the form of two minima can be described by the following formula: (4)
 Fig. 9  Temperature dependence of the 1H NMR spin lattice relaxation time, T1, for the Larmor frequency of 25 MHz for PBI and PSI. The solid lines were calculated by using the best-fit parameters eqn (4) given in Table S5.† 
In this equation ω represents the Larmor resonance angular frequency, Ci is the relaxation constant and τci is the correlation time. The temperature dependence of the correlation time is described by the Arrhenius law: τci = τ0iexp(Ea/RT), where τ0 is the correlation time at the limit infinite temperature, Ea is the height of the barrier for relaxation, and R is the gas constant. The obtained fitting parameters are presented in Table S5.† In the entire applied temperature range, the main contribution to the relaxation of protons results from the dipole–dipole interactions between all protons of the pyrazolium cations. For PSI above 150 K the Ea values are only estimated from both linear slopes.
In turn, over the phases I and II of both compounds the behavior of T1 with temperature is irregular. Within phase II nearly constant values of T1 for both studied compounds are observed (∼20 s up to 366.6 K for PSI and ∼40 s up to 370.8 K for PBI). It seems that at these temperatures the phenomenon of proton-dominant conductivity is responsible for this observation. After crossing the PT (II → I) for both PBI and PSI the T1 value distinctly lowers. It should be underlined that the most distinctive response of T1vs. temperature is clearly visible for both analogs around the PT (III → II). Drastic jumps in the T1 value confirm a significant change in the pyrrolidinium cation dynamics through these two transitions.
Electronic properties
The absorption spectrum of PBI consists of several strongly overlapping bands (Fig. S6a†). However, maxima located at 528, 444, 380, 300 and 240 nm can be distinguished. In the calculated band structure, band sets located at 2.35 eV (527 nm), 2.7 eV (459 nm), 3.6 eV (344 nm), and 4.95 eV (250 nm) are present. By comparing the energy values of these band sets with the positions of the absorption band maxima, a very good correlation between the experimental values and those calculated by the DFT method can be noted. Calculations, taking into account a spin–orbit coupling, indicate that the bandgap is equal to 2.01 eV and has an indirect character (Γ–S). However, it should be noted that the energy of the direct transition is higher only by 0.08 eV (Γ–Γ).
The bandgap has been determined using the Tauc plot: (5)where h is the Planck constant, ν is the photon frequency, α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the bandgap energy, and A is a proportionality constant.47 The 1/r parameter determines the nature of the transition.48
Depending on the r parameter, the experimentally determined bandgaps are 1.97 eV (r = 2, indirect allowed transition) and 1.89 eV (r = 3, indirect forbidden transition), while assuming a direct transition, the bandgaps are 2.13 eV (r = 1/2, direct allowed) and 2.01 eV (r = 3/2, direct forbidden) (Fig. 10a). These small differences are consistent with the data obtained from the DFT calculations. Moreover, these results are in very good agreement with those obtained by the other researchers including those presented in our previous studies.25,26,29

Projected densities of states indicate that the highest valence states are composed mainly of I(p) states, while the lowest states in the conduction band consist of bismuth p states (Fig. 11a). On the basis of this information, it can be concluded that the electron transitions observed in the absorption spectrum are I(p)–Bi(p) ligand–metal charge transfer ones. Transitions of this type explain the very strong absorption of the compound under study.
 Fig. 11  Band structure calculated and density of states (DOS) for PSI (a) and PBI (b). 
The spectrum for the Sb-containing analogue (PSI) is slightly shifted towards the ultraviolet region in comparison to that of the Bi-analogue (Fig. S6b†). One can distinguish in it two distinct maxima at 471 nm (2.63 eV) and 417 nm (2.97 eV) and two less pronounced at 250 nm (4.96 eV).
The experimentally determined bandgaps are slightly larger than the ones determined for PBI and are equal to 2.10 eV (r = 2, indirect allowed transition) and 2.00 eV (r = 3, indirect forbidden transition), while assuming a direct transition, the bandgaps are 2.30 eV (r = 1/2, direct allowed) and 2.15 eV (r = 3/2, direct forbidden) (Fig. 10b). Relatively small differences between the experimentally determined bandgap values are reflected in DFT calculations. The calculated bandgap assuming an indirect transition is 2.07 eV, while for the direct one it is 2.17 eV.
Similar to PBI, the highest valence states of PSI are composed mainly of I(p) states, whereas the lowest states in the conduction band consist of antimony p states (Fig. 11b). It can, therefore, be concluded that the I(p)–Sb(p) ligand–metal charge transfer transition is responsible for the absorption bands observed in the spectrum.
Optical polarized light observations
Initial observations under a polarizing microscope at room temperature, for both PSI and PBI, showed the presence of the ferroelastic domain structure. Therefore, we decided to undertake more systematic observations of the domain structure over a wide temperature range covering all solid-state phases. This was not an easy task because the crystals were breaking heavily during PTs. Nevertheless, it was possible to observe the presence or absence of the domain structure in the individual phases. However, the interpretation was very difficult due to a severe fracture. The crystals were measured as grown, and the plates were hexagonal in shape; in the case of PBI they were mostly hexagons with one side elongated, plate shaped (Bi), and in the case of Sb the plates were more similar to a regular hexagon. The size of a single crystal was approximately 1 × 3 × 1 mm3. For both materials (PSI and PBI) the domain observations were carried out on two samples. The first one was heated from room temperature (phase II,) to approx. 370 K (phase I). The second one was cooled from room temperature (phase II,) down to the lowest temperature phase (phase V – PSI, phase III – PBI). The domain image in phase II depended on the history of the sample. Observations of the shape of the domains and mutual orientation indicated that the initial, prototype phase possesses a hexagonal symmetry.

Fig. 12a presents the microphotographs of the domain structure in the individual phases indicated by numbers for PSI. The upper part of the figure shows the photos taken on heating and the lower part on cooling. When the crystal undergoes the II → I phase transition the clear ferroelastic structure – the light and dark strips – disappear, signifying the increase of the symmetry (paraelastic phase).

The other single crystal of PSI, which was cooled, was initially divided into small domains. During the II → III phase transitions no quantitative changes were observed, however, the volume of the crystal slightly changed. A similar situation was observed during III → IV PT – neither additional ferroelastic domains were observed nor their orientation was changed.
The most spectacular observations were made during the IV → V PT. The crystal broke into smaller parts which exhibited a clear ferroelastic domain structure with at least two different orientations of the domains.

Fig. 12b presents the microphotographs of the domain structure in the individual phases indicated by numbers for PBI. At room temperature the domains are clear and are oriented along the long edge of the single crystal taken as grown. In I, a prototype phase, the domains disappear. Another crystal was observed while cooling. In phase III the single crystal is divided into tiny domains. Moreover, the domains are oriented in different directions than in phase II. The II → III phase transition is of the first order type and consequently, we have observed a phase front, which additionally mechanically induced the ferroelastic structure.
Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized novel 0D lead-free organic–inorganic ferroelastic materials based on the pyrazolium cations: (C3N2H5)3Sb2I9 and (C3N2H5)3Bi2I9.
The compounds exhibit rich sequences of phase transitions and ferroelastic properties in a broad range of temperatures (see Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Sequence of PTs in PBI and PSI. 
Variable temperature single-crystal X-ray measurements for the Bi analogue reveal a severe rearrangement of the pyrazolium cations and distinct displacements of both organic and inorganic components in the II → III transition. (C3N2H5)3Sb2I9 shows significant dielectric anomalies (ε′ ≈ 70–140, between 2 kHz and 2 MHz) rarely encountered in centric crystals, making it a promising material for practical applications. 1HNMR (T1 spin–lattice) measurements revealed a drastic anomaly in the T1 value through the II → III PT which is explained by the essential changes in the dynamics of the cations. Both compounds reveal semiconducting properties over phase II. (C3N2H5)3Bi2I9 and (C3N2H5)3Sb2I9 demonstrate narrow bandgaps of 1.97 eV and 2.10 eV, respectively. These two new members of the lead-free family of organic–inorganic hybrids show promising optoelectronic properties.
