    , Accepted 30th September 2020First published on 30th September 2020AbstractSince 2009, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have witnessed dramatic developments with the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25% within a single decade. One bottleneck for the commercialization of PSCs is the lack of stability due to the commonly used hole transport materials (HTMs) with dopants. These hygroscopic dopants not only deteriorate the long-term stability due to moisture ingress and ion diffusion, but also increase the complexity and total cost. Therefore, the development of dopant-free HTMs is of great significance. In this work, the recent progress in dopant-free HTMs, including organic small molecules, polymers, organometallic compounds, and inorganic materials, has been systematically reviewed and summarized. To bring current dopant-free HTMs closer to the ideal ones, detailed solutions for making dopant-free HTMs more efficient, stable, and cost-effective are analyzed and discussed. In the end, we try to answer the key scientific questions such as what makes HTMs dopant-free, how to obtain the maximum PCE for a new dopant-free HTM, and what is the most efficient way to find ideal dopant-free HTMs based on the literature survey and our own understanding. With continuous efforts in developing dopant-free HTMs, PSC commercialization can be realized in the near future.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their unique advantages such as high efficiency and low cost. As a crucial part of PSCs, hole transport materials (HTMs) have a significant influence on the device efficiency and stability. Currently, one major bottleneck for PSC commercialization is the stability issue caused by dopants in HTMs, which can attract moisture and can migrate during device operation. Therefore, the development of dopant-free HTMs is of great significance. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in the molecular design and device engineering of dopant-free HTMs for n–i–p and p–i–n PSCs. To meet the commercial requirement of HTMs, detailed solutions for making dopant-free HTMs more efficient, stable, and cost-effective are further analyzed and discussed. To guide the future development of HTMs, we try to provide fundamental understandings such as what makes HTMs dopant-free, how to realize the maximum performance of new HTMs, and how should we screen for promising HTMs. We hope that this review can help the development of HTMs and pave the way for PSC commercialization.

1. Introduction
Due to the growing demand of energy consumption and the depletion of traditional fossil fuels, sustainable energy resources such as solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and tidal have drawn a great deal of interest from researchers worldwide. Among them, solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy source and can be converted into electricity by using the photovoltaic (PV) technology. Crystalline silicon-based solar cells are the first generation of PVs, which have already been commercialized with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 26.7%.1 However, silicon-based PV technologies still suffer from high manufacturing costs, high energy consumption, and heavy environmental pollution. In the past two decades, variety of alternate low-cost PV technologies, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), quantum dots solar cells, and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been rapidly developed. In particular, organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide PSCs have been one of the hottest PV topics in the past decade. The rapid evolution of perovskite PV technology has shown huge potential in combining low-cost manufacturing and high efficiency, making it a promising candidate to compete with the market-dominant silicon-based PV technology.2–4
As shown in Fig. 1a, the general chemical formula of an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite is ABX3, where the A site is a monovalent cation such as CH3NH3+ (MA+), (NH2)2CH+ (FA+), or Cs+; the B site is a divalent cation such as Pb2+ or Sn2+; and the X site is a monovalent halide anion such as Cl−, Br−, or I−. The ideal 3D perovskite has cubic symmetry, and its backbone is composed of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra with A cations located in the cuboctahedral spaces. Benefiting from the unique properties of perovskite materials such as large absorption coefficient, tunable composition and absorption edge, long charge carrier diffusion length, and efficient ambipolar charge transport, PSCs have witnessed rapid evolution.5–8 In 2009, Miyasaka and colleagues were the first to introduce MAPbI3 as a sensitizer into DSSCs, demonstrating an initial PCE of 3.8%.9 However, these devices showed poor lifetime because the iodide-/triiodide-based liquid electrolyte dissolved the perovskite particles within a few minutes. As a turning point in 2012, both Park and Snaith groups demonstrated that the liquid electrolyte could be replaced with 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), which serves as the hole transport material (HTM). The corresponding solid-state PSCs exhibited enhanced efficiencies of 9.7% and 10.9%,10,11 as well as much improved stability. Since then, a series of PCE breakthroughs have been achieved (as shown in Fig. 1b).11–18 In 2013, Snaith's group reported a PCE of 15.4% for PSCs using thermally evaporated MAPbI3−xClx.13 In 2014, a PCE of 19.3% was realized by Yang's group in planar PSCs through interfacial engineering.19 In 2015, Seok and co-workers developed high-quality FAPbI3 films and obtained a high PCE of 20.2%.20 In 2016, Grätzel's group used polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the template to fabricate excellent perovskite films, through which a champion PCE of 21.6% (certified PCE: 21.02%) could be achieved.21 In 2017, Seok et al. introduced additional iodide ions to decrease the concentration of deep-level defects, and FA-based PSCs showed impressive PCE (certified) of 22.1%.22 In 2018, You's group boosted the PCE to 23.7%.1,23 Within one decade, the PCE record for PSCs has been pushed to 25.2%, which is fairly close to that of Si PV cells (26.7%).1

Typical PSC devices consist of a perovskite absorber, HTM, electron transport material (ETM), and electrodes. When a PSC is illuminated, photogenerated electrons/holes in the perovskite absorber are transferred to the ETM/HTM and are selectively collected by the anode/cathode.24–26 Due to the ambipolar charge transport property of perovskites, both n–i–p (conventional) and p–i–n (inverted) types of PSCs can work effectively.27,28 The most widely investigated PSC structures are shown in Fig. 2. Since PSCs originated from solid-state DSSCs, mesoporous n–i–p PSCs with the structure of FTO/ETM/meso-ETM/perovskite/HTM/Au (Fig. 2a) have been investigated since the very beginning. To simplify the fabrication process, planar n–i–p (FTO/ETM/perovskite/HTM/Au) (Fig. 2b) and p–i–n (ITO/HTM/perovskite/ETM/Ag) (Fig. 2c) PSCs have been developed. Currently, the certified efficiencies for planar n–i–p and p–i–n PSCs are >23%23,29–31 and ∼22%,32–34 respectively.

As a significant milestone in the history of PSCs, spiro-OMeTAD was successfully explored as the HTM for fabricating high-performance PSCs. In principle, the roles of HTMs are to extract and transport holes to the cathodes. The general requirements include (1) proper energy-level alignment with perovskite absorbers for the efficient extraction of holes as well as effective blocking of electrons; (2) high mobility for efficient hole transport; (3) good solubility in common solvents for facile processing; (4) smooth and pinhole-free film morphology; (5) high optical, thermal, chemical, air, and water stability; and (6) low-cost production. It is worth noting that the requirements for HTMs may vary in different device configurations. For n–i–p PSCs, HTMs need to be coated on perovskite films, and they act as a capping layer to protect the perovskite from moisture ingress, and therefore, high hydrophobicity is required. In contrast, for p–i–n PSCs, only moderate hydrophobicity is desired, because high hydrophobicity may cause wetting and crystallization issues. Moreover, HTMs should be insoluble in DMF and DMSO; otherwise, the HTM layer will be washed away during perovskite deposition. Another difference is the bandgap requirement for HTMs, i.e., the bandgap of the HTM for p–i–n PSCs should be sufficiently wide to avoid the absorption of visible light.
For n–i–p-type PSCs, doped spiro-OMeTAD is the most commonly used HTM for achieving high efficiencies. The chemical structure of spiro-OMeTAD is shown in Fig. 3. Spiro-OMeTAD possesses a bandgap of 2.98 eV and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of around −5.1 eV.16,35 Spiro-OMeTAD has good solubility in organic solvents such as chlorobenzene and toluene. Against common intuition, spiro-OMeTAD is not totally amorphous but a semicrystalline p-type semiconductor, which affords a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 125 °C and melting temperature of 248 °C.35 Apart from these desired properties, pristine spiro-OMeTAD suffers from low hole mobility (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and low conductivity (10−8 S cm−1).36–38 The low mobility of spiro-OMeTAD can be ascribed to the spirofluorene core and triphenylamine (TPA) arms. The orthogonal structure of spirofluorene hinders the formation of close π–π stacking, while the propeller-like TPA results in a large intermolecular distance. All these structural characteristics are present because of the use of dopants that are indispensable for spiro-OMeTAD HTMs. Common dopants added to increase the mobility of the spiro-OMeTAD film include 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tri(bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide) (FK209).39,40 The basic p-doping process is based on the charge transfer reaction between the HTM and the dopant.41,42 Due to the high electron affinity of the p-type dopant, electrons from the HOMO of spiro-OMeTAD molecules are extracted, resulting in an increased hole density and conductivity of the HTMs. However, dopants result in not only increased hole transport property but also severe stability problems as follows. (1) LiTFSI, FK209, and t-BP are hygroscopic and can accelerate perovskite degradation.43–46 (2) Due to its high boiling point, t-BP evaporates slowly and may corrode both perovskite and HTM films, resulting in the rapid degradation of device performance.30,47 Moreover, t-BP plasticizes spiro-OMeTAD, leading to a significant drop in Tg (from 125 to ∼50 °C), and therefore, spiro-OMeTAD becomes unstable toward thermal stress.48 (3) Post oxidation is required for the doping of spiro-OMeTAD, but O2 may also damage the perovskite. The oxidation process also causes reproducibility problems due to difficulty in the precise control of the oxidative level.25,26,49 (4) The dopants are not covalently bonded with the HTMs, which can cause ion diffusion and adversely impact the long-term stability.42,50,51 (5) Spiro-OMeTAD is extremely expensive (up to ∼500 $ per g) due to multistep synthesis and sublimation purification.18,25 The additional doping and oxidation processes further increase the total complexity and cost, making spiro-OMeTAD unsuitable for the large-scale fabrication of PSCs. It is worth noting that much progress has been made in looking for alternative dopants with good performance, low costs, inert byproducts, and good operability. New dopants such as ionic liquids, Brønsted/Lewis acids, metal-based salts, oxidized radical cation salts, tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) derivatives, and other miscellaneous schemes have been reported, which have been systematically discussed in Schloemer's review paper.45

Similar to spiro-OMeTAD, poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) is the most commonly used HTM for p–i–n-type PSCs. Typically, a thin layer of undoped PTAA HTM is used. However, in some cases, PTAA needs to be doped to deliver high PCEs for PSCs due to its low hole mobility of around 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.52,53 Very recently, Bakr and co-workers reported a certified PCE of 22.3% with PTAA HTM in p–i–n PSCs.32 PTAA has also been used in some high-efficiency n–i–p PSCs.22,54 However, the even higher cost of PTAA (1980 $ per g) makes it unviable toward the mass production of PSCs.55
With the recent advances in PSCs, most of the current research efforts have been aimed toward large-area commercialized production.24,39,40,56–58 Since developing dopant-free, efficient, stable, and low-cost HTMs is highly desirable for the commercialization of PSCs, there is still a need to systematically investigate and summarize dopant-free HTMs that can be used in PSCs. This review provides an updated overview of the progress made in the development of dopant-free HTMs for PSCs and an outlook for their future development.
2. Organic dopant-free HTMs
As a mainstream in the design of new HTMs, organic HTMs have been extensively investigated owing to the success of doped spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA. Usually, the energy levels, hole mobility, and other physical properties of organic HTMs can be easily tuned via molecular engineering. By learning from the successful experience in designing organic semiconductors for organic PVs,59–62 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and DSSCs,57,63,64 researchers have developed hundreds of new HTM candidates, which can be classified into small molecules, polymers, and organometallic compounds. However, most organic HTMs suffer from low hole mobility, and the use of dopants is still inevitable. Since the purpose of adding dopants is to increase the conductivity of HTMs, the basic requirement for dopant-free HTMs is high hole mobility. Note that n–i–p and p–i–n PSCs require different HTM design principles. The HTM thickness is typically over 50 nm for n–i–p devices, whereas it is usually below 20 nm for p–i–n devices,56,65,66 which implies that the mobility demand for HTMs is much lower in p–i–n PSCs. To increase the hole mobility, molecular design strategies such as counterions,38,67 donor–acceptor (D–A) alternation, and expansion of π–π conjugation have been proposed.50,51,68–71
Since the importance of developing dopant-free HTMs has been widely recognized, numerous new materials have been reported.72–74 In this section, we focus on representative dopant-free organic HTMs that show comparable PCEs with doped spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA. The chemical structures of typical organic dopant-free HTMs are shown in Fig. 4, 6, 8 and 11, with the corresponding properties summarized in Tables 1–4. It is worth noting that there are blanks in the tables since the related parameters are not explicitly stated in the original report. The photovoltaic parameters represent the champion device properties.

2.1. Small molecules

2.1.1. Conventional (n–i–p) PSCs. 
The general function of HTMs is not only to extract and transport holes but also to block electrons. Therefore, the energy-level alignment between the HTM and perovskite is important. The HOMO level of the HTM should be slightly higher than the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) should be sufficiently high for electron blocking.75,76 For efficient hole transport, high hole mobility is required. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of HTMs used in n–i–p PSCs is beneficial for protecting the perovskite from water ingress. Therefore, the HTM layer is crucial for device performance and stability.
In early 2014, the first undoped molecular HTM was reported based on a tetrathiafulvalene derivative (TTF-1),77 where four long alkyl chains were introduced in order to increase the solubility. The resultant TTF-1 showed a suitable HOMO level of −5.05 eV and remarkable hole mobility of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Due to the inherent π–π stacking, strong S–S interaction, and high mobility, PSCs based on pristine TTF-1 HTM showed a PCE of 11.03% without requiring any dopants, which was comparable to that of the device with doped spiro-OMeTAD (11.4%). Benefiting from the hydrophobic alkyl chains as well as dopant-free strategy, unencapsulated PSCs based on TTF-1 showed much improved stability when stored in ambient air with a relative humidity of around 40%. Another well-known early exploration of dopant-free HTM was TIPS-pentacene.79 As an extensively investigated p-type semiconductor, TIPS-pentacene featuring the cofacial-stacking mode ensures a superior hole mobility of over 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. The HOMO level of TIPS-pentacene is −5.40 eV, which is close to the valence band of MAPbI3 (−5.44 eV). PSCs based on undoped TIPS-pentacene afforded a PCE of 11.82%, which was much higher than that of devices based on spiro-OMeTAD doped with the LiTFSI dopant and t-BP (9.77%).
Motivated by the device performance based on spiro-OMeTAD,113,114 some spiro-like dopant-free HTMs have been proposed. By replacing the benzene rings in spirofluorene with a thiophene unit, Frankevicius et al. designed spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene]-cored HTM1 as a new dopant-free HTM.78 Without any dopants, the HTM1-based device reached a PCE of 13.4% after light soaking, which is slightly lower than the PCE of the cells with doped spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM (15%). Wang et al. used spiro[dibenzo[c,h]xanthene-7,9′-fluorene] as the central core to build new HTMs named X61 and X62.97 Both X61 and X62 have a proper HOMO level at around −5.1 eV. Although the hole mobility was only 7.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, pristine-X62-based PSCs still achieved a PCE of 15.9%, while devices based on undoped X61 only delivered a PCE of 8%. The close π–π interaction between the X62 molecules was explained to be the main reason for the better hole transport and device performance. In 2018, Yin et al. synthesized two N,N′-bicarbazole-cored HTMs named 3,6 BCz-OMeTAD and 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD.95 The N,N′-bicarbazole unit consists of two carbazole groups connected by an N–N bond, which behaved as a perpendicularly twisted conformation similar to that of spirobifluorene. Owing to the low price of the carbazole starting material, the synthesis costs for 3,6 BCz-OMeTAD and 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD are only 8.55 and 14.00 $ per g, respectively. Further, 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD afforded high Tg of 145 °C and hole mobility of 9.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Further, 1 cm2 PSCs based on 3,6 BCz-OMeTAD and 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD achieved impressive PCEs of 17.0% and 17.6%, respectively (Fig. 5a). Good long-term stability could also be realized using devices based on 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD, i.e., 90% of the initial PCE could be retained for unencapsulated devices after storage in the dark under 30% relative humidity (RH) for 85 days. Importantly, only 29% PCE drop was observed upon continuous light soaking after the device based on 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD was exposed to 50% RH and 50 °C.

The doping process in HTMs is usually accompanied with redox reactions. Taking spiro-OMeTAD as the example, the pristine spiro-OMeTAD forms a radical cation (spiro-OMeTAD˙+O2˙−) when it reacts with oxygen or initiated by a perovskite and then the TFSI anion traps/stabilizes the radical cation (spiro-OMeTAD˙+TFSI˙−). The singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of the radical cation species is slightly deeper than the HOMO of the pristine material, providing a thermodynamic driving force for the charge hopping between the pristine spiro-OMeTAD and radical cation species (Fig. 3b). This process repeats across the HTM thin film when the holes are extracted from the perovskite layer. The conductivity and mobility increase by multiple orders of magnitude under suitable dopant concentrations. Actually, it is the radical cation species generated by LiTFSI and FK209 that are responsible for the improved hole transport properties. For more detailed information about the doping process, the reader may refer to the articles by Schloemer et al.45 and Lüssem et al.115 Similarly, by increasing the cation concentration, HTMs with enhanced hole mobility and conductivity can be realized. Based on this idea, some dopant-free HTMs have been developed by introducing counterions to HTM molecules to improve their intrinsic mobility. Zhang et al. modified the end of the alkyl chains of AS37 from the neutral methyl group to quaternary ammonium coupled with TFSI− counterions.38 Unlike doped triarylamine-based HTMs, X44 had no radical cations even though TFSI− was used. The achieved HTM X44 showed one order of magnitude higher hole conductivity (9.03 × 10−4 S cm−1) than X41 (8.95 × 10−5 S cm−1). Therefore, X44 HTM endowed PSCs with a much higher PCE (15.2%) compared with those with undoped AS37 HTM (7.8% PCE). The device with X44 showed good stability at the maximum power point (MPP) tracking condition by maintaining more than 90% of its initial performance in the dark without encapsulation after 15 days (<20% humidity). The thermal stability test revealed that the X44-based PSCs degraded rapidly at a temperature of over 70 °C. Besides, 60% of the initial efficiency of an X44-based device was maintained after continuous light soaking in the ambient condition (∼50% humidity) for 1 day. Following the same strategy, Cheng et al. synthesized a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-cored acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type conjugated HTM (M3), featuring a pyridinium cation and TFSI− counterions as the terminal.82 The A–D–A-type molecules generally consist of an electron-donating unit (D) as the central building block and two electron-accepting units (A) as the ending groups. In the backbone of these A–D–A molecules, oligothiophene or other electron-donating units are chosen as the bridges to link the central donor unit and the terminal acceptor units. As proven in OPVs, the A–D–A strategy is useful for fabricating organic semiconductors.61,116,117 By using appropriate D, A, and bridge units, enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), well-tuned energy levels, and desired film morphology can be obtained. Moreover, the charge transport properties can also be improved by the careful modification of the backbone and π bridges, such as introducing an appropriate degree of fluorination, forming a nanofibrillar network by shortening the sidechain length, maintaining a face-on preferential orientation, and forming proper aggregation facilitated by intermolecular interactions among the heteroatoms.118M3 exhibited a deep HOMO level of −5.38 eV combined with a hole mobility of 2.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. PSCs using (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 as the absorber and undoped M3 as the HTM afforded a PCE of 15.6%. To further improve the device performance, a blend of M3 with PC70BM to form a bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type HTM was explored for PSCs. As a result, JSC increased from 20.7 mA cm−2 to 22.2 mA cm−2, leading to a higher PCE of 17.3%. However, the incorporation of PC70BM decreased the long-term stability due to the formation of microsized aggregation of PC70BM clusters. Since the A–D–A-type conjugated molecules can also be used as the donor materials for OPVs, the same group continued to develop the conjugation-extended molecule of M7-TFSI to work as both dopant-free HTM for PSCs and donor for OPVs.89 By simply introducing TFSI− as a noncoordinating counterion, M7-TFSI showed three times improved mobility. In PSCs, M7-TFSI delivered a champion efficiency of 17.7% without any dopants (Fig. 5b). Moreover, due to the enhanced hydrophobicity, M7-TFSI-based PSCs showed better stability (retaining 64% of the initial PCE) than that of spiro-OMeTAD-based devices (retaining 37% of the initial PCE) when stored in the dark with a humidity of around 30% and temperature of 25 °C. For OPV applications, M7-TFSI afforded a PCE of 6.89%. These results indicate the potential of using the counterionization strategy for developing dopant-free HTMs.
Another important strategy for developing dopant-free HTMs is to construct D–A alternating electronic structures. The D–A strategy has been extensively investigated and widely adopted in the OPV and OLED fields. Many successful segments have been developed for constructing D–A alternating organic semiconductors. The development of D–A HTMs is highly influenced by these pioneering studies. For more details about the origin and progress of D–A materials, please refer to the publications by Walker et al.,119 Mishra et al.,120 Lin et al.,121 and Dang et al.118 Tuning the energy levels of D–A HTM is advantageous, since the HOMO level is mainly dependent on the energy level of the donor unit, while the LUMO levels depend on the energy level of the acceptor unit. The D–A molecular backbone is conceived to be desirable for dopant-free HTMs, mainly due to the strong ICT and high dipole moment, which could induce self-doping and built-in potential to boost charge extraction.122 Many donor units like BDT, phenoxazine (POZ), and dithienosilole (DTS) have been used to couple with A units such as malononitrile, ethylrhodanine, and benzothiadiazole (BT) to construct the D–A molecules. In 2015, Liu et al. explored the D–A-structured molecule of DOR3T-TBDT as a dopant-free HTM, featuring a hole mobility as high as 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1.81 The optimized PSCs showed a PCE of 14.9%, even better than the performance of doped-spiro-OMeTAD-based devices (14%) under the same fabrication conditions. By replacing the bridge units of DOR3T-TBDT from oligomer thiophene to DTS, the same group developed a newly designed DERDTS-TBDT, whose dopant-free devices further pushed the PCE to 16.2%.88 Besides BDT derivatives, D–A molecules with DTS as the donor and BT as the acceptor are other promising candidates. Son's group reported molecules such as 2F and DFBT(DTS-FBTTh2)2 for HTM applications.49,86 The DFBT(DTS-FBTTh2)2-based PSCs exhibited a high efficiency of 17.3% and improved stability without encapsulation, i.e., 80% of the initial PCE was retained after 500 h under 60% RH and light soaking of 1 sun. Another important advantage of the D–A alternating strategy is the enhancement of the intramolecular dipole–dipole effect. The tricyanovinylene (A)-substituted di-TPA (D) molecule of BTPA-TCNE was found to facilitate charge separation by forming zwitterionic resonance in the ground state due to the strong ICT between the dipolar chromophores. Such an effect was revealed by X-ray crystallography and transient absorption spectroscopies.87 With BTPA-TCNE as the dopant-free HTM, the resultant PSCs showed a PCE of 16.94% (Fig. 5c). In 2017, Paek et al. designed a star-shaped FA-CN with fused quinolizino acridine as the central donor, alkyl-substituted terthiophenes as the bridge, and malononitriles as the accepting ends.50 Optimized PSCs with dopant-free FA-CN showed a remarkable PCE of 18.9% with impressive long-term stability (retaining 65% of the initial PCE) for an unsealed device maintained under continuous illumination in an argon atmosphere for 1300 h. By adopting a triazatruxene core, Rakstys et al. developed the star-shaped KR321.90 PSCs with KR321 showed an improved PCE of 19% due to the highly ordered face-on organization derived from the C3h symmetry, which can facilitate vertical charge carrier transport (Fig. 5d). In 2018, Xu et al. reported a simple D–A HTM (YN2) with a thienopyrazine unit as the accepting core and two TPAs as the donating arms.98YN2 could form a smooth film on top of the perovskite layer, endowing PSCs with an impressive PCE of 19.27%. Moreover, YN2-based devices showed good stability, retaining ∼90% of their initial efficiency over 1000 h (without encapsulation, in air, at 25 °C, and under 40–45% humidity).
Apart from the D–A structure, the D–D′-structured HTMs have drawn extensive attention due to their superior device performance. In general, D–D′ electronic materials consist of two electron-donating units that offer better molecular packing and efficient charge transport. Grätzel and co-workers developed several star-shaped D–D′-structured HTMs, such as Z1011, Z1013, Z34, and ST1.83–85,123 Among them, Z1011 with two TPA derivatives attached to the central TPA through the CC bonds showed the best efficiency of 16.3% without any doping. Featuring high Tg of 149.4 °C, Z1011-based devices maintained over 50% of the initial PCE after 1008 h at room temperature in dry air without encapsulation. In 2019, Chen et al. developed a similar HTM called CJ-01,103 which afforded good solubility, pinhole-free film, 3D network for charge transport, and capability of generating metastable cavities due to its highly twisted structure. The undoped CJ-01-based PSCs showed a champion PCE of 18.56%. A simple, fused-ring, polycyclic hydrocarbon-based material (PCA-1) was designed by adopting a 2,5,9,12-tetra(tert-butyl)diacenaphtho[1,2-b:1′,2′-d]thiophene core and four t-butyl sidechains.68 After thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min under an N2 atmosphere, PCA-1 exhibited dramatically increased hole mobility from 8.3 × 10−5 to 8.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PCA-1-based mesoporous PSCs exhibited a PCE of 18.17%. Benefiting from the dense, full-coverage film morphology and inherent hydrophobicity, 84.5% of the initial efficiency was maintained after 400 h under continuous 1 sun AM1.5G illumination. Due to the good π–π stacking of the planar conjugated backbone, efficient charge transport can be achieved by choosing an appropriate building block. Therefore, many new molecules have been developed, such as FBA3,106IDF-SFXPh,107PhCz-4MeOTPA,104ACE-QA-ACE,101TPA-ANT-TPA,51α,β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD, and C202.102,105 Shen et al. developed a semi-locked tetrathienylethene (TTE)-based dopant-free HTM named TTE-2.110 Due to the hybridization of orthogonal and planar conformation, TTE-2 exhibited a high hole mobility of 6.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. PSCs based on dopant-free TTE-2 exhibited a promising efficiency of 20.4% (Fig. 5e).
Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) is a planar electron-donating unit containing heteroatoms of nitrogen and sulfur. The occupied p orbitals of N and S are conjugated with the p orbitals of the aromatic unit, making DTP a p-type semiconductor. Moreover, the electronic structure, crystallinity, and thermal stability of the DTP derivatives can be easily tuned via molecular engineering. Therefore, DTP can act as an efficient building block for developing dopant-free HTMs. Wang et al. reported a bulky planar M129, featuring a DTP core coupled with two indeno[1,2-b]carbazole arms.108 Possessing high Tg of 170 °C, M129 also showed a high hole mobility of 6.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, enabling an efficiency of 17.5% for dopant-free M129-based devices. Tang's group made great efforts in developing cost-effective DTP-cored dopant-free HTMs for fabricating high-efficiency PSCs.111,112 By taking advantage of the high hole mobility of the DTP core, a thiophene spacer was introduced to couple with the TPA end for energy-level optimization. The N substituents of the DTP core (DTPC8-ThTPA, DTPC13-ThTPA, and DTP-C6Th) were screened for higher Tg and better film formation. A careful replacement of the n-octyl chain (DTPC8-ThTPA) with branched 5-ethyldodecane (DTPC13-ThTPA) on the DTP core leads to a deeper HOMO level, smoother film, and higher hole mobility. DTPC13-ThTPA showed an impressive PCE of 20.38% (Fig. 5f).111 Moreover, the synthesis cost of DTPC13-ThTPA was estimated to be 14.36 $ per g, which is much lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD. Further, Yin et al. introduced hexylthiophene to modify the conjunction area as well as molecular stacking.112 The newly synthesized DTP-C6Th showed a better hole mobility of 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and more efficient hole extraction in comparison to those afforded by spiro-OMeTAD. The combinational device optimization strategy that included PMMA passivation and perovskite composition modification boosted the performance of the PSC device based on dopant-free DTP-C6Th up to a PCE of 21.04% (Fig. 5g), which is—to the best of our knowledge—the highest PCE for n–i–p PSCs based on small-molecule dopant-free HTMs that have been reported so far.


2.1.2. Inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. 
Apart from general requirements, HTMs used in inverted PSCs should have orthogonal solubility with the perovskite precursor. In other words, the HTM films deposited on the substrates should be robust during perovskite fabrication. However, DMF and DMSO used to prepare the perovskite precursor solution can dissolve many small-molecule HTMs, which limits the choice of HTMs for inverted devices.
Organic–inorganic hybrid salts seem to be appropriate candidates for use as inverted HTMs since a suitable energy level and selective solubility can be simultaneously obtained. Shang et al. reported an alkanediylsulfonate disodium salt with a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dipyrrole core.132 The 3-F-br-4C molecule could form a thin film (8 nm) with a small root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 1.5 nm. Besides, the 3-F-br-4C film coated on ITO showed limited absorption in the visible region, making it suitable for use in inverted PSCs. The corresponding PSC afforded a PCE of 17.2% with negligible hysteresis.
Another big family is HTMs with methylthio-substituted phenylamine. The introduction of S atoms can effectively passivate perovskite defects by forming coordination bonds with Pb2+ vacancies. Chen et al. reported two HTMs containing a tetraphenyl core and four arylamine arms, namely, TPP-OMeTAD and TPP-SMeTAD.129 By replacing the methoxy group with the methylthio group, TPP-SMeTAD showed a deeper HOMO level and increased Pb–S interaction with the perovskite, leading to enhanced charge extraction and surface passivation. The PSCs based on undoped TPP-SMeTAD showed an efficiency of 16.6% with minimal hysteresis, while the PCE of the TPP-OMeTAD device was 14.6% (Fig. 7a and b). Similarly, Zhang et al. reported an HTM based on fluorene and methylthiophenylamine (denoted as FMT).136FMT showed almost no absorption in the visible region with a relatively low cost of 41.8 $ per g. Planar p–i–n PSCs based on dopant-free FMT exhibited a high PCE of 19.06%, while the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS)-based control device afforded a PCE of only 13.9%. Recently, Jiang et al. designed and synthesized a new tetraphenylethylene-based HTM, namely, TPE-S.141 This TPE-S film facilitated perovskite crystallization and reduced interfacial recombinations. The inverted CsPbI2Br-based all-inorganic PSCs demonstrated a high efficiency of 15.4%, while FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3-based inverted PSCs afforded an outstanding PCE of 21%.

Similar to the small molecules reported for n–i–p devices, incorporating a proper planar core is an effective method to develop efficient HTMs for inverted PSCs. In 2016, Huang et al. presented a rigid and fully conjugated molecule consisting a C3h truxene core and arylamine terminals, namely, Trux-OMeTAD.69 This dopant-free HTM film exhibited a pristine hole mobility of 2.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which increased to 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 after annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. The best device yielded a high PCE of 18.6% with VOC of 1.02 V, JSC of 23.2 mA cm−2, and FF of 79%. Chen et al. reported two HTMs consisting of a BDT core and two phenothiazine (PTZ) or POZ units as the terminal donor units, which were abbreviated as BDT-PTZ and BDT-POZ, respectively.134 Millimeter-sized single crystals were obtained to investigate the molecular packing mode through single-crystal XRD analysis. When small-molecule chromophores assemble in the solid state, they usually form H-type or J-type aggregations, depending on the relative alignment of the transition dipole moments on the adjacent molecules. In H-type aggregations, molecules stack predominantly in the face-to-face manner, while J-type aggregations form when molecules stack in a head-to-tail arrangement.142 Although BDT-PTZ forms H-type aggregations while BDT-POZ forms J-type aggregations (Fig. 7d), the BDT-POZ molecule exhibits shorter N–N distance, which may facilitate hole hopping between the molecules since intermolecular charge hopping usually occurs between the N-containing groups. This result is consistent with the mobility test, where BDT-POZ exhibited a hole mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the value for BDT-PTZ was only 9.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Finally, the efficiencies for dopant-free BDT-PTZ and BDT-POZ were 18.26% and 19.16% (Fig. 7c), respectively.
Besides planar cores, a spiro-type conformation can also be effective in designing dopant-free HTMs. In 2019, Cao et al. designed a dopant-free HTM (DFH) by linking fluorene-bridged TPA to a 1,3-dioxolane group via an sp3-hybridized carbon.135 The DFH could induce intermolecular C–H⋯O and C–H⋯π interactions between the neighboring dioxane groups (Fig. 7f and g), which enabled amorphous DFH to transform into paracrystalline dimers when heated above Tg (120 °C). The intrinsic hole mobility of DFH is as high as 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the synthesis cost is only 3 $ per g. Inverted PSCs with DFH showed a high efficiency of 20.6% without any dopants or interlayers (Fig. 7e).
By taking advantage of both large planar conjugated structures and D–A strategy, Wang et al. developed two novel HTMs with imide-functionalized thiophene (MPA-BTI) or thienothiophene (MPA-BTTI) derivatives as the A core and TPA as the D terminal.137 Although MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI showed similar optical and electrochemical properties, the consequential differences in the molecular configuration and film morphology significantly affected perovskite crystallization and interface quality. The MPA-BTTI-based inverted PSCs exhibited a remarkable PCE of 21.17% (Fig. 7h–j), which is also the highest recorded PCE for dopant-free small-molecule HTMs for p–i–n PSCs.

2.2. Polymers
Apart from small molecules, polymers are also promising candidates for dopant-free HTMs. Benefiting from a long conjugated chain, charges can be transported through both intermolecular hopping and intramolecular transfer. Therefore, polymeric HTMs usually have high hole mobility without the need for dopants despite some inevitable problems such batch-to-batch variation in molecular weights and necessity of tedious purification. In general, polymeric HTMs can be categorized into homopolymers and copolymers. In this section, we will also discuss these polymeric HTMs according to the device structures.

2.2.1. Conventional (n–i–p) PSCs. 
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is an attractive HTM with suitable optoelectronic properties and high hole mobility. However, the strong electronic coupling, poor physical contact, and undesirable nonradiative recombination loss at the perovskite/P3HT interface limit the device performance. To overcome these issues, a double-layered halide architecture (DHA) was proposed by Jung et al. in 2019, in which an ultrathin wide-bandgap halide was inserted between a narrow-bandgap halide absorbing layer and P3HT (Fig. 9a–c).55 By simply spin-coating n-hexyl trimethyl ammonium bromide onto the perovskite surface, a wide-bandgap halide layer was formed to promote the self-assembly of P3HT. The van der Waals interactions between the P3HT and perovskite effectively reduced recombinations at the interface. An amazing PCE of 23.3% for dopant-free P3HT-based PSCs was obtained with the help of the DHA strategy, along with a stabilized PCE of 23.0% under MPP tracking. Another interesting series of HTM polymers were designed by grafting hole-transporting blocks onto polyvinyl or polystyrene mainchains. Xu et al. designed a nonconjugated polymer HTM by integrating polyvinyl with a carbazole-based sidechain, namely, PVCz-OMeDAD.143PVCz-OMeDAD can be easily synthesized via free-radical polymerization at a low cost of 12.06 $ per g. Further, FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3-based n–i–p PSCs employing undoped PVCz-OMeDAD as the HTM afforded a high PCE of up to 16.09%. By introducing methoxytriphenylamine-conjugated thiophene (HTM-P1) or 3,6-triphenylamine-substituted carbazole moiety (P2) as the sidechains onto a polystyrene backbone, Wu and co-workers developed two dopant-free polymer HTMs, which afforded PCEs of 17.2% and 18.45% for dopant-free HTM based PSCs.144,145

Aiming to effectively extract holes as well as passivate perovskite defects, Zhang et al. designed a copolymer (DTB) by coupling the 2,5-di-2-ethylhexyloxy-1,4-phenylene unit with a bithiophene one.146 Due to the ideal edge-on molecule orientation and short distance with the perovskite (Fig. 9d–f), this undoped polymer HTM afforded PSCs with impressive JSC of 25.50 mA cm−2 and good PCE of 19.68% (certified PCE: 19.5%). By introducing 3% diethylene glycol (DEG) groups into DTB, the same group developed a more efficient polymeric HTM named DTB(3%DEG).147 Due to the stronger lamellar packing despite the weaker intermolecular π–π stacking, a doubled hole mobility (1.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and better PCE (19.65% to 20.19%) could be obtained for devices based on dopant-free DTB(3%DEG) HTM. Zhang et al. reported a series of cost-effective copolymers (P1, P2, and P3) constructed by BDT and benzene/thiophene units.148 The fluorination on the BDT unit in P3 enables a closer face-on orientation due to noncovalent interactions such as F⋯H, F⋯S, and F⋯π, which leads to better hole mobility and conductivity. A champion PCE of 20.3% was obtained for devices based on undoped P3.
Cui et al. constructed a series of D–A copolymers based on carbazole and BT.149 By introducing methoxy sidechains into the BT unit, PCDTBT1 resulted in reduced charge recombinations at the perovskite/HTM interface due to defect passivation. A superior PCE of up to 19.1% was achieved using undoped PCDTBT1 as the HTM.
As proven in small-molecule dopant-free HTMs, BDT is a promising building block for developing p-type semiconductors. Liao et al. combined BDT with benzo[1,2-d;4,5-d′]bistriazole to get a D–A copolymer called pBBTa-BDT1.150 This HTM afforded worthwhile interchain interactions, strong quinoidal π character, and desired π-face-on packing mode. PSCs with pBBTa-BDT1 showed a PCE of 14.5%. Park and co-workers focused on the sidechain engineering of BDT and BT units; further, several high-performance dopant-free HTMs such as RCP,151asy-PBTBDT,152PTEG, and alkoxy-PTEG have been reported.70,71 The green-solvent-processable asy-PBTBDT afforded a hole mobility of 1.13 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PCE of 18.3%. By tuning the solubility of the HTM with a tetraethylene glycol group on the BT unit, a novel polymeric dopant-free HTM (PTEG) was developed and the planar n–i–p PSC exhibited an impressive efficiency of 19.8%. They further synthesized alkoxy-PTEG with good solubility in nonaromatic solvents such as 3-methylcyclohexanone (3-MC). Moreover, alkoxy-PTEG showed the capability of chelating lead ions with a moderate binding constant of 2.76 M−1. In an SnO2-based planar PSC, a high PCE of 21.2% could be obtained with the help of 2-methyl anisole. Hou et al. developed a bilayer strategy to use tantalum-doped tungsten oxide (Ta-WOx) and PDCBT to act as the HTM (Fig. 9g–i),153 which afforded a surprisingly small interface barrier and formed quasi-ohmic contacts, leading to an impressive PCE of up to 21.2% as well as over 1000 h of light stability (retaining 95% of the initial efficiency) for an unencapsulated device tested under continuous 1 sun illumination in N2.


2.2.2. Inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. 

PEDOT:PSS and PTAA are the most common HTMs used for PSCs with the p–i–n configuration. However, stability issues caused by the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS as well as the high cost of PTAA (1980 $ per g) greatly hinder their applications.53,165,166 Very recently, Zheng et al. reported a PTAA-based inverted PSC with a high PCE of 23% (certified PCE: 22.3%).32 By adding surface-anchoring alkylamine ligands (AALs) as grain and interface modifiers, they achieved simultaneously suppressed nonradiative carrier recombination, prominent (100) orientation, lower trap-state density, and enhanced carrier mobilities and diffusion lengths (Fig. 10a and b).

Among the various polymeric HTMs, conjugated polyelectrolytes consisting of the π-delocalized backbone and charged pendant groups seem to be a good choice due to their good wettability and low-temperature solution processability. Li et al. reported homopolymerized P3CT-CH3NH2 and P3CT-Na polyelectrolytes to serve as efficient HTMs in inverted PSCs.67 Through counterions and solvent selection, the aggregation control of P3CT-CH3NH2 was performed. As a result, the device performance was considerably improved to 19.6% (17.1%) on a rigid substrate and 18.2% (12.6%) on a flexible substrate when P3CT-CH3NH2 (P3CT-Na) was used as the HTM (Fig. 10c–e). Similarly, Zhang et al. designed TB(MA) with CH3NH3+ as the end-capping unit.163 This is because CH3NH3+ is a constituent of the perovskite absorber, which can get easily degraded under thermal stress and leave CH3NH3+ vacancies. The CH3NH3+ cations on the sidechain sharing the same ammonium groups with the perovskite materials may serve as defect passivation agents, leading to reduced traps and enhanced device efficiencies. The resultant PSC delivered a PCE of 19.76% as well as good long-term stability (retaining 84% of the initial PCE of the device without encapsulation) after 30 days of storage in an inert atmosphere. Wan et al. developed two novel copolymers by combining 9,9-alkyl-carboxylated fluorene with 2,2′-bithiophene (PFDT-COOH) or 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene units (PFDT-2F-COOH).164 The inverted PSCs based on undoped PFDT-COOH exhibited a PCE of 20.64%, with VOC of 1.079 V, JSC of 24.78 mA cm−2, and FF of 77.2%. Featuring fluorination on the bithiophene unit, PFDT-2F-COOH showed a lower HOMO level, higher work function, and elevated built-in potential for the PSC device. Consequently, the resultant device based on PFDT-2F-COOH exhibited a considerably improved PCE of 21.68% with much increased VOC of 1.111 V (Fig. 10f–h).

2.3. Organometallic compounds
In addition to small molecules and polymers, organometallic compounds can also be developed as dopant-free HTMs.167 As shown in Fig. 11, organometallic HTMs generally adopt phthalocyanine or porphyrin cores, which complexes with divalent metal cations like Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Zn2+. They show good stability under thermal and photochemical stress. By modifying the substituents on the periphery, non-peripheral and metal central positions, organometallic HTMs can easily tune their optoelectronic properties. Benefiting from the high intrinsic hole mobility, these metal–organic complexes can effectively transport holes without any dopants. It is worth noting that phthalocyanine and porphyrin generally have strong absorption; in this regard, they are not ideal HTMs for inverted PSCs.168

In 2015, Ke et al. demonstrated a room-temperature fully vacuum-processed planar PSCs with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) as the HTM.169 The best-performing device achieved an efficiency of 15.42% (with VOC of 1.04 V and FF of 77.47%). To investigate the stability, the authors stored encapsulated cells in air with humidity of 20% at room temperature in the dark. After 1000 h, the PCE of the CuPc-based device only decreased from 14.21% to 13.83%, while spiro-OMeTAD devices showed a sharp decrease in the PCE from 13.66% to 8.38%. Jiang et al. synthesized a solution-processable CuPC derivative termed as CuPc-TIPS.170 The PSCs that adopted CuPc-TIPS as the HTM combined with a low-cost carbon cathode afforded a decent PCE of 14.0% under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination. The same group further designed two new CuPc derivatives (namely, CuPc-Bu and CuPc-OBu) by modifying the non-peripheral substituents of the phthalocyanine rings.171 A subtle structural optimization from the butyl to butoxy group significantly changed the molecular ordering and hole mobilities. As a result, PSCs based on dopant-free CuPc-OBu delivered an impressive PCE of 17.6% (14.3% for CuPc-Bu). Besides, dopant-free CuPc-OBu-based devices showed much improved ambient stability when stored without encapsulation under RH of 85% compared with doped-spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. Liu et al. reported a CuPC derivative with tetrapropyl substituents, namely, CuPrPc.172CuPrPc favors a face-on molecular orientation on the perovskite, leading to high hole mobility and a hydrophobic surface. PSC with CuPrPc exhibited a PCE of 17.8%, retaining over 94% of the initial efficiency after storage for 800 h without encapsulation (RH = 75%). Feng et al. combined TPA units with phthalocyanine rings under the guidance of computational simulations.173 The resulting OMe-TPA-CuPc molecule showed parallel orientations in bulk aggregates with good π–π interactions. The cost-effective solution-processable OMe-TPA-CuPc delivered a champion PCE of 19.67%.
Apart from CuPC, nickel-based phthalocyanine derivatives have also been developed. Cheng et al. developed NiPc-(OBu)8 as the HTM.174NiPc-(OBu)8 cannot fully cover the perovskite surface, leaving some visible perovskite crystals as recombination spots. To resolve this problem, researchers have tried to increase the HTM thickness to ensure full coverage, but FF was found to be significantly decreased. Finally, a V2O5 buffer layer was introduced, affording an impressive PCE of 18.3% combined with undoped NiPc-(OBu)8 as the HTM (Fig. 12a and b).

Porphyrin derivatives have been extensively investigated in DSSCs and OPVs because of their strong light-harvesting ability and good charge transport property.64,168,175,176 Chen et al. reported two meso-arylamine-substituted porphyrins with variations in the metal center.177 Zn(II)-Based ZnP delivered a PCE of 17.78% as the dopant-free HTM in mesoporous PSCs, while the PCE for Cu(II)-based CuP was 15.36%. By taking advantage of the porphyrin's strong light-absorbing capability,44 Gao et al. developed a near-infrared (NIR)-absorbing porphyrin (DPPEZnP-TEH) with a suitable HOMO level of −5.20 eV. By blending with PCBM into a BHJ layer to extend the photoresponse of PSCs, the DPPEZnP-TEH/PCBM film exhibited good hole mobility of 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and extended absorption up to 901 nm. By optimizing the DPPEZnP-TEH/PCBM ratio and film morphology in the BHJ layer, planar PSCs exhibited a high PCE of 19% with high JSC and FF (Fig. 12e and f). Considering stability issues including UV, thermal, and interfacial stability in PSCs, Cao et al. introduced dopant-free Co(II)/Co(III) porphyrin as the HTM while sinapoyl-malate-modified mesoporous TiO2 as the ETM to resolve these problems.178 Inspired by plants, sinapoyl malate—a natural plant sunscreen—was employed to modify TiO2 to increase the UV and interfacial stability. The mixture of Co(II)- and Co(III)-based porphyrins as undoped HTMs (denoted as Co(II)P and Co(III)P, respectively) afforded a higher efficiency of 20.47% for PSCs with superior thermal stability under a stress test at 85 °C for 1000 h (Fig. 12c and d).
3. Inorganic dopant-free HTMs
Inorganic materials can be ideal dopant-free HTMs due to their fascinating properties, such as high stability, low cost, and high charge carrier mobility; further, most of them do not need dopants.181 Many p-type inorganic semiconductors such as CuI,182,183CuSCN,184,185 and NiOx have been investigated for PSC applications.186–189 Among the various deposition methods, solution processing seems appealing for fabricating high-quality HTM layers at lower costs. However, inorganic materials generally have poor solubility; only a limited number of materials are suitable for solution processing. Some inorganic HTMs need to be prepared in the form of nanoparticles to disperse in solutions for deposition. Table 5 lists a summary of the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic parameters of the representative inorganic HTMs.

For n–i–p PSCs, the most efficient inorganic HTM is CuSCN. Solution-processed CuSCN shows two crystal phases, namely, the α phase with an orthorhombic crystal lattice and the β phase with a hexagonal or rhombohedral crystal lattice. Due to the presence of copper vacancies in the crystal lattice, CuSCN yields the p-type conductivity. The main problem is that the common solvents for CuSCN can quickly degrade the perovskite layer during deposition. In 2017, Arora et al. reported a dynamic drop-cast method to fabricate compact CuSCN films on the top of the perovskite.190 To overcome the operational instability attributable to the potential degradation of the CuSCN/Au interface, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) spacer layer was inserted between CuSCN and Au. CuSCN-based PSCs showed a PCE of 20. 4% with VOC of 1.112 V, JSC of 23.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 78.2%. More importantly, PSCs can retain over 95% of their initial PCE after aging at 60 °C for 1000 h under continuous full-sun illumination (Fig. 13a and b). Another promising alternative is CuGaO2. CuGaO2 possesses a layered structure with linearly alternating O–Cu–O and edge-sharing octahedral GaO6 layers. The valence band edge of CuGaO2 is estimated to be −5.29 eV with mobility as high as 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1. Zhang et al. employed solution-processed CuGaO2 as the HTM in planar PSCs. A good PCE of 18.51% and good storage stability (retaining a majority of the original device performance after exposure for 30 days to the ambient environment at 25 °C and 30–55% humidity without encapsulation) were achieved (Fig. 13c).192 Liu et al. synthesized solution-processable Cu2O quantum dots by modifying the surface with a silane coupling agent.191 The modified Cu2O could be directly spin-coated onto a perovskite film without damaging the underlayer. An impressive efficiency of 18.9% could be achieved for PSCs with surface-modified Cu2O (11.9% for unmodified Cu2O).

For p–i–n PSCs, NiOx is the most commonly used inorganic HTM with a large bandgap and deep valence band aligning well with the perovskite. To improve the device performance of NiOx, an efficient strategy is to dope or alloy pure NiO with different elements such as Li,197 Mg,186,198 Cu,199–201 and Co or their combinations.166,200,202 Liu et al. reported a low-temperature, solution–combustion-based method to prepare the NiOx HTM.196 The resulting NiOx films showed good quality and ideal energy alignment. Inverted PSCs with NiOx yielded a PCE of 20.2% with MA1−yFAyPbI3−xClx perovskite fabricated by a modified two-step procedure. Compared with the sol–gel-processed NiOx, solution–combustion-based NiOx showed better film quality, enhanced charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination (Fig. 13d and e). Huang's group focused on solution-processable Cu-based inorganic HTMs; they developed CuI,183CuS, and CuOx as efficient HTMs for inverted PSCs.193,194 Among them, an impressive PCE of 19.0% was achieved using CuOx-based PSCs with a hybrid MAPbI3−xClx perovskite as the light absorber. Some ternary inorganic HTMs have also been developed with remarkable device performances. Yin et al. reported a new HTM, namely, Cu3PS4, which has the smallest effective mass for holes and a wide indirect bandgap of 2.20 eV.65 Because of the high symmetry and d10 electronic configuration of Cu in Cu3PS4, the calculated effective mass for holes was 0.8m0, which is much smaller than that of NiOx (∼1m0) and Cu delafossites (>3m0), indicating high mobility in Cu3PS4. Planar inverted PSCs with Cu3PS4-nanoparticle-based HTM achieved a maximum PCE of 18.17% with high FF of 81.6% (Fig. 13f and g). Zhang et al. reported low-temperature solution-processed CuCrO2 nanocrystals for fabricating efficient and photostable PSCs.195CuCrO2 showed a deep valence band of −5.4 eV with a large bandgap of 2.9 eV. CuCrO2 can function as the HTM to deliver a PCE of 19% as well as a UV-blocking underlayer to improve the photostability.
4. Analysis and discussion
One major milestone in the development of PSCs is the introduction of solid-state spiro-OMeTAD HTMs,1,10,11 which resolved the problem of severe degradation caused by the liquid electrolyte. Since then, the device performance and stability of PSCs have been significantly improved owing to the development of HTMs. In the past decade, many new HTMs have been designed to replace spiro-OMeTAD, which has greatly affected the device stability due to the dependence on dopants. However, most of the newly developed HTMs still require dopants, even though some of them (e.g., DM,30DBC-OMeDPA,203etc.) show promising results that may be competitive with doped spiro-OMeTAD. In this context, developing dopant-free HTMs is of great significance, which can pave the way for the commercialization of PSCs.
In Fig. 1b, the general PCE evolution of representative dopant-free HTMs is outlined. According to the material properties, they can be categorized into small molecules, polymers, organometals, and inorganics semiconductors. Till date, the best PCEs achieved for n–i–p PSCs based on these four types of materials are 21.04% (FTO/SnO2/C60-SAM/MA0.7FA0.3Pb(I0.925Br0.075)3/PMMA/DTP-C6Th/Au),112 23.3% (FTO/TiO2/meso-TiO2/(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05/WBH/P3HT/Au),55 20.47% (FTO/TiO2-SM/(CsFAMA)Pb(BrI)3/Co(II)P/Co(III)P/Au),178 and 20.4% (FTO/TiO2/meso-TiO2/CsFAMAPbI3−xBrx/CuSCN/rGO/Au).190 The values for p–i–n PSCs based on small molecules, polymers, and inorganics are 21.17% (ITO/MPA-BTTI/CsFAMA-perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag),137 23% (ITO/PTAA/Cs0.05(FA0.92MA0.08)0.95Pb(I0.92Br0.08)3/C60/BCP/Cu),32 and 20.2% (FTO/NiOx/MA1−yFAyPbI3−xClx/PCBM/BCP/Ag),196 respectively.
Obviously, the efficiencies of dopant-free HTMs still lag behind those of doped spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, dopant-free HTMs are worth researching. To guide the future design of dopant-free HTMs, an empirical four-element golden law has been proposed based on a thorough analysis of over 110 high-performance HTM candidates. As shown in Fig. 14, the ideal HTMs should be dopant-free, efficient, stable, and low cost.
 Fig. 14  Four-element golden law for developing ideal HTMs. 
4.1. Dopant issue
Since the main drawback of spiro-OMeTAD is the reliance on dopants, the dopant-free feature is the prior requirement for developing ideal HTMs. Because pristine spiro-OMeTAD suffers from low hole mobility (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), dopants such as LiTFSI and FK209 can be added to improve the mobility to 10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. As such, increasing the hole mobility is a general strategy for ensuring new dopant-free HTMs. Inorganic HTMs generally have good hole mobilities, which require no dopants for charge transport. To acquire high mobilities in organic compounds, many strategies such as enhancing planarity, expanding conjugation, introducing donors and acceptors, and tuning the molecule packing have been explored. TIPS-pentacene is a typical planar molecule with high mobility exceeding 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.79 Polycyclic-hydrocarbon-based PCA-1 affords a mobility of 8.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a planar configuration.68 The conjugated polymer of P3HT has a good hole mobility of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, while that for the D–A-structured DOR3T-TBDT is 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1.55,81 Based on the single-crystal analysis, DFH exhibited strong intermolecular C–H⋯O and C–H⋯π interactions between the dioxane groups on neighboring DFH molecules parallel to the b axis. This mode of molecule packing gives DFH a mobility of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.135
The device performance was plotted against hole mobility for various dopant-free HTMs, as shown in Fig. 15a and b. Most dopant-free HTMs for n–i–p PSCs possess a hole mobility higher than 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is reasonable since the hole mobility for doped spiro-OMeTAD is also in this range. However, Fig. 15b clearly shows that a high PCE does not have a positive correlation with higher hole mobility in inverted PSCs; HTMs with poor hole mobilities (lower than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD) still show impressive PCEs of over 19% (e.g., PTAA,32P3CT-CH3NH2,67TPE-S,141FMT,136etc.). Since the thickness of the HTM layer in inverted devices is around 10–20 nm or even smaller, the HTMs with low hole mobility can still work efficiently due to the reduced transport length. From the point of view of charge transport balance, a moderate hole mobility of 10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 may be sufficient since the electron mobility for ETMs is also around 10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.76,204,205

4.2. Efficiency issue
The fundamental function of HTMs is to extract and transport holes. HTMs extract the holes generated in the perovskite layer through the HTM/perovskite interface and transport them to the electrodes through the inner channels. All the parts of this process are crucial for obtaining higher device efficiencies. For efficient hole extraction, a slightly higher HOMO level or VBM of HTM than the VBM of the perovskite is desirable. In a single-junction solar cell, the theoretical VOC is determined by the optical bandgap. In a certain dopant-free HTM investigation, reference devices and PSCs based on these new HTMs were fabricated under the same conditions, with the only variation being the new HTM. Therefore, the VOC values of the corresponding devices are significantly affected by the variation in the HTMs, particularly changes in the energy levels. The VOC values were plotted against the HOMO/VBM levels for various dopant-free HTMs, as shown in Fig. 15c and d. It is generally believed that a good energy-level alignment is beneficial for reducing the energy loss and increasing the VOC. Undoubtedly, the energy levels for ideal HTMs should be slightly higher than the VBMs of the perovskite used. However, we cannot define an ideal HOMO/VBM level for developing new HTMs. Compared with the HOMO/VBM levels measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) or ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) method, the quasi-Fermi energy levels formed at the HTM/perovskite interfaces are fairly different. Most researchers simply adopt the HOMO/VBM levels to estimate the VOC values because it is too difficult to investigate the real situation.
The other important requirement for HTMs to achieve higher performance is high film quality. The films should be smooth, free of pinholes, and fully covered to avoid direct contact between the perovskite absorber and electrode. HTMs that form high-quality thin films have another advantage of minimizing the series resistance, which can facilitate PCE enhancement. To reduce interface barrier and charge recombination loss, a passivation property is highly desirable. Some defect sites such as undercoordinated Pb2+ and halide anions can form at the perovskite/HTM interface, which can be passivated by Lewis acids and bases via chemical bonds or interactions.206,207 Chen et al. introduced the S atom into TPP-SMeTAD to induce strong Pb2+–S interaction,129 which can passivate the trap states at the grain boundary and surface of the perovskite, leading to more efficient hole extraction. Due to the Lewis-base nature of the carbonyl groups, Wang et al. incorporated these passivation groups to reduce the recombination loss. The resulting MPA-BTTI molecule delivered a record PCE of 21.17%.137
It is worth noting that device performance is heavily dependent on the benchmark efficiency of PSCs prepared by each research group. The device performance of PSCs is a result of the combination of material properties and device engineering. Only by using high-quality materials, suitable device configurations, and careful device optimizations, high-efficiency PSCs can be fabricated. According to the Cannikin law, PCEs can be sharply improved only when the HTMs are the only limitations in the entire system. Besides dopant-free HTMs, the fabrication of high-quality perovskite crystals as well as other layers are the foundations for high PCEs behind the scenes. As shown in Fig. 1b, the PCE evolution of dopant-free HTMs is consistent with the development of PSCs. In other words, developing new HTMs based on efficient PSCs is crucial to boost the corresponding device performance.
4.3. Stability issue
Dopant-free HTMs have been developed to handle the stability issue caused by volatile and hygroscopic dopants. Therefore, the stability result is necessary for evaluating dopant-free HTMs. Various conditions are adopted to investigate the stability of new HTMs in terms of water, oxygen, heat, and light. The stability results with dopant-free HTMs affording PCEs exceeding 20% under various conditions are summarized in Table 6. It is worth noting that there are blanks in Table 6 since the related parameters are not explicitly stated in the original report. Moreover, if the light-source information is not explicitly stated in the “conditions” column of Table 6, it means that the information is not specified in the original report.

All these dopant-free HTMs show superior long-term stability, retaining over 80% of the initial PCEs after storage longer than 720 h, which is much better than the reference devices based on doped HTMs. In the case of DTP-C6Th, it is evident that PSCs based on doped spiro-OMeTAD showed a 33% PCE drop even in N2 with no other stresses.112 In contrast, the dopant-free DTP-C6Th-based device afforded no PCE loss when stored under the same condition after 60 days (Fig. 5h). To confirm the stability against moisture and oxygen, PSCs based on undoped HTMs were placed in air without encapsulation. With the RH ranging from 20% to 85%, most undoped HTMs showed good stabilities after getting rid of hygroscopic dopants and post-oxidation process. Impressive stability was achieved for P3HT-based PSCs with a combination of the DHA strategy (Fig. 9c).55 The unencapsulated device retained nearly 80% of its initial PCE after 1008 h under 85% RH. Thermal stress is another important part of the stability test since solar cells operating in the real situation may experience higher temperatures (60–80 °C) due to environmental and photothermal influences.208 However, only MPA-BTTI, alkoxy-PTEG, PFDT-2F-COOH, PTAA, Co(II)P/Co(III)P, and CuSCN were used in the thermal aging tests at a temperature above 80 °C. Among them, an organometallic Co(II)P/Co(III)P binary porphyrin system showed no efficiency loss after aging at 85 °C for 1000 h in N2 (Fig. 12d), indicating the huge potential of organometallic HTMs.
There are two methods to assess the light stability under continuous 1 sun illumination: one is to periodically measure the PCEs and the other is to track the steady-state power output at the MPP. The latter one is recommended since it is closer to the real operating situation. It is worth mentioning that PSCs based on inorganic CuSCN afforded excellent stability under MPP tracking at 60 °C.190 The resulting PSC retained over 95% of its initial PCE after 1000 h, which is fairly close to the requirements for industrial applications. The other easily ignored part of light stability is UV resistance. It is widely recognized that UV light plays an important role in deteriorating the perovskite layer.2,178 Considering this problem, Zhang et al. adopted CuCrO2 to act as both UV blocker and dopant-free HTM, providing a potential solution for high-performance and UV-stable p–i–n PSCs.195
Although no industrial standards of stability tests for perovskite solar modules have been established, a majority of the testing protocols can follow the stability test standards set by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC, IEC 61215/61646) for Si, CdTe, and CIGS solar modules.209–212 The IEC standard protocol involves tests under thermal cycling, damp heat, and humidity–freeze tests. These tests include aging of the modules under harsh environmental conditions such as elevated temperature (85 °C), low temperature (−40 °C) accompanied with high RH (85%), and/or rapid change in temperature (200 °C h−1). The solar modules that can maintain over 95% of their initial performance pass these tests, which are then considered for market release. Another notable perovskite-specific standard is set by the International Summit on Organic and Hybrid Photovoltaics Stability (ISOS). A recent consensus statement for the stability of PSCs pointed out the future direction to accurately assess and report the device stability.213 Besides dark storage, tests involving light soaking, outdoors, thermal cycling, light cycling, and voltage bias are included, as well as formalizing an inert ambient environment, for each type of test.
4.4. Cost issue
Till date, polymeric dopant-free HTMs such as P3HT and PTAA have been used to realize high PCEs of around 23%. However, the extremely high costs (460 $ per g for P3HT and 1980 $ per g for PTAA) limit their large-scale applications. To reduce the material cost, facile synthesis with limited steps, cheap raw materials, and easy purification are highly demanded. To reduce the production cost, small quantity for usage and cheap solution processability are important. Although inorganic HTMs have the advantage of low material price, the difficulty in solution processing limit their large-area production. To the best of our knowledge, a low cost of 3 $ per g for DFH is the lowest value for all-dopant-free HTMs.
5. Conclusions
Dramatic progress has been achieved in PSCs since the publication of the first report on PSCs in 2009. Till date, the efficiency of PSCs has reached 25.2%, which is comparable with that of crystalline Si cells (∼26%).1 Considering the huge potential in low-cost manufacturing and flexible applications, PSCs are regarded as the most promising candidate for next-generation PV technology. As a benchmark in PSC history, spiro-OMeTAD functions as a solid-state HTM in contrast to the initial liquid electrolyte, enabling a leapfrog development in PSCs with PCEs increased from 3.9% to 25.2% within a decade. Here, we denote the application of doped materials such as spiro-OMeTAD or PTAA as HTM 1.0. However, the severe stability problems faced by the dopants greatly limit their practical applications. To pave the way for the commercialization of PSCs, the importance of dopant-free HTMs (denoted as HTM 2.0) should be emphasized. These dopant-free HTMs include organic small molecules, polymers, organometallic compounds, and inorganics. Organic HTMs possess the advantages of the facile tuning of the energy level, mobility, solubility, and morphology. To meet the mobility requirement of dopant-free materials, several strategies have been proposed, such as increasing the planarity, expanding the conjugation, introducing alternating donor–acceptor, and incorporating counterions. Aiming to improve the device performance, a careful optimization of the molecule packing and surface property is also necessitated. It has been found that dithienopyrrole is an efficient building block with a planar configuration, strong electron-donating property, and heteroatoms of N and S, which can favor efficient hole transport and interface passivation. Several dithienopyrrole-cored materials have been demonstrated to be efficient dopant-free HTMs (e.g., ICTH2,96M129,108mDPA-DBTP,100DTPC8-ThDTPA,214DTPC8-ThTPA,111DTPC13-ThTPA,111DTP-C6Th,112etc.). Inorganic HTMs have advantages of high intrinsic hole mobilities, low cost, and good stabilities. Due to the difficulty in preparing high-quality films via a simple and cheap method, inorganic HTMs are less investigated and the PCE lags behind that of organic HTMs.
To guide the further design of dopant-free HTMs, an empirical four-element golden law has been formulated after a comprehensive summary and analysis of the reported results. First, an ideal HTM should have high hole mobility to avoid the use of dopants. Second, it should effectively extract and transport holes, which requires a suitable energy level, high film quality, and optimized interfacial contact. Third, it needs to be stable under thermal, optical, chemical, and environmental stresses. In the end, it should be cost-effective with regard to both material price and production cost.
Till date, PSCs based on dopant-free HTMs have afforded a remarkable PCE of 23.3% (P3HT),55 superior stability in which over 95% of the initial PCE could be retained after MPP tracking at 60 °C for 1000 h (CuSCN),190 and low cost of 3 $ per g (DFH).135 However, these desired properties cannot be achieved using a single material. Before designing new HTMs, some key questions need to be answered:
(1) What makes an HTM dopant-free?
Since the main aim of adding dopants is to increase the mobility and conductivity, many researchers consider high hole mobility as the key factor for ensuring dopant-free HTMs. However, as previously discussed, there are still many HTMs that can work effectively without dopants, which affords lower hole mobility than the sister molecules or undoped spiro-OMeTAD. For example, undoped CZ-TA afforded a good hole mobility of 1.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1,25 which is higher than that of 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD (9.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, a carbazole-based HTM has a similar molecular backbone and HOMO level compared with that of CZ-TA).95 Further, 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD afforded a PCE of 17.6% without using dopants, while the PCE value for undoped CZ-TA is only 10%. Chen et al. synthesized two HTMs of TPP-OMeTAD and TPP-SMeTAD.129 By replacing all the O atoms in TPP-OMeTAD with S, TPP-SMeTAD showed decreased hole mobility (7.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1versus 1.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) but much improved efficiency (16.6% versus 14.6%). Of course, higher hole mobility is an important factor, but it cannot guarantee a dopant-free HTM. Since the fundamental functions of HTMs are to extract and transport holes, we suppose the capability of effectively extracting and transporting holes determines whether the HTM needs dopants or not. For hole extraction, proper energy alignment, strong surface dipoles, and beneficial chemical interactions at the perovskite/HTM interface are important. For hole transport, both intramolecular transport and intermolecular hopping are crucial for the overall hole transport. In this context, a continuous network for hole transfer with reduced barriers and recombination centers are highly demanded.
(2) How can we obtain the maximum PCE for a new dopant-free HTM?
Many reports on dopant-free HTMs focus on material innovation, but less attention has been paid to device optimization. In most cases, researchers only optimize the thickness of the HTM films via tuning the solution concentration and/or spin-coating speed. However, perovskite, interface, and HTM are crucial to the device performance of new HTMs. There have been several good reviews summarizing the methods for perovskite engineering;206,215–221 here, we focus on the interface and HTM issues. To reduce the nonradiative recombination losses at the interface, which usually results in limited VOC and FF, a careful optimization of the interface property is necessary, since the new HTMs result in new interface contacts and new problems. Jung et al. inserted a layer of wide-bandgap perovskite to facilitate the formation of the self-assembled fibril structure of P3HT.55 This DHA strategy resulted in charge trap passivation at the perovskite/HTM interface, highly oriented P3HT layer with enhanced mobility, and reduced series resistance. As a result, the optimized device afforded a PCE of 23.3%, VOC of 1.152 V, and FF of 81.4%. The control device only afforded a PCE of 15.8%, VOC of 0.925 V, and FF of 69%. To further improve the device performance, an optimization process of the HTM itself is also required. Cao et al. found that the as-cast DFH afforded a low PCE of 10.2% with VOC of 0.92 V, JSC of 19.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 55%.135 After thermal annealing at 135 °C, amorphous DFH was transformed into paracrystalline dimers and a high hole mobility of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained. Another important feature for annealed DFH is the advantage of growing pinhole-free perovskite films with large grain sizes. Therefore, DFH annealed at 135 °C afforded a doubled PCE of 20.6% with VOC of 1.09 V, JSC of 22.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 83%. Many efforts have been made to explore new materials; it is really a pity to miss the performance that they should possess. Device optimization is as equally important as material development.
(3) Importance of machine learning
The theoretical prediction of new materials is an effective way to find high-performance candidates. A large amount of resources can be saved if ideal materials can be found before synthesis. However, the common mode of computational method in developing new HTMs involves three steps. First, possible molecules are designed according to the chemistry knowledge. Second, the molecular properties are predicted via theoretical calculations and the target molecules are selected. Third, the results are obtained after material synthesis and device applications. By summarizing the experience and repeating these steps, increasingly better materials can be obtained. However, this mode has several limitations. First, researchers can hardly screen for all the possible molecular structures. Second, it takes a long time to calculate the molecular properties, making it unsuitable for investigating a large number of molecules. Third, it is extremely difficult to determine which molecule is more suitable due to too many relevant factors. Recently, a machine learning method has emerged as a useful computational tool to formulate the structure–property relationship and conduct a faster screening of new materials.222–225 This data-driven method enables the prediction of material properties without requiring the fundamental understanding of the chemical or physical mechanism. Therefore, with a suitable training mode and precious HTM database, the accelerated development of new dopant-free HTMs can be expected.
In summary, a review of the recent progress and insights into the future development of dopant-free HTMs are presented. We hope that this paper can facilitate future innovations in ideal HTMs as well as the commercialization of PSCs.

Broader context
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their unique advantages such as high efficiency and low cost. As a crucial part of PSCs, hole transport materials (HTMs) have a significant influence on the device efficiency and stability. Currently, one major bottleneck for PSC commercialization is the stability issue caused by dopants in HTMs, which can attract moisture and can migrate during device operation. Therefore, the development of dopant-free HTMs is of great significance. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in the molecular design and device engineering of dopant-free HTMs for n–i–p and p–i–n PSCs. To meet the commercial requirement of HTMs, detailed solutions for making dopant-free HTMs more efficient, stable, and cost-effective are further analyzed and discussed. To guide the future development of HTMs, we try to provide fundamental understandings such as what makes HTMs dopant-free, how to realize the maximum performance of new HTMs, and how should we screen for promising HTMs. We hope that this review can help the development of HTMs and pave the way for PSC commercialization.
