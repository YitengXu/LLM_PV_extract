Because of the diversity in device configurations, optimization of film deposition, and exploration of material systems, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been certified to be as high as 25.2%, making this type of solar cells the fastest advancing technology until now. As demonstrated by researchers worldwide, controlling the morphology and defects in perovskite films is essential for attaining high-performance PSCs. In this regard, interface engineering has proven to be a very efficient way to address these issues, obtaining better charge collection efficiency, and reducing recombination losses.

1. Introduction
Energy is an indispensable part of human life; nonetheless, the crisis caused by fossil fuel consumption is a serious environmental issue in the 21st century. Therefore, the demand for clean and sustainable energy keeps rising every day. As a rich and clean renewable energy source, solar energy delivers power that is approximately 10000 times more than the requirement of the entire planet, while it contributes only 2% to the world energy supply; this discrepancy is due to the low efficiencies and high cost of photovoltaics (PVs).1 Therefore, it has become urgent to explore novel materials with low manufacturing costs and high PV efficiencies.
During the last decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a new generation of PV technology with a performance boost to 25.2%,2 which is close to that obtainable from traditional single-crystalline silicon-based solar cells. This perovskite absorber has the chemical formula ABX3, where A is a cation (typically CH3NH3+ (MA), HC(NH2)2+ (FA), Cs+, and Rb+), B is a divalent metal cation (Pb2+, Sn2+, etc.), and X denotes halide anions (I−, Br−, and Cl−).3 The extraordinary performance of PSCs can be attributed to their excellent properties such as high absorption coefficient,4 small exciton binding energy, ambipolar charge transport, and long carrier diffusion length.5,6
Although significant progresses have been made in this field, some serious challenges still persist, such as notorious hysteresis and long-term stability; they hinder the commercialization of PSCs. To exploit the benefits of their excellent properties, an urgent breakthrough is required in at least three main aspects: (1) enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE), (2) long-term stability, and (3) ease of fabrication. During the PV process, a stream of light penetrates into the perovskite absorber and generates free charge carriers. These free carriers are then diffused to the interfaces between the perovskite and charge-transport layers (CTLs). During this process, some of these carriers are recombined with the defects and grain boundaries (GBs) in the crystal bulk and at the interfaces, while the remaining are extracted into the corresponding CTLs. These surface and bulk defects, which are responsible for low efficiency, hysteresis, and long-term instability, are critical for better performing devices.
Interface engineering is an efficient way to overcome these losses, appreciably enhancing the performance of PSCs in a number of ways. It can reduce recombination losses by overcoming the interfacial defects as well as modifying the band energy offsets.7 Interface engineering can also be very helpful to boost the morphology of the perovskite layer,8 adjust the work function,9 and improve the interfacial contact and long-term stability of the devices.10 In this regard, interface-modifying materials are usually introduced into the PSCs, which can be located at the interface between the CTLs and the perovskite or between the CTLs and the electrodes.
This review provides a brief summary and discussion about the recent data regarding interface engineering in PSCs as well as the effect of GBs and stress engineering on perovskite materials. We start from a short discussion regarding the device architecture of PSCs and its evolution with time. Section 2 briefly describes the importance of interface engineering in PSCs. Section 3 summarizes the recent progresses made in the interface engineering of mesoporous and planar (p-i-n and n-i-p) structures in detail. Section 4 includes discussions regarding the importance of grain size and GB engineering for a perovskite surface. Section 5 presents an overview of stress engineering in PSCs.
2. Device structure
2.1. Mesoporous n-i-p structure
A mesoporous structure is one of the most widely used structures for fabricating high-performance perovskite PV devices. The whole mesoporous structure is schematically shown in Fig. 1A. This structure comprises a glass cathode (ITO or FTO), an electron transport material (ETM), generally compact TiO2 (c-TiO2, 50–70 nm), and a mesoporous layer (mp-TiO2 or Al2O3, 150–200 nm). These mesopores are filled by the coating of a perovskite layer (thickness: ∼300–500 nm). For the hole transport materials (HTMs), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is used on top of the perovskite; finally, a 50–100 nm-thick metal electrode (Au, Al, or Ag) is thermally evaporated.

Although the thickness of the porous layers in the mesoscopic perovskite structures is in the nanoscale, it can impact the overall performance of the solar devices. The porous layer usually comprises a 500 nm-thick perovskite film, through which light absorption can efficiently take place.11,12 Moreover, this porous structure limits the grain growth of the perovskite because a large amount of this material is in the amorphous and highly disordered phase.13 These disordered phases severely restrain the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the devices.14 Snaith and co-workers reported that by thinning the mp-TiO2 layer to ∼150–200 nm, the crystallinity of the perovskite absorber can be improved, leading to enhanced performance.15,16 When the thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer is increased to ∼300 nm, the pore filling fraction increases and the perovskite capping layer forms on top of the porous structure, ensuring the higher transportation of charge carriers and improving the collection efficiencies at the TiO2 interface.15 Generally, mesoscopic n-i-p is the most common structure through which a maximum PCE of 24.02% can be achieved.17
2.2. Planar n-i-p structure
The planar n-i-p structure, schematically shown in Fig. 1B, is an innovation of the mesoscopic structure. The ETM in the mesoporous perovskite structure was initially considered troublesome for high-efficiency devices because the electron extraction at the ETM interface is not very efficient as compared to hole extraction at the HTM interface.18 However, higher PCE can now be attained without any mesoporous layer by precisely adjusting the composition of the perovskite layer, as well as the interfaces between the perovskite, CTLs, and metal electrodes.19 These planar n-i-p structures generally comprise a compact ETM layer with a thickness of approximately 150 nm coated behind the perovskite. Recently, the best planar n-i-p device exhibited a PCE value of 23.32% by adopting a SnO2 ETL.20 Planar n-i-p devices show high VOC and JSC values, but experience severe J–V hysteresis.
2.3. Planar p-i-n structure
In the p-i-n device structure, as schematically shown in Fig. 1C, the HTM layer is deposited prior to the perovskite layer. In this case, a p-type conducting polymer, e.g., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), with thickness in the range of 30–50 nm is spin-coated on top of the ITO substrate. A 300 nm perovskite layer is deposited on top of this HTM, upon which a 40–60 nm-thick ETM—usually [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)—is deposited; a metal cathode (Al or Au) is evaporated on top of this ETM.21
Due to the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS that can impair the stability of PSC devices, some other p-type inorganic semiconductor materials are recommended to be employed as the HTM in p-i-n PSCs, such as NiO,22 Cu2O,23 CuSCN,24 and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA).25 Wen and co-workers described a donor–acceptor (perovskite and fullerene) pair device structure, usually used in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.26 In fact, this research paved the way for OPV researchers to commit themselves to perovskite PVs due to the commonality between both these structures. Until now, the best performance of planar p-i-n devices is a PCE value of 21.6%.27
3. Interface modification
3.1. Importance of interface modification
Photoinduced charge carrier extraction, transportation, and recombination mostly takes place on the interfaces of PV devices. Therefore, for efficient carrier extraction, better transportation, and minimum recombination losses on the interfaces, suitable interface engineering is imperative. Interfacial modification reduces the recombination losses and improves the band energy offsets between the two layers.28 It improves the morphology29 and work function7 of the perovskite layer, as well as assists in efficiently blocking the minority charge carriers,29 improving contact between the two layers,30 and increasing PSC stability.31 However, the inspirational performance of PSCs mainly depends on device optimization and design of a better CTL.
There are two different interface engineering strategies for use in PSCs.
(1) Replacement of CTLs with their better counterpart. For example, in the planar n-i-p structure, TiO2 is not the ideal candidate for use as the ETM due its inferior electron mobility. By replacing it with high-mobility SnO2, its performance can be boosted up to 23%.32 Moreover, the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS hampers device stability and therefore it can be replaced with its inorganic counterpart, NiO, which ensures that the initial PCE is maintained in excess of 90% for 60 days in the ambient environment.33
(2) Introducing a very thin passivation layer between the perovskite and CTL or between the CTL and metal electrode. For example, Wang et al.34 and Koushik et al.35 used ultrathin layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and Al2O3 to passivate the interface between the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD, which improved the VOC value and reduced J–V hysteresis. In this review, the progress of interface engineering via surface modification in both mesoscopic and planar structures of PSCs was emphasized. Interface engineering plays an important role to improve PSC performances by tuning the work function, passivating the trap states, blocking ion migration, and improving the charge carrier dynamics and device stability.

3.1.1. Energy level alignment. 
Work function adjustment at the device interfaces has a potential influence on the performance of PSCs (Fig. 2). Better aligned energy levels are suitable for the efficient transport of carriers from the valence and conduction band of the perovskite to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the CTLs.36 It has already been established that 0.2 eV is an appropriate offset that can ensure effective charge carrier extraction from the CTL/perovskite interfaces.37,38 If the conduction (valence) band of the perovskite is much higher (lower) than the LUMO (HOMO) of the ETL (HTL), it can reduce the VOC value of the devices. However, a minor offset can cause significant carrier recombination at the interfaces. In addition, the energy level alignment of the CTLs should also match the work function of the two electrodes for better charge transfer from the CTLs to the relevant electrodes.39

3.1.2. Passivation of trap states. 
The traps states and GBs are the main factors causing charge recombination losses at the perovskite surface and interfaces. The passivation of such traps can reduce hysteresis in PSCs.3,40 The localized states in a perovskite, generated due to an imperfect surface, usually act as trap centers for carriers. Barnes et al. described that the inefficient carrier transport in mp-TiO2 could be mainly attributed to the presence of a large amount of charge traps.41 Therefore, the introduction of a thin fullerene monolayer at the perovskite/TiO2 interface boosted electron extraction and improved the electron coupling between them.42 Ginger and co-workers introduced a pyridine molecule to passivate the oxides trap states at the Zr-doped TiO2 surface, ultimately yielding better hysteresis-less performance.43


3.1.3. Ion migration. 
Ion migration is a process within the crystal structure of perovskites that can cause hysteresis in the J–V curves and deteriorate PSC performance.44,45 It has already been established that hysteresis in PSCs is an outcome of the migration of halide ions under light illumination and electric field.46 Azpiroz et al. claimed that MA and Pb vacancies are the main cause of the slow time response observed in hysteresis.47 Moreover, ion migration has a diverse impact on the device stability of PSCs due to the reaction of halide ions with the metal electrode,48 ultimately triggering device degradation. For example, the migration of halides or MA ions from the perovskite to the metal electrode yields insulating Ag–I bonds at the surface of the metal electrode related to hysteresis issues. To resolve this, Lee and co-workers suppressed the formation of Ag–I bonds by inserting a layer of amine-mediated titanium suboxide (AM-TiOx) between PCBM and the metal electrode, which can act as a chemical stabilization layer for ionic defects. This chemical stabilizer layer improves the charge extraction at this interface, improves long-term stability, and mitigates photocurrent hysteresis (Fig. 3).49

3.1.4. Charge dynamics. 
Charge dynamical processes involve charge extraction, charge transportation, and charge recombination taking place on the interfaces of PV devices. Charge extraction is an ultrafast process that occurs within hundreds of picoseconds (ps) in contrast to the nanosecond (ns) time scale of free carriers. However, some works have confirmed that the charge extraction process may slow down due to residual PbI2 at the interfaces.50 Yang et al. described the phenomenon of superfast electron tunneling produced by the introduction of graphene quantum dots at the ETM/perovskite interface, which effectively reduced the charge extraction time from (260–307 ps) to (90–106 ps).51 Therefore, interfacial modification is very useful to promote ultrafast charge carrier extraction. Moreover, the processes of charge transportation and charge recombination have a stronger influence on device performance, particularly on JSC and VOC, as compared to that by charge extraction.52,53 Recently, Qi and co-workers introduced a thin layer of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) at the perovskite/carbon interface based on FA-cesium (Cs)-based perovskites. This thin layer modification efficiently improved the interfacial energy level alignment, suppressed recombination losses, and enhanced the PCE up to 22% as compared to those of the control device.54


3.1.5. Device stability. 
Stability is one of the most serious challenges in the commercialization of PSCs. Even though many reported devices have achieved high efficiencies, they still suffer from low stability when exposed to moisture, heat, and UV light.55,56 The two major reasons for this instability in perovskite devices are as follows: (1) chemically unstable perovskite crystals that are subject to phase change under the effect of atmospheric factors;57 (2) change in the J–V profile upon applying electric bias that could either be due to the migration of halide or MA+ ions or the ferroelectric polarization of CH3NH3PbI3.58 The use of a thin hydrophobic interfacial layer is beneficial for protecting perovskites against moisture.59 For example, the introduction of 3-alkylthiophene derivatives as an interfacial layer at the perovskite/HTL interface can significantly improve device stability. This enhanced stability was mainly due to the presence of long alkyl chains that increased the hydrophobicity of the perovskite layer.60 Moreover, 2D perovskites have been shown to be more stable than their 3D counterparts because of the protection of organic ligands. Therefore, the treatment of 2D organic cations on the perovskite is a very famous way to fabricate the most stable PSCs. For example, Huang and co-workers treated a perovskite material with the 2D organic ligand n-butylamine (BA). The reaction of BA with MAPbI3 only produces (BA)2PbI4, which has better protection due to the presence of more organic ligands in (BA)2PbI4 than that in a mixture of 2D perovskites. As a result, a smooth 2D perovskite layer formed on the 3D perovskite surface with better coverage. The perovskite devices based on 2D/3D stacking structures exhibited much improved stability when subjected to heat stress tests as compared to their 3D counterparts. In addition, the conversion of defective surfaces into 2D layers also induced the passivation of the 3D perovskite, resulting in enhanced efficiency (Fig. 4).61

3.2 Interfacial modification of the n-i-p structure

3.2.1. ETL/perovskite interface. 
The ETL/perovskite interface has drawn considerable interest for devices with mesoscopic and planar (n-i-p) structures. The main purpose of interfacial modification at the ETL/perovskite interface is to alter the energy level alignment, improve charge dynamics, and control the morphology of the perovskite film. Here, we separately discuss the progress of interface engineering at this interface in both mesoscopic and planar structures.
Mesoscopic structure. 
As a critical part of mesoscopic PSCs, the mp-TiO2 layer serves as a scaffold to sustain the perovskite and a selective contact to extract electrons, which significantly influences the device performance. It was confirmed that the high chemical capacitance of TiO2 under illumination may prevent the quasi-Fermi level of the electrons from rising sufficiently high for any given charge,62 which can decrease the photovoltage of PSCs. For example, Ogomi et al. found that electron extraction became faster from the perovskite to mp-TiO2 by the introduction of HOCO-R-NH3+I− as the interfacial layer.63 The low carrier recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface benefits PSCs to achieve high VOC and better performance.64 The recombination dynamics with and without the HOCO-R-NH3+I layer were observed by transient absorption spectroscopy. Evidently, no transient signal was observed in the control devices. This transient absorption signal only appeared when the recombination time was larger than the millisecond time scale, indicating that the recombination time between the injection of electrons into TiO2 and holes from the perovskite occurs in less than the millisecond time scale. However, in the case of the HOCO-R-NH3+I− layer between the TiO2/perovskite interfaces, a clear transient absorption signal was observed, implying that the recombination was significantly reduced.
Similarly, Jang and co-workers introduced an ultrathin layer of graphene quantum dots (GQD) between the mp-TiO2/perovskite interface, resulting in efficient electron extraction (3.4–21.4 ns) in contrast to that without GQD (4.7–31.7 ns) and improved PCE could be achieved ranging from 16.89% to 19.9%.65 This improved performance could be attributed to the reduced series resistance and improved recombination resistance of the device. Recently, Peng et al. introduced an ultrathin layer of a PMMA:PCBM mixture between mp-TiO2 and perovskite absorber to efficiently suppress the recombination losses. A dramatic improvement in the VOC value could be obtained from 1.1 to 1.18 V, enabling improved PCE from 18.5% to 20.4% (Fig. 5d and e).66 In addition, in order to provide a comparative analysis between the control and passivated devices, PL imaging under the open-circuit condition was carried out. As expected, the cell with the highest PL intensity yielded the highest VOC value in the case of the passivated device, possibly due to the better energy level alignment at the ETL/perovskite interface (Fig. 5a). A logarithmic plot of the PL intensity vs. VOC (Fig. 5b) exhibited a clear linear relationship of these devices. Moreover, the fast and slow decay times component of the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) for the control device (8 and 83 ns, respectively) were much lower than those for the device passivated with PMMA:PCBM (or PMMA) (18 and 157 ns, respectively) (Fig. 5c). More details about the progress of mesoporous ETL/perovskite interfacial modification are summarized in Table 1.

High-temperature sintering in mesoporous PSCs has numerous disadvantages, namely, slow production and high cost. It also confines the application to solid, temperature-resilient substrates, preventing its use with plastic and malleable metal foils and multijunction device architectures.67 Due to these reasons, the replacement of sintered n-type TiO2 with low-temperature compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) or SnO2 can make the PSC technology versatile. However, it has been established that the electron transfer between c-TiO2 and perovskite is not very effective due to unfavorable conduction band minimum (CBM) and lower charge extraction ability of TiO2.67 For this purpose, a p-type ionic salt, namely, CuI, was introduced as a surface modifier between TiO2 and perovskite, which successfully improved the energy band alignment between them. It was established that CuI pulled the electron toward the TiO2/perovskite interface, which efficiently improved the electron extraction process at this interface and reduced the recombination losses (Fig. 6a). The PL quenching of the modified surface indicated that CuI modification improved carrier quenching when compared with the pristine device, as shown in Fig. 6b. The TRPL spectra further confirmed the better charge extraction ability of TiO2 with CuI modification as indicated by its lower lifetime, τ1 = 2.88 ns, than that for pristine devices (4.69 ns) (Fig. 6c). This formed barrier-free contact ultimately improved the device VOC value from 0.98 to 1.075 V and enhanced the PCE from 13.5% to 19% (Fig. 6d).68

It is well known that ZnO is a conventional ETL for devices with the planar n-i-p structure, but its poor chemical compatibility with the perovskite makes it a challenge to obtain efficient and stable PSCs. Recently, Zhen and co-workers modified ZnO with MgO and protonated ethanolamine (EA). Here, the basic function of MgO was to passivate the recombination losses and improve the device performance, while EA enhanced the electron extraction from the perovskite to ZnO and ultimately created a suitable contact between the perovskite and ZnO ETL. This interfacial modification of the ZnO ETL improved the PSC performance to 21.1%, as well as yielding reduced hysteresis and better stability.69 Moreover, Lee and co-workers fabricated a PCBM interlayer to tune the surface of ZnO in a planar device structure.70 The CBM of PCBM/ZnO lying in between the ZnO and perovskite helps in rapid charge extraction. More importantly, the VOC value of PCBM/ZnO-based devices was also improved, which typically depends upon the quasi-Fermi level offsets between the perovskite absorber and adjacent ETL and HTL.4,71
Similarly, Dong et al. used a thin layer of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA) for the surface modification of c-TiO2. This interfacial layer effectively passivated the trap states, improved charge extraction, and assisted in hole blocking at the c-TiO2/perovskite interface, which led to high VOC (1.16 V) and increase in PCE to 17.76%.72 Furthermore, an amorphous SnO2 layer was inserted between the perovskite and c-TiO2, improving the charge collection efficiency and reducing the recombination losses. This interfacial modification increased the VOC value to 1.2 V and enhanced the PCE from 19.33% to 21.4%.73
SnO2 is another highly efficient ETL used in planar PSCs because of its high mobility, suitable CBM, high transparency, low-temperature processing, and excellent chemical stability. The sintering for the SnO2 ETL layer can enhance its conductivity, while induce donor-type defects and oxygen vacancies, increasing the recombination centers that restrict the PSC performance. Therefore, the passivation layer of fullerene or its derivative on the SnO2 effectively improves the charge extraction ability and passivates the surface defects.74–76 For example, graphene is an astonishing material with very high charge mobility, and its passivation function on SnO2 is similar or even better than that of fullerenes. Yu and co-workers used SnO2-graphene quantum dots as the ETL in planar PSCs and efficiently improved its performance to 20.23%.77 This improvement was explained by the photogenerated carriers (electrons) in the GQD transporting to the CBM of SnO2, which could effectively fill up the electron trap states, improve the Fermi level and conductivity of SnO2, and eventually lead to efficient electron extraction and reduced recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface. More details about the progress of planar ETL/perovskite interfacial modification are summarized in Table 2.

3.2.2. Perovskite/HTL interface. 
A better HTL can improve the device performance and reduce recombination losses at the perovskite/HTL interface.78 Earlier studies have established that interface engineering at the perovskite/HTL interface is an important strategy to effectively passivate defects, block minor electrons, and improve hole extraction.79 The surface charge of the perovskite can be accumulated by trap states, which lead to recombination losses in solar cells, and the neighboring dipoles in between the perovskite/HTL interface contribute toward J–V hysteresis.80 Generally, the surface is a major source of hole traps for perovskite thin films,81e.g., undercoordinated halide anions.
In terms of interfacial modification, Snaith and co-workers introduced iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) to passivate the hole trap states on the perovskite surface via supramolecular halogen bonding.82 This engineering strategy passivated the recombination losses and improved the device performance from 13% to 15.7%. Similarly, Noel et al. used thiophene and pyridine interfacial layers between the perovskite/HTL, respectively, which reduced nonradiative losses and improved the device performance of PSCs from 13% to 15.3% and 16.5%, respectively.83
Recently, perovskite surface passivation with 2D perovskites has become prevalent because of their stronger resistance toward moisture and heat in contrast to the counterpart (3D) perovskites.84–87 Recently, Liu et al. demonstrated a passivation technique by treating a 3D perovskite with pentafluorophenylethylammonium (FEA) cations. This passivation layer protected the 3D perovskite surface from the ambient environment due to the presence of a perfluorinated benzene moiety with the ability to provide a superhydrophobic character to the spacer layer, resulting in achieving initial efficiency of 90% for unsealed 2D/3D perovskite devices after 1000 h during the PV operation in humid air under simulated sunlight.88 More importantly, this FEA layer effectively passivated nonradiative recombinations, which improved interfacial hole extraction and obtained a PCE value of 22%. Similarly, Peatzold and co-workers treated the double-cation wide-bandgap (1.72 eV) perovskite surface with a thin layer of n-butyl ammonium bromide (BABr), which forms a 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite layer. This thin layer suppressed nonradiative recombinations in the double-cation perovskite surface and pushed its VOC value up to 1.31 V, the highest value amongst 2D and 3D PSCs; further, its PCE was enhanced from 17.5% to 19.8%.89
The stability issue in PSCs is mainly due to the sensitive nature of the CH3NH3I group against moisture, which can be overcome by changing the perovskite surface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, e.g., the introduction of a dodecyltrimethoxysilane (C12-silane) layer at the perovskite/HTL interface induced resistance toward moisture. This is due to the amphiphilic nature of C12-silane, which comprises the electrophilic trimethoxysilane group and the hydrophobic long alkyl chains that can change the iodine bond into Si–OH in the perovskite surface.90 This interlayer acted as an electrically insulating barrier that minimized the interfacial recombination losses and resulted in an improvement in the VOC and FF.
Yang and co-workers demonstrated a new strategy to develop highly efficient and stable PSCs by employing a hydrophobic multifunctional surface layer of 3-alkylthiophene derivatives. The molecules comprise hydrophobic alkyl groups and unique delocalized conjugated π-systems that can shield the perovskite surface and improve charge extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface. The performance of these 3-hexylthiophene (HTP) multifunctional-layer-based PSCs showed high PCE of 19.89%.60 More importantly, the PCE of the functionalized device declined to less than 20% after being exposed to air for 700 h. These thiophene derivatives are also very useful for efficient carrier transfer from the perovskite to HTLs. The reduced PL intensity and TRPL lifetime of different thiophene-derivatives-functionalized PSCs indicated that the introduction of these derivatives could facilitate efficient charge extraction from the perovskite to the spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 7). Details of the recent progresses made in planar perovskite/HTL interface engineering are summarized in Table 3.

3.3. Interfacial modification of the inverted p-i-n structure
Devices with a regular n-i-p planar structure use a compact TiO2, ZnO, or SnO2 layer for electron transport. These devices exhibit low performance under forward scan and high performance under reverse scan, making it crucial to attain decent PCE. However, the hysteresis behavior in PSCs is considered to be caused by ion migration that is possibly induced by charge accumulation.126–128 The following are the possible reasons for the negligible hysteresis in the p-i-n structure. First, the effective passivation of the trap states by fullerenes may block ion migration.129 Second, fullerenes could efficiently extract electrons.130 Third, fullerenes could infiltrate into the perovskite absorbing layer along the GBs and pinholes, which extends the perovskite/fullerene interface contact area.62

3.3.1. HTL/perovskite interface. 
The modification of the HTM/perovskite interface plays an important role in inverted PSCs for efficient charge transfer, recombination minimization, and morphology control of the perovskite film.131 PEDOT:PSS is one of the most common HTL materials used in this configuration, due to its high conductivity and hydrophilic nature. However, its inferior electron-blocking capability and acidic nature are the two main reasons that cause low performance and stability issues in inverted PSCs.132–134
Poly-TPD was first introduced as an interlayer between the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface in the p-i-n structure of PSCs in order to minimize recombination losses at the interface. Wang et al. applied GeO2-incorporated PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, resulting in a higher work function (5.2 eV), better conductivity as compared to that obtained from pristine PEDOT:PSS, and improved performance (PCE: ∼15%) with better long-term stability of the PSCs.135 Similarly, Zhou et al. applied an ionic liquid for the first time, namely, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMIC), to modify the PEDOT:PSS surface and obtained a better performing HTL with a smoother surface and higher conductivity, as well as better energy level alignment with the perovskite. This ionic-liquid-modified strategy improved all the device parameters of the PSCs and boosted the PCE to 20.3%, which is higher than those obtained from any other PEDOT:PSS surface modification techniques.136 Tiefeng and co-workers reported a strategy to tune the surface properties of the PEDOT:PSS HTL with the small molecule of 4-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (BrB). This reaction converted the ionic bond in PEDOT:PSS into a covalent bond by the interaction of the SO3− group and the diazo cation during thermal annealing (TA).137 This modification strategy for acidic PEDOT:PSS encouraged the appearance of the required vertical charge transport distribution. Finally, BrB-PEDOT:PSS-based quasi-2D PSCs exhibited better performance (13.74%) in contrast to that of the control device (10.76%). Even when extraordinary performance was achieved, PEDOT:PSS was still not the ideal candidate as an HTL material because of its acidic nature and insufficient electron-blocking ability in p-i-n PSCs.
NiO is another promising inorganic HTL for use in p-i-n structures, possessing reasonably high mobility, higher work function, and good stability. This higher work function is essential for efficient hole transport and correlated with higher VOC.138 Unfortunately, the thickness and morphology of the NiO film considerably influences the charge collection and transport process, hampering the achievement of better PSC performance. Therefore, Yang and co-workers used the small molecule of diethanolamine (DEA) to tune the surface of the NiO nanocrystals, which reduced the conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3, as well as slowed down the formation process of the perovskite film, resulting in a high-quality interfacial contact and a better film, favorable for hysteresis-free better performing devices.139,140 Park et al. reported NiO with a worthwhile hole extraction ability by pulsed laser treatments with different favorable orientations.141 Moreover, Han and co-workers improved the performance and stability of PSC devices by employing lithium (Li)- and magnesium (Mg)-doped NiO, resulting in achieving fast charge carrier extraction even in 10–20 nm-thick layers, avoiding pinholes, and eliminating local structural defects over large areas.142
As a big class of HTLs, hydrophobic polymers are also used in p-i-n PSCs and famous for their better performance and good stability. However, the large surface energy difference between hydrophobic HTLs and hydrophilic perovskite precursor solutions hampers the fabrication of scalable PSCs.143,144 Therefore, Lee et al. introduced an interface compatibilizer called poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) between the perovskite and different hydrophobic HTLs (PTPD, PTAA, P3HT, PCDTBT, MEH-PPV, and PTB7-Th) because of its amphiphilic nature (Fig. 8). This ultrathin PFN layer (<5 nm) effectively modified the surface energy of the HTL and improved interfacial contact between the perovskite and HTLs. This surface modification facilitated efficient charge extraction along with the formation of high-quality perovskite films, which increased the stability and enhanced PSC performance.145 More details about the progress of HTL/perovskite interfacial modification are summarized in Table 4.

3.3.2. Perovskite/ETL interface. 
To passivate the lead vacancies at the perovskite/ETL interface, a perylene diimide polymer was copolymerized with dithienothiophene and introduced as an interlayer between the perovskite/PCBM. This interlayer significantly passivated the trap states and GBs of the perovskite by forming a Lewis adduct between the undercoordinated lead in the perovskite and sulfur in the PPDIDTT, ultimately improving its PV performance from 15.3% to 16.5%.146 Moreover, for the passivation of halide vacancies, Huang and co-workers inserted a π-conjugated Lewis base (IDIC) as an interlayer between the perovskite absorber and cathode. The n-type IDIC could efficiently extract the electrons from the perovskite layer along with the Lewis base end group that passivated the trap states. Consequently, a 5 nm blueshift and 87% quenching (13% greater than PCBM) was observed in the PL peak after the incorporation of IDIC, an indication of the passivated traps at the perovskite surface.62
Later on, Wang and co-workers introduced a polyvinylidene-trifluoroethylene copolymer (PVDF-TrFE), polystyrene, and Teflon thin layers between the perovskite absorber and ETM.147 Further, a 1% polystyrene layer significantly supported electron extraction between the perovskite and C60 through the tunneling process and improved the PCE to 20.3%. This thin polymer layer is beneficial for the protection of the perovskite film from moisture.148 Recently, Zheng et al. reported a choline chloride interlayer between the perovskite/C60 interface, which effectively passivated the ionic defects and GBs on the perovskite surfaces. This efficient defect passivation reduced the charge trap density and elongated the carrier lifetime, enhancing the VOC value from 1.04 to 1.15 V and boosting the PCE to 20.59%.149 Moreover, defect healing also significantly enhanced the stability of films under ambient conditions.
Li and co-workers demonstrated a strategy of targeted therapy by designing an intermediate layer material to fabricate efficient and stable PSCs by designing the hydrophobic fullerene derivative, namely, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid-N,N-dimethyl-3-(2-thienyl)propanamester (PCBB-S-N), containing amino moieties and the Lewis base thiophene. In the obtained intermediate layer material, the sulfur atoms in the thiophene have the ability to form a bond with the undercoordinated Pb ions, while the amino moieties create hydrogen bonds with the perovskite film to neutralize the migration of iodide ions and control the attack of H2O molecules on the perovskite surface. This PCBB-S-N layer has the ability to improve film growth, passivate defects, and reduce the band energy offset of the PCBM ETL. Consequently, the highest performance of 21% could be achieved with better stability, e.g., no degradation of the device after 1000 h under 40–50% relative humidity and annealed at 85 °C for 500 h without encapsulation (Fig. 9).150 Further details about the recent progresses made with regard to this interface are summarized in Table 5.

3.3.3. ETL/metal electrode interface. 
The existence of a dipole moment at the ETL/metal interface facilitates electron transport from the ETL to the metal electrode. For this purpose, a thin layer (0.5 nm) of lithium fluoride (LiF) was inserted between the PCBM and Al metal electrode, which created a dipole moment and reduced the energy barrier between them. As a result, electron transport from the ETL/Al interface increased, which amplified the JSC and FF values of the device.151 Similarly, an amino-functionalized polymer, namely, PN4N, was used for the interfacial modification of the ETL/metal electrode, which minimized the leakage current at the PCBM/Al electrode and passivated the trap states at this interface.152 This interfacial modification enhanced the PCE value of the devices from 12.4% to 15%. Brabec and co-workers developed perylene-diimide (PDINO) or ZnO interfacial materials that effectively tuned the PCBM/Ag electrode interface and also enhanced the VOC value.153 The insertion of PDINO provided the preferred energy levels for electron extraction, uniform films, reduced series resistance, and suppressed Ag ion diffusion during evaporation into the semiconductor interface. As a result, PDINO-based devices achieved 13% efficiency with better stability in contrast to ZnO-based devices.
Recently, a series of metal acetylacetonates (MAcac; metal: titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), and hafnium (Hf)) were introduced as the cathode interfacial layer (CILs), which are beneficial to suppress VOC losses due to better energy level alignment at the cathode interface. Such MAcac CILs were capable of efficiently reducing the interface energy barrier by a dipole effect produced by the CILs and boost electron extraction to form a barrier-free cathode. The steady-state PL spectra of MAcac-based devices indicate the fastest quenching after excitation with light in contrast to control devices and pure perovskite films. Among these interfacial layers, Zr-acetylacetonate-containing devices exhibited the best performance of 18.69% as compared to that obtained from control devices (12.43%) (Fig. 10).154 This significant improvement in performance was due to the close interfacial contacts among the PCBM/MAcac/Ag interfaces. Further details about the progress of ETL/electrode interface are summarized in Table 6.

4. GB engineering in PSCs
The optoelectronic properties of perovskite films depend on the crystallinity, which determines the defect density and GBs of materials.194 These GBs and defects have been recognized as recombination sites, which are responsible for the decrease in the device performance and increase in PSC instability.195–197 Therefore, the passivation of GBs by means of interfacial modification has also been widely studied.
To passivate these defects and GBs at the surface of the perovskite film, a nonstoichiometric approach was proposed to suppress the defects in perovskite films. It has already been established that 10% excess PbI2-containing perovskite precursor solution could improve the VOC (1.05 to 1.08 V) and FF (0.70% to 0.76%) values of PSCs, leading to enhanced performance from 15.95% to 18.42%.198 The origin of this performance improvement could be attributed to the passivation of GBs and larger grains along with superior crystallinity of the perovskite film. Similarly, Park and co-workers reported an efficient way of the healing process of GBs in CH3NH3PbI3 films by using the Lewis acid–base adduct approach.199 A thin layer of MAI formed on the GBs of CH3NH3PbI3 by spin-coating a precursor with 6 mol% excess amount of MAI. A thin layer of MAI created a highly ionic conducting pathway that was responsible for passivating the nonradiative recombination and enhance the electron extraction process. This excess MAI strategy enhanced the device performance to 20.01% with reduced hysteresis in the J–V curve.
It is well known that 3D PSCs could achieve outstandingly high performance, but its highly unstable nature is the main challenge for its commercialization. The introduction of certain 2D organic cations into a 3D perovskite crystal proved to be an effective method to enhance the perovskite stability,200 in which they acted as termination for the lattice, as well as functioned as a moisture and oxygen passivation layer and a layer for blocking ion migration. For example, Song et al. introduced the 2D microcrystal of C6H18N2O2PbI4 into the precursor solution of perovskites, which vertically passivated the GBs in the perovskite. This dominant vertical alignment did not affect the extraction of charge carriers. Therefore, a high PCE value of 21.06% could be achieved with ultrastable (maintaining 90% of the original PCE after 3000 h in air) planar PSCs (Fig. 11).201 In addition, the incorporation of n-butyl ammonium cations into a mixed-cation lead mixed-halide 3D perovskite exhibited improved stability and performance. This 2D material formed perovskite platelets that were scattered between the 3D perovskite grains, which facilitated the passivation of nonradiative charge recombinations, which reduced the J–V curve hysteresis, improved efficiency, and significantly enhanced the operational stability in the resulting solar cells. These 2D/3D PSCs with an optimal content of butyl ammonium yielded average PCE values of 17.5% and 15.8% with a perovskite material having bandgaps of 1.61 and 1.72 eV, respectively. The stability under simulated sunlight was also enhanced. The device retained 80% of its post burn-in PCE after 1000 h in air and close to 4000 h when encapsulated.202

Solvent annealing (SA) has been proven to be an efficient way to improve the morphology and reduce the trap states in perovskite films by improving grain growth and crystallinity.203–205 Huang et al., for the first time, described that the SA of perovskite films with the DMF solvent effectively improved the grain size up to the range of 1 μm, while a TA film had a grain size of ∼260 nm, resulting in increased PCE from 14.5% to 15.6% (Fig. 12).206 Similarly, Chen and co-workers used pyridine vapor during the SA of a perovskite film, which enlarged the crystalline domain size up to 5 μm, which was 10 times that of its TA counterpart. This pyridinic SA process facilitated the enhancement of crystallinity and passivation of surface defects in the perovskite film, leading to an increase in the PCE to 14.31%, which was 50% better than that of the control device.207 Recently, Yang et al. established that the SA of the perovskite film under a DMSO vapor atmosphere formed the intermediate phase of MA2Pb3I8 (DMSO)2 at the GBs between the perovskite crystalline domains. Therefore, large grain sizes were produced in the perovskite film due to the formation and decomposition of this nonequilibrium intermediate MA2Pb3I8 (DMSO)2 phase. By adopting the same mechanism, they used a vapor comprising mixed MABr/DMSO to improve GB migration and increase the grain size; the PCE improved from 15.13% to 17.64%.208

Li et al. introduced a cross-linkage between CH3NH3PbI3 and a bifunctional organic molecule (bifunctional butyl phosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride, 4-ABPACl) via hydrogen bonding, which significantly passivated the defects and GBs and led to improving the PCE from 8% to 16.6%.209 Moreover, Han and co-workers used PCBM in the antisolvent method as the dripping solvent on the perovskite layer to form a graded heterojunction (GHJ) structure. This structure passivated the recombination losses and enhanced the photoelectron collection. Consequently, a certified PCE value of 18.21% could be achieved for an aperture area of 1.022 cm2.210 Furthermore, Qiao et al. demonstrated the effects of different additives such as BMImI, LiI, and LiTFSI, which were incorporated into the PbI2 precursor solution. These additives efficiently improved the grain size and crystallinity of the perovskite film by reducing the PbI2 residues and also enhancing the carrier lifetime, ultimately improving the device VOC and FF values. The PCE values of the control device increased from 10.3% to 15.6%, 17.01%, and 18% after the incorporation of LiTFSI, LiI, and BMImI, respectively. The introduction of these additives yielded a decrease in degradation with 57%, 60%, and 91% PCE, respectively, after exposure to air for 70 days as compared to a 93% decrease in PCE for a pristine cell after only 24 days.211
Similarly, another work by Han et al. introduced the ionic liquid of methyl ammonium acetate (MAAc) and the molecular additive of thiosemicarbazide (TSC) into the perovskite precursor solution. The incorporation of these additives into the perovskite resulted in the formation of a uniform film with large grain size, ultrasmooth surface over inch-sized planar substrates, and low density of defect states.212 The better crystallinity of the perovskites could be attributed to the simultaneous improvement in the performance and durability of the PSCs; further, a PCE value of 19.19% could be achieved for a large-area aperture of 1.025 cm2 (Fig. 13).

The introduction of a polymer inside the perovskite precursor is another worthwhile approach to control the nucleation process and crystal growth in order to overcome the defect states, e.g., pinholes and GBs. Similarly, Bi et al. incorporated a polymer (PMMA) as the template inside the perovskite precursor solution. This polymer doping facilitated the nucleation process in the form of heterogeneous nucleation due to lowering of the nucleation free energy barriers when compared with that in the homogeneous nucleation, thereby creating an intermediate adduct with PbI2 that slowed down the crystal growth. These two effects led to the formation of shiny perovskite films with fewer defects and larger grain sizes and ultimately leading to longer carrier lifetimes and PCE above 21%.213 Recently, Liu et al. demonstrated that the use of the J71 polymer as a dopant in perovskites could facilitate the fabrication of pinhole-free perovskite films with larger and higher quality of grains, which considerably reduced the trap state density and eliminated the J–V hysteresis; consequently, the PCE improved to 19.19%.214 The TRPL data revealed that the average recombination lifetime for the control device (34.16 ns) was much higher than the average recombination lifetime for the J71-containing device (23.02 ns), indicating that more efficient carrier transport and collection could occur in the presence of the J71 polymer. Jen and co-workers used a simple way to improve the crystallization of perovskites by the addition of 1 wt% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) into the perovskite precursor solution to modulate the thin-film formation. The capacity of the bidentate halogenated additives to temporarily chelate with Pb2+ during crystal growth could be evidenced by the improved solubility of PbCl2 in the presence of DIO, which facilitated homogenous nucleation and could alter the favorable interfacial energy, eventually modifying the kinetics of crystal growth. This enhanced crystallization improves the charge transfer efficiency between the CTLs and the perovskite absorber, boosting the performance from 9% to 12% (Fig. 14).215

Recently, the incorporation of quasi-2D materials into a perovskite layer has become a popular approach to passivate defects and GBs. For example, Baillie et al., for the first time, incorporated the quasi-2D material of phenethylammonium cation (PEA+) into a (HC(NH2)2PbI3)0.85(CH3NH3PbBr3)0.15 perovskite, which could efficiently passivate the GBs and defects in the perovskite layer.200 This PEA+ doping increased the PL intensity and carrier lifetime, resulting in improved VOC for the device for doping concentrations below 4.5%. This doping strategy efficiently improved the device stability as compared to that of the control device. Additional details about the effect of different treatments and additives on the grain size and PSC performances are summarized in Table 7.

5. Stress engineering in PSCs
Mechanics is critical to a wide range of energy materials and technologies as mechanical stability often determines the reliability and durability of energy devices when coupled with stimuli such as chemical, heat, and light. For example, mechanical failure in Li-ion batteries is significant as the stress-induced structural disintegration impedes electron conduction and increases electric resistances.225 For hybrid perovskites, a fracture can not only lead to a loss in ohmic contact, but also create an accelerated pathway for the diffusion of volatile compounds and penetration of moisture.226 A better understanding and control over film stress can lead to enhanced performance and reduced failures.
In 2015, Sun et al. measured the mechanical properties of perovskite single crystals (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) by a nanoindentation experiment.227 The materials were found to be elastically strained with elastic moduli varying in the halide system, showing the generic trend of ECl > EBr > EI. This trend could be attributed to the different crystal structures belonging to them. Further analysis showed that the trend of moduli correlated well with that of the chemical bonding formed with each halide (e.g., Pb–X bonding), packing density, and hydrogen bonding between the organic cations and halide anions (Fig. 15). It is expected that this chemical bonding should influence the elastic response, but which bonding is dominant remains unclear. Later, Zhou et al. discovered that perovskites, in the form of both single crystals and films, experienced lattice expansion under light irradiation (a volumetric change was observed).228 The photogenerated carriers were supposed to be coupled with the lattice as the photostrictive effect was found to be dependent on the photon energy (Fig. 16). Changes in the aforementioned hydrogen bonding, which helps to stabilize the inorganic octahedron, were proposed to be the origin of the photoinduced lattice expansion, which was directly experimentally observed by Tsai et al.229 Namely, under super-band-gap excitation, the electron density at the halide sites is reduced, resulting in the weakening of the Coulomb interaction with the organic cations, which eventually results in a larger cell unit (Fig. 16d). Tsai et al. did not observe this phenomenon.229 Since the aforementioned chemical bonds are closely related with the intrinsic lattice strain, stress engineering can be performed by modifying the elemental composition at the relevant sites, which was firstly done by Saidaminov et al.230 In their work, Cl and Cd were incorporated to reduce the Pb–X bond strength because of their smaller ionic radius as compared to those of I and Pb, respectively, as well as the Pb–X–Pb distortion, both of which contribute toward lattice relaxation and tremendous enhancement (an order of magnitude) in the operational stability under ambient conditions.

While the work mentioned above mainly focuses on the local lattice imperfections (microstrain) in the perovskite, the residual stress of the film is also a formidable concern since it directly affects the reliability and durability of working devices. As tested by Rolston et al., PSCs present an extremely low fracture energy (Gc < 1.5 J m−2) and a tradeoff between Gc and PCE (Fig. 17a),231 indicating that the devices are mechanically fragile and have a large room for improvement with regard to fracture resistance.226 They also observed a dependency of Gc on the grain size, as shown in Fig. 17b. The presence of defects and GBs decreases the cohesion of the perovskite layers; therefore, larger grains result in higher resistance for the cracks to propagate. The intrinsic residual stress was found to be tensile stemming from the film formation procedure, that is, the perovskite is subject to less volumetric shrinkage due to a large mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) between the perovskite (CTE: ∼5 × 10−5 K−1) and the underlying substrate (for glass, CTE = ∼1 × 10−5 K−1). The measured stress was as large as 50 MPa, considerably impacting the operational stability. The authors offered some simple strategies to generate tensile-strain-free films; for example, adopting a low-temperature processing method or a polymeric substrate with higher CTE or applying external compressive stress during perovskite formation.232 In addition to the presence of tensile strain, Huang et al. reported that perovskites vertically contracted so as to compensate for reduced lateral shrinkage, generating compressive strain in the out-of-plane direction.233 They engineered the residual strain by compressively pre-straining the substrate, yielding films with larger activation energy for ion migration (0.083 vs. 0.074 eV and 0.53 vs. 0.39 eV for illuminated and dark conditions, respectively) and suppressed degradation. Moreover, Zhu et al. recently verified a gradient distribution of residual strain along the normal with depth-dependent and tilt-angle-dependent XRD measurements, which could be mainly attributed to the temperature gradient experienced by the film.234 From their perspective, the film was roughly divided into the surface region and the bottom one: the former experienced less volumetric shrinkage due to a faster cooling process when compared with the latter. This explained the higher tensile strain on the surface layer. This inhomogeneous distribution of strain resulted into energy-level gradient, band bending, and potentially unfavorable interfacial carrier transport (Fig. 18a and b). By simply flipping over the film for experiencing an inverted temperature gradient, the film became more strain-free with an enhancement in carrier motilities (Fig. 18c).

6. Summary and future outlook
The outstanding properties of perovskite materials, namely, small exciton binding energy, direct bandgap, ambipolar carrier transport properties, and long carrier diffusion, render them to be promising light absorbers to convert solar energy into electricity. Comprehensive knowledge about the perovskite properties as well as understanding of device physics is imperative for effecting improvements in device performance and accelerating the commercialization process. PSC interfaces have an important role in charge carrier extractions and transportations. Significant efforts and substantial experimentation have confirmed that interfaces not only affect device performances, but also pertain to stability and hysteresis.
In this review, we have discussed the current progresses made in interface and structural modifications in the corresponding CTLs of both planar and mesoscopic structures in PSCs, and we have established that the hysteresis effects of the forward and reverse scans in the J–V curves can be eliminated and long-term stability can be obtained. After reviewing the important roles of interface engineering, GBs, and stress engineering in enhancing PSC efficiency, mitigating J–V hysteresis, and improving device stability, we believe that interface and structural modifications, as expected from the design aspects, can make remarkable contributions to the future progress in PSCs as it has achieved in other PV technologies.
For interface design, the fundamental interfacial atomic and electronic structures have to be fully understood and controlled. Interfacial interactions and lattice match are always considered when fabricating a crystal film device. Moreover, whether a heterointerface in this cell is sufficiently stable for long-term working or not is a crucial question. From this aspect, interface engineering can be an effective approach to enhance cell stability. For the low-cost large-scale application of such cells, an HTM-free cell with a carbon electrode may be a good option.235 In this case, some new methods and technologies are needed to suppress back-surface recombinations in such nanometer-scale devices. Overall, much work on the interfaces in these cells needs to be done. Moreover, regardless of the PSC application, further development and investigation on new materials and heterojunction device design can be inspiring.
Currently, the most efficient PSCs are still based on toxic Pb metal cations. Perovskites based on nontoxic elements can be critical for environmentally benign clean energy supply. In this regard, cations of nontoxic metals (such as Sn, Bi, and Ge) have been proposed as alternatives, but the performance of PSCs based on these elements need to be significantly improved. The stability of perovskite crystals must also be taken into account to ensure the reliable and long-term ambient environment operation of perovskite devices. It is understood that the rapid decomposition of such perovskite devices in the presence of humidity, UV light, and even bias stress is a growing concern for device reliability.
While the majority of progresses made in perovskite PVs have mainly concerned material development and device optimization, there is still a long way to go regarding the understanding of fundamental photophysics and excited-state properties and dynamics. Moreover, some critical questions are still unclear, such as the nature of the initial photogenerated species, PL origin, timescale of mobile charge formation, nature of traps and defects, function of the organic molecules in the perovskite structure, and dependence of all these aspects on device preparation.

 	Fig. 17  (a) Tradeoff between the measured fracture energy (Gc) and efficiency of PSCs. (a) Grain-size-dependent Gc values: larger grain size results into stronger cohesion of the perovskite layer. Reproduced with permission.226 Copyright 2016, Elsevier.	 

 	Fig. 18  Impacts from film strain on bandgap, band alignment, and carrier dynamics. (a) Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the band structures under biaxial tensile, zero, and compressive strains. (b) Evolution of band alignments based on the calculations from (a) with/without vertical gradient strains. (c) Measured hole mobilities based on hole-only space-charge-limited current (SCLC) device with/without residual tensile strain.
