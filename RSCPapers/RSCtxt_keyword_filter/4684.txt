    , Accepted 10th October 2013First published on 15th October 2013AbstractNaphthalene diimide (NDI) main chain conjugated polymers have seen a high and steadily increasing level of activity during the last five years. It is mainly the intriguing properties of high electron mobilities and tunable absorption up to the near IR region that have driven researchers to design new polymeric structures having main chain NDIs in the backbone. While the field is still in its infancy, many important results have been obtained and the first structure–function relationships can be drawn. By reviewing synthetic aspects (step growth and chain growth polycondensation techniques), polymeric architectures made, structure formation, and applications in OFET devices and organic photovoltaics, the reader is equipped with some of the key aspects of this important class of materials.Michael SommerMichael Sommer finished his PhD thesis in 2009 on semiconducting block copolymers for organic electronic devices under the supervision of Mukundan Thelakkat at the University of Bayreuth, Germany. In 2010 he joined the group of Wilhelm Huck at the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, UK, as a post-doctoral researcher. Since the beginning of 2012 he has been building up an independent research group at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Germany. His research interests encompass the synthesis of conjugated materials, controlled polymerisation methods, self-assembly and structure–function relationships of electronically active materials.
1. Introduction
Naphthalene diimide (NDI) is the lowest member in the class of rylene diimides.1 The NDI unit plays a major role in the research fields supramolecular chemistry, electron transfer systems, and materials for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).2–9 The electron accepting property of the NDI core, which stems from the two strongly electron-withdrawing imide groups, leads to low-lying LUMO levels and appreciably high electron mobilities.8,9 However, it is not only the planarity and electron-deficient nature of NDI derivatives that is beneficial for charge transport properties of n-channel OFET devices, but also its chemical and photochemical stability, possibility for derivatization at carbons 2,3,6,7 of the naphthalene core and additionally at the imide positions (Scheme 1), which are the main reasons why this building block enjoys special attention in materials science.

A common property of all rylene diimides, and so NDI, is that the imide substituents do not severely influence the electronic properties of the single molecule. The reason is that a node exists in the wavefunction at the imide nitrogen, which largely isolates the NDI unit from inductive or mesomeric effects of the imide substituent. By contrast, the two N-substituents govern the crystal packing of small molecule NDI derivatives in the solid state to such a degree that transistor performance can range between excellent (mobilities >1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and OFET inactivity.9–12 Functionalization of the NDI core at carbons 2 and 6 extends the conjugated system and therefore alters UV-vis absorption and energy levels.13,14 It is exactly this property which is attractive to materials scientists, as it allows design and control of electronic interactions between the NDI core and the selected neighbouring π-system. For a broader overview of the use of small molecule NDI derivatives and n-channel polymeric materials in organic electronic devices the reader is directed elsewhere.8,9,15–17 However, while the potential of small molecule NDI derivatives as n-channel materials has been recognized as early as 1996,18 it took more than 20 years before the incorporation into the main chain conjugated polymers was pursued. In 2008, several papers appeared on the synthesis and properties of naphthalene diimide copolymers,19–21 shortly after the first report on a soluble perylene bisimide-based main chain copolymer.22 Subsequently, outstanding high and air-stable electron-mobilities of P(NDI-T2), which is the main chain copolymer of NDI with bithiophene, of up to 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1 were reported.23 Since these seminal papers, intense efforts are being made by a number of groups that focus on advancing synthesis methods, generating new materials by the combination of aromatic comonomers and NDI, elucidating structure formation, and understanding (opto)electronic properties. Besides the main chain copolymers in which NDI units are incorporated via the 2-and 6-positions (Scheme 1a), more exotic angular-shaped24,25 (Scheme 1b) and core-extended versions26 (Scheme 1c) have been prepared as well. By reviewing synthetic aspects, polymeric structures made, structure formation and applications in organic electronics, the reader is equipped with some of the key aspects of this emerging class of materials.
2. Polymerisation methods and comonomers
2.1. Step growth polycondensation
Any standard transition-metal catalysed cross-coupling scheme can be used to prepare conjugated polymers with main chain NDI units. In combination with thiophene-based comonomers, Stille polycondensation is preferentially used, and this was also the method of choice for preparing NDI copolymers with different thiophene comonomers (Scheme 2 and Table 1).19,20,23,27,28 The most often used synthetic approach is based on the monomer NDIBr2 with branched alkyl substituents R. The general synthesis scheme is shown in Scheme 2.

Stille coupling schemes are well-established and can in many cases readily be employed without the need for extensive optimization.29 Generally, the molecular weights of NDI copolymers that can be obtained by this method seem appreciably high (Mn,SEC ∼ 50–250 kDa),19,20 although the determination of absolute numbers is not trivial (see below for a comment on MW determination of NDI copolymers). Additional advantages of Stille protocols are high temperatures, base-free conditions, and the use of very good solvents such as chlorobenzene,30 all of which broaden the monomer scope and efficiently address solubility problems. Monomers with ethynyl groups can also be polymerized to molecular weights of Mn,SEC = 3–20 kDa using Stille coupling.31,32 But the well-established Stille polycondensation is not without drawbacks. Organotin compounds are highly toxic, hence special precaution is required during monomer and copolymer synthesis. Particular care must be taken when using neurotoxic trimethyltin chloride33 for monomer synthesis, as this reagent is water-soluble and hence can easily be distributed in body fluids or in the environment. The reason why this reagent is still frequently used originates from the facts that excess trimethyltin chloride is easily removed during work-up, and also that the resulting monomers can be recrystallized to obtain excellent purities required for polycondensation. Immunotoxic tributyltin chloride is considered somewhat less problematic,33 however tributyltin-based monomers are more difficult to crystallize and hence need to be purified by column chromatography. Moreover, traces of tributyltin chloride are challenging to separate from the monomer by conventional column chromatography. As a result, monomer purities can be lower. In this context, a recent paper on the use of a potassium carbonate–silica gel mixture as a stationary phase appears to be promising to remove excess tributyltin chloride in order to obtain monomer purities that are comparable to the trimethyltin analogs.34
Suzuki polycondensation (SPC) is one possibility to circumvent the issues associated with organo-tin compounds.51 The polymerization of NDIBr2 with aromatic hydrocarbon-based monomers via SPC has been reported for phenyl-, naphthalene-, pyrene- and fluorene-based monomers.35,36 Here, the molecular weights thus far obtained seem lower, but it is unclear whether this arises from unoptimized reaction conditions or other factors that are inherent to SPC in these specific cases. SPC has also been applied to copolymerize NDIBr2 with 2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diboronic acid bis(pinacol) ester. Initially, unoptimized results with Pd(PtBu3)2 as a catalyst gave Mn,SEC ∼ 10 kDa at least, while other catalytic systems such as Pd(PPH3)4 performed worse.52 SPC involving thiophene boronic esters generally suffers from protodeborylation, and hence an in situ degradation of monomer stoichiometry.53 An expansion of the commonly arene-based monomers for SPC to thiophene-based structures is an intriguing field of research, and future studies will need to address problems associated with monomer stability.
In a recent paper Sajoto et al. used Sonogashira coupling to prepare a set of alternating copolymers of NDI and diethynylbenzene with relatively high Mn,SEC ∼ 50 kDa.37 This study demonstrated that Sonogashira is a viable alternative to Stille polycondensation, which can also been applied to prepare NDI copolymers with diethynyl-based comonomers (Scheme 2c).
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the recently proposed palladium-catalyzed direct arylation polycondensation method has been applied to a thiophene-extended NDI monomer with 3,4-dimethylthiophene as a comonomer by Mori et al.50 Values of Mn ∼ 10 kDa were obtained, which can certainly be optimized given the meanwhile promising molecular weights that can be achieved by this method.54 An overview of NDI copolymer structures synthesized so far is given in Scheme 3 and the physical properties are compiled in Table 1.

In some cases the molecular weights of conjugated polymers are lower than Mn,SEC ∼ 10 kDa. Considering these low values and the high monomer masses of the NDI building block with branched side chains (825 g mol−1 for 2-octyldodecyl side chains), those materials probably do not classify as polymers. As material properties are highly dependent on chain length in this range, meaningful results are difficult to obtain from oligomeric mixtures, or from comparison of different materials with different low molecular weights. This is a general issue with materials made by polycondensation, which is in many cases not addressed in detail. However, optimizing polycondensation is very challenging owing to the large parameter space, the process of which is often complicated by the limited amount of monomer made by multi-step synthesis. While SEC generally facilitates comparability between literature results, the stiffness of the NDI-based polymer backbone leads to overestimated MWsSEC, hence the already low MW can be regarded as upper limit. SEC calibration is useful to access absolute MWs. Senkovskyy et al. has used P(NDI-T2) oligomers of known chain length to compare SEC MW data with polystyrene calibration.43 Such an estimate can give a reasonable estimate for small chain lengths but probably fails for higher MW. Universal SEC calibration55 is likely to be useful as well, but has so far not been reported for the class of NDI copolymers. Occasionally, aggregation in solution is discussed as a potential source of additional error of SEC-based MW.19,27,28 In many cases THF at room temperature is a sufficiently good solvent, and only concentration needs to be low enough to prevent possible aggregates. Fortunately, the extinction coefficient of NDI copolymers is high, hence very low concentrations can be used and chromatograms can still reliably be acquired with UV detectors. Alternatively, NMR end group analysis can give additional information on number average MWs.44 In step growth polycondensation, this requires detailed knowledge of all end groups, chemical shifts that are not superimposed by backbone signals, and carefully measured and evaluated spectra. This is indeed challenging, but can sometimes at least serve as a comparison for SEC values in order to get a qualitative understanding for the degree of MW overestimation. Moreover, NMR end group analysis can be extremely useful for guiding optimization of polymerisation, as side- and termination reactions can be revealed, knowledge of which might allow the change of the parameters that limit MW.56,57
2.2. Chain growth polycondensation
Well-established conventional step-growth cross-coupling polycondensation is extremely useful for synthesising NDI copolymers (and conjugated polymers in general) with varying comonomers. However, these methods suffer from limited control over molecular weight, dispersity and end groups. In addition, well-defined polymeric architectures such as block copolymers, graft copolymers or polymer brushes are difficult to obtain using step growth polycondensation. Albeit molecular weight can be optimized and sometimes be tuned by stoichiometry control, dispersity can be narrowed by fractionation, and end groups can be installed by end capping (in fact end the installation of thiophene or phenyl end groups after polycondensation is often taken for granted although the presence of active end groups and catalyst, which is prerequisite, is not often ascertained), such properties require large efforts of optimization and are additionally dependent on the kinetics of step growth polycondensations. If well-defined molecular weights and narrow polydispersities are the synthetic target, a chain growth mechanism that allows predetermination of molecular weight is clearly to be preferred. The Kumada catalyst transfer polycondensation (KCTP)58 and Suzuki chain growth polycondensation59 are two of the few chain growth techniques available. In order to convert an NDI-based monomer precursor into an active, polymerizable monomer suitable for KCTP, structures such as NDITh2Br2a are needed (Scheme 4). However, it turned out that by using Grignard metathesis the conversion of a into NDITh2BrMgCl b is not possible, as a charge transfer complex of NDITh2Br2 and tBuMgCl (or other Grignards) forms.42 This complex deactivates the Grignard reactant thus prohibiting any further reaction. Thus, a simple transfer of known KCTP reaction conditions to electron-deficient monomers based on naphthalene diimide is not possible (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  The Kumada catalyst transfer polycondensation of monomer precursor a with tBuMgCl is not possible as the active monomer b does not form. The addition of Rieke zinc to a leads to radical anion c, which can be polymerized to d having controlled molecular weight, end groups and narrow dispersity. Insertion of Zn into the thiophene-bromine bond to give e does not occur, as quenching of c with water yields precursor a. 
In early 2011, V. Senkovskyy et al. made the intriguing observation that the addition of Rieke zinc, which is a colloidal suspension of metallic zinc,60 to a results in immediate dissolution of the metal and in a color change from orange to green (Scheme 4).42 Later it was found that this reaction, which was intended to generate the Negishi-type monomer NDITh2BrZnBr e, produces the radical anion NDITh2Br2Zn c. The detailed structure of NDITh2Br2Zn c is not fully understood; a dimer involving a zinc–zinc bond61 seems plausible but more efforts need to be made to gain the full picture of this compound. Even more surprisingly, radical anion c polymerized in the presence of nickel catalysts such as Ni(dppe)Cl2 in a chain growth manner to give P(ThNDITh) d. The transition metal-catalyzed polymerization of a radical anion complex was unknown at that time, and so a new class of monomers that could be polymerized in a chain growth fashion was born (Scheme 4).
Mechanistically, the chain growth polymerization of NDITh2Br2Zn c requires Ni(0)dppe to “ring walk”62 over a distance larger than 1 nm before intramolecular oxidative addition into the thiophene bromine bond can occur. At the same time, Ni(0)dppe “ring walking” must occur over a heterogeneous backbone consisting of electron-deficient NDI and electron-rich thiophene groups. Senkovskyy et al. have recently strengthened the initially assumed picture of the intramolecular oxidative addition leading to controlled polymerization.43 Moreover, Ni(0)dppe species, which were meanwhile accepted intermediates in KCTP, were proven for the first time. The possibility to identify Ni(0)dppe by NMR spectroscopy suggested a high stability of this key intermediate. Density functional theory calculations were employed to gain a deeper insight into the mechanism of the Ni-catalyzed polymerisation of radical anion NDITh2Br2Zn c. These nicely revealed the relative energies of several “ring walking” intermediates and confirmed a stabilization of Ni(0)dppe by −122 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 1). This significant stabilization energy is probably larger than that of Ni(0)dppe complexes with simple thiophene-based monomers and hence provides a reason why the long-proposed Ni(0)dppe intermediate could be observed spectroscopically.43

The discovery of the peculiar monomer NDITh2Br2Zn c and its polymerization is interesting on its own, but is also advantageous in several ways. First of all, MW determination by NMR end group analysis is greatly facilitated as only Br, H, or phenyl caps (depending on the catalyst used) occur which have sufficiently different chemical shifts.42 Secondly, well-defined materials with controlled MW and narrow dispersity can be made, which facilitates reproducibility at the materials' synthesis stage. It is not clear yet whether well-controlled material parameters, such as MW, polydispersity and end groups, will have significant advantages in terms of device performance. However, it is certain that individual aspects such as spectroscopy or crystallization can be investigated more reliably. Thirdly, block copolymers or even more advanced polymeric architectures are accessible which are useful to control phase separation in polymer blends for photovoltaics.63 Lastly, the use of zinc instead of toxic tin compounds is highly attractive for both academic research as well as upscaling.
An extension of the controlled polymerization of radical anions towards other monomers is currently ongoing, and it can be assumed that the mechanism is of general applicability to monomers with a similar structure. One current drawback of this method lies in the structure of the symmetric monomer precursor, which limits the structural possibilities of the conjugated backbone. Asymmetric monomers may be possible but are not straightforward in terms of purification and high yields. An interesting outlook is the statistical copolymerization of two different radical anion monomers, which would partially circumvent the limitation mentioned above.
2.3. Chemical structures of NDI copolymers
Since the first reports on the promising device performance of P(NDI-T2), a plethora of comonomers have been copolymerized with NDIBr2 using Pd-catalyzed Stille, Suzuki, and Sonogashira methods. The most often used building blocks are combinations of NDIBr2 with phenyl-, thiophene- and selenophene-based comonomers, whereby almost exclusively branched side chains need to be placed on the imide nitrogen to impart sufficient solubility.21,28,31,32,35–41,45–49,64 The variety of structures reported so far is shown in Scheme 3, and the corresponding physical and electronic properties are collected in Table 1.
Alternating NDI main chain copolymers with electron-rich comonomers exhibit small band gaps, the size of which can be controlled by e.g. the strength of the donor monomer. As is the usual case in such “push–pull” systems of alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient comonomers, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are mainly determined by the electronic properties of the donor monomer and NDI units, respectively, and the extent of their interaction. Thus, with increasing donor monomer strength the absorption onset of the charge-transfer band shifts to longer wavelengths and the band gap decreases. For instance, for alternating copolymers of NDI and the weak donor benzene, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels determined by cyclic voltammetry in the film are −6.1 eV and −3.74 eV, respectively.35 Replacing benzene with thiophene strongly influences the HOMO energy level but leaves the LUMO energy level almost unaffected, leading to HOMO and LUMO values of ∼−5.6 eV and ∼−3.8 eV, respectively.19,35 These trends continue with increasing length of the thiophene comonomer19,27,28 or with decreasing torsional angle between two thiophene rings, both of which increase the donor strength.19,28 As a result, the absorption maximum of the charge transfer band can nicely be tuned from ∼550 nm up to ∼1000 nm with increasing donor strength.19,35,37
The Marder group has recently investigated a series of phenylethynylene NDI copolymers in which different side chains were installed on the phenylethynylene comonomer.37 This study, among others, demonstrated that fine-tuning the electronic properties is feasible within a relatively large range via changing the donor's substituent but leaving the donor monomer itself constant.19,37
Besides the NDI copolymer structures shown in Scheme 1a, other NDI monomers have been presented with more exotic skeletons. Chen et al. have synthesized an NDI monomer of angular shape which was subsequently copolymerized with mono-, bi-and terthiophene (Scheme 1b).24 The angular shape resulted in a decreased electronic communication between NDI and the thiophene comonomer, which manifested in lowered HOMO energy levels and increased band gaps.24 Another possibility to derivatize the NDI framework is the extension at the naphthalene core at the 2,3 and 6,7-positions. Fukutomi et al. devised a synthetic procedure for the preparation of naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b′]-dithiophenediimide, which is the core-extended version with fused thiophenes, and their copolymerization with bithiophene (see Scheme 1c).26 This new building block features a high degree of planarity, a small band gap of 1.2 eV in copolymers with bithiophene, and ambipolar charge transport.26
3. Thin film structure
Structure formation in thin films of alternating copolymers of NDI and other comonomers is complex. In addition to the often observed main-chain–side-chain separation in hairy-rod conjugated polymers that results in lamellar structures with prominent (100) reflections, aromatic heterogeneous backbones comprising alternating electron rich and electron deficient building blocks provide even more possibilities to place two conjugated polymers on top of each other. For instance, attractive self-interactions between two NDI units of two stacked chains can be thought of, but also cross-interactions between NDI and electron-rich comonomer units are possible. Such cross-interactions have been reported in the form e.g. foldamers or small molecule liquid crystals.65,66 Guo et al. observed that the color of a solution turned blue (λmax = 588 nm) upon mixing molecular unsubstituted NDI and 3,3′-alkoxybithiophene, while both the individual molecules absorb only up to 381 nm,19 indicating a charge transfer complex and hence substantial attractive forces between the two monomeric building blocks.
The thin film structure of the most intensively investigated NDI copolymer, P(NDI-T2), is characterized by the dihedral angle between the NDI and bithiophene units, the average backbone orientation on substrates, and its unit cell. Rivnay et al. observed a change of the orientation of Bragg planes after thermal treatment above the melting point, which were interpreted as backbone reorientation from face-on to edge-on.67,68
In congruence with these results, Schuettfort et al. were able to distinguish between the backbone orientation of P(NDI-T2) at the polymer–air interface and in the bulk of films using GIWAXS and NEXAFS simultaneously (Fig. 2). They found that while the orientation of the backbone in the bulk of the film changes from rather face-on to edge-on upon melt-annealing, the backbone orientation at the polymer–air interface was edge-on in all cases.69

In this context it is interesting to note that density functional theory suggests a relatively large dihedral angle between the NDI and bithiophene moieties of 44°–47°,69–71 which is rationalized by steric repulsion between the imide oxygen and hydrogen atom on the thiophene ring at the 3-position. This considerably large value challenges the determination of backbone orientation. Giussani et al. have provided further insight into this question by using reflection-absorption IR spectroscopy (RAIRS). A parallel orientation of the bithiophene unit to the substrate in spin coated films was determined with a dihedral angle to the NDI unit of 38°, while after melt-annealing a markedly altered orientation of both species was noted.72
Regarding the bulk structure of films of P(NDI-T2), the existence of two polymorphs was suggested.67,68 Using epitaxial crystallization and electron diffraction, the unit cells of two polymorphs of P(NDI-T2) have been recently determined by Brinkmann et al. (Fig. 3).44

The striking features of these two polymorphs were segregated and mixed structures with respect to the overlap of monomeric units of stacked backbones. The segregated structure, which was obtained by directional epitaxial crystallization on frozen trichlorobenzene, is characterized by packing of NDI units of different backbones on top of each other, while in the segregated structure bithiophene units are placed on top of NDI units, i.e. a c/2 shift (Fig. 3). The segregated structure was obtained by crystallization on friction-transferred PTFE, or can alternatively be generated by heating the segregated structure over the melting point, which is ∼300 °C. Equally intriguing, Brinkmann et al. could directly visualize NDI and bithiophene units of P(NDI-T2) backbones by high-resolution TEM.44 From these results it appears that the mixed structure is thermodynamically more stable. While it remains unclear to what extent the energetics of self- and cross-interactions, and the steric hindrance of the branched side chains contribute to these two polymorphs, it is interesting to note that the known cross-interactions of NDI and electron-rich building blocks19,65,66 seem to play an important role in the structure formation of P(NDI-T2) as well.
With these results many details of the structure of P(NDI-T2) have been clarified. However, apart from P(NDI-T2), little is known about the self-organization and structure of other NDI copolymers. In some cases a lamellar structure of conjugated backbones and alkyl side chains is seen, which corresponds to the well-known main chain side chain separation, but further details remain unclear.28,38 Alvey et al. investigated optical properties and structure formation by wide angle X-ray scattering of NDI copolymers with acene-based comonomers as a function of comonomer size. They arrived at the conclusion that the NDI moieties mainly arrange in a rather segregated fashion with a slight offset along the backbone direction.32
A comprehensive view of structure formation in NDI copolymers as a function of comonomer and side chains is yet to be established. While methods such as TEM,44,73 X-ray scattering,67–69 NEXAFS,69,70 RAIRS72 belong to the most important techniques to determine backbone orientation and thin film structure, simulations and modeling are equally important to corroborate experimental results and vice versa.44,69 In addition, solid-state NMR can provide important information about the proximity of two stacked backbones of comprising alternating donor and acceptor monomers.74 The simultaneous adaptation and use of such methods, and the synthesis of new materials will certainly shine light on this issue in the near future.
4. Electronic properties and device applications
NDI derivatives exhibit a high degree of photochemical, chemical and oxidative stability. This property is of advantage in main chain NDI conjugated copolymers as well. Additionally, the low-lying LUMO energy level of ∼−4.0 eV of P(NDI-T2), which is mainly determined by the NDI unit, is thought to be beneficial for electron transport under ambient conditions. The report of the outstanding high OFET electron mobilities of P(NDI-T2) of close to ∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air has been a major improvement towards printed electronics, which rely on both p- and n-channel field-effect transistors (Fig. 4).23,75 Moreover, OFET characteristics of P(NDI-T2) profit from efficient charge injection from gold electrodes.76

A more detailed study on the electron transport behaviour of P(NDI-T2) under ambient conditions has been devised by Di Pietro et al. They were able to disentangle the effects of water and oxygen, and found that both species degrade transistor performance.77 An extraordinarily high electron mobility of P(NDI-T2) could also be measured in bulk devices.76,78 Steyrleuthner et al. used by time of flight and space charge limited current measurements, and found electron mobilities of up to ∼5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.78 Given the usual difference of OFET- and diode-based mobilities of several orders of magnitude, and the fact that such high values of polymeric acceptor materials had not been measured in bulk devices, the outstanding charge transport properties of P(NDI-T2) were confirmed by additional methods.
In search of electronic reasons for these high mobilities, Caironi et al. used temperature-dependent electrical measurements and charge modulation spectroscopy to probe the physical properties of charge carriers in P(NDI-T2). They suggested an unusually low degree of energetic disorder, and that the activation energy of mobility reflects the reorganization energy.79 While several examples of NDI copolymers with varying comonomer yield mobilities close or slightly larger than 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1,26–28,38 values higher than ∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 23 and 75) have thus far not been measured with NDI main chain copolymers. Only in a single report this value could be outreached. Kim et al. synthesized PNDI-TVT, which is a NDI main chain copolymer with a thienylene-vinylene-thienylene comonomer, and measured OFET electron mobilities of ∼1.8 cm2 V−1 s−1.45
The high electron mobilities and small band gap of naphthalene diimide copolymers are ideal prerequisites for their use in all-polymer photovoltaic devices with donor polymers. Organic photovoltaics (OPV) that incorporate two polymeric materials instead of conjugated-fullerene blends combine the advantages of tailored energy levels and absorption, as both active materials allow for versatile derivatisation.80,81 Moore et al. investigated blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with P(NDI-T2) in bulk heterojunction devices. The disappointing performance with η = 0.2% power conversion efficiency found was explained in terms of poor morphological control and macrophase separation.82 Significant improvement was achieved by Schubert et al., who investigated a series of different solvents for polymer blend preparation (Fig. 5).

The use of solvents that inhibited pre-aggregation of the NDI copolymer in solution allowed for the preparation of bulk heterojunctions with finely intermixed components. As a result, good photovoltaic performances with η = 1.4% and excellent fill factors up to 70% were demonstrated in OPV devices with P3HT as a donor polymer (Fig. 5).83 All-polymer blends of the selenophene analog to P(NDI-T2), P(NDI-S2) 13, gave η = 0.9% with P3HT as a hole conductor.84
Energy level alignment of the donor and acceptor polymers in all-polymer blend OPV is important for optimizing the optical band gap and the open circuit voltage VOC of the device. If only the donor comonomer is varied while keeping the NDI unit constant, the band gap can be controlled via an alteration of the HOMO energy level to adapt absorption to the solar spectrum. Fused thiophene and carbazole comonomers were synthesized and copolymerized with NDIBr2 by Yuan et al. and Hu et al., respectively. All-polymer blend devices of the NDI main chain copolymer with P3HT as a donor material gave η = 0.13 and 0.68%, respectively.39,48 The low-lying LUMO level of NDI copolymers of ∼4.0 eV and the relatively high-lying HOMO level of P3HT of ∼4.9 eV limit the VOC to ∼0.6 V that can be obtained. Two approaches are obvious to maximise the VOC and thus power conversion efficiency. As in NDI copolymers, the LUMO energy level is mainly determined by the NDI unit, an alteration can only be achieved by a complete change of the NDI structure.24,26 Chen et al. have devised an interesting paper with a new NDI building block of an angular structure and its copolymerization with thiophene monomers (Scheme 1b).24 The angular shape of the new NDI unit results in a smaller electronic coupling between the thiophene comonomers and NDI, slightly higher LUMO levels, and enlarged VOCs up to 0.94 V.24 Alternatively, if the standard NDI copolymer structure shown in Scheme 1a is to be used as an acceptor material in all-polymer OPV devices, the VOC can be enlarged by using different donor polymers with low-lying HOMO levels. Zhou et al. compared the performance of an NDI-fluorene copolymer PF-NDI in combination with P3HT or a branched polythiophene (P1) as donor polymers. Interestingly, PF-NDI exhibited a LUMO energy level of −3.61 eV, which is about 0.4 eV higher than that of P(NDI-T2). While the combination PF-NDI/P3HT gave therefore an already relatively large VOC of up to 0.7 V, the use of PF-NDI/P1 (HOMO P1: 5.1 eV) enabled a VOC of up to 0.88 V. Devices made from PF-NDI/P3HT could finally be optimized to η = 1.66%.36
In all-polymer bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells, the morphology is one of the most critical parameters. Blend domain sizes are usually optimized empirically by testing different processing conditions that are related to device performance. In block copolymers, phase separation is restricted to the size of the chain length of the individual blocks. Block copolymers with electronically active chains may exhibit structures that are comparable to the size of the small exciton diffusion length of organic materials of 5–10 nm.63,85–87 The matching sizes of block copolymer microstructures and small exciton diffusion lengths have also been the motivation to prepare triblock copolymer and graft copolymer architectures of NDI copolymers and P3HT. Wang et al. have devised synthetic protocols towards triblock copolymers of type P3HT-PNDI-P3HT and graft copolymers with PNDI backbones and P3HT grafts.88,89 These materials have shown the initial signs of phase separation on the nanoscale88 and hence will be intriguing materials for the investigation of intra-chain charge separation across conjugated blocks.90
5. Conclusions and outlook
NDI main chain copolymers are an exciting new class of conjugated polymers with electron-accepting properties that is extensively pursued in materials science. A variety of step-growth polymerisation methods have been used to prepare alternating copolymers, including Stille, Suzuki, Sonogashira and direct arylation polycondensation. Stille polycondensation is still the method of choice for most of the structures made, however experimental protocols of attractive non-toxic alternatives such as Suzuki or direct arylation methods are continuously being improved. It is desirable that these will become more important in the near future. Moreover, the controlled polymerisation of radical anions has recently been discovered using NDI-based monomers.
With the report on the outstanding and high electron mobilities under ambient conditions of the most prominent example P(NDI-T2), this class of materials has most strongly influenced the fields of charge transport and printed transistors. While n-channel behaviour is predominantly observed, some of the materials also show interesting ambipolar behaviour and considerable p-channel performance. The performance of all-conjugated polymer blend heterojunction photovoltaic devices comprising NDI main chain copolymers as electron acceptors is promising albeit below that of the best performing all-polymer blend systems. Further research is necessary to fully evaluate the potential of NDI copolymers for use in organic photovoltaics. During processing and proof reading of this manuscript, two exciting papers appeared on the use of NDI copolymers as electron accepting materials in all-polymer blends for organic photovoltaics.91,92 Outstanding power conversion efficiencies of 3.3 and 3.6% were reported, which demonstrate the high potential of this class of materials also for all-polymeric photovoltaic cells.
Structure formation of NDI copolymers entails the ordering processes of regioregular conjugated polymers with backbones of alternating aromatic units. Recent results have demonstrated that backbone planarity, backbone orientation and polymorphism play important roles. The rigorous use of important experimental methods that allow the discrimination of subtle morphological changes will shed more light on this challenging but important field.
With the many NDI copolymer derivatives reported so far, it is now the time to take one step back to determine consistent structure–function relationships from optimized materials with controlled and comparable molecular weight, dispersity, and end groups. Meaningful conclusions of comparative studies can only be drawn if device characteristics can be related to the variation of a single parameter, and interesting findings might be overlooked if multiple parameters are varied at the same time. By providing a comprehensive viewpoint of all important aspects of the interdisciplinary field of naphthalene diimide copolymers for organic electronics, this review is intended to further stimulate the field.

Table Content:
Michael Sommer	Michael Sommer finished his PhD thesis in 2009 on semiconducting block copolymers for organic electronic devices under the supervision of Mukundan Thelakkat at the University of Bayreuth, Germany. In 2010 he joined the group of Wilhelm Huck at the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, UK, as a post-doctoral researcher. Since the beginning of 2012 he has been building up an independent research group at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Germany. His research interests encompass the synthesis of conjugated materials, controlled polymerisation methods, self-assembly and structure–function relationships of electronically active materials.

 	Scheme 1  Chemical structures of the main chain conjugated copolymers based on NDI and comonomers X. (a) Main chain conjugated copolymers with NDI units incorporated via 2 and 6 positions. (b) Angular-shaped NDI copolymers and (c) main chain copolymers with core-extended NDI units.	 

 	Scheme 2  General synthesis scheme for alternating, main chain conjugated NDI copolymers using (a) Stille coupling, (b) Suzuki coupling and (c) Sonogashira coupling with NDIBr2 as a comonomer. R denotes an alkyl substituent that is usually branched to impart sufficient solubility.

 	Scheme 3  Overview of conjugated copolymers of alternating naphthalene diimides and other aromatic comonomers in the main chain.	 

 	Scheme 4  The Kumada catalyst transfer polycondensation of monomer precursor a with tBuMgCl is not possible as the active monomer b does not form. The addition of Rieke zinc to a leads to radical anion c, which can be polymerized to d having controlled molecular weight, end groups and narrow dispersity. Insertion of Zn into the thiophene-bromine bond to give e does not occur, as quenching of c with water yields precursor a.
