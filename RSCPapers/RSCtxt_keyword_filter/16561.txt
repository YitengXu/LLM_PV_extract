    , Accepted 29th August 2019First published on 3rd September 2019AbstractHerein, we demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) CdSeS quantum dot monolayers (QDM) can strongly influence efficient charge transport and charge separation, improving the performance of inverted polymer solar cells (iPSCs). Also, for the first time we report the electronic band structure of CdSeS and CdSeS@ZnS QDs and an effective approach to apply the 2D QDM as an effective electron transport layer in iPSCs from work function studies. The iPSCs with the 2D CdSeS QDM showed maximum power conversion efficiencies of 8.83%, which were 26% higher than the reference. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were performed to confirm the charge separation and electron transport behavior in the iPSCs with 2D QDMs. The PL decay time of the iPSCs with the CdSeS QDM at 720 nm was ∼60 ps, which is much faster than that of the iPSCs without the 2D QDM. The enhanced photovoltaic performance of the iPSCs with the 2D CdSeS QDM can be attributed to the effective charge separation and electron transport performance due to the high built-in voltage and fast exciton decay time from the 2D QDM.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor quantum dot monolayers (QDMs) have been extensively studied for electronic and optoelectronic device applications. QDs, among the types of semi-conductive nanoparticles, are promising interlayers with large nonlinear susceptibilities, fast response times, and good photoconduction.1–5 Recently, CdSeS QDs, which are a typical trivalent II–VI QD material, have attracted attention as a strong candidate for broad application possibilities in next-generation optoelectronic devices6–9 due to their outstanding properties such as a high quantum yield, narrow emission, and easy color and size tunability.10–15 The charge carrier transport properties of QDs play an essential role in the device performance. Recently, interfacial engineering of the solar cell device structure has been intensively investigated since electron–hole separation is highly correlated with the charge carrier transfer processes in the device. The interface design and engineering of inverted polymer solar cells (iPSCs), which are one of the most promising alternative energy sources due to improved device stability over conventional PSCs,16–18 have been studied to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for efficient transportation of electrons from an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.19 Many groups have demonstrated the use of metal oxides,20–22 graphene derivatives,23–27 and organic molecules/polymers28,29 as an electron transport layer (ETL) in iPSC devices. Non-conjugated viscous polymers such as poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) and ethoxylated poly(ethyleneimine) (PEIE) were also introduced for iPSC devices as an ETL to decrease the work function (WF) of the ITO by the formation of a dipole layer and band bending effects at the ITO/PEI (PEIE) interfaces.30–32 These polymer ETLs played an important role in electron transport through a low WF in iPSCs. Our group also has reported that the performance of iPSC devices based on a ITO/PEIE/CdSe QD layer structure was enhanced by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of the CdSe QDs.33 Unfortunately, the electronic band structures of CdSeS QDs such as the conduction band, valence band, and bandgap have not been previously reported. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no one has reported the differences in the photovoltaic performance and charge carrier transport mechanisms of 2D CdSeS core and core–shell type QDMs for iPSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM polymeric heterostructures.
In this work, for the first time we report a novel approach to obtain iPSCs with a high PCE by inserting 2D CdSeS and CdSeS@ZnS QDMs as an effective ETL between a PEIE polymer surface modifier and a PTB7:PC71BM active layer. Charge transport studies for the optimization of the solar cell structures were performed on ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM and ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM structures by work function (WF) measurements. Also, the energy band levels of CdSeS QDs, which have not been reported previously, were investigated using UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) equipment. Therefore, the photovoltaic behaviors of the fabricated iPSCs with/without the 2D QDM were confirmed using finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) modeling, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. According to previous reports, QD multi-layer structures can act an electron barrier to electronic devices due to an increase in the charge transport distance and contact resistance.32,33 Hence, we used only the QDM structure as an ETL for the iPSC devices to study the influence of CdSeS and CdSeS@ZnS on the performance of the iPSC devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
PTB7 (MW = 50–70 kDa, RR = 91–94%, Rieke Metals), PC71BM (purity >99%, Nano-C), PEIE (MW = 110 kDa, 37 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich), and QDs (CdSeS and CdSeS@ZnS stabilized with trioctylphosphine and oleic acid, Invisible Co. Ltd) were used in this study. Toluene was used for the preparation of aqueous solutions of QDs.
2.2. Fabrication of iPSCs with a 2D quantum dot monolayer (QDM)
A clean ITO glass substrate (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) was treated with O2 plasma for 40 s. Subsequently, a 6 nm-thick PEIE layer was spin-coated, followed by soft baking at 110 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. After cooling, the QDs dispersed in toluene were spin-coated onto the PEIE layer, followed by thermal annealing at 110 °C for 25 min. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. A PTB7:PC71BM blend (1:1.5 weight ratio) active layer with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited onto the PEIE/QDM via the spin coating method. Finally, MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (80 nm) were sequentially deposited on the active layer by thermal evaporation, resulting in an active area of 0.0464 cm2.
2.3. Characterization of the iPSC structures
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to observe the surface morphology of the 2D QDM on the PEIE/ITO substrate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20), at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, was carried out to investigate the cross-sectional structure of the iPSCs using focused ion beam (FIB, Helios NanoLab650) milling techniques. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using a Xe lamp as the excitation source at room temperature. UPS measurements were performed with a He I (21.2 eV) discharge lamp. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the QDs and PTB7:PC71BM films with/without the 2D QDM were measured using a UV-2600 UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been applied to determine the energy levels of the QDs at room temperature with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. CdSeS QDs dispersed in toluene were dropped on a fluorine-doped tin oxide/glass electrode to serve as the working electrode. The counter and the reference electrodes were platinum wire and Ag/AgNO3 (in 0.01 M MeCN), respectively. The electrolyte was a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (TBAPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile. The PL lifetimes were carefully measured by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and a repetition rate of 80 MHz.
2.4. Photovoltaic performance of iPSCs with/without the 2D QDM
The solar cell devices were tested in the air under AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel 1 kW solar simulator) that had been calibrated with the International System of Units (SI) (SRC-1000-TC-KG5-N, VLSI Standards, Inc.) for accurate measurement. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using an Oriel IQE-200 (Newport), a calibrated Si UV detector and an SR8570 low noise current amplifier.
2.5. Optical absorption simulation of iPSCs
The numerical simulations were performed using finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) using Lumerical software. In the FDTD simulations, a perfectly matched layer boundary condition was used on the top and bottom of the simulation domain. A periodic boundary condition was used on the left side of the domain. A broadband plane wave source (400–800 nm) was normally incident on the solar cells. The light absorption was calculated using Pabs = 0.5ε0ε′ω|E|2, where ε0 and ε′ are the permittivity of free space and the imaginary part for each layer, respectively, and ω is the free space frequency and E is the electric field. The solar cell structure used for the simulation is comprised of ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. The optical constants of Ag, MoO3, and CdSeS QDs are taken from the literature and the others are obtained using an ellipsometer.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the structural and optical characteristics of the 2D CdSeS QDM. The PEIE layer was pre-deposited onto the ITO surface to form a uniform 2D CdSeS QDM. In this work, we used commercial CdSeS QDs (Invisible Co. Ltd), which were stabilized with trioctylphosphine and oleic acid. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of the ITO/PEIE substrate shows the presence of positively charged protonated –NH (or –NR) groups at ∼1672 and ∼3272 cm−1 as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).34–36 The uniform 2D CdSeS QDM can be attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction between the positively charged protonated –NH (or –NR) groups of the PEIE and the negatively charged deprotonated –COOH and –P groups of the CdSeS QD surface. Fig. 1a shows the schematic illustration of the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM structure. The cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Fig. 1b prepared from a focused-ion beam (FIB) milling technique clearly shows that the CdSeS QDs with an average diameter of ∼5 nm were densely packed with each other with the formation of a 2D monolayer on the PEIE layer. Also, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 1c shows that the 2D CdSeS QDM uniformly covered the PEIE layer. Also, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1c and Fig. S2 (ESI†) show that the 2D CdSeS QDM uniformly covered, with an average QD density of 1.61 × 1012 cm−2, the PEIE layer. A photoluminescence (PL) measurement was conducted to investigate the optical properties of the 2D CdSeS QDM. The PL spectrum of the 2D CdSeS QDM in Fig. 1d was recorded using a Raman imaging and scanning electron microscope system using a laser with a wavelength of 532 nm at the same position as the SEM image in Fig. 1c. The PL spectra of the 2D CdSeS QDM showed the appearance of a characteristic peak at a wavelength of 615 nm without any noise peaks as shown in Fig. 1d. The PL spectrum of the 2D CdSeS QDM was slightly red-shifted from 600 nm to 615 nm compared to that of CdSeS QDs dispersed in toluene. This phenomenon is caused by changes in electronic energy transfer and polarization due to dipole–dipole interactions between adjacent QDs in a close-packed QD structure.37–39 This result implies that the QDs are densely packed with each other as a monolayer, which is in good agreement with the cross-sectional TEM and SEM images.

(f) Plausible energy level diagram changes triggered by the shifted conduction band energy of the ITO electrode under open circuit conditions from each data of the work function (WF) by UPS measurement. 
To confirm the change in the energy level by introducing the 2D QDM, the energy level structures of the ITO, ITO/PEIE, ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM and ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM were estimated using UPS (Fig. 1e and f). The work function (WF) of the bare ITO was calculated as 4.3 eV from the secondary electron cut off in Fig. 1e. After a thin PEIE layer was coated on ITO, the WF decreased down to 3.9 eV. Besides, the WFs of the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM and the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM were calculated to be 3.6 eV and 4.2 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1f. Therefore, the optimized WF level for the electron transport can be inferred from the energy band diagram in the solar cell device structures since the WF of the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM (3.6 eV) is favorable with the WF of ITO/PEIE (3.9 eV) for electron transport compared to that of the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM (4.2 eV). Consequently, it was found that the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM structure has an optimized WF for application in iPSC devices.
In order to further examine the energy band diagram of the solar cell structure in this study, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of CdSeS QDs. However, the HOMO and LUMO level information of CdSeS QDs has not been reported previously. Here, we show those levels of CdSeS QDs revealed via optical and electrochemical analytical methods. UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were conducted to clarify exactly the energy levels of the CdSeS QDs (Fig. 2a–c). As shown in Fig. 2a, the CdSeS QDs dispersed in toluene show absorption peaks at around 585 nm. The energy band gap (Eg) of the CdSeS QDs was derived through the UV-vis spectrum as estimated from the energy intercept of the extrapolation of the linear portion of the curve to 2.03 eV of Eg (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2c, the HOMO level and LUMO level of the CdSeS QDs were obtained from a CV measurement at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated from the oxidation initiation potential (Eox′) and the reduction initiation potential (Ered′). The HOMO level of the CdSeS QDs was calculated to be 5.6 eV from the following equation:40EHOMO = −IP = −(Eox′ + 4.14) (eV),where IP is the ionization potential. The LUMO level of the CdSeS QDs was calculated as ≈3.5 eV by the following equation:40ELUMO = −E.A. = −(Ered′ + 4.14) (eV),where E.A. is the electron affinity. These results reveal that even though the CdSeS QDs form a two-dimensional monolayer structure, the 2D QDM exhibits its own unique optical properties of the QDs. From the above studies, we found that the CdSeS core QDM is more suitable than the CdSeS@ZnS core@shell QDM as an ETL in iPSCs. Thus, the CdSeS QDM was introduced as a charge transport layer in an iPSC device as follows.

To evaluate the roles of the 2D CdSeS QDM as an ETL for iPSC devices, we fabricated iPSCs with a configuration of ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM/poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithio-phene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbo-nyl]thieno[3,4-b]thio-phenediyl]] (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methylester (PC71BM)/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 3a). The multilayered structure of the iPSC device was examined using a TEM with a site-specific specimen obtained from a FIB milling technique. The cross-sectional TEM images taken from the cross-section of the iPSC with the 2D CdSeS QDM show well-defined individual layers (ITO, PEIE, CdSeS QDM, and PTB7:PC71BM) as shown in Fig. 3a. An iPSC with a 2D CdSeS@ZnS core@shell QDM was also fabricated by the same fabrication procedure for comparison of the photovoltaic performance and charge carrier transport effects. In addition, the cross-sectional TEM image of the iPSC with the 2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM shows well-defined individual layers and a densely packed two-dimensional arrangement of QDs on the PEIE layer as shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†). Also, Fig. S3b (ESI†) shows the PL spectrum of the 2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM with a peak wavelength of 633 nm without any noise peaks.

Fig. 3b and Fig. S4 (ESI†) show the energy level diagrams of the iPSCs with the 2D CdSeS and the 2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM, respectively, which are estimated from the UV-vis spectroscopy and CV measurements of the CdSeS QDs. The WF of the ITO/PEIE structure was calculated to be 3.9 eV by UPS as shown in Fig. 1d and f. The electron flow depends on the position of the LUMO (conduction band) of each layer in the iPSC. The PTB7 in the active layer has a higher conduction band edge of 3.3 eV compared to that of the CdSeS QDs (3.5 eV). Hence, it is easy for the photo-excited electrons of the PTB7 to move toward the conduction band of the CdSeS QDM and then directly transport to the ITO electrode. Furthermore, the photo-excited electrons of PTB7 can be moved to the conduction band edge of PC71BM (3.9 eV) and then transferred to the ITO electrode through the CdSeS QDM due to the effective charge transport nature of the CdSeS QDM. In contrast, the energy level of the conduction band of the ZnS (3.0 eV) in CdSeS@ZnS QDs, which is 0.3 eV and 0.5 eV higher than those of the PTB7 and CdSeS core, can hinder the transport of the photo-excited electrons in the active layer.41

Fig. 3c and Fig. S5a (ESI†) show the J–V characteristics of the iPSCs with/without the 2D QDM. The photovoltaic performances are listed in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†). The performance of the iPSC with the 2D CdSeS QDM exhibited the best PCE of 8.79% with a current density (JSC) of 17.10 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.75 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.56. The iPSC with the 2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM showed a high PCE of 8.21% with a JSC of 15.46 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.74 V and a FF of 71.40. Consequently, the introduction of the 2D CdSeS QDM and CdSeS@ZnS QDM between PEIE and PTB7:PC71BM resulted in a 25.78% and 17.52% enhancement in the maximum PCE, respectively, compared to that of the iPSC without the 2D QDM. To confirm the enhanced photovoltaic performance of the iPSCs, we measured also the external quantum efficiency (EQE). Fig. 3d shows that the EQE of the iPSCs with the 2D CdSeS QDM was higher than that of the iPSCs without the 2D QDM. This is because the absorbed photons lead to a separated pair of charge carriers and most of the photo-generated carriers are collected at the electrodes without recombination effects.32,33 The EQE of the iPSCs with the 2D CdSeS@ZnS is slightly lower than that of the iPSCs with the 2D CdSeS as shown in Fig. S5b (ESI†), which can be attributed to the fact that the bandgap of the ZnS shell is bigger than that of the CdSeS core, thus impeding the charge transport. These results indicate that the 2D CdSeS QDM is more helpful for the transport of photo-excited electrons from the active layer to the ITO electrode.

The performance of inverted PSC devices fabricated with the 2D CdSeS QDM can be enhanced by a SPR effect of the QDs.6–9,33 UV/vis spectroscopy was performed to measure the absorption spectra of the materials used in this study to confirm the SPR effects of the 2D CdSeS QDM for improvement of the iPSC performance (Fig. 4a and Fig. S6, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), a relatively strong absorption peak and a shoulder absorption peak were observed in the PTB7 film at 680 nm and 620 nm, respectively. In the PC71BM film, there is a broad absorption spectrum including two obvious absorption peaks at 375 and 480 nm. The absorption spectral overlap between PTB7 and PC71BM results in an extended absorption range of their blended film. Fig. 4a shows the UV/vis absorption spectra of the ITO/PEIE/PTB7:PC71BM structures with and without the 2D CdSeS QDM. An implication from these results is that there was no change in the light absorption despite the introduction of the 2D CdSeS QDM between the PEIE and the PTB7:PC71BM layer. To theoretically verify these phenomena, the electromagnetic field distribution was calculated by the 2D finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method (Fig. 4b and c). The calculation was conducted using the conventional transfer matrix method.42,43 The iPSC structure used for the FDTD simulation consisted of glass (1.1 mm)/PEIE (3 nm)/CdSeS QD (5 nm)/PTB7:PC71BM (120 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (80 nm) (Fig. S7, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4b, the simulated absorption spectrum of the ITO/PEIE/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag structure was almost identical to that of the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag structure. The simulated electromagnetic field distribution shows that there was no difference in electromagnetic field intensity between the ITO/PEIE/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag and ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag structures (Fig. 4c). The simulation results are well matched with the results of UV/vis spectroscopy experimentally measured in Fig. 4a. These results revealed that the SPR effect of the 2D QDM is insufficient to increase the performance of our iPSC devices in this work.

(b) The simulated absorption spectra and (c) the simulated electric field profiles of the PTB7:PC71BM blended films with/without the 2D CdSeS QDM. The simulated electric field profiles were obtained at a wavelength of 600 nm. 
PL quenching and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were conducted to understand the charge transport behavior between the 2D CdSeS QDM and the PTB7:PC71BM, which is closely associated with the improved performance of the iPSC. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PL intensity of the PTB7:PC71BM with the 2D CdSeS QDM decreased by 10.3% compared to that of the bare PTB7:PC71BM. This result suggests that the absorbed photon energies of PTB7:PC71BM are more effectively quenched by the 2D CdSeS QDM. TCSPS measurements were performed with excitation by a 400 nm laser source (Fig. 5b and Table 2). The PL decay curves were fitted with a single function to calculate the lifetime. The calculated τ at 720 nm of the PTB7:PC71BM with and without the 2D CdSeS QDM was ∼60 and ∼100 ps, respectively (Table 2). This result indicates that the exciton decay time of the PTB7:PC71BM with the 2D CdSeS QDM at the selected wavelength of 720 nm was much faster than that of PTB7:PC71BM without the 2D QDM. The reduced PL decay time of the PTB7:PC71BM with CdSeS QDs is mainly due to the efficient charge transport from the energy level alignment. Additionally, we suggested that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the PTB7:PC71BM film to the CdSeS QDs could lead to a reduced PL decay time, resulting in an extended absorption area of the solar cell. The FRET process can occur when at least three basic requirements are fulfilled: (i) spectral overlap between the absorption of an acceptor and emission of a donor, (ii) dipole–dipole interactions between an acceptor and a donor, and (iii) distance within 10 nm from an acceptor to a donor.44,45 Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the spectral overlap between the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the CdSeS QDs (blue line) and the PL emission spectrum of the PTB7:PC71BM film (black line) in the wavelength range of 510–610 nm. As shown in the TEM images of Fig. 1b, CdSeS QDs with a diameter of ∼5 nm were uniformly deposited as a monolayer on the PEIE layer followed by PTB7:PC71BM. It clearly shows that the distance between an acceptor (2D CdSeS QDM) and a donor (PTB7:PC71BM) is less than 10 nm as depicted in the inset of Fig. 1b. Therefore, there is a possibility that the FRET process occurs in the 2D CdSeS QDM/PTB7:PC71BM structure. The FRET efficiency (η) of the 2D CdSeS QDM/PTB7:PC71BM structure was obtained using the following equation:45η = 1 − (τDA/τD),where τDA and τD are the fluorescence lifetimes of a donor (PTB7:PC71BM) with and without an acceptor (2D CdSeS QDM), respectively. As shown in Table 2, the FRET efficiency of the PTB7:PC71BM with the 2D CdSeS QDM was obtained as 67% at 720 nm. The FRET process may affect the absorption efficiency of the device but does not significantly contribute to the enhanced PCE. This can be explained by the fact that there was no significant change in light absorption between the structure with and without the CdSeS QDM as shown in Fig. 4a and b. Consequently, the efficient charge transport by the CdSeS QDM in the device is the predominant reason for the enhanced PCE.

The performance enhancement of the iPSC can be also attributed to a change in the energy level structure due to the introduction of the QD monolayer. The WFs of the ITO, ITO/PEIE, ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM and ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM structures were obtained as 4.3, 3.9, 3.6 and 4.2 eV as shown in Fig. 1d and e. Interestingly, the WF of the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM decreased down to 3.6 eV compared with the ITO and ITO/PEIE. The reduced WF may result in an increased built-in voltage, which can contribute larger band bending at the surface of the active layer under short circuit conditions.32 Thus, the electrons can be effectively transported to the ITO electrode, resulting in an enhanced VOC (from 0.68 V to 0.75 V) and JSC (from 14.99 mA cm−2 to 17.10 mA cm−2). On the other hand, the WF of the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM structure was 4.2 eV due to the ZnS shell, which was higher than the WF of the ITO/PEIE structure. However, the performance of the iPSC with the 2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM was enhanced compared to that of the iPSC without the 2D QDM. Though the energy level of the ZnS shell interferes with the charge transport in the iPSC with the 2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM, the performance can be improved since an electron tunneling phenomenon may occur in a ZnS shell with a thickness of less than ∼1 nm.46–48 These results also agree with the PL quenching and TCSPC measurements. Consequently, the 2D CdSeS QDM act as a high efficiency relaxation channel and efficient ETL in the iPSCs due to the high built-in voltage, which can contribute larger band bending.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we firstly and systematically studied an application of a 2D CdSeS QDM as an excellent ETL for the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance in iPSCs. The 2D CdSeS QDM was characterized by analyses of the optical, structural and electrical properties using various techniques and measurements. The PTB7:PC71BM based iPSCs with the 2D CdSeS QDM and the 2D CdSeS@ZnS QDM exhibited maximum PCEs of 8.83% and 8.25%, which were 26% and 18% higher than the iPSC without the 2D QDM, respectively. The WF of the ITO/PEIE/2D CdSeS QDM structure was shifted by 3.6 eV, which is lower than the ITO/PEIE structure from UPS measurements. The PL decay time of the PTB7:PC71BM with the 2D CdSeS QDM at 720 nm was ∼60 ps, which is much faster than that of PTB7:PC71BM without the 2D QDM. As a consequence, the enhanced photovoltaic performance of the iPSC with the 2D QDM can be attributed to efficient charge separation and electron transport due to the high built-in voltage and fast exciton decay time from the 2D QDM. The present study suggests that the 2D CdSeS QDM can be applied in various photovoltaic applications for improved photovoltaic performance in the near future.
