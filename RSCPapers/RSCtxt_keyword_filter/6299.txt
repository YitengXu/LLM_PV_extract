However, the understanding of the associated microscopic processes still remains limited. Here, we present a theoretical investigation of the effects of different conjugation defects on the dynamics of exciton transport in two linearly coupled poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) molecules. The model system is constructed by employing an extended version of the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model and the exciton behaviors are simulated by means of a quantum nonadiabatic dynamics. We identify two types of conjugation defects, i.e., weakening conjugation and strengthening conjugation, which are demonstrated to play different roles in impacting the dynamics of exciton transport in the system. The weakening conjugation acts as an energy well inclined to trap a moving exciton, while the strengthening conjugation acts as an energy barrier inclined to block the exciton. We also systematically simulate both intrachain and interchain dynamics of exciton transport, and find that an exciton could experience a “short-time delaying”, “trapping”, “blocking”, or “hopping” process, which is determined by the defect type, strength, and position. These findings provide a microscopic understanding of how the exciton transport dynamics can be impacted by conjugation defects in an actual polymer system.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on π-conjugated polymers have attracted much interest due to their low production cost, flexibility, and chemically tunable optical properties.1,2 Since the first fabrication of two-layer OSCs by Tang in 1986,3 many efforts have been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiency of OSCs, which has been over 10% recently.4–7 However, when compared with other photovoltaic devices, such as the rapidly developing perovskite solar cells8–15 and the conventional silicon-based solar cells, the OSCs have a much lower power conversion efficiency and their performance is still far from satisfaction. The major reason for this situation is that the exciton binding energy in polymers is much larger than that in perovskite or silicon-based systems, such that light absorption can only produce strongly bound excitons that must transport to the electronic donor/acceptor (D/A) interface to dissociate into free charges.16–19 Moreover, as the photogenerated exciton is energetically instable, different radiative or non-radiative decay processes result in a very short exciton lifetime20–23 (typically on the order of 100 ps–1 ns), and thus greatly restrict the exciton transport (e.g., in most of the polymers, the exciton transport length is limited to be less than 10 nm16,24–28). As such, in actual photovoltaic polymers, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures are widely employed in order to harvest more excitons at D/A interfaces with the domain size of the donor polymer smaller than the exciton transport length. However, in the process of device preparation, it is usually difficult to control the domain size that can match the extremely limited exciton transport length as well as to achieve the desired morphology. On the other hand, polymers also serve as the charge transport layer after the photogenerated excitons are dissociated at D/A interfaces. In this regard, polymer domains with too small size are detrimental to efficient charge collection because of severe charge recombination.29–32 Therefore, to design more efficient OSCs, it is crucially important to improve the exciton transport length as much as possible, which requires a precise understanding of the exciton transport process in polymers.
In general, the orientational disorder and energetic inhomogeneity intrinsically present in polymers represent two key factors governing the dynamics of exciton transport. Due to the flexibility and the strong electron–lattice interaction in polymers, the electronic structures of the system can be impacted by both the structure of a single polymer chain and the packing configuration between chains. This will lead to the redistribution of the photogenerated excitons in these systems, i.e., the exciton transport. Exciton transport in polymers includes interchain hopping as well as intrachain migration. For the exciton interchain hopping, it usually takes place on the basis of either the Förster or the Dexter mechanism. While the two mechanisms are different in nature, the final results in both cases are actually similar, i.e., the exciton is transferred from a high-energy position to a low-energy one, and the exciton transport length was limited to the nanometer scale.28,33 In recent years, the exciton transport along a single polymer chain, i.e., the exciton intrachain migration, has been attracting increasing research interest.34,35 A generally accepted conclusion is that excitons are more inclined to migrate along single chains when they are intrachain localized, which is promoted by regions of structural disorders in polymer films.34,36 In other words, intrachain exciton transport may play an important role in less-ordered domains of the polymer films. In particular, the exciton intrachain migration was found to have a coherent transport character.37,38 However, it was also found that such an exciton transport behavior only works well during the initial stage after light absorption (∼100 fs) or before thermalization of the excited state in a well extended polymer chain.37,38 As such, some recent research studies have classified the exciton transport in polymers into two different processes: a fast process occurring before thermalization of the excited state (which is also regarded as the most critical factor contributing to exciton transport), and a slow process following the thermalization.39
Recently, we theoretically studied the exciton intrachain transport in polymers, and proposed two kinds of nonuniform-field driving mechanisms including the interchain packing configuration field36 and local electric field.40 It was found that the distance of exciton transport driven by either of the two kinds of nonuniform fields can be in the order of micrometers, which far exceeds most of the values obtained from experimental measurements.25,33,34,41 However, in the simulations, we chose ideal polymer chains as a model system and thus neglected the effect of conjugation defects on the exciton transport dynamics. As we know, in polymers, the continuous or extended π-interactions (i.e., π-conjugation) along polymer chains form perfect channels for the transport of excitons as well as charge carriers.42–45 However, different from the idealized conjugation structures, different kinds of defects, such as the chemical defects, conformation distortion, charge doping, side group suspension, and photo-isomerization effect, will be inevitably present in actual polymers.46,47 These random defects can divide an extended conjugated chain into several segments, instead of a completely extended chain,16,48 and we thus refer to them as the conjugation defects.
Up to now, the detrimental effect of conjugation defects on the exciton transport has been recognized but still lacks a complete and comprehensive description. Experimentally, the relationship between the material morphology and device performance can be obtained on a microscope, which is determined by the dependence of the exciton transport distance on the defect concentration and species. But the precise process when excitons meet defects on the nanometer scale is difficult to capture due to technical limitations. Additionally, most of the theoretical works on the effect of defects on the exciton transport distance adopted the Monte Carlo method combined with the phenomenological theory or quantum chemical calculations. For example, Athanasopoulos and coworkers have made the exciton transport length agreement with the experimental data by introducing the defect concentration in their Monte Carlo model.49 Subsequently, they investigated the exciton transport in energetically disordered polymers50 and presented a universal scaling law of the transport length with the dimensionless disorder parameter. Barford and Tozer described a theory of Förster-type exciton transport between the polymers and then provided a quantitative link between the polymer conformation and exciton transport by studying the effect of conformational disorders on the exciton transport.51 In addition, by a model Hamiltonian combined with an Ehrenfest dynamics, Aragó and Troisi explored the role of the thermal nuclear motion (dynamic disorder) in the exciton transport properties in organic molecular crystals.52 They found that when the excitonic coupling is large, the exciton transport becomes coherent and the thermal motions determine the exciton transport, which can be several orders of magnitude larger than that in the incoherent case. Despite these advances, how the exciton behaves when meeting intrinsic defects is still unclear. As a result, a detailed dynamics process on the nanometer scale and on the femtosecond scale is urgently desired. We present here the simulations of the intrachain and interchain exciton transport dynamics in two linearly coupled PPV chains by focusing on the nature and the role of different conjugation defects.
Theoretical method
We consider two coupled PPV molecules with a linear interchain packing configuration as the model system, in which different conjugation defects are included. To highlight the strong electron–lattice interactions in such a system, an extended version of the well-known Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model is employed.53 The Hamiltonian of the system can be written as (1)Hj (j = 1 or 2, indicating the chain index) describes an isolated PPV chain consisting of three parts, (2)The first term is the electronic part of a chain, which shows the electron hopping between the nearest neighboring sites. tj,n,n+1 is the electron transfer integral between sites n and n + 1 of the jth chain, and expressed as follows by considering the periodic structure of a PPV molecule, (3)Here , if ; and , if . “int” means an integer. t0 represents the nearest-neighbor transfer integral of a uniform bond structure, α the electron–lattice interaction constant, and uj,n the displacement of a unit at site n. t1 and t2 are the symmetry-breaking parameters introduced to reflect the lattice feature of a PPV monomer, such that the electron transfer integral tn,n+1 between the nearest neighbor sites of a PPV monomer can be separately written ast1,2 = t0 − α(u2 − u1) + t1t2,3 = t0 − α(u3 − u2) − t1 − t2t3,4 = t0 − α(u4 − u3) + t1t4,5 = t0 − α(u5 − u4) − t1t5,6 = t0 − α(u6 − u5) + t1 + t2t6,1 = t0 − α(u1 − u6) − t1
In fact, by such a treatment to the PPV monomer, its six-periodic single–double bond structure is well described (see Fig. 1A). C+j,n(Cj,n) stands for the creation (annihilation) operator for the electron on site n. The second and the last terms in eqn (2) separately describe the classical treatment of the elastic potential and kinetic energy of the sites. K denotes the elastic constant and M denotes the mass of a site.

(B) Schematic diagram of two linearly coupled PPV chains near a polymer–donor/C60–acceptor interface, where a conjugation defect is assumed to be located at the acetylene double bonds m = 6n + 5 along a PPV chain. The localized red areas stand for the distribution of an exciton in different interchain coupling regions. 

H
inter in eqn (1) shows the interchain coupling, which is written as (4)t⊥ represents the interchain transfer integral between chains, which is related to the distance d of the corresponding sites n. Here, t⊥ is chosen as the following form,54 (5)For the two coupled PPV chains with a linear interchain packing configuration, as shown in Fig. 1B, we choose the distribution of d(n) as a fixed form of d = 5 − 0.033n (in Å).
The final term Hdefect in eqn (1) represents the effect of conjugation defects along PPV chains. Considering that the benzene ring in the PPV monomer can retain planarity, the carbon bonds in the benzene rings are relatively more difficult to be affected than those in acetylene repeat units. For example, the rotation between the neighboring benzene rings and the folding of the chain can both impact the conjugation strength of the double bonds in the acetylene repeat units and result in conjugation defects at these positions. Thus, in the model system (see Fig. 1B), we assume that the conjugation defect is located at one acetylene double bond of the PPV chain (labeled as m = 6N − 1, N is the position index of the PPV monomer and m indicates the position of the acetylene double bond on the Nth PPV monomer), and its effect can be described as Hdefect = −Δtk,m,m+1(C+k,m+1Ck,m + C+k,mCk,m+1).(6)Here, Δtk,m,m+1 represents the variation of the electron transfer integral between sites m and m + 1 in the kth chain. A positive value of Δt means a strengthening conjugation for the corresponding acetylene double bond, while a negative value of Δt implies a weakening conjugation for that. Taking the rotation of the PPV rings as an example, in an extended PPV molecule, the neighboring benzene rings can rotate due to conformation distortion in actual devices,55 such that the conjugation degree may increase, which is expected to be strengthening defects; otherwise, the conjugation degree decreases and is regarded as weakening defects.
In the dynamics, the evolution of the lattice configuration (i.e. nuclear motion) is determined by the Newtonian equation of motion: Müj,n = −K(2uj,n − uj,n+1 − uj,n−1) + 2α(ρj,n,n+1 − ρj,n,n−1) − λMj,n,(7)where the density matrix ρj is defined as (8)fμ is a time-independent distribution function, which is set as 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial state occupation of the μth level, and n′ = n ± 1. In eqn (7), a damping term is introduced to describe the energy dissipation into the surrounding medium by a tuning parameter λ. Ψj,μ(n,t) is the electronic wave function, and Ψj,μ(n,t) = 〈n|Ψj,μ(t)〉 is the projection of the electronic state |Ψj,μ(t)〉 on the Wannier state of site n. Evolution of Ψj,μ(n,t) depends on the time-dependent Schrödinger equation: (9) It is important to note from eqn (7) and (9) that the nuclear motions and electronic states are coupled together all through the evolution. As a result, the nuclear motions can evolve on multiple potential energy surfaces in the dynamic processes, which guarantee the nonadiabatic nature of the quantum dynamics approach used in our simulations. Here, eqn (7) and (9) can be numerically solved by the Runge–Kutta method of order eight with step-size control, which has been proven to be an effective approach in the study of dynamics in conjugated polymers.56 The values of model parameters used in the simulations are chosen as t0 = 2.66 eV, α = 10.29 eV Å−1, t1 = 0.02 eV, t2 = −0.2 eV, K = 99.00 eV Å−2, and M = 1349.14 eV fs2 Å−2, and the damping term is set to be λ = 0.05 fs−1. Parameters t0, α, t1, t2 and K are determined by fitting three properties of PPV, that is, valence band width, energy gap and lattice polymerization.57,58 Without loss of generality, the results obtained by using the values of model parameters for PPV were also qualitatively valid for other conjugated polymers.
Results/discussion
At the beginning, we suppose that an exciton forms at site 20 of chain 1 determined under photoexcitation conditions. Following that, the exciton will transport in the system driven by the interchain packing configuration field, which has been analyzed in detail in our previous work.36 The result of exciton transport dynamics in the system without considering the effect of conjugation defects (i.e., Δt = 0) is shown in Fig. 2, where the color stands for the lattice displacement presented with a smoothed form yn = (−1)n(un+1 + un−1 − 2un)/4 (in Å)). Here, sites 1–124 stand for chain 1 and sites 125–248 stand for chain 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the initially generated exciton apparently transport along chain 1 (i.e., intrachain transport), and during the transport the interchain delocalization of the exciton becomes more apparent due to the strengthening of the interchain coupling between the chains. (In Fig. 2, the yellow-green curve in chain 2 stands for the part where the exciton on chain 1 partially delocalizes to chain 2.) In particular, it takes about 600 fs for the exciton to complete the intrachain transport distance of ∼12 nm. As such, the average exciton transport speed can reach up to ∼20 nm ps−1 for the present values of model parameters, which corresponds to the micrometer scale of the exciton transport distance. However, under actual conditions, the idealized conjugation structure will be inevitably destroyed, and random conjugation defects will be created in the polymer chains. In the following, we will focus on the effect of one conjugation defect on the above-mentioned exciton transport dynamics by considering the variation of the electron transfer integral Δt described in eqn (6).
 Fig. 2  Exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with an ideal conjugation structure. 
Firstly, it should be pointed out that there exist two different kinds of conjugation defects: one is the weakening conjugation corresponding to a negative value of Δt, and the other is the strengthening conjugation corresponding to a positive value of Δt. Although the two kinds of conjugation defects play negative roles in impacting the exciton transport, the physical pictures are quite different. To clarify the difference in mechanism between them, we display in Fig. 3 the evolution of the total energy of the model system during the exciton transport dynamics. The exciton center nc is defined as the geometric center of exciton lattice distortion to label its position during transport. Here, the position of the conjugation defect is assumed to be fixed (m = 59, that is, there exists a conjugation defect at the 59th bond of chain (1), and the values of the parameters are set to be Δt = −0.035 eV (red dots), Δt = 0 eV (blue dots), and Δt = 0.035 eV (green dots), respectively. In the case of Δt = 0, the total energy of the system presents a smooth decrease with the exciton transport. In other words, the steady decrease of the system energy provides a continuous driving force for the exciton to transport along the chain, as shown in Fig. 2. However, when there exists a conjugation defect, the smooth change in the total energy is interrupted near the defect. For instance, in the case of Δt = −0.035 eV, the total energy shows a sudden decrease when the exciton approaches the defect, while in the case of Δt = 0.035 eV, the total energy has a relatively slow decrease. From the energetics point of view, we can conclude that a weakening conjugation (Δt < 0) acts as an energy well for a moving exciton, while a strengthening conjugation (Δt > 0) acts as an energy barrier for that. Therefore, in the following discussions, effects of Δt < 0 and Δt > 0 on exciton transport will be separately considered to analyze their contributions to the trapping and blocking mechanisms.
 Fig. 3  Change of the total energy of the model system during the exciton transport. Here, the position of the conjugation defect is assumed to be fixed at m = 59 of chain 1, and the values of the parameters are set to be Δt = −0.035 eV (red), Δt = 0 eV (blue), and Δt = 0.035 eV (green), respectively. 

Fig. 4A presents the result of the effect of one weakening conjugation on the exciton transport dynamics, where the defect strength is Δt = −0.035 eV and the position located at m = 59 of chain 1. As compared with the result of Δt = 0, we find that when the moving exciton arrives at the defect position, the transport speed becomes so slow and it seems as if the exciton experiences a short-time standstill (∼500 fs) due to trapping by the energy well (denoted as a “short-time delaying” process hereafter). After that, the exciton will get out of the energy well and continue to transport along the chain until it reaches the end of the chain. It is noted that whether the exciton can get out of the energy well or not depends on the depth of the energy well and/or the strength of the conjugation defect. A more systematic simulation shows that, with the increase of the defect strength, the exciton needs longer time to overcome the trapping of the energy well. The exciton is completely trapped in the energy well when the defect strength achieves Δt = −0.040 eV, as shown in Fig. 4B (denoted as a “trapping” process hereafter). Similarly, we further investigate the effect of a strengthening conjugation (i.e., Δt > 0) on the exciton transport dynamics. It is found that when a moving exciton arrives at the defect position, it also experiences a short-time standstill and the dwell time increases with increasing strength of Δt. When the defect strength exceeds a critical value Δtc (that is, the energy barrier increases up to a critical height), the moving exciton cannot overcome the energy barrier anymore (denoted as a “blocking” process hereafter).
 Fig. 4  Exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with different conjugation defects located at the same bond near m = 59 of chain 1 with Δt = −0.035 eV (A) and Δt = −0.040 eV (B), respectively. 
In fact, the effect of the conjugation defect on exciton transport dynamics depends not only on the defect type (Δt < 0 or Δt > 0) and strength but also on the defect position m. We systematically simulate this by adjusting the defect strength in a wide range, as displayed in Fig. 5. In general, the closer to the strong coupling region the defect is located, the weaker the effect of the defect on the exciton transport. On the one hand, in the strong coupling region of the two PPV chains, the exciton is more delocalized between chains,59 as sketched in Fig. 1B. It means that a neighboring chain (chain 2 in our model system) will play a more important role in impacting the exciton transport, and consequently weakens the effect of the conjugation defect located at chain 1. On the other hand, for the exciton transport induced by the linearly coupled PPV chains presented here and in our previous work,36 we find that the exciton has a much faster speed in the strong coupling region. Therefore, it is more difficult for a conjugation defect located at a stronger coupling region to impact the exciton transport dynamics than for that located at a weaker coupling region.
 Fig. 5  Phase diagram about the exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with different conjugation defects (including the type, strength, and position) present in chain 1. 
We now turn to discuss more details about the phase diagram plotted in Fig. 5. In the middle red area, the defect strength is not so strong such that an exciton only experiences a short-time standstill during its transport process due to the trapping (Δt < 0) or blocking (Δt < 0) of the conjugation defect. That is, in such a region, a conjugation defect only delays the exciton transport to an extent, which is referred to as the “short-time delaying” region. In the side areas of Fig. 5, the defect strength is strong enough to trap or block a moving exciton, and we refer to them as the “trapping” region (left green area) and “blocking” region (right blue area) for the exciton transport, respectively. The boundary lines between the “short-time delaying” region and the “trapping” (or “blocking”) region actually show the variation of the critical defect strength Δtc with the defect located at m. Apparently, the critical value Δtc of either the trapping or the blocking region increases as a function of the defect position m. Interestingly, in the case of strengthening conjugation (Δt > 0), there appears a particular region in the phase diagram (see the yellow area in Fig. 5) named the “hopping” region. As shown in Fig. 6, we present an example of the exciton hopping process between chains with the defect strength Δt = 0.08 eV and position m = 95. We can see that although the exciton cannot overcome the blocking effect of the conjugation defect located on chain 1, it can hop to chain 2 and bypass the defect as a result of the strong coupling between chains. After that, the exciton can continue to transport in the system.
 Fig. 6  Exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with one conjugation defect Δt = 0.08 eV located at m = 95 of chain 1. 
In the above discussion, we assume that one conjugation defect exists in the same chain as that where the exciton is photogenerated (i.e., both the exciton and conjugation defect are present in chain 1). In actual materials, conjugation defects may also exist in neighboring chains. Therefore, we further consider the situation in which an exciton is photogenerated in chain 1 while a conjugation defect is present in chain 2. Similar to the results obtained above, whether the exciton can overcome the conjugation defect and continue to transport is also determined by the defect type, strength Δt, as well as the position m. By more systematic simulations, all the possible cases are summarized in Fig. 7, in which four different regions, i.e., the “short-time delaying” region, “trapping” region, “blocking” region, and “hopping” region, are distinguished. Here, we only focus on the differences between two cases. Firstly, as seen from the boundary lines of the “trapping” and “blocking” regions in Fig. 7, the variation trend of the critical value Δtc with the defect position m is different from the corresponding part shown in Fig. 5. The reason is that, in the strong interchain coupling region, an exciton is much inclined to be delocalized in an interchain manner, and the role of chain 1 in the exciton transport is then weakened and that of chain 2 strengthened. Thus, since the conjugation defect is located at chain 2, its trapping or blocking effect on the exciton transport is more significant in the stronger interchain coupling region. Secondly, we stress that the dynamic processes associated with the “hopping” region in Fig. 7 is quite different from those in Fig. 5. On the one hand, the hopping region appears in the case of Δt < 0 when the conjugation defect is located at chain 2. On the other hand, due to the strong trapping effect of the weakening conjugation in chain 2, the exciton after interchain hopping will be completely trapped at the defect position and cannot transport any more, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Phase diagram of the exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with different conjugation defects (including the type, strength, and location) existing in chain 2. The inset shows the interchain hopping process during the exciton transport in such a system, where the defect strength is set to be Δt = −0.285 eV and the location m = 59 of chain 2. 
Finally, it should be stressed that, while our simulations cannot quantitatively reproduce the experimental data (which are also beyond the scope of this work), the findings are in qualitative agreement with the conclusions of the experiments. In experiments, the exciton transport length can be explicitly probed even considering the material defects and disorder.41,47 More recently, Curtin and coworkers measured the dependence of exciton transport length and photovoltaic efficiency on defect concentration, and found that materials with high defect concentration have a small diffusion length and relatively low photovoltaic efficiency.25 However, due to the technical limitations, how the exciton behaves when meeting one defect is still unclear. As such, quantum dynamical research is urgently desired to clarify the nature and the role of different conjugation defects in exciton transport. In view of this, we construct two linearly coupled PPV molecules, and present a theoretical investigation of the effects of different conjugation defects on the dynamics of exciton transport. The findings indicate that a moving exciton experiences different microscopic processes (i.e., “short-time delaying”, “trapping”, “blocking”, or “hopping”) determined by different defects intrinsically present in polymers, and then the exciton transport is suppressed macroscopically, as observed in experiments.25,41,60 In particular, such a suppressing effect can be weakened to some extent by controlling the generating positions of different defects, since an exciton will bypass one defect in strong interchain coupling region, and continue to transport in neighboring chains, as presented in Fig. 6.
Conclusions
By using an extended tight binding SSH model combined with a nonadiabatic dynamics approach, we theoretically studied the effect of one conjugation defect, intrinsically present in π-conjugated polymers, on the exciton transport in two linearly coupled PPV chains. From the energetics point of view, we found that a weakening conjugation actually acts as an energy well to trap a moving exciton, while a strengthening one acts as an energy barrier to block a moving exciton. By considering various conjugation defects (e.g., the defect type, strength, and position), we systematically simulated the intrachain and interchain exciton transport dynamics in such a system, and phase diagrams of all the possible dynamic behaviors were obtained. It is shown that when a moving exciton approaches a weak conjugation defect, it only experiences a transient standstill. However, a strong conjugation defect can completely trap or block a moving exciton, and the critical defect strength is determined by the defect position. In particular, if one conjugation defect locates at strong coupling regions, a moving exciton can experience an interchain hopping process as a result of the exciton interchain delocalization, while whether the hopping exciton can continue to transport or not depends on the defect type.

 	Fig. 2  Exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with an ideal conjugation structure.	 

 	Fig. 3  Change of the total energy of the model system during the exciton transport. Here, the position of the conjugation defect is assumed to be fixed at m = 59 of chain 1, and the values of the parameters are set to be Δt = −0.035 eV (red), Δt = 0 eV (blue), and Δt = 0.035 eV (green), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with different conjugation defects located at the same bond near m = 59 of chain 1 with Δt = −0.035 eV (A) and Δt = −0.040 eV (B), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  Phase diagram about the exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with different conjugation defects (including the type, strength, and position) present in chain 1.	 

 	Fig. 6  Exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with one conjugation defect Δt = 0.08 eV located at m = 95 of chain 1.	 

 	Fig. 7  Phase diagram of the exciton transport dynamics in linearly coupled PPV chains with different conjugation defects (including the type, strength, and location) existing in chain 2. The inset shows the interchain hopping process during the exciton transport in such a system, where the defect strength is set to be Δt = −0.285 eV and the location m = 59 of chain 2.
