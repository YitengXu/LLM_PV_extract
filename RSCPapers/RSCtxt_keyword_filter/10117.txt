    , Accepted 6th January 2017First published on 6th January 2017AbstractHere, we demonstrate that carbon quantum dots (CQDs), as a low cost, chemically stable, and environmentally friendly photosensitizer, can dramatically broaden the light absorption range to the entire visible range. Consequently, the NiOOH/FeOOH/CQD/BiVO4 (NFCB) photoanode has achieved a remarkable photocurrent density of 5.99 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G in KH2PO4 aqueous solution without a hole scavenger (pH = 7) and a record high applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 2.29% at 0.6 V vs. RHE for BiVO4-based photoanodes. This novel NFCB photoanode could operate stably for 10 h with a Faraday efficiency of ∼95%, demonstrating the great potential of using CQDs for solar water splitting.

Broader context
Hydrogen production by photoelectrochemical water splitting can stockpile solar energy into chemical bonds, and is thus a key technology of the future. BiVO4 has been recognized as one of the most important photoanode materials for solar water splitting, but the performance has approached close to its theoretical limit through years of efforts. Therefore, we have gone to great lengths to demonstrate that carbon quantum dots (CQDs) can dramatically broaden the light absorption range to the entire visible range and the NiOOH/FeOOH/CQD/BiVO4 (NFCB) photoanode can achieve a record-high photocurrent density for BiVO4-based photoanodes.

A. Introduction
The growing societal demand for power and energy poses many challenges, such as increasing energy efficiency, developing new energy supplies and protecting the environment. Hydrogen is considered as an ideal energy carrier to meet the challenges because it is clean, renewable, carbon-free, and has a high energy density. Hydrogen production by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting can stockpile solar energy into chemical bonds1,2 and is thus a key technology of the future, which has received widespread attention.3
The efficiency of PEC water splitting is largely determined by the properties of photoelectrodes. Many efforts have been devoted to exploring highly active photoanode materials such as TiO2,4 ZnO,5 WO3,6 BiVO47 and Fe2O3.8 To improve the PEC water splitting capability of photoanodes, strategies have been developed to enhance the efficiencies of light harvesting (LHE) and charge separation (Φsep) or surface charge transfer (ΦOX). The PEC water oxidation photocurrent (JPEC) can be expressed as7JPEC = Jmax × LHE × Φsep × ΦOX,where Jmax is the maximum water oxidation photocurrent density of semiconductor materials. In recent years, BiVO4 with a monoclinic scheelite structure has received great attention as a photoanode, because it can absorb a substantial portion of the solar spectrum (a bandgap energy of ∼2.4 eV) and has a favorable conduction band edge position very near the thermodynamic hydrogen evolution potential (∼0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and a valence band edge position more positive than the oxygen evolution potential (1.23 eV vs. RHE).9 However, the PEC water splitting performance of BiVO4 is still too low because the majority of holes on the surface recombine due to the poor catalytic activity of the BiVO4 surface for oxygen evolution.9 Recently, there have been a flurry of research activities aimed at increasing Jabs (Jabs = Jmax × LHE), Φsep and ΦOX of BiVO4 for PEC water splitting, such as Co–Pi/BiVO4/W–BiVO4 (∼3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE),10 NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 (4.45 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE),7 NiOOH/FeOOH/WO3/(Wo,Mo)–BiVO4 (5.35 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE)11 and NiOOH/FeOOH/N–BiVO4 (∼5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE).12 It was shown that Jabs and the light absorption range of BiVO4 can be improved by N2-treatment,12 while Φsep can be improved by doping (such as in W, Mo–BiVO4),10,11 homojunctions (such as W–BiVO4/BiVO4),10 heterojunctions (such as WO3/BiVO4),11 and nanostructuring (such as nanoporous BiVO4).7 Using oxygen evolution catalysts (OEC, such as Co–Pi, FeOOH and NiOOH) to improve ΦOX is also one of the most important methods to promote the PEC water splitting efficiency of BiVO4,7,9,10,13 and nearly unit ΦOX has been reported without sacrificing Φsep with bi-layered NiOOH/FeOOH, the purported best OEC for BiVO4 based photoanodes to date.7,11,12 Unfortunately, the maximum water oxidation photocurrent (Jmax) of BiVO4 photoanodes under AM 1.5G solar illumination is only 6.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, and the LHE, Φsep and ΦOX of the NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 photoanode have already reached more than 90% of the ceiling through years of efforts inside of the box.7
We believe that another new perspective to enhance the PEC performance of BiVO4 based photoanodes is to broaden the light absorption range further to the visible region or even the infrared region of the solar spectrum by using photosensitizers, thereby directly increasing the Jmax. However, common photosensitizers used in solar cells such as CdS,14 Bi2S315 and CuInS216 are unstable and easily oxidized at operating PEC anodes. Moreover, those photosensitizers are not environmentally friendly, thus limiting the prospect of their large-scale application.17 The crucial challenge now is to find an alternative photosensitizer that can harvest most of the visible photons without degradation when integrated into a photoanode. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) as an emerging optoelectronic material appear to be an excellent candidate for such a photosensitizer since they are green, nontoxic and earth abundant.18 Recent studies have shown that CQDs can improve the visible light response of photocatalysts, such as CQD/ZnO,19 CQD/C3N4,20 CQD/TiO221 and CQD/BiVO4.22 CQDs may serve as a semiconductor to generate electrons and holes leading to enhanced light absorption and photocatalytic activity of the composites. There is an indication that CQDs can also act as a superfast charge tunnel for optoelectronic devices.23 For example, F. Nan and his co-workers reported that a CQD/BiVO4 photoanode achieves about 2.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus the RHE and the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of their CQD/BiVO4 reaches 0.35% at 0.87 V vs. RHE.22 For this report, they found that CQDs can improve the photoanode with a higher current density at a relative lower voltage and enhance separation of the photoexcited charges. However, the water splitting efficiency of the CQDs is still too low because of their low oxygen evolution activity.7,9,24,25 Therefore, the photocurrent density of CQD/BiVO4 is lower than those of other BiVO4-based photoanodes, such as Co–Pi/BiVO4/W–BiVO4 (∼3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE),10 NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 (4.45 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE),7 NiOOH/FeOOH/WO3/(Wo,Mo)–BiVO4 (5.35 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE)11 and NiOOH/FeOOH/N–BiVO4 (∼5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE).20
In order to solve this problem, in the present work, we designed and demonstrated an integrated photoanode that seamlessly embeds an ultrathin interlayer of isolated CQDs between the BiVO4 core and the two OEC shells (NiOOH/FeOOH). As shown in Fig. 1a, the PEC water splitting process consists of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the NiOOH/FeOOH/CQD/BiVO4 (NFCB) photoanode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the Pt cathode.

(b) Schematic diagram illustrating the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes in the water splitting system. 
Of special importance is the generation of photo-carriers from both BiVO4 (UV to visible) and CQDs (visible to near IR), which are subsequently directed to the respective NiOOH/FeOOH layers for OER and to the Pt cathode for HER (Fig. 1b). Our results have clearly demonstrated the enhancing role of CQDs in harvesting the visible solar photons and in separating the nascent electron–hole pairs. The NFCB photoanode achieved a remarkable photocurrent density of 3.91 and 5.99 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G in KH2PO4 aqueous solution without a hole scavenger (pH = 7), respectively, the highest yet reported with BiVO4-based photoanodes. Our analyses demonstrate that the CQDs in this system not only can increase light absorption and the separation of electrons and holes but can also maintain the efficient hole transfer from BiVO4 to the OEC layer, thus accelerating the OER kinetics. This high photocatalytic activity testifies the promise of the NFCB hybrid system as a new kind of photoanode capable of light absorption and photoelectrochemical water splitting in the full visible range and qualifies CQDs to be an excellent photosensitizer of optoelectronic devices because of their suitable photonic and electronic traits as well as their low-cost, environmental friendliness and good stability.
B. Results and discussion
CQDs with a diameter of 5–7 nm were synthesized using a simple pyrolysis method reported.26,27 The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of CQDs in the excitation wavelength from 340 nm to 500 nm are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Because CQDs will agglomerate, the band gap and UV-vis spectrum of CQDs will be changed by different concentrations. Meanwhile, a photon with adequate energy can excite an electron in the HOMO level of CQDs, transferring the excited electron to the LUMO level of CQDs.28 The emission from CQDs shifted to higher wavelength as the intensity increases, which is characteristic of surface-defect emission derived from CQDs as reported by others.21,26,27
The nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode was synthesized on a F doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrate by an electrodeposition method and subsequent calcination.7 The BiVO4 photoanode was immersed in 25 mL of CQD solution for different times (2 h, 4 h and 8 h). The CQD/BiVO4 photoanodes were washed with deionized water afterwards and dried at 80 °C for 8 h. The photograph and UV-vis spectra clearly showed that the light absorption of different samples increased with longer adsorption CQD time (Fig. S3, ESI†). XRD spectra collected from the FTO and different adsorption CQDs of BiVO4 (0, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h) samples are shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†). Except for the SnO2 peaks originating from the FTO substrate, all other diffraction peaks in the XRD spectra obtained for BiVO4 can be well indexed to monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS #14-0688). Fig. S4b (ESI†) compares the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves of samples at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 in 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution as a hole scavenger with KH2PO4 buffer solution (pH = 7) under AM 1.5G irradiation. The photocurrent densities of all CQD/BiVO4 samples are higher than that of pure BiVO4, and the photocurrent density of 8 h-CQD/BiVO4 is lower than that of 4 h-CQD/BiVO4 because the adsorption time is too long and it causes aggregation of CQDs. The typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the 4 h- and 8 h-CQD/BiVO4 are demonstrated in Fig. S5a and b (ESI†), respectively. In Fig. S5b (ESI†), the TEM image of 8 h-CQD/BiVO4 indicates the aggregation of CQDs. Therefore, we chose 4 h-CQD/BiVO4 for the subsequent experiment and analysis.
Diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode and CQD/BiVO4 photoanodes were collected to understand the influence of introducing CQDs on the light harvesting capability. As shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†), the absorption edge of the as-synthesized BiVO4 is at ∼515 nm, which is consistent with recent reports,7,29 and the absorbance of CQD/BiVO4 photoanodes gradually increases with longer immersion times (Fig. S3, ESI†). The band gap of the samples can be determined using the following formula:αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2,where α, h, ν, A, Eg and n are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, incident light frequency, proportionality constant, band-gap and the characteristic integer, respectively. Among them, n depends on the characteristics of the optical transition in a semiconductor, i.e., direct transition (n = 1) or indirect transition (n = 4). BiVO4 pertains to indirect transition and the value of n is 4. The band-gap energy (Eg value) of BiVO4 can thus be estimated from a plot of (αhν)2versus photon energy (hν).
According to Fig. S6a (ESI†), the band-gap energies of the pristine BiVO4 and BiVO4/CQD photoanodes are 2.41 eV and 2.28 eV, respectively, which are consistent with recent reports.7,22 The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of CQD/BiVO4 and pure BiVO4 is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The LHE of CQD/BiVO4 is higher than that of pure BiVO4 in the visible and near infrared ranges (420–800 nm) and it contributes to the increase of Jabs (photocurrent assuming 100% APCE). In order to calculate the Jabs of CQD/BiVO4 and pure BiVO4, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) reference solar spectral irradiance at AM 1.5G (radiation energy (W m−2 nm−1) vs. wavelength (nm)) was multiplied by our measured LHE during each step of the trapezoidal integration (Fig. S6b, ESI†).7,30 Fig. S6b (ESI†) clearly shows that the Jabs of CQD/BiVO4 (9.18 mA cm−2) is much higher than that of pure BiVO4 (4.5 mA cm−2), while the Jabs of the solar irradiance for a unit LHE is 26.3 mA cm−2.
The advantages of the CQDs decorated on the BiVO4 photoanode were demonstrated by the systematic electrochemical and PEC performance of both the pristine BiVO4 and the BiVO4/CQD photoanodes in 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution as a hole scavenger with KH2PO4 buffer solution (pH = 7), under AM 1.5G illumination.

Fig. 2a compares the LSV curves of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode (cyan line) and the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode (purple line) at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The CQD/BiVO4 photoanode exhibited substantially large photo-response current under AM 1.5G irradiation. The CQD/BiVO4 photoanode achieved photocurrent densities of 4.41 and 6.54 mA cm−2 at +0.6 V and +1.23 V vs. RHE, which are much higher than those of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode (3.05 and 4.38 mA cm−2 at +0.6 V vs. RHE and +1.23 V vs. RHE). IPCE measurements were further performed to investigate the PEC performances of the as-prepared photoelectrodes measured at +0.6 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution as a hole scavenger with KH2PO4 buffer solution (pH = 7). The absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) was obtained by dividing the IPCE by the LHE at each wavelength using the following equation:7APCE = IPCE/LHE.

(a) J–V curves recorded at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G irradiation in potassium phosphate solution with Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger (pH 7); (b) APCE and IPCE spectra collected at the incident wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm (inset shows the wavelength range from 500 to 800 nm) at 0.6 V vs. RHE in potassium phosphate solution with Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger (pH 7); (c) J–V curves recorded at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G irradiation in potassium phosphate solution with no hole scavenger (pH 7); (d) APCE and IPCE spectra collected in the incident wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm at 0.6 V vs. RHE in potassium phosphate solution with no hole scavenger (pH 7). 
The IPCE and APCE data show that the photo-active range of the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode covered the full visible light range (420–800 nm) and the photo-active range of the pristine BiVO4 photoanode covered only 420–515 nm (Fig. 2b). However, the photocurrent densities of the pristine BiVO4 and the CQD/BiVO4 photoanodes in KH2PO4 aqueous solution without a Na2SO3 hole scavenger were still too low (Fig. 2c). The pristine BiVO4 photoanode and the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode achieved current densities of only 1.35 mA cm−2 and 2.43 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G irradiation (Fig. 2c). The pristine BiVO4 photoanode and the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode in solution without a hole scavenger achieve only less than 10% of their IPCE and APCE in solution with a hole scavenger (Fig. 2d).
The majority of the surface-reached holes recombined at the surface due to the poor catalytic nature of the BiVO4 surface for water oxidation.7,9,25
To make maximum use of the surface-reached holes, FeOOH and NiOOH were used as OECs, which were deposited on the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode surface by a photoelectrodeposition method.7 This method can promote the OEC growth on the photo-active surface of the photoanode in the first step. After photoelectrodeposition, the samples were subjected to irradiation for 1–10 min, which can optimize open-circuit voltage (Fig. S8, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the NiOOH/FeOOH/CQD/BiVO4 (NFCB) sample shows that 600–700 nm thick NFCB films were grown on FTO successfully and some nanoparticles were grown on the nanoporous BiVO4 surface. Fig. 3c–k show the TEM images of the NFCB sample, from which one can see the lattice spacings of 0.321 nm and 0.202 nm corresponding to the (101) and (202) planes of graphitic carbon and the lattice spacing of 0.212 nm corresponding to the (051) planes of BiVO4 (JCPDS #14-0688). In addition, as shown in Fig. 3c–h, the signals of elements Fe, Ni, O, Bi, and V are clearly observed, respectively, suggesting that FeOOH and NiOOH cover the nanoporous BiVO4 surface uniformly (Fig. S9, ESI†). The XPS survey spectra of NFCB photoanodes are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), which are consistent with recent reports.11,31

The PEC water splitting capability of NFCB is demonstrated in Fig. 4. The Φsep analyses were conducted to understand how efficiently the photo-generated electrons and holes are separated in the active material. Moreover, we analyzed the ΦOX to pin down the kinetic facility of transfer of the surface-reached holes into the solution to complete the OER process. Since the rate of charge transfer to the electrolyte interface is very fast in the presence of hole scavengers, it can be assumed that the surface recombination of charges is eliminated and the ΦOX with hole scavengers is ≈100%.25 The photocurrent density with the Na2SO3 hole scavenger (JHS) is given by JHS = Jabs × Φsep, and the photocurrent density without a hole scavenger (JPEC) is given by JPEC ≈ Jabs × Φsep × ΦOX.25,32 Due to the addition of the Na2SO3 hole scavenger, light absorption, flat band potentials, Jabs and Φsep of photoanodes would remain unchanged.25,32,33 Therefore, ΦOX can be calculated from JHS and JPEC as7,25,32ΦOX = (JPEC)/(JHS)

In Fig. 4a, the NFCB photoanode achieves a current density of 4.30 mA cm−2 at +0.6 V in 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution as a hole scavenger with KH2PO4 buffer solution (pH = 7), which is very close to that of the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode (4.41 mA cm−2), indicating that the Φsep (Φsep = (Jabs)/(JHS)) of NFCB is also close to that of the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode (Fig. S11, ESI†). This result suggests that NiOOH/FeOOH will not cause serious recombination in photo-generated carriers. As shown in Fig. 4b, the NFCB photoanode achieved photocurrent densities of 3.91 and 5.99 mA cm−2 at 0.6 and 1.23 V vs. RHE in KH2PO4 solution without a hole scavenger, which are much higher than those of NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4 (NFB, 2.26 and 4.07 mA cm−2), pristine BiVO4 (0.23 and 1.35 mA cm−2) and CQD/BiVO4 (0.38 and 2.43 mA cm−2), respectively. For references, we also use different OECs for CQD/BiVO4, such as the Co–Pi layer and the CoOx nanoparticle, and the NFCB sample is much better than the Co–Pi/CQD/BiVO4 sample and the CoOx/CQD/BiVO4 sample (Fig. S12, ESI†). As can be seen from Fig. 4c, ΦOXs of both BiVO4 and CQD/BiVO4 photoanodes are still too low (8.79% and 7.22% at 0.6 V vs. RHE), confirming the poor catalytic nature of BiVO4 and the CQD/BiVO4 surface for water oxidation. However, ΦOX values of the NFCB and NFB photoanodes are 85% and 66% at 0.5 V vs. RHE, respectively, which are much higher than those of the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode and the pristine BiVO4 photoanode (8.79% and 7.22% at +0.6 V vs. RHE). These results verify the role of NiOOH/FeOOH as the OEC in enhancing the PEC water oxidation capacity of the pristine BiVO4 and the CQD/BiVO4 photoanodes. Additionally, the NFCB photoanode can achieve a much higher PEC water splitting efficiency by using only a much lower bias voltage. ABPE of the pristine BiVO4, CQD/BiVO4, NFB and NFCB photoanodes is calculated by using the J–V curve and plotted in Fig. 4d. The maximum ABPE of NFCB reaches 2.29% at 0.6 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of NFB (1.50% at 0.65 V vs. RHE), CQD/BiVO4 (0.38% at 0.87 V vs. RHE) and the pristine BiVO4 photoanode (0.25% at 0.83 V vs. RHE). These results clearly show that the CQDs enable the maximum ABPE of the NFCB photoanode at a lower bias than that of the NFB photoanode. As listed in Table S1 (ESI†), these photocurrent densities (5.99 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) and ABPE (2.29% at 0.6 V vs. RHE) are the highest recorded for BiVO4-based photoanodes. Evidently, the highest efficiency has been achieved for the NFCB photoanode at the lowest potential (0.6 V vs. RHE), which shows the highest performance of PEC water splitting for BiVO4-based photoanodes.
IPCE and APCE measurements were performed to further understand the PEC performances of the as-prepared photoelectrodes. Fig. 4e and Fig. S12 (ESI†), respectively, show the results obtained at 0.6 and 1.23 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M KH2PO4 aqueous solution with no hole scavenger (pH = 7). In Fig. 4e, the NFCB photoanode achieved APCEs of 67% and 17% at 460 and 600 nm, respectively, which are very close to those with the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode in the presence of hole scavengers (78% and 21%, respectively, see Fig. 2b). When the bias voltage of the system was increased to 1.23 V vs. RHE, the APCE of the NFCB photoanode increased to 98% and 27% at 460 and 600 nm, respectively (Fig. S13, ESI†). Even at 800 nm, the NFCB photoanode achieved APCEs of 3.7% (0.6 V vs. RHE) and 6.67% (1.23 V vs. RHE), establishing the NFCB photoanode for PEC water splitting in the full range of visible light. Therefore, the CQDs can not only increase the LHE and Jabs but also facilitate the electron/hole separation and charge transfer at the interfaces.
To rationalize these phenomena, the fluorescence quenching test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out. To a certain extent, the relative fluorescence intensity of a sample can reflect the separation efficiency of electrons and holes.26,34 As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the fluorescence intensity of CQD solution decreases as the concentration of BiVO4 increases, manifesting the positive role of CQDs in promoting the separation of electrons and holes. To gain a deeper insight into the interfacial charge transfer behavior in PEC cells, EIS measurements were carried out. The EIS measurements clearly show that the arc radius of NFCB both in the dark and under light is smaller compared to those of NFB in potassium phosphate electrolyte with no hole scavenger (pH 7) at 0.6 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4f), indicating a faster interfacial charge transfer in the former than in the latter.9,13 Similar results have been reported for energy storage.35 These results clearly show that the CQDs enable the resistance of the NFCB photoanode at a lower bias compared to that of the NFB photoanode, which further confirm that the CQDs not only can increase the separation of electrons and holes but also can enhance the hole transfer ability from BiVO4 to the OEC layer.
As shown in Fig. 5 and Movie S1 (ESI†), the NFCB photoanode exhibits great prowess and excellent operational stability for PEC water splitting in potassium phosphate solution with no hole scavenger (pH 7) at 0.6 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G irradiation. In Fig. 5 (top), the chronoamperometry (i–t) curves of the NFBC photoanode collected at a potential are the same as the maximum ABPE (0.6 V vs. RHE) in potassium phosphate solution with no hole scavenger (pH 7). The O2 and H2 gases were quantified every 1 hour by GC integration (Fig. 5 bottom). The total amounts of O2 and H2 were 330 μmol and 664 μmol after a 10 h test, which are close to the calculated amount of H2 from LSV data with about 95% Faraday efficiency. We compared the differences between the NFCB (with OEC layer) anode and the CQD/BiVO4 (without OEC layer) anode. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5, the color and photocurrent density of the NFCB anode after 10 h reaction show no obvious change. However, as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), the Faraday efficiency of NFCB is higher than that of the CQD/BiVO4 photoanode without OEC (75%). The color of the CQD/BiVO4 anode changes from brown to yellow, and the photocurrent density of CQD/BiVO4 reduces from 0.38 mA cm−2 to 0.31 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the XPS data also prove that the OEC layer can protect CQDs. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), after 10 h reaction, the C1s peaks of NFCB still show C–C, C–OH and CO characteristics. However, the CO peaks of CQD/BiVO4 can't be found in the C1s characteristic peak, and the intensity of the C–OH characteristic peak is also less than that of NFCB. These findings prove that the OEC is the key of the photoanode and the NFCB photoanodes are a very promising candidate for developing PEC water splitting devices.

(bottom) H2 and O2 evolution of the NFCB photoanode at 0.6 V vs. RHE; dashed curves indicate the H2 and O2 evolution with about 95% Faraday efficiency. 
In summary, as shown in Fig. 6, when visible light radiated on the NFCB photoanode, the photo-generated electrons and holes were generated by CQDs and BiVO4. In this process, because the CQDs increase the light harvesting range of the BiVO4 electrode, the photoanode can provide more electrons and holes. On the other hand, the FeOOH layer served as the hole transport layer in this system.

The photo-generated electrons were isolated by FeOOH and the holes were harvested by FeOOH. At the same time, the CQDs reduced the conductivity of the FeOOH layer to provide the layer with better ability of hole transport. NiOOH served as the main water oxidation layer, due to the high oxidation of holes, the Ni oxidation state of NiOOH changed from Ni3+ to a higher state (Ni4+) by holes. The Ni4+ state was reduced to the Ni2+ state by withdrawing electrons from the OH− of water (produce oxygen). Then the Ni2+ state was changed to the Ni3+ state by holes. Therefore, the CQDs in this system can not only increase the light absorption and separation of electrons and holes but can also maintain the efficient hole transfer from BiVO4 to the OEC layer, thus accelerating the OER kinetics.
C. Conclusions
In this work, the NFCB photoanodes were designed, prepared and successfully demonstrated. The preparation methods combine electrodeposition, subsequent calcination, adsorption and sequential photoelectrodeposition. The NFCB photoanodes exhibited significantly enhanced PEC activity for water splitting under visible light irradiation due to a synergistic effect between CQDs and BiVO4. Our results clearly indicate that the NFCB photoanode achieved a remarkable photocurrent density of 3.91 and 5.99 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G in KH2PO4 aqueous solution without a hole scavenger (pH = 7), respectively, which is about 16 times higher than the pristine BiVO4 photoanode (0.24 and 1.35 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively). In addition, we discovered that the CQDs in this system can not only broaden the light response range (from 300 nm to 800 nm) and increase the separation of electrons and holes (67% and 17% APCE at 460 and 600 nm 0.6 V vs. RHE), but can also maintain the hole transfer ability from BiVO4 to the OEC layer (85% ΦOX at 0.5 V vs. RHE). This synergistic effect between CQDs and BiVO4 makes the NFCB photoanode stand out, leading to the record PEC performance for an oxide photoelectrode (2.29% ABPE for solar water splitting). The demonstration of the NFCB photoanodes here with excellent solar water splitting capability will provide information on the design and development of the next-generation PEC electrode materials.
D. Experimental
Preparation of carbon quantum dots (CQDs)
CQDs were synthesized using a simple pyrolysis method reported.26 In a typical procedure, 0.75 g of sucrose (AR, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent) was dissolved in deionized water (30 mL) at normal temperature with continuous stirring for 30 min. The as-prepared solution was subsequently loaded into a 40 mL Teflon lined stainless autoclave and heated to 180 °C for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained products were collected and washed with deionized water and ethanol and dried at 60 °C.
Preparation of CQD/BiVO4 photoanodes
BiVO4 photoanodes were fabricated by a three-step process via a modified method as originally developed by Kim and Choi.7 Generally, the BiOI nanosheets were prepared by template-free electrochemical deposition in a conventional three-electrode glass cell. A piece of F-doped SnO2 coated glass (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass) (area of ∼2.0 cm2) served as the working electrode, a Pt electrode served as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode served as the reference electrode. A 0.04 M Bi(NO3)3 solution was prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (99.0%, Shanghai Macklin Bio-chemical Co. Ltd) in a 50 ml of a 0.4 M KI solution (99.0%, Tianjin Zhiyuan Reagent Co. Ltd) after its pH was adjusted to 1.7 by adding HNO3 (65–68%, AR, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent). This solution was mixed with 20 mL of absolute ethanol (100%) containing 0.23 M p-benzoquinone (97%, Aladdin), and vigorously stirred for a few minutes. Cathodic deposition was performed potentiostatically at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at room temperature (RT) (25 °C) for 250 s. The second step was the conversion of BiOI to BiVO4, which was achieved by impregnating BiOI electrodes with the solution of 0.2 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (AR, Tianjin Damao Reagent) containing 0.2 M vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) (95%, Aladdin), and then annealed in air at 450 °C (ramping rate = 2 °C per min) for 2 h. Lastly, excess V2O5 in the BiVO4 electrodes was removed by soaking them in 1 M NaOH (AR, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent) solution for 30 min with gentle stirring. The resulting pure BiVO4 electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried at RT. The BiVO4 photoanode was immersed in 25 mL CQD solution for different times (2 h, 4 h and 8 h). The CQD/BiVO4 photoanodes were washed with deionized water afterwards and dried at 80 °C for 8 h (Fig. S2, ESI†). The resulting CQD/BiVO4 electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C for 8 h.
Photoelectrodeposition of the NiOOH/FeOOH OEC layer
The NiOOH/FeOOH OEC layer was synthesized using a simple photoelectrodeposition method reported.7 First, the FeOOH layer was photoelectrodeposited on CQD/BiVO4 and BiVO4 in 0.1 M FeSO4 (AR, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent) solution at 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl (total charge 45 mC cm−2). Then, the NiOOH layer was photoelectrodeposited on FeOOH/CQD/BiVO4 and FeOOH/BiVO4 in 0.1 M NiSO4 (AR, Guangzhou Chemical Reagent) solution at 0.11 V vs. Ag/AgCl (total charge 22 mC cm−2). After photoelectrodeposition, the electrodeposition of NiOOH was carried out in 0.1 M solution at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 1 min. Before PEC testing, the samples were under irradiation for 1–10 min, which can make open-circuit voltage achieve the best effect (Fig. S8, ESI†).
Analysis
The as-synthesized products were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss ULTRA 55), an X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD, D8 ADVANCE), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100 F, FEI Tecnai G2F30), and an X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscope (XPS, ESCALab250) and room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm were obtained using a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5301PC). The optical properties of the products were measured using an UV-vis-NIR Spectrophotometer (UV-vis-NIR, Shimadzu UV-2450).
Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical measurements
All the PEC and electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell with a flat quartz window to facilitate illumination of the photoelectrode surface. The working electrode is the product fabricated in this work, while the Pt electrode and the Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The illumination source was an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport, LCS 100 94011A (class A, Fig. S19, ESI†)) directed at the quartz PEC cell (100 mW cm−2). IPCE were collected by a Solartron 1280B electrochemical station with a solar simulator (Newport 69920, 1000 W Xenon lamp), coupled with an infrared water filter (Oriel 6127) and an aligned monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m). All the electrochemical measurements were performed on an SP-150 electrochemical workstation (SP-150, Bio-Logic SAS, France) at RT.

Broader context
Hydrogen production by photoelectrochemical water splitting can stockpile solar energy into chemical bonds, and is thus a key technology of the future. BiVO4 has been recognized as one of the most important photoanode materials for solar water splitting, but the performance has approached close to its theoretical limit through years of efforts. Therefore, we have gone to great lengths to demonstrate that carbon quantum dots (CQDs) can dramatically broaden the light absorption range to the entire visible range and the NiOOH/FeOOH/CQD/BiVO4 (NFCB) photoanode can achieve a record-high photocurrent density for BiVO4-based photoanodes.
