    , Accepted 27th December 2018First published on 27th December 2018AbstractA multifunctional tandem cell has been fashioned by (i) replacing the conventional counter electrode in a n-type titanium dioxide-based quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSC) with a QD-sensitized p-type nickel oxide photocathode to harness maximum power-conversion efficiency, and (ii) by coating an electrochromic molybdenum oxide overlayer at the photoanode. Light harvesting In2S3 nano-flakes were deposited onto a mesoporous NiO semiconductor scaffold. On pairing with the n-QDSC, substantial gains in the photovoltaic performance were achieved owing to greater spectral utilization across the visible region. Improvements to the photoanode architecture were developed by embedding plasmonic Au NPs in the CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 layer to augment the light absorption via plasmonic and scattering effects which translated to higher photocurrent densities. A thin film of MoO3 was applied to the photoanode, which provided an electrochromic response upon illumination, due to the concurrent insertion of an electron and a cation in the MoO3 matrix. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved was 6.01% for the n-QDSC half-cell (TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3-nS2−/Sn2−-C-fabric) and 0.047% for the p-QDSC half-cell (NiO/In2S3-nS2−/Sn2−-C-fabric). A stellar PCE value of 7.99% was attained when the two half-cells were co-assembled in a tandem device, in spite of the disparity in performance between the photoanode and photocathode. The maximum transmission modulation for the tandem device under 1 sun irradiance was 34% and the photocoloration efficiency was 16.4 cm2 min−1 W−1 at 550 nm. The results highlight the potential opportunities for combining energy conversion and light management in photovoltaics based on nanotechnology.
Introduction
The performance of quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSC)1 has risen steadily over recent years to a maximum solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of around 12%. To induce a step-change in efficiency, to bring them in line with established PV technology, efforts are now dedicated to developing p/n tandem cells which contain both a photoanode (based on n-type TiO2 or ZnO) and photocathode (typically based on p-type NiO) in a single device. Studies in the recent past have shown that experimentation centered around either the TiO2-based n-type- or NiO-based p-type-QDSC, has the potential to yield very high efficiency.2,3 Approaches undertaken to improve the performance of TiO2-based QDSCs include using complementary QDs of different sizes or chemical composition, for panchromatic absorption of solar radiation, or integrating QDs with intrinsic electron or hole conductors that facilitate charge transport.4,5 Further improvements to the QDSC performance have been achieved by embedding plasmonic metal nanoparticles on the QD sensitized TiO2 photoanode.6 In these systems, a match between the absorption wavelength of the QDs with the localized surface plasmon resonance peak of the noble metal nanoparticle increases the near-field electromagnetic intensity and, therefore, amplifies the photocurrent.7,8 The electron accepting ability of metal nanoparticles, via an appositely positioned work function, 5.1 eV of Au NPs, augments the charge transfer to the current collector.9 Building on this idea, in this work, plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been deposited onto the surface of CdS-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes, together with a thin layer of MoO3. In organic photovoltaics, solution-processed MoO3 thin films have been investigated as a versatile hole-injection layer.10 The s-MoO3 layer is very proficient in hole extraction because it possesses deep lying electronic states with a work function of 5.5 eV.11 This non-toxic and n-type semiconducting transition-metal oxide shows distinct electrochromism. The transparent as-fabricated film darkens to appear blue in color when reduced to NaxMoO3 through concurrent injection of electrons and intercalation of charge-compensating cations into the MoO3 lattice.12,13 (Transparent) MoO3 + x(Na+ + e−) → NaxMoVI(1−x)MoVxO3 (deep blue)(1)
There have been many reports on NiO-based photoactive cathodes applied in dye-sensitized solar cells over the last few years,14–16 but in the case of QDSCs, there is still immense scope for exploration.17 Finding suitable QD-sensitized photocathodes would pave the way for the application of tandem QDSCs, which could, in theory, surpass the maximum attainable conversion efficiency of single-junction QDSCs. To achieve this, the photocurrent generated by the photocathode must match the photocurrent generated by the photoanode. However, to date, the efficiencies of “p-type” solar cells lag behind those of the more established “n-type” devices.
A promising strategy to obtain photocurrents in p-type photocathodes which are comparable to the n-type systems is to sensitize mesoporous wide band gap semiconductors, such as NiO, with light-absorbing QDs rather than dyes. The advantages of QD sensitizers include the ability to finely tune the visible response and position of the valence band (VB) edge by modulating both the QD size and composition. It is also possible to obtain higher photocurrents by boosting the hole injection through the phenomenon of multiple exciton generation.18 In addition, such sensitizers have higher molar extinction coefficients than those of molecular dyes, which could enable thinner films to be used to compensate for the relatively short diffusion length in NiO compared to TiO2.19 Complementary to the photoanode, a photoexcited QD injects a hole into the VB of the NiO cathode which travels to the charge collector.20 Indium sulfide (In2S3) is an example of a group III–VI compound semiconductor material which has shown merit as suitable QD material for n-QDSC,21 and its use can potentially be extended to photocathodes. Depending upon the temperature and pressure, it exists in three crystallographic modifications: viz., α, β and γ. Of these polymorphs, β-In2S3, with a tetragonal structure, is the most stable state below 693 K. Its direct bandgap varies between 2.0 and 2.45 eV, depending upon the composition and the NPs are light-absorbing in the visible region.22In situ growth techniques such as chemical bath deposition (CBD) provide a relatively inexpensive, simple and convenient route for large area deposition.23 The electron injection rate from in situ grown QDs increases as the distance between electron donor and acceptor is progressively reduced.
Herein In2S3 sensitized NiO supported on a carbon (C)-fabric substrate was used as the photocathode. The C-fabric current collector is a cost-effective, highly conducting (with low sheet resistance) alternative to FTO glass, which requires no elaborate treatment prior to use. TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 was chosen for the photoanode assembly and, due to the use of QDs instead of dyes as the light harvester, an alkaline polysulfide redox couple gel electrolyte was incorporated. This architecture enhances the theoretical solar-to-electrical conversion efficiency by collecting photons on two photo-electrodes within a single device, thereby reducing the spectral losses. In addition, we present the possibility to improve the performance and open up new applications of the devices through the incorporation of a multifunctional MoO3 coating.
Experimental
Chemicals
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass with a sheet resistance of ∼25 Ω cm−2 was purchased from Pilkington and cleaned consecutively in soap solution, 10% HCl solution, 10% NaOH solution, distilled water, acetone/ethanol (v/v: 1:1) and iso-propanol. TiO2 (P25) and fumed silica were free gifts from Evonik and Cabosil respectively. Titanium chloride (TiCl4), sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, toluene, potassium chloride (KCl), sulfur powder were purchased from Merck; Triton X-100, gold(III) chloride solution (HAuCl4, 99.99%), ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), indium(III) chloride (InCl3), thioacetamide, acetyl acetone, cadmium acetate [Cd(CH3COO)2], sodium sulfide (Na2S), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), oleylamine and tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB, 98%) were acquired from Sigma Aldrich. Carbon-fabric (sheet resistance ∼10 Ω cm−2) was procured from Alibaba Pvt. Ltd. Ultra-pure water with a resistivity of ∼18.2 MΩ cm was obtained through a Millipore Direct-Q3 UV system.
Synthesis of oleylamine-capped Au nanoparticles
An aqueous solution of 10 mM HAuCl4 was prepared in 25 mL of ultra-pure water and then mixed with 25 mL of a toluene solution containing 25 mM TOAB. Once the Au precursors were transferred into the toluene phase, the dense water phase was discarded. Oleylamine (1.65 mL) was added into the Au–TOAB in toluene solution. NaBH4 (0.283 g) dissolved in 15 mL of deionized water was quickly added dropwise with vigorous stirring. The mixture turned deep red and was used without further purification.24
Synthesis of the MoO3 solution
The MoO3 solution was prepared by heating 0.4 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O in distilled water (10 mL) at 80 °C for 1 h in air. The precursor decomposed to three components: MoO3, NH3 and H2O, among which NH3 evaporated, and MoO3 was the only solute left in the solution. The resulting solution was diluted to 40 mL with deionized water.25
Photoanode preparation
A TiO2 slurry was prepared by dispersing TiO2 powder in a solution of 1.5 mL of acetyl acetone, 8.5 mL of ultrapure water and 20 mg of Triton X-100. A screen printing technique was employed to apply this slurry over a pre-cleaned FTO substrate. The as-fabricated TiO2 film was heated at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by annealing at 500 °C for another 30 min. This procedure was repeated to apply, heat and anneal a second layer of TiO2. Finally, the TiO2-coated FTO substrate was immersed in an aqueous TiCl4 (40 mM) solution for 30 min at 70 °C, and the resulting TiO2 film was rinsed in deionized water and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. CdS QDs were deposited onto the TiO2 film by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. Clear homogeneous solutions of 0.1 M cadmium acetate and 0.1 M sodium sulfide in methanol were taken in two separate beakers as the Cd2+ and S2− ion precursors, respectively. The TiO2 film was first dipped in the Cd2+ precursor for 2 min, rinsed in methanol to remove excess ions, and then dried at 60 °C in a hot air oven. The same film was subsequently immersed in the S2− precursor solution for 2 min followed by rinsing in solvent and oven drying to form one layer of CdS over the TiO2 film. These steps constitute one SILAR cycle. The TiO2/CdS film was completed by performing five more SILAR cycles on the film, which was then oven dried for two days at 50 °C. Au nanoparticles were incorporated in the TiO2/CdS electrodes by drop-casting the Au NPs in toluene solution and evaporating the solvent by drying in air. A very thin film of MoO3 was formed over the TiO2/CdS/Au electrode by adding one drop of the diluted solution and the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 film was annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min (Scheme 1).

Photocathode preparation
The NiO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of anhydrous NiCl2 and 1 g of Pluronic P123 (PEG-PPG-PEG) symmetric tri-block copolymer in a 6:5 (v/v) mixture of ethanol and ultrapure Milli-Q water. The solution was left at rest for 3 days at 30 °C, and then centrifuged. NiO electrodes were made by applying the supernatant solution onto C-fabric followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min.26 Upon these C-fabric/NiO films, In2S3 nanoparticles were deposited by CBD. Anhydrous InCl3 (0.35 g) and thioacetamide (0.18 g) were dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water. The C-fabric/NiO films and blank C-fabrics were dipped vertically in the solution and heated on a hot plate at 70 °C for 2 h with constant stirring (for different durations). The films were collected, washed with distilled water and finally dried at 60 °C in air.27 The resulting films were labelled as C-fabric/NiO/In2S3 and C-fabric/In2S3 electrodes. Single layer NiO films sensitized with In2S3 were also prepared on FTO glass substrates for half-cell measurements, and for evaluating the photoelectrochromic response.
Device fabrication
Tandem devices used for photovoltaic measurements were assembled by sandwiching the photoanode (TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 or their other combinations) and the photocathode (C-fabric/NiO/In2S3 or C-fabric/In2S3) with their active areas facing each other and a 2 mm wide para-film spacer between them. The two electrodes were clamped together with binder clips after filling the gap between active sites with a polysulfide gel electrolyte. The electrolyte was prepared by vigorously mixing 1 M Na2S and 1 M elemental sulfur powder in 10 mL ultrapure water until it turned into a clear dark-yellow colored solution. 4 wt% of fumed silica was dispersed by stirring to form a homogeneous polysulfide gel. Half-cells were assembled similarly with TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 or NiO/In2S3 as the photoanode and with a blank C-fabric substrate as the counter electrode.
Instrumental methods
XRD patterns were recorded on a PANalytical, X'PertPRO instrument with a Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation as the X-ray source. A field emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Supra 40 FE-SEM) was used for imaging the surface morphology of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained for samples deposited on carbon coated copper grids (via suspension in acetone and evaporation) on a JEOL 2100 microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The optical absorption and the transmission spectra of the films of were recorded on a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (T90+ of PG Instruments). A Horiba Fluoromax-4 spectrometer was used for recording fluorescence spectra of the photoactive films. Current versus potential (I–V) data of QDSCs were measured under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination using a LOT-Oriel solar simulator equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp, an AM 1.5 filter, capable of delivering a collimated output beam of 25 mm diameter, coupled with a Metrohm Autolab PSTAT302N. The spatial uniformity of irradiance was confirmed by calibrating with a 2 cm × 2 cm Si reference cell and re-affirmed with an ILT1400 radiometer/photometer. Incident power to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) versus wavelength was measured on a Newport machine compliant to ASTM E1021-12 standard with a tunable xenon arc lamp (300 W) as the light source. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) for photoanodes were recorded on an Autolab PGSTAT 302N equipped with a frequency response analyzer and a NOVA 1.11 software, under an ac amplitude of 20 mV over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. Photovoltage decay versus time and photocurrent versus time measurements were carried out by using a tungsten-halogen lamp as the light source coupled to an Autolab PGSTAT 302N, which recorded the chronopotentiometric as well as chronoamperometric data in dark. The Mott–Schottky plot of In2S3 was derived from dark EIS measurement with Pt and Ag/AgCl/KCl as counter and reference electrode respectively using 0.1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of pristine-TiO2, CdS, Au, MoO3, NiO and In2S3 deposited over FTO substrates were recorded in a three electrode cell, with the aforementioned as working electrodes, a Pt rod as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl/KCl as the reference electrode in an aqueous 0.1 M KCl electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
Photocathode assembly and structural characterisation of the photocathode components
Two types of mesoporous NiO cathodes were prepared. A C-fabric electrode was coated with NiO, by drop-casting a Ni salt-Pluronic 123 precursor, followed by annealing in air. The precursor was also deposited on FTO-coated glass by doctor blade and annealed. A semi-transparent photocathode was constructed from In2S3 nano-flakes tethered to the NiO film on FTO glass. The extent of deposition of In2S3 was optimized by varying the reaction time while monitoring the change in the optical band gap, which was deduced from the shift in the absorption band edge in the visible spectrum (see below).
The XRD pattern of the In2S3 nano-flakes (Fig. 1a), contains distinct peaks at 2θ = 27.42°, 33.22°, 43.59°, 47.67°, 56.58°, 60.77°,67.66°, 70.83° and 77.03° aligning with d = 3.25, 2.70, 2.07, 1.91, 1.63, 1.52, 1.38, 1.33 and 1.24 Å, corresponding to the (213), (220), (323), (400), (426), (431), (525), (444) and (606) planes of body-centered tetragonal In2S3. The XRD pattern of NiO (Fig. 1b) reveals well-defined peaks at 2θ = 37.25°, 43.28°, 62.86°, 75.40° and 79.39°, and they are attributed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of NiO with a face centered cubic (fcc) crystal lattice (JCPDS: 711179). The SEM and TEM images of In2S3, displayed in Fig. 1c–f, show that the photosensitizer has a nano-flake-like morphology. Elongated fiber like shapes, 35 to 40 nm in length, interspersed with irregular shaped flaky structures are observed in the images. A lattice scale image (Fig. 1c), extracted from a nano-flake shows an inter-fringe distance of 0.33 nm, which matches an inter-planar spacing (d) of 3.25 Å, corresponding to the (213) plane of the body-centered tetragonal structure of In2S3 (JCPDS: 731366). The TEM image of NiO (Fig. 1g–i) illustrates that the oxide is made up of misshaped interconnected nanoparticles with indistinguishable grain boundaries. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of NiO (inset of Fig. 1i) shows bright spots superimposed over diffuse rings, and these are assigned to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of fcc NiO corresponding to d values of 2.41, 2.09 and 1.48 Å. The particles are porous, an outcome of the templating method used for synthesizing NiO. Annealing the Ni salt-Pluronic 123 precursor film burns out the organic material and leaves behind voids or pores, which function as active sites for the In2S3 nano-flakes to anchor onto. A surface area of 47.6 m2 g−1, pore volume of 0.2 cm3 g−1 and average pore size of 28.4 Å were determined from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of NiO (Fig. S1, ESI†).

(g and h) TEM- and (i) lattice scale-images of NiO; inset shows the corresponding SAED pattern. 
SEM images of the NiO and NiO/In2S3 assembly tethered to the C-fabric substrate are shown in Fig. 2a–e. Pristine C-fabric is composed of inter-woven carbon fibers having a smooth texture (inset of Fig. 2c), which provides a high electroactive surface area for the anchoring of the photocathode components. The SEM images of the C-fabric/NiO electrode (Fig. 2a and b) show that the carbon fibers are uniformly coated with the oxide particles and the texture now appears to be rough. When the In2S3 layer is deposited on top of the NiO layer, the density of particles appears to increase, particularly in the gaps between the NiO coated carbon fibers, as can be judged from Fig. 2c and d. An enlarged view of the C-fabric/NiO/In2S3 assembly (Fig. 2e) shows aggregates of In2S3 flakes deposited over the NiO coated carbon fibers. The EDX spectrum and elemental mapping are shown in Fig. 2f. The elemental mapping over a 2.5-micron length region shows uniform coverage of In2S3 and NiO over carbon fibers, for all the four major elements, S, In, O and Ni are observed to be homogeneously distributed. The concentration of In2S3 is comparatively higher than that of NiO as can be seen from the EDX spectrum. The mass ratio of In2S3 and NiO is 2.3:1.

Optical properties of the photoanode components
The UV-visible absorption spectra of In2S3 nano-flakes were recorded at half-hour intervals during the deposition (0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h and 2 h) and are shown in Fig. 3a. The absorption edge shifts to longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a function of increasing deposition time, indicating that the dimensions of In2S3 are controlled by the duration of immersion. For the 2 h deposition time, the In2S3 light absorbers exhibited a broad absorption peak in the 315–430 nm wavelength range, corresponding to a band gap of 2.2 eV which is the closest to literature values.28 The narrowing of the band gap indicates that the size of the nanostructures increases over time. During the deposition, In2S3 particles rearrange to form stable structures, and a combination of nano-needles and nanoparticles results at the end of 2 h. This film exhibited a broader spectral absorption and a lower band gap compared to the In2S3 obtained at the end of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 h immersion spans. Fig. 3b depicts the absorption spectra of pristine NiO and NiO/In2S3. The NiO spectrum contains shows a strong absorption in the UV region with a band gap of 3.6 eV and NiO/In2S3 films reflect the cumulative absorption features of both NiO (UV) and In2S3 (UV-visible).

The fluorescence spectra of pristine In2S3 and NiO/In2S3 films obtained at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm are presented in Fig. 3c. The emission from the photosensitizer, In2S3, alone was broad, and deconvolution gave two components, a strong one, centered at 564 nm, followed by a low intensity one at 617 nm. While the higher energy component is ascribed to band edge recombination, the lower energy one is assigned to radiative transitions between the intra-gap defect states. In the NiO/In2S3 film, the intensity of the band-edge emission of In2S3 was quenched by ∼63%. This is consistent with light-induced electron transfer from the VB of NiO to the VB of In2S3. This experiment shows the ability of In2S3 to act as a photosensitizer for NiO, leaving holes in NiO which diffuse to the current collector, e.g. FTO or C-fabric.
Photoelectrochemistry of the photocathode half-cell
An energy band diagram for the half-cell, shown in Fig. 3f, illustrates the mechanism in the device. The energy levels of the In2S3 were determined from cyclic voltammetry; the CV plots and the calculations are provided in ESI (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). The Mott–Schottky plot of In2S3 film on FTO, deposited by CBD for 2 h confirms the n-type nature of the absorber (Fig. S3, ESI†). The corresponding 1/(capacitance)2versus voltage profile yields a positive slope, consistent with data previously reported for β-In2S3 deposited by CBD.29 NiO is a p-type semiconductor with a high-lying VB, above that of In2S3.30 Upon excitation, the exciton which forms in the In2S3 can, therefore, extract an electron from the NiO valence band. The electron in the conduction band of In2S3 is transferred to the polysulfide redox mediator, and the reduced S2− species diffuses to the C-fabric counter electrode to complete the circuit.
The potential for the NiO/In2S3 film to serve as a photocathode in photoelectrochemical solar cells was confirmed by recording the current versus time transients for the NiO/In2S3-nS2−/Sn2−-C-fabric half-cell during on–off cycles of white light with an irradiance of 25 mW cm−2. Fig. 3d depicts that the NiO/In2S3-nS2−/Sn2−-C-fabric half-cell produces a reasonably stable photocurrent of 0.037 mA upon irradiation for 20 s intervals. In the dark, the current dropped steeply to nearly zero, and upon illumination, the same magnitude of photocurrent was reproduced, indicating the good photo-activity of this electrode.
The J–V characteristics of this half-cell (Fig. 3e) gave a PCE of 0.047% with a VOC of 182 mV, JSC of 0.84 mA cm−2 and FF of 30.53% under 1 sun irradiance. Although the NiO based half-cell delivers a much lower PCE compared to the PCE produced by typical TiO2 based half-cells (discussed in the next section), below we show that the synergy between the two components leads to a high PCE in the tandem cell, which exceeds the performance of the photocathode or photoanode when used alone. The ability of this half-cell to preferentially direct the photo-excited charge carriers to C-fabric, as opposed to competing unwanted recombination routes, was studied by EIS. Recombination resistance, Rrec is inversely proportional to the recombination rate and it is well established that Rrec in QDSCs reflects the interfacial charge recombination process. From the Nyquist plot, in the inset of Fig. 3e, the Rrec at the (NiO/In2S3)/(nS2−/Sn2−) interface was found to be 159 Ω. The Rrec value points to the probability of holes in the VB of both In2S3 and NiO recombining with reduced species in the electrolyte and surface trap state defects which hinders the performance of QDSC. From the Bode plot shown in ESI (Fig. S4†), the recombination lifetime was calculated using the equation τd = 1/2πf, where f is the middle frequency peak. Recombination time (τd) is defined as the time taken by the excited state electron vacancy in the NiO/In2S3 electrode to recombine with the reduced species in the polysulfide electrolyte. The electron–hole recombination time is calculated to be 1.5 ms in the NiO/In2S3-nS2−/Sn2−-C-fabric cell.31
Photoanode assembly and structural characterisation of the photoanode components
The photoanode comprises of TiO2, CdS, Au and MoO3; of these, while the structures of TiO2 and CdS have been reported in detail by us in the past,32 Au and MoO3 are investigated in detail here. XRD pattern of Au NPs (Fig. 4a) shows a sharp intense peak at 2θ = 38.19°, followed by multiple peaks at 44.39°, 64.58° and 77.57°, which are assigned to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of Au with a fcc lattice structure (JCPDS: 652870). The corresponding TEM images (Fig. 4b and c) show a uniform distribution of discrete NPs with distinctive grain boundaries, with particle size in the range of 5–10 nm. Since the dimensions of the particles are less than 50 nm, it is anticipated that when they are employed in the photoanode, plasmonic effects as opposed to scattering effects will dominate. Scattering generally dominates at NP dimensions in excess of 50 nm. Thus, the near electric field enhancement of Au NPs upon excitation of the surface plasmon is expected to increase the effective light absorption cross-section of the solar cell. MoO3, in the photoanode, functions as an additional hole transport layer, and as an electrochromic layer. The XRD pattern of MoO3 (Fig. 4d) contains a prominent broad hump at low 2θ, which indicates that the layer is largely amorphous, with few indistinct peaks at 23.33°, 25.70°, 27.33° and 38.57° matching to the (110), (040), (021) and (131) planes of orthorhombic MoO3 (JCPDS: 050508). The SEM image of the MoO3 layer shows a featureless undulating morphology (Fig. 4e), and the TEM image (Fig. 4f) shows mingling particles with no unique shapes, and having no clear boundaries. The SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 4f) reveals diffuse concentric rings, with very faint spots, re-affirming the amorphous nature of the MoO3 layer. The SEM image of the TiO2/CdS electrode (Fig. 4g) shows a network of interconnected particles separated by pores (the latter having sizes of the order of few tens of nm), typical of P25 TiO2, which is known to have a mesoscopic structure. Coating TiO2/CdS with Au NPs, and then by MoO3, led to some textural but unremarkable changes in the corresponding images (Fig. 4h and i).

Optical properties of the photoanode components
The absorbance and emission (recorded at λex = 370 nm) plots of the photoanode components: CdS, Au and MoO3 are shown in Fig. 5a–c. CdS QDs show a broad but featureless absorption extending from 310 to 460 nm, which tapers off at 540 nm and corresponds to a band gap of 2.29 eV (Fig. 5a). The CdS/glass film shows a highly intense emission peak above 470 nm with a λmax at 536 nm which is largely due to band edge recombination. Au NPs show a localized surface plasmonic absorption peak at 520 nm (Fig. 5b) which is close to the λmax of CdS QDs, and therefore when integrated with the photo-absorber, the metal nanoparticles further improve their light harvesting capability. The emission peak of Au NPs spans over a wavelength range of 400 to 500 nm, indicating that the high energy photons in the UV-region absorbed by Au NPs possibly induce electronic transitions from the Fermi level (EF) of Au, and the emission is brought about when they revert to the EF. MoO3 shows an intense absorption peak in the UV region (Fig. 5c), which corresponds to a band gap of 3.42 eV. MoO3 shows a strong emission peak with a λmax at 430 nm. Although MoO3 does not function as a photo-sensitizer, possibly due to fast recombination and poor electron injection efficiency, this observation shows it to be an emissive material. The inset of Fig. 5c depicts the absorption profile of pristine TiO2 and the absorption edge, which tapers off at the onset of the visible region, is consistent with the optical band gap for TiO2 of ∼3.16 eV.

The optical properties and charge transfer studies on the photoactive films: TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/Au and TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3, are presented in Fig. 5d and e. The absorption features of TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/Au and TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 films reveal the combined effects of TiO2 and CdS. All the three curves display a wide absorption band in the visible region over a wavelength range of 310–525 nm. Both TiO2/CdS/Au and TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 films show an additional absorption hump in the visible region, spanning 380 to 510 nm which can be attributed to the plasmonic effect of Au NPs, which causes a surge in the absorption by CdS QDs. When light impinges on an Au NP smaller than 50 nm (as is the case here), the electric field component of the radiation interacts with the conduction band electrons, and induces a redistribution of the electron density in the NP. A restoring force then sets in a series of oscillations that decays in about 10 fs, at the end of which the photons are re-radiated, where the strength of the field decays rapidly with distance within the photoanode (TiO2/CdS/Au). Thus, the vicinal semiconductor QDs, such as CdS here, undergo excitation by absorbing this energy, and show an enhanced absorption in the region of overlap with the SPR peak of the metal NP. Further, the inclusion of the MoO3 layer does not eclipse the SPR effect, for the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 film almost retraces the curve obtained for the TiO2/CdS/Au film, except for a slight increment above 500 nm and an amplified absorption over 300–370 nm which are due to the absorption trends of MoO3 in these wavelength regions.
The fluorescence spectra of TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/Au and TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 electrodes, recorded at a fixed excitation wavelength of 370 nm, are analogous to that of CdS over a wide wavelength range of 470–610 nm, with λmax centered around 540 nm (Fig. 5e). The emission intensity of CdS is quenched by ∼50% when the CdS QDs are anchored to titania in the TiO2/CdS electrode. The emission is quenched by a further 34% upon the incorporation of Au NPs. The TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 electrode retains about 39% of the emission intensity of TiO2/CdS assembly devoid of Au and MoO3. The quenching is consistent with a photoexcited electron cascade from the CB of CdS to the CB of TiO2 in the TiO2/CdS film or to the equilibrated Fermi level of the photoanode. Au and MoO3 significantly contribute to the quenching of the exciton emission by providing channels for unhindered electron and hole transport in the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 assembly, respectively, which could improve the photoelectrochemical performance of the solar cell.
Photoelectrochemistry of the photoanode half-cell
The energy level diagram shown in Fig. 5f shows the proposed mechanism for the combined photovoltaic and photoelectrochromic effects. Intrinsic and plasmonic electron–hole pairs are generated in CdS, upon illumination of the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 electrode. Some of the electrons are transferred to MoO3, which forms blue colored NaxMoO3 (eqn (1)). Meanwhile, the bulk of the excited electrons are injected into TiO2 and lead to the photocurrent response. Had this not been the case, the cell would have delivered a poor PCE. These electrons reach the CE via the external circuit, where they are consumed in the reduction of the Sn2− species in the electrolyte.
Optimization of the Au NP content on the TiO2/CdS electrode is of prime importance to exploit the plasmonic light trapping mechanism. Fig. 6a depicts the current density (J) versus voltage (V) curves for TiO2/CdS/Au photoanodes with varying Au NP content, measured under 1 sun irradiance (100 mW cm−2). The Au NP content was varied by adjusting the concentration of the Au stock solution in toluene, which was drop cast over the TiO2/CdS photoanode, and the effect on the solar cell parameters is summarized in Table 1. An optimum Au NP dilution factor of 1:13 delivered a maximum PCE value of 6.11% for a TiO2/CdS/Au-nS2−/Sn2−-C-fabric cell, with a better FF of 56.98% compared to other dilutions.

The photovoltaic parameters of the half-cells assembled with different photoanodes, TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/Au and TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3, and a bare C-fabric counter electrode are shown in Fig. 6b and the cell parameters are summarized in Table 2. Due to the localized SPR effects in the Au NPs, the CdS QDs in the vicinity pick up the localized optical energy, which augments the PCE. The TiO2/CdS based half-cells exhibited an increasing trend in PCE from 4.47% to 5.90% with the addition of Au NPs. This was increased further to 6.01% with the thin coating of MoO3 over the photoanode. While the JSC of the cells with Au and with both Au and MoO3 were almost equal, the VOC was higher with the MoO3 layer. MoO3 permits efficient hole transport, resulting in improved charge separation and hence increased VOC. This is ratified from EIS and chronopotentiometric studies.

The introduction of Au NPs and MoO3 thin film in the CdS sensitized photoanode reduced the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized Sn2− species in the electrolyte and this increased the VOC of the resultant QDSCs. Fig. 6c gives direct comparison of Nyquist plots between TiO2/CdS, TiO2/CdS/Au and TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 cells at a forward bias which corresponds to the VOC values of the three cells. The Rrec value at the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3-nS2−/Sn2− interface was 216 Ω which was notably higher than that of 172 Ω for TiO2/CdS/Au and nearly double the value of Rrec 115 Ω obtained for TiO2/CdS. The TiO2 film electrodes and redox electrolyte were identical for each device, so the direct electron loss at the metal oxide matrix with acceptor species in electrolyte between the concerned half-cells should remain unchanged. The disparity in the Rrec is ascribed to the suppression of the back electron transfer from TiO2 to the photosensitizer and/or from the photosensitizer to electrolyte. Au plasmons not only energize electron propagation but can also assist the coloration in the electrochromic MoO3 layer. The Bode plots of the cells (phase angle versus frequency) are shown in Fig. 6d. The phase angle peak located in the low frequency range shifted to a lower frequency, revealing an increase in the electron recombination time from 352 ms for the TiO2/CdS cell to 445 ms for the TiO2/CdS/Au cell with the polysulfide redox electrolyte where Au NPs contribute to rapid electron injection into FTO. The electron–hole recombination time increased to a maximum of 1318 ms in the presence of MoO3, which is consistent with faster hole scavenging from the QDs by MoO3 and, as a consequence, more efficient charge separation. These results are consistent with the trends in the photoluminescence of the electrodes.
The photocurrent versus time transients under illuminated (0.25 sun) and dark conditions, are shown in Fig. 6e. The highest photocurrent was delivered by the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 cell which was closely followed by the TiO2/CdS/Au cell. The photocurrent response of the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 cell dropped slightly from 0.7 to 0.66 mA during irradiance over 20 s. The TiO2/CdS cell maintained a stable value of ∼0.24 mA, which rose to 0.55 mA when Au NPs were incorporated. This improvement in the current response is consistent with the favourable plasmonic and light scattering effects. The photovoltage decay was monitored in the dark, after allowing the voltage to stabilize under light, and is shown in Fig. 6f. For the photovoltage to drop by the same extent, the cell based on the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 electrode took 2.48 s, whereas cells based on the TiO2/CdS and TiO2/CdS/Au electrodes took 0.64 and 1.23 s, respectively. The longer decay time is attributed to the MoO3 acting as hole-transport layer which is consistent with the higher VOC registered for the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 electrode based solar cell.
Characterisation of the gel electrolyte
The redox couple in the electrolyte serves to promote charge-separation by rapidly scavenging holes from the VB of CdS (i.e. the S2− undergoes oxidation at the photoanode) and electrons from the In2S3 CB (i.e. Sn2− is reduced at the photocathode), limiting recombination with the charge carriers in the NiO or TiO2 electrodes, respectively. The reactions are shown below.
Photoanode: S2− + 2h+ + Sn−12− → Sn2− (n = 2–5)(2)
Photocathode: Sn2− + 2e− → Sn−12− + S2−(3)
Silica was added to the polysulfide electrolyte to form a gel, which combines the stability of solid state electrolytes with high charge transport ability of a liquid electrolyte, resulting in a quasi-solid-state QDSC with promising photovoltaic performance. The gel avoids the limitations posed by a fully aqueous liquid electrolyte, such as leakage and evaporation of solvent (water) from the sandwiched solar cell with time.33 A comparison between the 1 M aqueous S2−/Sn2− liquid electrolyte and S2−/Sn2−-SiO2 gel electrolyte with respect to the reduction of Sn2− into S2−, was performed using cyclic voltammetry and the results are provided in Fig. S5 of the ESI.† A more pronounced reduction peak with a lower onset potential was observed for the gel electrolyte compared to liquid electrolyte. This is consistent with facile propagation of reaction (3) in the polysulfide gel electrolyte, despite the higher viscosity. The stability of the tandem cells with aqueous polysulfide gel and liquid electrolyte was compared under continuous 1 sun illumination for 6 hours. The plot is included in the ESI (Fig. S5†). The TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3-nS2−/Sn2− gel-In2S3/NiO/C-fabric cell exhibited a higher initial efficiency but also almost 3 times less degradation compared to the equivalent cell with liquid electrolyte at the end of 6 hours under irradiation. This stability is also due to the presence of SiO2 nanoparticles in the electrolyte which induce a passivating effect and restrict the photocorrosion of QDs.34
Photoelectrochemistry of tandem cells
QDSCs were constructed using the photoanode, TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 paired with two different photoactive cathodes: C-fabric/In2S3 and C-fabric/NiO/In2S3. The tandem devices were assembled with the aqueous polysulfide gel electrolyte and a para-film spacer. The schematic in the inset of Fig. 7a illustrates the device configuration. The cells were illuminated from the rear-side (i.e. through the transparent FTO glass). J–V plots, obtained under 1 sun irradiance (100 mW cm−2), are shown in Fig. 7a and the solar cell parameters are summarized in Tables 3 and S2.† The PCE for the tandem cell with a TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 photoanode was 6.79% with C-fabric/In2S3 counter electrode, and 7.99% with the C-fabric/NiO/In2S3 photocathode.

IPCE versus wavelength curves for each cell with different combinations of photoanodes and photocathodes are shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The independent contributions of CdS, Au, In2S3 and the photocathode: NiO/In2S3 to solar energy conversion can be observed from the trends in IPCE spectra. The maximum IPCE value attained for the TiO2/CdS-nS2−/Sn2−-C-fabric cell was ∼34% in the 400–450 nm wavelength range, and the photocurrent onset, near 600 nm, was consistent with the absorption onset of the CdS QDs (Fig. 5a). Higher IPCEs of 49% and 50% at 450 nm were observed for the TiO2/CdS/Au and TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 photoanodes with C-fabric CE, respectively. For these devices, a much broader spectral response was observed compared to the photoanodes without the Au NPs, with 4.5% IPCE at 700 nm, dropping to zero beyond 800 nm. This 15% enhancement in IPCE achieved over the breadth of the visible spectrum is consistent with the SPR effect proposed above. Higher IPCEs were observed for the tandem devices. TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 photoanode with C-fabric/In2S3 counter electrode achieved a maximum IPCE of 56% and that of the tandem cell with the same photoanode and C-fabric/NiO/In2S3 photocathode was increased further to 62%.
To examine the reason for the increase in performance of the tandem device containing the NiO layer between the photosensitizer and the C-fabric substrate, ac EIS was performed. The Nyquist plots of the tandem cell, TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3-nS2−/Sn2−-In2S3/NiO/C-fabric under the applied open-circuit potential, both in dark and under 1 sun illumination are shown in Fig. 7c. Two skewed semicircles are present, one at high frequencies with a relatively small diameter and an incomplete large arc in the mid- to low frequency range. The full cell has a greater Rrec value of 236 Ω in the dark compared to 135 Ω under simulated sunlight. Rrec is related to the recombination of charges at the metal oxide/electrolyte interface. This resistance is sensitive to surface processes and exhibits a strong light-dependence owing to the increase in density of charge carriers in the metal oxide on illumination compared to in the dark. On illumination, Rrec is smaller than for the cell in the dark because the recombination rate is higher due to the higher carrier concentration. Additionally, a local increase in temperature under sunlight may also enhance the charge transfer kinetics and strongly reduce the size of the arcs.35
Tandem devices with the In2S3 sensitized p-type NiO photocathode boosted all the solar cell parameters, the VOC, JSC and FF, compared to only the photosensitizer, In2S3 on the C-fabric substrate. The presence of NiO drives the separation of the electron and hole pair by providing a downhill pathway for the electrons from the NiO valence band to the vacancy in the In2S3 sensitizer (i.e. it is the opposite of the process occurring at the photoanode, where the electron in the CdS CB is transferred to the lower lying CB in the TiO2). This process overcomes the radiative recombination of the exciton (see photoluminescence experiment above) and enables the charges to be selectively extracted. Typically, charge-transfer at the interface between the QD and the metal oxide is much faster than charge-transfer to the redox electrolyte, which is diffusion limited. Accordingly, on illumination of the tandem cell, the Fermi level in the TiO2 rises towards the conduction band edge, the Fermi level in the NiO falls to the valence band edge, and the difference in potential energy at the photocathode and photoanode leads to the VOC (i.e. in a tandem cell, the VOC should be the sum of the VOC of the individual TiO2 and NiO-based half cells), and therefore the conversion efficiency is increased. The increase in VOC observed when NiO is introduced, is therefore attributed to the better charge-separation in the device compared to the device with only C-fabric/In2S3. The large charge-transfer resistance of the tandem device is consistent with the higher JSC and FF. Once the charges are transferred to the metal oxide, they are insulated from the redox mediator by the absorber layer, leading to long charge lifetimes.
Photoelectrochromism in a tandem cell
The presence of MoO3 in the photoanode of the tandem cell leads to a change in coloration upon illumination (photoelectrochromic effect) due to the formation of the sodium molybdenum bronze, as discussed above, in addition to delivering a high PCE (photovoltaic effect). Photographs of the as-fabricated tandem cell which is yellow in color, and the resulting blue colored tandem cell are shown in Fig. 7b and b′. To quantify the photoelectrochromic response, semi-transparent tandem cells were fabricated (TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3-nS2−/Sn2−-In2S3/NiO/FTO) by substituting the C-fabric current collector in the photocathode with FTO. Photographs of the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3-nS2−/Sn2−-In2S3/NiO/FTO tandem cell before (yellow) and after (blue) irradiation with white light (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 8c and c′, respectively. The maximum transmittance (Fig. 8a) of the photocathode NiO/In2S3 film on FTO was 59% over the visible region (400 to 800 nm). The transmittance of the as-fabricated photoanode TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 film gradually increased from 5% to 61% over the same wavelength range. The transmittance of the tandem cell in its colored state, provided in Fig. 8b, varied from 0.5% to 16% in the visible region. When the light was switched off, the charge stored in the electrochromic layer drove the process in reverse, triggering the film to bleach and giving a maximum transmittance of 50%, while retaining spectral shape. The modulation in transmittance (ΔT(λ) = Tbleached(λ) − Tcolored(λ)) was 29% at 550 nm, the wavelength at which the human eye is most responsive, and 34% at 800 nm (Fig. 8b). The electrochromic contrast induced in the MoO3 layer depends on the electronic charge that flows into the film upon illumination. The photocoloration efficiency (phCE) is the relationship between the modulation of the optical density (ΔOD) and the solar energy density absorbed by the QDs-sensitized plasmonic photoanode to initiate the color transition in MoO3.36 For this chromogenic device, the phCE was estimated using eqn (4): phCE = ΔOD(λ)/GTt = log[Tb(λ)/Tc(λ)]/GTt(4)where GT is the total solar intensity for incidence normal to the device (in W cm−2), and t is the exposure time (in minutes). The magnitudes of Tb and Tc corresponding to the optical transmittance in the bleached and colored states are 33.7 and 5.1% respectively (at λ = 550 nm). A photocoloration efficiency of 16.4 cm2 min−1 W−1 at a wavelength of 550 nm was obtained under exposure to AM1.5 white light, 100 mW cm−2 intensity, for 30 seconds.

The CIE-1931 color chromaticity parameters L*, a, b for colored and bleached films were estimated at 2° observer using D-65 illumination source. The generated chromaticity diagram for the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 photoanode in the tandem device is as shown in Fig. 8d. The values of L*, a and b parameters for the bleached state of the MoO3 layer were 53.9, 4.4 and −8.7, respectively. These parameters changed to 74.7, 6.4 and −19.6 after illumination, which clearly indicates an enhancement in blue coloration.37 The electrocatalytic effect of Au is seen in the noticeable electrochromism of the MoO3 film in the solar cell.38 A PCE of 3.11% with a JSC of 11.4 mA cm−2 was recorded for the tandem QDSC assembled with the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 photoanode, polysulfide gel electrolyte and NiO/In2S3 over FTO glass substrate photocathode (Fig. 8e), which was somewhat lower than the photocurrent obtained for the device with the highly conductive C-fabric as the photocathode substrate. However, it was sufficient to induce the desired electrochromic switching.
Conclusions
Coupling of a TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 photoanode with a C-fabric/NiO/In2S3 photocathode maximized the light absorption range afforded by CdS–Au NPs on one side and In2S3 on the other. The PCEs achieved were 6.01% for the TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3 photoanode based half-cell, 0.047% for the NiO/In2S3 photocathode based half-cell and 7.99% for the tandem QDSC, TiO2/CdS/Au/MoO3-nS2−/Sn2−-In2S3/NiO/C-fabric measured under a light intensity of 1 sun. The latter is one of the best solar cell efficiencies reported to date for tandem QDSCs. In addition, device also exhibits electro-optical switching and the MoO3 layer in the photoanode plays a dual role, serving both as a hole conduit as well as an electrochrome. The maximum light-induced modulation of the transmission was 34% upon chromatic switching between the bleached state and blue-colored state induced in MoO3 film, for the tandem device with optically transparent current collectors (FTO glass). This work demonstrates the improvements in solar cell efficiency which can be made through the tandem cell architecture and opens up new avenues for research by incorporating nanomaterials with multiple functions in the photoelectrochemical solar cells. Because of the modular system, there remains much scope for optimising the synergy between the photoactive electrodes to capture and convert more of the solar spectrum more efficiently.
