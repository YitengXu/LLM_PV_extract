    , Accepted 15th October 2021First published on 1st November 2021AbstractTwo intermediate-sized acceptor–π–porphyrin–π–acceptor-type molecules MPor1 and MPor2 with panchromatic absorption profiles have been developed towards improving photovoltaic performance. The conjugation of terthiophenyl-benzodithiophene to the porphyrin center successfully fills the absorption gap between the Soret and Q bands of the conventional porphyrin molecules and leads to narrow optical bandgaps within 1.58–1.60 eV. The two molecules possess excellent light-harvesting property within the UV-visible-near-infrared region, and efficient hole-electron separation in the bulk heterojunction layer with PC71BM as the acceptor. Conventional solar cells based on the MPor1/PC71BM active layer shows an optimal performance with a power conversion efficiency of 8.59% and a short circle current of 14.91 mA cm−2.
1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors have been demonstrated very promising in future photovoltaic technology towards sustainable energy supply.1–7 Their tuneable spectral and electronic properties lead to diversified electron donors, which can be used to construct a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer with a variety of electron acceptors for flexible thin-film organic solar cells (OSCs).8 It is well known that BHJ OSCs typically employ [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor component. Such a device requires a narrow bandgap electron donor with intense and broad spectral absorption, capable of efficient light-harvesting for high photo-generated current. Nowadays, benzodithiophene (BDT) and terthiophene derivatives have been widely employed to construct a variety of small-molecule electron donors with narrow bandgaps.9–12 When using them as the donor component of an active layer, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) about 10–15% have been achieved for BHJ OSCs.13
Acceptor–π–porphyrin–π–acceptor (A–π–Por–π–A)-type small molecules are distinguished by their intensive spectral absorption of the Soret and Q bands but very weak absorption between the Soret and Q bands. Their crystallinity can be simply tuned by using ethylrhodanine or 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine as the acceptor moiety.14 Using them as small-molecule electron donors in line with PC61BM or PC71BM as the electron acceptor, the conventional BHJ OSCs and ternary BHJ OSCs reached promising PCEs of up to 9% and 12%, respectively.15–20 Therefore, a lot of efforts have been devoted to enhance the absorption spectrum of A–π–Por–π–A-type small molecules between the Soret and Q-bands, but progress is still slow.20–22 Recently, we introduced the BDT moiety as π-bridges in a new A–π–Por–π–A-type porphyrin donor, which strengthens its green light absorption rather than its panchromatic absorption, and subsequently obtained BHJ OSCs with a PCE of 7.92%.14 On the other hand, intermediate-sized narrow bandgap conjugated molecules23 have a recognizable combination of advantages over small molecules and polymer donors. Their high purity and film-forming capability, as well as variant molecular conformations and excitations, are believed to strengthen their spectral absorption and enhance their light-harvesting capability, ultimately producing high electron current in BHJ OSC applications.24,25 However, the design of intermediate-sized molecules with panchromatic absorption is still lacking for A–π–Por–π–A-type molecules, especially for their BDT conjugated analogues. In view of this, we synthesized two intermediate-sized terthiophenyl-BDT conjugated A–π–Por–π–A-type molecules, namely MPor1 and MPor2 (Fig. 1). The two porphyrin molecules are very promising for panchromatic BHJ OSCs for their broad absorption profiles in UV-visible-near-infrared region. When using them as electron donors in line with PC71BM, the highest PCE of 8.59% was achieved.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and preparation of blend films
The target molecules, MPor1 and MPor2, were prepared via a piperidine-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation reaction in the last step, as depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The synthesis details and structural characterization of MPor1, MPor2 and the intermediates are available in the ESI.† The blend film samples for the study of their photophysical properties were spin-coated from a solution of MPor1 or MPor2:PC71BM at a optimal weight ratio of 1:1.2 with an overall concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene, which is consistent with the preparation method for active layers in BHJ OSCs (vide infra). The MPor1 and MPor2:PC71BM films spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s were denoted as Blend1 and Blend2, respectively. The two films after thermal annealing (TA) at 100 °C for 5 min were labeled as TA Blend1 and TA Blend2, respectively, and further solvent vapor annealing (SVA) in a glass Petri dish containing 4.0 mL dichloromethane for 20 s afforded the films labeled as SVA + TA Blend1 and SVA + TA Blend2, respectively.
Among these films, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of MPor1 and MPor2 were estimated to be −5.24/−3.65 eV and −5.27/−3.66 eV, respectively, according to their onset values of redox potentials of 0.5/−1.09 V and 0.53/−1.08 V, respectively, obtained from cyclic voltammetry measurements (Fig. S5, ESI†). The small bandgaps of 1.59 eV and 1.61 eV for MPor1 and MPor2, respectively, are consistent with their panchromatic absorption to the near infrared region. In addition, the energy levels of the molecular orbitals for MPor1 and MPor2 also match the HOMO and LUMO of the PC71BM acceptor, and could therefore form rational alignment of the energy levels of the donor/acceptor BHJ structures, which is critical for the separation and transfer of photo-generated hole-electron pairs.
Their spectral properties were further studied by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 2a and b), showing good light-harvesting capabilities with intense absorption in the range of 400–800 nm. This absorption range is characteristic for MPor1 and MPor2, which has been confirmed by the individual UV-vis spectra of the MPor1 and MPor2 films (Fig. 2c and Table 1). The two intense absorption peaks around 480 nm and 730 nm can be attributed to the Soret and Q bands, respectively. Two moderate absorption peaks at 542–550 nm and 670–673 nm for the MPor1 and MPor2 films emerged, and were complementary to the absorption of the Soret and Q bands, according to the Gouterman Four-Orbital Model.26 The optical bandgaps of MPor1 and MPor2 were calculated to be 1.58 eV and 1.60 eV, respectively, by the equation Eg = 1240/λ eV with their absorbing edges. These values present the excellent light-harvesting capabilities of Blend1 and Blend2 for photovoltaic applications. On the other hand, Blend1 and Blend2 also had different spectral responses to the post-treatments. As shown in the UV-vis spectra of Blend1, TA Blend1 and SVA + TA Blend1, Blend1 exhibited increased intensity of Q band absorption when treated by thermal and solvent vapor annealing. However, Blend2 showed fixed intensities for all post-treatments. This difference may indicate the better self-healing capability of MPor1 compared to MPor2, which may have effects on their photovoltaic performance and may mean that post-treatments are necessary for device optimization.

2.2 Study of spectral and photophysical properties
Molecular and spectral simulations by density functional theory (DFT) have been widely adopted to answer experimental phenomena. Previous theoretical calculations of porphyrin derivatives have agreed well with the experimental data.27,28 The molecular geometry was optimized by Gaussian D.0129 at the B3LYP/GENECP (Zn with Lanl2dz basis set and C, H, N, O and S with 6-31G(d) basic set) level, showing that both the MPor1 and MPor2 molecules assume a twisted backbone conformation (Fig. 1 (down)). MPor1 shows a total twisting angle of 75° with different dihedral angles of 26°, 19° and 30° along with the molecular backbone, while MPor2 exhibits a total twisting angle of 75° with different dihedral angles of 26°, 21° and 30°. Such asymmetrical twisted conformations may break the structural and electronic symmetries of the pristine porphyrin structure, which obeyed the “four orbital theory”.30 The simulated spectra of MPor1 and MPor2 were calculated using the time-dependent DFT method at the same level, since previous studies have shown this simulation kept the main absorption characteristics with only slightly overestimated wavelengths.31 Similarly, both the MPor1 and MPor2 exhibit multiple absorption peaks at 511/521 nm, 598/621 nm, 679/697 nm and 768/811 nm (Fig. 2(d)), which highly supports the experimental spectra of MPor1, MPor2 and their blends with PC71BM. If the optical gap is defined as the energetically lowest allowed vertical electronic excitation, the main contributions to the first excitation, oscillator strengths and the wavelength of the first excitation are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). The molecular orbits corresponding to those excited states are shown in Fig. 3. The Soret absorption peaks of MPor1 and MPor2 around 480 nm are mainly attributed to their excitations of HOMO → LUMO+4. The Q band absorption peaks of MPor1 and MPor2 at 768 nm and 811 nm are mainly due to the transitions of HOMOs → LUMOs. In addition, the two absorption peaks at 621 nm and 679 nm (marked as 1 and 2 in Fig. 2(d)) for both MPor1 and MPor2 are mainly attributed to their excitations of HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 and HOMO → LUMO+1, respectively. Obviously these excitations are distributed on the different segments of the twisted main-chain, which supports the theoretical expectation and the experimental spectral characteristics.

The lifetime decay curves and data of the films (MPor1, MPor2, TA Blend1, SVA + TA Blend1, TA Blend2 and SVA + TA Blend2) are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The decay curves of the films were well fitted with the multi-exponential model I(t) = A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2 + A3e−t/τ3. The lifetime τ is contributed by three different processes: the non-radiative process (τ1), the radiative process (τ2) that is directly related to the recombination of electrons and holes, and the energy transfer process (τ3). Intermolecular energy transfer (τ3) could be found in the lifetime of the TA or TA–SVA blend films when PC71BM was added. The average lifetimes of MPor1 and MPor2 are 109.94 ps and 105.81 ps, respectively. With the addition of PC71BM and thermal annealing, the average lifetime of TA Blend1 are shortened to 40.85 ps (τ1: 20 ps, 0.03%, τ2: 23 ps, 91.37%, τ3: 230.7 ps, 8.6%). The result indicates the quenching of fluorescence due to the intermolecular electron transfer process between the electron donor and acceptor in TA Blend1. Similarly, SVA + TA Blend1 exhibits a shorter average lifetime of 37.66 ps (τ1: 21.87 ps, 90.19%, τ2: 171.0 ps, 8.36%, τ3: 250.6 ps, 1.45%), enabling a higher intermolecular electron transfer efficiency than the MPor1 and Blend1 films. By contrast, SVA + TA Blend2 and TA Blend2 exhibit a shorter average lifetime of 143.18 ps (τ1: 52.66 ps, 74.22%, τ2: 284.4 ps, 25.41%, τ3: 8596.6 ps, 0.37%) and 197.09 ps (τ1: 20 ps, 0.02%, τ2: 122.1 ps, 76.81%, τ3: 445.6 ps, 23.17%), respectively. The lifetimes from Blend2 are longer than those from Blend1 under the same post-treatment, which confirms a relatively slow separation process of hole-electron pairs for MPor2/PC71BM BHJ blends.

2.3 Photovoltaic performance
Solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated utilizing MPor1 or MPor2 as the electron donor and PC71BM as the electron acceptor with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The device performance was measured under a simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 to explore its potential photovoltaic applications. The details of the device fabrication and characterization are provided in the ESI.† The active layers were prepared by the same procedures as Blend1 and Blend2. The film thicknesses are approximately 90 nm. Similarly, thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min was applied to the active layers of TA Blend1 and TA Blend2, and continuous solvent vapor annealing using DCM for 20 s was used to optimize the morphologies of the active layers of SVA + TA Blend1 and SVA + TA Blend2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are shown in Fig. 5, and the photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 3. The solution-processed BHJ OSCs using a pristine film of MPor1/PC71BM (Blend1) as the active layer exhibits a PCE of 3.59%, a JSC of 8.83 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.94 V, and a FF of 43.10%. After annealing, the solution-processed BHJ OSCs using TA Blend1 as the active layer exhibits a higher PCE of 5.58%, a JSC of 13.26 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.894 V and a FF of 47.1%. Further with a solvent vapor annealing (SVA) process to the active layer, an improved PCE of 8.59% with a VOC of 0.866 V, a FF of 66.5% and a JSC of 14.91 mA cm−2 was achieved. In contrast, the device based on pristine Blend2 shows a PCE of 3.87%, a VOC of 0.874 V, a JSC of 7.36 mA cm−2 and a FF of 60.2%. In the case of TA-annealing, the device showed an improved PCE of 6.91%, a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 12.27 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.5%. Further with a SVA treatment, the device presented a slight drop in PCE to 5.70%, with a VOC of 0.841 V, a JSC of 10.36 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.4%. The optimal PCE of 8.59% for MPor1 is comparable to the highest PCE of BHJ OSCs based on porphyrin donors.

The spectral effects of MPor1 and MPor2 on their photovoltaic behaviours were revealed in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the above optimal devices. As depicted in Fig. 5(c and d), those optimal devices show a wide range of photocurrent generation from 300 to 800 nm, corresponding to the panchromatic absorption (400–800 nm). The SVA + TA Blend1, TA Blend1 and pristine Blend1 exhibit an EQE value of 78.0%, 71.8% and 51.2%, respectively, at around 480 nm corresponding to the strong Soret absorption of MPor1. In addition, a rapid increase of EQE from 51.4% to 66.2% was observed for TA Blend1 and SVA + TABlend1 at around 730 nm, which is consistent with the enhanced Q band absorption of MPor1 in the blend films (Fig. 2(a)). In contrast, SVA + TA, TA and neat Blend2 exhibit an EQE value of 59.9%, 51.9% and 49.6%, respectively, at around 460 nm, indicating the negligible benefit of the post-treatments.
2.4 Morphological study
The micromorphology of the MPor1, MPor2 and the blended films were studied, and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns were obtained at the BL16B1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) to explore the crystallinity and orientation of the crystallites of MPor1 and MPor2 in neat and pyridine-added blended films with PC71BM. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns and the in-plane and out-of-plane X-ray scattering profiles extracted from the 2D GIWAXD images are shown in Fig. 6(a and d). In neat films, MPor1 shows a disorder due to the halo of the (100) diffraction peak at qz = 3.53 nm−1 (1.78 nm), indicating low crystallinity and an irregular molecular orientation containing “edge-on” and “face-on” configurations, which supported the expected film-forming capability from intermediate-sized molecules. In contrast, MPor2 shows a pronounced (100) diffraction peak centered at 3.71 nm−1 (1.69 nm) and a (200) diffraction peak at 7.42 nm−1 (0.85 nm) in the out-of-plane direction, accompanied by a π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak at 17.86 nm−1 (0.35 nm) in the in-plane direction, indicating that a highly-ordered “edge-on” configuration and large crystal grains existed in the neat MPor2 film. Keeping in mind that MPor1 and MPor2 have highly similar molecular structures, the apparent difference in the crystallinity could be due to the respective end-capping groups of ethylrhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethyl-rhodanine. In addition, the TA-treated blended films of MPor1/PC71BM (TA Blend1) show a pronounced “edge-on” orientation with a (100) diffraction peak at 3.63 nm−1 (1.73 nm) and a (200) diffraction peak at 6.94 nm−1 (0.91 nm) in the out-of-plane direction, accompanied by a broad and random π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak [(qxy = 17.4 nm−1 (0.36 nm))] and another diffraction peak arising from PC71BM (qz = 13.66 nm−1). These halos indicated that the crystallinity of MPor1/PC71BM is higher than the neat MPor1 film after thermal annealing, which should improve the exciton diffusion and charge transfer in the active layer of OSCs. In addition, the continuous TA and SVA-treated MPor1/PC71BM (SVA + TA Blend1) shows a greater crystallinity and molecular reorientation. As shown in Fig. 6b–e and Table 3, Table S4 (ESI†), the narrower full width at half maxima (FWHM) from 0.51 (CL, 11.46 nm) to 0.49 (CL, 11.93 nm) and the shift in the (100) diffraction peak from 3.66 nm−1 (d-spacing, 1.72 nm) to 3.69 nm−1 (d-spacing, 1.70 nm) indicate an enhanced molecular stacking and more ordered assembly after SVA. It explains the higher PCE (8.59%) of the OSCs with an improved ISC of 14.91 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.5%. In contrast, the thermally-annealed blended film of MPor2/PC71BM (TA Blend2) shows a highly-preferred “edge-on” configuration with a sharp (100) diffraction peak at 3.74 nm−1 (1.68 nm), a sharp (200) diffraction peak at 7.42 nm−1 (0.85 nm) in the out-of-plane direction and a π–π staking (010) reflection at 17.5 nm−1 (0.36 nm) in the in-plane direction. It also shows a random diffraction peak arising from PC71BM centered at qz = 13.76 nm−1 (0.46 nm). However, SVA + TA Blend2 does not exhibit an obvious change in micromorphology after continuous SVA treatment, which supports its inferior photovoltaic performance.

3. Conclusions
Two intermediate-sized terthiophenyl-benzodithiophene conjugated porphyrin donors with an acceptor–π–porphyrin–π–acceptor-type structural configuration were synthesized with a typical twisted backbone conformation. Theoretical and experimental studies show that these molecules not only have panchromatic absorption capability but also have different self-assembly responses to the post-treatments of thermal and solvent vapor annealing. Importantly, the ethylrhodanine end-capped molecule MPor1 exhibits a stronger film-forming capability and self-healing than the molecule end-capped by 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethyl-rhodanine, thus leading to a better hole-electron separation and a higher photo-generated current when applied in conjugation with the PC71BM acceptor (MPor1/PC71BM). Accordingly, the conventional BHJ OSCs employing MPor1/PC71BM as the active layer exhibits an optimized PCE of 8.59% with a JSC of 14.91 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.866 V and a FF of 66.5%. The results indicate that medium-sized acceptor–π–porphyrin–π-acceptor-type porphyrin molecules are a promising class of electron donors to achieve a panchromatic light-harvesting for highly efficient OSCs.
