    , Accepted 1st February 2017First published on 8th February 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic lead halide perovskites represent a group of materials with diverse structures and promising optical/optoelectronic properties. The performance of perovskite based solar cells relies tremendously on the structure/properties of the absorber. The physicochemical properties of the perovskite active layer depend on the substrate, preparation methods, environments and the starting materials. In this study, we investigated the effects of starting materials in the precursor solution on the physicochemical properties of the resulting one-step spin coated MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry film and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding inverted (p–i–n) perovskite solar cells. Two precursor solutions containing exactly the same atom stoichiometry were prepared from two different groups of starting materials (Group A: CH3NH3I, CH(NH2)2I, CH3NH3Br, and PbI2; Group B: CH3NH3I, CH(NH2)2I, PbI2 and PbBr2). The MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films (A1 and A2) prepared from the A precursor solution had better photovoltaic performances compared to those (B1 and B2) obtained from the B precursor solution for the same y values. The stoichiometry of the film to achieve the best photovoltaic performance (the corresponding cell has the highest efficiency) is not the same for the A-group (prepared from the A precursor solution) and B-group films (prepared from the B precursor solution). The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite film is directly correlated to the crystallinity, morphology and defect sites of the film as evidenced by GIXRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transient photoluminescence (TRPL) data. The morphology of the mixed-halide perovskite films depends on the homogeneity of the halide stoichiometries. The A-group films with more possible halide stoichiometries have better crystallinity and continuity compared to those of the B-group films, probably due to the difference in the crystallization rates for the two group perovskite films. Therefore, for preparing mixed-halide perovskites with the same average halide stoichiometry, starting materials that can produce perovskite films with more halide stoichiometries are a better choice.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaic devices (PSC) based on the family of inorganic halometallate perovskites have recently emerged as the leading third generation low-cost photovoltaic technology.1 This is primarily due to the high conversion efficiency, available materials and inexpensive solution process since simple, inexpensive production methods and starting materials are the keys to making PV cells a widespread technology. Nevertheless, the lattice parameters (even with the same chemical components or structure) and the physicochemical properties of the halometallate perovskites depend on the preparation methods.2 Therefore, there are several different materials and methodologies used to prepare perovskite films for low cost, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.3–19 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC improved rapidly, leaping from 3.8% in 200920 to the current world record of 22.1%.21
Organic–inorganic perovskites are members of the halometallate family with the general formula of ABX3, and A is an organic cation. The most commonly used organic cation is methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+) and formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2+) (the metal center (B) is a divalent ion of lead (Pb2+) or tin (Sn2+), and X is the halogen).22–28 Compared to the established model compound MAPbI3, the large cation FA in the perovskite lattice influences the metal–halide–metal bond angle, leading to a narrower band-gap relative to MAPbI3.29 Therefore, the band-gap energy of FAPbI3 is closer to the optimum value for a single junction solar cell derived from the Shockley–Queisser limit, which in turn leads to potentially higher theoretical efficiencies.30–32 However, the polymorph of the non-perovskite δ-phase that exists in FAPbI3 has restricted its application in PSCs.33,34 Recently, Zhao et al. found a 2D to 3D conversion method to prepare a pure α phase.35 On the other hand, Seok34et al. found that the compositional engineering of FAPbI3 by MAPbBr3 was a solution to the polymorph problem. The function of Br is to suppress the formation of the yellow FAPbI3 δ-phase at low temperatures. Furthermore, replacing I with Br widens the band-gap of the perovskite to increase the Voc of the corresponding cell, although the Jsc is sacrificed.36–40 It appears that mixed-cation, mixed-halide perovskite films with the compositions of MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry will have good photovoltaic performances (in terms of efficiency and stability), but the best x and y values may depend on the cell architecture, starting materials for the perovskite films, morphology of the active film, electron and hole transporting layers and the interphases between each layer.
The initial study using MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry as an absorber in a regular (n–i–p) perovskite solar cell was performed by Jeon et al.34 They prepared (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x films with various stoichiometries and found that when x equals 0.15, the film has the best photovoltaic performance. Following that, several groups1,41–45 used (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x as an active film to assemble perovskite solar cells, and a PCE of 20.8% with a very high Voc of 1.14 V is achieved when x is equal to 0.15.1 Those studies1,41–44 were all based on a n–i–p cell architecture using dense or mesoporous TiO2 film as the electron transporting layer. On the other hand, the inverted (p–i–n) perovskite cell based on the (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x active layer is less studied. Recently, Jen46et al. reported an inverted perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 17.34% based on the cell structure of Glass/ITO/CuNiOx/MAxFA1−xPb(IyBr1−y)3/PC61BM + C60/Bis-C60/Ag. They used MAI, FAI, PbI2 and PbBr2 as the starting materials. These materials were dissolved in a mixed solvent of dimethylsulfoxide and γ-butyrolactone (volume ratio of 3:7) as the precursor solution. The active MAxFA1−xPb(IyBr1−y)3 films were prepared by a one-step spin-coating combined with the toluene anti-solvent washing method. When x was 0.7 and y was 0.9, the corresponding inverted cell had the highest PCE. These studies44,46 showed that the optimal stoichiometries of (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x for the n–i–p and p–i–n cells are not the same. This may be due to the difference in the band matching between the electron transporting layer, the active perovskite film and the hole transporting layer, or, more probably, the morphology of the active film depends on the starting materials, the homogeneity of the compositions and the surface property of the substrate. Nevertheless, perovskite solar cells based on (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x films can achieve high efficiency and good stability.34
In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of the starting materials on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry films prepared with one-step spin-coating combined with anti-solvent washing. Compared to Cu doped NiO used by Jen46et al., we used PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid)) as a hole transporting material because of its good conductivity, solution processability, and reproducible properties.47,48 Furthermore, a p–i–n perovskite solar cell based on the PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layer has achieved a high PCE.49–53 The components in the perovskite precursor solution have a significant effect on the morphology of the resulting spin-coated film. We found that the quality of the mixed halide perovskite film is better when more stoichiometries of the halides can coexist in the film, which may slow down the crystallization rate, resulting in a better quality film.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and physicochemical studies
An aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS (1.6 wt%, from H.C. Stark Baytron P, AI 4083) was obtained from Heraeus Co. Fullerene C60 was purchased from Solenne B. V., Netherlands. PbI2, PbBr2 (99.99%), CH(NH2)2CH3COO, HI(aq.), HBr(aq.) and BCP (2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) were purchased from Aldrich Co. All materials were used as received except when specified. ITO-covered glass substrates were purchased from Ruilong Optoelectronic Co., Taiwan with photolithographic patterns designed by us. CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br and CH(NH2)2I were synthesized from CH3NH2(aq.), CH(NH2)2CH3COO, HI(aq.) and HBr(aq.) with methods similar to those reported in the literature.34,42 GIXRD data were collected in the 2θ range 5°–70° on a Bruker powder diffractometer (D8 Discover) using Cu Kα1 radiation equipped with a 2D detector. The band gaps and Urbach energies of the perovskite films were obtained from their UV/Vis absorption spectra, which were recorded with a Hitachi U-4100 spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a Hitachi S-800 microscope at 10 kV. Samples for the SEM study were mounted on a metal stub with a piece of conducting tape and then coated with a thin layer of platinum film to avoid charging. The thickness of the films was measured from the cross-section SEM images. Nanosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra were conducted using the time correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique (UniRAM, Protrustech) along with the instrument response function of a 150 ps pulse duration and repetition rate of 20 MHz. The excitation wavelength was 405 nm. To prevent laser-induced thermal effects, the diameter of the spot size on the sample was increased to 50 μm, and the excitation power was reduced to 0.1 mW. The spectra were taken with the perovskite film deposited on glass to eliminate the effects from the PEDOT:PSS hole transporter.
2.2. Preparation of the perovskite precursor solutions
The MAPbI3 precursor solution (1.0 M) was prepared by adding equal moles of MAI and PbI2 to the anhydrous γ-butyrolactone (GBL)/dimethylsulfoxide mixture (DMSO) mixed solvent (volume ratio: 1:1). The MA1−xFAxPbI3 precursor solutions were made by replacing various amounts (0.1 mole, 0.2 mole, 0.3 mole and 0.4 mole, respectively) of MAI with FAI in the 1.0 M precursor solution. MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry precursor solutions (without PbBr2) were formed when various amounts (0.15 mole, 0.3 mole and 0.45 mole, respectively) of MAI were replaced with MABr. The concentration (1.0 M) of all precursor solutions was the same. The precursor solutions composed of PbI2, PbBr2, MAI and FAI (as used by Jen46et al.) in the GBL/DMSO (v/v: 1/1) mixed solvent with the exact same atomic stoichiometries as those using MAI, FAI, MABr and PbI2 as the starting materials were also prepared to study the effect of the starting materials on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting spin-coated films.
2.3 Fabrication of the p–i–n (inverted) perovskite solar cells and the photovoltaic parameter measurement
PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of cleaned, preheated ITO/glass at 5000 rpm for 30 s to form a hole-transporting layer (HTL) from its aqueous solution (1.6 wt%, AI 4083). After thermal annealing at 140 °C for 10 min in air, in a glove box, the perovskite layer was deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS film using one-step spin-coating combined with the anti-solvent washing method (1000 rpm for 10 s, 5000 rpm for 15 s, and in the last 5 s, toluene (100 μl) was dropped on the film) to form a densely packed, fully-covered perovskite film. The perovskite film was thermal annealed (two-step) at 60 °C for 30 s, 100 °C for 30 s, and then 50 nm C60, 5 nm BCP and 100 nm Ag films were sequentially deposited on the perovskite to be the electron transporting layer (ETL), buffer layer and cathode electrode, respectively, using a high-vacuum thermal evaporator. The cells have an architecture of Glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry/C60/BCP/Ag with an active area of 0.2 cm × 0.5 cm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit under a simulated AM 1.5G sun light at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a mask on the cell. The intensity of the simulated sunlight was calibrated using an NREL-certified Si solar cell (Oriel, 91150 V) with a KG-5 band pass color filter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) or incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air after sealing the device with a silica sealant and measuring immediately. A chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for the phase sensitive detection with the QE-R3011 measurement system (Enlitech Inc., Taiwan). The determination of the photovoltaic parameters and calibration of all the measuring facilities were the same as that reported previously.50
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Photovoltaic performance of MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry films
To approach the more complicated components of MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry, the effect of the partial replacement of MA by FA in MAPbI3 was studied first. The photovoltaic parameters of the inverted cells based on the MA1−xFAxPbI3 films are listed in Table 1, and the original I–V curves were collected in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The data in Table 1 show that the cell based on the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 (where x equals 0.2) film has the highest efficiency. Grätzel30 and Han54 reported that the best photovoltaic performance of the mixed-cation lead iodide perovskite film is MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 for both groups, even though the cell architectures for them are different (n–i–p regular and p–i–n inverted cells, respectively, for Grätzel's30 and Han's54 studies). Nevertheless, Jen46 showed that MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 has the highest efficiency amongst the MA1−xFAxPbI3 films for inverted cells based on the Cu doped NiO hole transporting layer. The stoichiometry of MA1−xFAxPbI3 for the highest efficiency cell was different according to Jen,46 Han54 and our group even though everyone used the same cell architecture and starting materials for the perovskite precursor solutions. The results reveal that the detailed perovskite structure and morphology are not exactly the same when the cell fabrication is carried out in different laboratories (or on different substrates). It is very important to find the right starting materials and processes to produce good-quality perovskite films with highly reproducible properties.

The starting materials for synthesizing MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry films have more choices compared to those for preparing the MA1−xFAxPbI3 films. Two groups of starting materials: A (MAI, FAI, MABr, and PbI2) and B (MAI, FAI, PbI2 and PbBr2) containing the most commonly used compounds without any side products, were chosen for this study. The data listed in Table 1 evidenced that MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 has the best photovoltaic performance among the other stoichiometries (with mixed organic cation) we tested in this study; therefore, the mole ratio of MA/FA was fixed at 0.8/0.2 for preparing the MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry films. The detailed photovoltaic parameters for the highest and average efficiency cells based on the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films with various Br contents (prepared from the A and B group starting materials) are summarized in Table 2, and the I–V characteristics of the highest efficiency cells for each stoichiometry are displayed in Fig. S2, ESI.† This shows that the best photovoltaic performance film was MA0.8FA0.2PbI2.85Br0.15 (y = 0.15) when group A starting materials were used, while the cell based on the MA0.8FA0.2PbI2.7Br0.30 (y = 0.3) film prepared from group B starting materials had the highest efficiency. Furthermore, for the same stoichiometry, cell based mixed-cation, mixed-halide films prepared from the A group starting materials have higher efficiencies than those using the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry active films prepared from the B precursor solution. The results revealed the importance of the starting materials on the quality of the perovskite films because even the solvents and the atomic stoichiometry of the components in both precursor solutions were the same. Addressing the chemical reactions that occur in the precursor solution, the intermediates of the film right after the spin-coating, the interactions between the perovskite film and the substrate, and the compatibility at the interphases are complicated. In this study, we only focused on the starting material-related physicochemical properties and photovoltaic performance of four mixed-cation, mixed halide perovskite films: MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry (MA0.8FA0.2PbI2.85Br0.15) (A1): the best performance film prepared from A precursor solution, MA0.8FA0.2PbI2.7Br0.30 (B2): the best performance film prepared from B precursor solution, MA0.8FA0.2PbI2.7Br0.30 (A2): the same stoichiometry as B2 and MA0.8FA0.2PbI2.85Br0.15 (B1): the same stoichiometry as A1.

3.2 The structure and crystallinity of MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 and MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films prepared from A and B precursor solutions
The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 and four mixed-cation, mixed halide perovskite films deposited on PEDOT:PSS/ITO were illustrated in Fig. 1. The existence29,54 of δ-FAPbI3 and PbI2 in the FAPbI3 film leads to degradation in the PCE of the corresponding cell. The formations of δ-FAPbI3 can be eliminated by replacing some FA ions with MA ions. In other words, when the content of FA in MA1−xFAxPbI3 is higher than a certain value (depending on the preparation method and starting materials), the δ-FAPbI3 phase (bad photovoltaic performance material) will appear. As can be observed from the data shown in Fig. 1, MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 has a pure phase with a d-spacing of 6.25 Å (2θ of 14.20 degree) that is in-between the d-spacing of MAPbI3 (prepared with the same method) and the α-phase of FAPbI3 (good photovoltaic performance material).2 When Br was added to replace I, the (110) peak of the resulting MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films slightly shifted to a higher angle, and the higher the Br content, the higher the (110) diffraction angle, which was consistent with the Br atoms existing in the lattice (decreases the d-spacing). The d-spacings of the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films are very close for the same stoichiometry prepared from two different precursor solutions. The diffraction intensity and the crystallite domain sizes calculated from the line broadening of the (110) diffraction peak followed Scherrer's equation were also very similar for the perovskite films except for MA0.8FA0.2PbI2.7Br0.30 (A2) prepared from the A precursor solution, which has a higher crystallinity. The A2 film has better crystallinity but a lower photovoltaic performance (see Table 2) compared to A1, suggesting that other physicochemical properties of the film are dominant in determining the photovoltaic performance. The GIXRD patterns for the A1 and B1 films are almost the same, but the corresponding cells have a distinct efficiency. This result further supported the conclusion that the crystallinity and crystalline domain size may not be the major factors affecting the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite films.

3.3 The absorption profiles of the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 and MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films prepared from two types of precursor solutions and the EQE curves of the corresponding cells

Fig. 2(a) displays the absorption spectra of MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 and four MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry films prepared from the two precursor solutions. The figure shows that the absorption spectra are blue-shifted by adding Br, and the larger the Br content, the larger the blue-shift in the absorption profile, which is consistent with the Br atoms incorporating in the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 lattice. The absorption intensity between 400–800 nm varied irregularly for the four films; therefore, the relative thickness cannot be extracted from the absorption data. The thickness of the MA1−xFAxPbI3−yBry films determined by the SEM cross-section images will be discussed in later paragraphs. The EQE curves of the corresponding inverted cells are displayed in Fig. 2(b). The EQE curves are consistent with the absorption profiles in which the cell based on the perovskite film that contains no bromide has a no-zero EQE value extended to longer wavelengths than those containing Br. In general, for a similar stoichiometry, the devices based on the films prepared from the A precursor solution have higher EQE values. However, there are exceptionally (irregular) high EQE values at the wavelengths between 550–650 nm for the films prepared from the B precursor solution. This anomalous behavior may be due to light scattering by the cell or optical interference from the active layer of the cell,55 which probably comes from the poor morphology of the perovskite film.

3.4 The surface and cross-section SEM images of MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 and MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films prepared from two types of precursor solutions
The morphology of the absorber film proved to be one of the most important factors for determining the efficiency56 and stability57 of perovskite solar cells. There are numerous strategies to improve the morphology of perovskite films, such as using additives48,58–61 or film post annealing treatment.48 We found that the morphology of the mixed-cation, mixed halide films also depends on the components in the precursor solution. The surface SEM images of the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 and MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films displayed in Fig. 3 clearly reveal that even with the same atomic stoichiometry (such as A1 (Fig. 3(b)/B1 (Fig. 3(d) pair) or A2 (Fig. 3(c)/B2 (Fig. 3(e) pair)) the morphologies of the films are different. All the perovskite films prepared in this study are rather dense with full coverage on the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates, and adding Br into MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 will increase the size homogeneity of the grains but will not always enlarge the grain size of the resulting films. For example, the A1 film (Fig. 3(b)) has a larger grain, and the A2 film (Fig. 3(c)) has a similar grain size but more size homogeneity compared to the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 film (Fig. 3(a)). In contrast, the B1 film (Fig. 3(d)) has a similar grain size but more size homogeneity, and the B2 film (Fig. 3(e)) has a larger grain compared to the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 film (Fig. 3(a)). The order of the grain size is A1 > B2 > MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 > A2–B1. We may expect that the efficiency of the corresponding inverted perovskite solar cell will be D-A1 > D-B2 > D-A2–D-B1, if the surface morphology of the perovskite films is the only factor for determining their photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, the data listed in Table 2 clearly show that the D-A2 cell has a higher efficiency than the D-B1 and D-B2 cells. This may be because the A2 film is denser than the B2 film, and the A2 film has also the highest crystallinity as the GIXRD patterns displayed in Fig. 1.

Furthermore, the cross-section SEM images (presented in the right-hand side of Fig. 3) reveal that the perovskite films prepared from the A precursor solution have a grain lateral size equal to the film thickness. On the other hand, not all grains have lateral sizes equal to the film thickness even for the best efficiency film (B2) prepared from the B precursor solution. The imperfect grain packing of the B group films results in low photovoltaic performance. The data listed in Table 2 shows that the devices based on the B group films have lower fill factors than the cells based on the A group films. The ideal grain growth can be approximately expressed by the following formula: d12 − d22 = k1exp(−Q/RT), where d1 and d2 are the initial and final grain size, k1 is a constant, and T, R and Q are the absolute temperature, radius of the grain sphere, and activation energy for boundary mobility, respectively.62 Given k1, Q, T and the preparation conditions are almost the same, the homogeneity of the grain size (the difference in the grains sizes) depends on the activation energy for the boundary mobility. A larger activation energy results in more homogeneity of the grain size. The presence of Br− in the perovskite film increases the activation energy of the boundary mobility, and the grains grow to a similar size. Moreover, the Br− ions in the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 precursor solution also increase the size of the initial grains of the film upon spin coating, probably by reducing the crystallization rate. Although the grain size varied with the Br− ion content and the components in the precursor solution, the size of the crystallite (also called crystalline domain size) in all the films is not significantly different, as revealed by the GIXRD patterns illustrated in Fig. 1.
3.5 The kinetics of the charge recombination of the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 and MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films prepared from two types of precursor solutions
The steady state photoluminescence (PL) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites primarily comes from the radiative recombination of the free carriers. For similar thickness films, a higher PL intensity implies less non-radiative decay sites (or fewer defects). The PL spectra of the perovskite films shown in Fig. 4(a) reveal that the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 film has the weakest PL intensity (largest number of defect sizes), and the PL intensities of the A1 and B2 films (which have the strongest PL signal) are very close. The PL intensity is related to the SEM images displayed in Fig. 3. The A1 and B2 films have larger grains, resulting in fewer non-radiative decay sites. The horizontal grain size of the A2 and B1 films is similar; however, the PL intensity of A2 is stronger than that of B1 because the former has a lateral grain size equal to the thickness of the films, which the latter did not. The cross-section image of the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 film shows numerous holes (or empty spaces), which cause non-radiative decay, but the horizontal grain size is larger than that of the A2 and B1 films, and therefore it has the lowest PL intensity. However, the defects (empty spaces) in the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 film are not isolated. It can be filled by the electron transporting layer through a later cell fabrication step;50 therefore, the efficiency of the devices based on the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 film is lower than that based on the A1 film but higher than the cells using B1 and B2 as absorbers.

To quantitatively address the exciton dynamics of the mixed-cation, mixed-halide perovskite films prepared from the two groups of starting materials with various stoichiometries, picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was conducted using the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique, and the TRPL curves are displayed in Fig. 5. Two exciton lifetimes with various amplitudes listed in Table 3 were extracted from the TRPL curves using a 2-constant exponential decay function63 as the following equation:IPL = ANRexp(−t/τNR) + ARexp(−t/τR)where ANR is the normalized amplitude of the non-radiative exciton annihilation, AR is the normalized amplitude of the radiative excitons, τNR is the lifetime for the non-radiative exciton annihilation, and τR is the radiative exciton lifetime.

The data listed in Table 3 clearly show that the A1 and B2 films exhibit a higher amplitude and longer lifetime for the radiative excitons compared to the other three perovskite films. The lifetimes of the two types of excitons for the A1 film are all longer than those for the B2 film. Therefore, the D-A1 cell has the highest efficiency amongst the cells studied in this study. The MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 film has a larger related amplitude for the non-radiative excitons (i.e., defect sizes), but the efficiency of the corresponding cell is higher than that of the B2 based device, which may be because the non-isolated defects on the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3 film can be mended by the electron transporting materials in the later cell fabrication process, as mentioned in the previous paragraph. The B1 film has the highest amplitude for the non-radiative exciton (i.e., has the highest number of defect sizes) and the shortest exciton lifetimes amongst all the MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films. As a result, the D-B1cell has the lowest conversion efficiency. It is interesting to note here that the temperature and time for the post thermal annealing of the perovskite films are relatively low and short (60 °C, 30 s, 100 °C, 30 s) in this study compared to that in the studies reported in literature,46 where the film was heated at 100 °C for twenty minutes. If the A1 film was heated at 100 °C for ten minutes, the efficiency of the corresponding cell decreased to 13.4% with a significantly reduced (10%) Voc.
3.6 Possible reasons for starting materials related photovoltaic performance of the mixed-cation, mixed-halide perovskite films
To understand more about why the starting materials in the precursor solution affect the quality of the spin-coated perovskite film, the possible reactions between the organic halides and lead halides were analyzed. We found there was not a solubility, viscosity or stability difference between the two precursor solutions. If there is no halide exchange in the precursor solution, MAI, FAI, and MABr reacted with PbI2 and PbBr2 with equal opportunity. For the A precursor solution, 4 possible perovskite compositions with different halide ratios (MA1−xFAxPbI3, MA1−xFAxPbI2Br, MA1−xFAxPbI2.5Br0.5, and MA1−xFAxPbI2.67Br0.33) can form in the spin-coated film. On the other hand, there are only 2 possible halide stoichiometries (MA1−xFAxPbI3 and MA1−yFAyPbIBr2) in the perovskite films produced from the B precursor solution. The halide composition homogeneity for the A group and B group films is different, but their average halide stoichiometry is the same. The degree of the halide composition homogeneity in the mixed-halide perovskite could be the reason for the difference in the quality of the film prepared by spin-coating, followed by the anti-solvent washing method, since the crystallization rates of the perovskites with different halide contents are not the same. The results suggest that compared to PbBr2, MABr is a better source for preparing the mixed iodide–bromide perovskite film because more possible halide stoichiometries were produced during the film formation by spin-coating. The possible reactions for the A and B precursor solutions are proposed as follows.
A precursor solutionPbl2 + MAI(+FAI) → MA1−xFAxPbl3Pbl2 + MABr → MAPbl2BrPbl2 + MAI(+FAI) + MABr → MA1−yFAyPbl2.5Br0.5Pbl2 + MAI + FAI + MABr → MA1−zFAzPbl2.67Br0.33
B precursor solutionPbl2 + MAI(+FAI) → MA1−xFAxPbl3PbBr2 + MAI(+FAI) → MA1−xFAxPblBr2
We tried to evaluate the composition homogeneity of the films with a selective-area IPCE study (the result are shown in Fig. S3, ESI†) of the corresponding cell and found that both A-type and B-type films were very homogeneous. How to precisely evaluate the composition homogeneity of the perovskite film with complicated components will be the next step for understanding the performance and stability of the mixed-cation, mixed-halide perovskite films.
4. Conclusions
In summary, organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites are a group of materials with very promising optical and opticoelectronic properties and complicated structures. When the organic cation and halide anion are a combination of two or more types of ions, the complexity of the composition homogeneity increases tremendously along with the morphology of the resulting films. The stoichiometry of each component in the precursor solutions as well as the starting materials and preparation methods affect the morphology and the photovoltaic performance of the resulting perovskite films. In this study, we used MA0.8FA0.2PbI3−yBry films prepared from two precursor solutions with exactly the same atomic stoichiometries but varied the starting materials as an example to demonstrate the effect of the starting materials on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting mixed-cation, mixed-halide perovskite films. The distinction in the morphology is due to the halide composition homogeneity of the mixed-halide perovskite films, resulting from the reactions between the components in the precursor solution. Therefore, better starting materials for higher-performance perovskite films have more reaction pathways. It was shown very recently64 that the n–i–p cell based on a lead iodide perovskite contains four types (Rb+, Cs+, MA+ and FA+) of cations, has an efficiency more than 20%, achieves an extremely high Voc of 1.24 V and is very stable. Perovskite films have numerous types of atoms that lots of starting materials can be chosen. One can expect more exciting results in the study of solar cells based on perovskite films containing different atoms.
