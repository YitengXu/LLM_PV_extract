    , Accepted 25th June 2018First published on 26th June 2018AbstractWe have studied bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells composed of the polymer PffBT4T-2OD as electron donor and three different electron accepting fullerenes, namely PC71BM, PC61BM and indene-C60-bis-adduct (ICBA) in order to understand the impact of different fullerenes on the morphology and efficiency of the corresponding photovoltaic devices. Despite PffBT4T-2OD:ICBA devices being characterised by higher values of Voc, they display the lowest power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to their lower Jsc and FF values. We find that although all blend films have similar morphologies, X-ray scattering indicates a reduced degree of order within the fullerene domains in the ICBA-based film. Due to the high LUMO level of ICBA, the corresponding blends are characterised by a lower initial exciton dissociation and this associated with the reduced ordering within the ICBA domains results in increased geminate recombination of the photogenerated electrons in the fullerene-rich domains and a consequently reduced PCE of the corresponding devices.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have been investigated intensively during the last decades as they represent a promising candidate for third generation photovoltaic devices. Much of the research into OPVs has focused on the design of novel electron donor conjugated polymers1–3 which have resulted in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single BHJ OPV devices from less than 1% in the poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) system in 1995,4 to 4–5% in the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) system in 20055,6 and over the period 2012–2014 to ∼7% with PCDTBT,7,8 >9% with PTB79 and >10% with PBDTTT-EFT10 and PffBT4T-2OD.11,12
In contrast to conjugated polymers, less attention has been devoted to the design and testing of improved fullerene-based acceptors.13 Here, the functionalization of fullerenes opens the possibility of inserting a plethora of different electron donor and withdrawing groups with direct influence on the location of the HOMO–LUMO levels and the optical absorption.14–16 Such groups can also tune the solubility or induce ordered morphologies.17,18
The low band gap donor polymer poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD) has recently attracted attention due to its high performance in OPV devices.11,12,19 PffBT4T-2OD, also known as PCE11, exhibits high crystallinity resulting in high hole-mobility, together with the formation of relatively pure polymer domains that allow it to perform well in an OPV device when used in relatively thick layers (∼300 nm). PffBT4T-2OD also exhibits a peculiarly strong temperature-dependent aggregation behavior in solution,11,12 characterized by the formation of a gel at room temperature. Consequently, PffBT4T-2OD based devices are always cast from warm solutions (>60 °C), which then aggregate or crystallize during cooling and film forming processes. Indeed, it has been shown that this aggregation behavior is insensitive to the presence of the fullerene acceptor and can be efficiently used to control the morphology of the corresponding BHJs. This has permitted a near-ideal polymer:fullerene morphology (containing highly crystalline, preferentially orientated, yet small polymer domains) to be created by control over polymer aggregation during solution casting.
In this work we investigate the effect of fullerene properties on the performance of BHJ solar cells based on the donor polymer PffBT4T-2OD blended with three different fullerene acceptors; namely PC71BM, PC61BM and indene-C60-bis-adduct (ICBA). We compare the device performance using different fullerene acceptors and study their thin film nanostructure using atomic force microscopy (AFM), small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and their photophysical properties using transient absorption spectroscopy (TA).
Materials
PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios Al4083), used as hole transport layer, was purchased from Ossila Ltd. The polymer PffBT4T-2OD with Mn = 54900 g mol−1 and Mw = 117800 g mol−1 was purchased from California Organic Semiconductor Inc. The fullerenes used as electron acceptors were: (a) PC71BM, [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester, empirical formula C82H14O2 and Mw = 1030.99 g mol−1 was purchased from Ossila Ltd; (b) PC61BM, [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester, empirical formula C72H14O2 and Mw = 910.88 g mol−1 was purchased from Solenne BV; (c) ICBA, 1′,1′′,4′,4′′-tetrahydro-di[1,4]methanonaphthaleno[5,6]fullerene-C60, empirical formula C78H16 and Mw = 952.96 g mol−1 was purchased from Solenne BV. The chemical structures of PffBT4T-2OD and of the three fullerenes tested, as well as their corresponding HOMO–LUMO levels, are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the polymer and fullerenes used in this work. 
All the solvents used (chlorobenzene (CB), o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the materials and solvents were used as received without further purification.
Experimental methods
To fabricate OPV devices, we have utilized a general architecture consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/Ca/Al. Here, the active layers were all spin-coated from a solution of chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (1:1 volume ratio) with 3%DIO (volume percentage) as a solvent additive, with the polymer and the fullerene having concentrations of 9 mg ml−1 and 10.8 mg ml−1 respectively. Spin-coating was conducted in a nitrogen filled glove box from pre-heated solutions (110 °C) at a spin speed of 1000 rpm onto PEDOT:PSS/ITO glass substrates that were pre-heated to 110 °C. The resultant wet films had a thickness of around 300 nm as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. The films were then left inside a glove box for ∼2 hours to dry, after which they were placed into a vacuum chamber with a pressure ∼1 mbar for another hour to dry, before being annealed at 100 °C for 5 minutes. A cathode consisting of 5 nm calcium (Ca) and 100 nm aluminium (Al) was then evaporated on top of the active layer under a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 mbar to form the top electrode contact. Finally, the devices were encapsulated using UV-cured epoxy and a glass slide. The photovoltaic properties of the devices were determined using a Newport 92251A-1000 AM 1.5 solar simulator which was calibrated using standard reference silicon photodiode calibrated by NREL under the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun). An aperture mask was utilised to limit the light-exposed area of the device to 2.6 mm2.
Optical absorbance spectra were measured using a transmission accessory for a Jobin Yvon Horiba Fluoromax-4 spectrometer, whilst the PL spectra were measured using a different spectrometer (Edinburgh Instrument FLS980) following excitation at 650 nm.
SANS experiments were performed on the LOQ diffractometer at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron Source (Didcot, UK) and processed using Mantid for transmission and thickness.20 The SANS data (on an absolute scale) were then fitted to appropriate models using SasView software (Version 4.1.1).21 For sample preparation, blend films were spin-coated onto 0.5 mm thick quartz slides, pre-coated with PEDOT:PSS following the same procedure used in device fabrication. Therefore, the thickness of the SANS films is exactly the same as the thickness of the device films. Stacks of 12 individual blend films on quartz discs were then assembled in order to produce good signal to noise statistics in the SANS measurement.22,23
GIWAXS measurements were performed on a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline using a liquid Gallium MetalJet (Excillum) X-ray source (9.2 keV, 1.34 Å), with scattered X-rays detected using a Pilatus3R 1 M detector. Samples were prepared on PEDOT:PSS coated silicon substrates following a procedure identical to that used in the preparation of devices.
In transient absorption (TA) measurements the output of a Pharos laser (Light Conversion) operating at 50 kHz at a wavelength of 1030 nm was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) to generate 630 nm pump pulses. This 1030 nm light was directed to a non-linear medium (sapphire window) to generate white light. Transient absorption was then performed using a HARPIA set up provided by Light Conversion Ltd.
Results and discussion

Table 1 and Fig. 2 present the characteristics of devices processed using PC71BM, PC61BM and ICBA as electron acceptors. Devices containing PC71BM as the acceptor exhibited the best overall device performance, yielding an average PCE of 8.9%, and a Voc, FF and Jsc of 0.76 V, 69% and 17.0 mA cm−2 respectively. We find that devices utilising a PC61BM acceptor (which has a LUMO energy level similar to that of PC71BM) had a lower PCE of 8.2%, a similar Voc of 0.76 V, a lower FF of 67% and a lower Jsc of 15.9 mA cm−2 compared to that of the PC71BM reference. Interestingly devices with ICBA have a Jsc value that is much smaller than the Jsc value of the other devices but are characterised by the highest values of Voc. The Voc of an OPV is proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor material and the LUMO of the acceptor material,24 suggesting that the enhanced value of Voc of the ICBA-based device results from the higher LUMO level of ICBA (−3.74 eV compared to −3.90 eV for ICBA and PC71BM respectively).25,26 The low Jsc in the PffBT4T-2OD:ICBA device is also speculated to be a result of the high LUMO level of ICBA, which makes the exciton dissociation less efficient. This will be investigated and discussed in later sections.

To investigate the origin of the different device performance, we have measured the absorption and photoluminescence spectra of pristine PffBT4T-2OD films and of films consisting of PffBT4T-2OD blended with the different fullerenes and the results are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen from Fig. 3(a), that the absorption of the blend film based on PC71BM is the largest across the visible spectrum as a result of the higher absorption of PC71BM compared with the other fullerenes. This increased light absorption by PC71BM partly explains the increased Jsc and PCE of PffB4T-2OD:PC71BM devices. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the PL intensity of the blend films is much smaller than the PL intensity of the pristine polymer due to the quenching that occurs at the donor:acceptor interface. Interestingly, the PffBT4T-2OD:ICBA blend shows much higher PL intensity than the other two polymer:fullerene blends after being corrected for absorption. The high PL intensity in PffBT4T-2OD:ICBA blend can be attributed to the high LUMO level of ICBA, which reduces the difference between donor LUMO and acceptor LUMO energies, being 0.05 eV; a value that is smaller than the exciton binding energy of conjugated polymers (∼0.2 eV).27,28 As a result, ICBA is a less efficient quencher for PffBT4T-2OD. Another possible reason for the abnormal high PL intensity is the morphology of this blend that is rather different from the other two blends. In order to investigate this, we performed a series of characterization measurements.
 Fig. 3  Absorption (a) and PL (b) spectra of pure PffBT4T-2OD and PffBT4T-2OD:fullerene blend films. PL intensity for the pure polymer and different blends is plotted in a log-scale. 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the surface morphology of the blend films. This reveals that all films have very similar surface morphologies (see Fig. S1 in ESI†), with a root mean-square roughness for the PffBT4T-2OD films blended with PC71BM, PC61BM and ICBA being 3.77, 4.50 and 3.74 nm respectively.
To probe the morphology within the bulk-heterojunction films, we have used small angle neutron scattering (SANS). We note that one clear advantage on the use of neutrons to probe this system lies in the fact that the neutron scattering length density (SLD) difference between PffBT4T-2OD (0.72 × 10−6 Å−2) and for example PC71BM (4.42 × 10−6 Å−2) is sufficiently high that no additional deuteration of one component is necessary and the same applies to other conjugated polymer–fullerene systems in general. In Fig. S2 (ESI†), we show SANS data from PffBT4T-2OD:fullerene films with scattering intensity plotted versus scattering vector q. It can be seen that the three different BHJs have very similar scattering intensities, suggesting that the three different BHJ films have similar nano-morphologies (note that all fullerenes studied have very similar scattering length densities). SANS data was fitted using the Debye–Anderson–Brumberger (DAB) model29,30 (eqn (1)) as described previously.19 This model has the form (1)where the scaling factor cDB= 8π(Δρ)2ϕ1ϕ2 and Δρ is the neutron scattering length density difference between the phases having volume fractions of ϕ1 and ϕ2. The second term (b) on the right hand side of eqn (1) is a background intensity that includes both instrumental and sample specific factors, i.e. the incoherent scattering intensity. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the DAB model gives a good description of all the data. The values obtained from the fits for cDB and L using eqn (1) are presented in Table S1. This table also includes the corresponding normalized values of χ2 that confirm the quality of the model fits to the data. It can be seen that although the phase-separated domains are largest in the PC71BM blends and smallest in the ICBA-based blends, the relatively small differences observed cannot explain the large differences observed in device PCEs and PL spectra.
We have therefore used GIWAXS to explore molecular packing and the results are shown in Fig. 4 and in Table 2. In Fig. 4(a) the GIWAXS data is scaled in intensity to the (100) lamellar stacking spacing peak of PffBT4T-2OD at q = 0.29 Å−1. In Fig. 4(b) we show a magnified version of Fig. 4(a) and in Fig. 4(c) we show the same data scaled to the fullerene peak intensity at q ∼ 1.39 Å−1. As it can be seen, the blend sample incorporating ICBA is characterised by an enhanced crystallinity of the polymer phase as compared to the fullerene phase. Indeed, we observe the (400) PffBT4T-2OD scattering peak in the ICBA-containing blend as a shoulder on the fullerene peak around q ∼ 1.16 Å−1 (Fig. 4(c)). When we normalise scattering data to the fullerene peak intensity at q ∼ 1.39 Å−1 (Fig. 4(c)) however, we find that a broad band observed around ∼0.7 Å−1 (that is attributed to unaggregated fullerene) is relatively stronger in the ICBA blend than the equivalent peak in blends based on either PC61BM or PC71BM. This finding agrees with recent work in which ICBA aggregates in BHJs exhibited reduced ordering (crystallinity) compared to aggregates based on PCBM.31 Taken together, our GIWAXS and SANS measurements suggest that blends studied are characterised by similar length-scales of phase-separation, however the PffBT4T-2OD:ICBA blends have relatively reduced degree of fullerene crystallisation although their polymer component is significantly more ordered.

In order to investigate the influence of acceptor LUMO levels and the different crystallinity on the polymer:fullerene blend photophysics, we employed transient absorption (TA) measurements to explore the dynamics of charge generation and recombination in different blends. Fig. 5(a) shows the transient absorption of the pristine polymer and of the various blends measured at 1 ps after excitation.

(b) Decay of the ground state bleaching (GSB) with bi-exponential fitting plotted using solid lines. 
Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the transient absorption spectra of the same films measured at different time scales after excitation. Three primary spectral features can be identified in this spectral range. The prominent negative peaks correspond to the PffBT4T-2OD absorption spectrum and reflect ground-state bleaching (GSB); a measure of the total excited-state population. The photo-induced absorption (ΔT/T > 0) increasing beyond 950 nm observed in the pure PffBT4T-2OD films can be attributed to the polymer singlet state as it is the first species observed upon photo-excitation. This singlet band is broad, extending on the short-wavelength side to a weak shoulder at ∼780 nm. All three polymer blends contain an additional photo-induced absorption peak, easily distinguished from the shoulder of the singlet band, in the region of 760 nm that is thus linked to the presence of charge carriers. This is consistent with the significant singlet quenching observed in blend films in Fig. 3b, and with the reduced degree of spectral evolution observed in the transient absorption dynamics in blend films (Fig. S3, ESI†). The data here cannot distinguish whether the peak at 760 nm is a direct excited-state absorption or a Stark effect at the polymer band edge, arising from the electric field between electron and hole polarons.32 In either case the peak is a unique signature of charge transfer from polymer to fullerene, and our observations taken together suggest that the primary spectral species observed on these timescale is charge carriers. The absorption at longer wavelengths (>800 nm) in the polymer blends may be a signature either of residual polymer singlet states or charge carriers. The intensity ratio in the bands ∼760 nm (charges) and ∼950 nm (charges and singlets) suggests a qualitative yield for prompt exciton dissociation PC71BM ∼ PC61BM > ICBA ≫ PffBT4T-2OD, which is consistent with the steady state PL quenching results. The kinetics in Fig. 5(b) provide further insight, showing the normalised decay of ground state bleaching (i.e. total excited population) in all films. We observe very rapid return to the ground state in pure PffBT4T-2OD, due to a short intrinsic S1 lifetime, having a characteristic time constant of 55 ps. The increased populations at 1 ns in the polymer blends indicate charge carriers with a fitting lifetime well beyond the range of our measurement (∼20000 ps). Interestingly, in the ICBA blends we observe fast decay in the 1 ps to 1 ns timescale (lifetime from fitting was 3300 ps), revealing an enhanced channel for charge carrier recombination compared to the PC61CM and PC71BM blends. The decay is slowest in a PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM blend, suggesting charge recombination is slowest in this blend, which is consistent with the highest short circuit current density. On these timescales, the recombination should be geminate and may be a sign that the carriers remain trapped near the interface in the ICBA blend.
Our results suggest therefore that PC71BM and PC61CM blends show rapid exciton dissociation into long-lived charge carriers with higher yield than ICBA blend. ICBA blends exhibit both a lower initial exciton dissociation yield and faster recombination of the charges that do form, consistent with the much lower Jsc in ICBA devices. This exciton and charge dynamics are understandable considering the fact that ICBA has a higher LUMO level that hinders the exciton dissociation; thus charge generation is less efficient in PffBTT-2OD:ICBA blends compared with the other two polymer:fullerene blends studied. In addition, previous work has shown that fullerene aggregation is an essential condition for the rapid and high-yield formation of charge-separated states.33 Our GIWAXS measurements suggest that the ICBA domains formed have reduced crystallinity, and thus we suspect that such domains have a reduced density of highly delocalized states, with any charge pairs formed being preferentially trapped at the polymer–fullerene interface. This charge trapping is likely to result in the prominent geminate recombination observed in TA measurement.
In summary, we have explored the role of different fullerenes on device performance of PffBT4T-2OD:fullerene BHJ solar cells. Among the three fullerene acceptors investigated, the highest device efficiency occurred in an PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM blend, with an efficiency of 9.31% determined. Devices based on blends of PffBT4T-2OD:ICBA had a much higher Voc of 0.94 V and were characterized by low values of Jsc and FF with devices having the lowest PCE of 3.19%. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we concluded that ICBA blends were characterised by a lower initial exciton dissociation yield due to the high LUMO level of ICBA, with the faster recombination of the charges in the PffBT4T-2OD:ICBA blend attributed to reduced molecular ordering of the ICBA domains. Our work provides a useful example of how the LUMO level of the acceptor-species combined with molecular-scale order can directly determine the efficiency of a macroscopic device.
