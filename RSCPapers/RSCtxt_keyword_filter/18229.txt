    , Accepted 16th May 2014First published on 20th May 2014AbstractA donor–acceptor1–acceptor2 architectural 4-styryltriphenyl amine-based organic semiconductor was synthesized for solar cell applications. Sequential electron transfers together with effective hole transfer lead to a charge separated state lifetime of 650 ns, therefore boosting the short circuit current and efficiency of single layer organic photovoltaic cells.
Efficient conversion of sunlight requires an efficient photoinduced charge transfer and separation that are capable of generating long-lived charge separated states, therefore producing applicable photocurrents in solar cells or driving multi-electron chemistry of fuel synthesis.1–6 Both electron donor and acceptor modules in a donor–acceptor (D–A) organic sensitizers determine the driving force of charge transfers,4–11 while the distance, spatial orientation, and flexibility between the donor and the acceptor significantly influence the efficiency and the rate of photoinduced charge transfers.6–9 These parameters, governed by electronic coupling, reorganization energy, and attenuation factor, are key considerations in the optimization of efficient charge separation as well as in the elongation of the lifetime of the corresponding radical ion pairs.10–12 A key advancement in the field is the synthesis of an organic sensitizer beyond utilizing π-conjugated linkers as they not only favor the throughbond electron migration from the donor to the acceptor, but also enhance back transfer, resulting in faster charge recombination.
Inspired by natural photosynthetic processes, where the formation of cascades of short-range photoinduced energy transfer and multistep electron transfer occurs, researchers have developed a large variety of supramolecular systems in the combination of various donors and acceptors.4–23 Back electron transfer can be suppressed by the cascade design of energy levels of sequential modules. Multi-donor designed systems (D1–D2–A) have been reported with cascades of energy levels and therefore long-lived charge separated states, of which the electron migration rates among donors were too low to generate effective photocurrents in solar cells.16–23 Although the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells exceeds 12% by the multi-acceptor design with a D–A sensitizer and titanium oxide (TiO2) as the second acceptor,24 the limited electron transfer in the interface between the sensitizer and TiO2 is still an issue and the short-lived charge separated states in such systems also present one of the major challenges in attaining highly efficient solar cells.
Herein, we report a metal-free and donor–acceptor1–acceptor2 (D–A1–A2) architectural organic semiconductor, 4,4′-dimethyl-4′′-(4-(4-chloro-6-(2-(9,10-dioxoanthracen-1-ylamino)ethylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino)styryl)triphenylamine (MTPA-TRC-AEAQ), of which long-lived charge separated states were generated due to cascades of electronic energy states and appropriate electron transfer rates inspire potential applications in photovoltaic cells. The design of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ is shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Design of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ with a cascade of electron transfers. 
Donor module MTPA has been previously found with excellent electron-donating and hole-migrating abilities and its HOMO–LUMO transition involves intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the triphenylamine moiety to the phenylene moiety.25 Triazine (TRC) is a typical electron-accepting module and would be able to improve the electron-injection and electron-transportation abilities of its conjugated derivatives.26,27 As such, it was chosen as the first acceptor. An anthraquinone derivative (AEAQ) is another common acceptor and has been reported with a lower LUMO than triaryl modules.18,19,25 Therefore, it was employed as the second acceptor. Our computational results of MTPA, TRC, and AEAQ together with bonded molecules AEAQt, MTPA-TRC and MTPA-TRC-AEAQ (the optimized structures and calculated orbital contours can be found in the ESI, Fig. S1–S4†) further confirmed the cascades of electronic energy levels, thus indicating that the designed organic molecule can thermodynamically facilitate electron transfers.
Upon synthesis of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ (the synthesis details can be found in the ESI†), we first examined photophysical properties of this D–A1–A2 molecule together with four other species, MTPA, AEAQ, AEAQt, and the simple D–A molecule MTPA-TRC, using the absorption and fluorescence measurements. As shown in Fig. 1a, when the triazine module was bonded to MTPA, the absorption maximum of MTPA-TRC became 387 nm, which was red-shifted from 376 nm of MTPA. This is an indication of an enhanced ICT character, which was confirmed by the electron density reduction for the overlapping region of HOMO and LUMO. When a second acceptor AEAQ was attached to MTPA-TRC to form MTPA-TRC-AEAQ, the absorption maximum of this new compound is at 386 nm, which is very close to that of MTPA-TRC, illustrating insignificant perturbation to the D–A1 module. The characteristic band of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ at 500 nm is in between AEAQ (503 nm) and AEAQt (497 nm), an indication of the electronic and steric effects between the MTPA-TRC and AEAQ modules. However, these effects do not change the nature of various transitions as evidenced by similar shapes of the corresponding peaks.
 Fig. 1  Absorption (a) and fluorescence emission spectra excited at 380 nm (b) and 490 nm (c) of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ (black), MTPA-TRC (blue), MTPA (green), AEAQ (red) and AEAQt (magenta) in toluene (5 × 10−6 mol L−1). 
As shown in Fig. 1b, the fluorescence maximum from the MTPA module of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ is at 464 nm, similar to that of MTPA-TRC, but is red-shifted from that of compound MTPA. The fluorescence intensity of MTPA is substantially quenched in MTPA-TRC and further quenched (∼98%) in MTPA-TRC-AEAQ upon the excitation at 380 nm. Upon excitation at 490 nm, the fluorescence emission from the AEAQ module in MTPA-TRC-AEAQ shown in Fig. 1c splits into three peaks (535, 579, and 610 nm) with the maximum at 535 nm, which is consistent with the fluorescence characteristics of AEAQ, but is quenched by about 46%.
To understand the quenching mechanism, we carried out the time-resolved fluorescence experiments. The emission lifetimes from these experiments are provided in Table 1. While a single exponential decay was observed for the MTPA compound, two-exponential decays were found for both MTPA-TRC and MPTA-TRC-AEAQ.

The two-exponential decays of the fluorescence spectra were often explained by an electron transfer from LUMO+1 to LUMO for various D–A dyes.4,5 We expect that electron transfer is also responsible for the fluorescence quenching of MTPA-TRC based on our computational studies, which has been verified by electrochemical determination (see Fig. S6†). As illustrated in Fig. 2, the determined HOMO at MTPA and LUMO at TRC confirm a typical D–A chromophoric structure for MTPA-TRC. Accordingly, the fast decay component (0.29 ns) of the fluorescence from MTPA-TRC was assigned to the electron transfer from the MTPA module to the TRC module, whereas the slow process (1.73 ns) was attributed to the solvation relaxation of the excited states.
 Fig. 2  Illustration of orbital energy levels of MTPA-TRC and MTPA-TRC-AEAQ determined electrochemically. The red and blue lines indicate the observed electron and hole transfers, respectively. 
The results from the time resolved emission spectra of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ at 460 nm in Table 1 reveal that the fluorescence from the MTPA module also decays biexponentially with lifetimes of 1.61 and 0.70 ns, respectively. For MTPA-TRC-AEAQ, the orbital level of the TRC module could not be evaluated directly from the electrochemical determination of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ (Fig. S7†). Then the TRC orbital level in MTPA-TRC-EA was employed given the effect to the substitution of the second chlorine at TRC by an ethylamine group. As shown in Fig. 2, MTPA-TRC-AEAQ has been confirmed experimentally with a typical D–A1–A2 chromophoric structure and MTPA, TRC and AEAQ modules play the roles of D, A1 and A2, respectively. Therefore the fast decay component is due to the electron transfer from MTPA to TRC followed by consecutive electron transfer to the AEAQ module. The longer lifetime of the fast component in MTPA-TRC-AEAQ than that in MTPA-TRC is due to a slightly higher TRC LUMO in MTPA-TRC-AEAQ with respect to MTPA-TRC, shown in Fig. 2, which reduces the driving force for the electron to transfer from MTPA LUMO and thus slows the process. The lifetime of the slow component, which is attributed to the solvation relaxation of the MTPA singlet, is slightly shorter than that of MTPA-TRC. This is due to the intramolecular photoinduced Forster energy transfer from the excited MTPA module to the AEAQ module, which was further confirmed by the appearance of a weak characteristic peak from the AEAQ module that emerged concurrently at about 579 nm in the MTPA-TRC-AEAQ spectrum (Fig. 1b), whereas little absorption and fluorescence were detected for either AEAQt or AEAQ. Similar biexponential decay kinetics of the fluorescence were also found at 700 nm from the AEAQ module; the lifetime of fast component (0.31 ns) is shorter than the corresponding value of AEAQt (0.47 ns). Additionally, the lower HOMO of the AEAQ module than that of the MTPA module allows hole transfer from the excited AEAQ to MTPA, making MTPA-TRC-AEAQ ambipolar.
To determine the lifetime of the charge separated state in compounds MTPA-TRC and MTPA-TRC-AEAQ, we performed nanosecond transient absorption measurements. Fig. 3a shows the characteristics of MTPA+ absorption in the MTPA-TRC compound in the range 440–700 nm with the negative ΔOD corresponding to the bleach of ground states. Fig. 3b shows the formation of charge separated state MTPA+-TRC− with an estimated lifetime of 80 ns.

The solid lines are the fitting curves by the single-order exponential decay equation and the blue line in (d) was obtained in air. The solvent is toluene. 
When the second acceptor, AEAQ, was attached to MTPA-TRC, significantly different transient absorption spectra and kinetics were observed. The significant different features in Fig. 3c with respect to Fig. 3a are due to the addition of AEAQ− absorption at 340 nm and 440 nm and the bleaching of the AEAQ ground state at 500 nm, which were also observed previously for the AEAQ system.28,29 The slightly weaker MTPA+ signal in MTPA-TRC-AEAQ is due to the overlap of the MTPA+ absorption with the bleaching of the AEAQ ground state. Furthermore, it could also indicate that the decay ratio between electron transfer and solvation relaxation is decreased slightly in MTPA-TRC-AEAQ. Similar spectra obtained in the presence of oxygen confirm the formation of the charge separated state MTPA+-TRC-AEAQ−, of which the lifetime was evaluated to be 650 ns. The transient absorption difference spectra excited at 500 nm (Fig. S8†) also exhibit the absorption features of AEAQ− and MTPA+ above 420 nm. All these illustrate a hole transfer from the excited AEAQ module to the MTPA module. The lifetime of the resulted charge separated state MTPA+-TRC-AEAQ− due to hole transfer was found to be around 680 ns.
The eightfold elongation of the lifetime in MTPA-TRC-AEAQ over MTPA-TRC is determined in toluene. These lifetimes change with the solvent and will differ in the solid state. We expect some changes in the lifetimes for both materials when they are assembled into solar cell devices, but still expect a significantly longer charge separation in MTPA-TRC-AEAQ. To illustrate the promise of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ due to its superior charge separation property, we assembled single layer organic photovoltaic cells (SLOPV) using both materials and conducted preliminary tests on these devices. As shown in Fig. 4, the dye was placed between ITO and Ag electrodes with a thickness of about 250 nm by spin coating it from tetrahydrofuran. The photovoltaic characteristics under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are given in Table 2 (the J–V curves of SLOPV can be found in Fig. S9†). The maximum incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency was found to be 46% at 410 nm for MTPA-TRC-AEAQ devices (Fig. 4) and the photovoltaic characteristics of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ are higher in SLOPV than reported data of compounds showing long-lived charge separated states.30–32 MTPA-TRC SLOPV was also fabricated as a comparison. As shown in Table 2, the short circuit current Jcc and power conversion efficiency η were far lower with MTPA-TRC than those of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ. MTPA-TRC exhibits similar photovoltaic characteristics in Schottky organic solar cells with common organic semiconductors such as phthalocyane, poly(phenylene vinylene) and triarylamine derivatives,33–36 of which the efficiency has been improved to 6% above and even exceeds 10% by the combined application of other semiconductors and the appropriate design of solar cell structures.36–40 The far better photovoltaic characteristics of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ than those of MTPA-TRC suggests potential applications in solar cells.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed, synthesized, and characterized D–A1–A2 architectural MTPA-TRC-AEAQ. A cascade of electronic energy levels leads to sequential electron transfers starting from 1MTPA* to TRC and then to AEAQ modules as well as hole transfer from 1AEAQ* to MTPA modules. The lifetime of charge separated states of this newly designed ambipolar MTPA-TRC-AEAQ is elongated to 650 ns, an eightfold of that of the donor–acceptor MTPA-TRC parent molecule (80 ns). The photovoltaic tests indicate potential applications of MTPA-TRC-AEAQ in solar cells. Our approach to design D–A1–A2 architectural organic semiconductors offers a simple yet effective platform to develop novel multichromophore materials for organic solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
