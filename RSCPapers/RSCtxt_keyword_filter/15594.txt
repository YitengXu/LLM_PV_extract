Here, we present two methylthiophene terminated molecular semiconductors with a donor–π spacer–donor configuration (MT1 and MT2) as multifunctional interfacial materials for PSCs. The terminal methylthiophene groups endow the molecular semiconductors with defect passivation capability by coordinating with Pb2+ on the perovskite surface. Besides, both MT1 and MT2 exhibit a stabilized HOMO level and a high lying LUMO level which are favorable for selectively extracting holes while preventing electron transfer. When the two molecular semiconductors were inserted between the perovskite film and hole transporting layer (HTL), the defect density of the perovskite films was significantly reduced, and the charge carrier dynamics was simultaneously improved due to the semiconducting nature of the interfacial materials, as well as the cascade interfacial energy level alignment, which effectively reduces non-radiative recombination losses in PSC devices. Consequently, planar n–i–p structured PSCs based on molecular semiconductors exhibit remarkably increased VOC and FF values, and less hysteresis, along with an increased efficiency from 18.64% to 20.11% with MT2 as the interlayer. Moreover, hydrophobic molecular semiconductors could improve the long term stability of PSC devices by shielding the perovskite layer from external moisture.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) have attracted wide attention in the photovoltaic community due to their impressively rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low-cost solution processability.1–3 In just a decade, the best efficiency of PSCs has surpassed the commercialized inorganic thin film solar cells such as CdTe and CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide),4,5 which can be ascribed to the outstanding optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials, such as low exciton binding energy, long charge carrier diffusion length and ambipolar charge transporting capability.6–9 However, there are still substantial non-radiative charge-recombination losses in PSC devices, which hinders the performance of PSCs from reaching their thermodynamic limits.10–13 The well performing PSCs mostly exhibit a multilayer assembly architecture, in which the perovskite absorber is sandwiched between an electron-transporting layer (an n-type contact) and a hole-transporting layer (a p-type contact).14,15 Recent studies have revealed that the non-radiative recombination losses in PSC devices mainly originate at or across the interface between the perovskite and charge transporting layers.16–18 Therefore, optimizing the physicochemical properties at these interfaces is of paramount importance for achieving better device performance.
In n–i–p structured perovskite solar cells, the perovskite-hole transporting layer interface can affect both the power conversion efficiency and long term stability of the device.19–21 On the one hand, various defects (such as under-coordinated Pb2+ atoms) are inevitably generated at the perovskite crystal surface due to the fast crystallization process and solution-processed stoichiometric issues,22,23 which produces a series of charge recombination centers and makes the perovskite layer vulnerable to moisture and oxygen in an ambient environment.24,25 On the other hand, the hole extraction or transfer efficiency is closely related to the interfacial energy level alignment,26 physical contact and chemical interactions.27–30 In order to annihilate the relevant defect induced charge traps, polymers or small molecule agents such as poly(methyl methacrylate) and long chain alkyl ammonium have been employed as passivators, from viewpoints of bonding to the under-coordinated Pb2+ ions or grafting onto the Pb–I frameworks.31–34 Coating perovskite films with these insulating passivators can reduce trap assisted recombination and increase the environmental stability of PSCs to some extend. However, most of them do not contribute to promoting interfacial hole extraction, and the thickness of the insulating interface layer needs to be as thin as several nanometers, which is difficult to control.21,35 Therefore, much effort has been devoted to developing interfacial materials with semiconducting properties that can simultaneously passivate defects and improve interfacial hole extraction.36–39 For instance, Li et al. reported a pyrene based two-dimensional molecule SMe-TATPyr incorporating thiophene and methylthio functionalized triphenylamine as a bifunctional interfacial material to address the above mentioned issues, achieving a PCE of 22.3%.40 Recently, a dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole (DTPBT) based hole transporting interfacial layer was employed by Wang et al. to passivate defects via Pb–N/S interactions and slow down the generation of the δ phase.38
In recent years, numerous p-type molecular semiconductors with a donor–π spacer–donor (D–π–D) configuration have been developed as hole transporting materials (HTMs) for PSCs.41,42 Compared to the state of the art HTM 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), these D–π–D molecular semiconductors have the advantages of simple synthesis and purification, and some of them can achieve comparable or better performance relative to spiro-OMeTAD.43–45 This motivated us to develop semiconducting interfacial materials (SIMs) through functionalizing D–π–D molecular semiconductors. In most cases, the donor units of these molecular semiconductors are methoxy substituted arylamine derivatives such as diphenylamine,46,47 triphenylamine and carbazole.48 The terminal methoxy groups play an important role in modulating the energy level and anchoring the material onto the underlying perovskite layer.49 However, the strong electron-donating capability of methoxy groups always over upraised the HOMO energy level of the D–π–D molecular semiconductor, thus inducing voltage loss.50,51 Besides, Liang et al. found that the presence of methoxy groups increases the hydrophilicity of the HTM layer, which is unfavorable for device stability.48
On the basis of the above concerns, optimizing the terminal groups of the D–π–D molecular semiconductors could be a promising way to endow them with defect passivation capability, while regulating their energy levels and hydrophobicity. Here, we designed and synthesized two structurally simple D–π–D molecular semiconductors (MT1 and MT2 as shown in Fig. 1a) with 2-methylthiophene as the terminal groups. The sulfur atoms in thiophene are a softer Lewis base than oxygen in the commonly used methoxy terminal group, which is expected to enhance the interaction of the semiconducting molecules with Pb2+.52,53 Photophysical and electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the two D–π–D molecular semiconductors possess stabilized HOMO energy levels and high lying LUMO levels. When inserted between the perovskite and hole transporting layers, these SIMs show good defect passivation capability and simultaneously mediate the cascade interfacial energy alignment that improves hole extraction, leading to an improved PCE from 18.64% for the control device to 20.11% for the best performing device with MT2. Moreover, these methylthiophene terminated D–π–D molecular semiconductors also significantly improved the surface hydrophobicity of perovskite films, thus enhancing the long term stability of PSC devices.

Results and discussion

MT1 and MT2 were synthesized via Buchwald–Hartwig reactions of 2-methylthiophene terminated diphenylamine with 4,4′-dibromobiphenyl and 2,7-dibromopyrene, respectively (Scheme S1, ESI†). The detailed synthetic procedures for the two D–π–D type interfacial materials are depicted in the ESI.† The chemical structures of the final products were systematically characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, Fig. S1–S7, ESI†) and high resolution mass spectrometry (Fig. S8–S10, ESI†). The spatial configuration and electronic structures of MT1 and MT2 were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the optimized molecular geometry of MT2 displays better planarity relative to MT1 due to the higher rigidity of the π linker, which is believed to be beneficial for intermolecular π–π stacking and charge transfer. Fig. 1b presents the electrostatic potential (ESP) profiles of the two molecules, and it can be obviously observed that the negative charges mainly locate on the terminal thiophene groups, providing favorable conditions for coordination of thiophene units with Pb2+ cations. Compared to MT1, the dipolar charge distribution is more pronounced in the case of MT2, which can be ascribed to a weaker interaction of the pyrene unit and donor groups at the 2,7-positions,54 thus causing relatively stronger electron localization.

Fig. 2a shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of MT1 and MT2. MT1 exhibits a major peak at 374 nm and a shoulder peak at 274 nm, corresponding to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone and n–π* transition in the triphenylamine unit, respectively. MT2 presents a “pyrene like” absorption characteristic with a very weak peak located between 420 and 490 nm. To better understand the observed absorption behaviors, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations were performed and the results are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). For MT1, the S0 → S1 transition has an appreciable oscillator strength, corresponding to the absorption at 374 nm in experimental spectra. For MT2, the S0 → S1 transition exhibits a very small oscillator strength, suggesting that it's transition dipole forbidden,54,55 which is in agreement with the weak absorption between 420 and 490 nm observed experimentally. The optical energy gaps (Eg) estimated from the onset wavelength of the UV-vis spectrum are 2.90 and 2.56 eV for MT1 and MT2 respectively, which matches well with the calculation results (Fig. S12, ESI†).

The HOMO energy levels of the two compounds are estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The equation used for the calculation is EHOMO = −(Eox1/2 − EFc1/2 + 5.1), where Eox1/2 represents the half-wave potential of the compound and EFc1/2 represents the half-wave potential of ferrocene (Fc). As shown in Fig. 2b, both MT1 and MT2 display two redox peaks in the scanning range, owing to the oxidation of arylamine moieties. The half-wave potential of MT1 obtained from the first redox peak is 0.20 V versus Fc/Fc+, which is slightly lower than that of MT2 (0.25 V). Hence, the HOMO energy levels of MT1 and MT2versus vacuum are calculated to be −5.30 and −5.35 eV, respectively, which are downward shifted relative to their analogues with methoxy as the terminal groups.47 Notably, the HOMO energy levels of MT1 and MT2 are lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.12 eV) but still more positive than the valence band of the perovskite (−5.44 eV).49 Therefore, cascade HOMO level alignment could be expected when the two compounds were utilized as interfacial materials in perovskite solar cell devices (Fig. 2c), which is beneficial for facilitating hole extraction.56 Based on the HOMO energy levels and the corresponding Eg values, the LUMO levels of MT1 and MT2 are calculated to be −2.40 and −2.79 eV, respectively, indicating that they can effectively block electron transfer. The hole mobilities of MT1 and MT2 measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 2d and eqn (S1), ESI†) were 1.89 × 10−4 and 3.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively, which are remarkably higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (5.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and most D–π–D type HTMs without doping,41 ascribed to the incorporation of multiple thiophene units that may provide useful intermolecular S–S and S–π interactions for charge transport. The appropriate energy levels and high hole mobility suggest that MT1 and MT2 can be utilized as p type molecular semiconductors.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were also performed to explore the thermal properties of the two molecular semiconductors (Fig. S13, ESI†). Both MT1 and MT2 show a thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of over 490 °C, indicating that the two methylthiophene terminated molecular semiconductors possess good thermal stability. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of MT2 was 167 °C, much higher than that of MT1 (122 °C), which can be ascribed to the improved rigidity of MT2 molecules relative to MT1.57
We then fabricated perovskite films modified with the SIMs by dissolving MT1 or MT2 in chloroform and spin coating them onto a freshly deposited perovskite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was conducted to clarify the interaction between the two semiconducting molecules and perovskite layer. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 peaks of the reference sample locate at 143.35 and 138.50 eV, respectively. After modification, both peaks were shifted toward a lower binding energy region by about 0.3 eV, indicating the increased electron density on the Pb nucleus due to the coordination of MT1/MT2 with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions on the perovskite surface.40 The positive shifts in the S 2p profile also suggest interactions between the semiconducting materials and perovskite (Fig. S14, ESI†).

Fig. 3b displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskite films with or without modification. The main peaks of the neat perovskite film located at 14.0°, 28.4°, and 31.8° correspond to the (100), (220), and (310) crystal planes, respectively.58 These characteristic diffraction peaks stay invariant after modification with MT1/MT2, which confirms that the semiconducting molecules do not influence the perovskite crystal lattice. The influence of surface modification on the perovskite morphology changes was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses (Fig. S15 and S16, ESI†). In the pristine perovskite film, the dark perovskite grains are surrounded by some bright PbI2 plates, which is consistent with the XRD results. The perovskite films covered by semiconducting materials show a similar grain size to the pristine sample, while the SEM images become misty due to the relatively less conductivity of the surface modification layer than that of the perovskite. The root mean square (RMS) roughness obtained from AFM analysis is 21.8, 10.7, and 12.0 nm for the pristine, MT1 modified and MT2 modified samples, respectively. The decreased roughness is beneficial for improving the physical contact between the perovskite and hole transporting layers, thus facilitating better interfacial charge extraction.
The UV-visible absorption and steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films (deposited on a glass) before and after modification are shown in Fig. 3c and d, respectively. In the absorption spectra, there is no distinct difference among pristine and modified perovskite films, suggesting that the surface modification process does not influence the light harvesting properties of the perovskite film. Compared to the pristine sample, the emission peaks of the perovskite films after modification blue-shift for a few nanometers, which is indicative of the passivation with trap states.40 Moreover, the PL intensity of MT1/MT2 modified films extensively decreased. Considering the semiconducting nature of the two interfacial materials, the PL quenching phenomenon should be attributed to efficient interfacial charge transfer.35 We further studied the charge transfer dynamics by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. The pristine perovskite film exhibits an average PL lifetime of 151.73 ns. In contrast, the average lifetimes of PVK/MT1 (53.32 ns) and PVK/MT2 (48.90 ns) films are much shorter (Fig. 3e and Table S2, ESI†), following the same trend with the steady state PL measurements. The shorter PL lifetime of the MT2 treated perovskite sample in comparison with that of MT1 indicates a faster hole collection at the perovskite/MT2 interface relative to that of MT1, and might result from the relatively higher hole mobility of MT2 than that of MT1.38,59 Furthermore, when the hole transporting material spiro-OMeTAD was introduced atop PVK/MT1 and PVK/MT2, a further PL quenching was observed and the PL lifetime further decreased to 16.27 and 13.17 ns, respectively (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†), much smaller than the perovskite film treated with the pure spiro-OMeTAD layer (22.54 ns), which indicates that the cascade energy level alignment could favor the interfacial charge transfer dynamics.
As discussed above, MT1 and MT2 not only exhibit appropriate energy levels, good hole transporting capability, and high thermal stability, but also can passivate under-coordinated Pb2+ defects on the perovskite surface, making them favorable candidates as interfacial materials for PSCs. To study the practical performance of these semiconducting interfacial materials (SIMs) in PSCs, we fabricated n–i–p structured devices with a configuration of glass/indium doped tin oxide (ITO)/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/SIMs/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The thicknesses of the MT1 and MT2 layers are estimated as 3.96 and 4.34 nm, respectively, by measurement using ellipsometry (Table S3, ESI†). Fig. 4a presents the forward (F) and reverse (R) scanning current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 for the best performing devices, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The reference device exhibits a best PCE of 18.64%, with a VOC of 1.10 V, a JSC of 22.55 mA cm−2 and a FF of 75.14%. In comparison, the VOC and FF of the MT2 modified device prominently increase to 1.13 V and 78.73%, respectively, resulting in a much higher PCE of 20.11%, which indicates the reduction of interfacial non-radiative recombination losses. Meanwhile, the MT1 based solar cells also exhibit a slightly enhanced PCE (19.25%) relative to the reference device, owing to the improvement in VOC (1.11 V) and FF (76.81%) values. The enhanced photovoltaic performance of the SIM-containing devices might result from the combined effect of defect passivation and improved interfacial charge extraction. Moreover, the hysteresis behavior was effectively suppressed. The hysteresis index enormously decreases from 9.01% to 4.88% and 3.43% for MT1 and MT2 modified devices, respectively, indicating reduced charge accumulation at the perovskite–HTL interface.60 Given the high performance of MT2, we also attempted to use MT2 as a hole transporting layer without spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S19, ESI†). However, the device exhibits much poorer performance, which might be a result of the inferior film quality of the HTL, as MT2 has a very low solubility (<3 mg mL−1 in chloroform).

Fig. S20 (ESI†) shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the champion devices. The integrated current densities are consistent with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves, confirming the reliability of the J–V measurements. The steady state power output as a function of time was also measured at bias voltages of 0.89, 0.93, and 0.96 V for the reference, MT1 based and MT2 based devices, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, the stabilized PCE values of MT1 (18.92%) and MT2 (19.98%) treated devices are higher than that of the reference device (18.07%), which is also in good agreement with the J–V measurements. We note that the SIM-containing devices show a faster response than the reference device after light illumination, suggesting that there are fewer traps and defects at the perovskite/SIMs interface.40
The efficiency statistics based on 30 devices confirm that the as-fabricated solar cells show good reproducibility (Fig. 4c). To further understand how these SIMs improve perovskite solar cell performance, we estimated the defect density (ntrap) of the perovskite films by measuring the dark J–V profiles of the hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/perovskite (with or without SIMs treatment)/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. As shown in Fig. 4d, all the profiles include an ohmic regime, a trap-filled limited regime (TFL), and a trap-free space charge limited current regime (child). The ntrap values can be calculated from the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) by eqn (S2) (ESI†). In the case of the pristine perovskite film, the ntrap value was determined to be 8.38 × 1015 cm−3. After modification with MT1 and MT2, the ntrap values decrease to 5.50 × 1015 and 4.63 × 1015 cm−3, respectively, further supporting that the methylthiophene terminated interfacial materials can effectively passivate the defects on perovskite films and reduce recombination centers. The more pronounced effect of MT2 relative to MT1 in reducing defects might originate from the higher electron density of the methylthiophene groups in MT2 than that in MT1, which is in accordance with a previous research study.61
In order to gain more insight into charge recombination and transportation dynamics in devices without and with different SIMs, we performed transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4e and f, respectively. The MT2 treated PSC shows the slowest photovoltage decay with the longest carrier lifetime (186.8 μs), followed by MT1 (85.7 μs), which is much longer than that of the reference device (38.0 μs). The slower photovoltage decay rate of the SIM-containing devices indicates that charge carrier recombination is effectively suppressed, which has a positive effect on enhancing VOC.62,63 The photocurrent decay shows a reverse trend relative to that of the photovoltage. The faster photocurrent decay of the SIM-containing devices can be ascribed to the higher charge extraction efficiency. These results demonstrate that the SIM treatment not only reduces the charge-recombination rate but also enhances the interfacial charge extraction, thus effectively improving the device performance.
Besides the power conversion efficiency, the stability of perovskite solar cells is also of paramount importance for its practical utilization. As shown in Fig. 5a, we measured the water contact angle of perovskite films without or with the SIM treatment. The water contact angle of the perovskite films covered by MT1/MT2 is over 40° larger than that of the pristine sample, indicating that the SIMs can improve the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface, which is favorable for enhancing the moisture–resistance of solar cell devices. Hence, we stored the unencapsulated PSCs under ambient air with a relative humidity of 50–60% at 20–25 °C, and measured their J–V curves at regular time intervals. The variation in the PCE values is displayed in Fig. 5b. After 60 days of storage, the PCE of the control device was decreased by 67.8%. In comparison, the PSCs incorporating MT1 and MT2 as SIMs still maintained 85.2% and 92.2% of their initial performance, respectively. Considering that other functional layers in the PSC devices are the same, the improved long term stability of the MT1 and MT2 based devices confirms that the interfacial layer can effectively protect the perovskite underneath, which can be attributed to the reduced defect density and the enhanced hydrophobicity of the perovskite film.62,64 Moreover, we further measured the operational stability of the control and MT2 based PSCs under continuous one sun illumination in a nitrogen environment at an elevated temperature of 55–60 °C (Fig. S21, ESI†). The performance of the control device quickly deteriorated, retaining only 45.5% of the initial PCE after 100 h. In contrast, the device incorporating MT2 as SIMs presented substantially improved operational stability that maintained 80.4% of the original PCE value.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed two multifunctional interfacial materials MT1 and MT2 for improvement of perovskite solar cell performance by decorating structurally simple D–π–D molecular semiconductors with methylthiophene terminal groups. Theoretical calculations and experimental studies revealed that the two interfacial materials can not only passivate under coordinated Pb2+ defects, but also selectively extract photo-generated holes from the perovskite layer. The introduction of methylthiophene as the terminal groups leads to a stabilized HOMO energy level that induces cascade interfacial energy level alignment, which further promotes interfacial charge extraction. The TPV measurements demonstrate that charge carrier recombination in solar cell devices is effectively suppressed when these molecular semiconductors were inserted between the perovskite and hole transporting layers. Besides, MT2 was found to exhibit better defect passivation and hole extraction capability than that of MT1, owing to its higher electron density at the passivation group and higher hole mobility of MT2 relative to MT1. As a result, the PCE of PSCs was significantly enhanced from 18.64% to 20.11% with MT2 as the interlayer. Moreover, the stability of PSC devices was remarkably enhanced due to less defects and the improved hydrophobicity of the perovskite layer. This work provides a novel strategy to develop simple yet efficient semiconducting interfacial materials for high performance perovskite solar cells.
