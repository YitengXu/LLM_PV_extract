    , Accepted 5th September 2022First published on 7th September 2022AbstractHole transport materials (HTMs) have a critical impact on the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Most of the current organic HTMs are in symmetric structures. In comparison, asymmetric structures tend to have excellent solubility, thermal stability, and hold potential for application as HTMs. Yet, asymmetric HTMs have been relatively less studied to date compared to their symmetric counterparts. In this work, two asymmetric small molecules 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC are designed and synthesized as HTMs for PSCs, with the asymmetric N-methyl-3-benzoylcarbazole (BOC) core structure connected to the peripheral carbazole-diphenylamine groups. The asymmetric BOC unit endows good thermal stability and film formation ability to the new HTMs. Notably, 3,6-BOC exhibits more suitable energy levels with perovskite materials, a higher hole mobility and stronger defect passivation effect when compared with those of 2,7-BOC. Ultimately, devices using 3,6-BOC as the HTM show a high efficiency of 21.52%, with excellent long-term and thermal stabilities. The results show that an asymmetric structure design strategy for HTMs has the potential to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), with their high light absorption, adjustable band gap, and low exciton binding energy,1–5 have achieved a high certified efficiency exceeding 25%.6 In conventional PSC devices, the hole transport materials (HTMs), as an important component, can not only effectively extract holes from the perovskite active layer and transport holes to the metal electrodes, but also inhibit charge recombination at perovskite/HTM interfaces.7–10 Moreover, the HTM layer is a good barrier to prevent the perovskite active layer from erosion by oxygen and moisture.11,12
An ideal HTM should be low cost, with stable physical and chemical properties, good film formation ability, suitable energy level and a high hole mobility.13 In recent years, small organic molecule-based HTMs have attracted wide attention, owing to their structural diversity, well-defined molecular structure, and reliable batch-to-batch reproducibility.14–17 Various types of small molecule HTMs have been synthesized at this stage, such as spiro-type derivatives, D–A–D based linear molecules and star-shaped molecules, etc.18 We note that the vast majority of these structures are symmetric, while HTMs based on asymmetric structures have rarely been reported.19–21 According to previous studies, asymmetric molecular structures tend to exhibit good solubilities in organic solvents, excellent film-forming properties and high thermal stabilities.22 These characteristics make them quite attractive in organic optoelectronic fields, such as in organic solar cells and organic fluorescence materials.23–25 The design strategy of asymmetric structures should also be applicable in developing organic HTMs.
In this regard, an asymmetric building block of N-methyl-3-benzoylcarbazole (BOC) was designed as the core structure to construct new hole transport materials. Two new molecules, named 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC, were designed by connecting the BOC core with 3,6-p-methoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole and 2,7-p-methoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole as the peripheral groups, respectively. BOC was used as the core structure, because the electron-withdrawing properties of the benzophenone part can modulate the energy level of the material; moreover, the carbonyl group has the potential to interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite. In addition, the asymmetric BOC unit in both molecules was facilely synthesized by Friedel–Crafts acylation reactions from easily available reactants of low cost. The introduction of the carbazole-diphenylamine structure at different sites as the peripheral groups results in different spatial configurations of the two molecules.26 In addition, 3,6-BOC shows a higher hole mobility, a stronger hole extraction ability and stronger defect passivation effect. Ultimately, the device using 3,6-BOC as the HTM showed an exciting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.52%, while that based on 2,7-BOC exhibited an inferior PCE of 19.60%. Moreover, the PCE of the 3,6-BOC-based device is also higher than that of the Spiro-OMeTAD control device (20.57%). It is noteworthy that the devices based on the asymmetric HTMs show excellent long-term stability and thermal stability. Specifically, the efficiency can still maintain 90% of the initial value when measured at room temperature (25 °C) and 30% humidity in 1200 h. Thermal stability was measured at 65 °C, with the devices stored in a glove box filled with N2, and a 93% efficiency could be preserved in the 3,6-BOC-based device even after 700 h. Therefore, an asymmetric molecular design strategy is rational in constructing HTMs, and has potential to contribute to high efficiencies and excellent stabilities in PSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC. The BOC unit was synthesized via a Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction.27 The target compounds were synthesized via a Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction28 between the BOC unit and the carbazole-diphenylamine group; the synthetic steps and experimental details of which are given in the ESI.† The chemical structures of the two HTMs were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S6, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC. 
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed for both molecules on the basis of the PBE0/def2-SVP level with a Grimme's D3BJ29 empirical dispersion correction using the Gaussian 16 program.30 A PCM solvation model was used with diphenylether as the solvent in all the calculations to simulate the dielectric environment of the solid. The frontier molecular orbital distribution is provided in Fig. 2. It is observed that 2,7-BOC shows a relatively distorted spatial configuration, while 3,6-BOC has a more extended molecular configuration. For the orbital distributions, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC have similar distributions, both mainly located on the asymmetric core structures. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of 3,6-BOC is distributed on one of the carbazole-diphenylamine groups that is adjacent to the carbazole unit on BOC, while the HOMO of 2,7-BOC is distributed on both carbazole-diphenylamine groups. The calculated hole reorganization energy of 3,6-BOC is 0.162 eV, which is smaller than that of 2,7-BOC (0.174 eV) (Table S1, ESI†). The smaller reorganization energy of 3,6-BOC may guarantee a higher hole mobility, in comparison with that of 2,7-BOC.

The optical properties of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC were determined by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy in dilute dichloromethane (DCM) solution (Fig. S7, ESI†). The main absorption peaks of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC are located at around 306 nm, and are caused by π–π* transitions. The absorption band at longer wavelengths 330–460 nm should be caused by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the carbazole-diphenylamine to the electron deficient core structure. The absorption onsets of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC are located at 449 and 415 nm, correspondingly, and the optical band gaps (Eg) were calculated to be 2.76 and 2.98 eV, respectively. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the two compounds measured in CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the electrolyte and ferrocene (Fc) as the internal standard. Through the equation EHOMO = −(E[onset,ox vs. Fc/Fc+] + 4.80) (eV), the HOMO energy levels of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC were calculated to be −5.22 eV and −5.20 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels were calculated by ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg, and were −2.46 eV for 3,6-BOC and −2.22 eV for 2,7-BOC. The energy level diagrams of the devices are shown in Fig. 3a. The HOMO energy levels of both molecules lie between the valence band of (FAPbI3)0.875(MAPbBr3)0.075(CsPbI3)0.05(PbI2)0.03 (−5.60 eV) and the Au electrode (−5.10 eV), which is suitable for extracting holes from the perovskite layer to the metal electrode. Meanwhile, the LUMO energy levels of both molecules are significantly higher than that of the conduction band of the mixed cation perovskite material (−3.90 eV), which could prevent electron backflow in the devices.
The thermal properties of the two new materials were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results are shown in Fig. 3b, c and Fig. S9, S10 (ESI†). It turned out that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of 3,6-BOC was 177 °C and that of 2,7-BOC was 165 °C. It is worth mentioning that the Tg of both molecules is much higher than those for most symmetric small molecules reported as HTMs.31–33 TGA showed that 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC showed decomposition temperatures (Td) of 473 °C and 468 °C, respectively, further confirming the excellent thermal stability of the asymmetric HTMs. These results indicate that the asymmetric structure endows the two HTMs with good thermal stability. To investigate the film-forming ability of the two molecules, the top-surface morphology of the hole transporting films was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Fig. S11, ESI†) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3d and e). Both 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC could fully cover the perovskite film and form a smooth and uniform film. AFM images showed that the root mean square (RMS) values of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC films are 10.8 nm and 11.4 nm. The two materials have a uniform film morphology, which is beneficial to the interfacial contact and charge transfer at the perovskite/HTM interface.34,35

The hole transport properties of the two HTM films were explored using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method36,37 (Fig. 3f), and the hole-only devices were fabricated with the architecture of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/MoO3/Ag. The hole mobilities of the 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC films were calculated from the Mott–Gurney Law (detailed formula shown in the ESI†), and were 7.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobility of 3,6-BOC was higher than that of 2,7-BOC, indicating that 3,6-BOC has the potential to exhibit better hole transport properties as an HTM in PSCs, when compared with those of 2,7-BOC.
To investigate the potential of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC as HTMs in PSCs, n–i–p type devices were prepared with a FTO/compact-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au structure (Fig. 4a). Preparation details are given in the ESI.† The thicknesses of the 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC films were 115 nm and 108 nm, respectively. Fig. S12 (ESI†) shows a cross-sectional view of the device measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which shows that there are distinct boundaries between the functional layers throughout the device. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 4b. Detailed data for the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It turned out that PSC with 3,6-BOC as the HTM shows a PCE of 21.52% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.13 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.71 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.80, which is superior to that of the control device prepared using Spiro-OMeTAD HTM (20.57%) under the same conditions. In contrast, the 2,7-BOC-based device showed an inferior PCE of 19.60%. The 3,6-BOC-based device has a relatively higher Voc compared with that of the 2,7-BOC-based device, which may be due to the lower HOMO energy level of 3,6-BOC, resulting in a lower interfacial carrier recombination. Apart from that, 3,6-BOC as a HTM has a higher hole mobility and more efficient charge extraction and transfer properties at the interface (which is discussed in the following part), which contribute to the better efficiency of the device. The PCE distributions of 20 devices are shown in Fig. 4c and the detailed parameters are given in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The PCEs of the three HTM-prepared devices all showed relatively narrow distributions, indicating that the prepared devices show good reproducibility.

Fig. 4d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, as well as the integrated Jsc curves. The PSCs using different HTMs exhibit high responses in the 370 nm to 750 nm range. The integrated Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra are 22.35 mA cm−2, 21.67 mA cm−2 and 22.04 mA cm−2 for the 3,6-BOC, 2,7-BOC and Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the trend of Jsc from the previous J–V curves. Fig. 4e shows the stabilized current density and efficiency measured in 200 s at the maximum power point (MPP). The stable current density and the stable PCE of the PSCs using 3,6-BOC were 21.38 mA cm−2 and 21.16%, and those of devices using 2,7-BOC were 20.37 mA cm−2 and 19.14%, respectively. This result indicates that the PSCs have a good stability. The forward and backward scanning J–V curves for PSCs using different hole transport materials are given in Fig. S14 (ESI†) and the photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The 3,6-BOC-based device exhibits a hysteresis index (HI) of 0.043, according to the equation of HI = [PCE(Forward) − PCE(Reverse)]/PCE(Forward). The hysteresis indices of 2,7-BOC and Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices were slightly higher, 0.048 and 0.053, respectively. The hysteresis effect of 3,6-BOC-based devices is relatively smaller than those of the other devices, which may be due to the high hole mobility, allowing a more balanced charge carrier transport in the corresponding devices.
To further investigate the hole extraction capability of the HTMs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed. From the PL spectra (Fig. 5a), the pristine perovskite film shows a strong fluorescence emission. After depositing the hole transport layer, the luminescence intensity of the perovskite film significantly decreased. It is clear that the perovskite/3,6-BOC film exhibits a more pronounced emission quenching, compared with those of the other films, indicative of the more efficient hole extraction capability in 3,6-BOC. Also, the emission peaks of perovskite were observed to have slightly blue-shifted after deposition of the new HTMs on top, which may be attributed to a defect passivation at the perovskite/HTL surfaces. Details will be discussed in the following part. Fig. 5b shows the TRPL spectra of the perovskite film and that covered with different HTMs. The fluorescence lifetime of perovskite is significantly reduced upon depositing HTMs on top. The perovskite/3,6-BOC film exhibits the shortest fluorescence lifetime compared to those of the perovskite/2,7-BOC film and the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD film, indicating the fastest hole extraction at the perovskite/3,6-BOC interface. The results indicate that the 3,6-BOC HTM layer has an excellent hole extraction ability, which also accounts for the high Jsc and FF in the corresponding devices, in combination with the decent hole mobility of 3,6-BOC. Transient photocurrent (TPC) curves (Fig. 5c) show that the 3,6-BOC-based device exhibits the fastest charge transfer process compared with those of the other two HTMs, revealing a faster charge transfer in the former device. Transient photovoltage (TPV) (Fig. 5d) show that photovoltage of the 3,6-BOC-based device decays slower, indicating that charge recombination could be effectively suppressed. Both the enhanced charge transfer and reduced charge recombination are responsible for the relatively high Jsc and FF values of the 3,6-BOC-based device.

As discussed above, the PL results showed blue shifts of 3 nm and 2 nm for the perovskite/3,6-BOC film and perovskite/2,7-BOC film, respectively, compared with that of the pristine perovskite film. The result implies that the HTMs may have a passivating effect on the perovskite film.38–40 According to previous reports, the carbonyl groups can form chemical bonds with Pb2+ and passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects in the perovskite.41 From the molecular structure, the carbonyl group in the BOC core should play the role of defect passivation by interacting with the Pb2+ in the perovskite. To further characterize the interactions between the perovskite and HTMs, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were performed. From the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 6a and b), the stretching vibration peaks of the CO groups in 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC are at 1598.03 cm−1 and 1597.20 cm−1, respectively. After mixing with PbI2, the carbonyl peak in 3,6-BOC shifted from 1598.03 to 1594.94 cm−1, and that in 2,7-BOC shifted from 1597.20 to 1595.73 cm−1, and the full FT-IR data is shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†).42,43 The XPS measurements of the pristine perovskite film, the perovskite/3,6-BOC film and the perovskite/2,7-BOC film are shown in Fig. 6c. The peaks at 141.40 and 136.54 eV observed from the pristine perovskite films should be attributed to the Pb 4f level. Compared to those of pure perovskite films, the Pb 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks of the 3,6-BOC or 2,7-BOC capped perovskite films shifted toward the lower binding energy region, and the shift in the 3,6-BOC-capped perovskite was more significant. The results confirm that 3,6-BOC has a stronger interaction with the perovskite. We speculate that 3,6-BOC has a more extended structure than the 2,7-BOC, which allows the carbonyl group to interact more effectively with the perovskite surface, thus passivating the defects on the perovskite surface, and improving the device performance.44–47

In order to evaluate the passivation effects, the defect density of the hole-only device with an architecture of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/Perovskite/HTM/MoO3/Ag was measured by the SCLC method (Fig. 6d). The relationship can be described as VTFL = eNL2/2εε0, where VTFL stands for the trap-filling limited voltage, e is the elementary charge, L is the film thickness, and ε and ε0 represent the relative dielectric constant and vacuum permittivity, respectively.48,49 And the VTFL value for the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device is 0.91 V, while that for the 3,6-BOC-based device is 0.69 V. Therefore, the calculated trap density values are 2.91 × 1015 cm−3 for the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device and 1.35 × 1015 cm−3 for the 3,6-BOC-based device. The slightly lower trap density value suggests that 3,6-BOC could more effectively passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ defects than could 2,7-BOC, which also agrees well with the above FT-IR and XPS results.
Finally, for HTMs deposited on top of the perovskite layer, there is a requirement for their hydrophobicity. Consequently, contact angle tests were performed on the three HTM films (Fig. S16, ESI†) by dripping water droplets on the three different HTMs. The water contact angles of 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC films are 81.38° and 76.23°, respectively, both of which are larger than those of Spiro-OMeTAD (65.83°), indicating that the two materials have a better hydrophobicity than Spiro-OMeTAD. Fig. 6e shows the long-term stability of the unencapsulated devices based on the three different HTMs in 1200 h, measured at ambient conditions with a room temperature of about 25 °C and at a 30% humidity. It can be seen that the stabilities of the 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC-based devices remain at 90% and 86% of the initial PCE in 1200 h, respectively, which is better than that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device (80%). Considering that the two asymmetric molecules have good thermal properties, we are eager to know the effect of the two HTMs on the thermal stability of the devices (Fig. 6f). The devices were stored in a glove box filled with N2, and the devices were heated to 65 °C on a hot plate at different time intervals for testing the J–V curves. After 700 hours, the 3,6-BOC-based device has 93% of the initial PCE, while that for the 2,7-BOC-based device retained 90% of the initial value. Thus, the 3,6-BOC-based devices have a better thermal stability than the 2,7-BOC-based devices.
Conclusions
In summary, two asymmetric small molecules 3,6-BOC and 2,7-BOC, were synthesized as hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells, in which the asymmetric N-methyl-3-benzoylcarbazole was introduced as the core structure. The two HTMs exhibited a high thermal stability. 3,6-BOC has matched energy levels, good hole extraction ability and effective hole transport properties, as well as strong interactions with perovskite surfaces. The device efficiency based on 3,6-BOC is as high as 21.52%. Furthermore, the 3,6-BOC-based devices exhibit an excellent long-term stability and thermal stability. This work demonstrates that asymmetric molecular design is rational to obtain efficient HTMs, which is beneficial for device efficiency and stability.
