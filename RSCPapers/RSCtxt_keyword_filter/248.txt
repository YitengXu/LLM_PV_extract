    , Accepted 15th January 2020First published on 17th January 2020AbstractMolecular engineering of polymer donors is imperative to improve the photovoltaic performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, we report that the substitution position of the –CN group in dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCB) moiety-based copolymers greatly affected the molecular packing and photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Four novel copolymers based on DCB units as electron donors and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DFBT) or naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) units as electron acceptors were designed and synthesized to investigate the effects of altering the –CN substitution position. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the P-o-derivative copolymers, i.e., those with outer substitution positions, possessed a more planar conjugated backbone than the P-i-derivative copolymers, i.e., those with inner substitution positions, which enhanced the absorption coefficient and provided higher charge mobility. Moreover, two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns showed clearly that the P-o-derivative blends exhibited strong face-on π–π stacking. This ordered polymer packing facilitated charge transport in the vertical direction. In contrast, the P-i-derivative blends were prone to edge-on lamellar stacking. Combining each copolymer with a small molecular acceptor (ITIC-4F), an optimum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% was achieved for the P-o-derivative blend devices, whereas the devices based on the P-i-derivative copolymers exhibited a PCE of only 6.67%. Our comparative research indicates that changing the functional group substitution position could affect molecular packing and molecular properties. This approach provides a path toward the molecular design of more materials for high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures have attracted tremendous research attention due to their light weight, large-areas and flexibility through the roll-to-roll solution process.1–3 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of fullerene-based PSCs of over 11% were achieved through the use of high-performance polymer donors.4–7 Recently, non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs), particularly those with fused-ring electron acceptors, exhibited impressive results, with maximum PCEs of more than 16%. Non-fullerene fused-ring electron acceptors exhibit strong absorption in the visible to near-infrared region, easy tunability of electronic structures and frontier molecular energy levels through molecular engineering, and improved blend morphology stability,8–21 thus providing versatile opportunities for further development of organic photovoltaic technology.
Donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated materials have also played a crucial role in achieving efficient NF-PSCs. Recent reports have indicated that the regioregularity of the building blocks greatly impacts the photovoltaic performance of conjugated polymers, suggesting that regioregularity is a critical factor that should be considered in polymer design. For example, a pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT)-based polymer with high regioregularity exhibited a hole mobility that was two orders of magnitude higher than that of its regio-random counterpart.22 5-Fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-based polymers with orientated fluorine atoms exhibited tighter π–π stacking, enhanced charge transport, and optimized blend morphologies.23 A pyridyl unit flanked by diketopyrrolopyrrole (Py-DPP) with a nitrogen atom proximal to the central DPP unit exhibited a hole mobility that was three orders of magnitude higher than that of the counterpart copolymer, in which the nitrogen atom was distal to the central DPP unit.24 A similar phenomenon was found in thiazole unit-based polymers. Different orientations of a thiazole unit to a 2-position linked polymer resulted in higher dipole moment and a more planar molecular configuration than those to a 5-position linked polymer, thus displaying superior PSC performance.25 These results indicate that regioregularity is an important criterion that dictates the aggregation, charge transport, and photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
Dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCB) units are among the most extensively investigated π-conjugated building blocks in electronic devices.26–31 The –CN group in the DCB unit possesses inner and outer substitution positions. Under these circumstances, one needs to consider the possible influence of altering the orientation of the functional group on the planarity of the molecules, the molecular packing, and the photovoltaic performance.13,32–37 Therefore, incorporation of the –CN group in the inner or outer substitution positions of the DCB unit provides a relevant platform to investigate the influence of regiochemistry on the resulting materials properties. However, little research has been performed to understand how the substitution position of the –CN group affects the optoelectronic properties, film morphology and photovoltaic performance of PSCs.30,31
Hence, in this work, we synthesized four novel copolymers (Fig. 1a) based on DCB units with –CN groups in different substitution positions as the electron-donating units and DFBT or NT as the electron-accepting units. The copolymers were P-o-derivatives (P-o-DFBT, P-o-NT) and P-i-derivatives (P-i-DFBT, P-i-NT). The optical, electronic, and molecular-packing characteristics of these polymers and their corresponding photovoltaic performance were systematically investigated. Interestingly, subtle changes in the substitution position of –CN in the DCB unit had a significant influence not only on the optoelectronic properties of the materials but also on the device performance. The density functional theory (DFT) results showed that the P-o-derivative copolymers had a more planar conjugated backbone than the P-i-derivative copolymers, which facilitated molecular packing and enhanced the absorption coefficient. Moreover, two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns showed that blends of the P-o-derivative copolymers and (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC-4F) exhibited high-intensity face-on π–π stacking, whereas blends of the P-i-derivative copolymers with ITIC-4F mainly exhibited edge-on lamellar stacking. Using low-bandgap ITIC-4F as the electron acceptor, devices based on the P-o-derivative copolymers exhibited a maximum PCE of 10%, whereas the devices based on P-i-derivative copolymers showed a PCE of only 6%. The marked difference of device performance is attributed to the better planarity of the P-o-derivative copolymers, which facilitated ordered molecular packing and led to the higher absorption coefficient and charge mobility of the P-o-derivative copolymers. Our comparative research indicated that the material properties were significantly affected by changing the functional group substitution position.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis
The molecular structures of the P-o-derivative copolymers (P-o-DFBT, P-o-NT) and P-i-derivative copolymers (P-i-DFBT, P-i-NT), each with ITIC-4F as a small molecular acceptor, are shown in Fig. 1 and the synthetic routes are shown in Fig. 2. Details on the synthesis of the copolymers are described in the ESI.† Two different systems enabled us to investigate the effects of changing the –CN group substitution position on the performance of PSCs. The molecular weights of the copolymers were determined by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene using polystyrene as the standard. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P-o-DFBT, P-i-DFBT, P-o-NT and P-i-NT were estimated to be 48.33 kDa, 40.86 kDa, 44.12 kDa and 39.86 kDa, respectively, and their polydispersity indices (PDI) were 1.94, 1.90, 1.93 and 2.08, respectively (see Fig. S1–S4 in the ESI†).

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S9, ESI†) shows that the onset decomposition temperatures of the copolymers with 5% weight loss (Td) were 405.8 °C, 398.8 °C, 405.2 °C and 411.3 °C for P-o-DFBT, P-i-DFBT, P-o-NT and P-i-NT, respectively, indicating good thermal stability of the resulting copolymers. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed an endothermic transition for melting during heating and an exothermic transition for aggregation during cooling of both copolymers (Fig. S9, ESI†).
Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The absorption coefficient spectra of the copolymers in both chlorobenzene (CB) solution and a thin-film state were investigated (Fig. 3), and the corresponding data are presented in Table 1. In solution, the four copolymers exhibited broad absorption profiles, where the short wavelength range is attributed to the π–π* transition and the long wavelength absorption peak could be correlated with intramolecular charge-transfer characteristics.5 At their low-energy band absorption maxima, P-o-DFBT and P-o-NT exhibited absorption coefficients of 57 and 60 L g−1 cm−1, respectively, whereas P-i-DFBT and P-i-NT showed absorption coefficients of only 44 and 47 L g−1 cm−1, respectively. In the corresponding thin films, both copolymers exhibited vibronic shoulder peaks, which indicated strong intermolecular packing in the solid state. The P-o-derivatives (P-o-DFBT and P-o-NT) exhibited significantly higher absorbance coefficients in films and solution when compared with P-i-derivatives, which is ascribed to the more planar conjugated backbone and the increased degree of molecular packing for the P-o-derivatives.5 Thus, more solar photons could be absorbed and a higher short-circuit current density could be afforded by the P-o-derivative-based photovoltaic devices.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the four copolymers were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S10, ESI†). The corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the copolymers were −5.56/−3.26 eV and −5.59/−3.29 eV for P-o-DFBT and P-i-DFBT, respectively, and −5.39/−3.13 eV and −5.42/−3.22 eV for P-o-NT and P-i-NT, respectively (Fig. 1c). The HOMO energy levels of P-i-derivative copolymers were slightly lower than those of the P-o-derivative copolymers, which is ascribed to the more twisted backbone of the P-i-derivative copolymers, which improved the VOC of the corresponding photovoltaic device.38
Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level with the 6-31G* basis set.29 Dimers were used and all of the alkoxy or alkyl side chains were replaced by methoxy or methyl groups to simplify the calculation. Fig. 4 shows the front and side views of the optimized molecular geometries of the copolymers. The conjugated backbones of the P-o-derivative copolymers were more planar than those of the P-i-derivative copolymers, indicating that the introduction of the –CN group in an inner position resulted in increased steric hindrance between the phenyl group and the vinylene group. This planar backbone facilitated molecular stacking, thus enhancing the carrier mobility and leading to high fill factors (FFs) and PCEs in photovoltaic devices. The HOMO surfaces of the resulting copolymers were well delocalized along their backbones, whereas the LUMO surfaces were mainly localized on the electron-deficient units (Fig. S11, ESI†), which indicates that there was significant charge-transfer between the donor and acceptor units.

Photovoltaic properties
NF-PSCs based on the copolymers with ITIC-4F using ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag with a conventional geometry were fabricated to investigate their photovoltaic properties. Water- and alcohol-soluble poly[(9,9-bis(3-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-Br) was used as the cathode buffer layer because it facilitates electron collection via the formation of an interfacial dipole.3,39 The photovoltaic properties of devices were systematically optimized in terms of donor–acceptor weight ratios, processing solvents, solvent additive, thermal temperature, and thickness of the photoactive layer (Tables S1–S5, ESI†).
For the devices based on P-o-DFBT or P-i-DFBT, the optimal copolymer:ITIC-4F ratio was found to be 1:1 (w/w). The film thicknesses of the active layers, which were spin-coated from CB solution with 0.5 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the processing additive and thermal annealing at 100 °C, were around 100 nm. Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves; the corresponding performance parameters are listed in Table 2. The devices based on the P-i-DFBT copolymer showed a moderate PCE of 6.67%. However, by changing the location of the –CN group from an inner position to an outer position, the devices based on the P-o-DFBT copolymer exhibited a significantly improved device performance due to enhanced JSC and FF values resulting from the more planar conjugated backbone and strong face-on π–π stacking, which facilitated charge transport in the vertical direction (this will be discussed below). These characteristics resulted in an impressively high PCE of 10.00% for P-o-DFBT.

For the devices based on P-o-NT or P-i-NT, the optimal copolymer:ITIC-4F ratio was again found to be 1:1 (w/w), and the film thicknesses of the active layers were around 100 nm. These active layers were spin-coated using a CB:ODCB = 1:1 solution with 0.5 vol% of DIO as the processing additive and thermal annealing at 120 °C. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves; the corresponding performance parameters are listed in Table 2. It was surprising to find that the device performance showed a similar trend. The device based on the P-i-NT copolymer showed a moderate PCE of 6.34%, whereas the device based on the P-o-NT copolymer exhibited a PCE of 9.95%.

Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the NF-PSCs fabricated under the optimal conditions. These four devices exhibited a broad response range from 300 to 800 nm. The current densities integrated from EQE spectra were in good agreement with those obtained from J–V measurement (Table 2), which showed mismatches of less than 5% between the two strategies. The EQE responses of the P-o-derivative copolymer-based PSCs were stronger than those of the P-i-derivative copolymer-based devices in the region of 550–700 nm, resulting in a higher JSC value.
Moreover, the devices based on P-o-derivative copolymers showed a higher EQE response exceeding 70%, which was ascribed to the ordered molecular packing, leading to higher absorption coefficients and carrier mobilities (this will be discussed later).
Charge generation and transport properties
Regarding the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes of the devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the devices was investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The photocurrent density Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the light and dark current densities, respectively, and the effective voltage Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied bias voltage.7,40 For a high value of Veff (>2 V), all of the photogenerated excitons dissociated into free charges and were collected by electrodes and the Jph reaches saturation (Jsat). Thus, the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) can be defined as Gmax = Jsat/qL, where Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density, q is the electronic charge, and L is the thickness of the active layer in the devices. The calculated Gmax values of the devices are summarized in Table S6.† The devices based on P-o-DFBT showed a higher Gmax value (1.2 × 1027) than the devices based on P-i-DFBT (0.9 × 1027). The same trend was observed for the devices based on NT copolymers. Thus, the devices based on P-o-derivative copolymers had highly efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection properties.

To understand the performance difference of changing the –CN group substitution position, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to evaluate the charge-transport properties of neat films and blended films.41 The carrier mobilities were calculated from the slope of the J1/2–V curves (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†) and the values are summarized in Table 3. P-o-DFBT and P-o-NT exhibit a hole mobility (μh) of 9.74 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.53 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which is higher than that of P-i-DFBT (1.10 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and P-i-NT (9.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher mobility in P-o-derivatives could originate from the more planar conjugated backbone and better inter-chain interactions. High and balanced carrier mobility is a crucial factor affecting the FF of PSCs. The P-o-DFBT:ITIC-4F based blended film exhibited a μh of 1.14 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 2.78 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the P-i-DFBT:ITIC-4F-based blended film exhibited a μh of 2.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 9.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, the blended films of P-o-derivatives exhibited higher and more balanced carrier mobility compared with those of P-i-derivative films. Also, the trend in the devices based on NT as the electron-accepting unit was consistent with that in the devices based on the DFBT as the electron-accepting unit; the blended film based on P-o-NT showed a μh of 3.37 × 10−3 and μe of 2.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the blended film based on P-i-NT showed a μh of 2.14 × 10−4 and μe of 4.02 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. These results signify that the better planarity of the copolymer backbone led to higher charge mobilities, which were responsible for the higher JSC and higher FF of the P-o-derivative copolymer-based devices.

Charge extraction and recombination
To understand the charge recombination process of NF-PSCs, the dependence of JSC on light intensity (Plight) was measured. The correlation between JSC and Plight can be expressed as JSC ∝ (Plight)S, in which Plight is the light intensity and S is the exponential factor.42,43 When the bimolecular recombination of the charge carriers is weak, JSC shows a linear dependence on Plight, with an S value close to 1. In Fig. 7a and b, the logarithmic plots of JSCversus light intensity show slopes of 0.986 and 0.968 for P-o-DFBT and P-i-DFBT, respectively, and slopes of 0.991 and 0.965 for P-o-NT and P-i-NT, respectively. These results indicate weaker bimolecular recombination for the P-o-derivative copolymer-based devices, and the values agree well with the device performance. Transient photocurrent measurements were performed to probe the charge extraction process of NF-PSCs. The measurements were carried out at 0 bias, and the relevant characteristics are shown in Fig. 7c and d. The devices based on P-o-derivative copolymers exhibited a shorter charge extraction time (0.21 μs and 0.12 μs for P-o-DFBT and P-o-NT, respectively) than the devices based on the P-i-derivative copolymers (0.28 μs and 0.79 μs for P-i-DFBT and P-i-NT, respectively). This result is consistent with P-o-derivative copolymers possessing higher carrier mobilities. Overall, the devices based on P-o-derivative copolymers had faster charge extraction rates and thus reduced charge recombination, which is one reason for the higher JSC and FF of the corresponding devices.

Morphological characterization
Because the performance of the device is closely related to the morphology of the blended film, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the effect of the –CN substitution position on the morphology of the blended films. The results are shown in Fig. 8. For the copolymers based on DFBT as the electron-accepting unit, the P-o-DFBT-based blended film exhibited a uniform and smooth surface with a small root-mean-square (RMS) of 0.46 nm, whereas the P-i-DFBT-based blended film showed a rough surface with an RMS of 1.77 (Fig. 8a and b, respectively). Similarly, for the copolymers based on NT as the electron-accepting unit, the P-o-NT-based blended film showed a smaller RMS (2.01 nm) than the P-i-NT (2.80 nm)-based blended film (Fig. 8c and d, respectively). These results indicated that the blended films based on P-i-derivative copolymers exhibited an inferior surface morphology, which was not favorable for exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in a lower JSC and FF.

The molecular packing of both pristine and blended films was evaluated by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).44 In the pristine polymer film (Fig. S14†), the P-o-derivative exhibits predominant (010) peaks compared to those of the P-i-derivative, indicating that the neat polymer film of the P-o-derivative exhibits a more orderly molecular packing structure. Furthermore, Fig. 9a and b present the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding 1D line-cuts in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The molecular packing of the P-i-derivative blends was significantly different from that of the P-o-derivative blends. For example, the P-i-DFBT:ITIC-4F blended film showed lamellar diffractions, (100) and (200), along the out of plane (OOP) direction (0.31 Å−1), and the π–π stacking diffraction, (010), along the in plane (IP) direction (1.75 Å−1). The (100) and (010) d-spacings are 20.74 Å and 3.58 Å, respectively, indicating a predominant edge-on orientation. In contrast, the P-o-DFBT:ITIC-4F blended film exhibited (010) refection peaks at 1.82 Å−1 in the OOP direction; the corresponding (100) peaks were located at 0.33 Å−1 in the IP direction, with the (010) and (100) d-spacings of 19.33 Å and 3.46 Å, respectively, demonstrating a preferential face-on orientation, which is favorable for vertical charge transportation.45 Thus, better performance was obtained based on P-o-derivative copolymers.

Conclusion
In summary, we synthesized four novel copolymers based on DCB units with differently positioned –CN groups to systematically investigate the substitution position effects on NF-PSCs. Benefiting from the more planar conjugated backbone and strong intermolecular interactions, the blends based on the P-o-derivative copolymers exhibited high-intensity π–π stacking and higher carrier mobilities. By using the low-bandgap acceptor ITIC-4F, the NF-PSCs based on the P-o-derivative copolymers achieved high PCE values of 10.00% and 9.95% for P-o-DFBT and P-o-NT, respectively, whereas the NF-PSCs based on the P-i-derivative copolymers reached PCE values of only 6.67% and 6.34% for P-i-DFBT and P-i-NT, respectively. These results show that ordered molecular packing can afford enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transport properties, leading to a higher JSC and FF. Our comparative research indicates that regulation of the substitution position of the functional group provides a path toward the molecular design of more materials for high-performance PSCs.
