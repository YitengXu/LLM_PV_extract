    , Accepted 26th August 2016First published on 26th August 2016AbstractThe lifetime and power conversion efficiency are the key issues for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, the development of 2D/3D perovskite hybrids (CA2PbI4/MAPbIxCl3−x) was firstly demonstrated to be a reliable method to combine their advantages, and provided a new concept for achieving both stable and efficient PSCs through the hybridization of perovskites. 2D/3D perovskite hybrids afforded significantly-improved moisture stability of films and devices without encapsulation in a high humidity of 63 ± 5%, as compared with the 3D perovskite (MAPbIxCl3−x). The 2D/3D perovskite-hybrid film did not undergo any degradation after 40 days, while the 3D perovskite decomposed completely under the same conditions after 8 days. The 2D/3D perovskite-hybrid device maintained 54% of the original efficiency after 220 hours, whereas the 3D perovskite device lost all the efficiency within only 50 hours. Moreover, the 2D/3D perovskite hybrid achieved comparable device performances (PCE: 13.86%) to the 3D perovskite (PCE: 13.12%) after the optimization of device fabrication conditions.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have recently emerged as extremely promising light harvesters for next-generation photovoltaic devices owing to their combined advantages of high efficiency and a low-cost solution fabrication process. Among them, 3D perovskite in the form of ABX3 (A = CH3NH3+ or HC(NH2)2+; B = Sn2+ or Pb2+ and X = Cl−, Br−, I− or SCN−) is the most prominent choice for solar absorbers1–5 due to their great opto-electronic properties, including high absorption coefficient,6 desirable band gap,7 low exciton binding energy and long charge diffusion lengths.8 Significant attention has been paid to modifying the various parameters on 3D perovskite materials, film deposition processes and device structures, which are critical for performance improvement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).9–13 As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved up to 22.1% (certified by NREL) from 3.8% since their original application as light-absorbing materials in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells by Miyasaka's group.14 After the rapid improvement of PCE in the past four years, the next key issue for the commercialization of PSCs that remains to be solved is the moisture instability of perovskites.15 The humidity tolerance of PSCs has been improved, although it is still far from complete, through material engineering, interface modification and device-architecture optimization.16,17 Among them, perovskite materials and interface engineering are the most direct ways to solve this humidity-instability problem. For example, the pseudo-halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI(SCN)2)18 and the functionalization of perovskite films with moisture-tolerant molecules19 were reported recently to provide superior moisture stability. However, a change of perovskite ion composition could alter its opto-electronic properties and therefore brought challenges in maintaining its originally high efficiencies.20,21 Thus it is necessary to develop perovskite hybrids by adopting moisture-stable perovskites and high-performance perovskites, which may combine their merits and trigger intriguing research interests.
Herein, we have demonstrated that 2D/3D perovskite hybrids (CA2PbI4/MAPbIxCl3−x) as light absorbers for PSCs provided much higher moisture stability than the homogeneous 3D perovskite (MAPbIxCl3−x), while the cell efficiencies were comparable. Compared with 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites (CA2PbI4) with a layered structure promised a lot as moisture barriers, but their increased band gap and high exciton binding energy limited their efficiency (4.37%).22,23 2D/3D perovskite hybrids, designed for the first time in this research by covering the 3D perovskite film with a thin layer of 2D perovskites, provided a good chance to exploit the advantages of both 2D and 3D perovskites. The upper thin layer of 2D perovskites sharply increased their moisture tolerance by limiting water diffusion and increasing surface hydrophobicity. At the same time, they well maintained the excellent opto-electronic properties of the 3D perovskite film underneath. As a result, the 2D/3D perovskite hybrids demonstrated comparable efficiency but much better stability as compared to the homogeneous 3D perovskite.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Fabrication and characterization of 2D/3D perovskite hybrids
2D/3D perovskite hybrids were fabricated through a two-step process. Firstly, a 3D perovskite photoactive layer with slightly more Pb2+ ions introduced (Pb2+:MAI = 1.4 M:1.3 M) was deposited by spin coating. 10 molar percentage of chlorine was added to the precursor solution to improve carrier transport in perovskites.24 The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image showed that a compact and smooth perovskite crystal layer was formed with a small amount of needle-like PbI2 crystals standing up on the surface after annealing (Fig. 1a). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the film matched well with the reported results of 3D perovskites; besides, the small peak at 12.8° was related to excess PbI2 (Fig. 1c), which was in good agreement with the SEM results. Subsequently, an anhydrous iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) solution of cyclopropylammonium iodide (CAI) with various concentrations ranging from 5 mg mL−1 to 30 mg mL−1 was spin-coated on the as-prepared 3D perovskite layer. Annealing the film at 100 °C for 20 min was performed for in situ formation of the 2D perovskite (CA2PbI4) by a reaction of CAI with excess PbI2. The SEM image (Fig. 1b) showed that the PbI2 phase was completely absent and the surface was more uniform and smoother, suggesting the formation of 2D perovskites.
 Fig. 1  (a, b) Top-view SEM images of perovskite films on the top of PEDOT:PSS including (a) 3D perovskites and (b) 2D/3D perovskite hybrids deposited by 10 mg ml−1 CAI. (c) XRD patterns of films of 2D perovskites, 3D perovskites, lead iodide and 2D/3D perovskite hybrids prepared with various CAI concentrations (5 mg ml−1, 10 mg ml−1, 20 mg ml−1 and 30 mg ml−1). (d) Cross-sectional images of PSCs based on 2D/3D perovskite hybrids prepared with 30 mg ml−1 CAI. 
Such a reaction was further confirmed by XRD analysis. As the CAI concentration was increased from 5 mg mL−1 to 30 mg mL−1, the intensity of the peak at 12.8° related to PbI2 decreased and the intensity of the peak at 7.4° consistent with the major characteristic peak of 2D perovskites started to show up (Fig. 1c). Probably because the 2D perovskite layer was extremely thin, the XRD signals of 2D perovskites were too weak to be observed when the CAI concentration was lower than 10 mg mL−1. The 2D/3D perovskite hybrid produced with the CAI concentration of 30 mg mL−1 showed the disappearance of the XRD signal of PbI2 at 12.8° and suggested that the diffusion of CAI into the 3D perovskite layer could consume almost all the residue PbI2 in the 3D perovskite crystals. Additionally, the produced 2D perovskite layer was also clearly observed on the cross-section SEM images of devices (Fig. 1d). The total thickness of 2D/3D perovskite hybrid layers increased from 300 nm to 330 nm when the CAI concentration improved from 5 mg mL−1 to 30 mg mL−1, indicating that thicker 2D perovskites were produced with improved CAI concentration.
2.2 Opto-electronic properties

Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of 3D perovskites and 2D/3D perovskite hybrids deposited with various CAI concentrations. In the case of 3D perovskites, the absorption onset is at ca. 780 nm, translated into an optical band gap of 1.59 eV, which is fully consistent with the reports of other labs.25,26 2D/3D perovskite hybrids exhibited almost the same UV-vis absorption spectra as 3D perovskites without a change of the absorption onset and the peak intensity at 780 nm. It indicated that CAI just reacted with the excess PbI2 to form CA2PbI4, rather than underwent a reaction with the bulk 3D perovskite crystals to change their band gap as reported.23,27

Fig. 2b shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of 3D perovskite/glass, PCBM/3D perovskite/glass, (2D/3D perovskite hybrid)/glass and PCBM/(2D/3D perovskite hybrid)/glass. To simplify the discussion, only the PL spectrum of the 2D/3D perovskite hybrid deposited with 10 mg mL−1 of CAI is presented in the figure and the data of other CAI concentrations can be found in the ESI.† A strong quenching of photoluminescence emission of both the 3D perovskite and 2D/3D perovskite hybrids by PCBM was observed. It indicated that the 2D perovskite layer on the top of the perovskite hybrid did not hinder the efficient extraction of electrons produced in 3D perovskites by PCBM. The obvious quenching effect of 2D perovskites on 3D perovskites suggested that the carrier dissociation took place at the interface between them, which may be promoted by their inconsistent energy levels.
2.3 Moisture stability of 2D/3D perovskite hybrid films
A comparative study on moisture stability between 2D/3D perovskite hybrids and homogeneous 3D perovskites has been done by visual observation, UV-vis absorption, XRD and contact angle measurements. To simplify the discussion, only 2D/3D perovskite hybrids deposited with a CAI of 10 mg mL−1 are presented here for comparison and the data of other CAI concentrations are given in the ESI.† As the storage time in the atmospheric humidity of 63 ± 5% increased, the absorption onset of 3D perovskites diminished and the onset of PbI2 at ∼540 nm became distinct instead (Fig. 3a). Eight days later, only absorption of PbI2 was observed, which implied the complete decomposition of 3D perovskites (Fig. 3a). The corresponding optical color change of the film is shown on the right side of the spectrum. Severe and rapid degradation of 3D perovskites was observed as drastic color changes from black (perovskite) to yellow (PbI2) (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the 2D/3D perovskite hybrids stored under the same conditions for a much longer time of up to 40 days exhibited no change in the light absorption spectra and by visual observation (Fig. 3b), indicating a significantly enhanced stability to humidity.

On the right are images of the 3D perovskite films before and after exposure to ambient air. (b) UV-vis spectra of 2D/3D perovskite hybrid films freshly prepared with 10 mg ml−1 CAI and the same films after exposure to ambient air for 40 days. On the right are images of 2D/3D perovskite hybrid (10 mg ml−1) films before and after exposure to ambient air. (c, d) XRD patterns of fresh and aged (40 days) perovskite films: (c) 3D perovskite and (d) 2D/3D perovskite hybrids deposited with 10 mg ml−1 CAI. 
In addition to the general estimation by the optical observation above, more decisive information on the degradation of these two kinds of photoactive layers was obtained from the XRD analysis (Fig. 3c and d). According to the XRD results, 3D perovskites underwent complete decomposition after 8 days, while 2D/3D perovskite hybrids kept exactly the same structure after being exposed to air at room temperature without any cover for as long as 40 days. These results agree well with the conclusion from the optical observation.
Although it was generally accepted that the high moisture stability of 2D perovskites is ascribed to their layered structure,22,23 contact angle analysis in this research suggested that surface hydrophobicity should be another factor contributing significantly to their better humidity stability due to their much more hydrophobic surface, suggested by larger contact angles (71.3°) than 3D perovskites (55.7°) when using water droplets (Fig. 4).

2.4 Device performances
The standard device architecture of the 2D/3D perovskite hybrid solar cells is shown in Fig. 5a. It consists of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/3D perovskite or (2D/3D perovskite hybrid)/PCBM/rhodamine 101/LiF/Ag,25 where the 2D/3D perovskite hybrid was 3D perovskite (MAPbIxCl3−x) covered with a thin layer of 2D perovskite (CA2PbI4) as described above.

(b, c) Device-performance curves of PSCs based on 3D perovskite and 2D/3D perovskite hybrids (10 mg ml−1 CAI) including (b) typical J–V curves obtained by reverse scan (from 1.5 V to −0.2 V) and (c) EQE of the corresponding devices. (d) The efficiency degradation curve of PSCs based on 3D perovskite and 2D/3D perovskite hybrids deposited by various CAI concentrations of 10 mg ml−1, 20 mg ml−1 and 30 mg ml−1 in 63 ± 5% humidity without encapsulation. 
The results for different concentrations of CAI are summarized in Table 1. It was found that the series resistance of devices increased gradually with the concentration of CAI going up from 10 mg ml−1 to 30 mg ml−1, resulting in lower photocurrent density and fill factor (FF), which could be due to the formation of thicker 2D perovskites on the surface of the photoactive layer as demonstrated by thickness measurements (ESI†). On the other hand, a CAI concentration of 5 mg ml−1 was too low to generate a connected 2D perovskite layer, and resulted in comparatively lower device efficiency and lower moisture stability (Table 1 and ESI†). When both stability and device performances were taken into consideration together, the moderate CAI concentration of 10 mg ml−1 gave the best results. It not only afforded a connected 2D perovskite film with an appropriate thickness for moisture blocking, but also gave high device performances, achieving a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 19.29 mA cm−2 and an FF of 77.26%, leading to an overall device efficiency of 13.86% with small hysteresis (Table 1, Fig. 5b and S7†). For comparison, a control device with 3D perovskites as a light absorber was also fabricated with the same structure and procedure. A similar PCE of 13.12% was produced (Table 1 and Fig. 5b). It was in good agreement with the PL research results that inserting a thin film of 2D perovskites between 3D perovskites and PCBM did not cause obvious hindrance of electron carrier dissociation between PCBM and perovskites. To verify the Jsc values obtained from J–V curves, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these solar devices is shown in Fig. 5c. EQE integration over an AM 1.5G spectrum delivers a Jsc value consistent with the corresponding J–V measurement. To comprehensively and deeply compare the performances of 2D/3D-perovskite and 3D-perovskite devices, their statistical PCEs (sixty devices) and distribution of the Jsc, Voc, and FF (twenty devices) were studied. As shown in Fig. S8 and S9,† 2D/3D perovskites provided similar device performances and parameter distributions as 3D perovskites, even though the performance variation among devices was significant.

2.5 Moisture stability of devices
In spite of the high photovoltaic efficiency, one major concern in the design of 2D/3D hybrid perovskites is to improve the moisture durability of devices based on them for terrestrial applications. Therefore, we studied the humidity stability of these devices with 2D/3D hybrid perovskites and 3D perovskites as light absorbers, respectively. Devices were stored and tested without encapsulation (the devices were exposed directly to the environment without any cover) in an ambient environment at room temperature with 63 ± 5% humidity. As shown in Fig. 5d, in terms of the PCEs of 2D/3D perovskite hybrid devices, the majority of the original efficiency was retained within 110 hours. Among them, the most encouraging example was that the 2D/3D perovskite hybrid fabricated by 10 mg mL−1 CAI provided not only high performances but also excellent moisture stability. It maintained 54% of the initial PCE value after 220 hours. The performance degradation mainly came from the decrease of Jsc and FF. However, 3D perovskite based devices degraded dramatically under the same conditions, with a sharp drop in efficiency to zero after only 50 hours (Fig. 5d).
The moisture stability of devices is much lower than perovskite films because the device performances are sensitive to many factors, besides the decomposition of perovskites themselves. Here, the degradation of PCBM and the reaction of the metal electrode with perovskites in a humid environment should also be underlying reasons for the decrease of device performances.26
3. Conclusion
In summary, 2D/3D perovskite hybrids (CA2PbI4/MAPbIxCl3−x) were successfully fabricated for the first time by covering 3D perovskites with an in situ produced thin film of 2D perovskites. Compared with 3D perovskites (MAPbIxCl3−x), 2D/3D perovskite hybrids afforded significantly improved moisture stability of films and devices unsealed in a high humidity of 63 ± 5%. The 2D/3D perovskite-hybrid film did not undergo any degradation after 40 days, while the 3D perovskite decomposed completely under the same conditions after 8 days. The 2D/3D perovskite-hybrid device maintained 54% of the original efficiency after 220 hours, whereas the 3D perovskite device lost all the efficiency within only 50 hours. More interestingly, 2D/3D perovskite hybrids achieved comparable device performances (PCE: 13.86%) as compared to 3D perovskites (PCE: 13.12%) after the optimization of device fabrication conditions. These results demonstrate that developing perovskite hybrids is a promising way by which to construct both stable and efficient PSCs and opens a new door for promoting the practical applications of this promising photovoltaic technology. Construction of novel perovskite hybrids together with ion exchange engineering on the perovskite absorbers is in progress to further improve the stability and efficiency of devices.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Synthesis of CAI
9.5 ml hydriodic acid (57% in water, Aldrich) and 5.0 ml cyclopropylamine (98%, Sigma Aldrich) in ethanol (20.0 ml) were reacted in a round-bottom flask of 100 ml at 0 °C for 2 h with vigorous stirring. The pure products were obtained after evaporation of reaction solvents and then recrystallized twice from ethanol and diethyl ether. Finally, the products were dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
4.2 Preparation of 2D/3D perovskite hybrid (CA2PbI4/MAPbIxCl3−x) films
A solution of 0.14 M PbCl2, 1.26 M PbI2 and 1.3 M MAI in a cosolvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) (vol. ratio = 3:7) was prepared in a glove box. The solution was spin coated on substrates at 1000 rpm for 20 s and then 3500 rpm for 40 s to afford 3D perovskites (MAPbIxCl3−x) with a slight excess of PbI2. At 45 s, 900 μl of anhydrous toluene was dropped on the surface to obtain a smooth film morphology. After the preparation of 3D perovskites, solutions of CAI with various concentrations of 5 mg ml−1, 10 mg ml−1, 20 mg ml−1 and 30 mg ml−1 in anhydrous iso-propyl alcohol (IPA) were spin-coated on the prepared 3D perovskites at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 20 min to produce 2D perovskites on the top through a reaction of CAI with excess PbI2.
4.3 Device fabrication
To fabricate the planar perovskite solar cells, a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was coated on precleaned ITO glass. Then, the photoactive layers, including 2D/3D perovskite hybrids and homogeneous 3D perovskites, were deposited as described above. On the top of the perovskite layer, a PCBM layer of 20 nm was deposited. Next, rhodamine 101 was spin coated with a concentration of 0.05 wt% in IPA at 1500 rpm. Then, a super-thin LiF layer with a thickness of 1.0 nm was evaporated on it. Finally, thermal deposition of a 100 nm thick Ag electrode completed the fabrication of devices.
4.4 Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by using a solar simulator (XES-50S1, SAN-EI) at 100 mA cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) with a scan range from +1.5 V to −0.2 V and a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1, ignoring the hysteresis behavior of conventional PSCs. The hysteresis behaviors of the 2D/3D perovskite hybrid based PSCs were investigated and are given in the ESI.† The illumination intensity was calibrated by a Si-reference cell certified by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards). The J–V curves of all devices were measured by using an active area of 0.11 cm2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by using a power source (QE-LXE 75 W xenon lamp, Enli Technology Co., Ltd) with a monochromator of QE-M110. UV–vis absorption was measured using a TU-1950 (Beijing's General Instrument Co., Ltd) spectrophotometer. Steady state PL was carried out using a HITACHI F-7000 spectrofluorometer. XRD measurements were performed at room temperature with a PANalytical X'Pert3 powder diffractometer operating in Bragg–Brentano scanning mode, with an angular resolution of 0.01° and Cu–K radiation (0.154056 nm wavelength). SEM images were measured by using JSM-7800F. The contact angle test was performed on the Kruss system (Model DSA-10). The thickness of films was tested by using an Alpha-step IQ system.
