    , Accepted 25th November 2010First published on 14th December 2010AbstractPoly(arylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(arylene-vinylene)s (PAE-PAVs) combine the intrinsic features of both poly(arylene-ethynylene) (PAE) and poly(arylene-vinylene) (PAV) in a single polymeric backbone. They exhibit enhanced electron affinity, as compared to parent poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) (PPV), making electron injection easier, placing them as potential candidates for low turn-on voltage organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Depending on the chemical structures, PAE-PAVs have been efficiently used either as donor materials in polymer-PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester) or polymer-Vinazene (2-vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazole) bulk heterojunction solar cells or as acceptor materials in polymer-polymer bilayer and blend solar cells. This article reviews the synthesis and properties (electroluminescence and photovoltaic) of π-conjugated alkoxy-substituted PAE-PAVs, designed by us, and which were obtained either by Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons olefination reaction of luminophoric dialdehydes with bisphosphonate esters, or Knoevenagel reaction of the same dialdehydes with dinitriles.
1. Introduction
Initial work on both polymeric organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPV) was based on poly(phenylene-vinylene) (PPV),1,2 and intensive research focus was directed on its derivatives in the aftermath.3 The parent unsubstituted PPV is insoluble, infusible and difficult to process. Solution processability is desirable as it allows polymeric materials to be solution cast as thin films for various applications.3 Synthetic routes introduced by Wessling and others allowed the synthesis of soluble precursors, which can be processed into thin films prior to thermal conversion to PPV.4–8 A potential drawback of the precursor routes is the limited control over polydispersity and molecular weight of the resulting polymer.
Solution processable PPV derivatives were first reported by Ohnishi et al.9 and by Wudl et al.10,11 The solubility of the materials was achieved by grafting of long alkyloxy chains, which cause some conformational mobility of the polymers. As a consequence the soluble derivatives have lower glass transition temperatures than parent PPV. Poly[(2,5-dialkoxy-1,4-phenylene)-vinylene]s incorporating long alkoxy side chains are soluble in conventional organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, or chlorobenzene.9,10,12–15 They exhibit bathochromically shifted absorption and emission spectra as compared to the parent PPV, and their photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum yields are higher than those of the parent PPV, which is due to the isolation of the conjugated backbone by the side chains. Fig. 1 depicts the chemical structures of PPV and its different alkoxy-substituted derivatives. The solubility increases from left to right, whereby the solubility of the much studied MEH-PPV and MDMO-PPV is enhanced by the branched nature of their side chains.11

PPV-type materials are predominantly hole-conducting materials with high-lying LUMO levels. The unbalanced charge carrier transport properties and the relatively high barrier for electron injection from electrode metals such as aluminium limit the efficiency of single-layered OLED devices.1,16,17
In contrast, the dehydrogenated congeners of PPVs, poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)s (PPEs), have relatively lower-lying LUMO levels related to enhanced electron affinity, attributed to the electron-accepting nature of triple bonds. Moreover the alkyne linkage minimizes steric and conformational hindrances compared with alkene linkages.18,19 For instance, steric interactions between the aromatic units and double bonds in poly(arylene-vinylene)s result in strong deviation from coplanarity, thus reducing the π-conjugation. A typical example is poly(anthracenylene-vinylene) in which an out-of-plane distortion of 80° is observed.20 In contrast, while direct steric interaction with alkynes may result in bending distortion, conjugation is however maintained, which is ascribed to their cylindrical electronic symmetry. PPEs exhibit moreover a shape-persistent rigid rod-like structure.21 As such they are characterized by very high molar extinction coefficients and high fluorescence quantum yields, Φf, in the non-aggregated state (e.g. solution) but very low Φf in the aggregated state due to very strong π–π interchain interactions creating many non-radiative deactivation paths.22
Combining the building units of PPE and PPV within a single polymeric backbone has resulted in a new class of conjugated materials, the poly(phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(phenylene-vinylene)s (PPE-PPVs). This concept which was independently conceived by Bunz et al.23 and by Egbe et al.24 incorporates the interesting features of both PPVs and PPEs. Compared to PPEs, they exhibit bathochromically shifted absorption and emission spectra and enhanced solid state fluorescence quantum yield due to less π–π interchain interactions caused by the presence of the less rigid PPV moiety. With respect to PPVs, they are characterized by higher electron affinity, which is reflected by low turn on voltages of light-emitting diodes designed with the help of these materials.
While Bunz et al. focused on alkyl-substituted PPE-PPVs of general constitutional unit (Ph–CC–Ph–CH=CH–)n, which were obtained using the Mo(CO)6-catalyzed acyclic diyne metathesis (ADIMET) synthetic protocol,25–27 our focus has been mainly directed towards alkoxy-substituted compounds with various conjugation patterns.28 Only one publication so far reports on mixed alkyl- and alkoxy-substituted PPE-PPVs.29 For a detailed review of articles on PPE-PPVs published prior to 2008, the reader is referred to ref. 28.
In this feature article, our main focus is directed towards alkoxy-substituted and π-bridged poly(arylene-ethynlene)-alt-poly(arylene-vinylene)s (PAE-PAVs) synthesized by us, which have been applied in organic light emitting diodes (OLED) and organic photovoltaics (OPV). We first describe the synthesis and characterization of the materials before presenting the results from OLED and OPV studies, respectively.
2. Synthesis and characterization
From the retrosynthetic standpoint and depending on the positions of bond cleavages, one can distinguish three possible polycondensation paths to alkoxy-substituted PAE-PAVs, as illustrated in Fig. 2, namely the Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction,19 the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons olefination reaction,30,31 and the Knoevenagel reaction.32
 Fig. 2  Retrosynthetic approach leading to the hybrid polymers. 
The Pd-catalyzed and Cu-cocatalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling polycondensation reactions of diethynylarenes with dihalogeno arenes (Route A)19,22 have a number of drawbacks, such as longer reaction time (24 to 72 h), lower molecular weights, 1 to 3% diyne defect structures and the difficulty of removing the catalyst from the polymeric end product.19,33 An approach to remove the catalyst has recently been proposed by Nielsen et al.,33 however the removal process is time consuming and the reagent used is very toxic. Route B which we preferentially adopt, consists either of Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons olefination or Knoevenagel reaction of luminophoric dialdehydes with bisphosphonate esters or dinitriles, respectively, in the presence of an excess of a strong base, i.e. potassium tert-butoxide.28,30–32 It offers numerous advantages. The high reactivity of these reactions necessitate very short reaction times (0.5 to 3 h) to provide high molecular-weight materials with fewer defects. Over 98% of the double bonds have a trans-configuration. Materials of high purity are obtained after work up. A crucial step in the work up is the extraction of the crude product with diethyl ether to attain monomodal molecular-weight distributions with polydispersities close to 2.28
Route B requires the preliminary synthesis of the fluorophoric dialdehydes and the bisphosphonate esters or the dinitriles. The last two classes of compounds are obtained based on well established literature procedures.28 In order to study the effects of both conjugation pattern (triple bond/double bond ratio) and side chains on the properties of the polymers, various dialdehydes were synthesized as described below.
1,4-Bis(4-formylphenylethynyl)-2,5-dialkoxybenzenes 424,34–37 and 1,4-bis(4-formyl-2,5-dialkoxyphenylethynyl)-2,5-dialkoxybenzenes 535,38 leading respectively to four-fold and eight-fold alkoxy-substituted polymers of general constitutional structure –(Ph–CC–Ph–CC–Ph–CH=CH–Ph–CH=CH–)n were obtained using the Sonogashira synthetic protocol as shown in Scheme 1. They were attained in yields between 60 and 90% alongside 1 to 6% of diyne-containing side products, which served as starting materials for diyne containing polymers of general constitutional structure –(Ph–CC–Ph–CC–CC–Ph–CC–Ph–CH=CH–Ph–CH=CH–)n.39

4-Formyl-2,5-dialkoxyphenylacetylenes bearing different symmetric side chains (13) or dissymmetric side chains (19: R2 = 2-ethylhexyl) were important building units in the synthesis of further dialdehydes especially those incorporating aromatic units other than phenyl rings. They were synthesized in a five step reaction starting from either hydroquinone (8) or 4 methoxyphenol (14) as depicted in Scheme 2.35,38,40,41
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of 4-formyl-2,5-dialkoxyphenylacetylenes.35,38,40,41 
The subsequent Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of 13 or 19 with either dihalogeno (Br or I) or monohalogeno arenes has led to different types of dialdehydes as illustrated in Schemes 3 and 4.38,40–45 In all cases 1 to 5% of 1,4-bis (4-formyl-2,5-dialkoxyphenyl)-butadiynes (24) were chromatographically isolated as side products.

 Scheme 4  General synthetic route to (4-formyl-2,5-dialkoxyphenylethynyl)-arylcarbaldehydes.40,44,45 
A diyne-containing compound 24a bearing octyloxy side chains was directly synthesized in high yield by means of CuI catalyzed oxidative coupling of 4-formyl-2,5-dialkoxyphenylacetylene as shown in Scheme 5.46
 Scheme 5  Synthesis of 1,4-bis(4-formyl-2,5-dioctyloxyphenyyl)-butadiyne.46 
The chemical structures of the various dialdehydes were confirmed by NMR, IR, elemental analysis and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The same analytical methods were used to confirm the structures of the resulting polymers in addition to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) for the estimation of the molecular weights. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to study the thermal behavior of the polymers.
A general synthetic route to the polymers is depicted in Scheme 6. The structures of all PAE-PAVs so far published by Egbe et al., which were used in the design of OLEDs and/or organic solar cells (OSCs), are presented in Table 1 together with their thin film absorption and emission data, namely the absorption maxima, λa, the optical band gap energies, Egopt, the emission maxima, λf, and the fluorescence quantum yields, Φf. Most of the polymers were obtained in high yields (70 to 90%). Degrees of polymerization, Pn, of up to ∼50 have been achieved. The effective conjugation length is being attained already after two to three repeating units based on experimental results and theoretical calculations.28,40 The polymers are soluble in common organic solvents and are readily processed as thin films via drop casting, spin-coating and inkjet-printing.28,47–49 They are thermostable up to at least 300 °C and show lyotropic and thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior, as such their thin film properties (e.g. absorption and emission spectra,48 photovoltaic parameters43,50,51) are very sensitive to the film thickness.

Almost identical photophysical behavior in dilute chloroform solution is obtained for all polymers of each type irrespective of the nature of attached side groups, except for anthracene-containing polymers AnE-PV, where differences in the absorptive behavior were observed between polymers inclined to stack such as AnE-PVabab, -aeae, -adad, -statstat and those with no stacking inclination such as AnE-PVbaba, -bbbb.28,43 The polymers exhibit high extinction coefficients between 30000 and 120000 M−1 cm−1. They are highly luminescent in solution as reflected by a high fluorescence quantum yield, Φf, between 50 and 90% obtained for CN-free materials.28 CN-containing materials 40 and 41 have solution Φf values below 40%.47
Increasing the number of side chains from four-fold substituted polymers 29 (Pnn/nn′) (λa = 450 nm, λf = 490 nm) to eight-fold substituted polymers 30 (λa = 470 nm, λf = 520 nm) leads to a 20 nm red shift of the absorption and 30 nm of the emission.35
The fully substituted polymers of types 30, 31 and 32 are characterized by nearly identical emissive behavior, despite the differences in their phenylene-ethynylene segments, which evidences identical fluorophore systems located around the lower energy alkoxy-substituted phenylene-vinylene segments of the various type of polymers as confirmed by fluorescent kinetics measurements and quantum chemical calculations.28,40,46
A red shift of the absorption and emission is initiated through the insertion of electron rich anthracene or thiophene units within the conjugated backbone of polymers 36 (AnE-PV) (λa = 550 nm, λf = 580 nm), 37 (λa = 475 nm, λf = 535 nm) and 38 (λa = 490 nm, λf = 540 nm) as compared to polymers 30.43,45
The position of the thiophene ring in the polymeric backbone has no influence on the spectroscopic properties of the polymers, which can be seen i.e. by comparing 38c (λa = 490 nm, λf = 542 nm) and 39 (λa = 490 nm, λf = 546 nm). The anthracene-containing polymers, in contrast, reveal position dependent optical properties. A constant bathochromic absorption shift of 50 nm was observed going from 34 (λa = 450 nm, λf = 580 nm), where anthracene is surrounded by two double bonds, to 35 (λa = 500 nm, λf = 590 nm), where anthracene is at the bridge between a triple bond and a double bond, as well as from 35 to 36 (λa = 550 nm, λf = 580 nm) where anthracene is surrounded by two triple bonds. The emissive behavior is however almost identical in all three type of anthracene based polymers.41
The CN-containing polymers 40 (λa = 427 nm, λf = 494 nm) and 41 (λa = 456 nm, λf = 536 nm) exhibit a blue shift of the solution absorption as compared to their CN-free counterparts 29 and 31, respectively, which is due to steric hindrances resulting from the insertion of CN groups into the vinylene moieties.47
Contrary to the solution, where the effects of side chains on the photophysical behavior of the polymers are insignificant, the solid state photophysical properties (absorption, emission, photoluminescence quantum yield, fluorescence kinetics, photoconductivity) are dependent on the size, geometry (linear or branched), number and position of the grafted alkoxy side groups35 as well as on the film thickness.48 Exchanging, for example, the position of the side chains (compare polymer P18/8 with polymer P8/18) not only leads to a change in colour from orange to yellow but also to a significant change in all the photophysical parameters.28,35
In general, there is a red shift going from solution to thin film absorption due to enhanced backbone coplanarity and aggregate formation in the solid state, except for the anthracene-containing polymer 34, which showed no difference in its thin film absorption (λa = 450 nm, λf = 607 nm) and solution absorption (λa = 450 nm, λf = 580 nm). A strong steric hindrance caused by the incorporation of anthracene between two double bonds is already present in solution and dominates the absorption properties also in the film.41 However, a red shift of the emission of ∼20 nm was observed. Interestingly, polymer 34 shows the so-called CN-PPV effect41which is characterized by higher photoluminescence quantum yield in the thin film (11%) than in dilute solution (3%).41 The same trend was observed for the CN-PPE-PPVs 40 and 41, which exhibit higher Φf-values (>50%) in thin film than in solution, due to considerable contribution of aggregate emission.41,47
Total fluorescence quenching was observed in thin films of 37a bearing solely linear side chains, which was ascribed to the presence of two thiophene rings (i.e. heavy atom effects) and very strong π–π interchain interactions.44,45
The incorporation of anthracene in AnE-PV provides a band gap energy of 1.90 eV, making this class of materials good candidates in bulk heterojunction solar cells as demonstrated below.43
Electrochemical studies reveal, in all cases, lower-lying LUMO and HOMO energy levels than for instance MDMO-PPV,28,52 clear evidence of enhanced electron affinity, making most of these PAE-PAV materials potential candidates for low turn on voltage light emitting diodes as shown below.
3. Electroluminescence studies
In addition to enhanced electron affinity most PAE-PAV systems exhibit high thin film fluorescence quantum yields, which moreover favours their use as emissive layers in organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices. Electroluminescence studies were carried out with polymers of types 29 (Pnn/nn′), 30, 31, 32, 40 and 41.28,36,37,40,46,47,53–55 The respective polymers and their EL data are listed in Table 2. EL studies on PPE-PPVs, so far reported, were carried out by Karasz’s group in Amherst and Neher’s group in Potsdam as well as Meerholz’s group in Cologne. The first two groups used the same device configuration, i.e. glass substrate/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Ca/Al (here ITO denotes indium tin oxide, as transparent electrode, and PEDOT:PSS refers to poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrenesulfonate, a commercially available conducting polymer), while Meerholz’s group evaporated Ag on top of Ca anodes instead of Al in their devices. The active layer of the devices from Cologne were both spin-coated and inkjet-printed. Devices from spin-coated films showed better performance than those from inkjet printed ones.37Chloroform was exclusively used as solvent in Amherst during the device preparation, while the groups in Potsdam and Cologne primarily used chlorobenzene,36,46,47 but also chloroform in a few cases for the purpose of comparison.36 The different device preparation methods brought some differences in the EL parameters. For instance, higher turn-on voltages (≥6 V) were obtained from Amherst devices while lower values (2 to 3 V) were obtained from Potsdam and Cologne.36,37,46,47 However higher EL efficiencies were achieved from Amherst devices.

Polymers bearing long linear octadecyloxy or branched 2-ethylhexyloxy side groups exhibited improved OLED performance because of their enhanced solubility, film-forming capability and optimized film morphology. The long linear or branched side chains are also inhibiting the interchain interactions thereby enhancing exciton confinement and EL efficiency.40,46,54,55
Raising the applied voltage led in some cases to a blue shift of the emission maxima, whereby the largest voltage-dependent blue shift of ca. 100 nm was obtained from polymers denoted Pnnn/8 in the cases where n = 16, 17, 18, 19.37,46 For instance, at low voltages P18/8 emits red at 650 nm. Increasing the applied bias from 3 V to 11 V the emission can be blue shifted to about 550 nm (green).37,46 The EL blue shift was explained by Joule heating in the LED, which results in thermochromism.56 This phenomenon might also result from band gap distribution in the polymer.57 At higher applied voltage, the high-band-gap (shorter) segments in the polymer might contribute slightly more to the emission.
In summary, the EL colors of the polymers of type Pnn/nn′ varied from orange to green depending on the side chains combination. EL colors of the polymers Pnnn/8 (n = 16, 17, 18, 19) tend to shift from orange or yellow to green with increasing bias voltages. Such variation of EL color was not observed with the other types of PPE-PPV systems.
4. Photovoltaic studies
Due to their appropriate energy levels and the high absorption coefficients (105 M−1 cm−1) these polymers are interesting candidates as donor components (29, 31–39) in polymer-PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)42–45,51,52,58–64 and polymer-Vinazene (2-vinyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazole)65 bulk heterojunction solar cells as well as acceptor components (40, 41) in polymer-polymer blends.47,50

Solar cell devices of configuration: PET foil/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM (1:3 wt. ratio)/Al60 or glass substrate/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM (1:1, 1:2, 1:3 or 1:4) wt. ratio)/LiF/Al52,58,59,63 were fabricated using polymers P18/18, P18/8, 31a–d, 32b, 33b, 34, 35, AnE-PVabab, 37a–c, 38a–c and 39. Photovoltaic studies were carried out with all four polymers of type 31 to verify the concept that open circuit voltage (VOC) of conjugated polymer-fullerene photovoltaic cells is governed by the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the polymers (demonstrated by Lee et al.66). Solar cells of configuration glass substrate/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM (1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 wt. ratio)/Al were recently designed based on AnE-PVabab, -adad, -aeae, -baba, -bbbb, -cccc, and -statstat,43,51 in order to correlate the ππ-stacking ability to the photovoltaic performance. The variation of the ππ-stacking is achieved by grafting of either linear and/or branched side chains.
The photovoltaic parameters of the various cells are given in Tables 3 and 4, namely the open circuit voltage, VOC, the short circuit current, JSC, the filling factor, FF, defined as FF=(Jmax × Vmax)/(Jsc × VOC), with Jmax and Vmax corresponding to the maximum power point, and the power conversion efficiency, ηAM1.5[%] = (Pout/Plight) × 100% = (FF × VOC × JSC/Plight) × 100%.

In addition to other influential factors, such as molecular-weight distribution,67 it was proven that the PV parameters depend on both the backbone conjugation pattern and the side chain.44,45,52 For instance the VOC increases with decreasing side chain bulkiness, as shown in the case of polymers 31a–d and AnE-PVs, given the fact that the HOMO energy levels are almost the same in each class of materials. The correlation of VOC of polymer solar cells with their HOMO levels67 applies in addition to the influence of the hydrophobic alkyl or alkoxy side chains bulkiness. Decreasing the side chain bulkiness enhances the miscibility between donor and acceptor, as was observed in the case of the thiophene-containing polymers 38a–c, where a gradual decrease of the side chain bulkiness from 38a through 38b to 39c is accompanied by a significant increase of the short circuit current, JSC, from ca. 2.5 mA cm−2 through 3.7 mA cm−2 to 5.2 mA cm−2, and consequently an enhancement of the energy conversion efficiency, ηAM1.5, from ca. 1.2% through 1.7% to 1.8% was observed. This can be ascribed to an extended donor–acceptor interfacial area, which was evidenced by AFM topology pictures showing a constant reduction of the nanoscale cluster size of the active layer from 38a through 38b to 38c.28
Systematic studies carried out with anthracene-containing polymers AnE-PV43,51,68,69 demonstrated the same trend observed with polymers 31a–d with respect to the VOC (Table 4). It increases with decreasing side chain bulkiness. For instance, in the case of polymer:PCBM (1:1) blends, polymers bearing longer dodecyloxy (AnE-PVaeae) or decyloxy (AnE-PVadad) side chains lead to low VOC values of ∼650 mV. Polymers bearing octyloxy and/or 2-ethylhexyloxy groups, AnE-PVabab, -bbbb, -baba, -statstat, yield VOC values of around 800 mV, whereas AnE-PVcccc having the lowest side chain density due to the grafting of methoxy groups demonstrate the highest VOC of ∼900 mV.
Keeping the side chain volume fraction similar as in AnE-PVabab, -baba, -bbbb and -statstat, and varying the ππ-stacking distance, dππ, it was shown that the charge carrier mobility, μhole, increases with increasing dππ, such that higher hole mobilities of the order 10−4 were extracted from AnE-PVstatstat having the largest dππ and from the amorphous polymers AnE-PVbaba, -bbbb showing no stacking at all.51 The highest μhole value of 5.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s was obtained for AnE-PVstatstat which combines both the largest dππ and the highest degree of ordering as revealed by X-ray scattering measurements.69 The best solar cell performance was also achieved with AnE-PVstatstat. State-of-the-art efficiency of ∼3.8% for both PPE- and PPV-based materials has been obtained. From these studies one can tentatively correlate ππ-stacking distance, dππ, and photovoltaic performance in these polymers. For instance, in the case of a 1:1 ratio of polymer:PCBM, one can deduce an increase of the energy conversion efficiency, η, with increasing dππ, going from AnE-PVadad (dππ = 0.380 nm, η = 1.52%) or from AnE-PVcccc (dππ = 0.379 nm, η = 1.02%) through AnE-PVabab (dππ = 0.386 nm, η = 2.44%) to AnE-PVstatstat (dππ = 0.393 nm, η = 3.77%). The photovoltage is the major contribution to this increase in efficiency.
The polymers exhibiting the highest efficiency reported so far consist of rigid thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and benzodithiophene units (inducing backbone coplanarity) which are mostly substituted with branched2-ethylhexyl side chains (presumably reducing the stacking ability).70,71

          Polymer-Vinazene solar cells
The influence of annealing conditions on the active layer morphology and photovoltaic performance was reported in 2007 by Kietzke et al based on the anthracene containing polymer AnE-PVabab58 as donor material with 4,7-bis(2-(1-hexyl-4,5-dicyanoimidazol-2-yl)vinyl)benzo[c]1,2,5-thiadiazole (termed Vinazene) as acceptor component.65 For the chemical structure see Fig. 3.

Although the PL measurements of the pre-annealed blend indicated an efficient separation of the photogenerated excitons, the resulting device exhibited a rather low IPCE of <3% suggesting the absence of a percolating path for the separated charge carriers to their corresponding electrodes. After annealing of the active layer at 80 °C for 10 min prior to anode deposition, an IPCE value of 12.2% was obtained, 4× improvement as compared to the non-annealed devices (Table 5).

The increased efficiency after annealing was attributed to a change in the thin-film nanostructure. This was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) recorded images of the blend layers.
The non-annealed layer exhibited a fine scale separation in the nanometre range. This fine phase separation enabled efficient dissociation of the photogenerated excitons at the interface, however, most likely a percolating path for the separated charge carriers was missing.
After annealing at 80 °C, the phase separation increased, but the film appeared to be homogeneously mixed with feature sizes in the few tens of nanometres. Since the phase separation is still in the range of the exciton diffusion length, which is estimated to be between 5 and 20 nm, most photogenerated excitons can still reach the heterojunction interface.

Annealing at 100 °C produced agglomerates extending over several hundred of nanometres accompanied with high surface roughness. The domains are bigger than the exciton diffusion length, explaining the drop in efficiency.65

          Polymer-polymer solar cells
Choosing poly[2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene-vinylene-2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene] (M3EH-PPV)31b (Fig. 4) as the donor component, polymer-polymer photovoltaic studies were carried out using CN-PPE-PPVpolymers 40 and 41 as acceptor components. M3EH-PPV shows good solubility in polar solvents like chlorobenzene but very low solubility in less polar solvents like p-xylene. Thus, it was possible to construct a double layer device by spin-coating the electron-accepting polymers 40 and 41 dissolved in p-xylene on top of a M3EH-PPV layer. Solar cell devices of configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al were designed, the active layer being either a blend or a bilayer.
 Fig. 4  Chemical structure of M3EH-PPV. 
Solar cells based on a blend of M3EH-PPV and 40 (1:1 by weight) achieved an external quantum efficiency of 26%. The open circuit voltage of these devices reached 1.5 V. Similarly high VOC of 1.5 V and IPCE of 16% were obtained for M3EH-PPV:41 blends. As a result, the energy efficiencies under white light are 0.80% and 0.62% for 40 and 41, respectively (Table 6).

All bilayer solar cells were characterized by spectrally resolved measurements of the IPCE and by recording the current–voltage characteristics under white light illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5) to mimic the solar radiation. The influence of the layer thickness of CN-PPE-PPVcopolymers on the IPCE was dramatic. The highest efficiencies of about 20% were found for very thin acceptor layer thickness around 7–8 nm. The VOC of the bilayer devices from 40 and 41 was 1.50 V which is 0.2 V higher than the VOC found for CN-ether-PPV based solar cells.50 However because of the small FF and the low IPCE, the energy efficiency is only 0.6% in both cases. This larger VOC of the CN-PPE-PPV-based devices can be ascribed to the smaller LUMO offset between the CN-PPE-PPVcopolymers and M3EH-PPV.
5. Conclusions
π-Conjugated and alkoxy-substituted PAE-PAVs have been synthesized using either Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons olefination reaction of arylene-ethynylene based dialdehydes with bisphosphonate esters or Knoevenagel reaction of the same dialdehydes with dinitriles. The polymers are thermostable up to around 300 °C and show lyotropic and thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior. Their characterization showed an enhanced electron affinity as compared to MDMO-PPV making them useful materials for the design of low threshold voltage OLED devices. Also a high open circuit voltage was observed in OPVs. The present state-of-the-art photovoltaic energy conversion efficiency of ∼3.8% for both PPE- and PPV-based materials has been achieved using anthracene-containing PPE-PPV. The same anthracene based polymers show outstanding electroluminescent features.
