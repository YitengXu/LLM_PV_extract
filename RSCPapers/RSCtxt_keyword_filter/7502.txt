    , Accepted 28th October 2019First published on 30th October 2019AbstractFabricating thin film solar cells on the light-trapping structures is an effective way to improve the absorption of the active layer. Here, we report a non-fullerene organic solar cell based on a PBDB-T:ITIC active layer, a wrinkled metal rear electrode, and a MoO3/Ag/ZnS front transparent electrode. Optical characterization shows that the wrinkled metal structure can remarkably increase the absorption of the active layer in a broadband range. The resulting device shows a power conversion efficiency of 8.2%, which increases by 4.6% compared to that of the flat counterpart. Apart from higher absorption, the improved performance can also be ascribed to the efficient charge transport and collection in the device due to the lower defect density, larger interfacial area, and smaller active layer thickness. A device with a power conversion efficiency of 10.19% based on the flat ITO/glass substrate is also achieved. Accordingly, a power conversion efficiency of about 10.66% is predicted under the condition where the wrinkled rear electrode and the ITO front electrode are employed. In addition, the power conversion efficiency of the wrinkled device could increase by about 50.48% compared to that of the flat device under an incident angle of 60 °C, illustrating that a better omnidirectional ability is achieved.
Introduction
Solar cells based on organic materials have attracted increasing attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and low-cost fabrication procedures.1,2 Besides, ultrathin organic films can introduce features including flexibility and light weight, expanding the application scope of this kind of solar cell to wearable and portable devices.3–5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells has been improved dramatically in recent years by carefully designing the absorption spectrum and optimizing the mobility of the active layer.6–11 However, there remain opportunities to improve PCE through light trapping. Furthermore, it is hoped that solar cells will show omnidirectional light-trapping characteristics, especially when they are used in wearable and portable devices.12–14 Because the incident angle of light in these devices will be randomly and frequently changed in different situation. It is reported that for a solar cell fabricated on a planar glass substrate, 4% of the incident light at normal incidence is reflected at the air–glass interface. This value can go up to 30% if all incident angles are taken into consideration.15,16
Although light trapping has been proven beneficial in silicon solar cells,17 it seems that it is very difficult to form such structures on the surface of organic films because they are soft and thin materials and are generally fabricated by solution processes like spin coating or printing.18 Moreover, most of the organic solar cells are fabricated on planar glass substrates, which also hinders the design of light-trapping structures. As a result, a feasible way to introduce the light-trapping effect in organic solar cells is to fabricate solar cells on top of light-trapping structures. Several efforts have been made to study various structures, including micro-/nanocones, micro-/nanopyramids, nanowires, nanopillars, nanoholes, and nanospheres.19–21 Jeong et al. reported a solar cell with silicon nanowire arrays, which showed an enhanced PCE because of the good antireflection effect.22 Also, Kim et al. designed a V-shaped structure to increase the light absorption of the active layer, and revealed that the efficiency of the device was related to the angle of the structure.23 Although some of these kinds of anti-reflection structures have shown omnidirectional light-trapping characteristics, the sharp edges and corners in these structures were harmful to thin film formation, which resulted in poor surface coverage and high defect density, especially when nanowires or nanoholes are used.24 This will lead to severe recombination in the active layer and compromise device performance.
Apart from enhancing the absorption of the active layer with a nanostructured substrate, some researchers also used the plasmonic resonance and scattering effect of metal nanoparticles to improve the light absorption in the active layer.25 For example, some studies showed boosted solar cell performance by introducing the plasmonic resonance and light scattering of Ag or Au nanoparticles (AgNPs or AuNPs).26 The resonance condition will be established when the frequency of light matches the natural frequency of conduction electrons oscillating in metallic nanoparticles, causing the significant enhancement and confinement of the electric fields near metallic nanoparticles. However, the metallic nanoparticles embedded in the active layer or transport layer will also easily introduce defects and thermal/heat loss effect.
Generally, it is hoped that optical improvements should not diminish the electrical performance of the device.16,27,28 In order to further improve the efficiency, it is still necessary to optimize the properties of the active layer systematically and nano-structuralizing the corresponding thin film could be a good choice. Therefore, a light-trapping structure without sharp edges and corners is necessary to ensure minimal defects and recombination in the active layer. Our previous work has proven that the light-trapping effect of a wrinkled substrate could enable the thin active layer to possess a high absorption efficiency, which will contribute to the high charge separation efficiency because of shorter required charge diffusion distances.29 Besides, in this cell configuration, a decrease in the defect density and an increase in the interfacial area between the active layer and adjacent contacts have also assisted charge separation and transport.
In this work, a wrinkled light-trapping structure was used in the non-fullerene organic solar cell based on the PBDB-T:ITIC system. A wrinkled metal film with efficient, broadband and omnidirectional light-harvesting abilities was designed on the substrate for high efficiency organic solar cells. The charge dynamics has been investigated to reveal the beneficial effects of the structure on the electrical properties of the device. Device performances under different angles of incident light have also been evaluated for practical applications.
Experimental
Wrinkled surface fabrication
Plain glass substrates and ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm size were cleaned ultrasonically using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in sequence for 10 min each. Subsequently, they were subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min. We deposited 15 nm thick silver thin films on the surface of glass sheets by a thermal evaporation method. Then the samples were annealed at 500 °C in air for 30 min. In this process, the silver thin films were changed to AgNP arrays and the thickness of the film determined the size of AgNPs. To obtain a metal wrinkled surface and cathode, we have continued to evaporate 100 nm Al and 40 nm Au on the top of the AgNP arrays.
Device fabrication
Poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) were purchased from 1-Material Inc. Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.9%), ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.5%) and 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, >99.8%) were purchased from Aladdin. All the solvents were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All the materials and solvents were used as received. The donor:acceptor blends PBDB-T:ITIC with 1:1 (wt%) ratio were dissolved in a mixed solution of chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane (99.5:0.5, vol%) with a total concentration of 15 mg mL−1. The ZnO precursor was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (1 g) and ethanolamine (0.28 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (10 mL) under vigorous stirring for 12 h for the hydrolysis reaction in air.
Our wrinkled device structure was designed as Glass/AgNPs/Al/Au/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag/ZnS. Firstly, ZnO used as the electron transport layer was deposited onto the as-prepared wrinkled surface substrate by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 1 min. The ZnO films were heated at 200 °C for 1 h in air. Then, the organic blend PBDB-T:ITIC was deposited onto the wrinkled surface by spin-coating at a speed of 1800 rpm for 1 min. The film was dried at 100 °C for 10 min. Afterwards, 4 nm MoO3, 7 nm Ag and 7 nm ZnS film were evaporated onto the surface of the organic active layer respectively to form a transparent anode electrode. Meanwhile, the solar cells without wrinkled structures were prepared as reference devices using flat Al/Au substrates and ITO/glass substrates. The whole processes were carried out in a glove box with nitrogen and the active area of all the cells was 4 mm2, defined by using a shadow mask.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7401F). The reflectance, transmittance, and absorption spectra were obtained at room temperature using a ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Persee TU-1950), equipped with an integrating sphere. The glass substrate was used as the baseline to obtain the neat transmittance of the ITO and MoO3/Ag/ZnS films. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were obtained using a Keithley 2450 source measure unit under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The incident angle variation measurements were realized by tilting the solar cells. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a QEPVSI-b Measurement System (Newport). The impedance spectra (IS) measurement was performed using a CHI1660E electrochemical workstation under dark conditions, with an oscillating voltage of 10 mV and a frequency scanning range of 10 Hz to 1 M Hz. The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of organic films were performed using a time-correlated single-photon counting system (Edinburgh F900) under an excitation light of 660 nm.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic diagram of our wrinkled organic solar cell with an inverted structure: Glass/AgNPs/Al/Au/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag/ZnS. In contrast to the traditional planar ITO/glass substrate, here the glass substrate with a wrinkled metal film was used to form a wrinkled organic solar cell. The wrinkled metal film not only acts as a light-trapping structure but also as the cathode electrode of the device. Since the metal film is opaque, the light should enter from the anode side and a transparent electrode should be formed. Here, we mainly used ultrathin dielectric/metal/dielectric film MoO3/Ag/ZnS.

To form a proper wrinkled structure, a AgNP array on the glass substrate should be introduced. The function of the AgNP arrays in our work is to support the Al/Au film to form a wrinkled surface. So the size distribution and the surface coverage of AgNPs will determine the morphology of the wrinkled metal film. Fig. 1b shows the surface SEM image of the AgNP array obtained from the 15 nm thick Ag film by annealing. We can see that AgNPs are spherical in shape and monodisperse in distribution, which will make them suitable to form wrinkled metal films. The average diameter and edge distance of the obtained AgNPs are approximately 138 nm and 157 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. S1.† These values are in the same order as the typical thickness value of the organic active layer, which will also benefit the formation of fully covered and wrinkled organic films.

Fig. 1c shows the SEM image of the wrinkled metal film fabricated by depositing Al/Au films on AgNP arrays. It can be clearly seen that the AgNPs are fully covered by the film. The film structure shows textured morphology, which will confer oblique light incidence and optical scattering abilities for increasing the absorption in the active layer. Moreover, the metal film shows a smoothly cambered surface without sharp points and edges, which will be beneficial for the deposition of high-quality organic films.

Fig. 1d shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the entire structure of the solar cell. It can be seen that the organic film has covered the whole metal film surface to form a wrinkled structure. This result also illustrates that the wettability of the substrate is suitable for spin coating the organic precursor, which will benefit the formation of uniform, conformal and pinhole-free films.
In order to characterize the light-trapping effect of wrinkled structures, UV-vis spectrophotometry measurements were performed. Fig. 2 shows the reflection spectra of wrinkled and flat Al/Au films. The absorption spectrum of the PBDB-T:ITIC blend film is also shown for comparison. It is clearly observed that the reflectance of the wrinkled substrate decreased by more than 10% in the whole visible wavelength range compared to the flat structure, indicating that this structure can enhance the light absorption in the PBDB-T:ITIC active layer mainly due to the longer optical path.

Based on the improvement in optical properties, we speculated that there was a similar PCE enhancement in the wrinkled solar cell. In order to obtain the best performance of wrinkled and flat solar cells based on metal film substrates, we have optimized the thickness of the active layer by varying the spin-coating speed. The J–V curves of flat and wrinkled devices have been measured under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding spin-coating speed-dependent J–V results are shown in Fig. S2.† It is found that the best PCEs of wrinkled and flat solar cells are obtained under the speed of 1400 rpm and 1800 rpm, respectively. The J–V curves and detailed parameters such as short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and best PCEs of the devices are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, respectively. It is revealed that the solar cells based on wrinkled and flat structures show the best PCE of 8.20% and 7.84%, respectively. The PCE improvement has reached up to 4.6%, which can be mainly ascribed to the obvious improvement in JSC from 14.08 mA cm−2 of the flat reference solar cell to 14.69 mA cm−2 of the wrinkled solar cell.

The IPCE spectra of the best wrinkled and flat solar cells are shown in Fig. 3b. It is observed that the wrinkled device shows higher IPCE value compared to the flat device across the 300–800 nm region, confirming more efficient light absorption and charge transport in the active layer. However, an obvious reduction in the curve can be observed in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 500 nm. This can be related to the transmittance of the MoO3/Ag/ZnS transparent electrode, which is shown in Fig. S3.† We can see that there is a trough in the same wavelength range of transmittance spectra, which will lead to the incident light energy loss due to the high parasitic absorption of the electrode. Surprisingly, an obvious improvement can be observed around the wavelength of 300 nm in both IPCE curves of wrinkled and flat solar cells compared to that of solar cells based on ITO/glass substrates.30,31 As shown in Fig. S3,† it may be ascribed to higher transmittance of our transparent electrode at this wavelength compared to the ITO/glass substrates. However, the relatively lower average transmittance of the transparent electrode in the whole range still limits the whole PCE of the wrinkled device. Hence, a high-quality transparent electrode like the ITO film may be required to obtain an even higher JSC.
In order to predict the PCE of the wrinkled PBDB-T:ITIC solar cell based on the ITO front transparent electrode, flat solar cells based on ITO/glass substrates were also fabricated and characterized. As shown in Fig. S4,† an optimized device with a PCE of 10.19% and a JSC of 16.87 mA cm−2 has been obtained. Based on these results and the PCE improvement of the wrinkled solar cell, it is reasonable to predict that the PCE of the wrinkled solar cell could reach up to about 10.66% if we can replace our MoO3/Ag/ZnS transparent electrode with the sputtered ITO film. However, the biggest challenge now is the sputtering damage on the organic layer during ITO deposition, which will be the subject of our next work.
For better understanding the effect of the wrinkled light-trapping structure on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells, the charge generation and dissociation properties were particularly investigated, by following the reported method.32,33Fig. 4a shows the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff). Herein, Jph is defined by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is determined by Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Vbias is the applied voltage. Therefore, Veff determines the electric field in the bulk region and thereby determines the carrier transport and photocurrent extraction. It can be seen in Fig. 4a that Jph reaches a saturation (Jsat) at Veff ≧ 1 V. The saturation current density (Jsat) can be derived directly from the Jph–Veff curves. The ratio of the Jph at the maximum power point with the Jsat represents the carrier extraction efficiency of the solar cell. A Jph/Jsat value of 1 means that all photogenerated excitons are dissociated to free charges and collected by the corresponding electrodes. It has been calculated that there are 83.3% of all photogenerated carriers collected by the electrode at the maximum power point of the wrinkled solar cell, which is higher than 82.1% of the flat solar cell. This observation indicates that the wrinkled structure could lead to efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge collection.
 Fig. 4  (a) Jph–Veff curves, (b) PL spectra, (c) TRPL curves, and (d) impedance spectra of the wrinkled and flat solar cells. 
In order to investigate the charge dynamics of the wrinkled solar cell, we performed the PL and TRPL of PBDB-T:ITIC films on wrinkled and flat substrates. Fig. 4b shows the PL of the samples. The flat sample showed a strong PL emission with an emission peak at approximately 775 nm. However, the PL emission is markedly quenched in the wrinkled sample, suggesting an efficient charge transport from the active layer to the charge collection layer. The TRPL result could further demonstrate how fast this quenching process happens. As shown in Fig. 4c, the carrier lifetimes of the two samples were obtained by fitting the PL decay curves with a standard bi-exponential model. The carrier lifetime of the wrinkled film is 0.65 ns, which is smaller than 0.89 ns of the flat film. These results suggest that excellent charge–transfer property is achieved by enlarging the interface area and reducing the active layer thickness, which will favor the photocurrent generation.
To gain more insight into the charge transport at the interface of the solar cell, IS measurements were carried out in the wrinkled and flat devices. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4d, with the corresponding equivalent circuit model and fitted semicircles, which are estimated to be directly proportional to the resistances of charge extraction.34,35 It is clearly observed that the resistance of the wrinkled solar cell is lower than that of the flat solar cell, indicating a more efficient charge transfer. This observation further confirms that the larger interface area and the thinner active layer will facilitate efficient charge transfer throughout the whole film in the solar cell.
It is important that the solar cells possess omnidirectional light-trapping ability for their application in wearable and portable devices, or even in power station to sufficiently absorb sunlight at off-normal incidence without an expensive solar tracking system.36,37 In order to evaluate the omnidirectional light-trapping ability of our wrinkled solar cells, we have characterized their incident light angle-dependent performances. A series of J–V measurements were performed on wrinkled and flat solar cells at different incident angles varying from 0° (normal incidence) to 80° with a 20° interval. The J–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. S5.† The corresponding JSC and PCE as a function of the incident angle of sunlight are shown in Fig. 5. We can see that the JSC of both solar cells decreases when the incident angle increases from 0°to 80°. However, the JSC of the flat solar cell decreases more rapidly than that of the wrinkled solar cell. Under an incident angle of 60° (the daytime at 8 and 16 h), we can see that a 50.48% improvement of PCE has been achieved for the wrinkled solar cell compared with its flat counterpart, which illustrates that our wrinkled solar cell has better omnidirectional light-trapping ability even at a high incident angle. The efficiency enhancement of the wrinkled device is due to the reduction of reflectance and the increase of the effective surface area of the solar cell. It should be noted that owing to the isotropic orientation of the wrinkled structure, such efficiency enhancement is thus available in all directions, which is particularly applicable to various wearable and portable devices.
 Fig. 5  Dependence of the PCEs of wrinkled and flat solar cells on incident angle and the relative PCE improvement of the wrinkled solar cells. 
We found that a lower annealing temperature of the Ag film could result in non-spherical AgNPs (Fig. S6†). Compared to the spherical AgNPs, non-spherical AgNPs have more sharp edges, which are similar to other sharp antireflection structures. In order to explore the influence of sharp structures on the defects of the solar cell, we utilized a light-trapping structure based on this kind of non-spherical AgNP in the PBDBT:ITIC system with the same device construction to modulate the commonly used sharp light-trapping structures. In order to reveal the influence of the defects on recombination, the dependences of JSC and VOC on light intensity (I) were investigated. The variations of VOC and JSC as a function of light intensity are shown in Fig. 6 and relevant J–V curves are shown in Fig. S7.† The relationship between JSC and light intensity I follows the relation JSC ∝ Iα, where α is the recombination index reflecting the recombination probability.38,39 The α value should be 1 if all charge carriers are collected before recombination and it is smaller than 1 for the devices with the bimolecular charge recombination. As shown in Fig. 6a, α value in the devices was calculated to be 0.984 and 0.975 for the spherical AgNP-based devices and non-spherical AgNP-based devices, respectively. This phenomenon suggests that bimolecular recombination loss was minimized in spherical AgNP-based wrinkled solar cells.
 Fig. 6  (a) JSC and (b) VOC of solar cells based on spherical and non-spherical AgNP arrays as a function of light intensity (symbols), together with linear fits to the data (solid lines). 
Under the open-circuit conditions, all carriers recombine within the cell. The slope of VOC − ln(I) represents the charge–recombination property of solar cells under the open-circuit conditions. It is reported that the monomolecular recombination or trap-assisted recombination is predominant if the slope is close to 2.0 kT e−1.40,41 As shown in Fig. 6b, the spherical AgNP-based devices and the non-spherical AgNP-based devices show logarithmic dependence on light intensity with a slope of 1.52 kT e−1 and 1.95 kT e−1, respectively. Obviously, the non-spherical sample shows a slope value close to 2 kT e−1 and the spherical sample shows a lower slope close to 1 kT e−1, implying that less trap-assisted recombination exists in the spherical AgNP-based solar cells. The poor morphology in the non-spherical AgNPs will introduce more trapping defects in devices, and thus suffer from more trap-assisted recombination. This result proves that our smoothly wrinkled Al/Au film will facilitate the formation of a uniform and continuous active layer, which will introduce fewer defects in the devices compared to other sharp nanostructures.
Conclusions
In summary, we introduced the wrinkled metal film as a light-trapping structure to improve the device performance of inverted no-fullerene organic solar cells. A PCE improvement from 7.84% of the flat solar cell to 8.20% of the wrinkled structure has been achieved and a PCE of 10.66% in ITO transparent-based wrinkled solar cells has been predicted. We found that a reduced defect density and improved absorption in the active layer have been successfully obtained to boost JSC. In addition, it is proved that the larger interface area and thinner active layer thickness in the wrinkled solar cells could facilitate the charge transport. Furthermore, the wrinkled light-trapping structure provides a feasible way to fabricate efficient organic or even perovskite solar cells with lower defect density and better omnidirectional ability, which is of great significance for the actual use of the devices.
