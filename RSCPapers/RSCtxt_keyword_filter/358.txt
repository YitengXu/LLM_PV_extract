    , Accepted 17th July 2019First published on 17th July 2019AbstractSingle-component organic solar cells (OSCs) use one conjugated material as a photo-active layer, which can enhance the stability of cells and simplify the fabrication process compared to two-component OSCs. Among single-component conjugated materials, block conjugated polymers can form lamellar structures that are recognized as the ideal structures for OSCs, while it is difficult to tune the nanophase separation in double-cable conjugated polymers. In this work, for the first time, we show that, by rationally designing chemical structures and post treatment, double-cable polymers are also able to form lamellar structures. This was realized by synthesizing a double-cable conjugated polymer containing both a crystalline conjugated backbone and perylene bisimide side units. When the high boiling point solvent dichlorobenzene with slow evaporation speed is used, the polymers have enough time to self-assemble into well-ordered nanostructures. Therefore, the double-cable polymer formed lamellar structures with a lamellar distance of ∼70 Å and a π–π distance of ∼3.5 Å. These ordered structures facilitate the charge transport and result in improved photocurrent and power conversion efficiency compared to other disordered nanostructures.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their characteristics of flexibility, light weight, low cost, easy preparation process and semi-transparency, which can be potentially applied in large-area flexible devices.1 Photo-active layers that are responsible for harvesting light to generate excitons and then be separated into free charges usually contain two components, namely an electron donor and an electron acceptor.2,3 The so-called bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs with mixed donors and acceptors in the photo-active layers represent the most successful structures in OSCs, in which high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 15% in single-junction devices have been achieved.4–7 However, BHJ OSCs also show some drawbacks, such as instability and complicated solution processes.8,9 Due to the miscibility of the donor and the acceptor, they tend to form self-aggregated structures during long-term application under heat and light, which destroys the optimized morphology, thus lowering the performance.10 In addition, two-component systems involve complicated optimization processes, including the ratio of the donor and the acceptor, solvent, additive and post treatment, which increase the fabrication cost.11,12 In this respect, it is an important task to explore single-component photo-active layers due to the absence of miscibility issues which can significantly improve the stability of OSCs.13–16 In addition, photo-active layers with a single-component can simplify the fabrication process. However, single-component OSCs (SCOSCs) received much less attention than two-component OSCs, and their PCEs have always been below 5%.13,17
In the early stage of SCOSCs, several dyes were applied as photo-active layers, but they showed poor performance.18–21 After the report of the BHJ concept,2 researchers started to construct single-component conjugated materials by incorporating donor and acceptor moieties into one molecule. Nowadays, there are mainly three kinds of single-component materials: block copolymers,22–24 including rod to rod and rod to coil structures, double-cable conjugated polymers17,25,26 and molecular dyads.27–31 Block conjugated polymers have the potential to realize lamellar structures that are recognized as the ideal structures in OSCs.32–34 Therefore, many conjugated building blocks have been incorporated into block polymers, in which PCEs close to 4% have been obtained.35,36 Double-cable conjugated polymers with a donor polymer backbone and acceptor side units provide PCEs above 5%37–39 and also molecular dyads can achieve PCEs over 2%.40–42 Although many efforts have been involved in developing new single-component conjugated materials and understanding their charge transport mechanism, the study of SCOSCs is lagging far behind that of two-component OSCs.
We are interested in double-cable conjugated polymers since they can be structurally engineered from the conjugated backbone and aromatic side units. In particular, there are large numbers of conjugated polymers with “donor–acceptor” structures and non-fullerene materials that can be incorporated into double-cable polymers if rationally synthetic methods are employed, so that distinct optical and electrical properties can be obtained.43–54 However, it is highly challenging to control and understand the nanophase separation in double-cable polymers, which is the key factor limiting the photovoltaic performance in SCOSCs. In general, during the film formation process, the polymer backbones with a strong π–π interaction will aggregate at first, and then electron-deficient side units have to follow the movement of conjugated backbones due to the covalently linked nature. As a consequence, aromatic side units have the difficulty in forming ordered nanostructures, which could hamper the electron transport in SCOSCs and result in severe charge recombination. Therefore, it is important to find a way to control the nanophase separation in double-cable polymers toward efficient SCOSCs.
In this work, we develop a new double-cable conjugated polymer PTPBI for SCOSCs (Fig. 1a), wherein a solvent annealing (SA) method was applied to realize the lamellar structures in it. The idea starts from using a highly crystalline conjugated backbone, poly(bis(2-butyloctyl)[2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene]-3′,4′′-dicarboxylate) (PDCBT) as a polythiophene derivative,55 and a crystalline side unit perylene bisimide (2,9-di(undecan-6-yl)anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone, PBI) as an acceptor (Fig. 1b and c). We envision that, although the large aromatic side units will destroy the nanostructure of the double-cable polymer, the strong crystallization of both backbone and side units can provide another chance to form ordered structures if a rational post treatment method is employed. In this work, we apply three solvents, chlorobenzene (CB) with diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive, ortho-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and DCB with 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN), to fabricate PTPBI thin films. DCB as a high boiling point solvent can provide enough time for PTPBI to form ordered structures. We will provide systematic studies about the effect of solvents on the nanostructures of double-cable polymers and also their photovoltaic performance in SCOSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for PTPBI are shown in Scheme 1. Similar procedures have been developed in our previous work,50,53,56 in which tetrabromo-compounds were used to synthesize the key monomer containing PBI side units.51 Herein, starting from compound M1, M2 could be obtained via alkylation, which was converted into M4via the Suzuki reaction. Tetrabromo-compound M5 was then obtained by adding NBS into M4, and then reacting with M6 to afford monomer M7. PTPBI was then obtained via Stille polymerization with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) as a catalyst and toluene/dimethylformamide (DMF) (10:1) as solvent. PTPBI showed a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 61 kDa with a dispersity (ĐM) of 2.64. The donor polymer PDCBT was also synthesized according to the literature procedure,55 showing an Mn of 38 kDa and a ĐM of 2.29 (Table S1†). Both PTPBI and PDCBT show good solubility in chloroform, CB and DCB. PTPBI shows even better thermal stability than PDCBT as confirmed by thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis (Fig. S1†).

2.2. Optical, electrochemical and crystalline properties
The optical absorption spectra of PTPBI thin films spin-coated from different solvents are shown in Fig. 2a. PTPBI has the absorption contribution from the donor backbone (PDCBT) and the acceptor PBI51 (Fig. 2a). For PTPBI thin films fabricated from different solvents, they show a similar optical band gap (Eg) of 1.93 eV (Table S1†), but the absorption intensity at ∼620 nm is completely different. This shoulder should be attributed to the J-aggregation of polymer backbones, as shown in the absorption spectra of PDCBT.57 However, the intensity of this shoulder is significantly reduced in PTPBI thin films, indicating that the polymer backbones in PTPBI are less aggregated due to the steric hindrance of PBI units. Interestingly, the addition of high boiling point DCB and 1-CN further lowered the intensity. The frontier energy levels of these polymers were determined by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1.† The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PTPBI is −5.45 eV which lies in between PDCBT (−5.29 eV) and the acceptor PBI (−5.86 eV).

We use differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to study the crystallinity of PTPBI and PCDBT, as shown in Fig. 2b. The donor polymer PDCBT shows melting and crystallization temperatures of 266.42 °C and 245.34 °C during heating and cooling processes, while the temperatures decreased to 211.11 °C and 177.51 °C in the double-cable polymer PTPBI. We also note that the heat of crystallization calculated from the DSC thermograms in PTPBI is only slightly lower than that in PDCBT. This is an interesting observation since in most case the PBI side units could destroy the crystallization of the polymers. These results also indicate that PTPBI has the potential to realize well-ordered nanostructures.
2.3. Effect of the solvent on the nanophase separation of PTPBI
We then study the effect of the solvent on the nanostructure of PTPBI. Fig. 3a represents a typical procedure to fabricate PTPBI thin films in this work. PTPBI in DCB solution was dropped onto the cleaned substrate for rotation in 20 s so that the wet film containing DCB was formed due to its high boiling point. The substrate was then sealed in a container to ensure the slow evaporation of DCB for at least 30 min. The thin films were then used to make SCOSCs. PTPBI thin films from DCB/1-CN solution were also subjected to a similar procedure. PTPBI in CB/DIO (1%) can be easily dried during spin-coating, so there is no SA process. PDCBT thin films were also prepared by using CB/DIO and DCB/1-CN for comparison.
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic illustration of deposition of PTPBI thin films for SCOSCs. (i) PTPBI in DCB solution was drop-cast onto the substrate for rotation in 20 s, (ii) the wet film containing PTPBI and DCB was sealed in a container and DCB was slowly evaporated in 30 min and (iii) the dry film was used to fabricate solar cells. (b–e) GIWAXS patterns of PDCBT and PTPBI thin films fabricated from different solutions, and (f) the out-of-plane and (g) in-plane cuts of the corresponding GIWAXS patterns. 
The donor polymer PDCBT fabricated from CB/DIO (1%) showed a well-ordered structure, as confirmed by the highly ordered (h00) peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and the (010) peak in the in-plane (IP) direction from the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement (Fig. 3b).58 When using DCB/1-CN (1%) as the solvent in the SA process, PDCBT showed similar GIWAXS patterns (Fig. S3†). This confirms that PDCBT has the edge-on orientation with lamellar stacking perpendicular to the substrate. When introducing PBI side units into the polymer, the PTPBI thin film from CB/DIO showed completely different patterns, with a (h00) diffraction peak and a (010) peak in the OOP direction, indicating that PTPBI has a mixed orientation to the substrate (Fig. 3c). When performing the SA process with DCB, the (h00) peak is switched from the OOP to the IP direction, and meanwhile the intensity of the (010) peak in the OOP direction is significantly enhanced. This reveals that PTPBI has a face-on orientation. The purity of the face-on orientation is enhanced when adding a small amount of 1-CN (1%) into DCB as shown in Fig. 3e, in which the (h00) peak in the OOP direction completely disappears. These results reveal that the SA process with a high boiling point solvent is an efficient route to improve the crystallinity of double-cable polymers.
An interesting observation is the d-spacings in these polymers, in which PTPBI shows only a slightly larger d-spacing (∼22.7 Å) compared to PDCBT (∼19.8 Å). This is an unusual observation since PBI is a large aromatic unit between conjugated backbones, which would significantly enhance the d-spacings. Therefore, we further perform grazing-incidence medium-angle X-ray scattering (GIMAXS) measurement on these films in order to detect the large phase separation domain, as shown in Fig. 4. For PDCBT and PTPBI thin films fabricated from CB/DIO, only one diffraction peak ∼0.3 Å−1 is observed, which is consistent with GIWAXS patterns (h00 peaks). When using the SA method with DCB, a clear peak ∼0.092 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 68.0 Å appeared, which was further strengthened in the PTPBI thin film from DCB/1-CN. We denoted this peak as q1 and the highly ordered peaks as q2–q4 (Fig. 4d). Apparently, this is completely different from PDCBT and other traditional conjugated polymers. We intend to assign q1 the distance between two polymer backbones, in which two PBIs are located between them so that the d-spacing is much larger than that in PDCBT (Table 1 and Fig. 6b). This is an important observation since it clearly shows that in the crystalline region, double-cable polymers can also form lamellar structures similar to block conjugated polymers,32,35 revealing their great potential to realize high performance SCOSCs. Notably, q2–q4 were assigned the highly ordered peaks of q1, in which peak q3 is consistent with the peak (h00) from the GIWAXS measurement (with the same diffraction distance). Another interesting observation is that peak q3 (or h00) has high intensity compared to q1, indicating that q3 is the overlap of several diffraction patterns. In our previous work, we intend to assign peak q3 mainly to the (001) peak from the conjugated backbone,39 but here we also suggest that q3 is the (100) diffraction peak from PDCBT. The clear assignment of q3 is required to be further studied, which is also under progress in our lab.

The morphology of PTPBI thin films was also studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4f–g and Fig. S4.† Both the height and phase images show that the as-cast PTPBI thin film from CB/DIO exhibited large domain size on the surface with a roughness of 3.89 nm, while the domain size is significantly reduced with low roughnesses of 0.76 nm and 0.79 nm when using SA treatment. This might reveal that PTPBI in DCB could self-assemble into ordered structures, which is different from the strong aggregation of PTPBI in thin films from CB/DIO. A similar phenomenon can always be observed in diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-polymer:fullerene derivative systems, in which DPP-polymers form large domains when fabricated from chloroform and then the domain size can be significantly reduced when adding 10% DCB as an additive.59
2.4. SCOSCs based on PTPBI
We then applied PTPBI as a photo-active layer into SCOSCs with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTPBI/MoO3/Ag. Three solvents CB/DIO (1%), DCB and DCB/1-CN (1%) were used to fabricate PTPBI thin films. The J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 2. PTPBI based cells fabricated from CB/DIO showed a PCE of 1.37% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.81 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.42. Jscs were enhanced to 5.24 mA cm−2 and 6.72 mA cm−2 when using DCB and DCB/DIO as solvents, but meanwhile Vocs and FFs were slightly dropped. As a consequence, PCEs of 1.45% for DCB-fabricated cells and 1.77% for DCB/1-CN-fabricated cells were obtained. The enhanced photocurrent can be reflected by their external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) (Fig. 5b). PTPBI based cells from CB/DIO showed EQEs below 0.25, while EQEs were enhanced to 0.35 and 0.45 when using DCB and DCB/1-CN as solvents. The results confirm that by improving the molecular order in PTPBI, the charge generation efficiency can be enhanced and hence result in better PCEs in SCOSCs. Notably, when applying thermal annealing on these thin films (150 °C, as summarized in Table S2†), all devices show significant performance degradation, and the device fabricated from DCB/DIO even shows negligible photocurrent. Thus, thermal annealing is not helpful for the performance improvement.

We applied the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement to calculate the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of PTPBI-based cells fabricated from different solvents (Fig. S5 and Table S3†). When using DCB or DCB/1-CN as the solvent, both the hole and electron mobilities were decreased and meanwhile the ratio of μh/μe was increased from 2.9 to 5.1 and 9.9. We then further studied charge recombination in these cells by measuring Voc and Jsc at different intensities (Fig. S6†). The device fabricated from DCB shows significant trap-assisted recombination with a slope of 2.0kT/q in the Vocversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity plot (Fig. S6a†). Meanwhile, the Jsc dependence of light intensity plots indicates that all the three solvents show almost the same extent of bimolecular recombination. All these studies could explain the relatively low FF in DCB-fabricated devices (Table 2).
Although PTPBI shows well-ordered lamellar structures when using DCB/1-CN which are also recognized as the ideal structures in OSCs, the FF and PCE are still low. Currently, we are not sure about the real reason, but we want to propose that the crystalline domain is small so there are not enough amorphous regions to connect these domains. As shown in Fig. 6a, the generated charges in the crystalline region have no channel to transport, so they will be quenched in this region. This will cause severe charge recombination and lower the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, it might be important to find a balance between crystallized and amorphous morphology for double-cable conjugated polymers toward efficient SCOSCs.

3. Conclusion
In this work, we were able to develop a double-cable conjugated polymer PTPBI containing both a crystalline conjugated backbone and PBI side units for SCOSCs. The double-cable polymer contains a polythiophene derivative as the conjugated backbone to provide the facility to control its nanophase separation. PTPBI was dissolved in CB/DIO, DCB and DCB/1-CN solutions to make thin films. For DCB and DCB/1-CN systems, PTPBI thin films can be obtained via the SA method. It was found that by using the SA process with DCB/1-CN, PTPBI in thin films exhibits a face-on orientation and well-ordered lamellar structures with a lamellar stacking distance of ∼70 Å and a π–π distance of ∼3.5 Å. These structures enabled efficient charge transport in PTPBI thin films, resulting in improved photocurrent and PCEs in SCOSCs. Our results clearly demonstrate that double-cable conjugated polymers can also realize similar lamellar structures to block conjugated polymers, indicating their potential applications in high performance SCOSCs.

PTPBI. 
To a degassed solution of M7 (54.37 mg, 25 μmol) and M8 (12.32 mg, 25 μmol) in toluene (2 mL) and DMF (0.2 mL), Pd(PPh3)4 (1.45 mg, 1.25 μmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 115 °C for 24 h, after which it was precipitated in methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble. The polymer was extracted with acetone, hexane, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene. The chlorobenzene solution was evaporated and the polymer was precipitated in acetone. The polymer was collected by filtering over a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter and dried in a vacuum oven to yield PTPBI (40 mg, 73.4%) as a dark solid. GPC (o-DCB, 140 °C): Mn = 61 kDa, Mw = 163 kDa and ĐM = 2.64. Anal. calcd for C136H164N4O12S4: C, 75.10; H, 7.60; N, 2.58. Found: C, 75.20; H, 7.71; N, 2.83.
