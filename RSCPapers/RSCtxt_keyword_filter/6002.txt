Nowadays, research on doping is still in development, and the doping mechanism is still unclear. The dopants, doping methods, and doping effects need to be studied more widely and deeply. We believe that doping will become one of the important aids for the practical application of the next generation of organic optoelectronic materials and optoelectronic products in the future.
1. Introduction
In recent years, organic electronic products have attracted increasing attention in the fields of flexible display, wearable medical devices, human–computer interactions, and virtual reality, etc. Organic semiconductors (OSCs) as the key materials meet the needs for low-cost large-area fabrication and have been used as the active layers of various organic electronic devices, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),1 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),1–3 organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs),1 organic electrochemical sensors (OECTs),4 and organic thermoelectric devices (OTEs).5–11 In the past few decades, many high-performance OSCs have been developed, and one of the focuses of research is the design and synthesis of OSCs with novel molecular structures.12–14 Numerous OSCs have carrier mobilities of 1–10 cm2 V−1 s−1. The other research field is about the processing technologies of devices, such as the device structures, post-processing,15 and film deposition methods, with an aim to regulate the microstructure and morphology of molecules or thin films.16,17 Recent studies have found that doping as a rejuvenation means can improve processability, electrical properties, and functionalities of OSCs and corresponding optoelectronic devices.
Generally, doping refers to mixing a dopant as the guest into a material as the host, so that the two present the mixed state of the host–guest and can better realize and optimize the performance and function of the host with the assistance of the dopant. For optoelectronic materials and their application, doping was first proposed with the development of inorganic semiconductor materials. Atoms of inorganic semiconductor materials are closely packed through covalent bonds and ionic bonds, and periodically arranged in space in a certain way, forming zero-, one-, two-, or three-dimensional structured systems, so they have simple structures, high regularity, and good crystalline properties.18,19 In practical industrial applications, due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity and the defects in the crystalline structure, doping is used as one of the main means to adjust the Fermi level to optimize the performance of inorganic semiconductor materials and their optoelectronic devices.
The history of doping for optoelectronic materials is still relatively short. In 1941, the semiconductor p–n junction as an iconic product of the electronic information age was realized by doping. A simple p–n junction can be constructed by doping one side of a piece of silicon with boron and the other side with phosphorus. At present, inorganic semiconductors are widely used in electronic computers and other optoelectronic fields due to their superior electrical properties and high environmental stability. However, inorganic semiconductors represented by silicon have high preparation costs and poor mechanical properties (flexibility and stretchability, etc.).20,21 The next generation of organic electronic devices urgently calls for the industrial application of organic semiconductors.22
Organic compounds were initially considered as excellent insulators with wide energy gaps. In 1974, Hideki Shirakawa and others prepared polyacetylene films by coordination polymerization. Later, researchers found that in this type of highly conjugated polymers [such as polyacetylene (PA), polyaniline (PANI), and polypyrrole (PPY)23], electrons can move freely without atomic constraints, but their intrinsic conductivity is still low. Based on the experience of inorganic semiconductors, doping was adopted for organic materials. Through halogen vapor doping or alkali metal doping of PA, holes are generated or electrons are added, so as to greatly improve the conductivity of PA and make it become a semiconductor or even a conductor. The doping of OSCs is similar to the doping of inorganic semiconductors, and essentially it is performed to adjust the energy band structure and shorten the energy band gap to improve the electrical properties. While, insulator doping mainly involves applying dopants to fill high-energy deep wells, so as to improve the crystalline properties and optimize the film-forming properties, thus obtaining better device performance.
For different organic optoelectronic devices, the doping effects are different because of their different requirements.24–26 The key doping effects for OFETs are generally a high carrier mobility, low contact resistance, low bias voltage, and large current on/off ratio. Therefore, the doping for OFETs can mainly optimize device performance in three ways: (1) by increasing the carrier density through doping conducting materials or low-work-function materials, such as alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Ca etc.27–29) and alkali metal compounds (Cs2CO3,30–32 CsF,33,34etc.). Of course, the carrier mobility is the mobility under the extrinsic carrier density rather than the intrinsic mobility of the OSCs; (2) by reducing the energy barrier of carrier injection by adding dopants, the process of the carrier injection into the semiconductor layer becomes easier. For example, the addition of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) can bend the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), resulting in a reduction of the energy barrier for electron and hole injection;35 (3) by improving the carrier-transport properties through dopants. Also, some dopants can improve the processing properties of semiconductor materials and change the micromorphology and microstructure of thin films. Dopants can also improve the crystalline properties by inducing a transformation into the dominant crystal structure, and by filling the high-energy deep wells in the transport channel.36–38 In some cases, the roles of a dopant cannot be well distinguished, so the three ways of utilizing the doping effects are often not completely independent, and the purpose of improving the performance of OFETs is achieved through a synergy, i.e., by optimizing one or more aspects.
In this review, the doping of OSCs applied in the field of OFETs is highlighted, including the doping mechanism (Part II), the dopant factors affecting the doping effect (Part III), the doping sites (Part IV), and other development directions of doping (Part V). Moritz Riede et al. reviewed the doping of OSCs in 2012, but mainly related to applications in OLEDs and OPVs.1 Björn Lüssem et al. reviewed the doped organic transistors, including OFETs, in 2016, but considerable progress has been made in the field of doped OFETs since now.39 This review, therefore, focuses on the new progress in this field from the perspective of doping effects for improving the performance parameters of devices, including improving the mobility and switching ratio, reducing the threshold voltage and contact resistance, minimizing the gate bias stress, and realizing device functionalization, etc.
2. Doping mechanism
OFETs are three-terminal electronic devices, which are composed of an organic semiconductor layer, a dielectric layer, a source electrode, a drain electrode, and a gate electrode. In essence, an OFET is a capacitor with moving charges.40 The capacitance per unit area of the plate capacitor is C. The working principle is to control the magnitude of the electric field applied to the capacitor by controlling the voltage between the gate and the source/drain electrode to affect the charge density in the device, forming a simple metal–dielectric–semiconductor diode. When the applied gate voltage (Vg) is positive, negatively charged carriers (electrons) are electrostatically induced and accumulate at the dielectric/semiconductor interface; while when the applied Vg is negative, positively charged carriers (holes) accumulate at the dielectric/semiconductor interface. Q = CVg(1)
From formula (1), it can be seen that the number of accumulated carriers (Q) is proportional to the gate voltage and the capacitance of the dielectric layer. However, not all electrostatically induced charges can move, and intrinsic and extrinsic factors41 (such as structural defects, chemical impurities, environmental effects) exist at the dielectric/semiconductor interface, which can form high-energy traps to capture carriers.42 The voltage applied to overcome defects is the threshold voltage (Vth). Applying a gate voltage greater than Vth generates an effective gate voltage (Vg − Vth) to form mobile carriers at the dielectric/semiconductor interface and to generate conductive channels in transistors. The essence of the electrical conductivity of OSCs is the directional movement of carriers under an applied electric field. For OFETs, the key parameters are given by formulas (2, 3, and 4).43,44 (2)where σ is the conductivity; nq is the amount of charge involved in conduction per unit volume; ν (m s−1) is the average speed of drift, which is the occurrence of each carrier in the direction of the electric field under the action of the electric field force (qE); and E is the electric field strength. (3)where, μ is the carrier mobility, and its physical meaning is the migration speed of carriers in a unit electric field. σ = nqμ(4)
The switching ratio (Ion/Ioff) refers to the ratio of the source–drain current when the device is in the “on” state to the source–drain current when the device is in the “off” state, which reflects the switching performance of the device. In logic circuits, the on/off ratio is particularly important, and a high switching ratio means a better stability, anti-jamming capability, and greater load driving capability. When the source–drain contact resistance is negligible, the magnitude of the on-current is mainly related to the mobility of the semiconductor and the capacitance of the dielectric layer; the leakage current of the gate and the intrinsic current of the semiconductor determine the magnitude of the off-current. The contact resistance (Rc),45,46 generated by the contact between the source/drain electrode and the semiconductor layer, reflects the difficulty for carrier injection and extraction, and the smaller the value, the easier the injection. The bias voltage (ΔV), where usually the gate bias voltage is discussed, governs the stability of the device. The smaller the value, the more stable the device, which is better for the development of low-power devices. Conventional OFETs have four device structures: bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC), bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC), top-gate bottom-contact (TGBC), and top-gate top-contact (TGTC)47,48 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the device structures of conventional OFETs. 
Regarding the doping mechanism, we here discuss it from two parts: carrier injection and carrier transport. There are a lot of studies about the micro-mechanisms of carrier injection and transport by doping at the special sites of transistors and by constructing special transistor structures.49,50
In terms of carrier injection, it is generally necessary to ensure that the HOMO or the LUMO energy level of the OSC matches the work function of the electrode material, otherwise, it will be difficult to inject carriers and hard to obtain high-performance devices. The source and drain electrodes of OFETs are usually made of metal materials, such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), or calcium (Ca).48,51 Changing electrode materials to match the energy levels of OSCs is one strategy,52 but it is actually inconvenient to operate because of the wide range in fluctuation of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of different semiconductors. Therefore, in some cases, doping is adopted to bend the energy band in the case of mismatching. The doping effect can reduce the energy barrier of carrier injection to achieve the purpose of facilitating carrier injection.
According to the carrier type, doping can be divided into p-type doping and n-type doping. P-type doping involves the combination of a hole-transporting material and a strong electron acceptor (A), while n-type doping involves an electron-transporting material and a strong electron donor (D). Conductive doping is realized by charge transfer between the dopant and the semiconductor material, so that the Fermi energy level (EF) is shifted to the LUMO or HOMO level of the OSC. The Fermi energy level is highest energy level occupied by electrons when the temperature is absolute zero, commonly expressed as EF, thereby reducing the hole-injection energy barrier (φh) or electron-injection energy barrier (φe), which will improve hole or electron injection. Regarding the studies of the band structure change, researchers often directly measure the distribution of the energy levels before and after doping by the use of various characterization techniques, such as ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The shift of the energy bands is relative, and the analysis results in most works show that the values of EF are shifted to the HOMO or LUMO level after conductive doping, which reduces the energy barrier of carrier injection and enhances the carrier injection.53 For example, using 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinolinodimethane (F4-TCNQ)(p-doped) or CsF (n-doped) doped PCBM, EF decreased from −4.13 to −4.63 eV (ΔEF = 0.5 eV) and increased from −4.12 to −3.80 eV (ΔEF = 0.32 eV), respectively. The shifts of the EF change the concentration of thermally promoted excess carriers in the active semiconductor layer and enhance the carrier injection, thus optimizing device performance.33
The HOMO–LUMO offset between the dopant and the host material is a necessary factor for efficient doping. There are three mechanisms according to the relevant HOMO–LUMO offset between the OSC and the p-dopant (i.e., p-type doping) or n-dopant (i.e., n-type doping): charge transfer, charge-carrier trapping, and charge-carrier scattering,14 whereby, (1) as for the charge transfer mechanism, when the LUMO level of the p-dopant is lower than the HOMO level of the host, electrons easily transfer from the host to the p-dopant; whereas, when the HOMO level of the n-dopant is higher than the LUMO level of the host, electrons readily transfer from the n-dopant to the host, both of which can increase the electrical conductivity of the OSC (Fig. 2a); (2) when the LUMO level of the p-dopant is between the HOMO level and the LUMO level of the host, or the HOMO level of the n-dopant is between the HOMO level and the LUMO level of the host, this is the second case of the relevant HOMO–LUMO offset. The HOMO or LUMO energy difference (ΔE) between the dopant and OSC is called the trap depth or trap energy (ET). Many studies have shown that the values of ET correspond to deep electron traps (ca. >0.2 eV) or shallow electron traps (ca. <0.2 eV) in the p-dopant, as well as the hole traps formed in the n-dopant. The shallow energy traps slow down charge-carrier transfer and a decrease in the electrons or hole mobilities of the OSC. The deep traps might largely reduce the carrier mobilities, although they may not in some examples. This is the charge-carrier trapping mechanism. (Fig. 2b); (3) as shown in Fig. 2c, when the HOMO of the OSC is between the HOMO level and the LUMO level of the dopant, or the LUMO of the OSC is between the HOMO level and the LUMO level of the dopant, the relevant HOMO–LUMO offset can form an energy barrier and cause a scattering of the mobile holes or electrons, respectively. Similar to the charge-carrier trapping, low and high scatters are divided by the ET, with a value smaller or greater than ca. 0.2 eV, respectively. Also, the scatters affect the carrier mobilities in a similar way to shallow and deep trapping. So, according to the three cases considering the relevant HOMO–LUMO offset between the OSC and the dopant, an appropriate and effective dopant can be chosen to achieve a good doping effect.
 Fig. 2  HOMO–LUMO offset between the dopant and the OSCs: (a) charge transfer, (b) charge-carrier trapping, and (c) charge-carrier scattering. 
For the transport mechanism of carriers, it is generally considered that there are two transport modes54–56 in organic semiconductors, namely band transport and hopping transport, and the two transport modes can be distinguished by studying the temperature dependence of the carrier mobility in OFETs, according to the Arrhenius eqn (5):47,57,58 (5)where μ0 is the free carrier mobility, Ea is the activation energy escaping from a well state to a delocalized state, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
For OFETs, if the dμ/dT is greater than zero, it can be judged that the carriers are transported by thermally activated hopping, while negative values of the dμ/dT are usually interpreted as the occurrence of carrier ribbon transport. Banded transport mainly occurs in a single molecule or single crystal of the organic semiconductor, and is transported through its energy level orbitals.59 The non-conductive doping is a way to improve the charge-transport properties by changing the crystallographic properties to optimize the device performance. While hopping transport mainly take places between the molecules or crystal domains of the same molecules, hopping transport is dominant in most organic semiconductor layers, which is also called field-effect doping.60 Nowadays, there are two main viewpoints on the mechanism of dopants improving the transport of carriers in the academic community, namely the integer charge-transfer mechanism (ICT)61–63 and the charge-transfer complex mechanism (CTC).64,65 As for the ICT theory, there is only charge transfer between the dopants and the OSCs without orbital hybridization. Based on ICT theory, the dopant molecules have lower LUMO energy levels than the HOMO of OSCs with p-doping, so the holes can hop more easily between semiconductor molecules. In n-doping, the dopants have higher HOMO energy levels than the LUMO of OSCs, and so the electrons can hop more easily between semiconductor molecules. As shown in Fig. 3a, for p-type doping, the F4-TCNQ molecule has a very deep LUMO energy level of −5.2 eV, which is lower but close to the HOMO energy level of pentacene (−5.0 eV). As discussed in the above charge-transfer mechanisms, a relevant HOMO–LUMO offset between the dopant and the host can cause the electrons in the HOMO level of pentacene to spontaneously transfer to the LUMO level of the F4-TCNQ acceptor, leaving many holes in the pentacene, thus generating a sufficiently high carrier concentration. While, for n-type doping, the alkyl-substituted dopant Ru(t-but-terpy)2 raises its HOMO level by 0.2 eV over unsubstituted Ru(terpy)2 to −2.8 eV, which is slightly higher than the LUMO level of pentacene (−3.0 eV). The relevant HOMO–LUMO offset favors the transfer of electrons from the HOMO of the donor dopant to the LUMO of the pentacene, which leads to the molecular n-doping process of the organic semiconductor. Regarding the CTC or the orbital hybridization theory, OSC molecules and dopant molecules have overlapping electron clouds that generate hybrid orbitals, resulting in partial charge transfer and electronic coupling. As shown in Fig. 3b, for F4-TCNQ-doped pentacene, the HOMO level of the pentacene is −5.0 eV and its LUMO level is −3.0 eV while the HOMO level and the LUMO level of F4-TCNQ are −7.9 eV and −5.2 eV respectively. After doping, new hybridized orbitals of the bonding orbitals (−5.5 eV) and antibonding orbitals (−4.3 eV) are formed between pentacene and F4-TCNQ based on the CTC.

3. Influencing factors of the dopant on the doping effect
Effective doping effects include improving the mobility and switching ratio, reducing the threshold voltage and contact resistance, and minimizing the gate bias. In this review, we mainly discuss the methods to achieve the optimal doping effect from three factors: the dopant content, dopant molecular weight, and doping sites (see Section 4). For different OSCs and transistors, researchers usually need to consider the above three factors to obtain good doping effects.
3.1. Content of the dopant
Normally, the doping ratio or doping concentration is defined as the mass fraction of the dopant relative to the organic semiconductor material. Usually, the dopant content is small as the guest, and the content of the organic semiconductor material is large as the host. In the process of device preparation, especially in solution treatment, there are often traces of residual solvents or impurities in semiconductor layers (it is important to always try and remove them as much as possible), which may affect the performance of the devices.66–68 Therefore, researchers initially focused on the doping effects of residual trace solvents or impurities in organic semiconductor materials on device performance. Henning Sirringhaus et al. found that residual dichlorobenzene (DCB) solvent in the semiconductor film doped the semiconductor indolebenzenedithiophene–benzothiadiazole copolymer (IDT–BT).69 Compared with devices with thermal annealing to remove the residual solvent in the thin film, the threshold voltage stability of non-annealed OFET devices was much higher, and the solvent-free film was more likely to allow measuring the threshold voltage shift due to current stress. Also, similar doping effects for the threshold voltage stability of residual solvents also appear in other OSCs, such as diketopyrrolo-pyrrole-dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DPPDTT) and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT). Xavier Crispin et al. reported that thermally evaporated mixtures (e.g., ethyleneimine dimers and trimers) of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) were volatile and reductive, and caused n-doping effects in [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and poly[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene) (P(NDI2OD-T2)), respectively.70 However, for the same semiconductor material, not all residual solvents have favorable doping effects. If the solubility of the polymer is low, it will have some adverse interactions with some solvent molecules, which may impact the performance. It is also worth noting that the favorable or harmful influence of dopants on device performance may be temporary, and trace solvent molecules will slowly volatilize over a long time or may be removed by further post-treatment purification, thus their doping effect for specific dopant molecules will also disappear.
A small number of dopants may cause good doping effects, but it is not guaranteed that higher the doping concentration, the better the doping effect. Higher concentration doping sometimes does not work, and can even show an unfavorable doping efficiency. Amélie Revaux's group doped poly[((4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-6-diyl)] (PBDTTT-c) with tris[1-(trifluoroethanoyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)ethane-1,2-dithiolene] (Mo(tfd-COCF3)3), and found that when the dopant concentration varied in the range of 0.5–2.5% MR (number of dopant molecules per polymer monomer), the conductivity of the semiconductor film increased superlinearly.71 However, when the dopant concentration was increased to 8% MR, the conductivity did not increase but rather decreased slightly. The reasons for the phenomenon were considered to be due to the aggregation of polymers and dopants and the phase separation of the dopants and polymer hosts (Fig. 4). A high concentration of doping above the critical MR led to a disturbed crystallinity and higher degree of disorder in charge transport. In the DOS scheme, the Fermi level at the same Vg is usually shown relative to the center of the LUMO to illustrate the evolution of gap states (traps where the mobility is zero). Different mobilities indicate the effects of energetic disorder on the mobility and the different required Vg for achieving a high mobility. Yong-Young Noh and Jang-Joo Kim et al. also reported P(NDI2OD-T2) doped with bis(cyclopentadienyl)–cobalt(II) (cobaltocene, CoCp2) and CsF at different concentrations, respectively, with the doping concentrations gradually increasing from 0 wt% to 2 wt%.34 Their experiment results showed that at the critical doping concentration of 0.5 wt%, the carrier mobilities of both OFETs reached the maximum values of 0.72 and 0.37 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This is because with the increase in the doping concentration, the crystallization degree of the polymers was reduced, and charge transport was inhibited, resulting in a deterioration of device performance. In summary, an appropriate dopant concentration is one of the key factors to obtain good doping efficiency.

However, there are also some different examples where the dopant content is particularly large, which may actually be considered as the blending of two compounds. For example, Jianguo Mei et al. prepared complementary semiconducting polymer blend (c-SPB) films by melt-compression molding.72 The c-SPB films were composed of two semiconductor polymers: a DPP-based polymer with conjugate spacer breaks in the main chain (DPP-C5) and a DPP-based polymer with a completely conjugated main chain (DPP-C0). The c-SPB film mixed with 5 wt% DPP-C0 and 95 wt% DPP-C5 exhibited the highest carrier mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 50 °C, in which DPP-C0 was responsible for carrier transport and ensured good carrier-transport properties of the device, and DPP-C5 with a melting temperature of 138 °C allowed solvent-free melt processing. The blending films displayed high crystallinity at room temperature and isolated the influence of water and oxygen on the stability of the devices. Therefore, their OFETs showed an average charge mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and Ion/Ioff of 105, and could be maintained at room temperature for a long time, showing high environmental stability. In this study, the non-main-chain conjugated polymer DPP-C5 was regarded as a special dopant and was used to develop a special thin film processing method through high-concentration doping, achieving a good doping effect.
3.2. Molecular weight of polymer dopants
OSCs can be divided into organic single crystals and organic conjugated polymers according to the molecular weight. Similarly, dopants can also be divided into small molecule dopants and polymer dopants. Depending on the molecular weight, different processing methods are used for doping. Small molecular dopants are often prepared by vacuum evaporation or chemical vapor deposition to dope semiconductor thin films, while soluble small molecules dopants and organic polymer dopants are more convenient to dope OSCs and can be realized by solution treatment, and their OFETs constructed by spin coating, drop coating, bar coating, and inkjet printing, etc. Small molecules have a constant molecular weight, and their doping effects are reviewed in other parts of this paper (see Section 4). Here, we mainly discuss the influence of polymer dopants due to varying their molecular weights.
Polymers can have different molecular weights and molecular weight distributions due to their different degree of polymerization. The use of referenced polymer additives, such as polystyrene (PS),73,74 poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA),75 and polyacrylonitrile (PAN),32 with the appropriate molecular weight can optimize the microscopic morphology and microstructure (crystallization, π–π stacking distance, etc.) of OSC thin films, thereby improving the performance of OFET devices. Polymer dopants can also obtain the best doping effect by regulating their molecular weight. Yong-Young Noh et al. studied the doping effect of PEI into P(NDI2OD-T2) by changing the molecular structures (linear polymer and branched polymer) and the molecular weight of the dopant PEI.76 They found that a branched high molecular weight PEI of 25 kDa had an electron mobility of 0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.2 wt% doping concentration, while low molecular weight PEI of 2 kDa (linear) and 3 kDa (branched) showed electron mobilities of 0.85 and 0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 0.1 wt% doping concentration, respectively (Fig. 5). G. C. Schmidt et al. doped the polymer dopant poly-(ethyleneimine) (PEIE) into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) source/drain electrodes to reduce the work function of the PEDOT:PSS electrode.77 The doping of PEIE was found to be essential to reduce the threshold voltage, and this could achieve an electron mobility of 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a P(NDI2OD-T2)-based transistor. Nowadays, there are still few studies on the molecular weight of polymer dopants, which may be related to the difficulty in precisely controlling the molecular weight of polymers and the fluctuation of their properties. However, polymer additives with different molecular weights have an obvious influence on the processability and device performance.73–75 It remains necessary to consider the effect of the polymer molecular weight on the doping effect under appropriate conditions, while more polymer dopants need to be developed.

4 Doping sites
The influence of the doping content and molecular weight on the doping effect of OFETs has been mentioned above. Doping in different sites often produces different doping effects. For different optimization purposes, such as improving the carrier mobility, minimizing the bias voltage, reducing the contact resistance, etc., researchers may adopt the strategy of doping different sites in OFETs. In previous reviews, doping based on the doping sites are often divided into channel doping and contact doping. Channel doping refers to doping in the semiconductor layer, while contact doping refers to doping in the contact interface. In this part, we switch perspective to discuss the doping effect of the dopant on the host, while focusing on the performance changes of OFETs before and after doping. The classification criteria follow the sequence of small molecules to polymers, with p-type OSCs first and then n-type OSCs.
4.1. Channel doping
For the doping site at the semiconductor layer, dopants are usually mixed with organic semiconductor materials, and then deposited onto thin films by different processing methods, such as vacuum evaporation, chemical vapor deposition, spin coating, drop coating, bar coating, and inkjet printing. Research on doping in organic semiconductor layers has received increasing attention in recent years. Researchers have mainly focused on the doping effect of dopants on the physical and chemical properties of OSCs (such as the crystallinity and film formation) and device performance (such as the charge transfer and environmental stability). By adjusting these associated properties, the aim is to enhance the overall performances of transistors. It is interesting that doping the same OSC with different dopants or doping methods produces different doping effects. Next, we discuss the doping effects for four categories of semiconductors: p-type small molecule semiconductors (pentacene and its derivatives, and other p-type small molecules), n-type small molecule semiconductors (fullerene and its derivatives, and non-fullerene small molecule semiconductors), P3HT and polythiophenes derivatives, and donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers, with a focus on comparing the changes in the semiconductor properties and transistor performance parameters before and after doping. The mentioned OSCs, dopants, processing methods, doping methods, and performances of OFETs are summarized and listed in Table 1.

4.1.1. P-type small molecule semiconductors. 
Pentacene and its derivatives, as representative p-type small molecule semiconductors, are widely used as the host materials in the field of doped-OFETs research. Soo Young Park et al. developed a doping method to cover the surface of a semiconductor thin film with a discontinuous nanobelt to achieve unipolar (electron or hole) transport.57 They used two semiconductors to dope each other, respectively, with pentacene as a p-type doping nanobelt and (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(2,5-bis(hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene)bis(2-(5-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile) (Hex-4-TFPTA) as an n-type one. The discontinuous nanobelts provided a corresponding path for charge transfer (Fig. 6a). For Hex-4-TFPTA, the nanobelt doped the pentacene thin film, and when the nanobelt was 7 nm, the hole mobility and threshold voltage of the device reached the optimal values, increasing from 0.79 to 4.52 cm2 V−1 s−1 and then reducing from −19.2 to −0.4 V, respectively, with a high on–off ratio of over 105. Moritz P. Hein et al. coevaporated a blended doped layer (around 10 nm) with pentacene and 2,2′-(perfluoronaphthalene-2,6-diylidene)dimalononitrile (F6-TCNNQ) (p-doped) or tetrakis(1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidinato)ditungsten (W2(hpp)4) (n-doped), respectively, and then evaporated a pure pentacene thin film on the surface of the blended doped layer to prepare an OFET78 (Fig. 6b). The experiment results indicated that the gate bias pressure of the doped transistor could remain stable (that is, ΔVT approached zero), thus greatly improving the stability of the transistor. Unfortunately, the on–off ratio of the p-doped pentacene transistor was at a low level (about 102). By improving the doping concentration and the thickness of the doping layer, the gate bias pressure could be kept stable while maintaining a high on–off ratio of 105. Sui-Dong Wang et al. reported a controlled surface doping of pentacene in a similar way.79 Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) or F4-TCNQ was evaporated on the surface of the pentacene film. The thickness of the dopant was controlled to only 1–2 nm to produce a noncontinuous layer. This doping method could enhance the operating stability of OFETs, as Vth changed from −7.6 V to −5.9 V and −6.5 V consistently.

As for pentacene derivatives, such as 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-pentacene), Rebecca Saive et al. doped TIPS-pentacene films by implanting gallium ions (Ga+) through a focused ion beam (FIB), and characterized the doped thin film by XPS and scanning Kelvin probe microscopy.80 The XPS analysis results showed that the EF moved to the HOMO energy level direction after doping, and the work function increased by about 0.2 eV, which confirmed that the Ga+ produced p-type doping on TIPS-pentacene. Within a certain range, the conductivity of the film was positively correlated with the ion dose, showing a super-linear increase trend. The carrier mobility of the doped film doubled, and the Vth was reduced from 4 V to 1 V, but the on–off ratio was slightly lower (<102). Antoine Kahn et al. doped a TIPS-pentacene/PS (1:1) blend film with (Mo(tfd-COCF3)3).81 When the transistor was at a low doping concentration (p-type doping, 0.03 wt%), the threshold voltage shift was reduced to 1.07 V, while maintaining the hole mobility and the on–off ratios of 0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 105, respectively. The results were attributed to the filling of the deep wells in the film with the dopants, so as to tune the threshold voltage and preserve the transport properties. Michael L. Chabinyc et al. prepared a BGBC structure OFET by inkjet printing with a TIPS-pentacene solution containing 0.1 wt% tris-tertbutyl-1,3,5-benzenetrisamide (BTA).82 It was found that BTA had no effect on the crystalline property of TIPS-pentacene, but greatly improved its film-forming properties to achieve a full coverage of the device area. However, the thin film of pure TIPS-pentacene was discontinuous, due to the poor film-forming properties, leading to a device with ineffective functionalization (device yield = 0%). With the assistance of BTA, the device yield of the charge-carrier mobilities over 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 increased from 40% to 100%.
The doping of other p-type small molecule semiconductors is uncommon, but some cases are also listed in Table 1. Yuanwei Zhu et al. doped C12-BTBT with CN6-CP and F4-TCNQ in a BGTC device, respectively.83 In this work, CN6-CP had higher solubility and showed a higher doping efficiency compared with F4-TCNQ as the dopant under the same conditions. Guanghao Lu reported reactive oxygen (oxygen plasma or ozone) treatments of 2,7-didodecyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C12-BTBT),84 and found that low-pressure oxygen plasma resulted in low-concentration doping and maintained the hole mobility above 5 cm2 V−1 s−1. This in situ doping method could allow control of the doping concentration in a low-cost and simple manner.


4.1.2. N-type small molecule semiconductors. 
Fullerene and its derivatives are widely reported as typical n-type small molecule semiconductors. Thomas D. Anthopoulos et al. doped C60/[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and C70/[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) with (4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI), respectively, resulting in different doping effects.85 The experimental results showed that the n-type doping efficiencies of unsubstituted C60 and C70 were better than that of PC61BM and PC71BM correspondingly. The electron mobility of BGTC field-effect transistors was close to 2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the stability of the gate bias was effectively improved. Zhenan Bao et al. found that, compared with traditional benzimidazole-based n-type dopants (such as DMBI-H, DMBI-I), the dimer of benzimidazole was more effective for doping OSCs and achieved faster doping rates.86 In particular, they use three benzimidazole dimer dopants [(2-Cyc-DMBI)2, (2-Rc-DMBI)2, (2-Fc-DMBI)2] to dope three different semiconductor materials [P(NDI2OD-T2), PC61BM, C60], respectively, and the results showed that the three dimers had different degrees of improvement in the electrical conductivity of the three semiconductors. Among these, the (2-Cyc-DMBI)2 doped C60 exhibited the highest room temperature conductivity, up to 12 S cm−1. Dongyoon Khim et al. incorporated CsF(n-doping) and F4-TCNQ(p-doping) in to PCBM, respectively.33 The results indicated that the molecular doping achieved unipolarization of the PCBM-based OFETs. The addition of both molecules promoted the excess carrier concentration to shift the EF toward the respective transport energy levels, thus filling the deep intra-gap levels. Hence, the doping of CsF in to PCBM increased the electron mobility from 0.067 to 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 and reduced the Vth from 45.93 to 15.4 V.
It is well known that the development of n-type OSCs lags behind that of p-type OSCs, and in particular, obtaining an air-stable n-type OSC is a key issue. As for PCBM, there are three ways to achieve the environmental stability of OFETs: one is to compensate for the carriers trapped by water or oxygen through charge transfer by the dopants; another is to use dopants to improve the crystalline properties of the semiconductor materials; and the third is to achieve a good film formation and crystallinity of dopants for the purpose of “encapsulating” the device to isolate the interference of water and oxygen in the environment. Zhenan Bao et al. made an effective attempt to develop an air-stable n-type semiconductor by using N-DMBI as an n-type dopant for PCBM.87 Since N-DMBI is prone to charge transfer, neutral free radicals (dehydrogenate radicals, homolysis) and H+ free radicals (dehydrogenation ions, heterolysis)were generated to compensate for the charge loss due to water or oxygen capture. The conductivity of a thin film of 2 wt% N-DMBI doped PCBM by spin-coating increased from 8.1 × 10−8 to 1.9 × 10−3 S cm−1. Also, the transistors had high air stability with a charge-carrier mobility of over 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 after 20 days. Michael L. Chabinyc's group speculated that commercial nucleating agents (1,3:2,4-bis(3,4-dimethylbenzylidene)sorbitol (DMDBS) and BTA) could effectively induce nucleation and crystallization, so they used 0.1 wt% DMDBS and 0.1 wt% BTA to dope PCBM, respectively.82 In the presence of the dopants DMDBS, the PCBM molecules were induced to undergo heterogeneous nucleation, and the observed crystal domains decreased from 20 μm to less than 1 μm, which also greatly reduced the time required for annealing and facilitated achieving a higher speed of crystallization. Under the induction of the nucleating agent BTA crystals, the PCBM molecules also crystallized rapidly, and formed controllable patterned thin films that could be used to manufacture 2D optical density control devices. Moreover, the commercial nucleating agents did not negatively change the charge-transport properties of the PCBM, and still maintained the original carrier mobility.
The doping of other n-type small molecule semiconductor materials is often used in the organic thermoelectric field,88 while their applications in OFETs is not so common. Alex K.-Y. Jen et al. designed and synthesized a novel n-type small molecule: dicyanomethylene-substituted quinoidalthienoisoindigo (DCN), and used tetrabutylphosphonium bromide (TBPBr) and methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (mTPPBr) to dope DCN, respectively.89 The anions of the phosphonium salts (such as Br−, OH−) serves as Lewis bases to improve the conductivity of the blended film by increasing the carrier concentration through anion-induced electron transfer. The doped films had good environmental stability, and the conductivity of the film did not show any noticeable decrease after 72 h exposure to air, and could be maintained in the order of magnitude of 10−2. Unfortunately, the field-effect properties of the doped films were not tested. Thomas D. Anthopoulos et al. reported an unexplored n-type dopant (12a,18a)-5,6,12,12a,13,18,18a,19-octahydro-5,6-dimethyl-13,18[1′,2′]-ben-zenobisbenzimidazo [1,2-b:2′,1′-d]benzo[i][2,5]benzodiazo-cine potassium triflate adduct (DMBI-BDZC) and introduced it into small-molecule naphthalene diimides fused with 2-(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)malononitrile groups (NDI-DTYM2).90 Research shows that n-type doping results in OFETs with improved electron mobility (up to 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1), reduces the Vth, and lowers the Rc. These effects could be attributed to the fact that n-type doping reduces the activation energy of electrons and thus improves electron transport. Thomas D. Anthopoulos et al. also reported diquat (DQ) as a soluble n-type dopant and used it to dope several non-fullerene acceptor molecules.38 These all showed the synergistic effects of a reduced Rc and a rich layer morphology (the formation of larger crystalline domains) of the DQ-doped n-type OSCs, and these two primary effects were responsible for the enhanced electron transport. With the assistance of DQ, IEICO-4F-based OFETs exhibited a twice higher electron mobility than neat IEICO-4F transistors, while for the BTP-eC9- and N3-based OFETs, the electron mobilities were enhanced from 0.02 to 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.2 to 0.57 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These works demonstrate a new n-type dopant for OSCs and provide references for the development of n-type dopants.


4.1.3. P3HT and polythiophenes derivatives. 
Beyza Yedikardes et al. doped P3HT with inorganic tungsten oxide (WO3) with the doping concentration in a range of 0–50 wt%.91 They found that the optimal doping concentration was 30 wt%, and the transistor had a carrier mobility of 5.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, a lower threshold voltage of 17.7 V, and a higher current switching ratio of about 103. Other inorganic compounds [such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2)] are also used to improve the performance by increasing the density of free carriers and populating deep wells. Rajiv Prakash et al. reported that a TCNQ-doped P3HT thin film led to a nanofibrous surface and increased the field-effect mobility from 9.6 × 10−5 to 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an appropriate doping ratio of TCNQ.35 Zühal Alpaslan Kösemen et al. incorporated F4-TCNQ into P3HT to investigate the effect of p-type doping.92 The OFET constructed in this way, and using propylene carbonate (PC)-doped PMMA gel as the dielectric layer, showed a hole mobility of about 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the Vth moved from −5 V to −0.09 V, and the current on–off ratio could be maintained at 103 orders of magnitude. Youngkyoo Kim et al. reported that P3HT doped by 2-ethylbenzenesulfonic acid (EBSA) showed superior solubility in organic solvents.93 An OFET was constructed using Ag for the source/drain electrodes and indium tin oxide (ITO) as the gate electrode. Compared with using gold as the source/drain electrodes (higher carrier injection energy barrier), the hole mobility of the EBSA-doped film with the optimal doping ratio of 1.0 wt% was increased nearly 70 times, but the on–off ratio remained at a low level (<102). The research team further optimized the dielectric layer using poly(vinylphenol)-methylated poly(melamine-co-formaldehyde) (PVP-MMP), and extended its preparation time to fully react with the residual hydroxyl groups. The optimized device displayed a high switching ratio of 1.4 × 104 and its hole mobility was still increased ten-fold. However, it was a pity that the effect of the doping concentration of EBSA above 1.0 wt% on device performance was not investigated in the process of determining the optimal doping concentration of EBSA. The crystallization behavior of P3HT was also studied by Natalie Stingelin et al. using a commercial nucleating agent.82 By adding 1 wt% BTA, the crystallization onset temperature of P3HT was increased by 7 °C (as measured by differential scanning calorimetry). The addition of BTA did not change the crystallinity of the polymer, and only changed its crystallization behavior, so the carrier mobilities before and after doping remained the same and did not change obviously. Dieter Neher et al. blended P3HT with 95 wt% insulating polymer PS but this showed poor performance.94 While, the blended film surface doped with the micro-doping of water and oxygen or micro-doping of F4-TCNQ (about 0.1 wt% of the total P3HT) exhibited a carrier mobility in the order of 10−1 and an on–off ratio of up to 108, and good environmental stability. The researchers attributed the results to the occurrence of incomplete phase separation between the P3HT enriched on the surface of the blended films. The formed semiconductor domains led to higher connectivity, and the trace doping caused the transport channel in the semiconductor layer to be in close proximity to the gate, because the carriers induced by the gate voltage were collected in one or several molecular layers close to the gate, thus improving the device performance. Meanwhile, they also replaced P3HT with other conjugated polymers, like poly(3-butylthiophene) (P3BT), poly(3,3′′′-didodecyl quaterthiophene) (PQT-12) and PBTTT, and observed a similar doping effect, confirming the universality of this doping mechanism.


4.1.4. Donor–Acceptor type conjugated polymers. 
Wenwu Li et al. reported the p-type doping of N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (DTB) into IDT–BT.95 The dopant led to a shift of the EF to the transport level and a reduced density of trap states. The hole mobility was increased from 0.35 to 1.15 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the threshold voltage decreased from −38 to 0 V. Thomas D. Anthopoulos et al. reported the impact of p-type doping on charge transport in blade-coated small-molecule/polymer blend transistors.96 They used the p-dopant C60F48 to dope the C8-BTBT and a conjugated polymer poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (C16IDT-BT) blend film. The addition of the dopant improved the crystallinity of C8-BTBT, which reduced the energy disorder of the blended system and improved the carrier transport, thus leading to an increase in hole mobility from 6 to 14 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thomas D. Anthopoulos's team also reported other doping of the C8-BTBT/C16IDT-BT blended system.36,97 The p-dopant bis(pentafluorophenyl)zinc [Zn(C6F5)2] was added as an alternative Lewis acid in OFETs, displaying a high hole mobility.37 The Lewis adducts formed from Zn(C6F5)2 and the shortening π–π spacing strongly induced by Zn(C6F5)2 both played a synergistic effect in promoting charge transport, with a significant increase in hole mobilities from 1.9 to 21.5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Researchers have tended to focus on small-molecule/polymer blend systems, and the doping studies of other co-blended systems are still in progress. Alan J. Heeger et al. doped poly[4-(4,4-dihexadecyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-alt-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo-[3,4-c]pyridine] (PCDTPT) with chemical vapors of I2 and NH3, respectively.98 Experiments revealed that the carrier density in transistors could be effectively regulated by moderate doping. The doping of I2 increased the hole mobility up to 58.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and correspondingly reduced the Rc from 30.9 to 14.7 kΩ cm. Deqing Zhang et al. reported the incorporation of an ionic additive, tetramethylammonium iodide (NMe4I), in to the polymer [poly-[2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dionel-alt-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene]] (DPPTTT).99 This simple approach improved the charge-carrier mobility of the conjugated polymer from 0.8 to 19.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and maintained an on–off ratio of 107. This was attributed to the presence of iodide and tetramethylammonium ions, which facilitated the formation of an ordered lamellar packing of the alkyl side chains and benefited the interchain π–π interactions. Jiawei Wang et al. vacuum deposited the small molecule dopant F4-TCNQ on the poly(2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thiophene[3],[2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT) monolayer film (about 2 nm by drop coating), and constructed a BGBC structured OFET device.60 UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy of the doped films showed obvious polaron peaks, corresponding to the F4-TCNQ anion, which was attributed to the charge transfer between PBTTT and the dopant molecules, confirming the effective doping of F4-TCNQ. They also carefully studied the doping effect of different dopant film thicknesses on the single-layer PBTTT film and the doping effect of the same dopant content on PBTTT films with different film thicknesses (single-layer, double-layer, and triple-layer), respectively. They called the method “field-effect doping”. The results of field-effect doping showed that the carrier mobility and carrier density had no linear correlation, and the doping effect depended critically on the carrier transport behavior between the dopant-diffused layers. Anton Kiriy et al. studied the p-doping of CN6-CP to PDPP(6-DO)2TT and reported an electrical conductivity of PDPP(6-DO)2TT:CN6-CP films up to 70 S cm−1, which was much higher than that of the PDPP(6-DO)2TT:F4-TCNQ film (10−2 S cm−1).100 Huipeng Chen et al. blended a p-type organic semiconductor of PDVT-8 into the n-type polymer semiconductor P(NDI2OD-T2), which could improve the device performance of n-type OFETs.101 The PDVT-8 acted as trap centers for few holes, thereby reducing the density of trap states at the interface. The stacking direction of the OSC also tended toward a direction that was favorable for electron transport. The electron mobility (μe) was thus improved, from 0.18 to 1.66 cm2 V−1 s−1, with the on–off ratio also improved from 103 to 105. Stefan C. B. Mannsfeld et al. reported surface doping with aminosilanes on to the n-type semiconductors N,N′-dioctyl-3,4,9,10-perylenedicarboximide (PTCDI-C8) and P(NDI2OD-T2), respectively.102 The aminosilanes included 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propan-1-amine (TMA) and (N-(3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl)ethane-1,2-diamine) (TEDA), and they could fill the existing traps and voids in the OSC film, as certified by the Vth shifts. The TMA- and TEDA-treated PTCDI-C8/P(NDI2OD-T2) exhibited μe values of 0.2 and 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Dong-Yu Kim et al. reported a solution-processed n-doping strategy for P(NDI2OD-T2).103 They mixed the semiconductor polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) solutions, respectively. This facile solution doping increased the carrier density and filled the low-energy state traps of the thin film. The Rc showed a significant reduction by an order of magnitude, while the electron mobilities increased from 0.31 to 0.67 and 0.41 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Martin Heeney et al. doped P(NDI2OD-T2) with TBAF and also found that the stable radical anions formed in thin films filled the traps in the semiconductor layer, effectively reducing the Rc from 4520 to 71 kΩ cm with an μe of 0.17 cm2 V−1 s−1.104 Yuanyuan Hu et al. reported two organic bases, named 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) and 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN), for the n-doping of P(NDI2OD-T2).7 The doped P(NDI2OD-T2) films with TBD and DBN resulted in maximum conductivities of (4.76 ± 0.29) × 10−4 and (4.10 ± 0.28) × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively, which were dramatically higher than that of the pristine P(NDI2OD-T2) film ((9.26 ± 0.29) × 10−8 S cm−1). The electron mobilities were influenced by the dopant concentrations, and the DBN vapor doping could change the polarity of semiconductors from ambipolar or p-type to n-type. It was also found that the doping concentration of the two dopants could be adjusted to achieve the optimal doping effects for thermoelectric devices.

4.2. Contact doping
Generally, the device structures of OFET include BGTC, BGBC, TGTC, and TGBC (Fig. 1). The dielectric layer is located between the electrode (source–drain or gate) and the semiconductor layer. Common dielectric materials are inorganic insulators [such as silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and silicon nitride (Si3N4)] and polymeric insulators, such as PMMA and poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP).48 Up to now, most research reports about dielectric layers involve interface modification (i.e., interface engineering112–114) and the replacement of high-k materials and special electrodes. Doping in the contact interface with the dielectric layer is not common.
Doping in the dielectric layer often occurs in special transistor structures or other devices. For example, in organic thermoelectric, electrolytes are often used to directly dope the dielectric layer to achieve the thermoelectric properties [mainly the Seebeck coefficient (S)] of organic semiconductors, thus efficient modulating the ultra-high capacitance (1–100 μF cm−2) and making the electrolytes into gated devices.5,115 Zühal Alpaslan Kösemen et al. introduced PC into PMMA to form a gel92 (Fig. 7a). The gelled PMMA had a high dielectric constant and could serve as a gate dielectric while filling the gaps between the film layers. Energy deep wells in the contact interface were demonstrated by changing the threshold voltage of the undoped material from −5 to −0.1 V after doping, and the carrier mobility was largely improved by two orders of magnitude from 5.72 × 10−3 to 2.6 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Jeong Ho Cho et al. used the p-type dopant bis(trifluoromethanesulfonamide)amide (TFSA) and the n-type dopant PEI to dope the bottom of graphene and applied it in an OVFET (a hetero-structured field-effect transistor)116 (Fig. 7b). Bottom doping did not change the surface properties of graphene and also induced an ordered arrangement of OSC materials, whose grain size was more regular as confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The presence of the dopant adjusted the work function of the graphene to match the semiconductor, and facilitated the injection of carriers. The p-type (pentacene) and n-type (PTCDI-C8) devices based on this structure yielded current densities over 10 mA cm−2 and switching current ratios exceeding 103. Björn Lüssem et al. described an n-type doping of a dopant 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dimethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-3-ium iodide (o-MeO-DMBI-I) layer added to a gate dielectric 2,9-C60(cyclo-CF2(2-C6F4)), (C60FHF) layer.117 This doping shifted the Vth to about 0.3 V and minimized the increase in the subthreshold swing to 400 mV dec−1, which increased the air stability of the device. Antoine Kahn et al. doped N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (α-NPD) with the dopant Mo(tfd)3 to form p-doped α-NPD, and inserted a pure α-NPD layer at the contact interface with the semiconductor pentacene to form a bulk heterojunction structure, thereby realizing the remote doping of pentacene.106 This special doping mode could avoid the diffusion of the dopants in the semiconductor layers and fill the deep wells to reduce the activation energy of hole transport, thereby improving the carrier mobility from 9.5 × 10−2 to 2.9 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Experiments found that the energy barrier formed by the interlayer between the dopant and the semiconductor material plays an important role in the shutdown of the device, but choosing a suitable heterojunction material is still a challenge.

Generally, doping at the contact interface between the electrode and the semiconductor layer aims to reduce the contact resistance and promote the carrier injection. Bernard Kippelen et al. vacuum deposited a blended layer of molybdenum tri-[1,2-bis(trifluoromethyl)ethane-1,2-disulfide] (Mo(tfd)3) as the contact interface with electrodes and pentacene (1:1), and the as-fabricated OFET maintained a high switching ratio of 104 and good stability of Rc under continuous bias.105 The Rc was reduced from 3.4 to 0.5 kΩ cm. Ji-Ling Hou et al. evaporated 1 nm F6-TCNNQ film between the gold electrodes and pentacene to improve the carrier injection. The Rc decreased from 55 to 10 kΩ cm after doping.108 For the OVFET device, Alrun A. Günther et al. inserted a thin layer of the p-type dopant C60F36 (2 nm) between the source electrode and the pentacene layer, and the Rc of the doped device was significantly reduced from 6.46 × 10−3 to 1.66 × 10−5 Ω m.107 This was due to the enhancement of carrier injection at the electrode contact. Through this doping, a high on–off ratio and high transconductance ratio (gm) were also obtained, reaching 106 and 40.6 μS, respectively. Paddy Kwok Leung Chan et al. doped C8-BTBT with F4-TCNQ in the contact interface of Ag electrodes,46 and reported that the surface doping led to trap filling and increased the μh from 0.5 to 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the Rc dropping from 25.7 to 5.2 kΩ cm. Kazuhito Tsukagoshi's group developed a C8-BTBT-based BGTC structure OFETs doped by ferric chloride (FeCl3).118 The Rc of the device was significantly reduced from 200 to 8.5 kΩ cm by doping a 0.3 nm FeCl3 layer at the semiconductor–electrode interface. The same doping pattern in other device structures was also explored in this study, and it was found that the Rc could be further reduced using a top-gated structure device. Such a special structure device was called a “pseudo-staggered device architecture”. In particular, the Rc values of the TGBC-doped and TGTC-doped devices dropped to 0.1 and 0.2 kΩ cm, respectively. Hiroaki Iino et al. used the structure of BGTC to evaporate a layer of F4-TCNQ between Au electrodes and the liquid-crystal material 2-decyl-7-phenylbenzothiophene (Ph-BTBT-10).111 The contact resistance of the devices was reduced by more than half (from 3.0 to 1.2 kΩ cm) through the contact doping of F4-TCNQ. The device achieved a higher mobility and lower threshold voltage due to the diffusion of dopants filling the deep wells in the organic semiconductor layer. As shown in Fig. 7c, Keehoon Kang and Takhee Lee's team also utilized F4-TCNQ as a dopant to dope PBTTT, but because the device structure was different (BGBC), the site of the dopants was also different, and the contact resistance was effectively reduced from 24.5 to 5.1 kΩ cm.119 Through the testing and analysis of UPS, it was speculated that the selective doping produced a sub-bandgap state, which changed the carrier-injection mechanism from thermal excitation injection to thermal tunnel injection. Meanwhile, they also used argon plasma to etch the film surface, slowing down the diffusion rate of dopants to improve the stability of the device, and the doping/etching device maintained a high Ion/Ioff ratio of 105 for half a month. In the latest work of this team, based on F4-TCNQ-doped PBTTT in the same way, they doped the F4-TCNQ-doped polymer film with TCNQ as a doping blocking molecule, effectively inhibiting the diffusion of F4-TCNQ into the main body, attributed to its similar molecular structure as well as higher HOMO–LUMO offset between the dopant and the host, thus improving the stability of the device.120 Jung Hwa Seo et al. interposed nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (NPE) layers between a PCBM layer and Au electrodes.110 NPEs (PEIEH+Cl−, PEIEH+Br−, and PEIEH+I−) consisting of protonated and ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) served as the nonconjugated polymer backbone with three different anions (Cl−, Br−, and I−). The addition of NPEs formed an interfacial dipole and effectively lowered the φe from 0.7 eV to 0.33, 0.33, and 0.32 eV, respectively, according to UPS analysis. The results showed improved electron mobilities up to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an Ion/Ioff of 105 in doped PCBM-based OFETs, and reduced Rc values from 0.153 GΩ cm to 0.069, 0.020, and 0.070 GΩ cm, respectively. There are also similar applications in OPVs, in which an Al electrode was doped with a layer of lithium fluoride to reduce the contact resistance, thereby increasing the carrier injection and improving the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell.121
5. Other development directions
Doping has been applied in OFET studies for nearly 20 years. With the advancement of OSCs and the advancement of work on devices, the development momentum of doping has been very rapid. In recent years, doping has also led to some other research directions, including the design and synthesis of new dopants, analytical techniques and instruments for dopants, and functional devices realized through doping. The development of these directions has broadened the limits of doping applications to a certain extent, and clarified more possibilities for the further development of doping.
5.1. Characterization techniques and instruments
Analytical instruments are the eyes of scientific researchers. People use analytical instruments to monitor the material to obtain relevant information, analyze the cause of phenomena, verify conjectures, and draw conclusions. Therefore, analytical instruments are indispensable and important for scientific researchers. In the field of dopants and their application in OSCs and devices, UPS and XPS analytical methods are used to measure the change of the Fermi energy level of the film before and after doping, and determine whether the electron- or hole-injection energy barrier is reduced and whether they can achieve the effect of injection enhancement. Infrared spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy record the optical properties of a film and the doping effect. AFM122 and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis can be used to observe the micromorphology and microstructure of the film, calculate the surface roughness, the degree of dopant phase separation, π–π stacking spacing, and interplanar spacing, which are the evidence that doping can effectively improve the crystalline properties of thin films.
Naoka Nagamura et al. developed a new analytical instrument: a three-dimensional nanoscale electron spectrochemical analysis system.123 Researchers used it to analyze the response of a single-crystal 3,11-didecyl-dinaphtho[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (C10-DNBDT-NW)-based OFET under synchrotron radiation. During the radiation, the chemical potential shifts resulted in p-doping, due to the band bending caused by the field effect at the gate voltage of 30 V (Fig. 8a). Guanghao Lu et al. introduced a universally applicable method for depth profiling: thin-film depth-dependent infrared (FDD-IR) spectroscopic profiling.124 This enabled the direct determination of intrinsic materials after incremental surface selective etching by soft plasma, which can help to study the change of a material along the surface normal direction. It can be used in the field of semiconductor doping to study the distribution of ionized dopants. The technique has also been used to analyze the quantitative vertical diffusion and composition distribution of dopants in the host, for example, the P3HT doped by F4-TCNQ. As a result, this approach is a great help for understanding the doping mechanism and improving the doping effect (Fig. 8b).

5.2. Functional devices
Doping, as an optimization means, can enhance the physical properties of OSCs (crystallinity, light absorption, conductivity, etc.) and the performance parameters of OFETs (conductivity, carrier mobility, Ion/Ioff ratio, etc.). These changes are sometimes accompanied by many interesting phenomena, from which researchers can get inspiration for developing functional devices.
Doping can realize inversion-type transistors, while the usual OFETs are depletion-type transistors. Karl Leo et al. accomplished an organic inversion transistor for the first time by using a doping technique.125 They doped pentacene with F6-TCNNQ (p-doped) and W2(hpp)4 (n-doped), respectively, and inserted the doped pentacene layers as the semiconductor–dielectric interface. The performance parameters of devices could be optimized by adjusting the doping concentration of the dopants and the thickness of the insertion layer. The Vth of an undoped device was −3.6 V, whereas after doping it dropped to 0.8 V. The two thin layers of doped pentacene at the semiconductor–dielectric interface and the semiconductor–electrode interface realized organic depletion and inversion transistor modes.
The doped OFET could be applied as a gas sensor. Vitaly Podzorov et al. reported that the conductive properties of polythiophenes were strongly modified by self-assembled silane molecules.126 Using a gaseous doping mode, P3HT or PBTTT film was exposed to fluoroalkyl trichlorosilane (FTS) vapor for doping, and the conductivity of the resulting doped polythiophene films was increased by 6 orders of magnitude. The analysis results showed that in the doping, free silanol groups were generated by the hydrolysis of FTS. The doped-P3HT film had induction characteristics to polar gas molecules (such as acetone, H2O), and the conductivity changed strongly and reversibly, which can be used to fabricate a gas sensor. They found that FTS doping strongly inhibited the interband light absorption of the PBTTT film as well, and the doped film became almost transparent, displaying a possibility for optoelectronic device application, as shown in Fig. 9a.

Reprinted with permission from ref. 127. Copyright 2021 American Chemical Society.127 
A short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) sensing organic phototransistor (OPTR) was also constructed by doped OSCs. Borrowing the structure of OFET, Youngkyoo Kim et al. prepared a SWIR-sensing OPTR with indium tin oxide (ITO) as the gate, PMMA as the dielectric layer, and a poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (PolyTPD) layer doped with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) as the sensing layer (Fig. 9b).127 The optimization of the doping molar ratio of BCF (BCF:PolyTPD) was 0.5, and it could realize a close to 50% photoresponsivity of short-wavelength infrared light (λ = 1500/2000/2500 nm).
For polymers as dopants, as mentioned above, the polymer dopants can achieve the doping effect by affecting the crystalline properties of semiconductor materials. So, this action can also be used to realize a device's special functions. Jianguo Mei's team blended 95 wt% DPP-C5 and 5 wt% DPP-C0 to form c-SPB, and prepared a BGBC OFET for achieving self-healing devices.72 A single device unit was taken as the research object, and a circle was delineated as the isolation area to avoid current leakage. Then a notch was drawn in the middle of the film with a hard tungsten probe. At this time, the source and drain current of the device did not change with the change of voltage, and the device was in a state of lower current (about 10−12A), similar to the device being in a shutdown state. After that, the film was heated at 160 °C for more than 30 min, and under the covering pressure of the octadecyl trichlorosilane (OTS)-modified silicon wafer, the fluidity of the semiconductor layer was restored due to the chain flexibility of DPP-C5 (its melting point was 138 °C), whereby the damaged area could be completely repaired. The carrier mobilities were 0.29 and 0.26 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, before and after the experiment, while the original device had an average carrier mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Doping can also open the possibility for multimode transistors to work together. Colin Nuckolls et al. reported a controlled doping of an OFET based on novel large contorted aromatic compounds.128 The researchers exposed a dodecyl-substituted contorted octabenzocircum-biphenyl (c-OBCB) film to trifled acid vapor for doping, and a protonated conjugated acid was formed after the doping. The protonated c-OBCB was spin-coated on the pure c-OBCB surface to construct a transistor (Fig. 10a). The controlled doping in this mode caused the transistor to be in the on state without applying gate voltage, which was attributed to the carriers induced by the induced electric field formed by the trifluoro sulfonate anions that had accumulated on the top of the protonated film. When a positive gate voltage was applied, the device then turned off (Fig. 10b). This represented a functionalized device operated by acid doping. The device was turned on by surface acid doping, and then turned off by the voltage applied to the source–drain electrodes, thus enabling a multimode switching OFET. Multimode switching transistors have been widely used in sensors,129 memories,130etc.

6. Summary
In conclusion, different dopants have different doping effects, which can be roughly divided into: (1) increasing the charge density; (2) filling deep energy traps; (3) improving material processability, molecular crystallization, and film formation; (4) adjusting the contact resistance; (5) adjusting the energy level of the material; and (6) improving the device stability, etc.131 In general, doping can effectively improve the performance of OFETs and even realize some special functionalization of transistors. With the development of OSCs, some semiconductor materials are difficult to be processed into films due to their own molecular structure and properties. Even if some OSCs are extensively studied in the field of OFETs, their properties and performance are still affected by many factors, such as the device structure, difficulty in efficient spreading, and poor crystallization, and they can exhibit mediocre device performance, which means they cannot be put into practical applications. However, effective doping by various means often reverses the disadvantages of single materials and can greatly improve the device performance, and even achieve functional devices (e.g., curable, flexible, stretchable). Although the doping mechanism is not clear, it does not damp its research interest and application. As far as the current development is concerned, the research on dopants and the development of new dopants are continuing, and researchers are making unremitting efforts to develop more efficient and widely used dopants. In addition, more effective detection instruments and methods for achieving the doping effects and doping mechanism are constantly being reported.
