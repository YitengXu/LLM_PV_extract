    , Accepted 26th February 2018First published on 27th February 2018AbstractOrganic and inorganic molecules/atoms located at different lattice positions in hybrid perovskite films play various roles in crystallization and carrier transport for perovskite films. For efficient and stable solar devices, high quality crystals and the proper dispersion of organic/inorganic species are required. In a preferably mixed perovskite system (a blend of MA, FA, I, Br, etc.), however, the effects of inorganic/organic ratios on the performances and electrical properties of perovskite solar cells have not been fully understood. Here, we present perovskite solar cells with self-doped organic and inorganic components to investigate in detail their effect on crystallization and electrical properties. The organic component enhances the conductivity and reduces the hysteresis, while the inorganic component promotes crystal growth. A critical composition is beneficial to perovskite crystallization, with larger crystals and a pinhole-free morphology, and the corresponding device achieved a high efficiency over 19.14% (0.16 cm2, mask area) and 16.2% at an area of 1.21 cm2. Thus, evaluation of the organic/inorganic variation effects provides an understanding of self-doping in mixed perovskites and is beneficial to pursue high-performance perovskite devices.
Introduction
A hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite possesses outstanding photoelectric properties such as a large light absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, long life time and diffusion length, etc.1–3 With a simple solution processing and low handling temperature, perovskite solar cells have attracted extensive attention and have been widely researched in recent years. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has surged to a remarkable 22.1% in just a few years, signifying their great potential as a low cost photovoltaic energy source for future industrial application.4,5 However, to realize this vision, the efficiency still needs to be further improved for up-scaled devices as well as the stability. For novel organic–inorganic hybrid semiconductor devices to achieve higher efficiency and stability, obtaining high quality crystal film with appropriate electrical properties is essential.
With the unique solution processing, the precursor chemistry of perovskite solution is pivotal to the nucleation and growth of crystals and thus to the electrical properties.6,7 This involves variation of the chemical composition, such as the constitution of the phases, additives and solvents.6,8–10 Many studies have demonstrated that a suitable excess of PbI2 additive is beneficial to the perovskite crystallization and to passivate the grain boundaries.11–13 However, few reports showed that the organic component also plays a crucial role in coordination with the inorganic component, and the high quality of the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite can be obtained with a little extra MAI or MACl incorporated into the perovskite precursor.14–16 Besides, a changeable bandgap and energy level of the conduction band or valence band can also be altered by the perovskite precursor chemical composition,8,17 and MAI-rich and PbI2-rich perovskite (MAPbI3) films show ambipolar p and n self-doped properties.18 In addition, choosing a corresponding solvent is also very important to the perovskite precursor; for example a Lewis base, high boiling point solvent of N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can help form the adduct of PbI2·DMSO and MAI·PbI2·DMSO, which is beneficial to the perovskite quality.19,20 However, these insightful results mainly revealed that the MAPbI3 based perovskite films and their devices, as well as a promising mixed perovskite compound comprising formamidine lead iodide (FAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromine (MAPbBr3) that creates a mixed perovskite (FAxMA(1−x)PbIyBr(3−y)) should be explored systematically.21
Herein, an evolution of the crystallization and electronic properties of the mixed perovskite (FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3) induced by the organic/inorganic self-doping was investigated in detail. The organic and inorganic precursor component ratio was varied and labeled R [R = inorganic precursor/organic precursor; organic precursor ((FAI)0.85(MABr)0.15) and inorganic precursor ((PbI2)0.85(PbBr2)0.15)]. With the change of R values from 0.35 to 1.75, the film crystallization, surface morphology, bandgap, electrical conductivity and PCEs of these mixed perovskite based solar cells presented a wide variation. The corresponding high efficiency over 19% was achieved based on the appropriate precursor composition (R = 1.08) and a good stability even under storage in ambient air without sealing was also observed. This work revealed the self-doping induced crystallization and morphological changes of perovskite films, and provided an insightful understanding of the electronic properties that could possibly affect the stability of solar cells.
Results and discussion
Crystal nucleation and growth is very important to perovskite films and has invited more and more studies recently.22–25 An important piece of information is that with suitable organic or inorganic components doped into the perovskite precursor, the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite films can be dramatically improved, and hence some related efficient organic compounds like MAI, MABr, and MACl and inorganic compounds like PbI2, PbBr2, and PbCl2 have been demonstrated as precursor materials.14,15,26–30 In recent theoretical and experimental reports the self-doping properties of perovskite MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 have also been researched.18,31 However, there were fewer descriptions of mixed perovskites. A mixed perovskite precursor can be easily self-doped with the variation of the components. We realized the self-doping conditions by simply changing the ratio of organic (FA+, MA+) and inorganic (Pb2+) components to understand the effects of ions at different lattice positions. Therefore, the increase of the self-doping ratio value R means the decrease of the organic component, which is equivalent to the increase of the inorganic component. The corresponding changes of the perovskite surface morphologies and cross-section SEM images of their devices are shown in Fig. 1. The perovskite device structure is FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/mixed perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The top view of the perovskite films shows that the grain sizes vary nonlinearly with the R value increasing (from 0.35 to 1.75). For R > 1, some PbI2 fragments appeared in the perovskite grain boundaries. However, from the cross-section images, low organic component doped perovskite (0.70 < R < 1.00) showed smaller grains than the R = 1.00 perovskite film, while highly organic component doped perovskite (R < 0.70) exhibited much bigger “crystals”; meanwhile the white and black spots that occurred in the R = 0.35 perovskite “crystals” are the unreacted organic components, and scallops thus lead to a rough surface. For R > 1.00, the perovskite crystal size had significantly increased. The corresponding AFM images (Fig. S1†) suggest similar results of the grain size changing with R, and the surface roughness of different perovskite films are shown in Table S1.† The abnormal values indicated the poor morphologies of the overmuch organic or inorganic component doped perovskite films. Therefore, it is indicated that the residual organic component covered the perovskite crystals and excess inorganic component located in the grain boundaries, and appropriate excess inorganic component doping increased the grain size and quality of the perovskite films. With the increase of the organic component the perovskite grain size will decrease, forming a large non-perovskite granular aggregation.

Fig. 2a shows the sectional X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared mixed perovskite films based on different R values, and the full spectra are shown in Fig. S2.† The strong peak at 14.05° was assigned to the (101) plane of a stoichiometric ratio (R = 1.00) based mixed perovskite phase. With the R values increasing from 1.00 to 1.75, the (101) plane obviously shifted to larger angles, and a new peak at 12.68° belonging to the hexagonal PbI2 phase appeared and enhanced dramatically with the increase of R. However, a significant left shifting of the (101) peak was observed with the decrease of R values from 1.00 to 0.35, which indicates an enlarged lattice with excess organic doping. These outstanding changes also indicate that Br− is more readily formed from the perovskite phase and FA+ is dominant in the perovskite crystal when FA+/MA+ is abundant. Therefore, the crystallinity of the perovskite phase can exhibit remarkable changes either by organic or inorganic doping. Appropriate enhancement can be obtained with slight additional organic or inorganic doping, which is consistent with the SEM images above. Fig. 2b shows the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the as-prepared different mixed perovskite films. The N–H stretching at 3300–3500 cm−1 became stronger when the R value decreased. This is consistent with the fact that the organic component doped perovskite films haveresidual organic material on the perovskite surface. Fig. 2c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra, and Fig. 2d presents the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of these different R value perovskite films. The inset photograph of these different perovskite films shows that the color has changed from yellow (R = 0.35) to orange (R = 0.56), dark red (R = 0.70), black (R = 0.93–1.17), dark brown (R = 1.40) and light brown (R = 1.75). The bandgap of these films also increased with either organic or inorganic precursor doping (Fig. S3†). Little changes were observed for the samples with the R value between 0.93 and 1.40. This result is also confirmed by presenting the PL spectrum. However, the organic species doped samples showed lower absolute light absorption and left-shifting of the absorption edge significantly. Their normalized PL patterns also suggest a wider absorption compared to the inorganic counterparts, and this may be resulted from the unreacted organic residues and the incomplete crystallization. The excess organic components may separate the 3D structured perovskite and lead to the phase separation of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 which shows another peak at a long wavelength as can be seen from the PL spectra of the R = 0.35 perovskite film.

The above-mentioned crystallinity and morphology changes of the perovskite films induced by different self-doping conditions can be described using a schematic as shown in Fig. 3. Generally, the excess inorganic component can always be regarded as the nucleation center,24 and therefore, with the increase of the nucleus, a festinant growth of perovskite crystals and large grains can be obtained. However, with the excess organic component contained in the precursor, the colloidal size reduced which led to much smaller perovskite grains. Therefore, the changeable composition induced crystal changes are illustrated in the diagram. The appropriate excess organic or inorganic components can reduce or increase the perovskite grains. With overmuch organic formamidine, methylamine halide or inorganic lead halide contained in the precursor, the continuous perovskite film cannot be obtained. The overmuch organic formamidine or methylamine covered the perovskite grains and formed big clusters centered with perovskite grains, while the inorganic lead halide residue was isolated at the grain boundaries, which were confirmed by SEM observations. Fig. S4† shows the XPS spectra of organic precursor doping (R = 0.93), no doping (R = 1.00) and inorganic precursor doping (R = 1.08) perovskite films, and the corresponding surface element contents are listed in Table S2.† The surface content of carbon decreased when the R value increased, while the Pb, I and Br elements increased. From the C 1s core level spectra, the C–H bonding strength also decreased when the R value increased. This means that excess organic material exists on the surface of perovskite films. The N 1s, Br and I core level spectra have no obvious differences. However, there are two main Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 peaks at 142.8 eV and 138.1 eV, respectively. Two small peaks located at 141.3 eV and 136.4 eV belong to metallic Pb that appeared in the R = 1.00 and R = 1.08 perovskite, which indicated that excess inorganic component existed on the surface grain boundaries of the perovskite films. These results suggest that the perovskite phase could form in the R value range from 0.35 to 1.4, and the organic doping has higher tolerance to the perovskite phase than inorganic doping.

The self-doping induced photovoltaic parameter changes of perovskite solar cells are shown in Table S3,† and the champion J–V curves are shown in Fig. S5a† and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are consistent with the J–V results (Fig. S5b†). The distribution of results is shown in Fig. 4a–d. The images shown in a, b, c and d are the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE of the different R perovskite based devices, respectively. The average Voc changed with the R values. The samples with R of 0.70, 0.9 3, 1.08, 1.17 and 1.40 exhibited a higher Voc than doping-free (R = 1.00) devices, and this can be ascribed to the increased bandgap of the perovskite and possibly efficient passivation of excess organic or inorganic components. For R < 0.70 and R > 1.40, the increased bandgap of the perovskite has not resulted in a continuous increase in Voc, which may be due to the bad crystallization and morphology of the perovskite layer. However, the Jsc, FF and PCE showed a peak value at R = 1.08. This must be related to the bad film quality with excess organic or inorganic component doping, which caused poor interfaces between the perovskite and the hole transport layer or electron transport layer, blocking the carrier transport.

The photovoltaic conversion performance depends on the crystal quality and also the film and the interfaces of the functional layers.32–35 Another important factor to evaluate the performance of the devices is the hysteresis, which critically relies on the electrical properties of electrons/holes and moveable ions. As the defects and trapping of carriers, as well as the interface transport can be an origin of hysteresis,36–38 self-doping with organic/inorganic species provides a chance to directly evaluate the effects of native defects in the perovskite on the hysteresis. We tested the conductivity of these different perovskite films as shown in Fig. 5a. A significant enhancement in conductivity with the increase of the organic component, indicates that FA+ or MA+ ions may promote the conductivity of PbI2. We also performed the Hall effect tests for the organic/inorganic doped samples. The results confirmed that the organic doped samples possess higher conductivity, however the conductivity of n/p type of semiconductor cannot be determined even when tested under a high-intensity magnetic field (1 T). This may be ascribed to the thin films (<1 μm) of the perovskite and possible accelerated ions moving during the tests which caused unstable carrier transfer mechanisms.

(c) Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of these different perovskite films and (d) the hysteresis index derived from the typical J–V curves at forward and invert scans, respectively. 
As another effective tool for the characterization of the interface properties, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to investigate the charge transport in these different devices.39 The Nyquist plots (Fig. 5b) were obtained in the dark with an applied bias voltage of 0.8 V. The reduced size of circles induced by either organic or inorganic component doping indicated a decreased charge transport resistance except for the R = 1.08 device, which is highly consistent with the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of these different perovskite films (Fig. 5c). The fitted PL decay lifetime of various self-doping perovskite films is shown in Table S4.† With appropriate excess inorganic component doping (R = 1.08), the carrier lifetime has increased significantly while decreased drastically with further increase in the amount of the inorganic component, and the organic component doped perovskites also showed a decreased lifetime. This can be ascribed to the poor quality of perovskite films and induced heavy recombination. The hysteresis results for different samples are shown in Fig. S6.† The hysteresis index of different devices is derived from the typical J–V curves as shown in Fig. 5d. To quantify the hysteresis effect, a dimensional hysteric index (HI) is defined using the following equation:40  where Jscan − (Voc/2) represents the photocurrent at a voltage bias of Voc/2 for the reverse scan (from Voc to Jsc), and similarly Jscan + (Voc/2) represents the photocurrent for the forward scan (from Jsc to Voc). A few of organic or inorganic component doped perovskite devices (R = 0.7–1.17) showed the lowest hysteresis. With more organic or inorganic components, the hysteresis is heavily deteriorated. This is consistent with the above results of EIS and TRPL spectra.
A champion device with a self-doping process is obtained based on appropriate excess inorganic component doped perovskite films (R = 1.08). Fig. 6a shows the corresponding cross-section SEM image of the R = 1.08 device. And the slow sweep J–V curves of the best performing perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 6b. The highest PCE is up to 19.14%, with a high Voc of 1.125 V, a high Jsc of 22.63 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor of 0.752. The EQE spectrum (Fig. 6c) shows the integrated photocurrent which is highly consistent with the J–V test results under AM 1.5 G sun illumination. The photocurrent density and PCE measured as a function of time for the champion device were close to 0.93 V forward bias, and achieved a stable PCE about 18.41% (Fig. S7†). Furthermore, the stability of the best device is also considered in our work. Fig. 6d shows the plot of normalized PCE versus aging time. This champion device was stored in an ambient environment (humidity: 20 RH%) without sealing, and the PCE decreased less than 10% even after 500 hours. This good performance must be related to the high quality crystallized perovskite layers with proper self-doping, which reduced the defects of the films because of larger perovskite crystals with less grain boundaries.

(d) Stability test for the champion device under ambient air with a controlled humidity of about 20 RH% aged for 500 hours. 
In addition, we consider that this enhanced performance can be obtained by appropriate excess inorganic precursor doping. Therefore, an up-scaled device with a big area of 1.21 cm2 based on this processing was fabricated. Fig. 7a shows the corresponding J–V curves of this device with a high efficiency up to 16.20%, and Fig. 7b shows its wet-resistance ability when stored in a high humidity environment (>60 RH%) with a high PCE over 11.2%. Although the current density shows a sharp decrease because of the reaction with water, the Voc and FF show no significant decrease, suggesting low interface charge recombination as can be seen from the detailed parameter changes even after 120 days (Fig. S8†).

Conclusion
In conclusion, self-doping effects on crystallization and electrical properties in a mixed perovskite were studied in detail in this work. On increasing the organic precursor doping amount, the perovskite crystals have been fully covered by the organic component, forming large granular agglomerates. An appropriate amount of organic component doped PSCs show lower hysteresis compared to the inorganic component doped devices. This can be ascribed to the enhancement of the perovskite film conductivity due to the presence of the organic ions. The inorganic precursor doped perovskite films showed enlarged perovskite crystals, and the quality perovskite films and high-performance devices are obtained with 8% extra inorganic precursor (R = 1.08) doping. This self-doped device achieved a best PCE up to 19.14%, and 16.2% for a big area of 1.21 cm2. It also showed lower hysteresis and good stability, which can be ascribed to the big perovskite grains with less grain boundaries and good interfaces which reduced the possible defects and traps. This work distinctly presented a direct observation of the effects of the precursor on perovskite films and their device properties, which provides a measure to fully understand the effect of organic/inorganic ions on the performance of perovskite PSCs.
