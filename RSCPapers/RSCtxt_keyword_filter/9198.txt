    AbstractSphalerite-type (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) nanocrystals with tunable band gaps were successfully prepared via a solvothermal approach. Band gaps of the nanoparticles could be adjusted from 3.48 eV to 1.23 eV by changing the composition. Their implementation in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) suggests considerable potential in solar cells.
Low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells call for new materials and manufacturing approaches, especially in the field of nanocrystal synthesis.1–4 There are several important demands for further photovoltaic materials. Firstly, toxic elements such as cadmium should be avoided so that the materials are environmentally benign.4–6 Secondly, materials should be comprised of abundant and inexpensive elements and prepared via cost-effective routes to reduce the cost of solar cells;7–12 furthermore, tunable band gaps are also required for materials to maximize solar absorption, so that the resulting solar cells would fully use the energy of photons and have remarkable energy conversion efficiencies.13–15 Further nanocrystals that would meet the demands are strongly needed.
Recently, as cost-effective and environmentally benign alternatives to conventional photovoltaic materials, copper-based quaternary chalcogenides, such as CZTS (Cu2ZnSnS4) and CZTSe (Cu2ZnSnSe4), have attracted a great deal of attention. To date, CZTS nanoparticles and CZTSe nanoparticles have been successfully prepared via wet chemical methods.8–12 Here we report the synthesis of composition-adjustable (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) nanoparticles with band gaps changing from 3.48 eV to 1.23 eV and demonstrate their implementation in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).
(Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) nanocrystals were prepared via a solvothermal approach as is shown in the supporting information.† CuCl2·2H2O, SnCl2·2H2O, ZnCl2 and thiocarbamide in ethanol were used as the precursors. The precursors were heated in oleylamine at 200 °C for 10 min. The nanocrystals were precipitated by adding 10 ml ethanol. Cu2ZnSnS4 is an tetragon semiconductor with fixed composition, valence states of which are Cu(I), Sn(IV), Zn(II), S(sulfide phase). In order to keep the balance of charges in the sphalerite-type nanocrystals we prepared, Cu+ and Sn4+ have to be prepared at a fixed ratio (2:1).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was used to confirm the valence states of the (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS nanoparticles as is shown in Fig. 1. The XPS spectra of the four constituent elements indicate Cu(I), Sn(IV), Zn(II), S(sulfide phase) as reported.11,16 The crystal structure of the nanoparticles was investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS nanoparticles prepared with a composition from x = 0 to x = 0.75 exhibit three broad peaks at 2θ = 28.8, 47.8, and 56.5°, which correspond to diffractions of the (111), (220), and (311) planes of sphalerite-type ZnS crystal structure, respectively. The cell constant a = 0.536 nm could be obtained after calculation. So it is clearly shown that all the (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS nanoparticles have the same cubic structure as Fig. 2b. The three kinds of cations (Cu+, Sn4+ and Zn2+) have similar ionic radii.17 Under this condition, cation-disordering arrangement may occur in nanoparticles.18,19 Thus, the cubic structure may be owed to the random arrangement of Cu+, Sn4+ and Zn2+ cations in the 4-coordinate tetrahedral interstitial sites formed by the close packed sulfur atoms, as shown in Fig. 2c.

Two narrow peaks at 932.9 and 952.7 eV, with a peak separation of 19.8 eV, indicate Cu(I). (b) The XPS spectrum of Sn 3d. Two peaks located at 486.3 and 494.7 eV, with a peak separation of 8.4 eV, indicate Sn(IV). (c) The XPS spectrum of Zn 3d. Peaks located at 1022.8 and 1045.8 eV with a peak separation of 23 eV are consistent with zinc(II). (d) The XPS spectrum of S 2p. Peaks located at 162.35 and 163.5 eV are consistent with S in sulfide phases.

Electron diffraction (ED) was used to further examine the crystal structure of nanoparticles. As shown in the ED pattern in Fig. 3d, the three distinct diffraction rings of nanoparticles remain unchanged when the value of x changes from 0 to 0.75. The three diffraction rings are highly consistent with the diffractions of the (112), (220), and (311) planes of the cubic ZnS structure.

Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images are shown in Fig. 3a, b and c. The average sizes determined by TEM images are 3.3 nm, 3.4 nm, 3.3 nm, respectively, at x = 0, 0.24 and 0.75, which suggests that change in the composition did not greatly influence the size and size distribution. Clear lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.311 nm, 0.310 nm, 0.311 nm could be seen from high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (the insets of Fig. 3a, b and c), which agrees well with the interplanar spacing of the (111) crystal plane.
Although there are similar structures and sizes, these nanoparticles show different optical properties. The inset in Fig. 4a shows the photographs of the nanoparticles dispersed in toluene. With increasing content of copper and tin, the nanoparticles change their color from colorless, yellow, orange, and red to black. The absorption spectra of the products are shown in Fig. 4a. There is an absorption onset around 350 nm of ZnS nanoparticles (prepared with x = 0), while the absorption onset of (Cu2Sn)0.25Zn0.25S nanoparticles (the value of x is 0.75) is round 1000 nm. The absorption onsets of (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS (0 < x < 0.75) nanoparticles are red-shifted between 350 nm and 1000 nm consistently with the increasing of Cu+, Sn4+ cations.

ZnS (x = 0) is a typical direct semiconductor, and Cu2ZnSnS4 (x = 0.75) has also been reported as a direct semiconductor.20 Estimated optical band gaps are obtained from the absorption spectra (Fig. S1 in the supporting information†). As is shown in Fig. 4b, corresponding band gaps of the (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) nanoparticles could be adjusted from 3.48 eV (x = 0) to 1.23 eV (x = 0.75). As mentioned above, adjusting the composition could not influence the size of nanoparticles greatly. Thus, it could be assumed that quantum size effect could hardly cause the difference in band gaps between nanoparticles. The difference in band gaps might be attributed to the difference in composition. So it is indicated that band gaps of (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS nanoparticles shrink with the increase in the fraction of Cu+, Sn4+ cations. Especially, changing band gaps of the nanoparticles with composition could fit two different lines:y = −17.37x + 3.414 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.09)y = −1.053x + 2.010 (0.09 ≤ x ≤ 0.75)As reported, the first conduction band of ZnS is made up by Zn-4s states, the valence band below the Fermi level is mainly made up by S-3p states.21 However, the first conduction band of Cu2ZnSnS4 is made up by the corresponding antibonding linear combination of Sn-5s and S-3p states, and the valence band below the Fermi level is mainly made up by Cu-3d states.20 Thus we may deduce: if only a small amount of Zn2+ cations are substituted by Cu+ and Sn4+ cations, energy bands are made up by the electrons of Zn2+ and S2− mainly. However, the doped Cu+ and Sn4+ cations affect the valence band and the conduction band strongly, which made the band gaps have a sharp drop with the increasing Cu+ and Sn4+ cations. When the fraction of Cu+ and Sn4+ cations increases to 9%, it turns to Cu+ and Sn4+ cations which make the main contribution to the first conduction band and the valence band below the Fermi level. Thenceforth, the band gaps shrink slowly and the fitting line shows a gentle slope.
To detect the potential of (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS nanoparticles for solar cells, simple quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs)22–24 were assembled using (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS nanoparticles as photoactive nanoparticles (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b shows the current–voltage characteristics of the solar cell sensitized by (Cu2Sn)0.01Zn0.97S nanoparticles. The parameters for the solar cell under simulated sunlight are as follows: open circuit voltage of 283 mV, short circuit current of 0.36 mA cm−2, fill factor of 28.6% and a power conversion efficiency of 0.03%. There are observably enhanced open circuit voltage, short circuit current and power conversion efficiency of the solar cell sensitized by (Cu2Sn)0.01Zn0.97S nanoparticles (the blue curve) compared to the unsensitized TiO2 film (the green curve). The red curve indicates that there is also photoelectric conversion under simulated visible light. Some other cells are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 in the supporting information.† Further increase in the efficiency may be achieved with advanced devices.

Different colors are used to indicate different conditions; blue: under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2); red: under simulated visible light using a 400 nm cutoff filter; black: in the dark. The green curve shows characteristics of unsensitized TiO2 film for contrast. 
In summary, we have reported the facile synthesis of sphalerite-type (Cu2Sn)x/3Zn1−xS (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) nanoparticles with widely tunable band gaps. Judging from the HRTEM and XRD analyses, the prepared nanoparticles have the same cubic structure. Absorption spectra of the nanoparticles in toluene exhibit distinct onsets changing from 350 nm to 1000 nm by adjusting the chemical composition, which correspond to tunable band gaps from 3.48 eV to 1.23 eV. Considerable potential in photoelectric conversion is revealed from their implementation in QDSSCs.
