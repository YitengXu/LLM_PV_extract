    , Accepted 5th August 2020First published on 5th August 2020AbstractArtificial photosynthetic systems store solar energy in chemical fuels via CO2 reduction or renewable hydrogen evolution from water splitting. But only relatively moderate CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiency (ηSTF < ca. 18%) was achieved previously even using the most active gold-based electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which is much lower than the current highest solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH = 30%). Here, we report a strategy based on a monolithic nanoporous silver-based membrane electrocatalyst (npm-Ag) to increase the density of active sites while breaking the three-phase diffusion-limit length of previous membrane electrodes, improving the effective thickness of the catalyst layer from tens of nanometers to several micrometers without any polymer additive. The npm-Ag showed exceptionally selective reduction of CO2 to CO at low overpotentials (ca. 80%@40 millivolts, ca. 100%@90–290 millivolts). The catalyst also allowed a nearly full use of the photocurrent of the state-of-the-art solar cells and gave a projected maximum ηSTF of ca. 25%. Combined with a NiFe-based O2-evolving anode, a stable CO2-reducing photosynthetic system with an ηSTF of ca. 20.1% was demonstrated experimentally for 28 hours in the absence of a DC/DC converter.
1. Introduction
Immediate action to abate anthropogenic CO2 emissions substantially is imperative given the ongoing trend of rapidly exhausting the remaining carbon budget for the temperature-control targets in the next ca. 10–20 years.1–4 An artificial photosynthetic system capable of both the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water splitting can achieve substantial abatement of CO2 emission and large-scale storage of intermittent solar energy in chemical fuels simultaneously.1,5–7
Among all the possible reduction products of CO2, CO has one of the highest CO2 mitigation capabilities.1 In addition, CO can be conveniently converted to other fuels using existing mature technologies.8 In spite of previous active research efforts,9–16 so far even systems using gold-based electrocatalysts, the most active ones for the CO2RR to CO, have only afforded relatively moderate solar-to-fuel (STF) efficiency of solar-driven electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ηSTF < ca. 18%).12,17 In contrast, a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency up to ca. 30% has been achieved for renewable hydrogen generation with platinum catalysts,18 which sets a benchmark for solar-driven CO2 reduction19 and also casts doubt on the necessity of developing direct solar-driven electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Thus, whether the STF efficiency of solar-driven CO2 reduction can compete with the STH efficiency of renewable hydrogen generation is a fundamental problem of primary importance.
In order to promote the efficiency of CO2 reduction, increasing attention has been paid to the development of new three-phase interface systems where the CO2RR occurs. A polymer binder, such as PTFE, was typically mixed with the catalyst and Nafion to create an active catalyst layer.20–22 However, the binder layer may also block the ion transfer channels, shield the active sites, and impede the gas bubbles releasing, thus sacrifice the catalyst performance.23,24
Here, we report an additive-free monolithic nanoporous silver-based membrane electrocatalyst (npm-Ag) on a nanoporous polypropylene (nanoPP) membrane to achieve high activity and selectivity and durable stability simultaneously for the CO2RR at low overpotentials. An exceptionally selective reduction of CO2 to CO at rather low overpotentials (ca. 80%@40 millivolts, ca. 100%@90–290 millivolts) was obtained. A combined experimental and theoretical analysis suggests that such a nanoporous structure can increase the density of active sites to achieve relatively high CO2RR current density at low overpotentials while breaking the previous three-phase diffusion-limit of membrane-based systems.25–27 The catalyst enables for the first time a nearly full use of the photocurrent of the state-of-the-art solar cells with a projected ηSTF of ca. 25%. Combined with a NiFe-based O2-evolving anode, a stable CO2-reducing photosynthetic system with an exceptionally high ηSTF of ca. 20.1% was demonstrated experimentally for 28 hours in the absence of a DC/DC converter.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials synthesis

Fabrication of vapor-deposited Ag/PP membranes. 
A piece of a nanoPP membrane (Celgard 2500, 25μm thick; Celgard, LLC.) was pre-cleaned by sonication in a mixture of ethanol and ultrapure water and then dried. An Ag layer with three different thicknesses (0.6 μm, 1.2 μm, and 1.8 μm) was then directly deposited onto the nanoPP membrane by E-beam thermal evaporation (SKY Technology Development Co., Ltd, CAS) using a graphite crucible with silver bullets (99.99%; Alfa Aesar).


Synthesis of npm-Ag. 
Ag/PP with an active area of 1.0 cm2 was used as the cathode. A AgCl sample was prepared by anodizing Ag/PP in a 0.1 M HCl solution at 0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, 3 M) with 85% iR compensation for 2 hours. The AgCl/PP sample was then rinsed with plenty of ultrapure water and dried under a flow of N2. npm-Ag was prepared in situ by the galvanostatic method (40 mA cm−2) in a flow cell system under a CO2 atmosphere.


Synthesis of NiFe/NF. 
Nickel foam (NF) and graphite foil were washed successively with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water and then dried. The electrolyte contained 0.7 mL of a 309 mmol L−1 Fe(NO3)3 and Ni(NO3)2 solution, 100 mL of (CH2OH)2, 0.7 mL of H2O and 0.11 g of NH4F. NiFe/NF was prepared through the electrodeposition method in a two-electrode system. The pre-cleaned nickel foam cathode and the graphite foil were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. After deposition at 220 V for 5 minutes, the prepared NiFe/NF was immersed in absolute ethanol for half an hour and dried.

2.2 Characterization
The structures of the prepared samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction on a Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The morphologies were investigated on JSM-7800F Prime apparatus. The cross-sections of AgCl and npm-Ag were prepared using a polisher with Ar ion polishing at −140 °C under liquid nitrogen cooling. The compositions were studied by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) at 10 kV. An automatic contact angle meter (model: SL200KS) was used to measure the static and advancing contact angle of aqueous solutions on the substrate.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements

Calibration of the reference electrode. 
Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) was employed as the reference electrode in all measurements and it was corrected relative to the potential versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the method described below. The calibration was performed in high purity hydrogen (≥99.999%) saturated 1 M KOH. Two cleaned Pt electrodes were applied as the working electrode and counter electrode. The electrolytic cell was gas-tight, and hydrogen gas was purged during the test. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, and the average of the two potentials at which the current crossed zero was taken to be the thermodynamic potential for the hydrogen electrode reactions. The average potential of zero current was around 0.998 V. The measured potentials were rescaled to the RHE using E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.998 V.


Electrochemical reduction of CO2 in a flow cell. 
CO2 (Shanghai Youjiali Gas, ≥99.995%) reduction was performed in a lab-made flow cell with two compartments separated by an anion exchange membrane (Selemion AMV, AGC Inc.). A gas chamber supplied the feed gas on the cathode side while the anode was open to the ambient atmosphere. A platinum wire (Wuhan Gaossunion Technology Co., Ltd., 99.99%) and Ag/AgCl electrode served as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. After CO2 was purged for around 10 min to remove residual air, controlled-potential electrolysis was conducted for an hour in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution using an Interface 1000E potentiostat (Gamry). Ohmic drop correction was performed using the current interrupt method. During the test, the gaseous products were purged from the cell using a continuous flow of CO2 at a rate of 20 sccm regulated using mass flow controllers (MC-100SCCM-D, Alicat Scientific). A peristaltic pump provided the electrolyte at a flow rate of 0.9 mL min−1. After a 1500 second electrolysis, the gaseous products were collected in a gas sampling bag and then quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC, Trace 1300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with two thermal conductivity detectors (TCDs) and one flame ionization detector (FID) to detect H2, CO and hydrocarbons. Calibration of the GC using standard gas mixtures containing H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, and CO2 was carried out for quantification of gaseous samples. The liquid products were collected and analyzed on a 400 MHz NMR instrument using the water suppression mode. Typically, 700 μL of electrolyte was mixed with 35 μL D2O containing a certain amount of DMSO.


Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). 
We used the double layer capacitance method to measure the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was determined by measuring the capacitive current associated with double-layer charging from the scan-rate dependence of CV. Various scan rates for CV were used in the flow cell with a 1 M KOH electrolyte separated with an anion exchange membrane. The Cdl was estimated by plotting the Δj = (ja − jc)/2 (where ja and jc are the anodic and cathodic current densities, respectively) against the scan rates. The slope gives the Cdl values. The ECSA of a sample is calculated from the double-layer capacitance according to  where Cs is the average double-layer capacitance of an atomically smooth metal surface which is assumed to be 25 μF cm−2 and S is the geometric area of the electrode.


Calculation of faradaic efficiencies (%) of gaseous products. 
The faradaic efficiency (FE) for a specific product is calculated using the following equation  where z is the number of electrons involved (for example, z = 2 for reduction of CO2 to CO), n is the number of moles for a specific product, F is Faraday's constant (F = 96485 C mol−1) and Q is the charge passed (C).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 System-level analysis of solar-to-fuel efficiency
An artificial photosynthetic system capable of both the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water splitting can be fabricated by simple wiring of a solar cell and electrolytic cell (Fig. 1a), as long as the solar output voltage is larger than the sum of the electrolytic overpotentials and standard electrolytic cell potential . Alternatively, a DC/DC converter may also be used between the solar cell and the electrolytic cell to adjust the solar output to match the needs of the electrolytic cell, but an additional significant energetic loss would occur.13,30 Such loss was sometimes unintentionally not considered in the literature. In any case, the CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiency of the system is defined straightforwardly as the ratio of chemical energy stored in fuel (PEC-out) to the solar energy input (Psolar-in) as follows (detailed information on another derivation method is available in the ESI†):11,31  Since  and solar power (Psolar = 100 mW cm−2) are constants, high ηSTF requires both high faradaic efficiency for the CO2RR (FECO2RR) and high current density from solar cells (Jsolar) (Fig. 1b). STH efficiency (ηSTH) is similarly determined from the standard cell potential for splitting water , faradaic efficiency (FEH2O) and current density from solar cells (Jsolar). Because most of the CO2 reduction products'  is larger than , the STF efficiency of the CO2RR (ηSTF) should be higher than the STH efficiency (ηSTH) under the same illumination conditions and with the same faradaic efficiencies. But as discussed above, the advancement of increasing ηSTF of the CO2RR falls far behind that of ηSTH presumably due to the more complicated multiple electron/proton transfer mechanism of the CO2RR.12,18,32

(b) A contour plot showing ηSTF as a function of FECO2RR for the formation of CO and Jsolar under 1 sun illumination. (c) J–V curves of a commercial GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell, four Si solar cells connected in series, and three perovskite solar cells connected in series. The J–V curve of the commercial triple-junction GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell was directly measured using a standard solar simulator while those of state-of-the-art silicon28 and perovskite29 solar cells were projected based on the literature reports. (d) Schematic for potential distribution and photovoltage of an idealized CO2-reducing photosynthetic device: ηCO2/CO stands for the overpotential of the cathode for CO2 reduction to CO, ηOER stands for the overpotential of the anode for the OER, and ηohmic stands for the ohmic loss for the electrolyte and membrane. J–V curves for the GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell (blue) and a typical anode (red) and cathode (grey) are shown with their relative potential contributions in an ideal tandem device. 
Commercial solar cells typically display a relatively flat working zone with a nearly maximal Jsolar, while the Jsolar outside this flat zone decreases abruptly as the voltage increases. Thus, we reasoned that the flat zone with an output voltage greater than the standard cell potential for the combination of the CO2RR with the OER (e.g. 1.34 V for CO2RR to CO), rather than the maximal power-output point, would be the optimal working zone to power the electrolysis and enable the system to achieve a nearly maximal ηSTF. For example, a stable Jsolar of ca. 15.2 mA cm−2 in the region of 1.34–2.20 V (Fig. 1c) is observed for a commercial GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell—a frequently used cell in photosynthetic systems since it has the largest output voltage among all the commercial ones (Table S1†). Alternative solar cells, such as the Si solar cell,28 the currently dominant commercial one, and perovskite solar cell,29 whose power conversion efficiency has increased rapidly recently, only afford output voltages smaller than . By connecting them in series to provide a sufficient driving force (Fig. 1c), a wide range of solar cells can also be used, but Jsolar would be reduced, resulting in lower ηSTF.
From a system-level consideration, we noted that there are three basic requirements for the electrolytic cell to fully utilize the solar-cell photocurrent and maximize the ηSTF: (i) lowering the electrolytic overpotentials to allow the solar cell to function steadily in the optimal zone (Fig. 1d); (ii) increasing FECO2RR to 100% in the region of low electrolytic overpotentials (<300 mV, Table S2†); and (iii) maintaining an electrolytic geometric current density in the 100%-FECO2RR region (JCO2RR) not smaller than the optimal-zone Jsolar. However, even the best catalysts using gold33 or non-noble elements34 for the CO2RR to CO (ca. 40–60%-FECO2RR at −0.2 V versus RHE; ca. 90–95%-FECO2RR at −0.3 to −0.4 V versus RHE) could not satisfy these three basic requirements, not allowing the full use of the photocurrent of the state-of-the-art solar cells in CO2-reducing artificial photosynthesis.
3.2 Nanoporous Ag-based membrane gas diffusion electrode for the CO2RR
Silver was chosen as the target electrocatalyst for the CO2RR since it is ca. 100 times cheaper than gold and has been successfully used as a catalyst in large-scale industrial applications, such as chlor-alkali electrolysis35 and epoxidation of ethylene.36 Techno-economic analyses show similar whole-system costs for cells with electrodes using silver or non-noble elements, while gold increases the cost significantly.37 Here we explored a set of two-layer GDEs for the CO2RR—a gas-permeable nanoporous polypropylene membrane (nanoPP, average pore size: ca. 166 nm) coated with a layer of the Ag-based membrane electrocatalyst. A hierarchically nanoporous structure was adapted to construct a robust and efficient tridimensional gas-liquid-solid three-phase interface between the silver, H2O and CO2 for the CO2RR (Fig. 2a). Compared to the three recently developed GDEs based on carbon paper,38 Teflon19 and a polyethylene membrane,26 the present nanoPP provides a low-cost, yet mechanically/thermally robust barrier that can increase the lifetime of GDEs in the three-phase environment of the CO2RR due to its anti-flooding properties (Fig. S1†).

(d) SEM image of the npm-Ag showing the simultaneous formation of abundant large channels (ca. 534 ± 153 nm) and small pores (ca. 68.5 ± 26.0 nm) upon cathodic reduction of the as-prepared AgCl film. The inset shows a high resolution SEM image. (e) A cross-sectional SEM image showing the presence of more large channels/gaps in the bottom part of the npm-Ag than in the top part. The inset shows a high resolution SEM image. 
E-beam evaporation was initially used to deposit an Ag film with three different thicknesses (ca. 600 nm, 1200 nm, and 1800 nm) onto one side of the nanoPP. The film is essentially composed of closely packed irregular Ag nanoparticles (ca. 252 ± 133 nm) (Fig. S2a–c†). A circular lattice expansion and shrinkage strategy (Fig. S3†) was next used to create the hierarchically nanoporous structure. Anodic oxidation of the films in aqueous HCl converted the Ag nanoparticles to AgCl micro domains (0.848 ± 0.357 μm) (Fig. 2b, S2d–f†). The topological organization of the domains appears to be a typical Voronoi diagram (Fig. 2c, S4†), a mathematical model that can rationalize spatiotemporal dynamics of domain growth process. Concomitant lattice expansion in the oxidation increased the film thickness by ca. 2.4 times to ca. 1.44 μm, 2.80 μm, and 4.50 μm, respectively (Fig. S2g–i and Table S5†). Subsequent cathodic reduction removed Cl− from the AgCl lattice, leading to the formation of abundant large channels/gaps (average size: ca. 534 ± 153 nm) at domain boundaries and small pores in the domains due to lattice shrinkage and Cl− loss (Fig. 2d, S5 and S6†). The average size of the small pores is ca. 68.5 ± 26.0 nm (Fig. S6c†). The higher fraction of large channels/gaps at the bottom than at the top is another notable feature of the final npm-Ag (Fig. 2f, S6d and e†), which may arise from mismatch between nanoPP and Ag at the interface.
The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves under one atmosphere of Ar or CO2 indicate that all GDEs, denoted as npm-Ag-1.44/2.80/4.50 μm, exhibited excellent electrocatalytic CO2RR activities at low overpotentials while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was suppressed to a great extent (Fig. 3a). The onset potentials of the CO2RR are very close or virtually identical to −0.11 V versus RHE (inset, Fig. 3a), the standard electrode potential for the CO2RR to CO. The selective formation of CO at low overpotentials was confirmed by gas chromatography, while no liquid-phase product was detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S7†). In particular, a FECO2RR of ca. 80% for CO was observed for npm-Ag-2.80 μm at an exceptionally low potential of −0.15 V versus RHE, equivalent to an overpotential as low as 40 mV. The FECO2RR increased to 95–97% at −0.20 V versus RHE for all three GDEs and reached ca. 100% at −0.3 to −0.4 V versus RHE for all electrodes except npm-Ag-4.50 μm (Fig. 3b, S8†), while only lower FECO2RR at similar overpotentials was obtained for the previous best catalysts.33,34 The partial current density for CO (JCO = 18.4 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V versus RHE, npm-Ag-2.80 μm) (Fig. 3b) exceeded Jsolar, which enables full utilization of the photocurrent from the state-of-the-art solar cells.

(b) Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of CO for npm-Ag-2.80 μm as a function of potential versus RHE/overpotential versus E0CO (−0.11 V vs. RHE). (c) Specific partial current density of CO for different npm-Ag electrodes as a function of potential versus RHE. 
We next performed studies to investigate the origin of the superior CO2RR activity of the npm-Ag electrodes. These electrodes share similar morphologies (Fig. S5†) and XRD patterns (Fig. S3c†), suggesting the presence of similar active sites. Thus, the activity difference among these electrodes may be attributed to the difference in either interfacial mass transport or geometric density of active sites. Measurement of the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) (Fig. S8d†) indicates that the surface roughness increases as the film thickness increases. Accordingly, npm-Ag-4.50 μm should have the highest geometric density of active sites. But since it has lower JCO than npm-Ag-2.80 μm, interfacial mass transport appears to outweigh geometric density of active sites for npm-Ag-4.50 μm. Notably, a similar diffusion-limited behavior of JCO was observed at a thickness greater than ca. 500 nm for the catalyst layer in a previous study of the Ag-catalyzed CO2RR to CO.39 In sharp contrast, npm-Ag-1.44 μm and npm-Ag-2.80 μm show similar specific current density JCO curves (Fig. 3c), strongly suggesting that both have similar types of active sites and diffusion is not a limiting factor even for a catalyst layer as thick as ca. 3 μm for the present structure.
The hierarchically nanoporous structure of npm-Ag electrocatalysts appears to have high geometric density of active sites due to small pores and fast interfacial mass transport due to large pores/channels in synergy. Such a synergy effect can be rationalized by the unique ability of the hierarchically nanoporous structure to create abundant three-phase interfaces that can facilitate concomitant diffusion of CO2 and the electrolyte to the electrocatalytic surfaces. According to the relationship between the critical pore size (Lc) and critical burst-through pressure (ΔP) (eqn (S7)†), the pore size distribution directly influences the volume fraction of wetted pores, i.e. saturation, in the catalyst layer. Due to the hydrophilic nature of the Ag surface (θa = 89°, Fig. S9†), wetting occurs at small pores initially and then large pores as the pressure increases (Fig. S10†). When only small pores exist, full saturation of the layer tends to occur, while only large pores may lead to zero saturation at the same pressure. A combination of both, however, should favor a partial wetting state and thus create more three-phase interfaces in the layer. Consequently, the higher fraction of large channels/gaps at the bottom of the npm-Ag (vide supra) should lead to less wetting volume, consistent with the observed lower amount of potassium at the bottom than at the top (Fig. S5j and k†).
3.3 System for the CO2RR driven by a solar cell
The performance of npm-Ag-2.80 μm for the CO2RR satisfies the aforementioned three basic requirements to fully utilize the photocurrent of commercial solar cells with a matching Jsolar (Tables S1 and S2†). With this in hand, we next developed a forest-like NiFe-based OER electrocatalyst via electrodeposition of Ni and Fe onto commercial Ni foam. A high potential (220 V) was applied across the electrodeposition cell to cover the Ni foam with a high surface area of Ni/Fe oxides/hydroxides (Fig. S11†). The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared NiFe-based catalyst is comparable to the best in the literature.40,41 In particular, a current density of the OER of JOER = 15.0 mA cm−2 was achieved at a low overpotential of 230 mV. The stability tests were performed in 1 M KOH by chronopotentiometric measurements at 100 mA cm−2 for 28 h and the average overpotential was measured to be 285 mV.
A full electrolytic cell separated by an anion-exchange membrane was subsequently fabricated by combining npm-Ag-2.80 μm with the NiFe-based catalyst. Thanks to the superior performance of both catalysts at low half-cell overpotentials, the onset full-cell potential for the electrolysis is very close to 1.34 V, the standard cell potential for the combination of the CO2RR to CO with the OER (Fig. 4a, inset). The commercial triple-junction GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell with the J–V curve shown in Fig. 1c was used to power the electrolysis under continuous illumination with a standard AM 1.5 G solar light at room temperature. The resultant photosynthetic system was obtained for the formation of CO leading to an ηSTF peaking at 20.4% (Fig. 4b, Table S4†), much higher than those of the previous best systems (Fig. 4c, Table S5†). The photosynthesis was stable for 28 hours with an average ηSTF of 20.1%. Morphology characterization of the npm-Ag electrodes before and after the stability test suggests that catalyst nanoclustering occurs unavoidably at the local sites around the small pores while the hierarchically nanoporous framework remains relatively stable during electrolysis (Fig. S5 and S12†). The stable Jsolar and FECO over 28 h indicates the importance of the framework in maintaining catalytic stability.

(a) J–V curves of a commercial triple-junction GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell (red) and an electrolytic cell using the npm-Ag-2.80 μm cathode for the CO2RR and a NiFe-based anode for the OER (blue). The inset shows an onset potential around 1.34 V, the standard cell potential for the combination of the CO2RR to CO with the OER. (b) Faradaic efficiency for CO (blue) and CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiency (red) of the system as a function of time. (c) Benchmarks of STF efficiency for EC-PV systems and their corresponding stabilities (see Table S5† for specific information). (d) Comparison of previously reported CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiencies achieved with a perovskite solar cell9 (solid orange), Si based solar cell42 (solid blue) and GaAs based solar cell12 (solid red) and projected CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiencies for the present photosynthetic systems powered by the state-of-the-art solar cells: perovskite solar cell (dashed orange), Si based solar cell (dashed blue) and GaAs based solar cell (dashed red). 
Since the maximum Jsolar has been reported to reach 17.5 mA cm−2 for a commercial GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell,12 the photosynthetic system using such a solar cell would lead to a projected ηSTF of 23.4% (Fig. 4d). And, if our unique CO2RR electrolysis system is powered by other types solar cells, such as Si solar cells28 in series and perovskite solar cells29 in series (Fig. 1c), the projected ηSTF of the photosynthetic system could be boosted from the reported 6.5% (ref. 9) and 10% (ref. 42) to 11.5% and 14%, respectively.
The total working overpotential for the whole photosynthetic system was ca. 780 mV (Fig. 4a). Based on the measured current of the whole system, the overpotential of either the npm-Ag cathode for the CO2RR (ca. 300 mV) or the NiFe-based anode for the OER (ca. 230 mV) could be deduced, respectively, according to the corresponding half-cell J–V curves. And the ohmic loss across the electrolyte and membrane (ca. 250 mV) was consistent with the aforementioned potential distribution in photosynthetic systems. Since both the cathode for the CO2RR and the anode for the OER achieved high performances under rather low overpotentials, reducing the ohmic loss might be a straightforward way to lower the electrolytic overpotential. Using membrane-electrode assembly systems may result in a reduction of ohmic loss by ca. 100 mV (ref. 43), leading to an overall cell potential of ca. 2 V. However, even with such a hypothetical electrolytic cell in hand, the Jsolar for the CO2RR supplied by the state-of-the-art solar cells still could not exceed 17.5 mA cm−2, giving a projected ηSTF of 23.4% as the highest achievable ηSTF for the state-of-the-art solar cells at present.
4. Conclusion
Different from the traditional methods, we provide a new strategy to extend the effective thickness of the catalyst layer to the micrometer scale without any polymer additive. A monolithic nanoporous silver-based membrane electrocatalyst for selective, efficient, and durable reduction of CO2 to CO was developed, using which a photosynthetic system with an ηSTF exceeding 20% was achieved experimentally with the assistance of a commercial solar cell. Provided that future progress can lead to suitable solar cells with a Jsolar higher than 18.4 mA cm−2, full exploitation of the present electrolytic cell to achieve a projected ηSTF of ca. 25% would also be realized. This result shows that it’s more important to increase Jsolar rather than the maximal solar-to-power efficiency for the application of solar cells in artificial photosynthesis. We hope that the present work will inspire future research in CO2RR artificial photosynthesis by introducing such a nanoporous membrane structure into various electrocatalysts to enhance activity, selectivity and stability at low overpotentials simultaneously.

 	Fig. 1  System-level analysis and performance of CO2-reducing photosynthesis powered by a commercial solar cell. (a) Schematic for the present CO2-reducing photosynthetic system. (b) A contour plot showing ηSTF as a function of FECO2RR for the formation of CO and Jsolar under 1 sun illumination. (c) J–V curves of a commercial GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell, four Si solar cells connected in series, and three perovskite solar cells connected in series. The J–V curve of the commercial triple-junction GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell was directly measured using a standard solar simulator while those of state-of-the-art silicon28 and perovskite29 solar cells were projected based on the literature reports. (d) Schematic for potential distribution and photovoltage of an idealized CO2-reducing photosynthetic device: ηCO2/CO stands for the overpotential of the cathode for CO2 reduction to CO, ηOER stands for the overpotential of the anode for the OER, and ηohmic stands for the ohmic loss for the electrolyte and membrane. J–V curves for the GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell (blue) and a typical anode (red) and cathode (grey) are shown with their relative potential contributions in an ideal tandem device.	 

 	Fig. 2  Structure and characterization of the npm-Ag gas-diffusion electrode for the CO2RR. (a) Schematic of the present three-phase gas-diffusion electrode for the CO2RR. (b) SEM image of an AgCl film prepared by anodic oxidation of a vapor-deposited Ag film. (c) A Voronoi diagram. (d) SEM image of the npm-Ag showing the simultaneous formation of abundant large channels (ca. 534 ± 153 nm) and small pores (ca. 68.5 ± 26.0 nm) upon cathodic reduction of the as-prepared AgCl film. The inset shows a high resolution SEM image. (e) A cross-sectional SEM image showing the presence of more large channels/gaps in the bottom part of the npm-Ag than in the top part. The inset shows a high resolution SEM image.	 

 	Fig. 3  Performance of various npm-Ag electrodes for the CO2RR. (a) LSV curves for different npm-Ag electrodes under 1 atmosphere of Ar or CO2 (scan rate: 10 mV s−1). (b) Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of CO for npm-Ag-2.80 μm as a function of potential versus RHE/overpotential versus E0CO (−0.11 V vs. RHE). (c) Specific partial current density of CO for different npm-Ag electrodes as a function of potential versus RHE.	 

 	Fig. 4  System-level validation of CO2-reducing photosynthesis powered by a commercial solar cell. (a) J–V curves of a commercial triple-junction GaInP/GaInAs/Ge solar cell (red) and an electrolytic cell using the npm-Ag-2.80 μm cathode for the CO2RR and a NiFe-based anode for the OER (blue). The inset shows an onset potential around 1.34 V, the standard cell potential for the combination of the CO2RR to CO with the OER. (b) Faradaic efficiency for CO (blue) and CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiency (red) of the system as a function of time. (c) Benchmarks of STF efficiency for EC-PV systems and their corresponding stabilities (see Table S5† for specific information). (d) Comparison of previously reported CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiencies achieved with a perovskite solar cell9 (solid orange), Si based solar cell42 (solid blue) and GaAs based solar cell12 (solid red) and projected CO2-reducing solar-to-fuel efficiencies for the present photosynthetic systems powered by the state-of-the-art solar cells: perovskite solar cell (dashed orange), Si based solar cell (dashed blue) and GaAs based solar cell (dashed red).
