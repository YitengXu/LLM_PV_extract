    First published on 27th June 2018AbstractCompatible energy storage devices that are able to withstand various mechanical deformations, while delivering their intended functions, are required in wearable technologies. This imposes constraints on the structural designs, materials selection, and miniaturization of the cells. To date, extensive efforts have been dedicated towards developing electrochemical energy storage devices for wearables, with a focus on incorporation of shape-conformable materials into mechanically robust designs that can be worn on the human body. In this review, we highlight the quantified performances of reported wearable electrochemical energy storage devices, as well as their micro-sized counterparts under specific mechanical deformations, which can be used as the benchmark for future studies in this field. A general introduction to the wearable technology, the development of the selection and synthesis of active materials, cell design approaches and device fabrications are discussed. It is followed by challenges and outlook toward the practical use of electrochemical energy storage devices for wearable applications.

1. Introduction
Wearable technology, as suggested by the name, is about ‘wearing the technology’. It includes all the technologies that are worn by a person or with that person for a prolonged period of time regardless of the situation and position of that person. It is a collective term for anything that combines technology and fashion, and can be in the form of devices, apparels or textiles that are able to assist and anticipate the need or monitor the well-being of its user.1,2 In fact, people have been wearing technologies for centuries. For instance, eyeglasses, a technology to improve the eyesight of its wearer, have been worn since the 11th century. The timekeeping technology (i.e. watches) has been widely used since the 16th century. Following the development of wearable computers in the 19th century, wearable technology has been spreading rapidly into various dimensions of human life, such as sport, healthcare, security, recreation and many more.3 Furthermore, fast advances in materials science, computing and physics have enabled the fabrications of a wide range of wearable electronic products, such as electronic skins, smart fashions, medical devices, sensors, displays and cameras (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Examples of electronic wearable devices and the design approaches of wearable electrochemical energy storage devices. 
Customization of devices plays an important role in the advancement of the wearable technology. In general, wearable technology should exhibit the following characteristics.1 (i) Wearability: the technology can be safely attached to users’ bodies without restricting the movement and primary activity of the wearers, such that they are able to continue their activities and rarely aware of its presence. (ii) Functionability: the technology is able to perform the targeted tasks with little or no set-up required. Ideally, it should be able to improve the situational awareness of the users by being attentive to the environmental changes. (iii) Durability: the technology can be used in most situations and conditions, performing the targeted tasks effectively and efficiently under various and repeated mechanical deformations over a certain period of time. (iv) Compatibility: the technology should be compatible with the needs of the users (e.g. physical, aesthetic). In order to satisfy these requirements, knowledge of the structural and properties of the materials for different device components, as well as device fabrication strategies, is needed.
Power management is one of the most challenging aspects in wearable technology. Energy storage devices are needed to secure uninterrupted power supply for wearable devices. The ever-increasing functionalities of wearable devices require additional power that needs to be stored within a limited area of footprint. Innovation is needed to miniaturize energy storage devices (e.g. microbatteries) and/or to integrate the energy storage function into the structures of the devices (e.g. structural batteries). Furthermore, the odd shapes and sizes of wearable devices, such as electronic skins and smart contact lens, require energy storage devices with high safety and unique design, which are challenging to build using traditional fabrication methods. Thanks to the advanced nanotechnology, the past two decades have witnessed considerable progress in improving the electrochemical performance (i.e. capacity/capacitance, cycle life, energy density) of energy storage devices with conventional designs.4–6 However, these designs are typically rigid and bulky due to the employment of non-conformable components, non-flexible designs and conventional assembly methods, which hinder their practical applications in wearable technology.
In addition, other requirements are imposed on wearable energy storage devices. Firstly, the mechanical integrity and performance of wearable energy storage devices should not degrade even if they are subjected to various and repeated mechanical deformations, such as bending, twisting, flexing, folding, rolling, stretching, washing, or any of their combinations. While recent studies have reported the quantifiable performance of fully-assembled devices during mechanical deformations, early research on pliable energy storage often used the flexed electrodes or LED lighting of deformed devices to demonstrate their flexibility.7–12 Apart from mechanical deformations, the washability of energy storage devices is important for smart clothing applications. Ideally, the devices should be water-proof and able to withstand a few tens of washing cycles.13 Furthermore, wearable energy storage devices need to be in the desirable mass and shape with good safety during the operation. The comfort and breathability of energy storage devices also need to be considered for their long-term attachment onto human skin. Therefore, stringent requirements on materials selection, cell design and device miniaturization are imposed on the fabrication of such energy storage devices for wearable applications.
Flexible electrochemical energy storage devices (i.e. batteries and supercapacitors) have been reviewed in the literature within the past three years.14–22 The discussions mostly focused on the materials perspective and fabrication methods for each component of the devices (e.g. materials for anodes, cathodes and electrolytes).14,16,17,19–23 Other reviews have targeted on a specific feature of flexible energy storage devices. For example, Hu et al.15 addressed the mechanical aspect of flexible batteries. Zhang et al.22 reviewed the progress of flexible Li–sulfur batteries, while Peng et al.18 focused on the design and fabrication of 1D energy harvesting and storage devices. Complementary to the existing reviews, in this review, we will summarize the promising energy storage devices for wearable applications based on their design approach (i.e. layered, planar and cable; Fig. 1), with an emphasis on their wearability and durability at the device level. For each specific design approach, the rationale for the selection and synthesis of materials as well as the electrochemical performance of devices will be elaborated, offering a distinctive viewpoint for researchers who are going to prepare novel materials for a specific cell configuration. To highlight, instead of classifying the literature according to the materials of specific devices’ components, classification based on the cell design provides a fair comparison of the electrochemical and mechanical performances at the device level, as the devices fabricated via the same design approach are more likely to have comparable masses of active materials or similar physical restrictions under mechanical deformations. Additionally, the most promising studies are summarized in Tables 1–6, offering a straightforward comparison of the materials, and electrochemical and mechanical performances of the selected devices. Hence, the discussion based on the proposed classification approach will provide easy referencing for future studies in this field.

2. Overview of electrochemical energy storage devices
Electrochemical energy storage devices store electrical energy in the form of chemical energy or vice versa, in which heterogeneous chemical reactions take place via charge transfer to or from the electrodes (i.e. anodic or cathodic). The charge balance in the system is maintained by the movement of ions and electrons through the electrolyte and external circuit, respectively. Electrochemical energy storage devices should be able to store and deliver energy over a certain period of use. These functions are quantified by parameters including capacity or capacitance (i.e. the amount of charges stored in the device per unit mass/length/area/volume), energy and power density, and the cycle life during continuous charge and discharge tests.
Specifically speaking, the specific capacity of a battery during discharge can be obtained from Faraday's first law. It depends on the number of transferred electrons during the redox reaction and the molecular weight of the limiting electrode. Most of the time, the reactants are not 100% utilized during discharge, resulting in lower capacity of the battery compared to its theoretical capacity. Furthermore, the large iR drop at high charge/discharge rates further reduces the capacity of the battery. The operating voltage of the battery is capped by its open circuit voltage that can be obtained from the Nernst equation. It is determined by the energy involved in both electronic and ionic transfers. Thus, the electronic band structure and the barrier height for ionic motion should be considered to optimize the operating voltage of the battery. Due to the restriction in the energy gap, Eg, between the HOMO and LUMO of liquid electrolyte as well as the attainable difference between the chemical potential of the anode and cathode, the magnitude of the open circuit voltage is usually less than 5 V.24 Both the capacity and operating voltage of the battery will determine the energy density of the battery. The high capacities and large potential difference of both electrodes (i.e. the more negative potential of the anode and the more positive potential of the cathode) lead to a high energy density of the battery. Although energy density per unit mass is commonly reported, energy density per unit volume is more useful for devices that are constrained by the volume. Another parameter, i.e. power density, is the product of the discharge current and the voltage of the battery. Large internal resistance and polarization losses normally reduce the output power of the battery.
Li-ion batteries are the most versatile energy storage devices which are currently dominating the battery market.25 During discharge, intercalated Li-ions in the oxidized anode are released, migrate through the electrolyte and get intercalated into the cathode. Concurrently, electrons flow through the external circuit to release the energy. The reverse reaction occurs during the charge process. In general, the electrodes of Li-ion batteries are made of non-flexible materials, such as Li-containing metal oxides or phosphates, graphite, Si, or Sn.5 Despite the high performance of Li-ion batteries, the risk of flammability is a major concern for their wearable applications. Advanced sealing technologies are required to ensure the safety of the device, which further increases the already expensive production cost of Li-ion batteries. Hence, a safer and more cost-effective option, such as Zn-based batteries, is also pursued for wearable applications. Zinc, the fourth most mined metal material on earth, is a noncombustible and nontoxic element. It has a reasonably high theoretical specific capacity (820 vs. 3861 A h kg−1 for Li) with much higher volumetric capacity (5854 vs. 2062 A h L−1 for Li) benefitting from its much larger material density (7.14 vs. 0.534 g cm−3 for Li). Its good reducing capability renders its convenience for pairing with another electrode to produce a practical cell voltage of up to 1.65 V, which, however, is much lower than that of a typical Li battery using non-aqueous electrolyte (3.6 V).
Supercapacitors are another class of promising electrochemical energy storage devices usable for wearable technology. They generally possess higher power density than lithium batteries and higher energy density than conventional capacitors, with the electrical energy stored as accumulated charges in the electrical double layer.26–28 Pseudocapacitive materials provide an additional faradaic charge storage mechanism to further increase the capacitance of the supercapacitors. These materials can be metal oxides (e.g. RuO2, MnO2, V2O5, NiO, Co3O4), conducting polymers (e.g. polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene), or some of their combinations.5,27,29 Despite a similar cell configuration to lithium batteries, the material requirements for supercapacitors are relatively simpler. Their two electrodes can consist of the same active materials without the need for including specific elements (e.g. Li), offering good flexibility in the choice of electrodes. Meanwhile, a wide range of materials with unique properties have shown promising supercapacitive behaviors, providing more opportunities to advance the design of wearable supercapacitors. Thanks to the prominent merits, flexible and stretchable electrodes for supercapacitors have been demonstrated, and the efforts were broadly reviewed from the angle of electrode fabrication for devices with layered designs.12,14,30–34 In the present review, we deliberately leave out flexible supercapacitors with conventional layered designs, but focus on high-performance wearable supercapacitors using a solid or gel electrolyte that have demonstrated good mechanical robustness at the device level.
Miniaturized energy storage devices, e.g. micro-supercapacitors and micro-batteries, are needed to power small scale devices in wearable technology, such as sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). These tiny power sources are usually designed in planar or cable forms. In a planar design, the active materials are deposited onto micro-sized, interdigitated-patterned current collectors. The flexibility of the device is achieved by patterning the interdigitated current collectors on a flexible substrate. On the other hand, the cable type utilizes micro-fiber electrodes and shares a similar configuration to cable batteries/supercapacitors but typically with a much smaller diameter (<50 μm). Nevertheless, in some cases, the terms ‘micro-supercapacitor’ and ‘micro-battery’ have been loosely used for energy storage devices with diameters up to few hundred micrometers.
In a typical preparation of electrodes for a battery or a supercapacitor, powders of active materials, binder and additives are mixed to form a slurry, which is subsequently coated on a metal foil current collector. Despite the use of a polymer binder which helps in holding the active materials together, their segregation and detachment from the current collector often take place under continuous physical deformations. In addition, the electrolyte in the battery may leak out upon the rupture of its sealing package from repetitive deformations. Thus, advances in the materials and cell designs are needed in wearable energy storage devices. This review addresses the recent development of the materials and cell designs of electrochemical energy storage devices for wearable applications. The discussions will focus on the promising batteries, supercapacitors and micro-energy storage devices that have demonstrated quantitative mechanical flexibility at the device level. Parameters including the capacity/capacitance, energy density, cycling stability and wearability of fully-assembled devices under specific strains, bending angles, or bending diameters will be used as references to quantify the mechanical robustness of the devices. The section is divided according to the design approach of the energy storage devices (i.e. layered, planar and cable designs). Under each design approach, the literature is further classified according to the materials and fabrication approaches. To conclude, the remaining challenges are discussed with an outlook toward the practical use of electrochemical energy storage devices with different design approaches for wearable applications.
3. Cell design and choices of materials
3.1. Layered design
In a layered design, the electrolyte is sandwiched between two electrodes facing each other. Currently, this design is mostly employed in electrochemical energy storage devices (Tables 1 and 2), allowing optimum ionic diffusion and contact at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces. The mechanical flexibility is generally introduced by incorporating flexible components (i.e. electrode and electrolyte) into the devices. A typical example is to replace the rigid and heavy metallic current collector with a flexible, conducting, large surface area and lightweight substrate. The active materials are then deposited, grown, or embedded on such substrates. Ideally, the active materials shall form a highly active and conductive film without the need for any substrate. However, most of the active materials are available only in the powder form and mostly semiconducting. Hence, mechanically stable and conductive substrates are required to fabricate the electrode for wearable energy storage devices.

3.1.1. Carbon-based electrodes. 
Carbon-based materials are often used as flexible and conducting substrates for batteries (Tables 1 and 2).35–39 Their low mass density compared to metallic current collectors is advantageous to enhance the energy density of the batteries. Besides their excellent mechanical and electrical properties, they also provide high surface area to anchor the active materials directly. In this way, the direct and strong attachment of active materials onto the carbon substrates not only improves the charge transfer process, but also maintains the structural integrity under physical deformations. Early studies on carbon substrate based materials focused on the development of various synthetic methods to optimize their mechanical and electrochemical properties, while electrochemical tests were mainly performed in coin cells and/or with a Li metal anode.38–43 In the following paragraphs, we discuss the different types of carbon current collectors used in flexible batteries, focusing on the full-cells that have demonstrated mechanical flexibility at the device level.
Carbon cloth current collectors. 
Active materials in this case are physically coated on a carbon cloth substrate.44 To simplify the fabrication process and improve the adhesion to the substrate, direct growth of active materials on carbon cloth is seen as the approach of choice. For instance, ZnCo2O4 nanowires and MoS2 nanoflakes were grown on carbon cloth.45,46 The typical synthesis required several-step processes; in one of them, the carbon cloth was introduced into a solution containing metal precursors during the hydrothermal treatment. A pouch cell with a ZnCo2O4/carbon cloth anode and a LiCoO2 cathode was able to deliver a specific capacity of 1300 mA h g−1, which was fully retained after 120 cycles of repetitive bending at 60°.45 With a similar cell configuration, a battery using a MoS2/carbon cloth anode showed lower electrochemical and mechanical performances, giving an areal capacity of 1.41 mA h cm−2 at a bending angle of 60°.46
Carbon cloth coated with electrocatalysts also serves as an air electrode in flexible Zn–air batteries with gel electrolyte. Bifunctional electrocatalysts are needed to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during the discharge and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during the charge, respectively.47–53 In general, the use of a CNT catalyst onto carbon cloth improves its mechanical properties.47,50,54,55 For instance, a Zn–air battery with a LaNiO3/CNT coated carbon cloth air cathode exhibited good flexibility and delivered a discharge voltage of 1.2 V. The battery was found to sustain stable performance over 120 discharge/charge cycles in its folded state (bending angle: 180°).50 As an alternative to commercial carbon cloth, a carbon film with high surface area (specific area: 1249 m2 g−1) was also synthesized from pyrolyzed polyimide and employed as an air cathode in a flexible Zn–air battery. Unfortunately, despite its scalability and high surface area, the pyrolyzed carbon was unable to provide the resultant Zn–air battery with desirable performances due to its unsatisfactory catalytic activity towards the ORR and/or OER. At a bending angle of 150°, it was only able to survive 35 discharge/charge cycles with a cut-off discharge voltage of 1 V.56
CNT and graphene film current collectors. 
Conducting substrates made of freestanding CNTs and graphene offer the possibility of control over the electrode thickness (e.g. 1–3 μm).57–61 Despite its facile synthesis, the obtained Co3O4 catalyst grown on a crosslinked N-CNT aerogel as an air cathode only enabled a flexible Zn–air battery to complete 20 cycles of discharge/charge in its flat state.59 In the case of Li-ion batteries, the use of a CNT film attached to a membrane coated with active electrode materials gave fairly stable electrochemical and mechanical performances.58 An areal capacity of 0.94 mA h cm−2 was sustained over 450 charge/discharge cycles in its relaxed state and after 400 cycles of bending at various radii (up to a bending angle of 150°, Fig. 2b). The anode and the cathode of the battery were prepared by dip-coating, such that the non-woven membranes could be uniformly covered with the active materials Li4Ti5O12 and LiCoO2. The CNT film (3 μm thick) was prepared separately by spray-coating the CNT ink onto a stainless steel substrate. Subsequently, the membranes coated with the active materials were transferred to the CNT film inside a water bath prior to the assembly of the cell (Fig. 2a).58

3.1.2. Electrolytes. 
Gel electrolytes. 
Apart from flexible electrodes, shape conformable and non-flow electrolytes are also crucial to further improve the safety, versatility and mechanical robustness of wearable energy storage devices. Despite that, the development of flexible electrolytes is rather limited compared to the active research on flexible electrodes.15,80 To date, most of the flexible Li batteries with layered design have employed lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) salt in a mixed organic carbonate solvent as the electrolyte.44–46,58,60,61 A fairly straightforward method to obtain a flexible electrolyte is to introduce polymer as the gelling agent. For example, a rollable Li-ion battery was prepared from a gel electrolyte of LiPF6/PVDF-HFP, infiltrated into a Si–Cu core–shell nanowire flexible anode, where the excess amount of electrolyte on the nanowires was subsequently used as a separator. The roll-up Li-ion battery with a LiCoO2 cathode was able to sustain a specific capacity of 125 mA h g−1 over 30 charge/discharge cycles in its relaxed state, while the performance of the battery in its mechanically deformed state was not mentioned.81 The use of gel electrolyte is more common in the advanced designs of flexible batteries (e.g. planar and cable designs), and a comprehensive discussion is deferred to the later sections.64,69,71,82
The same method for introducing a gelling agent has also been employed to obtain gel electrolyte for supercapacitors. The typical polymer gelling agents include PEO, PVA, PMMA and PAA, while the electrolytic agents can be H2SO4, H3PO4, KOH, LiCl, etc.21,83–85 H3PO4/PVA gel electrolyte is the most commonly used gel electrolyte for carbon-based supercapacitors due to the small ionic radius of H+ and its ability to provide more free ions at low molar concentration.85–87 Organic gel electrolytes were also explored to broaden the voltage window of supercapacitors, which increases the energy density subsequently. With non-aqueous solvents (e.g. propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate), the organic gel electrolyte usually contains high molecular weight polymers and conducting salts (e.g. LiClO4, LiPF6), which provide mechanical robustness and high ionic conductivity to enhance the device performance, respectively.21,88,89
Membrane electrolytes. 
Another approach to a flexible electrolyte is to fabricate a membrane that is able to “fix” the liquid electrolyte. For Zn–air batteries, the membranes need to exhibit large water uptake, high flexibility and stretchability, providing good ionic conductivity for proper cell operation. Meanwhile, the membrane is anticipated to possess high chemical resistance and good compatibility with the liquid electrolyte. Chen et al.90–92 developed KOH/cellulose-based membrane electrolytes with good ionic conductivity by grafting the quaternary ammonia onto cellulose fibers using dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride. The cellulose membrane was prepared by vacuum filtration, with its mechanical stability being enhanced via a self-crosslinking reaction at 60 °C. Upon immersion in KOH electrolyte, the membrane showed excellent water uptake (95.6%) and the resultant hydroxide membrane gave an ionic conductivity as high as 21.2 mS cm−1. In terms of the durability of membrane electrolyte, a flexible Zn–air battery built with such membrane electrolyte and Co3O4 catalyst coated on carbon cloth was only able to survive 34 stable cycles in its relaxed state.90 However, when a similar membrane electrolyte was coupled with an air-cathode of a Co3O4-N doped CNT catalyst grown directly on a stainless steel mesh, the Zn–air battery was able to deliver a stable discharge/charge voltage profile up to 1800 cycles in its flat state. This suggests that the limit of 34 cycles in the former work was unlikely due to the membrane electrolyte itself but other factors. The mechanical robustness of the battery in this case, however, was only demonstrated by measuring its polarization curve at a bending angle of 120°.92
Free-standing solid electrolytes. 
The use of solid electrolyte can enhance the safety of wearable batteries. A half-cell flexible Li-ion battery with LiPON (Li phosphorus oxynitride) solid electrolyte was reported by Lee et al.39 With a LiCoO2 cathode the battery was able to deliver an areal capacity of 106 μA h cm−2 and a stable cycling performance over 100 charge/discharge cycles. The areal capacity was found to decrease to 90 μA h cm−2 after 100 cycles at a bending angle of 60°.39 In another study, Al2O3 nanoparticles and ethoxylated trimethylolpropanetriacrylate (ETPTA) were added into LiPF6-based electrolyte to provide an optimum rheological property and mechanical framework, as required by free-standing and shape-conformable electrolyte printed on patterned substrates.93 Such electrolyte was used to fabricate a flexible Li-ion battery via stencil printing and UV curing methods.68 Briefly, a Li4Ti5O12 anode ink was stencil-printed and UV cured on an Al current collector, and the electrolyte slurry of ETPTA/LiPF6/EC/PC/Al2O3 was subsequently printed and cured on top of the anode. The printing of the LiFePO4 cathode on the top of the cured electrolyte layer was the final step in completing the flexible battery fabrication. This printed battery gave a specific capacity of 160 mA h g−1 and a discharge voltage of 1.8 V, which remained almost the same when it was twisted along a rod with a bending angle of ≈90°.68 The mechanical robustness of the battery could be further improved by incorporating nonwoven PET as a stress compliant support to ETPTA–LiTFSI based electrolyte. The Li-ion battery using such electrolyte coupled with Li4Ti5O12 and LiCoO2 electrodes was able to function well under a severely crumpled condition, giving a specific capacity of 120 mA h g−1 and stable charge/discharge voltage profiles for up to 30 cycles.65
In summary, a layered design is comparably simpler, making it particularly suitable for testing the performance of newly developed active materials or electrolytes. Generally, flexible batteries with layered design show higher capacity compared to batteries with other designs in the flat state. In contrast to the extensive research witnessed in the development of flexible electrodes, notably fewer efforts are seen on flexible and solid-state electrolytes. This has led to the general use of liquid electrolyte, which however, restricts the freedom of design and hence compromises the flexibility of the batteries. Most flexible batteries with layered design are limited to a bending with fairly low bending angles, while a workable battery under some more extreme physical deformations (e.g. stretching) is yet to be reported (Tables 1 and 2). Likely due to this constraint, the wearability of the batteries with layered design has rarely been demonstrated. Besides, the lack of safe encapsulation and their thick and sometimes bulky shape further hinder their integration into wearable devices.

3.2. Planar design
In a planar design, the anode and cathode are placed side by side and the electrolyte is positioned on top of both electrodes. This design has low risk of short circuit during mechanical deformations. However, it tends to give high resistance for the extended ionic diffusion path and small areal capacity/capacitance due to the low density of active materials per unit area (Tables 1 and 2). The mechanical robustness of the batteries with planar design was realized by embedding the electrodes in a flexible encapsulation.82,94–96 A stretchable Ag–Zn planar battery was fabricated by embedding two strips of patterned Ag nanowire electrodes side by side in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix.94 The Zn anode was obtained by electroplating of Zn at one of the Ag strips. The stretchable battery showed a discharge voltage of 1.5 V and areal capacities of 0.11 and 0.09 mA h cm−2 at 0 and 80% strain. However, it suffered severe performance degradation over tens of cycles due to the poor stability of the electrodeposited Zn.94 PDMS can also be incorporated to form a tattoo Ag–Zn battery, enabling conformable attachment on human skin.82 In this printed battery, both Ag and Zn electrodes were electrodeposited on the patterned carbon current collectors that were pre-printed on a tattoo paper (Fig. 3a). The tattoo batteries had a discharge voltage of 1.5 V and a high areal capacity of 1.3 mA h cm−2. Upon being transferred onto human skin, two units of epidermal batteries were able to light up a red LED lamp, which required an operating voltage of 1.8 V (Fig. 3b). Nevertheless, it also showed severe capacity degradation (≈60%) after 13 charge/discharge cycles even in its relaxed state.82 The stability and reversibility of the Zn anode can be improved by introducing additives into the electrolyte and/or using a 3D architecture Zn electrode.97–99

Besides PDMS encapsulation, acrylic elastomer was also utilized as a matrix in alkaline Mn–Zn and Zn–air planar batteries.95,96 In a Zn–air battery with freestanding PAA–KOH electrolyte, the air cathode was prepared by growing the MnOx catalyst onto graphene-coated carbon cloth. Graphene coating on the carbon cloth increased the surface area and conductivity of the air cathode. In addition, more active catalyst per unit area could be loaded on the large surface area of the carbon network, which led to a much higher discharge voltage (1.3 V) compared to that of the battery with MnOx grown on the carbon cloth only (1.0 V). The battery displayed stable cycling performance over 115 cycles in its folded state. Furthermore, no obvious changes were observed in its charge/discharge curves and cycling behaviors after 100 cycles of repetitive folding at 180°.96

3.2.1. Metal- and carbon-based interdigitated electrodes. 
Instead of using two planar electrodes in one device, interdigitated/finger/fork electrodes have more than one pair of an anode and a cathode in a battery with planar design. This design enables more efficient ionic diffusion throughout the electrode compared to the conventional planar design, as one anode is surrounded by two cathodes and vice versa. Choi et al.76 fabricated a 0.5 mm thick Li-ion battery with planar and interdigitated electrode designs (width of the electrode: 2 mm; 400 μm apart). The electrodes were obtained by cutting the metal foil current collectors using knife molds to introduce a curved structure on each of their fingers. The aluminum pouch cell followed the curved shape of the finger electrode and served as a physical barrier between the two curved electrodes (Fig. 4a). This design prevented the internal short circuit and uncontrollable Li dendrite growth between the two adjacent electrodes during the mechanical deformations (Fig. 4). A discharge voltage of 7.4 V was obtained when two batteries with LiPF6/PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte were connected in series. The battery had a stable areal capacity of 0.42 mA h cm−2 for 30 cycles in its relaxed state and was able to maintain similar cycling stability at a bending angle of 120°. Its wearability was demonstrated by integrating the battery onto a medical patch.76 To highlight, the interdigitated electrode is more suitable for micro energy storage devices (Table 3), as the micro-sized finger electrodes with high aspect ratios and small inter-electrode gaps can be readily fabricated using some existing technologies (e.g. photolithography and sputtering).106,107 The micro-interdigitated electrode can be prepared from carbon- and/or metallic-based materials on polymeric or textile substrates.

Carbon-based micro-interdigitated electrodes. 
In carbon-based micro-interdigitated electrodes (e.g. in a micro-supercapacitor), the carbon serves as both a current collector and an active material. Several methods have been explored to fabricate carbon-based micro-interdigitated electrodes, such as laser-assisted dry transfer, inkjet printing and dry etching methods. Although the process was simplified, this approach resulted in devices with relatively high resistance and low capacitance.108–110 Improvement was observed when CNT-based interdigitated electrodes were prepared by patterning CNTs on a polycarbonate substrate using a laser-assisted dry transfer method.108 Besides, prior to coating the electrolyte, a Ni layer was sputtered to improve the in-plane conductivity of the aligned CNT electrodes. The micro-supercapacitor was able to retain 50% of its capacitance (0.43 mF cm−2) after 200 cycles of bending at 170°.108
A transparent and flexible micro-supercapacitor based on a graphene interdigitated electrode was fabricated using inkjet printing and dry etching methods.110 O2 plasma was employed to etch the graphene film that was inkjet-printed on a flexible glass to form the interdigitated electrodes (Fig. 5). The transmittance of the device decreased with increasing number of printed layers of graphene flakes. The device with seven printed layers of graphene flakes had a low capacitance (8.7 μF cm−2) but high transmittance (87%).110 Besides patterning the carbon film on flexible substrates, the interdigitated micro-electrode can also be obtained by positioning two or more carbon micro-fiber electrodes side by side on a substrate.111,112 For example, CNT and N-doped RGO composite fibers (diameter ≈50 μm; mass ratio 1:1) were first obtained from a hydrothermal process using fused silica capillary columns.112 The method was highly scalable and able to produce continuous fibers at a production rate of 1 mA h−1. A planar micro-supercapacitor was then fabricated by placing CNT:N-RGO fibers side by side on a flexible substrate. The flexibility of the device was demonstrated as an ability to retain 97% of its capacitance (116.3 mF cm−2; 40 F cm−3) after continuous cycling 1000 times in its bent state with a bending angle of 90°.112

Metal-based micro-interdigitated electrodes. 
A metallic interdigitated electrode is of interest due to its high conductivity and ease of deposition.106,107,113 Photolithography, evaporation and electroless deposition techniques were often used to pattern interdigitated metal electrodes on wearable substrates. The active materials (i.e. carbon-based and/or pseudocapacitive materials) were then deposited using various methods on conducting metallic substrates. For example, a photolithography-patterned interdigitated Au electrode on a PET substrate was used as the current collector in a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) based micro-supercapacitor.106 RGO layers were obtained via electrophoretic deposition of graphene oxide (GO) on the Au electrodes. The micro-supercapacitor was able to fully retain its capacitance (0.46 mF cm−2) at a bending angle of 60°.106 To improve the charge storage capability of micro-supercapacitors, some pseudocapacitive materials, such as polyaniline and manganese oxide, were co-electrodeposited on the interdigitated Au electrodes.107 It was found that an increased aspect ratio of the interdigitated electrodes and reduced width of the gaps between the adjacent electrodes were able to improve the performance of the micro-supercapacitors. Despite the high areal capacitance (94.73 mF cm−2), the flexibility of the device was notably compromised. A 15% degradation of the capacitance was observed when it was bent to 150°.107
Improved mechanical properties were achieved by employing serpentine interconnects among the micro-supercapacitors which were embedded in a PDMS film.113 Such a micro-supercapacitor array was fabricated by spray-coating CNTs onto an e-beam evaporated Au–Ti current collector, delivering a capacitance of 55.3 F g−1, which was retainable at stretching with up to 30% of strain.113 The stretchability and packing density of the micro-supercapacitor array were further improved by the use of a stiff PDMS substrate for the device and liquid Galinstan (68.5% Ga, 21.5% In, and 10% Sn) for the interconnect (Fig. 6a).114 In this case, the interconnects were embedded in a soft Ecoflex–PDMS film between the neighboring PDMS islands, and hence minimized the impact of stretching on the devices by placing most of the strains on the interconnects (Fig. 6b). Upon casting the electrolyte on Mn3O4/CNT/Au–Ti interdigitated electrodes, the device was transferred to a stiff PDMS island that had been positioned on the soft Ecoflex–PDMS film. A high-density micro-supercapacitor array was achieved by attaching the devices on both sides of the soft film, allowing more devices to be placed within the same footprint. An array of 16 micro-supercapacitors delivered an areal capacitance of 0.57 mF cm−2, which was fully retained after 3000 cycles of stretching at 40% strain (Fig. 6d).114

Interdigitated electrodes on a fabric substrate. 
A breathable substrate, such as fabric, is attractive for wearable applications. A micro-supercapacitor based on a Ni interdigitated electrode on a fabric substrate was reported by Wang et al.115 A Kapton layer was first patterned on common fabrics made of polyester and nylon using a laser scribing method. The exposed fabrics were then subjected to electroless deposition of Ni and hydrothermal reaction in a dispersion of GO to form an interdigitated Ni current collector with RGO as the active material. The micro-supercapacitor delivered a large areal capacitance (8.19 mF cm−2) attributed to the high loading of RGO on the fibrous Ni/textile current collector. The use of the textile substrate allowed the device to be twisted and folded up to 180°.115
In summary, a planar design is a practical choice when the batteries have to be flexible and thin at the same time. The low capacity of a battery with planar design can be addressed using high-capacity materials or loading more active materials onto porous electrodes. The electrodes were often fabricated using a conventional method, i.e. coating the active materials from their inks onto the metallic current collectors, which may limit the mechanical properties of the batteries and hence their related applications. For instance, although the wearability of batteries with planar design has been successfully demonstrated, the batteries were only able to support limited movements of the human's body. In addition, achieving wearability of a micro-supercapacitor/battery with interdigitated electrodes remains a challenge, as the current focus is towards improving their electrochemical and mechanical performances (Table 3).

3.3. Cable design
Electrochemical energy storage devices in the form of cables (or wires, fibers) are gaining more interest due to their high omnidirectional flexibility. Unlike batteries/supercapacitors with layered and planar designs, the cable design can be installed into various shapes of devices or woven onto textiles. It typically consists of several tube-like components or fiber electrodes that are positioned in a certain configuration inside an elastic tube encapsulation. The cable design was first introduced in 2012 by Kwon et al.,77 followed by various modifications to improve its electrochemical and mechanical performances as well as to further reduce its dimensions.69,71,72,74,78,79,100–103,116–126
Based on the relative position of the two electrodes, the designs for cable batteries/supercapacitors can be classified into three basic types, i.e. parallel, core–shell and intertwined designs (Fig. 7a–c). Each design can be further modified with an elastic substrate to enhance the stretchability of the devices. Specifically, the two electrodes in the core–shell design are wrapped around an elastic substrate (Fig. 7e); while in the parallel or intertwined design, they mostly are coiled along an elastic substrate (Fig. 7d and f). Another option for parallel and intertwined designs is to prepare each electrode on an elastic substrate and subsequently have them positioned in a parallel or an intertwined form (Fig. 7g and h). Most of the cable batteries have a core–shell electrode design, while the intertwined electrode is more common in cable supercapacitors (Table 4). This is because that strong attachment of active materials on the current collectors (e.g. carbon fibers) is needed in the intertwining process of the electrodes. Unlike batteries which often require physical coating of active materials on the fibers, a supercapacitor can be fabricated from two carbon fiber electrodes without the need for other active materials. Here, the discussion of energy storage devices with cable design focuses on the correlation between the materials, fabrication methods, wearability and electrochemical performances under mechanical deformations.

3.3.1. Parallel electrodes. 
The two electrodes are positioned side by side in a cable energy storage device with parallel electrode design. The carbon or CNT fiber electrodes can be coated with active materials (metal oxides or carbon-based materials) prior to the assembly. Being the least reported configuration among the cable batteries/supercapacitors (Table 4), it has similar design to planar batteries/supercapacitors, except that no flexible substrate is required to attach both electrodes. Instead, a spacer wire is often utilized to maintain a fixed separation distance between the two electrodes, especially when the electrolyte is in the semi-gel or aqueous form. A supercapacitor with parallel electrode design was fabricated from a commercial pen ink coated on a carbon fiber electrode (Fig. 8a).127 The pen-ink consisted of graphite carbon nanoparticles with a specific surface area of 27.4 m2 g−1. The electrodes and gel electrolyte were packaged in parallel inside a plastic tube and separated by a spacer wire. The supercapacitor was able to retain its capacitance (3–4 mF cm−2) under various bending conditions (up to a bending angle of 180°).127

(Adapted from ref. 72 with copyright permission from John Wiley and Sons.) 
The spacer wire has also been utilized in a Zn–carbon cable battery. The electrodes of carbon fibers coated with Zn or MnO2 were packed inside a tube that was filled with NH4Cl–ZnCl2 electrolyte. The battery was able to retain its capacity (0.29 mA h cm−1) at a bending angle of 150°.100 In addition, the parallel electrodes can become stretchable by introducing a spring-like structure on both electrodes.72 For example, Peng et al.69,71,72,74 fabricated CNT-based fiber electrodes via scrolling the aligned sheets infiltrated by the ink of active materials (e.g. Li4Ti5O12, LiMn2O4 and Si). Gel electrolyte was then applied on the surfaces of the electrodes before twisting them to form spring-like electrodes (Fig. 8b).72 The cable battery showed a capacity of 2.2 mA h m−1 with 85% capacity retention upon stretching at 100% strain.72


3.3.2. Core–shell electrodes. 
In a typical core–shell electrode design, the anode core is wrapped with the cathode shell. Cable batteries with metallic anodes were often fabricated using this design in order to optimize the contact area between the electrolyte and the two electrodes.77,101–103,126 The anode (e.g. Ni–Sn, Zn and Al) was often prepared in the spring form to improve the permeability of the electrolyte. Kwon et al.77 fabricated a cable battery composed of (from the inner to the outer circle) an electroplated Ni–Sn/Cu wire anode, a LiPF6/separator, a LiCoO2/Al cathode and a packing tube. The spring structure was obtained by winding the Ni–Sn/Cu wires on a rod. Such an anode showed an enhanced performance compared to the non-spring structure due to the improved electrolyte permeability. The cable battery with a diameter of 2.5 mm delivered a stable performance in its flat state and under various bending conditions (up to a bending angle of 180°) with a capacity of 1 mA h cm−1.77
The spring metallic anode was also adopted in Zn–air batteries by twisting a Zn wire on a rod.101–103 The batteries were sealed in a holed packing tube to allow O2 from the atmosphere to enter the battery. The Zn spring anode was paired with a commercial air cathode loaded with Fe–N–C catalyst in a primary Zn–air battery. A relatively big battery (diameter: 9 mm) had a discharge voltage of 0.92 V under bending at 120°.103 In addition to being flexible, the spring electrode is also stretchable. A Zn–air cable battery (diameter: 3 mm) with a RuO2/CNT sheet air cathode was stretchable for up to 10% strain with a retained discharge voltage (1.0 V).101 The same design was also applied to fabricate a primary Al–air cable battery, except that the anode was made of Al spring and the CNT sheets were coated with Ag. In this case the primary battery was woven onto a textile and its discharge voltage showed a drop from 1.4 to 1.1 V upon stretching at 30% strain.117
Peng et al.78,79 also used a similar approach to fabricate cable type Li–sulfur and Li–air batteries, except that the Li wire was not in the spring form. In the Li–sulfur battery, the aligned CNT fiber was modified with sulfur as an active cathode material, mesoporous carbon as the sulfur host and GO as the wrapping layer to prevent the seeping out of polysulfide. The cable battery was assembled to demonstrate the weavability of the battery onto a fabric. The flexibility of the battery was demonstrated by showing a stable open circuit potential of the battery (3.2 V) for various bending angles (up to 180°).78 The aligned CNT fiber was also employed as an air cathode in the Li–air battery (diameter: 6 mm, Fig. 9). The cable battery with a Li metal anode and gel electrolyte had a capacity of 2.5 mA h cm−1 and good stability over 100 cycles of charge–discharge test. The battery can be woven onto a textile with a similar discharge voltage (2.45 V) at a bending angle of 145°.79

Carbon-based supercapacitors were also fabricated using a core–shell electrode approach.128,129 Core electrodes can be prepared from a modified carbon fiber, while carbon films including CNT sheets can be used as the shell electrodes. For example, a core electrode was prepared from a bundle of carbon fibers coated with CNTs.128 After applying the gel electrolyte, a carbon film was wrapped around the carbon fiber core to form a core–shell supercapacitor. The supercapacitor was able to retain its capacitance (86.8 mF cm−2) during bending at 180°.128 Apart from coating CNTs on the carbon fibers, CNT fibers can be used directly as the core electrode. For instance, the shell was prepared by wrapping CNT sheets on a CNT fiber that had been pre-coated with electrolyte. Despite the simplified fabrication method, the supercapacitor exhibited a low areal capacitance of 8.66 mF cm−2. However, the good mechanical properties of the aligned and wavy structured CNT fibers endowed the supercapacitor with good cycling stability in its folded state (180°) and stretchability up to 20% strain.129


3.3.3. Intertwined electrodes. 
Due to the versatility of carbon as active material for electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), most of the carbon fiber based supercapacitors have a twisted/intertwined electrode design (Table 4). In order to increase their double layer capacitance, various methods have been explored to increase the surface area of carbon fibers.124,125,130 For instance, a porous carbon shell was introduced directly onto the surfaces of the carbon fibers via acid oxidation. With a diameter of 2 mm the supercapacitor delivered a specific capacitance of 20.4 F g−1 (0.41 F cm−1), and was able to retain 96% of its capacitance after 3000 cycles.130 The flexibility of the devices allowed it to be curled up into a ring or a spring without significant change to its electrochemical performances. In addition, a porous shell can also be introduced by electrodeposition of GO from its suspension onto a graphene fiber electrode in a three-electrode set-up. Two of the modified graphene fibers were coated with gel electrolyte and intertwined to form a supercapacitor with a capacitance of 40 F g−1 (20 μF cm−1), which was stable for up to a bending angle of 120°.124 The supercapacitor can also be made spring-like by coiling the device with unsolidified gel electrolyte on a rod, delivering a similar capacitance (18 μF cm−1) in its compressed and relaxed states.124 An alternative approach to the formation of a shell of a similar type of carbon is to coat ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with high surface area (1014 m2 g−1) onto CNT fibers.125 The supercapacitor based on twisted OMC-CNT fibers (87 wt% OMC, diameter: 150 μm) showed an improved specific capacitance of 1.9 mF cm−1 (39.7 mF cm−2), and was able to retain its capacitance after 1000 cycles of repeated bending at 90°.125
The capacitance can be further improved by introducing pseudocapacitive materials onto both electrodes. Electrodeposition of a small amount of MnO2 (27.6 μg cm−2) onto porous CNT fibers (diameter: 17 μm) was found to enhance the capacitance without increasing the resistance of the intertwined electrodes.118 The high volumetric capacitance (25.4 F cm−3) of the device was attributed to the pseudocapacitive MnO2 and a small volume of the battery (diameter: 30 μm). In addition, the supercapacitor was woven onto a textile and exhibited a stable performance over 1000 cycles of test in its bent state with a bending angle of 90°.118
Conducting polymers, e.g. polyaniline (PANI) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), possess higher conductivity and superior mechanical flexibility compared to metal oxides. This allows the incorporation of a high amount of such polymers into CNT fibers without compromising their conductivity and mechanical flexibility. Incorporation of conducting polymers onto the carbon fiber can be done via electrodeposition, in situ polymerization or wet spinning methods. For example, PANI–CNT fibers (diameter: 20 μm) were prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline onto CNT fibers.121 After coating with gel electrolyte, two fibers were twisted onto each other to form a supercapacitor (diameter: 100 μm). The device was woven into a textile with well retained capacitance (38 mF cm−2) after 150 cycles of bending at 180°.121 PANI can also be coated onto a CNT fiber via electrodeposition to form a thinner composite fiber (≈15 μm).119 The micro-supercapacitor with the intertwined fiber electrodes delivered a capacitance of 274 F g−1 and was able to retain 97% of its capacitance after 50 cycles of bending at 150°.119 An alternative approach to prepare PANI–CNT composite fibers is a one-step process of wet-spinning using a dispersion of CNT and PANI nanowires.123 After coating of electrolyte, the fibers (diameter: 50 μm) were intertwined to form a weaveable supercapacitor on a textile, giving a fairly low but retainable areal capacitance (6.2 mF cm−2) during bending for up to 180°.123
A cable supercapacitor with a small diameter and robust mechanical properties was obtained by intertwining two PANI–CNT–Pt fibers.120 A CNT fiber was first prepared by twisting the CNT web around a Pt wire (diameter: 25 μm) on a fly spinner (Fig. 10a and b). This scalable process produced fibers with a length of up to 50 cm. A PANI nanowire dispersion was then coated onto a CNT–Pt fiber to form a PANI–CNT–Pt fiber electrode (diameter: 30 μm). The obtained supercapacitor delivered an areal capacitance of 52.5 mF cm−2 (0.24 mF cm−1) and was able to sustain 1000 cycles of folding without any severe degradation. Interestingly, it can be knitted on a knitting machine to form a tube-like textile due to its comparable thickness (≈70 μm) to the conventional textile (Fig. 10c).120 Gradient biscrolling was the method to produce a 20 μm diameter fiber consisting of PEDOT and CNTs.122 The composite fiber (up to 75 wt% PEDOT) was plied with 25 μm diameter Pt wire and then coated with gel electrolyte. The electrodes were twisted to form a supercapacitor and then woven onto a textile, exhibiting a volumetric capacitance of 145 F cm−3 (0.46 mF cm−1; 73 mF cm−2) with 2% of capacitance degradation after 2000 cycles of test at a bending angle of 90°.122

3.3.4. Cable design with an elastic substrate. 
Parallel electrodes on an elastic substrate. 
The flexibility of a cable battery/supercapacitor can be further enhanced by placing the electrodes on an elastic substrate. CNT fibers coated with Li-containing metal oxides or conducting polymers have been considered as the preferred materials for this design approach. Peng et al.69,71 fabricated stretchable cable batteries by winding LiMn2O4/CNT and Li4Ti5O12/CNT fiber electrodes in parallel onto an elastic substrate (Fig. 11a).69,71 Despite its low capacity and discharge voltage (82–91 mA h g−1 and 2.2 V), the battery was able to retain 88% of its capacity during stretching at 600% strain (Fig. 11c and d). Furthermore, cycling at 100% strain showed 80% capacity retention after 200 cycles (Fig. 11e). The high stretchability was attributed to the small change in the resistance of the electrode (3.86%) upon stretching at 600% strain. The wearability of the battery (diameter: 2 mm) was demonstrated by weaving the cable batteries onto a sweater or bracelet (Fig. 11b).69,71

Core–shell electrodes on an elastic substrate. 
An improved capacity can be achieved from a core–shell design thanks to the optimum ionic diffusion path, as demonstrated using a LiMn2O4/CNT fiber wrapped along an elastic substrate.74 After coating with electrolyte, a Si/CNT fiber was then wound to form an anode shell. The battery delivered a capacity of 100 mA h g−1 (0.22 mA h cm−1) at a discharge voltage of 3.4 V. The mechanical flexibility of the battery was demonstrated by weaving the battery onto a textile.74 An improved stretchability of the core–shell electrode was observed for a supercapacitor assembled by a similar fabrication method. In this case, the CNT sheet was wrapped around an elastic support that was pre-coated with gel electrolyte.131,132 The fiber was subsequently coated with a second layer of electrolyte, a second layer of the CNT sheet and a third layer of electrolyte, forming a supercapacitor with a diameter of 900 μm. Despite its low gravimetric capacitance (18 F g−1), the device was able to retain >95% of its capacitance upon 100 cycles of stretching at 75% strain.131 The same group also introduced shape-memory polyurethane as the elastic substrate to fabricate elastic core–shell supercapacitors. Such a device was deformable at temperature above the thermal transition temperature (Ttran) of the polyurethane. The deformed shape can be retained upon cooling, while it will return to the original shape upon re-heating to a temperature above Ttran. Similarly, the capacitance of the device was relatively low (24 F g−1) with 80% capacitance retention at 100% strain.132 In order to improve the capacitance of the device, PANI was electrodeposited on the CNT sheets that were wrapped around a pre-stretched elastic fiber.133 The core electrode was subsequently coated with gel electrolyte, the CNT–PANI sheet and another layer of electrolyte. The large diameter (1.2 mm) composite fiber supercapacitor showed an improved gravimetric capacitance (111 F g−1), which was fully retained during stretching at 400% strain. Its wearability was demonstrated by weaving the device to form a stretchable textile. The stretchable supercapacitor textile preserved 98.5% of its capacitance during stretching at 200% strain.133
Intertwined electrodes on an elastic substrate. 
The intertwined electrode showed a good compromise between stretchability and volumetric capacitance. The stretchable supercapacitor with a small diameter (300 μm) was fabricated using an intertwined electrode design. Chou et al.134 wrapped two intertwined CNT fibers on pre-stretched spandex that had been coated with PDMS. Prior to the assembly, the gel electrolyte was applied on the CNT fibers as well as on the PDMS substrate. The device maintained its capacitance (13.3 F cm−3; 4.99 mF cm−2) after 20 cycles of stretching at 100% strain.134 An improved stretchability was obtained by intertwining two stretchable electrodes, fabricated by coating PEDOT–PSS on CNT sheets wrapped along the pre-stretched elastic substrate.135 After coating with gel electrolyte, the electrodes were twisted onto each other to form a stretchable supercapacitor with a diameter of 800 μm, which was able to retain its capacitance (30.7 F g−1) during stretching at 350% strain.135
In summary, batteries with cable design show improved flexibility compared to their counterparts with layered and planar designs. Nevertheless, to date, the capacities of cable batteries have usually been ≤100 mA h g−1 (Table 1). In principle, the capacity can be increased by loading more active materials onto the 1D current collector. However, at high loading, peeling-off of the active materials from the current collector often takes place during physical deformations, which leads to fast deterioration of the device performance. A solution to this, i.e. to introduce sufficient loading of high-capacity materials without compromising the mechanical stability of the fiber electrode, remains unavailable for cable batteries. In addition, theoretically the 1D structured cable batteries shall be readily integrated into any apparels, e.g. woven onto a textile with retained wearability. However, the reported cable batteries generally possess diameters between 2 and 9 mm, making them unsuitable for standard knitting/weaving machines.
Cable micro-supercapacitors are normally prepared from micro-sized carbon fibers. Despite their high volumetric capacitance due to their small volume, they generally lack mechanical stability needed for applications in small-scale wearable devices. Carbon-based cable supercapacitors can be fabricated using parallel, core–shell, or intertwined electrode designs (Table 4). The capacitance may be normalized against the mass, length, area, or volume of the device, lacking a standard mode for reporting the capacitance of a cable supercapacitor. More confusion is seen in the reported specific mass capacitance, where it was often unclear whether the mass was based on the whole device or the electrodes only. Most of the cable supercapacitors do not require encapsulation, making it easier to investigate their flexibility and wearability. Moreover, cable supercapacitors with a thickness comparable to those of the fibers of conventional textiles have been demonstrated, paving the way for their immediate applications in wearable devices.

3.4. Other designs
In addition to the three basic designs, more sophisticated designs such as textile, transparent and integrated designs are of particular interest for smart wearable technology. Most of the textile or transparent batteries/supercapacitors adopt a basic layered design, except for the specific requirement for their electrodes (i.e. textile or transparent electrodes).

3.4.1. Textile design. 
Commercial fabrics based on cotton, polyester, wool and silk have been utilized as substrates in wearable supercapacitors/batteries.66,67,137–143 Ideally, textiles are required to be electrochemically active in order to maximize the charge storage capability of textile batteries/supercapacitors. However, the insulating and electrochemically inactive nature of pristine textiles makes them only suitable as substrates in these batteries/supercapacitors. Here, the discussion focuses on the methods to modify commercially available textiles and the electrochemical performance of fully-assembled textile batteries/supercapacitors under mechanical deformations.
Carbon-based coated textiles. 
Due to the large electrical double layer capacitance and good conductivity of carbonaceous materials, carbon coating of fabric substrates is commonly used in textile supercapacitors.137–142 Gogotsi et al.137 screen-printed activated carbon on fabrics of polyester and cotton, respectively, and found a higher resistance from the former due to the denser structure of the polyester fibers. By coating carbons on the carbon fibers that were previously knitted on the wool fabric, the same group assembled a solid-state supercapacitor by sandwiching a solid electrolyte in two overlapped fabric electrodes. The device was able to deliver a capacitance of 88 F g−1 with 80% capacitance retention during folding at 180°.138
Carbon nanoparticles from commercial calligraphic ink were coated onto a hybrid silver/cotton fabric producing washable textile electrodes for conventional washing machines.139 The electrical and mechanical properties of the electrodes remained unchanged after 10 cycles of washing, while no information was available on the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor under mechanical deformations.139 In addition, the capacitance of textile supercapacitors can be improved by depositing materials with pseudocapacitance onto carbon coated textile electrodes.140–142 For instance, polyaniline was electrodeposited onto graphene coated polyester to produce a flexible supercapacitor, which showed 95% of capacitance retention (251 F g−1) after 500 cycles of bending at 120°.141 A large-area textile electrode (up to 100 cm2) prepared using a similar method enabled a supercapacitor with a high areal capacitance of 700 mF cm−2. The excellent flexibility allows weaving 3 units of such supercapacitors onto a T-shirt to light up 44 red LED lamps under physical deformations.142
Metal-based coated textiles. 
Conductivity can be a bottleneck for the charge storage capability of oxide-based materials. Hence, low-resistance metallic coating is often applied to boost the conductivity of oxide-based textile electrodes. Kim et al.66 coated Ni on polyester via electroless deposition, which produced a fabric with a retained conductivity of up to 40% strain. A pouch cell with LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 coated on a Ni/polyester substrate gave a discharge voltage of 1.8 V with 80% retention of its capacity (25 mA h) after 1000 cycles of repetitive folding. Its scalability was demonstrated in a module battery consisting of 4 single cells, delivering a discharge voltage of 7.2 V.66 A similar battery was used to store the energy generated by wearable triboelectric nanogenerator cloth (TENG cloth).67 The nanogenerator converted the mechanical energy extracted from the human motions into electrical energy, which was subsequently stored in the Li-ion battery (Fig. 12). After being fully charged with a nanogenerator (Fig. 12d), the wearable battery was shown to power a heartbeat meter connected to a smartphone (Fig. 12a).67 The self-powered and self-charging wearable heartbeat meter is highly desirable for wearable technologies.

Most of the textile supercapacitors were fabricated using two overlapped textile electrodes which added extra thickness and weight to the device.66,67,137,138,141,142 If an integrated design is adopted, more advantages can be harvested. For instance, a printed supercapacitor on a single silk fabric substrate was fabricated by sequentially screen-printing a layer of silver, carbon and MnO2 onto a silk fabric and PDMS substrate.143 After applying the gel electrolyte, a PDMS-based electrode was transferred onto the top of the fabric electrode. The PDMS substrate was then removed from the device upon successful transfer of the electrode, yielding a supercapacitor with a capacitance of 19.2 mF cm−2 that was stable under various bending conditions (up to 120°). Using this approach supercapacitors can be fabricated into any desirable shape on textiles (e.g. a butterfly), which is of interest for smart clothing applications.143
In summary, highly conductive and electrochemically active textiles are essential to achieve high charge storage capability in textile supercapacitors/batteries. In addition, good adhesion of the active materials to the textile is crucial, as it prevents any undesirable de-attachment during the physical deformations. This is by no means trivial. More and dedicated efforts are required to develop new approaches to enable smart modification on commercial textiles, which furnishes the desired conductivity and electrochemical activity without compromising their breathability and flexibility.


3.4.2. Transparent design. 
The transparency of devices is gaining more popularity in the wearable market, which requires the energy storage to be unobtrusive. In conventional energy storage devices, all components except electrolyte (i.e. active materials and current collectors) are non-transparent. In order to achieve the transparency, the electrode is fabricated by applying a very thin layer of active material onto a transparent current collector, which, however, leads to low capacity/capacitance of the device. To date, current collectors of transparent batteries/supercapacitors have been prepared from thin layers of carbon-based (e.g. CNT, graphene) or metallic (e.g. Au, Ag) materials (Table 5). In the case of supercapacitors, pseudocapacitive materials can be deposited onto patterned current collectors to enhance the capacitance of the device.73,86,144–152 More research is needed to develop solutions that are able to manage the trade-off between transparency and energy storing capability, and to improve the mechanical flexibility without compromising the electrochemical performance of the devices.
Carbon-based transparent electrodes. 
High-transmittance and stretchable supercapacitors can be fabricated from carbon-based transparent electrodes. Such devices, however, often have low capacitance due to the very limited double layer capacitance of the thin carbon deposits.86,145,147 For instance, a stretchable CNT-based supercapacitor with high transmittance (75%) was realized by embedding aligned CNT sheets in a pre-stretched PDMS substrate.147 The device retained its relatively low capacitance (7.3 F g−1) after 100 cycles of stretching at 30% strain.147 In another example, a transparent and freestanding graphene film was synthesized via the NaCl-assisted microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method.86,146 A porous graphene film was obtained by etching the NaCl before introducing the carbon source (i.e. CH4) in the plasma. A transparent supercapacitor with porous graphene electrodes showed a slightly lower transmittance (44.6 vs. 46.3%) but an enhanced capacitance (5.48 vs. 3.3 mF cm−2) compared to the non-porous electrode. However, the supercapacitor with a porous graphene electrode was not stretchable. In contrast, its counterpart with a non-porous graphene electrode was able to retain its capacitance after 1200 cycles of stretching at 20% strain.86,146 The low capacitance of transparent carbon-based supercapacitors can be overcome by the use of pseudocapacitive transparent electrodes (transmittance: 84–60%).148 These electrodes were prepared by tuning the amount of electrodeposited polyaniline on the aligned CNT–PET substrate, giving an optimum transmittance of 70% and a stable capacitance of 230 F g−1 under various bending angles (up to 180°).148
Metal-based transparent electrodes. 
Highly conductive metallic current collectors coated/patterned on flexible substrates have also been explored for transparent batteries/supercapacitors.73,149–152 In the case of supercapacitors, pseudocapacitive materials are often deposited onto patterned Au or Ag current collectors to enhance the capacitance and reduce the resistance of the device.150–152 A supercapacitor with a transmittance of 75% was fabricated via electrodeposition of MnO2 onto a Au mesh current collector. Despite its large areal capacitance (3 mF cm−2) the supercapacitor showed fairly low flexibility (up to a bending angle of 130°) due to the rigid nature of a MnO2 film.150 An improved mechanical flexibility was obtained from conducting polymer-based transparent electrodes.151,152 A Ag grid was embedded in patterned polyurethane acrylate (PUA) in order to prevent the delamination of Ag nanoparticles during continuous mechanical deformations.152 With spin-coated PEDOT–PSS as the active material (Fig. 13a), the device exhibited a relatively large areal capacitance (2.79 mF cm−2) and high transmittance (80%). Moreover, it was able to retain 97.4% of its capacitance after 1000 cycles of repetitive bending to 2 mm radius (≈170° bending angle, Fig. 13b).152

In summary, transparent energy storage devices with carbon current collectors show more desirable mechanical properties. They can be stretched if fabricated on a stretchable substrate, while a drawback is their low capacity/capacitance due to the very limited energy storage capability of the thin carbon layer (Table 5). The use of metallic current collectors reduces the resistance, and large capacity/capacitance materials improve the charge storage capability of transparent supercapacitors/batteries. However, this approach limits the mechanical flexibility of the devices (e.g. not stretchable). The wearability of transparent supercapacitors with adequate energy storage capability is yet to be demonstrated.


3.4.3. Integrated design. 
Integration of energy storage devices with other functions or devices may enhance their versatility for smart wearable technology. The added function can have an aesthetic feature, e.g. colour changing or light emitting to enhance the visual impact and aesthetic appearance of the wearable devices. Such functions can be integrated into smart clothing and other wearable devices where visual signals are needed. Besides aesthetic, some electronic features, such as energy conversion, sensing, and logic circuiting, can also be incorporated into energy storage devices.
Electrochromic energy storage devices. 
Due to the changes in the oxidation state of active materials, the optical properties of energy storage devices with incorporated electrochromic features reversibly change upon voltage biasing. This feature allows monitoring the working state of the device (i.e. charging or discharging) from its coloration state. For instance, stretchable electrochromic supercapacitors with planar design have been reported using H3PO4/PVA electrolyte on a non-conducting elastic substrate.153,154 One-half of the substrate was covered with a PANI/CNT positive electrode, while the other half was coated with a PANI/CNT negative electrode. Both electrodes were separated by the uncoated PANI/CNT region on the substrate. Both sides displayed different colors during charging and discharging, showing blue, green and yellow within a potential range of 1 to −1 V. It had a capacitance of 255 F g−1 (0.189 mF cm−1) and 97.9% capacitance retention after 100 cycles of stretching at 100% strain. The supercapacitors can be woven to form a display smart textile.154 Instead of positioning positive and negative electrodes at two different ends of the elastic substrate, both electrodes were placed side by side on two separate Au layers, which were patterned at a fixed winding angle along the elastic substrate (Fig. 14a).155 PEDOT active material was electrodeposited onto a Au layer, followed by coating a layer of LiClO4/PC electrolyte. The supercapacitor with cable design displayed a natural Au color at 0 V and changed its color during biasing at 0.6 and −0.6 V. When the potential was switched to 0.6 V, the anode maintained the same natural Au color, while the PEDOT colour on the cathode changed to dark blue. The device showed the opposite colouring state upon biasing at −0.6 V and maintained the same chromatic transitions during bending. Despite the fast colouration and bleaching time (<5 s), the integrated device had a low capacitance (≈20 F g−1) and 73% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles of bending at 90° (Fig. 14c).155

Solar cell-energy storage devices. 
Self-sustaining energy supply is a desirable feature which can be integrated into energy storage devices. Supercapacitors with cable design have been integrated with dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), which, however, showed limited stability during mechanical deformations.156,157 Another bottleneck was the use of liquid electrolyte in DSSC, which compromised its applicability in wearable devices. Peng et al.158 fabricated flexible energy fibers that combined photoelectric conversion of polymer solar cells and energy storage of supercapacitors. The integrated device was based on TiO2 nanotubes that were grown on Ti wire. The solar cell was fabricated at one end of the wire by successively coating the layers of P3HT-PCBM, PEDOT–PSS and CNTs, with the supercapacitor assembled at the other end of the wire using successive coatings of H3PO4/PVA electrolyte and CNTs. With the heterojunction polymer solar cell, this self-powered supercapacitor exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 1.01% and a capacitance of 0.077 mF cm−1. The flexible energy fiber showed 10% degradation in the power conversion efficiency after 1000 cycles of bending at 45°. As such an energy fiber could be woven onto a textile, it promises good potential in application for wearable technology.158
Self-healing energy storage devices. 
Wearable energy storage devices are often subjected to repeated stress and strain under various types of deformations, which may result in permanent mechanical failure of the materials and the devices. To date, self-healing energy storage devices have often employed self-healing polymers that are able to repair damage by themselves or in response to external stimuli.159–161 For instance, in a self-healing supercapacitor, the mechanical properties are repaired by a self-healing polymer substrate, which is capable of restoring the electrode alignment and the electrical properties, subsequently. Chen et al.159 utilized a self-healing polymer composite as a substrate in a self-healing supercapacitor with a layered design. H2SO4/PVA electrolyte was sandwiched between two CNT film electrodes that were attached to the self-healing substrate. The flexible and self-healing supercapacitor was able to restore 82.3% of its initial capacitance (35 F g−1) after 5 cycles of cutting and healing.159
In summary, flexible electrochemical energy storage devices integrated with smart functions, such as electrochromism, energy conversion, and self-healing, have great potential in various smart wearable technologies. Their development has benefited from the advance of smart functional materials that can be utilized as electrodes, electrolytes and other components in an innovative design of integrated electronic wearable devices. Although a number of smart materials have been developed, only selected materials can be employed in wearable energy storage devices due to the challenges in finding suitable smart materials that can be physically and chemically compatible with energy storage devices. Furthermore, smart materials also need to exhibit sufficient electrochemical energy storage function and stability over a period of use. Hence, reports on electrochemical energy storage devices with integrated design are mostly proof-of-concept studies with limited efforts on the performance optimization. Following the increased interest in smart materials, electrochemical energy storage devices with other smart functions can be expected in the future. They will play an important role in various applications, especially in wearable healthcare and monitoring devices.

4. Summary, challenges and outlook
Most of the electrochemical energy storage devices have met the criteria of being wearable, functionable, and, to some extent, compatible. However, fabrication of durable wearable batteries remains challenging as most of them can only support limited movements of the human body and operate under certain environmental circumstances over a relatively low power density and a limited period of time (Table 6 and Fig. 15). Wearable electrochemical energy storage devices have been discussed with the focus on recent advances in the materials, cell designs, fabrication methods and electrochemical performances during mechanical deformations. Relatively safe and inexpensive Zn-based batteries have shown potential in wearable applications. However, the practical application is hampered by their low discharge voltage and poor rechargeability (Table 2). Current efforts are mostly focused on the development of carbon-based electrocatalysts for flexible and rechargeable Zn–air batteries. Zn-based batteries are particularly promising for low-power wearable devices, such as smart tattoos, sensors and wearable medical devices.
 Fig. 15  Ragone plots of the selected wearable batteries in Table 6. 
Despite the more desirable performance of Li batteries, their wearability is hindered by the use of flammable organic electrolytes and powder-based active materials (Table 1). Li batteries with layered design have addressed some of these challenges by utilizing gel or solid electrolytes as well as embedding powder-form active materials in a flexible current collector. In addition to the layered design, by utilizing a planar design approach, mechanically robust and thin batteries can be fabricated. The wearability of these planar batteries is realized by encapsulating the electrodes in a flexible substrate. Despite their robust structure, the planar batteries suffer from drawbacks, such as high resistance and small capacity. High-capacity materials on carbon- and metal-based interdigitated electrodes are explored to enhance the performance of the planar batteries (Table 3).
Omnidirectional cable batteries are gaining more popularity for wearable applications, especially for smart apparels. They can be classified according to the position of the cathode with respect to the anode in a cell. Core–shell cable batteries generally show high electrochemical performance due to the good contact between the electrode and electrolyte. Various metallic wires, such as Zn, Al, and Li, can be used as the anodes. However, the fabrication of mechanically robust shells that can sustain repeatable physical deformations, particularly stretching, remains challenging. Cable batteries with parallel electrodes have a similar design to the planar battery. Their large size and long ionic diffusion path make them unsuitable for wearable applications. The mechanical properties of the cable batteries can be enhanced by incorporating an elastic substrate. However, such a substrate is electrochemically inactive, adding extra volume and mass to the batteries.
Apart from cable batteries, wearable cable supercapacitors with intertwined electrodes have been extensively studied due to the versatility of carbon as active material for electrical double layer capacitors (Table 4). The twisting process of the electrodes can be automated to realize a rapid, continuous and large-scale fabrication of energy storage devices with a cable design. Such supercapacitors are able to adopt diameters less than 100 μm, which can be used in conventional weaving or knitting machines for smart clothing applications. In order to increase the capacitance, more studies should be directed towards developing sufficiently tough carbon fiber electrodes with larger surface area and better adhesion, such that large amounts and thin layers of pseudocapacitive materials can be deposited on their surfaces.
Despite the niche application in smart clothing, the fabrication of textile energy storage devices remains challenging. Continuous efforts towards modifying commercial textiles (without altering their clothing function) are necessary in order to enhance their conductivity as well as the adhesion of active materials. Unobtrusive wearable devices require energy storage devices to be transparent and flexible, which is achievable by depositing very thin layers of active materials on transparent conducting substrates (Table 5). Future research in this field is to focus on managing the trade-off between the transparency, capacity/capacitance and flexibility of the device.
Integration of energy storage devices and other functions is important for a versatile smart wearable technology. Various functions can be introduced, such as aesthetic (e.g. electrochromism, light emitting), sensing (e.g. UV, temperature), energy harvesting (e.g. piezoelectric, solar conversion), etc. Current research studies in this area are mostly focused on proof-of-concept studies. The high performance and good stability of smart materials, which are electrochemically and physically compatible with energy storage devices, are needed in order to improve the performance of integrated electronic wearable devices. Furthermore, miniaturized energy storage devices are of interest to power small-scale and lightweight wearable devices. The designs are currently limited to interdigitated–planar and fiber structures with inadequate demonstration on their flexibility as well as wearability.
In addition to the electrochemical and mechanical performances, the safety aspect continues to be one of the most important factors for market penetration of wearable electrochemical energy storage devices. To ensure the safe operation of the device, when it is in contact with the human body, employment of solid electrolyte, durable encapsulations and harmless materials is highly desired in the design. The use of solid electrolyte not only eliminates the risk of leakage, but also offers the ease of handling and a large operating temperature range and electrochemical potential window. The challenges are to enhance the conductivity of the electrolytes and to ensure that the electrode/electrolyte interface remains intact during the repeated mechanical deformations. Besides electrolyte, durable encapsulations and harmless materials need to be incorporated into the design to ensure the safe operation of the device when it is in contact with the human body. In addition to the stability under continuous mechanical deformations and resistance to some undesired electrochemical reactions, the stability of the wearable energy storage devices is also affected by the chemical and photochemical reactions which may be caused by the changes in the ambient environment, including increased sunlight intensity, humidity levels and temperature. While the literature has profoundly addressed the electrochemical and mechanical stabilities, the performances of electrochemical devices under various humidity levels and temperatures need to be investigated.
Ideally, wearable devices can be loaded into washing machines with water and surfactants. However, current wearable energy storage devices need to be handled delicately or are sensitive to water and dry cleaning. One possible approach is to provide encapsulations that are chemically and water resistant, such as polyurethane coating. Furthermore, active materials for wearable energy storage often have high cost and/or low yield. The scalability of the materials and fabrication methods is crucial for the industrial-scale production of wearable energy storage devices. Besides the above challenges, future wearable energy storage devices should be breathable and able to repair the damage caused by external or internal factors. The use of shape-memory and self-healing materials should be continuously explored in order to address the unwanted reactions or deformations in the wearable energy storage devices. In addition, aesthetic and physical appearances of wearable energy storage devices are important to further promote their integration into the user's lifestyle. While fashionistas would love to see various displays on their apparels, invisible wearable devices would take military and surveillance activities to another level.
