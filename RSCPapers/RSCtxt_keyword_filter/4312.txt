    , Accepted 26th April 2017First published on 2nd May 2017AbstractBesides providing sufficient solubility, branched alkyl chains also affect the film-forming and packing properties of organic semiconductors. In order to avoid steric hindrance as it is present in wide-spread alkyl chains comprising a branching point position at the C2-position, i.e., 2-ethylhexyl, the branching point can be moved away from the π-conjugated backbone. In this report, we study the influence of the modification of the branching point position from the C2-position in 2-hexyldecylamine (1) to the C4-position in 4-hexyldecylamine (2) connected to the central dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) moiety in a well-studied A–D–A oligothiophene on the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance in solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor material. Post-treatment of the photoactive layers is performed via solvent vapor annealing (SVA) in order to improve the film microstructure of the bulk heterojunction. The time evolution of nanoscale morphological changes is followed by combining scanning transmission electron microscopy with low-energy-loss spectroscopic imaging (STEM-SI), solid-state absorption spectroscopy, and two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD). Our results show an improvement of the photovoltaic performance that is dependent on the branching point position in the donor oligomer. Optical spacers are utilized to increase light absorption inside the co-oligomer 2-based BHJSCs leading to increased power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8.2% when compared to the corresponding co-oligomer 1-based devices. A STEM-SI analysis of the respective device cross-sections of active layers containing 1 and 2 as donor materials indeed reveals significant differences in their respective active layer morphologies.
1. Introduction
In recent years, bulk-heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) consisting of a photoactive layer, in which the donor and acceptor components form interdigitating networks, have proven themselves as promising device structures for high-performance solar cells.1 Lately, huge advances have been accomplished in terms of developing oligomeric donor materials, often referred to as small molecules, with tailored optoelectronic properties as well as alternative device architectures and optimization methods resulting in efficiencies (PCE) above 11% in single-junction devices.2–4 The key to such highly efficient solar cells also lies in the control of the active layer morphology, more precisely, in the spatial distribution and the domain size of donor- and acceptor-rich phases. The blend-layer morphology is in delicate equilibrium, which can be adjusted by the use of additives, thermal annealing, or solvent vapor annealing (SVA). The latter post-treatment method, in which the cast blend layers are exposed to solvent vapor for an exact period of time, was found to be the most effective alternative for highly-soluble A–D–A-type oligothiophenes, as previously reported.5–8
The design of photoactive materials typically focuses on the development of novel π-conjugated backbones or the modification thereof. In contrast, less effort was invested in the development of flexible side chains since they were merely introduced as solubilizing groups to enable purification and to facilitate satisfactory processing conditions. Generally, alkyl side chains are regarded as the insulating parts of the material with negligible influence on the optoelectronic properties of π-conjugated systems. Their significant impact on molecular packing, thin film morphology, and hence device performance is sometimes underestimated and the obtained results for materials with different alkyl side chains were particularly related to different solubilities. Besides providing sufficient solubility, branched alkyl chains attached to the π-conjugated backbone also affect the packing properties of organic semiconductors. Interestingly, the most commonly used branched alkyl chains have their branching point at the C2-position, e.g., 2-ethylhexyl or 2-hexyldecyl, most probably owed to a good availability of the corresponding building blocks and reagents.9 However, a branching point at the C2-position may cause a steric repulsion between the π-system and the alkyl side chain.9
The group of Park investigated the effect of side chain characteristics on the photovoltaic performance for co-oligomers decorated with branched 2-ethylhexyl in comparison with linear octyl side chains at the central benzodithiophene (BDT) moieties.10 Optoelectronic characterization pointed to slightly higher absorption, a smaller band gap, and a more planar structure for the oligomer comprising the branched side chains. This rather unexpected result was also reflected in superior hole mobility and photovoltaic properties compared with the octyl-substituted co-oligomer (2.4% vs. 1.3% efficiency). This effect was ascribed to the tighter packing of the 2-ethylhexyl-substituted co-oligomer as evidenced from XRD analysis.
In this respect, the group of Pei investigated how the position of the branching point in alkyl side chains influenced the charge carrier transport properties of isoindigo-based polymers.11 Although it may seem that polymeric field effect transistors are off the topic of oligomer-based BHJSCs, the obtained relationship between side-chain modification and mobility in thin films should be also applicable to π-conjugated oligomeric donor materials and may help to deduce important design rules. It turned out that polymers with an alkyl chain branching point at the C4-carbon atom gave the highest hole mobility manifesting itself as an empirical optimum. This relationship was also observed by other research studies and obviously constitutes a recurring phenomenon.12,13
Inspired by these studies, the strategy to structurally optimize highly efficient A–D–A oligothiophene 1, which comprises a 2-hexyldecyl chain at the central nitrogen of the dithienopyrrole (DTP) unit (Fig. 1, top) and gives excellent results in solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells (BHJSC),5–7 was the movement of the branching point of the 2-hexyldecyl chain in 1 to the C4-position resulting in a 4-hexyldecyl side chain in 2 (Fig. 1, bottom). By this relatively subtle structural modification realized in derivative 2, which represents an isomer of 1, the optoelectronic properties should remain rather unchanged, whereas the molecular packing and the morphology of the photoactive layer in the BHJ might be influenced. The established and optimized device fabrication protocol for 1 should remain applicable for 2 due to their very similar molecular structures.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of isomeric A–D–A oligothiophenes 1 and 2 (top); central DTP units substituted with hexyldecyl side chains branched at the C2- (left) and the C4-position (right), respectively. 
We therefore elaborated a multi-step synthesis of branched 4-hexyldecan-1-amine 11, which represents the central reagent for the synthesis of DTP-building block 13 used for the final assembly of oligothiophene 2. Besides the optoelectronic properties of the two isomeric co-oligomers 1 and 2, we describe the fabrication of solution-processed BHJSCs and their optimization via implementation of optical spacer layers (ZnO) and treatment with SVA leading to device efficiencies over 8%. Finally, by combining scanning transmission electron microscopy and low-energy-loss spectroscopy we find clear evidence of how the subtle change of the branching position in the side chain influences the morphology and phase separation of the photoactive layer which can be correlated to device performance.
2. Synthesis
The synthesis route for DTP-oligothiophene 2 was designed according to the previously reported synthesis of isomeric analogue 1 and other DCV-end-capped oligothiophenes.14 Thus, for the preparation of the central N-(4-hexyldecyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole unit, 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene 12, which is obtained according to a literature procedure,15 should be reacted with 4-hexyldecan-1-amine 11via Pd-catalyzed double Buchwald–Hartwig amination. Amine 11 is neither commercially available nor reported in the literature. The synthesis of primary amines comprising longer alkyl chains branched at C4, for example 4-decyltetradecan-1-amine, was described in a patent, which was used as a guideline for our synthesis of 4-hexyldecan-1-amine 11.16 The synthesis of precursor 5 was performed according to the patent, whereas the subsequent synthetic steps were not always applicable for the synthesis of amine 11 and were changed or optimized. Therefore, we here describe this synthesis in detail and the final elaborated synthetic route is depicted in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic pathway for the preparation of 4-hexyldecan-1-amine 11. 
As the first step, commercially available 1,4-butanediol 3 was protected at one hydroxyl moiety by a benzyl group to yield 4 in 93% yield.16 The next step was the Jones oxidation of the free hydroxyl group to a carboxylic acid and subsequent esterification to give intermediate 5 in 83% yield. Ester 5 was reacted with the Grignard reagent of 1-bromohexane to tertiary alcohol 6, which was isolated as a colorless liquid in 57% yield. The formal elimination of water from 6 was performed using Et3SiH and an excess of trifluoro acetic acid (TFA) and 52% of olefin 7 was obtained. The subsequent catalytic hydrogenation of the olefinic double bond in 7 to alcohol 8 was achieved in 95% yield by introducing hydrogen gas in a continuous flow through the reaction mixture. The resulting branched alcohol 8 was iodinated under Appel conditions with PPh3 as a ligand and imidazole as a base resulting in 4-hexyl-1-iododecan 9 in 97% yield. In a nucleophilic substitution reaction of iodide 9 with sodium azide in DMF, the corresponding azide 10 was obtained in 89% yield, which was further converted to target 4-hexyldecan-1-amine 11 in 86% yield by reduction with LiAlH4.
In the next step to DTP-oligothiophene 2, 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene 12 was reacted with amine 11 in a Pd-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig amination to give 4-hexyldecyl-substituted DTP 13 in 94% yield. Full conversion of DTP 13 to distannyl 14 was achieved with 2.2 equivalents of n-BuLi and subsequent quenching with trimethylstannyl chloride as reported in the literature.14 In a final Stille-type cross-coupling step, distannylated DTP 14 was reacted with the literature-known dicyanovinylene-substituted dihexyl-bithiophene 15 and Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in DMF to target oligomer 2 in 83% yield, which was obtained as a dark purple solid (Scheme 2).17 The structure and purity of 2 was proven via1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry.

3. Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of oligomer 2 were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy in dichloromethane (DCM) solution and compared to those of 1. The optical data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of 2 exhibited two main absorption bands with maxima at 399 nm and 563 nm, respectively, along with a good spectral coverage between 350–650 nm as depicted in Fig. 2a. The high energy absorption band is assigned to π–π* transitions of the oligothiophene backbone, whereas the low energy transition band displays a high degree of internal charge transfer (ICT) character. Thin films for solid-state absorption spectra of oligomer 2 were prepared by spin-coating a corresponding solution (c = 4 mg mL−1 in chloroform) on glass substrates and the UV-vis spectrum is also depicted in Fig. 2a. The absorption bands and the onset of 2 were red-shifted by approximately 100 nm compared with the solution spectrum leading to a decreased optical gap of 1.6 eV in the neat film (Table 1). This typical effect we address to increased planarization and π–π stacking of the oligomers upon solidification.

The redox properties of oligothiophenes 2 were determined by cyclic voltammetry in DCM and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate ((n-Bu)4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte and were compared with those of 1 (Fig. 2b). Redox potentials, the electrochemical gaps, as well as HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels are summarized in Table 1. Two reversible one-electron oxidation (2 × 1e−) processes (Eox1 ≈ 0.25 V; Eox2 ≈ 0.61 V) were observed for the two oligomers 1 and 2 at nearly the same potentials, which are assigned to the formation of stable radical cations and dications, respectively, located on the central oligothiophene block. In the negative potential regime, an irreversible reduction wave for the simultaneous reduction of the DCV-acceptor units (Ered1 ≈ −1.42 V) has been observed. The HOMO (≈ −5.28 eV) and LUMO energy levels (≈ −3.70 eV) of the two oligomers were calculated from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction wave. The resulting electrochemical gaps were around 1.58 eV. The very small variation of the absorption and redox potential data for the two isomeric oligomers 1 and 2 well reflects that, as expected, the different side chains and branching position at the DTP-unit only marginally influences the electronic properties of the conjugated backbone in solution and in thin films.
4. Photovoltaic performance
In order to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of oligomer 2 compared with the former donor 1, we solution-processed BHJSCs using a regular device structure consisting of a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/oligomer 2:PC71BM/ZnO/Al stack as shown in Fig. 3. Importantly, the device structure as well as the SVA setup were identical to those in our recent study using 1 as the donor.8 The first general observation during blend solution preparation is the difference in the solubility of both isomers. Oligothiophene 2 exhibited a very high solubility in chloroform (84 mg ml−1), which is by far sufficient to obtain good film-forming properties. Interestingly, isomeric oligomer 1 showed an even higher solubility of 123 mg mL−1. Therefore, oligomer 2 (84 mg mL−1 in CHCl3) needed longer stirring time to fully dissolve compared with oligomer 1 while preparing the blend solutions. To process the devices, we spin-coated blends of donor 2 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor from chloroform onto PEDOT:PSS-covered ITO substrates followed by SVA treatment. The devices were completed by first depositing ZnO layers from isopropanol solution on top of the SVA-treated blend followed by deposition of the Al cathode by thermal evaporation (Fig. 3). Thereby, the devices were optimized with regards to standard parameters such as D/A-ratio, donor concentration by keeping D/A-ratio constant, layer thickness, SVA time, and the implementation of an optical spacer layer consisting of ZnO-nanoparticles. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra as well as thin film absorption spectra of the BHJSC devices for 2/PC71BM are shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 2.

The first optimization experiments showed a clear trend indicating that blend solutions with a D/A ratio of 1:2 afforded the best results in terms of JSC and PCE. Furthermore, we observed that a donor concentration of 8 mg ml−1 led to better device performance and to an active-layer thickness of approximately 95 nm which was determined as optimal, since the best photovoltaic parameters for untreated and post-treated devices were obtained for this layer thickness. The optimization of the optical spacer layer consisting of ZnO resulted in an optimal layer thickness of 30 nm. As-cast devices gave a rather low performance with JSC of 3.44 mA cm−2 combined with VOC of 0.78 V and FF of 29% resulting in a device efficiency of 0.77%. In accordance with our recent work,8 the PCE was drastically increased to 5.66%, when the photoactive layer was post-treated with chloroform vapor (SVA) for only 10 s after coating. SVA mainly influenced the photocurrent density and the fill factor. An increase of the SVA time to 30 s gave excellent device performance with a PCE of 8.16%, a JSC of 13.62 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.79 V, and an FF of 75% (Fig. 4a). These conditions were obviously close to the optimum since longer SVA times (60 s) resulted in deterioration of the photovoltaic parameters (Table 2). Comparing the optimized photovoltaic data obtained for the novel (4-hexyldecyl)-DTP oligothiophene 2 with the data of isomeric 1 (2-hexyldecyl) prepared under identical SVA conditions of 30 s also yielded the best performance of JSC = 12.74 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.84 V, and FF = 72% leading to a PCE of 7.74%.8 It is worth emphasizing that compared to solar cells with oligomer 1 the photocurrent was increased by about 1 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the increase of the fill factor to 75% obtained for a device with an active area of 0.2 cm2 indicates highly efficient charge carrier extraction and low recombination inside the devices based on oligomer 2. However, comparing the VOC in optimized devices, we see that after optimization, devices based on 2 showed a clear loss of around 40 mV compared with 1, although the energy level of both molecules are identical. The difference may be related to the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layer, which will be discussed later.
The effect of SVA is also very clearly seen in the EQE and IQE spectra before and after the treatment: over the whole absorption regime (300–850 nm) the quantum efficiencies are improved by a factor of 3–4 reaching 68% EQE @ 642 nm and 82% IQE @ 500–700 nm, respectively (Fig. 4b and d). The vast enhancement in solar cell performance after 30 seconds of SVA suggests changes in the active layer morphology. The thin film absorption of the as-cast active layer displayed a prominent absorption band in the high energy region due to PC71BM, whereas the oligomer absorption at wavelengths above 500 nm showed significantly lower intensity (Fig. 4c). These findings correspond to the low photovoltaic performance of the corresponding device due to the low JSC caused by the low absorptivity of the oligomer which is caused by an unfavorable orientation of the donor molecules. After 30 s of SVA, the absorption intensity of the oligomer strongly increased indicating that the SVA treatment led to a higher order of the donor material.5,6 While changes in the absorption spectrum are similar for the two molecules 1 and 2, the EQE spectra of 2 showed higher EQE values in the absorption range of the oligomer (500–800 nm), indicating that the photocurrent generation inside the donor phase is improved compared with devices using oligomer 1. In the following, we studied the question of how far the movement of the branching point from C2 of the side chain of 1 to C4 of 2 may lead to an increased photocurrent and, more importantly, to very high fill factors of up to 75%. The thermal stability of optimized solar cells using oligomer 2 with a blend ratio of 1:2 and an SVA time of 30 s was studied under the thermal stress of two different temperatures, i.e., 120 °C and 140 °C. Complete devices were exposed to the annealing step for 15 min. We found that the initial solar cell performance of 8.16% decreased rapidly to 4.02% and 2.33% after a thermal stress of 120 °C and 140 °C, respectively, as shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI†). Importantly, the device structure itself including the corresponding interfacial layers of PEDOT:PSS and ZnO is thermally stable under such temperatures as demonstrated recently.18 This indicates that the thermal stability of the photoactive layer at an elevated temperature is limited, demanding further improvements via chemical engineering of the donor structure or combination with non-fullerene acceptors.
5. Electronic and morphological investigations of 2:PC71BM blends during solvent vapor annealing (SVA)
One of the reasons for an improvement in fill factor is a better balance in charge transport inside the blend; therefore, we first processed field-effect transistors with both oligomeric donors 1 and 2 to determine the hole mobility as a function of SVA annealing time. As can be seen in Table S2,† the movement of the branching point from C2 of the side chain of 1 to C4 of 2 reduces the mobility by about one order of magnitude from ∼5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1 to ∼6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2 in the case of as-cast layers. After SVA of 30 s, we observe an increase in mobility by about one order of magnitude for both molecules (1: ∼1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1; 2: ∼1 × 10−4), but the mobility of 2 is still smaller than that of 1. These analyses showed that changing the branching point impacts the electronic properties of the oligomer thin films by reducing hole mobility in the case of 2. This is in contrast to recent studies, as there an improvement in hole mobility was found.5–8 Due to the fact that the electron mobility in PC71BM-based polymer blends is usually in the range of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 as a function of the donor,19,20 we can conclude that the hole transport properties of both co-oligomers 1 and 2 can lead to sufficiently balanced hole and electron transport inside the bulk heterojunction. As the latter depends strongly on the nanoscale morphology of the donor and fullerene phases inside the blend, a detailed morphological study of the 2:PC71BM blend is essential for better understanding of the FF increase in solar cells based on oligomer 2. To establish a deeper understanding of the impact of the branching position on the donor crystallinity alone and in the presence of PC71BM, two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD) measurements were performed on pure 2 layers as well as on 2:PC71BM-blends before and after 30 s SVA (Fig. 5a). For these pure layers of oligomer 2, the patterns showed clear out-of-plane diffraction peaks for (100), (200), and (300) corresponding to a lamellar stacking of donor molecules and an in-plane π–π stacking diffraction peak. This implies that molecules 2 preferentially adopt an edge-on orientation. Profiles along the (100) peak before and after the 30 s SVA treatment (Fig. 5b) showed the enhancement of the (100) peak intensity implying an increased crystallinity of 2 upon SVA. By adding PC71BM, a broad non-oriented halo corresponding to the fullerene component appears in the patterns. Nevertheless, by the observation of the same characteristics assigned to 2, blending with PC71BM does not dramatically change the orientation or spacing of the lamellae. Similar to, and as observed previously for oligomer 1, the crystallinity of donor molecules blended with fullerenes increased by applying a short SVA time.8

Compared with pure layers of 1 (Fig. S3†), a slight shift of the (100) peak to smaller scattering vectors (low qz) indicates a thicker lamellar structure for 2 in pure layers. However, this difference tends to disappear for blend layers with similar lamellar structures after a 30 s SVA (Fig. S4†). The π–π stacking distance between the backbones is not impacted by the movement of the branching point of the 2-hexyldecyl chain in 1 to the C4-position resulting in a 4-hexyldecyl side chain in 2 whether in pure or in blend layers.
In order to gain deeper insight into the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layer, spectroscopic imaging using a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy and low-energy-loss spectroscopic imaging (STEM-SI) was applied to visualize the time evolution of the nanoscale morphological changes of 2:PC71BM blends as a function of SVA time.21 Indeed STEM-SI has been proven to be a reliable technique to distinguish between donor and acceptor phases with the high spatial resolution of the electron microscope.22,23 The analyzed blend layers were fabricated according to the parameters used for the fabrication of solar cells (Table 2) and transferred to an electron microscopy grid. Thereby, it was possible to visualize spatial differences and distinguish D- and A-rich domains in the bulk heterojunction by mapping the peaks of the spatially resolved volume plasmons. Red regions were assigned to PC71BM and the green ones to oligomer 2-enriched phases.
The plasmon-peak map for the as-cast blend is depicted in Fig. 6a. The image indicates strongly mixed phases of oligomer 2 and PC71BM-enriched phases lacking phase separation on a scale larger than a few nanometers. The plasmon-peak map indicates stronger accumulation of a PC71BM-rich phase throughout the entire blend compared with discontinuous donor phases. These findings correspond to the low photovoltaic performance of the corresponding device with low FF caused by high bi-molecular recombination rates. The corresponding map for the blend layer treated by 10 s SVA shows a slowly evolving and fine phase separation of the two materials and apparently donor-rich domains start to grow and to form a network (Fig. 6b). This relatively small change in morphology already caused a substantial improvement of the parameters, i.e., a strong increase of JSC from 3.44 to 12.59 mA cm−2 and FF from 29 to 57% resulting in an improvement in PCE from 0.77 to 5.66% (Table 2). The increase of the SVA time to 30 s results in a transformation of the blend into a nanostructured layer of well-defined, enlarged bicontinuous donor- and acceptor-rich phases where 2-enriched domains are embedded in highly connected PC71BM-enriched domains (Fig. 6c). As a consequence, the photovoltaic parameters were further improved, in particular to a considerable JSC of 13.62 mA cm−2, FF of 75%, and PCE of 8.16%. Longer exposure times to chloroform vapor resulted in further enhanced phase separation as illustrated in Fig. 6d. After 60 s of SVA, the plasmon-peak map of the blend revealed a coarsening of the blend layer morphology caused by further growth of the donor and acceptor phases and merging of donor-rich domains. The increasing domain sizes of both components signifies a decreased interfacial area in the BHJ and is reflected by a decline of the photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding solar cells. In particular, JSC decreased to 10.52 mA cm−2 resulting in an efficiency of 6.06%. Since longer exposure times to chloroform vapor would clearly further enhance the phase separation and concomitant domain growth, a progressive decrease of the photovoltaic performance was expected and corresponding experiments were no longer undertaken.

In order to obtain an estimation of the nanophase dimensions at various SVA times, power spectral densities (PSD) were calculated for the laterally resolved images in Fig. 6a–d (Fig. S5†). PSDs are rotationally averaged profiles of the power spectrum and thereby offer determination of predominant spatial features in the frequency domain. For the as-cast layer no peak could be identified. For 10 s SVA still no distinct peak can be observed, but a shoulder between 0.05–0.08 l nm−1 can be seen, which corresponds to domain sizes of 10–20 nm. For 30 s SVA a broader peak at 0.02 l nm−1 which corresponds to a 50 nm domain size and at 60 s SVA a peak at 0.012 l nm−1 corresponding to 83 nm are clearly visible.
STEM-SI analyses were performed on device cross-sections elucidating the vertical distribution of the donor and acceptor. Conventional dark-field and plasmon-peak maps were taken for the two extremes, as-cast devices with the lowest, and devices after 30 s of SVA, with the best performances. In accordance with the lateral maps, the vertical plasmon-peak map for the as-cast device showed intimately mixed donor and acceptor phases (Fig. 6e). For the best performing devices, the blend layer mostly resembles a homogeneously phase-separated bulk-heterojunction concurring with the lateral plasmon-peak map. However, on top of the photoactive layer we note an accumulation of acceptor domains towards the ZnO interface, whereas at the bottom a small oligomer 2-rich layer at the PEDOT:PSS-interface is identified (Fig. 6f). This composition gradient of the photoactive layer obviously guarantees efficient charge carrier generation in the middle part of the blend combined with optimized charge extraction at the interfaces towards the respective electrodes. These time-resolved analyses of SVA treated 2:PC71BM-blends finally allow identification of the major impact of the alteration in the branching point from C2 of the side chain of 1 to C4 of 2. Indeed, compared to the time evolution of 1:PC71BM blends under SVA, the modification of donor 2 allows slowing down donor and acceptor diffusion inside the blend. While the blend morphology before SVA can be considered as identical for both molecules, plasmon-peak maps already after 10 s show different morphologies. Indeed, phase separation in the case of 2:PC71BM blends is less pronounced than in the case of 1:PC71BM blends. After 30 s SVA, which corresponds to optimal processing time for both molecules, smaller donor and acceptor-enriched domain sizes are formed in the case of oligomer 2-based blends compared with those using 1. Furthermore, the cross section reveals a thinner PC71BM-enriched top layer at the ZnO interface as well as a 2-enriched layer at the PEDOT:PSS interface (Fig. 6g). The vertical cross-section of the 2:PC71BM blend rather more resembles a nanostructured bulk heterojunction with external enriched layers than a nanostructured bilayer as observed before for 1. This may be one of the reasons for the drop in VOC observed for 2-based devices. The quasi-optimal morphology of 2-based BHJSCs is responsible for the very high FF in combination with the improved JSC compared with 1 as shown in Table 2. It is important to highlight that the 2:PC71BM blend treated for only 10 seconds consists of extremely small enriched domains (below 5 nm and thus towards the detection limit given by the STEM-SI settings) but still produce 5.66% efficient solar cells with FF of 59%. By the fact that blends using oligomer 1 showed lower performance although the size of the donor and acceptor domains, respectively, is larger and thus more suitable to produce efficient photocurrent generation, we deduce that oligomer 2 is able to form donor domains of increased purity already at small sizes. This interpretation is supported not only by the higher FF, but also by the observation that solubility of 2 in a common solvent such as chloroform is less than for 1 indicating that intermolecular interaction, and thus the tendency to form pure domains, is increased.
6. Conclusion
In conclusion, subtle structural modification, i.e., shifting the branching point in a side chain away from the conjugated backbone, in a well-studied dithienopyrrole-based A–D–A oligothiophene has been applied to improve the power conversion efficiency of SVA-treated bulk-heterojunction solar cells. While optoelectronic properties were found not to be influenced by the chemical modification of the alkyl substitution pattern, the efficiency of the solution-processed solar cells could be increased to 8.2%. Time-dependent evolution studies of the micro- and nanoscale morphology of blends during solvent vapor annealing reveal that domain size and domain purity could be improved inside the blend consisting of oligomer 2 and PC71BM. The latter is addressed to slow down donor and acceptor diffusion during SVA through reduction in the solubility and compatibility of the donor with the fullerene derivate.

Instruments and measurements

1H NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents as specified in the synthetic procedures on a Bruker AMX 400 at 400 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 400 at 100 MHz. Chemical shifts are denoted by a δ unit (ppm) and are referenced to corresponding residual solvent peaks of the utilized deuterated solvent. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), and m (multiplet). Mass spectra were recorded with a Varian Saturn 2000 GC-MS and with a MALDI-TOF MS Bruker Reflex 2 (matrix: trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile) (DCTB). High resolution MALDI MS was measured on a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer solariX from Bruker Daltonics equipped with a 7.0 T superconducting magnet and interfaced to an Apollo II Dual ESI/MALDI source. CI-MS measurements were recorded on a Finnigan MAT, SSQ-7000. Melting points of the intermediates were determined with Büchi B-545 melting point apparatus and are not corrected. Melting points of the target compounds were measured via differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements on a Mettler Toledo DSC823e under an argon atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min. Thin-layer chromatography was carried out on Silica Gel 60 F254 aluminum plates (Merck). Solvents and reagents were purified and dried by the usual methods prior to use and used under an inert gas atmosphere. UV-vis spectra in DCM solution and thin films were taken on a PerkinElmer Lambda 19 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single compartment cell (3 mL). The platinum working electrode consisted of a platinum wire sealed in a soft glass tube with a surface of A = 0.785 mm2, which was polished down to 0.25 μm with Buehler polishing paste prior to use to guarantee reproducible surfaces. The counter electrode consisted of a platinum wire and the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferricenium couple. For the measurements, concentrations of 10−3 M of the electroactive species were used in freshly distilled and deaerated DCM (Lichrosolv, Merck) purified with an Braun MB-SPS-800 and 0.1 M (n-Bu)4NPF6 (Fluka; recrystallized twice from ethanol).
Device fabrication and photovoltaic characterization
Photovoltaic devices were made by spin-coating PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P, VP Al4083) onto pre-cleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (15 Ω cm−2) (Kintec). The photoactive layer was deposited by spin-coating donor 2 and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester of 99% purity purchased from Nano-C) from chloroform solutions (total concentration = 24 mg mL−1) without additives leading to layer thicknesses of ∼90–100 nm. The devices for oligomer 2 were fabricated by spin-coating at room temperature. The counter electrode aluminum (100 nm) was deposited by vacuum evaporation at 2 × 10−6 torr. The active areas of the cells were 0.27 cm2. Film thicknesses were measured using a Dektak profilometer.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 238 Source Measure Unit inside the glovebox using Lumtec substrates. Solar cell performance was measured by using a Newport class AAA 1.5 Global solar simulator (Oriel Sol3 ATM model no. 94043A) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was determined with a Si reference cell (Newport Company, Oriel no. 94043A) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Shadow masks were used to well define the illuminated area to 0.27 × 1.0 cm2. A comparison of masked and unmasked solar cells gave consistent results with photocurrent increasing by less 3% for unmasked devices. We present the performance of the best devices, while average PCEs were obtained with standard deviation analysis calculated using nine devices. External quantum efficiency measurements were performed in air using a homemade setup consisting of a Keithley 238 Source Measure Unit and a Newport monochromator. Light intensity was measured with a calibrated Si-diode from Newport Company.
Transmission electron microscopy
STEM-SI measurements were performed at 120 kV using a Titan 60–300 microscope (FEI) and an Enfinium spectrometer (Gatan). Planar specimens were prepared by floating the photoactive layer off the substrate through dissolving of the PEDOT:PSS layer followed by capturing with an electron microscopy grid covered with a holey carbon film (QUANTIFOIL®). Cross-sections were prepared on solar cell devices with a Helios Nanolab 650 (FEI). Scanning step sizes for STEM-SI imaging were set to 3 nm for planar analyses, and to 1.5 nm for cross-sectional analyses. Spatially resolved spectroscopic data sets were processed and fitted using HyperSpy as explained previously.21 Power spectral densities were calculated using the software package SPIDER (System for Processing Image Data from Electron microscopy and Related fields, Wadsworth Center).
X-ray diffraction analysis of thin films
Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD) experiments were conducted at beamline BL19B2 in SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan: proposal number 2016A1568). The X-ray beam was monochromatized by a double-crystal Si(111) monochromator, and the X-ray energy was 12.398 keV (λ = 1 Å). The incident angle was set to 0.12° with a Huber diffractometer and the sample-to-detector distance was about 174 mm. Diffracted X-ray from samples was recorded by an X-ray photon counting pixel detector (PILATUS 300K, Dectris) for 30 s at room temperature.

Dithienopyrrole 13 (1.08 g, 2.66 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved in 15 mL dry THF under an argon atmosphere and the solution was cooled to −78 °C. N-Butyl lithium (1.6 M, 3.99 mL, 6.39 mmol, 2.4 eq.) was added dropwise and the solution was stirred for 1 h at −78 °C, and then warmed up to 0 °C and stirred again for 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to −78 °C and trimethylstannyl chloride (1.33 g, 6.66 mmol, 2.5 eq.) dissolved in 5 mL dry THF was added swiftly. The mixture stirred for 2.5 h at −78 °C before the reaction was terminated by adding petroleum ether (30 mL) and washed with deionized water (3 × 50 mL). The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and afforded distannyl 14 as a dark green liquid (1.94 g, 2.65 mmol, 100%). The product was used without further purification. 1H-NMR (400 MHz, THF-d2): δ [ppm] = 7.11 (s, 2H, β-H), 4.23 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H, N–CH2), 1.91–1.81 (m, 2H, N–CH2–CH2), 1.34–1.19 (m, 23H, CH2), 0.88 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 6H, CH3), 0.38 (s, 18H, Sn–CH3).
