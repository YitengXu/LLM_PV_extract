    , Accepted 30th March 2012First published on 2nd April 2012AbstractPower generation through photovoltaics (PV) has been growing at an average rate of 40% per year over the last decade; but has largely been fuelled by conventional Si-based technologies. Such cells involve expensive processing and many alternatives use either toxic, less-abundant and or expensive elements. Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has been identified as a solar energy material composed of both less toxic and more available elements. Power conversion efficiencies of 8.4% (vacuum processing) and 10.1% (non-vacuum processing) from cells constructed using CZTS have been achieved to date. In this article, we review various deposition methods for CZTS thin films and the synthesis of CZTS nanoparticles. Studies of direct relevance to solar cell applications are emphasised and characteristic properties are collated.

1. Introduction
Ternary semiconductors derived from chalcopyrite were explored widely in the 1980s and are used in commercially available solar cells.1,2 Subsequently there have been substantial developments in the use of a wide range of such materials for devices. The highest solar energy conversion efficiencies reported so far in this type of system (CIGS), is 19.9% for CuInGaSe2; (a 0.5 cm2 laboratory scale cell),3 16.6% (16 cm2 modules of CuInGaSe2)4 and 15.7% (9703 cm2 modules of CuInGaSe2).5 CuInS2 is derived from the cubic sphalerite (ZnS) in which two Zn(II) ion are substituted by Cu(I) and In(III) preserving the cubic symmetry. However both In and its alternate Ga are relatively rare and expensive elements. Cheaper, and potentially more cost-effective, materials are formed by replacing the two In(III) ion with Zn(II) and Sn(IV) giving Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS). This interesting I2-II-IV-VI4 semiconductor has great potential with a useful band gap of 1.4–1.5 eV, a large absorption coefficient of over 104 cm−1 and is devoid of notably toxic or expensive elements. Since the pioneering work by the IBM team of Mitzi and co-workers in 2010, there has been a heightened interest in developing CZTS absorber layer for thin film solar cells; Fig. 1 shows the number of research articles reported each year on CZTS since 1988.

The first report on the growth of single-crystal CZTS was by Nistche et al., they used iodine vapour transfer method for the crystal growth and provided lattice data which helped them conclude that the structure was of the stannite type.6 Ito and Nakazawa fabricated a heterojunction diode consisting of the CZTS thin film by atom beam sputtering of target quaternary compound.7 Following these reports a number of groups have experimented on various methods to produce CZTS thin films including thermal evaporation of the elements, spray methods, sulfurization of precursors, sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, electrochemical deposition, solution methods, chemical vapour deposition and wet chemical nanoparticle synthesis. The latest reported photo-conversion efficiency of CZTS is 10.1% by Barkhouse et al., from material obtained using a hybrid solution-particle slurry method.8 The major challenge in the construction of CZTS based solar cells is to develop impurity free, stoichiometric and phase controlled film deposition.
In this article we will discuss recent development in CZTS thin film deposition methods and nanoparticle synthesis; their characteristic properties will be commented on especially those of relevance to solar cell application.
2. Structure of CZTS
The quaternary semiconductor CZTS has two different crytalline forms stannite and kesterite. Kesterite CZTS has the space group I whereas stannite structure is I2m. In the kesterite structure one of the Cu atom occupies the 2a position, Zn and the remaining Cu are ordered at 2d and 2c with Madelung potentials of −15.04 V, −21.88 V and −15.21 V respectively.9 In the stannite structure both Cu atoms occupy the 4d position and the Zn is at 2a and their corresponding Madelung potentials are −15.30 V and −21.62 V. Sn is located at 2b in both the structures. The Madelung potentials are −35.04 V for kesterite and −34.95 V for stannite. The two structures, kesterite and stannite are viewed conventionally as a 1 × 1 × 2 tetragonal expansion of zinc-blende with different ordering in the II–IV cation sub lattice (Fig. 2). The kesterite structure, by a full-potential linearized augmented plane wave calculation, has a total energy some −1.3 meV/atom lower than its stannite counterpart.10 There is only a minute difference in the lattice parameters between the kesterite and stannite. The similar lattice constants and total energy values mean that there is often the possibility of both phases existing together depending on the methods used to prepare the material.

3. CZTS thin films
The first thin films of CZTS were prepared by Ito and Nakazawa in 1988 by an atom beam sputtering method. The sputtering target was prepared from a stoichiometric mixture of the elements sealed under vacuum in a quartz ampule at 1050 °C for 48 h. The p-XRD data from the films deposited at 90 °C on glass substrate revealed a peak for the (112) plane. The UV analysis indicated the absorption coefficient to be greater than 1.2 × 104 cm−1 with a bandgap higher than 1.3 eV. Resistivity values decreased from 4 × 104 ohm cm to 1.3 ohm cm with increases in substrate temperature (90–240 °C). A hetero-junction diode with a cadmium tin oxide transparent conductive film showed an open circuit voltage of 165 mV.7
3.1. Spray pyrolysis
Spray pyrolysis is potentially a low-cost method suitable for large areas in which precursor solutions are sprayed at a heated substrate. After the initial spray, solvent evaporation takes place at or preferably before the substrate.11 Various metalloorganic compounds or metal salts dissolved in aqueous or organic solvents can be used as precursor solution in spray pyrolysis process. There have been a large number of reports on chalcopyrite based solar absorber films by spray pyrolysis methods.12–14 Solar cells of CuInS2 with up to 5% efficiency of have been prepared by this method.15 Almost a decade after the first report on CZTS thin films, spray pyrolysis of CZTS has now been significantly developed. Solutions of CuCl, ZnCl2, SnCl4 and thiourea in 50:50 water/ethanol were used with a glass substrate at temperatures between 280 and 360 °C. Solute concentrations in the spray solution were used to control the chemical composition of the films. Traces of microcrystalline ZnSnO3 were observed when the films were sprayed in only ethanol; an electrical resistivity value of 2 × 10 Ω cm was obtained.16
In another approach, thiourea complexes were used as precursors. Cu2(tu)6Cl2·2H2O, Zn(tu)2Cl2, Sn2(tu)5Cl4·2H2O and Sn(tu)Cl2 (tu = thiourea) prepared from aqueous thiourea solutions were decomposed in a simultaneous thermogravimetric/ differential thermoanalytical apparatus. Cu9S5 (digenite), ZnS (zinc blende) and SnS2 (berndtite) were formed in static air—with the main degradation step between 200 °C and 300 °C. Primary oxidation products of sulfides such as Cu2O(SO4) (dolerophandite), ZnO and SnO2 were observed above 400 °C.17,18 However they were successful in obtaining spray pyrolysis depositions of CuSnS3 and Cu2ZnSnS4 films in the substrate temperature range 225–350 °C from CuCl, ZnCl2, SnCl2 and thiourea. The effect of temperature on film growth and composition was investigated.
A solution containing cupric chloride, zinc acetate, stannic chloride and thiourea gave Cu2SnS3 and CuxS as a secondary phases along with CZTS at 290 °C, the presence of CuxS phase was seen at 330 °C whereas at 450 °C ZnS appeared.19 In another report the same group studied the effect of the pH of the starting solution on film composition during the spray pyrolysis process. Films deposited using a solution at pH = 3 were polycrystalline and non-stoichiometric. At pH = 4.5 films contained a mixture of CuxS, ZnS phases along with CZTS whereas at pH = 5.5 the films were primarily of binary sulfides.20 From the various studies made on spray pyrolysis method for the growth of CZTS films it can generally be observed that the films were contaminated with impurities such as CuxS, ZnS, CuSnS3 and a complete solar device is yet to be fabricated from this method.
Htay et al., compared the solar energy conversion efficiency with ZnO as buffer layer instead of the more usual CdS.21 The results are promising in terms of finding alternative to Cd in the buffer layer. Layers of Cu, Zn and Sn metals were annealed under sulfur vapor to prepare CZTS layers. ZnO layers were deposited on CZTS films by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. Solar energy conversion efficiency was reported as 4.29% from CZTS/ZnO which is comparable to that of CZTS/CdS (4.32%).
3.2. E-beam and thermal evaporation
The e-beam evaporation method is a vacuum deposition process. A tungsten filament inside the electron gun is heated which emits electrons to form a beam which is directed toward the target materials. When the electron beam strikes the target surface, kinetic energy is transformed by the impact into thermal energy. This energy evaporates the target materials. The e-beam deposition method is advantageous for the control of stoichiometry in alloy films. This method also has liabilities such as equipment cost and use of high voltages. The use of e-beam deposition method has been investigated for the growth of ternary and quaternary semiconductors type I-III-VI2 by many research groups.22
In 1997 Katagiri et al., used electron beam evaporation followed by sulfurization to prepare films of CZTS.23 The method involved stacking layers of zinc (160 nm), tin (230 nm) and copper (180 nm); then sulfurizing them in an electric furnace at a temperature of 500 °C in the presence of nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide. The film deposited had a band gap of 1.45 eV which is almost the optimum value for a solar cell absorber. The solar cell derived from these films was found to have an open circuit voltage of 400 mV, but the conversion efficiency was only 0.66% which was due to the degraded fill factor. The same group replaced Zn with ZnS and carried out the experiment with films of different thicknesses (3000, 4500 and 6000 Å) and kept the ZnS, Sn and Cu ratio constant at 1.00:0.63:0.40 for sulfurization and obtained thin films of 0.95 1.34 and 1.63 μm thicknesses.
The scanning electron micrograph in Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology of the films prepared from Cu/ZnS/Sn to have a columnar structure and a smoother surface compared to the ones prepared from Cu/Zn/Sn and it is also reported that the latter has a comparatively poor adhesion to the substrate surface. They succeeded in obtaining conversion efficiencies of 2.62% and an open circuit voltage of 735 mV.24 The electron-beam evaporation with sulfurization method was repeated varying the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio from 0.5 to 1.2 to investigate differences in morphology and optical properties.

The SEM image of film compositions (Cu/Zn + Sn) CZTS-0.49, CZTS-0.83 and CZTS-1.18 in Fig. 4 shows the presence of large particles on the film surface. Optimization of the sulfurization was carried out by varying the sulfurization temperature from 510 °C to 550 °C and a higher conversion efficiency of 4.53% was obtained at 520 °C.25 Multi-stage evaporation was established for the deposition of CZTS films by Weber et al.26 Two stage sequences were investigated, in the first stage Cu2SnS3 was used as a precursor to react with Zn-S and in the second stage ZnS was used as a precursor to react with Cu-Sn-S. Devices constructed from these films showed 0.7% conversion efficiency from Cu2SnS3 as a precursor and 1.1% conversion efficiency were obtained when ZnS was used as precursor.

Recently, Shin et al., fabricated solar cell with 8.4% conversion efficiency.27 CZTS thin films with thickness of ∼600 nm were deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation method. In this method, vacuum system with Knudsen-type sources of elemental Cu, Zn and Sn and for S valved cracker was used. The solar cell showed open circuit voltage of 661 mV a short-circuit current density 19.5 mA cm−2 with a filling factor of 65.8%. This is the highest efficiency reported for CZTS solar cells by any method.
3.3. Sputtering
A radiofrequency magnetron sputtering process was investigated by Jae-Sung Seol in 2003. Corning 7059 glass substrates were used to deposit thin films of Cu2ZnSnS4 without substrate heating by rf magnetron sputtering. The Cu/(Zn + Sn) thin films sputtered at 75 W was near to stoichiometric ratio whereas the S/(Cu + Zn + Sn) ratio was lesser than that of CZTS. The films had band gap of 1.51 eV and an optical absorption coefficient of about 1.0 × 104 cm−1 which were less than the values obtained for CuInS2 but the appropriate band gap energy values were obtained for these photovoltaic materials.28
A hybrid sputtering method was also experimented with for the fabrication of CZTS thin films. The system consisted of a deposition chamber with sputtering sources for Cu and Sn and effusion cells for Zn and S. The fluxes from the four sources were focussed on the substrate with the pressure maintained below 1 × 10−4 Pa. The films were fabricated by sequential deposition of Sn, Zn and Cu and then subsequent annealing under S atmosphere. The depositions were carried out at various temperatures. The films formed at 400 °C had the stoichiometric composition of CZTS, an optical band gap of about 1.5 eV and resistivity of 0.13 ohm cm. It was also observed that films from substrate temperature lower than 400 °C showed p-type conductivity.29
In an attempt to co-evaporate thin films of CZTS, a vacuum deposition chamber with four effusion cells was used. The fluxes were focused on the glass substrates and film growth was monitored. Film thickness decreased with increase in substrate temperature, the decrease being from 0.7 μm at 400 °C to 0.1 μm at 600 °C. This decrease may be attributed to the sticking coefficient of the elements. As a consequence of the substrate not being rotated during the film growth, graded Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios were obtained on the substrate plane at 400 °C. Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios were in the range of 0.7–1.3 and 0.6–1.6 respectively depending on the in plane position. However the ratio of sulfur to metal was found to be almost 1, independent of the position.30
Katagiri et al., have prepared thin films of CZTS on Mo coated soda lime glass by RF sputtering from ZnS, SnS and Cu using an inline type vacuum apparatus. They have claimed that the use of inline type vacuum apparatus showed an improvement of consistency in conversion efficiency of 5.33% and 5.74%. SEM images of the films deposited by this method in Fig. 5 shows crystallites of 1 μm size with fewer air voids.31 A CZTS based solar cell with 6.7% efficiency was fabricated using magnetron sputtered CZTS thin films on Mo-coated soda lime glass in which the CdS buffer layer was grown on the CZTS absorber layer by a CBD method.32 The cell showed open circuit voltage 610 mV and a short-circuit current density 17.9 mA cm−2 with a filling factor of 0.62 (Fig. 6).

Rf sputtering deposition methods have been employed to stack metallic layers of Cu, Zn, and Sn before sulfurization to form CZTS films. Three different types of CZTS thin films were obtained Cu-rich Cu2ZnSnS4 (CR-CZTS), Cu-correct Cu2ZnSnS4 (CC-CZTS) and Cu-poor Cu2ZnSnS4 (CP-CZTS). The Cu2-xS phase was observed from CR- and CC-CZTS films whereas it was not seen in the CP-CZTS films. Morphological analysis by scanning electron microscope showed a smoother surface from CP-CZTS than the other films.33 DC-reactive magnetron sputtering is yet another method in which a Cu-Zn-Sn alloy disk with a diameter of 60 mm and thickness of 6 mm was used as the sputtering target. The film showed a near-stoichiometric composition and was oriented along the (112) plane with minor phases of Cu2-xS and Cu3SnS4.34 Films consisted of dense large columnar grains and have showed p-type conductivity with carrier concentration in the order of 1018 cm−3. Recently, in situ growth of CZTS films by reactive magnetron co-sputtering technique was carried out by Liu et al.35 The films prepared were primarily of single phase of CZTS as evidenced by a single peak at 336 cm−1 by Raman spectroscopy and no peaks corresponding to any other impurities were observed. SEM analysis showed a homogeneous, polycrystalline and dense morphology consisting of grains of 100 nm size. The electrical measurement on CZTS films showed a resistivity of 5.4 Ω cm and a carrier concentration of 3.889 × 1016 cm−3 with p-type conductivity.
3.4. Photochemical deposition (PCD)
Photo-chemical deposition has been employed to produce CZTS thin films. An aqueous solution of CuSO4, ZnSO4, SnSO4 and NaS2O3 was flowed on soda-lime glass substrates and illuminated a region of 10 mm with deep-UV light of 254 nm and deposition was carried out for 1 h. Sulfides of Cu, Zn and Sn were formed only in the regions irradiated with deep UV light. The films exhibited a band gap of 1.5 eV and weak XRD peaks. Photoconductivity measurement was made with a light source of non-monochromated Hg-Xe lamp (150 W). CZTS film annealed at 400 °C was irradiated; results indicated a reduction in resistance from 349.1 Ω to 336.4 Ω. This was the first photoconductivity measurement made on a CZTS film.36
3.5. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD)
Pulsed laser deposition is an alternative process in which a KrF laser beam was used to ablate pellets of CZTS and whose fragments were deposited on GaP substrates at 300 and 400 °C. The deposition of CZTS films were confirmed by p-XRD and pole figure measurements.37 This technique was further explored for solar cell construction using the CZTS films. The films were deposited on Mo-coated soda lime glass. The resulting solar cell showed a short-circuit current of 6.78 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.48 an open circuit voltage of 546 mV, with conversion efficiency of 1.74%.38 Pawar et al., have investigated the effect of laser incident energy on the structural, morphological and optical properties of CZTS thin films.39 In their method a CZTS target was prepared by the solid-state reaction of Cu2S, ZnS and SnS2. The powder was shaped into a pellet, sealed inside an evacuated quartz ampoule, and kept at 750 °C for 24 h. p-XRD pattern of the films showed that the increasing laser incident energy and the intensity of diffraction peak becomes relatively more intense and sharper indicating an improvement in crystallinity; the films begin to degrade upon increasing the laser power to 3.0 J cm−2. This was also reflected in morphology of the films as increasing the incident laser energy the grain size of the CZTS increased. More recently, solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.14% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 651 mV, a short circuit current (ISC) of 8.76 mA cm−2 and fill factor of 0.55 was reported from CZTS films deposited by PLD.40
3.6. Electrochemical deposition (ECD)
Whilst non-vacuum techniques are potentially lower-cost production methods as compared large scale vacuum methods. The cost of production will depend on many factors such as: yield, efficiency, energy consumption, raw material cost, environmental friendliness and safety. Electrochemical deposition methods have certain advantages in terms of low-cost and potential for large area deposition. The ability of electrochemical deposition to deposit large area photovoltaic devices have been proven for the deposition of CIGS and CdTe based absorber layers.41,42
CZTS films were made from metallic layers, Cu, Zn and Sn electrochemically deposited using a conventional 3-electrode cell with a platinum counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The metallic layers were annealed in a sulfur atmosphere to form CZTS films at 550 °C. The p-XRD showed that the calculated lattice values matched well with literature values although some peaks were observed from SnS2. The deposited films were grey in colour, non-uniform and non-reflective. The morphology of the films confirmed the films consist of well-defined crystallites with an average grain size of less than 0.5 microns.
The cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 7 shows the regularly shaped crystallites deposited on top of Mo layer. The cell fabricated using the CZTS layer prepared via the electrodeposition route showed open circuit voltage of 295 mV, a short circuit current density of 8.7 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.32 with conversion efficiency of 0.8%.43,44 Ennaoui et al., fabricated solar cells based on CZTS absorbers in which ternary alloys of Cu-Zn-Sn layers were first prepared by electrochemical deposition using alkaline electrolyte containing Cu(II), Zn(II) and Sn(IV) thereafter the metallic layers were reacted with Ar/H2S to form CZTS films.45Fig. 8 shows cross-section SEM image of electro deposited Cu-Zn-Sn precursors on Mo-coated glass substrate. Images show the columnar grains extended on top of Mo layer. The best cell performance was obtained from copper poor samples with efficiency of 3.4%, open circuit voltage of 563 mV and a fill factor of 41%.

CZTS materials were prepared by annealing Cu/Sn/Zn precursors deposited by electroplating onto glass/Mo/Pd substrates with sulfur in an N2 atmosphere. The compositions of the films sulfurized at 600 °C were slightly zinc- rich and sulfur poor for zinc rich precursors and slightly tin rich for tin rich precursors. A cell fabricated with the CZTS films produced by sulfurizing an electroplated precursors displayed an open circuit voltage of 262 mV and a conversion efficiency of 0.98%.46 Araki et al., prepared zinc-rich CZTS films by electrochemical deposition using an electrolyte solution containing copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, zinc sulfate heptahydrate, tin(II) chloride dihydrate and tri-sodium citrate dihydrate, followed by sulfurization with sulfur at 580 °C and 600 °C.46 SEM images in Fig. 9 show surface image of an electrodeposited Cu-Zn-Sn precursors with a thickness of approximately 1 μm. Films consists of pillar shaped grains with size range of 0.5–1 μm. The photovoltaic cell constructed from the above method showed open circuit voltage of 540 mV with a conversion efficiency of 3.16%.47

CZTS films prepared by electrodeposition sulfurization have recently been reported by Scragg et al., in which the metallic layers in the stacking order of Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn were prepared and then the layers were sulfurized at 575 °C in an N2 atmosphere. The total area of the device including contacts was 0.234 cm2 with an open circuit voltage of 480 mV and a fill factor of 45% with and overall power conversion of 3.2%.48 The use of choline chloride based ionic liquid in an electrodeposition process to CZTS has also been investigated and the optical measurement results are comparable with films deposited by e-beam deposition methods. The photovoltaic cell was not fabricated using the films prepared by ionic-liquid electrodeposition method.49
3.7. Sol–gel methods
The first photoluminescence of a CZTS film was reported by Miyamoto et al., on films prepared by a sol–gel sulfurization method.50 The PL spectra from samples of stoichiometrically controlled and copper poor, zinc rich films showed a broad emission between 1.1 and 1.45 eV with activation energy of 39 and 59 mV. The composition difference between the films resulted in a 24.7 mV blue shift in PL peak energy. Tanaka et al., fabricated solar cell using CZTS absorber layer in which CZTS thin films were prepared by a sol–gel method.51 Solutions of copper(II) acetate monohydrate, zinc(II) acetate dihydrate and tin(II) chloride dihydrate in a mixed solution of 2-methoxyethanol and monoethanolamine (MEA) as a stabilizer were used. The solar cell gave a 390 mV open-circuit voltage, 0.33% fill factor and 1.01% efficiency. A good conversion efficiency of 1.61% and an open circuit voltage of 554 mV with fill factor of 43.4% has been reported.52 The same group of researchers constructed the improved solar cell with conversion efficiency of 2.03% two years later. The highest conversion efficiency was obtained on CZTS films with composition of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.80.53
3.8. Solution methods
Soft-solution methods are an alternative low-cost film production process. In these processes a substrate is covered with a solution of precursor, the film is obtained after subsequent thermal or chemical treatment. A solution method for CZTS was developed by Todorov et al. In their method metal salts were reacted directly with elemental sulfur in ethyleneglycol to obtain dispersible nanoparticles.54 Films were coated on soda-lime glass substrates by sliding a glass rod over 50 μm thick spacer. Films were thermally treated at 150 °C after drying at room temperature. The p-XRD data showed the presence of CZTS particles and SEM images displayed round-shaped homogenous nanoparticle sizes of 200 nm. Optical measurement showed bandgap values of 1.32–1.85 eV from films of differing stoichiometry.
Recently, Fischereder et al., prepared CZTS thin films using metal salts and thioacetamide (TAA) by a chemical bath method.55 The precursors were metal salts such as copper(I) iodide, zinc(II) acetate, tin(II) chloride with TAA as the sulfur source in pyridine. The effect of temperature and the concentration of TAA on CZTS film growth were investigated by X-ray diffraction and scattering analysis. Grazing incident small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS, GISAXS) analysis revealed that the films growth from precursors starts at 105 °C. The optical measurements showed that the films deposited had bandgaps between 1.41 and 1.81 eV. Films deposited with 3.5 equivalents of TAA gave rough surfaces whilst microstructured films were seen with 5 equivalents of TAA. No photovoltaic cells or electrical measurements were reported.
A record 9.6% efficient cell was fabricated recently using a hybrid particle-solution approach by Teodor et al. In their report the thin films were deposited from a slurry of Cu-Sn chalcogenide solution in hydrazine.56 It is believed to lead to the in situ formation of readily dispersible particle based Zn chalcogenide precursors, ZnSe(N2H4) or ZnS(N2H4). This slurry based deposition method has significant advantages over other thin film deposition methods in terms of overcoming the insolubility issues of some chalogenide precursors. The dissolved component act as a binder for the particles, the solid particles help to relieve the stress thereby allowing thicker film deposition and the contact between two phases leading to fast reaction and the homogeneous film formation. Three types of films: Cu2ZnSnSe4, Cu2ZnSn(SSe)4 and Cu2ZnSnS4 were grown with copper poor and zinc rich compositions. Powder X-ray diffraction data confirmed the films grown are well crystalline kesterite phase with cell volume of 364.6 Å3, 346.1 Å3 and 319.9 Å3 for Cu2ZnSnSe4, Cu2ZnSn(SSe)4 and Cu2ZnSnS4 respectively. Cross-sectional SEM images of Cu2ZnSn(SSe)4 in Fig. 10 shows the films consisting of large grains sizes of 1–2.5 μm with voids. The measured cell performance were an open a circuit voltage of 412 mV, current density of 36.4 mA cm−2 and 62% fill factor with a conversion efficiency of 9.30% from the Cu2ZnSnSe4 films whilst Cu2ZnSn(SSe)4 films had 516 mV open circuit voltage and 28.6 mA cm−2 current density and 65% fill factor with conversion efficiency of 9.66%. Further improving the performance of solar cell constructed by this method, same group at IBM have fabricated the solar cell with power conversion efficiency of 10.1%.8 The device showed open circuit voltage of 517 mV, current density of 30.8 mA cm−2 and 63.7% fill factor.

3.9. Screen printing
Zhou et al., fabricated CZTS layers on flexible polyimide substrates by screen printing methods.57 Elemental copper, zinc, tin and sulfur were ball milled at 100 rpm for 12 h. The microparticles of CZTS were dispersed in isopropanol. Separately, ethyl cellulose was dissolved in isopropanol. The ink for the screen printing was prepared by mixing both solutions with small amount of terpinol. Hall effect measurement showed that screen printed layers has 3.81 × 1018 cm−3 carrier concentration, 2.42 × 103 Ω resistivity with hall mobility of 12.61 cm2 V−1S−s.
Photovoltaic cell fabricated using CZTS from this methods exhibited an open circuit voltage of 386 meV, a fill factor of 0.27% and conversion efficiency of 0.49%.
3.10. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD)
Chemical vapour deposition is a well-known method for the deposition of high quality thin films for various applications including films for bio-medical applications; and electronic materials for lasers, displays, sensors, batteries and solar cells.58 The deposition of CZTS films by chemical vapour deposition was reported only recently by aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD). This omission could be due to the difficulties of finding suitable precursors for the deposition of such a complicated ternary system. Exploiting our experience in the field of precursor development for various CVD,58 we demonstrated that the diethyldithiocarbamate complexes of copper, zinc and dibutyl derivative of tin are suitable precursors for the deposition CZTS films by AACVD. Thermogravimetric analysis of the precursors suggested that all the three precursors decomposed to corresponding metal sulfides at similar temperatures 284 °C for (1), 303 °C for (2) and 300 °C for (3). CZTS films were grown on glass substrates at temperatures of 360, 400, 440 and 480 °C with the argon flow of 160 sccm. P-XRD data confirmed the presence of kesterite phase type film growth with the absence of any other binary sulfides. SEM images in Fig. 11 showed the films composed of closely packed granular crystallite sizes of 150–200 nm. Cross sectional SEM images showed the films are 690 nm thicker at 360 °C and 1150 nm thicker at 400 °C. HRTEM images showed the crystallites with the lattice spacings of 3.17 Å corresponding to (112) reflection of kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4. The optical measurements showed the films have bandgap of 1.3–1.5 eV.59

4. CZTS nanoparticles
The synthesis and study of semiconductor nanoparticles has attracted a vast amount of interest in recent years because of their tunable optical and electrical properties on varying dimensions of the order of nanometres.60–62 Semiconductor nanoparticles have been exploited for various electronic applications including in: sensors, light emitting diodes, solar cells. Considerable research effort has been focused on the synthesis of the I-III-VI2 family nanoparticles and their use in solar energy in recent years.63–66 Guo et al., reported the first synthesis of nanoparticulate of CZTS and its use as an absorber for a solar cell; the nanoparticles were prepared by a hot injection method.67 The nanoparticle synthesis was carried out with copper(II) acetylacetonate, zinc(II) acetylacetonate and tin(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) dibromide as metal sources which were heated in the coordinating solvent oleylamine at 225 °C, elemental sulfur in oleylamine was injected into the solution. The p-XRD pattern showed the as synthesised particles belonged to kesterite phase with lattice parameters of 5.421 and 10.816 Å for a and c respectively. TEM analysis showed the synthesised nanoparticles to be polydispersed in the size range of 15–25 nm. (Fig. 12) The elemental composition of CZTS nanoparticles measured by EDX analysis showed Cu2.12Zn0.84Sn1.06S4; slightly copper rich. A photovoltaic cell was fabricated by drop casting CZTS nanoparticles onto a Mo coated soda lime glass substrates. The nanoparticle films were then selenized under selenium vapour at temperatures between 400 and 500 °C. Devices fabricated using the selenized nanoparticles at 450 °C showed conversion efficiency of 0.74% with open circuit voltage of 188 mV, current density of 10.5 mA cm−3 and a fill factor of 37.2% whereas samples from 500 °C showed a slight improvement in conversion efficiency to 0.80% with open circuit voltage of 210 mV, current density of 11.5 mA cm−3 and fill factor 33.1%.

Korgel, Synthesis of Cu2ZnSnS4 nanocrystals for use in low-cost photovoltaics, 12554, Copyright (2009) with permission from American Chemical Society]. 
Soon after another group of researchers reported a slightly modified method to CZTS nanoparticles.68 Copper(II) acetylacetonate, zinc acetate and tin(IV) acetate were heated with oleylamine at 150 °C. In a separate vessel sulfur powder was sonicated with oleylamine. Both metal and sulfur mixtures were injected into a vessel containing coordinating solvent trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) at 300 °C. The as synthesised nanoparticles are almost monodispersed with an average size of 12.8 ± 1.8 nm, the EDX analysis showed the elemental compositions of the particles are in 2:1:1:4 ratio of Cu, Zn, Sn and S respectively. The measured optical bandgap was 1.5 eV effectively indicating no quantum confine effect. No device fabrication was reported. A similar method of synthesis was reported by Steinhagen et al., to prepare CZTS nanoparticles using oleylamine as a coordinating solvent. The method yielded average particle of 10.9 ± 2.9 nm which were irregularly shaped. Elemental composition was Cu2.08Zn1.01Sn1.20S3.70 with an optical bandgap of 1.3 eV. A photovoltaic device fabricated using these nanoparticles showed conversion efficiency of 0.23% with an open circuit voltage of 321 meV, current density of 1.95 mA cm−2 and fill factor of 0.37.69
Nanoparticles of Cu2ZnSnSe4 have recently been reported. The preparation method involved the hot injection of trioctylphosphine selenium (TOPSe) at 295 °C into the metal amine complexes which were prepared reacting metal chlorides with hexadecylamine (HDA) at 150 °C. The prepared nanoparticles were 20 nm in size, monodispersed with highly faceted polyhedral geometries.70 Kameyama et al., made both synthetic and photoelectrochemical studies of CZTS nanoparticles.71 The synthesis was carried out by a thermal reaction of metal acetates with elemental sulfur in an oleylamine solution at different temperatures. The particles prepared at low temperatures 120 and 180 °C are mainly of CuS while at higher temperature the reaction gave CZTS particles as confirmed by p-XRD and UV-vis anaylsis. TEM analysis showed polydispersed spherical particles with an average size of 6.6 ± 1.5 nm at 120 °C, 6.6 ± 1.3 nm at 180 °C, 5.6 ± 1.2 nm at 240 °C and 5.1 ± 1.2 nm at 300 °C. Photoelectrochemical studies on CZTS nanoparticles mobilized on ITO substrates showed behaviour similar to p-type semiconductors.
Recently, Guo et al., constructed solar cell with conversion efficiency of 7.2% using nanoparticles of CZTS.72 The improvement in solar energy conversion efficiency may be due to tuning the elemental composition of CZTS nanoparticles to developing the robust film coating method. The fabricated device after light soaking for 15 min showed 430 mV open circuit voltage, 31.2 mA cm−2 current density and 53.9% fill factor. Lu et al., reported another interesting method for the synthesis of CZTS nanocrystals in which the metal chlorides of copper, zinc and tin were reacted with dodecanethiol at 120 °C to form thiolate complexes.73 These complexes were injected into hot coordinating solvent such as 1-dodecanethiol, oleylamine or oleic acid at 240 °C, the mixture was maintained for 1 h to complete growth of the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles isolated by this method were wurtzitic hexagonal crystallites (Fig. 13). It has been observed that the thiolate complexes help to balance the different reactivities of cations in solution. Dodecanethiol coordinate with metal cations exposed on the surface of nanocrystals and hence assists to passivate wurtzite CZTS. The use of dodecanethiol can play a crucial role in defining the growth of wurtzite or kesterite/stannite phase of the nanocrystals. TEM analysis showed that the synthesis with oleylamine gave nanoprisms (20 nm by 28 nm) whilst oleic acid gave nanoplates with thickness of 14 nm. The elemental composition determined by EDX analysis showed an average Cu/Zn/Sn/S ratio of ca. 2:1:1:4. The optical measurements showed the particles have a 1.4 eV bandgap. The resistivity measurement showed the oleylamine capped particles has 0.838 Ωm while oleic acid capped particles has 5.740 Ωm.

Cao et al., experimented with a solvothermal method, in their experimental method appropriate amounts of CuCl2, Zn(OAc)2, SnCl4 and elemental sulfur were sealed in a Teflon liner with stainless steel autoclave along with 20 mL of ethelenediamine. The apparatus was kept at 180 °C for 15 h and allowed to cool to room temperature. P-XRD pattern of the as synthesised particles showed the hexagonal phase the hexagonal phase was diminished after annealing at 550 °C under Ar/H2S (5%) atmosphere. TEM and HRTEM analysis showed the 5–10 nm sized particles with lattice spacing of 0.31 nm corresponding (112) plane. EDX analysis on particles isolated in this method confirmed the elemental composition of 24:12:15:49 for Cu:Zn:Sn:S with slight tin rich and sulfur poor.74 Riha et al., have constructed a photoelectrochemical cell using nanoparticles synthesized by their earlier method.68 The nanoparticles were dip coated onto a fluorine doped tin oxide substrates and further they were immersed in a Eu3+ containing redox electrolyte after ligand exchange with ethylenediamine. The measured incident photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) showed efficiency of 1.8% from a cell constructed using stoichiometric controlled particles and 3.1% for Zn-rich particles. The cell efficiency was greatly enhanced after annealing at 350 °C which showed 2.8% for stoichiometric controlled particles, 10.1% for Zn-rich particles.75
Recently, a facile synthesis method was described by Wang et al., metal salts of CuCl2·2H2O, Zn(OAc)2·H2O, SnCl2·2H2O were added into 30 mL of triethylene glycol (TEG). The mixture was degassed under Ar atmosphere for 30 min at 140 °C, followed by heating to 220 °C.76 In another vessel sulfur powder was loaded with 2 mL of octadecene (ODE) with 500 mg of octadecylamine (ODA). This sulfur solution was injected into the metal solutions at 220 °C and held there for 1 h. Black ODE and transparent TEG layers separated after completion of reaction. The average size of particles observed was 6.5 ± 1 nm by TEM analysis. The elemental compositions of the nanoparticles determined by EDX spectroscopy showed the ratio of 2.73:0.6:1.14:3.86 of Cu:Zn:Sn:S respectively.
The decomposition of ethylxanthate complexes of copper (Cu(ex)2), zinc (Zn(ex)2) and SnCl2 was carried out in oleylamine at 280 °C. The isolated particles were nearly spherical in shape with average size of 15.6 ± 2 nm. EDX analysis showed a copper poor and zinc rich composition with elemental ratio of 1.81:1.17:0.95:4.07 for Cu:Zn:Sn:S. The synthesised particles were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and TG-DTA. The optical measurements on these particles showed the expected bandgap of 1.5 eV.77 Yet another route has been introduced for the synthesis of CZTS nanoparticles by Zaberca et al.78 In their method CuCl2·2H2O, ZnCl2·6H2O, SnCl4·5H2O, thiourea and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMaOH) were transferred into a teflon-line stainless steel autoclave and allowed to react for 16 h at 200 °C. Isolated particles are in random shape ca. 250 nm size were obtained. The particles were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR and powder X-ray diffraction. These solvothermal methods were repeated by Zhou et al., using the same metal sources but with polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP) at 230 °C for 24 h.79 The particles were 100–150 nm and almost spherical. Nanoparticles of Cu2ZnGeS4 and Cu2Zn(Sn1-xGex)S4 were synthesized by Ford et al.80 The particles were prepared following an earlier method reported by them.72 Nanoparticles were coated on molybdenum substrates and then selenized to form Cu2Zn(Sn1-xGex)(S,Se)4. Solar cell device constructed using these particles showed a power conversion efficiency of 0.51% from Cu2ZnGeS4 and 6.8% from Cu2Zn(SnxGe1-x)S4 nanoparticles with Ge/(Ge+Sn) stoichiometric ratio 0.7.
Recently, nanowires of CZTS has been prepared in an anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) template.81 AAO templates were immersed in the precursor solution and then the solution was transferred to stainless steel Teflon-lined auto clave after degassing. The auto clave was kept at 230 °C for 70 h, the precursors were 0.096 g of sulfur, 0.14 g of anhydrous CuCl, 0.14 g of SnCl2 and 0.10 g of ZnCl2 in 16 mL of anhydrous ethylenediamine. SEM images in Fig. 14 shows nanowires of several micrometer length and ∼200 nm diameter which is consistent with pore size of template. The bandgap of the nanowires showed as 1.5 eV and their elemental composition measured as 2.2/0.9/0.8/4.1 of Cu, Zn, Sn and S respectively.

In a novel approach to dye sensitized solar cells, Xin et al., constructed cells using CZTS nanoparticles coated on FTO glass plates as a counter electrode.82 Such cells showed a highest power conversion efficiency of 7.37% with open circuit voltage of 800 mV, short circuit current density of 17.7% and fill factor of 52.2%. Nanoparticles of CZTS with diameter of 15 ± 6 nm were prepared by following the procedure reported by Guo et al.67 180 nm thick CZTS films prepared by spin-coating and 2.3 μm thick films obtained from drop-casting. Both films were sintered at 540 °C for 1 h in selenium vapour. N719 ruthenium–based dyes, 16 μm thick TiO2 nanoparticle layer on FTO and ionic liquid electrolyte (ES-004) were used in the solar cell construction.
Riha et al. synthesised nanoparticles of Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)4 by following their earlier method.68 In this method elemental S and Se with oleylamine and NaBH4 were injected into the reaction vessel containing copper(II)acetylacetonate, zinc(II) acetate, tin (IV) acetate and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) kept at 325 °C. The band gap of the synthesised particles decreased from 1.54 eV (Cu2ZnSnS4) to 1.47 eV (Cu2ZnSnSe4) on increasing selenium concentration. Expansion of the lattice parameter (c) 10.81 Å (Cu2ZnSnS4) to 11.28 Å (Cu2ZnSnSe4) was also observed on replacing smaller sulfur with bigger selenium atom.83
5. Conclusions
It is important to find alternate energy sources as fossil fuels will inevitably diminish in abundance over time. Interest in thin film based solar energy generation has been heightened in recent years as it may provide an opportunity for large scale energy generation. It is important to develop materials that are cheap, based on readily available elements and of readily manageable toxicity and environmental impact. Hence, Cu2ZnSnS4 (the CZTS system) is starting to be considered as a potential front runner for low-cost PV material. In some ways is may be seen as sitting in a niche that might displace the potential supply and expense limited CIGS system and the cadmium chalcogenide cell. The elements cadmium and indeed lead however remain of continued potential importance in PV because of their abundance, easy processability and consequence cheapness. The cheapest materials for PV would however undoubtedly be iron sulfides. There has been substantial improvement in conversion efficiency for the CZTS system reported in recent years with the highest efficiency of 10.1% from IBM team. We have reviewed the methods for the preparation of thin films and nanoparticles of CZTS. Many approaches have been used in attempts to improve energy conversion efficiency. Solar energy conversion efficiencies obtained so far by different methods are summarized in Table 1. There are many factors yet to be resolved in order to improve and optimize their performance and achieve higher closer to theoretical conversion efficiency. It is also a necessity to find the suitable experimental conditions for the stoichiometry and phase control, void free film growth and shape and size controlled in nanoparticles for the improvement of device performance. The challenge is daunting, but the opportunities are equally boundless and should interest many chemists.
