    , Accepted 28th May 2012First published on 28th May 2012AbstractIn this study, we demonstrate that Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals with a tunable bandgap could be synthesized by a “hot-injection” protocol. In this protocol, metal stearates dissolved in oleylamine were injected into a hot solution of anion precursors in 1-octadecene (ODE) at a given reaction temperature. ODE, which is a low-cost, low-hazard, and air-stable liquid, was used as the solvent. Oleylamine was chosen as both the reagent to activate the precursors and as the capping agent for the nanocrystals. The composition of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals could be adjusted across the x range from 0 to 1 by varying the S/Se reactant ratio. The lattice parameters (a and c) measured from X-ray diffraction patterns decreased linearly with increasing Se content. This trend was consistent with Vegard's law, which confirmed the formation of homogeneous Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals. The A1 symmetry modes of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals seen by Raman spectroscopy gradually shifted with decreasing x (S content) to the lower frequency side and completely disappeared when x = 0. The absorption spectra of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals revealed that the bandgaps of the nanocrystals could be adjusted over the range 1.0–1.5 eV by decreasing the S content. The relatively small value for the bowing parameter indicated that the synthesized Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals had good miscibility.
1. Introduction
The need to develop economically sustainable clean energy technologies is the foundation of the search for new materials for future generations of solar cells. Members of one group of materials, copper-based ternary and quaternary semiconductors, are particularly interesting because of their high absorption coefficients, optimal bandgap energy, good photostability, and demonstrated high photovoltaic efficiency. Chalcopyrite-type semiconductors like Cu(In,Ga)S2 and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 have very beneficial properties for photovoltaic applications, but because of a shortage in the supply of In and Ga, their costs are such that cost-effective, large-scale production cannot be realized. Recently, quaternary chalcogenides Cu2ZnSnX4 (X = S or Se) have attracted a great deal of attention for use in efficient light harvesting because of their high absorption coefficients (>10−4 cm−1) and direct bandgaps (Eg = 1.0 and 1.50 eV for Cu2ZnSnSe4 and Cu2ZnSnS4, respectively). In addition, their constituent elements exhibit low toxicity, are naturally abundant, and are relatively inexpensive. The crystalline structure of Cu2ZnSnX4 (X = S or Se) is similar to the chalcopyrite structure, indicating that its unit cells can be obtained from the chalcopyrite structure by substituting half of the indium atoms with zinc atoms and the other half with tin atoms. Significant progress has been reported on the preparation of Cu2ZnSnX4 (X = S or Se) based solar cells and on improving their efficiency using various methods such as various vacuum and non-vacuum based processes.1–7 Of particular interest are non-vacuum and solution-processed approaches because they are simplified and low-cost as well as high-throughput printing techniques that allow for the possibility of roll-to-roll device production.
To maximize power conversion efficiency, matching the bandgap control of light-harvesting materials to the preferred range of solar irradiation to ensure efficient light harvesting is crucial for solar cells. For example, a single-junction solar cell requires an optimum bandgap of 1.3 eV while a two-junction architecture may require optimum bandgaps of 1.9 and 1.0 eV for two types of light harvesting materials, respectively.8,9 Generally, colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals exhibit size-dependent quantum confinement effects with respect to the tuning of optical properties for individual nanocrystals. In contrast to the size-dependent properties of the pure quaternary phases of either Cu2ZnSnS4 or Cu2ZnSnSe4, the exploration of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 (ref. 10–12) quinary nanomaterials with tunable optical properties by changing their constituent stoichiometries as well as their internal structure makes it possible to tune the bandgap of these materials even at a constant size. This bandgap tuning appears to be beneficial in obtaining good photovoltaic performance. For example, Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 can be used to achieve 10.1% power conversion efficiency using a non-vacuum and hydrazine-based deposition process.12 Some successful approaches have been reported for the preparation of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanocrystals, by wet chemical methods including a “hot-injection” method,13–15 a “heating-up” method,16–20 a solvothermal method,21 and a continuous-flow process.22 However, to the best of our knowledge, little work23 on the synthesis of high-quality multicomponent Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals with a finely controlled composition and size distribution has been carried out. This could be due to the fact that in comparison to binary and ternary nanocrystals, it is difficult to determine the reactivity of each precursor, which should be compatible with those of other precursors. Moreover, the conditions necessary for the growth of one constituent should not impede that of other constituents. Generally, the different reactivities between S and Se precursors make it hard to generate desired nanocrystals with homogeneous structures.24 Riha et al.23 recently reported on the synthesis of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals with a tunable composition in the coordinating solvent tri-n-octylphosphine oxide. However, it is well known that phosphine solvents are hazardous, unstable, and expensive.25–27 For the sake of the environment, an increasing number of researchers are now integrating green chemistry principles into their synthetic methods, which indicates that not only are the final products greener but also that they minimize the quantity of hazardous starting materials that are employed in their manufacture.28,29
Herein, we report a facile, greener, and inexpensive method for synthesizing quinary Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals. Our method involves injecting mixed metal-stearate precursors into low-cost, low-hazard, and more air-stable non-coordinating solvents (ODE) containing oleylamine and anion sources. The composition of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals can be adjusted across the x range from 0 to 1 by modulating the S/Se reactant ratio. The as-prepared Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals possess good trends in their lattice parameter and bandgap variations when they are modulated by their x-values.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Zinc stearate (90%) was obtained from J.T. Baker. ODE (90%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Copper stearate (99%) was obtained from Chem Service. Tin stearate (98%) and oleylamine (80–90%) were purchased from Acros Organics. Thiourea (99%) and selenium (99%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar. All organic solvents were purchased from EM Sciences. All chemicals were used directly without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals
An injection solution of cation precursors was prepared by mixing copper stearate (0.2 mmol), tin stearate (0.1 mmol), and zinc stearate (0.1 mmol) in 2 mL of oleylamine at 145 °C for 1 h. Thiourea (1 mmol) and oleylamine (0.45 mmol) were mixed with 5 mL of ODE in a 50 mL three-neck flask with a Schlenk line attached to it. Different thiourea to selenium molar ratios (form 1:0 to 0:1) and total molar amount of 1 mmol were used for the preparation of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals with x values of 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0 composition. The mixture was degassed in a vacuum, purged three times with argon, and heated to 250 °C for 1 h. The resulting solution was subsequently heated to 270 °C. At this temperature, the solution of cation precursors was quickly injected into the reaction vessel under magnetic stirring and the color of the solution changed immediately from light yellow to dark brown, indicating that the nucleation and subsequent growth of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanostructures had occurred. After 1 h, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and the nanoparticles were precipitated by the addition of 5 mL of chloroform followed by 5 min of centrifugation at 6000 rpm. The precipitate was discarded and to extract the unreacted material, 5 mL methanol was added to the supernatant and the material was deposited at the bottom of the solution. This process was repeated twice. Subsequently, ethanol was added to the extracted solution and the mixture was then centrifuged (6000 rpm) for 20 min. Following this, the supernatant was removed. The precipitate that remained could be dispersed in organic solvents such as chloroform and toluene.
2.3. Characterization
Low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a Hitachi H7100 electron microscope operating at 100 kV. The high-resolution TEM images of the nanocrystals were examined by field-emission TEM on a Philips Tecnai G2 F20 microscope (Philips, Holland). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation was conducted using an SPM-9600 scanning probe microscope (Shimadzu Co.) at room temperature. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a JASCO V-670 spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed by using a Rigaku 18 kW rotating anode source X-ray diffractometer with the Cu Kα1 line (λ = 1.54 Å). Dynamic laser scattering (DLS) measurements were performed using a Malvern Nano-ZS 90. Raman spectra of the nanocrystals were recorded using a micro-Raman system (Uni-RAM system) and a diode laser at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm; the micro-Raman system and the diode laser were integrated by Protrustech Corp. Ltd. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by using a VG ESCA scientific theta probe spectrometer in constant analyzer energy mode with a pass energy of 28 eV and Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source.
3. Results and discussion
In our synthesis strategy, Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals were synthesized by a modified “hot-injection” protocol in which we injected metal stearates dissolved in oleylamine into a hot solution of anion precursors in ODE at a given reaction temperature. In a quinary system, five elements are involved in the reaction. Thus, the reaction activity of the reagents related to the five elements should be considered. If the reaction activities of the anion and the cation precursors differ from each other, a separated nucleus will be generated and grow into heterostructures or even two compounds. Thus, thiourea and elemental selenium were used as anion sources and metal stearates were chosen as cation sources. ODE, which is a low-cost, low-hazard, and air-stable liquid at room temperature, and boils at about 320 °C, was used as the solvent whereby we dissolved thiourea and elemental selenium into it. Oleylamine was chosen as both the reagent to activate the precursors and the capping agent for the nanocrystals. In a typical reaction, the color of the solution changes immediately from light yellow to dark brown after the mixture of metal stearates has been injected at 270 °C, indicating that the nucleation and subsequent growth of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanostructures have occurred.
TEM investigations were performed to monitor the formation of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 1a and c, Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 at x = 1 and 0 were monodispersed and quasi-spherical nanoparticles. A high-resolution TEM image of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 for x = 1 nanocrystals (the inset in Fig. 1a) showed the presence of spherical-like crystalline particles. The distance between two adjacent planes was 0.315 nm, which corresponded to the (112) lattice plane of Cu2ZnSnS4. Fig. 1b shows three-dimensional and two-dimensional renderings of topographic images obtained by AFM of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 in the form of x = 1 nanocrystals on mica substrates. Line profiles (the bottom layer in Fig. 1b) show the height of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 for x = 1 nanocrystals as being ∼11 nm. The inset in Fig. 1c shows a high resolution TEM image of a typical Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 for x = 0, having high crystallinity and well-defined faceting within the nanocrystals. The average nanocrystal lattice spacing of 0.331 nm corresponded to the (112) lattice plane of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (JCPDS no. 52-0868). Fig. 1d depicts three-dimensional and two-dimensional renderings of topographic images obtained by AFM of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 in the form of x = 0 nanocrystals on mica substrates. Line profiles (the bottom layer in Fig. 1b) show the height of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 at x = 0 nanocrystals as being ∼13 nm. Fig. 2 depicts the as-synthesized Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 in the form of x = 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3 nanoparticles. Typically, all of these nanocrystals remained spherical in shape and retained their monodispersity. A high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2) of representative Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 as x = 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3 nanoparticles revealed well-resolved lattice fringes, demonstrating the highly crystalline nature of the as-prepared nanocrystals.

The quaternary I2–II–IV–VI4 (I = Cu, Ag; II = Zn, Cd; IV = Si, Ge, Sn; VI = S, Se) structure typically crystallizes as kesterite-type (space group I) and stannite-type (space group I2m) structures.30 These two crystal phases are quite similar and have eight atoms per primitive cell with a body-centered tetragonal symmetry. In addition, they differ only in the ordering of their cation sublattices. Kesterite22,31 Cu2ZnSnS4 has two tetragonal structural units ([Cu2S] and [SnZnS4]). Inside this, each sulfur anion is bonded to four cations and each cation is bonded to four sulfur anions, as shown in Fig. 3a. The Cu, Zn, and Sn atoms occupy half of the tetrahedral interstitial sites within the S sublattice with compositional order.16 Cu2ZnSnSe4 is one of the I2–II–IV–VI4 semiconductors that conforms to a stannite-type structure. The stannite-type structure has an alternately ordered array of Cu and (Zn, Sn) layers, indicating that one layer consists of Cu atoms only and that the other layer consists of Zn and Sn atoms, as shown in Fig. 3b.32,33 To acquire the crystalline structure of multicomponent Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals, XRD is the most convenient and effective tool to use. The XRD patterns in Fig. 4a reveal that all the diffraction peaks could be well indexed to the kesterite structure (JCPDS: 26-0575) and stannite structure (JCPDS: 52-0868) at x = 1 and at x = 0, respectively. The peak positions of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 at x = 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3 were located in the region between Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4. The (112) diffraction peaks showed a systematic shift to lower 2θ degrees with decreasing S content in the samples, which may have ruled out the phase separation or separated nucleation of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanostructures. The shift in the diffraction peaks is attributed to the incorporation of Se2+ ions with larger ionic radii than S2+ ions in the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 lattice. This resulted in an increasing lattice constant and hence peak shift toward a smaller diffraction angle. Since the lattice constants depend on the composition of the material, the composition x of these Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals could be determined by using the a- and c-axis lattice constants calculated from the XRD data and employing Vegard's law. Vegard's law empirically relates the substitution of a guest ion into the host lattice and stipulates that the lattice constant (a and c) changes linearly with composition due to the increasing defect ion concentration. This relationship can be written as ax = aCZTSe + (aCZTS − aCZTSe)x, where aCZTSe, aCZTS, and ax are a-axis lattice constants of Cu2ZnSnSe4, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4, respectively. Also, cx = cCZTSe + (cCZTS − cCZTSe)x, where cCZTSe, cCZTS, and cx are c-axis lattice constants of Cu2ZnSnSe4, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b and c, the lattice parameters (a and c) of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals exhibited a linear relationship with the S composition, which is in agreement with Vegard's law. The results indicate that we successfully synthesized Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals with modulated and uniform composition covering the full range from Cu2ZnSnS4 to Cu2ZnSnSe4.

Raman spectroscopy was further utilized for phase identification. The results of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals with x values of 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0 composition are shown in Fig. 5. The most intense peaks were at about 193 cm−1 and 338 cm−1 at x = 0 and 1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5. These peaks correspond to the main vibrational A1 symmetry modes from Cu2ZnSnSe4 and Cu2ZnSnS4, respectively.34 The A1 symmetry modes are pure anion modes that are attributed to vibrations of sulfur and selenium atoms surrounded by motionless neighboring atoms.35,36 The wide peak at 231 cm−1 at x = 0 was identified in B and/or E symmetry mode, as previously reported for Cu2ZnSnSe4.36 The notable broadening of the Raman peak has been seen previously for nanocrystals and is due to phonon confinement within the nanocrystal.37,38 The A1 symmetry modes (338 cm−1) in Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals at x = 1 gradually shifted with decreasing x (S content) to the lower frequency side and completely disappeared when x = 0. A wide peak located at about 193–234 cm−1 appeared when x < 1 and the relative intensity became more pronounced with decreasing x. This result is attributed to S gradually being replaced by Se in Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals. The Raman peaks of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals broaden with increasing Se content, giving the largest peak widths for Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 in the form of x = 0.5 nanocrystals. This result is consistent with a previous report35 on Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 monograins, in which disorder in the structure increased due to the random distribution of S and Se atoms in the lattice, which gave rise to fluctuations in the masses and force constants in the their vicinity.

The compositional effects on the bandgap variation of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 were examined by using the absorption spectra. The optical bandgaps of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals can be estimated by the related curve (αhυ)2versus photon energy (α = absorbance, h = Planck's constant, and υ = frequency) by using the intersection of the extrapolated linear portion of the curve.39–41 The bandgap was observed to increase with increasing S content in the synthesis precursors (Fig. 6). As expected, the bandgap of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals was continuously adjustable from 1.5 eV for pure Cu2ZnSnS4 to 1.0 eV for pure Cu2ZnSnSe4, which covers the optimal bandgap of 1.3 eV for a single-junction solar cell.8 To further investigate the evolution of the bandgap with the composition of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals, the bandgaps of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals were fitted with an exponential function using the following band-structure theory denoted in eqn (1):42 Eg(x) = EgCu2ZnSnSe4 + (EgCu2ZnSnSe4 − EgCu2ZnSnSe4 − b)x + bx2(1)Here, EgCu2ZnSnSe4 and EgCu2ZnSnSe4 are the bandgaps of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4, respectively, x is the mole fraction of Cu2ZnSnS4, and b is the bowing parameter that provides information on variation in the non-linearity. This variation is the result of several concurrent effects, including (i) band-structure variations resulting from the alternating lattice constant, (ii) electron distribution deformation resulting from the difference in electronegativity among the atoms, and (iii) differently sized constituents resulting from the internal structural relaxation of the anion–cation bond lengths and angles.43–45 In our case, the best fitting curve yielded b = 0.1 eV. The relatively small bowing parameter indicated that the synthesized Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals had good miscibility. The compositions of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals were determined with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The representative spectra can be found in the ESI (Fig. S1†). Table 1 lists the quantitative analysis of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanoparticles prepared with x values of 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0 composition. It can be seen that the atomic percentages of the nanoparticles measured from EDX are composition tunable and consistent with the theoretical formula.

XPS was performed to examine the chemical state of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 at x = 0.7 as an example of the as-prepared nanocrystals (Fig. 7). The Cu(I) 2p core splits into 2p3/2 (933.1 eV) and 2p1/2 (952.9 eV) peaks, which is consistent with the standard separation of 19.8 eV (ref. 46). In addition, the Cu 2p3/2 satellite peak of Cu(II), which is usually located at 942 eV (ref. 47), does not appear in the spectrum. Therefore, it can be concluded that only monovalent copper exists in the sample. The peaks of Zn 2p appear at binding energies of 1021.1 and 1044.5 eV, which can be assigned to Zn(II) with a peak splitting of 23.4 eV (ref. 48). The Sn(IV) is confirmed by a peak splitting of 8.7 eV of two peaks located at 485.5 and 494.2 eV, respectively. The binding energies of S 2p can be assigned to 161.6 eV. The Se 3d peak at 54.4 eV and the Se 3p core located at 166.8 eV, which are in good accordance with values reported previously, were assigned to Se 3p1/2.41,46

As mentioned above, the creation of nanostructured suspension ink for use in a scalable coating process is a key step in the development of low-cost thin-film solar cells. A major requirement for a successful application of light harvesting nanocrystals in non-vacuum solution-processed approaches in photovoltaic applications is to possess good colloidal stability during long-term storage. DLS was used to estimate the size distribution and colloidal stability of the as-prepared nanoparticle suspensions. Fig. 8a shows the presence of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 for x = 1 nanocrystals with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 20 ± 2 nm, which was much larger than the particle size depicted in the TEM image. This result is attributed to the oleylamine capping ligands surrounding the nanocrystal surface in solution. Fig. 8b shows the time-dependent profile of the hydrodynamic diameter of the nanocrystals. The hydrodynamic diameter varied by less than 15% during the 192 h of storage over which it was evaluated, indicating its colloidal stability in solution and making it possible to capitalize on low-cost solution-based fabrication techniques for photovoltaic applications.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we developed multicomponent Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals with a tunable bandgap via a greener approach in a non-coordinating solvent (ODE) in the presence of oleylamine capping agents. The composition of the tunable Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals was set by modulating the molar ratio of thiourea to elemental selenium in the mixture. From TEM analysis, Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals were monodispersed and quasi-spherical nanoparticles had diameters of 11–13 nm. The lattice parameters (a and c-axis) and bandgaps of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals were consistent with Vegard's law, which confirmed the formation of homogeneous nanocrystals. Raman spectra of the Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals revealed that A1 symmetry modes were modulated by the x-values. The colloidal Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 nanocrystals exhibited excellent solution processability, making it possible to capitalize on low-cost solution-based fabrication techniques for use in photovoltaic or photocatalyst applications. We expect that this greener method can be extended to synthesizing high-quality multicomponent nanocrystals such as I2–II–IV–VI4 (I = Cu, Ag; II = Zn, Cd; IV = Si, Ge, Sn; VI = S, Se) and I–III–VI2 (I = Cu, Ag; III = Al, In, Ga; VI = S, Se).
