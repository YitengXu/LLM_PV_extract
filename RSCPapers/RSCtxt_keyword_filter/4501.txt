    , Accepted 6th April 2022First published on 7th April 2022Abstract2,2′-Bipyridine based bisphosphine [C5H3N{N(H)CH2PPh2}]2 (1) and its bischalcogenide derivatives [C5H3N{N(H)CH2P(E)Ph2}]2 (2, E = O; 3, E = S; 4, E = Se) were synthesized, and further reacted with BF3·Et2O/Et3N to form doubly B ← N fused compounds [C5H3N(BF2){NCH2P(E)Ph2}]2 (5, E = O; 6, E = S; 7, E = Se) in excellent yields. The influence of the PE bonds on the electronic properties of the doubly B ← N fused systems and their structural features were investigated in detail, supported by extensive experimental and computational studies. Compound 6 exhibited a very high quantum yield of ϕ = 0.56 in CH2Cl2, whereas compound 7 showed a least quantum yield of ϕ = 0.003 in acetonitrile. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the LUMO/HOMO of compounds 5–7 mostly delocalized over the entire π-conjugated frameworks. The involvement of PE bonds in the HOMO energy level of these compounds follows the order: PO < PS < PSe. Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments of compounds 5–7 revealed the singlet lifetime of 4.26 ns for 6, followed by 4.03 ns for 5 and a lowest value of 2.18 ns (τ1) and 0.47 ns (τ2) with a double decay profile for 7. Our findings provide important strategies for the design of highly effective B ← N bridged compounds and tuning their photophysical properties by oxidizing phosphorus with different chalcogens. Compounds 5 and 6 have been employed as green emitters (λem = 515 nm) in fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). For compound 5, doped into the poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) matrix with 5 wt% doping concentration, nearly 90 Cd m−2 luminance with 0.022% external quantum efficiency (EQE) was achieved. The best performance was observed for compound 6 doped into PVK by 1 wt% having a maximum luminance of 350 Cd m−2 and a similar EQE value.
Introduction
Molecules with extended π-conjugation have drawn considerable attention in the last two decades because of their intriguing optical and electronic properties,1–3 and also their wide applications in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), polymer solar cells (PSCs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).4–11 The incorporation of heteroatoms such as boron, nitrogen and phosphorus assists in fine tuning the optical and electronic properties of natural π-conjugated materials.12–16 Interestingly, the B ← N and C–C units are isoelectronic and isosteric.17,18 The C–C bond is a non-polar covalent bond with a bond dissociation energy of 90.1 kcal mol−1 (for H3C–CH3), whereas the B ← N bond is actually a coordinate bond with a dipole of 5.2 D and a bond dissociation energy of 27.2 kcal mol−1 (for H3B ← NH3).5,19 Implanting electron-deficient boron atoms or substituting one or more C–C bonds with B ← N units can: (i) alter the acceptor character because of low lying LUMOs, (ii) cause a red-shift in IR region absorptions and emissions, (iii) induce thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), and (iv) cause an improvement in charge carrier mobilities.20–28 Alternatively, the incorporation of an intramolecular B ← N bridge between an N-heteroarene and a boryl group is an excellent strategy to manipulate the molecular geometries and also optoelectronic properties.29–35 The symmetric and highly fluorescent BF2 appended organic dye, bis(difluoroboron)-1,2-bis((1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methylene)hydrazine (BOPHY), reported by Ziegler and co-workers has shown excellent photophysical properties, including high fluorescence quantum yields, high molar extinction coefficients, tunable absorption/emission properties and photostability.36 Furthermore, BOPHY dyes exhibit larger Stokes shifts and higher solid-state fluorescence than traditional BODIPY dyes, which mostly suffer from small Stokes shifts37,38 and relatively weak solid-state fluorescence. Since then, a library of doubly BF2 appended fluorescent dyes such as BOPPY,39 BOAPY,40 and BOPAHY41 were synthesized and their photophysical properties were extensively studied.
In the last few decades, heavier congeners such as Al,42 Ga,43 and In44 along with group 14 elements45,46 have been employed to coordinate various N-based ligand frameworks. In contrast, research on the incorporation of phosphorus into organic π-conjugated molecules especially N-based ligands is less extensive.47–49 Interestingly, oxidation of phosphines to form phosphoryl moieties generates a hypervalent environment, which increases the comparative electronegativity of the phosphorus centre and reverses its character to an electron acceptor. The enhanced electronegativity at the P-center generates an inductively withdrawing substituent which can lower the energy of Frontier orbitals of a π-conjugated molecular framework. This method is used effectively in phosphorescent OLEDs for which a number of phosphoryl appended electron-acceptor species have been synthesized.50,51 Hatakeyama and co-workers reported a series of phosphorus-centered 4,8,12-triazatriangulene derivatives and their oxidized derivatives.52 Phosphine-oxide derivatives exhibited strong blue and cyan fluorescence with a high fluorescence quantum yield of ϕ = 0.83. Stalke and co-workers reported three positional isomers of a thiophosphoranyl anthracene that revealed solid-state fluorescence in three different colours with differences in emission wavelengths of over 100 nm.53 It is well understood that the optoelectronic properties of carbon-based π-conjugated frameworks can be enhanced through the implementation of other main-group elements, such as nitrogen, boron, oxygen, phosphorus or sulfur.53–56 The HOMO/LUMO energy gap of many boron or phosphorus containing aromatic π-conjugated compounds resides in the ideal range to produce effective emission in the visible region and hence they are potential candidates in organic electronics.
In 2016, Dou et al. reported a doubly B ← N bridged bipyridyl (BNBP) electron-deficient building block for polymer electron acceptors in all-polymer solar cells.57 This polymer based BNBP unit exhibited high electron mobility, low-lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels, strong absorbance in the visible region and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.38% for polymer solar cell (PSC) devices. In this context, we sought to investigate the effect of phosphine-chalcogenide functionalities on doubly B ← N fused π-conjugated BNBP molecules and assess their structural features and optoelectronic properties. Furthermore, we investigated three air stable phosphine appended and B ← N fused compounds (5–7) which are well characterized by spectroscopic methods and single crystal X-ray analysis. We found that the steric and electronic effects of phosphorus-chalcogen bonds have a significant influence on the extent of structural distortion, photophysical and electrochemical properties and HOMO/LUMO energy levels. After a careful screening of the photophysical and electrochemical properties of compounds 5–7, we found compounds 5 and 6 to be ideal candidates for OLED studies. Thus, we looked into the performance of compounds 5 and 6 as components in the electroluminescent layer of OLED devices and observed only moderate external quantum efficiency.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of compounds 1–7
3,3′-Diamino-2,2′-bipyridine was prepared by a three-step synthesis starting from 2-chloro-3-aminopyridine according to the literature reported procedures.58,59 The reaction of 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine with two equiv. of Ph2PCH2OH, generated in situ by heating a mixture of paraformaldehyde and diphenylphosphine, resulted in the formation of new bisphosphine [C5H3N{N(H)CH2PPh2}]2 (1) (Scheme 1), which was found to be highly air stable and soluble in most of the organic solvents. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum showed a sharp singlet at −19.7 ppm.60–62 In the 1H NMR spectrum, the N–H proton appeared as a triplet of doublets at 10.29 ppm (3JH–H = 5.7 Hz, 3JP–H = 3.2 Hz) and the –CH2 protons showed a doublet of doublets at 3.95 ppm with 2JP–H and 3JH–H couplings of 5.7 and 4.4 Hz, respectively. In the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum, –CH2 appeared as a doublet at 42.93 ppm with a 1JC–P coupling of 12.6 Hz. HRMS (high resolution mass spectrometry) showed a molecular ion peak at 605.1986 corresponding to [M + Na+] (calcd 605.1994).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of bisphosphine 1 and its chalcogenide derivatives 2–4. 
The bischalcogenide derivatives [C5H3N{N(H)CH2P(E)Ph2}]2 (2, E = O; 3, E = S; 4, E = Se) were synthesized by treating 1 with H2O2 in THF, elemental sulphur and gray selenium using a solid state mechanochemical method in a rotatory ball mill (Scheme 1). For the synthesis of bissulfide and bisselenide derivatives of 1, bisphosphine was mixed with stoichiometric amounts of elemental sulfur or selenium in a jar and rotated in the rotator ball mill for 4 h at a frequency of 450 rpm (∼26 Hz).63 The 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 2–4 showed single resonances at 29.7, 39.2 and 29.6 ppm, respectively, with bisselenide (4) showing characteristic satellite peaks with a 1JP–Se coupling of 731 Hz. The influence of the oxidation of phosphorus on the proton and carbon chemical shifts in their respective 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra indicates the electronic influence of the same (see the ESI‡).
As a major aspect of our proceedings with endeavours to recognize the impact of B ← N functionalization on the structural features and electronic properties of different chalcogenide derivatives of bisphosphine 1, we attempted to incorporate B ← N functionalities. Bischalcogenides 2–4 upon treatment with BF3·Et2O/Et3N yielded highly air and moisture stable doubly B ← N fused compounds [C5H3N(BF2){NCH2P(E)Ph2}]2 (5, E = O; 6, E = S; 7, E = Se) (Scheme 2). The formation of these compounds was initially confirmed by various NMR spectroscopic (1H, 31P{1H}, 13C{1H}, 11B{1H} and 19F NMR) and HRMS data, which are in good agreement with the proposed structures. In the 31P{1H} NMR spectra of compounds 5–7, sharp singlets were observed at 31.6, 39.8 and 29.2 ppm, respectively, which showed no substantial changes in δP values compared to parent bischalcogenides. The 11B NMR signals at −0.81 ppm (5), −0.83 ppm (6), and −0.82 ppm (7) were slightly shielded compared to free BF3·Et2O (0.26 ppm) indicating stronger B ← N interactions. Surprisingly, in the 1H NMR spectra of 5–7, the chemical shifts due to bipyridine protons (which appeared around 6.9 to 7.1 ppm in their bischalcogenides) were considerably deshielded (∼7.5 to 8.5 ppm) in all cases.

Single crystal structural analysis of compounds 1–7
The molecular structure of 1 is depicted in Fig. 1 and the structural data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI).‡ The X-ray crystallographic analysis discloses a planar geometry of the ligand framework with an asymmetric unit comprising half the molecule. As expected, the geometry around the phosphorus atom in 1 is distorted pyramidal.60,62 In addition, the C–C bond between the two pyridine units (1.486(3) Å) in 1 is quite shorter than that in bipyridine based bisguanidines (1.500(3) Å),58 but comparable with the same in 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine (1.485(2) Å).59 The intramolecular N⋯H interactions are also observed between the H of N–H and N of another pyridine moiety with a distance of 1.967 Å, which is quite larger than that observed in 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine (1.948 Å).59 In the crystal packing, a staircase arrangement is observed between the two adjacent layers with the mean plane distance of 3.612 Å (ESI, Fig. S1‡). The layers are stacked along with C–H⋯π(ring) interactions involving the aromatic proton of the phenyl ring from the PPh2 moiety either with the bipyridine ring or phenyl ring of another PPh2 moiety (ESI, Fig. S2‡).

The molecular structures of 2–4 are depicted in Fig. 1 and the crystallographic details are listed in Table S1.‡ The molecular structures of compounds 2–4 reveal that after the oxidation of phosphorus atoms in 1 the planarity of the bipyridine ring framework is lost. The C1–C6 bond distances between the two pyridine units in 2–4 are almost similar to that in 1 (ESI, Table S3‡). The average C–P bond distances between the methylene carbon and the phosphorus atom (2 1.814; 3 1.828 and 4 1.822 Å) are shorter than that of 1 (1.8502(17) Å), thus implying the electronic influence of chalcogenides after the oxidation of the phosphorus atom (ESI, Table S3‡). In comparison with bisphosphine 1, compounds 2–4 reveal different intramolecular N⋯H interactions between the H atom of the –(NH) group and the N atom of another pyridine moiety within the molecule, as listed in Table S3.‡ Even in the asymmetric units of compounds 3 and 4 different intramolecular N⋯H interactions are observed within the molecules. The mean planes N3–C2–C1–N1 and N4–C7–C6–N2 are deviated from each other with an angle of 13.41° for 2, 26.21° for 3 and 22.35° for 4 (ESI, Fig. S5, S8 and S11‡), which might be the most perceived actuality behind the existence of two particular intramolecular N⋯H interactions. In the crystal packing, compounds 2–4 exhibit numerous intermolecular interactions such as PE⋯H (E = O, S, Se) and N⋯H and C–H⋯π(ring) interactions, among which the C–H⋯π(ring) interaction plays a major role in the crystal packing of 3 and 4 (ESI, Fig. S3, S4, S7 and S10‡).
The molecular structures of compounds 5–7, [C5H3N(BF2){NCH2P(E)Ph2}]2 (5, E = O; 6, E = S; 7, E = Se) established by single crystal X-ray analysis are depicted in Fig. 2 and their structural data are summarized in Table S2.‡ The crystal structures of 5–7 reveal the presence of both phosphorus arms on the same side with respect to the planar bipyridyl framework and the entire bipyridyl moiety along with B ← N units being coplanar (Fig. 2), similar to previously reported doubly B ← N bridged compounds.57,64,65 The C–C bond distances between the two pyridine units in 5–7 [1.447(4) Å for 5, 1.450(3) Å for 6 and 1.458(9) Å for 7] are shorter than the same not only in the respective chalcogenide derivatives [1.490(3) Å for 2, 1.475(8) Å for 3 and 1.489(8) Å for 4] but also in 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine (1.485(2) Å),59 indicating more double bond character and hence better conjugation. The B–N covalent bond distances in compounds 5–7 are ranging from 1.498 Å to 1.517 Å, whereas the B–N coordination bond distances are in the range from 1.566 Å to 1.590 Å (Table 1). The mean planes N3–C2–C1–N1 and N4–C7–C6–N2 are deviated from each other with an angle of 21.95° for 5, 22.73° for 6 and 19.11° for 7 (ESI, Fig. S17‡). The shorter dihedral angle deviation for compound 7 compared to others might be due to the presence of more bulkier selenium atoms along with the phosphine arm on the same side of the molecule.

The crystal structures of 5–7 reveal the presence of intramolecular F⋯H interactions between F, and (i) the ortho-hydrogen atom from one of the pyridine rings, and the (ii) –CH2 group of the phosphine arm, with a distance of 2.360 to 2.434 Å and angles of 100° to 105°, which are very rare among the F2B ← N fused compounds (ESI, Fig. S18, S21 and Table S4‡). The consequences of intramolecular F⋯H interactions are also observed in proton NMR chemical shifts, as depicted in Fig. 3. In the 1H NMR spectra, the methylene protons of bischalcogenide derivatives 2–4 appeared, respectively, at 4.11, 4.27 and 4.39 ppm, whereas the same protons in the corresponding BF2 derivatives (5–7) were considerably deshielded and appeared at 4.59, 4.92 and 5.07 ppm, respectively. Similarly, the ortho-hydrogen atoms of the pyridine rings in 2–4 (2, 7.03, 6.94; 3, 6.97, 6.93 and 4, 6.95, 6.91 ppm) were found to be considerably deshielded after BF2 incorporation (5, 8.38, 7.56; 6, 8.33, 7.70 and 7, 8.27, 7.72 ppm). The large chemical shift differences suggest the presence of stronger intramolecular F⋯H interactions within the molecules. In the crystal packing, compounds 5–7 exhibit numerous intermolecular interactions such as PE⋯H (E = O, S, Se), F⋯H, B⋯H, C–H⋯π(ring) and π⋯π interactions, among which the F⋯H and B⋯H interactions play a major role in the crystal packing of compound 6 (ESI, Fig. S12–S16‡). The F⋯H and B⋯H intermolecular interactions observed in compound 6 are, respectively, in the range of 2.405 Å to 2.588 Å and 2.971 Å to 3.171 Å. In contrast, B⋯H interaction is less in compounds 5 and 7, but an additional Se⋯C and F⋯Carene interaction are noticed in 7 (ESI, Fig. S15‡).
 Fig. 3  Comparison of the 1H NMR spectra of compounds 2–7; green boxes and blue arrows indicate the change in 1H NMR chemical shifts of the same proton without and with B ← N functionalization. 
When compound 6 dissolved in CH2Cl2 was stored in open air, a golden yellow shiny compound was formed. Surprisingly, subjecting compound 6 to high vacuum resulted in an original bright yellow solid. When both compounds were placed under UV light (at 365 nm), compound 6·CH2Cl2 showed solid state greenish yellow fluorescence, as depicted in Fig. S19.‡ Redissolving it in CH2Cl2 solution and the slow evaporation of the solvent furnished bright yellow single crystals of [C5H3N(BF2){NCH2P(S)Ph2}]2·(CH2Cl2) (6·CH2Cl2). The crystal structure of 6·CH2Cl2 reveals the change in the positions of two PS arms compared to 6 (Fig. 2). This is attributed to the presence of rare S⋯H interaction between the S atom and the H atom of the CH2Cl2 molecule, with a value of 2.896 Å (S2–H37A) and 2.975 Å (S1–H37B) (Fig. 2). This structural amendment merely impacts the B–N bond distances but shows a significant impact on the mean plane deviation (Δ = 25.13° for 6·CH2Cl2; Δ = 22.73° for 6) of 6·CH2Cl2 in comparison with that of compound 6, as summarized in Table 1.
Photophysical and electrochemical studies
Compounds 1–7 are thoroughly studied by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy in different organic solvents at room temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates the UV-vis absorption and emission spectra of compounds 1–4 in CH2Cl2 recorded at room temperature. Compounds 1–4, in all solvents, showed broad absorption bands with the maximum (λabs) around 400 nm corresponding to the π–π* transitions of the bipyridine ring, as depicted in Fig. 4 (see the ESI, Fig. S22 and S23‡) and listed in Table 2. In all solvents, compounds 1–4 showed very poor emission bands with the maximum (λem) around 435 nm, upon excitation at 365 nm, as depicted in Fig. 4 and Fig. S22, S23.‡

In all solvents, compounds 5–7 exhibited major lower energy absorption bands with the maximum (λabs) around 460 to 490 nm, as depicted in Fig. 5 and Table 3 (see the ESI, Fig. S24 and S25‡). The lower energy absorption bands of 5–7 are red-shifted by around 70 to 80 nm in contrast to those of 1–4 without the bridging units, indicating the influence of the B ← N bridging units on more π-electron delocalization over the framework. This observation is also consistent with the shorter C–C bonds between the two pyridyl rings observed in compounds 5–7 compared to their respective bischalcogenide derivatives (Table S3‡ and Table 1). Upon excitation at 400 nm, compounds 5–7 showed an intense emission band maximum (λem) around 520 nm, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3 (see ESI, Fig. S24 and S25‡). In contrast, compound 7 exhibited very poor emission presumably due to the fluorescence quenching by selenium. The fluorescence quantum yields were calculated with respect to the reference Coumarin 30. The reported relative quantum yields were determined using Coumarin 30 (ϕ = 0.35, excitation at 400 nm in 90% ethanol) upon excitation at 400 nm. Among compounds 5–7, 6 showed the highest quantum yields of 0.56, 0.46 and 0.41, respectively, in dichloromethane, chloroform and acetonitrile at room temperature (Table 3). Compound 7 showed a very low quantum yield in all solvents with the least in acetonitrile (ϕ = 0.003) at room temperature. These experimental observations were also verified by simply keeping the solutions of these compounds in small vials and exposing to both UV and visible light which resulted in the highest fluorescence for 6 and the lowest for 7 (ESI, Fig. S27‡).

In order to provide in-depth insight into the electronic structures of doubly B ← N fused compounds 5–7, DFT calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory by using the coordinates from the crystal structures. Based on the TD-DFT calculations, the main absorption bands of 5–7 at around 460 nm are attributed to the transitions from the HOMO to the LUMO, as depicted in Fig. 6 (see the ESI, Fig. S31 and Table S5‡). Density distribution patterns in these Frontier molecular orbitals, which appear to be almost similar in all the cases, reveal the delocalization of molecular orbitals over the entire π-conjugated frameworks. No clear trend was observed in the HOMO/LUMO energy gaps of these compounds (3.14 eV for 5, 3.16 eV for 6 and 2.93 eV for 7), but 7 showed the shortest gap. The significant electron density contribution of the phosphorus-chalcogen double bonds (PE, E = O, S, Se) in the HOMO energy levels drastically increased from 5 to 7, (PO < PS < PSe), as depicted in Fig. 6. In addition, relatively noteworthy electron densities are also observed on the C–P bond and C–H bond of the CH2 moiety (ESI; Fig. S29 and S30‡). The electron density contribution of the C–H bond is possibly due to the intramolecular F⋯H interactions. From the DFT studies, it is very clear that the B ← N coordinate bonds enhance the electron-deficient nature of the central framework in compounds 5–7.

The electrochemical properties of compounds 5–7 were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in CH2Cl2 using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte. A representative cyclic voltammogram along with its differential pulse voltammogram for 5–7 is shown in Fig. 7 and the relevant data for all compounds are included in Table 4. As shown in Fig. 7, all compounds exhibited one reversible and one irreversible reduction waves with peak potentials as depicted in Table 4. On the other hand, compounds 6 and 7 showed two irreversible oxidation potentials, whereas compound 5 showed only one irreversible oxidation potential, as shown in Fig. 7 and Table 4.

In the solid state emission spectra, compound 5 showed an emission band maximum at 520 nm (∼510 nm in solvents such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3etc.), whereas compound 6 showed an emission band maximum at 553 nm (∼520 nm in CH2Cl2, CHCl3etc.), as depicted in Fig. 8a. As expected, compound 7 showed a very low emission band maximum at 560 nm. Furthermore, time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments were carried out on compounds 5–7 by exciting the compounds at 440 nm and an emission was depicted at 510 nm. Compounds 5 and 6 exhibited a single exponential decay profile with excited state lifetimes of 4.03 and 4.26 ns, respectively (Fig. 8b). In contrast, compound 7 showed a double decay profile with lifetimes of 2.18 ns (τ1) and 0.47 ns (τ2) having contributions of 0.04 and 0.96, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 8b.

Electroluminescence study
Since compounds 5 and 6 exhibited excellent photophysical and luminescence properties along with strong green emission in the visible region, we were curious to examine their green emitting properties in fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). For the application of compounds 5 and 6 in OLEDs, poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) was used as the host polymer system. A higher energy bandgap (3.6 eV) of PVK than that of the compounds used enables efficient energy transfer from the host to the guest molecules by the Förster energy transfer mechanism as the emission from PVK overlaps with the absorption of the guest molecules significantly.66,67 The OLEDs were fabricated by optimizing the emissive layer thickness in regular architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TFB/PVK: emissive compound/Ca/Ag, where ITO acts as the anode, PEDOT:PSS as the hole injection layer, TFB as the hole transporting layer and Ca/Ag as the cathode. The electroluminescence (EL) appears in the green region of the spectrum peaking at ∼520 nm for both compounds 5 and 6 (Fig. 9a and 10a). The humps on the higher wavelength side of the EL spectra resemble those in the PL spectra. With increasing doping concentration, the EL spectra redshift as a result of the concentration quenching due to molecular stacking. Fig. 9b and 10b show the current–voltage–luminance characteristics of compounds 5 and 6. The maximum luminances of ∼300 Cd m−2 and ∼100 Cd m−2 were achieved for 1% doped compound 6 and 5% doped compound 5. OLEDs with 1% doping concentration had a maximum EQE of ∼0.02% and a current efficiency of ∼0.06Cd A−1 for both compounds (Table 5). As can be correlated with the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) measured in the solid-state, the films with a minimum doping concentration had the highest PLQY of ∼4% and 17% for compounds 5 and 6, respectively, although the PLQY reduced to ∼2% and 0.7% for those in pristine films (Table 5). The EQE roll-off with applied bias decreases possibly due to the improved charge carrier balance as the doping concentration of the guest molecules increases.

Conclusions
In summary, a new 2,2′-bipyridine bridged bisphosphine and its chalcogenide derivatives were synthesized and BF2 groups were incorporated to study their photophysical properties. Single crystal X-ray structures indicated that after the incorporation of B ← N bridges, the phosphine arms oriented on the same side probably to achieve the planarity with respect to the bipyridine ring. However, the structural distortions were observed as reflected in mean plane deviation and dislocation of the boron atoms from the bipyridine backbone, because of the tetrahedral geometry of the boron atom. The energies of HOMO were impacted by the PE bonds following the order: PO < PS < PSe. The chalcogen atoms on phosphorus have shown a notable influence on UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence quantum yield and singlet lifetime measurements. The PO and PS compounds showed a moderate external quantum efficiency in OLED applications. The X-ray structure of 6·CH2Cl2 showed PS⋯H interactions with hydrogen atoms of dichloromethane. The results have demonstrated how a co-crystallized solvent molecule through weak interactions affects the structural features and hence their photophysical properties. Efforts are underway in our laboratory to synthesize various transition metal complexes of 2,2′-bipyridine bridged bisphosphine, especially with coinage metals, to unveil their coordination behaviour and catalytic properties besides studying their interesting photophysical properties.
Experimental section
General procedures
All manipulations were performed under an inert atmosphere of dry nitrogen or argon, using standard Schlenk techniques. All the solvents used in this study were dried by conventional methods, and distilled before use. 3,3′-Diamino-2,2′-bipyridine (1) was prepared according to the published procedures.58 BF3·Et2O (46.5%) was purchased from Aldrich Chemicals and used without purification, and other reagents such as 30% H2O2, Et3N, elemental sulfur and gray selenium were obtained from commercial sources.
Instrumentation
The solution NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker FT spectrometers (Avance-400 or -500) MHz at ambient probe temperatures (298 K). 13C{1H} and 31P{1H} NMR spectra were acquired using a broad-band decoupling method. The spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solutions with CDCl3 as an internal lock; chemical shifts of 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra are reported in ppm downfield from TMS, using as an internal standard. The chemical shifts of 31P{1H} NMR spectra are referred to 85% H3PO4 as an external standard. Positive values indicate downfield shifts. Mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Maxis Impact LC-q-TOF Mass Spectrometer. Microanalyses were performed using a Elementar (Germany) Vario Micro cube CHNS Analyzer. The melting points of all compounds were determined on a Veego melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Absorption spectra were obtained with a CarySeries UV/Vis-NIR and UV 3600 Shimadzu spectrophotometer; and emission spectra were obtained with a Horiba Scientific Instrument/Fluoromax-4 Spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetric studies were carried out with a BAS electrochemical system utilizing a three-electrode configuration consisting of glassy carbon (working electrode), platinum wire (auxiliary electrode), and saturated calomel (reference electrode) electrodes. The experiments were performed in dry CH2Cl2 using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte. Half-wave potentials were measured using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and also calculated manually by taking the average of the cathodic and anodic peak potentials. All potentials were calibrated vs. a saturated calomel electrode by the addition of ferrocene as an internal standard, taking E1/2 (Fc/Fc+) = 0.42 V vs. the SCE. PLQY measurements for the thin films were performed on an integrating sphere.

Diphenyphosphine (1.20 g, 6.445 mmol) and paraformaldehyde (0.193 g, 6.445 mmol) were heated to 100 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere with stirring for 4 h to form a clear viscous liquid of PhPCH2OH. The liquid was allowed to cool to room temperature and a solution of 3,3′-diamino-2,2′-bipyridine (0.6 g, 3.222 mmol) in dichloromethane (75 mL) was added to it, and stirred for 2 days at room temperature. The resulting solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford a reddish-orange solid, which turned into a yellow precipitate upon addition of EtOH (30 mL). The resulting solution was filtered and the residue obtained was washed with additional EtOH (2 × 20 mL), and dried under reduced pressure to afford an analytically pure yellowish powdery solid of 1.

Synthesis of [C5H3N(BF2){NCH2P(Se)Ph2}]2 (7). 
A procedure similar to that of 6 was used, adding a solution of BF3·Et2O (1.81 mL, 6.751 mmol, 46% BF3·Et2O) to a solution of 4 (0.25 g, 0.337 mmol) and Et3N (0.47 mL, 3.375 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (35 mL). A reddish sticky compound obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc/petroleum ether = 40/60) to obtain an analytically pure product of 7 as a brown solid. Single-crystals of 7 suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by slow diffusion of petroleum ether into the dichloromethane solution of 7. Yield: 0.258 g (91%, 0.309 mmol).
