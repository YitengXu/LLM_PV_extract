    , Accepted 7th June 2021First published on 9th June 2021AbstractAnion exchange membranes (AEMs) with high permselectivity, chemical stability and mechanical robustness are a key enabling technology for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as fuel cells, redox flow batteries and water electrolyzers. Herein we examine well understood chemically stable triblock co-polymer AEMs derived by the chloromethylation (CM-) and subsequent trimethylamine (TMA) functionalization of polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) block co-polymers. We show using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) that the introduction of a hydrophobic reinforcement matrix disrupts phase segregation and decreases ionic domain sizes in these AEM separators. The reinforcement matrix simultaneously causes the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the reinforced separator to increase by almost 600% compared to the unreinforced form, while maintaining comparable elasticity (ca. 500% elongation at break). Such reinforced r-SEBS30-TMA separators enable electrode-decoupled redox flow batteries (ED-RFBs) with significantly improved lifetimes by decreasing per cycle capacity fade from 0.5% to <0.05%. This 10× improvement in operando permselectivity opens the door to ED-RFBs employing inexpensive elemental actives achieving decades-long usable lifespans.
Introduction
The increasing deployment of renewable energy sources and associated energy storage using batteries or H2/H2 carriers1 are compelling future routes towards a carbon-neutral energy ecosystem. The rapid adoption and deployment of renewable energy sources is increasingly an economical inevitability2 with the levelized costs of terrestrial solar and wind installations being much lower than conventional coal, nuclear or oil-based power plants. These developments require suitable energy storage solutions, and a promising solution is the use of redox-flow batteries (RFBs). Compared with other electricity energy storage systems such as rechargeable metal–air batteries and metal-ion batteries, RFBs have been demonstrated to have competitive features including low storage capacity cost, long battery lifetime, and high energy efficiency.3–5 Many RFB systems have drawn researchers' attention such as all-vanadium,6–9,46 all-uranium,10 and electrode-decoupled (ED-)RFBs (i.e. RFBs that use different redox couples at the anode and the cathode) such as iron–vanadium,11,12 vanadium–cerium,13–15 iron–chromium,16,17 zinc–nickel,18 zinc–cerium,19–21 and zinc–bromine.22,23 The introduction and assessment of these different RFB chemistries also introduces the issue of identifying comparison metrics to assess these systems. Yao et al. illustrates the various pitfalls in reporting RFB data and comparing different systems.45 A comprehensive program examining these various RFB chemistries in light of technical and techno-economic performance is needed to deploy commercially viable systems.
The all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is the most commercially mature system due to its long-life, mild operating temperature range24 and because the intermixing of the anolyte and catholyte results only in an easily remedied loss in capacity and energy efficiency in the VRFB.25 Nevertheless, VRFBs suffer from low standard cell voltage (1.26 V) and the oxidative degradation of hydrocarbon-based membrane separators caused by the vanadium(V) cation requires the use of fluorocarbon-based membranes as separators.
ED-RFBs use anion exchange membrane (AEM) separators (as opposed to cation exchange membranes used in the VRFB) to enable to use of different cationic redox couples at the anolyte and catholyte.14,26 The key factor that enables the high performance of the ED-RFB is to equip the ED-RFB with ion exchange separators with high permselectivity. The use of Nafion® or similar cation exchange membranes (CEMs) in these systems is impossible as these CEMs will allow the facile transfer of cations from one electrode to the other, thereby precluding us from realizing a true ED-RFB. As an example of the various approaches adopted to improve permselectivity, Li et al. drop casted a layer of Ketjen black carbon on both sides of Nafion® membrane for polysulfide-iodide RFB.27 Due to the large surface area of the Ketjen black carbon, both polysulfide and polyiodide ions were trapped during the charge–discharge cycle. As the charges accumulated in the carbon, the same anions were prevented from entering the membrane due to the electrostatic repelling effect. At the same time, the Ketjen black carbon added more electronic conductivity and less water uptake to the Nafion® membrane. Li et al. were able to operate the polysulfide-iodide RFB with modified Nafion® membrane for 1200 cycles (close to three months) while a maximum of 160 hours cycling was obtained for the same RFB with unmodified Nafion®. This work shows a novel approach to improve the permselectivity and prevent excessive water migration that helps to improve the battery performance.
In addition to high permselectivity, the development of mechanically and chemically robust AEMs is also imperative for enabling these systems.28 Amongst all the possible combinations of redox couples for ED-RFBs, the vanadium–cerium (V–Ce) ED-RFB has relative high cell voltage (the catholyte Ce4+/Ce3+ has a standard potential of 1.44 V vs. SHE compared with V5+/V4+ at 1 V vs. SHE), good reversibility and acceptable energy density.15,29 A schematic of a typical V–Ce ED-RFB is depicted in Fig. 1. Yun et al. developed cardo-polyetherketone based AEMs for such ED-RFBs and showed that it is possible to achieve separation of the redox active cations over extended periods of time.15 Employing the same AEM but by modifying the solvation shell around the redox active cations by using methanesulfonic acid as the supporting electrolyte, Sankarasubramanian et al. significantly reduced cation cross-over which enabled extended cycling of the V–Ce ED-RFB with no capacity fade.14 Moving to block co-polymers, Wang et al. developed polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene-based AEMs and employed them as separator in a V–Ce RFB.13 The separation of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains in these separators enable us to tailor the cross-over of the cationic redox active species by changing the ratio of the styrene block (site of the functional group and hydrophilic) to the other hydrophobic blocks.13 Over 20 charge/discharge cycles, the RFB with the polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene-based AEM separator with 30 wt% styrene (hereafter referred to as SEBS30) exhibited 10% capacity fade, while the loss in capacity rose to 15% for the same separator with 35 wt% styrene (SEBS35) and was about 40% for the benchmark Nafion® 212 separator.13 Therefore, one of the goals of this work is to significantly reduce the capacity fade per cycle from the previously exhibited 0.5% loss in capacity per cycle, which we deem to be unacceptably large for viable commercial application. Another common challenge faced by AEM separators for RFBs is mechanical stability. For example, cardo-polyetherketone-based AEMs exposed ex situ to 1.5 M VO2+ in 3 M H2SO4 at 30 °C for 60 days led to the ultimate tensile strength of the AEM degrading from 19 MPa to 9 MPa.6 Thus, a second objective of this study is to improve the AEM's mechanical durability.

The present study integrates a porous, mechanically robust reinforcement matrix made of extended polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) with the SEBS ionomer to impart its mechanical strength to the separator. The reinforcement matrix was found to disrupt phase-segregation of the SEBS block co-polymer as seen from small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and this effect significantly improved its permselectivity. The reinforced AEMs (r-SEBS-TMA) were prepared and utilized as separators for a V–Ce RFB and the performance of V–Ce ED-RFBs using r-SEBS30-TMA, SEBS30-TMA (30:70 molar ratio of styrene to rubber), and Nafion® 212 as the separator were compared. The r-SEBS-TMA separators were also found to be stable in acidic RFB electrolytes at 40 °C, ensuring that they can be deployed under practical operational conditions in RFBs. After 40 charge/discharge cycles, a V–Ce RFB with r-SEBS30-TMA as separator was able to maintain 98% of its initial capacity (0.05% capacity loss per cycle) with no loss in AEM separator mechanical strength.
Experimental
Materials
Chlorobenzene (99.5%), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (analytical standard), tin(IV) chloride (99.995%), chlorotrimethylsilane (99%), chloroform (99.5%), methanol (99.9%), paraformaldehyde (99.5%), silver nitrate (0.1 N), potassium thiocyanate (0.1 N), sodium nitrate (99%), chloroform-d (99.96%), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (99.7%), trimethylamine solution (31–35% weight percent in ethanol), sulfuric acid (99.999%), vanadium(IV) oxide sulfate (97%) and cerium(IV) sulfate (97%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. SEBS (Mn = 118000 g mol−1, 30:70 molar ratio of styrene to rubber) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Expanded PTFE (ePTFE) were purchased from Donaldson Company Inc. (properties listed in Table S1†) and the PTFE sheet to fabricate the non-porous base for separator preparation was obtained from McMaster-Carr.
Fabrication of reinforced AEMs (r-SEBS30-TMA)
The detailed method of synthesizing and characterizing chloromethylated SEBS (CMSEBS30) can be found in our previous reports.13,30 The 1H-NMR spectrum of CMSEBS30 is shown in Fig. S1.† The obtained CMSEBS30 has a degree of functionalization (DF) value of 0.20, which leads to a theoretical IEC of 1.68 mmol g−1. The method of impregnating CMSEBS30 and an illustration of chemical reactions for chloromethylation and functionalizing CMSEBS30 are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The base used to support the ePTFE reinforcement layer was made of PTFE. A hollow depression was machined into this sheet with a lip on all four edges with a height of 2 mm. The depression was partially filled with 10 mL of 5% CMSEBS30 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution, the ePTFE layer was laid on top of this layer and an additional 10 mL of the CMSEBS30 solution was cast on top. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene wets the ePTFE and hence the solution filled out the pores of the ePTFE as seen from the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. S2.† As a visual confirmation, the ePTFE substrate, which is normally opaque white, becomes clear when filled with polymer. Finally, the ePTFE reinforced membrane was dried at 60 °C on a hot plate and hot-pressed at 110 °C and 300 psi for five minutes to ensure surface uniformity. The reinforced, chloromethylated SEBS30 membrane was then functionalized with the TMA cation as detailed by us previously.13 The thickness of the SEBS30-TMA and r-SEBS30-TMA membranes are 72 μm and 50 μm, respectively.

Membrane characterization
The membrane characterization methods detailed below follow the procedures we have previously detailed.13

Ion exchange capacity (IEC). 
The IECs of membranes in chloride form (i.e. ion exchanged to ensure the mobile anions are Cl− ions) were determined by the argentometric Volhard titration method.31 A vacuum dried SEBS-based AEM in the chloride form (dried at <0.1 inHg at 60 °C for 12 hours) was weighed (about 0.1 g) and immersed in 20 mL of 1 M sodium nitrate for 48 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 5.0 mL of 0.1 M silver nitrate (an excess being added to ensure the complete precipitation of the chloride) was added to precipitate the chloride ions with a white silver chloride precipitate being observed if the membrane has any IEC. Quantification was carried out by titration with 0.1 M potassium thiocyanate (0.1 M KSCN, standard solution) using 2–3 drops of 11 wt% iron(III) nitrate in DI water as indicator with the end point being a color change from a light orange to a medium-dark orange color. A control sample was prepared by mixing 20 mL of 1 M NaNO3 with 5.0 mL of 0.1 M AgNO3 and 2–3 drops of 11 wt% of Fe(NO3)3 and titrated with 0.1 M KSCN. The difference in volume used to titrate the control solution and the sample solution was used for calculating the IEC (see eqn (1)): (1)where, IECCl− was the experimental ion-exchange capacity (mmol g−1); Volcont. was the volume of 0.1 M KSCN used to titrate the control sample (L); Voltest was the volume of 0.1 M KSCN used to titrate the sample (L); and Wtdry was the weight of the AEM (g).


Ionic conductivity. 
In-plane ionic conductivity measurements were carried out in a 4-point conductivity cell (BT-110, Scribner Associates) using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to measure the resistance. A 1 cm × 3 cm membrane was placed in the PTFE conductivity cell in contact with the 4 platinum electrodes and immersed in a temperature-controlled DI water bath. A Gamry series G750 potentiostat was used to measure the impedance in the frequency range 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The high frequency resistance was estimated from the Bode plots (corresponding to a phase angle of zero). The membrane conductivity was calculated using eqn (2): (2)where, σ was the in-plane membrane conductivity (mS cm−1); R was the in-plane membrane resistance (mOhm); t was the membrane thickness (fully hydrated) (cm); w was the membrane width (fully hydrated) (cm); L was the distance between the two inner electrodes (cm).


Mechanical properties. 
The tensile tests for r-SEBS30-TMA and SEBS30-TMA AEMs were performed using a Q800 differential mechanical analyzer (TA instruments) equipped with a humidity chamber. The membrane sample (approximate dimensions: 50 mm × 5 mm × 0.05 mm) was fixed in a film tension clamp using a torque of 3 lbF × in. The experiments were performed at 25 °C and 100% RH. The membrane was stretched at 0.5 MPa min−1 until the sample broke. The ultimate tensile strength and the elongation at the break point are reported in Table 1.

Ion permselectivity and transport numbers. 
Membrane permselectivity and transport numbers were measured using the membrane potential method in a lab-made diffusion cell. The AEM was clamped between two well-stirred compartments containing different concentrations of the same salt (0.1 M and 0.5 M KCl). Two identical calomel reference electrodes were used to measure the potential difference (Es (mV)) between the two solutions arising from the different mobilities of chloride and potassium ions through the membrane. The membrane potential was used to calculate the membrane permselectivity (selectivity of the anion exchange membrane towards anions) and the transport numbers (in this case for chloride and potassium). The following equation was used to calculate anion and cation transport numbers and membrane permselectivity: (3)where t+ and t− are the transport numbers for the cation (K+) and the anion (Cl−) respectively, aA and aB are the activities of the electrolyte (KCl) in the concentrated and diluted compartments separated by the membrane, T is the absolute temperature, R is the gas constant and F is the Faraday constant. The coefficient (2t− − 1) is commonly referred as the membrane permselectivity and represents the difference between the transport numbers for anions and cations.32


Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
The AEM separators were subject to cross-sectional SEM imaging (FEI Nova 230) to verify complete functionalization and (in case of r-SEBS-30-TMA) to verify that the pores of the ePTFE reinforcement matrix are filled with the ionomer. The SEM operational parameters were beam energy of 10 kV, chamber pressure of 9 × 10−3 Pa and chamber temperature of 23 °C. The cross-sectional AEM samples were obtained by sectioning the AEM samples following freezing dry samples in liquid N2. The samples, being poorly electrically conducting, were subject to Au sputter coating in a Leica ACE600 high vacuum sputter coater. The cross-sectional samples were subjected to energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) mapping for carbon (from the ionomer backbone and functional group), fluorine (from the ePTFE reinforcement) and chlorine (associated with the functional group).


Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 
Small angle X-ray scattering measurements were performed on a SAXSLAB GANESHA 300 XL SAXS system equipped with a GeniX 3D Cu Ultra Low Divergence micro focus sealed tube source. The wavelength λ was 1.54 Å. The detector used was hybrid pixel Dectris Pilatus 300K 2D CMOS photon counting detector. Silver behenate was used for calibration of the beam center and the q-range before measurement. The corrected SAXS patterns were azimuthally averaged to obtain one dimensional SAXS profiles. SAXSGUI v2.19 software was used to analyze the data.



Ex situ permeability test. 
The permeability of the membrane separator was tested ex situ using a 10 mL, water-jacketed PermeGear diffusion cell (shown in ESI Fig. S6†) at 40 °C. The temperature was maintained by constantly circulating water from a water bath into the out jacket of the diffusion cell. Samples were taken at the end of 30 days and the concentration of V on the Ce-side and Ce on the V-side was measured using inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).


Inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). 
The ICP-OES measurements were carried out using a PerkinElmer Optima 7300DV instrument. The instrument was calibrated with the appropriate PerkinElmer standards containing V and Ce. The standards were diluted using trace metals grade HNO3 and calibration curves with a linear fit regression coefficient of determination (R2) of at least 0.99 were obtained. The V measurements were carried out using a scandium internal standard. No internal standard was used for the determination of Ce concentration to avoid interference from the prominent lines of scandium.

Single-cell RFB testing
RFB experiments were carried out in an acid-resistant single cell with an active area of 25 cm2 (Scribner Inc.) whose schematic is depicted in Fig. 1. The RFB was assembled by sandwiching the r-SEBS30-TMA AEM (with a thickness chosen to be equivalent to SEBS30-TMA and Nafion® 212) between two graphite felt electrodes (SGL Carbon, Sigracell® GFA6) previously activated by heating in an oven at 400 °C for 30 hours.33,34 The electrolyte in the negative compartment (200 mL) contained 0.5 M V2+ in 1 M H2SO4. The positive compartment (200 mL) contained 0.5 M Ce4+ in 1 M H2SO4. The active redox species were V3+/V2+ in the negative electrode and Ce4+/Ce3+ in the positive electrode and their electrode reactions are as follows V3+ + e− ↔ V2+ (E0 = −0.26 V)(4) Ce4+ + e− ↔ Ce3+ (E0 = 1.61 V)(5)
A redox cell test system (model 857, Scribner Associates, Inc.) comprising a fluid control unit and a potentiostat with impedance spectroscopy capabilities was employed in the experiments. System control and data acquisition employed the Flow Cell software (Version 1.1, Scribner Associates, Inc.). The RFB was charged and discharged at a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2 at room temperature (approx. 21 °C). Both solutions were circulated through the electrodes using Cole-Parmer peristaltic pumps at a constant flow rate of 100 mL min−1. The RFB was considered charged once the cell voltage reached 2 V and discharged when the cell voltage dropped below 0.65 V (cutoff voltages).
The current efficiency (CE), voltage efficiency (VE) and energy efficiency (EE) were calculated using the following equations: CE = Qd/Qc × 100%(6) VE = Ed/Ec × 100%(7) EE = CE × VE × 100%(8)where Qd and Qc were the discharge and charge capacities (Ah L−1), and Ed and Ec were the average charge and discharge voltages respectively.
Results and discussion

Fig. 3(a) and (e) depict the SEM cross-section of SEBS30-TMA and reinforced SEBS-30-TMA (r-SEBS30-TMA) membranes. The distribution of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine across the cross-sectional area of SEBS30-TMA separators is depicted in Fig. 3(b)–(d). The separator's polymeric backbone and the functional group both contributed to the carbon signal and served as the backdrop for the chlorine and fluorine signals. The uniform chlorine distribution confirmed the uniformity of the chloromethylation reaction, functionalization, and subsequent chloride ion exchange of the separator. Minimal fluorine (within experimental error) was seen in SEBS-30-TMA as expected for an unreinforced separator with no apparent source of fluorine signals. Fig. 3(f)–(h) show the distribution of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine inside r-SEBS30-TMA. The strong, evenly distributed signal of fluorine overlapping with carbon across the cross-section of r-SEBS30-TMA provided clear evidence that the SEBS30-TMA solution was able to permeate the pores of the ePTFE reinforcement. The uniform distribution of chlorine across the separator cross-section with intensities (a visual representation of the EDAX signal counts) comparable to that of unreinforced SEBS-30-TMA indicated that the TMA functionalization and subsequent chloride ion exchange was not affected by presence of the ePTFE reinforcement. This explained the minimal change in the IEC and ionic conductivity. The cross-section SEM images with EDAX spectra of SEBS30-TMA, ePTFE reinforcement, and r-SEBS30-TMA membranes are also shown in Fig. S3.†

The properties of the r-SEBS-30-TMA separator are listed in Table 1 and compared to the unreinforced SEBS-30-TMA. A four-probe conductivity cell was used to determine the chloride ionic conductivities (σ) of SEBS30-TMA and r-SEBS30-TMA membranes (Fig. 4(a)). The chloride ionic conductivity of SEBS30-TMA was slightly higher than that of r-SEBS30-TMA at all temperatures. Even at 70 °C, the chloride ionic conductivity of SEBS30-TMA was 18 mS cm−1 compared to 16 mS cm−1 for r-SEBS30-TMA (only a 12% decrease in ionic conductivity). This is attributable to the lower ion exchange capacity (IEC) (1.18 mmol g−1) of r-SEBS30-TMA, compared to SEBS30-TMA (1.34 mmol g−1). Given this relatively small decrease in conductivity, no significant increase in the resistance of the RFB was expected. Thus, with minimal increase in the ohmic overpotential losses, changes to the voltage and energy efficiencies were also expected to be small upon transitioning to the reinforced separators. The Arrhenius plot of lnσ vs. inverse temperature for SEBS-based AEMs is shown in Fig. S5.† The activation energy (Ea) for SEBS30-TMA to transport chloride ion in aqueous is 8.21 kJ mol−1 and for r-SEBS30-TMA is 8.85 kJ mol−1. These Ea values are very close to Nafion® membranes (9.6 kJ mol−1) mainly due to the fast ion transport in phase segregated domains.35 The separators were also immersed in representative RFB electrolytes for over 6 weeks at 40 °C. As seen from Fig. 4(b), minimal changes in conductivity and IEC were observed over the course of this chemical stability test. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the r-SEBS-30-TMA separator was found to increase almost 600% compared to the unreinforced form while exhibiting comparable elasticity (ca. 500% elongation at break) to SEBS30-TMA (Table 1 and Fig. S4†). This led us to anticipate increased useful lifespan of the separator under operational conditions. Chen et al. synthesized polyphenylsulfone-based AEMs with different IEC values. Varying the IEC values of the AEMs yielded materials with different conductivity to permeability ratios.36 It is apparent that an AEM with relatively low IEC will induce high ohmic losses and decrease the power output of the cell whereas an AEM with high IEC may result in high crossover of active species. Previously we have demonstrated that it is indeed possible to fine tune the IEC of a separator to decrease water uptake and improve permselectivity.37 Unfortunately, this approach requires extremely precise control over the extent of the functionalization reaction thus making it impractical for large scale adoption.

Alternatively, we hypothesized that the introduction of a (preferable hydrophobic) reinforcement layer with tortuous pores would in turn decrease cation cross-over through the hydrophilic, anion-conductive channels in our triblock copolymer AEM. The measured permselectivity and transport numbers (Table 1) do indicate higher selectivity for the cross-over of the anion, thus indirectly conforming our hypothesis that the introduction of ePTFE reinforcements alters the phase segregation behavior of SEBS, in turn affecting the conductive ion channel formation in the separator. Higher permselectivity was observed across r-SEBS30-TMA (80%) compared to SEBS30-TMA (73%) with r-SEBS30-TMA demonstrating the same ion transport selectivity as benchmark AEM (Tokuyama A201).13 We note that these permselectivity values were obtained using singly charged K+ and Cl− ions. Permselectivity will improve further with highly charged cationic species like V2+/V3+ and Ce3+/Ce4+ due to both their higher charge densities and greater difference in diffusivity compared to their counter-ions. The permeability of V and Ce across r-SEBS30-TMA was measured ex situ in a diffusion cell (shown in ESI Fig. S6†) and found to be 1.4% for V and 0.5% for Ce over 30 days using ICP-OES. Thus, we have simultaneously improved both the mechanical properties and ex situ permselectivity. Direct confirmation of any changes in phase segregation was sought using SAXS.

Fig. 5 shows the SAXS profile of SEBS30-TMA and r-SEBS30-TMA AEM separators. SEBS30-TMA displayed multiple peaks at q*,  2q*, and 4q*, suggesting a cylindrical morphology.38–40 This cylindrical morphology is in agreement with our earlier observations by atomic force microscopy.30 This self-assembled morphology of the SEBS triblock copolymer is driven by the inherent chemical incompatibility between the styrene blocks and ethylene-co-butylene blocks. However, phase segregation morphology of r-SEBS30-TMA is less obvious than that of SEBS30-TMA due to the disruption of porous PTFE substrate without prominent peaks being observed. Applying the Bragg spacing equation  the primary domain spacing at q* = 0.0176 Å−1 was calculated to be 36 nm for SEBS30-TMA while the domain spacing at q* = 0.0207 Å−1 was calculated to be 30 nm for r-SEBS30-TMA. The highly ordered scattering peaks of SEBS30-TMA suggest that the long-range grain size of SEBS30-TMA is bigger than that of r-SEBS30-TMA.41 It also suggests that the defect density of SEBS30-TMA is potentially much less than that of r-SEBS30-TMA. The bigger grain size and larger domain spacing of SEBS30-TMA result in larger ionic domains than that of r-SEBS30-TMA. The smaller ionic domains of r-SEBS30-TMA results in lower ionic conductivity but higher permselectivity.42

Thus, we have demonstrated that the introduction of a porous, hydrophobic ePTFE reinforcement layer inhibits phase segregation and leads to smaller ionic domains in r-SEBS30-TMA compared to SEBS30-TMA. The resultant improvement in ex situ permselectivity was subsequently exploited in a V–Ce ED-RFB. The voltage profiles of the V–Ce ED-RFBS employing SEBS30-TMA, r-SEBS30-TMA and Nafion®-212 (chosen to match the thickness of the AEMs) separators are depicted in Fig. 6. The open circuit voltage (OCV) is an excellent metric for the permselectivity of a separator in an operating electrochemical cell with lower permselectivity resulting in smaller OCV.43,44 Thus, the ED-RFB employing Nafion®-212 cation exchange membrane (CEM), which allows for the facile cross-over of cations, exhibits the lowest OCV amongst all three cells and highest capacity fade over 20 cycles. The change in the OCV can be understood by applying the Nernst equation to the positive and negative electrodes. The half-cell potential for the negative electrode is given by: (9)
 Fig. 6  V–Ce RFB voltage profiles for a variety of membranes. (a) Cycle 1, (b) cycle 20. 
Analogously, the half-cell potential for the positive electrode is given by: (10)
At any given state of charge (SOC), the difference between these two equations predicts the cell OCV. This treatment assumes perfect permselectivity. In reality, V and Ce cross-over modifies both half-cell potentials (upon accounting for the cross-over species concentrations in the second term on the righthand side of eqn (9) and (10)). Thus, the degree of cross-over is indicated by the deviation of the OCV from the ideal, perfectly permselective case and explains the variation in the OCV between the cells employing different separators.
The introduction (by cross-over) of new cations to the anolyte and catholyte respectively also accounts of the observation of a new voltage plateaus in the charge–discharge profiles of the ED-RFB employing Nafion®-212. The OCVs and capacity fade in ED-RFBs employing the AEMs follows the ex situ permselectivity trends of the AEMs with r-SEBS30-TMA enabling higher OCV and lower capacity fade compared to SEBS30-TMA. Fig. 7 depicts the long-term cycling data for these ED-RFBs. At 20 cycles, SEBS30-TMA exhibited 10% loss in initial capacity (0.5% per cycle) and Nafion®-212 exhibited a 40% loss (2% per cycle). In comparison, the capacity fade for the V–Ce ED-RFB employing r-SEBS30-TMA was 0% within experimental error in the first 20 cycles. Upon further extended cycling to 40 cycles, a 2% loss of capacity was observed. Thus, averaging the capacity losses over the course of the entire 40 cycles, we observed only 0.05% capacity loss per cycle. Other repeats of this experiment resulted in even lower capacity fade values per cycle, leading us to believe that the capacity fade measured may be a result of leakages and/or electrolyte loss by other means rather than due to cross-over. This may also serve to explain the drop in energy efficiency observed in the r-SEBS30-TMA ED-RFB. The decrease in the energy efficiency in the other ED-RFBs correlated to cation cross-over with the cations that cross-over being electro-inactive at their opposite electrode. Fig. 8 depicts the coulombic, voltage and energy efficiencies of the r-SEBS30-TMA ED-RFB. The coulombic efficiency is close to 100% as expected. The drop in voltage efficiency and hence energy efficiency could be attributed to common engineering issues during long-term cell cycling such as electrolyte leakage, ohmic losses and possible unbalanced states of charge in the anolyte and catholyte upon some loss of either electrolyte.

Fig. 9 summarizes the mechanism underlying this improved performance of ED-RFBs employing reinforced separators. As seen in panels (a) and (b), the introduction of the porous reinforcement layer decreases the size of the ion-conductive hydrophilic domains. Upon water uptake when assembled in an electrochemical system, the hydrophilic domain size increase is restricted by the reinforcement layer while unreinforced AEMs take up more water and swell more as seen in panels (c) and (d). Thus, as seen in Fig. 9(e), an inverse correlation exists between water uptake and permselectivity, and significant improvements in permselectivity are possible (by employing reinforcement layers) even with minimal drops in IEC.

Conclusion
The introduction of reinforcement layers into block co-polymer-based AEMs results in the disruption and decrease in their ionic domain size. This effect significantly increases permselectivity while simultaneously improving mechanical properties of these separators. SEBS30-TMA AEMs achieve permselectivity values comparable to commercial, benchmark AEMs (Tokuyama A201) upon employing this strategy. Such r-SEBS30-TMA separators significantly improved lifetimes of ED-RFBs by decreasing per cycle capacity fade from 0.5% to <0.05%. This 10× improvement in operando permselectivity opens the door to ED-RFBs employing inexpensive elemental actives achieving decades-long usable lifespans.
