    AbstractIn this study, well-crystallized mesoporous anatase TiO2 spheres were prepared by hydrothermal treatment of the titanium diglycolate precursors. These spheres are submicrometer-sized and consist of packed nanocrystallites with diameters of ∼8 nm, and possess a specific surface area of 193 m2 g−1 and main pore sizes of ∼5 nm. We demonstrated that due to the large particle diameters and ultrahigh specific surface areas, mesoporous TiO2 microspheres can enhance the light harvesting within the photoanodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and meanwhile, their good crystallinity and better interparticle connections caused by partially oriented attachment of primary particles result in the effective charge transport through the film of mesoporous TiO2 spheres. A high light-to-electricity conversion of 8.20% has been achieved, indicating a 40% increase in the conversion efficiency compared to the standard Degussa P25 photoanode.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which emerged as a new generation photovoltaic device, have been studied extensively because of their high efficiency, low cost and facile fabrication process.1–4 The heart of the DSSC system is a wide bandgap semiconductor nanoparticle film that provides a large surface area for the adsorption of light-harvesting molecules.5–8 The dyes on the surface of the films absorb light and inject electrons into the conduction band of the metal oxide. To collect the electrons at a transparent conductive oxide layer, the electrons should travel the distance in the conduction band from the point where the electrons injected to the transparent conductive layer before recombination. The original state of the dye is subsequently restored by means of redox species (traditionally the I−/I3− couple) in a liquid or solid-state electrolyte.
There are many factors limiting the cell performance, among which light harvesting efficiency is very important. Because attached to the surface of the nanocrystalline film is a monolayer of the charge transfer dye, an increase of the surface roughness factor of the nanocrystalline film is very necessary to meet the requirement of efficient harvesting of sunlight. Classically, thick mesoporous wide-band gap oxide semiconductor films with an enormous internal surface area, typically a thousand times larger than that of bulk films, were used as the photoelectrode of DSSCs.9 To date, the highest energy conversion efficiency of over 11% has been achieved with films that consist of 20-nm TiO2 nanocrystallites sensitized by ruthenium-based dyes.10,11 However, the high surface area of a nanocrystalline film should bring about many opportunities for the recombination of photoinjected electrons and the oxidized dye and/or the electron acceptors in the electrolyte.6 In addition, since the sensitizers (typically, N3 or N719) have low absorption efficiency in the red region, large particles are incorporated into the film to enhance the photoresponse to red light by means of light scattering effects.12–16 However, the reduction of surface area counteracts the enhancement effect of light scattering on the optical absorption. Moreover, improving the absorption of red and near-infrared light through thickening the nanoparticle film to increase its optical density is limited by the electron diffusion length through the nanoparticle network.17
The efficiency of collection of the photoinjected electrons is another critical factor in DSSC performance, which is determined by competition between electron transport to the anode and electron transfer to I3− ions in the electrolyte. Time-resolved photocurrent and photovoltage measurements demonstrated that the electron diffusion coefficient was more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of bulk anatase crystal.18,19 These small diffusion coefficients can be roughly understood by the hypothesis of electron traps (defects existed in grain boundaries at the contacts between nanoparticles) in the porous TiO2 with a very broad distribution of release rate. Recently, considerable efforts have been made by using one-dimensional nanostructures instead of TiO2 nanoparticles, which are able to provide a direct pathway for the rapid transport of photogenerated electrons and, therefore, reduce the degree of charge recombination.20–26 Electron transport in one-dimensional nanostructures is expected to be several orders of magnitude faster than percolation through a random polycrystalline network.20 Meanwhile, higher light-harvesting efficiencies were also observed for nanotube-based DSSCs because of enhanced light scattering effects. These improvements turned out to be remarkable, but the final efficiencies announced were well below 7%,27 still much lower than the already reported efficiency of 10%28 for TiO2 nanocrystals, probably attributed to their insufficient internal surface area.
An ideal photoanode should foremost have a large surface area for dye loading and provide a large particle size to increase the absorption of red light by light scattering effect while simultaneously maintaining very efficient carrier collection. This idea was partly verified experimentally by Cao et al.29 and Caruso et al.,30 in which the overall energy conversion efficiencies up to 5.4% and 7.2% has been achieved from the films of mesoporous spheres of ZnO and TiO2, respectively. Although this method can balance the light scattering and surface area effects, which are opposed to each other, a decrease of the electron diffusion length arose by large amounts of electron traps while keeping high surface area is still a big problem.
Herein, we have developed a method to prepare well-crystallized mesoporous anatase TiO2 spheres, which involves the synthesis of titanium diglycolate spheres by a diglycol mediated process, followed by hydrothermal treatment of the precursors at a relatively low temperature. Different from the converting of the precursors by annealing at high temperature that led to a rather solid structure,31–33 the obtained spheres possess a high specific surface area (193 m2 g−1) with a mesoporous structure (pore diameter of 5 nm) while keeping good interparticle connection. Applying these mesoporous anatase spheres in DSSC, an overall energy conversion efficiency up to 8.20% (open-circuit voltage of 740 mV, short-circuit current density of 16.67 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 0.66) has been achieved.
Experimental
Preparation and characterization
The titanium diglycolate microspheres were prepared by the diglycol mediated process28 with minor modification. In a typical experiment, a mixed solution containing 0.7 mL tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) and 50 mL diethylene glycol (DEG) was magnetically stirred for 8 h at room temperature, and then added dropwise to a 150 mL acetone bath containing a small amount of water (∼0.8%) under vigorous stirring for 1 h. The white precipitate was harvested by centrifugation, following by washing with ethanol and deionized water for several times to remove DEG from the surface of the microspheres. Then, the microshperes were ultrasonically dispersed into 40 mL deionized water and transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After heating for 6 h at 180 °C, with a rate of 50 °C h−1, the titanium diglycolate microspheres were completely hydrolyzed and converted into mesoporous anatase spheres. Finally, the products were obtained by centrifugation, followed by rinsing with deionized water for several times and dried at 70 °C for further use.
The morphologies and the structures of both titanium diglycolate microspheres and mesoporous TiO2 spheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Supra-55), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-CX200), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM, H-9000NAR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 0.1542, 40 kV, 100 mA), and BET (Micrometrics ASAP 2020).
Preparation of thin films and DSSCs of mesoporous anatase microspheres
To prepare the paste, hydroxypropyl cellulose (Aldrich) was added to diethylene glycol with a concentration of about 10 wt%. The obtained mesoporous spheres were then added in a ratio of 40 wt% of TiO2 by stirring for 2 days to yield the slurry. Next, the slurry was spread onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate (TEC-8, LOF) with adhesive tape to control the thickness of the TiO2 film and to provide a noncoated area for electric contact. After drying in air, the films were sintered at 470 °C for 40 min. When cooling to 80 °C, the films were sensitized overnight in a solution of 3 × 10−4 M cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridy1-4,4′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in ethanol for dye adsorption. The films were then sandwiched together with a platinized FTO counter electrode. The electrolyte (0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodiode (PMII), 0.5 M 4-terbutylpyridine in 3-mathoxyproprionitrile) was injected into the cell from the edges by capillarity.
Photocurrent-voltage measurements
Photocurrent-voltage measurements were performed on a Keithley 4200 sourcemeter using simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2 produced by a solar simulator (Newport 69911). Incident monochromatic photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 sourcemeter under the irradiation of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a 1/4 m monochromator (Spectral Product DK240). The optical absorption spectra were measured by using U-4100 Spectrophotometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out under open-circuit condition and 100 mW m−2 bias illumination using a potentiostat (EG&G, M283) equipped with a frequency response detector (EG&G, FRD100). The spectra were scanned in a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 10 mHz at room temperature. The alternating voltage amplitude was set at 10 mV.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres

Fig. 1a–c shows the SEM images of the titanium diglycolated particles that were synthesized with different concentrations of H2O in the acetone solution of Ti(OBu)4- derived diglycolate. These as-prepared particles are spherical in shape and their surfaces are rather smooth. TEM image of the titanium diglycolated spheres gives a dense structure (Fig. 1d). No sharp diffraction ring in the selected area electron diffraction pattern was observed, indicating that the diglycolated spheres are amorphous. In our synthetic strategy, the sizes of the titanium diglycolated spheres were changed with the concentrations of H2O. As shown in Fig. 1a–c, the particle size decreased as the H2O concentration increased from 0.3 wt% to 3 wt% at a fixed Ti(OBu)4 concentration of 10 mM.

The mean diameters of these precursor spheres were about 120, 160, and 270 nm, respectively. d) TEM image of the 160 nm titanium diglycolate precursor spheres. 
After hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 6h, the titanium diglycolated spheres have been transformed into TiO2 particles. As shown in Fig. 2a, the dense precursors turned into the porous spheres with a hierarchical structure that consist of interconnected nanocrystals, with the absence of any structural collapse. The TEM image also confirms the porous nature of the sphere with the pore size of several nanometres (Fig. 2b). Continuous sharp circles on the SAED pattern in the inset of Fig. 2b indicate that the spheres have a polycrystalline anatase structure. Fig. 2c gives the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, further indicating the anatase structure of the products. The average primary nanocrystal size is about 8 nm as estimated from the full width at half maximum of the (101) peak using Scherer equation, which is consistent with the observation by TEM.

Fig. 3 displays the representative HRTEM image of the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres, which illustrates that the spheres are packed of nanocrystals. It is found that these nanocrystals are connected with each other and the pores are the interparticle voids. Lattice images were clearly observed, indicating that these nanocrystals had high crystallinity. A lattice spacing of 0.35 nm was determined by fast Fourier transform pattern (FFT) (inset) and could be attributed to the lattice spacing of the (101) plane of the anatase phase. Meanwhile, the FFT pattern displays somewhat dispersed spots, implies that although many primary anatase nanocrystals are random in orientations, there are adjacent primary anatase nanocrystals attached with the same orientation.

Furthermore, nitrogen sorptometer measurements were used to characterize the pore structure of the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the porous spheres displays the typical type IV curve (type H2 hysteresis loop), which is usually ascribed to the predominance of mesopores and the existence of pore connectivity effects (Fig. 4a). The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution (Fig. 4b) obtained from the isotherm indicates a main pore size of ∼5 nm. The BET specific surface area and pore volume of the sample are 193 m2 g−1 and 0.304 cm3 g−1, respectively.

Characterization of the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres films as the photoanodes
To investigate the performance of the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres as photoanodes for DSSC, TiO2 films with different thicknesses were prepared using a doctor-blade technique. Typically, the slurry of the mesoporous spheres was spread onto FTO glass substrates with adhesive tape to form a film of 5–20 μm in thickness, and the film was subsequently annealed at 470 °C for 40 min to remove residual solvents and any organic compounds as well as to improve the contact between the film and the substrate and the connection of both interparticles and the mesoporous spheres. Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of TiO2 film with mesoporous anatase spheres, indicating a highly disordered structure that is well stacked with submicrometer-sized mesoporous particles. No notable change in particle size of both primary particles and secondary particles was observed during the annealing process.

Photovoltaic properties
DSSCs consisting of TiO2 films with mesoporous spheres were characterized by measuring the current–voltage behavior under illumination with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. For comparison, the TiO2 photoanodes made of commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25) were also investigated. Fig. 6 shows typical current density versus voltage curves of the mesoporous sphere and P25 photoanodes. The 12.5 μm and 15.4 μm thick TiO2 photoanodes made from the mesoporous TiO2 spheres show the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.08 mA cm−2 and 16.67 mA cm−2 with the energy conversion efficiency (η) of 7.37% and 8.20%, respectively, whereas the 12.2 μm and 15.2 μm thick TiO2 photoanodes made from P25 nanoparticles give the Jsc of 11.34 mA cm−2 and 8.85 mA cm−2 with the η of 5.85% and 4.81%, respectively, indicating 26% and 71% increase in the conversion efficiency compared to the P25 photoanodes of similar thickness. Compared to the P25 photoanodes with an optimized thickness, the improvement in cell efficiency for the 15.4-μm-thick mesoprous sphere film is 40%. In an earlier report by Yoshikawa et al.,34 mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanoparticle photoanodes with a surface area of 193 m2 g−1 presented a η of 6.3%, a Jsc of 13.28 mA cm−2, a Voc of 702 mV and a ff of 0.676. Obviously, the mesoprous sphere films have a unique hierarchical pore structure with continuous nanochannels between the primary particles and continunous external channels among the mesoprous spheres, which may induce efficient electrolyte diffusions and enhance conversion efficiency.35

The DSSC performance largely depends on the film thickness. The performance characteristics of the DSSCs made for TiO2 mesoporous microspheres and P25 photoanodes with different thicknesses are summarized in Table 1. The photoanodes made from mesoporous TiO2 spheres possessed short-circuit current densities and energy conversion efficiencies than those of the P25 photoanodes with similar thickness. For the photoanodes of mesoporous TiO2 spheres, Jsc increased with the thickness from 5 to 16 μm but decreased with further increase in thickness. Contrary to the tendency of Jsc, Voc decreased monotonically with increasing film thickness. It is reasonable that dye in the film will build up with increasing thickness, and an increased Jsc would be expected. On the other hand, charge recombination and mass transport limitations in the thicker film lead to a decreased Voc. In addition, the series resistances of the thicker films grow quickly because the redox species and electrons migrate in a long path-length to complete the circuit. Balanced from Jsc and Voc, η increased with thickness up to 16 μm followed by a decrease. It can be concluded that the optimal thickness for the photoanodes made of mesoporous TiO2 spheres falls in the range of 12–16 μm, in contrast to the optimal thickness of 10–12 μm for P25 photoanodes.

Optical properties

Fig. 7a shows the optical absorption spectra of the mesoporous TiO2 spheres and P25 films before and after dye sensitization, which reflect the difference in light-harvesting capabilities of the films. The absorption below 400 nm represents the intrinsic absorption of TiO2. Compared to the P25 film, the film made from mesoporous spheres has higher absorption capabilities at wavelengths above 400 nm, indicating that the incident light was significantly scattered with the film of mesoporous spheres due to the larger size of the spheres. The result can be confirmed further by diffuse reflection spectra (Fig. 7b). Compared with the reflectance of the P25 TiO2 film, the mesoporous sphere film had a higher diffuse reflection capability in the visible regions (from 400 nm to 800 nm), revealing that the sphere film had a stronger light scattering ability. It is evident that, after dye sensitization, a significant increase of the absorption intensity occurred in the mesoporous sphere photoanode in the visible region, especially in the red region, compared to the P25 film, owing to significantly enhanced N719 dye absorption and a strong light scattering effect from the larger secondary particle size of the mesoporous spheres.

Photoelectrochemical properties
To analyze in more detail the enhanced cell performance, IPCE measurements were conducted. Fig. 8 shows the IPCE as a function of wavelength measured at short circuit. The IPCE is determined by the light absorption efficiency of the dye, the quantum yield of electron injection, and the efficiency of collecting the injected electrons at the conducting glass substrate,36 which is strongly affected by the morphology and surface area of the photoelectrode.37 Compared with the P25 TiO2 film, the film of mesoporous spheres had a higher IPCE from 400 nm to 750 nm wavelength ranges. At the maximum value of the IPCE spectra at 520 nm, the IPCE of the film of mesoporous spheres was approximately 42% higher than that of the P25 TiO2 film. The large increase in IPCE at 500–550 nm wavelengths could be attributed to the enhancement of dye adsorption on the ultrahigh surface area and better interparticle connections formed by partially oriented attachment of highly-crystalline primary particles, leading to the higher Jsc. Moreover, in the long wavelength region (>600 nm), in which the dye has a low absorption for incident light, the higher IPCE value of the mesoporous microsphere electrode could originate from the enhanced light scattering capacities of the film.29,30

Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to investigate the lifetime of the electron on the TiO2 films. At open circuit voltage and under one-sun illumination, no net current passes through the external circuit. All the injected electrons react with I3− at TiO2/electrolyte interface before being extracted to the external circuit. Fig. 9 displays the EIS plots of the DSSCs based on the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres and P25 nanoparticles under illumination with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. Generally, from the high frequency to low frequency in the Bode plot, three characteristic frequency peaks would appear, corresponding tothe charge transfer at the counter electrode, the electron transport and the recombination in the TiO2 nanoparticles and the Nernstian diffusion in the electrolyte, respectively. Electron lifetime (τeff) could be calculated from the middle-frequency (fmin) as:38  The τ values for the DSSCs constructed with mesoporous spheres and P25 nanoparticles are 35.2 ms and 4.3 ms, respectively. A significant increase in the τ value reveals the effective retardation of the charge recombination reaction between photoinjected electrons with I3− during the electron transport through the film of mesoporous TiO2 spheres, as compared to P25 nanoparticle-based film. The result may be ascribed to the reduction of electron loss in the grain boundaries caused by the decrease of the intercrystalline titania contacts formed by partially oriented attachment of highly-crystalline primary particles.6

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have prepared highly-crystallized mesoporous TiO2 microspheres with surface areas up to 193.0 m2 g−1 and main pore sizes of ∼5 nm. Due to the large particle diameters and ultrahigh specific surface areas, mesoporous TiO2 microspheres can enhance the light harvesting within the photoanodes, and meanwhile, their good crystallinity and better interparticle connections caused by partially oriented attachment of primary particles result in the effective charge transport through the film of mesoporous TiO2 spheres. These advantages make the mesoporous TiO2 spheres become an ideal candidate for the photoanode of DSSCs. The maximum energy conversion efficiency of 8.20% has been achieved by the photoanodes made from mesoporous spheres, which is a more than 40% increase over that derived from standard Degussa P25 nanoparticle photoanodes of an optimized thickness.
