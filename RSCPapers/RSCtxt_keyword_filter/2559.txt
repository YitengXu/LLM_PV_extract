    , Accepted 28th November 2019First published on 28th November 2019AbstractAll solid-state quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have become increasingly attractive owing to their ability to solve the issues of package difficulty and poor long-term stability. However, the commonly used colloidal lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) suffer from having a complicated synthesis with the use of high-temperature, harmful organic solvents and a protective atmosphere. In this work, the synchronous deposition of PbS and CdS QDs, realized through a facile successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), was proposed to construct efficient and stable solid-state QDSCs. This design concept affords two benefits: (1) the synchronous deposition of two sulfides suppresses the excessive growth of PbS QDs in the mesopores of films, thereby ensuring the efficient electron injection from PbS to TiO2; (2) the intimate interpenetration of two sulfides allows superior passivation of high-density defects on the surface of PbS QDs, which reduces the severe interfacial charge recombination. As a result, the solid-state (Pb,Cd)S QD-sensitized TiO2 solar cell achieved more than 5 times efficiency enhancement in contrast to the conventional PbS/CdS pattern based device. This work highlights the design of novel QD schemes for high performance solid-state solar cells.
1. Introduction
High efficiency, low-cost and stable solar cells are considered to be effective in solving the current environmental pollution and energy crisis issues.1,2 To date, a number of light harvesting semiconductor materials have been explored for photovoltaic devices, including silicon, Cu(In,Ga)Se2, Sb2Se3, organic dyes, quantum dots (QDs), perovskites, etc.2 Among all these, QDs have attracted tremendous attention owing to their excellent photoelectric properties, such as quantum size effect, multiple exciton generation (MEG), strong absorption, high stability, etc.3–7 It is worth noting that the theoretical power conversion efficiency of QD-based solar cells can reach a remarkable value of 44% when taking into account the MEG effect.8 Since the invention of the QDSC, it has undergone rapid development. A series of QDs that can serve as photosensitizers has been developed, such as CdS,8 CdSe,9 PbS,10 Sb2S3,11 HgTe,12 PbSe,13etc. In particular, PbS QDs afford two outstanding advantages, one is that PbS enables the extension of light absorption from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) region, and the other is that PbS shows great potential to achieve the MEG effect.4 Both merits contribute to the great increase of photocurrent density for photovoltaic application.14 Therefore, PbS has been extensively utilized in QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). For instance, Abbas et al. reported an extremely high photocurrent density exceeding 30 mA cm−2 for enhanced performance of PbS QDSCs via controlled successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR).15 Our previous work has also demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 3.06% for QDSCs, in which PbS QDs were prepared by a novel anion-exchange strategy.16
It is well known that the QDSC is a derivative of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), and it usually shares the liquid feature for solar devices. The use of conventional liquid electrolytes can exacerbate the recombination of photogenerated carriers. At the current stage, although liquid-type solar cells are more efficient, they are not easy to pack and they suffer from poor long-term stability. To overcome this issue, solid-state QDSCs have been proposed.17 But, there seems to be a trade-off between efficiency and stability. That is, solid-state QDSCs often afford an evident improvement of device stability at the cost of device efficiency. This scenario is primarily attributed to the unfavorable infiltration of solid electrolytes into the mesoporous photoelectrode films.18 At present, most of the solid-state QDSCs involve device construction with colloidal QDs, while the synthesis of colloidal QDs suffers from requiring complicated procedures, high-temperature operation, and the use of harmful organic solvents and a protective atmosphere.19 Moreover, for NIR responsive PbS QDs, the high-density surface defect states (∼10−17 cm−3) usually lead to very severe charge recombination in the objective devices, which seriously restricts device performance improvement.20 With the aim of inhibiting interfacial charge recombination, some publications demonstrated the use of wide band-gap semiconductors (such as CdS, ZnS, etc.) to design core/shell structures in which CdS or ZnS serves as a capping passivation layer.16,17 However, these approaches involve complicated processing while the photovoltaic performance of the solid-state devices still lags far behind that of liquid-type QDSCs. Therefore, the exploitation of simple fabrication technologies and effective passivation strategies to construct efficient and stable solid-state PbS QDSCs is of significant importance.
In this work, we design an efficient sensitization system of PbS and CdS QDs synchronously deposited onto mesoporous TiO2, prepared by the facile SILAR method, to assemble enhanced performance all solid-state QDSCs. In our scheme, the synchronous deposition of both sulfides not only inhibits the excessive growth of PbS in the mesopore of the TiO2 film, but also affords the excellent surface passivation of PbS. As a result, the electron injection from PbS to TiO2 is promoted and the charge recombination at the surface of PbS QDs is suppressed. In contrast to the conventional PbS/CdS device, our (Pb,Cd)S scheme-based solid-state QDSC yields more than 5 times efficiency enhancement.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Hydrochloric acid (HCl, mass fraction = 36.5–38.0%, Sinopharm), Zn powder (Zn, ≥99%, Aladdin), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Aldrich), 1-butanol (CH3(CH2)3OH, ≥99%, Aladdin), 18-NRT (TiO2, 10%–20%, Greatcell Solar Ltd), titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, ≥98.0%, Aladdin), cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, ≥98%, Sinopharm), lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O, ≥99.5%, Sinopharm), sodium sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O, ≥98.0%, Sinopharm), methanol (CH3OH, 99.5%, Sinopharm), acetonitrile (C2H3N, >99%, Aladdin), chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl, 99.5%, Aladdin), 4-tert-butylpyrldine (C9H13N, 96%, Aladdin), bis(trifluoro-methane) sulfonimide lithium salt (99.95%, Aladdin), Spiro-OMeTAD (≥98.0%, Polymer), and gold (Au, 99.99%) were all used as received.
2.2. Preparation of TiO2 films
Commercially available F-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, sheet resistance ∼15 Ω sq−1) was used as the substrate, and it was etched by HCl and Zn powder, followed by thorough washing with soapy water, deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol for 15 min, respectively. Then, the substrates were treated under UV ozone for 20 min. A compact TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2) was spin-coated onto the FTO substrates using titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) dissolved in 1-butanol solutions at 500 rpm for 3 s, then 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed in a Muffle furnace at 500 °C for 30 min. A mesoporous TiO2 layer (mp-TiO2) was further prepared by spin coating TiO2 nanoparticles (Dyesol DSL 18NRT, around 20 nm) that were diluted in anhydrous ethanol with a weight ratio of 1:2 at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min in a Muffle furnace. The annealed mesoporous TiO2 film was further treated with 50 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.
2.3. Deposition of QDs by SILAR
The SILAR method was used to deposit QDs onto mesoporous TiO2 films. In this work, two schemes of hybrid QD systems were studied, i.e., (Pb,Cd)S and PbS/CdS. The (Pb,Cd)S scheme refers to the QDs prepared by using a mixed methanol solution of 0.02 M Pb(CH3COO)2 and 0.08 M Cd(CH3COO)2 as the cationic precursor; while the PbS/CdS scheme denotes the deposition of PbS first and then CdS, which involved the use of 0.02 M Pb(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2 methanol solutions as the cationic precursors, respectively. Both schemes shared the same anionic precursor solution, i.e., 0.1 M Na2S dissolved in the solvent of water and methanol with a volume ratio of 1/1. A single SILAR process consisted of 1 min dipping of mesoporous TiO2 films into each cationic solution and anionic solution; each dip was followed by thorough rinsing with methanol solution and drying with nitrogen. The SILAR process was repeated a number of times to deliver the desired amount of QDs. Herein, six SILAR cycles were employed to achieve the (Pb,Cd)S scheme-based devices while the PbS/CdS device required six SILAR cycles for both PbS and CdS.
2.4. Device fabrication
In this work, Spiro-OMeTAD was used as the solid electrolyte, i.e., the hole transporting material, for the preparation of all solid-state QDSCs. The electrolyte, consisting of 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene with the additive of 18 μL of bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) solution/acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1) and 29 μL of 4-tert-butylpyrldine (TBP), was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. This process was performed in a N2 glovebox. To complete the device, a 100 nm thick Au electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the solid electrolyte layer under a pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the devices was 0.1 cm2, defined by the overlapping area between the un-etched FTO substrate and Au electrode.
2.5. Characterization of materials and devices
The XRD measurement was performed on an X’Pert PRO MPD diffractometer (Panalytical B. V.) with the use of Cu Kα as the irradiation. XPS spectra were collected on an ESCALAB220Xi electron spectrometer from Thermo Scientific. The optical absorption spectrum was achieved by using an Agilent UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (CARY 5000) equipped with an integrating sphere attachment. The film morphologies and element distribution were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, GeminiSEM 500) equipped with an EDAX system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100PLUS) was also used to reveal the microstructure of the QDs. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells were tested under AM1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, Oriel Sol 3A Solar Simulator, Newport), linked with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the typical fabrication process of the all solid-state QDSCs produced in this work. For the facile SILAR method, a mixed solution of 0.02 M Pb(CH3COO)2 and 0.08 M Cd(CH3COO)2 was employed as the cationic precursor to allow the adsorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+ cations onto the mesoporous TiO2 film, and the cations were reacted with the subsequently deposited S2− anions to form PbS and CdS QDs. The particle size of the QDs gradually grew with the increase of SILAR cycles. The synchronous deposition of PbS and CdS was realized by using a mixed cationic precursor solution. In this scenario, there exists a competitive relationship between the nucleation processes of PbS and CdS in the mesopores of TiO2 film.21 That is, the excessive growth of PbS QDs would be suppressed when CdS was synchronously deposited. Moreover, the synchronous deposition of PbS and CdS would lead to the intimate interpenetration of both sulfides, which allows CdS to effectively passivate the high-density defects on the surface of PbS. This design concept is expected to construct high performance PbS QDSCs.

Fig. 2a and b show plane-view SEM images of the (Pb,Cd)S QD sensitized mesoporous TiO2 film. It is clear that the TiO2 films have a highly porous nanostructure. This kind of mesoporous structure not only offers a large specific surface area for the accommodation of more QDs, but also facilitates the easier penetration of cationic and anionic precursors into the interior of the films and the effective inhibition of excessively large QDs. The deposition of QDs did not change the porous feature of the surface of the TiO2 films, implying the quite small size of QDs in contrast to the 20–30 nm TiO2 nanoparticles.
 Fig. 2  (a and b) Plane-view SEM images of the (Pb,Cd)S QD-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 film, and (c and d) TEM images of (Pb,Cd)S QD-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticles. 
With the aim of revealing the nanostructure feature of (Pb,Cd)S QDs, the TEM images were recorded and are shown in Fig. 2c and d. As shown, the PbS QDs are well separated and uniformly distributed on the surface of the larger TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 2c). This scenario is well consistent with ref. 14 and 22. It is worth noting that the as-deposited QDs only partially cover the surface of TiO2; the incomplete coverage has been generally regarded as one potential factor that causes carrier recombination in the devices. However, for PbS QDSCs, the low surface coverage of TiO2 might not be the critical factor since the high-density surface defects of PbS QDs have been demonstrated to contribute more to the charge recombination.14 As revealed by the high-resolution TEM (Fig. 2d), the average particle size of PbS QDs is around 3.5–4.0 nm. The lattice fringes of the PbS (200) plane of ∼0.30 nm and the CdS(111) plane of ∼0.34 nm can be identified from the image,17,23 indicating that the resultant (Pb,Cd)S QD is indeed a mixture of CdS and PbS instead of being a ternary alloyed compound. CdS QDs show a smaller size than the PbS QDs. This fact might be associated with the higher solubility product constant Ksp of CdS (7.0 × 10−27) in contrast to that of PbS (8.0 × 10−28),24 which gives rise to a relatively lower deposition rate for CdS during the synchronous deposition process. Moreover, the CdS QDs are in close contact with PbS QDs, showing a scenario of CdS coating on PbS; this phenomenon echoes the lower nucleation of CdS with respect to PbS.

Fig. 3a gives the cross-section SEM image of the as-prepared solid-state PbS QDSCs. The device thickness is estimated to be ∼1.7 μm. This value approximately equals the thickness of the TiO2 mesoporous layer, since QDs and Spiro-OMeTAD almost completely infiltrate into the mesopores of the TiO2 films. A Au layer was deposited to serve as the back electrode (Fig. S1, ESI†). Such a three dimensional (3D) device structure would facilitate the charge separation of photogenerated carriers. In solid-state solar cells, a thin mesoporous layer might not afford enough space to load adequate QDs, while a thick mesoporous layer would not be conducive to the transport of carriers.25 Therefore, it is necessary to reach a successful balance between the two for enhanced device performance. Generally, the optimum thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film suitable for solid-state solar cells is ∼2 μm.26 The different functional regions are identified and marked along the cross-section in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b shows the EDX spectrum collected in the region of the mesoporous layer along the cross-section of devices. In addition to two energy-dispersion peaks of Ti and O, typical peaks of Pb, Cd and S are also detected for the (Pb,Cd)S QD sensitized mesoporous TiO2 films. The estimated atomic ratios of elements are shown in the inset: 3.8% Pb, 3.8% Cd, and 9% S, with Ti and O being the balance, implying the approximate stoichiometric formation of PbS and CdS onto the surface of mesoporous TiO2 films. Furthermore, although the feed molar ratio of Pb/Cd in the precursor cation solution is 1/4, the resultant atomic ratio of Pb/Cd is around 1/1; this result further verifies the faster deposition rate of PbS than that of CdS. Fig. 3c–f present the mapping images of various elements (Ti, O, Pb, Cd, and S) at the cross-section of the mesoporous layer. As shown, all the elements display homogeneous distributions at different depths, evidencing the uniform nucleation over large-scale mesoporous TiO2 films.

We further performed XPS for confirming the surface states on the (Pb,Cd)S-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 film sample, as shown in Fig. 4a–d. The survey spectrum (Fig. 4a) reveals the presence of the main species of Pb, Cd, and S elements on TiO2 films, indicating the successful loading of PbS and CdS QDs. Fig. 4b–d gives Pb 4f, Cd 3d, and S 2p high resolution spectra with peak position identified through spectrum deconvolution, respectively. The Pb 4f spectrum exhibits two peaks located at 137.7 eV for Pb 4f7/2 and 142.6 eV for Pb 4f5/2, respectively. The peaks of 411.8 eV and 405.0 eV correspond to Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2, implying that the Cd element exists in the form of Cd2+ as CdS.27 The S 2p spectrum has two peaks located at 162.2 eV for S 2p1/2 and 161.0 eV for S 2p3/2 with a peak separation of ∼1.2 eV, which is consistent with the results from the literature.10,28 Moreover, an additional weak peak of ∼168.2 eV is detected in the S 2p spectrum, and it is a characteristic peak regarded as a fingerprint for sulphates (PbSO4).29,30 This result indicates the partial oxidation of the top-most QD layer because of exposure to the atmospheric environment. However, it should be noted that most of the detected oxygen-containing sulphates might be produced at the surface of the films since XPS is a surface-sensitive technology with a typical probe depth of a few nanometers. Choi et al. demonstrated that the interior of PbS film consisted of little elemental oxygen.29

Fig. 4e shows the XRD patterns of (Pb,Cd)S, PbS and CdS QD sensitized mesoporous TiO2 films, all prepared with 6 SILAR cycles. As shown, besides the diffraction pattern of TiO2, several additional broad diffraction peaks of (200) and (220) as marked in the figure can be well distinguished for the (Pb,Cd)S sample, implying the successful growth of cubic phases of rock salt structure PbS (JCPDS No. 65-0132) and zinc blende structure CdS (JCPDS No. 80-0019) onto the mesoporous TiO2 layer.31–33 In contrast to the strong diffraction peaks from TiO2, the peak intensities of the QDs are quite weak in view of their small amount. Herein, the failure to detect the presence of any new diffraction peaks or distinct peak shifts for the (Pb,Cd)S sample confirms a mixture of phases for the resultant (Pb,Cd)S QDs.21 This result further confirms the results from TEM characterization. Moreover, Zhou et al. proposed a binary phase diagram of PbS and CdS,34 which reveals a negligible solubility between the two phases. At room temperature, PbS and CdS almost could not form the PbS–CdS solid solution phase. Therefore, we conclude that the existing form of SILAR processed (Pb,Cd)S QDs by using a mixed cationic precursor solution of Pb2+ and Cd2+ at room temperature is a mixture of CdS and PbS phases instead of a ternary alloyed compound. Fig. 4f gives the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of (Pb,Cd)S QD-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 films prepared using 2, 4, 6, and 8 SILAR cycles. As shown, the films exhibit extended absorption into the NIR part of the solar spectrum owning to the broadband light harvesting of PbS QDs. Moreover, with the increasing number of SILAR cycles, a pronounced red shift of the absorption edge was observed for PbS QDs. That is, more SILAR cycles result in smaller band gaps. This fact indicates that the SILAR method affords facile tuning of the light harvesting on the basis of the quantum size effect.

Fig. 5a presents the device structure of a solid-state solar cell with (Pb,Cd)S QDs as sensitizers. The typical configuration is FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/(Pb,Cd)S/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Under the illumination of sunlight, the (Pb,Cd)S sensitizers absorb photons to create electron–hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons are rapidly injected to the TiO2 electron transporting layer (ETL) since the QDs are in situ deposited on mesoporous TiO2 films, and further collected by the conducting FTO substrate through the transportation of the TiO2 ETL with a high electron mobility of 0.1–10 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes are transferred to the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transporting layer (HTL).35 It is well known that a higher conduction band level promotes electron injection into the ETL, while a lower conduction band level might hinder electron injection.36,37 Therefore, the energy level of PbS QDs, which mainly depends on the particle size, is imperative to meet this demand. Generally, the efficient electron injection from PbS QDs into TiO2 is predicted to occur for QDs with a particle size smaller than the critical value of around 4.3 nm.36 Fortunately, as revealed by TEM characterization, the as-deposited PbS QDs are 3.5–4.0 nm in this work. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect an efficient electron injection from PbS to TiO2. The corresponding energy levels of the active layers are illustrated in Fig. 5b.36 The band structures of PbS QDs are well adapted to the TiO2 ETL and Spiro-OMeTAD HTL.
 Fig. 5  (a) The device structure, (b) energy levels of active layers, (c) current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under the illumination of 1 Sun (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2), and (d) evolution of photovoltaic parameters (efficiency, Jsc, Voc and FF) performed under the continuous illumination of 1 Sun (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) of solid-state QDSCs. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells, measured under the illumination of 1 Sun (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2), are shown in Fig. 5c. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 1. For comparison, a solar cell constructed with PbS/CdS QDs, a conventional scheme of co-sensitization, was prepared as the control sample in this work. The corresponding device configuration is identical to our (Pb,Cd)S QD-based device. As shown, the (Pb,Cd)S device acquired a Voc of 0.49 V, Jsc of 1.79 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.36, yielding an overall efficiency of 0.32%; while the control PbS/CdS device exhibited a much lower efficiency of 0.06%, coupled with a Voc of 0.23 V, Jsc of 0.71 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.36. It is evident that the efficiency improvement mainly arises from the increase of Voc and Jsc. In addition, in contrast to both hybrid systems, the single PbS and CdS-based systems exhibit even poorer performance (Table S1, ESI†). To further explore the interfacial charge recombination in solar cells, J–V characteristics measured in the dark were studied (Fig. S2, ESI†). It was revealed that, in contrast to the conventional PbS/CdS system, the driving electrons need larger bias voltages to travel across the photoelectrodes for the (Pb,Cd)S system. That is, the J–V curves display a smaller dark current for the (Pb,Cd)S device than for the PbS/CdS one. This fact confirms the improved interfacial charge recombination in our (Pb,Cd)S scheme-based QDSCs. Herein, CdS QDs mainly serve as the effective passivation layer, similar to the critical role of commonly used ZnS in QDSCs, to passivate the surface of PbS QDs with high-density defects.16,38–40 The intimate interpenetration of PbS and CdS in the (Pb,Cd)S case is supposed to contribute to the suppression of interfacial recombination.41,42 Our previous studies working on the liquid-type QDSCs have also demonstrated similar results.21 This result is consistent with the device performance measured under the illumination of 1 Sun, which reveals a significantly enhanced Voc for the (Pb,Cd)S device (Fig. 5c).

Herein, the performance enhancement of the (Pb,Cd)S device might be attributed to the following factors: (1) the synchronous deposition of PbS and CdS inhibits the excessive growth of PbS QDs in the mesopores, which lifts the conduction band position of PbS for efficient electron injection; (2) the (Pb,Cd)S scheme allows the superior passivation of PbS QDs with high-density surface defects through the intimate interpenetration of PbS and CdS, which effectively suppresses the interfacial charge recombination. Due to the benefits of the synchronous deposition of PbS and CdS QDs, the (Pb,Cd)S scheme-based device delivers more than 5 times efficiency improvement in contrast to the conventional PbS/CdS scheme.
We further perform the stability test of solid-state QDSCs under the continuous illumination of 1 Sun (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) in an ambient atmosphere. The evolution of photovoltaic parameters (efficiency, Jsc, Voc and FF) that lasts for a certain period of duration around 9 min is shown in Fig. 5d. The results show that all of the photovoltaic parameters are basically at a stable level, indicating an excellent device stability for our (Pb,Cd)S scheme-based all solid-state QDSCs. The slight rise of device performance over the first few minutes under light exposure can be explained by the light soaking effect, which has been observed for PbS QD solar cells.43

Table 2 summarizes the recent reports of solid-state QDSCs. As shown, most of these publications demonstrate the construction of solid-state QDSCs with the use of high temperature or harmful organic solvents. Herein, the organic solvents usually play a role of passivating the surface states of QDs. By contrast, the deposition of QDs in this work is more facile and economical to fabricate photovoltaic devices. To the best of our knowledge, this work reports the highest power conversion efficiency among those studies that involve the fabrication of QDs in an atmospheric environment without the use of harmful organic solvents.

4. Conclusion
In this work, a NIR responsive solid-state QDSC was constructed with (Pb,Cd)S QDs serving as sensitizers. The (Pb,Cd)S QDs were uniformly distributed on the mesoporous TiO2 film through the SILAR method with the use of a mixed cationic precursor of Pb2+ and Cd2+, and confirmed to be a mixture of CdS and PbS. The (Pb,Cd)S scheme affords the merits of band-structure tailoring and surface recombination passivation through the synchronous deposition of PbS and CdS. With the construction of the solid-state (Pb,Cd)S QD-sensitized TiO2 solar cell, an appreciable efficiency of 0.32% was achieved, outperforming that of the conventional PbS/CdS scheme-based device (0.06%). This work emphasizes the construction of high efficiency and stable solid-state QDSCs through a facile and economical fabrication technology.
