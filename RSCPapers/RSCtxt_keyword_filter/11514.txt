    , Accepted 18th January 2021First published on 20th January 2021AbstractOptimizing the molecular backbone is one of the most important strategies for improving the photovoltaic performance of acceptor–donor–acceptor type small molecule acceptor (SMA) materials. Herein, two new SMA materials, namely BFHIC-4F and BFHIC, were designed and synthesized based on a new donor unit of heptacyclic benzodi(thienocyclopentafuran) (BFH) with benzodifuran (BDF) as a core and alkyl-thiophene as conjugated side chains. The materials show a broad absorption, deep highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, and good molecular arrangement compared to the analogues with benzodithiophene (BDT) as a core. BFHIC-4F exhibits a stronger crystallinity, ordered intermolecular π–π stacking, and enhanced photovoltaic performance than BFHIC. The polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PM6:BFHIC-4F show an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.4%, with a high Voc of 0.87 V, high Jsc of 22.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.7% due to the influence of fluorine atoms. Notably, the PM6:BFHIC-4F-based and PM6:BFHIC-based devices display a small Eloss of 0.58 eV and 0.52 eV, respectively, indicating a more effective exciton dissociation, charge collection efficiency, and photo-induced charge transfer between PM6 and BFH-based acceptor materials. These results demonstrate that the BFH central unit is a promising building block in the SMA materials, and the device based on the PM6:BFHIC-4F blend film is a potential candidate for high-performance PSCs in the future.
Introduction
Since the advent of solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) in the mid-1990s, they have been widely studied by researchers and have shown strong vitality because of their advantages of low cost, lightweight, and capability of fabricating a large-area flexible device with solution processing methods.1–5 BHJ PSCs exhibit a broad commercial application prospect.6–10 In the past few years, non-fullerene (NF) PSCs have achieved exciting development, and the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have been found to be close to 18%, which is largely due to the development of NF acceptor materials and polymer donor materials.11–16
Among numerous NF acceptors, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-structured NF acceptors have been proven to be one of the most effective molecular backbone architectures because of their outstanding advantages of energetic absorption in the visible-near infrared region, strong chemical and electronic adjustability.9,10,17–21 Numerous NF acceptors have been reported in the last few years, such as ITIC,22 IDIC,23 IEIC,24 and IT-4F.25 In the A–D–A-type molecular backbone (including donor and acceptor materials), both donor (D) and acceptor (A) units have a profound impact on the performance of photovoltaic materials. In particular, the combination of a fused-ring D-unit and functional A-unit has produced numerous excellent photovoltaic materials.
In 2014, Jen et al. reported a D-unit, IDTCPDT, with eleven-membered fused-ring based on indacenodithiophene, as the multi-ring D-units can extend the conjugation length and decrease the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the photovoltaic material.26 A small-molecule acceptor of 6TIC with a fused-ring core unit was designed and synthesized in 2018. Compared with 4TIC, 6TIC shows a higher lying HOMO energy level, much broader absorption, slightly smaller bandgap, and superior electron mobility (μe).27 In 2017, Chen and the cooperator reported an NF acceptor, NFBDT, which mainly consisted of a heptacyclic benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) unit (CBT, based on benzodithiophene (BDT)) as the central unit. PSCs based on PBDB-T: NFBDT demonstrated an efficient PCE of 10.4% owing to the low optical bandgap of NFBDT, matched energy levels, and complementary absorption range between PBDB-T and NFBDT.28 Based on NFBDT, when a weak electron-donating alkyl group was introduced to the central BDT unit and fluorine atoms were introduced to the end groups, a new NF acceptor, namely NCBDT, was designed and synthesized. The device based on PBDB-T:NCBDT obtained an impressive PCE of 12.12% mainly due to the wider absorption of NCBDT.29 Moreover, Zhan et al. proposed a side-chain conjugation strategy in the design of NF acceptors, and the new small acceptor of ITIC2 exhibited redshifted and stronger absorption, higher energy levels, and higher μe relative to ITIC1 without conjugated side-chains.30 Recently, we reported a NF acceptor, BTC-2F, based on a CBT core conjugated with chlorinated-thienyl. BTC-2F exhibited a deeper HOMO energy level and higher μe than BTH-2F without chlorinated-thienyl. PSCs based on PM6 as a donor material presents a PCE of 12.9%, which is processed by nonhalogenated solvents.31
Benzodifuran (BDF) has a molecular structure similar to the BDT unit, with furan rings fused in the backbone. Materials based on BDF can generate deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels, tighter intermolecular stacking, and a well-conjugated backbone, and thus have higher mobility than that of BDT counterparts due to higher electronegativity and smaller diameter of oxygen atom than that of sulfur atom.32,33 Moreover, the good solubility, biodegradability, and abundant sources of furan make BDF a very competitive choice in organic photovoltaic materials.34 However, BDF attracted much less attention compared to BDT. Due to the structural specialties and economic advantages of BDF, effort should be devoted to further developing photovoltaic materials based on BDF. Inspired by this, we introduced BDF as the core unit onto the molecular backbone of NF acceptor materials.
In this study, we presented a new NF acceptor material of BFHIC-4F, which is based on a heptacyclic benzodi(4H-thieno[3′,2′:4,5]cyclopenta[1,2-b]furan) (abbreviated as heptacyclic benzodi(thienocyclopentafuran), BFH) donor unit, with BDF as the central core and 3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-1-indanone (IC2F) end groups. In order to further broaden the absorption and inhibit the excessive aggregation of the material, conjugated 5-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophene side chains and nonconjugated 4-hexylbenzene side chains were also introduced to the molecular backbone (as shown in Fig. 1a). The counterpart BFHIC without fluorine substitution at the end group was also synthesized for comparison. The introduction of fluorine atoms expands the coplanarity of the terminal groups of BFHIC-4F, which makes it more conducive to the close packing of exposed terminal groups between molecules.35 As a result, BFHIC-4F demonstrates a wider absorption, with an absorption edge of 859 nm (834 nm for BFHIC), smaller optical bandgap of 1.44 eV (1.48 eV for BFHIC), and higher electron mobility μe of 6.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (2.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BFHIC) compared to BFHIC. The PSC device based on PM6:BFHIC-4F with the additive and thermal annealing (TA) treatment achieved an impressive PCE of 13.4% with a Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 22.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.7%, while PSCs based on PM6:BFHIC shows a lower PCE of 8.7% under the same conditions. It is worth noting that the energy loss (Eloss) values were merely 0.52 eV and 0.58 eV for the PM6:BFHIC-based device and PM6:BFHIC-4F-based device, respectively, which is lower than most of the organic photovoltaic materials (usually 0.7–1.1 eV) and counterpart compounds having a fused BDT unit as the center core.28,29 Thus, the results demonstrate that multiple fused-ring BDF as the central D-unit is an effective strategy for the design of high-performance NF acceptors.

The molecular structures and synthetic route of BFHIC and BFHIC-4F are shown in Fig. 1a and Scheme S1 in ESI.† BFHIC and BFHIC-4F show good solubility in common solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB), o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), and chloroform (CF). In addition, BFHIC and BFHIC-4F also show good thermal stability with a 5% weight loss at 338 °C and 329 °C, respectively (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Further, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to evaluate the crystallinity of the compounds. As shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†), BFHIC-4F shows an endothermic melting peak at 246 °C and an exothermic crystallization peak at 238 °C in the process of heating and cooling, respectively. However, no obvious exothermic or endothermic peaks were observed for BFHIC. The better crystallinity of BFHIC-4F indicates ordered intermolecular π–π stacking, thus a higher mobility can be expected.

Fig. 1b shows the thin film UV-Vis absorption spectra of BFHIC and BFHIC-4F. The two compounds exhibited broad absorption ranging from 550 to 850 nm, with a similar absorption peak shape due to the same molecular skeleton. Compared with BFHIC, BFHIC-4F with four fluorine atoms as the outermost end of the molecule shows a redshifted maximum at 776 nm (766 nm for BFHIC). The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of BFHIC and BFHIC-4F were found to be 1.48 and 1.44 eV, according to the equation Eoptg = 1240/λedge, respectively. BFHIC and BFHIC-4F exhibit redshifted absorption spectra in a thin film relative to those in the solution (with a maximum peak at 736 and 750 nm, respectively), as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). In addition, the absorption peaks of donor material PM6 were also obtained for a clear comparison. In the range of 300–900 nm, PM6 and the acceptors exhibited complementary absorption, which is beneficial to the full utilization of sunlight, and thus a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) can be observed. The maximum absorption coefficient of the BFHIC film at 766 nm was 0.86 × 105 cm−1, while the BFHIC-4F film showed a higher maximum absorption coefficient of 0.98 × 105 cm−1 at 776 nm due to its closer intermolecular stacking. The high extinction coefficient and wide absorption are beneficial to capture the sunlight and enhance the Jsc of the device. It is worth noting that the absorption of BFHIC and BFHIC-4F films were significantly red-shifted compared with that of BTH-2F/BTC-2F, which possesses a similar structure with heptacyclic benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) as a central donor unit, as reported before.
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to determine the electronic energy levels of BFHIC and BFHIC-4F (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The HOMO energy level (EHOMO) values of BFHIC and BFHIC-4F were calculated to be −5.61 eV and −5.63 eV, respectively, according to the equation, EHOMO = −e(φox + 4.71) (eV), where the unit of φox is V vs. Ag/Ag+. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO) values were −3.83 eV and −3.99 eV, respectively, according to the equation, ELUMO = −(φred + 4.71) (eV). Remarkably, there is a large energy level difference observed between the LUMO of acceptors and the HOMO of PM6, which is positively correlated with the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Furthermore, the small HOMO level offset (0.11 eV for PM6:BFHIC and 0.13 eV for PM6:BFHIC-4F) between PM6 and the acceptors would be beneficial for obtaining smaller Eloss in PSCs. Compared with BTH-2F/BTC-2F, both BFHIC and BFHIC-4F shows a deeper or similar HOMO level, which is beneficial to obtain a higher Voc.
In addition, we studied the influence of introducing a BDF core into the molecular backbone of SMA on charge transport properties, and measured via the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (see Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†). The μe values of BFHIC and BFHIC-4F were 2.72 × 10−4 and 6.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh values of PM6:BFHIC-4F and PM6:BFHIC blend films were found to be >10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 order of magnitude. Compared with BDT-based SMA, BDF-based SMA exhibited higher or comparable charge transport properties. Combining the UV-vis absorption spectra and the electrochemical performance, we believed that the redshift of the absorption, the reduced energy level, and the enhanced charge transfer performance of BDF-based SMA might be due to the enhanced intermolecular interactions compared to BDT-based SMA.
In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of the NF acceptors, an inverted structure PSCs of ITO/ZnO-NP/PFN-Br/PM6:acceptor/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) was fabricated. We initially tried to explore the optimal performance of the device under different conditions (as shown in Fig. S4–S9 and Tables S2–S7, ESI†), such as solvents, donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio, solvent additives, TA temperatures, and time. The results demonstrated that the optimal photovoltaic performance of the devices based on PM6:BFHIC-4F was achieved with CB as a solvent, D:A of 1:1.5, 0.75% 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) as an additive, and TA treatment at 120 °C for 20 min. The PM6:BFHIC-4F-based device obtained an impressive PCE of 13.4%, with a high Voc of 0.87 V, high Jsc of 22.8 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.7%. The high-efficiency photovoltaic performance was mainly due to the matching energy levels and the complementary absorption between the donor and acceptor material as well as the high μe of BFHIC-4F, which is attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the fluorine atom. However, the device based on PM6:BFHIC showed a lower PCE of 8.7%, which is mainly due to lower Jsc. The J–V curves, EQE curves, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of optimal PSCs based on PM6:BFHIC and PM6:BFHIC-4F are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 for a clear comparison.

The devices based on PM6:BFHIC and PM6:BFHIC-4F showed broad photoresponse in the range of 300–850 nm. The optimal device of PM6:BFHIC-4F displayed a maximum EQE value of 78.2% at 583 nm.
It is worth noting that the device based on PM6:BFHIC-4F exhibited a higher Jsc and FF than the PM6:BFHIC-based device, which demonstrates a more effective exciton dissociation, charge collection efficiency, and photo-induced charge transfer between PM6 and BFHIC-4F. In addition, both the two devices showed a high Voc, and thus the energy losses (Eloss, defined as Eloss = Eg – qVoc) were analyzed to help us understand the deep reason. Unlike Eoptg, here, Eg determined from the EQE edge (as shown in Fig. S10, ESI†) was relatively easy to implement and it led to physical motivation.36–38Eg of the PM6:BFHIC-4F film was determined to be 1.45 eV, and thus the calculated Eloss was 0.58 eV. Although the Eg of PM6:BFHIC was 1.50 eV due to the high Voc (0.97 V) of the PM6:BFHIC-based device, a smaller Eloss of 0.52 eV was achieved. The small Eloss was more outstanding in similar materials. The non-radiative voltage loss (ΔVnon-rad) plays a crucial role in improving the Voc of the device. We measured the ΔVnon-rad of the device by electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQEEL) to further enhance the Voc of the device in the follow-up work (Fig. S11, ESI†). ΔVnon-rad can be calculated according to the equation of ΔVnon-rad = −(kBT/q) lnEQEEL (kB is Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, and q is an elementary charge). As a result, the device based on the PM6:BFHIC blend film showed higher EQEEL values than the PM6:BFHIC-4F-based device. The corresponding ΔVnon-rad values were calculated to be 0.20 V and 0.27 eV, respectively. The smaller ΔVnon-rad contributed majorly to enhance the Voc of the M6:BFHIC-based device. These results demonstrate that BFH as a core unit is a promising building block in NF SMA materials, and the device based on the PM6:BFHIC-4F blend film is a potential candidate for the high-performance PSCs in the future.
To further explore the deeper reason for the high Jsc and FF of the devices, hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) were measured by the SCLC method, as shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†). Compared with BFHIC, the pure film of BFHIC-4F exhibited a higher μe of 6.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, benefiting from its good coplanarity and strong crystallinity. As for the optimal blend film, the μh values of PM6:BFHIC-4F and PM6:BFHIC were found to be 1.85 × 10−3 and 1.64 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, mainly due to the contribution of PM6. While the μe of PM6:BFHIC-4F and PM6:BFHIC films were calculated to be 5.89 × 10−4 and 3.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, the corresponding μh/μe values swere 3.1 and 5.4. The fact shows that PSCs based on PM6:FHIC-4F with relatively higher mobility and more balanced μh/μe value was more beneficial to obtain a higher Jsc and FF.
The crystalline properties of BFHIC-4F and BFHIC were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown Fig. S12 (ESI†), both BFHIC-4F and BFHIC exhibited similar broad diffraction peaks at 2θ = ∼25.4°, corresponding to a π–π stacking d-spacing of 3.50 Å, and this close intermolecular π–π stacking was beneficial to charge transport.
In order to further confirm the strong crystallinity and the compact intermolecular π–π stacking of BFHIC-4F and BFHIC, a theoretical calculation was performed by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level. As shown in Fig. S13 in ESI,† the molecular orbital distributions indicated that the HOMO energy levels of BFHIC-4F and BFHIC were mainly delocalized on the seven-fused central donor unit, while the LUMO energy levels of BFHIC-4F and BFHIC were mainly localized on the molecular backbone. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels were −5.41 eV and −3.48 eV for BFHIC-4F, and −5.28 eV and −3.32 eV for BFHIC, respectively. Thus, both BFHIC-4F and BFHIC showed a nearly linear coplanar molecular skeleton conformation from the sideview, which is beneficial for intermolecular π–π stacking and for enhancing the crystallinity of the materials.
The dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) were measured to study the exciton dissociation and charge collection process of PM6:BFHIC-4F-based and PM6:BFHIC-based devices under the optimized conditions. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero, and V is the applied voltage. When the Jph reached saturation (Jsat) at large Veff (Veff ≥ 2 V), all of the photogenerated excitons dissociated into free carriers and were collected by the electrodes. Thus, the exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)) can be estimated from the Jph/Jsat ratio.39 As shown in Fig. 3a, the optimal device based on PM6:BFHIC-4F showed Jph/Jsat ratios of 94.68% and 81.61% under the short-circuit and maximum power output conditions, respectively. In contrast, the PM6:BFHIC-based device showed a lower Jph/Jsat ratio of 90.27% under short-circuit conditions and 70.04% under maximum power output conditions. The result thus implies that the recombination loss was much lower for the PM6:BFHIC-4F device, thereby leading to a more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency, which is consistent with the high Jsc and FF values.

The dependencies of Voc and Jph under different light intensities were measured to understand the charge recombination mechanism. The slope of Vocversus ln(Plight) can evaluate the degree of trap-assisted or bimolecular recombination. The bimolecular recombination was dominant when the slope value was close to 1 kBT/q, while the slope of 2kBT/q suggested that the dominant recombination mechanism was trap-assisted recombination.40 As shown in Fig. 3b, the optimal devices based on PM6:BFHIC-4F and PM6:BFHIC showed a slope of 1.01kT/q and 1.04kT/q, respectively, indicating that bimolecular recombination was dominant in the devices based on two acceptors. In addition, the relationship between Jph and Plight can be described by Jph ∝ (Plight)S, where S implies the extent of the bimolecular recombination. The S values close to 1 indicate that the devices show weak bimolecular recombination.41 As shown in Fig. 3c, the devices based on PM6:BFHIC-4F shows the S value of 0.97, while the PM6:BFHIC-based device shows the S value of 0.92, indicating that the device based on PM6:BFHIC-4F has less bimolecular recombination.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were adopted to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge transport processes. As shown in Fig. 3(d–f), compared to those of the pure films, the PL quenching efficiencies of the PM6:BFHIC-4F blend film were 96% and 93% when the excitation wavelength were 580 nm and 700 nm, respectively. However, the PL quenching efficiencies of the PM6:BFHIC blend film were 80% and 90%, with the excitation wavelength of 580 nm and 700 nm, respectively. The high PL quenching efficiencies of the PM6:BFHIC-4F blend film were consistent with the high Jsc and EQE values of the devices. The results indicate that the photo-induced charge transfer between PM6 and BFHIC-4F was more effective.
To further explore the morphological characteristics of the active layers, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the surface and bulk morphology, with the corresponding images being shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that both PM6:BFHIC-4F and PM6:BFHIC blend films showed homogeneous surfaces with a root mean square (RMS) roughness values of 1.51 nm and 1.54 nm, respectively. Moreover, no obvious large aggregates were observed in the phase images. In order to more intuitively see the subtle difference between PM6:BFHIC-4F and PM6:BFHIC, we presented the three-dimensional height images, as shown in Fig. S14 in ESI.† The TEM images of PM6:BFHIC-4F and PM6:BFHIC blend films also demonstrated a similar fibrous morphology with small-size aggregation. Actually, the active layer with a fine interpenetrating network structure can effectively promote the exciton dissociation and charge transfer, which correspond to the higher photovoltaic performance of the devices.

In summary, we finely optimized the central donor units of A–D–A-type SMA and investigated the applications in PSCs. We designed and synthesized two new SMA materials, BFHIC-4F and BFHIC, which consisted of BFH central D-units with bithienyl-BDF as a core and IC/IC2F as A-end groups. The materials exhibited strong crystallinity, ordered intermolecular π–π stacking, and enhanced photovoltaic performance compared to the analogues with BDT as a core. The device based on PM6:BFHIC-4F showed better morphology features, which enhanced the charge transport and suppressed the charge recombination effectively. As a result, the optimal PSCs showed a higher PCE of 13.4% with a Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 22.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.7%. For the PM6:BFHIC blend, lower mobility was observed, thus affecting the photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, we noted that both PM6:BFHIC-4F and PM6:BFHIC blends exhibited a small Eloss (0.58 eV and 0.52 eV, respectively) in the devices, demonstrating a more effectively exciton dissociation, charge collection efficiency, and photo-induced charge transfer between PM6 and BFH-based acceptor materials. Therefore, these results demonstrated that BFH as a central unit is a promising building block in NF SMA materials, and the device based on PM6:BFHIC-4F blend film is a potential candidate for the high-performance PSCs in the future. Thus, we believe that the fine optimization of the molecular structure of the photovoltaic materials with conjugated backbones has a great significance in fully exploring their photovoltaic performance.
