    , Accepted 9th November 2013First published on 11th November 2013AbstractIn this work a hydrogenated under-stoichiometric tungsten oxide is introduced as an efficient anode interlayer in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The benefits of hydrogen incorporation into the oxide lattice for obtaining desirable properties of tungsten oxides are explored. These benefits include the occupation of gap states near the Fermi level, which may facilitate charge transport, and the maintenance of a high work function, nearly similar to that of the stoichiometric tungsten oxide, which contributes to the formation of a large interfacial dipole at the anode interface and enhances charge extraction. A large improvement was achieved in the operational characteristics – especially in the open-circuit voltage – of bulk heterojunction solar cells based on different polymeric donors, namely poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, or poly[(9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl], PCDTBT, and the fullerene acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester, PC71BM, that incorporated a hydrogenated tungsten oxide as an anode interlayer. This improvement was correlated with the devices' incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) and impedance measurements. Furthermore, an increase in both the device's flat-band voltage (Vfb) and the doping level of the organic semiconductor was measured in P3HT:PC71BM based devices by Mott–Schottky capacitance analysis. Additional benefits are the large process window established for the devices incorporating the hydrogenated tungsten oxide as an anode interlayer and the maintenance of a high PCE (>80% of its initial efficiency) over 50 days, demonstrating good long-term stability, which is much better than that of the conventional devices based on PEDOT:PSS. The results suggest that the interface engineering with hydrogen-treated metal oxide interlayers is an important strategy to develop highly performing and stable organic photovoltaics.
Introduction
In a world of ever-increasing energy demands and need for renewable energy sources, photovoltaics are becoming an increasingly appealing option for energy production. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells offer potential alternatives to conventional inorganic solar cells, as they combine advantages such as low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility and amenability to manufacture by high-throughput, large-area, reel-to-reel coating processes.1–7 To date, polymeric PV cells have reached certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 10%,8–10 while Heliatek recently reported 12% efficiency for small molecule photovoltaic cells. Regarding the polymeric PV cells, the most successful device architectures presented thus far have been based on a photoactive layer composed of a blend of a polymeric donor and a fullerene acceptor, which form a phase-separated bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanostructured network in order to provide a large interfacial area for exciton dissociation. When photo-excited, the polymeric component acts as an electron donor and transporter of holes to the cell anode, while the fullerene acts as an electron acceptor and transporter of electrons to the cell cathode.11–13 Despite the fact that the large BHJ interfacial contact area facilitates exciton separation into free carriers at the donor/acceptor interfaces, thereby enhancing charge generation, charge recombination still remains a significant loss mechanism both at the donor/acceptor and the active layer/electrode interfaces.14 One way to overcome this last issue is to suppress energetic losses at the interfaces to the greatest extent possible. An effective anode/cathode interlayer could, in principle, achieve this goal through enhancing the electrode–organic interfacial physical and electrical contact.
The commonly used anode interlayer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)15–17 is moisture-sensitive, electrically/structurally inhomogeneous, and rapidly degrades ITO at elevated temperatures.18,19 Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have recently drawn a great deal of interest, since it was found that certain oxides decrease the hole extraction barriers when placed as a thin layer between the anode and the organic layer.20 The barriers of hole extraction from the organic materials to the metallic anode are generally large due to the unfavorable energy level alignment, which depends on the work function of the metal and the magnitude of the interfacial dipole.20,21 With the incorporation of a metal oxide layer between the anode contact and the photoactive layer, hole extraction barriers can be significantly reduced.20 Indeed, TMOs such as MoO3,22–26 WO3,27–30 V2O5,31,32 and NiOx33,34 have successfully replaced PEDOT:PSS as hole collecting layers due to their environmental stability, high work function and ability to exchange charges with several organic semiconductors. However, most such oxides are wide band-gap semiconductors, adding a series resistance to the device. This resistance makes the device performance very sensitive to the oxide layer thickness, which, however, should be kept to a minimum.
Recently, important research progress has been made on the use of oxygen-deficient metal oxides to enhance hole extraction through the formation of gap states arising from oxygen vacancies.35–39 Our group has recently explored the benefits of hydrogen ion (H+) intercalation in the MoO3 lattice to form hydrogen molybdenum bronzes (HyMoO3−x), which exhibit gap states near their Fermi level, while maintaining their high work function, thus, allowing energetic alignment at the anode/organic interface.22 Herein we report on the use of hydrogenated under-stoichiometric tungsten oxides (HyWO3−x) as hole collection interlayers in organic photovoltaic cells, which were prepared under similar conditions to those used for the hydrogen molybdenum bronzes. Despite the fact that MoO3 exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure,40 while WO3 is a three-dimensional (3D) material,41 we present here experimental evidence that shows that the hydrogenation of the latter is just as effective as that of the former. In particular, we show that the hydrogenated under-stoichiometric tungsten oxides also exhibit gap states located near the Fermi level, which are beneficial for charge transport, and they maintain a high work function that permits the enhancement of the device built-in field through the formation of a large interfacial dipole at the anode/organic interface. The latter is a clear benefit in comparison with an oxygen-deficient tungsten oxide (WO3−x) layer, as it is also shown here. These results demonstrate the universality of our approach for the preparation of hydrogenated (hydrogen-doped) metal oxides with desired electronic properties, which can be used as efficient charge selective interlayers in organic optoelectronic devices. In addition, we present here evidence for the enhanced doping level of the polymeric donor, when the hydrogenated tungsten oxide is used as an anode interlayer, based on results from Mott–Schottky capacitance analysis. Enhanced PCEs and exceptional long term stabilities were achieved by incorporating the hydrogenated tungsten oxide anode interlayer into OPV cells, regardless of the specific donor–acceptor combination employed. In particular, a large enhancement in the device short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) resulted in achieving high PCE values of 4.1% and 6.0% in devices using HyWO3−x to improve hole extraction in OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC71BM) and poly[(9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl)-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl]:[6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PC71BM) as active layers, respectively.
Results and discussion
Tungsten oxide electronic structure evaluation by X-ray and ultraviolet (XPS/UPS) photoelectron spectroscopy
We first prepared tungsten oxide films under different conditions. In particular, we deposited W oxide films in O2, in N2 exposed to atomic hydrogen42 and in pure H2 environment. As shown next, the first films are composed of stoichiometric material (WO3), the second films are under-stoichiometric (WO3−x) and the last ones contain hydrogen bonded to oxygen ions (HyWO3−x). The chemical composition and the electronic structure of these films were studied by XPS and UPS, respectively. The XPS wide scan spectra (not presented) show that W and O are present in all three films. The binding energy (BE) values of W 4f and O 1s peaks are shown in Fig. 1. In particular, in Fig. 1a the decomposition of the W 4f photoemission peak for the film deposited in an O2 environment was performed using two equal width peaks with the binding energy of W 4f7/2 centered at 36.0 ± 0.1 eV. The spin–orbit splitting of the doublet is 2.13 eV (with a peak ratio of 4:3). The position and shape of these peaks are representative of W atoms with an oxidation state of +6, as expected for stoichiometric WO3.43,44 For the films deposited either in N2 (with 1 hydrogen pulse) or in H2 environment (Fig. 1b and c, respectively) the W 4f peak becomes broader, indicating that new spectral features appear. The deconvolution of these spectra includes a new doublet with spin–orbit splitting and peak ratio fixed at 2.13 eV and 4:3 respectively, with all peak widths being equal to the peak width of the W 4f7/2 in Fig. 1a. The binding energy of W 4f7/2 of the new doublet is 34.8 eV and is attributed to the presence of W5+ atoms, indicating that both films are under-stoichiometric (reduced),45,46 with nearly the same degree of reduction as revealed from the contribution of the W5+ states to the overall cation states in both films. Fig. S1† illustrates the hydrogenation and oxygen vacancy formation mechanisms. Note that a challenge of this study was to deposit hydrogenated and oxygen-deficient tungsten oxides with similar degree of reduction in order to fairly compare their influence on the device performance.
 Fig. 1  XPS W 4f and O 1s core level spectra of the tungsten oxide films deposited in different environments: (a), (b) and (c) show the XPS W 4f spectra of tungsten oxides deposited in O2, N2 (with the injection of a H2 pulse) and H2, respectively; (d), (e) and (f) show the corresponding XPS O 1s spectra. 
The O 1s photoemission peaks are also presented in Fig. 1 (right side). The O 1s BEs for all TMOs are generally between 529.5 and 530.5 eV. The XPS O 1s spectra of stoichiometric WO3 and of that deposited in N2 environment with simultaneous exposure to atomic hydrogen (curves d and e) are found to peak at 530.6 eV BE, which is assigned to the typical W–O bond.47 However, the O 1s XPS peak becomes quite broad (increasing FWHM) for the tungsten oxide film deposited in H2 environment (curve f), while the deconvolution of this peak reveals an extra peak (beyond the typical oxide region) at 532.5 eV BE, which could be assigned to hydroxyl groups (–OH) incorporated into the lattice. According to all the above findings, films deposited in N2 rich environment with simultaneous exposure to atomic hydrogen are considered under-stoichiometric and can be chemically described as WO3−x. Those deposited in pure H2 are also under-stoichiometric with nearly the same degree of reduction (similar x) and moreover they incorporate hydrogen atoms into their lattice. These are hereafter termed as hydrogenated or hydrogen-doped and described with the formula HyWO3−x.

Fig. 2 shows the corresponding UPS spectra of the tungsten oxide films. In Fig. 2a and c the high binding energy cut-off and the near Fermi level region, respectively, of the UPS spectra are shown, while in Fig. 2b the expanded view of these spectra is also presented. It can be seen that the UPS spectra of these oxides exhibit two main peaks (Fig. 2b). The first peak is attributed to the O 2p orbitals (the π band of the top of the valence band in accordance with Goodenough's model for Re2O3,48–51 see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and lies around 6.0 eV below the EF, while the second one arises from the W 5d–O 2p orbital mixing (the σ band) and appears at BEs between 13.0 and 14.0 eV below EF. Although the energy positions of the main features in all three spectra are nearly the same, the three spectra differ significantly in the relative intensities of the peaks.

Fig. 2a shows the evolution of the high BE cut-off region of the UPS spectra for the above W oxides. The WO3 work function (WF) is about 6.0 eV, which is in accordance with values reported in the literature for ex situ prepared and air-exposed samples.52 For the hydrogenated HyWO3−x, the estimated WF value of 5.8 eV is close to the value of the stoichiometric one and well above 5.3 eV, which is the WF value measured for the oxygen-deficient WO3−x film. The significant reduction of the WF value of the oxygen-deficient WO3−x film relative to both the stoichiometric and hydrogenated ones may have a negative impact on the device performance, since it could prevent the favourable energy level alignment at the anode contact.23
The most striking difference of the UPS line shape between the under-stoichiometric W oxides versus the stoichiometric one is the appearance of new features near the EF: a narrow one centered at 0.8 eV for the hydrogenated oxide and a broad one consisting of two main peaks at 0.8 eV and at 2.2 eV below the EF for the WO3−x (Fig. 2c). These bands are indicative of new occupied states forming inside the band gap with a relatively large density. Regarding their origin, these bands are attributed to the occupation of W 5d orbitals with t2g symmetry in the reduced tungsten oxides.48,49 In the oxygen-deficient tungsten oxide (WO3−x), a portion of the electrons coming from the oxygen vacancies (maximum two electrons per oxygen vacancy) is transferred to this initially empty 5dt2g (π* in the Goodenough's model, Fig. S2†) metallic orbitals, which are located partially at the edge of the conduction band and partially within the band gap, near the Fermi level.49 In the hydrogenated tungsten oxide (HyWO3−x), hydrogen cations, which are bonded to terminal oxygens forming thus hydroxyl groups, also act as electron donors to these d bands of WO3. However, because H–O σ bonding competes with the ionic pπ orbitals that π bond with the tungsten ions, introduction of the H cations narrows substantially these 5dt2g bands,49 as it is evident from the near EF region of the UPS spectra. Consequently, hydrogenation creates shallow-donor states in the oxide's electronic structure. In contrast, the nearest to the valence band edge peak is also well occupied in the case of the oxygen-deficient tungsten oxide, which means that oxygen vacancies act as both shallow and deep-donors in tungsten oxide. These differences arise from the different reduction mechanisms to which the two oxides are subjected (Fig. S2†).53–56 However, in both cases, donor states are formed, lying near the Fermi level, allowing thus the charge carriers to be transported within the device.
The influence of tungsten oxide layers on the OPV cell performance
To substantiate the impact of the above findings on the device operation, we next fabricated OPV cells incorporating the formulated tungsten oxides as hole selective interlayers. The device architecture was glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/tungsten oxide film (3 nm for the stoichiometric and 10 nm for the under-stoichiometric ones)/active layer (100 nm)/W-POM-12 (5 nm)/Al and it is shown in Fig. 3a. The electron selective polyoxometalate-based interlayer, i.e. 12-tungstophosphoric acid (W-POM-12), which was recently introduced by our group,57,58 was processed from solution in methanol (in which most conjugated polymers are insoluble) to form layers with a thickness around 5 nm. Reference devices incorporating the PEDOT:PSS as an anode interlayer were also fabricated for comparison. The active layer was based on either P3HT or PCDTBT as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor (the materials' chemical structures are depicted in Fig. 3a). The corresponding energy level alignment in the above device structure is shown in Fig. 3b. The conduction band edge of tungsten oxides was estimated by subtracting the optical band gap (Fig. S3†) from the valence band edge; the HOMO and WF values of the organic photoactive components were determined by UPS measurements (Fig. S4 and S5†), while their LUMO values were estimated by taking into account the optical gap derived from absorption measurements (not shown).

An important observation is that for the under-stoichiometric tungsten oxides the occupied gap states near the Fermi level may act as favourable paths to enhance charge transport within the metal oxide film. Based on the above, one could infer that an improved OPV cell efficiency may be expected after the insertion of both WO3−x and HyWO3−x films as hole selective layers. At first, devices based on the P3HT:PC71BM active layer were fabricated and characterized. In Fig. 4a the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPV devices under AM 1.5G illumination are presented. It is evident that the incorporation of both oxygen-deficient and hydrogenated tungsten oxides induces a large improvement in short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 8.2 and 8.4 mA cm−2 for the reference devices with WO3 and PEDOT:PSS anode interlayers, respectively, to 9.8 mA cm−2 (20% improvement towards reference devices with WO3) and further to 10.4 mA cm−2 (27% improvement) for the devices with the oxygen-deficient and hydrogenated tungsten oxides, respectively (the maximum recorded and mean values of their operational characteristics are summarized in Table 1). Similarly, the fill factor (FF) is improved from 0.52 and 0.53 for the reference devices with WO3 and PEDOT:PSS to 0.57 and 0.59 for the devices with WO3−x and HyWO3−x, respectively. Moreover, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) increases from 0.58 V and 0.59 V for the devices with the WO3 and PEDOT:PSS layers to 0.63 V and further to 0.67 V for the ones with the WO3−x and HyWO3−x layers, respectively. It can be seen that the improvement in Voc is significantly larger in the device with the hydrogenated tungsten oxide. As a consequence, a high PCE of 4.1% was estimated for this device, which is significantly larger compared with both the reference devices and the one with the oxygen-deficient tungsten oxide interlayer.

The above findings are further supported by the dark current versus voltage characteristics presented in Fig. 4b. It can be clearly seen that the device with the oxygen-deficient tungsten oxide layer exhibits a larger turn-on voltage (in the range of 0.55–0.65 V) relative to both reference devices (0.45–0.55 V), while that with the hydrogenated tungsten oxide layer exhibits a turn-on voltage in the range of 0.60–0.70 V. This implies that the built-in potential (Vbi) across the device, which is the voltage responsible for exciton dissociation and the upper limit for the attainable Voc, is increased upon WO3−x layer insertion and even further upon HyWO3−x layer utilization. In addition, a large increase of the diode's forward current and suppression of the reverse current after the incorporation of both under-stoichiometric tungsten oxides are observed. This proves that the introduction of these oxide layers creates a highly conductive path for hole extraction, which can also explain the enhanced FF of these devices. This is also supported by the Nyquist plots presented in Fig. 4c, where a clear reduction of the series resistance is observed in the under-stoichiometric bearing devices. The WO3−x and HyWO3−x modified devices exhibit series resistances of 6 Ω cm2 and 5 Ω cm2, respectively, relative to 18 Ω cm2 and 15 Ω cm2 of the WO3 and PEDOT:PSS incorporating devices. From these data, it is obvious that the interelectrode transport is easier in the case of the device modified with the under-stoichiometric tungsten oxide interlayer, which can explain the enhancement in its Jsc and FF.

Fig. 4d shows a comparison of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the above devices. The devices with the PEDOT:PSS and WO3 layers show the typical spectral response of P3HT:PC71BM blends with a maximum IPCE of ∼61% and 57%, which are consistent with previous studies for P3HT:PC71BM devices exhibiting similar short-circuit currents and overall external quantum efficiencies.2 For the devices with the WO3−x and, especially, with the HyWO3−x interlayer, (which reaches maximum values of about 78%) the results demonstrate an enhancement up to 28%, as compared to the reference devices with PEDOT:PSS, in the IPCE over the entire spectral region, where the photoactive layer absorbs. These values are correlated with the corresponding enhancements in short-circuit currents measured in the under-stoichiometric modified devices relative to the two reference devices. We argue that the enhanced IPCEs in the devices incorporating under-stoichiometric and hydrogenated tungsten oxide layers are mainly attributed to the corresponding enhanced extraction rates through the occupied gap states of these layers. However, there is a clear difference between the IPCEs (and also Jsc and FF) of the device bearing the oxygen-deficient layer relative to the device embedding the hydrogenated tungsten oxide with the latter being more efficient. Since gap states appear in both under-stoichiometric tungsten oxides, permitting thus efficient charge transport within these states, and both of them act nearly similarly as optical spacers59 (as it was revealed from the simulated results presented in Fig. S6†), the origin of the above differences – and also of the difference in Voc – should be sought somewhere else.
To gain some insight into this divergence between the devices with the different tungsten oxide anode interlayers, we recorded their capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics (Fig. 5a). C–V measurements in devices based on organic semiconductors usually exhibit Mott–Schottky characteristics and can be used to estimate the device flat-band voltage (Vfb) and the organic semiconductor doping level. To this end, in Fig. 5b the Mott–Schottky characteristics are shown, as derived from the C–V measurements of the OPV cells embedding tungsten oxides, where C−2 = (2/qεN) (Vfb − V), ε ≈ εo is the permittivity of the blend, N is the doping level and q is the elementary charge.60 The Mott–Schottky analysis in Fig. 5b allows determination of (a) the flat band potential from the intercept of the linear part of the curve with the voltage axis and (b) the doping level from the C−2–V slope. More specifically, the origin of the flat-band voltage can be explained as follows: after the contact of the organic semiconductor with the ITO/tungsten oxide modified anodes, there exists an energy level offset between the P3HT polymer (Φp = 4.4 eV, Fig. S4†) and the tungsten oxide modified anode (Φox = 6.0, 5.3, 5.8 eV for WO3, WO3−x, HyWO3−x modified ITO, respectively, see Fig. 2). The work function difference is related to the flat-band potential as Vfb = Φox − Φp. It is expected that the larger the WF of the oxide the higher the flat-band voltage (or equivalent the built-in potential, Vbi) in the device. Note that it is assumed that cathode interfaces do not affect the Vfb differences between cells, because they all have the same organic layer/W-POM-12/Al cathode interface. Thus, for P3HT:PC71BM based solar cells with a stoichiometric WO3 anode interlayer we obtain a Vfb of 0.41 V. With the incorporation of the oxygen-deficient WO3−x and especially of the hydrogenated HyWO3−x anode interlayers, the Vfb increases to 0.49 V and further to 0.58 V. This increase in Vfb matches the increase in Voc and indicates that the insertion of the hydrogenated tungsten oxide that exhibits a high work function – nearly similar to that of the stoichiometric one – induces strengthening of the device built-in field. However, the device with the stoichiometric WO3 with the highest WF exhibits the smallest Vfb, in contrast to what was discussed above. This could probably originate from other parameters that may affect the energetic alignment at the anode contact, such as the absence of gap states and the nearly insulating nature of the tungsten trioxide.

Capacitance was measured in the dark and at room temperature. (b) Mott–Schottky characteristics of the OPV cells, exhibiting a linear relationship (straight lines) at low forward bias. Flat-band potential Vfb and doping level N are indicated for each curve. 
Another important point derived from the Mott–Schottky analysis is the density of organic semiconductor (P3HT) dopants. From Fig. 5b it turns out that the density of dopants is larger for OPV cells embedding the hydrogenated tungsten oxide (N = 6.3 × 1016 cm−3) in comparison with the cells embedding the oxygen-deficient tungsten oxide (N = 3.1 × 1016 cm−3) by a factor of 2 and especially for the cells embedding the stoichiometric tungsten oxide (N = 1.2 × 1016 cm−3) by a factor of 3. Because the linear part of the C−2–V relationship appears at voltages near the Vfb, the extracted doping level corresponds to the charge density in the vicinity of the anode contact. The larger charge density near the contact may cause a shift of the polymer Fermi level downwards (approaching the polymer HOMO) and is thus beneficial for charge transfer to the contact. Regarding the origin of the enhanced doping level of the polymer (P3HT) when the hydrogenated tungsten oxide is used as an anode interlayer, it can be explained as follows: on the surface of tungsten oxides, even in the case of the fully stoichiometric tungsten trioxide, point defects are usually present, the vast majority of which being negatively charged oxygen vacancies. When this negative space charge is present at the anode interface, holes can be transported from P3HT and recombine with the trapped electrons in oxygen vacancies. This constitutes a de-doping process of the p-type P3HT. In contrast, in the hydrogenated tungsten oxide, oxygen vacancies are filled with hydrogen atoms causing the elimination of the negative space charge and, consequently, holes are blocked by the large energy barrier at the P3HT (HOMO at −5.6 eV)/HyWO3−x interface (VB at −7.7 eV) (see Fig. 3b).
Thickness optimization of different tungsten oxide anode interlayers and stability studies
To further characterize the tungsten oxides as selective anode interlayers, we evaluated the impact of their thickness on the device performance. Fig. 6a–d show the dependence of PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF of OPV cells on the thickness of each tungsten oxide. In the case of WO3, it can be seen that the device performance largely depends on the variation of the oxide layer thickness. When the thickness of the WO3 layer increases above 3 nm, the device operational characteristics deteriorate. This is a result of the insulating nature of the stoichiometric tungsten trioxide. In contrast, for both under-stoichiometric tungsten oxides there is a small variation in their operational characteristics at a thickness range from 5 nm to 30 nm, with an optimum at a thickness of 10 nm. However, upon increasing the thickness of the WO3−x layer to 50 nm, the PCE drops from its optimum value of 3.4% (corresponding to 10 nm) to nearly 2% (Fig. 6a), as a consequence of a similar drop of Jsc (Fig. 6b) and a smaller drop in Voc (Fig. 6c) as well as in FF (Fig. 6d). We argue that this deterioration of the device performance after a certain thickness of the under-stoichiometric tungsten oxide film is probably due to the increase of the device series resistance (a series resistance of 12 Ω cm2 was extracted from J–V characteristics for devices with WO3−x layers thicker than 30 nm), which implies a reduced oxide conductivity. For the devices embedding the hydrogenated tungsten oxide, a quite smaller trend for underperformance can be observed, when the oxide thickness is well above 30 nm. This proves that there is a larger process window for hydrogen treated tungsten oxides, when they are used as anode interlayers in organic electronic devices.

Apart from high efficiency, long-term device stability is also a particularly important prerequisite for organic solar cells. Therefore, there is a need to examine the stability of these OPV cells incorporating tungsten oxides compared with devices based on a PEDOT:PSS layer for hole extraction. The device stability of the OPV cells with various tungsten oxides and PEDOT:PSS layers as a function of storage time under ambient conditions is shown in Fig. 7. A fast drop in all operational characteristics (PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF) of the reference device with the PEDOT:PSS layer was observed, resulting in a nearly zero current after 20 days. The fast degradation of devices based on PEDOT:PSS hole collection layers has generally been reported by several groups,17,18 and it is attributed to the highly acidic nature of the PSS component. In contrast, all the devices embedding the tungsten oxide anode interlayers exhibit good device stability and their PCEs can maintain approximately >80% of their original values, even after storage in air for 50 days. In particular, both Voc and FF over this long period remain relatively constant (Fig. 7c and d), with a slight decrease in Jsc (Fig. 7b), leading to PCEs with a rather small degradation. While it is generally known that device degradation can be slowed down with encapsulation techniques, the approach presented here is easy to be implemented and cost effective. The incorporation of tungsten oxides at the anode/organic interface may prevent the diffusion of moisture and oxygen into the BHJ layer, thereby enhancing the device stability. The slower degradation rate of the tungsten oxide-modified solar cells may be indicative of their potential role as efficient protective layers. It is expected that the device stability and lifetime could be further improved by the use of some more advanced encapsulation technologies for organic solar cells.

Finally, in order to demonstrate the universality of using hydrogen-doped tungsten oxides as effective hole collection layers in OPV cells, we also fabricated devices based on the recently introduced highly performing donor polymer PCDTBT.61 In Fig. 8a and b the photocurrent and dark current J–V characteristics of OPV cells with the structure ITO/tungsten oxide (5 nm or 10 nm)/PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4) (90 nm)/W-POM-12 (5 nm)/Al are shown. The incorporation of sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxides was proven again beneficial for the device performance towards the control device. In particular, the Voc, Jsc and FF were increased from 0.80 V, 8.9 mA cm−2 and 0.56 for the device based on WO3 to 0.84 V, 9.9 mA cm−2 and 0.62 for the device based on WO3−x and further to 0.89 V, 10.5 mA cm−2 and 0.64 for the device based on HyWO3−x (Table 2). As a result, a high efficiency of 6.0% was calculated for the highest performance device based on the hydrogenated tungsten oxide in comparison with 3.9% and 5.2% for the devices with the WO3 and WO3−x layers, respectively. Overall, these results clearly indicate that the proposed approach is universal, regardless of the photoactive material combination used, and thus it provides a very simple and versatile method to optimize efficient and stable OPV cells, using already available functional photoactive materials.

Conclusions
This work represents the first study on the properties of a hydrogenated under-stoichiometric tungsten oxide layer and its influence on the OPV cell performance when it is used as a hole selective interlayer. High efficiencies were obtained for devices based on either P3HT or PCDTBT as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor, which were modified with the hydrogenated tungsten oxide as compared to devices incorporating oxygen-deficient and stoichiometric tungsten oxides. We have attributed these enhanced efficiencies to the more favourable electronic properties of the hydrogen-doped tungsten oxide, including the occupied gap states near the Fermi level for highly efficient charge transport and the maintenance of a high work function, nearly similar to that of the stoichiometric oxide. We presented a coherent picture by describing the J–V characteristics, the Nyquist plots, the IPCEs and C–V measurements of P3HT:PC71BM based OPVs with different tungsten oxide anode interlayers. The key point of the obtained results is the agreement between the flat-band potential, as extracted from the Mott–Schottky analysis of the reverse and low forward capacitance, and the open-circuit voltage of the OPV cells. It was further pointed out that when P3HT is deposited on top of the hydrogenated tungsten oxide surface, an increased doping level (higher density of holes in the polymer HOMO) is achieved. As a result of the optimized anode interface, high PCEs of 4.1% in the case of P3HT:PC71BM based devices and of 6.0% in the case of PCDTBT:PC71BM based devices were achieved. Additionally, it was found that the highest PCE of these OPVs retains >80% of its initial value over 50 days, demonstrating good long-term stability when compared to the conventional devices with PEDOT:PSS hole extraction layers. Our results highlight the important role of interface engineering of OPV devices and demonstrate that the use of hydrogen-treated metal oxide interlayers is a significant and promising strategy to develop efficient and stable organic photovoltaics.
Experimental section
Tungsten oxide film preparation
Stoichiometric WO3, oxygen-deficient WO3−x and hydrogenated HyWO3−x films were deposited using a previously reported hot-wire vapour deposition technique.42,52–64 The sample was positioned on an aluminum susceptor, 2.5 cm below a W filament, which was heated by a (AC) current flowing through two Cu leads. A PC-driven needle valve allowed the flow of O2, N2 (with a simultaneous injection of atomic hydrogen) or pure hydrogen through the reactor. After loading the substrate, the reactor was evacuated down to 10−2 Torr. Hot-wire W oxide films were deposited by heating the tungsten filament at 560 °C. The deposition rates were measured to be about 0.5 nm s−1 for the stoichiometric W oxide film and 0.25 nm s−1 for the oxygen-deficient and hydrogen-doped ones. During deposition the substrates remained near room temperature, depending on the deposition time, but without exceeding 50 °C.
X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
The oxides' stoichiometry was estimated using the XPS-measured W 4f and O 1s core-level spectra. To this extent, the areas under the photoemission peaks were integrated by fitting the O 1s and W 4f spectra with asymmetric Gaussian–Lorentzian curves. The raw data, after a Shirley background subtraction, were fitted by a non-linear least square routine using peaks with a mix of Gaussian–Lorentzian shape. The error is estimated at ±10% in all the XPS-derived atomic percentages. The valence band spectra of W oxides were evaluated after recording the UPS spectra of about 10 nm thick films deposited on an ITO substrate, taken from the batch used for OPV cell fabrication. For the UPS measurements, the He I (21.22 eV) excitation line was used. A negative bias of 12.28 V was applied to the samples during UPS measurements in order to separate sample and analyzer high binding energy (BE) cut-offs and estimate the absolute work function value from the high BE cut-off region of the UPS spectra. The analyzer resolution is determined from the width of the Au Fermi edge to be 0.16 eV. The unmonochromatized Mg Kα line at 1253.6 eV (15 keV with 20 mA anode current) and an analyzer (Leybold EA-11) pass energy of 100 eV, giving a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1.3 eV for the Au 4f7/2 peak were used in all X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectrum measurements. Regarding the UPS measurements, because the high intensity UV photons used in UPS measurements may alter the surface of metal oxide films, we adopted a certain protocol for the measurement of the oxides' work function: we first measure the core levels and work function of the sample using the low intensity X-rays, then we measure the work function with UPS and finally we measure again the core levels and work function with XPS to verify that the samples have remained unaffected.
Device fabrication and characterization
OPV devices were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates (2 × 2 cm2) with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω per square, which served as anode electrodes. Substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with a standard solvent regiment (15 min each in acetone and isopropanol). The W oxide layer with a thickness of approximately 5 nm for the stoichiometric and 10 nm for the under-stoichiometric ones was then deposited as described previously, followed by the deposition of an approximately 100 nm photoactive layer. The active layer consisted of either P3HT:PC71BM blend (1:0.8 wt% ratio) or PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4 wt% ratio) and it was spin-cast on top of the tungsten oxide film from a 10 mg ml−1 chloroform solution. After spin coating, the active layer was annealed at 120 °C for 10 min in air. Then, a thin polyoxometalate-based layer (12-phosphotungstic acid, H3PW12O40, “W-POM-12”) was deposited from a methanol solution on top of the active layer to serve as an electron collection layer. The devices were completed with a 150 nm thick aluminium cathode, deposited via thermal evaporation in a dedicated chamber. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used with no further purification. The film thickness was estimated by ellipsometry.
Solar cell characterization
Current density–voltage characteristics of the fabricated solar cells were measured with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. Cells were illuminated with a Xe lamp and an AM 1.5G filter to simulate solar light illumination conditions with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun), as was recorded with a calibrated silicon photodiode. Stability measurements were performed by measuring the devices' photocurrent under 1 sun illumination at periodical time intervals; in between measurements, the devices were stored in nitrogen. Incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCE) were measured on an Autolab PGSTAT-30 potentiostat, using a 300 W Xe lamp in combination with an Oriel 1/8 monochromator for dispersing the light in an area of 0.5 cm2. A Thorlabs silicon photodiode was used for the calibration of the IPCE spectra. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using the PGSTAT-30 potentiostat equipped with a frequency response analyzer (FRA) under 1 sun illumination at an applied potential close to or at the open-circuit voltage. Film preparation and device measurements were performed in air.
