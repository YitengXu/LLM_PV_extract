    , Accepted 1st September 2021First published on 24th September 2021AbstractTwin boundaries (TBs) were identified to show conflicting positive/negative effects on the physical properties of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites, but their effects on the mechanical properties are still unclear. Herein, the tensile characteristics of a variety of TB-dominated bicrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites are explored using molecular simulations. The results show that TB-containing CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites can be classified into four types based on their tensile ductile detwinning characteristics. Type I is characterized by smooth loading flow stress–strain responses, originating from relatively uniform stress distribution induced gradual amorphization in the TB region. Types II and III are represented by a sudden drop in loading stresses but then distinct ductile flow stress–strain curves, resulting from limited and large-area amorphizations of TB-involved structures, respectively. However, Type IV is highlighted by double apparent peaks in the loading curve, followed by a ductile flow response, originating from the stress-concentration of localization-to-globalization in the TB region, as well as amorphization. This study provides critical insights into the mechanical characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites and indicates that TB engineering is a promising strategy to design mechanically robust hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite-based device systems.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have been identified to show structural diversity and unique optical and electronic properties, such as long carrier diffusion lengths, high carrier mobility, tunable and small bandgaps, strong extinction coefficients, strong photoluminescence performance, and so on.1–5 As a consequence, they find a large variety of important practical applications, for example, their utilization in optoelectronic and photonic devices, such as solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, waveguides, and nanolasers.2,6–8
As a prototype of HOIPs, methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) is one of the most promising energy-related materials for utilization in next-generation low-cost, low-temperature, and solution-processable photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices with high power conversion efficiencies.9,10 Compared to its inorganic counterparts, as a result of the presence of organic ions, MAPbI3 is a mechanically soft nature hybrid framework and shows better performance in response to mechanical loading,11 providing broad prospects for further potential applications in flexible and soft-wearable functional devices.12,13
Because of these important practical applications, there have been a number of pioneering theoretical and experimental studies examining the mechanical characteristics of the MAPbI3 perovskite11,14–19 that determine the service lifetime and reliability of electronic devices. Using inelastic neutron scattering and Brillouin scattering, the bulk modulus of a single crystal of the MAPbI3 perovskite was measured to be 14.8 ± 1.7 GPa at 340 K,20 and the mechanical stability can be improved by doping with an appropriate concentration of Cs.21 Using the nanoindentation technique, it was reported that the elastic modulus and mechanical hardness of a single crystal of the MAPbI3 perovskite vary around 10.4–20.0 GPa and about 0.47–1.0 GPa,18,19,22–24 respectively, depending on the measured crystalline faces, sample quality, and so on. For example, a carefully-prepared MAPbI3 single-crystal (100 face) was measured to show an average Young's modulus of 17.8 GPa.22 Moreover, it was revealed that the Pb–X framework in a CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br) single crystal affects the mechanical properties, with Young's moduli of 14.0 and 19.5 GPa for CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3,18 respectively. Theoretically, using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the Young's modulus of a single crystal of the MAPbI3 perovskite was determined to vary from 12.3 to 22.2 GPa, and the MAPbI3 perovskite is mechanically more robust than Cl- and Br-based perovskites.11,14–17 Moreover, its bulk modulus was calculated to range from 15.6 to 18.5 GPa.15,16
As is known, however, due to its fabrication mainly using a process-solution method, the MAPbI3 perovskite is invariably polycrystalline with intrinsic structural defects such as vacancies and grain boundaries (GBs).25,26 It was theoretically and experimentally determined that structural defects such as GBs can show either positive or negative effects on the physical properties and performance of MAPbI3-based devices.27–29 Such conflicting results are primarily attributed to the fact that the tested polycrystalline samples show large differences in the microscopic structure and morphology, including the grain size, density of GBs, twin boundaries (TBs) and so forth.11,30–32
In mechanics, polycrystalline MAPbI3 perovskites are mechanically weaker than their single crystal counterpart. Using the scanning probe microscopy technique, the elastic modulus of polycrystalline MAPbI3 perovskite films was determined to be around 9.00 GPa.33 As a result of reduction in the number of GB defects, polycrystalline perovskite thin films with large grain sizes show high overall fracture resistance and mechanical stability.34–36 Moreover, the fracture energy (Gc) of polycrystals ranges from around 0.41 ± 0.17 to 1.14 ± 0.24 J m−2 which is much lower than that of single crystals (2.7 J m−2),22,34 and the microscopic residual stress can induce microcrack propagation of GBs in the polycrystalline thin films.22 Using MD simulations, it was shown that polycrystalline MAPbI3 perovskites exhibit a Young's modulus of around 5.08–7.89 GPa, but a higher ductility than the single crystal.11 This apparent degradation in the elastic properties can be mainly attributed to the complex microstructures at the polycrystalline grain boundaries (GBs) and finite crystalline grain size.37
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, previous studies mainly focused on the effects of environmental conditions, chemical composition, crystallographic face and grain size on the mechanical properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite. However, the critical role of GBs in the mechanical characteristics of the MAPbI3 perovskite remains largely unexplored. Remarkably, TBs are a special type of GBs and are known as a special type of two-dimensional (2D) structural defects. Previous reports showed that the existence of TBs, for example, Σ3(111) TB, can have both positive and negative effects on the physical properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite and the performance of solar cells.30 Unfortunately, the roles of TBs in the mechanical characteristics of the MAPbI3 perovskite are still unclear. Understanding the influence of TBs on the mechanical stability and mechanical properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite is crucial for improving the performance of its solar cells with good mechanical flexibility and robustness. To this end, in this study, a variety of distinct TB structures in the MAPbI3 perovskite are constructed on the basis of the coincidence site lattice (CSL) method38,39 and their tensile mechanical characteristics are for the first time examined using classic MD simulations, aiming to establish the fundamental relationship between the TB structure and mechanical properties of MAPbI3 and reveal the vital role of TBs in designing mechanically robust MAPbI3.
2. Models and methods
2.1 Molecular models
The MAPbI3 perovskite structure is a basic building block of the organic–inorganic perovskite family. Structurally, the MAPbI3 perovskite represents a class of materials with a similar crystal structure to calcium titanate (CaTiO3). It shows an ABX3 configuration where the A, B and X sites are occupied by small organic cations, divalent group elements, and halogens, respectively.40 Here, A is CH3NH3+ (MA+), B is the cation of Pb2+, and X is the halogen I−. The MAPbI3 perovskite structure is a cubic lattice with the space group Pm3m, and the lattice constants a, b and c are equal to 8.8 Å.41,42
In this work, ten systems including pristine and nine bicrystalline structures containing different TB defects are taken into consideration, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. There are differences in microstructures between the single crystal and bicrystals. Bicrystalline MAPbI3 perovskites are generated from a CSL model. Using the CSL model, two grains are twisted to form a definite angle until their boundary structures coincided to generate bicrystalline models. The geometries of CSL TBs are characterized by the Σ value that is defined as the inverse of coincident site density. Large Σ values indicate random boundary and low-periodicity, while low Σ values represent characteristic high-periodicity and low interface energy.43 The reciprocal planar coincidence density of a crystal lattice (Σ) is expressed as Σ = n2 + m2 (u2 + ν2 + w2)(1)where m and n are non-reciprocal integers. Moreover, [m, n] represents the coordinates of a coincident lattice. [u, v, w] is the common axis that TB rotates around, and [001] is the rotated axis in this work.

(b)–(j) Bicrystals containing twin boundaries (TBs) with tilt angles varying from 11.3 to 38.7°, respectively. To highlight the structures of TBs, irregular polygons in the TB region are differently colored. 
Alternately, to quantitatively characterize the bicrystals of MAPbI3 structures, the tilt TB angle is defined. Here, the TB angle varies from around 11.3 to 38.7°. The tilt TB angles in bicrystalline structures are calculated as follows: (2)Apparently, as shown Fig. 1, bicrystals with different tilt TB angles show largely different microstructures of TBs. Moreover, the TB energy (σTB) of bicrystalline MAPbI3 structures with respect to the bulk phase is defined as (3)where EBI and EBulk are the total potential energies of bicrystalline and bulk MAPbI3 structures, and ATB is the lateral area perpendicular to the loading direction in cells with TB structures.
2.2 Tension MD simulations
Initially, all the MAPbI3 samples are quasi-statically optimized to a configuration with local minimum energy via the conjugate gradient method, where the stopping tolerances of energy and force are 1.0 × 10−4 kcal mol−1 and 1.0 × 10−4 kcal (mol Å)−1, respectively. Afterwards, MD relaxations are carried out with a timestep of 6.0 × 106 for the pristine crystal and a timestep of 1.5 × 107 for bicrystals at a given temperature and a standard atmosphere under an NPT (constant number of particles, constant pressure, and constant temperature) ensemble. After full structural relaxations, the samples are uniaxially stretched with a constant engineering strain rate of 108 s−1 along one orthogonal direction that is perpendicular to the TB plane. Both Nosé–Hoover thermostat and barostat techniques with damping times of 100 and 1000 timesteps are employed to control the system temperature and non-loading directional pressure, respectively. The Velocity-Verlet algorithm with a timestep of 0.1 fs is implemented to integrate the Newton's equations in the MD runs. Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are applied in all three orthogonal directions. Initial velocities of all atoms in the MAPbI3 samples are assigned on the basis of Gaussian distribution at given temperatures. By using the virial definition of stress, the atomic stress is achieved through a collection of the forces on atoms during MD runs. The atomic stress in all the MAPbI3 samples is averaged over 1000 timesteps to eliminate the thermal fluctuations. To statistically capture the mechanical properties, each sample with five different initial Gaussian distributions of atomic velocities is considered. All the MD runs are implemented using the Large-scale Atomic-Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) package.44
2.3 Forcefield for modelling MAPbI3
To mimic the atomic interactions in the MAPbI3 perovskite systems, including inorganic–inorganic, organic–organic and organic–inorganic interactions, the classical model potential for hybrid perovskites (MYP)45 is employed. The MYP forcefield consists of Buckingham, Coulombic and Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential terms. The atomic interactions between the inorganic parts (Pb and I) are described by a combination of Buckingham and Coulombic potentials with the following mathematical expression:46 (4)In this expression, the exponential item indicates the short-range repulsive overlap interactions between pairs of ions, while the second item represents long-range attractive van der Waals (vdW) interactions between ions. These two terms represent the Buckingham forcefield. The last item indicates the Coulombic interaction between pairs of charged ions (q).47 Besides, the sum of 12-6 Lennard-Jones (12-6 LJ) and Coulombic potentials is utilized to describe the interactions of MA+ and inorganic parts,48 with the following mathematical expression: (5)where rij is the distance between interacting atoms i and j. εn and σ are the 12-LJ parameters, representing the LJ potential well depth with the finite distance σ at which the interatomic potential equals zero. q is the ionic charge. Moreover, the standard GAFF forcefield49,50 is employed to describe the interactions between organic MA+ ions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Distortion and energetics in TB structures
The chemical and physical properties of polycrystalline materials are dominated by their microstructural configurations, chemistry of GBs, morphology of GB networks and crystalline grain size. The properties of GBs that determine the properties of polycrystals can be specifically characterized by the GB misorientation angle and GB plane. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that, as a result of finite mirror twisting of two MAPbI3 perovskite crystals to form bicrystals, unusual non-4-membered rings composed of bielemental inorganic polar Pb–I bonds appear in the TB structures, which are characteristic defects in the GBs of MAPbI3 perovskite crystals. Similar to bielemental 2D MoS2 sheets,51,52 MAPbI3 perovskite crystals show diversity in the defective rings of TB structures. Bicrystals with different tilt angles of TB exhibit significant differences in the defective structures in the TB region. For example, TB structures with small tilt angles of 11.3°, 14.0° and 18.4° are mainly composed of pairs with Pb-polar 5|5-membered rings, whereas those with a tilt angle of 21.8° are structurally characterized by I-polar 5 + 5|5 membered rings. Note that these 5|5-membered rings are in a different geometry. In contrast, defective rings in TB structures with a large tilt angle varying from 30.9 to 38.7° are composed of a large number of Pb–I bonds, resulting in their large area of rings. Due to the appearance of these defective non-4-membered rings, MAPbI3 perovskite crystals are structurally distorted from the square geometry to a parallelogram motif in the inorganic framework, particularly in the vicinity of TB structures. Such a distortion causes deviations in critical bond Pb–I–Pb angles, which are in the range of about 170–176.553,54 generating intrinsic excess free energy in MAPbI3 perovskite bicrystals.
Commonly, formation energies of GBs quantitatively indicate the structural stability of polycrystals. In this work, potential energies of a set of TBs for the MAPbI3 perovskite structure are first evaluated at finite temperatures. Fig. 2 shows the variations in the energies of 9 distinct TBs with temperature varying from 123.15 to 350 K. As is expected, the TB energy is highly temperature dependent. As a consequence of the structural distortions induced by thermal fluctuations, with the increase of temperature, all bicrystals of the MAPbI3 perovskite show a monotonic rise in TB energy and the rise then becomes less pronounced. Under the external temperature conditions, MAPbI3 perovskite bicrystals show a TB energy of around 1.0–3.0 J m−2, depending on the tilt angle of TB, which is higher than that of guest-free pure inorganic perovskites.55 As is known, structures with lower GB energies are structurally more stable.56 Therefore, this explains the fact that polycrystalline MAPbI3 perovskites are less structurally stable than polycrystalline inorganic perovskites. By comparison, it is observed that, with temperature varying from 123.15 to 350 K, the TB structure with a tilt angle of 26.6° shows the highest TB energy, with a range of around 2.1–2.9 J m−2, and TBs with tilt angles of 11.3°, 14.0°, 18.4°, 30.9° and 36.9° yield intermediate TB energies of about 1.1–2.4 J m−2. TBs with tilt angles of 21.8° and 38.7° present the lowest TB energies, varying from 1.0 to 1.7 J m−2, representing the energetically most stable TB configurations at finite temperatures.

3.2 Uniaxial tensile detwinning responses
As is known, polycrystalline MAPbI3 thin film-based optoelectronic and photonic devices, for example, solar cells, actually work at elevated temperatures of around 343–353 K,53,57 and polycrystalline MAPbI3 thin films are inevitably deformed due to various external loads. The mechanical stability and performance of polycrystalline MAPbI3 perovskite-based devices are greatly dictated by the mechanical properties of their microscopic GBs and grain size. Therefore, the tensile characteristics of the above-constructed TBs, as well as their single crystal counterpart, are examined at finite temperatures of ≤ 350 K. Fig. 3 presents the uniaxial tensile stress–strain curves of the single crystal and bicrystals with the tilt TB angle varying from 11.3 to 38.7° at a finite temperature in the range of 123.15–350 K. Obviously, a defect-free single crystal exhibits a more mechanically robust structure than bicrystals that contain defects in the TB region. According to the features of stretching curves, three or four loading stages can be roughly identified, depending on the type of TB structure, which is insensitive to the external temperature; a TB structure with a tilt angle of 26.6° shows four distinct loading stages, while the others, as well as their single crystal counterpart, present three distinct loading stages.
 Fig. 3  Uniaxial tensile loading stress–strain curves of the single crystal and bicrystals containing twin boundaries (TBs) with tilt angles in the range of 11.3–38.7° of MAPbI3 perovskites at temperatures varying from 123.15 to 350 K. 
For all the structures mentioned, the first loading stage is described by the initial linear tensile–strain curve within a very limited strain regime, representing linear elastic deformation. The second loading stage of MAPbI3 structures, except for the TB structure with a tilt angle of 26.6°, is mainly characterized by the fact that stretching stresses are nonlinearly increased up to their maximum values, namely, the rise in stretching stresses becomes less pronounced with increasing tension strain, demonstrating strain-softening behavior. For the case of the TB structure with a tilt angle of 26.6°, the second loading stage is described by a nonlinear increase in the tensile stress up to the second highest peak at a strain of around 0.025–0.05, whereas its third loading stage corresponds to a nonlinear rise in loading stress from the second highest peak to the highest peak. The significant drop of tensile stress after the second loading stage indicates the occurrence of a dramatic structural transformation. According to the concavity of variation in the potential energy with strain, the nonlinear loading responses of all the structures are distinguished as plastic deformation. The last loading stage of a MAPbI3 single crystal is mainly described by a gradual reduction in the tensile stress, whereas, for MAPbI3 bicrystals, it is primarily characterized by the fact that loading stresses largely fluctuate with increasing tension strain. The final loading stage of all the structures correspond to post-failure deformation.
Based on the characteristics of tensile loading responses, the investigated MAPbI3 structures can be classified into four types. Type I is represented by single-crystal and TB structures with tilt angles of 11.3°, 14.0° and 18.4° and 21.8° that show a reduction of loading stress with a small fluctuation in the final stage. Remarkably, the reduction rate of the loading stress for a single crystal is more significant than that for the TB structures, indicative of the higher mechanical ductility of polycrystals than that of a single crystal, in agreement with previous reports.11 Type II consists of TB structures with 30.9°, 33.7° and 38.7° tilt angles, and their final loading stages are characterized by a sudden deep drop of tensile stresses, suggesting the occurrence of large structural changes, after which high-amplitude fluctuations of tensile stress follow. The TB structure with a 36.9° tilt angle belongs to Type III, and the final loading stage is described by a sudden deep drop of stretching stress, followed by an increase of loading stress which is in contrast to the cases of Types I and II. Type IV contains only a TB configuration with a 26.6° tilt angle and is primarily characterized by double sharp loading peaks in the intermediate loading stages II and III.
3.3 Tensile stiffness
Tensile stiffness such as Young's modulus (E) is extracted directly from the tensile stress–strain curves in Fig. 3. Note that Young's modulus is defined by the ratio of tensile stress (σ) to strain (ε) (within the initial linear elastic regime of 0.00–0.005). Fig. 4 plots the variation in the tensile Young's modulus of a single crystal and bicrystals with the TB tilt angle varying from 11.3 to 38.7° with temperature. For the pristine crystal, it is observed from Fig. 4a that its Young's modulus, depending on temperature, ranges from around 15.0 to 19.2 GPa. Previous experimental measurements and numerical simulations showed that the Young's modulus of a single crystal of the MAPbI3 perovskite varies from 10.4 to 22.2 GPa,11,15–19,23,58,59 based on the measurement and numerical techniques, as well as temperature and loading crystallographic orientations. We infer that our MD calculations are in good agreement with the above reported results, verifying the adopted MYP forcefield for mechanical prediction of the MAPbI3 perovskite. Interestingly, with increasing temperature in the range from 123.15 to 350 K, a non-monotonic change in the Young's modulus of pristine the MAPbI3 perovskite is observed, namely, there is no apparent reduction in the Young's modulus with increasing temperature, which is against the thermal softening mechanism. This is because, at different temperatures, the MAPbI3 perovskite forms distinct mechanically robust crystalline phase structures, including orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic phases,60 for example, the critical temperature (162 K) of the orthorhombic-tetragonal crystalline, cubic phase at a temperature of around 327 K.41,57,61 Using the nanoindentation technique, it was reported that the tetragonal phase of the MAPbI3 perovskite shows a Young's modulus of around 10.4–10.7 GPa,19 depending on the measured crystallographic orientation, 14.3 GPa on the (110) face and 14.0 GPa on the (112) face at room temperature with a tetragonal (pseudo-cubic) phase.18

(a) Young's modulus of the single crystal of the MAPbI3 perovskite from our MD predictions at temperatures in the range of 123.15–350 K, experimental measurements,18,19,22 and MD and DFT calculations.11,14,15 (b)–(j) Young's modulus of bicrystals of the MAPbI3 perovskite composed of twin boundaries (TB) with tilt angles varying from 11.3 to 38.7° as a function of temperature ranging from 123.15 to 350 K, respectively. 
For bicrystals, as shown in Fig. 4b–j, the tensile Young's moduli are significantly lower than that of the pristine counterpart. This results from the fact that there are defects in the TB region of bicrystals. Apparently, the Young's modulus of bicrystals is substantially dependent on the type of TB structure and temperature. TB structures with 11.3°, 14.0°, 18.4° and 21.8° tilt angles belonging to Type I exhibit a Young's modulus of around 7.5–12.8 GPa. Intriguingly, at a critical temperature of around 180–200 K, there is an apparent deep drop in the Young's modulus for TB structures with 14.0°, 18.4° and 21.8° tilt angles, whereas, above this range, their Young's moduli are insensitive to temperature. In contrast, for the TB structure with a 11.3° tilt angle, its Young's modulus decreases with increasing temperature. For the TB structures of Type II with tilt angles of 30.9°, 33.7° and 38.7°, it is observed that their Young's moduli initially decrease monotonically as the temperature increases in the range of 123.15–200 K, but then remain unchanged with further increase of temperature. For the case of the TB structure with a tilt angle of 36.9° which belongs to Type III, a monotonic reduction in tensile Young's modulus with increasing temperature is observed, following the thermal softening mechanism. However, the tensile Young's modulus of the TB structure with a 26.6° tilt angle is found to be insensitive to temperature, similar to the case of the pristine crystal. In terms of the value of tensile Young's modulus under low/high temperature conditions, the TB structure with a 33.7/38.7° tilt angle shows the most mechanically robust configuration, while the TB structure with a 30.9° tilt angle shows the least mechanically robust one.
3.4 Tensile detwinning strength
Tensile detwinning strength can be characterized by the maximum tensile strength extracted from the loading curves in Fig. 3. Fig. 5 shows the variations in the maximum tensile strength of the pristine crystal and nine distinct bicrystals with temperature. It can be seen from Fig. 5a that the pristine crystal shows the maximum tensile strength of > 0.45 GPa at temperatures varying from 123.15 to 350 K. Interestingly, there is an increasing tendency in the maximum tensile strength with increasing temperature, breaking the thermally activated weakening mechanism. Such thermally-induced strengthening can be understood by the occurrence of phase transition of the MAPbI3 perovskite.60
 Fig. 5  Tensile strength of the MAPbI3 perovskite. (a) Maximum tensile strength of the single crystal of the MAPbI3 perovskite as a function of temperature ranging from 123.15 to 350 K. (b)–(j) Variations in the maximum tensile detwinning strength of bicrystals consisting of twin boundaries (TBs) with tilt angles ranging from 11.3 to 38.7° with temperature varying from 123.15 to 350 K. 
With regard to bicrystals, as a consequence of weak defects located in the TB region, they exhibit a lower maximum tensile strength than that of the single crystal (Fig. 5a). All the samples present a monotonic reduction in the maximum tensile strength with increasing temperature as a result of thermal weakening in the TB region, in sharp contrast to the case of the single crystal counterpart. The reduction in the maximum tensile strength of Type I, II and IV TB structures becomes less pronounced with the increase of temperature, whereas, for the Type III TB structure with a tilt angle of 36.9°, it becomes more significant with increasing temperature. Moreover, TB structures with different tilt angles present different sensitivities to temperature. By contrast, the TB structure with a 36.9/14.0° tilt angle is the most/least sensitive configuration at the maximum tensile strength to temperature, with a reduction of around 0.3/0.13 GPa as the temperature is increased in the range from 123.15 to 350 K. For a given temperature, in terms of the maximum tensile strength, the TB structure with a 36.9° tilt angle is identified to be the least mechanically robust configuration in all the structures. Note that both the tensile Young's modulus and the maximum tensile strength are not positively correlated with the TB energy. This is because the mechanical properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite composed of and entrapped organic MA+ are determined not only by the bonding properties of Pb–I inorganic octahedral cage frameworks, but also by the non-bonded interactions between the octahedral cages and guest ions of MA+,11 differing from the case of other inorganic materials.62,63
3.5 Tensile ductile detwinning mechanisms
To uncover the deformation mechanisms underlying the type of TB dependent uniaxial loading responses in depth, development of the molecular structures of all bicrystalline MAPbI3 perovskites subjected to tension is recorded. As discussed above, bicrystals with different TB tilt angles can be divided into four types. Fig. 6 presents the four representative mechanical loading curves and the corresponding snapshots of the TB structures subjected to critical tension strains as indicated by the solid circles in the curves. For clarification, the organic ions of MA+ are removed and the inorganic (Pb and I) atoms are colored on the basis of atomic shear strain. At a relaxed state (zero tension strain), all investigated TB structures are configurational stable. As indicated by both the loading curves and snapshots in Fig. 6, there are distinct stretching ductile deformation mechanisms among the four types of TB structures.

(a)–(d) Tensile stress–strain curves of bicrystals of the MAPbI3 perovskite containing twin boundaries (TBs) with tilt angles of 11.3°, 30.3° and 36.9° and 26.6°, respectively. These four TBs are representative of Type I, II, III and IV TB structures. (e)–(h) Microstructural snapshots of TB structures with tilt angles of 11.3°, 30.3°, 36.9° and 26.6° at critical strains which are indicated by the solid purple circles in the loading curves, respectively. For clarification, organic MA+ ions are removed and the color code is based on the values of atomic shear strains. 
For bicrystals consisting of Type I or II TB structures, as indicated by Fig. 6e and f, loading stages I and II are mainly dominated by the relatively uniform distribution of structural shear deformation. There are no significant crystalline structural changes, explaining the relatively smooth changes of tensile stress. In loading stage III, however, tension-induced shear strain is locally concentrated in TB regions. As a result, TBs are destroyed with increasing strain. By comparison, the strain-induced destruction of TBs of Type I is described by a slow change in TB configurations, explaining the flow characteristics of loading stress, whereas, for TBs of Type II, it is mainly characterized by a rapid disordering in TB configurations, elucidating the sudden deep drop of loading stress in the tensile curve. This can be considered as characteristic brittle failure. Interestingly, these destructions of TBs do not lead to rapid separation of the two contacting crystals, as well as strain release in the bulk region, indicating that the disordered TBs are still able to carry load as a result of reformation of Pd–I bonds and non-bonded interactions. This is the molecular origin of the super-tensile ductile deformability.
With regard to a bicrystal containing a Type III TB structure, as shown in the first two snapshots in Fig. 6g, the first two loading stages are characterized by the fact that stretching load-induced shear strain is primarily carried on the TB region and in the vicinity of the TB structure. Consequently, as the load is critically imposed, ordered TB configurations and their neighboring defect-free structures are rapidly destroyed (snapshot #3 in Fig. 6g), reflecting brittle failure, analogous to that in Type II TBs. Thereafter, as a result of the large-area failure, there is an increasing tendency of the loading stress with increasing tension strain. Furthermore, the super-ductile deformation is contributed by elongation of the large-area as-destroyed structures.
As for a bicrystal composed of a Type IV TB structure, when subjected to uniaxial tension, shear strain is non-uniformly distributed, with tension-induced shear strain in localized regions and some neighboring defect-free Pb–I cages of the TB structure. As the tension strain reaches the critical value, bond dissociation of Pb–I occurs in the local load carrying regions, resulting in the first apparent reduction and oscillation of loading stress (snapshot #2 in Fig. 6h). With the increase in uniaxial tension strain, stress concentration becomes well distributed on the whole TB structure, leading to a significant re-rise in global loading stress. Once the bicrystal is critically uniaxially elongated, however, highly strained TBs are catastrophically destroyed by rapid dissociation and reformation of Pb–I bonds, producing amorphization in the TB region. Such rapid destruction of the TB structure causes a sudden deep drop of loading stress (Fig. 6d). This reveals that a Type IV TB structure shows characteristic brittle failure in this loading phase. Afterwards, its deformation mechanism is similar to those of Types I and II, with elongation of amorphized TB structures.
In a nutshell, compared with the single crystal MAPbI3 perovskite, bicrystals containing TB structures more easily undergo deformation and failure, similar to the reinforced polymers and glassy ceramics in the fracture mechanism.11 However, they exhibit unique tensile ductile mechanisms, depending on the types of their TB structure, and are different from that of the single crystal. As is indicated, the molecular structures of TBs play critical roles in the structural stability and mechanical performance of polycrystalline MAPbI3 perovskites that are vital to the performance and lifetime of MAPbI3 perovskite-based device systems.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the tensile mechanical detwinning properties of MAPbI3 perovskites containing nine distinct TB structures are for the first time investigated using classic MD simulations. It is revealed that tensile properties such as Young's modulus, maximum detwinning strength, as well as the formation energy of TBs are significantly dependent on temperature and the tilt angle of TBs. There is an anti-correlation between Young's modulus/maximum detwinning strength and temperature, but a complex correlation between structural/tensile properties (formation energy of TBs/Young's modulus and maximum tensile strength) and tilt angle of the TB structure.
All the investigated TB-containing MAPbI3 perovskites show superior tensile detwinning ductility over their single crystal counterpart. There are four types of TB structures classified from the tensile detwinning characteristics. Similar to the bulk counterpart, Type I structures containing TBs with tilt angles of 11.3°, 14.0°, 18.4° and 21.8° exhibit smooth ductile flow stress–strain curves because of the relatively uniform load carrying and gradual amorphization of the TB structure. Type II structures with TB tilt angles of 30.9°, 33.7° and 38.7° exhibit a sudden drop of loading stress, followed by ductile flow behavior, originating from rapid amorphization in a small TB region; however, a Type III structure with a TB tilt angle of 36.9° is characterized by an increasing trend of loading stress prior to a sudden stress drop, resulting from large-area amorphization in TB and its neighboring regions. Intriguingly, the Type IV structure represented by a TB tilt angle of 26.6° shows double peaks in the tensile curve, followed by the emergence of ductile flow stress characteristics, resulting from the shift of tensile stress from the local TB region to global TB and amorphization of the TB structure. This work provides new insights into the mechanical characteristics of MAPbI3 containing TBs, and HOIPs can be fabricated with enhanced structural and mechanical stability via TB engineering for utilization in various photovoltaic industries and soft-wearable devices.
