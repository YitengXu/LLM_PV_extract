1. Introduction
The industrial and consumer demand for electricity is increasing with the advancement of science and technology. This is also causing a rapid decline of natural resources used to supply electricity, especially petroleum. The overuse of natural resources such as petroleum or coal has created serious environmental hazard and exacerbated the greenhouse effect. Thus, solving the energy crisis problem is an urgent task for ensuring sustainable development. Although nuclear energy is a major power source in most developed countries, the nuclear disaster induced by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011 reminded people of the risk involved in producing nuclear energy. Governments of most countries have invested considerable effort into searching for alternate energy sources that are safe and environmentally friendly. Among a wide variety of renewable energies such as wind power, hydraulic power, biomass power, ocean tidal power, and solar power, solar cells have attracted considerable attention. Previous research estimates that only 0.1% of incident sun power can meet the world's current energy needs using solar cells with 10% conversion efficiency.1
Silicon-based and inorganic-compound-type solar cells have been extensively used because of their steady efficiencies. However, these cells are either costly to manufacture or detrimental to the environment. Conversely, solar cells based on organic materials have a low cost and are environmental friendly. Organic materials play a very critical role in both bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs)2 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).3 Although polymers are often used as photosensitizers in BHJ OPVs, small molecule sensitizers have also received increasing attention in recent years. The spin-coating technique is more appropriate for polymer-based OPVs, whereas both vacuum evaporation and solution process can be used for small molecule-based OPVs. Most DSSC photosensitizers are small molecule dyes. Grätzel's seminal report in 19914 on high-efficiency (7%) DSSCs based on Ru-complex dye and nanocrystalline TiO2 mesoporous film generated a lot of interest in this topic. To date, the efficiency of Ru-based dye has reached 12.3% power conversion efficiency.5
This paper focuses on recent developments in the organic materials used for DSSCs, especially compounds published from 2009 to 2011. There is no intention to cover every aspect of DSSCs. For more comprehensive discussion of DSSCs, interested readers can refer to some review articles published recently.6 Nonetheless, the operation mechanisms of n-type and p-type DSSCs are briefly described below. Fig. 1 shows the schematic device structure of an n-type DSSC, which comprises transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates, a mesoporous titanium dioxide film, dye sensitizers, an electrolyte layer, and a counter electrode. Light illumination excites the dye molecules adsorbed on TiO2 from the ground state to the excited state, and the electrons pumped to the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the dye are injected into the TiO2 conduction band. Electrons are then transported through the TiO2 layer and the outer circuit to the cathode (e.g., Pt) of the DSSC. The conventionally used redox couple (or mediator), I−/I3−, reduces the oxidized dye molecule, and the cathode can regenerate the oxidized mediator. This repeating cycle enables the DSSC to generate electric power continuously. Although p-type DSSCs have the same working principle as n-type DSSCs, a p-type semiconductor such as NiO is used as the photoelectrode (photocathode) for dye loading. Upon photo-excitation, the sensitizer injects a hole into the valence band of NiO leading to the reduction of the sensitizer. The sensitizer is regenerated from the reduced form by the redox mediator. The injected hole then diffuses through the electrode into the outer circuit and reach the counter electrode where they regenerate the reduced redox mediator.7

The materials covered in this article include sensitizers, electrolytes or redox mediators, and counter electrodes. Solution electrolytes may not be a good choice for practical application due to the shortcoming of solvent evaporation. Solid-state electrolytes (or hole conductors) like redox conducting polymers,8 quasi solid-state organic gels,9 and ionic liquids10 are considered important alternatives for solution electrolyte. However, they are outside the scope of this review, and the interested readers can refer to some recent papers cited. There are many attempts to search for alternatives of Pt for counter electrodes due to the high cost of Pt. We will confine our discussions of counter electrodes on conducting polymers, that is, molecular type materials. Therefore, other important materials such as graphene, carbon and carbon nanotubes11 are beyond the scope of this article, and the readers can refer to ref. 11.
2. Recent progress on sensitizers of DSSCs
2.1. Sensitizers for n-type DSSCs
The sensitizing dye plays a significant role in DSSCs because its light harvesting ability determines the upper limit of the DSSC photo-to-electric conversion efficiency. The following section summarizes recent progress in n-type dye sensitizers. Basically organic sensitizers for DSSCs are classified as metal-containing and metal-free dyes. Among metal-containing dyes, ruthenium and zinc porphyrin complexes exhibit much higher cell performance except for one example of an osmium complex (vide infra). Therefore, this article will focus on ruthenium and porphyrin dyes. Readers interested in different metal complexes such as copper,12 nickel,13 platinum,14 iridium15 and iron16 should refer to relevant articles. Recently Segawa reported that a DSSC based on [Os(tcterpy)(4,4′-bis(p-butoxystyryl)-2,2′-bipyridine)Cl]PF6 (tcterpy = tricarboxy-terpyridine) reached overall conversion efficiency of 6.1% due to the wide-band spectral response of the dye up to 1100 nm.17

2.1.1. Ruthenium complexes. 
Ruthenium complexes with a basic core structure, such as N3, N719, or black dye, remain under intensive investigation after Grätzel's report. Many ruthenium dyes possess a 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine or 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′,2′′-terpyridine ligand. This ligand contains carboxylic moieties that function as anchoring groups on the TiO2 surface for electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. Ruthenium dyes usually absorb light in the visible to the near-infrared (near-IR) region because of their metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) characteristics.
To enhance the conversion efficiencies of Ru dye-based DSSCs, it is possible to modify the structure of Ru complexes to achieve wider absorption covering the whole visible region, including the near-IR region, and/or achieve a higher molar extinction coefficient and stability. The most popular approach is to replace one of the 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine ligands in N3 dye with a π-conjugated or alkylated bipyridine. This creates heteroleptic Ru complexes18 such as the famous Z907 dye. However, these types of heteroleptic Ru complexes may suffer from insufficient improvement of absorption because of a lack of auxochromes or low product yield resulting from the existence of coordination isomers of thiocyanate ligand, which may even shorten cell lifetime. These drawbacks can be overcome by a new molecular design that completely abandons the thiocyanate ligand. Thiocyanate-free Ru sensitizers with pincer-type ligands, [Ru(C^N^N)(N^N^N)]+, for DSSCs were first reported by van Koten19 (Fig. 2). The [Ru(C^N^N)(N^N^N)]+ complexes have a tridentate cyclometalated ligand instead of three thiocyanate ligands. This type of complex reveals broadened and red-shifted absorption spectra compared with N719 dye (1 in Fig. 2) resulting from the raised HOMO energy level.20 The MLCT band of Compound 2 has more intense absorption, although it has a shorter wavelength than N719. Thus, this series of dyes is ideal for DSSC applications. The highest efficiency achieved using compound 4 (VOC = 0.42 V; JSC = 12.0 mA cm−2; FF = 0.46; η = 2.1%) is comparable with the standard sample 1 (VOC = 0.45 V; JSC = 11.5 mA cm−2; FF = 0.44; η = 2.1%). With a similar strategy, Grätzel reported a Ru complex with a bidentate cyclometalated ligand, [Ru(dcbpyH2)(ppyF2)]+ (DFP-Ru) (Fig. 3). The resulting DSSC exhibited a high efficiency of 10.1%.21 Berlinguette22 also reported high-efficiency DSSCs based on thiocyanate-free trisheteroleptic cyclometalated Ru sensitizer (1–3, Fig. 3). The cell using the noncorrosive [Co(dbbip)2]2+/3+ redox couple (dbbip = 2,6-bis(1′-butylbenzimidazol-2′-yl)pyridine) exhibited an efficiency of 5.5% under full sun illumination. Grätzel23 recently reported a suite of heteroleptic tridentate cyclometalated Ru-complexes bearing terminal triphenylamino substituents, as Fig. 4a shows. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these complexes are tunable by varying X, Y, Z, R1, and R2 substituents (X, Y, Z: C or N; R1: H, Me or OMe; R2: H, CO2Me or CO2H) to achieve an optimal power conversion efficiency of 8.02%. Kisserwan and Ghaddar fabricated a thiocyanate-free cyclometalated ruthenium sensitizer (Fig. 4b) and DSSC using a non-volatile ionic liquid-based electrolyte with CuI additive. The photocurrent of the DSSC increased more than 25% of that without CuI additive.24 The conversion efficiency measured under 1 sun irradiation reached 5.7%.

Chi25 reported thiocyanate-free Ru dyes with 2-pyridyl pyrazolate as the ancillary ligand, TFRS (Fig. 5), in 2010. The DSSCs fabricated exhibited a high conversion efficiency of 9.54%. Chi further developed a heteroleptic Ru complex TF that replaces three thiocyanate ligands of the black dye with a tridentate pyridyl pyrazolate ligand (pypz),26 as Fig. 5 shows. The dyes have a wide absorption ranging from 310 to 720 nm in DMF. According to the theoretical calculation results of TF dyes, the LUMO electrons are localized at the terpyridine ligand with three carboxylate groups, whereas the HOMO electrons reside at the Ru metal and the central pyridyl ring of pypz, indicating the metal-to-ligand charge transfer character. The conversion efficiency of TF series dyes ranges from 9.11 to 10.7%. Among them, TF-3 dye has the best efficiency (10.7%) with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.76 V, short circuit current (JSC) of 21.39 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.66.

2.1.2. Porphyrins. 
Porphyrins did not attract much attention in early studies because their planar structure often leads to aggregation. However, researchers have made astonishing progress in this area in recent years, especially regarding porphyrins containing zinc. Although the absorption of Ru complexes is limited beyond the near-IR region, porphyrins show intense absorption in the region of 400–500 nm (Soret band) and 500–700 nm (Q-band) along with good stability. Thus, porphyrins and their derivatives can be used as panchromatic photosensitizers. Reports on push–pull type dipolar zinc porphyrins for DSSCs have increased significantly in recent years. Porphyrins can be functionalized at the β- or meso-position to improve light absorption and therefore cell efficiency.27
High conversion efficiencies surpassing 10% have been achieved using zinc porphyrins developed by Yeh5,28a and Lin (LD-4)28b independently, as Fig. 6 shows. A common approach to suppress the aggregation of the dyes is to incorporate a bulky aryl group (3,5-bis(tert-butyl)phenyl) at the 10 and 15 carbon atoms of the porphyrin ring. The power conversion efficiency of cell YD-2 reached 11% (VOC = 0.77 V; JSC = 18.6 mA cm−2; FF = 0.764) under AM 1.5G, and the peak incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) exceeded 90% at 675 nm. A conversion efficiency of ∼7% can be achieved for YD-2 using a 2.4 μm thick titania film and a cosensitizer.28a Yeh developed a new dye, YD-2-o-C8, by replacing the 3,5-bis(tert-butyl)phenyl substituents in YD-2 with 2,6-dioctoxyphenyl groups.5 Compared to YD-2, this new dye further suppresses dark current and pushes the PCE value to ∼12% at input power of ∼100 mW cm−2. Through collaboration with Grätzel, a record high efficiency of 12.3% was reached using cosensitized system and Co(II/III)-based redox electrolyte. Further tuning the structure of the porphyrins and the device configuration can lead to even better cell performance in the future.

2.1.3. Metal-free sensitizers. 
Compared to Ru dyes, metal-free sensitizers have advantages of low cost and structural design flexibility. Moreover, the molar extinction coefficient of the charge transfer band in metal-free dyes are normally much higher than that of the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) band in ruthenium dyes, which seldom exceeds >25000 M−1 cm−1. According to the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) formula shown in eqn (1) (Γ (mol cm−2): the dye density; σ (cm2 mol−1): the absorption cross section obtained from the extinction coefficient),29 the molar extinction coefficient has to be as large as 2.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for a dye which has a dye density of 1 × 10−7 mol cm−2 on the TiO2 surface (approximately the order of dye density on TiO2 having a thickness of 15 μm) in order to achieve a light harvesting efficiency of 99%. LHE(λ) = 1 − 10−Γσ(λ)(1)
Therefore, metal-free sensitizers have also attracted considerable attention in recent years because thinner TiO2 film can be used. The skeleton of metal-free sensitizers normally consists of three components: electron donor, electron acceptor, and conjugated spacer. Arylamine is commonly employed as the electron donor. Acid ligands, such as carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, and sulfonic acid, may serve as the electron acceptor and the anchoring group between dye molecules and semiconductor surface as well. The conjugated spacer plays an important role in electronic communication between the donor and the acceptor, in enhancing light harvesting, and in dark current suppression.
2.1.3.1 Spacer containing fluorine substituents. 
Chi and Chou reported a series of organic sensitizers introducing the electronegative fluorine atom into the donor-π-acceptor molecule for all solid-state DSSCs (Fig. 7a).30 The fluoro-substituent plays a key role in improving the device conversion efficiency (e.g., fluoro-substituted dyes all possess high molar extinction coefficient). Introducing the fluorophenylene to the acceptor of the dye molecule lowers both the HOMO and LUMO levels, and may enhance the spatial separation between electrons and holes and reduce the dark current. This in turn leads to a higher VOC value. The high electronegativity and small polarization nature of the fluorine atom (i.e., low electron affinity) may suppress charge recombination between the electrons at TiO2 and the holes at spiro-MeOTAD. For example, A2-F dye exhibited 4.86% cell conversion efficiency in a solid-state DSSC with VOC of 0.91 V and JSC of 7.52 mA cm−2, which was superior to the performance of A2-H (η = 3.69%; VOC = 0.77 V; FF = 0.764; JSC = 18.6 mA cm−2). Chi and Chou also reported LJB-Fo and LJB-Fm with a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) unit and a fluoro-substituted phenyl group in the conjugated spacer (Fig. 7b).31 Note that the fluoro substituent at different positions relative to the anchoring group affect cell performance differently. Specifically, LJB-Fo with an ortho-substituted fluorine atom showed better DSSC performance (8.22%) than LJB-Fm with a meta-substituted congener (7.00%) or LJB-H without fluorine atoms (7.25%). The resonance conjugation between the fluorine atom and the carbonyl group of cyanoacrylic acid likely increased the TiO2 affinity of LJB-Fo, which is beneficial to dye adsorption and electron injection. Chi and Chou also suggested the orientation of the fluorine atom in LJB-Fo resulted in a surface dipole that destabilized the Fermi level and led to a high VOC value (787 mV) in the cell. It is important to note that the fluorine atom may have an adverse effect if it is not in an appropriate position. Wang reported two sensitizers in which the two hydrogen atoms at the 9 position of cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene were replaced with two fluorine atoms (C223) or two ethyl groups (C224), respectively (Fig. 7c).32a The alkyl chains in C224 dye did a better job of facilitating electron injection of the dye at the dye and TiO2 interface, slowing down the charge recombination. The substituents at the arylamino entity also make an important contribution. In another report by Wang, the N,N-bis(p-hexyloxyphenyl)aniline entity of dye C218 was proven to possess strongest donating ability than its phenothiazine, 3,5-bis(tert-butyl)phenyl and carbazolyl analogues (Fig. 7d).32b Consequently, the dye C218 had the highest cell performance of all (VOC = 0.95 V; JSC = 13.30 mA cm−2; η = 9.3%; FF = 0.74).

2.1.3.2. Spacer with planarized oligo aromatic rings. 
Increasing the coplanarity of a bridged π-system without inducing intermolecular aggregation can successfully strengthen intramolecular charge transfer. Wang ingeniously designed a binary π-conjugated spacer of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and dithienosilole (DTS) in which the former was connected to the arylamine donor to lift up the HOMO and the latter was connected to the acceptor to lower the LUMO (Fig. 8a).33a The dye has a very high molar extinction coefficient (5.75 × 104 M−1 cm−1) at 493 nm and a record high efficiency of 10.3% (AM 1.5G condition). Dihexyl-substituted DTS also significantly reduces the aggregation of dye molecules on nanocrystals. According to Wong's report, diphenyl-substituted DTS can also efficiently enhance light-capturing ability and suppress dye aggregation (Fig. 8b).33b A conversion efficiency of up to 7.6% was achieved, reaching ∼96% of N719-based standard cell. Dyes with coplanar indacenodithiophene as the π-spacer have conversion efficiencies of up to 6.7% (Fig. 8c).33c

2.1.3.3. Spacer with electron-deficient moieties. 
Incorporating the electron-deficient moieties used for low bandgap polymers in the π-spacer of metal-free dyes results in a significant red shift of the absorption spectra. We previously developed sensitizers containing benzothiadiazole (or benzoselenadiazole) in the conjugated bridge (Fig. 9a).34 However, the best performance of these dyes only reached 71% of the standard DSSC based on N3 dye. Partial charge accumulation at the benzothiadiazole or benzoselenadiazole entity was confirmed by theoretical calculation. In this case, charge-trapping hampers the electron injection and decreases cell efficiency. A similar charge trapping effect appeared in some cyanovinyl-containing sensitizers, despite the long absorption wavelengths of the dyes (Fig. 9b).35 A few papers on benzothiadiazole-containing dyes appeared after our report. In 2008, Ko36 reported that DSSCs with polymer gel electrolyte had conversion efficiencies of 4.66% and 6.61% for dyes JK-68 and JK-69, respectively (Fig. 10). Introducing two alkyl chains in the spacer of JK-69 generated a blue shift in the absorption spectra because of the increased twist angle between the benzothiadiazole entity and the two neighboring thiophene rings. However, Ko's dye effectively blocks the redox mediator from coming close to the TiO2 surface. Pei37 and Tian38 independently developed benzothiadiazole-containing dyes BzTCA and BzTMCA and WS-1 and WS-2, respectively (Fig. 10). Both BzTCA and BzTMCA have low VOC values, though the former has an efficiency of 6.04%, reaching ∼78% of that of the N3-based cell. Using a powerful electron donor, indoline, Tian improved the spectral response and stability of WS-1 and WS-2. When using DCA (deoxycholic acid) as the co-adsorbent, The DSSC of WS-2 exhibited very promising performance: VOC = 650 mV; JSC = 17.7 mA cm−2; FF = 0.76; η: 8.7%. Moreover, the cell performance of WS-2 was also impressive (6.62% efficiency) when using a liquid or ionic-liquid electrolyte. A good stability was attained by a 1000 h test and the efficiency remained at 94% of the original value. A benzothiadiazole-containing dye HKK-BTZ4 co-adsorbed with high concentration (80 mM) of DCA was reported to have an efficiency of 7.30%.39

 Fig. 10  Metal-free sensitizers containing benzothiadiazole. 
Other electron-deficient moieties used for sensitizers include 2,2′-bithiazole,40 quinoxaline,41 benzotriazole,42 diketopyrrolopyrrole,43 pyrimidine,44 pyridine45a and 2-thiazole33c group (Fig. 11). Note that the complexation of 2,2′-bithiazole with ZnI2 led to higher molar absorptivity, a red shift in the absorption spectra, and higher cell performance.42b The conversion efficiencies reached 5.73%, 5.56%, 8.02%, 4.14%, 7.64%, 5.27%, and 6.88% for T1, RC-22, WS-5, DPP-1, OHexDPTP, Y4, and 5, respectively. Therefore, incorporation of the electron-deficient moieties in the conjugated spacer of the sensitizer seems to be a good approach for producing high performance DSSCs if the charge-trapping effect is alleviated via appropriate tuning of the molecular structure. Note that the electron-deficient pyridine served as the anchoring group in place of a conventional carboxy group, such as N3–N4 (Fig. 12).45b The dyes NI3–NI4 more efficiently injected electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 because of strong coordinate bonding between the pyridine and the Lewis acid site of TiO2. The cell performance of NI3 and NI4 surpassed that of NI1 and NI2 in spite of the smaller amount of dye adsorbed.

2.1.3.4. Squaraine dyes. 
To efficiently harvest the whole solar spectrum, organic dye molecules that absorb strongly in the far-infrared and near-infrared regions are desired. Kamat46a and Grätzel46b first reported symmetric cyanine dyes that absorbed in the NIR region. However, the DSSCs fabricated from these dyes only exhibited low efficiencies. In 2010, Ko (Fig. 13a and Fig. 13b)47 and Wu (Fig. 13c)48 independently developed unsymmetrical donor–acceptor dyes with squaraine unit in the conjugated fragment. Unlike Grätzel's symmetric squaraine dye,46b these dyes exhibited significantly improved efficiencies. The efficiency of JK-64Hx-based DSSC (Fig. 13a) reached 4.91%.47 In 2011, Ko47b further synthesized JK-216 and JK-217 dyes (Fig. 13b) incorporating non-coplanar N,N-bis(9,9-dimethyl-fluoren-2-yl)aniline as electron donor. These two organic dyes have absorption peaks near 670 nm. These peaks refer to the π–π* transition of the electrons in the conjugated chain. DSSCs based on these two dyes achieve excellent conversion efficiencies because of their extremely high extinction coefficients. The DSSC of JK-216 dye has a conversion efficiency of 6.29% (VOC = 0.61 V; FF = 0.74; JSC = 13.93 mA cm−2), which is the highest among squaraine dyes reported so far. Excellent long-term stability of the cell was also achieved. Maeda and Nakazumi further shifted the absorption of new squarylium dyes LSQa–LSQc to the lower energy region (777–800 nm) with outstanding absorptivities (174000–189000 M−1 cm−1) because of extended π-conjugation (Fig. 13d).49 The best cell performance was achieved with LSQa (VOC = 0.46 V; JSC = 9.05 mA cm−2; η = 2.26%; FF = 0.54) by adding CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) as the co-adsorbent to suppress H-aggregation of the dyes on TiO2.

2.1.3.5. Amine-free dyes. 
Though arylamine has been widely used as the electron donor in metal-free sensitizers,50 recently there were reports on arylamine-free dyes exhibiting good conversion efficiencies. One class of dyes employed pyran as the donor50a (Fig. 14). Among them, NAT-440 has an impressively long λabs value of 580 nm, and SFO-346 has a high cell efficiency of 5.37% which reaches ∼78% of that of a N719-based device.50b Amine-free dyes (HY-1 and HY-3 in Fig. 14) employing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the donor were developed by us.50c Besides high absorptivities (>45,000 M−1 cm−1) at ~430 nm, J-aggregation of the sensitizers extends their light-harvesting efficiencies to the longer wavelength region. HY-3 has a high cell efficiency of 5.15% reaching ∼70% of that of a N719-based device.

2.1.3.6. Sensitizers with multi-donors or multi-acceptors. 
The dendritic approach has been used to construct dipolar dyes, that is, multi-donors or multi-acceptors. An innovative approach is the use of two or more branched anchoring groups to strengthen the adsorption on the TiO2 surface and improve the light-absorbing ability. Abbotto51a synthesized two novel organic dyes based on this concept (Fig. 15a). The absorption spectra of both DB-1 (463–473 nm) and DB-2 (510 nm) were red shifted relative to that of D5 dye (441 nm). Under AM 1.5G illumination, the cell efficiency based on DB-1 dye is 5.7% (VOC = 0.61 V; FF = 0.73; JSC = 12.68 mA cm−2), which is higher than that (5.5%) based on D5 dye (VOC = 0.65 V; FF = 0.73; JSC = 11.56 mA cm−2). For the DB-2 dye (η = 1.3%), the non-conjugated anchoring group is harmful to cell efficiency. In comparing dyes M14 and D35 (Fig. 15b), Boschloo and Hagfeldt51b found that M14 with two anchoring groups exhibited bathochromic and hyperchromic shift in the absorption. However, D35, possessing bulkier arylamine, can more effectively block electrolytes from approaching the TiO2 surface, leading to a smaller charge recombination. Consequently, the D35-based solar cell exhibited better cell performance (VOC = 0.785 V; JSC = 12.34 mA cm−2; η = 6.74%; FF = 0.70) than the M14-based cell (VOC = 0.663 V; JSC = 12.25 mA cm−2; η = 5.51%; FF = 0.68) regardless of whether liquid or solid-state electrolyte was used. In 2011, Meier52a reported that DBD with double D–π–A branches exhibited better performance than SB dye with single D–π–A branch (Fig. 16a). Dye DC constructed from two different D–π–A branches, SC-1 and SC-2 (Fig. 16b), and an aliphatic chain linker displays better solar cell performance than SC-1 or SC-2 alone.52b The cell based on DC exhibits even better performance (VOC = 0.691 V; JSC = 12.75 mA cm−2; η = 6.06%; FF = 0.69) than that fabricated with co-sensitizers SC-1 + SC-2 (VOC = 0.674 V; JSC = 10.02 mA cm−2; η = 4.64%; FF = 0.69). Dyes with two D–π–A branches linked by p-phenylene vinylene entity, TB-1 and TB-2, (Fig. 16c) were also reported.52c The performance of the device based on TB-1 (VOC = 0.641; JSC = 10.9 mA cm−2; η = 5.05; FF = 0.725) is slightly inferior to that of C213 (VOC = 0.775 V; JSC = 11.9 mA cm−2; η = 6.88%; FF = 0.747). This may be the result of unfavorable interaction between dye molecules and TiO2, which leads to non-optimal packing of the dyes and more facile recombination between the semiconductor and the oxidized electrolyte.

Previously we synthesized several sensitizers with two arylamine moieties in one molecule and dendritic structure at the donor part, such as DPPPIPC,53aT1–T3,53b and IMD53c (Fig. 17). This type of design may produce a higher extinction coefficient and/or broader spectral absorbance for the molecule, and reduce the dark current of the cell. Tian also developed several sensitizers with dendritic structure at the donor part, such as S1–S4,54aS5–S7,54bI–II,54c and III–IV54d (Fig. 18). These compounds exhibited similar properties, including a higher VOC value and better device stability. Note that the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on I dye exhibited a promising efficiency of 3.91%. There is immense room for the development of this kind of sensitizer.

2.2. Sensitizers for p-type DSSCs
Recent studies describing sensitizers for a p-type DSSC, whose working theory has been discussed in section 1, have highlighted the potential of tandem DSSCs composed of n- and p-type devices to enhance cell efficiency. Fig. 19 illustrates the prototype molecular structure of p-type dyes with a donor-spacer-acceptor skeleton. Unlike typical dyes for n-type DSSCs, the anchoring groups for adsorbing on NiO (electrode) surface are tethered at the donor and farther away from the acceptor.
 Fig. 19  Schematic molecular structure for p-type organic sensitizer. 
Sun55 synthesized P1 and P4 dyes with triphenylamine as the donor and dicyanovinylene as the acceptor (Fig. 20). The conversion efficiencies of P1 and P4 under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5) are 0.09% (VOC = 0.10 V; FF = 0.36; JSC = 2.48 mA cm−2) and 0.08% (VOC = 0.11 V; FF = 0.29; JSC = 2.51 mA cm−2), respectively. The same group later reported P7, a structurally similar dye molecule.56 Bach57 also synthesized an organic dye (1–3) based on perylene imide moiety (Fig. 20b) in 2010. The DSSC fabricated with this dye exhibited the highest cell efficiency (0.41%) among p-type DSSCs reported to date because of the intense absorption in visible light region and high optical stability. Wu58 and our group59 independently developed new arylamine-based organic sensitizers with two carboxylic anchoring groups for p-type DSSCs applications, as Fig. 21 shows. Among the dyes developed by us, PT-4 has the highest cell efficiency of 0.093%. Our results showed that dyes with two carboxylic anchoring groups had higher VOC and JSC values because of more effective suppression of dark current and hole injection. Sensitizers with two anchoring groups may also enhance dye bonding on the NiO surface.

2.3. Co-sensitization (panchromatic approach)
The panchromatic approach is realized by co-adsorbing two different sensitizers on the TiO2 surface for complementary light absorption covering the whole solar spectrum. The high molar extinction coefficient of organic dyes in the visible region compensates for the weak absorbing ability of metal-based dyes.60 Ko soaked TiO2 films in two different dyes absorbing at different wavelengths (i.e.JK-2 dye (λmax = 452 nm) and SQ-1 squaraine dye (λmax = 636 nm)) in batches. The best conversion efficiency of 6.41% was achieved by 4 h of soaking in SQ-1 dye, followed by 2 h of soaking in JK-2 dye. This efficiency is higher than that of either cell soaking only in SQ-1 for 5 h (3.78%), or only in JK-2 for 5 h (6.02%).61 In 2011, Ho62a reported a co-sensitized system using commercial N719 dye or black dye with FL dye developed in our group.62b,33c The optimum cell efficiency of 5.10% was obtained by soaking sequentially in N719 (40 min) and FL (10 min). This value is higher than that of the cell soaking only in N719 for 1 h (4.89%). This improvement is attributable to the enhanced absorption of N719 at short wavelengths with the assistance of FL dye, ultimately increasing the current output (Fig. 22).

J–V curves of different dyes with different immersing time. 
Ko63 published another co-sensitization study in 2011 using Ru-complex JK-142 and organic JK-62 dye (Fig. 23a). The DSSC exhibited a 10.2% cell efficiency surpassing that of cells using only JK-142 dye (7.28%) or JK-62 dye (5.36%). Ko also discovered that the adsorption of large-sized Ru-complexes located at the upper region of the TiO2 film and the small-sized metal-free dyes can penetrate the inner side of the film. The state-of-the-art panchromatic approach requires appropriate choice of co-sensitizers. Note that the solvents used for the two dyes should differ from each other to avoid dissolution of the first dye because this lowers the total adsorption and the cell efficiency. Odobel synthesized the first trichromophoric dyes T using sequential functionalization of near-IR dye (SQI) with Zn-porphyrin complex and boradiazaindacene (BODIPY) moiety via ethynylene linkage (Fig. 23b).64 The latter two moieties serve as light-harvesting antenna for effective photosensitizing. The performance (VOC = 0.625 V; JSC = 8.7 mA cm−2; η = 3.9%; FF = 0.71) of a dye T cell surpassed that fabricated with SQI only (VOC = 0.615 V; JSC = 6.6 mA cm−2; η = 3.0%; FF = 0.73).

3. Recent progress on organic electrolytes or redox mediators of DSSCs
Like sensitizers, redox electrolytes (or redox mediators) play an important role in DSSCs because they affect dye regeneration, charge recombination, and consequently cell performance. I−/I3− redox mediator has been widely used as the electrolyte of high performance DSSCs. However, there is still a need to search for alternative electrolytes because of the disadvantages of the I−/I3− couple: (1) triiodide species absorb in visible light at ∼430 nm;65 (2) the I−/I3− couple is corrosive to the platinum counter electrode; (3) sticking at the I−/I3− couple limits the highest VOC value to ∼0.9 V. Therefore, there is considerable interest in exploring new non-polymeric electrolytes or redox mediators.66 The nearly transparent thiolate/disulfide couple (T−−−−−/T22222, Fig. 24a) developed by Grätzel has a cell efficiency of 6.4%, which is competitive with the I−/I3− couple.67a Analogous electrolytes, McMT−−−−−/BMT and TMTU/[TMFDS][TFSI]222 (Fig. 24a), developed by Sun67b and Meng,67c respectively, also achieve remarkable cell efficiencies. With the use of PEDOT as an alternative for metallic counter electrode, dye TH305 fabricated with sulfide-based redox electrolyte A (Fig. 24b) appears to have conversion efficiencies as high as 6.0% (VOC = 0.745 V; JSC = 12.5 mA cm−2; FF = 0.65) under 1 sun illumination.67d This performance surpasses that using platinized FTO counter electrode (VOC = 0.750 V; JSC = 12.3 mA cm−2; η = 4.6%; FF = 0.50) which is likely to be the result of lower charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte/PEDOT interface.
 Fig. 24  Thiolate/disulfide-based redox mediators. 
Redox mediators with a metal core, such as those shown in Fig. 25, have also attracted attention and some of them show outstanding performance. For example, the NiIII/NiIV bis(dicarbollide) couple is non-corrosive and thermally stable (300 °C).68 The redox properties of the complex can be tuned using structural variation to optimize the device. The NiIII/NiIV bis(dicarbollide) couple (Fig. 25a) has a lower redox potential and slower electron transfer rate than the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. An acceptable cell efficiency for an N719 device can be obtained (η = 1.5%; VOC = 0.64 V; JSC = 3.76 mA cm−2) using TiO2 covered with an Al2O3 atomic layer to form the photoanode.68a More pronounced results were obtained with the use of high-area photoanodes consisting of silica aerogels coated with atomic-layer-deposited TiO2 (TiO2@SiO2). The device performance (5.8 μm aerogel, VOC = 0.628 V; JSC = 5.3 mA cm−2, η = 2.1%; FF = 0.65) is more than 2 times better than the cell using TiO2 nanoparticles as the photoanode. This enhancement in photocurrent densities in the TiO2@SiO2 cell is attributed to a combination of improved electron transport, increased recombination resistance across the TiO2/electrolyte interface, and increased light scattering within the aerogel films.
 Fig. 25  Transition-metal complex-based redox mediators. 
Using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fig. 25b) as the redox mediator can rapidly regenerate the sensitizers. However, the recombination between generated electrons and redox mediator is relatively fast, leading to higher dark-current and lower cell voltage.69 To retard the loss of electrons injected into TiO2 from recombination with the redox mediator, an insulating layer (such as Al2O3) approximately 1 Å thick was deposited on the TiO2 surface using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method.69b,69c A recent report by Bach69d indicates that the retardation of recombination reaction between electrons and holes is possible for some sensitizers using Fc/Fc+ electrolyte added with CDCA. Superior cell performance surpassing I−/I3− system was achieved with this system (η = 7.5%; VOC = 0.842 V; FF = 0.73; JSC = 2.48 mA cm−2vs. η = 6.1%; VOC = 0.742 V; FF = 0.67; JSC = 2.48 mA cm−2). It is noteworthy that there is a 100 mV increment in VOC value. The easy synthesis of ferrocene derivatives renders the ferrocene/ferrocenium system attractive.
Another promising system that is also synthetically feasible uses polypyridyl cobalt(II/III) derivatives (Fig. 25c).70 The negative Nernstian potential of Co-based redox mediator allows a larger VOC value compared with I−/I3−. This mediator is also more transparent to the visible light and less corrosive to the electrode. Earlier research on cobalt systems was limited by the lower molecular diffusivity and faster recombination with injected electrons, resulting in low cell efficiencies of <2%.70b,70c It is interesting that the [Co(dtb)]2+/3+ redox couple is more effective than the I−/I3− couple in blocking the charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface and increasing the electron lifetime in a bulky organic dye system. This couple can achieve an efficiency of 5.2%.70d Wang70e made a breakthrough by combining tris(1,10-phenanthroline) cobalt(II/III) ([Co(phen)3]2+/3+) and C218 dye (Fig. 7d), and the resulting cell efficiency reached 8.3%, which was higher than that (7.1%) using the I−/I3− redox couple. Boschloo70f found that bulky arylamine substituted D35 dye (Fig. 13b) effectively suppressed the dark current in a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ system. This approach improved cell efficiency compared to that using I−/I3− electrolyte under the same light illumination conditions (η = 6.7%; VOC = 0.92 V; FF = 0.68; JSC = 10.7 mA cm−2vs. η = 5.5%; VOC = 0.91 V; FF = 0.65; JSC = 9.38 mA cm−2). Cobalt electrolytes also play an important role in tandem cells, as described in the following section.
4. Recent progress on organic molecules for counter electrodes
The counter electrode in DSSCs acts as the reducing site for redox couples in the electrolyte solution or hole transporting layer in the solid-state electrolyte. To fulfil the requirements in DSSCs, the counter electrode should possess high conductivity for electron transporting, good electrocatalytic activity for reducing the redox mediator (e.g. I3−, in the electrolyte, and anti-corrosive ability against iodine).71 Platinum remains the most popular counter electrode because it matches the above criteria except anti-corrosion. However, platinum is also expensive. Thus, great deals of efforts have been made to replace Pt with conducting polymers. Among these polymers, polyaniline (PANI)72 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)73 show excellent performance in cell efficiency, and can reach efficiencies above 8%.73a Polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles have also been reported as an efficient counter electrode material showing a cell efficiency of 7.7%, which is close to that (8.2%) of the device based on Pt electrode.74 Readers interested in non-organic based counter electrodes such as metal oxide can refer to an excellent review by Murakami and Grätzel.71
5. Tandem DSSCs
In addition to the panchromatic approach, using tandem cells connecting several devices to one is another promising way to improve cell performance. Using the tandem cell approach, it is possible to achieve efficiency beyond the 30% theoretical limit for a single solar cell. The tandem cell efficiency with infinite solar cell connection can even approach 85% based on the thermodynamic limit if there is an ideal connection optically and electrically and gradual decrease of bandgap along the incident light direction of the connected cells (i.e., the cell with the largest optical bandgap should be placed on the top to the sun).75
To expand the light-absorbing range, the most popular tandem cell uses a direct connection of optically complementary cells,76 providing a cell efficiency exceeding 10%.76a Grätzel connected a Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell with a lower bandgap (1.0–1.7 eV) to a DSSC with a higher bandgap (1.6–1.8 eV)77 to achieve a cell efficiency of 12%.77b
The typical DSSC is fabricated using an n-type semiconductor (e.g., TiO2 or ZnO) as the photoanode that transfers electrons. In 1999, p-type semiconductors (e.g., NiO) that transfer holes were also applied for DSSCs (i.e., p-type DSSCs).78Fig. 26 shows a novel design of the tandem cell composed of n- and p-type DSSCs.7 Therefore, the dye adsorbed on the p-type semiconductor can have complementary absorption spectra with the dye adsorbed on TiO2. This enables improving light harvesting and increasing the VOC value: the cell voltage is considered as the summation of each n- and p-type cell. In other words, the VOC value is determined from the Fermi level difference between the n- and p-type semiconductors. Thus, a conversion efficiency exceeding 15% is likely possible with such a tandem cell,7 although the record high efficiency reached only 1.91%57 because of the limited hole transporting ability of p-type semiconductors. Although most studies are focused on p-type semiconductors and their corresponding sensitizers,55,56,79 some have investigated suitable redox mediators for tandem systems. For example, Boschloo80 used tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridyl) cobalt(II/III) ([Co(dtb-bpy)3]2+/3+) as the redox electrolyte for PINDI dye (Fig. 27), and achieved long-lived charge separation and slower charge recombination. The VOC value reached a high value of 0.35 V. The corresponding tandem cell fabricated from this p-type cell with N719-based n-type TiO2 semiconductor exhibited a cell efficiency of 0.55% and a very high VOC of 0.91 V.

6. Conclusions
This paper summarizes recent developments in the organic materials used in dye-sensitized solar cells, including sensitizers, electrolytes, and counter electrodes. Sensitizers for p-type DSSCs were also introduced because of their promising application in tandem cells. This summary provides readers with a research direction through a systematic literature survey, including the development and design concept of materials. Therefore, detailed engineering steps and physical analysis are beyond the scope of this paper. Spectacular breakthroughs, including molecular designs of dyes and electrolytes and electrode materials, frequently result from non-traditional thinking. In the long run, the full success of this field requires a compromise in all materials. Therefore, close integration of different areas is required. For a long-range scheme, optimization of the cell efficiency is directly correlated with every material within the DSSC system. Although novel materials are critical, device engineering, physical measurements, and theoretical studies are also indispensable.
