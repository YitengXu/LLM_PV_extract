    AbstractA food pigment (Monascus yellow) extracted from Monascus fermentations (red yeast rice) has been studied as a novel sensitizing dye for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The photocurrent action spectrum was in agreement with the absorption spectrum of the dye adsorbed on a nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrode. The DSC fabrication process has been optimized in terms of the rinsing solvent used after dye adsorption and the dye-uptake duration. After optimizing nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes and pH conditions, the resulting maximal photovoltaic characteristics were an open-circuit voltage of 0.57 V, a short-circuit current of 6.1 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.66, yielding an energy conversion efficiency of 2.3%.

1. Introduction
Due to the demand for renewable cost-effective energy sources, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), which can be fabricated from low-cost materials (TiO2, dye, etc.) using a non-vacuum printing system, have attracted academic and industrial attention.1–4 The performance of DSCs mainly depends on the dye used as a sensitizer. Generally, transition metal coordination compounds (ruthenium polypyridyl complexes) are the most effective sensitizers, due to their intense charge-transfer absorption in the whole visible range. However, ruthenium-based dyes are not suitable for cost-effective, environmentally friendly photovoltaic systems, because of the scarcity and high cost of ruthenium metal that limits the application of these complexes. To address this problem, numerous organic dyes exhibiting high cell performance have been developed.5–8 Although they are metal-free, the synthetic process is time-consuming and laborious, and toxicity tests must be performed before commercialization.
If inexpensive and harmless natural dyes that are used as food pigments can be used for DSCs, these problems can be solved. High availability and low cost are key advantages of natural dyes that can be easily and safely extracted from plants without requiring complex synthetic procedures. Therefore, the investigation of DSCs using natural dyes is extremely important for practical applications. In fact, natural dyes have been used in DSCs exhibiting moderate energy conversion efficiency.9–15 For instance, natural chlorophyll dyes have exhibited energy conversion efficiencies over 4%.9,10 In spite of the wide variation in natural dyes, however, other natural dyes do not yield energy conversion efficiencies over 2% (some derivatives synthesized from natural dyes have produced energy conversion efficiencies over 2%16,17).
In this study, we fabricated a DSC using a natural dye extracted from Monascus (Fig. 1), which is the product of Monascus purpureus fermentations, and is served as a dietary staple in some Asian countries (red yeast rice). For traditional cultivation, rice soaking in water can be directly inoculated by mixing M. purpureus spores. The mixture is then incubated in an environment around room temperature for 3–6 days for full cultivation, turning bright red in its core and reddish purple on the outside. Due to the low cost of cultivation, some producers have extracted the dyes to use as food pigments. Monascus red, which is one of the red dye in Monascus fermentations, has been used as a sensitizing dye for a DSC,11 resulting in 0.33% conversion efficiency. Instead of Monascus red, we used Monascus yellow (Fig. 2) as a novel sensitizer in the present study, which is also related to Monascus fermentations. The DSC with Monascus yellow yielded a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 6.1 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 0.57 V, and a fill factor of 0.66, leading to an energy conversion efficiency (η) as high as 2.3%. The photocurrent action spectrum of the cell showed an incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) up to 47% at 450 nm.

2. Experiments
Two types of transparent nanocrystalline-TiO2 layers were prepared using PST-18NR (particle size: 16 nm; screen-printing paste, JGC-CCIC Co., Ltd, Japan) and P25 (particle size: 21 nm; powder, Degussa, Germany). A screen-printing paste of P25 was prepared from the powder by a reported procedure.18 For the light-scattering layers, TiO2 paste (PST-400C, JGC-CCIC, Japan) was purchased. The natural dye (Monascus yellow) was supplied as a mixture of the two molecules shown in Fig. 2, which was extracted from M. purpureus fermentations by Yaegaki Bio-Industry Inc., Japan (the company's product name for the Monascus yellow solution: High-moon Yellow S200A). The structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.19
For DSC fabrication, the procedure for preparing the dye-sensitized nanocrystalline-TiO2 and Pt counter electrodes is described in a previous report in detail.20 A transparent nanocrystalline-TiO2 layer and a scattering layer with thickness of 14 and 5 µm, respectively, were used in the double-layered electrodes. The solution of Monascus yellow was prepared by mixing High-moon Yellow S200A (1 mL) and water (9 mL), and then adding acetic acid (0.05 mL). After addition of acetic acid, the pH value of the dye solution changed from 5.9 to 3.2. For dye uptake, the nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes were immersed in the dye solution, and kept at room temperature for 15 min. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were rinsed with ethanol and combined with Pt counter electrodes to assemble the sealed sandwich-type cells by heating with a hot melt of an ionomer film (thickness: 25 µm; Surlyn 1702, DuPont). A drop of the electrolyte solution was placed into a hole drilled into the counter electrode of the assembled cell, and was driven into the cell by vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using additional Surlyn 1702 film and a cover glass (0.1 mm thick). The electrolyte was composed of 0.10 M lithium iodide, 0.60 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, and 0.05 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile : valeronitrile (v/v, 85 : 15), which has been used for highly efficient DSCs (>9%) using organic dyes.7,8 To reduce the scattered light from the edge of the glass electrodes of the dye-modified TiO2 layer, light-shading masks were attached to the DSCs.21 The power of the AM1.5 solar simulator was calibrated using a reference Si photodiode equipped with an IR cut-off filter (KG-3, Schott) to limit mismatch in the region of 350–750 nm between the simulated light and AM1.5 to less than 2%.22,23
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 3 shows the UV-VIS absorption spectra and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of Monascus yellow on transparent nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes (PST-18NR). Without acetic acid treatment, the absorption peak was just 8% and the IPCE value was close to zero. For treatment with acetic acid, the absorption peak at 426 nm increased to 69%, resulting in IPCE improving to 47% at 450 nm. The action spectrum of the cell sensitized by Monascus yellow largely agrees with the absorption spectrum of the dye adsorbed on TiO2 film. It is noteworthy that the IPCE peak is red-shifted by 24 nm relative to the absorption peak. The strong absorption of blue light by I−/I3− electrolyte is considered to decrease the IPCE value in the short wavelength region,24 resulting in the red shift of the peak in the action spectrum. Considering the remarkable improvement in the IPCE value due to treatment with acetic acid, the acetic acid may promote bonding between the hydroxyl groups of Monascus yellow and the surface of the nanocrystalline-TiO2 film. Sensitizing dyes adsorbed on TiO2 surfaces are known to be desorbed by addition of bases (NaOH, NH3, etc.).25 Thus, the photovoltaic improvement upon addition of acetic acid in Fig. 3 is possibly attributable to a difference in dye adsorption modes: chemical boding adsorption mode (with acetic acid) and physical (van der Waals) adsorption mode (without acetic acid). The small absorption peak of the TiO2 electrode without acetic acid treatment arises from the physically adsorbed dye on the TiO2 surface, into which the physically adsorbed dye cannot inject photoexcited electrons. For treatment with acetic acid, on the other hand, the protons may strengthen the chemical bonding between the dye molecule and the TiO2 surface, resulting in the efficient injection of photoexcited electrons from the dye to TiO2.26,27
 Fig. 3  UV-Vis absorption and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of Monascus yellow-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. Absorption spectra were measured using transparent nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes. IPCE spectra were measured using double-layered nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes. Each electrode was dipped in Monascus yellow solution for 15 min. Spectra are compared with/without acetic acid in the dye solution for dye uptake to nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes. 
The effects of the nanocrystalline-TiO2 layers and rinsing solvents after dye uptake were examined (Table 1). After water rinsing treatment, the energy conversion efficiency of the P25-based cell was higher than that of the PST-18NR-based cell. However, after rinsing with other solvents, the PST-18NR-based cell yielded higher energy conversion efficiency than the P25-based cell, mainly originating from the difference in JSC. This effect may be attributed to the surface area and pore size (related to the particle size). Generally, the connection of small TiO2 particles can form a large surface area loading larger amount of dye on the surface, but the small pore size prohibits smooth transportation of redox species in the electrolyte solution filling the pore space. Considering the fact that the TiO2 particle size of PST-18NR is smaller than that of P25, the amount of adsorbed molecules on the PST-18NR surface is expected to be higher than that on the P-25 surface. This rationalizes the higher photocurrent density from the PST-18NR-based cell compared with the P25-based cell. On the other hand, the TiO2 particles of PST-18NR have a smaller pore size compared with P25. Therefore, more water molecules, which have a high boiling point, may remain inside the smaller pores of the PST-18NR-based electrode compared with the P25-based electrode, inhibiting the electrolyte diffusion into the pore in the PST-18NR. In contrast, the other volatile solvents can evaporate easily after rinsing, leading to the high photocurrent density and the resulting high energy conversion efficiency. VOC and FF did not differ markedly between the two electrodes. Accordingly, the following DSC experiments described below were performed using nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes made from PST-18NR TiO2 particles that were rinsed by ethanol after sensitization.

Fig. 4 shows variation in the photovoltaic parameters as a function of the dipping time of nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrode in dye solution containing acetic acid. With increased dipping time, the short-circuit photocurrent density decreased linearly, while the open-circuit photovoltage initially increased and then decreased steadily. The fill factor increased slightly. Consequently, the energy conversion efficiency reached a maximum at 15 min.

In order to explain the reason why the JSC and VOC decreased with increasing dipping time, the absorbance spectra of Monascus yellow which was adsorbed on nanocrystalline-TiO2 film were measured with the variation of dipping time. Although the absorbance was constant after 15 min (the data are not shown), the absorption peak shifted to shorter wavelength significantly (Fig. 5). The blue shift may suggest re-arrangement of dye molecule on the nanocrystalline-TiO2 films and formation of H-aggregation, which can be center of charge recombination and decrease the photovoltaic effects: JSC and VOC.28

Fig. 6 displays the current–voltage curve of Monascus yellow DSC under the optimized conditions. The cell revealed a short-circuit photocurrent density of 6.1 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage of 0.57 V, and a fill factor of 0.66, yielding an energy conversion efficiency of 2.3% under standard AM1.5 conditions.

In conclusion, Monascus yellow was found to be the best photosensitizer for use in DSCs compared with other natural dyes, except for chlorophyll dyes.9,10 When the film is sensitized without acetic acid treatment, the IPCE value decreased to zero. For treatment with acetic acid, Monascus yellow can be bound to the surface of the nanocrystalline-TiO2 film, facilitating the injection of electrons from the excited state of Monascus yellow to the conduction band of TiO2. Protic solvents such as ethanol are suitable as a rinsing solvent for the preparation of the PST-18NR electrodes that exhibit high cell performance, while water had an adverse effect. Under the optimized conditions, the Monascus yellow-sensitized DSC showed energy conversion efficiency as high as 2.3%. These results clearly show that the application of natural dye to DSCs as a photosensitizer is promising for the realization of high cell performance, low-cost production, and non-toxicity. It should be emphasized here that natural dyes from food are better for human health than synthetic dyes. Specifically, Monascus yellow could be used in a kit for students studying DSCs in school.
