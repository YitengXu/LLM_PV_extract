    , Accepted 2nd January 2015First published on 2nd January 2015AbstractIn this report, we demonstrate the superior performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with novel, metal-free counter electrodes (CEs) comprised of copolymer-templated nitrogen-enriched nanocarbons (CTNCs) with well-controlled morphology, nanoporosity, and nitrogen content. This superior performance is due to the high catalytic activity of CTNCs toward the reduction of Co(bpy)32+/3+, as evidenced by unusually low charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the CE–electrolyte interface. The observed activity is attributed to the combination of the high surface area of CTNCs afforded by a three-dimensional, hierarchical pore structure, and to their unique electronic properties stemming from the presence of nitrogen heteroatoms located on the edges of nanographitic domains. Altogether, the use of CTNC CEs enhanced the efficiency and fill factor (FF) of JK-306 dye, Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple based DSSCs at one sun illumination up to 10.32% and 73.5%, respectively, suggesting the considerable promise of these materials as an attractive alternative to costly Pt-based CEs. Interestingly, the use of CTNCs did not lead to the analogous beneficial lowering of RCT in I−/I3− redox couple based N719-sensitized DSSCs, limiting their FF and short circuit current density (JSC). This chemical specificity indicates that the type of nitrogen bonding configurations, rather than the total N-content, is the key factor determining the catalytic activity.
Introduction
In the last two decades, nanocarbon materials, such as fullerenes,1 carbon nanotubes,2 graphene,3 graphene oxide,4 and a broad range of other heteroatom enriched nanocarbons, have gained attention for their applications in sustainable energy devices. Of particular interest are many recent reports of high electrocatalytic performance of nitrogen (N)-enriched nanocarbon materials and their applications in supercapacitors,5 sensors,6 electrocatalytic oxygen reduction,7 and most recently CO2 reduction.8 One of the common traits of N-enriched nanocarbons in these applications is their apparent ability to act as highly efficient electron donating, catalytic electrodes.9 This ability is typically attributed to the charge density polarization caused by the difference in electronegativity between carbon (χ = 2.55) and nitrogen (χ = 3.04);10 however, the significance of the interplay between the heteroatom content and material nanostructure has yet to be fully understood.
Work described herein is largely inspired by results obtained in our laboratories in recent years with nitrogen-enriched nanocarbons obtained through a soft-templating method, utilizing the block copolymers of poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) as a sacrificial component and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as a nitrogen-rich carbon source (Scheme 1).5b,7a,11 The insights into structure–performance relationships facilitated by a high degree of independent control over nanostructure and composition of these materials lead us to propose the following additional functional benefits of nitrogen heteroatoms: (i) stabilization of nonbonding-electron rich zigzag edges of nanographitic domains12 and (ii) coordination of electrochemical substrates by lone-pair electrons on pyridinic edge nitrogens.11c,13
 Scheme 1  PBA-b-PAN block copolymer self-assembles into a bicontinuous nanostructure. Stabilization and pyrolysis of the polymer yields a nanostructured, partially graphitic carbon with nitrogen heteroatoms facing pore walls. (Partially adapted from ref. 11f). 
In the present report, we demonstrate how these structural features allow CTNCs to function as an efficient replacement for expensive platinum (Pt)-based counter-electrodes (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In addition to the cost, one of the additional motivations in the search for the replacement of Pt in DSSC CEs is the limited stability of Pt in corrosive solutions.14 The cost and stability of CEs are one of the limiting factors in the large scale applications of DSSCs as a renewable energy technology. To date, the numerous attempts to replace Pt in CEs included inorganic semiconductors,15 conductive polymers,16 and carbon-based materials.17 The latter are among the most attractive candidates owing to their low cost, abundance, and relative stability in corrosive electrolytes. Of particular interest in this regard are N-enriched carbons such as those described in a recent report by Hou et al.,18 who demonstrated that the incorporation of pyridinic and quaternary nitrogens can effectively promote the reduction of I3−. In addition, Han et al.19 recently showed that cobalt-sulfide particles coated in N-doped graphene showed a catalytic reduction of I3− with a performance better than Pt, also citing pyridinic- and quaternary-N as being responsible for higher catalytic activity.
The present study was motivated by the expectation that the ease and efficiency with which CTNCs can supply electrons for reduction reactions will lead to good performance as CEs in DSSCs. In addition, the full integration of N-heteroatoms in carbon frameworks, which occurs during the pyrolysis of PAN block copolymer precursors, was obtained according to Scheme 1, with the expectation that CTNCs will exhibit enhanced electrochemical stability as CEs in comparison to N-enriched carbons, where heteroatoms are introduced by post-pyrolysis methods.5b
The recent introduction of cobalt polypyridyl electrolytes has greatly improved the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs over those utilizing the “traditional” triiodide-based electrolyte.20 Their primary advantage is the improvement of open-circuit voltage and reduced corrosiveness towards noble-metal counter electrodes. However, cobalt-based redox shuttles suffer from slow regeneration at the counter electrode and poor stability of cells with Co(bpy)32+/3+ due to the loss of ligands during reduction at the CE.21 This has prompted the search for a counter electrode that can efficiently reduce cobalt complexes without damaging the ligand system.
To assess the suitability of CTNCs as a replacement for Pt in DSSCs, we have used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to measure their ability to efficiently reduce cobalt and iodide redox shuttles as manifested by the charge-transfer resistance (RCT). Special attention has been given to the impact of the porosity of electrodes on charge/mass transport. Following this assessment, fully functional DSSCs were assembled with CTNC CEs, and their performance was measured as a function of material processing conditions and redox couples. Altogether, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs with CTNC electrodes only matched or slightly exceeded those of with Pt ones, whereas their cyclability turned out to be vastly superior in cobalt-based electrolytes. This is of particular importance because Pt CEs suffer from poor stability in cobalt-based systems, which would be otherwise preferable due to their superior open-circuit voltage (Voc).
Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and morphology
CTNCs were synthesized by the pyrolysis of PAN-b-PBA copolymer. The synthesis of PAN-b-PBA by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has been published elsewhere.22 A PAN-b-PBA copolymer with number average degrees of polymerization of 99 and 70 for PAN and PBA, respectively, (dispersity index Đ = 1.18) was used in this study, resulting in bicontinuous porous nanostructured CTNCs. The polymer was stabilized through the crosslinking of the PAN block at 280 °C for 1 h under air flow (150 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1, purged with N2 gas for 1 h during cooling, and then pyrolyzed at 600–1000 °C for 0.5 h under N2 gas flow (150 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. CTNCs prepared by various pyrolysis temperatures exhibited very similar BET surface areas (∼460–570 m2 g−1, Table S1†), whereas the nitrogen content, determined by XPS, dramatically dropped with increasing pyrolysis temperatures (Fig. S1a and Table S2†). The choice of PAN-b-PBA copolymer composition used herein was dictated by the results of our previous studies, which demonstrated that this range of block ratios assures the preservation of morphology upon pyrolysis, as illustrated in Fig. 1.11d
 Fig. 1  (a) Annealed PBA-b-PAN thin film obtained using AFM, showing a bicontinuous morphology. (b) SEM image of the thin-film of PBA-b-PAN stabilized and pyrolyzed at 400 °C to remove the PBA block. (c) SEM image of the thin-film of PBA-b-PAN, stabilized and pyrolyzed at 700 °C (CTNC-700). 
In the subsequent discussion, CTNC-XXX will be used to denote CTNCs carbonized at various temperatures, where “XXX” stands for the pyrolysis temperature in °C. CTNCs were fabricated into functional CEs by an electrospray coating process, detailed in the ESI.† The transmittances of the as-prepared electrodes were approximately 30% at 550 nm (Fig. S2†). Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of FTO-patterned glass spray coated with CTNCs to create a uniform coating of carbon. Importantly, CTNCs retained their nanostructure during dispersing and spray coating, yielding a high surface area coating on the FTO.

Electrocatalytic performance in dummy cells
EIS measurements carried out on symmetric dummy cells confirmed the suitability of CTNCs as CEs for both redox couples, with particularly good performance for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) system, which is to enable DSSCs with both high voltage and current, leading to remarkable PCEs.23 As the primary measure of the performance of materials, we used charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the CE–electrolyte interface. EIS spectra, in the form of Nyquist plots, are shown in (Fig. 3a and S3†). In all the cases, the plots show two semicircles in high and low frequency ranges, corresponding to the electron transfer process at the CE–electrolyte interface and the Nernst diffusion process in the electrolyte. By fitting the semicircles of the Nyquist plot with the analytical solution of an equivalent circuit (EC, inset in Fig. 3a),24 one can determine the ohmic series resistance (RS), effective charge transfer resistance (CT), and the Nernst diffusion impedance in the bulk electrolyte (ZN). The model also includes a constant phase element (CPE) describing deviation from the ideal capacitance (Cdl) due to the surface roughness of the electrodes. As shown in the inset, for porous electrodes, to take into account the additional impedance Zn.pore, which might arise from the inhibited diffusion of electrolyte through the network of pores, the effective charge transfer resistance (CT) can be expressed as the sum as follows:24 CT = RCT + ZN,pore(1)where RCT is strictly associated with the charge transfer process. The ZN,pore term can be neglected for nonporous Pt CEs; however, its significance needs to be assessed for porous CEs such as CTNCs used in the present study.2523 Furthermore, ZN,pore may be expected to be of particular importance for bulkier redox couples such as cobalt-based complexes. As shown in Fig. S4a,† a CTNC-800 dummy cell reached a steady-state current level shortly after the potential step, which indicates that transport is limited by bulk diffusion rather than by diffusion through pores, described by the ZN,pore term. Thus, the measured effective charge-transfer resistance (eqn (1)) is controlled only by the RCT term, which originates from the limitations to bulk mass transport and to charge transfer at the electrode.

The corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in the inset. (b) The corresponding Nyquist plots for I−/I3− redox couple. 
The values of RCT obtained by EIS fitting (Fig. 3a) for CTNCs pyrolyzed at different temperatures are summarized together with other fitted parameters in Table S3.† All the CTNCs, except for the one pyrolyzed at 600 °C, exhibited values of RCT lower by a factor of four than that of Pt. Such a significant lowering of RCT is of great advantage, because the lower total internal resistance improves the fill factor (FF). Lower RCT implies more efficient reduction of redox species at the CE–electrolyte interface, which in turn improves the efficiency of the dye-regeneration process at the dye-coated TiO2/electrolyte interface. To address the question of whether the lower RCT arises from an intrinsically higher catalytic activity, or from the high surface area of CTNCs, electrochemically active surface areas (EASAs) were calculated from the results of chronoamperometric (CA) measurements according to the Randles–Sevcik equation (eqn (S3)†). Comparison of such obtained values (Fig. S5†) reveals that they were very similar, within 10%. Given the fact that the values of the RCT of the best-performing CTNC were approximately four times lower than for Pt CEs, it can be concluded that the primary factor of the enhanced electrochemical performance of CTNC electrodes was the better efficiency of charge transfer at the interface.
The enhanced electrochemical performance of CTNC electrodes in comparison with Pt was also observed for dummy cells with the I−/I3− redox couple, although it was not as pronounced, as evident from the comparisons of the radii of the smallest semicircle of the Nyquist plots (Fig. 3b). Consistent with the smaller size of the iodide redox species in comparison with cobalt, the radius of the second semicircle (middle frequency) for Pt electrode was now almost an order of magnitude smaller. Interestingly, for CTNC-800, the smaller size of the redox species, however, did not lead to a similar reduction of the radius of the middle-frequency semicircle, probably indicating that the increased mobility of the smaller redox shuttle was counter balanced by its increased ability to diffuse in and out of nanopores. Similar conclusions could be reached from the inspection of potential-step CA plots for this redox system (Fig. S4b†), based on the fact that for porous CTNC-800, the current did reach a steady state over the period of measurement.
Further indications of the higher electrocatalytic activity of CTNCs come from the comparison of the CV curves of CTNC-800 and Pt electrodes in the Co(bpy)32+/3+ system acquired with different scan rates and are presented in Fig. 4a and b. The higher slopes of linear dependence of the reduction and oxidation currents on the square root of potential and their currents (Fig. 4c and d, respectively) observed for CTNC-800 suggest its higher electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of Co(bpy)33+. It also indicates that the redox reactions on CTNC-800 are controlled by ionic diffusion in bulk electrolyte, in agreement with the EIS and CA measurements (Fig. 3a and S4†). Altogether, these results indicate that the superior performance of CTNC electrodes in comparison to Pt is rooted in their ability to facilitate faster charge transfer to the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple.

DSSC photovoltaic performance
Given their highly favorable electrochemical performance in comparison to Pt, CTNCs were utilized as CEs in TiO2-based DSSCs with thin-film 8.5 (5.5 + 3) μm anodes comprised of with film thickness is active and scattering layer, respectively. As in previous sections, two organic sensitizer/redox shuttle systems were tested: the JK-306 (ref. 26) dye and HC-A co-adsorbent with Co(bpy)32+/3+ (see Fig S1†), and the ruthenium-based N719 dye with I−/I3−. HC-A has multiple functions, including light-harvesting at short wavelengths, increasing JSC, and preventing the π–π stacking of the JK-306 organic dye, which enhances Voc by reducing charge recombination processes and promoting hole transport.27 The comparison of J–V curves for Pt and CTNC-800 CEs for both systems obtained under one-sun illumination is shown in Fig. 5a and b. Key performance parameters for these systems are listed in Table 1. Additional J–V curves and performance parameters for other CTNC electrodes are presented in ESI (Fig. S6 and S7, and Table S4†). As evident from the results listed in Table 1, for both redox systems, the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with CTNC-800 CEs matched or even slightly exceeded that of the devices with Pt CEs. This is not surprising given the superior electrochemical performance of CTNC-800 in comparison with Pt. To this end, lower charge transfer resistance of CTNC electrodes, also observed in dummy cells, was evident in the EIS measurements of complete DSSC devices. RCT (fitted from the first semicircle) of the CTNC-800 was 0.97 Ω cm2, whereas the corresponding value of the Pt CE was 2.11 Ω cm2.

The lower RCT of CTNC electrodes is most likely responsible for the higher FF for JK-306/HC-A/Co(bpy)32+/3+ DSSCs with CTNC-800 cathodes versus those with Pt (73% vs. 70%). Another possible benefit of this low RCT is the improved dynamic response of DSSCs, as evident from the results of EIS and photocurrent dynamic measurements (Fig. 5c and d). As shown in Fig. 5d, the ratio of initial peak current to steady-state current of the Pt-based DSSC was slightly higher than that of the CTNC-800-based devices, indicating that the slower mass transport can also lead to losses in the photocurrent of the DSSC, which is in good agreement with the CA measurements (Fig. S4†).
Results presented so far indicate that the low RCT of CTNC electrodes makes them a viable replacement for Pt in DSSCs. As shown in this section, another major advantage of CTNCs over Pt may be their superior electrochemical stability and cyclability, which is still one of the major challenges associated with DSSCs. Fig. 6a and b show the electrochemical stability of the dummy cells with CTNC-800 and Pt CEs under cumulative potential cycling with Co(bpy)32+/3+ in acetonitrile. After 100 cycles, the RCT values for Pt CEs increased by nearly 400% (3.10 to 11.26 Ω cm2), while for CTNC-800 only a very modest increase was observed (0.35 to 0.45 Ω cm2). The slower deterioration of RCT for CTNC-800 compared to Pt clearly indicates the higher stability of CTNC-800 in the acetonitrile/Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte (Fig. 6c). Superior electrochemical stability of CTNC-800 was also confirmed by the EIS measurements of dummy cells after aging the two electrodes at room temperature and open circuit (Fig. 6d). The EIS curve of the CTNC-800 electrode over the period of 14 days was nearly unchanged, while the EIS curves for Pt showed evidence of a progressive increase of the resistance upon aging. It should be noted that the improvement of DSSC stability with carbon-based electrodes in this redox system has already been reported recently by our group, using N-doped graphene nanoplatelets (NGnP) synthesized through the ball-milling of graphene in a nitrogen atmosphere.9 CTNCs exhibit higher electrocatalytic performance and better electrochemical stability than the NGnPs, which have a higher content of pyrrolic N than pyridinic N.9,10 This superior performance stability of CTNCs even compared to NGnPs suggests the importance of the full covalent incorporation of heteroatoms within the carbon framework afforded by nitrogen-rich carbon precursors.

This sequence of electrochemical stability testing was repeated 10 times. (c) RCT changes in the Pt and CTNC-800 according to the potential cycling. (d) Nyquist plots of symmetrical dummy cells consisting of Pt and CTNC-800 (inset) collected after 3 days (black), 7 days (red) and 14 days (green) of aging at room temperate and open circuit. 
Conclusions
In summary, a series of copolymer-templated N-enriched nanocarbons (CTNCs) with well-controlled porosity and nitrogen-heteroatom enrichment were shown to be efficient, metal-free electrocatalysts for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple with charge-transfer resistance significantly lower than platinum (0.31 vs. 1.35 Ω cm2). The CTNC-based DSSCs showed better electrochemical stability than platinum and other N-doped carbon-based devices under prolonged potential-cycling, which can be attributed not only to three-dimensional hierarchical pore structures with high surface area, but also to covalent N-doping in carbon framework. This also suggests that the configuration of nitrogen states, rather than total nitrogen content, have a significant influence on the catalytic activity of carbon in DSSCs. Overall, CTNCs are a promising metal-free alternative for costly platinum-based electrodes in organic-dye based DSSCs with Co-complex redox electrolytes.
Experimental section
Details of the chemical structures, the cell fabrication methods and photochemical measurements are described in the ESI.†
Materials
An organic dye of JK-306 and a hole-conducting coadsorbent of HC-A were synthesized following the same procedures as described elsewhere.26,27
Gas adsorption measurements
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were collected using a Quantachrome Autosorb 1-C. Prior to measurements, samples were degassed at 300 °C under vacuum overnight. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were determined from N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K. Multipoint BET measurements were performed at relative pressures (P/P0) in the range of 0.05–0.20.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS measurements were performed with a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer under the pressure of 10−8 torr. The monochromatic X-ray source was Al Kα (1486.6 eV) and the power was 208 W (14 kV, 20 mA). The voltage step size was 0.5 eV for surveys and 0.1 eV for high resolution. The dwell time at every step was 150 ms for surveys, 600 ms for O and C, and 2000 ms for N high resolution. Quantification was performed by applying the appropriate relative sensitivity factors (RSFs, C 1s = 0.297, O 1s = 0.703, N 1s = 0.491) after subtracting Shirley-type background. The deconvolution into component peaks in high resolution peaks were carried out using 7:3 product of Gaussian–Lorentzian line-shape. Binding energy was corrected with reference to C 1s at 285.0 eV.
Electrochemical analysis
All the electrochemical measurements were carried out with a VersaSTAT 3 (Version 1.31), AMETEK connected to a potentiostat under dark conditions at room temperature. The EIS spectra were acquired in the frequency range from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz, at 0 V of open circuit voltage, with an AC modulation amplitude of 10 mV. EIS data analysis was processed using the Zplot/Zview 2 software. Counter electrode on FTO and dye-sensitized solar cells fabrications are described in ESI.†

 	Scheme 1  PBA-b-PAN block copolymer self-assembles into a bicontinuous nanostructure. Stabilization and pyrolysis of the polymer yields a nanostructured, partially graphitic carbon with nitrogen heteroatoms facing pore walls. (Partially adapted from ref. 11f).	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) Annealed PBA-b-PAN thin film obtained using AFM, showing a bicontinuous morphology. (b) SEM image of the thin-film of PBA-b-PAN stabilized and pyrolyzed at 400 °C to remove the PBA block. (c) SEM image of the thin-film of PBA-b-PAN, stabilized and pyrolyzed at 700 °C (CTNC-700).	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images (left column) and corresponding high-pass filtered images of CTNCs pyrolyzed at different temperatures and subsequently spray-coated on FTO electrodes. The high-pass images (right column) show the high surface area nanostructure afforded by the CTNC coating.	 
CT = RCT + ZN,pore	(1)

 	Fig. 3  (a) Nyquist plots of symmetrical dummy cells consisting of CTNC and Pt electrodes with frequency ranging from 106 to 0.1 Hz, and amplitude of the alternating current set to 10 mV using an Co(bpy)32+/3+ based electrolyte. The corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in the inset. (b) The corresponding Nyquist plots for I−/I3− redox couple.	 

 	Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms using CTNC-800 (a) and Pt (b) cathodes in Co(bpy)32+/3+ with various scanning rates. The oxidation (c) and reduction (d) peak currents with respect to the square root of scanning rate.	 

 	Fig. 5  Current density–voltage curves of JK-306-based DSSCs with Pt and CTNC-800 CEs under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G) with (a) Co(bpy)32+/3+ and (b) I−/I3− based electrolytes. All the cells were tested with a metal shadow mask having an aperture area of 0.16 cm2 with unmasked sides (c) Nyquist plots of Co(bpy)32+/3+ DSSCs in the high-frequency range. The inset corresponds to the equivalent circuit in the high-frequency range. (d) Photocurrent dynamics at simulated full AM 1.5G sunlight of the DSSCs with Co(bpy)32+/3+-based Pt and CTNC-800 CEs.	 

CTNC-800	JK-306/Co(bpy)32+/3+	970 ± 8.54	73.5 ± 1.2	14.57 ± 0.30	10.32 ± 0.14
Pt	JK-306/Co(bpy)32+/3+	969 ± 5.29	70.1 ± 0.2	14.43 ± 0.26	9.80 ± 0.20
CTNC-800	N719/I−/I3−	741 ± 3.61	72.9 ± 0.7	14.58 ± 0.20	7.88 ± 0.05
Pt	N719/I−/I3−	736 ± 8.2	74.3 ± 0.4	14.82 ± 0.10	8.11 ± 0.05

 	Fig. 6  Electrochemical stability under potential-cycling on dummy cells with Pt (a), CTNC-800 (b) in acetonitrile solution of Co(bpy)32+/3+. The sequence of measurements was as follows: 10 × CV scans (from 0 V → 1 V → −1 V → 0 V→ 1 V, scan rate 50 mV s−1) followed by 30 s relaxation at 0 V followed by an EIS measurement at 0 V from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz. This sequence of electrochemical stability testing was repeated 10 times. (c) RCT changes in the Pt and CTNC-800 according to the potential cycling. (d) Nyquist plots of symmetrical dummy cells consisting of Pt and CTNC-800 (inset) collected after 3 days (black), 7 days (red) and 14 days (green) of aging at room temperate and open circuit.
