    , Accepted 5th November 2020First published on 6th November 2020AbstractOrganic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have highly tunable light-response ranges, enabling them to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in various scenarios. Until now, most studies of these devices have focused on developing highly efficient OPV cells under the standard AM 1.5G solar radiation. However, light harvesting under indoor lighting conditions is also important, and OPV cells have successfully demonstrated their potential for indoor power generation. To meet the requirements of the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is very important to develop highly efficient OPV cells for both indoor and outdoor applications. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a non-fullerene acceptor HDO-4Cl, which has a well-matched absorption spectrum for both solar and indoor-light radiation spectra. As a result, these OPV cells based on PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl yield a good PCE of 15.5% under AM 1.5G solar illumination and an impressive PCE of 23.4% under light-emitting dioxide illumination at 1000 lux. Our results suggest that OPV cells have great potential for use in various application scenarios.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are regarded as one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies due to their advantageous properties of low weight, flexibility, transparency, and scalable preparation.1–9 To improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPV cells, it is very important to match the absorption spectra of the active materials to the radiation spectra of the light sources. Most previous studies have focused on designing materials for the standard one-sun illumination conditions, i.e., the AM 1.5G solar spectrum. To obtain the most efficient utilization of sunlight, developing low-bandgap donors or acceptors with a strong absorption spectrum in the range 300–900 nm is a crucial task.10–16 For example, when fullerene derivatives were the most popular acceptors, low-bandgap donors such as PTB7-Th and PBTff4T, with absorption onsets at approximately 800 nm, delivered the highest PCEs for OPV cells of ∼11%.17–22 In recent years, non-fullerene acceptors such as ITIC and Y6 have emerged as excellent low-bandgap materials, yielding cutting-edge device performance.23–27
By contrast, the main radiation spectra of indoor light sources such as fluorescent lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) range from 400 to 750 nm, where wide-bandgap materials are preferred.28–34 Therefore, the modification of the absorption spectrum has been carried out in many other photovoltaic technologies to achieve high performance under an indoor environment.35–38 Using highly efficient cells designed for outdoor solar radiation in indoor environments results in significantly lower PCEs due to spectrum mismatch, which is a major problem for portable electronics.32,39 In order to develop highly efficient OPV cells for both outdoor and indoor conditions, the absorption spectrum of the active material needs to be mediated according to the radiation spectrum of the light source. Generating absorption onset in the range 750–900 nm will therefore be necessary. On the one hand, this covers most of the high irradiation power region of the solar spectrum, making it possible to achieve high short-circuit current densities (JSCs) and PCEs under outdoor conditions. On the other hand, decent open-circuit voltages (VOCs) are achievable, which is crucial for obtaining high PCEs under the weak illumination intensities of indoor light sources.
In some recent studies, Y6 and its derivatives have demonstrated very good photovoltaic efficiencies under one-sun illumination conditions.40–45 To also render it suitable for use in indoor OPV cells, here we have chemically modified a Y6 derivative named HD-4Cl by replacing its alkyl chains (on the edge of the thiophene units) with alkoxy chains. As a result of synthesizing HDO-4Cl, the latter shows a 100 nm blueshift in the absorption spectrum compared to HD-4Cl. When blended with the polymer donor PBDB-TF, the main absorption of the active layer ranged from 300 to 820 nm, yielding a good trade-off between indoor and outdoor applications. Furthermore, compared to HD-4Cl, the enlarged bandgap of HDO-4Cl derives from its decreased electron affinity (EA), which does not harm the VOC of the resulting OPV cells. Under one-sun illumination, the PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl-based device showed a respectable PCE of 15.6%, which is very close to the value obtained in the PBDB-TF:HD-4Cl-based devices. Significantly, under a warm white LED lamp (2700 K, 1000 lux), the HDO-4Cl-containing OPV cells operated with an impressive PCE of 23.4%, which is much higher than those of HD-4Cl-containing devices. Our study demonstrates that OPV cells can achieve high efficiencies under various application conditions by rationally designing active layer materials that endow them with the potential for important applications in portable electronics.
Synthesis and fundamental photoelectrical properties
The newly designed acceptor HDO-4Cl was prepared according to Scheme 1. Starting with 3-bromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene, compound 2 was synthesized by a nucleophilic substitution reaction catalyzed by CuO and KI. Subsequently, transetherification of compound 2 with 1-decanol yielded compound 3. Then, treating compound 3 with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at −78 °C, followed by the addition of trimethyltin chloride, yielded compound 4. Compound 5 was synthesized by Stille coupling between compound 4 and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. The key intermediate, compound 6, was obtained by the double intramolecular Cadogan reductive cyclization of compound 5, followed by the addition of 1-bromo-2-hexyldecane under alkaline conditions. Treating compound 5 with Vilsmeier reagent yielded the dialdehyde compound 6. The target product HDO-4Cl was finally synthesized by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction, and had a yield of more than 80%. HDO-4Cl can easily be dissolved in common solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and chlorobenzene. Detailed synthetic procedures and structural characterizations are provided in the experimental section of the ESI.† During the preparation of this article, Yan and coworkers reported an alkoxy chain-substituted Y6-O and studied its applications under indoor lighting conditions.46 In this work, however, we used chlorinated terminal groups, as they have lower energy losses in OPV devices.47 Moreover, the long alkyl chains of 2-hexyldecyl instead of 2-butyloctyl are substituted onto the pyrrole rings to ensure the solubility of the resulting material. In order to make a fair comparison, the atom numbers of the alkyl chains in HD-4Cl and those of the alkoxy chains in HDO-4Cl were kept the same (Fig. 1a).

The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of HDO-4Cl and HD-4Cl are shown in Fig. 1b. In chloroform solution, the main absorption band of HD-4Cl is located in the range 640–800 nm, with a peak at 746 nm. Compared to HD-4Cl, the absorption peak of HDO-4Cl exhibited a blueshift of 30 nm. In the film state, the two acceptors displayed clearly redshifted absorptions compared to those of their solutions. The absorption onset of the HDO-4Cl film was located at 820 nm, which is about 100 nm more blueshifted than that of the HD-4Cl film. When compared with HD-4Cl, HDO-4Cl is more suitable for indoor applications as its absorption is more matched to the radiation spectra of indoor light sources. To investigate how the alkoxy substituent affects the molecular energy levels, we conducted cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on the two acceptors (Fig. S1a, ESI†). As illustrated in Fig. 1c, the ionization potentials (IPs) of HD-4Cl and HDO-4Cl are almost identical to each other, while the EA of HDO-4Cl is 180 meV lower than that of HD-4Cl. These results suggest that the replacement of the alkyl chains with alkoxy groups decreased the EAs mainly, and thus enlarged the bandgap, which is consistent with the blueshift in the absorption spectrum. The downshifted EA is beneficial for obtaining high VOC values, and thus for maintaining low energy losses in these devices.48,49
In our previous studies, we investigated the influence of alkoxy groups on the fundamental optical and electronic properties of non-fullerene acceptors.50 For example, replacing the alkyl chains of IEIC with alkoxy groups significantly upshifted the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and narrowed the bandgap, which is a very different result when compared to that obtained in this case. To gain more insight into how the alkoxy group affects the energy levels and absorption spectra, we conducted theoretical calculations on the two molecules using density functional theory (DFT). As presented in Fig. S1b (ESI†), the calculated HOMO values were −5.64 and −5.65 eV for HDO-4Cl and HD-4Cl, respectively. In contrast, the calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) value of HDO-4Cl (−3.46 eV) was higher than that of HD-4Cl (−3.65 eV). The calculated frontier molecular orbital energy levels were consistent with the measured CV results. From the electron density distributions of the frontier orbitals, we can show that the electron density distribution of the LUMO extends over the end-groups, while that of the HOMO is located mainly on the central part. It can be deduced that the changes in electron density on the terminal groups affect mainly the LUMO level rather than the HOMO level. Fig. 1d shows the electrostatic potential (ESP) distributions of the two acceptors. We can show that the ESP values on the terminal moieties of HDO-4Cl are much lower than those of HD-4Cl, indicating that HDO-4Cl has a higher electron density. This difference should be ascribed to the electron-donating feature of oxygen atoms, and the electron can be easily delocalized on the terminal moieties.
Crystalline properties
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were utilized to study the molecular stacking properties of neat films of HD-4Cl and HDO-4Cl. From the two-dimensional (2D) scattering patterns shown in Fig. 2a and b, the two acceptors show pronounced (010) π–π stacking peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, implying preferential face-on orientations with respect to the substrates. Calculated from the line-cut profiles shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the π–π stacking distances of HD-4Cl and HDO-4Cl were 3.69 and 3.63 Å, respectively. To evaluate the intermolecular interactions during self-assembly of the materials, we optimized the geometry of the cofacial dimeric molecules and calculated the intermolecular binding energies. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, correcting for the basis set superposition error, the binding energies (ΔG) of the HD-4Cl and HDO-4Cl dimeric structures were −40.45 and −41.34 kcal mol−1, respectively.51 The decreased binding energy of HDO-4Cl may be related to its enhanced molecular dipole moment (Fig. S3, ESI†) and is consistent with the closer π–π stacking distances.52,53 According to the Scherrer equation, the crystal coherence lengths (Lcs) were calculated to be 23.17 and 28.29 Å for HD-4Cl and HDO-4Cl, respectively. From the above results, we can rationally deduce that the introduction of alkoxy groups enhanced the crystalline properties of the acceptor effectively. We then fabricated electron-only devices using the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/acceptor/Al to estimate the charge transport properties of the acceptors. Calculated from the current density–voltage (J–V) in the space-charge-limited current region (Fig. S4, ESI†), the electron mobility of HDO-4Cl (1.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was slightly higher than that of HD-4Cl (1.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of HD-4Cl and HDO-4Cl under one-sun illumination and indoor lighting sources, the wide-bandgap polymer donor PBDB-TF was selected to fabricate OPV cells. All of the devices adopted the conventional architecture of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-TF:acceptor/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]dibromide (PFN-Br)/Al, where the PEDOT:PSS and PFN-Br acted as the anode and cathode interlayers, respectively. To obtain the optimal device performance, we carefully optimized the fabrication conditions, including host solvent, additive, donor:acceptor ratio, and thermal annealing temperature. The device fabrication details are provided in the ESI.† The J–V curves of the optimized devices under one-sun illumination are plotted in Fig. 3a, and the detailed parameters are collected in Table 1. The HD-4Cl based device outputs a maximum PCE of 15.7%, with a VOC of 0.854 V, a JSC of 25.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 72.3%, which are similar to our previously reported results.54 By contrast, the HDO-4Cl-based device showed an improved VOC of 0.940 V, which was higher than that of the HD-4Cl-based device by 86 mV. Due to the narrowed photon-response region, the JSC was decreased to 21.9 mA cm−2 for the HDO-4Cl-based device. An impressive FF of 76.0% was recorded, which may be ascribed to the better blend morphology and charge transport properties of the HDO-4Cl-containing film.

Fig. 3b displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best devices, which shows that both devices had maximum EQE values of greater than 80%. The calculated integrated current densities were 24.5 and 21.1 mA cm−2 for the devices based on HD-4Cl and HDO-4Cl, respectively. It should be noted that the photo-response regions of the devices are beyond 750 nm. Therefore, when subjecting them to illumination conditions under indoor light sources, such as warm LED (2700 K), the EQE response regions above 750 nm will not contribute to the current density. Moreover, as the output current density is very low, it is not easy to obtain reliable values. Therefore, comparing the integrated current density with the output JSC in the J–V measurements is very important to ensure that the results obtained are reliable.
In our study of the photovoltaic performance of OPV devices illuminated under indoor light sources, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), we first measured the absolute spectra of the LED light source (2700 K) using a high-precision fiber optics spectrometer (Maya2000 Pro, Ocean Optics). At light intensities of 200, 500, and 1000 lux, the values of the calculated total integrated power over the entire spectral region should be 61.8, 154.5, and 309.0 μW cm−2 (Table 2), respectively. Combining the EQE spectra, the theoretical integrated current densities can be calculated. For the HD-4Cl-based device, at light intensities of 200, 500, and 1000 lux, the current densities were calculated as 23.5, 58.5, and 117.1 μA cm−2 (Fig. 3c, d and Fig. S6, ESI†), respectively. The HDO-4Cl-based device showed current densities very close to those of the HD-4Cl-based device under the same light intensities, as their EQE values showed few differences in the region below 750 nm.

We then measured the J–V curves of the devices under varying light intensities of 200, 500, and 1000 lux. As shown in Fig. 3e and f, the OPV cells showed gradually increasing values of JSC and VOC with increasing light intensity from 200 to 1000 lux. At the same light intensity, the output JSC values of the two devices were quite close to each other and were consistent with the integrated values from the EQE spectra, suggesting that the measurements were reliable. When compared to the devices under one-sun illumination, the OPV cells under indoor light conditions showed significantly decreased VOC values. For example, under a light intensity of 500 lux, the VOC of the HDO-4Cl-based device decreased from 0.940 to 0.779 V, corresponding to a decrease of 161 mV. By contrast, the larger VOC decrease of 198 mV resulted in the HD-4Cl-based device outputting a VOC of only 0.656 V under the same conditions. In addition, we can show that the FF values of the HD-4Cl-based devices were lower than 0.7, showing an obvious decrease when compared with the values measured under one-sun illumination. By contrast, the HDO-4Cl-based devices showed relatively low differences in FF under various illumination conditions. This may be connected to the more ordered intermolecular packing in HDO-4Cl, which suppresses charge recombination efficiently at low charge densities. As a result, the HDO-4Cl-based OPV cells showed a maximum PCE of 23.4%, with a VOC of 0.793 V, a JSC of 120.2 μA cm−2, and an FF of 0.757, while the HD-4Cl-based device had a PCE of only 19.9% at the same light intensity of 1000 lux. To further improve the PCE of OPV cells to greater than 25%, or even 30%, under indoor light conditions, blueshifted absorption spectra are much to be desired. In such a case, however, the PCEs of the resulting devices will suffer a large decrease under an outdoor solar radiation environment.
Blend morphology characterization
To investigate the effects of blend morphology on device performance, GIWAXS and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, both the PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl and PBDB-TF:HD-4Cl blend films exhibited a strong (010) diffraction peak in the OOP direction, indicating a preferential face-on orientation for the two blend films. It can be rationally inferred that the blend film diffraction peaks are overlapped by the neat donor and acceptors because the donor PBDB-TF also adopts a preferential face-on orientation similar to pristine acceptors with similar π–π stacking distances. Specifically, from the 1D profile plot (Fig. S7, ESI†), the calculated π–π stacking distances are 3.72 Å and 3.69 Å for PBDB-TF:HD-4Cl and PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl blend films. Additionally, the (010) crystal coherence lengths of PBDB-TF:HD-4Cl and PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl films are calculated to be 18.0 and 23.0 Å, respectively. The closer packing distance and larger coherence length indicate that PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl exhibited stronger and more ordered intermolecular packing properties, which is also confirmed by AFM measurements (Fig. 4c–f). From the AFM height image, the PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl blend film presents a relatively large root-mean-square surface roughness (1.29 nm) than that (1.24 nm) of PBDB-TF:HD-4Cl. The phase patterns reveal that the phase separation domains in PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl are slightly larger than those in the PBDB-TF:HD-4Cl combination.

Conclusions
We have studied how to design highly efficient OPV cells for both outdoor and indoor applications. By taking a low-bandgap non-fullerene HD-4Cl as the starting material, we have designed and synthesized a non-fullerene acceptor HDO-4Cl by introducing alkoxy groups. This modification raises the EA level by 180 meV and blueshifts the absorption spectrum by 100 nm, making HDO-4Cl more suitable for indoor-light applications. Under one-sun illumination, both of the devices based on HD-4Cl or HDO-4Cl showed PCEs of approximately 15.5%. Impressively, under a simulated indoor environment illuminated by a warm LED light (2700 K, 1000 lux), the HDO-4Cl-based cells had a PCE of 23.4%, while the HD-4Cl-based devices had a relatively low PCE of only 19.9%. These results demonstrate that excellent photovoltaic performance in both outdoor and indoor scenarios can be achieved simultaneously for OPV cells by rationally modulating the properties of the active materials, especially their absorption spectra.
