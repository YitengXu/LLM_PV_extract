    , Accepted 12th April 2016First published on 13th April 2016AbstractTwo D–A copolymers PThzTITI and PSezTITI, based on a zigzag fused-ring acceptor unit zTITI, were developed. They possess low HOMO energy levels around −5.6 eV. PSezTITI:PC71BM solar cells gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.36%. All solar cells produced very high Voc up to 1.08 V.
Donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated copolymers,1 consisting of electron-donating and electron-accepting units, are widely used as donor materials in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.2 The ladder-type units are promising building blocks for constructing D–A copolymers due to the following advantages: (a) the rigid and coplanar aromatic structure induces strong π–π stacking of the polymer backbone and improves charge carrier mobility; (b) the extended conjugation favors π-electron delocalization through the polymer backbone, thus broadening the absorption spectra to harvest more photons; (c) alkyl side chains can be facilely introduced into polymers for good solubility.3 Some linear and zigzag ladder-type units have been developed.4 Compared with linear analogues, zigzag ladder-type units possess deeper HOMO levels, and endow the copolymers with high mobility.5 Most of the reported zigzag ladder-type units are donor units, and zigzag ladder-type acceptor units are rare.
A pentacyclic lactam acceptor unit, thieno[2′,3′:5,6]pyrido[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]-isoquinoline-5,11(4H,10H)-dione (TPTI), was first reported by Ding et al.,6 and the D–A copolymer PThTPTI gave a decent PCE of 9.20%.6b Recently, Ding et al. developed a linear ladder-type acceptor unit, thieno[3′,2′:3,4]isoquinolino[8,7-h]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-6,13(7H,14H)-dione (TITI), by replacing the benzene of TPTI with naphthalene, and the D–A copolymer PSeTITI gave a PCE of 6.17%.7 In this work, we synthesized an isomer of TITI, thieno[3′,2′:3,4]isoquinolino[6,5-f]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-6,13(7H,14H)-dione (zTITI), which is a zigzag ladder-type building block. Two D–A copolymers PThzTITI and PSezTITI were synthesized by using zTITI as the acceptor unit and thiophene or selenophene as the donor unit (Scheme 1). The optical, electrochemical, charge-transport, and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were studied. PSezTITI:PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 2.36%. Voc of the devices reached 1.08 V, which is among the highest Voc for single-junction solar cells.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for PThzTITI and PSezTITI. 
1,5-Dibromonaphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (1)4a reacted with oxalyl chloride and N-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-3-amine successively to give compound 2 in 81.8% yield. Compound 2 was transformed into zTITI in 65.7% yield via intramolecular cyclization using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst. In the 1H NMR spectrum of zTITI (Fig. S1, ESI†), there are two double-peaks for protons on naphthalene (9.12–8.83 ppm) and two double-peaks for protons on thiophenes (7.72–7.28 ppm), confirming the chemical structure of zTITI. zTITI was then brominated by using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to obtain zTITI-Br in 67.7% yield. D–A copolymers PThzTITI and PSezTITI were synthesized by copolymerization of zTITI-Br and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl) thiophene or 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl) selenophene in 76.3% and 95.2% yield, respectively. PThzTITI and PSezTITI, with octyldodecyl side chains, possess good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene and toluene. As determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of PThzTITI and PSezTITI were 62.2 kDa and 85.8 kDa, with polydispersity indexes (PDI) of 2.10 and 3.56, respectively. PThzTITI and PSezTITI show excellent thermostability with high decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% wt loss) of 418 °C and 423 °C, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PThzTITI and PSezTITI in chloroform solution (1 × 10−5 M) and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The polymers exhibit two absorption peaks in both solution and solid state. The short-wavelength peaks result from intramolecular charge transfer, and the long-wavelength peaks result from π–π stacking. From solution to solid state, PThzTITI and PSezTITI show slight red shifts of 4 nm and 8 nm, respectively. PSezTITI showed a larger red shift than PThzTITI, which might be due to the strong Se⋯Se interaction.8 The optical bandgap (Eoptg) of PSezTITI is 1.97 eV, which is ∼0.08 eV lower than that of PThzTITI, resulting from stronger electron-donating capability of selenophene.

Cyclic voltammograms for PThzTITI and PSezTITI are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the electrochemical data are listed in Table 1. The oxidation onset potential (Eonox) and the reduction onset potential (Eonred) are 0.84 V and −2.02 V for PThzTITI and 0.85 V and −1.98 V for PSezTITI, respectively. The energy levels for polymers were calculated according to the formula: HOMO or LUMO = −(Eox or Ered + 4.8) eV. PThzTITI and PSezTITI possess deep HOMO levels of −5.64 and −5.65 eV, respectively, which are ∼0.1 eV lower than those of PThTITI and PSeTITI.7 HOMO levels for PThzTITI and PSezTITI getting deeper might result from the increase in the aromaticity of zTITI, when the linear backbone is changed to the zigzag one. Deep HOMO benefits Voc of BHJ solar cells. The electrochemical bandgaps for PThzTITI and PSezTITI are 2.86 and 2.83 eV, respectively. The difference between electrochemical bandgap and optical bandgap is ∼0.8 eV, which might be due to the polymer/electrode interface barrier.
Solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were prepared to investigate the photovoltaic properties of PThzTITI and PSezTITI. The optimization of D/A ratio, active layer thickness, and additive content is provided in the ESI† (Tables S1–S6). As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) effectively improved device performance. After adding 3 vol% DIO, the PCE for PThzTITI cells quadrupled to 0.98% with an outstanding Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 1.60 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56.8%. And the PCE for PSezTITI cells increased tenfold to 2.36% with a Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 3.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59.6%. DIO improved device performance significantly by enhancing the photocurrent. Owing to deep HOMO levels, PThzTITI and PSezTITI solar cells possess impressively high Voc of 1.08 V and 1.05 V, respectively, which are ∼0.11 V higher than those of PThTITI and PSeTITI cells.7 Compared with PThzTITI cells, PSezTITI cells showed a much higher EQE with a maximum of 26.9% (Fig. 2b). The higher EQE for PSezTITI cells confirmed the higher Jsc than that of PThzTITI cells. The integrated photocurrents from EQE spectra are 1.57 mA cm−2 and 3.75 mA cm−2 for PThzTITI and PSezTITI cells, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc from J–V measurements.

The surface morphology of active layers was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Polymer:PC71BM blend films without DIO showed large PC71BM domains with diameters of a few hundred nanometers (Fig. 3a and c), and D/A interfaces were not sufficient for exciton dissociation, leading to a low photocurrent. After adding 3 vol% DIO, the large domains disappeared and the blend films became uniform and smooth (Fig. 3b and d). Compared with the PThzTITI:PC71BM blend film, the PSezTITI:PC71BM blend film showed decreased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (1.97 nm vs. 8.35 nm) and evenly distributed nanofibers9 with diameters around ∼11 nm. Generally, in BHJ solar cells, the exciton diffusion length is ∼5–20 nm, and the nanofibers in the PSezTITI:PC71BM blend film might provide more D/A interfaces for exciton dissociation and also form a 3D channel for fast charge transport, thus leading to higher Jsc and FF.

As determined by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 4), the PSezTITI:PC71BM blend film possessed a higher hole mobility than the PThzTITI:PC71BM blend film (4.66 × 10−4vs. 2.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which might result from the better interchain charge transfer of selenophene-based polymers.8 The higher hole mobility of the PSezTITI:PC71BM blend film leads to higher EQE and photocurrent for the solar cell. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S8, ESI†) of PThzTITI and PSezTITI films show peaks at 2ϑ = 24.25° and 24.33°, indicating that the π–π stacking d-spacing is 3.67 Å and 3.66 Å, respectively. PSezTITI has a stronger π–π stacking than PThzTITI, leading to a higher hole mobility. However, the hole mobility of PSezTITI is still lower than that of PSeTITI (6.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1),7 which accounts for the low performance of PSezTITI cells.

In summary, a zigzag fused-ring building block zTITI, as a new acceptor unit, was developed. D–A copolymers PThzTITI and PSezTITI were synthesized by copolymerization of zTITI and thiophene or selenophene. This zigzag acceptor unit endows D–A copolymers with deep HOMO levels and outstanding Voc up to 1.08 V. PSezTITI:PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 2.36%. Studies to further modify the zTITI unit to make highly efficient D–A copolymers are ongoing.
Experimental
Patterned ITO glasses with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 were ultrasonically cleaned using detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially, and then subjected to UV-ozone treatment. A 30 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios™ P VP Al 4083) layer was formed on ITO substrates by spin coating PEDOT onto ITO glass (4000 rpm for 30 s). PEDOT substrates were dried at 150 °C for 10 min. A polymer:PC71BM blend in CB with the DIO additive was spin-coated onto the PEDOT layer. Finally, Ca (∼10 nm) and Al (∼100 nm) were successively evaporated onto the active layer under a shadow mask (pressure ca. 10−4 Pa). The effective area of the cells is 4 mm2. The thickness of the active layers was measured using a KLA Tencor D-120 profilometer. J–V curves were measured by using a computerized Keithley 2420 SourceMeter and a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Newport, Oriel 91159A, 150 W, AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The illumination intensity of the solar simulator was determined by using a monocrystalline silicon solar cell (Oriel 91150, 2 cm × 2 cm) calibrated by NIM. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured by using a QE-R3011 measurement system (Enli Tech).
