    , Accepted 5th February 2014First published on 5th February 2014AbstractCarbon nanodots (CNDs) have emerged as fascinating materials with exceptional electronic and optical properties, and thus they offer many promising applications in photovoltaics and photocatalysis. In this paper we investigate electron transfer in nanocomposites of CNDs–graphene oxide (GO), –multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and –TiO2 nanoparticles without linker molecules, using steady state and time-resolved spectroscopy. Significant fluorescence quenching was observed in the CND–GO system, and it is attributed to the ultrafast electron transfer from CNDs to GO with a time constant of 400 fs. In comparison, carbon nanotubes result in static quenching of fluorescence in CNDs. No charge transfer was observed in both CND–MWNT and CND–TiO2 nanocomposites. This finding suggests that the CND–GO nanocomposite can be an excellent candidate for hot carrier solar cells due to the effective carrier extraction, broad spectral absorption, weak electron–phonon scattering, and thus a slow cooling rate for hot carriers.
Introduction
Carbon is one of the most abundant elements on the earth's crust. Carbon nanomaterials have attracted much interest in the development of photovoltaics1,2 and biophotonics3 due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. Carbon nanodots (CNDs) have emerged as promising carbon-based materials due to their high quantum yields (QY ∼80%),3 nontoxicity,4 nonblinking,5 low photobleaching and high photostability and large two-photon cross section.6 CNDs have also been demonstrated to be good electron donors, as well as electron acceptors.7 Therefore, CNDs offer great potential for a broad range of applications in photovoltaics, photocatalysts,7 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),8 sensors,9 surface enhance Raman scattering (SERS)10 and bio-medical imaging.11 Some photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of CNDs, such as λex-dependent emission,12 up-conversion13 and room temperature phosphorescent14 properties, are very different from those of the conventional QDs. The temperature-dependent15 and time-resolved measurements16 show that the origin of PL can be generally classified into two main categories: (a) core related and (b) surface state related emissions.17 In particular, recent experiments reveal CNDs to exhibit strong electron–electron scattering and weak electron–phonon interactions due to large amounts of mobile π-electrons,15 which results in a significantly slower relaxation rate of hot carriers.18 These properties suggest that CNDs can be excellent candidates for hot carrier solar cells.
The all-carbon material device is an emerging field of electronics and photovoltaics, such as fiber supercapacitors19 and solar cells.2 These products are light, bendable, inert under ambient conditions and can be used to form wearable clothes. The first all-carbon solar cells using carbon nanotubes as photo-sensitizers were demonstrated by Ramuz and his co-workers.2 However, so far the power conversion efficiency is only 0.46%, which is significantly lower than those of dye-sensitized solar cells20 (12.3%) and crystal silicon based solar cells (25%),21 respectively. The absorption at near-infrared wavelength and the roughness of stacking layers are responsible for the low efficiency. Fortunately, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and CNDs exhibit a tunable band gap and broader absorbance in the UV-visible range.22,23 Controlling the layers of graphene can realize the transition from GQDs (below tens of layers) to CNDs.15 Therefore, they can absorb more solar light and can potentially become the candidates to replace nanotubes as active layers in solar cells. Recently, Yan et al. demonstrated that GQDs could be used as photo-sensitizers in solar cells by solution processing with a large extinction coefficient and a wide light absorption spectrum.24 Williams et al. demonstrated hot electron harvesting from GQDs to TiO2 with a time constant < 15 fs at room temperature.25 Wang et al. observed electron/energy transfer in the CND–TiO2 nanoparticles and showed that the system is potentially very useful for opto-electronic conversion applications.26 However, to date there is no comprehensive photodynamic study available in the systems of CNDs–graphene oxide (GO), –carbon nanotube (CNT) and –TiO2 nanoparticles.
Electron transfer from the nanoparticle to an acceptor is of crucial importance in the operation of nanoparticle-based photovoltaics. In this study, we explore the photoinduced electron transfer dynamics in the CND based nanocomposites. The graphene oxides (GOs) were chosen to act as carrier acceptors because they exhibit unique electrical and solution-processable properties.27 Reduced GO (rGO) has been widely used for transparent conductor applications as a possible replacement for indium tin oxide (ITO) in photovoltaic devices.28 Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and TiO2 nanoparticles were compared in this experiment. Fluorescence quenching has been used as a probe to distinguish the quenching mechanism in CND–GO, CND–MWNT and CND–TiO2 nanocomposites. We demonstrated that an efficient electron transfer exists between CNDs and GO without linker molecules.
Results

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of the CNDs, GO, MWNTs and TiO2 nanoparticles in aqueous solution. The absorption spectra of CNDs, GO and MWNTs exhibit two peaks around 250 nm and 300 nm, and extend to longer wavelengths without a noticeable structure. According to the previous studies, the peak at 250 nm is ascribed to the π–π* transition of aromatic CC bonds, while a shoulder at 300 nm corresponds to the n–π* transition of CO bonds.15,29 However, the TiO2 nanoparticles show strong absorption in the UV wavelength range of 200–400 nm.30 A strong green fluorescence of CNDs was observed with a peak at 500 nm when they were excited at 400 nm. These results are consistent with the previous study.15,29 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of mixtures of CNDs–GO, CNDs–MWNTs and CNDs–TiO2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2, respectively. The size of the CNDs was found to be ∼5.5 nm with a lattice spacing of 0.18 nm.31 It is noteworthy that CNDs were attached on the GO surface, while rare CNDs were found in the vicinity of MWNTs and TiO2 nanoparticles.

The PL intensity of CNDs monotonically decreases with an increase in the concentration of GO or MWNTs, as shown in Fig. 3a and c. The GO exhibits weak and broad PL in the visible region. The PL peak does not exhibit a shift when GO or MWNTs were added to the CND solution. Fig. S1‡ shows no variation of PL intensity while CNDs were mixed with TiO2 nanoparticles. A strong quenching effect was observed in CND–GO and CND–MWNT composites (see Fig. S2‡). It was observed that GO and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) possess a similar quenching efficiency to QDs32 and fluorescent dyes.33 However, the fluorescence intensity of CNDs was almost constant while the TiO2 nanoparticles were added to the CND solution. Basically, energy transfer is one of the possible mechanisms for the CND PL quenching. Here, it should be noted that the PL of GO in the red region did not change evidently on adding CNDs, as shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, the energy transfer can be ruled out, since, if GO accepts the energy its PL will be enhanced. We performed time-dependent anisotropy decay measurements to identify the interaction between CNDs and GO, MWNTs and TiO2 NPs. Such a measurement has been widely used to quantify protein association with other macromolecules, which changes the overall rate of rotation.34 Fig. S3‡ shows fluorescence anisotropy decay of CNDs dissolved in different solvents. Recovered correlation times (τ) are 0.35, 0.91 and 1.30 ns for CNDs in water, propylene glycol and glycerol, respectively. When a fluorophore is in a high viscosity solution, the rate of rotational diffusion is typically slower than that of emission (longer recovered correlation time). Therefore, changing the solvent viscosity could result in a change in fluorescence anisotropy.35,36 Furthermore, recovered correlation times are 0.81, 0.36 and 0.40 ns for the CND–GO, CND–MWNT and CND–TiO2 NP mixtures, indicating that only GO has relatively strong interactions with CNDs. These results are consistent with TEM measurements.

In order to obtain an insight into the mechanism of PL quenching, the Stern–Volmer (S–V) plots, the peak intensity as a function of the concentrations of GO and MWNTs, were plotted in Fig. 3b and d. It is evident that the plots show linear and upward exponential behavior of GO and MWNTs, respectively. Here, the quenching constant of CNDs–GO is 3.3 × 103 (μg mL−1)−1, which is smaller than that of CdTe QD–GO, 1.1 × 105 (μg mL−1)−1.32 In general, a linear S–V behaviour occurs as a result of either a dynamic (collisional) or static mechanism. The upward curvature of the Stern–Volmer plots can be attributed to either combined dynamic and static quenching or solely static quenching to a large extent. The latter was usually interpreted in terms of a “sphere of action” and described by the modified Stern–Volmer equation:34,37 F0/F = (1 + KD[Q])exp([Q]V)(1)where [Q] is the concentration of MWNTs; KD and V are dynamic and static quenching constants, respectively. In the sphere of action, the apparent static component is due to the quencher being temporally adjacent to the fluorophore at the moment of excitation. These spatially closed fluorophore–quencher pairs are immediately quenched and are referred to as dark complexes. It is noteworthy that the fluorophore and the quencher do not actually form a ground-state complex. As shown in Fig. S4,‡ there is no variation in the absorption spectra of CNDs–MWNTs, which confirms no ground state variation.
To determine the mechanism of quenching by GO and MWNTs, the nanosecond fluorescence lifetime of CNDs was measured by the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique (Table 1). Essentially, the lifetime represents the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs and is determined by their wavefunction overlapping. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the fluorescence evolution of pure CNDs can be nicely fitted by a biexponential function, which indicates two decay components. The fast one can be ascribed to the nonradiative recombination with a lifetime of 1.4 ns (45.5%). The slow component should correspond to the radiative recombination (∼7.1 ns, 54.5%). With increasing GO concentrations, the short lifetime decreases from 1.42 to 0.30 ns, and the proportion of the fast component increases evidently from 45.5% to 90.8%. This increased contribution is ascribed to the quenching by GO through electron transfer. The lifetime of the slow component shows a variance from 7.09 to 2.56 ns as the concentration increases from 0.0025 to 1 mg mL−1. These results reveal the strong interaction between CNDs and GO. In contrast, the PL decay times remain constant regardless of concentration changes in CND–MWNT and CND–TiO2 systems, as shown in Fig. 5b and S5.‡ This indicates that the contribution of dynamic quenching should be completely ruled out. Therefore, the dynamic quenching constant (KD) can be negligible and the quenching process becomes purely static; and thus the S–V behavior follows simply an exponential growth. The static quenching constant was determined as V = 12.3 (mg mL−1)−1. A similar static quenching was observed in P3HT and MWCNT,38 as well as rhodamine B and CNT pairs.39Fig. 6 shows the FLIM for CNDs deposited on GO, MWNTs and TiO2 nanoparticles on a glass cover-slip. It is evident that CND–GO results in a significantly shorter lifetime (a1 → a2). In comparison, CNDs do not lead to variation of lifetime in MWCNTs (b1 → b2) and TiO2 nanoparticles (c1 → c2), consistent with the TCSPC measurement.

Fluorescence dynamic measurements of CND–GO were also carried out by the ultrafast upconversion technique. The ultrafast fluorescence evolution is shown in Fig. 7a on a picosecond (ps) time scale at 500 nm, corresponding to the peak maximum of CNDs. A very fast rise was observed, which suggests that very fast transient equilibration among hot electrons is established via electron–electron scattering on the fs time scale. The evolution can be nicely fitted by a 3-exponential function. A sharp decay (τ1 = 0.14 ps, 34%) is observed with a very large amplitude followed by two relatively slow components (τ2 = 2.13 ps, 44% and τ3 = 36.5 ps, 22%). There are several possible processes responsible for the fast decay: electron–phonon scattering, carrier trapping and Auger recombination.40 Here, we performed intensity dependent measurements to elucidate the ps decay process (see Fig. S6‡). The Auger recombination could be ruled out since the time constants do not depend on the pump fluence and remain almost constant. Therefore, we proposed the ps decays in CNDs are due to trapping of charges in defect states (τ1) and the electron–phonon scattering (τ2 and τ3), respectively. These results are consistent with our recently study.16 With increasing GO concentrations to 0.5 mg mL−1, the time trace shows a significant decrease, as shown in Fig. 7a. It is evidently attributed to an additional relaxation channel from CNDs to GO. To extract the contribution from the additional channel, the intrinsic dynamics of CNDs can be removed by subtracting that of pure CNDs from the mixture of CNDs and GO (2.0 mg mL−1): ΔPL(t) = PLCNDs+GO(t) − PLCNDs(t). As shown in Fig. 7b, the PL evolution can be nicely fitted by a single exponential function with a time constant of 417 fs, corresponding to a very high rate k = 2.4 × 1012 s−1.

Discussion
Quenching mechanism of nearby fluorescent dyes,41 conjugated polymers42 and quantum dots32,43 by sp2 domains within GO was studied. Brus and co-workers demonstrated the excited state decay of photogenerated electrons in trioctylphosphine oxide functionalized CdSe/ZnS QDs on pristine graphene decay via Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET).44 On the other hand, the existence of photoinduced charge transfer from QDs to graphene was confirmed by measuring the electrical signal from bare CdSe/ZnS QD sensitized single-layer graphene field-effect transistors (FETs).45 In addition, Kamat et al. proved that GO sheets can capture and store electrons from semiconductor QDs.46 They also obtained electron and energy transfer rates in CdSe–GO composites with the same order of magnitude.47 Recently, hot electron transfer was observed in CdSe–Py QDs and graphene composites.48 Similar to porphyrin sensitized GO films studied by Wojcik and co-workers, the efficient electron transfer between photoexcited porphyrin and GO indicates their potential application as photoanodes in dye sensitized solar cells.49 In the current investigation, the time constant of ∼400 fs is ascribed to the CND quenching by GO through electron transfer. The relative band alignments of the CNDs (LUMO ∼ −3.38 eV)50,51 are higher than that of GO (−4.5 eV),45 which facilitates electron transfer from CNDs to GO. The kinetics of electron transfer has been extensively studied and it is usually on the order of 108 to 1012 s−1 in a conventional QD system,52 which is similar to our observation in the CND–GO system. It is interesting to note that the electron transfer rate is faster than that of the ZnO nanoparticle and GO system, 1.2 × 109 s−1.53 Identical ultrafast measurements were also performed in CND–MWNT and CND–TiO2 systems. It should be noted that the PL time traces were very similar upon addition of MWNTs and TiO2 nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. S7.‡ Unfortunately, fluorescence quenching in the CND–MWNT system was confirmed as static quenching and no charge transfer was observed in the CND–TiO2 nanoparticle system. Here, a carbonaceous layer with a long carbon chain (i.e. C–C, C–OH and COOH groups) is grafted onto the surface of TiO2, as proven by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (see Fig. S8‡). In this case, a barrier would be formed at the interface between the CNDs and TiO2 and electron transfer is thus hindered.26,54 In general, electron transfer also strongly depends on the molecule linker52,55 and the distance56 between the donor and the acceptor.
The ultrafast electron transfer in CND–GO nanocomposite indicates their great potential to be used as photoanodes in carbon based solar cells. Furthermore, weak electron–phonon interactions in CNDs imply a slower phonon induced cooling;15 this would greatly benefit hot electron extraction and third generation photovoltaics because the relaxation of hot electrons by phonon scattering has been confirmed as the major energy loss.57 Further research on fabricating photovoltaic devices using this CND–GO hybrid nanostructure is currently in progress.
In conclusion, we have investigated the carrier dynamics in CND–GO, CND–MWNT and CND–TiO2 nanocomposites using steady state and ultrafast spectroscopy. Efficient electron transfer was observed from CND to GO at a rate of 400 fs. Such an ultrafast electron transfer process suggests that GO can be an excellent candidate for a photoanode. In particular, CND–GO can be contact materials for all-carbon solar cells because CNDs are anticipated to offer potential applications in hot carrier solar cells due to their weak phonon scattering and slow cooling. In comparison, no electron transfer was observed in CND–MWCNT and CND–TiO2 nanocomposites.
Methods
Synthesis of CNDs
The CNDs used in this study were synthesized by P2O5-based room temperature dehydration of acetic acid.15,29 Briefly speaking, a mixture solution of 1 mL glacial acetic acid and 80 μL H2O was quickly added to 2.5 g of P2O5 without additional heating. The carbon dots were collected by dispersing into 5 mL DI water for further optical measurements. The film samples used for cryogenic experiments were fabricated by drop casting on a glass substrate that was carefully ultrasonically cleaned and hydrophilically treated. Single layer graphene oxides (purity >80%, flake size 0.5–5 μm) were obtained from Nanocs. –COOH modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (diameter ∼1.5 nm, length 1–5 um) was purchased from Golden innovation business. TiO2 nanoparticles (diameter ∼20 nm, anatase) were purchased from CBT. All the composites were fabricated by simply mixing the CNDs with three carrier acceptors (i.e. GO, MWNTs and TiO2 nanoparticles) in solution, and allowed to stand for 30 min for further optical measurements.
Spectroscopic measurements
Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using JASCO UV/Visible (V-670) and fluorescent (FP-6300) spectrophotometers, respectively. The microsecond (μs) PL lifetimes were measured by the TCSPC technique (PicoHarp 300, Picoquant). The excitation source is frequency-doubled from a Ti:Sapphire oscillator laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) by a 1 mm BBO crystal at 400 nm with repetition rate of at 80 MHz, coupled with an ADP. The IVV and IVH were measured for time-dependent anisotropy decay calculation (IVV and IVH are the fluorescence intensities in the parallel and perpendicular polarizer orientation relative to the detector). The anisotropy (r) was calculated using r = IVV − IVH/IVV + 2IVH. The fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) was performed by the TCSPC technique using a Microtime-200 (Picoquant). The excitation source is a 467 nm laser with a tunable repetition rate. The femtosecond (fs) time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments were performed using an up-conversion fluorimeter (Fluomax, IB Photonics); the details are described in a previous publication.16 The excitation source is a 400 nm pulsed laser with 100 fs duration and an 80 MHz repetition rate. All of the measurements were performed at room temperature.
