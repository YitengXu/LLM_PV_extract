    , Accepted 18th December 2016First published on 20th December 2016AbstractSeparation of magic size clusters (MSCs) from monodisperse quantum dots (QDs) has generally been a difficult task while employing the commonly used synthesis procedure, where for preparation of PbSe QDs, Se-TOP (TOP = trioctylphosphine) is injected into Pb-oleate in 1-octadecene medium. In this study, we report for the first time a simple method to prepare MSCs, QDs and particles close to the bulk of PbSe using oleylamine (OAM) as the reducing agent, where the individual entities are efficiently separated. The chemical yield is found to be 95%. Studies on optical properties revealed the absorption and emission peaks of MSCs at fixed positions of 600 and 780 nm, respectively, while QDs exhibit significant shift to longer wavelengths for both the cases, depending on the particle size. Shift of the emission peak position for QDs is observed to be larger for initial stages of the waiting time as compared to those for longer waiting times. This can be attributed to two factors: faster growth in particle size is favoured kinetically in the initial stages, while thermodynamic stability occurs in the later stages, and reduction in surface to core contribution with increase of waiting time. QDs were found to emit at only one particular wavelength while they absorbed at two or more wavelengths. The quantum yields (QYs) of particles of sizes 4.1 and 5.1 nm are found to be 80 and 30%, respectively. The lifetime values are found to be 1.0–1.3 μs for QDs having an emission peak in the range of 1300–1500 nm. The hybrid device of PbSe (5 nm size) and MEHPPV (2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) shows increased conductivity both in the dark and in light, due to absorption in the region of NIR photons in the former and additionally in the visible region in the latter.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals, especially quantum dots (QDs), are important materials that find potential use in many applications such as solar cells, luminescent probes in biology, lasers, etc.1 Many approaches have been employed world-wide in synthesizing semiconductor nanocrystals like PbSe, CdSe, etc.2–6 Nanocrystals (NCs) are generally formed from supersaturation of monomers where the size and shape of the particles are controlled by the nucleation and the growth mechanism, which in turn depend on the method employed. However, the narrow size distribution, high chemical yield (CY) and high quantum yield (QY) are the important parameters that decide the efficiency of the approach for synthesis. Preparation of NCs in aqueous medium suffers from the limitation posed by agglomeration of particles, and to prevent this, surfactants or reverse micelles are generally used. It has been observed that in spite of such procedures, agglomeration begins within a few days. An alternative method to prevent agglomeration has been suggested by earlier studies where NCs are prepared in hydrophobic hydrocarbon medium.2–6 The hot rapid injection of precursors into high boiling point hydrocarbon solvent is a commonly employed method in which the temperature, chemical environment and heating time can be varied to obtain highly stable monodisperse NCs.
Among the various QDs, PbSe QDs have an interesting characteristic where the emission peak can be tuned from 4133 nm (0.3 eV) to 885 nm (1.4 eV) due to very strong confinement resulting from its large exciton Bohr's radius (46 nm) and a bulk band gap of 0.26 eV.7 As reported in earlier studies, for the synthesis of PbSe NCs, selenium-trioctylphosphine (Se-TOP) is injected into a solution of lead-oleate (Pb-OA) in 1-octadecene (ODE) at 120–150 °C.2,5,6 The emission spectrum of the resultant NCs typically shows two peaks: one peak at 800 nm and another at even longer wavelengths,8 corresponding to that of magic size clusters (MSCs) and quantum dots (QDs) of PbSe, respectively. It should be mentioned that MSCs are basically clusters of monomers of PbSe ((PbSe)n where n < 40),9 whereas QDs have n = 200–3000.10 Some studies have also shown the formation of MSCs even at room temperature.8 It should be noted that in this method an appreciable amount of MSCs in comparison to QDs is retained irrespective of the injection temperature and the duration of heating (i.e. waiting time, Wt).8 As the chemical yield depends on the amount of magic size clusters (MSCs) present with respect to that of QDs, this technique tends to result in a lower chemical yield of QDs. Additionally, it should be mentioned that many studies report variation in the characteristics of MSCs.8,11 For example, absorption and emission peaks related to MSCs of PbSe prepared at room temperature are shown to be shifting to higher wavelengths for waiting times up to 10 h.8 On the other hand, CdSe MSCs are reported to exhibit no shift in their absorption peak positions with waiting times even up to 36 h.11 Such uncertainties in the optical characteristics of these MSCs necessitate further studies, enabling better understanding of the same.
As mentioned before, even though the chemical yield of QDs is an important factor to be focused upon during the synthesis of the same, there are only a limited reports addressing this issue7,12–14 where attempts have been made to reduce the number of magic size clusters. Koh et al. have used Se-TDP (TDP = tris(diethylamino)-phosphine) instead of Se-TOP for the synthesis of PbSe nanorods (NRs) maintaining the injection temperature at 170 °C and have reported a high chemical yield.12 Their study has also shown the formation of QDs below 150 °C. In another study, Koh et al. have also shown that the ratio of QDs to NRs depends on the ratio of the amount of Pb to Se precursors at the same injection temperature and waiting time.13 Their study further indicates that even a mixture of Se-TOP and Se-TDP can yield PbSe QDs when the injection temperature is below 150 °C with a good chemical yield. Alternatively, in other reports, reducing agents such as diphenylphosphine and 1,2-hexadecanediol are used in addition to trioctylphosphine.7,13 This induces the intermediate formation of Pb0 (neutral charge) during the reaction of Se-TOP and Pb-oleate. But in these studies, even though the magic size clusters are eliminated, the chemical yield is not very high.
Some studies have reported use of metal nanoparticles, like Ag, Au and Co nanoparticles, as seeds for growth of PbSe nanocrystals of different shapes.3 Interestingly, some other studies have reported synthesis of these metal nanoparticles using oleylamine (OAM) as the reducing and capping agent.15,16 Taking this cue, in the present study, we have explored a new approach to synthesize PbSe QDs using oleylamine as the reducing and capping agent. By varying the injection temperature and the waiting time, we have successfully demonstrated the removal of magic size clusters and hence increase in chemical and quantum yields (QY) of QDs to as high as 95 and 80%, respectively. We have also shown the potential use of PbSe QDs (5 nm) prepared using this new approach in the solar cell applications.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 XRD study
The XRD patterns of PbSe QDs prepared using OAM at 140 °C with waiting times (Wt) of 2, 5 and 30 min shown in Fig. S1 (see the ESI†) indicate the cubic phase of PbSe with the lattice parameter a = 6.137 Å. The slight variation in the lattice parameter as compared to that of the reported value in the literature (6.124 Å)17 is due to the uncertainty in determining the exact peak position of the broad peak caused by the nanocrystallinity of QDs. From the XRD patterns, the crystallite sizes of PbSe QDs prepared at 140 °C with waiting times of 2, 5 and 30 minutes are found to be 3.2, 5.7 and 6.5 nm, respectively.
2.2 TEM study
TEM images (Fig. 1(a–e)) show a rough spherical shape of the PbSe QDs prepared using OAM at 140 °C with Wt = 0.5, 2, 5, 10 and 30 min. The particle sizes for Wt = 2, 5, 10 and 30 min are found to be 4.1, 5.1, 5.4 and 6.3 nm, respectively, whereas that for Wt = 0.5 min is too small (< 2 nm) and hence could not be observed due to the limitation posed by the resolution of the instrument used in this study. The particle size here is expressed in terms of an average of 100 numbers, and the particles are found to be monodisperse. Fig. S2–S6 (see the ESI†) show the TEM images of QDs at lower magnification.

2.3 Optical study

2.3.1 Optical study of PbSe QDs prepared without OAM. 

Fig. 2(a) shows the UV-Visible-NIR spectra of PbSe particles prepared without OAM at injection temperatures of 120 (for Wt: 5 min) and 140 °C (for Wt: 5 min). For the samples prepared at 120 °C, peaks are observed at 638, 1018 and 1277 nm, while for those prepared at 140 °C, the peaks are at 638, 1125 and 1440 nm.

Fig. 2(b) shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PbSe samples prepared without OAM at injection temperatures of 120 (Wt: 5 min) and 140 °C (Wt: 5 min) when excited at 633 nm. The emission peaks are observed at 800 and 1300 nm for an injection temperature of 120 °C, and at 802 and 1490 nm for the samples prepared at 140 °C. In both cases, the intensity of the peak at ∼800 nm is significant, but less than that of the second peak, i.e. at 1300 or 1490 nm.


2.3.2 Optical study of PbSe QDs prepared with OAM. 
The UV-Visible-NIR spectra of the samples prepared using OAM at room temperature (Tinj = 22 °C) for different waiting times (5 and 1080 min) shown in Fig. 3(a) indicate clearly that the peak observed at 600 nm for a waiting time of 5 min does not shift in position when the waiting time is increased to 1080 min (Table S1, see the ESI†). This peak position is in agreement with some studies correlating it with magic size clusters (MSCs < 2 nm).8,18 It is to be mentioned that there are reports showing the shift in absorption peaks to 625, 690, 750, 820 and 880 nm for the PbSe samples prepared at an injection temperature of 30 °C, but with increasing waiting time (after injection of Se-TOP into Pb-OA) at 10 minute intervals.8 The corresponding particle sizes were also reported to change to 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 nm8 where these particles were identified as MSCs. However, in our study, the peak at ∼600 nm does not shift, indicating that the MSCs prepared via the new approach are highly stable.
 Fig. 3  The UV-Visible-NIR spectra of PbSe samples prepared using OAM at (a) room temperature (22 °C), (b) 80 °C and (c) 100 °C with different waiting times (Wt, minutes). (d) PbSe QDs prepared at 180 °C with Wt = 15 minutes show the absorption bands at 675, 1110, 1452, 1715, 2118 and 2397 nm. They correspond to the discrete levels due to quantum confinement. Peaks are related to the formation of QDs, whereas shoulders are related to the formation of magic size clusters. Inset of (a), (b) or (c) shows the expansion spectra to see behavior of absorption peaks or shoulders. 

Fig. 3(b) shows the UV-Visible-NIR spectra of the samples prepared using OAM at 80 °C for different waiting times (Wt = 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 min) where absorption peak positions for both Wt = 15 and 30 min are almost the same, i.e., close to 600 nm (Table S1, see the ESI†). But upon increasing Wt further, the peak shifts to a longer wavelength due to increase in the particle size, i.e., to 941, 995, 1180 and 1270 nm corresponding to Wt = 45, 60, 120 and 180 min. respectively (Table S1, see the ESI†). A linear relationship between the particle size (D) and the position (λp) of the absorption peak having the lowest energy is generally represented by the empirical formula:10 D = (λp − 143.75)/281.25(1)
Based on eqn (1), the particle sizes (Dexp) are estimated to be 1.62, 2.83, 3.03, 3.68 and 4.01 nm corresponding to the absorption peaks at 600, 941, 995, 1180 and 1270 nm, respectively.

Fig. 3(c) shows the UV-Visible-NIR spectra of the samples prepared using OAM at 100 °C for different waiting times (Wt = 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min). Peak positions and their estimated particle sizes are given in Table S1 (see the ESI†). The peaks are observed at 600, 600, 600, 1046, 1138, 1252, and 1350 nm for Wt = 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, respectively. It can be seen that as the injection temperature (Tinj) increases from 80 to 100 °C, the peak shifts to a longer wavelength in spite of the same waiting time. For example, in the case of Tinj = 80 °C, the peak is observed at 600 nm at Wt = 15 min, while it disappears at this Wt as Tinj is increased to 100 °C and a peak at a longer wavelength (1138 nm) is observed. This shows that the injection temperature plays a crucial role in deciding the QD size.
In order to verify the effect of injection temperature on the absorption peak at different waiting times, absorption spectra are measured for the samples prepared at Tinj = 120, 140, 160 and 180 °C (Table S1, and Fig. S7–S10, see the ESI†). For Tinj = 120 and 140 °C, the peak is still observed at 600 nm for Wt = 0.5 min which then shifts to a longer wavelength for Wt = 2 min or longer. But when Tinj is increased to the range of 160–180 °C, the absorption peak disappears at a position of 600 nm even for Wt = 0.5 min, and shifts to a longer wavelength (λ > 1200 nm). This behaviour can be attributed to the particle size effect, where, upon increasing Tinj or Wt, the particle size is expected to increase.
In summary, it can be suggested that the formation of magic size clusters occurs at lower Tinj or shorter Wt followed by quantum dot formation at either higher Tinj or longer Wt or increase in both. Several absorption bands seen in Fig. 3(d) for Tinj = 180 °C and Wt = 15 minutes indicate the various discrete energy levels above the minimum energy gap confirming the formation of QDs. Considering the limitations posed by the instrument and the overtones of the hydrocarbons and water, absorption bands could be measured only up to about 2500 nm. The particle size calculated using eqn (1) from the absorption peak position measured at 2394 nm, for the NCs prepared at Tinj = 180 °C and Wt = 60 min, is about 8 nm. Since the band gap corresponding to this peak is about 0.517 eV, which is almost close to the bulk band gap of PbSe (0.26 eV),7 measurement up to 2500 nm can be considered to be sufficient for the present study.

Fig. 4(a) shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples prepared using OAM at room temperature (22 °C) for different waiting times (5, 15 and 1080 min) after excitation at 633 nm. The emission peak is observed at 790 nm for the samples, which indicates the stable formation of MSCs at room temperature (Table S1, see the ESI†). Fig. 4(b) shows the PL spectra of the samples prepared at 80 °C for different waiting times (Wt = 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 min) under the same excitation wavelength. The peak at 780 nm continues to be present up to Wt of 30 min, which then shifts to 1024, 1078, 1257 and 1360 nm for Wt = 45, 60, 120 and 180 min, respectively (Table S1, see the ESI†). This can be attributed to the particle size effect of QDs as also observed in the absorption spectra. Fig. 4(c) shows the PL spectra of the samples prepared at 100 °C where the emission peak is observed at 780 nm up to Wt of 5 min and is found to shift to 1127, 1215, 1363 and 1481 nm for Wt = 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, respectively (Table S1, see the ESI†). For injection temperatures at 120, 140, 160 and 180 °C, the PL spectra are shown in Fig. S11–S14 (see the ESI†) and the observed peak positions are given in Table S1 (see the ESI†). It can be seen that the peak position changes to a longer wavelength with increase in injection temperature, with the waiting time remaining the same. It is to be noted here that unlike the absorption spectrum which shows various bands for QDs, only one peak is observed in the emission spectrum, which corresponds to the lowest energy peak in the absorption spectrum. This could be due to the many non-radiative processes occurring at the higher excited states after excitation.

(d) Luminescence decay of the PbSe sample having an emission peak at 1300 nm. Data are fitted with the monoexponential equation. The excitation wavelength is fixed at 600 nm. 
The peak positions in the absorption and emission spectra for the samples prepared at 22, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 180 °C as a function of waiting times are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. Fig. 5(c) and (d) show the variations of the peak positions of absorption and emission with waiting times at two injection temperatures 80 and 120 °C, respectively. No shift in peak position in both the absorption and emission spectra is noticed for MSCs while they both shift to a longer wavelength as QD formation begins. These peaks exhibit a large shift during the initial stages of waiting times, which then decreases for longer waiting times. This can be attributed to two factors: (1) change in particle size kinetically favored in the initial stages tending to thermodynamic stability in the later stages and (2) reduction of surface to core contribution with increase of waiting time. It can also be seen that the extent of peak shift in the emission spectra is more than that in the absorption spectra during the initial waiting time. This can be attributed to the higher sensitivity exhibited by the PL effect than the absorption phenomenon during the transition period when MSCs lead to QD formation.

The emission occurring at 780 nm for PbSe samples prepared without OAM is not observed for that with OAM. This observation is in agreement with other studies also reporting the absence of 780 nm peak for PbSe samples prepared in the presence of reducing agents such as diphenylphosphine or TDP.7,12–14 This indicates that in the present study, OAM acts as the reducing agent converting Pb2+ to Pb0 at 170 °C. Proposed mechanisms for such metal ion reduction to metal (zero charge) by OAM are provided in ref. 19.
Luminescence decay characteristics were also studied under an excitation wavelength of 600 nm. Typical decay for samples having an emission peak at 1300 is shown in Fig. 4(d) where it follows monoexponential decay. The lifetime values for samples having emission peaks at 1300 and 1535 nm were estimated to be 1.3 and 1.0 μs, respectively, which are comparable to the reported values.20 The quantum yields (QYs) of the PbSe QDs prepared at 140 °C with Wt = 2 and 5 min are found to be 80 and 30%, respectively, similar to the reported values (10–90%).5,20

2.4 Photoconductivity study
The J–V characteristics of ITO/MEHPPV/Al and ITO/MEHPPV:PbSe QD/Al devices in the dark and under illumination are measured. The open circuit voltage (Voc) for the device with plain MEHPPV was about 0.8 V, while short circuit current (Jsc) was about 3.7 nA cm−2, under white light illumination with power ∼2.5 mW cm−2. For the device using the MEHPPV:PbSe QD composite, the open circuit voltage decreased to ∼0.3 V but the short circuit current increased to 50 nA cm−2 for the same illumination intensity. The increase in short circuit current could be attributed to increased light absorption in the visible and NIR regions by PbSe QDs. The energy diagram of the ITO/MEHPPV:PbSe QD/Al device (composite or hybrid) is shown in Fig. 6(c) and the possible mechanism for the generation of photoconductivity from such hybrid devices, forming a p–n junction between MEH-PPV and PbSe, is explained as follows. The photogenerated exciton dissociates into an electron and a hole at the interface of the hybrid. The electrons in the conduction band are transferred to the Al electrode, while the holes in the valence band are transferred to ITO, thereby allowing photoconductivity. Similar observations have been reported earlier.21 It is to be noted that even under dark conditions, there is strong photoconductivity as compared to that with only MEH-PPV, indicating the absorption of NIR photons possibly by PbSe QDs (Fig. 6(d)). Under the dark conditions, there are NIR photons in the range 900 to 2500 nm, which are not in the visible region. QDs with 2 or more absorption bands below 1600 nm (discrete energy levels) can absorb these photons and thus photocurrent can be produced even in the dark. The photoconductivity further increases under illumination due to increased absorption by PbSe QDs, which have many discrete absorption bands in the visible region, as well as by MEH-PPV. But it can also be seen that in the absence of PbSe, the increase in conductivity solely by MEH-PPV is negligible as compared to that due to the composite. This clearly shows that PbSe QDs prepared by using olelylamine as the reducing agent can be effectively used for energy harvesting from the visible to the NIR range in optoelectronic applications.

2.5 Proposed mechanism for the formation of monomers, clusters and QDs
Based on the above observations of absorption and emission characteristics of PbSe, the mechanism behind the formation of clusters and QDs is proposed in Fig. 7. Organic products obtained after reaction are omitted here in order to simplify the reaction path for the formation of monomers, clusters and QDs of PbSe. In the absence of OAM (Fig. 7(A)), Pb-oleate interacts with a Se-TOP complex to form monomers at the initial stages irrespective of the injection temperature being either at 22 °C or at the elevated values. Upon attaining supersaturation, the formation of clusters of monomers commences due to agglomeration of monomers, with weak interactions occurring among them. Nucleation of QDs begins when the radius of the particle is more than the critical value.7 With increase in waiting time/ageing at elevated temperatures, even though the size of QDs increases, magic size clusters are not sacrificed.
 Fig. 7  Proposed mechanism for the formation of monomers, clusters and QDs during reaction processes. Here, reaction path ‘A’ suggests the formation of a mixture of PbSe magic size clusters and QDs. Reaction path ‘B’ suggests the formation of Pb0 at elevated temperature (say, 170 °C) followed by formation of PbSe QDs. 
In the presence of OAM (Fig. 7(B)), nanoclusters of Pb0 are formed after heating at 170 °C. At a particular injection temperature, Pb0 and the Se-TOP complex can form PbSe molecules. But upon injecting at room temperature, no QDs are formed because sufficient activation energy required for the formation of QDs is not provided. Instead, monomers/MSCs are formed. At elevated temperatures (for example, Tinj = 80 °C), there is conversion of monomers to MSCs to QDs with increase of waiting time. This situation is similar to Oswald ripening in which the QDs grow at the expense of the magic size clusters. The step by step conversion of monomers to clusters and then to QDs is schematically shown in Fig. 1(f). It is to be noted that MSCs will convert to QDs if sufficient time at a particular injection temperature (i.e. Tinj ≥ 80 °C) is provided. Otherwise, MSCs will remain irrespective of availability of Pb0 in the reaction medium.
3. Conclusions
The present study discusses the synthesis of separate phases of MSCs, QDs and particles close to the bulk of PbSe, and the efficient use of oleylamine to control the amount of MSCs with respect to QDs has been successfully demonstrated. The chemical yield is found to be exceptionally high as compared to the reported values for PbSe QDs prepared using diphenylphosphine as the reducing agent. The absorption and the emission spectra revealed the peak position of MSCs at 600 and 780 nm, respectively, which were found to remain unchanged irrespective of the injection temperature and the waiting time/ageing (or duration of heating), which is in disagreement with other studies. On the other hand, QDs consistently showed change in peak positions in both absorption and emission spectra to longer wavelengths with increase of particle size. The extent of peak shift is more for initial stages of waiting time as compared to that for the later stages. Emission spectra exhibited a larger shift as compared to that in the absorption spectra during the transition period of MSCs to QDs. PbSe QDs prepared using oleylamine with absorption bands spread in the visible to NIR region have shown potential use for energy harvesting in solar cell devices.
4. Methods
4.1 Chemicals
Selenium (Se, 99.5%), lead oxide (PbO, 99.9%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), tetrachloroethylene (TCE, 99%), and absolute ethanol (100%) from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals and trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%) and oleylamine (OAM, 90%) from Acros Organic Chemicals were purchased and used without further purification.
4.2 Preparation
PbSe QDs were synthesized with and without OAM. For preparation with OAM, steps are given below:

Step 1: preparation of Se-TOP. 
About 0.79 g of Se was dissolved in 25 ml of TOP at 100 °C for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere (glove box). During heating, magnetic stirring was carried out simultaneously for 10 h. This is referred to as Se-TOP.


Step 2: preparation of PBO-OA-OAM-ODE. 
About 0.44 g of PbO was mixed with 2 ml of OA, 2 ml of OAM and 30 ml of ODE in a 100 ml round bottom (RB) flask. The heating temperature was increased to 50, 80, 100, 120, and 140 °C with 10 min waiting time at each temperature and to 170 °C for 30 min under vacuum followed by exposure to an Ar atmosphere. The product of this reaction step is referred to as PBO-OA-OAM-ODE. PbO was found to be completely dissolved at 120 °C (Fig. S15, see the ESI†).


Step 3: injection of Se-TOP into PBO-OA-OAM-ODE. 
PBO-OA-OAM-ODE was brought to the particular injection temperature (Tinj) – room temperature, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 °C – under an Ar atmosphere. Equilibrium time was kept for 1 h at each injection temperature. 5 ml of Se-TOP was injected fast (within 1 second) at each injection temperature and the lapse/delay after injection was counted as waiting time Wt. Within 0.5 min, the solution appeared brownish, indicating the fast reaction kinetics. With either increase of injection temperature or waiting time, the brownish color changed to a dark color. At each waiting time, about 4–5 ml of aliquot liquid from the reaction mixture was transferred to 10 ml of absolute ethanol using a syringe (plastic type in case of injecting temperature ≤100 °C, otherwise glass type). The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm (a centrifugal force of 2700 × g) and the precipitate (ppt) was collected after washing twice with ethanol. The ppt was dispersed in 5 ml of tetrachloroethylene (TCE). The chemical yield was very high (95% (Table 1)). The reported chemical yield was 16% using diphenylphosphine as a reducing agent and 3% without it.14 The chemical yield (CY) is dependent on the waiting times. With increase of waiting time, monomers/clusters of PbSe will be converted to a bigger size. In order to compare CYs, the positions of the absorption bands should be close to each other (Table 1). The chemical yield reported here included the amount of monolayered coating of OA. The photos of the samples prepared at 80 °C for different waiting/delay times are shown in Fig. S16 (see the ESI†).

For the preparation of PbSe QDs without OAM, the preparation steps were the same as the above (excluding the addition of 2 ml of OAM). Here the chemical yield (CY) was very less (10%).

4.3 Characterization
It is to be noted that all XRD, TEM and photoconductivity data shown in this work were obtained from samples prepared using OAM. For comparison, XRD and TEM data of samples prepared without OAM are shown in Fig. S17 and Section SA (see the ESI†).
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded using a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer. CrKα (2.2936 Å) with a vanadium filter was used. The operating voltage and the current were 30 kV and 15 mA respectively. A few drops of the samples were placed over a zero background sample holder. The scan rate was maintained at 1° min−1.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the samples were recorded using a JEOL JEM-1400 tungsten filament up to 80 kV. For this purpose, one drop of the diluted samples in hexane was placed over a carbon coated Cu grid.
The UV-visible-NIR spectra of samples in solvent tetrachloroethylene (TCE) were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples in tetrachloroethylene (TCE) were recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 920. The detector was a liquid N2 cooled Hamamatsu 25509 PMT. The excitation source was a HeNe laser at 633 nm. Cut-off filters (645 and 695 nm) were used. The spectra were recorded in the range of 700–1650 nm. The quantum yield (QY) measurement was performed on the integrated sphere using the absolute method. A Xe-lamp (450 W) was used as the excitation source. The standardization of the instrument was verified before and after the experiments using IR125 which results in QY = 12% against the reported value of 13%.
The luminescence decay measurements of the samples were carried out using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 920 equipped with a Nd-YAG laser excitation source with pumped optical parameters (OPO), a pulse width of 10 ns and a repetition frequency of 10 Hz. The detector was a thermoelectrically cooled NIR-PMT module H10330A (Hamamatsu). The solvent used was tetrachloroethylene (TCE).
For comparison, absorption and emission data of samples prepared with and without OAM are provided in Section SA (see the ESI†).
4.4 Hybrid solar cell using a blend of MEHPPV and PbSe quantum dots (QDs)
MEHPPV (poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene)) (Aldrich, molecular weight 40000–70000 g mol−1) was dissolved in chloroform (7 mg ml−1). The as-synthesized PbSe QDs (5 nm) was mixed with MEHPPV solution in a ratio 1:4 vol% by simple physical mixing. The resultant composite solution was mixed thoroughly under ultrasonication for about 30 minutes. A patterned ITO/glass substrate with a sheet resistance of ∼15 Ω □−1 was ultrasonically cleaned with DI water, trichloroethylene, acetone and isopropyl alcohol before use. The MEHPPV:PbSe QD mixture was deposited on the patterned ITO by a simple drop casting method. The photovoltaic device was fabricated by depositing about 100 nm aluminum above the active layer by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. The device area was about 0.06 cm2. For control devices, plain MEHPPV was also deposited on patterned ITO substrates using the drop casting method, with aluminium again acting as the top contact electrode. In these devices, MEHPPV acts as a p-type semiconductor, while PbSe QDs acts as an n-type semiconductor.
Current voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 6487 picoammeter/voltage source in air at room temperature. Measurements were carried out in the dark and under illumination using a torch light (white light) with a power ∼2.5 mW cm−2. The intensity of the source light was measured using a calibrated single crystalline silicon solar cell. The schematic of the hybrid solar cell is shown in Fig. 6(a and b). The energy levels of the conduction and valence bands are taken from ref. 21 for PbSe QDs with a particle size of 5 nm. Also, the spectrum of torch light used is shown in Fig. 6(e). From this, CIE colour coordinates are calculated and the values are found to be x = 0.37 and y = 0.33, which falls in the white light region.
