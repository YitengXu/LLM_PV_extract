    , Accepted 4th October 2017First published on 4th October 2017AbstractWe present a systematic comparative density functional theory–density functional tight binding study of multiple derivatives of C60 and C70 with different addends, in molecular as well as solid state. In particular, effects due to fullerene size, type and number of addends, and of crystallinity on band structure, charge transport, and optical properties are investigated. These are important, in particular, for rational selection of fullerene derivatives as acceptor and electron transport layers in organic as well as planar inverted perovskite solar cells. We find that by the choice of type and number of addends, one can modulate the LUMO within 0.4 eV. Changes in the HOMO can reach 0.7 eV. Substituting C70 for C60 results in destabilization of the HOMO by about 0.1 eV for indene and quinodimethane addends and by a less significant amount for PCBM addends. The effect of C70–C60 substitution on the LUMO is of similar magnitude. A more significant change in HOMO–LUMO energy is seen for the aryl addends. On the other hand, all C70 based molecules have strong visible absorption. For most addends, the crystal packing leads to a stabilization of both the LUMO and HOMO by about ∼0.2 and ∼0.1 eV, respectively, vs. single molecules. When using bis-addends, it is also possible to enhance the visible absorption. Electron and hole transport rates are computed to vary vastly depending on the addends chosen; specifically, we compute that indene and quimodimethane addends can enhance charge transport rates while the aryl addend is predicted to result in substantially smaller mobilities of electrons and holes, vs. PC60BM. Furthermore, the –CH2 and bisaddend addition can significantly enhance the charge transfer rates for the PCBM addend.
Introduction
Advanced types of solar cells, including all-organic solar cells and perovskite-based solar cells, hold the promise of efficient and economic solar-to-electrical energy conversion and are likely to take a significant part in the future solar energy mix. Organic solar cells are a potentially cost-effective, scalable, and lightweight alternative to solid semiconductor-based solar cells.1–3 Organic (usually of BHJ, bulk heterojunction type) solar cells (OSCs) utilize polymeric or molecular organic chromophores and usually fullerene-based acceptors.4–7 Energy conversion efficiencies (η) exceeding 10% have been realized8,9 with these solar cells. New materials are needed to improve the efficiency further, as the efficiency is still lower than that of silicon cells or dye-sensitized cells.10 In these types of OSCs, optimal energy level matching and charge separation characteristics are the key requirements for the donor–acceptor pair. The acceptor material plays a critical role of inducing charge separation and efficient conduction of electrons from the donor–acceptor interface to the negative electrode.11 The electron transfer rate is strongly dependent on the difference ΔG between the energy of the excited state of the donor and the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the acceptor and would typically increase with lower acceptor LUMO, as follows from the Marcus equation,12 (1)where ωij is the transfer rate between electronic states i and j, λ is the reorganization energy, J is the transfer integral, ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. ΔG is approximated here with electronic energies, as is commonly done.13
On the other hand, the open circuit voltage (VOC) decreases with the decrease of the acceptor LUMO level. Therefore, it is important to control the energy level of the acceptor material to simultaneously achieve a high charge separation rate and high VOC. The acceptor LUMO level depends not only on the molecular structure of the acceptor molecule but also on crystal packing. The charge mobility in the acceptor also strongly depends on the crystal packing (via J) as well as on the molecular structure (via ΔG and λ). PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl C61/71-butyric acid methyl ester, hereafter referred to also as PC61BM), and other fullerene derivatives are the most widely used acceptor compounds due to their high electron affinity and effective charge transport properties.14 We will also use notation PC60/70BM to highlight the fullerene core used.
The perovskite solar cells, mostly based on methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) as the chromophore and donor, have achieved efficiencies exceeding 20% in the sensitized configuration (i.e. with TiO2 as an acceptor).15,16 The potential widespread use of the perovskite solar cells depends on advances in many directions including solvent engineering and interface engineering.17 In particular, planar inverted perovskite cells (the so-called OPV-type perovskite solar cells) are advantageous, as their manufacturing does not require high-temperature processes and they are suited for applications where flexibility is required.18,19 Cells made using solution-based hot-casting techniques have now achieved efficiencies of about 18% with the most commonly used fullerene-based acceptor PCBM.20 Huang's group demonstrated that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of planar heterojunction photovoltaic cells can be increased up to 19.4% by reducing the energy disorder in the fullerene layer.21 More efficient perovskite solar cells are expected in the near future as the PCE has already reached up to 22% after a few years of academic research, and planar perovskite cells could have efficiencies comparable to the sensitized configuration cells. This type of solar cell benefits from the use of an organic electron transport layer (ETL).
Different fullerene derivatives are also successfully used as acceptors/electron transport layers in planar perovskite solar cells. There are by now multiple reports that other fullerene derivatives can achieve higher performance than PCBM under the same conditions and in a way dependent on the specific perovskite.22,23 For example, a new fullerene derivative, bis-4-propylpentyl-[6,6]-methanofullerene (NCBA), using 4-nonanone as a building block has been synthesized.24 Wen et al. have demonstrated an indene-C60-bis adduct based fullerene/perovskite planar heterojunction hydride solar cell.25 Ela and coworkers have recently demonstrated a new fullerene derivative (benzoic acid fullerene bis adducts, BAFB) based perovskite solar cell.26 Imahori and coworkers have used soluble C60-9-methylanthracene mono-adduct (C60(9MA)) as a thermal precursor to the C60 ESL, which resulted in 15.0% PCE in a planar perovskite solar cell.27 Liu et al. have investigated a fluoroalkyl-substituted fullerene/perovskite solar cell with a decent PCE of 15.4%.28 Also, a 19.5% PCE in a perovskite cell has been achieved by using a cross-linkable silane-functionalized molecule with the doped fullerene as an electron transport layer.29 In particular, more environmentally friendly (with less or no Pb content) perovskites using different organic cations or halides can profit from the use of different fullerene derivatives as the ETL, in particular, because their different CBM (conduction band minimum) can achieve an optimal balance between VOC and ω.30–37
The use of non-PCBM fullerene derivatives has also been shown to lead to higher efficiencies of BHJ cells, depending on the donor.24 Given the virtually inexhaustible number of possible donors, with different LUMO energies and reorganization energies, it is clear that one needs to be able to select rationally the most appropriate fullerene material. The use of different fullerene derivatives can also enhance visible light absorption of the acceptor which leads to additional photocurrent.38–41 Clearly, engineering an appropriate fullerene-based material for a given application (either a given donor of a BHJ cell or a given perovskite) is important to maximize the efficiency and fully utilize the advantages of a given donor material and chromophore.
Unlike other aspects of the BHJ and the OPV-type perovskite solar cells that have been widely investigated, the different fullerene-based acceptor compounds have not been. It is therefore clear that a systematic study of fullerene derivatives will be beneficial for the fullerene based solar cell technologies. Therefore, to enable rational design of optimal fullerene derivatives for applications in all-organic BHJ solar cells as well as in OPV-type/inverted perovskite cells, a clear understanding of the trends in the properties of various fullerene derivatives is needed. This calls for a comparative study of multiple derivatives that differ by core size (e.g. PC61BM vs. PC71BM) and the functional groups (i.e. replacing “P-BM” with aryl (Ar), indene (IND), quinodimethane (QM) etc.). As mentioned above, some progress on the experimental side has been achieved.42–45 However, to disambiguate from circumstantial effects due to impurities in the materials and experimental conditions and to rationalize experimental trends (in η, VOC, JSC, FF etc.) with different fullerene derivatives, a comparative ab initio computational study is required. A limited number of computational studies have been reported on different fullerene based acceptor materials; they are also dominated by studies of [6,6]-phenyl C61/71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and its derivatives.46–49 While separate studies computing the properties of specific other fullerene derivatives exist, these are often limited to isolated molecules and did not consider effects due to the crystal structure or even the effects of ΔG50 as was often done when modelling other organic materials as well.51–56 These are expected to have important effects on energy level matching and charge transport. In particular, electron and hole transport rates critically depend on mutual orientations of molecules in the crystal as well as on ΔG. Therefore, it is important to compare different fullerene materials to estimate the effect on fullerene acceptors due to the change in addends, size, and crystallinity. Such a comparison has to be done at the same level of theory and with the same computational parameters as practical ab initio approaches (i.e. DFT) are only semi-quantitative.
Therefore, in this manuscript, we present a comparative ab initio computational study of multiple fullerene derivatives (shown in Fig. 1) that considers the molecular structure, frontier orbital energy levels, redox potentials and bandgap, optical properties, reorganization energies and coupling elements that determine charge mobility. Charge transfer rates for different pathways in realistic crystal structures are computed. Trends in properties with the size of the fullerene and with organic addends are established. We compute single-molecule properties by the DFT method and the effects due to crystallinity by the Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) method. Therefore, we also present a comparison between DFT and DFTB.
 Fig. 1  Fullerene derivatives studied in this work. Only C60-based molecules are shown. The C70-based molecules studies here have the same addends. 
Methods
The DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian0957 for the optimization, estimation of the frontier orbital energies, and absorption spectra of individual molecules and for dimers (for charge transport calculations). The B3LYP functional58 with the 6-31+g(d,p) basis set was used for these calculations. The redox potentials were computed with the ωB97XD functional,59 as it was shown that a large fraction of exact exchange is needed to accurately compute them and ωB97XD was suggested to be accurate for such calculations.60–62 The partial density of states (PDOS) was extracted by the GaussSum63 program, from the output of the Gaussian calculations. The reorganization energies were also computed for all the molecules with the same level of theory. For comparison with DFTB calculations, the PBE functional64 was also used. All molecular calculations were done in a vacuum. The absorptivity ε in L mol−1 cm−1 was calculated from oscillator strengths f and excitation energies of transitions Eexc as with the HWHM (half width half maximum) broadening σ = 0.25 eV.57
The oxidation (reduction) potentials were computed as Eox(red) = E+(−) − E0, where E+, E−, and E0 are the energies of the cation, anion and neutral molecules.62 The change in ΔG, which is omitted in some studies52–56 needed for charge transfer rate calculation by the Marcus equation, was estimated from the difference in the redox potentials of the neutral and charged systems: ΔG = E+(−)ox(red) − E0ox(red), where, E+(−)ox(red) and E0ox(red) are the oxidation (reduction) potential of ionic and neutral molecules. We used the redox potentials for the calculation of ΔG because they are more reliable than HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbitals) and LUMO values; specifically, they do not suffer from the changes in reference energy between neutral and charged species by which HOMO and LUMO levels are affected.
We also investigated both the molecular and the crystalline structures of all the fullerene derivatives by the self-consistent charge density functional tight binding scheme (SCC-DFTB) using the DFTB+ code.65,66 We used the parameter set (Slater–Koster files) 3ob-3-167 and the DFTB368 approximation, which was shown to be accurate for predicting the interactions in organic molecules. For silicon derivative of fullerenes, the matsci-0-369 parameter set was utilized (as Si parameters are missing from 3ob-3-1). The relative SCC tolerance was set to 1 × 10−5 for both the molecular and crystalline structure optimization. Dispersion interactions were accounted for by using the UFF force field.70
The reorganization energy was calculated following the equation , where  is ion energy at the geometry of the neutral molecule, E+(−) is ion energy at its optimized geometry, E* is the energy of the neutral molecule at ion's geometry, and E is the energy of the neutral molecule at its optimized geometry. The reorganization energy computation by the Gaussian (B3LYP) and the DFTB code followed the same route.
We took the experimentally available crystal structures of PC60BM71 and C60CH2IND72 as the reference or initial guess and made the crystal structures for other molecules (both C60 and C70 derivatives) by placing optimized single molecules into a similar crystal structure as PCBM and CH2IND. Molecular dynamics (MD) was performed in DFTB+ to help identify stable structures and to confirm the stability of the crystals. This was possible due to low energy barriers for orientational motion; indeed, molecules were found to easily reorient themselves during MD. After attaining an equilibrium crystal structure, we optimize the structure and compare the final energy with its initial (before MD run) energy to identify the lowest energy structure. Therefore, all the calculations were performed with the lowest energy structures (all the crystal structure along with the lattice constants are reported in Section 8 of the ESI†). The Nose–Hoover thermostat73–75 and the Berendsen barostat76 are used with a coupling strength of 3000 cm−1 and a timescale of 100 femtoseconds, respectively. The time step for the integration of the equations of motion was 1 fs and the length of the run was at least 10 ps. The Brillouin zone was sampled with at least one k point per 30 Å−1. Thus, different values of k-points were assigned for different cell vectors.
Finally, the charge transfer rate was calculated using the Marcus equation (1). We computed the transfer integral by the DFT/DIPRO approach included in the VOTCA-CTP module.77,78 The dimers forming the donor–acceptor pair in the charge transfer (hopping) process were cut out from the optimized crystal geometry. As the crystals were computed with DFTB (parameterized to PBE DFT), the PBE functional was used to compute the orbitals of monomers and dimers, to minimize strain caused by using one method on a (slightly different) structure computed with another. These orbital energies and the expansion coefficients were used to estimate the transfer integral values obtained by the VOTCA-CTP code.
Absorption spectra were computed using TD-DFT79,80 (in Gaussian 09) considering 36 lowest singlet–singlet transitions.
Results
Molecules studied
We have investigated fullerene derivatives with both C60 and C70 cores. Different types of addends are studied, such as indene (IND), quinodimethane (QM), phenyl-butyric acid methyl ester (P-BM), and aryl (Ar). On top of that, the effect on the molecular properties of addition of an extra –CH2 group and bis-addends was also considered. It was shown72,81 that the dihydromethano group improves the performance of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. All the addends with a fullerene C60 core are represented in Fig. 1. The same addends with a C70 core are also considered. The first addend in Fig. 1 is indene (IND), synthesized by Li and co-workers.82 They reported both the mono and the bis addends and showed that the bis addend can significantly improve the PCE compared to PCBM as an acceptor in a polymer solar cell (PSC).82 Furthermore, they optimized the PSC system by the donor acceptor weight ratio, solvent annealing and pre-thermal annealing to improve the efficiency.45 Later, Wen et al. demonstrated an improved PCE with the indene-C60-bisaddend (ICBA) for perovskite-fullerene planar heterojunction hydride solar cells. Other indene derivatives have also been reported as efficient acceptor materials for the perovskite based solar cell.23,83 The second type of addend is quinodimethane (QM). Ding's group synthesized both QM and thieno-o-quinodimethane based fullerene derivatives, including those with bis addends, and achieved an increased solar cell efficiency compared to PC60BM with P3HT as a donor.84 They further showed an enhanced efficiency by introducing a “–CH2” group along with the QM addend.85 They also reported the efficiency of C70QM and C70-bis-OQM in a fullerene/P3HT solar cell.86 The next addend is the widely used fullerene derivative i.e. the phenyl-butyric acid methyl ester addend with both the C60 (PC60BM) and C70 (PC70BM) fullerenes. Many research groups have used PCBM as the electron transfer layer for organic and/or perovskite based solar cells.87–90 Several other applications are also reported in the literature for PCBM based systems.91–93 You et al. reported high efficiency for a fluorinated polymer blended with PC60BM in a solar cell.94 Cheyns et al. also reported an increased efficiency due to the use of PC60BM with crosslinked 1,6-diazidohexane (DAZH).95 Grätzel et al. demonstrated that along with the performance, the stability of the device can be further improved by using the bis-PCBM adduct.96 Also, the PC70BM was used as an efficient acceptor material. For example, Li et al. demonstrated triple-junction polymer–PC70BM fullerene solar cells that achieved PCEs up to 9.6%.97 Kim et al. showed that the PCEs can be improved by using the PC70BM–polymer composite.98 Liang and co-workers prepared a solar cell from the polymer–PC70BM blend that also exhibited a high solar energy conversion efficiency of 5.6%.99 Other fullerene derivatives with aryl and silicon substituted aryl addends were also reported. Nakamura et al. synthesized and developed the aryl-fullerene derivatives as an efficient alternative to PCBM.100–102 We used a single isomer of each of the molecules as shown in Fig. 1. We restricted this work to one isomer because (i) it would be impractical in this work to consider multiple isomers, as we analyse a couple dozen molecules with several methods, (ii) fullerene derivatives can be synthesized regioselectively,103 and the isomers we consider here are those reported in experimental literature cited above. Our results therefore provide useful information with which to compare effects of addends in different fullerene molecules. The effects of isomerization, however, will require further studies.
Electronic properties
The energies of the HOMO and LUMO as well as the gap for all the molecules are shown in Fig. 2. The HOMO and LUMO energies are also listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The computed redox potentials are given in Table S2 (ESI†). These results show that the choice of addends and fullerene size can significantly change the frontier orbital energies and the bandgap. For example, the C70CH2Ar2 molecule has a bandgap of only 2.09 eV – a contraction of the gap close to 20% is achieved vs. PC60BM and PC70BM, that is, the gap contraction is a combined effect of addend and fullerene choice. For a given fullerene core, the choice of addend(s) can change the HOMO, LUMO and gap on the order of 0.7, 0.4 and 0.6 eV, respectively, compared to bare C60 and C70 molecules, and substitution of C70 for C60 can change them by up to 0.1, 0.1 and 0.08 eV, respectively, except for aryl groups. The difference in HOMO–LUMO and band gap values due to the change in core size is more prominent with aryl groups.
 Fig. 2  The HOMO (lower edge of the bars), LUMO (upper edge) and band gap (length of the bars with values printed on the bars) energies for all the C60 and C70 derivatives; all the values are obtained from Gaussian-optimized geometries. The first two values are computed with the PBE functional and the rest are computed with the B3LYP functional with the same basis set (6-31+g(d,p)). 
In particular, the addition of –CH2 to a C60 mono-addend fullerene derivative can increase the HOMO and LUMO energy by about 0.17 eV and 0.1 eV, respectively, for IND and PC60BM. The effect is more significant in the case of QM and CH2Ar2 where both the HOMO and the LUMO energy can be increased by about 0.15–0.17 eV by the addition of –CH2. The bis addend (i.e. addition of a 2nd addend of the same type) increases the HOMO energy by 0.22–0.24 eV and LUMO energy by 0.13–0.15 eV for all the addends with the C60 core. For the C70 IND, QM and PCBM derivatives, the HOMO and LUMO energies are increased by 0.17–0.18 eV and 0.10–0.17 eV, respectively, due to the addition of the –CH2 group to the mono adduct. Similarly, the bis addend addition increases the HOMO energy by 0.23–0.25 eV and LUMO energy by 0.15–0.19 eV. Therefore, adding a –CH2 as a second addend to a mono-adduct derivative (IND, QM and PCBM) decreases the bandgap by about 0.05–0.08 eV and 0.09 eV and 0.06 eV for C70 and C60 except C60CH2QM, respectively. Notably, the bandgap of bare C70 is 0.06 eV lower than that of bare C60. While shifting from C60 to C70, there is only up to 0.03 eV change in the bandgap for the IND, QM and PCBM addends. However, a significant variation of bandgap, i.e., up to 0.08 eV can be achieved by changing the C60 core to C70 core with the (CH2)QM addend. The reason behind the reduction in the gap is the higher HOMO energy with C70CH2QM.
To understand the effect of the addends on the frontier molecular orbitals, we also checked where the HOMO and LUMO orbitals are localized. As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMO and the LUMO of PC60BM are primarily located on the C60 part, which is also true for all other C60 and C70 fullerene derivatives (see Section 7 in the ESI,† for the HOMO–LUMO of other molecules). Also the analysis of partial density of states (PDOS) also shows that the HOMO and the LUMO for all the molecules reside on the C60/C70 part. The densities of states of C60/70PCBM broken down into the contribution due to the C60/C70 part and the addend are shown in Fig. 4 (see Section 2 in the ESI,† for the PDOS of the other molecules). The addend states reside much higher in energy than the LUMO and much lower in energy than the HOMO and, therefore, are not expected to participate directly in charge separation and transport. However, as is shown later, in some cases the addend states contribute to visible absorption. Thus, the addends have an indirect contribution to the band alignment through their effect on HOMO–LUMO energies and to charge separation and transport through the change in mutual orientation of monomers within the crystal.

 Fig. 4  The partial density of states (PDOS) of C60/70PCBM obtained from Gaussian calculations. The contribution due to the C60/70 core part and the addend part for each C60 and C70 derivative is shown in blue and red color, respectively. Here and elsewhere the upper (positive values) and the lower (negative values) parts of the graph are for C60 and C70 cores with addends (PCBM for this case), respectively. DOS here and elsewhere are extracted by GaussSum.63 
For the purpose of comparison to DFTB calculations presented below, Fig. 5 shows the PDOS of PC60BM computed in Gaussian 09 with the PBE functional compared to that computed with the B3LYP functional. We observe with both functionals the same qualitative features (e.g. addend states lying much higher/lower in energy than the LUMO/HOMO) except the band gap is smaller with PBE, as expected.

The reorganization energies and driving forces for charge transport
The reorganization energy values are calculated for both the electron and hole transfer process and shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, together with the corresponding ΔG values. The values for C60 and PC60BM are similar to those reported in the literature.105 It is evident from Table 1 that the IND addends with a C60 core have a negligible effect on the reorganization energies for electron transfer compared to bare fullerene. The value increases for the QM and PCBM addends. However, a more significant difference in reorganization energy (about 0.05 eV or about twice the value of kT at room temperature) can be achieved with aryl and silyl–aryl addends with a C60 core (even higher than PCBM). The change in core size from C60 to C70 leads to a more prominent effect on reorganization energies: for a given addend, the reorganization energy change is more than 0.07 eV due to the increased core size. C70CH2QM shows an extraordinarily high value due to much relaxation in charged (anionic) geometry (more than 0.1 eV). Only the CH2CH2Ar2 addend with a C70 core has very low value of reorganization energy compared to the C60 core. Bare fullerenes possess a higher reorganization energy for hole transfer. Similar to the electron transfer case, the reorganization energy change is small for IND addends for the hole transfer process. QM and PCBM addends induce little difference in their reorganization energies (up to 0.02 eV) with a C60 core. In addition, the value for silyl–aryl addends with both the C60 and C70 core is marginally higher (up to 0.03 eV) than that for bare C60 and C70 fullerenes. For the hole transport process, the reorganization energy values decrease with an increase in core size.

The change in ΔG is of similar magnitude as the change in reorganization energy. The fullerene derivatives with the C70 cores have relatively higher ΔG values compared to the C60 core derivatives for the electron transport process, where IND and QM addends with the C70 core have the highest ΔG values. In contrast, the ΔG values of CH2CH2Ar2 and the silymethyl addends with the C70 core decrease compared to the C60 core for the electron transfer process. In the case of the hole transport process, the ΔG values of the C70 derivatives are smaller than those of the C60 derivatives. The ΔG value of bare C70 increases up to about 0.1 eV compared to that of bare C60 for the hole transport process. A slight increase in ΔG of the CH2Ar2 addend with the C70 core for hole transport is also noted. These seemingly slight changes in reorganization energy and ΔG can have an important effect on the charge transfer rate calculation as it is very sensitive to the absolute value and the difference between the reorganization energies and ΔG (see eqn (1)).
Optical properties

Fig. 6–10 show the light absorption behaviour of all the C60 and C70 based derivatives. Fig. 6 shows the absorption spectra of bare C60 and C70, Fig. 7 of C60/70 with PCBM, PCBMCH2 and bis-PCBM addends, Fig. 8 of C60/70 with QM, CH2QM and QM2 addends, Fig. 9 of C60/70 with IND, CH2IND and IND2 addends, and Fig. 10 of C60/70 with CH2Ar2, CH2CH2Ar2 and silymethyl addends. The calculations are done in a vacuum, as the experimental measurements of solar absorption of fullerene based molecules are typically done using solvents with low dielectric constants that do not have much effect on the electronic transitions.106 The computed spectra taper off below 400 nm because of a finite number of states considered in the TD-DFT calculations. Shaded areas in the figures show regions with no states. The computed spectrum of PC60BM is in good agreement with reported experimental and theoretical studies.107,108 The calculations are therefore sufficiently accurate to compare different derivatives. To illustrate the effect that addends may have on optical absorption, the absorption spectrum of PCBM is compared to that with additional CH2 and bis adduct in Fig. 7. The effects of CH2 and bis addends are similar in all the other cases.

 Fig. 10  The UV-visible absorption spectra of CH2Ar2, CH2CH2Ar2 addends and silymethyl with C60 and C70 cores. The upper and lower plots are for C60 and C70 derivatives respectively. 
For all the cases, the solar absorptivity of C70 derivatives is much higher than that of the C60 fullerene derivatives due to the higher solar absorptivity of bare C70 compared to the bare C60 molecule (see Fig. 6), which is in agreement with available experimental data.109 In particular, while the molar absorptivity of C60 derivatives (on the order of 1000 L mol−1 cm−1) is too low for quantitative absorption, the molar absorptivity of C70 based molecules is sufficiently high to provide a significant contribution to the photocurrent (the computed values on the order of 10000 L mol−1 cm−1 are similar to those provided by many popular metal–organic dyes).110–113 Generally, bi-addends result in slightly higher absorptivity than mono addends. The enhancement in absorptivity by the choice of the addends can be substantial, for example, as shown in Fig. 8, the CH2, QM bi-addend can increase the molar absorptivity substantially compared to PCBM as well as compared to mono addend fullerenes, for both C60 and C70 cores. However, the enhancement of molar absorptivity with the CH2, QM bi-addend on the C60 core is more prominent compared to the C70 analogue.

Fig. 9 shows the absorption spectra of molecules with the IND addend. The calculations suggest that also in this case, the CH2 and bis addend can significantly increase the molar absorptivity for both the C60 and C70 based derivatives. Significant changes in molar absorptivity for CH2CH2Ar2 and silylmethyl[60]fullerenes (SIMEF) are noticed (see Fig. 10). The absorption decreases for CH2CH2Ar2 with a C70 core compared to those with the C60 core. The molar absorptivity of silymethyl is lower than that with the CH2Ar2 addend with the C60 core, while it is much higher than that with CH2Ar2 with the C70 core. Therefore, addend and core size variation can substantially affect the solar absorptivity of fullerene derivatives.
The addend contributions to the electronic transitions are also investigated. Although in all molecules, the HOMO and LUMO are located on the C60/70 core, the HOMO-to-LUMO transition does not play a significant role in optical absorption. Instead, transitions between orbitals deep in the conduction and valence bands are important. Some of these orbitals are addend-centred, which is in agreement with a prior study.49 The most significant transitions involving addend-centred states are listed in Table 3. As an example, the green and the red sticks in the upper plot of Fig. 8 indicate the wavelength at which the addend based orbitals are involved in optical absorption. These states are shown in Section 3 of the ESI.† One can see therefore that functionalization of fullerenes can have a non-trivial effect also on light absorption properties. In some cases, e.g. C70–CH2Ar2, the transitions involving addend states can be significant contributors to visible absorption.

Charge transfer rate
We calculate the charge transfer rate using the Marcus equation (eqn (1)). In order to compute the value of ω, one has to calculate the key parameters in that equation, which are the driving force (ΔG), the reorganization energy (λ) and the transfer integral (J). The λ and the ΔG are strongly related to the molecular properties that are computed with isolated molecules. In contrast, the transfer integral (J) is related to the crystallinity of the material, i.e. J depends on mutual orientation of the monomers within the crystal. DFTB is used to compute all the crystal structures. We first perform benchmarking of DFTB vs. DFT for all isolated molecules.
Electronic structures (DFTB)

Fig. 11 shows the DFTB computed HOMO, LUMO and bandgap values for all the C60 and C70 derivatives. The absolute values are different from the DFT calculated values. However, the trend in HOMO, LUMO and gap is similar. As DFTB is parameterized to DFT calculations using the PBE functional,67 the reduction in band gap values is expected. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 which compares the band structures of PCBM obtained in DFT with PBE and B3LYP functionals. With DFTB, the LUMO energies for C70 derivatives are always found to be lower than the C60 derivatives, which is not the case with DFT (PBE) results. This can be due to the accuracy of DFTB parameterization. The addition of –CH2 and the bis addends to a C60 mono-addend fullerene derivative can increase the HOMO, LUMO, and bandgap by up to 0.19 eV, 0.14 eV and 0.08 eV, respectively, for QM, IND and PC60BM. A negligible change in the LUMO energy for the CH2QM addend with the C60 core is seen compared to C60QM, with an unaltered band gap, similar to the DFT results. The addition of –CH2 and bis addends to the C70 core mono-addend can increase the HOMO, LUMO and bandgap energy by up to 0.20, 0.12 and 0.07 eV, respectively, for QM, IND and PCBM. The increased HOMO and LUMO energies for the CH2Ar2 addend with a C70 core are also comparable with the DFT values. Although the silymethyl is computed with the matsci parameter set (for other derivatives, 3ob-3-1 is used), qualitatively its HOMO–LUMO energies relate to those of other molecules similarly to the DFT results. The nature of the frontier orbitals for all the derivatives is also analogous, and both the HOMO and LUMO are centred on the fullerene core. The partial densities of states for C60/70PCBM broken down into the contribution due to the C60/C70 part and the addend are shown in Fig. 12 (see Section 4 in the ESI,† for the PDOS of other molecules). In addition to that, we show the PDOS with the CH2Ar2 addend where one can see the effect of the C70 core vs. the C60 core (Fig. 13). Fig. 13 indicates that band structures obtained with DFT and DFTB for molecules with the C60 and C70 core with the CH2Ar2 addend are comparable. A similar behaviour was observed with other addends which are not shown here. We therefore conclude that DFTB reproduces the relative changes in band structure among the molecules well.

The reorganization energy
The reorganization energies are also computed with the DFTB method for each isolated molecule. Similar to the HOMO and LUMO values, the absolute value of reorganization energy for each derivative calculated with DFTB is smaller than the value obtained with DFT. The value for bare fullerene (both C60 and C70) is smaller compared to the DFT value for both the charge (electron and hole) transport processes. Similar to the DFT values for the electron transport process, the change in reorganization energy due to the addend effect is more prominent for QMs than PCBMs and INDs (see Table 4). The value also increases with the increase in core size. Only for C70CH2CH2Ar2 and C70Si derivatives the values decrease significantly in DFTB. For the hole transport process, the IND2, CH2QM and QM2 addends with a C60 core show significantly higher values relative to other addends (see Table 5). The value decreases (similar to DFT) with an increase of core size in these cases. The CH2Ar2, CH2CH2Ar2 and Si derivatives have high reorganization energy values for the hole transport process, which is also comparable with DFT results. The structural parameters (bond length, bond angle etc.) obtained from both the DFT and DFTB are also similar, as can be seen from Fig. S31 in the ESI,† which compares the bond lengths and angles of PC60BM obtained with DFT and DFTB.

Shown in Fig. 14 are the density of states (DOS) computed by the DFTB method, of the isolated PC60BM molecule and its crystalline structure. Fig. 14 shows a noticeable effect of crystallinity: the conduction band is stabilized by 0.23 eV while the valence band is stabilized by 0.08 eV for the PC60BM case, vs. single molecule. For most molecules, the valence and conduction band energies are significantly stabilized due to the crystallinity by ∼0.1 and ∼0.2 eV, respectively. The strongest stabilization of the conduction and the valence bands in the crystal vs. single molecule are found to be of 0.38 eV, 0.14 eV for CH2PCBM and CH2IND addend with the C60 core, respectively. The effect of crystallinity on the HOMO–LUMO and bandgap values for all the derivatives is shown in Table S3 in the ESI.† This is expected to have a significant effect on band alignment with a donor, as ΔG changes of ∼0.1 eV can easily change the electron transfer rate by a factor of 2.114,115

Calculations of the transfer integral (J) and the charge transfer rate
As the transfer integral depends on the mutual monomer positions within the crystal, one can imagine several combinations of monomers that will lead to several transfer integral values for each crystal structure. Therefore, we shortlist (depending on the crystal packing) up to ten such combinations of monomers and calculate the transfer integral for all of them with the VOTCA code. It is to be noted that the transfer integral value is computed only from the contribution of the HOMO and LUMO for the hole and the electron transfer, respectively. The contribution due to other orbitals are not included here. The highlighted dimer positions which are used to calculate the transfer integral are shown in Section 6 in the ESI,† on the example C60CH2IND crystal structure. Depending on the monomer packing within the crystal structure, the values of the hole and electron transfer integrals vary significantly. The electron and hole transfer rates are computed by eqn (1), which depends on the transfer integral values. Therefore, several charge transport rates are estimated depending on several transfer integral values and the highest estimated rate among all the possibilities is reported in Table 6.

One observes in Table 6 variations of up to five orders of magnitude in both electron and hole transfer rates which can be induced by the selection of the addends and the fullerene core. The computed rates are exponentially sensitive to various parameters and the absolute values should be treated with caution; however, they are deemed to be reliable for the purpose of comparing between different molecules. The computed rates suggest that hole transfer rates on the order of 1013 s−1 can be achieved with IND, QM and CH2PCBM addends with both C60 and C70 cores. The electron transfer rates for IND and QM addends with the C60 core are significantly higher than that of PC60BM. The –CH2 and bis addend addition to PCBM further improve the charge transfer rates. The aryl and silyl addends show lower rates for the C60 core, but, addition of –CH2 to the aryl addend improves the rate. The electron transfer rates for C70 derivatives are generally lower, while hole transfer rates are higher than the C60 ones, except for the aryl addend. The addition of –CH2 and a bisaddend also enhances the electron transfer rates significantly for the addends with the C70 core. The rates are calculated for the lowest energy crystal structure for all the fullerene derivatives. It is be noted that there is a significant sensitivity of the rates to the exact conformations. The magnitude of the rate might also be very different in other local minima. Therefore, it is important to consider the effect of dynamics on each crystal structure, which will be the subject of a separate future study.
There is a limited number of rate calculations in the literature, for specific fullerene derivatives. For example, Arntsen et al.116 estimated an electron transfer rate (via LUMO) of 5.88 × 1012 s−1 for the closest dimers of PC60BM using the Marcus equation, which is very close to our value of 5.87 × 1012 s−1. Pelzer et al.117 computed a rate of 6.78 × 1013 s−1 which is much larger than experimental based estimates ranging from 4 × 109 to 5 × 1011 s−1. Pelzer et al. also used Kramers’ theory and Langevin molecular dynamics, with which they arrived at rates on the order of 109–1012 s−1 depending on the choice of polaron effective mass. Other calculations in the literature made approximations capable of throwing the rate off by orders of magnitude, such as by neglecting ΔG50. The experimentally based values are of course subject to thermal motions and other effects which are not captured by the dimer model; they also depend on the accuracy of measuring mobility with reported measured mobility values differing by orders of magnitude.118–122 The values in Table 6 are also for the closest dimers. The model is exponentially sensitive to computed inter-molecular distances, reorganization energies and driving forces. It is therefore expected that absolute values may not match and it is relative values among molecules that are more meaningful. This is why it is important to have a truly comparative set of values for different molecules computed with the same approximations and computational parameters, as is done here.
Conclusions
Rational selection of fullerene derivatives as acceptor and electron transport layers in organic and planar perovskite solar cells is very important to maximize power conversion efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to have a truly comparative picture of properties that can alter the PCE for all the major fullerene based solar cells. This Density Functional Theory–Density Functional Tight Binding based systematic and comparative study considered several C60 and C70 derivatives with different sets of addends in the molecular as well as solid state.
Our study indicates that the chemical nature and the number of addends as well as fullerene core size can significantly affect the molecular properties key for solar cell functionality. Along with the molecular properties such as HOMO and LUMO levels and optical properties, the effect of crystallinity on the band structure and charge transport are also investigated.
We have shown that the choice of addends and of the core can change the HOMO, LUMO and gap values by fractions of an eV and can have a significant impact on band alignment and light absorption properties. This is in spite of the fact that addend-centered electronic states are significantly above the LUMO and below the HOMO energies, while both frontier orbitals remain centered on the fullerene in all cases.
Visible absorption is computed to be weak with C60 derivatives and strong with C70 derivatives, as is well known. Here, we have shown that the extinction coefficient can be modulated by the choice of the addends and that with some addends, addend states significantly contribute to the absorption spectrum.
We have shown that effects of crystallinity on band alignment are important and can be effectively modeled with the DFTB method; their inclusion improves substantially theoretical estimates of the LUMO and thereby band alignment. Modeling of the crystal structure is also necessary to compute charge transfer rates, which was done here. The rate calculations showed that both electron and hole transfer rates can change by orders of magnitude depending on the choice of the addends.
The data on band alignment and charge transport rates presented here are expected to be directly useful for rationalizing the performance of devices using different fullerene derivatives and for rational selection of such materials.

 	Fig. 1  Fullerene derivatives studied in this work. Only C60-based molecules are shown. The C70-based molecules studies here have the same addends.	 

 	Fig. 2  The HOMO (lower edge of the bars), LUMO (upper edge) and band gap (length of the bars with values printed on the bars) energies for all the C60 and C70 derivatives; all the values are obtained from Gaussian-optimized geometries. The first two values are computed with the PBE functional and the rest are computed with the B3LYP functional with the same basis set (6-31+g(d,p)).	 

 	Fig. 3  The HOMO and the LUMO of the PC60BM molecule. Atom color scheme: carbon – brown, oxygen – red, hydrogen – pink. Visualization by VESTA.104	 

 	Fig. 4  The partial density of states (PDOS) of C60/70PCBM obtained from Gaussian calculations. The contribution due to the C60/70 core part and the addend part for each C60 and C70 derivative is shown in blue and red color, respectively. Here and elsewhere the upper (positive values) and the lower (negative values) parts of the graph are for C60 and C70 cores with addends (PCBM for this case), respectively. DOS here and elsewhere are extracted by GaussSum.63	 

 	Fig. 5  The partial density of states (PDOS) of PC60BM obtained from Gaussian calculations. The upper and the lower parts are plotted for PBE and B3LYP functionals with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set.
