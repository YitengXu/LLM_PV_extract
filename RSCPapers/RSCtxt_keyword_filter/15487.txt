In this work, solution processable graphene oxide (GO) thin films were first utilized as an insulating layer to construct MIS silicon solar cells. The efficient water-soluble GO nano-sheets with controlled thickness produced a good contact with the hydrophilic silicon surfaces. The average open circuit voltage (VOC) of the GO incorporated MIS silicon solar cell was increased by 0.2 V, while their power conversion efficiency (PCE) was demonstrated as 88% higher than that of the corresponding Schottky solar cells. The improvement of the device performance in the GO-based MIS silicon solar cell is attributed to the increased built-in potential as well as the reduced interface defect, resulting in reduced carrier recombination. The ability to establish a low-cost and solution-processable insulating layer will open the door for wide application in photovoltaic and other optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) silicon solar cells have great potential for cost-effective solar energy conversion. Although commercial crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells exhibit high power conversion efficiency (PCE), they are still expensive not only due to the cost of crystalline Si wafers but also the complex ion implantation process required to fabricate p–n junctions.1 Various surface barrier based silicon solar cells, for example, Si/organic heterojunction solar cells,2–5 metal–semiconductor (Schottky) solar cells,6–8 and metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) solar cells,9–13 have received much attention in the past due to their simple fabrication process. For instance, Si/poly(3-hexylthiophene) heterojunction solar cells achieved a PCE of 10.1%,2 while doped graphene/Si Schottky solar cells exhibited a PCE of 8.6%.7 In comparison with the Schottky barrier solar cells, the MIS Si solar cells with an insulator layer (typically SiOx) between the metal and the Si show higher open circuit voltage (VOC) and superior device performance.10,14 The purpose of the insulator layer in the MIS solar cells is to block the majority carriers injected into the metal at forward bias to reduce surface recombination.14,15 However, as for the conventional MIS Si solar cells, elevated temperature (200–900 °C) is usually needed to deposit a 2–3 nm thick SiOx layer, which not only complicates the fabrication process but also increases the energy consumption and cost to a certain extent.16 Therefore, investigation of high quality but low cost insulating layers is of great importance for future MIS Si solar cells.
Graphene oxide (GO), a derivative of graphene, attracts much attention in optoelectronic devices due to its solution processability as well as its tunable work function.17–21 For example insulating GO and reduced GO (r-GO) are being investigated intensively as effective hole and/or electron transport layers in both organic solar cells (OPV) and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).22–26 In this work, we experimentally demonstrated that solution processed GO can be used as an effective insulating layer for MIS Si solar cells. Compared with the conventional insulating SiOx layer, the preparation of GO via solution processing has a far lower temperature, which can minimize the grain boundary diffusion in doped crystalline Si, preserve minority carrier lifetime and reduce the energy consumption. In addition, the highly water-soluble GO nano-sheets can produce a good contact with the hydrophilic silicon surfaces, which is critical for surface passivation and carrier transportation. We show that the average VOC of the GO incorporated MIS solar cell was obviously higher than that of n-Si/Au Schottky barrier solar cells, as well as their average PCE reaching 4.5%, which is 88% higher than that of solar cells without incorporation of the GO layer.
Experimental section
GO solution preparation and its optical characterization
The single layer of GO (powder, with average flake size of 800 nm) was obtained from Cheap Tubes Inc., which was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.27 GO solution with a concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1 was prepared with a mixed solvent (deionized water and ethanol with volume ratio of 1:1). The optical properties of the GO were studied by UV-vis (Lambda 750), photoluminescence (Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer), and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia Raman Spectroscope with 514 nm excitation wavelength).
Device fabrication and measurements
The solar cells were fabricated on n-type c-Si (100) wafer (resistivity: 1–10 Ω cm). The Si wafer was cleaned sequentially with detergent and deionized water, followed by immersion in diluted HF solution (with weight ratio of 2%) for 5 min to remove the native SiOx. The wafer was then rinsed thoroughly by using the deionized water and dried by a flow of nitrogen gas before use. The GO thin film was deposited on the cleaned Si substrate by spin casting from the prepared GO solution. The thickness of the GO thin film could be changed by varying the spin rate. For comparison, the deposited GO thin films on Si substrates would also be thermally annealed under a continuous flow of 30 standard cubic centimeters of hydrogen gas, at a rate of 20 °C min−1, and held at a temperature of 400 °C for 3 h, and allowed to cool to room temperature before taking it out. The surface morphology of GO and r-GO (undergone the above thermal reduction process) thin films deposited on the Si substrate was characterized with atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope Veeco). Both the top (Au, ∼12 nm) and bottom contacts (Al, ∼150 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation. The area of each device was 0.09 cm2, as determined by the area of the gold electrode. All the electrical measurements of the devices were carried out in ambient air. The current–voltage (J–V) measurements were tested by using a Keithley 2400 source meter and a Newport Oriel solar simulator with a mask. The light intensity was calibrated to be 100 mW cm−2 by using a calibrated silicon solar cell, which had been standardized by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by using an Oriel IQE-200. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) and capacitance–frequency (C–f) plots were measured using an Agilent 4284A Precision LCR Meter.
Results and discussion
Fig. 1a gives the device structure of the GO based MIS Si solar cell, with schematic GO structure in the inset. The driving force for the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is the built-in electric field existing in the depletion region of the MIS junction. The corresponding energy diagram of the MIS junction at thermal equilibrium is shown in Fig. 1b. Under illumination, the separated holes and electrons would be collected by the anode (Au) and cathode (Al), respectively. The barrier height (φB) presented to the electrons in the metal by the semiconductor alone and the thickness (δ) of the insulator are important parameters to determine the majority-carrier (electron) current which can be written as 
J = A*T2exp(−qφB/kT)exp(−χ1/2δ)[exp(qV/nkT) − 1]11,12
(1)where A* is the effective Richardson constant, T the temperature, k the Boltzmann constant, χ (eV) the mean barrier height presented by the insulator layer, n the ideality factor, and exp(−χ1/2δ) the tunneling transmission probability. The VOC is given by 
VOC = (nkT/q)[ln(JSC/J0) + χ1/2δ]
(2)where J0 = A*T2exp(−qφB/kT), JSC the corresponding short circuit current under illumination. Previous studies demonstrated that the JSC would be the same current as that without the insulator layer as long as δ is less than 2 nm,11,28 while φB of the MIS junction would be higher than that without the interfacial layer.1 The JSC of the MIS solar cell can be taken as the diffusion current of the minority carrier.11 As seen from eqn (2), both the increased φB and the tunnel transmission coefficient (χ1/2δ) for the majority carrier would contribute to the enhanced VOC. Similar to the traditional insulator layer of SiOx, the increase of φB in such a GO based MIS Si solar cell facilitates electron (major carrier) blocking. The electrons transport through the GO film is mainly governed by the tunneling process, while the holes go through the GO film most likely via hole transfer since the work function of GO (∼5.0 eV) is close to the valence band edge of crystalline Si.22

In our study, GO films with two different GO thicknesses (i.e., 4 nm and 1 nm) were used to construct the MIS Si solar cells. Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b are the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the GO films (without thermal reduction) deposited on the Si substrates with thickness of ∼4 nm and ∼1 nm, respectively. The thickness of deposited GO films was estimated from the corresponding cross-section profile (see Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, respectively). It is worth noting that the thickness of the GO film is only an approximate value. For instance, there are a few single layers of GO flakes overlapped on the bottom single-layer GO (indicated by the white circles in Fig. 2b), while some small vacancies (indicated by the white arrows in Fig. 2b) are observed at the GO flakes' boundaries although with lower density with the increase of GO layers (see Fig. 2a). The surface root mean square (rms) roughness (Rq) of the deposited GO films is 0.78 and 0.50 nm, respectively as calculated from Fig. 2a and 2b. For comparison, the r-GO films were also used to construct the Si solar cells. The Rq of the corresponding r-GO film is decreased to 0.43 (r-GO film reduced from GO film of ∼4 nm) and 0.30 nm (r-GO reduced from GO film of ∼1 nm), with their thickness reduced to be around 2.8 nm and 0.7 nm, respectively. The reduced thickness of r-GO films is due to the fact that the adsorbed molecules can be partially removed from GO during thermal reduction.

(a) GO film with thickness of ∼4 nm; (b) GO film with thickness of ∼1 nm, the white circles and arrows indicate the overlapping area and the vacancies, respectively. The corresponding cross-section profiles of GO films with thickness of 4 nm and 1 nm are illustrated in (c) and (d), respectively. The vertical distance of 2.028 nm showing in (d) denotes the 2 times thickness of the single layer of GO. 
It is worth noting that the hydrophilicity of the Si surface is found to be vital for the formation of uniform GO films using the spin casting method. We noted that the GO films could be coated on the hydrophilic substrates by spin casting from the prepared GO solution. In our experiment, we found that the Si surface was rather hydrophobic after the HF etching process and it could become very hydrophilic by thoroughly rising with water. As for the GO based insulating thin film, the vacancies could be diminished by using a GO sheet with a larger lateral size, and the layer thickness would be well controlled via more advanced GO deposition methods, e.g., Langmuir–Blodgett assembly,29 both of which could be further studied in future investigations.
The optical properties of the GO were studied by using UV-vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Due to the π–π* transition,30 the GO solution shows an optical absorption peak at around 225 nm (see Fig. 3). No clear absorption edge was observed, suggesting the absence of a well-defined bandgap. The PL spectrum (not shown, with excitation wavelength of 350 nm) of the GO suspension in water is a broad emission with a full width at half maximum of ∼250 nm. Such a broad prominent PL spectrum centered at a long wavelength (λ) may arise from the numerous disorder-induced defect states within the π–π* gap.20 The Raman spectrum of the GO deposited on silicon substrate is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. As seen, the prominent D-band (∼1350 cm−1) as well as the weak and broad 2D-band (∼2700 cm−1) indicates the significant structural disorder in the GO film. We also found that the G/D ratio was nearly constant before and after thermal reduction (400 °C for 3 h under hydrogen flowing gas), which is most likely due to the fact that the reduction process did not lead to an expansion of the original sp2 clusters even though restored by de-oxidation.31

To complete the Si solar cells, a thin layer of Au (∼12 nm) was deposited as the top electrode (anode), with a layer of Al (∼150 nm) coated on the back side of the Si as the back electrode (cathode). The Si MIS solar cells using the above GO films with thickness of around 4 nm and 1 nm, (shown in Fig. 2) are denoted as D1 and D2, respectively; while the corresponding Si solar cells with r-GO films with thickness of around 2.8 nm and 0.7 nm are denoted as D3 and D4, respectively. For comparison, a reference device (Au/Si/Al) without the interfacial layer of GO or r-GO was also prepared, which is denoted as D5 in the following. It worth noting that the photocurrent generated in these devices mainly stems from the Si, while the possible contribution from the GO or r-GO films should be negligible since the GO or r-GO films are extremely thin (<4 nm) and absorb few photons under the sun illumination.32 Fig. 4a gives the representative J–V curves of D1–D5 under AM 1.5 illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The D1 shows a relatively high average PCE of 4.5%, with average JSC = 15.1 mA cm−2, average VOC = 0.46 V, and average FF = 65.2%. Considering about 50% light loss from the semi-transparent Au electrode (∼12 nm),33,34 thus much higher PCE could be expected by using a fully transparent top contact. While the reference device D5 only gives an average PCE of 2.4% and average VOC of 0.27 V. The average PCE of D1 is 88% higher than that of D5, which is mainly due to the increased VOC (ΔVOC ∼ 0.2 V). The representative plots of EQE for D1 and D5 are shown in Fig. 4b. As seen, the EQE of D1 is larger than that of D5 in the range of 300 to 540 nm, while it becomes smaller than that of D5 from 560 to 920 nm. The EQE is determined by a number of factors including efficiency of optical absorption and the series resistance of the device. Since the absorption length (xL) of Si is less than 2 μm for λ below 540 nm,35 the photons with short wavelengths could be absorbed in the region close to the depletion region (with width W of around 0.8 μm). The photons (λ < 540 nm) induced electron–hole pairs in D1 can be separated and collected more efficiently than in D5 due to the reduced surface recombination, leading to the higher EQE. While for the longer wavelengths (560–920 nm), the xL becomes several tens of micrometers. A large amount of photon (560 < λ < 920 nm) induced carriers have to diffuse for a long distance before arriving at the depletion region where they can be separated and then collected. In the process of diffusion, the photogenerated carriers suffer from a relatively high rate of recombination, suggesting that the advantage of the reduced surface recombination would be partially lost for these carriers. Although the introduced GO layer enhances the VOC, it can also lead to additional series resistance (Rs) which is negative for device performance. We note that the typical Rs of D5 is 2.4 Ω cm2 which is lower than that of D1 (2.9 Ω cm2). Therefore, the higher EQE of D5 in the range of 560–920 nm can be partially ascribed to its lower Rs.

The effect of GO thickness (δ) on the device performance should be significant. However, we found that uniform GO film with thickness more than 4 nm was hard to obtain in our experiment. Therefore, we only used the GO film with thickness of 4 nm and 1 nm in our current study. When using a thinner GO, the average PCE of D2 is decreased to 3.2% with a smaller average VOC (0.34 V) than that of D1. As the GO film was thermally annealed for reduction, the performance of the devices (D3 and D4) deteriorated with PCE less than 3.0%, mainly owing to the reduced FF (∼40%). The decreased PCE of the r-GO based devices (D3 and D4) can be ascribed to the increased Rs (D1: typical 2.9 Ω cm2 versus D3: typical 23.9 Ω cm2). The ideality factor of D1–D5 which is related to the VOC, can be extracted from the typical lnJ–V data (see Fig. 5) taken from the devices measured in the dark. The series resistance Rs, parallel resistance (Rp), and the ideality factor (n) for D1–D5 are summarized in Table 1. The ideality factor for these devices is generally increased (from 1.10 to 1.39) with the increase in thickness of the insulating layer, which is consistent with the prediction proposed by Lillington and Townsend for thermally grown SiOx based MIS Si solar cells.36 We also note that the average VOC of D4 is increased by 0.11 V as compared to that of D2. We believe that a layer of SiOx formed in the process of thermal annealing due to the residual oxygen gas, which could be responsible for the decreased FF and the improved VOC of the r-GO based devices (D3 and D4). In order to verify this point, another device (D6) was fabricated with the same structure as D5 but undergoing the above thermal annealing process for GO reduction. The performance of D6 was found to be extremely poor with average PCE = 0.7%, average JSC = 6.7 mA cm−2, average VOC = 0.46 V, and average FF = 21.7%. Compared with D5, the average VOC of D6 was increased by 0.2 V, indicating a layer of SiOx formed in the thermal annealing process. The deposited GO film can also partially prevent the oxidation of the Si underneath, since the JSC and FF of D6 are much lower than that of D4, implying thicker SiOx presented in D6. The average performance characteristics (JSC, VOC, FF, PCE) of D1–D6 with error bars of one standard deviation are presented in Fig. 6.

While J–V characteristics allow us to evaluate the device performance, analysis of the capacitance versus bias (C–V) measurements provides further information about the magnitude of the built-in potential ψbi which is associated with the VOC.4,7,12 Fig. 7a illustrates the typical 1/C2–V plots at 1 MHz for D1–D5. The extrapolation of these plots to the voltage axis gives the corresponding ψbi. As expected, the built-in potential ψbi was observed to increase from 0.44 V for D5 to 0.55 V for D1 (see Fig. 7a). Other GO or r-GO based Si solar cells also show an improved built-in potential ψbi. In terms of the ψbi, the depletion width W (see Fig. 1b) at zero bias can be estimated as [2εSi(ψbi − kT/q)/(qND)]1/2, in which εSi is the permittivity of Si, ND the donor concentration in Si.37 The calculated depletion width W for D1 and D5 is found to be 0.83 μm and 0.74 μm, respectively (assuming ND to be 1015 cm−3). Besides the C–V analysis, we also measured the typical capacitance as a function of frequency (see Fig. 7b), from which the density of interface states can be obtained.36 For a wide measurement-frequency range (105–106 Hz), the capacitance of the GO or r-GO based device (D1–D4) is suppressed to be lower than that of D5, suggesting their lower density of interface states.4,38 The above capacitance measurements demonstrate that the improved built-in potential and the reduced interface defects do exist in the GO or r-GO based Si solar cells, which contribute to the enhanced open circuit voltage. The increase in built-in potential or barrier height (ψbi or φB) is believed to be associated with the charge located within the insulator layer.39

Conclusions
We demonstrate that the solution-processable GO can be used as an effective insulating layer for MIS Si solar cells. The VOC of the GO-based MIS Si solar cells was improved substantially, leading to PCE enhancement by 88% as compared with that of reference devices (Schottky solar cells). We attribute the improvement in the device performance to the overall reduced carrier recombination arising from both the increase in the built-in potential and the reduced interface defects which were confirmed by the C–V and C–f measurements. The r-GO based Si devices were also constructed and studied for comparison; the fabricated r-GO based Si solar cells exhibited inferior performance than that of GO based MIS Si solar cells, mainly owing to the larger series resistance from the additional SiOx layer formed during the thermal reduction process. The high PCE of the GO-based MIS Si solar cells can be anticipated by using a fully transparent top contact.
