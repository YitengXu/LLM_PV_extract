    , Accepted 21st August 2018First published on 21st August 2018AbstractWe report a highly effective interface engineering strategy for thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by employing a zwitterion-modified SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and a dopant-free hole transport layer (HTL). A zwitterionic compound, 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate, is used to modify the SnO2 ETL. The zwitterion, which forms interfacial dipoles, plays a few important roles: (1) it causes shifts in the work function of SnO2 resulting in more efficient charge extraction and an increase in the built-in potential. (2) It pulls electrons from perovskite layers to the ETL/perovskite interface, enhancing the electron transport ability. (3) Interfacial dipoles prevent back transfer of electrons from the ETL to the perovskite and suppress charge recombination. (4) Positively charged atoms in the zwitterion passivate Pb–I antisite defects, improving the stability of devices. With these desirable properties, the PSC with doped Spiro-OMeTAD obtained a power conversion efficiency of 21.43%. In addition, the PSC with the dopant-free HTL exhibited a record high efficiency of 20.5% among dopant-free polymeric HTLs using green solvents. The resulting PSCs without encapsulation showed excellent thermal stability. Accordingly, this work suggests that the use of a modified ETL and a dopant-free HTL is a promising strategy to overcome the thermal instability of planar-PSCs (P-PSCs).

Broader context
Tin oxide (SnO2) is a promising material for the electron transport layer in planar perovskite solar cells (P-PSCs) due to its suitable energy level and high electron mobility. SnO2-based P-PSCs show the highest power conversion efficiency among planar structure devices, but the PCE remains still low compared to the mesoporous TiO2-based PSCs and there is a lack of thermal stability study. Thermal instability definitely originates from the instability of organic hybrid perovskites. Therefore, all-inorganic hybrid perovskites are developed, achieving thermal stability, but the highest efficiency reaches only ca. 13%. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate high thermal stability and efficiency for P-PSCs, simultaneously, by employing modified SnO2 and a dopant-free polymer. The modified SnO2 shows high conductivity, effective charge extraction ability and high recombination resistance. Empirically, efficiencies of 21.43% and 20.5% were reached for devices with doped Spiro-OMeTAD and with dopant-free asy-PBTBDT, respectively, in the present study. The devices with modified SnO2 show excellent stability under mild (humidity of 25%) and harsh conditions (humidity of 85%; temperature of 85 °C). Thus, our newly developed method guarantees highly efficient and thermally stable P-PSCs.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been highlighted in optoelectronic fields due to their fascinating photovoltaic properties.1–4 Over the past few years, the maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have increased from 3.8% to more than 20%.1,5 In particular, a large area PSC achieved a record high PCE of 12.6%.6 In general, state-of-the-art PSCs employ mesoporous structures, in which mesoporous scaffolds are used as electron transport layers (ETLs). The mesoporous scaffolds increase the contact area between the ETL and the perovskite, and facilitate control of electron and hole fluxes, which are related to current density–voltage (J−V) hysteresis.7–11 However, mesoporous PSCs (M-PSCs) require a complex process incorporating an additional sintering step (>500 °C), which is a barrier for commercialisation of PSCs. Therefore, the demand for high-efficiency P-PSCs using a titanium oxide (TiO2),12,13 zinc oxide (ZnO),14–16 or tin oxide (SnO2)17–19 compact layer has increased.
In particular, SnO2 has been considered as a promising ETL candidate since it has excellent electrical properties, even when it is fabricated at a low temperature (<200 °C). Moreover, suitable energy levels and high electron mobility (≈10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) allow SnO2 to be a suitable material for use as an ETL.20,21 Therefore, several attempts have been made to achieve highly efficient P-PSCs by employing SnO2. Most of the previous PSC-related studies have focused on improving the quality of ETLs and perovskites to enhance photovoltaic performance. Hagfeldt et al. reported that SnO2 ETLs prepared using atomic layer deposition (ALD) have more favourable band alignment than TiO2 ETLs and obtained an almost hysteresis-less PCE of ≈18%.22 Later, the same group reported a new method, in which spin-coating and chemical bath deposition (CBD) were combined to prepare SnO2 ETLs, and demonstrated a high PCE close to ca. 20% with negligible hysteresis.23 Recently, You et al. introduced excess PbI2 to passivate the perovskite layer and achieved a PCE higher than 20% for SnO2-based PSCs.24
Despite the excellent photovoltaic performances of SnO2-based PSCs, the instability of PSCs in severe environments (e.g. UV light,25 humidity,26 thermal stress,27etc.) limits further commercialisation of such devices. Therefore, in recent years, research on the stability improvement of PSCs has been actively carried out in perovskite fields. To enhance UV light stability, the ETL and the perovskite layer have been revised and devices could be protected from UV light by using UV filters.28,29 In addition, moisture instability could be overcome by replacing doped Spiro-OMeTAD with a hydrophobic polymer or encapsulating the devices.26,30 Our group previously reported PSCs, which retain the initial PCE after 1400 hours at 75% humidity, by employing a dopant-free polymer as a hole transport layer (HTL).26 Moreover, interface engineering has also been considered as a suitable strategy to solve the stability issue.31–33 Although the UV light and humidity instability can be well avoided by reported methods, thermal stability cannot be ensured.34 However, there are few studies on thermal stability, which is the most challenging issue affecting the device stability of PSCs.
There are several strategies to enhance the thermal stability of PSCs (e.g. inorganic HTLs,34,35 inorganic perovskites,36,37 2D perovskites,38 surface passivation,39,40etc.41). An inorganic HTL is a superior material compared to an organic HTL, but it is not a fundamental solution to mitigate the decomposition of perovskites at high temperatures.35 In terms of intrinsic properties of perovskites, inorganic-based or 2D perovskites exhibit excellent thermal stability. However, PSCs employing these perovskites exhibit only ca. 13% efficiency because of the large band gaps (>1.7 eV).37,38 In order to obtain thermal stability with high efficiency, a few groups have paid attention to surface passivation. Recently, Niu et al. applied semiconducting molecules into a perovskite film to passivate Pb–I antisite defects and demonstrated efficient and stable PSCs.39 In addition, Zhao et al. proved that the same passivation effect worked well even though a quaternary ammonium halide was added into the perovskite precursor as an additive.40 Therefore, additional improvements of efficiency and stability can be expected by passivation, and further studies are required to achieve thermal stability of highly efficient P-PSCs.
Herein, we report a zwitterion-modified SnO2 ETL for achieving thermally stable and highly efficient P-PSCs. A zwitterionic compound, 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate, is used to modify the SnO2 ETL surface. It is well known that a zwitterion, in which cationic and anionic charges are immobilised on the same molecule, enhances charge extraction.42–44 We suggest that the zwitterion introduced onto the SnO2 ETL plays some important roles in P-PSCs such as forming interfacial dipoles, shifting the work function of the ETL, preventing back electron transfer and suppressing charge recombination. In addition, the zwitterion passivates Pb–I antisite traps of the perovskite owing to its positively charged atom, improving the thermal stability of devices. These phenomena result in a PCE of 21.43% for the device employing doped Spiro-OMeTAD and a record high PCE of 20.5% for the device with dopant-free asy-PBTBDT as the HTL in the developed zwitterion-modified PSCs. In particular, the obtained PSCs show excellent stability (e.g. long-term, photo, thermal and humidity). For the first time, our findings suggest that improved thermal stability of P-PSCs can be demonstrated by simple interface engineering and a dopant-free HTL.
Results and discussion
A schematic diagram of our regular P-PSCs based on SnO2 ETLs is displayed in Fig. 1a. The zwitterion material, 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate, was employed to modify the surface of SnO2 ETLs. The chemical structure and the electrostatic potential (ESP) map of the zwitterion are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to calculate and visualize the ESP map, which exhibits the charge distribution of the zwitterion molecule at the B3LYP/6-31G level. A gradual change in colour from red to blue is observed above the structure and this indicates the degree of abundance of electrons.45 The molecular dipole moment (μmol) of the zwitterion is 14.24 D, as calculated by DFT. The value is significantly higher than the μmol of reported materials.46 Hereinafter, we denote the pristine SnO2 ETL as SnO2 and the zwitterion-modified SnO2 as Zw–SnO2.

The hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface can react chemically and form bonds with the zwitterion molecules, which include anions such as –COO−, –SO3− and –SO4−.47,48 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements were conducted to confirm the chemical bond formation on the SnO2 surface before and after zwitterion modification. The FTIR spectrum of the SnO2 surface showed the absorption bands of Sn–O at 500 cm−1, and the new peaks that appeared upon reacting with the zwitterion.49 The absorption bands of SO3− at 1100 cm−1 and 1200 cm−1, CN at 1600 cm−1, and C–H at 3000 cm−1 indicate that the zwitterion was introduced successfully onto the surface of SnO2 (Fig. 1b).50 Furthermore, the bonding state of Zw–SnO2 was analysed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. As shown in the XPS survey spectra (Fig. 1c and Fig. S2, ESI†), the peak intensities of O 1s (∼530 eV) and C 1s (∼284 eV) increased, and the S 2p peak (∼167 eV) appeared after surface modification. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the Sn 3d core-level XPS spectra of SnO2 and Zw–SnO2. A positive shift in the binding energy can be observed in the XPS spectrum of Zw–SnO2, indicating the formation of a chemical bond between the zwitterion and the SnO2 substrate.51
To elucidate the influence of the zwitterion on the surface energy levels of the SnO2 ETLs, two different types of ETLs were analysed using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as shown in Fig. 1d. The data are plotted as photoemission intensity versus binding energy. An obvious difference is observed in the spectra of the two ETLs. The work function (WF) and the valence band maximum (VBM) were calculated from the binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) in the range of 15–20 eV and the binding energy onset (Eonset) in the range of 0–6 eV, respectively.52 The conduction band minimum (CBM) of the ETL was derived from the VBM and the bandgap (Eg) values determined using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S4, ESI†).20 The energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 1e, and detailed values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The work function of SnO2 shifted from 4.34 eV to 4.23 eV owing to the modification with the zwitterion, and this energy level shift confirmed the dipole effects of the proposed zwitterionic molecule.53,54
In addition, good dispersion of the zwitterion on the SnO2 surface was verified through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Fig. 2).55 Additional dark areas ascribable to aggregates of zwitterionic materials were observed as the concentrations of the zwitterion solution increased. As shown in Fig. 2f and g, red and green spots, which correspond to carbon and sulphur atoms of the zwitterion, respectively, are dispersed uniformly on the SnO2 surface. To check whether the SnO2 surface is fully covered with the zwitterion or not, molecular orientation was examined using near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) at the surface state (Fig. S5, ESI†).56 The average α value of the Zw–SnO2 film was 46.43° (α = 90°, edge-on; and α = 0°, face-on orientation), and the dichroic ratio (R) was −0.3 (R = 0.7, edge-on; R = 0, random; and R = −1, face-on orientation). This was because the anchored zwitterion on the SnO2 was not fully covered and, therefore, showed face-on orientation rather than edge-on orientation.57

To compare the conductivity between the Zw–SnO2 and other modified-ETLs having interface dipoles, the current–voltage (I−V) characteristics of the devices composed of FTO/SnO2/Interlayer/Au (Fig. S6, ESI†) were measured. From the slope of the I−V plot, we calculated the conductivity (σ) of each ETL using a simple equation (see ESI†).16 The thickness was estimated from cross-sectional SEM images for each ETL. The conductivities of each ETL are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The conductivity of the SnO2 ETL was the highest value when it was modified with the zwitterion, and it decreased after PEIE modification because of the insulating property of the polymer. Therefore, it is expected that the use of Zw–SnO2 can enhance charge transport due to enhanced conductivity.
According to previous studies, vacancies in a perovskite crystal such as I− and MA+ are dominant factors for trap states.39,58 We expected that the zwitterion on the SnO2 ETL could passivate these defect sites like PCBM derivatives.58–60 In particular, Pb–I antisite defects, where iodine forms a trimer with neighbouring iodine atoms, are dealt with in this study.61 As schematically shown in Fig. 3a, the interaction between positively charged atoms in the zwitterion and Pb–I antisite defects is responsible for trap passivation.39 In order to confirm the effect of this interaction on trap states, DFT calculations were performed to calculate the density of states (DOS) of the perovskites.62 The DOS values of the perovskite with Pb–I defects, passivated with the zwitterion and the pristine one are plotted in Fig. 3b, respectively. The DOS values of pristine PbI2 are reversed to give a side-by-side comparison. In the case of the trap states of the perovskite, DFT reveals that the formation of deep traps was suppressed well after passivation, which has a similar effect to reported molecules.39,40,63

Cross-sectional SEM images of the thermally treated perovskite at 150 °C on (d) SnO2 and (e) Zw–SnO2, respectively. (f) XRD spectra of prepared perovskite films on SnO2 and Zw–SnO2, respectively. 
To validate the influence of suppressed trap states on perovskite stability, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was conducted for perovskite films on SnO2 and Zw–SnO2, respectively. The perovskite films were heated at 150 °C with time ranging from 5 min to 60 min in ambient air. The initial absorbance of the perovskite on Zw–SnO2 was higher than that on SnO2, probably owing to the improved surface coverage and perovskite film quality as shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†). As the heating time increased, the absorption intensities of both samples decreased (Fig. 3c), and the absorbance at 700 nm was normalized with an initial value to compare the thermal stability of each sample (Fig. S9, ESI†).64 It was found that the perovskite films on Zw–SnO2 maintained initial absorption better than those on SnO2, implying improved thermal stability.
The slowed perovskite degradation was further investigated using SEM measurement. As shown in Fig. 3d, e and Fig. S10 (ESI†), some species with relatively high contrast appeared on the cross-section of the perovskite films. Following a previous report, these species correspond to PbI2, which indicates the degree of degradation.65 The cross-sectional SEM images clearly confirm that the Zw–SnO2-based sample is much more slowly degraded as compared to the SnO2-based sample. Strikingly, the degradation of the perovskite is initiated at both the surface exposed to air and the ETL/perovskite interface (Fig. S10, ESI†). This suggests that controlling both surfaces of the perovskite is important to achieve highly stable devices.
The well-maintained perovskite film on the Zw–SnO2 ETL was also evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Fig. 3f).66 All samples exhibited typical peaks at 2θ = 14.1°, 28.4°, and 43.2°, which were assigned to the (110), (220), and (330) lattice planes of the perovskite crystal, respectively.10 When the perovskite films were heated at 150 °C for 10 min, the intensities of the typical peak at 2θ = 12.6°, corresponding to PbI2, increased in both the SnO2 and Zw–SnO2 samples.67 In particular, the PbI2 peak intensity of the sample using SnO2 was much higher than that of the sample using Zw–SnO2, confirming that the perovskite film on the SnO2 ETL decomposed much faster at high temperatures.66 These results are well consistent with the UV-vis absorption and SEM results.
P-PSCs with different zwitterion concentrations were fabricated to confirm the effects of the zwitterion on device performance. A mixed cation perovskite with doped Spiro-OMeTAD was prepared and employed following a reported method.23 A histogram of the P-PSCs employing different concentrations of the zwitterion is shown in Fig. 4a. The photovoltaic properties corresponding to champion devices of each zwitterion concentration are summarised in Table S3 (ESI†). The improved PCE compared to the control device can mainly be attributed to the increased open-circuit voltage (VOC) owing to the shift in the work function and suppressed back recombination.46 The statistics of VOC distribution of the devices with SnO2 and Zw–SnO2 are shown in Fig. 4b. The short-circuit current (JSC) of the devices tended to increase slightly up to 0.4 wt% because of suitable energy gaps and efficient charge extraction.20 Although the energy gap between the ETL and the perovskite decreased (Fig. 1e), our devices showed an increase in both VOC and JSC under optimised conditions. This tendency is well supported by a previous report,68 and Fig. 4c and d show the J−V curves for the champion devices using SnO2 and Zw–SnO2. The device with Zw–SnO2 had JSC = 23.2 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.14 V, FF = 78.8%, and it yielded a PCE of 20.91% in the reverse scan. This value is remarkably higher than that of the SnO2-based device (PCE = 19.63%). In addition, the proposed Zw–SnO2-based device exhibited considerably weaker hysteresis behaviour than the SnO2-based device due to the improved conductivity achieved by employing the zwitterion, implying well-matched charge balance.16 Maximum power point (MPP) tracking was performed to evaluate the stabilised power output (Fig. 4e).69 A bias of 0.85 V and 1.0 V was applied to the SnO2 and the Zw–SnO2-based device, respectively. The device yielded a stabilised PCE of 18.1% for SnO2 and 20.5% for Zw–SnO2. Moreover, both devices showed good photo-stability under 1 sun illumination without any encapsulation (Fig. S11, ESI†). For further optimisation, the zwitterion was introduced into CBD-SnO2-based devices.23 The champion device achieved a PCE of 21.43% with a weakened hysteresis characteristic (Fig. 4f), and the JSC value calculated from the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurement agreed well with the JSC value of the J−V curve (Fig. S12, ESI†). Detailed device performances are summarised in Table 1.

For further understanding the charge recombination and photovoltaic performance, the I−V characteristics were investigated under varying light intensities from 7 to 100 mW cm−2. Fig. S13 (ESI†) shows the log–log plot of JSC for various values of light intensity. The slope (α) of Zw–SnO2 is closer to 1 than that of the SnO2-based device, suggesting suppressed bimolecular recombination at the interface under short-circuit conditions.70Fig. 5a shows the FF dependence on light intensity. The increased FF at ∼0.5 suns indicates reduced recombination because of low concentrations of free charge carriers under low light intensity and the decreased FF is attributed to bimolecular recombination.71 Thus, a well-maintained FF of the Zw–SnO2-based device implies excellent charge transport properties. In addition, a larger slope (kT q−1) of VOCversus light intensity implies that trap-assisted recombination is involved.70 As shown in Fig. 5b, a slope of 1.25kT q−1 was estimated from the Zw–SnO2-based device, which is lower than that of the SnO2-based device (1.42kT q−1). Thus, the Zw–SnO2-based device has a lower level of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination owing to reduced trap states.72

(f) Nyquist plots of perovskite solar cells with SnO2 and Zw–SnO2 in the dark with a bias of VOC, respectively. 
Furthermore, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement was performed to confirm the trap densities of ETLs. The trap densities were calculated using the reported equation (see ESI†).68,73 The SnO2 device exhibited a trap density of 1.13 × 1016 cm−3, while the Zw–SnO2 devices showed trap densities of 9.38 × 1015 cm−3, 7.96 × 1015 cm−3, 1.00 × 1016 cm−3, and 1.11 × 1016 cm−3 (Fig. 5c). When the SnO2 surface was modified with the zwitterion, the trap densities of the devices decreased, but they increased again at high concentrations (>0.6 wt%). Since the film was not uniformly coated due to the low solubility of the zwitterion material, the trap density increased at high concentrations. As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), poor coverage of the zwitterion at high concentrations will affect the perovskite film formation, which influences the trap densities of the devices.73 These results agree with the device performances.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay were conducted to study the charge-transfer kinetics.20 The perovskite films were deposited on the FTO/ETL substrates, and the electrons of each sample were excited by illuminating the samples with a 474 nm light source. As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), the more efficient PL quenching of Zw–SnO2 indicates the improved electron extraction ability of the ETL. In addition, Fig. 5d shows the TRPL spectra of each sample, which was modified with different concentrations of the zwitterion. The PL decay constants were calculated using a bi-exponential equation (see ESI†), and the fitting results are summarised in Table S4 (ESI†). The fast component (τ1) of PL decay represents charge extraction.74 Compared to the SnO2-based device (τ1 = 8.44), the lifetime determined based on the fast decay traces of the Zw–SnO2-based device (0.4 wt%) was significantly short (τ1 = 5.86). These results imply that the zwitterion improved the electron extraction ability of SnO2 efficiently.
The interfacial properties between the ETL and the perovskite were investigated by conducting capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement. Samples corresponding to the FTO/ETL/perovskite/Au structure were prepared for the C–V measurement. In general, the flat-band potential and the doping density of a semiconductor can be estimated by performing Mott–Schottky analysis.75,76 The Mott–Schottky curve was plotted from the C–V data, and the x intercept of a straight-line in the curve provides the flat-band potential (Vfb) values. Because Spiro-OMeTAD was used as the HTL in both devices with SnO2 and Zw–SnO2, the VOC of devices is directly related to Vfb. In Fig. 5e, the Vfb value of the Zw–SnO2 sample is about 0.11 V higher than that of pristine SnO2 owing to interfacial dipoles of the zwitterion, which induce a higher VOC value.77 These results are in good agreement with the UPS data and device performance results. Furthermore, the doping density was calculated using the Mott–Schottky equation (see ESI†). As the zwitterion concentration increased, the doping density increased. Specific values of doping density are summarised in Table S5 (ESI†). The increased doping density in SnO2 could enhance the charge collection efficiency and reduce recombination due to the trap passivation effect.78
To obtain additional information about the electron transport process and interface resistance, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed.68 EIS was measured under dark conditions under a bias of VOC. Fig. 5f displays the Nyquist plots of devices with different ETLs. The equivalent circuit model is shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†). The series resistance (Rs) and contact resistance (Rco) correspond to the high-frequency element, and the recombination resistance (Rrec) is obtained from the low-frequency element in the Nyquist circle.79 The measured parameters from the equivalent circuit are summarised in Table S6 (ESI†). Both devices showed similar Rs values because they had the same structure, using Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL.68 Conversely, the Rrec value increased further when Zw–SnO2 was used as the ETL (from 133 Ω to 225 Ω). The higher Rrec value of the device using Zw–SnO2 indicates that the charge recombination was effectively suppressed, leading to an increase in VOC.79
Finally, the thermal stability of the SnO2 and Zw–SnO2-based devices, which were stabilised in the heating range from 50 °C to 300 °C for 10 min, was tested (Fig. 6a and Fig. S17, ESI†). The initial absolute PCEs for devices are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). The devices employing the Zw–SnO2 ETL maintained more than 90% of their initial efficiency, even after 10 min of heating at 150 °C, and Fig. 6b shows images of PSCs annealed at different temperatures. When the PSCs were heated at high temperatures, the perovskite films started to decompose into yellow PbI2. Furthermore, the yellow PbI2 appeared more quickly in the SnO2-based device compared to the Zw–SnO2-based device. This implies the improved thermal stability of the Zw–SnO2-based device since positively charged atoms could coordinate halide ions or PbI3− antisite defects.63 To understand the relation between the quantity of the zwitterion and thermal stability, the thermal stability of devices based on different concentrations of zwitterion was tested at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (Fig. S18, ESI†). Although PCEs of PSCs with high concentration (>0.6 wt%) of zwitterion were relatively lower than those under the 0.4 wt% condition, the thermal stability of PSCs increased with the concentration of zwitterion because of sufficient trap passivation.

J−V curves of devices with (e) Spiro-OMeTAD and (f) dopant-free asy-PBTBDT, respectively. 
It is well known that Spiro-OMeTAD with dopants is sensitive to moisture and thermal stress.80,81 Previously, our group reported dopant-free PSCs with asy-PBTBDT as the HTL using a green solvent, which exhibited high efficiency and stability.70,80 A 0.4 wt% concentration of zwitterion was chosen to fabricate a device with a dopant-free HTL in this study because the Zw–SnO2-based device with 0.4 wt% of zwitterion showed the highest efficiency with reasonable thermal stability. The device employing Zw–SnO2 and dopant-free asy-PBTBDT (Polymer_Zw–SnO2) exhibited JSC = 22.9 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.14 V, FF = 78.3%, and a PCE of 20.5%, which is a record high PCE among dopant-free polymeric HTLs using a green solvent (Fig. S19, ESI†).
Firstly, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to examine the thermal stability of the zwitterion under nitrogen flow from room temperature to 800 °C as shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†). There was no weight loss until 250 °C, which is higher than the operating temperature. For further evaluation of the thermal stability of Zw–SnO2-based devices, time-dependent thermal stability was tested under heating at 150 °C for devices of FTO/SnO2 or Zw–SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD or dopant-free asy-PBTBDT/Au structure (Fig. 6c). The Polymer_Zw–SnO2 device showed excellent thermal stability among all structures owing to slowed perovskite degradation and the absence of dopants.63,80,81 The efficiency of the Polymer_Zw–SnO2 device maintained ∼80% of its initial efficiency for 60 min. In addition, the long-term stability of unencapsulated PSCs was tested at approximately 25 °C, 25% relative humidity and 85 °C, 85% relative humidity. Under the mild condition (25 °C, 25% humidity), all devices maintained their initial efficiencies for over 50 days (Fig. S21, ESI†). By contrast, under the harsh condition (85 °C, 85% humidity), the efficiency difference began to increase sharply after 40 h (Fig. 6d). The main reason for the decrease in efficiency is expected to be the perovskite decomposition and the instability of doped Spiro-OMeTAD.80–84 The Polymer_Zw–SnO2 device retained ∼93% of its PCE after 140 h under the harsh condition, whereas the devices with Polymer_SnO2, Spiro_Zw–SnO2 and Spiro_SnO2 maintained 82%, 70%, and 43% of the initial PCE, respectively (Fig. 6e, f and Table S8, ESI†). Thus, the use of a zwitterion-modified ETL and a dopant-free HTL is a promising strategy for enhancing the thermal stability of P-PSCs with high efficiency.
Conclusions
We developed an effective and facile method to modify ETLs, and demonstrated highly stable and efficient P-PSCs, simultaneously, under a high temperature condition. A zwitterion, well-linked with SnO2, enhanced film coverage and perovskite crystal formation. In addition, the modified ETL showed desirable properties such as high conductivity, effective charge extraction and excellent recombination resistance owing to the dipoles by the zwitterion. In particular, this molecule passivates Pb–I antisite defects and reduces trap states of the perovskite. Thereby, the Zw–SnO2-based device exhibited much improved photovoltaic properties compared with the SnO2-based device. The optimised device yielded PCE values of 21.43%. Furthermore, a dopant-free polymeric HTL (asy-PBTBDT) was adopted to further improve the thermal stability of PSCs. The champion device achieved the highest efficiency of 20.5% among dopant-free polymeric HTLs using a green solvent. At the same time, the Zw–SnO2-based device with the dopant-free HTL showed excellent stability under 85 °C, 85% relative humidity conditions. This work suggests an effective strategy for the perovskite community to realize high-performance and stable P-PSCs.

Device fabrication
Perovskite solar cells were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass. Some parts of FTO were etched with 2 M HCl solution and zinc powder. The FTO was cleaned using deionized water, EtOH, Ace, and IPA. Then, UV ozone treatment was done for 15 min to remove the organic residues. A 40 nm thick SnO2 electron transport layer was deposited by the following method. A solution of 0.1 M Sn(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O) in EtOH was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The SnO2 layer was annealed at 200 °C for 30 min. For Zw–SnO2, the zwitterion was coated on SnO2 at 5000 rpm for 60 s by using different concentrations of solutions (0.2–0.8 wt% in MeOH) and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared from a 95% solution mixture of FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbBr2 (0.22 M) in DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (v:v) and 5% CsI solution (1.5 M) in DMSO, and spin-coated in a two-step program at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second step, 150 μL of CB was poured on the substrate 5 s prior to the end of the program. The substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution containing 72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 27.8 μL tBP, 17.8 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in AN), and 2 mg FK209 in 1 mL CB was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The polymer HTL in 2-MA (15 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the perovskite using the same method. Finally, a silver or gold electrode (100 nm) was thermally evaporated under high vacuum conditions.

Broader context
Tin oxide (SnO2) is a promising material for the electron transport layer in planar perovskite solar cells (P-PSCs) due to its suitable energy level and high electron mobility. SnO2-based P-PSCs show the highest power conversion efficiency among planar structure devices, but the PCE remains still low compared to the mesoporous TiO2-based PSCs and there is a lack of thermal stability study. Thermal instability definitely originates from the instability of organic hybrid perovskites. Therefore, all-inorganic hybrid perovskites are developed, achieving thermal stability, but the highest efficiency reaches only ca. 13%. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate high thermal stability and efficiency for P-PSCs, simultaneously, by employing modified SnO2 and a dopant-free polymer. The modified SnO2 shows high conductivity, effective charge extraction ability and high recombination resistance. Empirically, efficiencies of 21.43% and 20.5% were reached for devices with doped Spiro-OMeTAD and with dopant-free asy-PBTBDT, respectively, in the present study. The devices with modified SnO2 show excellent stability under mild (humidity of 25%) and harsh conditions (humidity of 85%; temperature of 85 °C). Thus, our newly developed method guarantees highly efficient and thermally stable P-PSCs.
