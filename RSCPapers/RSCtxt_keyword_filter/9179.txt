    , Accepted 3rd May 2020First published on 4th May 2020AbstractThe inorganic halide perovskite CsPbI3 has shown great promise in efficient solar cells. However, α-phase CsPbI3 is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature, limiting its applications. Herein, we have successfully fabricated highly stable all-inorganic 0D/3D Cs4Pb(IBr)6/CsPbI3−xBrx mixed-dimensional perovskite solar cells. The 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase spontaneously distributes in the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite phase and facilitates the (100) preferential crystal orientation of the CsPbI3−xBrx crystals. Due to the reasonable energy level alignment and lattice match between (040) in 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and (002) in 3D CsPbI3−xBrx crystals, a 0D–3D heterojunction structure formed. The defect passivation and non-radiative recombination suppression within the films effectively promote smooth carrier transport in the perovskite solar cells, boosting the efficiency to 14.77%. The devices retained 93.9% of the initial efficiency after 60 days in a nitrogen atmosphere. Moreover, a high efficiency of 10.52% has also been achieved in the 1 cm2-large solar cells due to the high uniformity and repeatability of the 0D/3D films.
Introduction
Halide perovskite materials such as CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) or NH2CH = NHPbI3 (FAPbI3) are some of the most promising absorbers for solar cells due to their excellent photoelectric properties.1,2 Typically, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2%.3–7 However, the weak hydrogen bonding between organic cations and the inorganic (PbX6)4− octahedron skeleton frame results in the intrinsic thermal instability of MAPbI3 or FAPbI3 PSCs, which severely limits further commercialization.8–10 An alternative approach is to replace the organic cations with inorganic Cs+ to improve the thermal stability while maintaining the photoelectric performance of PSCs.11,12
Cesium lead halide PSCs have attracted considerable attention due to their suitable bandgap, excellent charge-carrier mobilities and high thermal stabilities.13–15 Among them, CsPbI3 exhibits a bandgap of Eg = 1.73 eV, which makes it particularly suitable for solar energy conversion. Many efforts have been devoted to optimizing the film composition, device architectures, and fabrication processes of PSCs.16–20 Liu et al.16 optimized the Br content in CsPbI3−xBrx to reduce large energy losses and achieved a PCE of 17.17%. You et al.21 utilized lithium fluoride as an insulated shunt-blocking layer to effectively passivate the defects at CsPbX3 interfaces, significantly improving PCE to 18.64%. Zhao et al.22 introduced a dimethyl ammonium iodide additive into the precursor solution and utilized phenyltrimethylammonium chloride as the passivation layer to prepare a high-quality CsPbI3 film that achieved the record champion efficiency of 19.03% for all-inorganic PSCs. However, the desired α-CsPbI3 phase could spontaneously convert to the non-perovskite phase even at room temperature due to its thermodynamic metastable characteristics, which would further decrease the performance of the PSCs.15 Previous studies have offered a range of solutions to solve the phase stability issue. For instance, the partial substitution of iodine with bromide was explored to tune the tolerance factor to a more suitable value.23–25 It has been reported that decreasing the CsPbI3 grain size by using HI additives or quantum dot approaches could reduce the Gibbs free energy of the cubic phase, thereby improving the moisture stability.26–28 Nevertheless, the decrease of the grain size was always accompanied by an increase of undesirable defects in the films.26 Therefore, it is highly desirable to explore more effective strategies to simultaneously improve the thermodynamic stability and photoelectric performance of PSCs.
Constructing a mixed-dimensional structure in films has been proven to be one of the most effective strategies to fabricate stable and high-performance PSCs.27,28 Snaith et al.24 successfully fabricated a 2D (two dimension)/3D (three dimension) heterostructure by incorporating butylammonium into cesium-formamidinium lead halide perovskites. Due to the high crystallinity, good band alignments and high stability, the 2D/3D heterojunctions effectively suppressed the non-radiative recombination and enhanced the photoelectric performance and environmental stability of the PSCs. Moreover, the addition of larger organic molecules such as phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) into the CsPbI3 perovskite is another effective way to improve the moisture stability of all-inorganic perovskites. Liu et al.29 fabricated 2D/3D PEA2−xCsxPbI4 films by partly substituting Cs+ with large PEA+ cations in CsPbI3. However, the efficiency of the PEA+-modified 2D/3D PSCs was still not satisfactory (less than 13%). On the other hand, the sublimation temperature of PEAI is less than 300 °C, which substantially limited the thermal stability of the devices.30 Therefore, we believe that an all-inorganic mixed-dimensional film might be one of the most promising candidates to improve the environmental stability of PSCs.31 The zero-dimensional (0D) Cs4PbX6 (X = Cl, Br, or I) exhibits improved environmental stability under extreme conditions due to the elimination of larger organic molecules.32 With the same [PbX6]4 octahedra as CsPbX3, Cs4PbX6 also has a good lattice match with CsPbX3.33 In 2017, Sargent's group34 first reported the surface passivation effect of Cs4PbBr6 on CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, and up to a 90% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was achieved. Since then, CsPbX3/Cs4PbX6, and especially CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 composites, has been extensively studied.25,35–37 Sun et al.25 reported a near-unity PLQY of 95% in a CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 system prepared in the mixed solvents of water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cs4PbBr6 can not only passivate the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals through their good lattice match but also contribute to a higher stability of the hybrid material system.25 The above studies demonstrated the high potential of Cs4PbX6 in photoelectric fields. Although great improvements have been achieved in terms of the light-emitting properties of Cs4PbX6, the amount of research on its application in all-inorganic PSCs is limited. One plausible reason is the large band gap of 3.2 eV of 0D Cs4PbX6, which is unsuitable for solar cell absorbers.38 Fortunately, the CsPbX3/Cs4PbX6 heterojunction possesses a type I band alignment that is similar to that of the most commonly reported 2D–3D hybrid perovskites.24,39 We believe that if the structural advantages and energy band alignments of both 0D Cs4PbX6 and 3D CsPbX3 could be reasonably coordinated, it would provide an enhanced thermal stability and moisture stability for all-inorganic perovskite solar cells. Recently, Jen and co-workers40 fabricated a 0D Cs4PbI6 and 3D γ-CsPbI3 heterostructure. They speculated that the 0D Cs4PbI6 might be distributed around γ-CsPbI3 grain boundaries and act as a molecular lock to improve the phase stability of 3D CsPbI3. However, how the two absolutely different crystals coexist and how the 0D/3D structure affects the phase stability and photoelectrical properties of the films are still ambiguous. Considering the promising applications of 0D Cs4PbX6 in both light-emitting and photovoltaic devices, it is extremely urgent to find direct evidence to reveal the coexistence states of the 0D/3D Cs4PbX6/CsPbX3 crystals and to further study the effect of the 0D phases on the crystal growth, environmental stability, carrier transport and photoelectrical performance of the 3D CsPbI3.
Inspired by these recent findings, all-inorganic 0D/3D Cs4Pb(IBr)6/CsPbI3−xBrx mixed-dimensional films with improved stability have been successfully fabricated herein by carefully controlling the Cs+/Pb2+ ratios in precursor solutions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results well demonstrated the coexistence of the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and 3D α-CsPbI3−xBrx phases in the films. Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements were used to study the existence states of Cs4Pb(IBr)6. EBSD directly revealed that the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 grains were spontaneously dispersed among the grain boundaries of the cubic CsPbI3−xBrx. Both the XRD and EBSD results indicated that the introduction of the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 facilitated the crystal orientation of the CsPbI3−xBrx (100) planes, which further favored vertical carrier transport in the PSCs. The (040)0D//(002)3D interface observed in the HRTEM images clearly demonstrated the smooth transition region from the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 to the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx. Due to the reasonable energy level alignment and lattice match, the 0D/3D heterojunction structure formed in the films, which effectively facilitated carrier transport and photoconductive gain. As a result, the PSCs based on the 0D/3D heterojunctions showed an improved PCE of 14.77%, with an obviously improved Jsc of 16.56 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V, and a FF of 80.32%. Moreover, due to the uniform quality of the 0D/3D films, a large-area (1 cm2) PSC with a high PCE of 10.52% was achieved. In addition, the PSCs based on the 0D/3D film show an obviously enhanced stability, and 93.9% of the PCE was retained after 60 days of storage in a nitrogen atmosphere.
Results and discussion
A series of 0D/3D Cs4Pb(IBr)6/CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite films was fabricated by tuning the Cs+/Pb2+ ratios from 1 to 1.7. This fabrication was accomplished by increasing the CsI concentration from 0.5 M to 1.2 M in precursor solutions (PbI2 and CsBr concentrations were fixed at 1 M and 0.5 M, respectively). For simplicity, the film samples fabricated with various y M CsI + 1.0 M PbI2 + 0.5 M CsBr (y = 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2) precursors are denoted as “y-CsI” films. The fabrication processes of the all-inorganic Cs4Pb(IBr)6/CsPbI3−xBrx films are schematically shown in Fig. 1a. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1b) of the y-CsI films confirm typical (100), (110) and (200) peaks at 2θ = ∼14°, ∼21° and ∼29°, respectively, of the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite phase. As the Cs+/Pb2+ ratio increases to 1.3 (y = 0.8), (110), (012), (300) and (312) peaks of the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase can be detected in the pattern of the 0.8-CsI film (Fig. 1c), demonstrating the formation of the Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase. Interestingly, accompanying the formation of the Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase, the intensity of the CsPbI3−xBrx (100) and (200) peaks gradually increases, while that of the (110) peak decreases (Fig. 1b). The increase of the relative intensity ratio value of (200)/(110) for the y-CsI films (Fig. 1d) indicates the preferred (h00) growth orientation of CsPbI3−xBrx crystals. In addition, the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (200) peak decreases from 0.214° for the 0.5-CsI control film to 0.180° for the 1.0-CsI film (Fig. S1a, ESI†). The calculated lattice parameters of CsPbI3−xBrx and Cs4Pb(IBr)6 are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), and the relationship of the lattice parameters with the y value is illustrated in Fig. S1b (ESI†). The increase of the lattice parameters might be due to the replacement of Br− ions by larger I− ions. A similar increase of lattice parameters is also observed in the Cs4Pb(IBr)6 crystal.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 2a) of the 0.5-CsI control film shows a poor coverage surface, and many large pores could be observed. As y increased from 0.5 to 0.6, many brighter grains can be observed, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which indicates the formation of a second phase in the films. It is known that a higher brightness in SEM bright-field images always results from a stronger electron scattering, which is possibly related to the new second phase.41 As y increased from 0.6 to 1.0, the morphology of the films is strongly improved, and the bright color region of the second phase also increases (Fig. S2, ESI†). Typically, the SEM image (Fig. 2e) of the 1.0-CsI film shows a uniform and dense crystalline microstructure with a grain size of 500–1000 nm. The SEM cross-sectional image shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) confirms the island-like microstructure with pores in the 0.5-CsI control films, which may cause a high current leakage in the PSCs.42 The 1.0-CsI film shows very dense columnar crystal structures, and the bright white second phase grew from the substrate to the top of the film (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Correlated electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements were conducted to further determine the crystal distribution in the films. The EBSD measurement uses Kikuchi patterns to assign the crystalline phase and derive the orientation of the corresponding crystals. Fig. 2b and f illustrate the EBSD phase maps for the 0.5-CsI (3D) and 1.0-CsI (0D/3D) films, respectively. In Fig. 2b, only the single CsPbI3−xBrx crystal phase (denoted in yellow color) is detected. In the 1.0-CsI films, two crystal phases are observed (shown in Fig. 2f). The 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase (blue color) is distributed among the main 3D CsPbI3−xBrx phase (yellow color), which is correlated to the distribution of the brighter crystals in Fig. 2e. In addition, the selected CsPbI3−xBrx grains in the 0.5-CsI and 1.0-CsI films are colored according to their crystallographic orientation as determined by the EBSD measurements. The color key (shown as the inset between Fig. 2c and g) represents the changes of the crystal orientations. Red, green, and blue colors represent the (001), (101), and (111) planes of the CsPbI3−xBrx crystals, respectively. Random crystal orientations are observed in the 0.5-CsI film (Fig. 2c). However, the dominant (001) orientation (the same as the (100) orientation observed in the XRD patterns) of the cubic CsPbI3−xBrx crystals is detected in the 1.0-CsI film (Fig. 2g), which is consistent with the XRD results shown in Fig. 1a. The (001) orientation of the CsPbI3−xBrx crystals has been improved by the introduction of the Cs4Pb(IBr)6 crystal phase. Scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) was also used to further measure the phase distributions in the films based on the light scattering intensity by different crystal phases.43 There is no obvious contrast in the SNOM image (Fig. 2d) of the 0.5-CsI film, which further confirms the single phase structure of the film. Obviously, there are different phases in the 1.0-CsI film. The grains in orange color belong to the main CsPbI3−xBrx crystal phase, while the dark red grains belong to the Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase (Fig. 2h).
Furthermore, the corresponding pole figures obtained from the EBSD measurements for the 0.5-CsI and 1.0-CsI films are depicted in Fig. 2i and j, respectively. The pole figures provide more evidence for the distribution of the crystal orientations. The random textures shown in the pole figures of the 0.5-CsI film indicate the random distribution of the crystal orientations (Fig. 2i). However, a high intensity along the equatorial circumference in the (100) pole figure of the 1.0-CsI film is observed, suggesting the preferred orientation along the (100) planes of the cubic CsPbI3−xBrx (Fig. 2j) crystals. Moreover, multiple uniform distributions (MUDs) shown in Fig. 2i and j were employed to display the (100) orientation of the cubic CsPbI3−xBrx phases, which are illustrated by the right color bars. The MUD value of the 1.0-CsI film is 23.31, which is much larger than that of the 0.5-CsI film (14.11), and this result also indicates the preferred (100) orientation of the cubic CsPbI3−xBrx phase. It is thus speculated that the introduction of the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase can facilitate the crystallization and preferred orientation of the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx phase and ultimately improve the uniformity and film quality. The preferred orientation of perovskite crystals has been proven to be a major favorable factor in favoring vertical carrier transport in PSCs.44
Crystal lattice structures were further observed by using HRTEM (Fig. 3). The regular lattice fringes shown in Fig. 3a indicate the single crystal nature of the CsPbI3−xBrx (y = 0.5) control film. The d-spacing of the lattice fringes is 4.3 Å, which corresponds to the (110) plane of the cubic CsPbI3−xBrx phase. Two different types of lattice fringes can be clearly observed in the HRTEM images (Fig. 3c and d) of the 0D/3D 1.0-CsI film. It is known that 3D CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite crystallizes in the cubic space group of Pm3m with the unit cell parameters of a = b = c and α = β = γ = 90°.45 The lattice fringes in the right region of Fig. 3d with a d-spacing of 3.06 Å are perpendicular to each other with an angle of 90°, corresponding to the (002) and (020) planes of the cubic CsPbI3−xBrx. The 0D Cs4PbX6 perovskite crystallizes in the hexagonal space group of R3c with the unit cell parameters of a = b ≠ c, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°.46 The lattice fringes on the left side of Fig. 3d perfectly exhibit a hexagonal shape with an angle of 120°. The measured d-spacing of both lattice fringes is 3.1 Å, consistent with the (040) and (400) planes of the hexagonal Cs4Pb(IBr)6. The brown rectangle illustrated in Fig. 3d indicates a smooth transition region from the 0D (040) plane to the 3D (002) plane. Fig. 3e schematically illustrates the CsPbI3−xBrx and Cs4Pb(IBr)6 crystal structures. The d-spacing of the (002) plane for CsPbI3−xBrx is quite close to that of the (040) plane of Cs4Pb(IBr)6. The lattice misfit value (δ = (d(040)0D–d(002)3D)/d(002)3D) of the (040)//(002) interface for Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and CsPbI3−xBrx was calculated to be only 1.3%.47 The small difference in the d-spacing indicates a small interfacial energy.47 According to the semi-coherent dislocation theory, when two crystal structures are in contact with each other, the smaller the interfacial energy between them, the easier it is for one phase to nucleate on the other phase.48 If the heterostructures possess good lattice matching characteristics, the interface with a low interfacial energy can reduce the activation energy barrier and become an effective nucleation site.49,50 Therefore, the Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and CsPbI3−xBrx crystals can be connected by the (040)0D//(002)3D interface to lower the interfacial energy, as shown in Fig. 3f. Once nucleation sites for the interface are established, the crystal growth of α-CsPbI3−xBrx can be strongly affected by the Cs4Pb(IBr)6 crystals. We speculate that during the crystal growth process, the (110) or (111) planes of the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx crystals are gradually “anchored” by the 0D crystals, as illustrated in Fig. 3g. Due to the crystalline nature of cubic crystals, the (100), (010), and (001) planes are identical to some extent. Therefore, the “anchored” 3D CsPbI3−xBrx crystals grow along the (100) crystal planes, ultimately affecting the crystal orientation of the entire film.

The binding energy of the films was detected by XPS (Fig. S4, ESI†). For the control 3D 0.5-CsI film, the binding energies of Cs3d and Pb4f are 724.2 eV (3d5/2) and 738.2 eV (3d3/2), and 138.0 eV (4f7/2) and 142.8 eV (4f5/2), respectively. As the CsI content increases, the binding energy of Cs3d and Pb4f is shifted toward a lower region, which indicates the formation of the 0D Cs4PbX6.25 To understand how the formation of the 0D Cs4PbX6 phase promotes the crystallinity and orientation of perovskite grains in the 3D phase, the crystal growth process of the 1.0-CsI film during annealing was monitored. SEM images (Fig. S5a–c, ESI†) of the 1.0-CsI films show that the brighter region, which might be associated with the formation of the 0D phase, expands as the annealing time increases. The XRD patterns (Fig. S5d and e, ESI†) show that the typical characteristic peaks of the CsPbI3−xBrx and Cs4Pb(IBr)6 crystal phases appear simultaneously at an annealing time of 20 s, and the intensity of the (100) and (200) peaks of CsPbI3−xBrx increases as the annealing time increases to 60 s. The intensity ratios of I(200)/I(110) increase rapidly in the first 40 s and then tend to be saturated after 60 s (Fig. S5f, ESI†), which indicates that the preferred orientation of the (h00) plane of the CsPbI3−xBrx crystals occurs at the same time as the formation of the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 crystal phase. Furthermore, the role of excessive Cs+ in the precursor was further verified by replacing CsI with CsBr to form y-CsBr films, and similar results can be observed in Fig. S6 (ESI†).
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the y-CsI films are shown in Fig. 4a. As y increases from 0.5 to 1.2, the band gap of the main CsPbI3−x3−xBrx phase decreases from 1.82 to 1.79 eV, which can be attributed to the incorporation of more I− ions into the CsPbI3−xBrx lattices.15 Typically, a new absorption peak appears for the 1.0-CsI film, and the band edge at 387 nm belonging to the Cs4PbX6 phase with a bandgap of 3.20 eV is shown in Fig. 4a. Moreover, an exciton absorption peak near 600 nm is observed in the 1.0-CsI film. Similar exciton absorption peaks are also observed in Fig. S7 (ESI†) for the y-CsBr films. Thus, we believe that the new exciton absorption peaks are closely related to the quantum confinement effect with the formation of 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6.51 As y increases from 0.5 to 1.2, the band edge blue shifts from 680 to 691 nm in the PL spectra shown in Fig. 4b, which is consistent with the similar blue shift observed in the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the intensity of the photoluminescence (PL) peaks significantly increases as y increases because the introduction of 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 effectively improved the CsPbI3−xBrx crystallinity and reduced the crystal defects. To further confirm the passivation of defects by the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 in the 0D/3D perovskite films, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectral decay measurements were carried out (Fig. 4c), and the fitting parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The average electron lifetime of 4.291 ns of the pristine 3D control film is prolonged to 8.696 ns in the 0D/3D film, indicating the limitation of the non-radiative recombination. Cs4Pb(IBr)6 can share the same (PbX6)4− octahedron with CsPbI3−xBrx and form heterostructures due to the perfect lattice match (as proven by the HRTEM in Fig. 3d). It is known that lattice-matched heterostructures favor the passivation of defects along grain boundaries and prevent the formation of carrier traps.34 Therefore, the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase plays a crucial role in facilitating the passivation of defects and further suppressing the non-radiative recombination within the 0D/3D interface.

The surface potential for the 0.5-CsI and 1.0-CsI films was measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The topography (Fig. S8, ESI†) of the 1.0-CsI film shows a very dense and smooth surface morphology with a roughness of 255 nm, which is much smaller than the value of 629 nm obtained from the 0.5-CsI film. The crystal grain size of the 1.0-CsI film is in the range of 500–1000 nm, which is similar to the SEM results shown in Fig. 2e. The 0.5-CsI film shows a consistent distribution of the surface potential in the film surface (Fig. 4d), while the 1.0-CsI film shows a very different surface potential distribution (Fig. 4f). The vertical and horizontal surface potential profiles were mapped and are shown in Fig. 4e and g. Compared with the 0.5-CsI film, a surface potential difference of ∼90 mV is detected for the 1.0-CsI film. The potential distribution difference of the 1.0-CsI film indicates different Fermi levels between the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and 3D CsPbI3−xBrx phases, which provides direct evidence for the construction of heterojunctions in the 1.0-CsI film. To determine the exact band alignment between 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and 3D CsPbI3−xBrx, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed, as illustrated in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) for Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and CsPbI3−xBrx are presented in Fig. 4h. The Cs4Pb(IBr)6/CsPbI3−xBrx heterojunction with its “spike-like” offset can be classified as a type I heterojunction. As illustrated in Fig. 4i, electron–hole pairs can be generated in the CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite phase upon light illumination. However, for Cs4PbX6, because (PbX6)4− octahedra are no longer corner-shared, photoexcited carriers in these materials experience a much stronger quantum confinement than in CsPbX3, which is not conducive to carrier transport. Since the bandgaps of the 0D phases are wider than that of the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx phase, both electrons and holes are confined in the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx phase. The electronic configuration across the 0D/3D heterojunction may be similar to that of the previously reported 2D/3D perovskites.24 When charges reach the interface from within the 3D grain, they will be reflected and remain in the 3D perovskite. Due to the perfect lattice match demonstrated by the HRTEM results, the electrons and holes would not suffer from trapping and recombination at the grain boundaries, which plays a vital role in facilitating the carrier transport.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the y-CsI films, PSCs were fabricated based on typical planar heterojunction structures. The PSC based on the 3D 0.5-CsI control film shows a PCE of 4.64%, a voltage (Voc) of 0.72 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.57 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 60.96%. The control 3D film with many pinholes has poor coverage, resulting in contact between the hole and the electron transport materials, which further leads to a decrease in solar cell performance due to leakage current. With more and more 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 crystal phase introduced in the y-CsI films, the PCE of the PSCs is significantly improved (Fig. 5a, Table S3 and Fig. S10, ESI†). The statistical results of the PCE of the y-CsI PSCs are depicted in Fig. 5b. The PSCs with 0D/3D heterojunctions in the 1.0-CsI film outperform the others and exhibit the highest PCE of 14.77% with a Jsc of 16.56 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V, and a FF of 80.32%. For the 0D/3D films, the formation of a smooth and continuous film surface can minimize the leakage current of the device, thereby improving device performance, especially leading to the higher Jsc and FF. Meanwhile, as defects are known to form at the grain boundaries, films with large grains can effectively reduce the volume of the grain boundaries, which is also the reason for the improved performance of OD/3D PSCs.52 Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 5c) illustrate that the integrated current density of the y-CsI films well matches the current density measured from the J–V curves. A strong light absorption at ∼400 nm is observed in the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. 4a) of the y-CsI films with y > 0.8, but the IPCE at the same wavelength shows a gradually decreasing photoelectric conversion efficiency, which indicates that Cs4Pb(IBr)6 itself does not contribute to the photocurrent. However, with the improvement of the film quality and the facilitation of carrier transport by the introduction of the Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase, the overall IPCE value is significantly improved. Both the XRD and EBSD results demonstrate that the main CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite crystals exhibit a preferred orientation along the (100) planes in the y-CsI films. The preferred orientation of perovskite crystals has been proven to facilitate carrier transport by efficiently extracting them between two PSC electrodes.44 For randomly oriented perovskite structures in the 3D film, there is no direct path for charge transfer to the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transport layer (HTL),53 as illustrated in Fig. S11 (ESI†). With vertical stacking of perovskite crystals, as depicted in Fig. 5d, electrons and holes in the 0D/3D film can be effectively separated to the ETL and the HTL through the (h00) planes of the cubic CsPbI3−xBrx, respectively. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that the introduction of the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 crystal phase plays a key role in facilitating the carrier transport in the PSCs. In addition, the gradually increasing photocurrent at ∼600 nm is closely related to the photoconductive gain that results from the configuration of the 0D/3D heterojunctions in the y-CsI films. Furthermore, the y-CsBr films were also fabricated by replacing CsI with CsBr, and similarly enhanced PCE and photocurrent values were also observed as the y value of the CsBr content increased (Fig. S12, ESI†). To gain further insight into the performance increase for the PSCs with the 0D/3D heterostructure, transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were performed (Fig. 5e). The PSC with the 0D/3D heterostructure 1.0-CsI film exhibits a much slower Voc decay process, with a lifetime of 2.06 ms compared to 0.14 ms for the PSC with the 3D 0.5-CsI film. These results further support that the trap-assisted recombination is suppressed by the construction of the 0D/3D heterostructures. Moreover, VTFL (trap-filled limit voltage) decreases from 1.02 V to 0.32 V, indicating the remarkable trap density reduction achieved by the introduction of the 0D phase (Fig. 5f), which is consistent with the PL (Fig. 4b) and TRPL (Fig. 4c) results.

The stability of the PSCs based on the y-CsI films was evaluated. After 60 days of storage in a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature, the PCE of the 0D/3D PSCs was still 93.9% of its initial efficiency (Fig. 5g). However, the 3D control PSCs degraded dramatically to below 20% of their initial efficiency within 30 days. The results prove that the 0D/3D heterostructures significantly improve the stability of the PSCs. In addition, the unencapsulated PSCs with 0D/3D heterojunctions showed comparable stability in an ambient atmosphere with 40 ± 5% relative humidity (RH), and the PCE retained 70.2% of its initial efficiency after 12 h of exposure, as depicted in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The PCE of the control PSCs degraded to only 23.7% of the initial PCE within 4 h under the same conditions. There are two main reasons for the stability improvement of the 0D/3D PSCs induced by the introduction of the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6. Firstly, 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 itself has excellent stability and contributes to the overall stabilization of the perovskite materials. 0D Cs4PbX6 with its unique structure, showing isolated [PbX6]4− octahedra, has been proven to have long-term stability when stored under environmental conditions for more than one year.54 On the other hand, due to the perfect lattice match between the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and 3D CsPbI3−xBrx, the 3D phases can be anchored by the 0D phases, as demonstrated by the HRTEM results. The clean (040)0D//(002)3D interface between Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and CsPbI3−xBrx crystals indicated that the defects within the interfaces can be effectively passivated. It was also proved that a perfect lattice matching system has better stability than a lattice mismatched system.55 For the lattice mismatched systems, the interfaces may act as defect centers, thereby reducing the stability of the film. Moreover, in the presence of a large density of defects between the interfaces, the free-energy barrier to nucleation can be lowered, inducing the transition of α-CsPbI3−xBrx to non-perovskite δ-CsPbI3−xBrx.49 Therefore, the undesirable non-perovskite δ-phases can be suppressed due to the lattice matched nature between 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 and 3D α-CsPbI3−xBrx.
Furthermore, to verify the quality and uniformity of the 1.0-CsI films, large PSCs with an effective area of 1 cm2 were fabricated, and a high PCE of 10.52% was achieved, as shown in Fig. 5h. The statistical results shown in Fig. 5i confirm the large-scale uniformity of the 1.0-CsI films and the excellent reproducibility of the PSCs.
Conclusions
We have successfully fabricated all-inorganic 0D/3D mixed-dimensional Cs4Pb(IBr)6–CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite films by tuning the Cs+/Pb2+ ratios through increasing the CsI concentration y in the precursors. The introduction of the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 played a key role in optimizing the film morphology and crystallinity, thereby significantly improving the film quality and device performance. Moreover, the 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 phase is distributed among the main 3D CsPbI3−xBrx phases and plays a vital role in promoting the growth of the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx crystals with the preferred (100) plane orientation. Due to the heterojunctions between the 0D and 3D crystals with a good lattice match and less crystal defects passivated by the 0D/3D heterostructures, non-radiation recombination in the 0D/3D film is effectively suppressed, and carrier transport in the PSCs is improved. As a result, the PSCs based on the all-inorganic 0D/3D Cs4Pb(IBr)6/CsPbI3−xBrx films achieve an efficiency of 14.77% that is two times higher than the value of 4.64% obtained from the control PSCs with the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite films. The all-inorganic Cs4Pb(IBr)6/CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite films exhibit excellent stability, and 93.9% of the initial PCE can be retained even after 60 days of storage in a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. Due to the large-scale uniformity of the 1.0-CsI films and the excellent reproducibility of the PSCs, large-area PCSs with an effective area of 1 cm2 based on the 1.0-CsI film obtained a high PCE of 10.52%. Our findings not only pave the way to fabricate all-inorganic perovskite solar cells with a high conversion efficiency and excellent stability but they also provide direct evidence to understand the intrinsic properties of the 0D Cs4PbX6 phase to explore more potential applications with the incorporation of this 0D crystal phase.
Experimental procedures
Fabrication of the films
Typically, the precursor for the 3D CsPbI3−xBrx control film was prepared by dissolving 1.0 M PbI2 (ALFA), 0.5 M CsI (ACROS) and 0.5 M CsBr (ALFA) in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent (ALFA). A series of 0D/3D Cs4Pb(IBr)6/CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite films was fabricated by tuning the Cs+/Pb2+ ratios from 1 to 1.7 through increasing the CsI concentration from 0.5 M to 1.2 M in the precursor solutions (the PbI2 and CsBr concentrations were fixed at 1 M and 0.5 M, respectively). For simplicity, the film samples fabricated with various y M CsI + 1.0 M PbI2 + 0.5 M CsBr (y = 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2) precursors are denoted as “y-CsI” films. For the “y-CsBr” films shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the CsBr concentration y was increased from 0.1 M to 0.7 M, with the concentrations of PbI2 and CsI fixed at 1.0 M and 1.0 M, respectively. The glass (or FTO for PSCs) substrates were washed sequentially with potassium dichromate, distilled water, and ethanol and then treated with UV ozone for 20 minutes. Glass substrates were preheated at 105 °C, then the precursors were spin-coated onto the hot glass substrates at a speed of 2500 rpm for 35 s, and the samples were annealed at 325 °C for 10 min. For the films shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the annealing time was controlled from 20 s to 15 min.
Solar cell device fabrication
A TiO2 sol precursor was prepared by dissolving 0.6 mL of isopropyl titanate and 0.4 mL of acetylacetone in 7 mL of isopropanol. The TiO2 sol precursor was sprayed onto clean FTO glass followed by annealing at 460 °C for 2 minutes, and then a uniform and dense TiO2 layer was deposited onto the FTO substrate. The y-CsI perovskite films were coated on the TiO2-coated FTO glass by the spin-coating processes described above. Subsequently, Spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the y-CsI perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was obtained by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene mixed with 28.8 μL of tert-butylpyridine, 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt dissolved in acetonitrile), and 8 μL of FK209-cobalt(III)-TFSI solution (300 mg mL−1 FK209-cobalt(III)-TFSI in acetonitrile). Finally, a 65 nm-thick gold layer was deposited by thermal evaporation on the PSCS as the top electrode.
Characterization methods
X-ray diffraction analysis was performed using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer under Cu-Kα radiation (1.5418 Å). The morphologies and microstructures of the y-CsI perovskite films were observed by using a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope and a Philips Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope running at 200 kV. Electron backscatter diffraction Kikuchi patterns were detected by using an Oxford NordlysMax3 detector and analyzed using ATex software. To prepare the TEM samples for observation, the y-CsI films scraped from the substrate were dispersed in acetone under sonication and then deposited on a copper mesh with an amorphous carbon support. To avoid damage by the electron beam, all TEM images were recorded in less than 10 seconds. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra were collected with a bias voltage of −10 V using a Thermo Scientific ESCALab250Xi system. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were recorded using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Varian). Steady-state PL spectra were obtained at room temperature using a steady-state fluorescent spectrophotometer (Varian Cary Eclipse) with an excitation wavelength of 468 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the y-CsI films were measured with an excitation wavelength of 450nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (HORIBA JY Nanolog-TCSPC). For the PL and TRPL measurements, the films were deposited on glass substrates. Kelvin probe force microscopy was measured in tapping mode using a Bruker multimode atomic force microscope. Density functional theory calculations were performed by Cambridge serial total energy package (CASTEP) code, in which a plane wave basis set was used. Exchange and correlation interactions were modeled using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functions. The norm-conserving pseudopotential was used with a cutoff energy of 750 eV. Geometric convergence tolerances were set for a maximum force of 0.03 eV Å−1, a maximum energy change of 10−5 eV per atom, a maximum displacement of 0.001 Å and a maximum stress of 0.05 GPa. Density mixing electronic minimization was implemented, and the self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance was set to ‘‘fine’’ with a high accuracy of 10−6 eV per atom for energy convergence. The J–V curves were measured under AM 1.5 illumination using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency was measured in air using a QE-R measurement system (Enli Technology). TPV results were obtained by using a multifunctional electrochemical analysis instrument (Zahner, Germany).
