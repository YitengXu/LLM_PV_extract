    , Accepted 1st March 2018First published on 3rd March 2018AbstractThe interface strategy has been identified as an effective process to optimize the overall performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, three novel non-conjugated small molecules comprising amino cations and sulfonate anions, as well as various core atoms of oxygen, sulfur, and sulfone, were successfully synthesized and employed as cathode interlayers (CILs) for non-fullerene PSCs. A large improvement of the device performance was observed, in which the solution processed sulfur-based CIL shows excellent cathode modification ability and device properties with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.30%. Compared with the vacuum deposited Ca, the non-conjugated small-molecule CILs could significantly increase the charge transport and collection capabilities, decrease the work function (WF) of the Al counter electrode, and reduce the series resistance and charge recombination at the interface. Most importantly, these simple water/alcohol soluble CILs are of great significance and suitable for the low-cost and large-area preparation of PSCs.
1. Introduction
For conventional polymer-fullerene solar cells, interface strategy has played a key role in the improvement of device performance,1–4 and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices have distinctly exceeded 10%.5–9 Sariciftci et al.10 demonstrated that inserting a cathode interfacial layer of LiF between the photoactive layer and the counter electrode was beneficial to increase the charge collection ability. Cathode interlayers (CILs) including metals and metallic salts, such as Ca, Cs2CO3, have been extensively studied.11,12 However, they usually require expensive vacuum thermal deposition, impeding their application in large-area and low-cost PSCs. In this regard, the development of vacuum-deposition-free CILs becomes an active research field of PSCs. Many kinds of solution-processed interface modification materials have attracted extensive interest, including conjugated polyelectrolytes,1,13–16 non-conjugated polymers17,18 and small molecule electrolytes.6,19 The performance of fullerene-based PSCs has been greatly improved using these interfacial designs.
Compared to fullerene-based PSCs, non-fullerene PSCs have gained extensive attention due to the complementary absorption spectra and easy adjustment properties of the frontier orbital energy levels of photovoltaic materials, taking into account the increased open-circuit voltage (Voc). The PCE of non-fullerene PSCs has exceeded that of fullerene-based devices by reasonable molecular design20 and structure optimization,21 enabling the devices to realize record high efficiency.20–23 These developments indicated that non-fullerene PSCs had bright prospects for commercial organic photovoltaic technology. Furthermore, interfacial engineering rapidly enhanced the properties of non-fullerene PSCs. Water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymers have already been employed for optimizing the performance of the non-fullerene system. Hou et al.24 reported non-fullerene PSCs with a high PCE of 11.1% by inserting water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymer poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethyl-ammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)) (PFN) derivatives as a cathode interlayer, using poly((2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithio phene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithio phene-4,8-dione)) (PBDB-T) donors blended with 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-heylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) acceptors as the active layer. Huang et al.25 synthesized a series of perylene diimide (PDI) based small molecules with different π-deficient backbones and electron-rich end-groups and employed them as CILs in PSCs, achieving remarkable efficiency improvement. However, these electrolytes contained complicated π-conjugated units demanding a complex synthetic procedure, which limits their commercial application due to the high-cost preparation. In view of this, the low cost should attract more attention compared with the device efficiency concerning the commercial application of PSCs. A new kind of water/alcohol soluble non-conjugated small-molecule CILs was developed owing to their many unique advantages, such as simple structure, easy processing, environmental friendliness, and good interfacial modification abilities in electron transport and collection.26–28 They have been successfully used as high-efficiency interfacial materials for first-class perovskite29 and fullerene-based PSCs.6,30,31 However, it is unclear whether the success of non-conjugated small molecule electrolytes for interfacial engineering of fullerene-based PSCs can be the same with non-fullerene PSCs. To the best of our knowledge, there is barely any related report about non-conjugated small molecule CILs for non-fullerene PSCs.
Here, we designed and synthesized three non-conjugated small molecule CILs, namely, 4,4′-((oxygen-bis-(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(dimethyl-ammoniumdiyl))bis(butane-1-sulfonate) (OAS), 4,4′-((sulfur-bis-(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(dimethyl-ammoniumdiyl))bis(butane-1-sulfonate) (SAS), and 4,4′-((sulfone-bis-(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(dimethyl-ammoniumdiyl))bis(butane-1-sulfonate) (SOAS), respectively. The non-conjugated small molecules were comprised of amino cations, sulfonate anions, and various core atoms, such as oxygen, sulfur, and sulfone. With respect to the stable branched chain structure, core atoms also have a critical influence on the intrinsic properties of the materials and the performance of the devices. The synthesized small molecules were then employed as CILs to analyze the effects of different core atoms on the performance of conventional PSCs which contained PBDB-T donors and (3-(1,1-dicyanome thylene)-1-methyl-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (IT-M) acceptors as the blend active layers. The device performance was highly improved by inserting these CILs compared with the control devices without any other treatment, resulting in high PCEs of 10.84%, 11.30%, and 9.93% for OAS, SAS, and SOAS, respectively, which are comparable with those of vacuum deposited or conjugated CILs. This demonstrates that non-conjugated small-molecule electrolytes possess excellent cathode modification ability in non-fullerene PSCs. These low-cost solution processable non-conjugated small-molecule CILs are favorable for developing economic PSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of polymer solar cells
PBDB-T and IT-M were purchased from 1-Material Inc and Solarmer Materials Inc, and used without further purification. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP Al 4083) was received from Heraeus Inc, Germany. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) and other drying solvents were purchased from Acros Inc. ITO glass sheets (1.1 mm thick, ≤15 Ω per square, transmittance ≥ 86%) were received from Wuhu Token Sciences Co., Ltd, and cleaned by a common method with sequential sonication in water, acetone and isopropanol for 40 minutes, respectively. Then, the pre-cleaned ITO glass was treated with UV-ozone for 20 minutes. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP Al 4083) was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s on the ITO, and then annealed on a hot plate at 130 °C for 20 minutes. The PBDB-T:IT-M (1:1, w/w) mixed solvent with a total concentration of 20 mg ml−1 in dry chlorobenzene solution, with 0.5% volume of DIO as an additive, was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. The solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS film to form an active layer with a thickness of ∼100 nm, and then annealed at 120 °C for 10 minutes. Subsequently, various CILs (OAS, SAS and SOAS) with a concentration of 1.5 mg ml−1 dissolved in methanol solution were spin-coated on the active layers with different thicknesses. Finally, the Al electrode was vacuum evaporated (5 × 10−6 mbar) with an effective area of 4 mm2.
2.2 Characterization and measurements
The chemical structures of the compounds were identified by 1H and 13C NMR (Bruker AV-300) with deuterated water as the solvent. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were obtained in a nitrogen-filled glovebox using a source meter (Keithley 2440) and an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Newport-Oriel® Sol3A 450 W) without encapsulation. A standard Si photodiode detector was used to calibrate the intensity of the simulated solar light. The EQE spectra were measured on a quantum efficiency test system (Newport-Oriel® IQE 200™). The thickness of the films was obtained using a surface profiler (Dektak 150). The surface morphologies were acquired using an atomic force microscope (Veeco Dimension 3100V). The absorption spectra were measured on a spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950). The impedance spectra were measured on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) under dark conditions without bias voltage. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed on a multifunctional photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos ULTRA DLD UPS/XPS system) using a He 1 (21.22 eV) source.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular design and DFT calculations
The structures and synthetic procedures of the three non-conjugated small-molecule electrolytes (OAS, SAS, and SOAS) are shown in Fig. 1a, which were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and finally confirmed by elemental analysis, which are described in detail in the ESI.† OAS and SAS exhibit good solubility in polar solvents such as methanol and water, whereas the active-layer materials are almost insoluble. This orthogonal solubility is good for wet processing. It needs to be pointed out that SOAS showed a poor solubility in water/alcohol solution. The energy levels of OAS, SAS, and SOAS were estimated by combining ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Fig. S1†) and the ultraviolet absorption onset (Fig. S2a†). The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of OAS, SAS, and SOAS were 4.55, 4.48, and 4.57 eV which were determined from the absorption onset. These results agreed well with the HOMOs and LUMOs (Fig. 1b) obtained from density functional theory (DFT), where the LUMOs of OAS, SAS, and SOAS were −2.13, −2.06, and −2.03 eV, and the HOMOs of OAS, SAS, and SOAS were −6.78, −6.61, and −6.71 eV, respectively. Their deep HOMO levels are beneficial to obstruct hole transport. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S2a and b,† the bare films of OAS, SAS, and SOAS absorption intensity of PBDB-T:IT-M/CILs films exhibits show little absorption in visible region. Meanwhile, there is almost no change compared to that of the pristine PBDB-T:IT-M film.

3.2 Device performance of small-molecule CIL based PSCs
The PSCs in a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:IT-M/CILs/Al were prepared to study the merit of new small-molecule CIL behaviours. The structure of the device and molecular structures are shown in Fig. 2a. The current density–voltage (J–V) test results and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2b and c. The respective performance parameters are shown in Table 1. All the J–V characteristics of the devices were tested under a standard illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The control devices with a bare Al electrode treated with methanol were firstly fabricated. Methanol treatment reported in many articles has a positive effect on improving the performance of PSCs.32,33 However, the control device with only methanol treatment exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.739 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.19 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 53.32%, resulting in a low PCE of 6.38%. We have also fabricated other devices with reported CILs of Ca, for further comparison. Under optimized conditions, the vacuum deposited Ca-based devices showed a PCE of 9.47%, with a Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.935 V, 15.29 mA cm−2, and 66.25%, respectively. The Voc and FF of the Ca-based devices were dramatically increased compared with those of only methanol-treated devices due to the decreased charge recombination at the active layer/Al interface. Subsequently, the devices with various small molecules (OAS, SAS, and SOAS) as the CILs were fabricated to investigate their interfacial modification abilities. A definitely higher PCE of 10.84% for OAS, 11.30% for SAS, and 9.93% for SOAS were observed, respectively, compared with those of the control devices (6.38% for bare Al). The Voc, Jsc and FF of the OAS-based devices were 0.937 V, 15.96 mA cm−2, and 72.47%, while those of the SOAS-based devices were 0.931 V, 16.04 mA cm−2, and 66.50%, individually. Especially, relative to the only methanol-treated device, the Voc, Jsc and FF of the investigated SAS-based PSCs remarkably increased from 0.739 V to 0.945 V, from 16.19 mA cm−2 to 16.53 mA cm−2, and from 53.32% to 72.21%, respectively, bringing about a high PCE of 11.30%, demonstrating that SAS is an effective cathode interfacial material. The SAS CILs presented better interfacial modification performance than the contrast ones with an enhanced PCE. Notably, SAS could be easily prepared batch to batch at a lower cost than conjugated electrolytes, implying a promising application in the commercialization of PSCs.

It is noteworthy that, with respect to the largely improved Voc and FF, which were heavily dependent on the charge transport and extraction processes, as well as the bimolecular recombination at the interface,34 the Jsc values of the CIL-based devices are comparable with those of the only methanol-treated PSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) characteristics of the PSCs with different CILs are presented in Fig. 2c, which agreed well with the parameters from J–V characterization. The detailed device optimization of the PBDB-T:IT-M/CIL system was carefully carried out by adjusting a series of thicknesses of different CILs, as well as the annealing temperature of the PBDB-T:IT-M active layer; the J–V curves and the extracted detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1.†
3.3 Charge recombination and transport properties
Generally, light intensity dependent J–V characteristics are an efficient and simple method to gain charge carrier recombination information in polymer solar cells.35,36 The total current density (Jtotal) flowing through a solar cell refers to a function of the incident light intensity (Plight) and the applied voltage (V), and could be regarded as a combination of the photogenerated current (Jph) and the dark current (Jdark): Jph(I,V) = Jtotal(I,V) − Jdark(I,V)(1) Pc(I,V) = Jph(I,V)/Jph-sat(I,V)(2)
The charge collection probability Pc(I,V) can be calculated from eqn (2), where the Jph-sat(I,V) is the reverse saturation photocurrent. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of the PBDB-T:IT-M-based PSCs with the SAS CIL for different incident light intensities varying from 15 to 100 mW cm−2. Their corresponding charge collection probability normalized photocurrent Jph (or Pc(I,V)) as a function of the applied voltage extracted from eqn (2) is given in Fig. 3b. For the device with the SAS CIL (Fig. 3b), Jph is primarily linearly proportional to the incident light intensity (the inset of Fig. 3b), and all Jph–V curves almost overlap each other in the range of −0.20 to 0.80 V (near to the maximum power point, Vmpp = 0.773 V), almost independent of the incident light intensity. Based on the results, it could be evidently inferred that in the range from 0 to the Vmpp, where the electric field in the PSCs is high, the recombination in the devices is decided by monomolecular recombination, while bimolecular recombination plays a minor role.37,38 Electrons in the acceptor (A) as well as holes in the donor (D) materials would be extracted to the electrode very quickly under a high electric field, significantly inhibiting the bimolecular recombination, and consequently the monomolecular recombination would predominate the overall recombination process. Monomolecular recombination is relevant to the recombination of strongly bound electron–hole pairs, namely excitons, before their dissociation into free charge carriers, in which electrons or holes recombine through trap states or recombination centers due to interfacial defects or impurities in the materials. However, bimolecular recombination is related to the recombination of free carriers at the D/A interfaces.38 These Jph–V curves become non-identical and show dependency on the incident light intensity in the range from Vmpp to Voc. This variation of Jph–V can be generally ascribed to the decrease of the effective internal potential owing to the large applied forward bias. Beyond the Vmpp, the low internal potential hardly sweeps the carriers to the electrodes, causing the bimolecular recombination to increase quickly, and eventually becomes ascendant over the monomolecular recombination. For the control device, the Jph–V curves start to depart from each other in the range of Vmpp to Voc. However, it can be clearly seen that the Jph–V curves of the SAS-based devices depart very slightly, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is very weak. The greatly suppressed bimolecular recombination accounts for the much larger Jsc and FF and much higher PCE, which agree well with the results presented in Table 1.

Insets in (b) Jph–Plight (the magnitude of current density) plotted against incident light intensity. (c) Jsc and (d) Voc of the investigated devices (with various CILs) as a function of incident light intensity. The data are fitted according to the power law of Jsc ∝ Plightα. 
To gain a deeper understanding of the influence of small-molecule CILs on the charge recombination process in the device, the Jsc and Voc of the devices with various CILs as a function of incident light intensity are displayed Fig. 3c and d. The Jsc values were then fitted with a power law:35,38Jsc ∝ Plightα. Herein, Plight refers to the light intensity and α is the exponential factor. Generally, weak bimolecular recombination would cause a linear dependence of Jsc on light density and a value of α close to 1. The corresponding extracted α values in Fig. 3c are found to be 0.955, 0.978, 0.992, and 0.970 for the device with methanol, OAS, SAS, and SOAS treatment, respectively. It can be seen that α for the devices with SAS is very close to 1, suggesting that carrier losses of SAS-based devices are predominated by monomolecular recombination, while bimolecular recombination is very weak. We also studied the dependence of Voc on Plight with various CILs and found that Voc is proportional to Plight (Fig. 3d). These results are in accordance with our above analysis of the Jph–Plight curves (Fig. 3a and b). Evidently, the results illustrated that the small molecule CILs (OAS, SAS, and SOAS) significantly enhanced the charge extraction efficiency and reduced the charge recombination at the active layer/Al interface.
We further use space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements to investigate the effects of various CILs on the charge transport properties. The configurations of electron-only and hole-only devices were ITO/Al/PBDB-T:IT-M/CILs/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:IT-M/CILs/MoO3/Al, respectively. The J–V curves (Fig. 4a and b) were fitted according to the SCLC model determined using the following equation:39,40 (3)where J is the dark current density, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, μ refers to the zero-field mobility of holes (μh) or electrons (μe), Vappl is the applied voltage, Vbi is the built-in voltage, and L refers to the thickness of the blend film. Fig. 4a and b show that the control device without any CILs exhibited a relatively low hole mobility (μh) of 5.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility (μe) of 4.16 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. After inserting a CIL, both electron and hole mobilities significantly increased. The SAS-based devices showed the highest charge mobilities for holes and electrons (μh = 9.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 5.73 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), while the mobility values of holes and electrons were 8.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.60 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the OAS-based device, and those were 7.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.73 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the SOAS-based device, respectively. Obviously, the devices with the SAS CIL have more excellent charge mobilities, leading to the increase of Jsc and FF, suggesting that the SAS interlayer efficiently decreases the charge transport barrier at the interface. Furthermore, the PBDB-T:IT-M-based devices with various CILs were analyzed by impedance measurements. As shown in Fig. S4.† impedance spectroscopy was performed in the dark without bias voltage for the investigated devices at a frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz with an oscillation amplitude of 10 mV. The diameter of the test semicircle is related to the shunt resistance of the device in the Nyquist plots, which is usually connected with the loss of charges on account of leakage current pathways and charge recombination in the bulk or at the interfaces.41–43 The highest Rsh of the SAS-based device suggested the lowest charge recombination rate, which was consistent with the highest Jsc and the best device properties.

3.4 The effect of small-molecule CILs on the work function and morphology
Non-conjugated small-molecule CILs could form the interfacial dipole at the active layer/Al interface, giving rise to the work function (WF) change of the Al electrode. The interaction between the synthetic CIL materials and Al was confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Fig. 5 shows that the WF of Al was 4.28 eV, which agreed well with other reported data.44 The work function can be measured according to the equation45W = hν − (Ecutoff − Eonset), where W is the work function, hν is the incident photon energy (He 1 source, hν = 21.22 eV), Ecutoff is the high binding energy which was determined by linear extrapolation to zero at the yield of secondary electrons, and Eonset is the onset relative to the Fermi level (EFermi) of Al (0 eV). The values of Ecutoff for Al, OAS, SAS and SOAS are 16.94, 17.26, 17.31, and 17.19 eV, resulting in the decrease of the WFs of OAS, SAS and SOAS surface-modified Al electrodes from 4.28 to 3.96, 3.91, and 4.03 eV, respectively. The SAS-based Al electrode possessed the largest Δ value of 0.37 eV, leading to the largest dipole moment between SAS and the Al electrode and the highest Voc of the devices.46 The good water/alcohol solubility of OAS and SAS made them easily form the continuous and strong dipole moments on the Al electrode. Furthermore, it could facilitate the better energy level arrangement with the LUMO of IT-M by reducing the electron transport and collection barrier, resulting in an enhancement of the FF.

The film morphologies of pristine PBDB-T:IT-M and PBDB-T:IT-M/various CIL blend films were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 6, the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the pristine PBDB-T:IT-M film was 1.63 nm with a smooth surface. The RMS values of the PBDB-T:IT-M blend films with OAS, SAS and SOAS were 1.73 nm, 1.39 nm and 1.87 nm, respectively. The SAS modified active layer showed the smallest RMS, which is conducive to the formation of ohmic contact at the interface, resulting in an improvement in Jsc and the device efficiency. The SOAS-based blend film had the largest RMS, which might be attributed to its relatively poor solubility in methanol, causing the SOAS-based devices to show a low FF value of 66.5% and a relatively low PCE of 9.93%. All the modified surfaces remained homogeneous. The AFM results showed that our designed molecules as CILs had great potential for large-area PSC preparation.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized three non-conjugated small molecules which contain amino cations, sulfonate anions, and various core atoms, namely, OAS, SAS, and SOAS, respectively. The small molecules were employed as cathode interlayers in PBDB-T:IT-M based conventional PSCs, and their photovoltaic properties were investigated in detail. Significant enhancements in the device performance were observed by adding these CILs between the PBDB-T:IT-M-based active layer and the Al electrode. The CILs could meaningfully lower the WF of the Al electrode, and reduce the charge transport barrier and recombination at the interface. A high PCE of 11.30% for SAS-based PSCs was achieved, with a Voc of 0.945 V, a Jsc of 16.52 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.2%, which are higher than those of traditional CILs of Ca or a commonly used one. Notably, these non-conjugated CILs could be easily prepared and solution processed, demonstrating great application prospects in the interfacial modification of cathodes for non-fullerene PSCs. This particular research on the structure–property relationships affords new design strategies for efficient non-conjugated small-molecule CILs in PSCs.
