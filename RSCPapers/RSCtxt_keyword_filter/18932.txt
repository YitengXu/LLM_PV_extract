    , Accepted 6th February 2012First published on 8th March 2012AbstractWe report the synthesis of new donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) dyes and their application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) with nickel(II) oxide (NiO)-based photocathodes. These D–π–A sensitizers incorporate a triphenylamine donor, a bithiophene π-bridge, and a perylenemonoimide (PMI) acceptor group. Two carboxylate groups attached to the triphenylamine afford strong anchoring to the NiO surface. The dyes in this series were varied firstly by the inclusion of an ethynyl linker between bithiophene and the triphenylamine moieties (1vs. 2), thereby increasing the length of the conjugated bridge. Despite very similar optoelectronic properties, the ethynyl-containing dye 2 showed a ∼25% improvement in power conversion efficiency in p-DSCs compared to 1, mostly attributed to the increased current density. Contrary to initial expectations, there was no major influence of the distance between the PMI unit of the dye and the NiO surface on the photoinduced dye anion lifetime, as measured by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). Furthermore, altering the position of the alkyl chains on the bridging bithiophene in 3 and 4 resulted in a modest red shift in the dye absorption on account of increased charge delocalisation between the PMI and the π-bridge, owing to a reduced torsion angle between the PMI and the adjacent thiophene unit. Quantum-chemical DFT calculations were performed in order to evaluate these torsion angles and to study their influence on the electron density distribution in the relevant molecular orbitals. These changes of the molecular structure of the isomeric dyes 3 and 4 did not translate into improved photovoltaic performance, which is primarily attributed to lower charge photogeneration rates probed by transient absorption spectroscopy. While for p-type DSCs impressive overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of 0.04–0.10% under full sun illumination (simulated AM1.5G sunlight, 100 mW cm−2) and a broad incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) response (350–700 nm) is demonstrated for these new dyes, the study clearly shows the need for judicious design rules for p-type sensitizers for application in photocathodic DSCs.
Introduction
The direct conversion of solar energy to electricity is expected to provide a significant contribution to the renewable energy sector in coming years. In this context, n-type dye-sensitized solar cells (n-DSCs) have attracted considerable attention with state-of-the-art DSCs displaying overall power conversion efficiencies (η) in excess of 12%.1–5 These devices utilise Ru(II)-polypyridyl complexes or metal-free organic dyes as the photoactive material which are adsorbed onto a high surface area mesoporous n-type titanium dioxide (TiO2) along with a catalytic cathode typically from platinum.6,7 In this case, photocurrent results from electron injection from a photoexcited dye into the n-type semiconductor. In contrast, dye-sensitized photocathodic solar cells (p-DSCs) operate in an inverse mode with the transfer of a hole from a photoexcited dye to the valence band of a p-type semiconductor such as NiO. Although some organic dyes such as erythrosin B,8 coumarin9–12 and perylene derivatives13 have been used as sensitizers for p-DSCs, recent studies have shown that for efficient p-type NiO-based photocathodic sensitizers it is important that the anchoring groups are attached to the electron donor part of the dye molecule and that the acceptor unit should be spatially removed from the semiconductor surface.6,13–15
Due to good chemical and photostability, as well as reasonable transparency, NiO represents to date the most successful p-type semiconductor used for construction of dye-sensitized photocathodes and of tandem np-DSCs, in which both electrodes are photoactive,8,12,13 although other metal oxide semiconductors have also been used.16,17 Photocurrent matching is an essential prerequisite for the realization of highly efficient tandem pn-DSCs. Recently, we demonstrated a judicious design of D–π–A dyes which led to record efficiencies in p-DSCs and tandem np-DSCs.18 p-DSCs with peak incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) values as high as 62% and overall efficiencies of up to 0.41% were observed using the perylenemonoimide–oligothiophene–triphenylamine (PMI–nT–TPA) triads. In tandem np-DSC devices record efficiencies of up to 2.42% were demonstrated. While these efficiencies constitute the best reported for p-type DSCs to date, photocurrent matching of efficient np-DSCs requires p-type sensitizers demonstrating high quantum efficiency over a spectral range complementary to their n-type counterparts. Due to intensive research efforts over the last two decades, the number of available efficient n-type sensitizers is very broad.6 Furthermore, there is a fairly well understood set of criteria governing charge injection, charge recombination and charge regeneration reactions in n-type DSCs.6,19 In contrast, p-type DSCs are still in their infancy with only a few reports highlighting the correlations between the molecular structure and their solar cell performance.13,18,20–23
Herein, we present a further structural fine tuning of D–π–A dye 1 as a model for the series of PMI–nT–TPA. In derivative 2 an additional ethynylene unit is incorporated between the bridging bithiophene unit and the triphenylamine donor. D–π–A dyes 3 and 4 represent regioisomers to 1 and 2, respectively, and bear the hexyl side chain at the other β-position in each thiophene ring of the bithiophene bridge. Instead of creating a distortion of the PMI and the adjacent 3-hexylthiophene unit in dyes 1 and 2, in isomers 3 and 4 the steric repulsion is released (Chart 1). This was further confirmed by quantum-chemical DFT calculations. By shifting the alkyl chain position, the torsion angle between the perylene and thiophene units in 3 decreases, resulting in a more planar dye with red-shifted absorption. Changing the position of the alkyl chain (going from dye 1 to 3), however, results in steric hindrance between the triphenylamine and the bithiophene bridge, which was further reduced by the inclusion of an ethynyl unit in dye 4. This series of dyes facilitates investigation into the effect of steric hindrances within sensitizing molecules for p-DSCs. The insertion of a rigid triple bond in dyes 2 and 4 increases the distance between the acceptor and the NiO surface. It was anticipated that this extra distance may affect the recombination kinetics between the photoinjected holes on NiO and electrons primarily located on the perylene unit of the photoreduced dye.

Results and discussions
Synthesis
Synthesis of triphenylamine building block 11 was achieved according to Scheme 1. 4-Bromo benzoic acid 5 was suspended in thionyl chloride and then stirred under reflux for 1 hour. After removal of the excess of thionyl chloride the intermediate 4-bromo benzoic acid chloride 5a was reacted with potassium tert-butylate dissolved in THF at 0 °C to afford 4-bromo benzoic acid tert-butyl ester 6 in an overall 87% yield after bulb-to-bulb distillation.24 Reaction of 1.5 eq. of aniline with 4-bromo benzoic acid tert-butyl ester 6 in a Pd0-catalyzed amination by using 2.25 eq. of potassium tert-butylate in toluene at room temperature yielded 78% of diphenylamine 7 after recrystallization. Under similar conditions, diphenylamine 7 was reacted with 1.2 eq. of aryl bromide 6 to give corresponding triphenylamine 8 in 93% yield after column chromatography. Triphenylamine 8 was iodinated in dioxane using 2 eq. of iodine monochloride which had been activated by zinc acetate as Lewis acid.25 Iodinated triphenylamine 9 was obtained in 90% yield after recrystallization. Ethynyl-triphenylamine building block 10 was synthesized by Pd0-catalyzed Sonogashira reaction of iodinated triphenylamine 9 and 1.5 eq. of trimethylsilylacetylene in piperidine. The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 3 hours and triarylamine 10 was obtained in 92% yield after chromatographic work-up. Deprotection of 10 using 3 eq. of caesium fluoride in a THF/methanol mixture afforded acetylene 11 in quantitative yield.

Reagents and conditions: (a) SOCl2, reflux; (b) KOtBu, THF, 0 °C; (c) Pd2dba3, [HP(tBu)3]BF4, KOtBu, toluene, rt; (d) ICl, Zn(OAc)2, dioxane, rt; (e) trimethylsilylacetylene, CuI, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, piperidine, 60 °C; and (f) CsF, THF, methanol, rt. 
5-Bromo-3′,4-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene2612 was lithiated with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) in THF at −78 °C and successively quenched with trimethylsilyl (TMS) chloride to afford TMS-protected bithiophene 13 in 83% yield (Scheme 2). Lithiation of bithiophene 13 with n-BuLi in THF at −78 °C and subsequent addition of pinacol isopropyl borate led to boronic ester 14 in 87% yield (GC-purity: 90%), which was used for the next step without further purification. Perylenyl-bithiophene dyad 16 was synthesized by Pd0-catalyzed Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction of brominated perylenemonoimide 15 and boronic ester 14 in THF at 60 °C and successive in situ deprotection of the TMS group using tetrabutylammonium fluoride. After column chromatography perylenyl-bithiophene 16 was obtained in an overall yield of 92%. Dyad 16 was iodinated using an effective mercury-mediated iodination procedure26 to afford iodinated perylenyl-bithiophene 18 in 92% yield after column chromatography.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of perylenylbithiophene building block 18. Reagents and conditions: (a) (1) n-BuLi, THF, −78 °C, (2) Me3SiCl; (b) (1) n-BuLi, THF, −78 °C, and (2) pinacol isopropyl borate; (c) (1) Pd(PPh3)4, K3PO4, DME, 80 °C and (2) Bu4NF; and (d) (1) Hg(OCp)2, dichloromethane, rt and (2) I2. 
Regioisomeric perylenyl-bithiophene building blocks 17 (ref. 26) and 18 were reacted with freshly deprotected triphenylamine 11 in a Pd0-catalyzed Sonogashira reaction to afford corresponding triads 19 and 20 in 60 and 87% yield, respectively, after column chromatography (Scheme 3). The hydrolysis of the ester group in the case of 2 and 4 under acidic conditions using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was not successful. Therefore, the ester groups were saponified with lithium hydroxide in methanol at 70 °C to give free acids 2 and 4 in 60 and 88% yields, respectively, after acidification with hydrochloric acid and filtration over a short column.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of perylenyl-oligothiophene–triphenylamines 2 and 4. Reagents and conditions: (a) for 19: CuI, Pd2dba3, [HP(tBu)3]BF4, piperidine, rt; for 20: CuI, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, diisopropylamine, toluene, rt and (b) LiOH, MeOH, THF, 70 °C. 
PMI–2T–TPA triad 3, which is regioisomeric to parent dye 1, was built up from bithiophene–triphenylamine dyad 22, which was obtained by Pd0-catalyzed Suzuki-type coupling reaction of bromobithiophene 12 and triphenylamine boronic ester 21 in 87% yield after chromatographic work-up. Bromination of 22 at the free α-position of the terminal thiophene unit was carried out with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in DMF at −10 °C (Scheme 4). After column chromatography brominated dyad 23 was obtained in 80% yield.
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of perylenyl-oligothiophene–triphenylamine 3. Reagents and conditions: (a) Pd(OAc)2, PPh3, K3PO4, THF, reflux; (b) NBS, DMF, −10 °C; (c) (1) isopropylmagnesium chloride, LiCl, THF, −10 °C and (2) pinacol isopropyl borate; (d) Pd(PPh3)4, K3PO4, THF, reflux; and (e) TFA, dichloromethane, rt. 
Borylation of dyad 23 was obtained in a yield of about 50% (confirmed by 1H-NMR) via magnesium–bromine exchange using isopropylmagnesium chloride and lithium chloride in THF at −10 °C and subsequent quenching with pinacol isopropyl borate. It was used for the next step without further purification. Pd0-catalyzed Suzuki-type reaction of bromoperylenemonoimide 15 and boronic ester 24 afforded PMI–2T–TPA triad 25 in 86% yield after chromatographic work-up. Triad 25 was hydrolyzed using TFA in dichloromethane at room temperature to give free acid 3 in quantitative yield after precipitation from n-hexane.
Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PMI–2T–TPA triads 1–4 showed an intense absorption band positioned at 520 to 530 nm (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The elongation of the donor part by a triple bond in 2 and 4 did not change the maximum of the low energy absorption band compared to triads 1 and 3.27,28 However, the high energy absorption band, which corresponds to the donor unit (λabs = ∼360 nm), is slightly broadened towards the lower energy region.

 Fig. 1  (a) UV-Vis spectra of 1–4 in dichloromethane. (b) Absorption spectra of the sensitizers on a NiO film (NiO absorption subtracted). 
In comparison to the triads 1 and 2 the change of the hexyl positions in dyes 3 and 4 led to a red shift of about 10 nm and a broadening of the low energy absorption band. This might be due to a partial decoupling between the perylene and bithiophene π-orbitals, caused by a stronger twist between the perylene and bithiophene units in 1 and 2, as a result of the hexyl chain close to the perylene unit. This assumption was supported by the observed low energy absorption band showing only one red-shifted maximum (λmax = ∼528 nm) for 3 and 4, while one maximum and an additional shoulder (λmax = 518 nm, λmax, sh = 498 nm) in the case of 1 and 2.

Fig. 1b shows the optical absorption of dyes 1–4 adsorbed onto the surface of transparent 0.9 μm thick NiO films with the absorption of the blank NiO film subtracted. Compared to solution spectra, dyes anchored at the NiO surface show blue-shifts of ∼10 to 20 nm for the low energy absorption band, along with a spectral broadening. As a result of this broadening the onset of absorption onto the NiO film is extended to wavelengths of 650–670 nm. A spectral broadening is also commonly observed in the absorption of organic dyes adsorbed onto the surface of n-type TiO2, which is ascribed to the electronic interactions of the dye with the semiconductor and adjacent dye molecules.29,30 The red shift in the low energy absorption band between the dyes in solution and attached to NiO is nearly identical for all dyes. The red shift associated with change in the hexyl chain position in regioisomer dyes 3 and 4 is also clearly observed on NiO making these dyes better light absorbers for p-type DSCs. The similar spectral shifts for each dye, as compared to solution, suggest there is no major difference in the orientation or packing of dye molecules on the NiO surface.
Electrochemical properties
Oxidation and reduction potentials of triads 1–4 were measured by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as a supporting electrolyte (Fig. 2). Redox potentials as well as electrochemically determined band gaps (ΔECV) are summarized in Table 1. In the oxidative regime, one oxidation process can be attributed to the perylene unit (E°ox3) while the remaining ones originate from the oxidation of the combined bithiophene and triarylamine donor. It is interesting to note that the first and second oxidation potentials (E°ox1 and E°ox2) of the ethynyl-containing dyes 2 and 4 are positively shifted compared to non-ethynylated counterparts 1 and 3. This can be ascribed to the presence of the electron-withdrawing ethynylene group at the molecular backbone or by a conformational change of the thiophene and triphenylamine unit along the triple bond.28,31 The perylene oxidation of 2 (E°ox = 1.10 V) and 4 (E°ox = 1.04) is favoured over that of 1 (E°ox = 1.15 V) and 3 (E°ox = 1.12). The results demonstrated that the dications of ethynyl-containing dyes 2 and 4, which are formed prior to the perylene oxidation, withdraw less electron density from the adjacent perylene than the donor dications of ethynyl-free dyes 1 and 3. On the other hand, all triads showed nearly identical electrochemical behaviour in the reductive regime, which corresponds to the two step reduction of the perylene unit at around −1.41 V and −1.87 V, respectively.

The HOMO levels of the triads calculated from electrochemical measurements were sufficiently lower than the valance band edge of NiO (∼ −5.0 eV vs. vacuum or 0.5 V vs. NHE) enabling sufficient driving force for hole injection from the dye to the p-type semiconductor in DSCs. Equally, the LUMO energies of 1–4 are sufficiently above the redox potential of the iodide–triiodide redox couple, which should facilitate dye regeneration (Fig. 3).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a B3LYP hybrid base (6-31G+(d,p)) were performed in order to evaluate the distortion between the perylene and the adjacent hexylthiophene unit and to analyse the electron distribution of the frontier orbitals. The HOMO–LUMO distribution of all dyes is shown in Fig. 4. The HOMO orbital distribution in dyes 3 and 4 is slightly more localized on the thiophene and TPA units, whereas in dyes 1 and 2 a more pronounced distribution on the PMI compared to the TPA part is observed. The differences in the HOMO orbital distribution are most probably due to a larger twist in the thiophene–PMI bond in dyes 1 and 2 that arises from the presence of the alkyl side chain close to the PMI unit (torsion angle ∼63°) compared to 3 and 4 (torsion angle = 54°). Consequently, a better electronic delocalization between PMI and thiophene parts can be expected in dyes 3 and 4 as manifested in the HOMO electronic distribution. In contrast, the LUMO orbital distribution is very similar for all dyes and localized almost entirely on the PMI unit.
 Fig. 4  Frontier orbitals distribution of dyes 1–4 calculated using the B3LYP (6-31G+(dp)) DFT method (carbons in gray, nitrogens in blue, oxygens in red, sulfurs in yellow and hydrogens in white). In order to accelerate the convergence of optimizations the long hexyl chains were replaced with ethyl substituents. 
The presence of the alkyl side chain on the TPA site in the case of dye 3 resulted in a large torsion angle of about 47.4° between the thiophene and phenyl units compared to dye 1 with a torsion angle of only 25°. The torsion between the TPA and adjacent thiophene unit was further reduced to planarity by the introduction of a triple bond (improper torsion angle = 0.9°) in dye 4, while no significant difference was observed in the device performance as compared to dye 3 (vide infra).
Photovoltaic performance
For the potential application in DSCs the stability of the dyes is very important. This series of dyes are found to be highly stable under acidic and basic conditions. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices based on dyes 1–4 are shown in Fig. 5 and the data are summarized in Table 2. The device measurements are very coherent and the data are reproducible within the given experimental accuracy. The results presented are repeated 3 times (different days) and are average over ∼4 devices each.

The advantage of the presence of the ethynylene unit in triad 2 is reflected in an increased short circuit current density (JSC) value by about 30% compared to parent dye 1, roughly half the increase seen previously by going from a bithiophene to quaterthiophene bridge.18 Absorption data (Fig. 1), however, show little difference in the light-harvesting properties of dyes 1 and 2. This improvement in JSC is likely to arise from the retardation of charge recombination of the photoreduced dyes with holes in the NiO-photocathode. This assumption was made based on our previous observation that the tunnelling distance between electrons occupying the dye's LUMO and holes located in the semiconductor electrode strongly governs the observable recombination time constants.18 No change was observed in the open circuit voltage (VOC) and FF values for dyes 1 and 2. The device based on ethynyl-containing dye 2 showed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.10% among the dyes studied here, which is about 25% higher compared to dye 1. In comparison to dye 1 device, a decrease in the VOC and JSC values was seen by changing the position of the hexyl chain in regioisomer dye 3, thus, lowering the PCE to 0.04%. The introduction of a triple bond in regioisomer dye 4 slightly increases the JSC value compared to dye 3, and subsequently the overall PCEs for both dyes are very similar. The comparable performance of dyes 3 and 4 can be ascribed to the planarization of the perylene–thiophene units due to the different hexyl substitution pattern compared to 1 and 2. The result further confirms that the partial decoupling between the acceptor and donor units appears to be essential for better device performance. Compared to dyes 1 and 3, the JSC values are increased for ethynyl-containing sensitizers, 2 and 4, which could be ascribed to the improved injection and/or reduced recombination process.
IPCE responses of devices constructed using 1–4 are shown in Fig. 6 and correspond well with the measured JSC values given in Table 2. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit broad IPCE spectra ranging from 350 up to 650 nm region, which is extended to 700 nm for dyes 3 and 4. The IPCE spectrum of dye 1 showed a maximum of about 16% at both absorption peaks of 380 and 503 nm. An increase in the IPCE peak maximum to 22% was observed by the insertion of an ethynylene group in dye 2. The result is also consistent with their absorption spectra in thin films, thus, showing the contribution of absorption bands to the IPCE and JSC. In contrast, the regioisomeric dye 3 showed an IPCE maximum of only about 8% at 533 nm, which is slightly increased to 10% for ethynylene-containing regioisomeric dye 4. The results clearly show the influence of the ethynylene spacer on the solar cell performance. In addition to the increasing magnitude of the IPCE response, there is also an observed broadening in the absorption peak corresponding to high energy absorption (∼400 to 450 nm), which is in agreement with the thin film absorption spectra seen in Fig. 1b.

The IPCE responses show that, in spite of the improved light harvesting, and a similar magnitude of light absorption (Fig. 1b), lower quantum efficiencies for either charge injection or transport are mostly responsible for the smaller JSC values recorded for dyes 3 and 4. This might be due to the planarization of the perylene–thiophene unit. In Fig. 1b it can be seen that in all cases spectra of the dyes on NiO films show a peak at ∼350 to 360 nm which is higher than the one at ∼500 nm. In contrast, the peaks of the IPCE at both wavelength regions for all devices are nearly identical. In these p-DSC devices the IPCE response at short wavelengths is mitigated due to the light harvesting competition from both the electrolyte and NiO.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments of dyes 1–4 on NiO films in the absence of a redox mediator were performed to investigate the recombination kinetics of the photoreduced dye anions with holes in the NiO-photocathode (Fig. 7). Substantially higher signal magnitudes have been measured for dyes 1 and 2 compared to the regioisomeric dyes 3 and 4, which cannot be attributed to differences in the absorbed pump beam intensity (1–10−αd, where αd is the optical density of the films) at the pump wavelength of 532 nm (see Fig. 1b and S1†), since the optical densities of the films were nearly identical. Furthermore, the absorbance of the electrochemically reduced dye species in DMF solution is also very similar at the probe wavelength of 700 nm (see Fig. S2†). While the electrochemically reduced 3 and 4 absorb less light in the 600–700 nm main anion absorption band, the anions of 3 and 4 absorb slightly more due to their red-shifted absorbance band at the 700 nm TA probe wavelength. Therefore, the reduced TAS signal magnitude in Fig. 7 is not due to a lower absorption coefficient of the 3 and 4 anions, but rather originates from reduced hole injection yield and/or a fast component of the recombination kinetics, beyond the time resolution of our setup (50 ns).

The transient spectra of photoreduced dyes 1 and 3 resemble that of the electrochemically generated species (Fig. 8a and b as well as Fig. S2†). We note that the intense absorption peak of the electrochemically generated anion 3 centred at 625 nm is not evident in the TA spectrum (Fig. 8b). We attribute this to the stronger overlap of the red-shifted ground state absorption of 3 and the first absorption peak of the anion, which has not shifted significantly between 1 and 3. As a result TAS of NiO sensitized with dye 3 shows a less significant absorption feature in the 600–650 nm wavelength range than NiO films sensitized with dye 1. The NiO hole–dye anion recombination kinetics for all dyes in Fig. 7 are quite similar and can be characterized with a signal decay half time of around 300 ns for 1 and 2 and around 250 ns for 3 and 4, which is very similar to our previously reported value for the dye 1.18 Contrary to our expectation, the elongation of the π-bridge in dyes 2 and 4 using the ethynyl spacer did not translate into an improved dye anion lifetime compared to 1 and 3. In our previous study, increasing the number of bithiophene units resulted in a 7-fold increase for the quaterthiophene and a further 2 fold increase for the sexithiophene bridge.18 Clearly, the ethynyl linker is found to be not as effective as the bithiophene bridge. A possible explanation for the reduced charge generation yield in 3 and 4 could be the reduction of the torsion angle between the PMI and the adjacent thiophene unit, thus resulting in a faster hole–dye anion recombination rate.

The green solid line represents scaled absorption of electrochemically reduced (at −550 mV versus Ag/AgCl) dye anion in DMF. The thick black line represents scaled and inverted absorption spectrum of neutral dye in DMF at open circuit. 
Further work should focus on determining the photophysical origin of the reduced performance of dyes 3 and 4 using sub-ns time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, photoreduced dye anion and NiO recombination is fast for all four dyes, competing with dye anion regeneration occurring on a similar time scale. Extending dye anion lifetime to the μs to ms time range, similarly to frequently observed long photooxidized dye–TiO2 lifetimes of most n-type dye-sensitised photoanodes, will be crucial for photocathodes to match their performance, a prerequisite for high efficiency tandem (np-DSC) devices.
Conclusion
Synthesis and characterization of a new series of PMI–2T–TPA triads have been reported where (1) an ethynyl group was used to extend the π-bridge length, and/or (2) the positions of the hexyl chains on the thiophenes that comprise the π-bridge were altered. Subsequently, steric hindrances within the dye were investigated. Optical, electrochemical and device results showed the benefit of an ethynyl linker, although this was much more pronounced for dye 2 compared to 1 than for 4 compared to 3. There were also clearly observed differences for the regioisomeric dyes 3 and 4 compared to dyes 1 and 2. Quantum-chemical DFT calculations showed the planarization of the perylene–thiophene linkage for compounds 3 and 4, resulting in a beneficial red shift (greater light harvesting ability), however, this was outweighed by a decreased charge generation and/or collection, suggesting that torsion between the acceptor and donor may be necessary for high quantum efficiencies. A broad IPCE spectrum is observed for these dyes in the spectral region between 350 and 700 nm, which increases by insertion of an acetylene unit leading to an increased π-conjugation length. Using 1.5 μm thick mesoporous NiO films, power conversion efficiencies in the range from 0.04 to 0.10% under full sun illumination (simulated AM 1.5G sunlight, 100 mW cm−2) were observed, which give valuable insight into the construction principles of dyes for NiO-photocathodes useful for p-DSCs. It should be noted that with dye 2 comprising an ethynylene spacer the power conversion efficiency of the original PMI–2T–TPA 1 has been increased from 0.08 to 0.10%, i.e. a 25% improvement. Furthermore, to develop high performance tandem devices it is also crucial to develop p-type sensitizers that match the performance of their n-type counterpart and should have complementary absorption, work towards this direction is in progress.
Experimental
General procedures

1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and d6-DMSO on a Bruker AMX 400 at 400 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and d6-DMSO on a Bruker AMX 400 at 100 MHz. Chemical shifts are denoted by a δ unit (ppm). The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), dt (double triplet), quin (quintet), hep (heptet) and m (multiplet) and the assignments are Pery (perylene), TPA (triphenylamine), Ph (phenyl), and Th (thiophene) for 1H NMR. Mass spectra were recorded with a Varian Saturn 2000 GC-MS and with a MALDI-TOF MS Bruker Reflex 2 (dithranol as the generally used matrix and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid for the free acids). Melting points were determined with a Büchi B-545 melting point apparatus and are not corrected. Gas chromatography was carried out using a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph. HPLC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu SCL-10A equipped with a SPD-M10A photodiode array detector and a SC-10A solvent delivery system using a LiChrosphor column (Silica 60, 5 μm, Merck). Thin-layer chromatography was carried out on Silica Gel 60 F254 aluminium plates (Merck). Solvents and reagents were purified and dried by usual methods prior to use and typically used under inert gas atmosphere. The following starting materials were purchased and used without further purification: p-bromobenzoic acid (Merck), thionyl chloride (Merck), potassium tert-butylate (Merck), iodine monochloride (Merck), zinc acetate (Merck), bis(pinacolato)diboron (Lancaster), ethynyl-trimethyl-silane (ABCR), and Pd(dppf)Cl2 (Aldrich).
Optical and cyclic voltammetric measurements
UV-Vis spectra in dichloromethane solution were taken on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 19 spectrometer. Thin film spectra were taken using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrometer with integrating sphere attachment (Varian Internal DRA 2500). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled EG&G PAR 273 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell (5 mL). The platinum working electrode consisted of a platinum wire sealed in a soft glass tube with a surface of A = 0.785 mm2, which was polished down to 0.5 μm with Buehler polishing paste prior to use in order to obtain reproducible surfaces. The counter electrode consisted of a platinum wire and the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferricenium couple. For the measurements concentrations of 10−3 mol L−1 of the electroactive species were used in freshly distilled and deaerated dichloromethane (Lichrosolv, Merck) and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, Fluka) which was twice recrystallized from ethanol and dried under vacuum prior to use.
Quantum-chemical calculations
Density functional theory was employed with the hybrid functionals B3LYP and the basis set 6-31G+ including d and p diffuse functions from the Gaussian 09 package. The long hexyl chains, which have no significant impact on the frontier orbitals of the chromophores, were replaced with ethyl substituents in order to accelerate the convergence of optimizations.
Device fabrication
4 × 4 mm NiO films were screen printed onto F:SnO2 glass (Nippon Sheet Glass) using a paste produced by grinding 15 g of NiO (Inframat) in ethanol, added in small aliquots. 50 mL of a 10 wt% ethyl cellulose solution in ethanol and 100 mL terpineol were then added and after mixing ethanol was evaporated to leave a terpineol based paste. These were sintered for 30 minutes at 400 °C, then 10 minutes at 550 °C, before being immersed into dye solutions (0.2 mM in DMF) for 2 hours. Films were then removed from this dye solution and rinsed subsequently in DMF and ethanol before being allowed to dry. Counter electrodes were produced by applying one drop of H2PtCl6 (10 mM in ethanol) to F:SnO2 glass and thermally decomposing by firing at 400 °C for 15 minutes under a gentle flow of air. Counter and working electrodes were sandwiched together with a 25 μm Surlyn (Dupont) spacer, and heated to ∼120 °C for ∼30 seconds in order to create a seal. The electrolyte solution was introduced through a pre-drilled hole in the counter electrode, which was subsequently sealed with another piece of Surlyn and a microscope cover slip.
Current–voltage characterisation
Solar cells were tested using simulated sunlight (AM1.5, 1000 W m−2) provided by an Oriel solar simulator with an AM1.5 filter. Current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Cells were biased from high to low, with 10 mV steps and a 250 ms settling time between the application of a bias and current measurement.
Incident photon to current efficiency characterisation
IPCE was measured with the cell held under short circuit conditions and illuminated by monochromatic light. A Cornerstone 260 monochromator was used in conjunction with an optical fibre, Keithly 2400 source meter and 150 W Oriel Xe lamp. Prior to testing a 30 second ‘rest’ period was introduced to ensure the dark current dropped to zero when the cell was short circuited. Additionally, 200 ms settling time was applied between the monochromator switching to a wavelength and measurement commencing, which was followed by an averaged reading over a 1 second period.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
TAS experiments were performed as previously reported.32 A 532 nm pump was used (Nd-YAG, INDI-40-10, Spectra-Physics), operating in Q-switch mode (6 ns pulse) at a 10 Hz repetition rate. A 1000 W Xe lamp (Edinburgh Instruments) was used for the probe, employing a 700 nm bandpass filter with an FWHM of 40 nm. The signal was passed through a monochromator to a Si detector (Femto), and a signal recorded by a Tektronix 4054 oscilloscope.
