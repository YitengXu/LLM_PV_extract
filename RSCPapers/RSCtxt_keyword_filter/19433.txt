    , Accepted 14th January 2020First published on 14th January 2020AbstractHybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) are selected for incorporation between the perovskite film and the hole transport layer (HTL). Owing to the high absorption coefficient and the suitable band gap of CsPbI3, an optimized energy level structure can be expected. Besides, energy transfer could be realized due to the overlap between the emission spectrum of CdSe QDs and the excitation spectrum of CsPbI3 QDs. Hence, CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs can serve as an interface layer to promote interfacial charge extraction and enhance light harvesting ability simultaneously. Compared with pristine perovskite solar cells (PSCs), hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QD incorporated PSCs achieve 21% enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). The enhancement of PCE can be ascribed to the ultrafast charge carrier dynamics and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. The design of hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs offers an alternative method for interfacial engineering to enhance optical properties and facilitate the charge transport process in PSCs.
1. Introduction
As photovoltaic devices, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn worldwide attention due to their high absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion lengths, weak exciton binding energy and high charge carrier mobility.1,2 PSCs have made impressive progress with a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 25% owing to the unremitting efforts of researchers.3 However, the charge carrier recombination between adjacent layers and perovskite layers is still a main hurdle for their performance advancement.4,5 Specifically, the unfavorable conduction band offset of each layer is detrimental to interfacial charge transfer processes, thus leading to unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance.6 Additionally, defects located at grain boundaries (GBs) have a tendency to combine with water and oxygen in the air which can result in the degradation of perovskite across these interfaces and boundaries.7,8 Therefore, interfaces and boundaries (surface and grain) between perovskite/hole transport layers (HTLs) are of great significance to improve the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.
Interface engineering provides a platform to study and design the interfaces between each functional layer of the PSCs, whose carrier transport barriers determine the PCE of PSCs.9,10 Appropriate interface engineering could simultaneously realize the regulation of charge transfer processes and passivation of defects at the GBs.11,12 Various strategies have been reported to modify the interfaces between perovskite and HTLs or electron transporting layers (ETLs), such as using Lewis-base,13 fullerene and its derivatives,14–16 graphene,17 metal oxides,8 inorganic quantum dots (QDs)18–21etc. Among all these approaches, inorganic QDs show their unique advantages including tunable band gaps, high extinction coefficients and the multiple exciton generation (MEG) phenomenon, thus emerging as promising interface modifiers.22 Therefore, incorporation of QDs in PSCs has shown potential for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells. As reported, the defects located at the boundaries of perovskite can be passivated by QDs, thus promoting the charge transport, retarding the carrier recombination and tuning the perovskite film morphology.23–26 By the introduction of QDs, energy-level alignment could be precisely adjusted to expedite charge transfer and suppress carrier recombination as well. For instance, Li's group covered a CdZnSe@ZnSe QD layer on a CsPbI3 all-inorganic perovskite layer to boost carrier transfer kinetics.19 Hence, rational design of a suitable interface layer to synchronously achieve defect passivation and facilitate charge transport is the key challenge.
Beyond this scenario, incorporation of QDs in perovskite films shows intriguing potential in enhancing light harvesting and charge transport abilities. The all-inorganic cubic CsPbI3 (Eg = 1.73 eV) with a broad absorption spectrum and suitable band position is a promising candidate as an interface engineering material.27 It has been proven that the charge carrier mobility of the all-inorganic perovskites is comparable to that of organic–inorganic halide perovskites.28 The broad absorption spectrum and high charge carrier mobility can contribute to the photocurrent of PSCs. Interestingly, the emission spectrum of CdSe QDs has a good overlap with the excitation spectrum of CsPbI3 QDs, so that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can occur between the CdSe QDs and CsPbI3 QDs.29 The effect can maximize the overall optical absorption due to direct energy transfer, which is favorable for the improvement of photocurrent.30 Furthermore, the optimized band gap between CdSe and CsPbI3 is beneficial to the charge transfer process.
Here, we employed hybrid CsPbI3/CdSe QDs (CdSe QDs mixed with CsPbI3 QDs) as the interfacial layer between MAPbI3 and HTL layers, aiming to regulate charge transfer and energy transfer processes. The graded energy level can help to promote the electron and hole flows in opposite directions reaching the lowest conduction band (CB) and highest valence band (VB) respectively between MAPbI3 and HTLs. It is expected that QDs can passivate GBs' defects to reduce charge recombination. More importantly, energy transfer can occur between CdSe and CsPbI3. As a result, PSCs embedded with hybrid QDs display an increased PCE of 17.1%, compared to that of the pristine one (14%). This work establishes a new route for interface engineering toward efficient charge transfer and energy transfer accompanied by high photovoltaic performance.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Oleylamine (OAm, AR), oleic acid (OA, AR), 1-octadecene (ODE, >90%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), n-hexane (95%), caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.99%), dodecanol (DDA, 99.0%), cadmium oxide (CdO, AR) and selenium powder(99.99%) were purchased from Aladdin and used as received.
2.2 Preparation of QDs
CdSe QDs were synthesized by using a ligand exchange method as illustrated in our previous work.33 First, CdO (2 mmol), OA (2 mL), and dodecanol (DDA) (8 mL) were added into a three-neck flask and heated to 150 °C under continuous stirring. The color of the solution mixture transformed into pale yellow as the Cd precursor solution was formed. Second, Se powder (0.8 mmol) and DDA (30 mL) were loaded into another three-necked flask and heated to 200 °C with vigorous stirring to generate orange Se precursor solution. Third, 8 mL of Cd precursor was quickly injected into Se precursor solution with rapid stirring. The reaction was stopped after 8 min and CdSe QDs were purified.
CsPbI3 QDs were synthesized according to a previously reported method.29 First, 0.133 g Cs2CO3, 5 mL of 1-octadecene and 0.416 mL of oleic acid (OA) were mixed in a 50 mL three-necked flask and degassed for 2 h at 50 °C. The mixture was then purged with nitrogen (N2) and heated to 120 °C as the Cs-oleate solution before use. At the same time, 0.173 g PbI2 and 10 mL ODE were placed in another 50 mL three-necked flask, followed by addition of 1 mL of OAm and 10 mL of OA (preheated at 70 °C). After this, the flask was vacuumed at 50 °C until all the PbI2 was dissolved. Then the solution was heated to 170 °C under a N2 atmosphere and 0.8 mL Cs-oleate solution was quickly injected into the flask. After 5–10 s, the flask was transferred to an ice bath. The crude solution of CsPbI3 was precipitated by adding 30 mL of methyl acetate (MeOAc) and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. Next, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was dispersed in n-hexane. This process was repeated three times. The finally obtained precipitate was discarded, while the supernatant was sealed and stored in a glove box.
2.3 Device fabrication
The FTO glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, ethanol and acetone solution and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. A TiO2 compact layer was then coated on the cleaned FTO substrates by spin-coating 0.15 M and 0.3 M titanium acetylacetonate n-butanol solution in succession, followed by annealing on a hotplate at 125 °C for 5 min. After this, the substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, a TiO2 slurry (20 nm) was spin-coated on TiO2 compact layer coated FTO substrates to prepare an electron transport layer.
The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) and PbI2 at a molar ratio of 1:1 in 1 mL of solvent comprising 0.2 mL of DMSO and 0.8 mL of DMF. The perovskite precursor solution was stirred at 60 °C for 6 h in the glove box (<1 ppm O2 and H2O). Then the solution was coated onto the TiO2 by spin-coating at 500 rpm for 5 s and then 4000 rpm for 45 s. Chlorobenzene was dropped on the rotating film after 25 s in the second spin-coating step, and the film was heated on a hot plate at 100 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, different kinds of QDs with the same concentration are spin-coated on the perovskite film. A hole transport layer (72.3 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL lithium-bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl) imide(Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene) was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, a 100 nm-thick gold layer was deposited by thermal evaporation.
2.4 Characterization
The morphologies of all the samples were characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Nova 400 Nano SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100UHRJEOL, Japan). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by using a Philips X'Pert Pro X 135 X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 100 mA) to detect the crystal structures of the samples. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements were performed with a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer. The photovoltaic performances of PSCs were measured with an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) under illumination by a solar simulator (Newport 91160, AM 1.5 G, 100 mV cm−2). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were obtained by using a Zahner Elektrik IM6 electrochemical workstation at a bias potential of Voc in a frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under dark conditions. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded by using a Zahner Photoelectric conversion efficiency tester with a Spectral Product TLSO3 monochromator. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded with a Japan Shimadzu RF-6000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were collected with an Edinburgh Steady state transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS 980).
3. Results and discussion
CdSe and CsPbI3 QDs were synthesized by using the hot-injection method as shown in the Experimental section. The high-resolution transmission electron micrographs (HR-TEM) of these QDs are shown in Fig. 1. A lattice fringe spacing of 0.35 nm shown in the inset of Fig. 1a corresponds to the (111) plane of CdSe. The average size of the CdSe QDs is about 3 nm estimated by particle size division software. The CsPbI3 QDs exhibit a cubic morphology with a lattice fringe spacing of 0.62 nm, matching well with that of the (100) plane of α-CsPbI3 (Fig. 1c). The as-synthesized QD solutions are shown in Fig. 1d.

The ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these QD solutions are shown in Fig. 1e. The absorption edge of CdSe QDs appears at approximately 560 nm, and the PL emission peak is located at 568 nm. As for CsPbI3 QDs, both the absorption edge and the PL emission peaks are observed at around 680 nm, which is in good agreement with the characteristic peaks of CsPbI3 QDs. It is noteworthy that the fluorescence emission peak of CdSe exhibits a good overlap with the absorption spectrum of CsPbI3 QDs indicating that energy transfer can occur between the interface of CdSe/CsPbI3 (Fig. 1f). This energy transfer is defined as FRET, which is embodied by the overlap of the emission spectrum of the donor (CdSe QDs) with the excitation spectrum of the acceptor (CsPbI3 QDs).32 Time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay dynamics of individual QD films and hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QD films are investigated to further elucidate the FRET effect between CdSe QDs and CsPbI3 QDs. Compared with the single QD films, the average lifetime of CdSe QDs decreased from 16.57 ns to 11.53 ns and the average lifetime of CsPbI3 QDs increased from 24.87 ns to 27.01 ns in the hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QD film, which is a prominent feature of the FRET effect (Fig. 1g and h). This means that the energy transfer exists between CdSe QDs and CsPbI3 QDs, which is favorable for optical absorption properties.32
Considering the serious charge recombination caused by the defects at the boundaries of perovskite films, CdSe and CsPbI3 QDs are expected to be located at the boundaries. As shown in Fig. 2b–d, partial QDs are embedded on the GBs of the perovskite film, due to the fact that carbonyl groups on the surface of oleic acid terminated QDs and the weak interaction between Pb and carbonyl groups allows QDs to chemically anchor to GBs.19,33 Furthermore, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analysis confirms the existence of Cs, Cd and Se elements on the surface of the MAPbI3 (Fig. 2e–g). The cross-sectional views of the pristine PSCs and QD incorporated PSCs are shown in Fig. 2h and i. Due to the thin QD layer, it is hard to observe QD layers in the cross-sectional view of the device. After incorporation of QDs, the water contact angle increased from 41.9° to 78.1° (Fig. 2j and k), demonstrating an enhanced hydrophobicity of the perovskite film. In this sense, water entry can be prevented associated with an improvement in the stability of PSCs in air. And the XRD patterns of the pristine and QD incorporated perovskite films are shown in Fig. 2l. The peaks correspond to the reflections from the (110), (112), (220), and (312) planes of MAPbI3, while no characteristic peak of QDs could be detected due to the small amount. To gain more insights into the QD effect, UV-vis and PL spectral measurements were conducted on the pristine and QD incorporated perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 3a, the perovskite with hybrid QDs possesses higher light-harvesting efficiency than that with individual CdSe QDs and CsPbI3 QDs due to the FRET effect. Meanwhile, the electron extraction dynamics were estimated via PL. As can be seen from Fig. 3b, the introduction of QDs did not affect the position of the fluorescence emission peak of perovskite. The QD incorporated perovskite films exhibit stronger PL quenching, implying a more efficient charge transfer process than that of the pristine perovskite film.

In order to characterize the interface alignment between MAPbI3 and QDs, the energy band structure of QDs and perovskites was analyzed. The optical bandgap (Eg) of the samples was estimated from the UV-vis spectra through the equation as follows:(αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg)where α is the absorption coefficient, A is the absorption constant, ν is the frequency and h is Planck's constant. As is illustrated in Fig. 4a and b, the optical bandgap of the CdSe QD and CsPbI3 QD is 2.25 eV and 1.78 eV, respectively. Combining the position of the valence band (Fig. 4c and d), the energy band level diagram of each layer is shown in Fig. 4e. It was found that an energy level gradient is formed by incorporation of hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs, which may accelerate the charge transfer between the perovskite and the HTL, thereby reducing the charge recombination.

To explore the influence of the incorporation of QDs, the photovoltaic performances of devices with various QDs were measured. Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the champion devices fabricated with pristine and hybrid QD embedded perovskites under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs are summarized in Table 1 with the repeatability data listed in Fig. 5e–h. The PSCs incorporated with CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs manifest the best performance with a champion PCE of 16.3%, which is 21% higher than that of the pristine PSC. The improvement is mainly contributed by the increased Jsc and Voc. It can be speculated that the increase in Jsc is mainly due to two reasons. The first is the enhancement of light absorption due to the introduction of QDs, which can be proved from the results of the UV-vis absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 3a. In addition, the stepped energy levels of two QDs and perovskite promote the extraction of holes from perovskite to Spiro-OMeTAD, which is also an important factor in the increase in Jsc. Moreover, two structures of Au/MAPbI3/ETL/FTO and Au/QDs/MAPbI3/ETL/FTO without HTLs are prepared to detect the hole extraction ability of QDs. As shown in Fig. 6a, the device with QDs shows higher Jsc and Voc than the device without QDs. The increase in photocurrent can prove that QDs do play a role in increasing light absorption ability. And the increase in Voc can be ascribed to the introduction of QDs to accelerate the extraction of holes and the passivated defects at the surface of the perovskite film, which reduces the recombination probability of carriers. The monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were employed to estimate the ratio of extracted electrons to incident photons at a given wavelength. As compared to the pristine PSC, IPCE values of QD incorporated PSCs increase in the range below 770 nm (Fig. 5b). In addition, the hybrid QD incorporated PSC exhibits the highest IPCE values with the integrated photocurrent in line with the Jsc obtained from J–V curves. The results prove that hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs could help enhance light utilization efficiency by virtue of FRET.

The J–V curve test of the forward and reverse scan of the champion devices was conducted to explore the effect of the introduction of QDs on the hysteresis effect of PSCs. The forward and reverse scans of the two devices were conducted at the same scan rate. As shown in Fig. 6b, the device with QDs exhibits less hysteresis than the device without QDs, which may be caused by the accelerated extraction of holes by the QDs thus reducing the accumulation of charge at the interface, along with the reduced interface loss in the transport path of carriers. The stability is a concern for the perovskite research. The stability of the PSC devices with and without the QDs is carefully examined with the results shown in Fig. 6c and d, respectively. Note that when they were not being measured, the devices were kept in air. It can be found that compared with devices without QDs, devices with QDs show better stability, which should be attributed to the fact that the QD layer weakens the affinity of the perovskite film to water, which is consistent with the results of the contact angle.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out to illustrate the electron recombination kinetics of the PSCs. The Nyquist plots are given in Fig. 5c. The higher frequency semicircle is assigned to the hole transport and extraction in the cathode (Au) which is too small to recognize, while the low frequency range represents the charge recombination resistance (Rrec).34 The reduced charge recombination induced by the incorporation of QDs is a reasonable interpretation for the improved Voc. The QDs situated at the boundaries of perovskite can reduce the defects of the perovskite film, leading to a decrease in non-radiative recombination channels. The hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QD incorporated PSC exhibits the largest recombination resistance, which can be ascribed to the decreased energy difference and energy loss. TRPL decay dynamics of the FTO/MAPbI3/QDs at an emission wavelength of 720 nm are presented in Fig. 6d. The electron lifetime (τ) of the samples was obtained by fitting the second-order exponential of the curve with the results shown in Table 2. Typically, the fast lifetime (τ1) is ascribed to the charge injection efficiency from perovskites into the adjacent charge extraction layer, whereas the long lifetime (τ2) is associated with the radiative decay within the semiconductor.35 Hence, the PL decay time τ1 of MAPbI3 is 3.55 ns, and the τ2 of MAPbI3 is 8.32 ns. When QDs are incorporated in the perovskite layer, the τ1 decreased to 2.69 ns. This implies the optimized energy level structure between MAPbI3 and HTLs, thus accelerating charge extraction and charge transfer processes.36 The increase of τ2 indicates the longer electron lifetime in the perovskite film, owing to the QD passivation. Based on the above statement, a mechanism for the enhancement of photovoltaic performance is proposed as illustrated in Fig. 7. The hybrid QDs allow the efficient FRET to enhance the light harvesting efficiency in the visible light region. And the graded energy level structure formed by hybrid QDs promotes the electron and hole flows in opposite directions reaching the lowest conduction band (CB) and highest valence band (VB) respectively between MAPbI3 and HTLs, resulting in fast charge transfer dynamics.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we employed hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs as an interface layer between the perovskite film and the hole transport layer (HTL) to modify the interface. Benefitting from the passivation effect and optimized energy level structure, the Voc increased from 0.943 V to 0.976 V. At the same time, the FRET effect of hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs leads to the enhanced light harvesting efficiency associated with the improved Jsc of the PSCs. Finally, the PCE of PSCs incorporated with hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs reaches 17.1%, which is 22% higher than that of the pristine PSCs. According to the systematic characterization experiments, it is verified that QDs distributed on the surface of perovskite films serve not only as charge transport bridges but also as passivation materials. By reducing defects on the boundaries and controlling the energy level structure of the interface, non-radiative recombination is suppressed and charge transfer is promoted. The design of hybrid CdSe/CsPbI3 QDs provides an alternative method to regulate charge transfer and energy transfer processes in PSCs simultaneously.
