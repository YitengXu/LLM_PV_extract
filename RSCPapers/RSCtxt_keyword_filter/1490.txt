    , Accepted 28th March 2020First published on 30th March 2020AbstractIn recent years, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has become an attractive approach for the production of renewable hydrogen by utilizing solar energy. Achieving high-efficiency hydrogen production via solar water splitting requires a semiconductor with a suitable band gap. Generally, a wide band gap results in an ideal open-circuit voltage for solar water splitting devices, but it makes the devices incapable of absorbing and utilizing the near-infrared (NIR) portion of sunlight. To further improve the utilization efficiency for solar energy, we employ rationally designed core–shell or core–shell–shell structured upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as “nanotransducers” that enable the conversion of NIR light into visible light; thus, NIR light can be indirectly absorbed by visible light-responsive photocathodes. Upon doping with different lanthanides, our prepared UCNPs gain the ability to convert NIR light (980 nm) into blue, green, or red light. Although the Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) photocathode shows an excellent response to visible light, it is almost unable to absorb NIR light beyond 860 nm. After addition of UCNPs into the buffer solution, the CZTS-based photocathode exhibits an appreciable photocurrent density of −4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE under 980 nm irradiation. This work demonstrates that the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the photoelectrode can be further boosted with the involvement of UCNPs as a NIR energy converter.
Confronted with the threat of energy crisis, it is of great importance to find clean and sustainable energy sources. Hydrogen is considered an environmentally friendly and easily stored energy source, and thus has received increasing attention in recent years. Solar water splitting has become the most promising strategy for producing hydrogen since Fujishima and Honda published the TiO2 photocatalytic decomposition of water in 1972.1 After decades of development, most of the photocathodes (such as TiO2,2–4 Cu2O,5,6 Cu2InGaS4,7–9 Cu2ZnSnS4,10,11 and Sb2Se3 (ref. 12 and 13)) have been applied to solar water splitting. Most of them absorb and utilize only UV and visible light from sunlight. The visible light region accounts for approximately 50% of the total solar radiation energy, and the ultraviolet region is approximately 7% of the total. The infrared (IR) region accounts for the rest, which accounts for up to approximately 43%. Therefore, the inability to use IR light results in a considerable waste of solar energy. How to make full use of solar energy, especially IR light, is a major challenge but an extremely meaningful pursuit.
Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is an inexpensive, nontoxic photoabsorber layer and has an appreciable band gap (1.5 eV). In previous studies, most researchers focused on the properties of the absorbing material itself, optimizing the photocathode structure, such as by doping, buffer layer changes, and protective layer optimization. The first report on a CZTS-based photocathode for hydrogen production was presented by Yokoyama et al.14 They claimed that the Pt/TiO2/CdS/CZTS photocathode is very suitable for efficient solar water splitting. Subsequently, Rovelli et al. found that adding oxide coatings could enhance the durability of the photocathode.15 Moreover, Ma and Wang et al. reported that the deposition of a CZTS film onto a Mo mesh also efficiently generated a PEC photocurrent for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation.16 An appreciable photocurrent density of −11 mA cm−2 (0 VRHE) was reported by Yang et al. using a stacked Pt/TiO2/CdS/CZTS electrode, but the photocurrent of this electrode exhibited obvious degradation within 1 hour.17 Previously, we found that adding an In2S3 layer onto CdS/CZTS could efficiently improve the stability of its solar water splitting properties; however, the photocurrent still decreased within 3 hours.10 Subsequently, we found that HfO2 has a great protective effect on the photoelectrode, showing that the current is not attenuated for 10 hours and achieves a record efficiency of 2.7%.18 Recently, Tay et al. achieved 4% conversion efficiency for largely Cd-doped CZTS.19 The aforementioned research mainly focused on the CZTS-based photoelectric device itself, which exhibits efficient absorption ranging from UV to visible light but fails to absorb IR light. In other photoelectrode devices, upconversion (UC) materials are used to convert NIR light into visible light. For example, Zhang et al. applied NaYF4:Yb,Er UC nanocrystals on the surface of hematite to obtain the corresponding response for a 980 nm laser.20 Chen et al. attempted to embed Er3+/Yb3+-codoped NaYF4 UCNPs into CdTe quantum dot (QD)-sensitized ZnO nanorod arrays to compose a NIR-driven PEC cell.21 Then, Kang's group reported that the electrodeposition of carbon QD UC particles on a CdSe/TiO2 nanorod-based photoelectrode enabled the utilization of NIR light.22 In 2019, Choi et al. used a luminescent back reflector (LBR) capable of photon UC to improve the light harvesting capabilities of Mo:BiVO4 photoelectrodes.23 It should be very interesting to investigate the NIR light photoresponse or NIR-driven solar water splitting properties of CZTS-based photocathodes upon introduction of UCNPs, and the utilization of NIR light shall have significant value for the improvement of the photoelectrochemical properties of CZTS-based photocathodes. However, there are no reports about the abovementioned point on the CZTS-based photocathode. We provide the first investigation of NIR light-driven solar water splitting on a CZTS-based photocathode by means of UCNPs, including a series of tentative explorations.
In this work, we first realized the NIR driven water splitting with a Cu2ZnSnS4-based photoelectrode by converting NIR light into green light via upconversion nanoparticles. This work represents the utilization potential of NIR even MIR or FIR for the CZTS based photocathode. Our study gives a new experimental route to expend the utilization of long or short wavelength lights for the CZTS photocathode. The results also indicated that the CZTS photoelectrode has substantial increment in potential for solar water splitting or photocatalytic efficiency with the help of UCNPs; further research studies are ongoing.
The CZTS photoabsorber layer used in this study was prepared by spray pyrolysis as reported in our previous studies.18,24 The CdS layer was deposited under the CZTS film by chemical bath deposition. Pt catalysts were photoelectrochemically deposited under the CZTS/CdS-based photocathode. Fig. S1† shows the XRD and Raman spectra of the CZTS film, which are consistent with previous reports.
Three types of lanthanide-doped UCNPs with well-designed core–shell or core–shell–shell structures, which enable the maximization of their UC performance, were synthesized to provide three different colors of light, namely, blue, green, and red. Their corresponding structures are denoted as NaYF4@NaYbF4:Tm1%@NaYF4, NaYF4:Yb20%/Er2%@NaYF4, and NaYbF4:Er60%@NaYF4, respectively. These UCNPs were all passivated with an inert shell of NaYF4, as it can significantly minimize the surface quenching effect, thus remarkably enhancing their UC efficiency. Initially, these UCNPs were prepared using oleic acid as a surface ligand, and thus, they were all hydrophobic. We then converted these hydrophobic groups into hydrophilic ones by means of a Tween 20 coating.25Fig. 1a–c shows the TEM images and corresponding size distribution of the above three samples modified with Tween 20. From the TEM images, we can see that the three as-synthesized samples are highly uniform, with average sizes of 24.4 ± 1.6, 28.0 ± 1.4, and 27.8 ± 1.3 nm, respectively. Fig. 1d shows the XRD patterns of the three samples. Their XRD results are all in good agreement with standard JCPDS no. 16-0334, indicating that they are all hexagonal-phase NaYF4. Therefore, the TEM images and XRD results confirm that our UCNPs applied in the following photoelectrocatalytic experiment were prepared with high quality.

(d) The corresponding XRD patterns of the above samples. The diffraction pattern at the bottom is the standard pattern of β-phase NaYF4 (JCPDS 16-0334). 
To maximize the UC efficiency, UCNPs that emit blue light were designed as a core–shell–shell structure of NaYF4@NaYbF4:Tm1%@NaYF4 as such a structure renders the Tm3+ emission highly efficient.26 UCNPs that generate green and red emissions were constructed based on core–shell structures, and their structures are denoted as NaYF4:Yb20%/Er2%@NaYF4 and NaYbF4:Er60%@NaYF4, respectively. The UC emission spectra of the three samples dispersed in water under 980 nm laser excitation are exhibited in Fig. 2, and the inset shows their corresponding luminescence photographs. In brief, the blue emission is ascribed to the 1D2 → 3F4 (450 nm) and the 1G4 → 3H6 (475 nm) transitions of Tm3+ ions; the green emission is attributed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (520 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (543 nm) transitions of Er3+ ions; the red emission is generated from the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (660 nm) transition of Er3+ ions. More detailed information about their UC mechanisms can be found in Fig. S2.† It should be emphasized that the red-to-green (R/G) ratio of Er3+ emission can be readily manipulated by simply varying the doping contents of Er3+ and Yb3+, which takes advantage of the cross-relaxation effect of Er3+ ions and the energy back transfer (EBT) process from Er3+ to Yb3+.27,28

Fig. 3 shows a schematic diagram of the use of UCNPs for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The generated photocurrent demonstrated that 980 nm light converted to visible light via the UCNPs was absorbed by the photocathode to excite electron–hole pairs to drive the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction.

We performed a set of linear-sweep voltammetry measurements for the PEC, as shown in Fig. 4a, which was composed of CZTS/CdS/Pt as the photocathode, a platinum plate as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode under 980 nm laser irradiation with a power density of 5000 mW cm−2. We observed that there were approximately −4 mA cm−2, −2 mA cm−2 and −1.5 mA cm−2 of current at 0 VRHE when using green-, blue- and red-emitting UCNPs. The onset potential did not change compared to that of sun-light irradiation, and both were 0.6 VRHE. This finding shows that the visible light from the UC process can be absorbed by our photocathode to produce a good PEC effect. From the performance test of the UCNPs described above, we can observe that the conversion efficiency for green light to near-infrared light is the highest in UCNPs. Moreover, CZTS has the best photoelectric conversion efficiency for light of 400–500 nm,18 which leads to the best photoelectric response of the CZTS photocathode in the buffer solution containing green light emitting UCNPs, reaching −4 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE. The corresponding currents for the cases of blue and red light emitting UCNPs are smaller.
 Fig. 4  (a) Current density–potential curves of CZTS/CdS/Pt photocathodes in a 0.2 mol dm−3 Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 solution (pH 6.5), in which different types of UCNPs were added under chopped 980 nm laser irradiation at a power density of 5000 mW cm−2. (b) Current density of the CZTS electrodes was measured over the duration of the experiments, in which the 980 nm laser was turned on and off. 
In Fig. 4b, the current density of the CZTS/CdS/Pt electrodes was measured over a 60 s duration, which is basically the same as that in the linear-sweep voltammogram. With the help of the UCNPs, 980 nm wavelength light that could not be directly absorbed by the photoelectrode was now able to be absorbed by the photoelectrode. For comparison, we tested the performance of the photoelectrode under the same laser irradiation in a buffer solution without the involvement of UCNPs. The CZTS photocathode did not absorb any NIR light due to its bandgap value of 1.45 eV because of which we did not observed any obvious photo-response currents of the CZTS photocathode under NIR light in the solution without UCNPs (Fig. S3 in ESI†). But obvious photo-response current was detected from the same CZTS photocathode in the solution with UNCPs (Fig. 4b), which means the CZTS photocathode has obvious absorption properties for the light that is converted by UCNPs from NIR light. CZTS showed no PEC response without UCNPs under 980 nm laser irradiation. Furthermore, when we increased the intensity of the laser to 5000 mW cm−2, we obtained a maximum photocurrent density of −9 mA cm−2 (Fig. S4†). Different UCNPs have different UC performances, resulting in different output light intensities and wavelengths. Eventually, the photocathode produces different photocurrents. We also tested the impedance values of the same photoelectrode in different UCNP buffer solutions (Fig. S5†). In the absence of environmental changes (such as bubble generation and attachment), a strong photocurrent response will correspond to low photocathode resistance.12,29 It is obvious that the external resistance of the photoelectrode in the green light conversion material is the smallest, which also corresponds to the highest conversion efficiency in the green light region by the UCNPs and the best absorption of green light by the CZTS photocathode, resulting in the largest photocurrent.
Furthermore, we tested the hydrogen production of the CZTS photocathode under 980 nm laser irradiation. The detection and quantification of hydrogen is very necessary for water splitting.30–33 As shown in Fig. 5a, 16 μmol of hydrogen was produced in 3 hours by this device. H2 monotonically accumulated at a constant rate of 0.09 μmol min−1. It can be concluded that the integral of the photocurrent corresponds to the amount of hydrogen and oxygen production, and the Ferrari efficiency is higher than 90% (determined from the ratio of the H2 evolution rate to e−/2). We can find that the photocurrent dropped by 50% within 3 hours from Fig. 5b. After 3 hours of testing, we clearly observed damage to the photocathode. The activity decay of the CZTS based photocathode is caused by the photocorrosion of the CdS buffer layer and the ablation from the NIR laser. Adding appropriate concentrations of UCNPs into the buffer solution or lowering the power of the NIR laser and adjusting the incidence angle of the NIR laser may decrease or avoid laser ablation. Although high-intensity lasers damage the photocathode, the rate of photocurrent decay is still at an acceptable level.

This is the first report of a CZTS-based photocathode using a buffer solution containing UCNPs to perform water splitting reactions under NIR light irradiation. The obtained appreciable photocurrent density of −4 mA cm−2 and the onset potential of 0.6 VRHE demonstrate the promising potential of the CZTS photocathode for water splitting under NIR light. The presence of UCNPs in the solution efficiently expanded the utilization efficiency of the CZTS photocathode under NIR light. We believe that introducing UC materials as energy converters will greatly improve the photocatalytic water splitting efficiency of the CZTS-based photocathode.
In summary, we have demonstrated that it is completely feasible to convert NIR light into visible light for photoelectrochemical water splitting using UCNPs as “nanotransducers”. This simple and novel approach has the potential to further improve sunlight utilization efficiency for solar water splitting or other photocatalytic devices. The CZTS/CdS/Pt photocathode generated an appreciable photocurrent density of −4 mA cm−2 and an onset potential of 0.6 VRHE under 5000 mW cm−2 light irradiation. It is expected that the NIR-driven water splitting efficiency of the CZTS based photocathode will be largely enhanced after a series of improvements in UC efficiency and band limitations of the UCNPs. We believed that the transformation and utilization of the infrared part of sunlight is an emerging direction that is worth investigating and is of great significance for boosting the solar light utilization efficiency of the CZTS photocathode for solar water splitting.
