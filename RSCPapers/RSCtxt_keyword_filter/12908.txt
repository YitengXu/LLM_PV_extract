Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their advantages of low cost, light weight and their capability to be fabricated into flexible and semitransparent devices. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs must be further improved for their future application. The photovoltaic materials in the active layer and the electrode buffer layers are the most important materials for improving the PCE and stability of PSCs, and the solution processable electrode buffer layer materials are desirable for the preparation of PSCs by low cost printing techniques. In this paper, we reviewed the recent progress in solution processable anode and cathode buffer layer materials based on metal oxides and metal chelates in conventional and inverted PSCs. The solution processable electrode buffer layers discussed in this paper include the cathode buffer layers of TiO2, ZnO, and some transition metal chelates (TIPD, TOPD, ZrAcac, etc.) and the anode buffer layers of NiO, MoO3, V2O5, WO3, ReOx, etc. The preparation methods, electronic energy levels and photovoltaic performance of the electrode buffer layers are described in detail for the reference of the readers.

1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained considerable attention due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, scalability and compatibility with roll-to-roll manufacturing.1–4 A bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure is usually adopted to construct a nanoscale interpenetrating network of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor for the active layer in PSCs.5–8 In recent years, the performance of PSCs has been greatly improved by designing new photovoltaic materials,9–13 optimizing device fabrication conditions,14 developing new device structures15 and engineering contact interfaces.16–25 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 9% for single-junction PSCs,12,16 and higher than 10% for tandem26 PSCs were achieved. The molecular structures of the classic polymer donors and fullerene acceptors used in PSCs are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively.

1.1 Operating principles of conventional and inverted PSCs
PSCs can be divided into conventional (Fig. 3a) and inverted (Fig. 3b) architectures according to the charge flow direction. In conventional BHJ PSCs, a blended photoactive layer of a conjugated polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor is sandwiched between a modified transparent anode and a low work function (WF) metal cathode. Fig. 3c illustrates the energy level and the main charge processes (exciton generation, charge separation, charge transportation and charge collection) in a conventional BHJ PSC. When light irradiates the photoactive layer of the PSC through the transparent electrode, the photo-generated excitons diffuse towards and dissociate at the donor/acceptor interface into electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor material, and holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor material. Interface materials with proper WF values (electronic energy levels) matching the electronic energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer of PSCs can selectively enhance the collection efficiency of holes on the anode and electrons on the cathode.

In the conventional structure, the low-work-function metal is susceptible to degradation by oxygen and moisture, and the anode buffer layer (PEDOT:PSS) is acidic and corrosive to the ITO electrode. Therefore, the concept of inverted polymer solar cells (see Fig. 3b) has been introduced into PSCs to improve their long term stability.27,28 In inverted devices, the polarity of charge collection and charge flow direction are opposite to those in conventional devices, as shown in Fig. 3d. The bottom transparent ITO electrode, modified by low WF materials, serves as the cathode, whereas a high-work-function metal (such as Au, Ag, or Al), combined with a stable metal oxide hole-collection layer (HCL), is used as the top anode. The use of an air stable HCL and a metal top anode enables the inverted PSCs to exhibit higher environmental stability. Through device optimization, inverted PSCs can show higher power conversion efficiencies than conventional solar cells due to the vertical phase separation between the donor and the acceptor.16,17,29,30
In order to effectively collect holes and electrons at the anode and cathode, respectively, the contact barrier at the cathode/acceptor and anode/donor interfaces must be effectively reduced to form a good ohmic contact. The properties of the contacts at both interfaces strongly limit the maximum open-circuit voltage (Voc) value. Non-ohmic contacts due to a mismatch of the electrode WF with the energy level of the donor or acceptor materials in the active layer could lead to a decrease in Voc. Because the WF of the commonly used cathode material, such as Al, does not match the LUMO of the acceptor, a good ohmic contact cannot be formed with the active layer.31–33 Moreover, at the anode side, the WF of the transparent conducting electrode ITO is ∼4.7 eV, which cannot form an ohmic contact with the commonly used donor or acceptor materials in PSCs. In conventional PSCs, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)34,35 is the commonly used anode buffer layer, and Ca capped with Al is the most commonly used metal electrode. However, the acidity of PEDOT:PSS can corrode the ITO electrode, and the low WF metals are vulnerable to oxygen and water, causing stability problems in PSCs.36–40 Moreover, the reactivity of the hot metal atoms during the thermal evaporation of the cathode could lead to chemical reactions with the photoactive layer and interdiffusion to the BHJ layer/metal interface.41,42 Therefore, it is desirable to develop alternative interfacial materials with high stability and good carrier collection ability to replace PEDOT:PSS and low WF metals.
1.2 Energy level of the buffer layers
Recent studies indicate that the interfacial buffer layers significantly influence both the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. A suitable buffer layer could not only adjust the energetic barrier height between the active layer and the electrodes but could also increase the selectivity of the corresponding electrode for holes and electrons. From the viewpoint of thermodynamics, the electron affinity (EA) and ionization potential (IP) of the buffer layer relative to the electron or hole transport energies of the active layer could result in the preferential collection of electrons or holes.21 From the viewpoint of kinetics, the buffer layer could selectively enhance the collection rate of the electrons over the holes, or vice versa.43 In addition, the buffer layers could improve the rectification ratio of the devices44–47 and also play an important role in balancing the hole and electron collection rates at both corresponding electrodes.48,49 Therefore, the transportation and collection of either carrier type can be suppressed or enhanced through the use of appropriate buffer layers, as long as the energy level of the buffer layer matches the transport of holes (or electrons) and has a large barrier for the injection of electrons (or holes) into the material.
The ideal anode/cathode buffer layer should meet the following requirements: (1) can make good ohmic contact with the donor/acceptor materials in the active layer; (2) has good hole/electron transport properties; (3) possesses appropriate IP and EA values to enhance the selectivity of holes for the anode and electrons for the cathode. Several classes of electrode buffer layers for PSCs, including conducting polymers, crosslinkable interfacial layers,10,50–52 conjugated electrolytes,53–55 metal salts,27,56–59 metal oxides28,43,60–65 and transition metal chelates,24,66–70 have been extensively studied in the past few years, and some of them have been reviewed in previous articles.18,20,21,71,72 Solution-processable metal oxides and metal chelates have been proven to be attractive substitutes for traditional interface materials as either hole or electron collection layers due to their advantages of environmental stability, high transparency and high carrier mobility.
The WF of the interfacial material is the key criterion for its effectiveness as a HCL or ECL. The cathode buffer layer should possess a low WF value, while the anode buffer layer should have a high WF value. In addition, the energy level alignment at the buffer layer/organic semiconductor interface is also very important. The Fermi level-pinning transition has been proved to be a successful model for organic/metal and organic/organic interfaces.73–77 As confirmed by the investigation of a series of metal oxide/organic semiconductor systems using photoemission spectroscopy,78,79 the measured HOMO edge offset (ΔEH) of monolayer C60 films correlates highly with the WF (Φsub) of the metal oxide substrate. As shown in Fig. 4, according to the relative position of the WF of the metal oxides and the organic EA and IP, the curve of ΔEH against Φsub can be divided into three distinct regions: (1) if the WF of the metal oxide is located between the IP and EA of the organic material, the metal oxide/organic interface corresponds to nonreactive or weakly interacting interfaces. In this condition, the ΔEH is linearly proportional to the WF of the metal oxide, and follows the Schottky–Mott rule;80 (2) if the WF of the metal oxide is located below the IP of the organic material, the Fermi level will be pinned to the HOMO level of the organic material; (3) conversely, if the WF of the metal oxide is located above the EA of the organic material, the LUMO level of the organic material will be pinned to the Fermi level.78 Here, “pinning” means that as long as the WF of the metal oxide exceeds a certain threshold value, determined by the particular organic material, the Fermi level of the metal oxide will always align with the HOMO or LUMO of the organic material. This “pinning” behavior leads to the lowest charge injection/collection barrier for optoelectronic devices, and provides a theoretical basis for the selection of the electrode modification material. The reason for the occurrence of the “pinning” behavior is that once the WF of the metal oxide is located above the LUMO or below the HOMO of the organic material, the electronic situation is in a nonequilibrium state. In order to achieve equilibrium, charges will transfer across the interface, resulting in a shift in the vacuum level. The ionized organic molecules will be thermodynamically stabilized due to the coupling between the molecular ionization processes and the Fermi energy of the electrode.78,79,81 This means that the fundamental driving force of energy level alignment is the electron chemical–potential equilibrium at the interfaces, and is governed by the relative position of the WF of the metal oxide and the organic HOMO/LUMO levels.73,74,79

Three regimes can be identified. The energy positions of key parameters in each scenario are shown in the schematics beside each region. Note that these inset schematics are not drawn to scale.78 
However, wild inconsistencies exist in the reported energy level (EA, IP and WF) values for the same transition metal oxides prepared through different procedures. In general, it is difficult to obtain stoichiometric metal oxides due to atmospheric gas absorption and the complexity of the surface chemical reactions. The change in surface chemistry can alter the surface energy levels. Therefore, the absolute WF reported in literature may not be applicable to all situations. Over the past years, a great deal of research has been performed to understand the correlation between the chemical/structural factors and the WFs of the metal oxides. The WFs of the transition metal oxides are directly related to their average cation oxidation states,80 as shown in Fig. 5. Both the introduction of oxygen deficiency and hydrogenation reduction can result in changes in the average cation oxidation state, which corresponds to the occupation of high density of states lying within the forbidden gap.82 However, these two methods show different effects on the electronic structure of the metal oxides. In general, an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration leads to decreased average cation oxidation states, lower electronegativity and increased valence donor states,81,83 which are the main reasons for the reduction in the WF. On the other hand, hydrogen reduction leads to the appearance of a high density of occupied gap states near the Fermi level, while maintaining a high WF for a high degree of reduction.82,84,85

Some surface treatment methods, such as oxygen plasma or UV-ozone (UVO) treatment, have been adopted to modulate the WF of the metal oxides by changing the chemical composition of the surfaces.43,86,87Fig. 6 shows the energy levels of the metal oxides and metal chelates prepared using different methods. Using a self-assembled monolayer of molecules with a dipole moment is another simple and attractive approach to tailor the WF of the pristine metal or metal oxide surfaces.88–91Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the schematic energy levels induced by the introduction of a dipolar monolayer between the organic film and a metal or metal oxide substrate. The dipolar monolayer is often formed by chemical bonding between the substrate and the functional groups of the molecules, which results in a highly ordered thin layer with a dipole in the desired direction. The dipolar monolayer leads to a permanent shift of the vacuum level at the interface, which increases or decreases the WF at the interface depending on the direction of the dipole.88,90–92 If the bonds between the molecules and the metal oxide surface result in a dipole moment with the negative pole pointing toward the metal oxide surface, the WF decreases, as shown in Fig. 7a. The WF increases when the molecular dipole moment orientates in the opposite direction, as shown in Fig. 7c. This change in the WF modifies the charge collection barrier, and can lead to Fermi level pinning as soon as the pinning regime is reached. However, in a multilayer regime, dimerization of the dipolar molecules increases; therefore, the WF will not be further affected, due to the antiparallel alignment of neighboring molecular dipole moments.89 The WF then tends to reach a saturated value. It has also been demonstrated that the interface dipole is limited by the occurrence of Fermi level pinning behavior.

 Fig. 7  Energy level alignment at an ideal metal oxide–organic interface (ELC) can be tuned by introducing a dipolar layer at the surface of the metal oxide before depositing the organic layer. The dipole introduces an electrostatic potential shift to charges crossing the interface, shifting the vacuum level between the metal oxide and organic material. The vacuum level shift will either (a) decrease or (c) increase the WF of the metal oxide surface compared to (b) its unmodified state. The shift in WF can be measured as a contact potential difference.88 
1.3 Optical properties of the buffer layers
When a light beam irradiates through a transparent electrode on the surface of a photoactive layer, light reflection, absorption, scattering and transmission will occur. In general, the light transmission through the device can be ignored, because the reflective metal back contact is much thicker than the penetration depth of light at these wavelengths.92 For a homogeneous sample with smooth parallel surfaces, the scattering can be ignored. Therefore, the sum of the reflection and absorption can be considered to be 100% for the incident light. For a multilayered PSC, only the light absorbed by the photoactive layer can possibly generate excitons, and this contributes to improvements in efficiency. Therefore, the optical properties (transmission, reflection and absorption) of the electrode buffer layer will significantly affect the light absorption of the photoactive layer. The absorption of the buffer layer will compete with that of the photoactive layer. Only the photons with energy lower than the band gap of the buffer layer can be effectively absorbed by the photoactive layer. Fortunately, the commonly used metal compounds in PSCs generally possess large band gaps, greater than 3 eV, and therefore show good optical transparency in the visible and near infrared regions, as shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Optical transmittance of a solution processed MoOx layer and the PEDOT:PSS layer on ITO glass.93 
The photocurrent is mainly determined by the fractional number of absorbed photons in the active layer and the internal quantum efficiency, defined by the fraction of collected carriers per absorbed photon. Increasing the thickness of the photoactive layer is the simplest approach to increase light absorption for the photoactive layer. However, the thicker photoactive layer results in increased internal series resistance, thereby decreasing efficiency due to the relatively low charge mobility in the organic films. Therefore, maximizing the photon absorption for a photoactive layer without increasing the thickness is crucial to the enhancement of the photocurrent. As the incoming light travels through a device, it will pass all the functional films (glass substrate, transparent electrode, photoactive layer, electrode modification layers) and finally reach the mirror metal electrode, where the light is reflected for a second pass through the device. Therefore, the distribution of the optical field fluctuates within the multilayered cell. The light intensity at the metal surface is zero, and the distribution of the optical intensity maximum depends on the light wavelength.94 In the optimal situation, the maximum light intensity should be distributed in the photoactive layer while keeping the thickness fixed. Therefore, an “optical spacer” is introduced in PSCs to realize this objective. The optical spacer concept means that a judicious choice of spacer thickness and index of refraction could cause the position of the maximum intensity to fall within the photoactive layer and consequently, increase the overall light absorption.95 Due to the different optical properties (extinction coefficient and refractive index) of the functional films (Fig. 9) and the interference of the incoming light with reflections from the metal and other interfaces, the modeling of optical intensity distribution involves multiple reflections. Pettersson et al. simulated the spatial optical field distribution in the different device stacks, and the modeling results are in good agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 9).96,97 As a consequence, the overall absorption and photocurrent can be maximized by introducing an optical spacer. For optical spacers, the desired refractive index is essential to the redistribution of the maximum light intensity within the device. Moreover, the spacer cannot compete with the photoactive layer in light absorption. Metal compounds, such as TiOx, ZnO, V2O5 and ZrAcac have been proved to fulfill these requirements. It is worth noting that the optical spacer effect is determined not only by the optical properties and thickness of the optical spacer but also by their good match with all the functional layers involved in the device.95,96,98
 Fig. 9  Optical constants (n and k are the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, respectively) for PCPDTBT:PC70BM with a 1/3 weight ratio processed with 3 vol% DIO (filled black squares), MoO3 (filled red triangles), TiO2 (open green circles) and PEDOT:PSS CLEVIOS AI4083 (open blue triangles).97 
The optical spacer effect of TiOx has been verified for PSCs made with several different donor–acceptor systems, such as P3HT:PC60BM99 and PCDTBT:PC70BM.95,100 Park et al. introduced ∼10 nm solution processed TiOx as an optical spacer and hole blocker between the ∼80 nm PCDTBT:PC70BM BHJ layer and the Al cathode.100 A substantial enhancement in absorption and consequent higher photocurrent and input photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) throughout the visible range are realized upon the introduction of a TiOx buffer layer. More notably, nearly 100% internal quantum efficiency is reached, which means that nearly every absorbed photon is separated into a pair of charge carriers, and all the separated charges are collected by the electrodes. Similar results are achieved for P3HT:PC60BM-based devices in which ∼30 nm TiOx is used as an optical spacer.99 Direct observation of a ∼40% enhancement in Jsc and ∼50% enhancement in device efficiency is realized in the J–V curve under monochromatic illumination at a wavelength of 532 nm. The increased photocurrent is mainly ascribed to the improved matching of the spatial light intensity distribution, induced by the optical spacer effect, which results in higher optical absorption by the P3HT:PC60BM layer. However, from the optical simulation of organic solar cells with various band gaps, Andersson et al. proposed that when the thickness of the photoactive layer is already optimized, the introduction of an optical spacer shows no beneficial effect on the performance of the device.101 Therefore, organic solar cells where the photoactive film thickness is limited by a low charge carrier mobility can benefit from an optical spacer layer. This is consistent with the dependence of the optical spacer effect on the thickness of the photoactive layer of the device.98
Similar results were achieved by using ZnO as an optical spacer,102,103 where ∼40 nm ZnO was introduced between the photoactive layer and the Li/Al cathode. This can be seen from the modeling of the optical electric field distribution, as shown in Fig. 10. For the device without an optical spacer, the maximum optical electrical fields is located right outside the photoactive layer, while upon insertion of a ZnO layer, the active layer is placed in a more favorable position within the optical electric field. The maximum optical electrical field shifts into the photoactive layer, which is predicted to result in enhanced light absorption. The absorption enhancement induced by the ZnO optical spacer significantly depends on the thickness of the photoactive layer. For the device with a thicker photoactive layer, the interference effect between the incident and reflected light is suppressed because most of the incident light is absorbed. Contrastingly, the optical spacer effect is more pronounced for devices with a thinner photoactive layer (<60 nm), which could indeed lead to an increase in the absorption. The results are consistent with the findings for TiOx optical spacers. Recently, researchers also reported the use of ZnO as an optical spacer for small-molecule organic solar cells.104 Inserting a ZnO optical spacer between the active layer and the metal electrode enables the active layer to harvest more light, thus increasing the photocurrent.
 Fig. 10  Calculated optical electric fields for light of different wavelengths in devices with a 40 nm thick active layer (a) without and (b) with a 39 nm ZnO spacer.102 
In recent studies, it has been found that several other metal compounds, such as ZrAcac24 and ReOx105 can also act as optical spacers to manipulate the optical interference within the active layer.
1.4 Processing methods of the buffer layers
In earlier studies, some metal compound buffer layers (such as Cs2CO3, MoO3, and V2O5) were mainly prepared through vacuum deposition methods, which have the advantage of a wide choice of substrates, good control of film thickness and smooth film morphology. However, vacuum-based techniques, such as thermal evaporation, electron-beam evaporation, and hot filament vapor deposition require expensive and complex vacuum equipment, which limits their utility in low-cost, large-area device fabrication. Therefore, solution-processable electrode modification materials are desirable for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Among these, solution processable metal oxides and metal chelates, bearing the advantages of low cost and high stability, are promising electrode buffer layers for conventional and inverted PSCs. Therefore, it is most important to introduce the solution processing methods, including the choice of precursors and chemical reactions during post-treatment, for preparing these buffer layers.

Fig. 11 shows a flow chart of the typical solution processing routes for the preparation of the buffer layers. The flow chart includes starting materials (precursors), the preparation of precursor solutions (ink-formation), spin-coating of the precursor solution on the substrate to form the film (film-deposition) and post-treatment (thermo-annealing, etc.).
 Fig. 11  Flow chart of typical solution processing routes for the preparation of metal compound buffer layers. 
Solution-processed metal oxide buffer layers can be prepared by a sol–gel process or nano-particle (NPs) dispersion. For a metal oxide layer derived from NPs dispersion, a potential limitation is that the NPs tend to aggregate into larger units with a large size of ∼100 nm, which results in rough film. This rough surface is unfavorable to the formation of an upper photoactive layer with good morphology, and the large aggregates may act as the source of electrical shorts, especially for large-scale flexible devices.107 The sol–gel method, also known as soft chemistry, consists of using an organic or inorganic metal compound as precursor, promoting the hydrolysis and polycondensation of the precursor in solution to convert the sol into gel, and then forming an oxide solid by heating the gel.108 Compared with other techniques, the sol–gel method shows the distinct advantages of low cost, simplicity, lower crystallization temperatures and size tunability from sol–gel chemistry.107,109–114 The electronic and optical properties of the sol–gel-derived metal oxides are highly dependent on the precursor, the concentration of the sol–gel solution, and the treating temperature.109
The judicious choice of an appropriate precursor is crucial to obtain a metal oxide film with good quality under mild conditions. The choice of precursor relies on the properties of the solvent and the desired processing conditions. In the solution preparation of metal oxides for application as buffer layers in PSCs, a variety of precursors, such as metal–nitrates, chlorides, acetylacetonates, alkoxides and carboxylates, have been used to produce metal oxide films. Among these precursors, the inorganic salts, such as chlorides and nitrates can be used as precursors for the preparation of metal oxides by the sol–gel process. However, their residual anionic species are difficult to remove,88 which is detrimental to the performance of the PSCs. The organic salt precursors (such as acetylacetonates, alkoxides and carboxylates) possess the advantage that the organic groups can decompose into removable, volatile byproducts during the annealing process. Thermal decomposition of these organic salt precursors has become a fascinating method to prepare metal oxides, due to the low cost and commercial availability of the precursors. Among a variety of carboxylates, the formate ion (HCOO−) and acetate ion (CH3COO−) are the most commonly used carboxylates. Acetates are excellent precursors for the production of metal oxides due to their solution processability with protonic solvents such as aqueous or alcohol solutions. Acetylacetonates are a class of β-diketonate, which can be formed from almost any metal, such as zinc, molybdenum and vanadium. In metal alkoxides, a metal is bonded with one or more alkyl groups through an intermediate oxygen atom. Many metal alkoxides exhibit excellent solubility in their corresponding alcohols, and the metal alkoxides can be used as precursors for the preparation of metal oxide buffer layers in PSCs. Another class of low temperature precursors for producing metal oxides is based on amine and hydroxy nitrate compounds, especially for preparing zinc oxide.115
The selection of solvent must also meet several requirements: first, the precursor should have good solubility in the solvent at moderate temperatures, while the solvent cannot dissolve the previously coated layer underneath; second, the solvent should have appropriate viscosity, volatility and surface tension, so that the ink can spread out on the substrate to form a continuous and pinhole-free film with the desired thickness; third, a sufficiently low boiling point is needed for easy removal of residual solvent during post treatment. In some cases, additives are added to tune the viscosity, wettability and stability of the ink before it is deposited onto the substrate.
Several film formation techniques are illustrated in Fig. 11. The film deposition process is generally carried out at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. Vacuum-free techniques are beneficial for reducing the fabrication cost. Spin-coating is the most commonly used procedure in the fabrication of metal oxide layers by the sol–gel method for smaller, laboratory-scale devices. Cost-effectiveness, low maintenance, ease of operation, high reproducibility and adaptability are the major advantages of this technique. During the process, an excess amount of solution is dispersed onto the substrate, which is held on the spinning head by a vacuum pump. The substrate is then rotated at high speeds in order to spread the fluid uniformly by centrifugal force, until the desired thickness of the film is achieved. The thickness of the film depends on the angular spinning speed, as well as the viscosity and concentration of the precursor solution.
Once the spin-coating is complete, the as-deposited gel film is in a wet and amorphous state. Thermal annealing treatment is often carried out in order to remove residual solvent and solidify the coating. The annealing temperature must be high enough to remove the remaining solvent. By controlling the composition of the sol solution, film deposition and sintering conditions, a thin film with the desired thickness and morphology can be achieved. After annealing, additional surface treatment methods, such as oxygen plasma or UV-ozone (UVO) treatment, are also adopted to modulate the energy levels of the metal oxides by changing the chemical composition of the surface.
1.5 Characterization techniques of the buffer layers
Understanding how buffer layers affect the interface properties, such as the interface dipole, injection barrier, interface diffusion, surface morphology, and optical interference, is critical for further improvement in the performance of PSCs. Therefore, the experimental techniques used to study the mechanisms of these effects are definitely important. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) are the most frequently used techniques to study the interface properties, and we will briefly discuss these techniques in this section.
Photoemission spectroscopy (PES) refers to the binding energy measurement of photoelectrons emitted from a sample via the interaction between the irradiating photons and the sample. Fig. 12a shows a schematic representation of PES. Photoemission spectroscopy techniques are classified based on the photon source that provides the ionization energy, such as X-ray or ultraviolet photons.

For the metal oxide films derived through sol–gel methods, the surface chemical reactions are especially complex, which leads to a diversity of surface components. To obtain a complete description of the surface, determination of the elemental or molecular composition is needed, and this is essential to understanding the relationship between the function and the composition of the interfacial layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a non-destructive and semi-quantitative technique for analyzing the surface chemical state information based on the photoelectric effect. XPS spectra are obtained by irradiating a material with an X-ray beam (with a photon energy of 200–2000 eV) while simultaneously measuring the kinetic energy and number of electrons that escape from the top 0–10 nm of the material being analyzed. Each element will give rise to a characteristic set of XPS peaks at kinetic energies determined by the photon energy and the respective binding energies, by which the researchers can directly identify the presence of a specific element in the sample. Furthermore, the intensity of the characteristic peak is directly related to the percentage of the element concentrations within the sampled region. Therefore, quantitative analysis of the surface composition can be realized using XPS. In general, XPS detectors require ultra-high vacuum conditions to obtain a spectrum with minimal error.
UPS and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES) are the most powerful and direct technologies to study the structure of the occupied and unoccupied energy bands below and above the Fermi level in the solid state material, which correspond to the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB), respectively. For UPS, a helium discharge lamp, which generates photons with an energy value of 21.2 eV (He I) or 40.8 eV (He II) in the vacuum ultraviolet region, is used as a photon source. Compared to XPS, UPS is limited to studying the energy levels of valence electrons, but allows higher resolution and faster measurements. IPES is time-reversed PES. The schematics of IPES are shown in Fig. 12b. A well-collimated electron beam with an energy value of 0–20 eV is directed at the sample. These incident electrons couple with high-lying unoccupied electronic states and decay into low-lying unoccupied states, and some of the transitions are radiative. The photons ejected in the decay process are recorded and an energy spectrum is obtained, which allows detailed measurements of the unoccupied state density. Compared with X-rays, the energies of the incident electrons used in UPS and IPES are relatively low; therefore, the penetration depth is only a few atomic layers, which means UPS and IPES are particularly surface sensitive techniques. IPES is a complementary technique to PES. By a combination of UPS and IPES, the WF, CB and VB of the sample can be determined, and the energy levels at the interface can also be analyzed.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a very high-resolution type of scanning probe microscopy with a demonstrated resolution of nearly one nanometer, which can be used to provide three-dimensional topographic information about a sample by probing its surface structure with a very sharp tip. The tip is scanned laterally across the surface, and the vertical movements of the tip are recorded and used to construct a quantitative three dimensional topographic map. The lateral resolution of the image can be as small as the tip radius (typically 5–15 nm), and the vertical resolution can be of the order of angstroms. The most dominant force contributing to the deflection of the AFM cantilever is interatomic van der Waals forces. AFM imaging modes are divided into contact, non-contact and tapping modes. The tapping mode is the most commonly used method for imaging functionalized surfaces in PSCs, because of its minimal damage to the surface and the tip.
Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is an optical technique for investigating the thickness and optical constants (complex refractive index and extinction coefficient) of thin films. It is a non-destructive and non-contact technique, and is very sensitive to changes in the optical response of the incident radiation that interacts with the sample. Ellipsometric theory is based on the Fresnel's reflection or transmission equations for polarized light encountering boundaries in planar multi-layered materials. Typically, the measured signal is the change in the polarization state of the light as the incident light interacts with the reflection from the sample. The change in polarization is quantified by the amplitude ratio and the phase difference. Generally, the optical constants of the sample cannot be directly obtained from the above experimental data. Therefore, a multi-layer model, which considers the optical constants and the thickness of each layer, needs to be established. Most models assume that the sample consists of several well-defined, optically homogeneous and isotropic layers. By analyzing the experimental data using the optical model, spatially resolved film thickness and complex refractive index values can be achieved.
2. Materials for the anode buffer layer
The main role of the anode buffer layer is to improve the collection and extraction efficiency of holes. ITO is the most commonly used transparent electrode for PSCs. However, ITO (WF = 4.7 eV) cannot form an ohmic contact with the donor or acceptor materials in the active layer of PSCs. Fortunately, the WF of ITO can be modulated by surface modification. Depending on the nature of the modification material, ITO can be used as the anode or cathode when modified with high or low WF buffer layers, respectively.
As mentioned in the Introduction, PEDOT:PSS is the most commonly used anode buffer layer on ITO in PSCs,31,32 but the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS could result in degradation of the performance of the PSC.36–38 To solve this problem, there is great interest in developing new anode buffer layers to replace PEDOT:PSS. Anode buffer layer materials should possess the following electronic characteristics: (1) an appropriate energy level to match the HOMO of the donor material in the active layer for ohmic contact at the active layer/anode interface, and (2) a large band gap (Egap > 3 eV) with a conduction band (CB) higher than the LUMO level of both the donor and acceptor materials, for effectively blocking electron leakage to the anode.21,43,116 Numerous metal oxides, such as NiO, MoO3, V2O5, WO3, RuO2, CuOx, CrOx and ReOx, meet these requirements and have been successfully used as anode buffer layers in high performance PSCs. However, in earlier studies, most of these materials were prepared by vacuum deposition, which is incompatible with the solution processing technique. In this and the following section, we will discuss the details of the preparation of these metal oxides, including starting materials, processing methods and post-treatment. For a clear comparison of the effect of buffer layers on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, Tables 1–4 summarizes the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with solution-processed metal oxides/chelates as anode or cathode buffer layers.

2.1 Nickel oxide
For metal oxides used as anode buffer materials, NiOx is the only p-type material, while the other metal oxides, such as MoO3, V2O5 and WO3, are n-type materials. NiOx possesses a wide band gap and high IP, which ensures that NiOx has excellent electron blocking ability. In contrast, the energy levels of the n-type anode buffer materials indicate that they do not possess electron-blocking properties. Therefore, NiOx is an ideal material for anode modification, considering its electron-blocking ability and favorable energy level alignment with the donor materials in PSCs.117
The hole selectivity and electronic properties of NiOx films are dependent on their surface components, energy level alignments, and gap state concentrations, as shown in Fig. 13a. For stoichiometric NiO, the ground state is predominantly determined by the Ni 3d orbitals (Ni 3d8 O 2p5), and the lowest CB is also determined by the Ni 3d orbitals. Several methods have been used to prepare NiOx film, such as oxygen plasma treatment of nickel metal,118 pulsed laser deposition,119 sputtering120 and solution deposition from a precursor.43,119,121 However, it is difficult to obtain stoichiometric NiO in an ambient environment due to the complexity of the surface chemical reactions and the similar thermodynamic driving force for producing NiO and Ni(OH)2.

For the solution-processed NiOx anode buffer layer obtained by the sol–gel process, the surface chemical reactions are especially complex and directly dependent on the post-deposition treatment conditions.43 The XPS results confirm that a variety of compositions, such as NiO, Ni(OH)2, NiOOH, Ni2O3, residual undecomposed precursor and water species, may exist on the surface under various processing conditions. In addition, the concentration of the various compositions changes with annealing temperature and gas environment.43,86 UPS and IPES measurements show that the IP, EA and WF of NiOx film are related to the surface composition. Plasma treatment and UVO treatment are effective ways to tailor the surface composition and WF of the NiOx buffer layer.43,86,87,106 O2-plasma treatment or UVO treatment on the NiOx surface can increase the surface NiOOH concentration, which results in the formation of a large surface dipole. The resultant dipolar NiOOH shows effects of reducing the Ni 3d states of the valence band, but has little effect on the CB, leading to an increase of the near-surface region band gap from 3.1 eV to 3.6 eV (see Fig. 13b(iii)). At the same time, the WF of the NiOx can be increased to ∼5.3 eV. The combination of the high WF and large band gap is conducive to both the hole collecting and electron blocking abilities of the NiOx anode buffer layer, which helps to improve the Voc and thus the efficiency of the PSCs.
Ratcliff et al. investigated the interfacial electronic structures at the NiOx/active layer interface, and the role NiOx plays in the process of hole selection in PSCs with PCDTBT and PC70BM as donor and acceptor materials, respectively.121 The energy level alignments at the NiOx/active layer interface are shown in Fig. 14. A large dipole shift of 0.6 eV is observed at the NiOx/PC70BM interface (Fig. 14a), which is attributed to the existence of dipolar NiOOH at the NiOx surface, because the charge transfer between NiOx and PC70BM can be excluded, considering the energy level alignments of the two species. The alignment of the NiOx VB top and the HOMO of the donor polymer PCDTBT in the active layer ensure the effective extraction of photo-generated holes from the photoactive layer. The band gap of O2 plasma-treated NiOx reaches up to ∼3.7 eV, with an EA of 2.1 eV, which is 2.2 eV higher than the LUMO of the acceptor PC70BM in the active layer (Fig. 14c). Therefore, the NiOx anode buffer layer is also endowed with excellent electron-blocking properties, which is the key factor in decreasing the leakage current and improving the Voc of PSCs.

Nickel acetate (NiAc) tetrahydrate is a precursor to produce NiOx by decomposition under high temperature annealing,122,123 and the value of x is determined by the preparation conditions. In fact, NiAc can be directly used as an anode buffer layer for PSCs.3,124 The NiAc layer was prepared by spin-coating its aqueous solution and then thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min to remove the water of hydration in air. The annealing temperature is much lower than the temperature (300 °C) required for transforming NiAc into NiOx. The resultant NiAc layer is highly transparent in the visible range. Confirmed by FTIR spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra, the NiAc lost only its lattice water and did not decompose into NiO or any other species during the treatment.3 The low temperature (150 °C) annealed NiAc had an amorphous structure and showed a hole mobility of ∼1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. PSCs with a NiAc anode buffer layer show dramatic enhancement in the Jsc while keeping the FF at a relatively high level. However, due to the relatively low WF of NiAc (4.24 eV),87 ohmic contact cannot be formed at the anode side, leading to a decreased Voc in comparison with PEDOT:PSS-modified devices.
Wong et al. and Garcia et al. prepared NiOx by annealing nickel formate precursor at temperatures higher than 300 °C in air.123,125 This high temperature is not suitable for the fabrication of flexible PSCs with a polymer substrate. Ma et al. developed a new simple method to prepare a NiOx anode buffer layer from NiAc precursor at much lower temperatures.86 The solution processed NiAc precursor can be converted into nickel oxide (Ni2O3 and NiO) and NiOOH by simultaneous application of annealing at a temperature lower than 150 °C and UV ozone treatment. As confirmed by the XPS measurements (Fig. 15), the composition of the resultant film surface varied with the annealing temperature, thus leading to different WFs. This method can result in NiOx with the desired WF at a lower temperature, which is more compatible with flexible substrates.
 Fig. 15  (a) Ni 2p3/2 and (b) O 1s core level peaks of NiOx thin films prepared under different processing conditions.86 
In our recent study, we processed the as-prepared NiAc film solely by UVO treatment.87 The XPS results confirm that only a small portion of the NiAc molecules decomposed into NiOOH under UVO treatment, while most of the NiAc precursor remained unchanged. Experimental results showed that the small amount of NiOOH on the surface can regulate the energy level alignment at the interface, leading to ohmic contact at the anode interface. At the same time, the UVO treatment further improved the wettability between the substrate and the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solvent, which facilitates the formation of an upper photoactive layer with improved morphology, thus suppressing the leakage current. All of these effects resulted in an enhanced Voc in comparison with as-prepared NiAc-buffered control devices.86
In addition to the NiAc precursors mentioned above, other precursors or metal oxide powders can also be utilized to prepare metal oxide films. Another Ni complex, [Ni(en)2](HCO2)2 (en = H2N(CH2)2NH2), was also used as a precursor to prepare NiOx.43,106,117,121 However, decomposition of this NiOx precursor also required thermal annealing at high temperatures of above 250 °C. Upon applying O2-plasma treatment to the sol–gel derived NiOx, a high WF can be realized. A PCE of 6.7% can be achieved in PCDTBT:PC70BM solar cells when using NiOx as the anode buffer layer.
A combustion method was also utilized to prepare NiOx, where nickel nitrate and glycine were used as the oxidizer (O) and fuel (F), respectively.126 A relatively low processing temperature of 175 °C was sufficient to initiate the combustion reaction. It was found that the choice of the fuel and the molar ratio of F/O were critical to obtain high-quality NiOx layers.
2.2 Molybdenum trioxide
MoO3, once considered to be a p-type metal oxide, is an n-type doped metal oxide that has been extensively investigated as the anode buffer layer in PSCs.127–129 UPS and IPES measurements were performed to investigate the underlying physical mechanisms pertaining to the electronic structure of MoO3. For molybdenum oxide, the CB and VB are mainly determined by the molybdenum 4d orbital and oxygen 2p orbital, respectively. The electronic band structure of MoO3 depends on the molybdenum cation oxidation state.80
The XPS results of the vacuum-deposited MoO3 thin film reveal that molybdenum is partially reduced from Mo6+ to Mo5+ during the evaporation process, leading to oxygen vacancies in the evaporated MoO3 film, which corresponds to the decrease in the average oxidation state of the molybdenum cations.130 Upon partial filling of the unoccupied 4d band of the molybdenum atoms which are adjacent to oxygen vacancies, the gap states are formed within the energy gap of the MoO3 layer. The gap states emerge at binding energies of 0.4–0.5 eV below the Fermi level.130,131 However, because of the low concentration of oxygen vacancies, the gap states induced by oxygen-deficient MoO3 cannot be detected by UPS measurement. The EA and IP of MoO3 films deposited under ultrahigh vacuum were determined to be 6.7 and 9.7 eV, respectively, and the Fermi level is located slightly below the CB, giving a WF of 6.9 eV.101,103,104,107 The oxidation state of molybdenum cations is highly sensitive to oxygen, moisture and organic contamination. Upon air exposure, the concentration of the reduced Mo5+ species increases and the gap state peak becomes clearly visible in the UPS spectra. The energy levels shift towards the vacuum level concurrently,129,131,132 leading to a decrease in EA, IP and WF (Fig. 6). Irfan et al. systematically studied the energy level evolution of MoO3 upon oxygen and air exposure, as shown in Fig. 16, where 1 Langmuir exposure is equal to 10−6 torr sec exposure.132 The WF continuously decreased and saturated at 5.3 eV and 5.7 eV for air and oxygen exposed MoO3 films, respectively. As for the solution-processed MoO3 films acquired by using sol–gel method111 or nanoparticle solutions,129 the MoO3 surface was found to be contaminated in a similar way. Therefore, the solution-processed MoO3 exhibited energy levels comparable to those of the vacuum-evaporated MoO3 with air exposure.131 The WF of the solution-processed MoO3 further decreased to 4.9–5.1 eV (Fig. 6).133 This value is still higher than the HOMO level of most donor materials commonly used in PSCs, which guarantees efficient hole extraction at the anode interface. However, for polymer donor materials with HOMO levels higher than the WF of MoO3, Fermi level pinning of the MoO3 to the HOMO of the donor could not occur,134 leading to non-ohmic contact at the anode interface. O2-plasma treatment of the solution-processed or contaminated MoOx can result in the oxidization of Mo5+ to Mo6+ and can reduce the number of gap states.133 Post-exposure annealing in vacuum can partially remove the surface contaminant and lead to an upward shift of the vacuum level.133 With the dual treatments of O2-plasma treatment and vacuum annealing, the WF of the solution-processed MoO3 can be restored to ∼6.1 eV (Fig. 17). This high WF is beneficial for hole extraction from donor materials with high HOMO levels.

In addition to the introduction of oxygen vacancies in the MoOx lattice, hydrogen reduction (incorporation of hydrogen within the oxide lattice) is another effective way to decrease the average oxidation state of molybdenum cations.80 Vasilopoulou et al. examined the advantage of hydrogenation over the introduction of oxygen vacancies in tailoring the electronic structure of molybdenum oxides.84 Hydrogenation leads to the formation of a high density of occupied gap states near the Fermi level, while maintaining high WF upon high degrees of reduction.84,135Fig. 18 illustrates the evolution of gap state occupation and Fermi level movement. As shown in Fig. 18a, the CB is empty in stoichiometric MoO3. An increase in the number of oxygen vacancies results in electron occupation of the d–d band and a shift in the Fermi level within the CB, corresponding to a decreased WF. On the other hand, hydrogenation leads to the formation of covalent bonds between hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms, which results in intervalence electron transfer in the previously empty π* band. The WF of the highly hydrogenated MoO3 can reach as high as 5.9 eV, which is much higher than that of the oxygen deficient MoO3. Significant enhancement in the performance of PSCs is achieved by using hydrogenated Mo oxides as anode buffer layers, which is attributed to the favorable energy level alignment at the metal oxide/active–layer interface and the enhanced charge transport through the formation of a large density of gap states near the Fermi level.
 Fig. 18  (a) Band structure of MoO3, where occupied orbitals with dominant O 2p character comprise the VB, while empty orbitals with mainly Mo 4d character comprise the CB. The d–d bands attributed to Mo–Mo bonds formed in the distorted lattice of the oxygen-deficient Mo oxides are also shown. (b) Schematic illustration of the evolution of gap state occupation and Fermi level movement toward a higher binding energy in Mo oxide (I) with the progress of oxygen vacancy formation in hydrogen-poor reducing environments and (II) with the evolution of hydrogenation.82 
In order to understand the role that MoO3 anode buffer layers play in the charge transfer at the interface, the energy level evolution of different organic materials on the MoO3 surface was studied.127,128,130 Kröger et al. proposed that charge transport at the MoO3/organic-semiconductor is realized via the deep lying CB of MoO3.128 The UPS spectra and schematic energy level alignment of α-NPD on ITO/MoO3 substrates are shown in Fig. 19. Upon deposition of α-NPD, the photoemission onset shifts towards a lower binding energy. With a α-NPD thickness of 16 Å, the downward shift of the onset saturates as the Fermi level is pinned at ∼0.6 eV above the HOMO level of α-NPD. Because of the high WF of MoO3, the deposition of α-NPD (HOMO ∼5.4 eV) results in electron transfer from the α-NPD HOMO to the low-lying unoccupied states of MoO3 to establish thermodynamic equilibrium, thus yielding a dipole at the MoO3/α-NPD interface and a total vacuum level shift of 2.1 eV. Therefore, the mechanisms of MoO3-induced enhancement of hole injection can be interpreted as follows: when a positive bias is applied to ITO, the injection of holes into the organic layer is realized by extracting electrons from the HOMO of α-NPD into the CB of MoO3. In this process, the energy barrier is the electron injection barrier, which is determined by the energy difference between the HOMO of α-NPD and the CB of MoO3. The hole extraction process occurring in PSCs is exactly opposite to the process of hole injection described above. When incident light passes through the device, the photogenerated excitons diffuse towards and dissociate at the donor/acceptor interface into electrons in the LUMO of the acceptor and holes in the HOMO of the donor. The MoO3/organic-semiconductor interface acts as an electron limiting barrier, pushing electrons away from the anode, while pulling holes toward the anode.136 The holes are not transported to the anode through the VB of MoO3, due to its significantly deeper VB edge. Instead, electrons are transported from ITO to the MoO3/organic-semiconductor interface through the CB of MoO3, and subsequently recombine with holes in the HOMO of the donor. Another proposal is that the electrons from the ITO are transported via the gap states that emerge in MoO3, and finally recombine with the holes in the HOMO level of the donor material in the PSC.84,130,135–139

(b) Schematic energy level alignment of the ITO/MoO3/α-NPD junction (energy values are rounded to one significant digit).128 
The properties of the MoO3/metals interface, and how it affects the oxide properties, such as WF and band electronic structure, have also been studied.140 At the metal oxide/metal interface, the chemical and electronic interactions between the two materials will influence their properties more than several nanometers away from the interface. Because the metal oxide layer used for electrode modification in PSCs is usually only a few nanometers thick, the energy level alignment at the metal oxide/organic-semiconductor interface may be affected by the nearby electrode interface. Previous studies have proven that the energy-level alignment at the metal oxide/organic-semiconductor interface can change with the thickness of the metal oxide. Greiner et al. used photoemission measurements to investigate the interfaces between MoO3 and a series of metals (Au, Ni, Mo, V and Cu). It was found that Mo6+ cations near the interface were reduced to lower oxidation species when MoO3 was deposited on any of these metal surfaces, as shown in Fig. 20. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain this phenomenon: (1) charge transfer from the metal Fermi level to the oxide CB, and (2) reduction of MoO3 driven by oxidation of the metal substrate. The reduction of Mo6+ cations changes the VB electronic structure and the WF of MoO3 near the interface, which causes MoO3 to become semimetallic near the interface. However, different metals lead to different degrees of Mo6+ reduction at the interface due to their different reactivities, as shown in Fig. 21. Mo6+ cations from MoO3 are reduced to Mo5+ and Mo4+ at the highly reactive interfaces, while Mo cations are only slightly reduced at less-reactive interfaces. These results indicate that for more reactive interfaces, a thicker oxide buffer layer is required to reach a high WF for favorable energy level alignment (only in the case of high WF hole-extraction buffer layers). However, an overly thick metal oxide layer leads to an increase in the series resistance of the device, which is unfavorable for photocurrent enhancement. Therefore, this finding will supply a guide for the proper design of electrode structure and suitable oxide buffer thickness for the optimal balance of WF and conductivity.81,140

Bis(2,4-pentanedionato)molybdenum(VI) dioxide (MoO2(acac)2) is a promising and commercially available precursor for the development of oxomolybdate precursor solutions; it reacts with water in hydrated methanol solutions under mild conditions to form dinuclear oxo-molybdate species with the formula Mo2O5(OH)2(H2O)4. These species will lead to the formation of [Mo6O19]2− clusters in the limiting case of complete condensation and deprotonation, and finally achieve controlled molybdenum oxide thin films.141 However, excess water existing in the metal oxide layer is detrimental to the long term stability of the devices. Given the above considerations, Jasieniak et al.131 investigated two different methods to prepare MoOx films from MoO2(acac)2 precursor: an anhydrous route and an ambient synthetic route. For the anhydrous route, the MoO2(acac)2 precursor was heated in anhydrous methanol under a nitrogen atmosphere. For the ambient synthetic method, the solutions were prepared in reagent grade methanol in air. Both the solutions were aged for a minimum of 2 days prior to use. The resultant MoOx films had an amorphous smooth surface. The anhydrous method can minimize excessive hydrolysis from atmospheric moisture. FTIR and XPS analysis confirmed that significant acetylacetonate ligand remained in the film prepared by the anhydrous method at temperatures below 200 °C. However, the amount of organic residues was much lower in the film obtained by the ambient route. Although the surface compositions of the MoOx film synthesized via the two different routes showed significant differences, the devices showed similar performances at all comparative annealing temperatures. Zilberberg et al. prepared a solution using the same precursor and isopropanol as solvent.111 The solution was maintained in ambient air for 1 h for hydrolysis. Upon annealing in a N2 atmosphere for 20 min at 150 °C, MoOx layers with a high WF of 5.3 eV were obtained. The performance of the device with the solution-processed MoOx anode buffer layer was comparable to that of the reference devices with thermally evaporated MoO3 buffer layers.111 In addition, compared with the PEDOT:PSS modified devices, PSCs with the solution processed MoOx layer exhibited greater long term stability. We modified the synthesis procedure with the same precursor by simply spin-coating MoO2(acac)2 isopropanol solution on the substrate and then baking in air at 150 °C for 10 min.93 The results from the FTIR and XPS investigation confirmed the decomposition of MoO2(acac)2 into MoO3 after thermal annealing. The obtained MoOx layer exhibited high hole mobility and high light transmittance. The long term stability of nonencapsulated PSCs with MoOx and PEDOT:PSS interfacial layers was investigated by testing the degradation of characteristic parameters with time in a nitrogen filled glove-box. After 35 days, the efficiency of PEDOT:PSS modified PSCs stored in N2 dropped to ∼88% of the initial value. In contrast, the solution-processed MoOx modified PSCs showed much greater stability, and retained 94% of their initial efficiency after 35 days in N2.93
(NH4)6Mo7O24 and Mo(CO)3(EtCN)3 are also used as precursors for the preparation of MoO3 films. Liu et al. first introduced a solution-processed MoO3 anode buffer layer via spin-coating an aqueous ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24) solution, then annealing at 160 °C for 10 min in nitrogen.142 Using solution-processed MoO3, PSCs with an ITO/MoO3/P3HT:PC60BM/Al structure showed a PCE of 3.14%, which was comparable to a device with a thermally evaporated MoO3 anode buffer layer, and higher than a device with a PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer. The MoOx modified device exhibited a staggering 20-fold stability improvement in its performance half-life compared with PEDOT:PSS modified devices.143 Murase et al. modified the synthesis procedure with the same precursor and obtained a continuous MoO3 thin film with a low annealing temperature.144 Combustion processing was employed by Yao et al. to fabricate MoO3 film from the same precursor.145 When acetylacetone was used as a “fuel” and HNO3 as an “oxidizer” to ignite the combustion reaction, α-phase MoO3 was achieved at 250 °C. Adding a small amount of PEDOT:PSS to the combustion system lowered the transformation temperature of the precursor, and resulted in the formation of a more homogeneous and continuous film.145 Hammond et al. used commercially available Mo(CO)3(EtCN)3 as a precursor for fabricating continuous MoOx thin films for application as anode buffer layers in PSCs.133 Continuous MoOx thin films were obtained by spin-coating acetonitrile solutions in N2 atmosphere and then annealing at 120 °C in air, followed by O2 plasma treatment. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the complete decomposition of Mo(CO)3(EtCN)3 by annealing at 115 °C in air. Incorporation of MoOx film into a device with the structure of ITO/MoOx/P3HT:PC60BM/Ca/Al afforded a PCE that was comparable to devices with a PEDOT:PSS buffer layer. Yang et al. and Girotto et al. used another precursor, MoO2(OH)(OOH), prepared from MoO3 powder and H2O2, to obtain a uniform sol–gel-derived MoOx film.146,147 The precursor solution was cast onto ITO and subsequently treated at 250 °C for 30 min, and the major component of the film was MoO3. A PSC with the structure of ITO/MoO3/PBDT-DTNT:PC70BM/Al showed a PCE of 5.86%, which is comparable with that (5.89%) of the device with a PEDOT:PSS buffer layer.146
2.3 Vanadium oxide
V2O5 was also once considered to be a p-type semiconductor. However, in recent works the electronic structure and charge injection properties of vacuum-grown V2O5 layers were studied via UPS, XPS and IPES,107 and it was confirmed that V2O5 is actually an n-type semiconductor. Similar to MoO3, fresh V2O5 deposited under ultra-high vacuum (e-V2O5) exhibits remarkably deep lying electronic states (Fig. 22). The EA, IP and WF of the fresh e-V2O5 film are confirmed to be 6.7 eV, 9.5 eV and 7.0 eV, respectively.107,148 From the XPS spectra, only the V5+ oxidation state is identified for the fresh e-V2O5 film. Similar surface compositions and oxidation states of the vanadium atoms were identified by XPS for sol–gel-derived (solution-processed) V2O5 (s-V2O5) and air contaminated e-V2O5 (c-V2O5). From the emergence of the V4+ peak, it can be inferred that the adsorbates can partially reduce the V5+ in the V2O5 surface to V4+. It was revealed by UPS spectra that the V4+ surface state results in the formation of gap states in s-V2O5 and c-V2O5 films, which show nearly identical energy level alignments, with lowered vacuum levels and widened band gaps in comparison with e-V2O5.107 The WF value of both s-V2O5 and c-V2O5 dropped to ∼5.3 eV. The hole extraction at the V2O5/organic-semiconductor interface proceeds in a similar way as that at the MoO3/organic-semiconductor interface.
 Fig. 22  Energy diagrams resulting from the UPS and IPES studies for V2O5 evaporated under ultra-high vacuum (e-V2O5), e-V2O5 contaminated with adsorbates (c-V2O5) (10 min air exposure), and solution processed V2O5 (s-V2O5).107 
Vanadium-oxitriisopropoxide was used as the precursor to prepare VOx film via sol–gel method. A V2O5 layer with high WF can be achieved through the hydrolysis of vanadium(V) oxitriisopropoxide at room temperature without any post-annealing or plasma treatment.107,113,114 In general, the vanadium(V) oxitriisopropoxide film was prepared by spin-coating its isopropyl alcohol solution. Subsequently, the film was stored in ambient air for 1–4 h for hydrolysis at room temperature. This hydrolysis process can be shortened by heating the sample at a suitable temperature.112 An extremely smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) of 0.4 nm was obtained. The results of UPS and IPES measurements showed that the electronic structure of the solution processed V2O5 layers was similar to that of thermally evaporated V2O5 layers with ambient air exposure, and a high WF of 5.6 eV was obtained.107 The resultant VOx showed excellent characteristics as an anode buffer layer in both conventional114,149 and inverted107,112,113 PSCs.
Vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) can also be used as a precursor to produce a VOx anode buffer layer for PSCs.150 The VOx buffer layer was prepared by spin-coating a VO(acac)2 isopropyl alcohol solution (1.5 mg mL−1) on the ITO electrode, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. FTIR and XPS measurements were performed to investigate the surface composition of the resultant VOx buffer layer. The XPS spectrum confirmed the existence of V4+ and V5+ oxidation states in the surface. Combined with the O 1s spectra, it can be inferred that only some of the precursors at the surface are decomposed into V2O5, and the other molecules remain unchanged. The VOx film is amorphous and highly transparent in the visible range, and shows a high hole mobility of 6.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The VOx buffer layer can also greatly decrease the series resistance and increase the parallel resistance of the whole device, which contributes to an improved fill factor. The PCE of the PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA with the VOx anode buffer layer reached 6.35%.
2.4 Tungsten oxide
WO3 is another n-type metal oxide with high WF, which can promote good ohmic contacts with many polymer donor materials used in PSCs. The optical band gap of WO3 is around 3.2–3.4 eV, and is found to decrease by 0.5 eV upon annealing in air. Similar to MoO3 and V2O5, WO3 also exhibits very deep lying electronic states, with a VB edge around 3 eV below the Fermi level and a CB edge very close to the Fermi level.151 The EA, IP and WF of freshly evaporated WO3 film are confirmed to be 6.5 eV, 9.8 eV and 6.7 eV, respectively. The WF is also sensitive to oxygen deficiency and oxygen exposure; it can decrease to 4.7 eV upon oxygen exposure. It has been reported that in WO3, similar to MoO3, a certain degree of oxygen deficiency leads to the occupation of a large density of states lying just below the CB edge in the previously forbidden gap, corresponding to a decrease in the WF.85,135 The gap states existing in oxygen deficient WO2.5 can act as a reservoir of donor electrons for enhanced injection and transport to the LUMO of the polymer, thus making WO2.5 an effective cathode interfacial layer for organic light emitting diodes.135 On the other hand, hydrogen reduction, inducing under-stoichiometric tungsten oxide, leads to an occupation of gap states near the Fermi level, while maintaining a high WF similar to that of stoichiometric WO3. This high WF is beneficial to the formation of a large interfacial dipole at the anode interface, which favors charge extraction from the organic layer in PSCs.85
Tungsten alkoxides, such as tungsten ethoxide (W(OC2H5)5 and W(OC2H5)6) and tungsten(VI) isopropoxide, can be used as precursors to prepare WO3 anode buffer layers. We prepared a WO3 anode buffer layer from tungsten(VI) isopropoxide by spin-coating its isopropanol solution, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min in air.152 This treatment results in complete decomposition of the precursor into WO3. The resulting WO3 layer showed a high hole mobility of 9.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The WO3 modified PSCs showed enhanced performance in comparison with PEDOT:PSS-modified devices. Choi et al. used W(OC2H5)6 solution as a precursor to prepare WO3 film.153 The resultant WO3 layer induces nearly ohmic contact to P3HT for hole extraction, according to UPS measurement. The stability of PSCs using WO3 as anode buffer layers is significantly enhanced, due to the air- and photo-stability of the WO3 layer itself. Chen et al. used W(OC2H5)5 and W(OC2H5)6 to produce WO3 films for inverted PSCs; the performance of the devices is shown in Fig. 23.154 A novel polymer, PBDTT-TT-TEG, with a backbone identical to the donor polymer PBDTTT-C-T and ter(ethylene glycol)-substituted side chains, was introduced to the PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM blend layer. The PBDTT-TT-TEG molecules tended to self-organize at the surface of the blend layer due to the reduced surface energy caused by the TEG side chains, which can improve the adhesion between the active layer and the W(OC2H5)5 or W(OC2H5)6 precursor and is beneficial for energy alignment. Combined with a bilayer ZnO/PFN-CbpSO cathode buffer layer, the efficiency of the PSC reached as high as 8.49%.

2.5 Rhenium oxide
In comparison with the metal oxides mentioned above, ReO3 is a unique metal oxide with a high work function (≈6.0 eV) and low vacuum-evaporation temperature (≈340 °C).155 It has proven to be an effective anode buffer layer in PSCs156,157 and an effective hole transport dopant in organic solar cells158 and in light-emitting diodes.159 A solution-processed ReOx anode buffer layer can be prepared from methyltrioxorhenium(VII) (CH3ReO3, MTO) isopropanol solution.105 The solution was spin coated on the ITO substrate, and then stored in ambient air for 25 min for polymerization. Subsequently, the film was baked at 110 °C to remove the unpolymerized precursor MTO. Finally, UVO treatment was applied to the film to decompose the poly-MTO into ReOx. The ReOx film can improve the hole collection efficiency and enhance the light distribution within the bulk heterojunction layer. By using a ReOx anode buffer layer instead of PEDOT:PSS, additional absorption in the range of 400–550 nm can be achieved for PSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM, as shown in Fig. 24. The PCE of the PSCs was enhanced to 8.30%.105

2.6 Other metal oxides
A CuOx anode buffer layer can also be prepared by spin-coating a 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of copper acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2) on an ITO substrate, followed by thermal annealing at 80 °C to decompose Cu(acac)2 into CuOx.160 The high WF of the CuOx anode buffer layer enables the formation of an ohmic contact at the anode and is beneficial to hole extraction, which enhances efficiency of the PSCs by decreasing the charge recombination rate in the device.
A simple but effective route has also been reported in our group for the solution preparation of a CrOx anode buffer layer for PSCs.161 Chromium acetylacetonate (Cr(acac)3) was used as the precursor; it can be decomposed into CrOx by thermal annealing at 60 °C, followed by UVO treatment. The XPS spectra confirmed that most of the precursor had decomposed into Cr2O3 after the treatment. Considering that the UVO treatment was performed in air, the existence of dipolar Cr(OH)3 species in the CrOx buffer layer can be attributed to the hydration of the oxide. The dipolar species results in an increased WF, which leads to the formation of ohmic contact at the anode side and improves the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with solution-processed CrOx as the anode buffer layer.
Ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3) was used as a precursor in our group to prepare RuO2 through UVO treatment without thermal annealing.162 Upon UVO treatment for 10 min, most Ru(acac)3 molecules will decompose, and the main component of the resultant film is RuO2. The resultant RuO2 film shows high light transmittance. Great enhancement in the Jsc of PSCs was realized using a RuO2 anode buffer layer.162
3. Materials for the cathode buffer layer
In order to effectively collect electrons at the cathode and increase the open-circuit voltage, the contact barrier between the cathode and the active layer must be effectively reduced to form a good ohmic contact. The WF of commonly used cathodes, such as Al, does not match the LUMO of the acceptor.31–33 In order to reduce energy loss and improve the charge collection efficiency, low WF metals, such as Ca and Ba, are usually adopted to modify the cathode. However, these low WF metals are easily corroded by oxygen and moisture in the air, thereby seriously affecting the efficiency and stability of the PSCs. Additionally, the reactivity of the hot metal atoms can result in chemical reactions and interdiffusion at the organic-semiconductor/metal interface during the thermal evaporation of the metal electrode, which can greatly affect the overall device stability. Therefore, cathode modification is required to protect the active layer and obtain a good ohmic contact for efficient electron extraction and hole blocking.
The commonly used cathode buffer layers include n-type metal oxides (such as TiOx and ZnO), transition metal chelates (titanium chelates and zirconium chelates), and alkali metal compounds (such as LiF, CsF and Cs2CO3). In the following section, the preparation of solution processable metal oxides and metal chelates used as cathode buffer layers in both conventional and inverted structure PSCs will be reviewed, and their effects on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs will be discussed.
3.1 Titanium dioxide
TiO2 is a commonly used n-type metal oxide, which has been extensively applied in dye sensitized solar cells.163,164 In recent years, TiO2 has also been used as a cathode modification material in PSCs.99,100,165–167 The CB of solution processed TiOx is ∼4.4 eV,99,165 which is slightly higher than the WF of an Al electrode (4.3 eV). TiO2 film also shows a large band gap of 3.7 eV and a VB of 8.1 eV.99,165 The VB is deep enough to block the holes from being efficiently transported to the cathode.168 In order to realize a better ohmic contact at the solution processed TiO2/Al cathode, introducing Cs2CO3 as a dopant into the TiO2 matrix is an effective method to obtain a more desirable WF.167 XPS results (Fig. 25d) show that the Ti 2p3/2 spectrum for TiO2:Cs shifts toward a lower binding energy by 0.78 eV in comparison with the value for pristine TiO2, which could be ascribed to the partially reduced Ti ions. The Cs 3d5/2 peak position of TiO2:Cs also shifts towards a lower binding energy in comparison with that of Cs2CO3. The charge transfer between TiO2 and Cs leads to a decrease in the CB level of the TiO2:Cs layer to 3.93 eV, which gives rise to the formation of an improved ohmic contact at the cathode, facilitating the electron extraction and hole blocking.

High electron mobility is also an essential requirement for the buffer layers used in PSCs, which strongly affects the charge collection ability of the electrode and the series resistance of the device. For TiO2, the high electron mobility in these materials relies on the high crystallinity of the TiO2 lattice, while the crystallinity is closely related to the preparation conditions. In general, in order to achieve crystalline TiO2 with relatively high electron mobility, treatment at a high temperature (above 450 °C) is required, which is incompatible with flexible PSCs using plastic substrates. Fortunately, amorphous TiO2 is found to have sufficient electron mobility to meet the need for electron collection for PSCs. The electrical properties of amorphous TiOx prepared through a low temperature sol–gel method are strongly dependent on the processing conditions, and amorphous TiOx prepared by this method exhibits good electron transport properties, with an electron mobility of ca. 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.99 Doping is a simple approach for improving conductivity. Doping the TiO2 cathode buffer layer with Cs ions can increase the conductivity of the cathode buffer layer.167
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) is commonly used as a precursor to produce a TiOx buffer layer.99,169–173 Kim et al. used a low temperature solution-based sol–gel process to prepare an amorphous TiOx layer.99 Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 was mixed with 2-methoxyethanol and ethanolamine, and the mixed solution was heated at 80 °C for 2 h and 120 °C for 1 h, sequentially. The typical precursor was finally diluted with isopropyl alcohol. The TiOx precursor solution was first spin casted on top of the substrate, followed by hydrolysis in an ambient atmosphere for conversion to TiOx. The TiOx film was then heated at low temperature (150 °C) for 10 min to achieve a smooth amorphous layer. The TiOx film functions not only as an electron collection layer but also as an optical spacer. Upon the modification of the spatial distribution of the light intensity inside the device, a PSC with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC60BM/TiOx/Al showed a 50% enhancement in Jsc in comparison with similar devices without the optical spacer. The device using the D–A co-polymer PCDTBT as the donor and PC70BM as the acceptor exhibited the best PCE of 6.1%, and the internal quantum efficiency was close to 100%.100 By further optimization, using vacuum deposited MoOx instead of PEDOT:PSS, the PCE of a device with PCDTBT:PC70BM as the active layer and solution-processed TiOx as the cathode buffer layer increased to 6.5%, and the device also exhibited significantly greater air stability.174 The increased Jsc of the device compared to that of the device based on PEDOT:PSS could be primarily attributed to favorable redistribution of the light intensity within the active layer because of the refractive index matching between the MoOx and PCDTBT:PC70BM layers.174 Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is also a commonly used precursor to prepare colloidal crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles. In general, a high temperature is not required for such reactions. Park et al. synthesized nanocrystalline TiO2 using a nonhydrolytic sol–gel approach from a TiCl4 precursor. The solution of TiCl4 was mixed with ethanol and benzyl alcohol for 9 h at 80 °C, and then washed with diethyl ether. The obtained TiO2 precipitate was dispersed in ethanol for TiO2 film preparation. The TiO2 solution was also mixed with Cs2CO3 2-ethoxyethanol solution for the preparation of Cs ion doped TiOx layers.167
3.2 Zinc oxide
ZnO is another commonly used cathode buffer layer for PSCs, which typically exhibits n-type conductivity. ZnO is a direct band gap semiconductor with a wide band gap of ∼3.37 eV. The positions of the VB and CB of ZnO prepared by the sol–gel method are located at ∼4.4 eV and ∼7.7 eV, respectively.90,109 These energy levels give ZnO efficient electron extraction ability and hole blocking capability, and are beneficial for decreasing the contact resistance and enhancing the parallel resistance.
Modification of the ZnO surface with self-assembled monolayered dipolar molecules is a convenient method to modulate the WF of ZnO, and passivate the surface traps, which benefits the charge extraction and transfer. The dipolar monolayers can be assembled either at the ZnO/organic-semiconductor interface or at the ZnO/metal electrode interface. Several kinds of dipolar molecules,88,176–184 such as carboxylic acids, phosphonic acids, benzoic acid, thiols, acetylacetonate, and various silanes, have been used to modify the ZnO/organic-semiconductor interface in optoelectronic devices, including light emitting diodes and PSCs. The self-assembled monolayer (SAM) helps to tailor the energy level offset between the ZnO and organic-semiconductor layers, and further affects the morphology of the upper active layer. Ha et al. used a series of benzoic acid (BA) derivative-based dipolar molecules to modify ZnO film.183–185Fig. 26 shows the effect of the SAMs on the interfacial dipole of the ZnO cathode buffer layers. The orientation of the dipolar molecules determines the direction of the interface dipole. The SAMs of BBA and MBA on ZnO result in an interface dipole with the negative pole directed towards ZnO, leading to decreased WF and surface potential. Contrastingly, modification of ZnO with FBA increases the WF and surface potential. By selecting a suitable molecule to form a dipolar monolayer, the Jsc, Voc and FF of the PSC can be enhanced simultaneously.183

Brenner et al. investigated the evolution of the surface WF of ZnO modified by monolayers mixed with two kinds of molecules with opposite dipole moments, phenyltriethoxysilane (PTES) and 4-chlorophenyl triethoxysilane (4CPTES), as shown in Fig. 27a.88 It was found that the WF of the ZnO surface could be tuned over 0.6 eV by adjusting the ratio of the two components (Fig. 27b).

(b) Effect of the ratio of the two modified molecules, PTES and 4CPTES, on the contact potential difference (relative WF) Δφ of the SAM modified ZnO buffer layer relative to that of the unmodified ZnO buffer layer. The error bars indicate the reproducibility of a measurement in a particular experiment.88 
When low-work-function Al is used as the cathode, the insertion of a ZnO buffer layer can facilitate the formation of ohmic contact at the cathode interface. However, when high-work-function metals such as Ag and Au are used as the cathode, Schottky contact will be formed at the ZnO/metal interface, which results in a reduction in Voc and thus poor device performance.90,91 In order to optimize Voc and contact resistance, ohmic contact is required at the ZnO/metal interface. SAM modification also provides a simple approach to further improve the contact properties between the ZnO buffer layer and different metals.90,91,186 In order to realize ohmic contact at the cathode, the energy offset between the CB of ZnO and the WF of the metal (see Fig. 28b(ii)) must be eliminated. A net dipole directed towards the ZnO surface (away from the metal) (Fig. 28b(iv)) can help achieve this goal. Contrastingly, the Schottky barrier will be increased (Fig. 28b(iii)). A series of parasubstituted benzoic acids-based (BA–X)90 and saturated carboxylic acid-based91 dipolar molecules have been developed to modulate the ZnO/metal interface properties, and the experimental results confirmed the above proposal. The performance of PSCs significantly depends on the dipole direction and chemical bonding between the SAM and the metal cathodes. When –X represents an electron-donating group (–OCH3, –CH3, –H), the net interfacial dipole across the ZnO/BA–X/metal junction is directed towards the ZnO surface, which is beneficial to the improvement in device performance. However, in the opposite case, an electron withdrawing group (–SH, –CF3, –CN) results in a net interfacial dipole towards the metal. The performance of the device decreases with increasing electronegativity of the –X group (–SH, –CF3, –CN).90 With an appropriate choice of SAM modifiers, highly efficient PSCs with a maximum PCE of 4.6% were achieved with a P3HT:PCBM active layer.91 The hybridization of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) with insulating poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) can also be used to tune the electrical properties of ZnO films. The addition of PEG can lower the EA of ZnO, which is beneficial to the formation of ohmic contact with high WF metals.103 A conjugated polyelectrolyte, PFN–Br, was also used to modify sol–gel processed ZnO film.187 The LUMO of ZnO can be tailored using PFN–Br film. The UPS results show that there is a ∼0.26 eV energy difference between the ZnO/PFN–Br layer and the ZnO layer, indicating that a dipole is formed at the PFN–Br/ZnO interface. The band alignment with PFN–Br film leads to a large Voc for the inverted PSCs.

(b) Schematic illustration of the energy level diagram of the devices with (i) a metal-only cathode, (ii) a ZnO/metal bilayer cathode, (iii) a ZnO/SAM/metal cathode with an interfacial dipole directed towards the metal surface, and (iv) a ZnO/SAM/metal cathode with an interfacial dipole directed away from the metal surface.90 
ZnO has much higher electron mobility in comparison with TiO2. The electron mobility of ZnO can reach as high as ∼440 cm2 V−1 s−1 for pulse laser deposited ZnO thin films,188,189 higher than 20 cm2 V−1 s−1 for ZnO nanofibers190,191 and 2.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for solution-processed ZnO NP film.192 Similar to TiO2, the charge carrier mobility of ZnO is highly dependent on its crystallinity.193 In general, the electron mobility of solution processed ZnO film increases with increasing annealing temperature.109 In addition, the disorder of the nanostructured ZnO film may also lead to reduced carrier mobility and an increased electron recombination rate due to the enhanced scattering of free electrons. Doping is also a simple approach for improving the conductivity of ZnO. Solution processed amorphous zinc tin oxide (ZTO) also shows higher electron mobility than TiO2.194 The conductivity of the solution processed aluminum-doped zinc oxide was found to be three orders of magnitude higher than that of the intrinsic ZnO.195
For the preparation of ZnO through a sol–gel process, zinc acetate (ZnAc) is the commonly used precursor. The morphology, structure, size, and shape of the ZnO particles, closely correlated to their electronic and optical properties, are strongly dependent on the processing conditions, such as solvent, concentration, processing temperature, and additives. White et al. first introduced a ZnO cathode buffer layer derived from ZnAc on ITO into inverted PSCs.28 The ZnO layer was prepared by spin coating a ZnAc solution in 96% 2-methoxy ethanol and 4% ethanolamine onto the ITO, then annealing at a high temperature of 300 °C for 5 min in air to convert the precursor into ZnO. The resultant film consisted of crystalline ZnO with nanoscale domain sizes, and showed similar photoconductivity to sputtered undoped ZnO films. The PCE of the inverted PSC with P3HT:PC60BM as the photoactive layer and the ZnO cathode buffer layer reached 2.97%. Kyaw et al. used the same method to produce ZnO film as the ECL, and investigated the influence of precursor concentration, sol–gel process and ZnO film thickness on the photovoltaic performance and reliability of the PSCs.196,197 It was found that a reduction in the sol concentration resulted in decreased grain size and surface roughness of the ZnO film, and at the same time, improved the transmittance. However, the biggest problem with this approach is the high annealing temperature (above 300 °C), which is not compatible with flexible substrates. When the same precursor was annealed at a lower temperature of 200 °C, amorphous ZnO composite film was obtained.198,199 Although the electron mobility of the ZnO composite was nearly four orders of magnitude lower than the polycrystalline ZnO obtained by annealing the precursor at 500 °C, it is still compatible to that of most organic materials used as the electron-transporting layer.198 To further optimize the device performance, TiO2 nanorods synthesized by hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide were employed to modify the ZnO surface. The TiO2 nanorods interlayer can not only enhance carrier collecting efficiency, but also provide an additional exciton separation interface between the polymer and the TiO2 nanorods.
Sun et al. modified the synthesis procedure with the same precursor and obtained ZnO thin films at a relatively low annealing temperature (≤200 °C).109 The atomic concentrations of Zn and O were determined to be 1:1.12 for a 130 °C annealed sample and 1:1.22 for a 200 °C annealed sample. The resultant ZnO films were amorphous and showed low surface roughness. The electron mobility increased with increasing annealing temperature. Yusoff et al. prepared ZnO films via the same method to modify ITO, and incorporated graphene oxide (GO) as the anode buffer layer.200 The use of GO and ZnO leads to improved device stability and enhanced device efficiency.
Zinc acetylacetonate (Zn(acac)2) hydrate is another precursor utilized to prepare ZnO layers.201 This hydrated material can be converted to ZnO through a single step conversion at lower temperature (below 120 °C) and high humidity conditions. The low temperature treatment is beneficial to applications for flexible PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs with the solution-processed ZnO cathode buffer layer was similar to that of PSCs with conventional structures for three efficient polymer:fullerene systems,176 indicating that solution-processed ZnO with low temperature annealing is a promising cathode buffer layer material for PSCs.
Another class of low temperature precursors for producing ZnO is based on amine and hydroxy nitrate compounds.115 Meyers et al. reported a method to fabricate ZnO film by spin-coating a stable and non-toxic aqueous precursor solution of an amine–hydroxo zinc complex, [Zn(NH3)x](OH)2, and subsequent annealing at a low temperature of 150 °C.202 Heating at 150 °C provided sufficient energy to obtain ZnO with a mobility of up to 1.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 from the complex by ammonia dissociation and dehydration, followed by crystallization. Bai et al. used this method to prepare a ZnO layer (annealed at 150 °C) as a cathode buffer layer for inverted PSCs.203 The effects of the ZnO annealing temperature on the photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs with a ZnO cathode buffer layer were systematically studied by Ka et al.204 The performance of the inverted devices shows an abrupt improvement when the annealing temperature increases from 60 °C to 80 °C, which could be attributed to the improvement in the energy level alignment arising from increases in the relative amount and the crystallinity of ZnO. The P3HT:PC60BM-based devices showed almost identical performance as the annealing temperature of ZnO increased above 80 °C, and a PCE of 3.6% was achieved with a low annealing temperature of 80 °C.204 These results show a promising approach for the fabrication of high quality ZnO cathode buffer layers for PSCs at low temperatures.
3.3 Other metal oxides
Tin oxide (SnOx) is an excellent transparent conductive material. In order to improve its conductivity and stability, tin oxide is often doped with fluorine (FTO) or mixed with indium oxide (ITO). FTO and ITO, which are often prepared by vacuum based deposition techniques, are the most widely used transparent electrodes in optoelectronic devices. Tin chlorides, such as SnCl4 and SnCl2, and Sn–alkoxides can be used as precursors to prepare SnOx through sol–gel routes.205–208 However, high temperature treatment is needed to remove organic residues or to induce crystallization. Trost et al. used tetrakis(diethylamino)tin (TDEASn) as a precursor to prepare SnOx.209 TDEASn was dissolved in isopropanol, and a small amount (5 vol%) of acetylacetone was added to stabilize the precursor and control the growth of particles, and to reduce the speed of the cross-linking process in the sol. The spin coated films were subsequently stored in ambient air for 1 h for hydrolysis. The particle size in the sol was determined to be of the order of 5 nm. XPS measurements confirmed that the resultant SnOx film was free from the high vapor pressure diethylamino species, while an upper limit for the carbon concentration (from acetylacetone residue) of 18 at% was detected.
Cerium oxide (CeOx) is a stable metal oxide, which has a large band gap and can be used as a photo-anode in dye sensitized solar cells,210 a light absorber in organic-dye-free solar cells,211 and an antireflection coating in silicon solar cells.212 We prepared a nanostructured CeOx buffer layer on the photoactive layer simply by spin-coating its suspended solution, which was obtained by mixing cerium(IV) isopropoxide and acetic acid in isopropyl alcohol.25 The CeOx layer forms a nanostructured inverted corn structure on the photoactive layer and increases the surface area effectively (Fig. 29), which leads to efficient light trapping within the device and enhanced light absorption in the active layer. The use of CeOx buffer layer results in significant improvements in Jsc and Voc, and the PCE of the device with a PBDTBDD:PC60BM photoactive layer can reach as high as 8.52%.

3.4 Transition metal chelates
Some metal–acetylacetonate chelates can be directly used as cathode buffer layers without decomposition into metal oxides. Recently, we have developed a series of transition metal chelates, such as titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD),17,66,70 titanium(IV) oxide bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TOPD)69,213 and zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac),24 as cathode buffer layers in both conventional and inverted PSCs. These materials can achieve relatively high electron mobility under relatively mild conditions.17,69 They also possess the advantages of solution processability with protonic solvents (such as isopropanol and isooctanol) and appropriate energy levels, which is beneficial to the formation of a good ohmic contact with minimum resistance at the cathode interface.
The preparation of ZrAcac is very simple.24 By adding the ZrAcac powder to the anhydrous ethanol solvent and then stirring for 3 h, a colorless solution with concentration of 0.25–2 mg mL−1 was obtained. The ZrAcac film was prepared simply by spin-coating the ZrAcac solution on the photoactive layer without any additional post-treatment. The energy diagram of as-prepared ZrAcac on the ITO substrate is shown in Fig. 6. The IP and WF were measured by UPS to be 4.32 eV and 2.37 eV, respectively. The EA of 1.22 eV was obtained from the band gap of 3.1 eV (determined from the onset of the absorption (400 nm)). This WF (2.37 eV) is extremely low among the reported values of metal compounds,80 and lies above the LUMO levels of the commonly used fullerene derivative acceptors. According to the universal energy level alignment rule, the LUMO level of the organic-semiconductors will be pinned to the Fermi level of the buffer layer, inducing a “barrier free” electron extraction from the LUMOs of the acceptors.24 The introduction of ZrAcac decreases the series resistance of the whole device and increases photocurrent due to the remarkable improvements in charge extraction and light harvesting. The PCE of the PSC based on D–A copolymer PBDTBDD as the electron donor, reached a best PCE of 9.23%, which is greatly improved in comparison with that (7.34%) of the device with a traditional Ca/Al cathode. The obtained results demonstrate that the transition metal chelates possess great potential as cathode buffer layer materials for highly efficient PSCs. In addition, the mechanism for energy level alignment at the chelates/organic-semiconductor interface and the influence of different ligands on the charge extraction efficiency still require further investigation.
TIPD also shows a similar effect to ZrAcac when used as an ECL for PSCs. TIPD film can be fabricated by spin coating its isopropanol solution on the substrate, and then thermal annealing at a relatively low temperature. Detailed characterizations of the TIPD samples were carried out to investigate the mechanism of the effect of thermal annealing of the TIPD layer on the photovoltaic performance of the devices. TIPD exhibits good energy level matching with fullerene derivatives.17,66,69,70 The electron mobility of the TIPD layers increases with the annealing temperature. The electron mobility of the TIPD layers without annealing treatment is ca. 8.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, measured with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. This value can be increased to 2.8 × 10−4 and 1.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 by annealing at 60 °C and 150 °C, respectively;17 these values are higher than those of most organic electron transport materials used in optoelectronic devices. The measurement of the surface contact angle of the TIPD layer shows that after being annealed at a low temperature (60 °C), the surface of the TIPD layer changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which is beneficial for the intimate contact with the active layer, which is spin-coated from an organic solution. The PCE of the inverted PSC based on PBDTTT-C:PC70BM with the TIPD cathode buffer layer reached 7.4%.17 Through analyzing the FTIR and XPS spectra of TIPD, it was found that TIPD after thermal annealing at 150 °C changed to TOPD, as shown in Fig. 30. TOPD is also a commercially available titanium chelate, which can be directly used as a cathode modification material for PSCs.69,213 The direct use of TOPD could further lower the annealing temperature and shorten the annealing time. The TOPD cathode buffer layer was simply prepared by spin-coating TOPD isopropanol solution on the substrate and then annealing at 80 °C for 15 min. The Jsc and the Voc of PSCs can be simultaneously enhanced via introducing TOPD as the cathode modification layer.

4. Conclusion and perspective
In conclusion, the electrodes play a key role of charge extraction and collection in PSCs, thus the characteristics of the photoactive layer/electrode interface are critical to the performance of the device. Interface engineering plays an important role in fine-tuning the electrode properties for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Solution-processable metal compounds, especially metal oxides and transition metal chelates, are promising electrode buffer layers from the viewpoint of electronic energy alignment, optical absorption, and charge transport properties. The buffer layer can modulate the roughness of the substrate, prevent the hot metal atoms from diffusing into the organic layer, and act as water and oxygen barriers. In addition, in some cases the buffer layer can also serve as an optical spacer to enhance light absorption, and thereby increase the photocurrent. However, any kind of electrode buffer layer will have difficulty satisfying all of the above functions. Therefore, the development and optimization of the interface materials and further understanding of the mechanism will help to further improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
Although a variety of precursors have been used to prepare electrode buffer layers, advanced technological improvements are still needed to precisely control the film properties, such as the thickness, morphology, crystallinity, and WF. Additionally, the development of more environmentally friendly and nontoxic interface materials, which can be processed through low temperature solution methods, is still an important issue for the realization of low-cost, printable, light weight, large-area and flexible devices.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their advantages of low cost, light weight and their capability to be fabricated into flexible and semitransparent devices. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs must be further improved for their future application. The photovoltaic materials in the active layer and the electrode buffer layers are the most important materials for improving the PCE and stability of PSCs, and the solution processable electrode buffer layer materials are desirable for the preparation of PSCs by low cost printing techniques. In this paper, we reviewed the recent progress in solution processable anode and cathode buffer layer materials based on metal oxides and metal chelates in conventional and inverted PSCs. The solution processable electrode buffer layers discussed in this paper include the cathode buffer layers of TiO2, ZnO, and some transition metal chelates (TIPD, TOPD, ZrAcac, etc.) and the anode buffer layers of NiO, MoO3, V2O5, WO3, ReOx, etc. The preparation methods, electronic energy levels and photovoltaic performance of the electrode buffer layers are described in detail for the reference of the readers.

 	Fig. 4  Energy level alignment at the interface of transition metal oxides and C60. The HOMO edge offset (ΔEH) of C60 is plotted against the WF (Φsub) of the underlying metal oxides. Three regimes can be identified. The energy positions of key parameters in each scenario are shown in the schematics beside each region. Note that these inset schematics are not drawn to scale.78	 

 	Fig. 5  Plots of WF versus the nominal average oxidation states of metal atoms in several transition metals and transition metal oxides. The oxides were grown as thin films via in situ oxidation.80	 

 	Fig. 6  Energy levels of the metal oxides and metal chelates prepared using different methods.	 

 	Fig. 7  Energy level alignment at an ideal metal oxide–organic interface (ELC) can be tuned by introducing a dipolar layer at the surface of the metal oxide before depositing the organic layer. The dipole introduces an electrostatic potential shift to charges crossing the interface, shifting the vacuum level between the metal oxide and organic material. The vacuum level shift will either (a) decrease or (c) increase the WF of the metal oxide surface compared to (b) its unmodified state. The shift in WF can be measured as a contact potential difference.88
