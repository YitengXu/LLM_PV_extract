    , Accepted 24th November 2013First published on 25th November 2013AbstractEfficient organic solar cells (OSCs) based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene):fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61butyric acid methyl ester composites have been fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates by a radio frequency (RF) sputtered and ultraviolet ozone (UVO) treated MoS2 film as the hole-transport layer (HTL). With the help of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transmission spectra and the Hall-effect system, we find that the deposition temperature can modulate the contents of the various valence states of molybdenum, which can result in changes of the energy level, and the optical and electrical properties of the MoS2 films. MoS2 has been oxidized to a double-layered MoO3–MoS2 film by UVO treatment. Due to the presence of the molybdenum oxidation states Mo5+ and Mo6+, the MoS2 film shows p-type conductive behavior, and its smaller electron affinity can effectively block electron from exciton dissociation. By optimizing the HTL thickness and sputtering deposition temperature, a power conversion efficiency up to 4.15% has been achieved for an OSC that used a double-layered MoO3–MoS2 film as the HTL. Its JSC is bigger than that of the OSC with a pure MoO3 film as the HTL. This shows that this double layer MoO3–MoS2 interface is more favorable for hole-transfer.
Introduction
In a society concerned with the environmental, economic, and geopolitical consequences of energy consumption, new alternatives to traditional energy sources are needed. With rapid progress being made in organic photovoltaics, they are becoming a viable source of renewable energy, as power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% have been reported.1 Great attention has been paid to organic solar cells (OSCs) based on blends of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives, due to their potential application for fabricating low-cost, light weight, and large-area flexible devices as renewable energy sources.2,3 A vast number of studies involve a blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), for which solar cell efficiencies up to ∼5.0% have been realized.4 For a traditional OSC, its hole-transport layer (HTL) must have a high optical transparency, good chemical stability, a large ionization potential, and good electron blocking capability.5 In a typical OSC, poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used as the HTL to smooth the surface of the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode.3,6 However, conventional devices with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL usually suffer from a long-term interface stability problem, due to the hygroscopic and acidic nature of the PEDOT:PSS.7 Therefore, efforts to replace PEDOT:PSS with transition metal oxide semiconductors, such as NiO,5,8,9 MoO3,3,10–12 V2O5,10,13 Cr2O3,14 and WO3,15–17 are currently receiving increased attention in conventional OSCs.
Among the metal oxide HTLs used in OSCs, MoO3 is a promising candidate, owing to its relatively good hole-mobility, environmental stability, and transparency. MoO3 thin films have initially been considered to have the valence band edge at 5.4 eV,10–12 the conduction band edge at 2.3 eV,18 and a work function (WF) of 5.2 eV,19 indicating it has a p-type conductive mechanism. MoO3 prepared by evaporation however possesses a Fermi level that is pinned at 6.86 eV, an electron affinity (EA) of 6.70 eV, and an ionization energy (IE) of 9.68 eV, which shows that it is an n-type material.20 The high EA enables the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of many organic semiconductors to possess a sufficient density of states overlap with the empty MoO3 conduction band states to allow the ground state hole-charge of organic semiconductor transferring to MoO3.21,22 Moreover, the local electron depletion of the donor and acceptor phases at the interface would in principle act to reduce back-contact recombination of the electrons from fullerene acceptors, while improving the hole-collection from the donor materials at this interface. Such a situation may explain why n-type MoO3 modified anodes have been so successfully used as the HTL in OSCs.23,24 However, because of its significantly deeper valence band edge, Wong's group25 considered that holes are not transported to ITO through the valence band of MoOx, instead through the MoOx gap states. This hole-selective behavior can be explained by invoking band bending at the MoOx–organic interface, which could partially block electrons. Therefore, a p-type semiconductor is an essential, but not necessary requirement for HTLs.
Hole-mobility is typically much lower than that of an electron in an OSC.26–28 It is thus very important to let the hole transport smoothly through its HTL and related interfaces effectively, for improving the efficiency of an OSC. Inorganic metal oxide films are multivalent complexes with many defects (especially surface defects),20,25,29 and these defects could have very strong adsorption properties for water and oxygen, which are not beneficial to the stability of an OSC. Therefore, many research groups have tried to improve the hole-mobility and stability of inorganic oxide HTLs from every aspect. Besides that, various fabrication methods, such as thermal evaporation,10,12 the sol–gel method,3,23,25 sputtering deposition,30 and ultraviolet ozone (UVO)31 and plasma32 treatment have been employed to prepare HTLs. Some groups attempted to increase the electrical conductivity of the HTL by inserting a thin metal, and make the HTL into a sandwich structure without sacrificing their transmittance, to improve the HTLs' property of hole-collecting.33–35 Other groups added metal36–39 and metal oxide nanoparticles40 into PEDOT:PSS, to exploit the surface plasmon resonance effects to optimize light harvesting, and further to enhance the PCE and stability of the OPV devices. Moreover, ultrathin silver oxide41 and carbon nanotubes42 were inserted between the anode and PEDOT:PSS to improve the hole-collecting property of OSCs, due to their high electrical conductivity and appropriate WF.
MoS2 is known to have a high mobility of ∼200 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 350 cm2 V−1 s−1,43,44 which suggests it is a promising material for various applications in electronic devices. However, to date, only a few approaches for utilizing MoS2 as an interfacial layer in organic electron devices have been reported, despite its excellent electronic properties,31,32,45 which might be due to WF values that are slightly mismatched with the electrode and organic materials and its band-gap value, that is small for a direct band-gap of single-layer MoS2 (1.8 eV), or an indirect band-gap of bulk MoS2 (1.2 eV).46 However, p- or n-doping treatments have been utilized to modulate the WF of MoS2, to decrease the barrier height of the charge transport and thus improve the device characteristics.47
Metal-oxide HTLs are sandwiched between two interfaces: an interface with a solid organic semiconductor, and an interface with an electrode material. The low energy barriers at the interfaces are believed to be a result of a favorable energy-level alignment between the anode and organic material, which is largely influenced by the metal-oxide’s WF. The interfaces between metal-oxides and electrode materials have been studied, especially in the field of inorganic semiconductor devices, for many decades. Over the past 15 years, the field of OSCs research has thoroughly paid attention to the metal oxide–organic-semiconductor side of OSCs, yet relatively few papers have focused on the metal-oxide–electrode material interface, and little is known regarding how this interface affects the properties that are most relevant to OSCs, namely the WF and electron band structure.20
Beside removing the attached surface pollutants, UVO treatment has been used to reduce the surface defect of the HTL and to make a better contact with the photoactive layer (PAL).30 To date, few paper have paid attention to growing a metal oxide film as the HTL by this method.31 In this paper, we report the fabrication and characterization of OSCs based on MoO3 films as the HTL. These MoO3 films were obtained by the ozone oxidization of MoS2 films that were fabricated using the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method. The MoS2 films have been fabricated using different temperatures and film thickness on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), silicon and glass sheet substrates. After ozone oxidation, a thin layer of MoS2 film still existed, probably at the MoO3–FTO interface. We also demonstrate that the substrate temperatures and film thickness during the MoS2 film sputtering process affect the PCE of the OSCs and the OSC with MoO3–MoS2 shows a 15.3% improvement in the PCE, compared to that in a device with MoO3 only as the HTL.
Experimental details
The MoS2 films were prepared by a RF magnetron sputtering system, using a ceramic MoS2 (99.9% pure) target in an Ar atmosphere. The chamber was pumped down to <3 × 10−4 Pa and backfilled with the sputtering gas, to a pressure of 1.0 Pa. The FTO, glass sheet and silicon substrates were cleaned with successive rinses in ultrasonic baths of acetone, ethanol, and deionized water and blown with dry N2, before deposition. Both the high-purity Ar (99.999% pure) flow rates were modulated by mass-flow controllers during the deposition. The total gas flow rate remained at 10 sccm. The substrate temperatures were varied between room temperature (RT) and 673 K, for different samples. Pre-sputtering was performed, to obtain a steady-state sputtering condition. The deposition rate (∼0.5 nm s−1), as well as the nominal film thickness, was monitored with a quartz crystal thickness monitor (TM-400, Maxtek, USA). Using a surface profilometer (FTS2-S4C-3D, Taylor Hobson, UK), the film thicknesses were checked and a good agreement was obtained. The distance between the target and the substrate was about 7 cm and the target was located beneath the substrate. The deposition power was kept at 40 W and the thickness of the films was controlled by the sputtering time. Then, the MoS2 films were irradiated for oxidation by a UVO cleaning machine (Novascan, PSD-UV, USA) under air ambience, at room temperature. The irradiation time was 60 min. A reference ca. 10 nm MoO3 film as the OSC's HTL was deposited by a RF magnetron sputtering system, using a metal molybdenum (99.99% pure) target, according to the parameters in ref. 48.
The crystal structure of the films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Conventional XRD in the Bragg–Brentano configuration was also performed by the same Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Line traces were collected over 2θ values ranging from 20° to 60°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed using a XPS/UPS system (Thermo Scientific, ESCLAB 250Xi, USA). All the films were sputtering-cleaned, to remove atmospheric contamination in the XPS chamber for approximately 20 s, by the lower energy of Ar+, and the Ar+ gun was operated at 0.5 kV, at a pressure of 1 × 10−7 Pa. The vacuum pressure of the analysis chamber was better than 2 × 10−8 Pa. For XPS, survey scans to identify the overall surface composition and chemical states were performed, using a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (=1486.68 eV), detecting photoelectrons at a 150 eV pass energy and a channel width of 500 meV. High-resolution scans to identify the bonding states were performed at a 20 eV pass energy and 50 meV channel width. The surface carbon signal at 284.6 eV was used as an internal standard. The depth profiling rate under these conditions was estimated as ∼3.0 nm min−1 in reference to a SiO2–Si film system. UPS was carried out using He I radiation at 21.22 eV, from a discharge lamp operated at 90 W, a pass energy of 10 eV, and a channel width of 25 meV. Conductive, grounded samples were run without charge compensation. A −9 V bias was applied to the samples, in order to separate the sample and analyzer low-kinetic-energy cutoffs. Raman measurements were performed with a Raman spectroscopy (DXR, Thermo Scientific, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 632.8 nm, at room temperature. The square resistance was determined by a Hall-effect measurement system (Model 7707A, Lake Shore, USA) in a van der Pauw geometry, at RT. The transmittance of these films was measured by a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (CARY5000, Varian) in the 200–800 nm wavelength range, at RT. The morphology of the S–MoO3 films was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM SPM-9500J3, Shimadzu, Japan) with the contact mode (scanning tip: single-crystal Si3N4, spring constant: 0.02 N m−1).
Regioregular P3HT (Rieke Metals, Inc.) and PCBM (Nano-C) were used for PAL. Thin film OSCs were prepared by the blends of P3HT:PCBM (1:1 by weight) in chlorobenzene. After the HTLs were prepared on a FTO glass (Rsheet = 14 Ω per sq) substrate, the blends were spin cast on the HTLs at 1000 rpm. Finally, an Al electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation, being approximately 100 nm thick and the whole device was annealed at 423 K, for 7 min. The active layer was 0.07 cm2. The photovoltaic measurement was conducted illuminating the devices under a solar simulator, with a AM1.5G filter. The illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs were examined using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. The simulated light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 and calibrated with a Thorlabs optical power meter. The corresponding incident photo-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured with a QE/IPCE Measurement Kit system (Newport, USA).
Results and discussion
Typical XRD patterns of the as-deposited MoS2 films are shown in Fig. 1. At RT, the weak peak of (101) at ∼33.44°, corresponding to the hexagonal phase, appears, but its intensity is small, indicating that the film crystallization is poor. With the deposition temperature increasing to 573 K, the intensity of the (101) peak increases, which indicates that the films are highly crystalline. However, at 673 K, the intensity of the (101) peak is smaller than that at 573 K, which may indicate that the deposition temperature is close to the boiling point of sulfur (sulfur has a boiling point at 718 K (ref. 49)), and then leads to a larger vibrational degree of the sulfur atom, which can weaken the intensity of the orientation peak.

To characterize the variation of various valence states of the MoS2 films before and after oxidization by UVO treatment, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the samples on a Si substrate at different temperatures were obtained and are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. The XPS spectra have been fitted by Gaussian–Lorentzian curves, corresponding to the peaks of Mo 3d. The relative contents of the various valence states of molybdenum are estimated from the cover of the Gaussian curves. Summaries of the XPS analysis of valence states, peak position and relative content in these films are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Before the MoS2 films were treated by UVO at room temperature (RT), the Mo 3d XPS spectrum is fitted to the doublet peaks at 229.8 and 233.0 eV, corresponding to Mo4+ peaks, with ca. 3.2 eV spin–orbit splitting, a 3.5 eV spin–orbit splitting between the 230.5 and 234.0 eV corresponds to the Mo5+ 3d5/2 and Mo5+ 3d3/2 peaks, and the doublet peaks at 232.0 and 235.4 eV belong to Mo6+ with ca. a 3.4 eV spin–orbit splitting, which reveals that there are three molybdenum oxidation states, 28.0% Mo4+, 44.3% Mo5+, and 27.7% Mo6+, in the film (shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1). According to the literature,50 the spin–orbit doublet with peaks at 228.8 and 231.9 eV is associated with MoS2, and the spin–orbit doublet with peaks at 232.8 and 235.9 eV belongs to Mo6+ peaks. Thus, there is ca. 1.0 eV for the peak Mo4+ to shift to a higher binding energy and ca. 0.8 eV for the Mo6+ to shift to a lower binding energy. Also, their spin–orbit splittings are 3.1 eV more than that reported in the literature.20,31,50 The peaks at 161.8, 163.0, and 226.2 eV belong to the S2− 2p3/2, S2− 2p1/2, and S 2s peaks, respectively. The study of density functional theory has indicated MoS2 is highly susceptible to oxidation by oxygen atoms, and the lower coordinated Mo sites are more susceptible to oxidation than the more highly coordinated Mo sites.51 The higher valence state cations Mo5+ and Mo6+ existing in the film suggests that MoS2 may be partially oxidized to Mo2O5 and MoO3 by the oxygen atom of the ceramic MoS2 target, or the work gas, during deposition, which could result in the generation of some oxygen deficiencies that cause a serious distortion in the mixed molybdenum compound film. So, the peak positions of Mo 3d peak have shifted.

When the deposition temperature increased to 373 K, there were three peaks, at 226.5, 228.8, and 232.0 eV, and two shoulders at 230.1 and 233.1 eV of the Mo 3d peak, which belong to the S 2s, Mo4+ 3d5/2, Mo4+ 3d3/2 Mo5+ 3d5/2, and Mo5+ 3d3/2 (shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1), respectively. Additionally, a dominant Mo 3d doublet was observed, with a 3.2 eV spin–orbit splitting between the Mo4+ 3d3/2 and Mo4+ 3d5/2, which was in agreement with the result reported by Ueno's group.31 Therefore, it can be concluded that the film is composed of two components, MoS2 and Mo2O5 and their contents are 67.2% and 32.8%, respectively. With the deposition temperature increasing from 373 K to 673 K, little change for the peak position of the Mo 3d peak took place. However, the content of MoS2 increased from 67.2% to 76.0% firstly and then decreased to 63.9%; accordingly, the part of Mo5+ decreased from 32.8 to 24.0% firstly and then increased to 36.1%. Worth noting, is that the intensity of S 2p increased first and then decreased too, and the maximum value appeared when the deposition temperature was 573 K (shown in Fig. 2f).
After the MoS2 films were treated by UVO for 60 min at RT, MoS2 films were almost oxidized to molybdenum oxide, and two molybdenum oxidation states, Mo5+ and Mo6+, existed in the film, whose peaks were at 231.5 (Mo5+ 3d5/2), 234.6 (Mo5+ 3d3/2), 232.6 (Mo6+ 3d5/2), and 235.7 (Mo6+ 3d3/2) eV, with a 3.1 eV spin–orbit splitting between the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peak; their contents were 89.4 and 10.6%, respectively (listed in Table 2). However, there was no peak about sulfur (shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2), which suggests that the surface layer of the MoS2 film, at least, was completely oxidized to molybdenum oxide (MoOx). When the deposition temperature increased to 373 K, it was found that there were three molybdenum oxidation states. The Mo 3d peaks at 229.5, 232.9, 231.7 and 234.8 eV correspond to the Mo4+ 3d and Mo5+ 3d peaks, whose contents are 19.0% and 10.3%, respectively (shown in Fig. 3b). A dominant doublet Mo 3d peak at 232.6 and 235.8 eV correspond to the Mo6+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+ 3d3/2 peaks, and the content decreased to 70.7%. Here, although no S 2s peak can be found at ca. 226.5 eV, a very small S 2p peak was at ca. 162.5 eV (shown in Fig. 3f). It can be considered that the outermost MoS2 in the sample is oxidized to MoOx, which hinders oxygen atoms diffusing to protect the bulk crystal from deeper oxidation. Due to the large proportion of the Mo4+ state in the cations of molybdenum, and a negligible intensity of the S 2p peak, the Mo4+ state is derived from MoS2 and MoO2. Therefore, a very small amount of remaining MoS2 could survive at the interface near the substrate.
At 473 K, the Mo 3d XPS spectrum is fitted to the doublet peaks at 229.6 and 233.1 eV, corresponding to the Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 peaks, the peaks at 231.3 and 234.6 eV correspond to the Mo5+ 3d5/2 and Mo5+ 3d3/2 peaks, and the doublet peaks at 232.6 and 235.7 eV belong to Mo6+, with the spin–orbit splitting increasing to ca. 3.1 eV, which reveals that there are three molybdenum oxidation states, 7.3% Mo4+, 4.7% Mo5+, and 88.0% Mo6+, in the film. Also, the small S 2s peak at ca. 226.5 eV and the S 2p peak at ca. 162.5 eV can be found (shown in Fig. 3c and f), which also shows that there is also a very small amount of MoS2 existing at the interface near the substrate, whose content is bigger than that of the sample prepared at 373 K. As the substrate temperature further increases to 673 K, and the Mo 3d peaks effectively do not shift and the S 2s peak and S 2p peak are found, most notable is the content change of the molybdenum oxidation states. The content of Mo4+ first decreases to 5.6% and then increases to 14.4%, and the content of Mo5+ increases to 20.2%, but the part of Mo6+ decreases to 65.4%.
In order to know the oxidation degree of the MoS2 film by UVO, a set of Mo 3d spectra were obtained by an XPS depth profiling measurement for the MoS2 films deposited at different temperatures, and then with UVO treatment (60 min), and are shown in Fig. 4. At the surface of the MoS2 films deposited at 373 K, the peaks of the Mo6+ oxidation state are the main part of the spectra, and a small amount of MoS2 and the Mo5+ oxidation state exist in the surface (shown in Table 2). With the etching depth increasing, the content of Mo6+ decreases and the contents of Mo5+ and Mo4+ increase. When the etching depth is 4.5 nm, Mo4+ peaks constitute the main part of the Mo 3d spectra. Therefore, it can concluded that the oxidation depth of UVO on the MoS2 film deposited at 373 K is ∼4.5 nm, and the main oxidation state of molybdenum in the depth range transits from Mo6+ to Mo5+, and finally into Mo4+ of MoS2. When the deposition temperature increases from 473 K to 573 K, the oxidation depth of UVO on the MoS2 film is the same as that deposited at 373 K. However, with the deposition temperature increasing to 673 K, the oxidation depth increases to ∼6.0 nm, and the full width half maximum of the Mo4+ peaks is significantly larger than that of the MoS2 films deposited below 673 K, which may be related to the vibrational degree of the sulfur atom that can make the dangling bonds S- and Mo-have enough energy to combine with oxygen atoms, and lead to the oxidation of deeper MoS2.

As we know, the higher the temperature is, the better the crystallinity of the films will be. With the substrate temperature increasing, the bulk MoS2 film could be made as much as possible into a two-dimensional ordered structure, that can reduce the risk of MoS2 oxidation.51 However, the high temperature can increase the vibrational degree of the sulfur atom, as sulfur has a melting point at 388 K and a boiling point at 718 K.49 The closer to the boiling point, the larger the Mo–S bond vibrational amplitude will be, thus the dangling bonds S- and Mo- have enough energy to combine with oxygen atoms, which can lead to the oxidation of MoS2. Especially, when the temperature exceeds 643 K,52 the oxidation rate of MoS2 can be increased. This results in great changes in the valence states, peak position and relative content in the MoS2 films. Therefore, a compromise between the crystallinity of the films and the vibrational degree of the sulfur atom must be made, before the film is applied to the HTL of the OSC.
A reference MoO3 film, prepared according to the fabrication conditions in the literature,48 was also analyzed by XPS (shown in Fig. 2g). It is found that two molybdenum oxidation states, 5.3% Mo5+ and 94.7% Mo6+ exist in the film, and the peaks are at 231.1 (Mo5+ 3d5/2), 234.2 (Mo5+ 3d5/2), 232.8 (Mo6+ 3d3/2), and 235.9 (Mo6+ 3d3/2) eV, respectively. The Mo 3d doublets are observed, with a 3.1 eV spin–orbit splitting between the Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 bands (listed in Table 1), which is in agreement with the results reported by Greiner20 and Wagner.50 After treatment by UVO for 60 min at RT, the MoO3 film has 3.7% Mo5+, but the content of Mo6+ increases to 96.3%. Compared with the MoO3 film without UVO treatment, there is ca. 0.5 eV for the Mo5+ peak to shift to a higher binding energy. The electronic band structure of the MoO3 is highly dependent on the molybdenum cation oxidation states.53 The dominant defect in MoO3 is oxygen vacancies, as a result of thermodynamic requirements, which causes Mo5+ cations to form in the film. Certainly, Mo5+ cations are also present, due to a non-zero concentration of O-vacancies.20 UVO treatment decreases the content of Mo5+ existing in the film, which can reduce the O-vacancies and then affect the properties of the MoO3 film. MoO2 is the lowest stable molybdenum oxide, and it contains Mo4+ cations. Compared with the MoS2 films treated by UVO, the characteristic peaks of Mo4+ in the XPS spectra of the MoO3 film were not found (shown in Fig. 2g and 3g). Therefore, we can infer that the Mo4+ in the MoS2 films with UVO comes from MoS2 that survives at the interface near the substrate, and the MoS2 can be oxidized to a double-layered MoO3–MoS2 film by the UVO treatment.
The WF is a property that is difficult to control, due to its extreme sensitivity to many factors, such as the crystal structure, surface defects, valence donor states, coordination environment, chemical state, and electronegativities of the metal cations and oxygen anions in the sample.53–55Fig. 5 shows the UPS spectra of the MoS2 and MoO3 films, and the spectra of the secondary electron cut-off are used for determining the WF (listed in Table 3). Kim's group have reported that MoS2 has a WF of 4.36–4.52 eV.47 In our work, the WF of the MoS2 film deposited at RT is 5.19 eV, which is larger than that reported by Kim's group. This may be due to the presence of the molybdenum oxidation states Mo5+ and Mo6+ in the film. When the deposition temperature increases to 373 K, there is no Mo6+ in the film, but its WF decreases to 5.10 eV. With the deposition temperature increases further, the WF of the MoS2 film shows a decreasing trend, but changes very little.

We know that higher temperature result in a better crystallinity of the films, that can decrease the deficiencies of the film and avoid more MoS2 oxidation. With the substrate temperature increasing from RT to 573 K, the content of the molybdenum oxidation state Mo5+, correlated to an O-deficiency, decreases from 44.3% to 24.0%, which could result in the decrease of the MoS2 WF. At 673 K, although the content of the molybdenum oxidation state Mo5+ increases to 36.1%, the film's WF decreases to 5.02 eV, which may be related to sulfur's boiling point, at 718 K. The Mo coordination can be changed by the high temperature, and then reduce the films' crystallinity, which could decrease the WF of the film.
After the MoS2 films are treated by UVO for 60 min at RT, the WFs of the corresponding films decreases ca. 0.5 eV to that of the MoS2 films without the UVO treatment. Worth noting is that there is a great change for the valence band of these samples before and after the UVO treatment. Before the UVO treatment, the IE of the MoS2 is at 5.48–5.32 eV, that is to say its valence band maximum is at binding energies of around 0.3 eV. After the UVO treatment, the valence band IE of all the samples is at ca. 8.10 eV, which shows that the surface layer of the MoS2 is oxidized to MoO3.
Stoichiometric MoO3 contains only Mo6+ cations, and its valence band maximum is mainly composed of O 2p states.56 The O 2p band can clearly be distinguished in all the UPS spectra, centered at ca. 4.0 eV. The shallow valence features are shown in Fig. 5. There are two distinct gap-state features, labeled (I) and (II). These states are known to arise in MoO3 with O-deficiencies, due to electrons occupying the metal d-band.20 When Mo6+ is reduced, excess electrons move into the low-lying Mo 4d orbitals,57 and give rise to donor states within the MoO3 band gap. Then, the O-vacancy defects cause Mo5+ to appear, which results in the peak centered at ca. 0.9 eV (binding energy) in the valence-band photoemission spectra (labeled (I)). After a certain vacancy concentration, Mo4+ cations begin to form (labeled (II)), and lead to the peak centered at ca. 2.1 eV (binding energy). These illustrate that the oxygen vacancies cause Mo5+ and Mo4+ cations to exist in MoO3, and result in a partially occupied Mo 4d-band within the MoO3 band gap. These gap states act as n-type dopants and push MoO3's Fermi level very close to the conduction band minimum.20,53 Therefore, the MoO3 film was made into an n-type semiconductor.
After treatment by UVO, there is no distinct gap-state feature in the valence band region (shown in Fig. 6), which shows that O-deficiencies arising in MoO3 can be removed by UVO treatment. Also, this make the WF of the MoO3 decrease from 5.20 eV to 5.02 eV. Due to the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration of the vacancies, the O-vacancy in MoO3 cannot be completely removed. Additionally, its concentration is too small to be determined by UPS. However, the small number of defects in the near-stoichiometric MoO3 is sufficient to push the Fermi level close to the conduction band. Therefore, its n-type conductive mechanism cannot change by UVO treatment.
 Fig. 6  UPS spectra of MoS2 and the MoO3 films deposited on a FTO substrate at different temperatures and then with UVO treatment. The full UPS spectra using He I radiation (left), and the valence-band region (right) are included. A reference MoO3 film was prepared at 423 K according to the literature.48 
From the results of the UPS, we cannot find the obvious difference in the valence band between the MoO3 and MoS2 film under UVO treatment. MoS2 can be oxidized to MoO3 by UVO treatment. If some MoS2 survives at the interface near the substrate, a double-layered MoO3–MoS2 film can be formed by this means.

Fig. 7 displays the Raman spectra (excitation 632.8 nm) of the MoS2 films deposited on a FTO substrate at RT, 473 K and 673 K in an air ambient environment. For the MoS2 film deposited at RT, without treatment by UVO, there are two first-order Raman active modes, that are present in most reported MoS2 Raman spectroscopic studies, namely, E12g (375 cm−1), and A1g (410 cm−1). The frequency difference between these two peaks is ∼35 cm−1, which is larger than the ∼26 cm−1 reported by Xiong et al.58,59 and Ryu et al.,60 which would be related to the RF magnetron sputtering method, that would result in the internal stress in the crystal lattice, that leads to the anomalous lattice vibrations. All of the first-order bands are a result of vibrational modes within the S–Mo–S layer, which is due to the vibration of the adjoining rigid layers.61 The peaks around 149, 183, 454, 517, 558, and 650 cm−1 are observed (besides the E12g (375 cm−1) and A1g (410 cm−1) peaks) owing to the resonance Raman scattering. The assignment of the asymmetric peak centered at 454 cm−1 in the bulk MoS2 is an open question. It was previously assigned to the double frequency of the LA (M) mode (227 cm−1).62 Then, the peaks centered at 183 and 650 cm−1 are assigned to the A1g (M)-LA (M) and A1g (M) + LA (M) Raman modes, respectively. The peaks centered at 149, 517, and 558 cm−1 are assigned to the E12g-LA (M), E1g + LA (M), 2E1g Raman modes, respectively. However, the sample shows also the characteristic Raman bands of MoO3. The Raman bands at 994 and 820 cm−1 can be assigned to the stretching vibration of the terminal MoO bonds along the a- and b-axes. The peak at 337 cm−1 is assigned to the bending vibration of O–Mo–O.63 These are the evidence of the partial oxidation of MoS2, which agrees with the result from XPS.
 Fig. 7  Raman spectra (632.8 nm excitation) of the MoS2 films deposited on a FTO substrate at RT, 473 K and 673 K. The black, green and cyan lines are the Raman spectra of the MoS2 films without UVO treatment. The red, blue and magenta lines are the Raman spectra of the MoS2 films with UVO treatment. The data were collected in an air atmosphere at room temperature. 
With the deposition temperature increasing to 473 K, the biggest change is that the peaks related to the oxygen bond almost disappear. Also, the intensity of the A1g and 2LA (M) modes increases, and the intensity of the E12g mode decreases. It is inferred that the high temperature can induce an ordered MoS2 film, that can decrease the O-deficiencies and then avoid more MoS2 oxidation. However, too high a temperature can bring about the change of the interatomic vibration mode. When the substrate temperature increases to 673 K, the peak intensities of two modes E12g and A1g decrease, and that of the mode E1g + LA (M) increases. Additionally, some peaks related to an oxygen bond at 237, 337, 820, 994 cm−1 can be found. These could be the result of the deposition temperature near sulfur's boiling point, resulting from the change of interatomic vibrational mode that causes the oxidation of MoS2. Therefore, we can conclude that substrate temperature affects not only the crystallinity of the films, but also the interatomic vibrational mode, which can alter the structure and property of the films.
After the UVO treatment, it can clearly be seen that the intensity of E12g and A1g modes decrease drastically. Since more dangling bonds leads to the lower crystallinity of the MoS2 films at RT, besides that, the peaks of MoS2 films at 183, 454, and 517 cm−1 disappear, and some new peaks related to an oxygen bond at 285, 237, and 198 cm−1 spring up.64 This shows that the MoS2 in the sample is completely oxidized. MoS2 has a layered structure of hexagons that consist of covalently bonded Mo and S atoms. Due to the existing dangling bonds, the Mo–S–Mo bonds of the outermost surface layers are easily attacked by oxygen in the ozone environment, especially at the edge of the flake. Bulk MoS2 is built up by a van der Waals force that plays a minor role in the stacking structure. The interlayer interval may be a passageway for oxygen atoms to diffuse, and then the deeper Mo–S–Mo bonds have the opportunity to react with oxygen. However, the E12g (M)-LA (M) mode and A1g + LA (M) are stronger after UV-ozone treatement, which would be the anomalous lattice vibrations, that resulted from the local atomic oxygen accumulation or the non-equilibrium of the internal stress release, under the rich oxygen atmosphere. At a high ambient temperature, the change of the interatomic vibrational mode may weaken further the interlayer van der Waals force, and pave a channel of the oxygen diffusion that causes oxidation of the deeper MoS2. However, the better crystallinity of the films prepared at higher temperatures can decrease the dangling bonds, and strengthen the effect of the van der Waals forces, which could reduce the chance to react with oxygen. Thus, there are relatively few MoS2 for oxidation in the films with deposition at a high temperature. With the temperature increasing to 673 K, which approach the boiling point of sulfur, the larger Mo–S bond vibrational amplitude accelerates the dangling bonds S- and Mo- to combine with oxygen atoms, which can lead to the oxidation of MoS2. Therefore, a suitable deposition temperature can make some remaining MoS2 survive at the interface near the substrate, after MoS2 film is treated by UVO.

Fig. 8a shows the transmission spectra of ca. 30 nm MoS2 films deposited on a glass substrate at different temperatures. These thicknesses of the films were obtained by optimized performance in OSCs, with them as HTLs. All of the films are semi-transparent, which can be observed by the naked eye. At RT, the MoS2 film exhibits a transmittance of 70% at a wavelength of 350 nm, and then the transmittance increases almost linearly from 350 to 800 nm. At 800 nm, the transmittance of the MoS2 film is about 87%. With the deposition temperature increasing to 673 K, the transmittance of the films in the range 310–700 nm decreases, but there is little change in the transmittance of the films in the near infrared region. After treatment by UVO, the transmittances of the MoS2 films exhibit an increasing trend and the transmittance exceeds 90% at RT. The minimum transmittance is for the MoS2 film prepared at 673 K. but its transmittance increases 17% at 500 nm by UVO treatment (shown in Fig. 8b).

The dependence of (αhυ)2 on hυ for the MoS2 films deposited at different temperatures: (c) without UVO treatment and (d) with UVO treatment. And the inset is the indirect band gap 0.85 eV for the MoS2 films. The thickness of these thin films is ca. 30 nm. 
The quantitative values of the band-gap energy (Eg) are evaluated using the relation:65 (1)where A is the band edge constant, hυ is the incident photon energy, and the exponent n depends on the kind of optical transition. For crystalline materials, n can take the values 1/2, 3/2, 2, or 3 for directly allowed, directly forbidden, indirectly allowed and indirectly forbidden transitions, respectively.65 Due to oxygen atoms existing in these films, we use the method of the direct band gap to obtain the films' band gap. Then, the best linear fit for a (αhυ)2versus hυ curve is obtained for n = 1/2 for all films. Fig. 8c and d present the variation of (αhυ)2versus hυ for the MoS2 films deposited on a glass substrate at different temperatures before and after UVO treatment, respectively. The optical Eg are given in Table 3. The band-gap of the films decreases from 3.49 eV to 2.48 eV with the deposition temperature increasing from RT to 673 K. However, the band-gap of the films increases with treatment by UVO. The film has 3.63 eV Eg at RT. The Eg decreases to 3.40 eV with the deposition temperature increasing to 673 K. These results are consistent with the variation of transmittance of the films.
When n can take a value of 2 for indirectly allowed transitions, the band-gap from the curve of (ahυ)1/2versus hυ for the MoS2 film (shown in the inset of Fig. 8d) is 0.85 eV, which is in accord with the theoretical study.66–70 Therefore, it can be inferred that some MoS2 survives at the interface near the substrate after it is treated by UVO.
The square resistance (R□) of these films is listed in Table 3. The R□ of the film deposited at RT is 9.84 × 105 Ω per □. With the deposition temperature increasing to 673 K, the R□ of the films firstly decreases to 2.72 × 105 Ω per □ and then increases to 2.90 × 105 Ω per □. The R□ of the film deposited at 573 K is the smallest. Accordingly, after the MoS2 films are treated by UVO, their R□ increases, which suggests that electrical properties of the MoS2 film (if used it as a HTL) becomes worse with UVO treatment.
For a HTL, we hope that it has the smallest resistance and biggest transmittance at the same time. With the deposition temperature increasing from RT to 673 K, the transmittance of the MoS2 films with UVO treatment decreases, however, their R□ firstly decreases and then increases. Considering these two factors, it is concluded that the HTL prepared at 573 K could improve the property of the OSCs.

Fig. 9 shows the AFM images and the square average roughness (RMS) of the MoS2 films deposited on FTO at different deposition temperatures without and with UVO treatment under air ambience at room temperature. The RMS of the MoS2 film deposited at RT is 17.41 nm. The MoS2's RMS increases to 19.82 nm with the deposition temperature increasing to 473 K. At 673 K, the RMS also increases to 20.34 nm. This indicates that the films become much rougher with increasing deposition temperature. After treated by UVO, its RMS decreases to 16.19 nm at RT and the RMSs of the films deposited at 473 and 673 K are 17.00 and 18.03 nm, respectively. It also shows an increasing trend with increasing deposition temperature. However, the RMS of the MoS2 with UVO treatment becomes smoother than that of the MoS2 without UVO treatment, which results from the generation of MoO3 by the UVO treatment.

The thickness of these films in the samples is ca. 100 nm. 
A normal structure of a conventional OSC that employs P3HT as the donor and PCBM as the acceptor material is FTO/HTL/P3HT:PCBM/Al (shown in Fig. 10a). The energy level diagram of the cell is depicted in Fig. 10b. It is expected that charge carriers are transported to the opposite electrode at the interlayer, from this diagram. The Fermi level of the MoS2 films deposited at different temperatures is close to the valence band of the films, as shown in Fig. 10b. It can be inferred that these films are p-type semiconductors. However, due to the mismatched WF with organic materials and the small band-gap, MoS2 is not suitable as a HTL of an OSC. Therefore, we utilized a UVO method to in situ grow MoO3 from MoS2, which can form a double-layer MoO3–MoS2 film to eliminate the mismatch of the WF with organic materials simultaneously and improve the transmittance of the MoS2. As the MoS2 film possesses high mobility characteristics, we can use the double-layer MoO3–MoS2 film as a HTL of an OSC to improve its hole-collecting properties. To testify the performance of OSCs, we fabricated a series of MoS2 films under different deposition temperatures on a FTO substrate. After treatment by UVO, we used them as HTLs of OSCs. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs are presented in Fig. 11, and their photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 4.

Since the oxidation depth of UVO on MoS2 film has a less effect than the deposited temperature, and is about 4.5–6.0 nm, the properties of the OSC could be affected by the deposited temperature, MoS2 thickness and the time of the UVO treatment.
An open-circuit voltage VOC of 0.617 V, a short-circuit current density JSC of 8.57 mA cm−2, a fill factor FF of 44.8%, and a corresponding PCE of 2.58% are obtained when MoS2 deposited at RT and then treated by UVO is used as the HTL of the OSC. The device shows a poor performance. When the MoS2 film is deposited at 373 K and then treated by UVO, the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of the corresponding OSC are improved, to be 0.619 V, 9.24 mA cm−2, 51.4% and 2.94%, respectively. With the deposition temperature increasing to 473 K, the corresponding VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of OSC are improved, to be 0.625 V, 9.69 mA cm−2, 59.3% and 3.59%, respectively. The OSC with a MoS2 film deposited at 573 K has a better performance, and a PCE of 4.15% is recorded for the device with VOC 0.627 V, JSC 9.90 mA cm−2, and FF 67.1%. With the deposited temperature increasing to 673 K, the OSC shows a relatively poor performance, which has a 0.620 V VOC, 9.82 mA cm−2JSC, 64.2% FF, and 3.91% PCE. Therefore, the optimal deposition temperature is 573 K.
If the MoS2 is too thin, it could not form a two-dimensional ordered structure to completely cover the FTO electrodes, and not play the role of improving the hole-collecting property. Due to its narrow band-gap, too thick MoS2 can absorb more incident-light, which can result in a smaller JSC. With the optimization of the MoS2 thickness, ca. 30 nm MoS2 with a 60 min UVO treatment induces the best PCE of the OSC (shown in Table 5).

The appropriate time of the UVO treatment is important to improve the hole-collecting property of the HTL. Too short an UVO treatment time cannot obtain a complete and effective hole-collecting layer, and too long time not can improve the PCE of the OSC (shown in the inset of Fig. 11), but leads oxygen atoms into the HLT, affecting the HTL property of hole-collecting, which leads to a cost increase and a waste of resources. So, the optimal UVO treatment time is 60 min.
The Fermi level of the MoO3 film prepared by RF according to the parameters in the literature48 is near its conduction band (shown in Fig. 10b), and exhibits n-type conductivity. The n-type film with deep energy levels could achieve hole selectivity by its gap states below the Fermi level, not its valence band.25
It has been reported that the VOC is governed by the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the acceptor.4,71 This cannot be used to explain the enhancement of VOC in our case. The low charge extraction barriers at the anode–PAL interfaces are believed to be a result of a favorable energy level alignment between the anode and the organic semiconducting molecules, which infers that the HTL's deep electronic energy levels and high WF value allow a facile charge transfer from the HOMO of an organic molecule to the anode.25,29 Also, it is expected the large HTL's WF can induce a spontaneous charge transfer from an organic semiconductor to the HTL, in accordance with charge transfer theory.72,73 This can make a corresponding OSC obtain a high VOC and a slightly lower VOC is obtained, due to a mismatched WF between the MoS2 and the PAL.47 In our case, the WFs of the as-deposited MoS2 films are 5.02–5.19 eV, which is larger than that of the corresponding MoS2 films with UVO treatment. However, a corresponding OSC (PCE = 1.08%) shows a much poorer performance than that used in the MoS2 films with UVO treatment as the HTL (shown in the inset of Fig. 11). Therefore, the WF of the HTL is not the main factor on the VOC of OSCs.
It is predicted that the VOC depends on charge-carrier recombination rates, by Blakesley et al.74 If an OSC has no leakage, it will have a larger shunt resistance (Rp) and then it can be concluded that VOC depends on the Rp. The conclusion can also be obtained from the equivalent circuit model of an OSC.75 In order to decrease the charge-carrier recombination rates, a suitable HTL that facilitates extraction of the hole is required, which can make Rp (defined by Rp = [ΔV/ΔJ]V=0, calculated from the J–V characteristics) approach infinity,76 besides the series resistance (Rs) (defined by Rs = [ΔV/ΔJ]J=0, calculated from the J–V characteristics) approaching zero. At RT, the Rp of the corresponding OSC is 524.9 Ω cm2. With the temperature increasing to 573 K, Rp increases to 558.2 Ω cm2, which keeps the same increasing trend as for VOC. When the temperature increases to 673 K, the Rp increases to 603.4 Ω cm2, but VOC decreases to 0.620 eV, which could be related to the sharing voltage of the Rs.

R
s is a composite of PAL resistances, interfacial layer resistances, electrode resistances, and the various contact and interconnect resistances, which have a pronounced effect on the solar cell's FF.77 In our case, Rs is mainly influenced by the resistance of the HTL. At RT, the HTL has the biggest R□ of 10.16 × 105 Ω per □. With the deposition temperature increasing to 673 K, the R□ decreases firstly and then increases, and the HTL prepared at 573 K has the smallest R□ of 2.88 × 105 Ω per □. These changes of R□ keep the same change trends as that of the corresponding OSCs' Rs that shows a first decreased and then increased trend with the deposition temperature increasing. However, FF shows a first increased and then decreased trend, and the OSC with the HTL prepared at 573 K has the biggest FF of 67.1%. Therefore, the resistance of the HTL has a pronounced effect on the Rs of the OSC, which further affects the FF of the OSC.
Moreover, JSC also shows the opposite change trend as that of the OSCs' Rs. So, it can be concluded that Rs has an effect on the JSC, and the increase in Rs will make JSC decrease.
The OSC with a double-layer MoO3–MoS2 film at 573 K has the best performance. The oxidized MoO3 in the outermost MoS2 film by UVO treatment can hinder oxygen atoms diffusing, to protect the deeper MoS2 film from being oxidized. In order to understand the function of the MoS2 in the OSCs' HTL, we fabricated a pure 10 nm MoO3 film as the HTL of an OSC, which has a 0.613 V VOC, 9.68 mA cm−2JSC, 55.2% FF, 19.5 Ω cm2Rs, 400.0 Ω cm2Rp, and 3.28% PCE (listed in Table 4). This can eliminate the effect of the MoS2 in the HTLs. In order to ensure the reliability of the comparison, the MoO3 film was also treated by UVO before it was used as the HTL. Then, a PCE of 3.60% was recorded for the OSC with the MoO3 as the HTL, with JSC = 9.78 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.623 V, FF = 59.1%, Rs = 10.2 Ω cm2, and Rp = 409.8 Ω cm2 (listed in Table 4), which is better than that of the OSC using the pure MoO3 film as the HTL and poorer than that of the OSC using a double-layer MoO3–MoS2 film deposited at 573 K as the HTL.
MoO3 shows n-type conductivity (its Fermi level is near the conduction band, shown in Fig. 10b) originating from intrinsic oxygen vacancies, that are too low to be accurately determined by XPS/UPS. Then, the sub-gap states at the valance band edges participate in hole transfer.20,25,53 Although UVO treatment makes the gap-states in the valence band region vanish, they cannot be completely removed, due to the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration of the vacancies, and still play the role of the extraction of the hole. However, the conduction band of MoO3 can effectively assist in the recombination of photo-generated charges in the absence of the electron limiting barrier, and the bigger EA of MoO3 makes it lose the function of blocking electrons from the LUMO of the organic semiconducting molecules, which is unfavorable to improve the JSC of the OSC. For MoS2, the presence of the molybdenum oxidation stated Mo5+ and Mo6+ in the film make it have a bigger band gap and smaller EA, showing p-type conductive behavior. If used as an interfacial layer at the anode–HTL interface, it can effectively block the electron from the exciton dissociation, to improve the properties of the OSC (shown in Fig. 10b), and then the corresponding OSC has a bigger JSC, Rp and FF. In addition, MoS2 is known to have a high mobility; although it can weaken the transmittance of the HTL, it can decrease the resistance to enhance hole-transfer. Therefore, the application of a double-layer MoO3–MoS2 film to the HTL of an OSC is more favorable to improve the JSC of the OSC than that of the OSC with a single-layer film MoO3 as the HTL, which can be confirmed by the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (shown in Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  IPCE spectra of the devices using a MoO3–MoS2 (ca. 30 nm) film prepared at 573 K and a MoO3 (ca. 10 nm) film prepared at 423 K according to the literature48 and with UVO treatment as HTLs, in this study. 
However, excessive oxygen vacancies could increase to the scattering during the process of hole-transfer through the MoO3 HTL, which can lead to the increase of Rs, and decrease the FF and PCE of the OSC. By UVO treatment, oxygen vacancies can be eliminated at utmost, to decrease the charge extraction barriers at the anode–PAL interfaces. Therefore, the UVO treatment on MoO3 is a useful method to embellish the interface, to improve its hole-collecting property.
Conclusions
In summary, the double-layer MoO3–MoS2 films prepared by RF sputtering and UVO treatment and the OSCs with MoO3–MoS2 HTLs have been studied. In the MoS2 film, the interlayer interval may be a passageway for oxygen atoms to diffuse and then make the deeper MoS2 oxidized, because the interlayer van der Waals force plays a minor role in stacking the hexagonal structure. A higher deposition temperature can decrease the dangling bonds and result in a better crystallinity of the MoS2 film, which strengthens the effect of the van der Waals forces, which could reduce the chance to react with oxygen. With the deposition temperature increasing to near the boiling point of the sulfur atom, the change of the interatomic vibrational mode may weaken the interlayer van der Waals force, and then pave a channel for oxygen diffusion, that easily causes the oxidation of deeper MoS2. Therefore, the deposition temperature can modify the contents of the various valence states of molybdenum, leading to the changes of the energy level, and optical and electrical properties of MoS2 films. MoS2 can be oxidized to the double-layer MoO3/–MoS2 film by UVO treatment. It has been found that a HTL (ca. 30 nm) sputtered at 573 K and then with UVO treatment is the optimized condition toward high cell performance, and a PCE of up to 4.15% has been achieved. Due to the presence of the molybdenum oxidation states Mo5+ and Mo6+, the MoS2 film shows a p-type conductive behavior, and a smaller EA can effectively block the electron from the exciton dissociation. Thus, the JSC of an OSC with a MoO3–MoS2 film as the HTL is larger than that of the OSC with a MoO3 film as the HTL, which shows that the double layer MoO3–MoS2 film is more favorable for hole-transfer. Therefore, this simple and efficient in situ grown double-layer MoO3–MoS2 film from a MoS2 film is a useful interface modification method for the OSC application.
