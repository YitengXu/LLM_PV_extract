1. Introduction
Investigations centered around the use of alkyne bonds to create π-conjugated semiconductors for organic (opto)electronics have been carried out in the past two decades. Recent years, however, have seen a renewed interest in such architectures, either polymers or small molecules, most likely spurred by the advances in the field of graphyne structures.1–4
When introduced in a semiconductor core, the sp-hybrid carbon–carbon triple bond may impart peculiar properties to the resulting material.5–7 For example, alkyne bonds do not present the Z/E isomerism issue, which may end in multiple isomers that may be difficult to separate. Moreover, alkyne bonds can be employed in the synthesis of shape-persistent architectures, due to their rigid and linear geometry characteristics. Also note that the rigidity provided to the (macro)molecular core by introducing the triple bond reduces the amplitude of thermal motions which are supposed to lower the mobility in organic semiconductors.8
The incorporation of alkyne linkages offers a viable approach to minimize steric repulsion between adjacent aromatic units, inducing planarity, enhancing π-conjugation along the backbone and, ultimately, charge carrier mobility.9,10 Next, it has been demonstrated that, when used appropriately, the introduction of an alkyne linkage is an important tool to fine-tune the energetics of organic semiconductors. For example, the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels may be lowered by the presence of electron-withdrawing triple bond spacers.11,12 Theoretical calculations by Schmidt et al.13 support that side groups containing triple bonds may lead to an enhanced ability to accommodate the negative charge, and, therefore, to promising electron-accepting systems.
In addition, the oxidation potential might be increased by the presence of electron-withdrawing triple bond spacers, which stabilizes the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).14 Notably, substituting acenes with triple bonds containing functional groups enables their protection from oxidative degradation.15
In this Perspective we give an overview of the most prominent triple-bond containing semiconductors, and their performance in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. A schematic picture of typical BHJ device structures and their related working principles is depicted in Fig. 1. Detailed discussions on materials, device functioning and processing can be found in several dedicated review articles.16–19
 Fig. 1  Schematics of BHJ solar cells typically studied with the alkynyl-based semiconductors. The conventional device (A) typically consists of a transparent anode (e.g. indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass), an active layer, and a top metal cathode. In many cases, a thin layer of hole (HTL) and/or electron (ETL) transporting materials is deposited between the active layer and the anode (and/or the cathode), to assist hole and/or electron extraction, respectively. In the inverted configuration (B), the bottom transparent electrode serves as the cathode while the top electrode serves as the anode. In a BHJ device the light photons with appropriate energy are absorbed by the donor semiconductor in the active layer to generate excitons. The excitons subsequently dissociate into free charges at the donor–acceptor interface. Next, holes and electrons flow in the donor and acceptor domains, respectively, and are ultimately collected at the device electrodes. The figures-of-merit of BHJ solar cells include the power conversion efficiency (PCE), the open circuit voltage (VOC), the short circuit current (JSC), and the fill factor (FF), which are, respectively, the ratio between the output device electrical energy and the incident solar energy (Pin), the cell voltage when the current flow is zero, the current flowing through the device when there is no reverse bias, and the ratio between the maximum power output and the theoretical counterpart (i.e. VOC × JSC). PCE is calculated by the following equation: PCE = FF × VOC × JSC/Pin. 
We focus on small molecule arylene–ethynylenes (also referred to as aryl acetylenes) and poly(aryl acetylene)s, i.e. systems featuring carbon–carbon triple bonds in the main backbone. These architectures have drawn much attention during the past few decades as interesting and instructive semiconductors for the fabrication of diverse electronic devices, including BHJ solar cells. We also give insight into the challenges and opportunities for their design and synthetic strategies.
Interesting studies have been reported on the implementation of metallopolyynes, specifically Pt-based polyynes, in BHJ devices.20–23 A survey of these systems is beyond the scope of this Perspective. However, it is noteworthy to point out here that the ever-growing risks of decreased platinum availability hamper the use of polyplatinynes for large-scale photovoltaics.24
Finally, very recently, a polymer semiconductor based on the 1,3-diyne building block has been successfully implemented for the first time in BHJ solar cells and in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) by Facchetti, Marks and co-workers.25 The diacetylene linker, indeed, holds the promise of a rich post-functionalization chemistry, enabling the realization of platforms for two-dimensional (2D) materials. Moreover, diynes have been identified as an important functionality in e.g. chemosensors, due to their peculiar reactivity.26–28 Therefore, further efforts towards this direction are worth pursuing.
2. Synthetic strategies
Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction is a widely applicable tool for the construction of aryl acetylenic systems from terminal alkynes and aryl halides. It is typically promoted by the palladium catalyst and copper co-catalyst, and it is highly efficient in terms of technical viability and tolerance to numerous functional groups.5,29–31
Alkyne metathesis is another useful approach to the synthesis of aryl acetylenes.5,32,33 It refers to a bond exchange reaction that can redistribute alkylidyne units between a pair of acetylene derivatives through reversible cleavage and reformation of carbon–carbon triple bonds. The reversible nature of alkyne metathesis enables self-correction behaviour and can provide thermodynamically stable architectures in high yield at equilibrium.
Finally, Hay–Glaser coupling is one of the earliest oxidative homocoupling reactions, and it is typically used for the construction of diynes.5,34
To date, the main challenge in the synthesis of triple-bond containing semiconductors is to enable optimal device performance, through e.g. precise control over the molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) in the case of polymers.
No emphasis is given yet to the synthetic methodologies employed, in terms of impact on humans, animals and the environment associated with them. In this regard, the application of the principles of green chemistry for the development of cleaner synthetic approaches is essential, specifically pertaining to alternative solvents, heterogeneous catalysis, and benign reaction conditions.35
Sonogashira reactions are typically carried out in aromatic hydrocarbons or polar aprotic solvents (e.g. dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone), which enable the solubilization of a wide range of substrates.
Conventional alkyne metathesis reaction solvents are toluene or chlorinated solvents. Similarly, Hay–Glaser coupling is generally carried out in solvents such as dipolar aprotics (dimethyl formamide, acetonitrile), toluene, tetrahydrofuran, and pyridine.
According to relevant legislation on chemical substances, however, all these solvents pose serious risks to human health and safety and the environment.36–38 In addition, solvents are a major input in a synthetic process, and account for ∼90% of the waste associated to the process itself.39,40
In very recent years the use of greener solvents for the synthesis of triple bond containing semiconductors via Sonogashira coupling has been explored by Vaccaro et al.41 The authors employed a biomass-derived solvent medium (i.e. 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2-Me-THF) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME)) to perform cleaner Sonogashira reactions. This was combined with the use of recoverable heterogeneous palladium catalysts, which facilitated the purification of the semiconductor and prevented its contamination by the palladium metal.
Shortly thereafter, the same authors prioritized renewable resources and proposed g-valerolactone (GVL) to replace dimethyl formamide or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in a model Sonogashira coupling.42 Other solvents with green credentials have been used in model Sonogashira reactions, including dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),43 alcohols and aqueous media,44 ionic liquids,45 and the bio-based options dimethyl-isosorbide46 and Cyrene.47
Though only a few, and mostly focusing on model reactions, these attempts demonstrate the potential of these solvents to replace their traditional counterparts in the synthesis of triple bond containing semiconductors. On the other hand, there are no examples of alkyne metathesis protocols employing “green” solvents.
Greener protocols for Hay–Glaser couplings include the use of solvents such as polyethyleneglycol (PEG), supercritical CO2, ionic liquids, water, or solvent-free conditions, though not targeting semiconductor synthesis.48 Further efforts should therefore be made in such a direction.
In addition, the use of heterogeneous catalysis in the synthesis of triple bond containing semiconductors should be further pursued. Sonogashira still relies essentially on palladium as a catalyst. However, in 2013, the European Union identified palladium as one of the 20 metals having a risk of market deficit, which led to high costs.49 Note also that palladium is toxic. Therefore, it is important to improve metal recycling, and avoid its loss into waste streams.
Heterogeneous systems may fulfil this requirement since they can be easily separated from the reaction mixture and reused. The easy separation also helps achieving simplified workup and/or purification steps and, therefore, reducing energy consumption and production time. Finally, anchoring palladium onto a solid material may also limit the metal contamination of the target semiconductor, which is known to negatively influence the performance of the corresponding device.50–52
Moving away from toxic metal catalysts by developing more environmentally benign options, through e.g. the design of new ligands, is also worth pursuing. In addition, efforts should be made to develop synthetic protocols that can tolerate aerobic conditions, and avoid, therefore, costly deoxygenation steps. Room temperature synthesis should also be preferred, to achieve energy efficient processes.
3. Materials
In this section we provide an overview of some representative semiconducting materials, polymers and small-molecules, incorporating carbon–carbon triple bonds as π-conjugated spacers/units into their structure. The impact of this structural modification on the resulting material properties and device performance is discussed. The systematic analysis of results, potentialities and challenges of existing ethynylene based semiconductors is of crucial importance for future developments and/or new perspectives for this class of materials. Additional and detailed information on synthetic protocols and/or specific properties/features of the reported materials can be found in the original papers.
3.1 Polymers
Among the wide variety of ethynylene-based donor polymers, we focus the attention on several families of materials as a function of not only the different building blocks but also the triple bond distribution and position within the polymer backbone. To this end, representative examples of polymers containing triple bonds as spacers in (i) “regular” structures, between/within repeating monomers/units, (ii) “hybrid” conjugated aromatic structures, having a distribution of double and triple bonds as spacers within the backbone, and (iii) side chains are reported and discussed. Representative data on the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of all the reported polymers are summarized in Table 1.

Regarding the use of the carbon–carbon triple bond as a spacer in regular polymers, we report here a series of representative works where ethynylene units have been placed between different electron-rich and/or electron-poor building blocks in order to systematically investigate their effect on the resulting material properties.
A representative work was published by Cremer et al., in which they demonstrated an effective way to modify the energy levels of a polythiophene by incorporating electron-withdrawing ethynylene units into the backbone of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).14 The electrochemical data of the resulting polymer, poly(ethynylene-bithienylene) (P1, Scheme 1), confirmed that the triple bonds in P1 determined a lowering of the HOMO energy of 0.3 eV in comparison to P3HT. Analogously to P3HT, even if less marked, the optical absorption spectrum of P1 was significantly red-shifted passing from solution to thin film (Δλmax ∼ 50 nm with the absorption onset in film at ∼600 nm), thus highlighting its good aggregation tendency in the solid state. The resulting optical bandgap of P1, estimated from the absorption onset in film, was slightly higher (2.06 eV) compared to that of P3HT (1.90 eV).
 Scheme 1  Chemical structure of donor polymers P1–P43. 
The photovoltaic performance of P1 was tested in BHJ solar cells using [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron-acceptor counterpart. Optimized P1:PC61BM (1:4 wt/wt) based devices gave an open-circuit voltage (VOC), a short-circuit current density (JSC), a fill factor (FF) and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.01 V, 3.1 mA cm−2, 36% and 1.13%, respectively. As expected from the lower HOMO energy level, the VOC of P1 based cells was greatly improved compared to P3HT (1.01 V vs. 0.62 V) even though the overall efficiency was lower (1.13% and 5.0% for P1 and P3HT based cells, respectively). The UV-Vis characterization of the P1:PC61BM blend revealed a blue-shifted absorption compared to the pristine P1 film, thus suggesting a poor self-organization and aggregation of the polymer when combined with PC61BM. This likely hindered the charge transport properties within the active blend which, combined with a partially limited light harvesting, might explain the lower JSC and FF values of the resulting P1 based devices.
Qin et al. carried out a comparative study on two donor polymers P2 and P3 (Scheme 1), both consisting of 5,7-dithien-2,3-di(4-dodecyloxy-phenyl)thieno[3-4-b]pyrazine (DTTP) and 2,5-bis-(n-dodecyloxy) benzene (PE) units directly linked (P3) or connected by introducing an ethynylene spacer (P2), to evaluate the effect of the ethynylene unit on the resulting material properties.53 The optical absorption spectrum of P2 was blue-shifted, in both solution and film, compared to P3, confirming the electron-withdrawing effect of the acetylenic spacer that mainly influenced the bandgap and the energy level of the HOMO. The HOMO energies of P2 and P3 were estimated to be −5.00 and −4.64 eV, respectively, while the optical bandgaps (estimated from the onset of the absorption in film) were found to be 1.55 eV for P2 and 1.36 eV for P3. Passing from solution to thin films, the absorption spectra of P2 and P3 were red-shifted by ∼50 nm, indicating a similar and marked aggregation tendency likely due to the co-planarity of the structures.
P2 and P3 were also used as the donor material, in combination with PC61BM, for the fabrication of standard BHJ solar cells. P3:PC61BM based devices led to a VOC of 0.43 V, a JSC of 1.81 mA cm−2, a FF of 39% and a PCE of 0.30%, while those based on P2:PC61BM yielded a VOC of 0.61, a JSC of 3.40 mA cm−2, a FF of 40% and a PCE of 0.83%. A further optimization of P2:PC61BM based solar cells led to PCEs up to 1.20%.
The enhanced performance of P2, despite its larger bandgap, was mainly ascribed to the higher charge mobility in comparison to P3, as confirmed by the measured hole mobilities: 4.26 × 10−5 and 7.33 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P2 and P3 based blends, respectively. Interestingly, this work demonstrated the potential of ethynylene units as an effective tool to simultaneously improve not only the VOC but all photovoltaic parameters of the resulting device. This was ascribed to the better self-organization and interaction of the BHJ components thus favoring internal key processes such as charge generation, transport, and collection within the active layer.
Wang et al.54 reported another example regarding the effect of electron-withdrawing triple bonds in a semiconducting polymer. By directly linking 4,8-dioctyloxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 2-ethylhexyl-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) moieties or by spacing them with a triple bond, polymers P4 and P5 (Scheme 1), respectively, were synthesized and compared. As expected, optical and electrochemical analyses confirmed that the introduction of ethynylene spacers into the polymer backbone resulted in a larger bandgap and a deeper HOMO energy level. In particular, the optical absorption spectrum of P5, in both solution and film, was blue-shifted by ∼40 nm compared to P4, suggesting that the internal charge transfer between DPP and BDT units was not as efficient as when directly linked together (P4). Both polymers, passing from solution to solid state, showed similar red-shifted (∼15 nm) absorption profiles, suggesting a partial ordering of the polymer chains. The optical bandgaps of P4 and P5, calculated from the onsets of the film spectra, were 1.31 and 1.55 eV, respectively. Electrochemical data confirmed the effect of the ethynylene spacer, which lowered the HOMO energy level of P5 (−5.68 eV) compared to P4 (−5.43 eV).
The photovoltaic performance of P4 and P5 was tested in standard BHJ solar cells (structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al). Compared to optimized P4 based devices, which showed a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 8.4 mA cm−2, a FF of 44% and a PCE of 2.53%,55 P5:PC71BM based solar cells led to a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 5.7 mA cm−2, a FF of 39% and a PCE of 1.98%. As already observed, despite the enhanced device VOC arising from the introduction of ethynylene groups into the donor backbone (0.88 and 0.68 V for P5 and P4, respectively) the relatively low JSC and FF limited the overall performance of P5 based solar cells. Morphological investigations on the P5:PC71BM active layer revealed a strong donor:acceptor phase segregation with formation of large domains (∼100 nm) that might limit charge separation processes (increasing recombinations), thus limiting the resulting JSC and FF values.
Braunecker et al. reported a detailed study on the design, synthesis, and characterization of a series of polymers containing alkyne linkages for a number of different building blocks.56 The aim of the work was to systematically investigate the effect of steric interactions between different adjacent units in alternating polymers on the resulting material properties, necessary to design improved materials for photovoltaic applications. To this end, three sets of polymers have been reported and discussed.
The first set of polymers P6–P9 (Scheme 1), based on benzodithiophene (BDT) and thienoisoindoledione (TID) or diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) cores, was studied to investigate the impact of ethynylene spacers. Interestingly, computational modeling demonstrated that the introduction of carbon–carbon triple bonds, in both BDT-TID (P6, P7) and BDT-DPP (P8, P9) based polymers, minimized steric repulsions/constraints between adjacent units thus promoting more planar structures, as confirmed by the significant reduction of corresponding dihedral angles (from 34° to 4° for P6 and P7, from 19 to 6° for P8 and P9, respectively). However, despite the more planar structure predicted for ethynylene based polymers, the optical absorption spectra of P7 and P9 were blue-shifted compared to the analogous reference systems P6 and P8 (Table 1). Note that independently of the enhanced π-conjugation and π–π stacking due to planarization of twisted structures, the presence of electron-withdrawing ethynylene groups seems to mitigate the “push–pull” effect between building blocks thus dominating the influence on the resulting optical properties.
A second set of fluorene (FLR) based ethynylene-containing polymers with TID, isothianaphthene (ITN), pyromellitic diimide (PMDI) and DPP units (P10–P13, Scheme 1) were synthesized and studied. The optical absorption maxima (λmax) in film of FLR based polymers followed the trend P13 (643 nm, containing DDP) > P10 (546 nm, containing TID) > P11 (532 nm, containing ITN) > P12 (483 nm, containing PMDI). Note that the spectra of P10 and P13 (containing TID and DPP units, respectively) were blue-shifted relative to their BDT analogues. This is likely due to the weaker electron-donating ability of fluorene compared to BDT. P12 was found to be the polymer with the largest bandgap (2.30 eV) in this study, resulting from the combination of strong electron-withdrawing (PMDI) and weak electron-donating (FLR) units.
The last set of polymers were aimed at incorporating ethynylene spacers between electron-withdrawing comonomers, opening a synthetic pathway to design rather electron-withdrawing alternating polymers with narrow bandgaps and relatively deep HOMO values. To this end, polymers P14–P19 (Scheme 1) based on the DPP core combined with various building blocks having different electron-withdrawing strength (thienopyrrolodione (TPD), PMDI, TID, ITN, DPP, and thienopyrazine (TP)) were synthesized to provide materials of potential interest for photovoltaic applications. The absorption spectra of DPP-based polymers P14–P19 were generally broader compared to that of their FLR-based analogues, thus allowing to potentially harvest a larger portion of the incident photons (Table 1). The polymers with the lowest bandgap within the entire series (P6–P19) were P16 (1.37 eV), P17 (1.31 eV) and P19 (1.31 eV) (containing TID, ITN and TP units, respectively), all employing electron-withdrawing moieties that contain fused aromatic rings. It is known that in such systems the quinoid structure of the thiophene ring is stabilized both by the push–pull effect of the building blocks and by a gain in aromatic resonance energy in the fused benzene ring.57
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of polymers P6–P19 are reported in Table 1. In general, the introduction of an electron-withdrawing ethynylene unit into a polymer backbone lowered the HOMO level with respect to the fully heterocyclic analogue, in perfect agreement with the literature and works discussed in this perspective. This allowed to have a series of polymers with relatively deep HOMO energies between −5.3 and −6.0 eV, that would translate not only to large desirable VOC values in BHJ solar cells but also to stable materials against oxidation. Concerning LUMO energy levels, it is worth noting the fluctuation of the values, ranging from −3.6 eV to −4.2 eV, might be even interesting for a combination with emerging non-fullerene acceptors with tunable properties and LUMO levels deeper than those of conventional fullerene derivatives (e.g. PCBM).58–60
Popere et al. reported a series of ethynylene based semiconducting polymers by combining a variety of comonomers with different electron affinities compared to that of the central core.61 To this end, four polymers (P21–24, Scheme 1) incorporating 2,6-diethynyl BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-4-borata-3a-azonia-4a-aza-s-indacene) as a core and quinoxaline (Qx, P21), 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BzT, P22), N,N′-di(2′-ethyl)hexyl-3,4,7,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NDI, P23), and N,N′-di(2′-ethyl)hexyl-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI, P24) as acceptor units were synthesized and studied. 2,6-Diethynyl BODIPY-based homopolymer P20 was used as a reference system to better evaluate the effect of the different acceptor units.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of polymer solutions exhibited a λmax of 656, 596, 604, 634 and 656 nm for P20, P21, P22, P23 and P24, respectively. Except P24, the absorption spectra of all annealed films are significantly broadened in the red portion of the spectrum compared to solution (onsets shifted by ∼50–90 nm), likely due to a planarization of the polymer backbone with enhanced interchain interactions. PDI based polymer P24 showed the largest absorption spectrum, spanning over most of the visible spectrum, that did not change passing from solution to thin film. This suggests the lack of further planarization and aggregation of the polymer backbone. The optical bandgaps in film, estimated from the corresponding absorption onsets, were found to be 1.66, 1.65, 1.67, 1.63 and 1.57 for P20, P21, P22, P23 and P24, respectively. The HOMO (and LUMO) energy levels, estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), were −5.33 (−3.47), −5.33 (−3.58), and −5.44 (−3.58) eV for P20, P21 and P22, respectively. Note that the introduction of Qx and BzT units in P21 and P22, respectively, did not significantly perturb the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energies compared to those of P20. The introduction of NDI and PDI units in P23 and P24, respectively, led to a more marked effect not only on the corresponding bandgaps but also on the HOMO (and LUMO) energies that were found to be −5.55 (−3.76) and −5.73 (−4.09) eV, respectively. Interestingly, the electrochemical and optical properties of BODIPY based polymers depend on the electron affinity of the corresponding acceptor units. While acceptors with comparable electron affinity (BTZ and Qx) to BODIPY did not significantly perturb the energy levels of the corresponding polymers, stronger acceptors (NDI and PDI) seemed to emphasize the electron donor characteristics of the BODIPY core. This is also in perfect agreement with the preliminary charge transport measurements highlighting that BODIPY-based polymers P20–24 can be active as both p- and n-type semiconductors and the switch between the two regimes can be controlled by selecting suitable comonomers. NDI and PDI based polymers (P23 and P24, respectively) showed indeed n-type semiconductor behavior while P20–22 were found to be p-type materials. On these bases, it is reasonable to assume that the ethynylene-bridged copolymers P23 and P24 should also function as donors in BHJ solar cells, while P20–P22 could show acceptor characteristics in all-polymer BHJ solar cells.
Sajoto et al.62 reported another study on NDI based polymers aimed at not only reducing the twisting between the units by ethynelene functionalization, but also tuning the resulting material properties for optoelectronic applications. Polymers P25–28 (Scheme 1) were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling of the NDI unit and four para-diethynylbenzene derivatives: (1) 1,4-diethynyl-2,5-dihexadecyloxybenzene (P25), (2) 1,4-diethynyl-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyloxy) benzene (P26), (3) 1,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,5-diethynylbenzene (P27), and (4) 1,4-diethynyl-2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene (P28).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on oligomeric model compounds to gain further insight into the electronic properties of P25–28. It was found that by increasing the electron-withdrawing character of the phenyl substituent, from alkoxy (P25) to trifluoromethyl groups (P28), both HOMO and LUMO decreased. However, consistent with the greater localization of HOMO and LUMO coefficients on diethynylbenzene and NDI units, respectively, the HOMO energies were found to be strongly substituent-dependent than LUMO energies. As a result, the HOMO (LUMO) energies were found to be −5.34 (−3.49), −5.34 (−3.49), −5.67 (−3.59) and −6.20 (−3.90) eV for P25, P26, P27 and P28, respectively. The UV-Vis analysis demonstrated that the low-energy absorption maxima (λmax), in both solution and film, are hypsochromically shifted passing from P25 to P28 (Table 1). This gradual blue-shifting was correlated to the increased electron-deficient character of the diethynylbenzene bridging groups, which influenced HOMO/LUMO levels thus determining an increase of the corresponding bandgaps. Except for P26 that showed a bathochromic shift, the other polymers exhibited almost unchanged spectra passing from solution to thin film.
When implemented in organic field effect transistors (OFETs), P25–28 films exhibited similar and modest electron mobilities on the order of 10−3–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, these values may be also interesting for use, in combination with suitable donor materials, in organic photovoltaics in which the tunable absorption may play an additional useful role.
Differently from the previous works, Pattanasattayavong et al. reported an interesting study focused on the comparison of different types of spacers introduced into a polymer backbone.63 To this end, they prepared and compared polymers consisting of a DPP based core functionalized with three different spacers: (i) an ethynylene unit (P29), (ii) a thiophene (P30) or (iii) a phenyl ring (P31) (Scheme 1). The aim of the work was to understand the relative strength (weak, intermediate, strong) of the three different π-bridges and how this affects the optoelectronic properties of the resulting structures. As expected, the ethynylene unit partially attenuated the donor character of the thiophenes that flank the DPP; therefore the HOMO energy level of P29 was located between the HOMO levels of P30 and P31 (−5.21, −5.17 and −5.35 eV for P29, P30 and P31, respectively). The LUMO levels were located at −3.63, −3.61 and −3.53 for P29, P30 and P31, respectively. The resulting optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption onsets in film, were proportional to the deepening of the HOMO levels with values of 1.36, 1.30 and 1.53 eV for P29, P30 and P31, respectively.
UV-vis analysis in solution showed that the λmax of P29 (∼700 nm) was blue shifted compared to P31 (748 nm) and P30 (826 nm), thus exhibiting a progressive enhancement of the absorption profiles passing from ethynylene to phenyl and thiophene spacers, respectively. Interestingly, all polymers showed a significant and similar broadening of the absorption bands (despite a modest red-shift of λmax values, Table 1) passing from solution to thin-film, thus suggesting an enhanced ordering and π–π stacking of polymer chains. This is in agreement with the charge transport study based on transistors that showed similar charge transport properties for all polymers. In particular, OFETs based on P29 annealed films showed ambipolar behavior, similar to P30 and P31, with charge mobilities of 0.03 and 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and electrons, respectively. This work confirmed again that ethynylene spacers could be used as a tool to fine-tune the polymer properties, especially for the design of new and tailored materials for OFETs and photovoltaic devices.
Qing et al. reported another comparative study between three thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) based polymers containing different π-spacers.64 Donor–acceptor polymers P32, P33 and P34 (Scheme 1), containing TPD as the acceptor and carbon–carbon single bond-, vinyl- and ethynylene-linked dithiophene as donor units, respectively, were prepared and characterized. The HOMO energy levels of polymers P32, P33 and P34, calculated by CV, were estimated to be −5.08 eV, −4.97 eV and −5.12 eV, while LUMO energies were −3.58 eV, −3.65 eV and −3.70 eV, respectively. As expected, P34 exhibited the lowest HOMO (and LUMO) energy level likely due to the presence of the electron-withdrawing ethynylene spacer. The resulting bandgaps, estimated from CV data, were 1.50, 1.32 and 1.42 eV for P32, P33 and P34, respectively.
The λmax values in solution of P32–34 were found to be 464 nm, 498 nm and 450 nm, confirming the typical blue-shift of ethynylene based polymers. Passing from solution to thin film, a red-shift of the corresponding λmax was observed: 470, 516, and 455 nm for P32, P33 and P34, respectively. In addition, the absorption spectra of P32 and P33 exhibited a broadening of the band with an evident shoulder at ∼700 nm likely ascribed to the formation of well-ordered structures/domains.
However, a stronger variation was observed for P33, confirming the contribution of the vinyl unit in extending the π-conjugated length, improving the molecular rigidity and thus enhancing the coplanarity.69 Note that P34 did not show significant variation of the absorption profile, likely due to its low solubility in common organic solvents that influenced the formation of ordered and structured domains in film.
The charge transport properties of P32–34 were tested in solution-processed transistors. P32 and P33 showed hole mobilities up to 2.2 × 10−3 and 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The best performance of P33 confirmed the benefit arising from the vinyl groups, able to enhance π-conjugation and structural coplanarity thus enhancing the resulting charge transport properties in film. Interestingly, due to the lower LUMO level induced by the ethynylene group, P34 based OFETs exhibited a clear ambipolar behavior with mobilities of 1.2 × 10−6 and 0.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and electrons, respectively. Despite these modest mobilities, likely due to the poor solubility and thus thin film quality, it is worth nothing here the key role of the spacer in the optoelectronic and semiconducting properties of the resulting materials.
As anticipated above, another class of ethynylene based polymers that we would mention is represented by “hybrid” conjugated aromatic compounds, in which both carbon–carbon double and triple bonds are used as π-conjugated spacers in the same polymer backbone.
Poly(arylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(arylene-vinylene)s (PAE–PAVs) represent an interesting class of semiconducting materials combining the intrinsic properties of both PAEs and PAVs into a single polymer structure able to provide additional properties.70,71 Compared to PAEs, PAE–PAVs exhibit red-shifted absorption and emission spectra and enhanced solid state photoluminescence quantum yields, due to reduced interchain interactions arising from the presence of less rigid and linear PAV segments. Moreover, the enhanced electron affinity compared to PAVs is reflected by higher absorption coefficients, lower-lying HOMO energy levels, lower turn-on voltages of the resulting light emitting-diodes and higher VOC (>0.9 V) in BHJ solar cells.72
An interesting work on the use of PAE–PAVs as donor materials in BHJ solar cells was reported by Kästner et al.65 They demonstrated an effective approach to improve the photovoltaic performances by using a ternary blend of two amorphous and semi-crystalline anthracene-containing poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) (PPE–PPV) copolymers (P35 and P36, Scheme 1) with PC61BM. The two polymers, due to the same backbone, are essentially identical except for the modification on their side-chain substitution, leading to either a semi-crystalline (P35) or an amorphous (P36) nature. The UV-vis absorption spectra of P35–36 films were almost additive according to the different composition ratios between semi-crystalline and amorphous phases in the binary blends, thus indicating an energetically undisturbed mixing. The higher order of semi-crystalline P35 is reflected by the relative proportion of the two lowest absorption peaks located at 580 and 550 nm, while the disordered P36 is characterized by a single broad and blue-shifted absorption band at ∼520 nm. Analogously, the absorption of the ternary P35:P36:PC61BM blend mainly varied between the spectra of the binary blends, again indicating an almost undisturbed mixing.
The photovoltaic properties of P35 and P36 as donor materials blended with PC61BM, as the acceptor counterpart, were tested in ternary BHJ solar cells (glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ blend/Al; the donor(s):PC61BM blend ratio was 2:3 by weight). In general, a strong dependence of the photovoltaic performances on the ratio of ordered and amorphous polymers in the ternary blends was found. The best result was achieved by adding only 10% (wt) of the amorphous polymer P36 in the ternary blend, resulting in devices with VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of 0.80 V, 7.23 mA cm−2, 70% and 4.03%, respectively. Blending with a higher concentration of semi-crystalline P35 with respect to amorphous P36 (90:10 wt/wt) led to finely balanced and optimal BHJ morphologies containing both ordered hole and electron conducting phases as well as intimately mixed regions. In particular, it was demonstrated that at this concentration the mixed amorphous blend (P36 and PC61BM) was mainly distributed between the pristine semi-crystalline segregated phases of ordered P35 and PC61BM, thus leading to optimized charge carrier generation, transport and collection processes responsible for the improved photovoltaic performances of such ternary blends.
An alternative and valid approach to exploit the potential of newly designed PAE–PAV polymers was demonstrated by Susarova et al.66 In this work, polymers P37 and P38 (Scheme 1) were synthesized and systematically tested as donor materials in BHJ solar cells in combination with seventeen different fullerene derivatives as the acceptor counterpart. It was found that the photovoltaic performance of P37–38 strongly depended on the solubility and molecular structure of fullerene derivatives used in the active blend. Conventional PC61BM gave moderate efficiencies when combined with P37 and P38 (1.6% and 2.5%, respectively), while the best photovoltaic results (2.2% and 3.4% for P37 and P38, respectively) were obtained with alternative fullerene derivatives with better-suiting molecular structures and solubility in organic solvents. These examples clearly demonstrate that conventional PC61BM and PC71BM are not universal and optimal acceptors for every novel conjugated polymer. Therefore, the development and study of innovative acceptor materials (fullerene and/or non-fullerene derivatives) with different molecular structures and physical and electronic properties might represent a promising way to reach maximal photovoltaic performances not only for new materials but also for the existing library of donor polymers.
The final part of this section provides some additional examples of the promising use of carbon–carbon triple bonds out of the polymer backbone and in particular as π-conjugated spacer/linkage in (alkyl) side chains.
Wang et al. reported the synthesis of two polymers based on the combination of an electron donor unit 3,3′-dialkynyl-2,2′-bithiophene (BTRy) with difluorobenzothiadiazole and difluorobenzoxadiazole, respectively (P39 and P40, respectively, Scheme 1).67 The sp-hybridized carbon center on the alkynyl substituent of the BTRy unit should reduce intramolecular steric hindrance by eliminating two hydrogen atoms present in a common alkyl chain. As a result, alkynyl-functionalized polymers provided good solubility, an extended π-conjugation and a high degree of backbone planarity, thus promoting the generation of crystalline structures with close π-stacking distances and strong intermolecular interactions.73
The absorption spectra of P39 and P40, passing from solution to film state, showed minimal shifts of λmax as well as absorption onset, suggesting a strong aggregation tendency even in solution. X-ray analysis of polymer films confirmed a high degree of ordering with strong diffraction from lamellar packing and π-stacking, likely favored by the abovementioned backbone planarity. The optical bandgaps estimated from the absorption onsets of P39 and P40 films were found to be 1.66 and 1.62 eV, respectively, reflecting the stronger electron-withdrawing character of the difluorobenzoxadiazole unit compared to difluorobenzothiadiazole. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers, estimated by CV, were found to be −5.54/−3.88 and −5.71/−4.09 eV for P39 and P40, respectively. Compared to the HOMO energies of similar high-performance difluorobenzothiadiazole–oligothiophene copolymers,74 the HOMO of P39 is lowered, as expected from the electron-withdrawing character of the alkynyl substituents.
In agreement with the previous results, the low-lying frontier molecular orbitals of P39 and P40 led to an ambipolar behavior in OFETs, giving electron and hole mobilities up to 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. When combined with PC71BM and used as the active layer in standard BHJ solar cells, P39 delivered a VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of 0.91 V, 14.1 mA cm−2, 59.8% and 7.7%, respectively, while P40 exhibited a VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of 1.04 V, 6.6 mA cm−2, 49% and 3.3%, respectively. Note that the remarkable VOC values might be attributed to the low-lying polymer HOMO levels (−5.5 to −5.7 eV) enabled by the electron-withdrawing alkynyl substituents. These values are substantially larger (>0.13 V) than those of the well-studied similar difluorobenzothiadiazole–oligothiophene copolymers based on the π-spacer approach as an alternative strategy to planarize the backbone.74
A similar approach was reported by Chiou et al., who designed and prepared thiophene–vinylene–thiophene (TVT) derivatives where an ethynylene spacer was inserted between the thiophene ring and the aliphatic portion of the side chain (2-octyldodecyl).68 Polymers P41 and 42 (Scheme 1) were synthesized through copolymerization of the alkynyl-substituted TVT monomer with 5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole (DTFBT) and 5,10-di(thiophen-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis-([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (DTNT) acceptors, respectively. P43 (Scheme 1), the analogue of P41 without the ethynylene spacer on the side chain, was also prepared for comparison. The introduction of a linear, compact, and conjugated carbon–carbon triple bond moved away (∼2.35 Å) the tertiary carbon of the alkyl side chain from the polymer backbone to reduce the steric hindrance, thus promoting both main-chain coplanarity and interchain interactions. Compared to P43, P41 and P42 exhibited improved thermal stability, red-shifted absorption spectra, lower-lying electron affinity and much higher solid-state crystallinity. In detail, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed decomposition temperatures of 372, 432 and 318 °C for P41, P42 and P43, respectively.
Thin film absorption spectra exhibited absorption maxima λmax (and onsets: λonset) at 715 (777), 720 (832) and 710 (762) nm for P41, P42 and P43, respectively. The optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption onset in film, were found to be 1.60 eV for P41, 1.49 eV for P42 and 1.63 eV for P43. Note that the corresponding absorption spectra in solution were substantially similar to those in film, thus suggesting a strong aggregation tendency even in solution. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers, estimated by CV, were found to be −5.61/−3.85, −5.71/−4.09 and −5.62/−3.68 eV for P41, P42 and P43, respectively. This result highlighted that the introduction of the alkynyl group had a more marked effect on the LUMO energies than on the HOMO energies.
The linear and coplanar polymeric backbone of P41 and P42 promoted a strong edge-on stacking with a high degree of crystallinity within thermally annealed films, thus leading to remarkable p-type OFET mobilities of 0.78 and 1.27 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The best performing P43 based OFETs showed mobilities up to 9.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.
In order to exploit the optimal light harvesting and charge transport properties of these polymers, inverted BHJ solar cells were also fabricated and characterized. As a result, (1:2 wt/wt) P42:PC71BM based devices showed the best PCE of 7.75% with a VOC of 0.66 V, a JSC of 16.09 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73%. In comparison, the P41:PC71BM based cell, using identical fabrication conditions, showed a PCE of 5.61% with a VOC of 0.62 V, a JSC of 15.24 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.4%. Finally, optimized (1:2 wt/wt) P43:PC71BM based solar cells delivered a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 1.03 mA cm−2, a FF of 35% and a PCE of 0.27%.
3.2 Small molecules
Besides the use and continuous development of ethynylene based polymers for optoelectronic applications, it has also been widely accepted that analogous low-dimensional π-conjugated molecular systems represent a valid and complementary solution. Semiconducting small molecules offer a series of advantages over polymeric materials in terms of ease of synthesis, reproducibility and purification, combined with a greater tendency to self-assemble into ordered domains, responsible for enhanced charge carrier properties.10 Analogously to Section 3.1, we provide here an overview of some representative families and the results of molecular systems containing carbon–carbon triple bonds. Data on optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of all the reported small molecules are summarized in Table 2.

3.2.1 Electron donors. 
An interesting class of materials is represented by anthracene-based arylacetylenes. Anthracene is a promising building block that owing to its rigidity and electron-rich structure might promote the planarization of the corresponding molecules with consequent π–π stacking and high charge mobility. Its further functionalization (e.g. at position 9 and/or 10) with other conjugated building blocks might also allow one to fine-tune the chemical-physical, optical, electronic and morphological properties of the resulting materials as a function of their final application.
Valentini et al. reported the synthesis and characterization of M1 (Scheme 2) in which the anthracene core was symmetrically functionalized (at 9,10 positions) with 3,4-hexyloxy-ethynylbenzene units.75 The resulting material (M1) showed good solubility in common organic solvents and suitable optoelectronic properties for photovoltaic applications. The absorption spectrum of the M1 film exhibited four peaks centered at 333, 441, 464, and 498 nm, which were mainly retained after mixing with PC61BM. The optical bandgap of the M1 film, estimated from the absorption onset, was found to be ∼2.3 eV, while the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were at −5.51 and −2.98 eV, respectively.76 The M1:PC61BM based blend was used as the active layer in standard BHJ solar cells, exhibiting PCEs up to 1.12%. Subsequent optimizations gave PCEs up to ∼1.3% (VOC = 0.89 V, JSC = 3.10 mA cm−2, FF = 45%).76,77 Notably, this PCE ranks among the highest reported for BHJ cells based on small molecules at that time.
 Scheme 2  Chemical structure of small-molecules (electron donor) M1–45. 
Extending the molecular design of M1, a series of asymmetrically substituted arylacetylenes M2–5 (Scheme 2) were also prepared by using new sustainable synthetic procedures to reduce the environmental factor (E-factor).41 Calculation of the E-factors confirmed the effectiveness of the process in terms of waste reduction.78 The resulting values range from ∼101 to ∼102 and were significantly smaller than those of conventional synthetic methods, having an average of ∼5 × 103.79 Molecules M2–5 consist of an anthracene core asymmetrically functionalized (at 9,10-positions) with two ethynylene-phenylene units peripherally substituted with electron-releasing (alkoxy alkyl chains) and electron-withdrawing groups (–NO2, –CN in the para or meta position), thus leading to donor–acceptor (D–A) structures. The HOMO/LUMO energies, estimated from optical absorption and CV data (in solution), were found to be −5.62/−3.13, −5.56/−3.11, −5.64/−3.28, and −5.47/−3.23 for M2, M3, M4 and M5, respectively. Note that M4 exhibited the lowest HOMO/LUMO energies, likely reflecting the stronger electron-withdrawing character of the para-nitro-ethynylbenzene.
Except for M2, which showed an opposite trend, the absorption spectra of M3–5 are significantly red-shifted (∼40 nm) passing from solution to solid state, confirming a good aggregation tendency of the molecules able to generate ordered domains in film. Moreover, compared to the M1 film, M3–5 films showed broader absorption spectra with low-energy λmax at 504, 529 and 528 nm, respectively.
M2–5 molecules were also tested as active materials in solution-processed OFETs and BHJ solar cells to evaluate the effect of the different substituents on the resulting device properties. Typical p-type characteristics were observed for M2, M4 and M5, whereas M2 was not FET active. Hole mobilities up to 4.5 × 10−5, 5.5 × 10−5 and 3.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for M2, M4 and M5, respectively. A similar trend was observed for standard BHJ solar cells that delivered, by blending the molecules with PC61BM as the acceptor counterpart, PCEs of 0.4%, 0.1% and 1.25% for M2, M4 and M5, respectively. In particular, M5:PC61BM blends showed the best JSC and FF values (4.45 mA cm−2 and 48%, respectively) that perfectly correlate with the obtained OFET mobilities. However, the relatively low VOC of 0.60 V (0.90 and 0.86 V for M2 and M4, respectively), despite the lower HOMO energy level, likely indicates a suboptimal BHJ morphology that might still limit the resulting photovoltaic performance.80
Another study on anthracene based arylacetylenes, correlating the impact of the donor molecular shape on the resulting photovoltaic characteristics, was reported by Seri et al.81 The authors reported a series of arylacetylenes M6–8 (Scheme 2) enabling exploration of molecular architecture–electronic structure relationships in BHJ solar cells. M6–8 were designed to have good solubility and similar numbers of π-electrons, and also to provide different molecular shapes based on the same hydrocarbon core building blocks. A progressive increase in π-system branching was obtained passing from linear (M6), mono-branched (M7) to di-branched (M8) structures.
Proceeding from M6 to M8, thus increasing the molecular branching, the optical absorption spectra in solution and film were significantly blue-shifted, demonstrating how the molecular structure and shape modify the resulting electronic properties. The film spectra of M6–8 are red-shifted and broadened compared to solutions, showing a different red-shift magnitude: ∼50 nm (∼2× greater) for linear M6 and ∼25 nm for branched systems M7 and M8 (Table 2).
The optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption onsets in films, were found to be 2.08, 2.26 and 2.36 eV for M6, M7 and M8, respectively. Note that the larger optical bandgaps of M7 and M8 compared to M6, despite the slightly smaller number of π-electrons of the latter, might be ascribed to the reduced π-delocalization in the former molecules, owing to the core arm meta-connections. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels, estimated by CV in solution, were located at −5.32/−2.98 eV for M6, −5.19/−2.72 eV for M7 and −5.57/−3.03 eV for M8.
Standard BHJ solar cells, based on donor/acceptor blends of M6–8 and PC61BM or PC71BM, were fabricated and characterized. As a result, optimized devices based on (i) M6:PC71BM (2:1 wt/wt) led to a PCE of 2.70% with a VOC of 0.91 V, a JSC of 7.25 mA cm−2 and a FF of 41%, (ii) M7:PC61BM (1:2 wt/wt) led to a PCE of 0.49% with a VOC of 0.61 V, a JSC of 2.66 mA cm−2 and a FF of 30%, and (iii) M8:PC61BM (2:1 wt/wt) led to a PCE of 0.12% with a VOC of 0.39 V, a JSC of 1.00 mA cm−2 and a FF of 31%. These results clearly demonstrate a significant influence of the molecular shape on photovoltaic performance. In particular, passing from M6 to M8, thus increasing skeletal branching, the PCEs of the corresponding devices are drastically reduced. This suggests that linear anthracene–acetylene–phenylene–acetylene structures can be promising (repeat) units for photovoltaic architectures, either small molecules or polymers.
Grisorio et al. published a study on a set of molecules based on anthracene and 2-ethylhexyl functionalized dithienopyrrole (DTP) units spaced by ethynylene moieties.82 Two symmetrical molecules, M9 and M10 (Scheme 2), were synthesized: the former comprises a DTP core flanked by two anthracenyl ethynyl side groups, while the latter is based on an anthracene core functionalized with two DTP-ethynyl groups. The properties of these materials were compared with those of the corresponding alternating polymer, poly-AD (Scheme 2).
The optical characterization of the materials was carried out in both solution and film. In solution, the low-energy λmax of M9, M10 and poly-AD was located at 478, 538 and 547 nm, respectively. Passing from solution to film, the corresponding spectra were broadened and red-shifted showing low-energy λmax at 498, 566 and 575 nm for M9, M10 and poly-AD, respectively. The corresponding optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption onsets, were 2.16 eV for M9, 2.01 eV for M10 and 1.78 eV for poly-AD. The HOMO/LUMO energies, estimated by CV in solution, were found to be −5.04/−2.83 eV, −4.99/−3.10 eV and −4.98/−3.13 eV for M9, M10 and poly-AD, respectively.
BHJ solar cells were fabricated and characterized to evaluate and compare the potential of M9, M10 and poly-AD as donor materials. The donors were deposited in blend with PC61BM using an optimal donor:acceptor ratio (40:60 wt/wt for all materials). Despite the broader absorption of poly-AD compared to M9 and M10, the corresponding device unexpectedly showed the lowest PCE (0.03%), likely due to a poor BHJ morphology of the active films. On the other hand, M9:PC61BM based cells delivered a PCE of 0.34% with a VOC of 0.36 V, a JSC of 3.07 mA cm−2 and a FF of 31%; and M10:PC61BM based cells led to a PCE of 0.95% with a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 3.37 mA cm−2 and a FF of 36%.
Our group reported the synthesis and characterization of BTZ-containing arylacetylenes M11–13 (Scheme 2).76 The BTZ unit offers a series of advantages such as high electron affinity, relatively easy ring functionalization and well-organization in the sold state owing to strong intermolecular interactions such as heteroatom/heteroatom contact and π–π interactions.83
For these reasons, we prepared M11 as an analogue of compound M1 (vide supra) in which a BTZ unit replaced the anthracene core. In M12, the benzothiadiazole core was substituted with a D–A–D motif based on a BTZ unit symmetrically functionalized with two thienyl groups. Finally, in M13 we replaced the D–A–D motif with an A–D–A core based on a central dithienyl-thiophene ring linked to two BTZ side groups.
As expected, the optical absorption maxima (λmax) of the BTZ-based donors, in both solution and film, systematically fall in the order M12 > M13 > M11. As expected, the introduction of a D–A–D (or A–D–A) motif in the molecular structure clearly resulted in broadened and red-shifted absorption bands. The resulting bandgaps, estimated from the absorption onset in films, were estimated to be 2.3, 2.0 and 2.2 eV for M11, M12 and M13, respectively (in comparison, the bandgap of M1 was ∼2.3 eV).
The HOMO/LUMO energies of M11, M12 and M13, calculated from optical absorption and CV in solution, were found to be −5.52/−3.09 eV, −5.33/−3.21 eV and −5.49/−3.35 eV, respectively. Note that the LUMO energies for BTZ-based donors are generally lower with respect to analogous anthracene derivatives,76 likely reflecting the strong electron-accepting character of the BTZ unit.
Field-effect transistor measurements demonstrated that M11–13 are FET-active, exhibiting p-type mobility. In particular, charge mobilities of 4 × 10−5, 1 × 10−2 and 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained for M11, M12 and M13. These values well correlate with the photovoltaic properties of the corresponding BHJ solar cells. Within the BTZ series, M12:PC61BM based cells afforded the greatest photovoltaic performance, with a PCE of 0.6%, a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 2.90 mA cm−2 and a FF of 21%. M11 and M13 based cells gave very poor PCEs (∼0.1%), which was ascribed to an unfavourable morphology/microstructure of the resulting active layers.
Gao et al. prepared and studied the properties of two asymmetrical push–pull small molecules, M14 and M15 (Scheme 2), consisting of triphenylamine (TPA) and DPP units combined with ethynylbenzene as π-linkage.84 Besides the intrinsic properties and advantages of TPA and DPP as electron donating and accepting units in the same molecular structure, the introduction of the ethynylbenzene-linkage further contributed to enhance not only the molecular planarity but also the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process owing to the coplanar and rigid nature of the carbon–carbon triple bond. In order to further extend the optical absorption region of M14, the electron withdrawing strength of the DPP unit was further increased by introducing a para-cyanophenyl (CP) substituent (M15). As expected, both M14 and M15 exhibited a strong absorption in the long-wavelength region due to the ICT transition. The UV-vis spectrum in solution of M14 exhibited a λmax of 582 nm, which was further red-shifted to 619 nm passing to solid-state. A more marked effect was observed for M15 that showed a λmax in solution and film of 614 and 671 nm, respectively, probably reflecting an improved ICT transition and stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid-state. The optical bandgaps of M14 and M15, calculated from their absorption onsets in film, were 1.80 and 1.65 eV, respectively.
HOMO and LUMO energy levels, estimated by CV, were found to be −5.28/−3.38 eV and −5.25/−3.48 eV for M14 and M15, respectively. Note that the LUMO energy of M15 decreased, in agreement with the increased electron-withdrawing strength of the acceptor segment (DPP-CP).
Interesting results were obtained by testing M14 and M15 as donor materials in standard BHJ solar cells. M14:PC61BM based devices led to PCEs of up to 2.06% with a JSC of 7.1 mA cm−2, a FF of 30% and an impressive VOC of 0.97 V. Analogous devices based on M15:PC61BM gave a remarkable PCE of ∼6% with a JSC of 14.9 mA cm−2, a FF of 43% and a VOC of 0.93 V. The good performance of M15 based devices might be ascribed to both the relatively narrow bandgap (1.65 eV) of the material and its enhanced charge transport properties as confirmed by hole mobility measurements (hole-only devices gave mobilities of 7.5 × 10−5 and 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for M14 and M15 based blends, respectively).
Another remarkable result was reported by Gao et al., who designed and synthesized a symmetrical molecule, M16 (Scheme 2), based on a porphyrin ring linked to two DPP units by ethynylene spacers.85 In addition, the porphyrin core was further functionalized with two 2-ethylhexyl-thienyl side groups in order to enhance both π-conjugation and material's solubility.86 The resulting molecule M16 exhibited a broad spectral coverage in the visible and near-infrared regions in both solution and film. In detail, the spectrum in solution showed three strong absorption peaks at 466, 568, and 727 nm, while the analogous film exhibited peaks at 472, 573, and 802 nm. The marked red-shift of the low energy peak, passing from solution to film (from 727 to 802 nm, respectively), indicated a strong intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state. The resulting optical bandgap, estimated from the corresponding absorption onset in film, was found to be 1.37 eV. CV measurements were also carried out to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of M16, which were found to be −5.14 and −3.76 eV, respectively.
Solution-processed BHJ solar cells, using M16 as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor, were fabricated to test the potential of the DPP–porphyrin small molecule. Optimization steps during the fabrication process of the cells, including the use of additives and thermal post-treatments, led to a remarkable PCE of 8.08%, with a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 16.76 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.8%.
The high PCE of the M16 based blend might be ascribed to its optimal light harvesting and self-organization in the solid state, thus promoting fundamental processes such as charge generation, transport and collection within the BHJ active blend. The hole mobilities of blended and pristine M16 films, determined by the space charge limited current method,94 were calculated to be 4.8 × 10−4 and 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, comparable to those of other high-performance systems.
Similar porphyrin based structures were reported by Takahashi et al., who prepared and characterized five different p-type small molecules, M17–21, containing DPP and tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) units spaced by ethynylene moieties (Scheme 2).87 These molecules had linear alkyl chains, with a different length, on the peripheral DPP units. In particular, n-ethyl, n-butyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl and n-decyl side chains were used for M17, M18, M19, M20 and M21, respectively. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the side chains on the photovoltaic properties of the corresponding BHJ films prepared via the thermal precursor approach.87 In particular, due to the insolubility of M17–21 in common organic solvents, BHJ blends containing soluble precursors were solution-processed into thin films and then converted to the target materials by in situ thermal reactions.
The optical absorption spectra of pristine M17–21 films showed similar and broad profiles, with two main bands at ∼600 and 800 nm. The absorption onsets of the films were slightly different, suggesting a modest impact of the alkyl chains on the solid state self-organization. The corresponding optical bandgaps were estimated to be 1.47, 1.44, 1.45, 1.45 and 1.43 eV for M17, M18, M19, M20 and M21, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of M17–21, determined by photoelectron spectrometry, were −5.0/−3.5, −5.0/−3.6, −5.0/−3.6, −5.0/−3.5 and −5.1/−3.7 eV, respectively.
The photovoltaic properties of M17–21 were investigated in standard BHJ solar cells, using PC61BM as the acceptor counterpart, in which the active blends were opportunely prepared and optimized using the previously mentioned thermal precursor approach. Note that M17 based blends (with n-ethyl side chains) were found to be too rough to be tested in BHJ devices.
The systematic study showed that the length of alkyl chains on the DPP unit strongly influenced the efficiency of the resulting devices, providing PCEs ranging from 0.19% to 5.2% as the alkyl chains became shorter from n-decyl (M21) to n-butyl (M18) (Table 2). The larger contribution to this variation was due to JSC values that increased from 0.88 to 15.2 mA cm−2.
The best result was obtained for M18 based cells that gave a PCE of 5.2%, with a VOC of 0.67 V, a JSC of 15.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52%. The photovoltaic responses, combined with additional morphological and electrical characterization, suggested that the introduction of shorter alkyl chains positively affects the miscibility, molecular orientation, charge generation and transport properties in BHJ films. Interestingly, this trend is not fully consistent with that observed for conventional solution-processed small molecule based BHJ solar cells.
In view of the exciting progress, further research and development of rigid building blocks connected (and functionalized) by acetylenic units may afford greater understanding of structure–performance relationships. To this end, Boudreault et al.88 reported the synthesis and properties of three semiconducting materials, M22–24 (Scheme 2), based on the electron-rich building block 2,2′-ethyne-1,2-diylbis[3-(alk-1-yn-1-yl)thiophene] (EBT), in which the impact of different alkyl chains (n-hexyl, n-tetradecyl, and 2-ethylhexyl) on the properties of the resulting materials was investigated. The EBT core was then flanked with DPP units at both ends to lower the bandgap and enable good organization in the solid state of these materials. The UV-vis absorption spectra in solution were almost identical for all three molecules, with λmax values of 599, 601, and 597 nm for M22, M23 and M24, respectively. The corresponding spectra in film exhibited red-shifted peaks with λmax values of 626, 626, and 623 nm for M22, M23 and M24, respectively, indicating favorable π–π interactions and stacking between molecules in the solid state. In addition, a vibronic shoulder at 685 nm appeared for all compounds, even though the intensity was related to the different alkyl chains. Passing from linear (M22 and M23) to branched (M24) side chains, the intensity of the shoulder decreased likely reflecting a greater disorder and less dense π–π stacking between molecules. Despite the different intensities of this shoulder, all spectra showed a broad and similar absorption in the visible range with optical bandgaps, estimated from the corresponding onsets, of 1.66, 1.68 and 1.70 eV for M22, M23 and M24, respectively. CV measurements were also carried out on thin films of these materials, giving HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.46/−3.64 eV for M22, −5.52/−3.78 eV for M23 and −5.44/−3.66 eV for M24.
Despite similar optical and electrochemical properties, more marked differences were observed in the response of the corresponding devices. Firstly, OFETs were fabricated and optimized with films of M22–24 spin-coated on Si/SiO2 substrates (with and without surface treatments), giving maximum hole mobilities of 0.17, 0.08 and 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 for M22, M23 and M24 films, respectively. This result corroborates the assumption that linear EBT side chains should afford a better film organization, with improved OFET performance, than the analogous tetradecyl substituted EBT in which the bulky side chains likely influence crystalline domains. A similar trend was also observed in the photovoltaic response of BHJ solar cells based on M22–24:PC61BM active blends. As a result, the shorter n-hexyl chains on M22 provided the best performance, with optimized M22:PC61BM (1:1 wt/wt) based devices yielding a VOC of 0.72 V, a JSC of 6.7 mA cm−2, a FF of 36%, and PCE up to 1.8%. Optimized devices prepared with compound M23, bearing n-tetradecyl substituents on the EBT core, exhibited a PCE, VOC, JSC and FF of 1.7%, 0.75 V, 5.64 mA cm−2 and 40%, respectively. The lowest performances were obtained for M24:PC61BM based solar cells that gave a maximum PCE of 0.43% with a VOC of 0.63 V, a JSC of 2.37 mA cm−2 and a FF of 29%. This correlates well with the lowest hole mobility and solid state ordering of the M24 based film, which likely hinder fundamental processes within the BHJ blend responsible for the low JSC, FF, and PCE of the corresponding devices.
Wu et al. reported the synthesis and characterization of two DPP-based molecules functionalized with phenanthrene and ethynyl phenanthrene, M25 and M26 (Scheme 2), respectively.89 Phenanthrene has a large π-delocalization and a planar geometry that might favor both light harvesting and solid state interactions, making its derivatives suitable for photovoltaic applications. The introduction of carbon–carbon triple bonds as π-spacers is expected to further extend the π-conjugation, stiffen the molecular structure and planarize the system through reduction of steric hindrance between DPP and phenanthrene units. By looking at the UV-vis absorption spectra of M25 and M26 solutions, the effect of the introduction of the ethynylene unit was evident, which exhibited λmax at 597 nm for M25 and 620 nm for M26. The corresponding spectra in films were red-shifted and broadened in comparison to solution, showing a λmax of 603 nm for M25 and 642 nm for M26. Interestingly, the corresponding optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption edges in film, were found to be 1.77 and 1.60 eV for M25 and M26, respectively. These results clearly confirm the enhanced ordering and intermolecular interactions of M26 films. Besides the energy bandgap, CV analysis was carried out to estimate the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, which were found to be −4.98/−3.68 eV for M25 and −5.17/−3.51 eV for M26.
BHJ solar cells with standard configuration were fabricated by using M25 and M26 as donor materials in combination with PC71BM. As a result, the PCE of M26:PC71BM based devices was significantly higher than that of devices based on M25:PC71BM. In detail, the efficiency of optimized M26:PC71BM devices was 1.71%, while that of M25:PC71BM cells was 0.69%. The correlation of these results with the observed optical properties of pristine molecules as well as with the measured hole mobilities of M25 and M26 based blends (6.8 × 10−6 and 2.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively) confirms stronger solid state interactions and enhanced charge transport properties for M26, likely owing to the above mentioned intramolecular steric and electronic effects of ethynylene spacers.
To further explore the effect of ethynylene incorporation into small molecules, Mun et al.90 reported the synthesis and characterization of D–A–D type systems using DPP as the central acceptor core linked, with or without ethynylene spacers, to pyrene donor moieties. Note that the resulting molecules differ not only with respect to the presence or absence of the ethynylene spacer but also with respect to the alkyl substituents at the DPP core. The molecular structure of the resulting materials M27–29 is depicted in Scheme 2.
The optical absorption spectra of M27–29 solutions showed red shifted peaks for ethynylene-containing molecules (M28 and M29, bearing 2-hexyldecyl and 2-octyldodecyl chains on the DPP core, respectively) compared to the reference system M27 (bearing 2-octyldodecyl chains on the DPP core) without π-conjugated spacers between DPP and pyrene units. In detail, λmax of the solution spectra was located at 590, 630 and 632 nm for M27, M28 and M29, respectively.
The film spectra of M22–29 were broadened in comparison to solutions. In particular, M28 and M29 showed a λmax at 620 nm with an additional shoulder at 685 nm, indicating favorable π–π interactions and stacking between molecules likely promoted by acetylenic spacers. The M27 film exhibited an absorption band with a maximum at 590 nm with a slightly marked shoulder at 630 nm. The optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption edges in film, were found to be 1.78 and 1.69 eV for M27 and M28–29, respectively. CV was used to determine the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the molecules, which were found to be −5.51/−3.73 eV for M27, −5.72/−4.03 eV for M28 and −5.72/−4.03 eV for M29, confirming the lowering of the energy levels after the introduction of acetylenic spacers into the molecular backbone.
The potential of M27–29 as donor materials for photovoltaic applications was tested in standard BHJ solar cells. The control device based on the M27:PC71BM (1:4 wt/wt) blend showed a PCE of 0.51%, with a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 2.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 27%. The best results were obtained for ethynylene based donor materials. In detail, the M28:PC71BM (7:3 wt/wt) blend led to PCEs up to 2.25%, with a VOC of 0.87 V, a JSC of 6.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 42%, while M29:PC71BM (7:3 wt/wt) led to a PCE of 3.25%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 8.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 42%. The better results of M28–29 based blends were mainly ascribed to improved values of (i) VOC, consistent with the lowered HOMO energy levels, and (ii) JSC, attributed to the ethynylene-induced planar backbone promoting stronger intermolecular interactions and an enhanced absorption at longer wavelengths.
The final part of this section aims to put emphasis on a series of studies specifically focusing on the comparison of the effect of different π-spacers, in particular carbon–carbon double (olefinic) versus triple (acetylenic) bonds, on the optoelectronic properties of the resulting materials.
Marrocchi et al.76,77 described the synthesis and characterization of four anthracene-based molecules M1 and M30–32 (Scheme 2), and their implementation as donor materials in BHJ solar cells. Each molecule was designed to achieve both high solubility in processing solvents and a broad optical absorption. This comparative study allowed one to investigate the effects of the replacement of the acetylenic spacer for the olefinic π-spacer on the electronic structure, optical properties and device performance.
The optical absorption spectra of M30–32 and M1 films were significantly red-shifted in comparison to solutions, suggesting a greater π–π structural organization in the solid state. In particular, olefinic-based molecules (M30 and M31) showed a bathochromic shift of ∼20–30 nm, while the analogous acetylenic derivatives (M32 and M1) led to slightly larger shifts of ∼30–40 nm. The optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption edges in films, showed a similar trend with values of ∼2.4 and ∼2.2 eV for M30–31 (olefinic derivatives) and M32–M1 (acetylenic derivatives), respectively. These results suggested a more effective π-delocalization and solid state organization of ethynylene based molecules.
The frontier molecular orbital energies of M30–32 and M1 were estimated by CV in solution. As a result, the HOMO energies were found to be −5.01, −5.21, −5.44 and −5.51 eV for M30, M31, M32 and M1, respectively. The LUMO energies followed a similar trend with values of −2.50, −2.70, −3.04 and −2.98 eV for M30, M31, M32 and M1, respectively, reflecting the electron-withdrawing character of the triple bond.
Standard BHJ solar cells, using M30–32 and M1 as donors and PC61BM as the acceptor, were fabricated to evaluate the impact of the spacers on the resulting photovoltaic performance. M30 and M31 based blends led to devices with poor PCEs of 0.04% and 0.34%, respectively. On the other hand, devices fabricated with acetylenic based donors M32 and M1 showed VOC of 0.93 and 0.96 V, respectively, and JSC of 2.63 and 2.62 mA cm−2, respectively. Combined with FF values of 41% and 45%, these data yield PCEs of 1.02% and 1.17%, respectively. As expected, VOC values of olefinic compounds are lower than those of acetylenic analogues, in agreement with the trend of the HOMO energies. The slightly improved photocurrents and FFs of M32 and M1 based blends are likely ascribed to the red-shifted absorption and enhanced solid state organization of acetylenic derivatives compared to olefinic derivatives.
A new building block, i.e. ATVTA, that uses stiff carbon–carbon triple bonds (A) as a linkage on 1,2-di(2-thienyl)-ethene (TVT) was reported by Cui et al.91 Three molecules (Scheme 2) based on (1) TVT (M33), (2) 5,5′-diethynyl-2,2′-dithienyl (AT2, M34), and (3) ATVTA (M35) as the central building block were synthesized and studied to investigate their physicochemical and photovoltaic properties. In addition, using the structure of M35 (containing ATVTA) as the base and replacing the end-groups with stronger electron withdrawing substituents, M36 and M37 were also prepared.
All compounds exhibited strong absorption in the visible region that was further extended passing from solution to thin film. The well-defined absorption bands with a shoulder in the long wavelength range (590–630 nm) of M33–35 indicated the formation of ordered domains and strong π–π stacking interactions in the solid state. The M33 film exhibited a broad absorption profile with the absorption edge at 726 nm (estimated bandgap of 1.71 eV). The introduction of two ethynylene units into the structure significantly blue-shifted (55 nm) the absorption onset of M35 (671 nm, bandgap of 1.85 eV) in comparison to M33. The absorption onset of M34 was also blue-shifted (44 nm) compared to M33, resulting in a bandgap of 1.82 eV. On the other hand, M36 and M37, due to the strong electron withdrawing character of their terminal groups, exhibited red-shifted absorption spectra vs M35, with estimated optical bandgaps of 1.83 and 1.72 eV, respectively.
The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of M33–37, estimated by CV, were found to be −5.27/−3.56 eV, −5.37/−3.55 eV, −5.29/−3.57, −5.40/−3.69 eV and −5.41/−3.44 eV, respectively. As expected, among M33–35, M34 showed the lowest HOMO energy, while among M35–37, M36 and M37 exhibited further lowered HOMO energies (the lowest of the series) likely due to their stronger electron acceptor substituents. The photovoltaic properties of donors M33–37 were investigated in standard BHJ solar cells. The PCE of M33:PC61BM (1:1 wt/wt) based devices was 2.13%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 4.26 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59%. Lower JSC (2.88 mA cm−2) and FF (45%) were obtained from M34:PC61BM (1:1 wt/wt) blends, leading to a PCE of 1.13% (VOC of 0.86 V). The best result was obtained for M35:PC61BM (1:1 wt/wt) based devices that gave a PCE of 2.2% with a VOC of 0.96 V, a JSC of 4.57 mA cm−2 and a FF of 50%. Note that the apparent discrepancy between the trend of VOCs of the device and HOMO energies of the material might be ascribed to different nanoscale morphology of the BHJ layers which is known to significantly influence the resulting VOC.80 Devices based on M36:PC61BM (1:3 wt/wt) delivered a PCE of 1.02% with a VOC of 0.98 V, while devices based on M37:PC61BM (1:3 wt/wt) led to a PCE of 1.22% with a VOC of 0.99 V and a slightly enhanced JSC (4.48 mA cm−2 instead of 3.40 mA cm−2 for M36).
Another comparative work on the effect of introduction of different π-linkage into the molecular structure has been reported by Ji et al.92 They described the synthesis and characterization of a series of molecules, M38–41 (Scheme 2), based on DPP and TPA (triphenylamine) building blocks. In these structures, four different π-spacers, (1) single bond, (2) vinylene, (3) acetylene, and (4) acrylonitrile, were placed in between DPP and TPA units to form a D–π–A–π–D structure. The resulting optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties were investigated and compared to better elucidate the effect of the different spacers on the resulting material properties. The push–pull structure of these molecules led to a broad optical absorption in the solid state ranging from 300 up to 900 nm. The λmax values in solution were located at 618, 627, 621 and 622 nm for M38, M39, M40 and M41, respectively, corresponding to the ICT transition between TPA and DPP. Compared to the solution spectra, λmax values in film were red-shifted by 25, 34, 32 and 44 nm for M38, M39, M40 and M41, respectively, suggesting strong aggregation and intermolecular interactions in the solid state. The resulting optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption onsets in film, were found to be 1.72 eV for M38, 1.67 eV for M39, 1.70 eV for M40 and 1.67 eV for M41. CV measurements were also carried out to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the molecules. The resulting HOMO energies were −5.10 eV, −5.07 eV, −5.14 eV and −5.12 eV, respectively, while the LUMO energies were −3.35 eV, −3.37 eV, −3.40 eV and −3.41 eV, respectively. Note that M39 and M40 showed lower HOMO/LUMO energies, consistent with the electron withdrawing effect of acetylene and acrylonitrile linkages.
The photovoltaic properties of the donors M38–41 were investigated by fabricating conventional BHJ devices. PCEs up to 2.74%, 3.76%, 3.10% and 2.92% were obtained for M38, M39, M40 and M41, respectively. M39 based devices, followed by M40, showed the best performance likely due to the vinylene linkage, which, similarly to ethynylene, enhanced the rigidity and coplanarity of the molecular backbone, promoting intermolecular interactions. The relatively high VOC values of M40 and M41 (0.93 and 0.90 V, respectively, compared to 0.88 V for M38 and 0.84 V for M39) were proportional to their deep-lying HOMO energies. The JSC values of M39, M40 and M41 based devices were 11.90, 10.30 and 9.73 mA cm−2, respectively, reflecting the trend of their hole mobility (2.7 × 10−4, 1.2 × 10−4, and 4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). The slightly lower JSC of M38:PC61BM (8.6 mA cm−2) was probably due to steric intramolecular interactions affecting the coplanarity and self-organization of the BHJ components. The FF values were substantially similar for all blends, ranging from 32% to 38%.
As a continuation of the previous work, the research group of Li et al. reported another comparative study on a series of molecules, M42–45 (Scheme 2), consisting of 5,6-bis-(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DOBT) and TPA as electron-acceptor and electron-donor units, respectively.93 In detail, four different π-conjugated spacers, (1) benzene (M42), (2) styrene (M43), (3) ethynylbenzene (M44) and (4) 2-phenylacrylonitrile (M45), were introduced into the molecular structure to study the effect on the resulting properties of this series of molecules.
In general, molecules M42–45 showed strong absorption characteristics in the visible region between 300 and 700 nm. The λmax of M37–40 in solution was 488, 496, 487 and 484 nm, respectively. Compared to solutions, the λmax of M42–45 in films was red-shifted by 13, 15, 13 and 20 nm, respectively, suggesting even in this case a good aggregation tendency in the solid state. As a result, the optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption edges in film, were found to be 2.07, 2.01, 2.05 and 2.05 eV for M42, M43, M44 and M45, respectively.
The HOMO/LUMO energy levels, estimated by CV, were −5.24/−3.13 for M42, −5.12/−3.18 for M43, −5.32/−3.20 for M44 and −5.35/−3.20 eV for M45, reflecting the lowering of the energy levels in the presence of electron-withdrawing spacers such as ethynylbenzene (M44) and 2-phenylacrylonitrile (M45).
BHJ solar cells based on M42:PC61BM and M44:PC61BM blends delivered PCEs of 2.99% and 2.03%, respectively. On the other hand, M43:PC61BM and M45:PC61BM based devices showed enhanced PCEs of 3.40% and 4.84%, respectively, with a VOC for M45 based cells of 1.08 V. The improved PCEs of devices containing styrene and 2-phenylacrylonitrile as spacers (M43 and M45, respectively) compared to the M42 based device were mainly ascribed to the molecular planarity that likely promoted charge generation, transport and collection processes within the BHJ layer. In addition, the high VOC of M44 and M45 well correlates with their deep-lying HOMO levels induced by the presence of ethynylbenzene and 2-phenylacrylonitrile units. However, despite a VOC > 1 V (1.03 V), M44 based devices showed the lowest PCE, likely due to the relatively large dihedral angle (∼30°) that hinders the coplanarity of the system and, consequently, might further determine a poorer solid state ordering with lower intermolecular interactions.


3.2.2 Electron acceptors. 
In this section, we report some recent and representative works on the use of ethynylene based small molecules as electron acceptor materials in BHJ solar cells. The recent inception of the so-called non-fullerene electron acceptor (NFA) materials represents a promising way for the revitalization of BHJ solar cells, as demonstrated by the step change in performance in a relatively short period of time.59
Data on the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the reported electron acceptor molecules are summarized in Table 3.

Cai et al. described the synthesis and characterization of three fused-ring electron acceptors (MA1–3, Scheme 3) using single bond (MA1), vinylene (MA2) and acetylene (MA3) linked indaceno[3,2-b]dithiophene (IDT) dimers as the electron rich core and 3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-1-indanone as electron deficient terminals.95 Interestingly, this work demonstrated the significant impact of the linkage between the IDT dimers on the optoelectronic properties of the resulting materials. The UV-vis characterization exhibited a broad and intense absorbance between 550 and 850 nm. However, the λmax of MA1–3 solutions gradually red-shifted passing from single (MA1) to double bonds (MA2), while the presence of the acetylenic spacer (MA3) led to a significant blue-shifting (728, 737 and 675 nm for MA1, MA2 and MA3, respectively). The same trend was observed passing from solution to film, even though all λmax in film were red-shifted compared to solutions (759, 789 and 701 nm for MA1, MA2 and MA3, respectively). The resulting optical bandgaps of MA1–3, estimated from the absorption onsets in film, were 1.43, 1.40 and 1.55 eV, respectively. CV was also performed to evaluate the effect of the bridging units on the electrochemical properties. The resulting HOMO energy levels of MA1–3 were found to be −5.43, −5.44 and −5.59 eV, while the LUMO values were −3.88, −3.91 and −3.88 eV, respectively. All molecules exhibited similar LUMO energies, while a significant deepening of the HOMO energy was observed for MA3, consistent with the electron withdrawing character of the acetylenic unit.
 Scheme 3  Chemical structure of electron acceptor small molecules MA1–10. 
Inverted BHJ solar cells were fabricated to investigate the potential of MA1–3 as acceptor materials. To this end, the wide bandgap polymer FTAZ96 was chosen as the donor counterpart owing to its complementary absorption and energy levels matching with MA1–3 acceptors. After optimization of the BHJ blends, the best result was achieved using FATZ:MA3 (1:1.5 wt/wt) as the active layer that delivered a PCE of up to 13.1% with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 20.2 mA cm−2 and a FF of 73.6%. FATZ:MA1 (1:1.5 wt/wt) based devices delivered a PCE of 11.0% with a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 18.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.4%. FATZ:MA2 (1:1.5 wt/wt) based cells exhibited the worst performance with a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 17.5 mA cm−2, a FF of 65.1% and a PCE of 9.3%. Note that electron mobilities of pristine MA1–3 films, determined by the space charge limited current method,94 resulted to be 3.4 × 10−3, 2.2 × 10−3 and 4.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which were not only comparable to those of fullerene acceptors (∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1)97 but also in agreement with the trend of the observed photovoltaic performance, thus highlighting the potential of this class of molecules.
An interesting study on the influence of the molecular structure and internal twisting on the resulting properties of ethynylene based acceptors was reported by Wang et al.98 To this end, they designed and prepared three perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, MA4–6 (Scheme 3). PDI is one of the most investigated building blocks in the field of NFAs due to its remarkable electron mobility, high aggregation tendency, high electron affinity, high absorption coefficients, and outstanding oxidative/thermal stability.99,100 MA4–6 molecules have a benzene core to which were linked the PDI units through ethynylene spacers. In detail, MA4 was a linear molecule, bearing two flanked PDI units, MA5 was a star-shaped molecule with three peripheral PDI units, and MA6 was a star-shaped system with four PDI moieties linked to the central benzene ring (1,2,4,5-positions).
UV-vis characterization of MA4 and MA5 solutions revealed well resolved spectra between 400 and 600 nm with three main peaks at ∼470, 510 and 550 nm, ascribable to the π–π* transition of the PDI core, whereas MA6 showed a broad featureless band ranging from 350 to 650 nm with the λmax at 501 nm. The disappearance of the vibronic structures in MA6 was likely due to the significant twisting of the PDI units (instead of co-planar or nearly twisted conformations of MA4 and MA5, respectively) due to the intramolecular steric crowding. Passing from solutions to films, the spectra were broadened and red-shifted (λmax at ∼510 nm for all molecules), resulting in optical bandgaps (estimated from the corresponding onsets) of 2.01, 2.09 and 1.98 eV for MA4, MA5 and MA6, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels, estimated by CV, were found to be −5.79/−3.70 eV for MA4, −5.82/−3.86 eV for MA5 and −5.89/−3.80 eV for MA6. As expected, the increased number of acetylenic spacers (from MA4 to MA6) induced a lowering of the resulting HOMO energies.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of MA4–6 as acceptors, BHJ solar cells, using PBDB-T101 as the donor counterpart, were fabricated and characterized. The best performance was obtained for PBDB-T:MA5 (1:1 wt/wt) based devices, which led to a PCE of 6.0%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 11.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59.4%. PBDB-T:MA4 (1:1 wt/wt) based blends exhibited a PCE of 3.05%, with a VOC, JSC and FF of 0.84 V, 6.9 mA cm−2 and 52%, respectively. PBDB-T:MA6 (1:1 wt/wt) based cells showed the worst performance with a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 4.0 mA cm−2, a FF of 38.5% and a PCE of 1.04%. These results indicated that an excessive twisting of PDI units such as in MA6 led to suboptimal self-organization and charge transport properties of the BHJ components, resulting in lower device efficiencies. In particular, the increased solubility of star-shaped and highly twisted molecules, during the blend drying, likely determined the first precipitation of PDBD-T, which generated fibril network structures, thus hindering an optimal donor:acceptor phase segregation within the BHJ layer.
Another example to further investigate the potentialities of star-shaped PDI based acceptors was reported by Tang et al.102 The authors designed and synthesized an alkynyl-functionalized acceptor molecule, MA7 (Scheme 3), by linking through acetylenic spacers four PDI units to the pyrene core, in order to evaluate the effect of a star-shaped structure, featuring twisted PDI units, on the self-organization and performance of different BHJ blends.
MA7 in solution showed a strong and structured optical absorption band between 300 and 700 nm with a λmax at ∼530 nm, which is slightly broader than that of ordinary PDI derivatives, thus suggesting an effective and extended π-delocalization. As mentioned above, the vibronic structures between 400 and 580 nm were attributed to the PDI chromophore, while the shoulder at ∼600 nm was likely due to the ICT between PDI and pyrene units. Passing from solution to film, the spectrum of MA7 showed similar features (λmax at ∼530 nm) but was slightly broadened, thus suggesting a relatively weak molecular aggregation in the film state. The resulting optical bandgap, estimated from the absorption onset (676 nm), was 1.83 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of MA7, calculated by CV in solution, were −5.84 and −3.89 eV, respectively, in agreement with those of the analogous star-shaped molecules MA5 and MA6.
Inverted BHJ solar cells (with binary and ternary blends) were fabricated and characterized to test the potential of MA7 as an acceptor material. To this end, MA7 was combined both with different donor polymers (PTB7-Th,104 PBDB-T101) and with another acceptor (ITIC59) in binary and ternary blends, respectively. As a result, optimized PTB7-Th:MA7 (1:1.5 wt/wt) based devices showed PCEs up to 7.71% with a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 18.13 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54.6%. PBDB-T:MA7 (1.5:1 wt/wt) blends delivered a maximum PCE of 6.84%, with a VOC of 0.86 V, a JSC of 13.15 mA cm−2 and a FF of 60.4%. In comparison analogous devices based on optimized PTB7-Th:ITIC and PBDB-T:ITIC blends led to PCEs of 7.73 and 10.74%, respectively.
Interestingly, benefiting from the good complementary absorption and cascade-like energy level alignment of PBDB-T or PTB7-Th, MA7 and ITIC, a small amount of MA7 was added as a third component in PTB7-Th:ITIC and PBDB-T:ITIC blends. Optimized PTB7-Th:ITIC:MA7 (1:1.23:0.07 wt/wt/wt) ternary blends led to PCEs up to 8.76% (VOC = 0.79 V, JSC = 18.18 mA cm−2 and FF = 60.3%), while those based on PBDB-T:ITIC:MA7 (1:0.95:0.05 wt/wt/wt) showed a maximum PCE of 10.93% (VOC = 0.88 V, JSC = 18.50 mA cm−2 and FF = 66.6%), outperforming the analogous binary ITIC based blends. These results suggest that ethynylene based acceptors are promising materials for the development of efficient binary and/or ternary BHJ devices.
An additional example of the potential of acetylenic based molecules as the third element (or second acceptor material) in ternary BHJ solar cells was reported by Qin et al.103 To this end, three ethynylene-bridged perylene monoimide (PMI) dimers, MA8–10 (Scheme 3), were designed and synthesized. The aim of the work was to study the effect of the linker(s) (directly linked, with one or two acetylenic units for MA8, MA9 and MA10, respectively) not only on the resulting material properties but also on the molecular packing and self-organization induced within the corresponding ternary blends.
By comparing the UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine MA8–10 films, between 300 and 700 nm, it was found that MA9 (λmax: 540 nm) exhibited a broader and red-shifted profile compared to that of MA8 (λmax: 535 nm), likely due to the extended electron delocalization and decreased steric hindrance between PMI units. In addition, M9 showed a broader absorption even in comparison to MA10 (λmax: 530 nm), which was ascribed to a stronger intermolecular π–π stacking as suggested by an evident shoulder at ∼610 nm and 590 nm for MA9 and MA10 films, respectively. The resulting optical bandgaps, estimated from the absorption onsets, were 1.91, 1.86 and 1.93 eV for MA8, MA9 and MA10, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels, determined by CV, were found to be −5.93/−3.83 eV for MA8, −5.80/−3.98 eV for MA9, and −5.88/−3.96 eV for MA10.
The photovoltaic properties of these materials were investigated in inverted BHJ solar cells. A systematic analysis on devices containing PBDB-T, ITIC and MA8–10 (with PBDB-T as the donor material and ITIC and MA8–10 as acceptor materials) was carried out. A control PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1 wt/wt) based device was fabricated, giving a maximum PCE of 8.37% with a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 15.06 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.6%. After a proper optimization, in terms of material concentration and device processing, the PBDB-T:ITIC:MA8 (1:0.85:0.15 wt/wt/wt) ternary blend delivered a PCE of 9.77% with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 18.06 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.1%. Similarly, PBDB-T:ITIC:MA10 (1:0.85:0.15 wt/wt/wt) based devices led to PCEs up to 9.34%, with a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 16.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.9%. Clearly, the major contribution for the improved performance of these cells arose from the improved JSC that reflected the enhanced light harvesting of the ternary blends due to the complementary absorption of MA8 and MA10 components. Surprisingly, despite the slightly improved optical properties of MA9, the corresponding ternary blend (PBDB-T:ITIC:MA9; 1:0.85:0.15 wt/wt/wt) yielded the worst photovoltaic performance, with a PCE of 2.62, a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 7.41 mA cm−1 and a FF of 40.9%. Detailed investigations demonstrated that the incorporation of MA9 as a “third component” detrimentally affected the BHJ morphology and phase segregation of the ternary blend, determining the formation of ball-shaped clusters with a diameter of approximately 20–50 nm, likely responsible for the lower JSC and FF values. This work confirmed the potential of ethynylene based acceptors, and in particular of PMI dimers, as a new class of promising NFAs for binary and ternary solar cells.

4. Summary and outlook
Remarkable advances have been made in the area of alkyne-based organic semiconductors in terms of diversity of structures and device performance. However, compared with other semiconductors, these systems continue to show large differences in terms of structural variability, as well as in device performance.
From a synthetic point of view, efficient approaches, tolerable for different functional groups, have been developed for their synthesis, hence enabling the easy variation of their effective conjugation, and the fine-tuning of physical and electronic properties. However, the synthesis of π-conjugated alkynes essentially relies on the use of harmful solvents as reaction medium (e.g. toluene or dipolar aprotics) and homogeneous catalysts (which are typically not recoverable/reusable), and an excess of reactants is often used.
Developing synthetic methods that can be scalable at reasonable low cost and that comply with the principles of green chemistry and chemical engineering to meet legislative and environmental guidelines is required to enable industrial production.105,106 Significant efforts must therefore be directed towards the mass, energy, space, and time efficient synthesis of triple-bond containing systems by using greener solvents, recyclable and/or non-toxic metal catalysts, low-temperature, and aerobic reaction conditions.
From the device point of view, incorporating the electron withdrawing ethynylene unit within the semiconductor backbone is particularly attractive since it enables high VOC. It has also been demonstrated that a low-lying LUMO may also lead to an enhanced ability to accommodate electrons, and, therefore, to promising electron-acceptors. In addition, the cylindrical electronic symmetry of the alkyne linkage makes it more accommodating than single or double bonds to steric and conformational constraints, and this has been found to preserve the conjugation between eventually adjacent aromatic nuclei (i.e. planarization of the conjugated backbone) which, ultimately, leads to enhanced charge mobility.
π-Conjugated alkynes often suffer from limited solubility in the solvents typically used to process (opto)electronic devices, which results in poor morphology and microstructure. These systems may benefit from alternative deposition techniques, such as nanoparticle ink techniques, including precipitation and miniemulsion methodologies.107,108
Most importantly, these techniques would enable the assembly of the active layers using green solvents. Note that to date halogenated or aromatic hydrocarbon solvents are the most employed option in device processing. However, these solvents are associated to serious (and often irreversible) toxicity hazards and are banned from mass-production factories. Therefore, substituting them for safer options is an essential step towards the industrial viability of the organic electronic technology.109–111
Other possible approaches to power further advances may be exploiting post-treatment deposition procedures, such as solvent vapour annealing techniques, or the use of additives.112–115 It must be further stressed here that processing solvents with green credential are worth investigating extensively, even when an optimal device response is obtained.
Finally, as is common with other semiconductor classes, π-conjugated alkyne performance has been found to be dependent also on the device configuration (binary/ternary, conventional/inverted).
Thus, the design and the sustainable synthesis/implementation of alkyne-based semiconductors is a significant topic in the field of organic solar cells and for other types of devices. Fig. 2 further summarizes current research and future developments for such systems. The ultimate aim of this Perspective is to boost discussion in this area, from both chemistry and materials science point of view.

Her education and professional career are essentially focused on organic synthesis themed research, including advanced organic materials and their application in organic electronics; sustainable conversion of biomass into high added value chemicals, fuels, and materials; heterogeneous catalytic materials for efficient carbon–carbon bond forming reactions; and safe chemicals. She has been habilitated as Full Professor in 2018.

 	Fig. 1  Schematics of BHJ solar cells typically studied with the alkynyl-based semiconductors. The conventional device (A) typically consists of a transparent anode (e.g. indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass), an active layer, and a top metal cathode. In many cases, a thin layer of hole (HTL) and/or electron (ETL) transporting materials is deposited between the active layer and the anode (and/or the cathode), to assist hole and/or electron extraction, respectively. In the inverted configuration (B), the bottom transparent electrode serves as the cathode while the top electrode serves as the anode. In a BHJ device the light photons with appropriate energy are absorbed by the donor semiconductor in the active layer to generate excitons. The excitons subsequently dissociate into free charges at the donor–acceptor interface. Next, holes and electrons flow in the donor and acceptor domains, respectively, and are ultimately collected at the device electrodes. The figures-of-merit of BHJ solar cells include the power conversion efficiency (PCE), the open circuit voltage (VOC), the short circuit current (JSC), and the fill factor (FF), which are, respectively, the ratio between the output device electrical energy and the incident solar energy (Pin), the cell voltage when the current flow is zero, the current flowing through the device when there is no reverse bias, and the ratio between the maximum power output and the theoretical counterpart (i.e. VOC × JSC). PCE is calculated by the following equation: PCE = FF × VOC × JSC/Pin.
