    , Accepted 8th April 2015First published on 8th April 2015AbstractNitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes decorated with Co and Ni metal nanoparticles were assessed as counter electrodes (CEs) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These composites show good electrocatalytic activity toward the counter electrode reduction reaction (I3− → I−) in DSSCs. The resulting devices using these composites as CEs display photovoltaic performance as good as, or even better than Pt-based devices, indicating their potential for application in DSSCs.
DSSCs are among the most promising photovoltaic devices to address the challenge of achieving clean energy due to their cost-effective fabrication and relatively high device performance.1–3 The CE of DSSCs plays two key roles in a typical DSSC device: regeneration of I− from I3− in the shuttle reaction via electrocatalytic reduction and collection of the electrons from the external circuit. Thus good CE materials should exhibit high catalytic activity toward the counter electrode reduction reaction and display good conductivity. Currently, the noble metal Pt is the most useful CE in DSSCs, while it is limited, being a very rare resource, with high cost. Therefore, it is highly desirable to explore low-cost and abundant materials to replace Pt as the CEs of DSSCs for future large-scale fabrication. To date, a number of new materials have been demonstrated to be useful as efficient CEs of DSSCs, such as metals,4 metal oxides,5–7 chalcogenides,8–11 and carbon-based materials.12–19 Carbon materials are especially attractive because of their natural abundance, low-cost fabrication and good electrocatalytic activity. CNTs with chemical modification could endow them with special properties and great application potential.20–22 We have recently demonstrated that nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) encapsulating FeNi alloy nanoparticles are ideal candidates for CEs of DSSCs, showing excellent catalytic activity in the redox reaction of the I−/I3− shuttle and superior device efficiency in comparison to the Pt CE, while Fe NPs confined within CNTs did not exhibit sufficient activity in the CE reactions of DSSCs.18 Moreover, different metals can affect the electronic structure of the carbon nanotube surface in a significantly different way, which would have an significant effect on the catalytic activity of the carbon surface.23 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of different metals decorated carbon nanotubes on the activity of CE reactions, and the corresponding DSSC performance, which will provide a rational way to guide the design of the CEs of DSSCs. In this work, we have prepared nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes confining Co or Ni nanoparticles within their tubes, which are correspondingly designated as NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni, respectively, and further assessed their applicability as CEs of DSSCs. Experimental results indicate that both composites display high catalytic activity in the counter electrode reduction reaction (I3− to I−) and good electrochemical stability. Moreover, the DSSC devices yield a powder conversion efficiency (PCE or η) of 7.75% for the NCNT–Co system and 8.39% for the NCNT–Ni, which are comparable to or superior to the control device made of Pt CE (with an efficiency of 7.67%), demonstrating their potential for application in the development of low-cost and high efficiency DSSCs.
The NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni composites were prepared on the basis of the reported process with modification24 using dicyandiamide as the nitrogen and carbon source along with NiCl2 and CoCl2 as catalysts via calcination at 700 °C in a N2 atmosphere. The resulting samples were treated in 1.0 M H2SO4 aqueous solution to remove the metal residues on the external surface of the resulting products, yielding the composites for use as CEs of DSSCs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1a and b reveal respectively the ensembles of the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni, consisting of a large number of nanotubes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to gain information of elements in the composites. As observed in both Fig. 1c and d, the XPS spectra show the presence of two types of nitrogen species, which can be attributed to pyridinic (∼398.8 eV) and quaternary (∼401.0 eV) nitrogen atoms,19 respectively. The doping of nitrogen into the walls of CNTs can improve their catalytic activity in the reduction reaction and enhance wettability of a polar solvent; thus it is very favourable to improve the performance as the counter electrode of DSSC devices.18 The signal intensities of metal Co and Ni are very small in the survey plots of XPS, showing that the contents of both metals are likely very low. Considering the fact that XPS is a tool that is sensitive to the surface elements, the very low signal intensity of Co and Ni can also be attributed to the removal of the metal residues on the external surface of nanotubes due to the H2SO4 washing process in this study. High-resolution XPS displays the peaks with binding energies of 781.8 eV and 797.7 eV, respectively, assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Co (inset of Fig. 1c), while the peaks at 855.2 eV and 872.5 eV correspond to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Ni (Fig. 1d).24 These results confirm the metallic nature of Co and Ni in the composites prepared in this study. EDS analyses further confirm the presence of metal Co and Ni in these nanotube-composites with a higher Ni content than Co, as provided in Fig. S2, ESI.†

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the NCNT–Co sample shows the diffraction peaks located at 2θ degrees of 26.4, which is attributed to the (002) lattice planes of graphite (JCPDS 41-1487). The peaks at 43.7, 51.0 and 74.7 arise from the diffraction of the (111), (200) and (220) planes of Co (JCPDS 150806) (Fig. 2a), respectively. These results prove that carbon nanotubes with graphitic walls were formed, endowing them with high conductivity. Low-magnification transmission microscopy (Fig. 2b) shows that some relative large metal nanoparticles are encapsulated within carbon nanotubes, and high-resolution (HR) TEM in Fig. 2c discloses a number of very small metal nanoparticles distributed randomly on the inner walls of the CNTs. Fig. 2d clearly reveals the graphitic walls of the CNTs, and the metal nanoparticles encapsulated within tubes show an interplanar lattice spacing (d) of 0.205 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of metal Co (inset of Fig. 2d). A similar scenario occurs for the NCNT–Ni materials (Fig. S1, ESI†). The presence of metal nanoparticles within CNTs can promote electron transfer from the metal to the carbon walls, decreasing the surface work function of carbon walls,18,25 thereby improving the reduction ability in the chemical reaction, such as the counter electrode reduction reaction in DSSCs.

To assess the electrocatalytic activity of the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni as counter electrodes to reduce I3− to I− in the DSSC system, cyclic voltammetry (C-V) was first measured with the sputtered Pt electrode as the control sample. Two typical pairs of oxidation–reduction peaks were observed for all of these electrodes. The left pair (A) in the C-V plots is assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3−, which occurs at the surface of or within the counter electrodes. The right pair (B) is attributed to the oxidation and reduction of I3−/I2.18 Thus the left pair of peaks in C-V curves is closely correlated with the catalytic ability of a counter electrode of DSSCs in the reduction of I3− to I−, and further study was focused on it. The peak current density can reflect the catalytic activity of a CE, and larger current density means higher catalytic activity. Fig. 3a shows obviously that the peak current density of the three counter electrodes is in the order Pt < NCNT–Co < NCNT–Ni, suggesting that the catalytic activity of the reduction reaction occurring at counter electrodes is in the same order. Moreover, peak separation between the anodic and cathodic peaks (Epp) is another factor for evaluating the catalytic activity of a material in the CE reaction. Epp is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction. The NCNT–Co electrode displays an Epp value of 131 mV, and the NCNT–Ni shows an Epp value of 119 mV, both of which are smaller than that of the Pt electrodes (with an Epp value of 243 mV). These results suggest that both the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni electrodes show excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of I3− to I− in comparison with the widely used Pt electrode, which is critical to achieving DSSC devices with competitive efficiency.

Electrochemical impedance analyses (EISs) were then performed to further elucidate the catalytic activity of the present NCNT–metal composites using symmetrical cells consisting of two identical CEs. The high frequency intercept on the real axis reflects the series resistance (RS) of the device. The three counter electrodes studied here present a similar RS, indicating that they influence the cell performance to similar extents. The left semicircle in the high-frequency range reveals the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the I3− reduction. Qualitatively, a small arc is favourable for the charge transfer between the electrode and the electrolyte, which is irrespective of the high catalytic activity in the CE reduction reaction and could lead to a lower series resistance and improvement of the efficiency of the DSSC device. The right semicircle in the low-frequency range reflects the properties of the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN), representing the redox couple transport in the electrolyte. A CE with higher activity can reduce I3− to I− faster than that with lower activity, thus the electrolyte should diffuse with a higher speed within a cell with a better CE, thereby showing smaller ZN. This scenario indeed occurred in our case, as shown in Table 1. As Pt CEs show high catalytic activity in the CE reduction reaction, all of the three ZN’s in this study do not show a significant difference. The Nyquist plots for the three CEs were fitted using the Z-view software with an equivalent circuit diagram (as shown in Fig. 3b), giving rise to a Rct of 1.43, 0.78 and 0.50 Ω cm2 for the electrodes of Pt, NCNT–Co, and NCNT–Ni, respectively. These results once again reveal the superior electrocatalytic activity of the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni in the counter electrode reduction reaction of I3− to I−, making them suitable for use as CEs of DSSCs.

To further characterize the catalytic activity of the NCNT–metal composites as CEs for DSSCs, Tafel polarization was carried out using the symmetrical cells. Fig. 3c shows the Tafel curves of the devices made of the NCNT–Co, NCNT–Ni and Pt electrodes. On the basis of eqn (1), one can gain information on the exchange current density (J0) in the Tafel zone, and according to eqn (2), the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) can be analyzed in the diffusion zone. Both J0 and Jlim correlate closely with the catalytic activity of the catalysts.18,26 It can be observed in Fig. 3c that both the anodic and cathodic branches of the Tafel curves show slopes in the order NCNT–Ni > NCNT–Co > Pt in the Tafel polarization zone, indicative of the same order for J0 obtained on these electrodes. Moreover, the NCNT–Ni exhibits a very similar limiting diffusion current density to the NCNT–Co, which is a little higher than the Pt electrodes. These results suggest that the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni can effectively catalyze the reduction reaction of triiodide to iodide around the counter electrodes, showing catalytic ability comparable to or even a little better than the standard Pt electrode. (1) (2)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− at the electrode, and Rct is the charge transfer, D is the diffusion coefficient of the I3−, l is the spacer thickness, and C is the triiodide concentration.
An excellent CE of DSSCs should be highly stable in a working device. So we further checked the electrochemical stability of the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni by measuring sequential CV up to 150 cycles for the three CEs in this study. As shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† the current densities and the Epp experienced negligible change subject to C-V measurements for all of the CEs studied, indicative of the superior stability of the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni in comparison with Pt CEs. This is understandable considering the fact that the metal NPs were confined within the nanotubes and surrounded by multilayers of CNTs (shown by HRTEM in Fig. 2d and Fig. S1b, ESI†), thus preventing them from being directly in contact with the corrosive electrolyte.
Finally, the DSSC devices were fabricated using the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni as CEs of DSSCs along with the sputter Pt electrodes as a control (for details please see the ESI†). Fig. 3d comparatively presents the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices studied here, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The control Pt-based device displays a power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of 7.67% (with a Jsc of 15.74 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.68). In contrast, the NCNT–Co formed cell shows a PCE of 7.75%, very similar to the Pt-based cell. It is very interesting to find that the DSSC device made of the NCNT–Ni CE exhibits an impressive PCE of 8.39%, which is superior to the Pt device. The high performance of the present NCNT–metal (metal = Co and Ni) composites can be attributed to several factors: (a) the graphitic nature of the carbon nanotube walls ensures their high conductivity; (b) the doping of nitrogen into the walls of carbon nanotubes can enhance their catalytic activity toward the reduction reaction and wettability to polar solvent; and (c) the encapsulated metal nanoparticles inside carbon nanotubes endow them with improved reduction ability in the counter electrode reaction. Therefore, the NCNT–metal composites obtained here show great promise as high-efficient CE materials for DSSCs to achieve a good device performance.
In summary, we have demonstrated that, as counter electrodes of DSSCs, the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes confining metal Co and Ni nanoparticles exhibit excellent activity in the reduction reaction of the I−/I3− couple. The corresponding photovoltaic devices made of the NCNT–Co and NCNT–Ni displayed efficiencies of 7.75% and 8.39%, respectively, which are comparable to or superior to that of the control sputtered Pt-based device with a PCE of 7.67%. These results may provide a new route to design highly-efficient counter electrodes of DSSCs with environmental friendliness and cost-effective fabrication, an important step to achieve the large-scale adoption of DSSCs.
