Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are composed of a blend film of a conjugated polymer donor and a soluble fullerene derivative acceptor sandwiched between a PEDOT:PSS coated ITO positive electrode and a low workfunction metal negative electrode. The conjugated polymer donor and the fullerene derivative acceptor are the key photovoltaic materials for high performance PSCs. For the acceptors, although [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) and its corresponding C70 derivative PC70BM are dominantly used as the acceptors in PSC at present, several series of new fullerene derivatives with higher-lying LUMO energy level and better solubility were reported in recent years for further improving the power conversion efficiency of the PSCs. In this perspective paper, we reviewed the recent research progress on the new fullerene derivative acceptors, including various PC60BM-like C60 derivatives, PC60BM bisadduct, PC70BM bisadduct, indene-C60 bisadduct and indene-C70 bisadduct, trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes and other C60 derivatives with multi side chains. The synthesis and physicochemical properties of PC60BM and PC70BM were also introduced considering the importance of the two fullerene acceptors.

1. Introduction
Nowdays, environmental pollution and resource depletion are serious problems which need to be solved urgently. Solar cell is one kind of clean and renewable energy source, and is an ideal alternative to the traditional energy sources such as coal and oil. In the past decades, silicon-based inorganic solar cells have achieved great development, their power conversion efficiency has reached over 20%, and many commercial products of the solar cells have been used in our daily life. However, there exist some disadvantages in the silicon-based solar cells at present, such as high cost, heavy weight, limited silicon sources, high environmental pollution and energy consumption in the production and purification of silicon materials.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn broad attention since their first report in 1995,1–10 because of the advantages of easy fabrication, low cost, light weight and the possibility to fabricate flexible devices in comparison with traditional inorganic semiconductor photovoltaics. PSCs are commonly composed of a photoactive blend film of a conjugated polymer donor and a soluble fullerene derivative acceptor sandwiched between a PEDOT:PSS coated ITO positive electrode and a low workfunction metal negative electrode. When light irradiates on the PSCs through the transparent ITO electrode, the semiconducting donor and acceptor materials in the photoactive layer absorb photons to form excitons (bounded electron-hole pairs), then the excitons diffuse to the donor/acceptor interfaces where the excitons dissociate into electrons on the LUMO level of the acceptor and holes on the HOMO level of the donor. The dissociated electrons and holes then move to and are collected by negative and positive electrode, respectively, to realize the photon-to-electron conversion, as shown in Fig. 1. In the BHJ structure of the photoactive blend film, the polymer electron donor and the fullerene electron acceptor materials form an interpenetrating network with the goal of optimizing the exciton dissociation and charge transport.1
 Fig. 1  Energy level diagram of a donor/acceptor interface showing photoexcitation of an electron into the LUMO of the donor followed by the electron transfer into the acceptor LUMO and migration of the separated charges away from the interface. 
The most representative polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor used in the PSCs are regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) respectively, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM reached reproducibly over 4% by solvent annealing and thermal annealing.2,3 However further improvement of the efficiency of the PSCs is limited by the mismatch of the absorption spectra of the P3HT/PC60BM active layer with the solar spectrum (the absorption edge of P3HT film is only 650 nm and the visible absorption of PC60BM is very weak) and by the big energy loss during the exciton dissociation due to too big an off-set of the LUMO energy levels of donor and acceptor. The off-set energy of 0.3–0.5 eV should be enough as the driving force for the exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface, the LUMO off-set larger than 1 eV for P3HT and PC60BM results in lower open circuit voltage of the devices. For increasing efficiency of the PSCs, various new donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials have been developed in recent years, in pursuing broad and strong absorption in the visible-near infrared region, higher charge carrier mobility and suitable electronic energy levels. Especially, numerous new conjugated polymer donor materials have been reported in literature sources, including polythiophene derivatives with conjugated side chains for broad absorption,6,11–15 cross-linking polythiophene derivatives with conjugated bridges for higher hole mobility,6,16–18 poly(thienylene vinylene) derivatives with broad visible absorption,19–22 narrow bandgap D–A copolymers4,7,23–33 and the copolymers of benzodithiophene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene with lower HOMO energy levels and broad absorption band.10,34–37 The power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on the copolymers of benzodithiophene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene as donor and PC70BM as acceptor has reached over 7%.10,37
In fact, the electron acceptors are of the same importance as that of the electron donors for high performance PSCs. However the research efforts devoted to the acceptors are much less than those on the polymer donors. Although some n-type conjugated polymers with stronger visible absorption have been applied as acceptors in the PSCs,38–44 the fullerene derivatives PC60BM and PC70BM still dominate the acceptors in the PSCs for their high efficiency.1–37 Recently, new fullerene derivatives with up-shifted LUMO energy levels were developed, and the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and the new fullerene derivatives as acceptor show higher open circuit voltage and improved photovoltaic efficiency.45–47 For example, we synthesized a new C60 derivative, indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA) which possesses better solubility and 0.17 eV LUMO up-shift than that of PC60BM.47 The PSCs based on P3HT/IC60BA after device optimization shows a PCE of 6.48% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.84 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.61 mA cm–2 and fill factor (F.F.) of 72.7%, under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2.48 The PCE of 6.48% is more than 60% increased in comparison with that of the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM under the same experimental conditions. The results indicate that there are great opportunities to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs by using new acceptors.
Actually, the LUMO energy level of fullerene acceptors is very important not only for the single bulk-heterojunction PSCs, but also for tandem polymer solar cells. For a series connected tandem solar cell, the front subcell should be composed with a large bandgap polymer donor and the Voc of the whole cell is the sum of the Voc of the subcells.49 So, there should be enough space for up-shift of the LUMO energy level of new fullerene acceptors to get higher Voc and thus to improve PCE of the tandem solar cells.49
Considering the importance of the fullerene acceptors, in this perspective we reviewed the recent research progress on new fullerene derivative acceptors for high performance PSCs. The synthesis and physicochemical properties of PC60BM and PC70BM were also introduced because the two fullerene acceptors are widely utilized in PSCs at present.
2. 
        PC60BM and PC70BM
The studies of PSCs started from the discovery of Sariciftci et al. in 1992 on the photo-induced ultrafast electron transfer between a conjugated polymer MEH-PPV donor and C60 acceptor,50 where C60 was selected as the electron acceptor in considering its high electron affinity. Based on the discovery, they reported double layered PSCs composed of a MEH-PPV donor layer and a C60 acceptor layer.51 However, the PCE of the double layered devices is low, suffered from a short diffusion length (usually ca. 10 nm) of the excitons which results in low charge separation efficiency of the excitons. To overcome this problem, Gang Yu et al. invented the BHJ structure for the PSCs and used soluble C60 derivative PC60BM as acceptor blended with conjugated polymer donor.1 Since then, PC60BM and its corresponding C70 derivative PC70BM which possesses stronger visible absorption than PC60BM are widely used in the fabrication of BHJ PSCs. For the convenience of the discussion in the following, the molecular structures of PC60BM, PC70BM, P3HT, MEH-PPV and MDMO-PPV are shown in Scheme 1.

2.1 Synthesis

          PC60BM was first synthesized by Hummelen and Wudl et al. for the application in photophysical studies toward improvement of photoinduced electron transfer efficiencies in the fabrication of photodetectors and photodiodes.52 The synthetic route of PC60BM is shown in Scheme 2. Under the catalysis of dried chlorine hydride gas or concentrated sulphuric acid, the solution of 4-benzoylbutyric acid and methanol was refluxed for several hours to produce methyl 4-benzoylbutyate. Then the mixed solution of methyl 4-benzoylbutyate and 4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide in methanol or ethanol was refluxed for several hours to get methyl 4-benzoylbutyrate p-tosylhydrazone. Subsequently, using the mixture of pyridine and o-chlorobenzene or pure o-dichlorobenzene as solvent, the mixed solution of methyl 4-benzoylbutyrate p-tosylhydrazone, C60 and CH3ONa was heated to 60–70 °C, then stirred for more than 24 h. [5,6] PC60BM and its multiadduct derivatives were obtained after separation and purification by silicon gel chromatography. Finally, the corresponding [6,6] PC60BM or its multiadducts can be obtained after the solution of [5, 6] PC60BM or its multiadduct derivatives in o-dichlorobenzene was refluxed for 2–7 h, separated and purified by silica gel chromatography. PC60BM was crystalline dark brown powder, and possesses good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene and o-dichlorobenzene. The solubility of PC60BM in toluene could reach 35 g L−1 according to the report by American dye Source Inc. The glass transition temperature, crystallization temperature and melting point of PC60BM are 122, 195 and 290 °C, respectively.53 These results indicate that the thermal stability of PC60BM is good enough for the application as acceptor in PSCs. The electron mobility of PC60BM is ca. 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method.54
 Scheme 2  Synthetic route of PC60BM. 
A weak point of PC60BM as a photovoltaic material is its very weak absorption in the visible region, due to the high degree of symmetry of C60 which makes the lowest-energy transition formally dipole forbidden. To improve the visible absorption of PC60BM for the application as acceptor in PSCs, Hummelen et al. synthesized the corresponding C70 derivative PC70BM.55PC70BM can be synthesized by the same method as that in the synthesis of PC60BM, except using C70 instead of C60 in the synthesis. PC60BM is one single isomer, but PC70BM product is a mixture of three isomers: one chiral a-type isomer and two achiral b-type isomers. The weight ratio of the three isomers is 7:85:8.55
2.2 
          Absorption spectra

The absorption property, especially the absorption in the visible region, is very important for photovoltaic materials. Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of PC60BM and PC70BM in dilute THF solutions with a concentration of 10−5 mol L−1. In the UV-visible region from 200 to 700 nm, the absorbance of PC70BM is much stronger than that of PC60BM. In the visible region from 400 to 700 nm, PC70BM show quite strong absorption, in comparison with the very weak absorption of PC60BM (see inset of Fig. 2). Actually, PC70BM has been widely used instead of PC60BM in the PSCs based on narrow bandgap polymer donors for enhancing the solar light harvest in the wavelength region of 380–500 nm, and many PSCs using PC70BM as acceptor show above 10% higher PCE than that of the corresponding devices with PC60BM as acceptor. However the cost of PC70BM is much higher than that of PC60BM, which could be a problem for future commercial applications in PSCs.

2.3 Electrochemical properties and electronic energy levels
The electrochemical properties and electronic energy levels of the fullerene derivatives are very important for the application as acceptor in PSCs. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs is determined by the difference between the LUMO energy level of the fullerene acceptors and the HOMO energy level of the polymer donors.56,57 Therefore, the LUMO energy level of the fullerene derivatives is a key parameter for the application as an acceptor to match a polymer donor. However, the LUMO energy levels of PC60BM and PC70BM used in literature sources are deviated by ca. 0.6 eV in the range from −3.7 to −4.3 eV. Here we show our results on the electrochemical properties and LUMO energy levels of PC60BM and PC70BM measured by cyclic voltammetry.58

Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammograms of PC60BM and PC70BM in the potential range of 2.0 to −2.5 V vs.Ag/Ag+. The cyclic voltammetry was performed on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation with Pt disk, Pt wire, and Ag/Ag+ electrode (0.01 mol L−1AgNO3, 0.09 mol L−1Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile) as working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) o-dichlorobenzene/acetonitrile (5:1) solution. There are three reversible reduction peaks in the negative potential region from −0.7 to −2.2 V vs.Ag/Ag+ and an irreversible oxidation peak in the positive potential region from 1.0 to 1.8 V vs.Ag/Ag+ for the two fullerene derivatives. The onset reduction potentials (Eredon) of the two fullerene derivatives are both at −0.80 V vs.Ag/Ag+, while the onset oxidation potentials (Eoxon) of PC60BM and PC70BM are at 1.22 and 1.16 V vs.Ag/Ag+, respectively. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the compounds were estimated from the Eredon and Eoxon values according to the following equations:11,59 LUMO = −e (Eredon + 4.71) (eV) and HOMO = −e (Eoxon + 4.71) (eV) where the potential unit is V vs.Ag/Ag+. The LUMO energy levels of PC60BM and PC70BM calculated in this way are both −3.91 eV, while the HOMO energy levels of PC60BM and PC70BM are −5.93 and −5.87 eV, respectively. It should be noticed that the HOMO energy level of −5.93 eV for PC60BM agrees very well with the ionization potential (5.93 eV) of the PC60BM film measured by photoemission yield spectroscopy (PYS).60 The PYS measurements can be performed under vacuum conditions and allow one to quickly determine the ionization potentials of molecules as films. The agreement of the values confirms that the HOMO level of −5.93 eV and LUMO level of −3.91 eV for PC60BM measured by the electrochemical method should be reliable.

2.5 
          PC84BM
        
Hummelen et al. also synthesized the corresponding C84 derivative of PCBM, PC84BM.61PC84BM is a mixture of three major isomers, which is different from PC60BM. Compared with PC60BM and PC70BM, the LUMO energy level of PC84BM is moved downward by 0.35 eV which is undesirable and will result in low Voc when it is used as acceptor in PSCs. PC84BM possesses a relatively high electron-mobility of 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (similar to that of PC60BM and PC70BM) and a broad visible absorption extending to near infrared (the absorption intensity in the visible region is similar to and the absorption wavelength range is longer than that of PC70BM).61 The photovoltaic properties of PC84BM were studied by fabricating the PSC devices with MDMO-PPV (see Scheme 1) as donor and PC84BM as acceptor. With increasing the size of the fullerene cage, the solubility of the big sized fullerene derivative becomes poorer, and the miscibility of the methanofullerenes with MDMO-PPV donor clearly diminishes from PC60BM to PC70BM and then to PC84BM. The PSCs based on MDMO-PPV/PC84BM show poorer photovoltaic performance than that of the PSCs with PC60BM and PC70BM as acceptors. The Voc, Jsc and PCE of the PSCs based on MDMO-PPV/PC84BM were only 0.34 V, 2.11 mA cm−2, and 0.3% respectively.61
3. 
        PC60BM-like C60 derivatives
For further improving the photovoltaic properties of PC60BM, various PC60BM-like C60 derivatives were designed and synthesized by structural modification on the substituent of PC60BM. The substituent on C60 in PC60BM can be divided into a phenyl ring, a butyl middle chain, an ester group and a methyl end group (see Scheme 1).
Cao et al. synthesized four C60 derivatives, PC60BB, PC60BO, PC60BD and PC60BC (see Scheme 3) by changing the methyl end group with butyl, octyl, dodecyl and cetyl groups for further improving the solubility of PC60BM.62 The solubility of the C60 derivatives in organic solvents increased with the increase in the length of alkyl end groups, but there is little influence of the length of the alkyl end group on the electrochemical properties and the LUMO energy levels of the C60 derivatives. They studied the photovoltaic properties of the C60 derivatives by fabricating the PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/MEH-PPV: C60 derivatives (1:4 w/w)/Ba/Al. Their results revealed that PC60BB with butyl end group possesses better photovoltaic performance than that of PC60BM. The PCE of the PSCs based on MEH-PPV/PC60BB reached 2.45%, under AM1.5 illumination (78.2 mW cm−2), while only 2.0% for the PSCs based on MEH-PPV/PC60BM under the same experimental conditions.62
 Scheme 3  Molecular structures of PC60BM-like C60 derivatives. 
Wudl et al. synthesized two PC60BM-like C60 derivatives, p-EHO-PC60BM and p-EHO-PC60BA (see Scheme 3), by adding an alkoxyl substituent on the phenyl ring and changing the methyl end group with a hydrogen atom in p-EHO-PC60BA.63 The alkoxyl substituent on the phenyl ring is for higher solubility, and for facilitating the synthesis, purification, and processing. p-EHO-PC60BM and p-EHO-PC60BA are soluble in dichlorobenzene, etc. The reduction potentials of the two C60 derivatives are slightly negative-shifted in comparison with that of PC60BM, and their LUMO energy levels are slightly up-shifted than that of PC60BM.63 The Voc of the PSCs based on P3HT/p-EHO-PC60BM (or p-EHO-PC60BA) is 40–50 mV higher than that of the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM, which benefits from the slightly LUMO up-shift of the two C60 derivatives. But the Jsc of the two devices were 1–1.5 mA cm−2 smaller than that of the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM, resulting in lower PCE of the two PSCs. Interestingly, when a modification layer of TiOx was applied between the photoactive layer and the negative electrode in the PSCs, the device based on P3HT/ p-EHO-PC60BA showed better photovoltaic performance (PCE = 2.6%) than that (PCE = 2.3%) of the PSC based on P3HT/PC60BM under the same experimental conditions, which can be attributed, in part, to the carboxylic acid group in p-EHO-PC60BA that leads to an effective interface interaction between the active layer and TiOx phase.63 Hummelen et al. also studied the alkoxyl substituent groups on the phenyl ring of PC60BM on the LUMO energy levels of the C60 derivatives and on the Voc of the PSCs based on the C60 derivatives as acceptor.64 They also found that the alkoxyl substituent can raise the LUMO energy level and the Voc effectively.

        Troshin
        et al. synthesized a series of PC60BM-like C60 derivatives, F1–F19, as shown in Scheme 3, for studying the relationship between the structures of the C60 derivatives and their photovoltaic properties.65 In comparison with the side chain of PC60BM, the side chain structure changes of the PC60BM-like compounds are as follows: the butyl middle chain and the ester group were changed to an alkyl chain in F1 and F15, the butyl middle chain was changed to a propyl chain in F2–F7 and F11 with different end groups, the methyl end group was changed to an ethyl group in F8, the phenyl ring was changed to a thienylene ring in F9, the phenyl ring was changed to a furan ring and the methyl end group was changed to an ethyl group in F10, the phenyl ring was changed to a thienylene ring and the butyl middle chain was changed to a propyl chain in F12–F14, the phenyl ring was changed to a thienylene ring and the butyl ester group was changed to a hexyl chain in F16, the phenyl ring was changed to an ester group and the butyl middle chain was changed to a propyl chain in F17 and F18, the phenyl ring was changed to a hydrogen atom, the butyl middle chain was changed to a propyl chain and the methyl end group was changed to an octyl group in F19. They noticed that the solubility of the C60 derivatives is very sensitive to the side chain structures of the compounds, and their photovoltaic properties are tightly related to their solubility. Table 1 lists the solubility of F1–F19 and photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and F1–F19 as acceptor, together with the data of PC60BM for comparison. The electrochemical properties and LUMO energy levels are almost the same for F1–F16, indicating that the side chain modification from the phenyl ring to the thienylene ring and changing the alkyl chain length influence the electrochemical properties and LUMO energy levels of the PC60BM-like C60 derivatives very little. But the little difference in the structure of the C60 derivatives could result in big differene in their solubility.

        et al. found that the solubitily of the C60 derivatives has a very big influence on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and the C60 derivatives as acceptors.65 The Jsc of the devices rapidly increases with the increase of the solubility of the C60 derivatives from 0 to 20 mg mL−1, then it approaches the maximum (ca. 10 mA cm−2) for the solubility between 30 and 70 mg mL−1, and decreases when fullerene derivatives solubility exceeds 100–110 mg mL−1. Rapid increase in Voc is observed when the solubility of the fullerene derivative increases from 0 to 20 mg mL−1 which resembles the trend observed for Jsc. However, further increase in fullerene solubility does not affect Voc as significantly as Jsc but rather keeps it constant at 0.60–0.62 V. Note that all the fullerene derivatives have similar LUMO energy levels which should lead to similar Voc values of the photovoltaic devices from the viewpoint of the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor. Therefore, the observed difference in Voc should be caused by other effects that are governed by their solubility. The fill factor of the PSCs shows a clear maximum for the C60 derivative acceptors with solubility in the range of 40–90 mg mL−1.65
We also synthesized several PC60BM-like C60 derivatives, F20–F24 (see Scheme 3), by changing the butyl middle chain in the side chain of PC60BM to propyl, pentyl, hexyl and heptyl chains for investigating the effect of the alkyl middle chain length on the photovoltaic properties of the C60 derivatives.66 The C60 derivatives have nearly the same absorption and LUMO energy levels. Interestingly, the carbon chain length in the middle alkyl chain has a big influence on their electron mobility and the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and F20–F24 as acceptor. The electron-mobility of F20–F24 in the P3HT/F20–F24 blend films was 2.2 × 10−3, 1.3 × 10−3, 8.4 × 10−5, 3.9 × 10−4 and 2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PCEs of the PSCs based on P3HT/F20–F24 are 3.7, 3.5, 2.3, 3.6 and 2.8% respectively. F20 with one carbon shorter alkyl chain and F23 with two carbons longer alkyl chain show similar or a little higher efficiency than PC60BM with PCE > 3.5%, while F22 with one carbon longer alkyl chain and F24 with three carbons longer alkyl chain display lower efficiency than PC60BM with PCE < 3%. The better photovoltaic performance of F20 may benefit from its higher electron mobility and optimum morphology of the P3HT/F20 blend film. While the poorer photovoltaic performance of F22 could suffer from its lower electron mobility and poorer morphology of the P3HT/F22 film.66 Probably, the conformation change of the side chain by changing the middle alkyl chain length results in the morphology change which influences the electron mobility of the C60 derivatives.
Jen et al. synthesized two PC60BM-like molecules, TPA-PC60BM and MF-PC60BM (see Scheme 3), by replacing the phenylene ring in the side chain of PC60BM with a bulky triphenylamine (TPA) or 9,9-dimethylfluorene (MF), aimed at suppressing the crystallization of the resulting C60 derivatives for high stability PSCs.67 In the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM, the photo-oxidation of P3HT and the crystallization of PC60BM are two main problems for the long term stability of the devices. TPA-PC60BM and MF-PC60BM are amorphous molecules as expected and possess good solubility. The glass transition temperature of TPA-PC60BM and MF-PC60BM are 170 °C and 180 °C, respectively, which is much higher than that (122 °C) of PC60BM.53 The electron mobility for PC60BM, TPA-PC60BM and MF-PC60BM are 1.6 × 10−2, 1.1 × 10−2 and 5.4 × 10−3 cm2/V s, respectively. In addition, the LUMO energy levels of TPA-PC60BM and MF-PC60BM are higher than that of PC60BM, which results from the electron-donating property of TPA and MF groups in their substituent. The PSCs based on P3HT as donor and the C60 derivatives as acceptors were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the C60 derivatives. The Voc of the devices based on TPA-PC60BM and MF-PC60BM were both 0.65 V, 20 mV higher than that of the PSC based on PC60BM, which benefits from the LUMO up-shift of the acceptor. The PCE of the PSCs based on TPA-PC60BM and MF-PC60BM is close to that of the device based on PC60BM with a PCE of ca. 4%. Most importantly, the thermal stability of the PSCs based on TPA-PCBM and MF-PCBM is greatly improved in comparison with that of the device based on PC60BM, thanks to the amorphous characteristics of the two PCBM-like molecules.67
Wudl et al. synthesized a new PC60BM-like molecule, APC60BM (see Scheme 3) by inserting a nitrogen bridge between the side chain and C60 in PC60BM.68,69APC60BM has very good solubility. The electrochemical properties of APC60BM are similar to those of PC60BM. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of APC60BM are −3.7 and −5.5 eV, respectively, which is also similar to that of PC60BM. The electron mobility of APC60BM measured by the FET method is 2.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.69 The Jsc, Voc and PCE of the PSC based on P3HT/APC60BM were 7.14 mA cm−2, 0.58 V and 2.3%, respectively. Drees et al. synthesized a PC60BM-like C60 derivative, PC60BG (see Scheme 3) by changing the methyl end group with a cycloethanone ring.70 There is no phase separation in P3HT/PC60BG film after thermal annealing, but there is serious phase separation in P3HT/PC60BM film and PC60BM aggregation on the surface of P3HT/PC60BM film after annealing at 140 °C. These results indicate that the little change in the side chain of the C60 derivatives has a big influence on the morphology of the active layer in the photovoltaic devices.
Morvillo et al. designed a novel Si-containing PC60BM-like C60 derivative, Si-PC60BM (see Scheme 3).71 They performed a theoretical calculation on the LUMO energy levels of Si-PC60BM and PC60BM which are −2.49 and −2.74 eV, respectively. That is, the LUMO energy level of Si-PC60BM is 0.25 eV higher than that of PC60BM according to the theoretical calculation. Therefore, Si-PC60BM is expected to be a high Voc acceptor for the application in PSCs.

        Fullerene bisadducts and mutiadducts
As mentioned previously, PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM are attractive due to their reproducible high efficiency (higher than 4%), insensitive to the thickness of the active layer in the range of 100–300 nm and low cost of the photovoltaic materials. But too low LUMO energy level of PCBM results in low Voc (limited to ca. 0.6 V) of the P3HT/PC60BM PSCs, which limits further improvement of the device efficiency. Fig. 4 shows the electronic energy levels of the active layer of the P3HT/PC60BM based PSCs. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of P3HT are from the data reported by Hou et al.11 and the energy levels of PC60BM are from ref. 47 and 58 measured by us. The value of ΔE1, the difference between the LUMO levels of the donor and acceptor, provides the driving force for the charge dissociation of the excitons in the polymer donor to overcome the binding energy of the excitons. And the value of ΔE2, the difference between the LUMO level of the acceptor and the HOMO level of the donor, determines the open circuit voltage (Voc).56,57 The value of ΔE3, the difference between the HOMO levels of the donor and acceptor, provides the driving force for the dissociation of the excitons in the acceptor, and assures that there are good charge-transfer and charge-separate states in the donor/acceptor blends.72,73 If the HOMO levels of the donor are too low and make the value of ΔE3 too small, the dissociation of the electron-hole pairs in the donor/acceptor interface will be difficult.72,73 Usually, the binding energy of the excitons is ca. 0.3–0.5 eV, 1.17 eV of ΔE1 is too large, which results in a big energy loss in the exciton charge separation so that it leads to a lower Voc. Obviously, increasing the LUMO level of the fullerene acceptor is an effective way of getting a higher Voc and higher photovoltaic efficiency of the PSCs.74 The fullerene bisadducts and multiadducts which will be discussed in the following sections possess an up-shifted LUMO energy level, and the PSCs with the fullerene derivatives as acceptor showed higher open circuit voltages.

4.1 PCBM bisadduct and multiadduct
In the synthesis of PC60BM, the products also include PC60BM-bisadduct (bisPC60BM), PC60BM-trisadduct (trisPC60BM), PC60BM-tetraadduct and higher-adducts together with PC60BM.75,76 These products could be separated using the silicon gel chromatography method. The structures of these higher adducts are shown in Scheme 4.
 Scheme 4  Molecular structures of PCBM multiadduct derivatives. 
Lenes et al. studied the physical and photovoltaic properties of the fullerene derivatives in detail.76bisPC60BM and trisPC60BM have very good solubility as PC60BM, the LUMO energy level of bisPC60BM is 0.1 eV higher than that of PC60BM, and its electron mobility is 7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1,75 a little lower than that (2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1)53 of PC60BM. The LUMO energy level of trisPC60BM was raised further than that of bisPC60BM, but the electron mobility of trisPC60BM is 5 orders lower than that of PC60BM.76 The photovoltaic properties of the fullerene derivatives were studied by fabricating the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and the fullerene derivatives as acceptor, and the results are listed in Table 2.75,76 The Voc, Jsc and PCE of the devices with bisPC60BM as acceptor were 0.724 V, 9.14 mA cm−2 and 4.5%. The Voc of the device with bisPC60BM as acceptor was 0.15 V higher than that of the device based on PC60BM, and the Jsc and FF of the two devices were similar. The higher Voc benefits from the LUMO up-shift of bisPC60BM. The PCE of the device based on PC60BM-bisadduct was 18% higher than that of the device based on PC60BM, mainly resulting from the higher Voc.75 The Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of the PSC with trisPC60BM as acceptor were 0.81 V, 0.99 mA cm−2, 0.37 and 0.21% respectively (see Table 2).76 The Voc of the device with trisPC60BM as acceptor was 0.2 V higher than that of the device based on PC60BM, but the Jsc and FF were too low, resulting in low PCE of 0.21%. The lower Jsc and FF of the device with triPC60BM as acceptor should suffer from the low electron mobility of triPC60BM.

McGehee et al. investigated the influence of an adduct nember of PC70BM to the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs based on poly(2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (pBTTT) as donor and the fullerene derivatives as acceptor.77 The acceptors they studied include PC70BM and PC70BM-bisadduct (bisPC70BM) (see Scheme 4). They didn't measure the LUMO energy level of bisPC70BM, but they expect ca. 0.1 eV higher than that of PC70BM,76 similar to the case of PC60BM and bis PC60BM.75 The best PSC device based on pBTTT/bisPC70BM (1:1 w/w) had Jsc = 5.35 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.645 V, FF = 0.56, and η = 1.94%, while the best device based on pBTTT/PC70BM (1:4 w/w) showed Jsc = 7.99 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.565 V, FF = 0.55, and η = 2.51% (as listed in Table 2). The 80 mV higher Voc for the device with bisPC70BM as acceptor should result from LUMO up-shift of bisPC70BM. The lower efficiency of the PSC based on pBTTT/bisPC70BM suffered from lower Jsc which is influenced by the different morphology of the two devices.77 Lenes et al. also studied the photovoltaic properties of bisPC70BM with P3HT as donor, and they found that bisPC70BM showed similar photovoltaic performance (see Table 2) as that of bisPC60BM with higher Voc of 0.75 V, similar FF (0.62) and a slightly lower Jsc (7.03 mA cm−2) in comparison with PC60BM.76
Choi et al. synthesized a series of the thienyl-substituted methanofullerenes, including ThC60BM (F9 in Scheme 2), ThC60BM-bisadduct (bisThC60BM), ThC60BM-triadduct (triThC60BM) and ThC60BM-tetraadduct (tetraThC60BM) (see Scheme 4), aiming at improving the miscibility of the polymer donor and the fullerene acceptor and increasing the Voc of the PSCs.78 They also studied the photovoltaic properties of the PSCs with P3HT as donor and the C60 derivatives as acceptor. With the increase of the adduct numbers in the four thienyl-substituted methanofullerenes, their reduction potentials shifted negatively. The first one-electron reduction potentials of the four C60 derivatives are shifted toward more negative values from −0.57 V for ThC60BM to −0.66 V for bisThC60BM and −0.79 V vs.SCE for triThC60BM, indicating that the LUMO energy levels of the multiadducts raised by 0.09 eV for bisThC60BM and 0.22 eV for triThC60BM in comparison with that of ThC60BM.78 The photovoltaic properties of the fullerene derivatives are also shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the photovoltaic performance of ThC60BM is similar to that of PC60BM, but the multiadduct show poorer PCE and lower Jsc and FF values due probably to their lower electron mobility as that of bisPC60BM and triPC60BM.76 Lenes et al. also studied the photovoltaic performance of bisThC60BM and bisThC70BM, their results (see Table 2) indicate that the two bisadducts show higher Voc than that of ThC60BM and ThC70BM, similar to the trend of the devices based on bisPC60BM and PC60BM.76
4.2 
          Indene-C60 bisadduct and indene-C70 bisadduct
For improving the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on P3HT, we recently designed and synthesized a new kind of bisadduct of fullerenes, indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA)47,48 and indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA).58 The structures and synthetic routes of IC60BA and IC70BA, together with indene-C60 monoadduct (IC60MA) and indene-C70 monoadduct (IC70MA) were shown in Scheme 5. It is a simple one-pot reaction for the synthesis of IC60BA and IC70BA. The mixed solution of indene and fullerene (C60 or C70) in o-dichlorobenzene or tri-chlorobenzene was heated to reflux for several hours, the product is a mixture of unreacted fullerene, indene–fullerene monoadduct, indene–fullerene bisadduct and indene–fullerene mutiadduct. The relative percentage of each adduct product in the mixture was determined by the reaction conditions, including reaction time, reaction temperature, concentration of the reaction mixture and molar ratio of indene to fullerene. The mixture products can be separated and purified by the silicon gel chromatography method.47,58 Obviously, the synthesis of IC60BA and IC70BA is easier in comparison to the synthesis of PCBM.
 Scheme 5  Molecular structures and synthetic routes of indene–fullerene adducts. 

          IC60BA and IC70BA have 0.17 and 0.19 eV LUMO up-shift, respectively than that of PC60BM and PC70BM. The LUMO energy level of IC60MA and IC70MA were also ca. 0.05 eV up-shifted than that of PC60BM.47,58 Among the four indene–fullerene adducts, IC60BA has the best solubility, which is even better than that of PC60BM. The solubility of IC60MA and IC70BA is a little poorer than that of IC60BA, while the solubility of IC70MA is the poorest among the four fullerenes and is not suitable for use in PSCs.
The photovoltaic properties of the fullerene derivatives were studied by fabricating the PSCs with P3HT as donor and the fullerene derivatives as acceptor, and the photovoltaic performance was also listed in Table 2. The Voc of the PSCs with IC60BA and IC70BA reached 0.84 V,47,58 which is 0.26 V higher than that of the PSCs with PC60BM as acceptor. Obviously, the great increase on Voc should benefit from the LUMO up-shift of the two bisadduct. The PCE values of the PSCs based on P3HT/IC60BA and P3HT/IC70BA reached 5.44 and 5.64%, respectively,47,58 which is more than 40% increased in comparison with that of the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM. After further device optimization, the PSCs based on P3HT/IC60BA displayed a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 10.61 mA cm−2, a FF of 72.7% and a PCE of 6.48%.48 The Voc of 0.84 V, FF of 72.7% and PCE of 6.48% are all the highest values in the PSCs based on P3HT reported in the literature so far.
It should be mentioned that the fullerene bisadducts and trisadducts mentioned in this section are mixtures of their regioisomers.
5. Endohedrall fullerenes
Trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes (TNEFs) were discovered in 1999 by Stevenson et al.79 Theoretical80 and experimental data81 suggest that the LUMO energy levels of this type of fullerenes are much higher than those of their corresponding empty-cage fullerenes. Recently, Ross et al.82 synthesized a series of soluble PCBM-like Lu3N@C80 derivatives, Lu3N@C80-PCBX with X = M (methyl), B (butyl), H (hexyl) or O (octyl) end groups on the substituents, the molecular structures of Lu3N@C80-PCBM and Lu3N@C80-PCBH are shown in Scheme 6. Lu3N@C80-PCBH shows similar solubility and miscibility to PC60BM when they are used as acceptor blended with P3HT. The LUMO energy level of Lu3N@C80-PCBH is 0.28 eV higher (up-shifted) than that of PC60BM. The electron mobility of Lu3N@C80-PCBH is 4.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PC60BM.
 Scheme 6  Molecular structure of endohedral fullerene derivatives. 
The PSCs based on P3HT as donor, PC60BM and Lu3N@C80-PCBH as acceptors, were fabricated for investigating the photovoltaic properties of the fullerene derivatives. The PSCs based on P3HT/Lu3N@C80-PCBH displayed higher Voc which is 0.26 V higher than that of the PSC based on P3HT/PC60BM, and similar Jsc and FF values as those of the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM. The PCE of the PSCs based on P3HT/Lu3N@C80-PCBH reached 4.2%.82 The result indicates that this kind of endohedral fullerene derivatives could be another type of high Voc acceptor for application in PSCs.
6. Other fullerenes
In addition to the above mentioned fullerene derivative acceptors, there are some other fullerene derivatives for application as acceptors in PSCs reported in literature. Nakamura et al. synthesized a new fullerene derivative, SIMEF with side chains containing Si atoms, as shown in Scheme 7.83SIMEF has good thermal stability and 0.1 eV LUMO up-shift than that of PC60BM. They fabricated the three layer p–i–n photovoltaic devices based on one kind of tetrabenzoporphyin derivative as donor and SIMEF as acceptor. After device optimization, the Voc, Jsc and PCE of the device reached 0.75 V, 10.5 mA cm−2 and 5.2%, respectively, while the Voc, Jsc and PCE of the device with PC60BM as acceptor were only 0.55 V, 7.6 mA cm−2 and 2.0%, respectively.83
 Scheme 7  Molecular structures of some C60 derivatives. 
Frechet et al. synthesized a series of fullerene derivatives, F25–F29, as shown in Scheme 7, for seeking new soluble fullerene derivative acceptors in PSCs.84 All the fullerene derivatives have good solubility in chloroform, toluene, and o-dichlorobenzene. The photovoltaic devices based on P3HT as donor and these fullerene derivatives as acceptor were fabricated and the weight ratios of the acceptors in the active layer were optimized. The PSCs based on F27 and F29 as acceptor showed poorer photovoltaic performance with lower Jsc and Voc. They also found that the fullerene weight ratio in the active layer influenced their photovoltaic properties significantly. The maximum PCE of the PSC based on P3HT/F25 at the fullerene ratio of 45% reached 4.2% with Voc of 0.650 V, Jsc of 11.3 mA/cm2 and FF of 57%.84
Sukeguchi et al. synthesized a series of fullerene derivatives, F30–F41 with the side chains containing two phenyl groups substituted by different eletron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, as shown in Scheme 7.85 All these fullerene derivatives have good solubility in organic solvents. The photovoltaic properties were studied based on the PSC devices with P3HT as donor and these fullerene derivatives as acceptor. Higher Voc values were observed for the devices with F30, F31 F32 and F41 as acceptor, due mainly to the electron-donating alkoxyl groups in their side chains, while the Jsc values were lowered in comparison with that of the device with PC60BM as acceptor. F30 shows the best photovoltaic performance which is close to that of PC60BM.85
Niinomi et al. synthesized some fullerene derivatives, F42–F49 with multi-side chains, as shown in Scheme 7, for application as acceptor in high Voc PSCs.60 The LUMO energy levels of the fullerene derivatives are ca. 0.4 eV up-shifted than that of PC60BM, which is desirable for the acceptors in high Voc PSCs. The PSCs based on P3HT as donor and the fullene derivatives as acceptor were fabricated for studying their photovotlaic properties. The Voc of the devices based on F43, F44, and F48 as acceptor are higher than 0.72 V which is much higher than that of the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM. However, the Jsc and FF values of the devices are much lower than that of the P3HT/PC60BM PSCs, which results in lower PCE of the devices in comparison with that of the device with PC60BM as acceptor.
7. Concluding remarks
15 years have passed since the synthesis of PC60BM and the discovery of bulk-heterojunction PSCs where PC60BM was used as acceptor and MEH-PPV as donor. Numerous conjugated polymer donor materials have been designed and synthesized, and many of them show much better photovoltaic properties than MEH-PPV. But the research efforts devoted to new fullerene acceptors are much less, and the new fullerene derivative acceptors showing better photovoltaic properties than PC60BM are very few. PC60BM is still the most important acceptor material used in the studies of PSCs.
In the new fullerene derivative acceptors reviewed in this paper, progress has been made in two significant areas: one is PC70BM55 which possesses much stronger visible absorption than PC60BM in the wavelength of 350–550 nm and has been widely used as acceptor instead of PC60BM in the high efficiency PSCs with the narrow bandgap conjugated polymers as donor. Another promising new fullerene acceptor is indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA)47,48 which has ca. 0.2 eV LUMO up-shift than that of PC60BM and significantly improved the power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on P3HT by increasing Voc. For the PC60BM-like and multi side chain C60 derivatives, some of them with electron-donating alkoxyl groups in their side chains show LUMO up-shift and higher Voc for the PSCs with P3HT as donor and the C60 derivative as acceptor, but the overall photovoltaic performance is similar to or poorer than that of the device based on PC60BM acceptor, due to lower Jsc and lower FF experiencing lower electron mobility. bisPC60BM shows LUMO up-shift, which causes higher Voc of the PSCs, but its lower electron mobility results in lower Jsc and lower FF. The improvement of the photovoltaic performance by using bisPCBM is limited. Endohedral fullerene Lu3N@C80-PCBH displayed some improved efficiency by increasing Voc, but the improvement is not so significant and the cost of Lu3N@C80-PCBH is not acceptable for application even in the laboratory.
Although the progress on the high efficiency fullerene derivative acceptors has been limited until now, the future is bright and hopeful. Koster et al. carried out theoretical analysis for the PSCs based on P3HT/PC60BM from the viewpoint of energy level match, and they expected that the power conversion efficiency of the P3HT-based PSCs could reach over 8% if we can find a new fullerene derivative acceptor with a LUMO energy level ca. 0.5 eV higher than that of PC60BM.74IC60BA is a successful example towards this goal.47,48 For the C60 derivatives, tuning its LUMO energy level upwards and improving its electron mobility with retaining its high solubility should be pursued in the future for high performance PSCs. Moreover, various new conjugated polymer donor materials with a narrow bandgap and a lower HOMO energy level have been synthesized in recent years for improving the absorption and open circuit voltage of the devices. The miscibility and energy level match of the fullerene acceptors with the low bandgap polymer donors should also be considered for achieving a high power conversion efficiency of the PSCs.
