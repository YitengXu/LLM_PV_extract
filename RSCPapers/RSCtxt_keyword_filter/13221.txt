    , Accepted 1st December 2021First published on 9th December 2021AbstractTernary perovskite oxides are potential candidates as stand-in electron transport materials to replace the conventional binary TiO2 in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here, we report the synthesis of nanostructured perovskite ternary oxide BaSnO3 (BSO) photo anode doped with lanthanum (LBSO) using a facile peroxide route and demonstrate the alternative efficient electron transport layers for DSSCs. A double surface treatment method with TiCl4 was initially applied to the transparent conducting layer (TCL) to enhance the performance of DSSCs based on La-doped BaSnO3. The DSSCs containing the pre-treated (TCL/LBSO3) exhibited better power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.37%. Furthermore, the DSSC device assembled with pre and post (TCL/LBSO3/TCL) surface treated film exhibited the highest PCE of 5.96%, which is 60% higher than DSSC with undoped, pre and post (TCL/BSO/TCL) surface treated film (3.71%). Hence, pre and post-treated LBSO3 can be considered a promising alternative ETL layer for DSSCs due to its superior charge collection efficiency and reduced recombination rates confirmed by impedance analysis.
1. Introduction
The most attractive properties of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) – cost-effectiveness, ease of fabrication, eco-friendliness, non-toxicity, lightweight, good performance in diverse light conditions, and remarkable conversion efficiency – draw attention to explore more in this field. The first DSSC was reported as a breakthrough by Grätzel.1–3 For the past two decades, the DSSC devices have been explored using various photoanode materials, electrolytes, and sensitizers to improve photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. DSSCs are considered a potential alternative for electrical energy from sunlight energy harvesting.4 When the light illuminates the surface of the DSSC device, charge carriers are collected through the photoanode materials. In DSSCs, the promising material photo anode is mesoporous TiO2. It acts as an electron transport layer (ETL), which has a significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of the device. Despite high efficiencies, unremarkable efficiencies have been observed for a couple of decades using the mesoporous TiO2 material.5–9 Even though several binary semiconducting oxides have been reported, such as ZnO, SnO2, and Nb2O5 as alternative ETLs in DSSCs,10–16 none exhibit better performance than the conventional mesoporous TiO2 based ETL. Among those, TiO2 has been mainly investigated as an efficient binary oxide material for DSSCs owing to their higher power conversion efficiency, ease of preparation, and low preparation costs, etc.17,18 However, the binary TiO2 oxide-based photoanode could cause photobleaching of dye molecules in the solar spectrum, particularly in the ultraviolet region, which is a significant drawback for their long-term stability in practical applications.19,20
To overcome the drawbacks of binary oxides, a lot of research has looked at ternary oxide semiconductors such as Zn2SnO4, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, SrSnO3, and BaSnO3 (BSO).21–29 Ternary metal oxides have been chosen since their ionization potential and electron affinity can be easily tuned by adding or doping with impurities to control the valence electron's ionic or covalent bond energy via altering the atomic composition.28,30 Among all of these, BaSnO3 is one of the most promising n-type semiconductor oxides with a perovskite structure with a wide bandgap of 3.2 eV exhibiting higher electron mobility (∼320 cm2 V−1 s−1) which facilitates fast diffusion of the electrons in the conduction band,28 fast electron transport,29 and stability up to 1000 °C, and more rapid dye adsorption ability compared to the binary oxides, TiO2 and ZnO.31,32 BaSnO3 has several applications due to its optical and electrical properties, which can be easily tuned by modifying the atomic composition, appropriate doping and grain size.33 Owing to these properties, BSO is employed as a transparent conducting electrode (TCE),34 gas sensor,35 DSSCs,36etc. Recently, a few reports were published on the photovoltaic performance of BaSnO3 in DSSCs. Zhang et al. reported that dye-sensitized BaSnO3 could be used as a photoanode in DSSCs owing to its faster dye adsorption capability compared to conventional binary oxide materials.37 Guo et al. reported BaSnO3 nanoparticles used as the photoanode, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.1%.36 Recently, Rajamanikam et al. reported PCE of 0.71% without surface treatment and scattering layer.38 In 2018, the same group reported surface treatment on the BaSnO3 layer resulting in enhanced efficiency of 5.64% for 5% Sr doped BSO.39 Moreover, the BSO has been used as an ETL in perovskite solar cells and exhibited enhanced conversion efficiency of around 21% by doping with La, and excellent photostability compared to mesoporous TiO2.40 We have recently reported an efficiency of 1.56% using La-doped nanostructured nanorods/particles synthesized by the hydrothermal method.41 Results showed hybrid nanostructures with a better photovoltaic performance by doping La into the BSO system. Undoubtedly, better understanding and exploration of advanced ternary ETLs draws considerable attention from researchers worldwide.
From the literature reports, one could note that the La-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) is a potential candidate to enhance the photovoltaic performance using it as an electron transport layer. Various methods have been reported in the literature to synthesize BSO materials such as sol–gel, co-precipitation, hydrothermal, solid-state, and oxalate chemical routes. This work has adopted a novel facile peroxide precipitate route to synthesize nanostructured BSO and LBSO particles to enhance the dye adsorption capacity and DSSC device with high efficiency. Until now, few reports exist on LBSO being explored as an electron transport material in DSSCs. However, the optimization of electron transport materials significantly impacts the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC.
In this work we aim to synthesize single phase La doped BaSnO3 nanostructured particles using a facile peroxide route (since the solubility of La in BaSnO3 is limited causing issues like persisting impurity phases). Here, we observe a changeover in morphology towards mixed nano cuboids/nanoparticles upon La doping in ternary perovskite BaSnO3 oxides. Our main interest was to identify a technique to synthesize nanostructured porous BSO to improve its dye adsorption capability within a short period of time for enhancing the cell performance. In augmentation, we have introduced pre and post surface (double-treatment) treatments with TiCl4 on ternary photoanode electrodes to study the impact of the surface treatment on the physical and chemical parameters of the BaSnO3 electrode. We have observed that it has improved dye adsorption on the photoanodes as well as reducing the charge recombination losses in the fabricated devices. The main aim of the present work is to increase the PCE of the DSSC using surface modified La doped BSO photoelectrodes.
In this work, the as prepared BSO and LBSO nanoparticles are investigated using several characterization techniques, and the results are explained in detail for their structural, optical, and electronic properties. These optimized nanostructures are also used as an electron transport layer in DSSCs. Here, the PCE of the DSSC was drastically increased to 5.96% with pre- and post-TiCl4 treated device with La (x = 0.03)-doped BSO photoanode. Moreover, the DSSCs employing LBSO devices as photoanodes exhibited better stability with ∼80% retention of their initial PCE. The electron lifetime and charge transferability were analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to realize the difference in the photocurrent density and photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of Ba1−x LaxSnO3 nanoparticles
All the chemicals used to prepare the nanoparticles are reagent grade and used without any further purification, and all the reactions are performed under ambient conditions. The BaSnO3 nanoparticles were prepared with a solution made using SnCl4·5H2O and BaCl2·2H2O dissolved in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution (170 ml, 30%, OCI), the mixture was continuously stirred until it dissolved completely. Doping of La at the Ba sites of BaSnO3, used La (NO3)3·6H2O and added it to the above precursor solution depending on ‘x’ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05) to result in the Ba1−xLaxSnO3 compound. While stirring, to suppress the agglomeration of the particles, we added 5 mmol (0.96 g) of citric acid (C6H8O7) to the above solution. To get the precipitation to occur, ammonia solution was added slowly to the precursor solution, until it reached a pH value of 10 with constant stirring. After adding the ammonia solution, the transparent mixed solution turned to a milky white color and gradually became fully white due to the precipitation of the precursor mixture solution. The resultant precursor mixture solution was continuously stirred at 40 °C in a water bath for 12 h to obtain crystalline precipitates. As per requirements, the reaction temperature and duration can be changed from 40 °C to 60 °C for 1 h to 12 h, respectively. After 12 h of reaction, the white precipitate was formed. In fact, the precipitate was formed within 1 h, and the white precipitate product is thoroughly washed with distilled water and ethanol by centrifugation. The obtained product was vacuum dried at room temperature and then annealed at 900 °C for 2 h in an air atmosphere to form BaSnO3 (BSO) and La-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) nanocrystalline particles. For the convenience of all the La-doped BSO samples, we coded them as LBSOx (x = 1, 3, and 5) in this manuscript, where 1, 3 and 5 indicate 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05 La atomic percentages, respectively.
2.2 Preparation of BSO and LBSO electrodes
Pastes of nanostructured BSO and LBSOx samples were made using the synthesized nanocrystalline particles and were coated onto ultrasonically cleaned and Ozone treated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates by the doctor-blade method. Firstly, the fine homogeneous paste was prepared with the mixture of BSO and LBSOx nano powders, 10 wt% of ethyl cellulose and 5 wt% of α-terpineol (Sigma Aldrich) and ethanol by gradually mixing to result in a viscous paste. This viscous paste was continuously ground using a pestle and mortar for 30 min to form a homogeneous paste. Here, we have followed the double surface treatment method with TiCl4. Firstly for the pre-treatment, the cleaned FTO glass substrates were surface treated with 0.05 M of TiCl4 aqueous solution pre-treated for 30 min at 80 °C and then rinsed with double deionized (DI) water, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. The prepared BSO and LBSOx nanostructured paste was coated onto TiCl4 (TCL) pre-treated FTO glass substrates by the doctor-blade method with a cell area of 0.25 cm2, and it was then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in an air atmosphere and this electrode was named as TCL/BSO and TCL/LBSOx accordingly. For post-treatment, the annealed pre-surface-treated TCL/BSO and TCL/LBSOx films were treated again with 0.05 M of TiCl4 aqueous solution at 80 °C for 30 min and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min, named as TCL/BSO/TCL and TCL/LBSOx/TCL.
2.3 Material characterization techniques
The crystallinity and phase purity of BSO and LBSOx nanoparticles were characterized using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (PAN analytical ‘X’Pert Pro with Cu-Kα radiation, 1.5406 Å). The surface morphologies of the synthesized nanostructured powders were investigated by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (Hitachi, S-4300SE), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Model: Talos F200S G2, Thermofisher) fitted with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectroscopy unit. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured using an AXIS Nova (Kratos Analytical Ltd, Model: ESCA 3400) equipped with dual Mg/Al as an X-ray source, and the pass energy of the spectrometer was set to 150 eV for the spectrum measurements. The optical properties were studied using UV-Vis in diffuse reflectance spectroscopy mode (UV-Vis-DRS) (Analytik Jena, SPECORD-210 Plus). The current–voltage (I–V) measurements were carried out using a Keithley meter 2400 digital source under 1 sun illumination from a Class AAA solar simulator (Oriel instruments). The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using Enli Technology Co., Ltd instrument (Model QE-R3011). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded using an impedance analyzer (Solartron SI 1260) in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz.
2.4 Fabrication of DSSC
For the dye adsorption, the post-surface-treated BSO and LBSOx films were soaked in 0.5 mmol of N719 dye (Greatcellsolar, Australia) solution prepared in absolute ethanol by stirring at room temperature merely for 1 h. Here, it is to be noted that the dye adsorption duration is much shorter than traditional electron transport materials, e.g. 12 h for TiO2, 12 h for Zn2SnO4, 120 h for BiFeO3, etc.42–44 After the dye adsorption, the films were thoroughly rinsed with ethanol to remove the physically adsorbed dye molecules on the surface of the films. The platinum counter electrodes were coated by drop-casting using 5 mM chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6, Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in isopropyl alcohol on cleaned FTO substrates, and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 30 min under an ambient atmosphere. The sandwich-type DSSC was assembled using dye adsorbed BSO/LBSOx photoelectrodes and platinum-coated counter electrodes. The photoanode and platinized counter electrodes were sandwiched using hot melt film (55 µm, Surlyn, Greatcellsolar). The electrolyte was prepared with 0.5 M of 1-butyl-3 methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.06 M of iodine (I2), 0.1 M of LiI, and 0.5 M of tert-butyl pyridine (tBP), all mixed in acetonitrile solvent. All the chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar and are used without further purification. After sandwiching both electrodes, the prepared I−/I3− liquid electrolyte was infiltrated through the pre-drilled holes from the counter electrode side of the fabricated cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase analysis and structural properties
The synthesized BSO and LBSOx (x = 1, 3, and 5) nanocrystalline powders annealed at 900 °C for 2 h in air atmosphere were characterized by XRD analysis. Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic crystal structure of the perovskite Ba1-xLaxSnO3 compound. The sample's purity and phase structure carefully examined by the XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1b. The BaSnO3 has an ideal cubic perovskite structure with the space group Pm3m, and the Ba2+ ions have occupied the center of the body and are surrounded by eight SnO6 octahedral (shown in Fig. 1a) structures. The obtained diffraction results matched well with the JCPDS card no. 74-0780 indicating the phase purity of the cubic perovskite structure reported with a lattice parameter of a = 0.4117 nm for the BaSnO3 compound. The obtained XRD patterns of all the samples confirm the formation of a single-phase without any impurities like lanthanum oxides (La2O3, La2Sn2O7). We could not observe any significant difference between the XRD spectra of BSO and LBSOx samples. From Fig. 1b, we confirm good crystallinity and purity for the BSO and LBSOx nanocrystalline particles. Thus, it can be confirmed that La is doped into the Ba site of the crystal lattice of the BSO system. We have also performed crystal structures analysis of all the samples using Rietveld refinement based on the XRD data (see Fig. S1, ESI†); the obtained lattice refinement parameters are given in Table 1. Increasing the concentration of La3+ (radius = 1.36 Å) ions into the Ba (Ba2+ radius = 1.61 Å) sites from x = 0 to 0.05, all the samples show a cubic structure with the same space group of Pm3m. From Table 1, we can see that the lattice parameters and unit cell volumes are monotonically decreased due to the smaller ionic radius of the La3+ ions.45 Additionally, we have calculated the crystallite size using the Scherrer equation D = Kλ/βcosθ, where, D is the crystallite size, K denotes the Scherrer constant (shape factor), β is the full-width half maxima in radians (FWHM), and θ is Bragg's diffraction angle in degrees. The calculated crystallite size using the FWHM of the strongest (110) crystallographic plane was found to be 12.4 nm, 12.6 nm, 11.09 nm, and 10.10 nm for BSO, LBSO1, LBSO3, and LBSO5, respectively.

The electronic energy band diagram of perovskite BaSnO3 is schematically shown in Fig. 1c. Usually, the perovskite ternary oxide's energy band is affected by the Sn–O bond hybridization. Here, the La dopant significantly changes the conduction band minimum (CBM) state by orbital hybridization. The perovskite BaSnO3 energy band comprises CBM and valence band maximum (VBM) by Sn 5s/5p and O 2p orbitals, respectively. Here, the VBM is dominated by the O 2p orbitals, and at the same time, CBM is dominated by the Sn 5s/5p orbitals. Upon increasing the La3+ ions at the Ba2+ sites, the unit cell volume reduces, and the average bond length also reduces due to a decrease in the unit cell volume results, the strength of Sn–O bond hybridization increases causing the larger crystal field splitting, resulting in the upward shift of CBM and an increase in the bandgap in La-doped BaSnO3 samples.46–49 These results show that the La substitution effectively changes band position and the bandgap of the perovskite BaSnO3 compound, thereby enabling optimization of band offset between sensitized dye/ETL in DSSCs. The basic schematic DSSC device structure is shown in Fig. 1d. The surface morphological features of the synthesized nanostructured BSO and La (x = 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05) doped BSO particles were obtained by controlled experimental parameters.
FE-SEM images of BSO and La-doped BSO samples are shown in Fig. 2(a–d), and nanostructured particles were observed from the FE-SEM images. Here, we have determined the average particle size of the La-doped samples, which exhibit similar particle sizes (∼20–30 nm).

The cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the photoanode layer is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a and c for BSO and LBSO3 films, respectively.
In general, the crystallinity of the synthesized nanostructured particles is crucial to improving the charge transport in the ETL. Therefore, the crystallinity and morphological features of the BSO and LBSO3 samples were further characterized by the TEM measurements shown in Fig. 3(a–g). The BSO TEM images (Fig. 3a) shown irregular nanostructured particles and the LBSO3 exhibited the nanocuboids/nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 3(d and e). Hence when doped with La, a mixed morphology was observed with perfect nano cuboids/particles (see Fig. 3d), and it is noticed that the crystallinity also improved for the LBSO3 compared to the BSO sample. The calculated width and breadth of the LBSO3 nanocuboids were ∼18–24 nm and ∼20–26 nm, respectively. The average particle size was also determined as ∼18 nm and 15 nm for BSO and LBSO3 samples, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images at 10 nm (nano cuboid for LBSO3, see Fig. 3f) are shown in Fig. 3b and f for BSO and LBSO3, respectively.

The HR-TEM images reveal that the bulk of the nanostructured particles were nearly defect-free, as evident from the lattice fringes. The lattice fringes of d-spacing (inset of Fig. 3(b and f) were determined around 2.92 Å and 2.98 Å for BSO and LBSO3, respectively, which corresponds to the (110) diffraction plane of the cubic structure of the BSO system. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of BSO and LBSO3 are shown in Fig. 3c and g. The pattern showed that the synthesized nanostructured particles of BSO and LBSO3 samples exhibited a highly crystalline nature with single-phase crystal structure, which also agrees with the XRD patterns.50
We investigated the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis for the elemental composition and identification of La presence in BSO nanoparticles and the results are shown in Fig. 3h. We confirmed that Ba, Sn, and O elements are present in the sample without any other impurities from the EDS data. In Fig. 3h, the peaks at 0.85 keV, 4.12 keV, and 4.51 keV belong to La and proved La is present in the BSO system.

Fig. 4a shows the UV-Visible absorption spectra (UV-Vis DRS) of BSO, LBSO1, LBSO3, and LBSO5 samples recorded from 200–800 nm at room temperature. The absorption of all the samples was higher in the visible region; notably, it was significantly more elevated for the LBSO3 as shown in Fig. 4a. The energy bandgap calculated from well-known Tauc plots for the nanostructured BSO, LBSO1, LBSO3, and LBSO5 samples were 3.23 eV, 3.24 eV, 3.25 eV, and 3.29 eV, respectively (shown in the inset of Fig. 4a). As discussed above, the change in energy bandgap with increasing La content was possibly caused by the Sn–O bond hybridization. It is primarily noticed that the bandgap absorption edge is shifted to higher energy, i.e., the BSO and La-doped BSO samples are dominated by CBM of Sn 5s/5p orbitals, while VBM is dominated by the O2p orbitals.46 It indicates that the change in optical bandgap caused by the substitution of La3+ ions can be attributed to the movement of CBM toward higher energy levels46 (see Fig. S2b, ESI†); this so-called Burstein-Mass shift indicates a large conduction band (CB) dispersion.47 The movement of CBM positions of ternary oxides (BSO and LBSO) were estimated from the Mott–Schottky measurements based on the equation given below. 1/C2 = (2/εoεsND)[V − Vfb (kBT/q)](1)where C is the space–charge capacitance, εo and εs are the dielectric constants of free space and the film electrode, respectively, q is the electronic charge, Vfb is the flat band potential, T is the temperature in Kelvin, ND is the donor density, V is the applied potential, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The Vfb value can be determined by extrapolation to the x-intercept as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). An increase in the La content leads to a gradual upward shift in the flat-band potential (Vfb) from −0.56 V to −0.75 V where the Vfb can be considered as an approximation of the CBM.50 Generally, a negative shift in the CBM accompanies a Fermi-level (EF) shift to a more negative potential.51 These results indicate that energy levels can be tailored by forming Ba1−xLaxSnO3 ternary oxides causing a shift in EF towards a more negative potential, which is beneficial for the output voltage in photovoltaic devices because it can reduce the band offset between the ETL and the dye.

(h) The characteristics of photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs fabricated with post-treated BSO and LBSOx (x = 1, 3, and 5) used as photoanodes, and (i) external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of post-treated BSO and LBSO samples. (Where 1, 3 and 5 LBSO indicate 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05 of La, respectively). 

Fig. 4b shows that the incorporation of La dopant ions is supported by the respective changes in the percentage of diffuse reflectance spectra of the synthesized samples. Dye loading measurements were carried out to determine the effect of mixed (cuboids/particles) nanostructures on the dye adsorption capability of the BSO, LBSO1, LBSO3, and LBSO5 films. The dye loading capacity was evaluated by measuring the amount of N719 dye desorbed from the photoanode into the solvent, as shown in Fig. 4c, and the calculated dye loading values are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The adsorption of dye solution corresponding to the surface-treated LBSO3 film is higher than that of the BSO film. For the pre and post-surface-treated La-doped films, the amount of dye loading increases with increasing La content and it reaches the maximum absorption intensity up to x = 0.03 and afterward decreases for x = 0.05. The higher dye adsorption for La-doped BSO might be due to the composite morphology structure (nano cuboids/particles).
Furthermore, noting the charge state and binding energy of elements present in BSO and LBSOx samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement was performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 4(d–g). The full survey spectrum of LBSO3 indicated the presence of the constituent elements Ba, Sn, O, and La, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). From Fig. 4d, the characteristic doublet peaks of Ba were observed at binding energies of 779.2 eV and 794.70 eV ascribed to Ba 3d5/2 and Ba 3d3/2 for BSO and LBSO3 samples, respectively. The peaks both have symmetrical shapes, indicating that the La-doped BSO nanoparticles have a highly crystalline nature.28Fig. 4e shows the two doublet peaks at 485.78 eV and 494.26 eV corresponding to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively, and no shift was observed in the Sn 3d spectra. The symmetric peak at 530.18 eV is attributed to O 1s spectra and is shown in Fig. 4f. It is the characteristic O2− ions peak in the BSO metal oxide lattice framework. From Fig. 4g, the La 3d spectra of LBSO3 exhibits two prominent distinct peaks at 833.50 eV and 851.34 eV for La 3d5/2 and La 3d3/2, respectively. The XPS data ensures the presence of La doping ions in the BSO crystalline nanoparticles and the existence of the most stable valence states of +II, +IV, −II, and +III for Ba, Sn, O, and La elements present, respectively, in the cubic BaSnO3 perovskite compound.
To demonstrate the potential use of the La substitution in the BaSnO3 perovskite material as an ETL in photovoltaics, we have fabricated DSSCs using pre- and post-surface-treated pure BSO and LBSOx nanostructured particles and tested their photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 4h). The amount of dye loading on the surface of photoanodes strongly influences the photocurrent density, thereby its DSSCs device performance. The optimized DSSC devices were measured under simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The detailed J–V parameters are shown in Table 2 for post-surface-treated BSO and LBSOx-based photoanodes in DSSCs. Briefly, for the pre-treatment, the cleaned FTO substrates were immersed in 0.05 M of TiCl4 aqueous solution and used as conductive substrates to deposit the BSO and LBSOx (x = 1, 3, and 5) nanostructured particles, and are referred to as TCL/BSO and LBSOx in this manuscript. The same films were further treated with TiCl4 solution and mentioned in the manuscript as TCL/BSO/TCL and TCL/LBSOx/TCL for the post-surface treatment. For comparison, the pre-treated BSO and LBSO photoanodes (TCL/BSO and LBSOx) performance were also measured and are included in Fig. S4 with values in Table S2 (ESI†).

Among these pre-treated cells, a maximum current density of 8.95 mA cm−2 and conversion efficiency of 4.37% was achieved for the LBSO3 cell. It has been reported that there is a possibility of enhancing the cell efficiency by pre-surface treatment with TiCl4 on the FTO. Here, TiCl4 forms a thin layer of TiO2 on FTO and improves the bonding strength between FTO glass and the TiO2 layer so that it increases the conductivity of the interface between the thin layer of TiO2 and FTO. Moreover, it reduces recombination between electrons within the electrolyte that contains the electron–hole pairs, these processes can enhance the current density, and subsequently, improve the power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.35,52,53 The post-treated DSSC device, the LBSO3 sample, exhibited the best power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.96% with the current density (JSC) of 14.37 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.72 V, and fill factor (FF) of 57.56%. While further increasing the La substitution (x = 0.05) resulted in decreased power conversion efficiency to 4.24%. This decrease may be caused by the reduced injection efficiency from dye to ETL because of the higher CBM of the ETL for x = 0.05 La substitution as discussed in the above section. (i.e., higher bandgap value of 3.29 eV). Among all the tested devices, the TCL/LBSO3/TCL-based device showed the highest performance, which is mainly attributed to the high VOC and JSC values.
Moreover, higher electron density and efficient electron injection created by doping with La into the BSO system might have induced the built-in potential between the dye and semiconducting layer,54 which may be the reason for the increased VOC and JSC for LBSO3 nanostructured particles. Finally, the photoelectric conversion efficiency is enhanced remarkably with pre/post-surface treated La-doped BSO electrodes. These results imply the auspicious performance in photovoltaics by La3+ cations doping into the BSO lattice.

Fig. 4i shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the post-treated BSO and La-doped BSO-based DSSCs. The measured IPCE spectra indicate that all the fabricated DSSC cells show broad spectra over the 300–800 nm wavelength range with maximum efficiency peaking around ∼45% at around 520 nm. Fig. 4i shows that the intensity of the EQE increases while increasing the incorporation of La3+ ions into BSO from x = 0 to 0.03 and then decreases for 0.05 La-doped BSO; the same trend was observed in JSC (Fig. 4h). We have also measured the EQE for TiCl4 pre-treated electrodes of BSO and LBSOx based cells and the spectra are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) for comparison. Also, we have calculated charge collection efficiency (ηcc) and charge injection efficiency (−Δginj) for post treated photoanaode based DSSC devices, and values are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The observed values are in good agreement with the obtained JSC values.
3.2 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were taken to investigate the interfacial reactions of photoexcited electrons and electron transport kinetics within the fabricated DSSC devices. The Nyquist (including equivalent circuit) and bode plots of post-treated BSO and LBSOx (x = 1, 3, and 5)-based DSSC devices measured from 0.1 Hz to 106 Hz are shown in Fig. 5(a and b). According to the equivalent circuit model fitting, the obtained resistance values are shown in Table 3. The series resistance (RS) values can be recognized as the resistance at the interface of FTO and photoanode material. The RS values of the DSSCs based on BSO, LBSO1, LBSO3, and LBSO5 determined according to the equivalent circuit are 17.90 Ω, 18.39 Ω, 19.40 Ω, and 18.02 Ω, respectively. All the devices showed nearly identical charge transfer resistance in the high-frequency region, mainly due to the similar electrolyte (I−/I3−) and counter electrode (Pt) used for all the DSSC cells. The mid-frequency region showed a bigger semicircle in Nyquist plots corresponding to charge transfer resistance (RCT2) of oxide/dye/electrolyte interfaces, which strongly depends on the band-bending due to heterostructures based on the heterostructured photoanodes.39 Here, the interest is on the RCT2 at the devices' oxide/dye/electrolyte interface. From Fig. 5a, it is clear that the radius or size of the semicircle decreased while increasing the La doping content in the BSO system (up to x = 0.03). The observed resistance values at the oxide/dye/electrolyte interface are 16.80 Ω, 14.76 Ω, 12.84 Ω, and 15.71 Ω for pure BSO, LBSO1, LBSO3, and LBSO5 devices, respectively. The lower RCT2 value for the device with LBSO3 leads to efficient charge carrier transportation, demonstrating lower electron transport resistance and fewer electrons going back to the redox mediator at the oxide/dye/electrolyte interface. Hence, the change in the current density is attributed to the difference in the charge transferability. Among all the fabricated DSSCs, the pre-treated LBSO3 and post-treated LBSO3 photoanode cells (see Fig. S5, ESI†) exhibited the lowest series resistance (RS) 22.01 Ω and 19.20 Ω, respectively, and charge transfer resistance (RCT2) values of 13.47 Ω and 12.84 Ω, respectively. These results exhibit better charge transfer and also increased performance of the LBSO3 photoanode-based DSSC device after TiCl4 post-treatment. Additionally, the electron lifetime (τe) values were evaluated from the bode plot (Fig. 5b) as a function of frequency using the EIS model relation τe ≈ 1/ωmax, where ωmax is the maximum peak frequency in the RCT2 region. The analysis showed that noticeable differences in the electron lifetime values were in the order LBSO3 (6.96 ms) > LBSO1 (6.26 ms) > BSO (5.84 ms) > LBSO5 (5.74 ms). Here, lower resistance and long electron lifetime facilitate faster electron transport to ETL, resulting in slower electron recombination and increasing the electron capture ability.55–57 The electron lifetime value for the DSSC using post-treated LBSO3 was longer than those using other pure BSO and LBSOx photoanodes due to the appropriate La substitution into the Ba site of BSO lattice, which acts as a charge trapping site.

3.4 Effect of surface treatment
It is well known that apart from JSC and VOC, the fill factor (FF) is another critical parameter in evaluating the performance of DSSC devices. Significantly, series resistance, built-in voltage, and fabrication of DSSC devices affect the FF and JSC of solar cells.58,59 Here we firmly believe that the attenuation of FF of post treated cells was due to an increment in series resistance for LBSOx devices over the BSO device. Also, we observed that the charge transfer resistance RCT2 was reduced by doping with La content into the BSO system. Therefore, this may imply that post-surface treatment results in an unprecedented escalation in the dye molecule adsorption, as shown in Fig. 4c. These results may convey that the pre and post-treatment of BSO, LBSO1, LBSO3, and LBSO5 surfaces provide more specific binding states. Potentially, the pre and post-treatments of the surface may diminish the fraction of the TiO2 surface area that is inaccessible for the dye due to steric constraints.31 These results clearly show that the La-doped BSO photoanodes are beneficial to increase the electron conduction for the efficient performance of DSSC devices.
3.5 Long term stability test
To study the stability of the prepared photoanode in DSSCs, cells were sealed with hot melt film, and the electrolyte was infiltrated through the hole drilled on the counter electrode. Fig. 5c shows the change of photovoltaic parameters with time for the cells based on post-treated BSO and LBSOx photoanodes. The fabricated devices were subject to 16 days of use and stored in ambient air. During the 16 day test, the photovoltaic performance was remarkably stable. Fortunately, the nanostructured La-doped BSO photoanode devices still retained ∼80% of their initial PCE for up to 16 days of the test. Thus, the long-term stability for La-doped BSO-based DSSCs highlights their possible use in future solar cells.
4. Conclusions
In summary, crystalline La-doped BaSnO3 nanostructured particles were successfully synthesized via a facile peroxide-chemical route and coated as ETLs in DSSCs. Here, different amounts of La were doped in the BSO system and we studied their structural and optical properties to perceive the favorable interactions in the photoanode interface of DSSCs. A specific quantity of La content of x = 0.03 leads to the formation of nanocuboids/particles of BaSnO3 samples with well-described nanostructures, which are very effective in exhibiting expeditious dye adsorption compared to the pristine BSO photoanode (within a short time of 60 min). The pre-treated LBSO3-based cell showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.37%. A typical post-TiCl4 treatment of photoanode further enhanced the conversion efficiency to 5.96% for LBSO3 cells, which is attributed to the increased electron lifetime and charge transferability confirmed from the EIS analysis. This is one of the highest efficiencies without using any scattering layer on La-doped BaSnO3 nanostructures, which shows great potential use for photoanodes in DSSCs. We believe that La doping BSO will provide a valuable route for designing high-performance and long stability DSSCs.
