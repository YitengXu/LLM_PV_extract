    , Accepted 24th May 2017First published on 24th May 2017AbstractPerovskite solar cells now compete with their inorganic counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency, not least because of their small open-circuit voltage (VOC) losses. A key to surpass traditional thin-film solar cells is the fill factor (FF). Therefore, more insights into the physical mechanisms that define the bias dependence of the photocurrent are urgently required. In this work, we studied charge extraction and recombination in efficient triple cation perovskite solar cells with undoped organic electron/hole transport layers (ETL/HTL). Using integral time of flight we identify the transit time through the HTL as the key figure of merit for maximizing the fill factor (FF) and efficiency. Complementarily, intensity dependent photocurrent and VOC measurements elucidate the role of the HTL on the bias dependence of non-radiative and transport-related loss channels. We show that charge transport losses can be completely avoided under certain conditions, yielding devices with FFs of up to 84%. Optimized cells exhibit power conversion efficiencies of above 20% for 6 mm2 sized pixels and 18.9% for a device area of 1 cm2. These are record efficiencies for hybrid perovskite devices with dopant-free transport layers, highlighting the potential of this device technology to avoid charge-transport limitations and to approach the Shockley–Queisser limit.

Broader context
Due to their simple fabrication, perovskite solar cells attract enormous attention for photovoltaic applications. However, today's best performing perovskite cells employ inorganic oxide layers which often require high temperature treatments. Moreover, chemical doping of transport layers is required to boost the conductivities for efficient charge extraction. While doping has been linked to accelerated device degradation, it also complicates the solution preparation and layer formation. In this work we visualized the extraction of charge carriers to the electrodes in operational, highly efficient p–i–n type cells with all-organic undoped transport layers. Thereby, we identified the carrier transit time through the organic hole transport layer as the bottleneck for efficient charge extraction. The findings allowed us to fabricate stable devices employing ultrathin undoped transport layers in which the active perovskite fills nearly 95% of the cell volume. Exceptional fill factors up to 84% were realized with efficiencies beyond 20%. We also demonstrate that our device architecture is fully scalable without appreciable efficiency losses when the device area is increased from 6 mm2 to 1 cm2 cells. At the same time, we highlight the importance of fundamental non-radiative recombination losses – included in the cells’ ideality factor – that limit the fill factor to its thermodynamic limit.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells demonstrate an enormous potential for next generation photovoltaics because of their ease and low cost of fabrication in combination with their excellent light-harvesting properties.1–3 For example, perovskite solar cells exhibit the shortest energy payback time (∼0.2 years) among all existing photovoltaic technologies according to a recent estimate.4 Another promising feature of perovskite solar cells is their high open-circuit voltage (VOC),5–7 due to small non-radiative recombination losses. While significant effort is currently being devoted to understanding and improving the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells,5,6 for example via improving the selectivity of the charge transport layers,8 significantly less effort has been made to reach a quantitative understanding of the critical factors that determine the bias dependence of the photocurrent, and thus implicitly the fill factor (FF) of these cells. In addressing this equally important question, it is critical to distinguish different processes that limit the fill factor of solar cells. One of the most fundamental differences is whether charge recombination is radiative or non-radiative. Generally, radiative recombination is an inevitable loss mechanism and sets – according to the Shockley–Queisser model9 – the upper FF limit to ∼90% for perovskite solar cells at room temperature with open-circuit voltages between 1.2 V to 1.3 V. Non-radiative recombination imposes a secondary limitation. In the simplest case, the contribution from additional non-radiative recombination channels to the current–voltage characteristics can be expressed using a modified Shockley equation by considering an ideality factor n > 1 and a dark generation current JG,0 that is larger than the radiative recombination current JradG,0. Thus, knowing the ideality factor and the open-circuit voltage one can estimate the fill factor potential of perovskite solar cells, which is for example around 85% at room temperature assuming an ideality factor of 1.5 and a typical VOC of 1.1 V.10 However, in a vast majority of cases, perovskite solar cells exhibit much lower FFs (usually around 60–70%)11 and even today's highest performing cells with power conversion efficiencies of 21.6%12 and 22.1%13 exhibit significantly lower fill factors of around an average of 78% and 80%, respectively. The reason must be related to additional charge transport losses which originate from inefficient charge extraction of the cells, or current leakage through shunts. Both loss mechanisms can be included in a modified Shockley equation by considering a finite series and shunt resistance, respectively. Understanding the origin of these losses will be highly relevant in order to reach the Shockley–Queisser FF limit. However, a quantitative analysis of the charge transport and recombination processes in complete solar cell remains a challenging task due to the large mobility mismatch between the transport layers and the perovskite absorber.14,15
Here, we investigate the processes limiting the FF in efficient p–i–n type triple cation hybrid perovskite solar cells, and in particular the role of charge extraction through the charge transport layers (CTLs). We decided to perform our studies on CTLs made from conjugated organic materials (COMs). In contrast to the often employed inorganic metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO or SnO2,16,17 the electronic properties of COMs can be easily adjusted through chemical design. Also, COMs allow layer deposition with simple techniques such as spin-coating or thermal vacuum deposition, and high temperature post-deposition treatments are generally not needed. Notably, all of our studies concern undoped organic layers, thus simplifying solution preparation, layer formation and device reproducibility. Chemical doping has also been identified as a source of accelerated device degradation.11,18 To this end we studied the charge carrier transit through the organic transport layers, and its impact on the efficiency of charge collection and the recombination order in cells with varying transport layer thicknesses. Using integrated time of flight (iTOF)19,20 measurements we are able to visualize, in operational solar cells, the charge extraction through the organic CTLs. We show that the FF and electron extraction through the C60 electron transport layer (ETL) is efficient and loss-free, and that it is the hole transport layer which creates the bottleneck for the FF in today's most efficient p–i–n perovskite cells. The results are corroborated by steady-state intensity dependent photocurrent measurements, which show a strong reduction of first and higher order recombination losses in the power generating regime of the JV-curves upon decreasing the transit time through the HTL. We demonstrate that reducing the transit time through the HTL allows essentially avoiding charge transport losses, and that FFs of up to 84% can be achieved with undoped organic transport layers. The findings allowed us to reach efficiencies under solar AM1.5G conditions of up to 20.4% on small pixels of size 6 mm2. In these devices, the non-ideal recombination properties which manifest as an ideality factor of 1.5, cause a larger FF penalty than inefficient charge extraction, meaning that the Shockley–Queisser limit is within reach provided that non-radiative recombination processes can be further reduced. We, finally, demonstrate the importance of these consideration for upscaling the device area without significant FF losses by fabricating 1 cm2 cells with stabilized efficiencies of 18.9% which not only is the highest efficiency obtained for p–i–n perovskite cells to date, but also the highest value reported for a hybrid perovskite device with dopant-free charge transport layers.
Device architecture and photovoltaic performance
Our triple cation perovskite solar cells are based on the previously reported mixture of lead compounds (PbI2 and PbBr2) and three cation salts, namely methylammonium bromide (MABr), formamidinium iodide (FAI) and cesium iodide (CsI) with the composition (CsPbI3)0.05[(FAPbI3)0.83(MAPbBr3)0.17]0.95.17 We chose the fullerene C60 for the ETL, as this material proved to have excellent electron-extraction properties in all-organic and hybrid solar cells. There is a wide selection of organic hole transporting materials but to keep things simple we focused our study on poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), as this polymer can be coated into thin and homogeneous layers from solution, and it is highly hole-selective.11,22 While PTAA and the perovskite were spin coated, the C60 layer was evaporated along with the top contact, consisting of bathocuproine (BCP, 8 nm) and copper (Cu, 100 nm).23,24 Details of the fabrication process are presented in the Methods section. The chemical structures, energy levels and position of these materials in the devices are shown in Fig. 1a, while Fig. 1b displays a top-view SEM image of the final perovskite layer on glass/PTAA and Fig. 1c shows the cross-section of a device. The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra are shown in Fig. 1Sa, ESI.† We also measured the transient PL of a triple cation perovskite film on glass which shows a long lifetime of 485 ns (Fig. S1b, ESI†). This corresponds well to the lifetimes previously reported for the triple cation perovskite of 470 ns,8 which indicates a high quality active layer with low defect density.

Also shown is the corresponding energy diagram based on previously measured values using ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy, and the film absorption of PTAA.21 (b) Top view SEM image of a perovskite layer on a glass|ITO|PTAA substrate. (c) Cross-section SEM image of the full device stack with the hole-transporting polymer layer prepared from a 1.5 mg mL−1 PTAA solution in toluene and a 20 nm evaporated C60 electron-transporting layer. 

Fig. 2a shows the current density versus voltage (JV) scans of the devices with varying PTAA layer thicknesses measured at a scan rate of 160 mV s−1 from forward to reverse bias (1.2 V → −0.2 V). To vary the thickness of the hole transport layer, the PTAA was spuncast from toluene solutions of different concentrations: 6 mg mL−1 (resulting in a 22 nm thick layer on a glass substrate as obtained from atomic force microscopy), 3 mg mL−1 (12 nm), 1.5 mg mL−1 (8 nm), 1.0 mg mL−1 and 0.5 mg mL−1 while the ETL was kept constant at 20 nm. Importantly, the PTAA layer thickness is essentially unchanged by the perovskite precursor solution as shown in Fig. 2S, ESI.† Analogous thickness variations of the electron transport layer (14 nm, 20 nm, 40 nm) resulted in small variations of the photovoltaic performance with 20 nm and 40 nm C60 delivering the optimum results (Fig. 3S, ESI†). Remarkably, upon decreasing the PTAA layer concentration from 6 mg mL−1 the fill factor continuously increased from an average of 65.0% up to 82.1% (84% max), which well approaches the published record values of 85%25 and 87% with doped CTLs.26 Interestingly, a similar trend between the FF and the HTL thickness has been previously reported for n–i–p perovskite solar cells with spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer,27 although much lower FF values were obtained. Fig. 2b shows that the VOC stays almost constant in a PTAA concentration range of 6 mg mL−1 to 1.5 mg mL−1; however, it drops sharply upon further reducing the PTAA concentration. As the HTL-free perovskite solar cells suffer from poor open-circuit voltages, we expect that spin coating from a very dilute PTAA solution results in an incomplete coverage of ITO, allowing for direct contact of the perovskite with the ITO electrode, which is much less selective. This conclusion is consistent with the dark JV-characteristics which display a significantly higher dark current in the device without or with 0.5 mg mL−1 PTAA (Fig. 4S, ESI†). The highest efficiencies were realized with the PTAA HTL coated from a 1.5 mg mL−1 solution, which we found to be the optimum compromise between a high FF and a low open-circuit voltage loss. These devices had on average a FF of nearly 80% and a VOC of 1.07 V, yielding an average PCE of 18.8% and a record efficiency of 19.7%. Notably, such values were achieved with only 8 nm thick HTLs, meaning that these polymer layers must be highly selective and homogeneous despite their small thickness.
 Fig. 2  (a) Average current-density versus voltage characteristics of triple cation perovskite solar cells with varying thickness of the hole transport layer from undoped PTAA. Reducing the PTAA concentration from 6 mg mL−1 to 0.5 mg mL−1 allows for significant improvements in fill factor (FF) up to 84% (b). However, large open-circuit voltage (VOC) losses at PTAA concentrations below 1.5 mg mL−1 counteract further improvements in the fill factor. Plotted are average FF and VOC values as shown in Table 1. Therefore, the optimum performance is reached at a PTAA concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 (∼8 nm) (c). In combination with a thin layer of polystyrene (PS) to block the reverse diffusion of holes to the cathode enabled efficiencies over 20%. The studied devices also exhibit excellent irradiation stability (d). Exemplified is the power conversion efficiency of a device spuncast from 6 mg mL−1 PTAA which was held for 1 week at the maximum power point under 1 Sun equivalent white LED irradiation in a glovebox.

Our measurement of the radiative electroluminescence efficiency (EQEEL) revealed a value of ca. 4 × 10−4 at an injection current density equal to the JSC value as shown in Fig. 5S, ESI.† This rather low EQEEL indicates significant open-circuit voltage losses due to non-radiative recombination. We succeeded in pushing the VOC value further to 1.11 V by inserting a very thin layer (a few nm) of polystyrene (PS) between the perovskite and the C60 layer,22 while keeping the FF and short-circuit current density constant. Following the conclusions from recent work, we attribute the improved VOC to a reduced perovskite/C60 interface-mediated recombination.21 In combination with an optimized PTAA layer thickness, this resulted in champion small pixel devices with a PCE of 20.4% and an average PCE of 19.9%. Also, with a HTL thickness of 8 nm and only 20 nm C60, these devices consist almost entirely of the active perovskite material. Despite this fact, the devices were stable and exhibited no hysteresis or scan-rate dependent behaviour (Fig. 6S, ESI†) in contrast to many previous studies.28,29 We also found a close match between PCEs obtained from JV scans and stabilized values under maximum power point (MPP) tracking (Fig. 7S, ESI†). We note here that the integrated product of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum and the AM1.5G solar spectrum provided a short-circuit current that is typically 5% lower than that obtained from JV scans under simulated AM1.5G illumination (Fig. 8S, ESI†). Therefore, despite the fact that all of our JV measurements were performed on a recently calibrated solar simulator (see the Experimental section), we can presently not rule out a 5% overestimation of our current density. Not withstanding this point, we note that our maximum currents (22.8 mA cm−2) compare well to average currents reported for triple cation perovskite cells (22.7 mA cm−2ref. 26 and 22.6 mA cm−2ref. 7) and that maximum currents above 23 mA cm−2, and 24 mA cm−2 have been shown in these studies, respectively. Fig. 2d presents the long-term temporal evolution of the maximum power output of a device with 6 mg mL−1 PTAA under 1 Sun equivalent white LED irradiation in a glovebox. The power conversion efficiency stayed almost constant within one week, which demonstrates the stability of the triple cation perovskite solar cells in line with the findings by Saliba et al.17
As an important conclusion from the above results, a reduction of the HTL thickness of our devices leads to a significant improvement of the device performance, and this improvement comes mainly from an increase in the FF. As the free charge generation in the active perovskite layer is seemingly independent of the electric field given the very small exciton binding energy,30 any change in the fill factor must be caused by an altered balance between free charge recombination and extraction. In the following sections we aim to disentangle the relative contributions from charge transport and non-radiative recombination to the fill factor losses.
Non-radiative recombination losses at VOC
In order to disentangle the charge transport losses from the non-radiative recombination losses we applied the VOCversus suns technique, which is a suitable tool to disentangle the true ideality factor from the series resistance and transport limitations.31 Due to the linear relation between JSC and the light intensity (as we show below) we plot in Fig. 3aVOCversus JSC. The graph shows that the dependence of VOC follows the Shockley equation with an ideality factor nID of 1.5 across 3 orders of magnitude for all cells regardless of the PTAA thicknesses. This proves the identical recombination kinetics of the cells at VOC, while the differences in VOC values at a given light intensity show that JG,0 varies among the cells due to their different non-radiative recombination currents. Using the FF approximation formula from Green10 (1)we can calculate the FF potential of the cells that could be reached if no additional charge transport losses were present as shown in Fig. 3b. This suggests that the distinct changes in FF of the cells are related to their different charge extraction properties.
 Fig. 3  (a) Open-circuit voltage vs. short-circuit current density (VOCvs. JSC) for the cells with varying PTAA concentration. The slope of the VOCversus log(JSC) plot allows quantifying the true ideality factor nID without series resistance limitations. For all cells we obtain an nID of 1.5 across 3 orders of magnitude, which demonstrates the identical recombination dynamic at VOC. (b) Knowing nID of our cells allows decoupling the FF limitations of our cells into non-radiative losses and charge transport losses using eqn (1). The identical ideality factor of the cells manifest in similar non-radiative FF losses, which indicates that the FF difference of the studied cells is related to their different charge transport properties. We note that the slightly increased non-radiative FF loss at a PTAA concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 is due to the significantly lower VOC of these cells. An upper VOC limit of 1.3 V was assumed to calculate the radiative FF limit. 
Speed of charge extraction
We investigated the charge transport in the complete functional solar cells by employing integrated time of flight (iTOF). This method has been shown to be a useful tool to study the dynamics of charge extraction in operational cells.19,20Fig. 4a presents a sketch of the measurement setup. In this experiment, the device is illuminated by a short laser pulse (5 ns, 532 nm) and the transient photovoltage is recorded across a large external resistor using an oscilloscope. In the limit that the external resistor discharges the device more slowly than the transit time of the slower carrier, the transient photovoltage signal maps the motion of the photogenerated carriers towards the electrodes, and it saturates when all carriers have been extracted from the multilayer stack. Fig. 4b shows such transient signals for devices with varying PTAA thicknesses at a fluence of roughly 80–100 nJ cm−2 producing a maximum photovoltage (U) of 300 mV (and the same amount of photogenerated charge of CU, given the similar total capacitances of these devices). Under these illumination conditions, the transients reveal a significant slow-down of charge carrier extraction, by 1–2 orders of magnitude, upon increasing the PTAA thickness. Given that the thickness of the perovskite and C60 layer was identical among all devices, these results indicate that the hole transport in the PTAA layer plays a decisive role in determining the response time of the entire device. In accordance with this interpretation, the integral transients measured on a device without the PTAA but with the ETL saturate within a few tens of nanoseconds, which is at the temporal response limit of our setup (Fig. 9S, ESI†). In contrast, another perovskite device without the C60/BCP layer shows, again, slow extraction times in the μs range. The important conclusion is that the transit times through both the photoactive perovskite and the C60 electron-transporting layer are too fast to measure with the current setup; consistent with the reported mobility values for perovskite (μ ∼ 10 cm2 V−1 s−1)1 and C60 in a diode structure (2 × 10−3–0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1).32,33 In other words, even an undoped 20 nm thick C60 layer provides sufficient transport capability to guarantee fast extraction without limiting the FF. On the other hand, the slow charge extraction from cells with PTAA is consistent with the much smaller hole mobility in PTAA (μ ∼ 10−5 cm2 V−1 s-1) as previously determined using TOF measurements on much thicker films (μm).34 Notably, the iTOF transients were found to be independent of the choice of the excitation wavelength, proving the charge collection time to be independent of the charge carrier distribution profile in the perovskite film (Fig. 10S, ESI†). This is consistent with the expectation that the triple cation perovskite layer exhibits mobilities far higher than the organic layers, and, therefore, the average distance the photogenerated carriers have to travel through the perovskite to the transport layers is not limiting the kinetics of charge collection. Lastly, we note that the transients exhibit a certain fluence dependence with shorter transit times at lower fluences; however, the trend that thicker PTAA layers cause a longer charge extraction time is seen for all fluences (Fig. 11S, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  (a) Schematic of the integral time of flight (iTOF) setup. A load resistance of 1 MΩ leads to a large resistance–capacitance (RC) time of the circuit. Therefore, after charge carriers reach the electrodes they will remain on the electrodes, and consequently the saturation of the photovoltage signal indicates the transit of all carriers though the whole device. (b) Normalized transient signals for triple cation perovskite devices with different hole transport layer thicknesses recorded with a load resistance of 1 MΩ under the same laser fluence (80–100 nJ cm−2) producing the same photovoltage (U) of 300 mV. The saturation of the transients reveals that all photogenerated charges have reached the contacts. The graph shows that the transit time decreases by reducing the PTAA layer thickness, which is the reason for the observed enhancement of the FF. 
Charge transport losses in the steady state
The above data prove that it is the speed of hole extraction which limits the FF of our devices. All of our devices exhibit an ideality factor of 1.5 as obtained from the VOC–suns method, and the efficiency of charge generation in the active perovskite is seemingly independent of the field and illumination intensity. Therefore, the HTL thickness affects the FF only through extra free charge recombination as a consequence of the rather slow hole extraction. This motivated us to investigate how the HTL thickness affects the magnitude and order of the steady-state recombination over a wide range of illumination intensities, using intensity dependent photocurrent measurements (IPC). IPC is a powerful technique to quantify photocurrent losses under steady-state operation in operational solar cells.35,36 In this experiment the sample is kept at a constant (forward) bias and the steady-state photogenerated current (Jph, i.e. the current under illumination corrected for the dark current) is recorded for increasing illumination intensities. As an example, we show in Fig. 12S (ESI†) a perfectly linear increase of the short circuit photocurrent with laser power, with a relative variation of the external quantum efficiency EQE of only 1% over 6 orders of magnitude in intensity. This demonstrates the unprecedented precision of our setup. In order to quantify the recombination losses under conditions similar to 1 Sun illumination we define the 1 Sun equivalent laser power (at the used excitation wavelength of 445 nm) where the solar cell current density output matches JSC under AM1.5G irradiation. We note that JV-curves obtained at different laser wavelengths and 1 Sun equivalent laser powers vary slightly, but these differences are small (Fig. 13S, ESI†).
The results of IPC measurements spanning an intensity range from 10−3 to 10 × 1 Sun equivalents and a voltage range from short-circuit to near VOC are presented in Fig. 5a and b for solar cells fabricated from 6 mg mL−1 and 1.5 mg mL−1 PTAA, respectively. Under short-circuit conditions, both devices show a linear relation between current and intensity (equivalently a constant EQE) up to the maximum available laser power at 10 equivalent suns. This shows the absence of recombination losses of higher order in intensity under short-circuit conditions throughout the entire intensity range studied here35 and also underlines the potential of these cells in concentrators or photodetectors. With increasing forward bias, the EQE becomes progressively reduced, due to recombination of photogenerated charges, and also it becomes dependent on the light intensity. With the EQE being available over a wide range of intensities, the total photocurrent loss at a given bias and illumination intensity can be subdivided into a contribution which is linear in intensity, seen as an intensity independent decrease of the EQE with increasing bias, and a nonlinear recombination loss leading to a downward bend of the EQE with increasing intensity. In combination with the dark current, which includes radiative and non-radiative recombination losses, these recombination losses reproduce well the shape of the JV-characteristics of both devices, as shown in Fig. 5c and d.
 Fig. 5  Intensity dependent external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in the steady state at different applied voltages, derived from intensity dependent photocurrent (IPC) measurements, for the device fabricated from a PTAA concentration of (a) 6 mg mL−1, and (b) 1.5 mg mL−1. The EQE has been normalized to 100% at short-circuit for clarity and the 1 Sun equivalent laser power is marked by the orange dotted line. The trend of the EQEs displays two features: First, recombination losses that are of first-order in light intensity are observed from the (parallel) shift of the constant EQE value at low intensities and higher voltages close to VOC (starting at 0.9 V and 1 V for the devices with 6 mg mL−1 and 1.5 mg mL−1 PTAA, respectively). Second, the deviation from the constant EQE marks the intensity-regime where recombination losses of higher order in intensity become comparable to the extraction rate. Comparing (a) and (b) shows that the device from 1.5 mg mL−1 PTAA is not limited by higher order recombination losses – a result of the improved transport through the hole contact. The EQE at 1 Sun can be read-off at each voltage and compared with the current-density vs. voltage (JV) characteristics as shown in (c) for the device fabricated from 6 mg mL−1 PTAA and (d) 1.5 mg mL−1. The comparison with the AM1.5G JV-curves shows reasonable agreement with the photocurrent obtained from the IPC method. 
Importantly, we could explain both the JV-characteristics and the key features of the IPC data with the modified Shockley equation (2)which includes a voltage drop over an ohmic series resistance Rs. Using the measured nID of 1.5, the best fit to the data yields Rs = 8 Ω cm2 and 1.5 Ω cm2 for PTAA coated from 6 mg mL−1 and 1.5 mg mL−1 solutions, respectively, as shown in Fig. 14S, ESI.† These simulations reveal that both first and higher-order recombination losses are an immanent effect of the finite series resistance in the power generating regime. This is in contrast to the conventional view that different orders of photocurrent losses correspond to distinctly different physical processes.1 For example, first-order losses are often explained by trap-assisted recombination or the recombination of photogenerated carriers with background charge, while higher-order recombination losses are assigned to bimolecular recombination of free charges at intermediate charge densities and Auger-type third-order recombination losses at very high carrier densities.14 The IPC results however show that the recombination order in the power generating JV-regime depends on the interplay between the dark (JD) and the generation current (JG) densities, as well as the series resistance (see the ESI†). Nevertheless, the fact that the PTAA HTL can be approximated by an ohmic resistance is quite surprising given the fact that the polymer is nominally undoped. We speculate that a certain background hole density is established in the thin HTL either through weak p-doping of the perovskite,37 or through remote doping by the contact.38 A more detailed examination of the IPC results reveals further important differences between the two devices. Both exhibit linear and non-linear losses in the IPC data, but these are much less pronounced for the device fabricated from 1.5 mg mL−1 PTAA. Importantly, for these devices, higher-order recombination losses are essentially absent under 1 Sun conditions and below, while they constitute a major loss channel in the device with the thicker PTAA layer. Higher-order recombination losses are particularly harmful for the device, as they progressively deteriorate the device performance with increasing illumination intensity.
It can be shown that such nonlinear losses come into play when Rs2JDJph becomes comparable to (nIDkBT/e)2 (see the ESI†). This highlights the importance of keeping the series resistance as small as possible. In fact, for the devices from 6 mg mL−1 PTAA, half of the fill factor loss originates from such higher order recombination as shown in Fig. 5c. On the other hand, the FF of our highest efficiency solar cells suffers only from pseudo-first order recombination (Fig. 5d) which is caused by the non-ideal dark current due to the finite series resistance according to EQE(V) ≈ JD(V)/JD,Rs=0(V) as discussed in the ESI,† and Fig. 14S (ESI†). Thus, these pseudo first-order recombination losses are unavoidable as long as hole extraction through the PTAA layer is inefficient. Importantly, these losses are finally overcome in cells with even thinner HTL layers (coated from 0.5 mg mL−1), where we achieved fill factors of up to 84%. The important conclusion is that the fill factor in these cells is no longer limited by insufficient charge extraction, but by non-radiative recombination processes. This is consistent with the measured ideality factor of 1.5, which allows a maximum fill factor of 84% considering a VOC of 0.99 V as measured for the cell with record fill factor (as shown in Table 1).
Large area cells
Knowing how to minimize the detrimental effect of charge transport losses on the fill factor is an important consideration for upscaling the electrode area without significant efficiency losses. As shown in Fig. 6, we succeeded in upscaling the electrode area from 6 mm2 to 1 cm2 using the optimum PTAA concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 while maintaining a high FF of 77.1% (compared to an average of 79.8% on the 6 mm2 cell), and VOC of 1.072 V (compared to an average of 1.07 V) and a stabilized PCE of 18.9%, which is identical to the average performance of the 6 mm2 cells (18.8%). Compared to previously reported record large area hybrid perovskite devices with dopant-free transport layers and efficiencies of 12.4%39 (where the authors used PCDTBT and PCBM as CTLs on 2 cm2 cells) our cells exhibit by far higher efficiencies. This is currently also the highest efficiency reported for 1 cm2 cells in the p–i–n architecture (compared to 18.2%).40 Notably our dopant-free cells approach the record efficiencies reported in n–i–p configurations with TiO2 as the electron transport layer (e.g. 19.0%6 on 0.5 cm2 and 19.5%8 on 1 cm2). We emphasise that those cells employed doped charge transport layers and (except for the cells reported in ref. 8) underwent high temperature treatments (around 500 °C).6,40 In contrast, the architecture of our cells is very simple, scalable and does not require high-temperature treatment or CTL doping. We prove that exceptional high efficiency and stable devices are possible using only 8 nm of PTAA and 20 nm C60 as CTLs. Again, we note that the integrated EQE – solar spectrum product of 21.9 mA cm−2 matches the obtained short-circuit currents within an error of ±5% (Fig. 15Sa, ESI†). To further confirm the efficiency we performed another JV scan at an independent laboratory (see the ESI†). This measurement, performed on a ca. 4 week old device, yielded an efficiency of 18.4% with a high FF of 77.9%, VOC of 1.09 V, and JSC of 21.65 mA cm−2 (Fig. 15Sb, ESI†).

Conclusions
This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms determining the FF in efficient triple perovskite cells with all-organic transport layers. Transient photoconductivity measurements reveal that, under relevant illumination and biasing conditions, rather slow extraction of holes through the polymeric PTAA hole transport layer creates the main bottleneck for efficient charge collection in our devices. By employing light intensity dependent photocurrent measurements we show that inefficient charge collection induces first and higher order recombination losses under steady-state conditions, and how these losses depend on the thickness of the HTL. Guided by these findings, we fabricated stable dopant-free hybrid perovskite devices surpassing a PCE of 20% for an active area of 6 mm2. Notably, upon optimizing the electrode layout, significantly larger cells with 1 cm2 area and a record PCE of 18.9% were realized. This is the highest PCE for a p–i–n perovskite solar cell of similar size and the highest value ever reported for a large area dopant-free perovskite device. Our results prove that highly efficient and stable devices are feasible with ultrathin undoped organic transport layers in which the active perovskite fills nearly 95% of the cell volume, and that further fill factor improvements will be possible by employing higher mobility HTLs. In such devices, the fill factor will become primarily limited by a non-ideal nID and the non-radiative VOC loss, rendering the understanding of the causes of non-radiative recombination in these devices inevitable to approach the Shockley–Queisser FF limit.
Methods
Device preparation
Patterned indium-doped tin oxide (ITO, Lumtec, 15 ohm sqr.−1) was washed successively with acetone, Hellmanex III, DI-water and isopropyl alcohol. After a brief microwave plasma treatment (4 min at 200 W) poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA, Sigma-Aldrich, Mn = 7000–10000, PDI = 2–2.2) was spin-coated in varying concentrations (0.5–6 mg mL−1 in toluene) at 6000 rpm for 30 seconds, annealed for 10 minutes at 100 °C and cooled for 5 minutes. The perovskite precursor is based on the recipe by Saliba et al.17 Briefly, the perovskite (CsPbI0.05[(FAPbI3)0.83(MAPbBr3)0.17]0.95 layer was formed by spin coating from DMF:DMSO solution (4:1 by volume) at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds (480 μL of a FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) solution and 20 μL of a CsI (1.5M) solution). After 10 seconds of spin coating, the substrates were washed with 500 μL of diethyl ether (antisolvent). Subsequently the substrates were annealed at 80 °C for 1 min and 100 °C for 1 h. The samples were transferred to an evaporation chamber and C60 (20 nm, unless specified otherwise), BCP (8 nm) and copper (100 nm) were deposited under vacuum (p = 10−7 mbar). The active area was 6 mm2 (or 1 cm2 where noted) defined as the overlap of ITO and the top electrode.
Current density–voltage characteristics

JV curves were obtained in a 2-wire configuration on a Keithley 2400 system. A filtered Oriel class AAA Xenon lamp was used for illumination providing approximately 100 mW cm−2 of AM1.5G irradiation and the intensity was monitored simultaneously using a Si photodiode. The exact illumination intensity was used for efficiency calculations, and the simulator was calibrated with a KG5 filtered silicon solar cell (certified by Fraunhofer ISE). A spectral mismatch calculation was performed based on the spectral irradiance of the solar simulator, the EQE of the reference silicon solar cell and 3 typical EQEs of our cells. This resulted in 3 mismatch factors of M = 0.9949, 0.9996 and 0.9976. Given the very small deviation from unity the measured JSC was not corrected by the factor 1/M. The AM1.5G short-circuit current of devices matched the integrated product of the EQE spectrum within 5% error. The latter was recorded using a Philips Projection Lamp (Type7724 12 V 100 W) in front of a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 74100) and the light was mechanically chopped at 40 Hz. The photo-generated current was measured using a lock-in-amplifier (EG&G Princeton Applied Research Model 5302, integration times 300 ms–10 s) and evaluated after calibrating the lamp spectrum with an UV-enhanced Si photodetector (Newport).
Light intensity dependent measurements
Steady-state intensity dependent photocurrent and VOC measurements were performed with a 445 nm continuous wave laser (Insaneware) providing a power of 1 W. Two continuously variable neutral density filter wheels (ThorLabs) were used to attenuate the laser power. The photocurrent transients were recorded on a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. In order to measure the IPC at the specified voltages in forward bias we ensured a stabilized dark current, after typically tens of seconds (we note that the stabilization time increased with increasing forward bias). The IPC responses in forward bias were then corrected by subtracting the dark (injection) current after the dark current stabilized. Each measured data point corresponds to a steady-state photocurrent measurement at the respective incident laser power and the steady-state conditions were ensured by recording the temporal evolution of the photocurrent. We note that the photocurrent response is usually stable within 1 second. The current output of a silicon photodetector was simultaneously measured (Keithley 485) as a reference of the laser power to improve the accuracy of the measurement. The EQE was obtained from the ratio of the photocurrent and the current output of the Si photodiode. In the VOC–suns measurements we observe that the VOC saturates to a maximum value at intensities ≫ 1 Sun.
Integrated time of flight
Photovoltage transients were recorded using an oscilloscope (Agilent 81150A) at different external load resistances (RLoad) ranging up to 1 MΩ. RLoad was varied in order to check the saturation of the maximum photovoltage with increasing load resistance – a requirement to correctly estimate the transit time.19 All transients exhibit a saturated maximum photovoltage at 1 MΩ. A Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (NT242, EKSPLA)) with a pulse length of 5 ns and excitation wavelength of 532 nm was used to generate the charge carriers, while neutral optical density (OD) filters were used to attenuate the power output. The laser fluence was varied (resulting in photovoltages between 50 mV and 400 mV at an RLoad of 1 MΩ) but kept significantly below the open-circuit voltage to avoid significant field screening effects. The measurements were performed at a repetition rate of 10 Hz and showed no difference when compared with the single shot transients.

Broader context
Due to their simple fabrication, perovskite solar cells attract enormous attention for photovoltaic applications. However, today's best performing perovskite cells employ inorganic oxide layers which often require high temperature treatments. Moreover, chemical doping of transport layers is required to boost the conductivities for efficient charge extraction. While doping has been linked to accelerated device degradation, it also complicates the solution preparation and layer formation. In this work we visualized the extraction of charge carriers to the electrodes in operational, highly efficient p–i–n type cells with all-organic undoped transport layers. Thereby, we identified the carrier transit time through the organic hole transport layer as the bottleneck for efficient charge extraction. The findings allowed us to fabricate stable devices employing ultrathin undoped transport layers in which the active perovskite fills nearly 95% of the cell volume. Exceptional fill factors up to 84% were realized with efficiencies beyond 20%. We also demonstrate that our device architecture is fully scalable without appreciable efficiency losses when the device area is increased from 6 mm2 to 1 cm2 cells. At the same time, we highlight the importance of fundamental non-radiative recombination losses – included in the cells’ ideality factor – that limit the fill factor to its thermodynamic limit.

 	Fig. 2  (a) Average current-density versus voltage characteristics of triple cation perovskite solar cells with varying thickness of the hole transport layer from undoped PTAA. Reducing the PTAA concentration from 6 mg mL−1 to 0.5 mg mL−1 allows for significant improvements in fill factor (FF) up to 84% (b). However, large open-circuit voltage (VOC) losses at PTAA concentrations below 1.5 mg mL−1 counteract further improvements in the fill factor. Plotted are average FF and VOC values as shown in Table 1. Therefore, the optimum performance is reached at a PTAA concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 (∼8 nm) (c). In combination with a thin layer of polystyrene (PS) to block the reverse diffusion of holes to the cathode enabled efficiencies over 20%. The studied devices also exhibit excellent irradiation stability (d). Exemplified is the power conversion efficiency of a device spuncast from 6 mg mL−1 PTAA which was held for 1 week at the maximum power point under 1 Sun equivalent white LED irradiation in a glovebox.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Open-circuit voltage vs. short-circuit current density (VOCvs. JSC) for the cells with varying PTAA concentration. The slope of the VOCversus log(JSC) plot allows quantifying the true ideality factor nID without series resistance limitations. For all cells we obtain an nID of 1.5 across 3 orders of magnitude, which demonstrates the identical recombination dynamic at VOC. (b) Knowing nID of our cells allows decoupling the FF limitations of our cells into non-radiative losses and charge transport losses using eqn (1). The identical ideality factor of the cells manifest in similar non-radiative FF losses, which indicates that the FF difference of the studied cells is related to their different charge transport properties. We note that the slightly increased non-radiative FF loss at a PTAA concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 is due to the significantly lower VOC of these cells. An upper VOC limit of 1.3 V was assumed to calculate the radiative FF limit.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic of the integral time of flight (iTOF) setup. A load resistance of 1 MΩ leads to a large resistance–capacitance (RC) time of the circuit. Therefore, after charge carriers reach the electrodes they will remain on the electrodes, and consequently the saturation of the photovoltage signal indicates the transit of all carriers though the whole device. (b) Normalized transient signals for triple cation perovskite devices with different hole transport layer thicknesses recorded with a load resistance of 1 MΩ under the same laser fluence (80–100 nJ cm−2) producing the same photovoltage (U) of 300 mV. The saturation of the transients reveals that all photogenerated charges have reached the contacts. The graph shows that the transit time decreases by reducing the PTAA layer thickness, which is the reason for the observed enhancement of the FF.	 

 	Fig. 5  Intensity dependent external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in the steady state at different applied voltages, derived from intensity dependent photocurrent (IPC) measurements, for the device fabricated from a PTAA concentration of (a) 6 mg mL−1, and (b) 1.5 mg mL−1. The EQE has been normalized to 100% at short-circuit for clarity and the 1 Sun equivalent laser power is marked by the orange dotted line. The trend of the EQEs displays two features: First, recombination losses that are of first-order in light intensity are observed from the (parallel) shift of the constant EQE value at low intensities and higher voltages close to VOC (starting at 0.9 V and 1 V for the devices with 6 mg mL−1 and 1.5 mg mL−1 PTAA, respectively). Second, the deviation from the constant EQE marks the intensity-regime where recombination losses of higher order in intensity become comparable to the extraction rate. Comparing (a) and (b) shows that the device from 1.5 mg mL−1 PTAA is not limited by higher order recombination losses – a result of the improved transport through the hole contact. The EQE at 1 Sun can be read-off at each voltage and compared with the current-density vs. voltage (JV) characteristics as shown in (c) for the device fabricated from 6 mg mL−1 PTAA and (d) 1.5 mg mL−1. The comparison with the AM1.5G JV-curves shows reasonable agreement with the photocurrent obtained from the IPC method.
