Ionic migration comes from the migration of halogen from lattice points to halogen vacancies. Considering the strong built-in potential located at the interface between perovskite and carrier transport layers, here we propose that it is the ionic migration at the interfacial depletion region that dominates device hysteresis. The most effective way to achieve hysteresis-free devices is to passivate ionic migration at the interface rather than within perovskite films. We utilized Cs4SnO4 as a modification layer, which could effectively suppress the defects at the interface and thus eliminate hysteresis, as well as shift the conduction band of perovskite/SnO2 closer and decrease the band misalignment. In addition, the partial diffusion of Cs+ into (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 is beneficial for phase stability toward long-term light illumination. Hence, we believe this paper provides a new understanding about the ionic migration process within perovskite solar cells, and Cs4SnO4 modification is an effective and also general method to overcome the device hysteresis issue.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have seen a rapid increase of power conversion efficiency from 9.7% to 22.7%.1 The high performance of PSCs is attributed to the high extinction coefficient, benign defect tolerance and thus high carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime, as well as bipolar charge transport.2,3 Despite these outstanding properties, both academic and industrial communities are concerned about their poor stability, including moisture, heat, light and electrical field. Among all these sensitive factors, ionic migration, which is induced by an electrical field, is crucial to device stability and practical applications. Bulk perovskite films are both ionic and electronic conductors under an externally applied electrical field.4
There are many studies reporting the origin of ionic migration. The well-established knowledge is that ionic migration comes from the migration of halogen from lattice points to halogen vacancies. Stranks and co-workers recently found that the halogen vacancies mostly locate at the grain boundaries and at the interface between perovskites and other transport layers.5 The ionic migration of perovskites causes the hysteresis effect.6 Researchers have found evidence from fluorescence imaging that diffusion and accumulation of bromide ions occur at the interface.7–9 For halogen vacancy passivation, a valid method is to utilize organic/inorganic molecules to bind with halogen, including pyridine, most recently K+, etc.5,10 However, all these passivation methods were conducted within perovskite films, rendering less effective carrier transport in the film due to the insulating properties of the passivation layers.
In addition, we need to determine which kind of halogen vacancy (at grain boundaries or at the interface) is the most crucial to the hysteresis behavior. According to previous reports,11–13 the built-in potential (Φbi) between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) can reach 0.8–1 V, while the depletion width (W) is 50–150 nm, and then the electrical field in the depletion region is as high as 53–200 kV cm−1. The electrical field within the bulk perovskite films is much lower than that at the interface. Such high electrical field at the interface can cause severe ionic migration in PSCs especially at the interfacial depletion region, and then induce ionic migration within perovskite films. It is probable that the ionic migration at the interface dominates the device hysteresis, thereby resulting in poor stability toward electrical fields. The most effective way to achieve hysteresis-free devices is to passivate ionic migration at the interface rather than within perovskite films.14 Here we experimentally verified the halide ion accumulation effect at the interface, and utilized interface modification to remove the interfacial defects and thereby successfully suppressed the hysteresis effect.
Moreover, for the most successful perovskite compositions for solar cells, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (denoted as FAMA) has a 220 meV deeper conduction band minimum than MAPbI3, and is 300 meV below that of TiO2.15 Such band misalignment may result in the accumulation of photo-generated charges and thus hamper device performance.16,17 In order to ensure fast electron extraction, the conduction band of the ETL should be adjusted accordingly.18,19
Based on the above analysis, we focus on the interface between mixed perovskite and ETLs, aiming to eliminate the halogen migration at this interface and improve the band alignment. We chose Cs4SnO4 as a novel interface modification layer, which has never been reported previously, considering the following reasons: (i) Cs4SnO4 can potentially suppress halogen vacancies due to the presence of oxygen for under-coordinated Pb atoms like PEO, water etc.;20–22 (ii) Cs4SnO4 could allow slight tuning of the band structure of perovskite and SnO2; (iii) FAMA typically exhibits unavoidable phase segregation under illumination,23 and some Cs+ could slightly dope into the A site to reach a more thermodynamically stable phase. Indeed, our experimental results indicated that a Cs4SnO4 modification layer successfully eliminated the hysteresis of PSCs, as well as improving the charge transfer between perovskite and ETL. Moreover, the long-term stability toward illumination and bias voltages have also been greatly improved due to the enhanced phase stability and suppressed ionic migration.
Results and discussion
For the experiments, we selected a device structure of PSCs of FTO/SnO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. SnO2 has demonstrated enhanced charge collection compared to TiO2 and better stability than ZnO. The synthesis is described in detail in the Experimental section; here we summarize the most relevant processes. Cs4SnO4 layer was prepared as follows. Firstly, a sol–gel SnO2 layer on FTO was heated at 100 °C for 1 hour; then after cooling down to room temperature, aqueous cesium acetate (Cs(Ac)) was spin-coated onto the resulting SnO2 films, with sequential annealing at 100 °C for another 0.5 hour. The acetate ions could combine with the residual hydroxyl groups within the SnO2 films to form acetic acid and evaporate out of the films. FAMA perovskite precursor was prepared. Devices fabricated with SnO2/FAMA and Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2/FAMA are denoted as pristine device and Cs4SnO4-modified device, respectively. The schematic device structures are shown in Fig. 1a. Moreover, the XRD characterization of FAMA is shown in Fig. S1,† which shows good crystallization of the perovskite.

(c) O 1s XPS spectra from SnO2 (black) and Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 (purple) films; the inset is Cs 3d core level spectrum from Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 film. 
We conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) to study the composition of the Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 film. GIXRD patterns of SnO2 and Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 films are shown in Fig. 1b, with the peak at a 2θ value of 51.8° being attributed to (211) plane of tetragonal SnO2 (PDF #41-1445). It is hard to distinguish the difference in the XRD patterns due to the broad diffraction peaks. TEM images in Fig. S2† show the structure of pure SnO2 films, with lattice spacing of 3.4 Å and 2.6 Å, which were attributed to (110) and (101) crystal planes of SnO2, consistent with our previous paper.24 For the Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 film (inset of Fig. 1b), we could clearly observe a lattice spacing of 3.2 Å, which agrees well with the (121) crystal planes of monoclinic Cs4SnO4 crystals (PDF #79-1003).
For XPS spectra (Fig. 1c), the pristine SnO2 film shows the O 1s orbital peak at 530.8 eV, which is consistent with previous reports.25 For the Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 film, the Cs 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbitals show peaks at 724.0 and 738.0 eV (inset of Fig. 1b), which verifies the presence of oxidation state Cs+.26,27 In addition, the O 1s peak shifts to 530.4 eV (Fig. 1c), which was speculated as strongly ionic compound cesium oxide.26,28 Hence, we speculate that Cs(Ac) will decompose into Cs2O. The hygroscopic Cs2O could rapidly react with moisture to form cesium hydroxide (CsOH), and then react with SnO2 to form cesium stannate (Cs4SnO4).29
As shown in the insets of Fig. 2, the square of the absorption energy as a function of photon energy, the optical bandgaps of SnO2 and Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 are 4.13 and 4.05 eV, respectively. UV photoelectron spectrometry was used to calculate the work function (WF), valance band maximum (Evb) and conduction band (Ecb) of SnO2 and Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 films, FAMA and Cs4SnO4-modified FAMA, as shown in Fig. 2. Evb was calculated as −8.35 eV for SnO2, and −8.30 eV for Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2. Ecb was then derived as −4.22 eV for SnO2, and −4.25 eV for Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2. We believe the change of band energy levels is due to the presence of Cs4SnO4 at the interface. The band alignments of the device are shown in the insets of Fig. 2. The band misalignment between perovskite and SnO2 is 60 meV, while on Cs4SnO4 and Cs+ modification, the deficit was eliminated: Ecb of FAMA upshifted by 30 meV (it was proved that Cs+ can dope into FAMA, Fig. 3); Ecb of Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 downshifted by 30 meV. The energy band parameters are summarized in Table 1. Thereby the electron extraction at this interface was greatly improved after Cs4SnO4/Cs+ modification.

Since Cs+ can easily dope into FAMA perovskite to form a more thermodynamically stable phase, we need to study whether Cs+ species can also diffuse into the perovskite phase. A Cs0.06FA0.8MA0.14Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (denoted as bulk CsFAMA) device was also fabricated in order to evaluate the differences with the Cs4SnO4-modified device. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) is a sensitive technique for the detection of traceable elements or groups,30 and it has been proven to well characterize perovskite-based devices.31 Here the depth profiles of Au+, Pb+, Cs+, I, C+, CH3+, Sn+, NH4+ and Br+ were investigated by ToF-SIMS. The spatially resolved elemental maps were obtained by using an oxygen beam. We labeled depth profiles of different layers according to the intensity of ion counts, as shown in Fig. 3. The Au+ ion trace is indicative of the top electrode. C+ comes from the spiro-MeOTAD hole transport layer. The I, Pb+, NH4+ and CH3+ ions come from the perovskite layer, and Sn+ is from the ETL and FTO electrode. For the Cs4SnO4-modified device (Fig. 3b), the accumulation of Cs+ at the interface between perovskite and SnO2 was clearly observed, verifying the presence of an interfacial Cs4SnO4 layer. In addition, Cs+ ions also diffuse into bulk perovskite to some degree. As for the CsFAMA device (Fig. 3c), Cs+, Pb+, and I all exhibited a similar intensity trend, which confirmed the uniform distribution of Cs+, Pb+, and I within the perovskite bulk.
To investigate the influence of Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 on the defects of the perovskite, we recorded the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of glass/SnO2/perovskite and glass/Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2/perovskite. The PL intensity was normalized, as shown in Fig. 4. There are three processes dominating charge-carrier recombination in perovskite: Auger recombination, trap-related non-radiative recombination and radiative recombination.32 It should be emphasized that the time-dependent PL intensity exhibits three exponential decays which suggests two non-radiative decays (Auger and carrier trapping recombination) and one radiative decay are responsible for the PL intensity reduction. The carrier lifetimes for the different perovskite films were obtained by fitting the PL decay spectra using a three-exponential equation:33,34 (1)where τi is the 1/e lifetime constant and Ai is the amplitude for each exponential component. Amplitude-weighted average lifetimes were calculated for each fit by taking the contraharmonic mean of each component:34 (2)
 Fig. 4  TRPL spectra of glass/SnO2/perovskite (pristine) and glass/Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2/perovskite. Symbols are measurement results, solid lines are three-exponential decay fitting. As depicted in Fig. S4,† SEM image shows that the thickness of the perovskite layer is ∼700 nm. 
A summary of the parameters for the TRPL measurements is presented in the inset table of Fig. 4. The average PL lifetimes of perovskite and Cs+-modified FAMA were calculated to be 4.84 ns and 11.62 ns, respectively. The enhanced PL indicates that the Auger and carrier trapping recombinations are significantly suppressed through Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2/Cs+-modified FAMA.
Then, we assembled the whole device to study the influence of Cs4SnO4 modification on the ionic migration and performance hysteresis effect. Device performances are shown in Fig. 5. The devices were swept under 1 sun (AM 1.5G) illumination conditions with a rate of 100 mV s−1 with a step of ΔV = 10 mV. The device performances under forward and reverse scans are shown in Table 2. The reverse scan represents the change in voltage from 1.6 to 0 V, denoted as the R scan, and the forward scan is from 0 to 1.6 V, denoted as the F scan. To evaluate the device hysteresis effect, a hysteresis index (Hi) has been defined to describe the differences in J–V curves appearing near open-circuit condition (0.8VOC),35 which is the ratio between the current density measured in reverse (JR) and forward scan (JF) directions: (3)

As shown in Table 2, the pristine device shows an Hi value of 0.10, while the Cs4SnO4-modified device shows a smaller Hi of 0.05. However, it is not straightforward to draw the conclusion that it is the Cs4SnO4 at the interface that suppresses device hysteresis, since some Cs+ diffused into the bulk perovskites. Here we also evaluate the device performance for CsFAMA device (Fig. S8†), in order to exclude the accumulation of Cs+ at the interface between perovskite and SnO2. The device exhibited an Hi value of 0.083 (Table S1†), which is close to that of the pristine device without any Cs+ introduction. In addition, for the CsFAMA device, we found that the film formation kinetics are totally different from those of FAMA perovskites, which could be seen in SEM images (Fig. S3†) in that CsFAMA exhibited much smaller grain sizes compared to FAMA perovskite films. Thereby, we believe it is the Cs4SnO4 at the interface that predominantly eliminates the hysteresis effect. The positive effect of Cs4SnO4-modified device is due to the suppression of defects at the interface between perovskites and ETLs, and then there is no channel for halogen migration. It should be noted that for the Cs4SnO4-modified device, JSC and VOC remained almost unchanged compared to pristine device, but, in contrast, the fill factor was improved from 0.69 (R) and 0.67 (F) for pristine device to 0.73 (R) and 0.70 (F) for Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2-based device. The Cs4SnO4-modified device also exhibited excellent steady-state output of photocurrent and Eff., 20.49 mA cm−2 and 19.26%, respectively (Fig. S6†). In addition, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements (Fig. S7†) are in good accordance with our J–V measurements. Such enhancement was attributed to the improved band alignment between SnO2 and perovskite, since Cs4SnO4 can slightly adjust the conduction band of SnO2 and perovskite so that they are closer to each other. The complete set of photovoltaic parameters of each cell can be found in Tables S2 and S3.†
We have measured the current–voltage (I–V) characteristic of the devices with the structure of FTO/SnO2/interfacial layer/perovskite/Au, and analyzed using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 6), which indicated the presence of a trap-filling region starting at VTFL = 1.58 V, 0.16 V and 0.56 V for pristine FAMA, Cs4SnO4-modified FAMA and bulk CsFAMA, respectively. According to the formula ntrap = 2εVTFL/qL2 (where ε is the dielectric constant of the material (here we use ε = 25.5), ε0 the vacuum permittivity, q the elementary charge and L the length of the solid),2 the trap densities of FAMA, Cs4SnO4-modified FAMA and bulk CsFAMA are 9.1 × 1014, 9.2 × 1013 and 3.2 × 1014 cm−3, respectively. The exceptionally low trap density found in the Cs4SnO4-modified sample is probably due to the presence of oxygen atoms for under-coordinated Pb atoms. Typically, the anions are in short supply at the grain boundaries, and may expose bare Pb atoms. The presence of Cs4SnO4 provides additional oxygen atoms and may enable the formation of Pb–O bonds at the grain boundaries. The passivated grain boundaries are beneficial for trap state suppression. Several studies have claimed that oxygen atoms are effective passivation agents for perovskites, like water, PEO etc.20–22 The decrease of defect density of the Cs4SnO4-modified sample indicates that the “channel” for halogen migration is minimized.
 Fig. 6  Characteristic I–V trace (purple markers) showing three different regimes for (a) pristine FAMA, (b) Cs4SnO4-modified FAMA and (c) bulk CsFAMA at 300 K. A linear ohmic regime (I ∝ V, cyan line) is followed by the trap-filled regime, marked by a steep increase in current (I ∝ Vn, n > 3, green line). 
In addition, we also investigated the long-term photostability and device stability under working conditions. The depth profiles of the pristine and Cs4SnO4-modified devices before and after 15 h photoaging are shown in Fig. 7. After a long-term light illumination, we could clearly observe the decrease of I in the control device, especially at the interface between perovskite and SnO2. Moreover, we compared the ToF-SIMS elemental profiles for Cs4SnO4-modified sample (Fig. 7b) and CsFAMA sample (Fig. 7c) before and after photoaging. It could be easily observed that for the CsFAMA sample, I ions drifted to the interface between perovskite and SnO2, which is due to the presence of halide vacancies at this interface. In contrast, for the Cs4SnO4-modified sample, there are no changes of the halide content, which is due to the absence of halide vacancies and the presence of Cs4SnO4 and thus no ions migrate toward this interface. The depth profiles of Br+ for pristine CsFAMA and Cs4SnO4-modified devices before and after 15 h photoaging are shown in Fig. S5.† Loss of Br− occurred at the interface of the perovskite and ETL. Compared to the loss of Br−, the decrease of I in the control device is more severe (Fig. 7); this means I ions are the species most likely to be released from the perovskite.
 Fig. 7  Normalized ToF-SIMS elemental depth profiles before (grey dotted line) and after 15 h photoaging: (a) pristine, (b) Cs4SnO4-modified, and (c) bulk CsFAMA devices. 
We believe such a decrease is due to the directed migration of halides under built-in electrical fields and then decomposition under light illumination. In contrast, iodine ions at the interface between perovskite and spiro-MeOTAD remained unchanged, indicating that the halide migration mainly occurs at the interface between perovskite and SnO2 rather than between perovskite and spiro-MeOTAD. In a typical PSC, the built-in potential between perovskite and ETL could reach 0.8–1 V, and the depletion region is ∼150 nm,36 leading to an electrical field of over 53 kV cm−1 in the depletion region. Such high electrical field causes severe ionic migration in the depletion region, subsequently inducing the ionic migration within perovskite films (top of Fig. 8a). The use of Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 could effectively suppress the trap states of perovskites at the interface (bottom of Fig. 8a), and then the ionic migration could be successfully removed. As shown in Fig. 7b, iodide content perfectly reserved after light illumination, well supporting our above analysis.

Fig. 8b shows the continuous maximum point (MPP) tacking results of a pristine and a Cs4SnO4-modified device measured in a nitrogen-filled glovebox under continuous AM 1.5 illumination (with a UV filter). The Cs4SnO4-modified device exhibits stabilized efficiency for 40 hours, while the pristine device degrades to 65% of its initial performance within 10 hours. Such good stability after introduction of Cs4SnO4 can be interpreted in terms of the significantly suppressed ionic migration and also the improved phase stability of FAMA. Under illumination, FAMA perovskites would transform to non-perovskite hexagonal δ-phase (“yellow phase”), which was consistent with previous studies.37,38 The presence of Cs4SnO4 enables the trace diffusion of Cs+ into the bulk perovskites (Fig. 3), and Cs+ ions are effective in stabilizing the perovskite phase.38
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate that the interface between perovskite and ETL is crucial to ionic migration and device hysteresis behaviors, due to the presence of halogen vacancies and the high electrical field within the depletion region. By means of a Cs4SnO4 modification layer between perovskite and SnO2, the defects within the perovskite film were effectively suppressed, and thus the ionic migration was also improved. Another role of Cs4SnO4 is that Cs+ could diffuse into (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and then stabilize the perovskite phase. In addition, the use of Cs4SnO4 shifts the conduction band of SnO2 and perovskite closer to each other, decreasing the band misalignment and thus improving the electron extraction process. Hence, we believe this work provides a new understanding about the ionic migration process within PSCs, and that Cs4SnO4 modification is an effective and also general method that can be used to overcome the device hysteresis issue.
Experimental section

All the chemicals were used as received, including PbI2 (99.9985%, Alfa Aesar), MAI, FAI (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), cesium acetate (99.99%, Alfa Aesar), anhydrous cesium iodide (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), SnCl2·2H2O (98–103%, Alfa Aesar), and spiro-OMeTAD (99.7%, Lumtec Co., Taiwan). 4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP, 96%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (99.95%), and solvents of acetonitrile (99.9%), ethanol (99.8%), dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), and chlorobenzene (99.8%) were all purchased from Sigma Aldrich. FTO glasses (FTO, 7 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Yingkou OPVtech New Energy Co. Ltd.
ETL preparation
The synthesis of SnO2 gel has been conducted by our group,39 which is summarized as follows: SnCl2·2H2O solution (0.1 M) was prepared by dissolving SnCl2·2H2O in anhydrous alcohol in a flask. Then the solution was stirred at 80 °C with the neck of the flask sealed to prevent entry of O2 and H2O into the solution for 3 h. To obtain SnO2 organic sol, the just dissolved SnCl2·2H2O solution was transferred to an open reflux apparatus, with refluxing for another 6 h at 40 °C. When the reaction was over, the product was aged for over 24 h at room temperature. To prepare SnO2 ETLs, SnO2 sol was spin-coated on FTO at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then heated at different temperatures for 1.5 h to remove solvent. Then, the as-deposited ETLs were treated with UV-ozone for 30 min. Both pristine and Cs4SnO4-modified devices were made by using blank SnO2 film, while Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 film was made using 4 mM aqueous cesium acetate (CsAc). First, a sol-SnO2 layer on FTO was heated at 100 °C for 1 hour. After cooling down to the room temperature, this layer was subsequently covered with an aqueous CsAc film by spin-coating and then annealed at 100 °C for another 0.5 hour in air. Last, the as-deposited Cs4SnO4-modified ETLs were treated with UV-ozone for 30 min.
Perovskite device fabrication
(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 precursor was synthesized as described by the Hagfeldt group.15 First, an anhydrous mixture of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio is 4:1) containing FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), MABr (0.2 M) and PbBr2 (0.2 M) was prepared firstly by stirring at 70 °C for 2 h. Then, 80 μL solution was spread on the FTO/ETL substrate followed by a two-stage spin-coating process (1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 50 s). During the second spin-coating stage, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the spinning substrate 15 s prior the end of the program. Finally, the perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 40 min, then both pristine and Cs4SnO4-modified film types were obtained. Cs0.06FA0.8MA0.14Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 precursor was synthesized with 1.5 M CsI DMSO solution and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 precursor (volume ratio = 5:95). Cs0.06FA0.8MA0.14Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 is denoted as bulk CsFAMA. (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 film fabricated with bare SnO2 and Cs4SnO4-modified SnO2 is denoted as pristine FAMA and Cs-modified FAMA, respectively.
75 mg mL−1 spiro-OMeTAD (Borun New Material Technology Co. Ltd.), the HTM, was dissolved in chlorobenzene. 28.8 μL of TBP and 17.5 μL of a 520 mg mL−1 LiTFSI solution were added to the OMeTAD solution as additives. The HTM layer was applied onto the perovskite by a 4000 rpm 25 s spin-coating process. The Au (50 nm) electrode was deposited through a shadow mask (3 × 4 mm2) by thermal evaporation.
Characterizations
The TRPL spectra were measured using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrometer by the time correlated single photon counting technique. An EPL 460 nm pulsed diode laser was used for excitation with repetition rates at 10 MHz. The maximum average power was 5 mW and all samples were measured at the same intensity. The emission wavelength was set at 765 nm. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured with a Keithley 2400 digital source meter at a scan speed of 100 mV s−1. The simulated AM 1.5G sunlight with an irradiance equivalent to 100 mW cm−2 was generated by a Oriel Solar 3A solar simulator and the intensity was calibrated with a VLSI standards-incorporated PN 91150V Si reference cell. The cells were masked using a black metal mask with a hole area of 0.096 cm2. Steady-state output of photocurrent and PCE were measured with a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under a certain bias. The IPCE spectra were recorded by a setup consisting of a xenon light source, a monochromator, and a potentiostat. The crystal structures of ETLs were characterized using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer. TEM and HRTEM analysis was carried out with a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope. Samples for analysis were obtained by sonicating the peeled-off SnO2 into ethanol, and then drop-casting the solution onto carbon-coated copper TEM grids at room temperature. SEM images were acquired with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7401F). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded via an HPX-2000 (Ocean Optics). XPS measurements were performed with equipment made in the UK (ESCALAB 250Xi). The ToF-SIMS measurements (model TOF-SIMS 5-100, ION-TOF GmbH) were performed with pulsed primary ions from a O2+ (1 keV) ion gun for the sputtering and a Bi+ pulsed primary ion beam for the analysis (30 keV). UPS characterizations were performed with monochromatized HeI radiation at 21.22 eV. The space-charge-limited current as a function of the applied voltage was measured using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter, using an ETL/perovskite/Au structure. The samples (blank FAMA, Cs4SnO4-modified FAMA or bulk CsFAMA) were measured in a dark environment at 300 K.
