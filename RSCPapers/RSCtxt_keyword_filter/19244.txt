    , Accepted 17th June 2019First published on 20th June 2019AbstractIn recent years, non-fullerene acceptors, especially fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), have been successfully applied to develop high-performance bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). FREAs are typically composed of two strongly electron-withdrawing end groups connected by a planar fused-ring core. Through variation of the fused-ring core and electron-withdrawing end groups, OSCs based on these materials exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency than those based on fullerenes, and the highest power conversion efficiency exceeds 14%. However, the optimum thickness of the active layer of FREAs remains limited to ∼100 nm, which is mainly due to the low electron mobility of traditional FREAs. Therefore, developing new FREAs with higher electron mobility is of great significance. Here, we proposed two novel FREAs, namely, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN. These FREAs consist of four strongly electron-withdrawing end groups linked by a two-dimensional fused-ring core, forming a structure similar to a quad-rotor helicopter. These two FREAs not only exhibit higher electron mobility than the widely used non-fullerene acceptor ITIC but also have lower frontier molecular orbital energy levels, greater electron affinity, higher absorption coefficients and smaller exciton binding energies. Compared with that of ITIC, the absorption spectrum of BFTT-TN is red shifted approximately 100 nm, and its integrated intensity is 2.4 times that of ITIC. These numbers indicate that BFTT-TN features strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared region and produces more excitons. Simultaneously, the exciton binding energy of BFTT-TN (1.47 eV) is smaller than that of ITIC (2.04 eV), which can facilitate the separation of excitons into free charges. In addition, the electron mobility of BFTT-TN (5.32 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is 6.5 times that of ITIC (8.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which can accelerate the transmission of electrons to improve the short-circuit current. All these results imply that the quad-rotor-shaped FREAs are more suitable as electron acceptors for high-performance OSCs. The quad-rotor-shaped FREAs are expected to be an important candidate for the development of next-generation FREAs for high-performance OSCs.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs), typically comprising a photoactive layer composed of an electron-donating material (donor) and an electron-accepting material (acceptor), have attracted much attention in recent years.1 This phenomenon is mainly because they are considered as one of the next-generation renewable energy conversion devices owing to their light weight, low cost and solution processing.2–4 Effective donors and acceptors are important to fabricate high-performance OSCs. However, research on new donors has received more attention than that on new acceptors in the past few decades. Fullerenes and their derivatives, such as PC60BM ([6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester),5 PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester)6 and ICBA (indene-C60 bisadduct),7 have been the most widely used acceptors in the last two decades. Although fullerene derivatives benefit from their strong electron affinity and high electron mobility, they exhibit narrow and weak absorption of sunlight and poor adjustability of energy levels.8,9 Therefore, despite advances being made in donor materials, the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-based OSCs is limited to 12%.10–14
In recent years, non-fullerene acceptors, because of their advantages of having an easy and flexible synthetic method, variable energy levels and electron affinity and increased visible and near-infrared (NIR) absorptivity, have emerged as a major topic in the field of OSCs.15–20 Non-fullerene acceptors are mainly divided into two classes of materials: rylene diimides21–23 and fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs).24–28 FREAs, which mainly consist of two strongly electron-withdrawing end groups connected by a planar fused-ring core, are the most widely investigated non-fullerene acceptors. Considerable efforts have been made to develop new FREAs for high-performance OSCs through variation of the electron-withdrawing end groups29–31 and the fused-ring core.24,25,32
The extensively explored end groups are 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone and its derivatives (methylation or fluorination). The widely known ITIC, for example, has 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone end groups, and, combined with a suitable donor, the power conversion efficiency reached 11.4%.26 Experimental investigations demonstrated that the methylation of 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone can lead to slightly blue shifted absorption and a slight increase in the open circuit voltage33 and that fluorination can lead to red-shifted absorption and increased electron affinity.34 Theoretical results indicated that π–π stacking between the end groups determines the 3D molecular packing and electron mobilities,35 and fluorinated end groups can produce intermolecular F–π interactions and increase electron mobilities.36 Therefore, electron-withdrawing end groups play a critical role in the performance of FREAs.
In addition to end groups, fused-ring cores significantly affect the performance of FREAs. The cores, which consist of dialkylcyclopentadiene or diarylcyclopentadiene rings, are typically fused with thiophene, selenophene and/or benzene.24,25,32,37 Variation of the fused-ring cores can effectively regulate the absorption spectrum, ionization energy, and electron mobilities of FREAs. For example, replacing the central benzene ring with thienothiophene or extending the fused-ring causes the acceptors to exhibit greatly red-shifted absorption and rapidly increased electron mobility.24,25,38 Consequently, developing new suitable fused-ring cores is of great significance for designing and preparing high-performance FREAs.
Although various FREAs have been developed by altering the electron-withdrawing end groups or fused-ring cores, they mainly formed line-shaped molecules by linking two electron-withdrawing end groups through a one-dimensional fused-ring core. In this work, we propose using a two-dimensional (2D) fused-ring core, combined with four di-fluorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone groups as the end groups, to construct two novel quad-rotor-shaped FREAs, named BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, as shown in Fig. 1. These two FREAs not only exhibit higher electron mobility than the widely used ITIC but also have lower frontier molecular orbital energy levels, greater electron affinity, higher absorption coefficients and smaller exciton binding energies (Ec). These results imply that these quad-rotor-shaped FREAs are suitable as an electron acceptor for high-performance OSCs. We propose that the quad-rotor-shaped FREAs are expected to be an important candidate for the development of next-generation FREAS for high-performance OSCs.

Computational method
Quantum chemical calculations
Ground state geometry optimization and vibration frequency of ITIC, BFTT-T and BFTT-TN are calculated at the BLYP/def2-SVP level with geometrical counterpoise correction to remove artificial overbinding effects from the basis set superposition error.39 No imaginary frequency is detected in the same calculation method, indicating the minimum energy states. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, vertical electron affinities, electron reorganization energies (λ−) and spatial distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals are calculated at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP level. The PBE0 hybrid functional can be used to estimate a reasonable colour for most organic materials using time-dependent density functional theory.40 Therefore, PBE0/def2-SVPD is used to investigate the absorption spectra of these materials, in which atom-pairwise dispersion correction (D3ZERO) is used to account for the major part of the contribution of dispersion forces to the energy.41 Analysis of the excited states and natural transition orbitals is performed using the Multiwfn 3.6 package.42 All quantum chemical calculations are carried out based on the ORCA Revision 4.0.0 program.
Multiscale simulations
The electron mobilities of ITIC, BFTT-T and BFTT-TN amorphous thin films are evaluated by a multiscale simulation based on quantum chemical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo calculations. The detailed simulation processes are described in our previous studies.36,43,44 In this work, we used a universal force field model45 as the atomistic force field for the molecular dynamics simulations.
Results and discussion
For the first time, we proposed two novel FREAs, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, consisting of a 2D fused-ring core linked with four electron-withdrawing end groups forming a quad-rotor-shaped molecule. Theoretical methods were used to investigate the geometry structures, electronic properties, topological analysis of the electron density, absorption spectra and electron mobilities of these designed materials.
Geometry and electronic properties
We demonstrated in our previous work that fluorination can effectively inverse the electrostatic potential and produce intermolecular F–π interactions to improve electron mobilities.36 Therefore, we used di-fluorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone as the electron-withdrawing end groups in this work. The optimized geometric structures of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN shown in Fig. 1 (left) show that the four end groups are almost coplanar with the 2D core and confirm the quad-rotor shape of these two FREAs. BFTT-N and BFTT-TN exhibit extended coplanar geometries with an area of 2.2 × 2.8 nm2 and 2.7 × 3.4 nm2, respectively, which are beneficial to elongate the effective conjugation length, extend light absorption and facilitate π–π stacking of these materials.46,47 Although excessive π–π stacking due to high coplanarity tends to make these materials incapable of solution processing, four cyclopentadienyls exist in each molecule which can bear eight flexible aliphatic side-chains to guarantee the solubility of these materials. Introducing side-chains slightly changes the optoelectronic properties of these materials. Therefore, the side-chains are not introduced into BFTT-N and BFTT-TN to reduce the computational cost in this work. During the experiment processes, we proposed introducing flexible aliphatic side-chains linked with the cyclopentadienyls into these quad-rotor-shaped materials to improve the solubility.
In OSCs, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels dominate the exciton separation, charge transportation and open circuit voltage.48 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN compared with the widely used electron acceptor ITIC are shown in Fig. 1 (right). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of ITIC are calculated to be −5.71 and −3.73 eV, respectively, which are close to the experimental data (−5.61/−3.93 eV).49BFTT-N and BFTT-TN exhibit lower-lying LUMOs, which usually results in a larger current density and higher power conversion efficiency when combined with a large-bandgap donor material.50 The LUMO energy levels of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN are 0.51 and 0.32 eV, respectively, lower than that of ITIC and close to that of the high efficiency fullerene acceptor PC71BM (−4.20 eV).51 These results indicate that BFTT-N and BFTT-TN have stronger electronic attraction, which can be confirmed by the calculated vertical electron affinities of ITIC (2.90 eV), BFTT-N (3.55 eV) and BFTT-TN (3.45 eV). The spatial distribution of the corresponding HOMO and LUMO of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN is also shown in Fig. 2 (right). The HOMOs are distributed over the fused-ring core, whereas the LUMOs are delocalized from the core to the end groups. The high degree of delocalization of LUMOs is beneficial to increase the intermolecular LUMO–LUMO overlap for adequate electron transport.

Topological analysis
To obtain insight into the reason these quad-rotor-shaped molecules can maintain a planar structure, we carried out topological analysis of the electron density with the analysis of the bond critical point (BCP) based on atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory,52 as shown in Fig. 3. The results are obtained using the Multiwfn 3.6 package.42 A BCP (3, −1), which is a requirement for the presence of bonding interactions, is found between H⋯π, S⋯O, S⋯S and H⋯H in BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, which demonstrates the existence of four kinds of intramolecular interactions. The electron density (ρ) and Laplacian of electron density (∇2ρ) at these four types of BCPs are summarized in Table 1. It has been observed that ∇2ρ is negative for covalent bonds and positive for closed-shell interactions (ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions).53 Therefore, the four types of intramolecular interactions H⋯π, S⋯O, S⋯S and H⋯H are closed-shell interactions. The ρ values for H⋯π, S⋯O, S⋯S and H⋯H are 0.013/0.017, 0.023, 0.011, and 0.009 a.u., respectively, which are larger than those of a typical hydrogen bond (<0.0034 a.u.). These results demonstrate that these intramolecular interactions are stronger than those of a typical hydrogen bond.54 These noncovalent intramolecular interactions can efficiently maintain the coplanarity of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN and make the plane more rigid, which are beneficial to lower the reorganization energy and facilitate the π–π stacking of these quad-rotor-shaped FREAs to enhance the intrinsic charge mobilities.55 We calculated the electron reorganization energies (λ−) of ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, which are 0.115, 0.009, and 0.0057 eV, respectively. These results also confirm that a rigid structure can lower the reorganization energy effectively.

Electronic absorption spectra
Excellent FREAs should exhibit strong absorption in visible and NIR spectrum regions to generate more excitons and increase the power conversion efficiency. Therefore, the electronic absorption spectra of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN in chloroform are compared with those of ITIC using time-dependent density functional theory. The spectrum with the molar absorption coefficient as the ordinate is shown in Fig. 4(a). The simulated maximum absorption peak of ITIC (666 nm) is consistent with the experimental result (664 nm),32 proving the accuracy of the selected calculation method. BFTT-N and BFTT-TN exhibit the maximum absorption peak at 650 nm and 768 nm, respectively. The BFTT-TN absorption spectrum red shifts more than 100 nm relative to that of ITIC. BFTT-N and BFTT-TN present a higher absorption intensity compared with ITIC. To quantitatively investigate it, we compared the integrated intensity of these spectra. The integrated intensity of BFTT-N is 1.6 times that of ITIC, and BFTT-TN has stronger absorption, which is 2.4 times that of ITIC. This result demonstrates that the quad-rotor-shaped FREAs have strong absorption in the visible and NIR spectrum regions, which is beneficial to improve the performance of the corresponding OSCs.

To further investigate the properties of the excited states in the absorption spectra of ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, the wavelength (λ), oscillator strength (f) and molecular orbital (MO) contribution for each transition with an f larger than 0.5 are depicted in Table 2. Combined with Fig. 4(b), the absorption spectrum of ITIC is dominated by the S0 → S1 transition (666 nm) with an f of 3.37. The absorption spectra of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN consist of four transition processes, namely, S0 → S1 (729 nm), S0 → S2 (663 nm), S0 → S3 (643 nm) and S0 → S4 (626 nm) for BFTT-N and S0 → S1 (805 nm), S0 → S2 (774 nm), S0 → S3 (763 nm) and S0 → S5 (743 nm) for BFTT-TN, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). Although the f of each transition for BFTT-N and BFTT-TN is smaller than that of ITIC, the sum of f for the four transitions is much larger than that of ITIC, explaining the higher absorption intensity of quad-rotor-shaped FREAs. Simultaneously, we investigated the MO contribution for each transition process. The absorption spectrum of ITIC is dominated by the transition between the HOMO and LUMO, whereas HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 contribute to the transition of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, which may be the result of the degeneracy of molecular orbitals due to the increased symmetry of these quad-rotor-shaped molecules. We also investigated the energy difference between HOMO−1 and the HOMO of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, which is 0.02 eV and 0.05 eV, respectively. Such a small energy difference also confirms the degenerate guess mentioned above.

When the OSCs absorb solar radiation, they will generate numerous excited states (excitons) which dissociate into separated (non-coulombically bound) holes and electrons to form free charges. In addition to the absorption of light, the separation of excitons also affects the efficiency of OSCs. Here, hole–electron theory using the Multiwfn 3.6 package,42 is used to investigate the Ec of each electron excited state discussed above. Ec is defined as the Coulomb attraction between holes and electrons, which is produced during electron transition and is calculated via a simple Coulomb formula:  where ρhole(r1) and ρelectron(r2) represent the hole and electron density at r1 and r2, respectively. The calculated Ec for the transition of each excited state is summarized in Table 2. ITIC (2.06 eV) has a higher Ec than BFTT-N (1.70–1.86 eV) and BFTT-TN (1.39–1.48 eV). These values indicate that the Coulomb interaction between holes and electrons in quad-rotor-shaped BFTT-N and BFTT-TN is smaller than that in ITIC, which can facilitate the separation of excitons to generate free charges.
In addition, the hole and electron distribution of ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN is investigated using natural transition orbitals (NTO) theory.56 As shown in Fig. 4(e), the holes of the S0 → S1 transition are distributed on the fused-ring core, and the electrons are delocalized over the entire molecule of ITIC. As the fused-ring core is the major part of ITIC, a large overlap exists between holes and electrons and leads to a high Ec. For comparison with ITIC the NTO distribution of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN is shown in Fig. 5. The holes of these quad-rotor-shaped molecules are distributed on the 2D fused-ring core, and the electrons are also delocalized over the whole molecule, similar to the hole and electron distribution of ITIC. To compare the overlapping extent of holes and electrons quantitatively, we characterized the Sr index of each excited state, as summarized in Table 2. The Sr index is defined as follows:  where ρhole(r) and ρelectron(r) represent the hole and electron density at r. BFTT-N and BFTT-TN show a smaller Sr index; especially for BFTT-TN, the Sr index of all excited states (0.55–0.62) is smaller than that of ITIC (0.67), which indicates less overlap between holes and electrons of excitons in BFTT-N and BFTT-TN and can result in a smaller exciton binding energy.

Electron mobilities
Once the excitons are separated into free charges, the mobility of holes and electrons in the electron donor material and electron acceptor material, respectively, will play a decisive role in the performance of OSCs. Having a high electron mobility is an essential requirement for an excellent electron acceptor material. Here, we used a multiscale simulation method as in our early studies36,43,44 to identify the electron mobilities of ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN amorphous films. This method is based on the hopping model. The diffusion constant must be obtained first to determine the electron mobility, which can be estimated from the slope of the curve of the square displacement versus the simulation times, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The electron diffusion constants of ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN are 1.27 × 1010, 4.36 × 1010 and 8.24 × 1010 nm2 ns−1, respectively. Combined with the Einstein formula,  where e is the electron charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and D is the diffusion constant, the electron mobilities are estimated to be 8.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.82 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 5.32 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, for ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, respectively. The electron mobility of ITIC estimated here is in agreement with the experiment data,32 demonstrating the accuracy of this simulation method. The results indicate that the electron mobility of BFTT-N is approximately 3.4 times that of ITIC, and BFTT-TN shows a higher electron mobility, which is about 6.5 times that of ITIC, suggesting that the quad-rotor-shaped molecules are beneficial to increase the electron mobility.

Average electronic connectivity (e) and the proportion of the largest network (f) as a function of the electronic transfer integral threshold (VT). 
To identify the key factors affecting the electron mobility of the quad-rotor-shaped molecules, we investigate the distribution of the transfer integral of the system (V) and the recorded transfer integral during the simulations (V_record) for ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, as shown in Fig. 6(b)–(d). It is obvious that the distribution of V is concentrated below 0.01 eV, whereas V_record is distributed between 0.02 and 0.08 eV. Determining the factors affecting the electron mobility of these materials based only on this result is difficult because the three molecules exhibit a similar phenomenon.
Furthermore, the average electronic connectivity and proportion of the largest network as a function of the electronic transfer integral threshold (VT) are depicted in Fig. 6(e) and (f). The average electronic connectivity is defined as the average number of neighbours for each molecule with the electronic transfer integral larger than the given VT. It can be used to explore the charge transport network in amorphous films.35 As shown in Fig. 6(e), the average electronic connectivity of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN is larger than that of ITIC, which indicates that BFTT-N and BFTT-TN exhibit larger electron transport networks which can facilitate electron transport during electronic transmission. This finding can be explained by each quad-rotor-shaped molecule containing four electron withdrawing end groups, which is more than that in conventional FREAs.
The relationship between the proportion of molecules (with electronic connectivity ≥ 2) and VT is shown in Fig. 6(f), which represents the proportion of molecules that can participate in electron transport as a function of VT. Combined with Fig. 6(e), when the average electronic connectivity ≥ 2, the VT of ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN is 3, 6 and 6 meV, respectively. When the VT is 3 meV, the proportion of molecules than can participate in electron transport is 94%, 96% and 100% for ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, respectively. However, when VT increases to 6 meV, only 77% of ITIC in the amorphous film participates in electron transport. By contrast, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN still have a high level of molecules participating in electron transport, 87% and 89%, respectively. These results demonstrate that when the electronic transmission network is continuous and robust (with electronic connectivity ≥ 2), the electronic transfer integral of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN is higher than that of ITIC, explaining the high electron mobility of the quad-rotor-shaped molecules.
Amorphous films
To discuss the crystallization properties of BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, we investigated the center-of-mass radial distribution functions of ITIC, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN amorphous films (obtained from molecular dynamic simulation systems) and compared them with those of ITIC crystals (from ref. 35) as shown in Fig. 7. There is an obvious peak around 0.77 nm for the ITIC crystal, which demonstrates the ordered arrangement of ITIC in the crystal, while there are no distinct peaks formed in the amorphous film of ITIC, confirming an amorphous arrangement of ITIC in the amorphous film, which is in agreement with the reported result. Compared with the ITIC crystal, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN amorphous films do not exhibit strong peaks and approach a value of 1.0 with increasing distance, indicating that there is no long-range order for these materials.57 Compared with the ITIC amorphous film, BFTT-N and BFTT-TN amorphous films exhibit some weak peaks at short distances (<1.0 nm) indicating that there is a slight agglomeration at a short distance for BFTT-N and BFTT-TN. This is mainly due to the fact that BFTT-N and BFTT-TN have a larger planar structure, which can facilitate the stacking between these quad-rotor shaped materials. Moreover, BFTT-TN shows three peaks at 0.28, 0.37 and 0.45 nm, which are smaller than 0.5 nm indicating the existence of π–π stacking in the BFTT-TN amorphous film.35 The molecular dynamics simulation of the BFTT-TN amorphous film is shown in Fig. 7.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we proposed using a 2D fused-ring core, combined with four di-fluorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone groups as end groups, to construct two novel quad-rotor-shaped FREAs, named BFTT-N and BFTT-TN, which exhibit a large and rigid coplanar structure. Compared with the widely used ITIC, these two FREAs exhibit stronger absorption in the visible and NIR spectrum regions, which can effectively increase the absorption of solar radiation to generate more excitons. These two FREAs also have smaller Ec, which can facilitate the separation of excitons to produce more free charges. In addition, these two FREAs show higher electron mobility, which can make the transport of free electrons more efficient. Finally, these two FREAs possess lower LUMO energy levels, which can accelerate the collection of free electrons by the cathode. All these results imply that the quad-rotor-shaped FREAs are more suitable as an electron acceptor for high-performance OSCs. The quad-rotor-shaped FREAs are expected to be an important candidate for the development of next-generation FREAs for high-performance OSCs.
