Introduction
Given the increasingly serious concerns about the energy crisis and environmental pollution, renewable energies such as solar and wind have gained considerable attention around the world. Electrical energy storage (EES) systems such as rechargeable battery technologies provide an option for the integration of these intermittent resources.1,2 Although lithium-ion batteries have been widely explored and applied to various fields as they deliver higher energy density compared to other secondary batteries, problems related to the use of toxic and flammable organic electrolytes, the growing price of Li resources and unsatisfactory superfast charging performance impede their applications in large-scale EES systems such as electric vehicles and smart grids.3–5 The search for reliable, low cost EES systems with high energy density is urgently needed.6
Recently, rechargeable aqueous batteries (RABs), such as aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs) and aqueous sodium ion batteries, have been considered as promising alternatives to dominant lithium-ion batteries because of their cost effectiveness, abundant materials and environmental friendliness.7–9 Incombustible aqueous electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, about two orders of magnitude higher than that of nonaqueous ones, and high rate capabilities, are suitable for emerging grid storage applications in terms of good safety and low cost.10,11 Lately, battery chemistries based on energetic multivalent ions (such as Zn2+, Mg2+, and Al3+) that engage in multiple electron transfers and increase charge-storage capabilities have been developed.6,12,13
Rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) are particularly attractive owing to their safety, nontoxicity, inexpensiveness, and high abundance of the Zn source.14 Zn metal has a high theoretical specific capacity of 820 mA h g−1 and low redox potential (−0.76 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), which can work in aqueous electrolytes due to a high overpotential for hydrogen evolution.15 This stability provides a large voltage window (∼2 V) for aqueous ZIBs employing a metallic Zn negative electrode. There are various reported Zn-based batteries such as Zn–Ni, Zn–polymer, Zn–air, Zn–C, Zn–AgO, Zn–V2O5 and Zn–MnO2 batteries.16–19 For example, the energy of Zn–air is up to 400 W h kg−1, which is comparable to lithium-ion batteries.20 Zn-based batteries are also anticipated for advanced technologies such as electric and hybrid electric vehicles and smart grids.
However, the existing aqueous ZIBs are far from achieving the goals of excellent performances demanded by the increasing energy consumption. On the one hand, it's hard to find cathode materials suitable for the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Zn ions (or their solvation sheath in the electrolyte), which limits the development and widespread commercialization of ZIBs.21 Previous explorations of the cathode material mostly focus on manganese dioxide (MnO2) and Prussian blue analogues, nevertheless, the former suffers from poor rate performance and rapid capacity fading, while the latter delivers limited capacities (about 50 mA h g−1).14 On the other hand, the corrosion and hydrogen gas evolution on the Zn anode are major side reactions leading to self-discharge in batteries.
Recently, there is a promising strategy of employing aqueous redox electrolytes as an aqueous cathode by using redox couple reactions for alkali-ion batteries.22,23 Unlike the energy storage mechanism of ion intercalation, which causes low power and reduces cycling stability due to slow ion intercalation kinetics and volume changes, energy storage via highly conductive redox electrolytes is not exclusively confined at the electrode/electrolyte interface and can encompass the entire fluid volume, leading to rapid redox reactions in electrochemical cells. Deterioration of the aqueous cathode and the electrically conductive current collector will not occur during the charge and discharge process. Therefore, the aqueous cathode can offer negligible polarization and volume expansion.
Here, we tackle the limitation of cathode materials for ZFBs by exploring redox active electrolytes and propose a new prototype of liquid Zn-ferrum batteries (ZFBs) using zinc metal as the anode, an aqueous Fe(II/III) redox couple as the catholyte, and modified carbon fibers with N and O (CF–N–O) as the positive electrode. This battery exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a capacity of 352 mA h g−1 at an average discharge voltage of up to 1.25 V at 2 A g−1, an energy density of 391.0 W h kg−1, a power density of 2.2 kW kg−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, and long cycling life: no evident capacity fading after 5000 cycles.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of CFs (carbon fibers) (Fig. 1a–c) and CF–N–O (modified carbon fibers with N and O) (Fig. 1d–f). The surface of CF is smooth and dense before ammonia and O2-plasma treatment. After ammonia and O2-plasma etching, the diameter of CF–N–O is decreased to 4.6 μm, much thinner than the untreated CF with a diameter of 7.8 μm. And there are a lot of holes on the surface of CF–N–O, which correspond to the BET data and pore size distributions (Fig. S2†). Large surface area carbon has also been identified to be important for effective adsorption of such cations. In addition, the pore size of the electrodes has been used to describe certain interactions of the cationic species with the carbon surface. The presence of 2–3 nm pores in carbon materials has been claimed as the possible reason for improved charge storage properties of the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox species in aqueous solution. The contact angle images of the non-treated carbon fibers and CF–N–O with aqueous liquid electrolyte droplets are shown in Fig. S1.† The non-treated CF has a contact angle of 137.4° after dropping the liquid electrolyte on its surface for 90 s. However, the aqueous electrolyte droplet penetrates into the CF–N–O in 5 s. The experimental results indicate that the CF–N–O has superior electrolyte wettability, leading to better electrochemical performance.

Raman spectra of the two samples are shown in Fig. 2a. The intensity ratio of the D band and the G band (ID/IG) is inversely proportional to the in-plane crystallite sizes and can represent the defect level in carbon materials. Here the ID/IG of CF–N–O is 0.95 which is higher than that of CF (0.84), suggesting that CF–N–O contains more defects than CF. Fig. 2b shows the Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) image of CF and CF–N–O. The C–N bonding at 1635 cm−1 in CF–N–O is stronger than that observed in CF, indicating more N containing groups in CF–N–O. The C–O bonding at 1056 cm−1 appeared in CF–N–O, while it disappeared in CF, suggesting more O containing groups in CF–N–O. To characterize the elemental composition of the samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted as shown in Fig. 2c and d, and the elemental composition is shown in Table S1.† Locations of 398 eV, 399 eV, and 401 eV for N-dopant in the carbon sheet show “pyridinic” N (N-6), “pyrrolic” N (N-5), and “graphitic” N (N-Q), respectively. Here, pyridinic N refers to any N with one p-electron in the π system, and pyrrolic N refers to any N with two p-electrons in the π system; the latter is not limited to the five-member ring environment as in pyrrole.24 From Fig. 2c and d of the XPS of CF and CF–N–O, the conclusion can be drawn that there are more “pyridinic” N (N-6) and “pyrrolic” N (N-5) in CF–N–O, resulting in more efficient adsorption of redox active species. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption revealed a characteristic type-IV (H4) isotherm with a clear hysteresis loop located in the P/P0 range of 0.45–1.0, indicating the existence of large numbers of mesopores (slit hole in a parallel plate structure) in CF–N–O (Fig. 2e). Compared with CF, the specific surface area and the pore volume of CF–N–O have greatly increased as shown in Table S1† due to the etching of NH3 and O2-plasma (Table 1).

Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of CF–N–O and the Zn plate for the three-electrode system in both positive and negative voltage windows, tested at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Zn and CF–N–O electrodes were tested separately by using Ag/AgCl (KCl saturated) electrode and Pt as reference and counter electrodes in the mixed electrolyte containing 5 M ZnSO4, 3.1 M glycine, 0.08 M Fe2(SO4)3·5H2O and 0.12 M FeSO4·7H2O. It can be clearly seen that two sets of redox peaks were observed at −1.1 to −0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, KCl saturated) for Zn and 0.3 to 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, KCl saturated) for CF–N–O. The redox peaks around −1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, KCl saturated) can be attributed to the reversible dissolution and deposition of Zn with the redox reaction of Zn2+/Zn in the electrolyte, and the redox peaks at the potential of around 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, KCl saturated) can be attributed to the redox reaction of Fe3+/Fe2+ as shown in eqn (1) and (2). As a result, their combination will build up a rechargeable battery system with a high output voltage of about 1.53 V as shown in eqn (3). Fig. 3b shows galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) potential profiles for the Fe3+/Fe2+ cathode and the Zn anode; the negative electrode Zn/Zn2+ exhibits a charge and discharge plateau at −1.0 and −1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, KCl saturated), respectively. Also, the positive electrode Fe2+/Fe3+ shows the charge and discharge plateau at 0.5 to 0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, KCl saturated). As a result, the voltage of the assembled ZFB full cell can reach 1.5 V. Zn2+ + 2e− ⇔ Zn, E0 = −0.76 V vs. NHE(1) Fe3+ + e− ⇔ Fe2+, E0 = 0.77 V vs. NHE(2) 2Fe3+ + Zn ⇔ 2Fe2+ + Zn2+, E0 = 1.53 V(3)

(d) The relationships between peak currents versus the square root of scan rates from CV curves (b is the slope of linear fit and R2 is the goodness-of-fit). 
The CV curves from 0.16 mV s−1 to 1 mV s−1 were obtained in the mixed electrolyte to analyse the electrochemical kinetics of the positive electrode (Fig. 3c). The diffusion coefficient can be calculated using the Randles–Sevcik equation (4). Ip = 0.4463(F3/RT)1/2n3/2AD1/2Cν1/2 = 2.69 × 105n3/2AD1/2Cν1/2(4)where b is 269000 × n3/2AD1/2C, n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox process (here it is 1), A is the electrochemically active area (here it is 5.2 cm2 for CF–N–O, Fig. S2†), F is the Faraday constant (in 96485 C mol−1), D is the diffusion coefficient (in cm2 s−1) and C is the concentration of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions (here it is about 0.28 × 10−3 mol cm−3).
According to eqn (4), the plot of the oxidation or reduction peak current Ipversus the square root of the scan rate (ν1/2) should be a straight line, which is shown in Fig. 3d. It has a y = a + bx linear trend and, as such, it allows the determination of the b parameter, from which the diffusion coefficient for the oxidation and reduction process was calculated to be 1.34 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 (Do) and 1.11 × 10−8 cm2 s−1 (Dr). These results also reveal that the mechanism of the Fe3+/Fe2+ oxidation and reduction reaction is diffusion-controlled. Evidently, it is different from the intercalation compounds, and the diffusion coefficient is much higher than those of lithium ions in lithium intercalation compounds, below 10−10 cm2 s−1.25 The excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the fast ion transportation in aqueous solution, better adsorption properties of CF–N–O and fast redox reaction kinetics of Fe3+/Fe2+. Based on the above discussion, the CF–N–O single electrode based on the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple can be a good positive electrode.

Fig. 4 shows the schematic of the assembled ZFBs using zinc metal as the anode, the aqueous Fe(II/III) redox couple as the catholyte and CF–N–O as the positive electrode for the charge and discharge process. When the ZFBs were charged, redox species Fe2+ in the bulk solution firstly enter the pores of the positive electrode and were absorbed on the surface of the CF–N–O electrode. Then Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ by losing an electron as shown in eqn (5), which occurs at the CF–N–O electrode/electrolyte interface. Zn2+ ions in the bulk solution move to the surface of the Zn foil and deposit as metallic Zn by getting 2 electrons. During the discharge state, the opposite process occurs. The Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ and then desorb from the electrode surface to the bulk solution. Zn is oxidized to Zn2+ and desorb into the electrolyte.

The electrodes were charged, and then they were rinsed several times with deionized water. After that, they were dried in an oven at 120 °C. The SEM images and the corresponding elemental mapping images of CF–N–O after charge in Fig. 5a–g show that there exist particles containing the element of Fe on CF–N–O, which confirms our speculation of the mechanism as discussed above. XPS spectra (Fig. 5i) of CF–N–O after the charge process confirm that the valence of Fe is +3 and the existence of FeOOH.26–28 As SEM images and the corresponding elemental mapping images show, the element of Fe is evenly distributed on the surface of CF–N–O, and the O and N containing functional groups in CF–N–O may contribute to the absorption of Fe ions. The electron diffraction (ED) pattern of CF–N–O after charge (Fig. 5h) shows the ambiguous boundary of diffraction rings, indicating that the existing state of Fe is amorphous. XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns (Fig. 5j) of CF–N–O after charge also confirmed that FeOOH was amorphous.

The CV curves from 0.5 mV s−1 to 10 mV s−1 and the GCD curves from 2 A g−1 to 10 A g−1 of the assembled ZFBs were obtained to test the electrochemical performance. As shown in Fig. 6a and c, there exist two redox peaks around 1.4 V, which is the redox process of Fe2+ and Fe3+. At 2 A g−1, the discharge specific capacitance of CF–N–O is 352 mA h g−1, which is 2.2 times the discharge specific capacitance of CF (158 mA h g−1). At 10 A g−1, the discharge specific capacitance of CF–N–O is 214 mA h g−1, which is 5.5 times the discharge specific capacitance of CF (39 mA h g−1). All these results indicate that CF–N–O has higher specific capacitance and better rate performance than CF. Employing CF–N–O as a cathode for the ZFB system is beneficial in two aspects. First, due to the existing more O and N containing functional groups and large surface area, CF–N–O have better properties for the adsorption of Fe ions. Second, the confinement of the redox ions in porous CF–N–O leads to thin layer diffusion rather than to conventional planar diffusion. Therefore, the high power of the ZFBs is enabled via enhanced redox kinetics of Fe2+/Fe3+ in confined carbon nanopores.

The cycling stability was investigated by using the GCD test at 10 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 7a, the specific capacitance maintained was 92.3% of original capacitance after 5000 cycles, indicating good electrochemical stability. The self-discharge performance shows the time courses of the open-circuit voltage. The device was charged to 1.9 V by applying a constant current of 2 mA, and then it was tested by open circuit potential-time technology. It underwent a little self-discharge rate in the first several minutes, and then the self-discharge rate course was quite limited after several hours. Finally, the device shows a stable output voltage of ∼1.22 V after 20.4 h and almost 79.3% of the initial open circuit potential was well retained even after 20.4 h. The advantage of the low self-discharge course is very desirable for application in standby devices. The strong physisorption of Fe3+/Fe2+ ions in nanoconfined spaces, however, enables low self-discharge rates in the absence of an ion exchange membrane which significantly reduces the cost. Two coin-cells were used in series to light up a red light emitting diode (LED, the lowest working potential is 2.4 V), as shown in Fig. 7b. Using the specific capacitance calculated from the GCD test, the specific energy density and the specific power density were calculated as shown in Fig. 7c, which are 391.0 W h kg−1 and 2.2 kW kg−1, respectively, at 2 A g−1. Meanwhile, the specific energy density of 156.2 kW kg−1 and the specific power density of 7.3 kW kg−1 are obtained at 10 A g−1. Ragone plots of specific energy versus specific power for the assembled ZFB energy storage devices compared with other standard devices: electrochemical capacitors (ECs), lead–acid batteries, nickel metal–hydride batteries, and lithium-ion batteries are shown in Fig. 7d. The energy density of these ZFBs are comparable to Li-ion batteries, and their power density are comparable to ECs, showing excellent energy storage properties and promising applications in the future.

Zinc and iron are two common elements that have abundant reserves in the Earth's crust, and they have outstanding electrochemical properties as well. Due to the low cost of the electrolyte and the high performance of the battery, the neutral ZFBs exhibit a great advantage. Our designed ZFBs can obtain a very high electrolyte concentration and open circuit voltage, which is different from the zinc-ion battery and the zinc–iron flow battery as shown in Tables 2 and S2.† These flow batteries may suffer from the problems of complex battery configuration, high cost of the membrane, low energy density and poor cycle life. In this work, ZFBs can be applied in some portable devices with flexible configuration compared to the flow battery. Redox pairs adsorbed on the carbon fiber electrode were used as the cathode rather than intercalation cathode materials, and it is also an efficient way to fabricate aqueous zinc-based batteries.

Conclusions
In summary, a new prototype of liquid Zn-ferrum batteries (ZFBs) using metal zinc as the anode and an aqueous Fe(II/III) redox couple as the catholyte was proposed. This battery exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a capacity of 352 mA h g−1 at an average discharge voltage up to 1.25 V at 2 A g−1, an energy density of 391.0 W h kg−1, a power density of 2.2 kW kg−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, and long cycling life: no evident capacity fading after 5000 cycles. In the case of the ZFB system, sub-nanometer pores of CF–N–O enable low self-discharge rate via Fe2+ and Fe3+ adsorption in carbon nanopores, which was achieved without applying an ion exchange membrane. This battery was proved to be a promising energy storage system with high efficiency, energy density, reliability and durability, and it might be promising for application in electric vehicles.
