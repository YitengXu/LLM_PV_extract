    , Accepted 21st June 2023First published on 22nd June 2023AbstractHematite is an attractive material used as electron transport layer in perovskite-based solar cells. Being hydrophilic in nature it attracts moisture, which can be damaging for perovskite layers. Therefore, it is important to make hematite moisture repelling, which can be beneficial for applications in solar cells or for protecting iron surfaces from further rust formation. In this work, we demonstrate that the systematic irradiation of nanostructured hematite with low-energy argon ions (Ar+) at various ion fluences can change the surface wettability as well as promote the formation of junctions between nanorods. The nano-welded network of the irradiated hematite turns out to be hydrophobic. Using TRI3DYN simulations, ion-induced surface roughening, the presence of surface oxygen vacancies, and joining between adjacent nanorods are predicted. Furthermore, the water-repelling behavior of the irradiated nano-network is evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) simulations by determining the interaction of water molecules with the surface. The interconnected hematite nano-network also shows a notable improvement in electrical conductivity.
1. Introduction
In the past few decades, there has been a significant amount of attention paid to the fabrication and growth of nanostructured materials with a variety of distinct morphologies because of their functional competencies.1–4 Now, the emphasis is on using these nanomaterials for translation into nanodevices. Nanostructured hematite is very popular as electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells.5–7 For instance, α-Fe2O3 used in an organic–inorganic perovskite solar cell was found to attract moisture, which reacts with the perovskite layer.8 The surface –OH groups form Fe–O–Pb groups, which decrease the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, after removing the water content from the surface, both the PCE and the stability of the solar cell were found to be enhanced. Techniques that include spray coating,9 chemical etching,10 solution immersion,11 laser electrodeposition,12etc., have been used to apply an external coating on nanostructures to control their wettability. However, the addition of a foreign material as the water-repelling coating may hinder the performance of the devices. Recently, the ion beam modification technique has been used to tune the wetting properties of nanostructured materials.13 The wettability of any surface depends on its chemical composition as well as the surface microstructure. The ion beam irradiation produces a defect on the irradiated surface that influences the chemical behavior of the surface to some extent. Rajbhar et al.14 demonstrated the ion-beam-induced transition of a strontium manganite nanowire from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic. Dhal et al.15 described the joining mechanism of hydrogen titanate nanotubes, which generated 3D nano-networks that are superhydrophobic in nature. Thus making the hematite surface water-repelling is a challenge, and here we attempt to do this using argon ion (Ar+) irradiation and without any additional chemical functionalization of the surface. Ar+ ions were chosen because of their inertness and the higher capacity for creating cascade-collision-induced defect states because of their higher atomic mass. Previous studies on Ar+ ion irradiation have shown remarkable enhancements in properties, such as gas sensing,16 optical detection,17 energy storage,18 hydrogen adsorbtion,19 nano-device fabrication20,21etc., owing to changes in the surface defects and morphological modifications.22,23
Other important aspects of 1D hematite are its application in sensing, catalysis, and energy devices. Different approaches have been used to enhance the effectiveness of hematite nanostructures. The plasma-induced vacancies of hematite photoanodes have shown an improved water splitting performance.24,25 Another approach is the formation of 3D nanostructures using nanoparticles and nanorods of hematite to develop sensing and electrode materials. For instance, the 3D nanostructure of nitridated hematite was found to be useful for flexible lithium ion battery applications.26 A hematite nanoparticle-based film showed a remarkable H2S gas sensing performance.27 One of the most significant aspects of such device production is the development of interconnections between individual nanostructures, which can enhance the connectivity, reduce the contact resistance and produce porous structures with high surface areas.28 Many in-depth studies have been carried out on the joining of metals,29,30 semiconductors,31 and carbon-based32 nanostructured materials. Such interconnections between hematite nanostructures using any method is challenging at this stage, and we have used ion beam technique to achieve that. We further note many other interesting applications of this material, where the formation of a nano-network and modulation of the surface can be extremely beneficial.33–35 Hematite is one of the most thermodynamically stable phases with a bandgap of 2.2 eV,36 and the material has been investigated widely for its various technical aspects, which include photoinduced water splitting,37 gas sensing,38 magnetic recording,4 catalysis,39 drug delivery,40 lithium-ion batteries,4 tissue repair engineering,41 spin electronic devices,42 and pigments.43
Using low-energy ion irradiation, hematite nanostructures are modified to develop a well-connected network-like morphology. Whereas the overall morphological modifications are studied using scanning electron microscopy, the alteration of crystal structure is investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering spectroscopy. The change in the surface chemistry is decoded using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hematite nano-network turns out to be water-repelling after ion irradiation. TRI3DYN simulations and density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations are used extensively to explain such ion beam induced changes of the hematite nano-network as well as the wetting behaviour.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Sample preparation
Hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanorods were synthesized using the hydrothermal method.44 In a glass beaker, 50 mmol of FeCl3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, >98%) and 75 mmol of urea (Sigma-Aldrich, >98%) were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water with magnetic stirring to make a homogenous solution. After thorough mixing, the solution was transferred to an autoclave, where suitable pieces of pre-cleaned, transparent FTO substrates were immersed vertically in the solution. The autoclave was placed in an air oven at a constant temperature of 100 °C for 24 hours. After this reaction, the FTO substrates are taken out carefully and cleaned several times with deionized water and finally dried overnight at 60 °C in an oven. The hydrothermally treated FTO substrates were observed to be thoroughly covered with a thin layer of a reddish-brown precipitate. Finally, the FTO substrates are annealed at 500 °C for 2 hours at a rate of 3 °C per minute. These reddish-brown precipitate-covered FTO substrates (pristine sample) were used for all further characterizations and ion irradiation experiments.
2.2. Ion irradiation and characterization
Low-energy (5 keV) Ar+ ions were used to irradiate the pristine samples at ion fluences of 1 × 1016, 3 × 1016, and 5 × 1016 ions cm−2 using a custom designed low energy implanter at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhubaneswar. Ion irradiation was carried out normal to the coated substrate surface at room temperature. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was used to assess the crystal structure as well as the phase characterization of the pristine and irradiated samples. The morphology of the surface was determined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Zeiss Merlin Compact Gemini). Raman spectra were acquired using a micro-Raman spectrometer coupled to an inverted microscope at an excitation wavelength of 532.14 nm generated using a Nd:YAG laser. A contact angle measuring setup (Model No. ACAMD1, Apex Instruments Pvt. Ltd) was used to investigate the wetting behaviour of the pristine as well as the ion irradiated samples at room temperature. Contact angle hysteresis was measured at a tilting angle of 15° by calculating the difference between advancing and receding contact angles.
2.3. TRI3DYN simulation details
A state-of-the-art TRI3DYN simulation technique was used to explain the ion beam interaction with an arbitrary solid nano-surface as well as the junction-formation mechanism. The Monte Carlo method was used to run the TRI3DYN simulations, which is based on the binary collision approximation (BCA).45 The current program is an advanced version of the TRIDYN simulation, where a dynamic collision takes placed in one particular direction. It is possible to investigate the constant evolution of the target system under irradiation using this program, which takes into account the sputtering, atomic mixing, recoiling of the atoms, and re-deposition of the target system. According to this technique, the composition's dynamical change along a line perpendicular to the surface can be predicted, where sputtering, defect migrations, re-deposition of the recoiled atoms, and distribution of the implanted ions with other parameters are taken into account.46 TRIM simulations are one of the most important techniques to understand the ion–solid interaction through the available SRIM package, which shows the relative outcome of the amorphous materials and the sputtering after the interaction. The main drawback of such TRIM simulations are that the simulations are performed under a static condition, so it is not possible to consider ion implantation, sputtering, and collision relocation of the atom during high-fluence modification. To overcome the limitation of TRIM simulations, BCA is applied in such a way that it describes the ion implantation, compositional change, and other high-fluence effects. The TRI3DYN computer simulation program can be used to understand the interaction of ion beams with material surfaces for any 3D system in the nanoscale. For the sake of computation, the target volume is partitioned into small same-sized 3D voxels that are evenly spaced. Following ion collisions, the presence of external atoms with varying atomic densities causes the atomic density of each voxel to change, and this change is caused by the presence of different atomic densities of the external atoms. Ion collisional effects are responsible for the movement and exchange of materials in nanostructured materials between two voxels. As a result, all collisional events and consequences at the interface, including sputtering, atomic mixing, re-deposition, and defect migration, are captured and recorded.
In these current simulations, the 3D cubic object was comprised of volume elements of size 100 × 100 × 100 nm3, and the total volume is subdivided into 170 × 170 × 170 voxels with a periodic y–z boundary with a spacing of 0.6 nm for each voxel. Hematite nanorods with a diameter of 15 nm and a length of 70 nm were placed on a silicon substrate one upon another. A broad and uniform beam of 5 keV Ar+ ions was used for irradiation with fluences of 1 × 1016, 3 × 1016 and 5 × 1016 ions cm−2 onto the hematite nanorod assemblies.
2.4. DFT calculations
First-principles calculations of the ground states of typical configurations using density functional theory were used to investigate the wetting of both the pristine and irradiated hematite nanorods. The Quantum ESPRESSO program (QE, version 6.2) was used for all the calculations.47 Total energies were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation of the exchange–correlation functional and the Rappe–Rabe–Kaxiras–Joannopoulos ultrasoft (RRKJUS) pseudopotentials. Although the density cutoff and the plane wave cutoff energy were both held constant at 650 and 50 Ry, respectively, the convergence threshold for self-consistency was held fixed at 10−6 Ry. A 1 × 5 × 1 Fe2O3 supercell along the (104) plane was considered to characterize a pristine hematite nanorod. To describe the irradiated Fe2O3 nanorods, three different structures were created. Two O, two Fe, and one O and one Fe vacancy were produced in a relaxed pristine Fe2O3 supercell structure to create the irradiated structures. The XY lattice vectors of the supercells were modified to match the relaxed structure of the hematite nanorod. The periodic copies can be considered to be uncoupled from one another because the third cell parameter, along the Z axis, is fixed at 20 Å. The force is reduced by optimizing the lattice parameters and atomic locations until it is less than 1 × 10−3 Ry Bohr−1. The surface wettability was determined by placing three layers of water at a distance of 2 Å above the surface of the initial relaxed structures and then optimizing the structure further. In order to calculate structural relaxation with the Monkhorst–Pack technique, a 3 × 3 × 1 k-mesh was used to sample the Brillouin zone.
3. Results and discussion
The as-grown pristine hematite nanorods were grown uniformly on the substrate (Fig. 1(a)) with an average diameter of about 15 ± 5 nm (see Fig. S1 in ESI†) and a length of about 75 ± 10 nm (see Fig. S2 in ESI†). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) confirmed the presence of Fe and O in the pristine sample (see Fig. S3 in ESI†). The other peaks of Sn and Si are from the FTO substrate. These nanorods are irradiated with 5 keV Ar+ ions at ion fluences of 1 × 1016, 3 × 1016, and 5 × 1016 ions cm−2. At the lowest ion fluence, the hematite nanorods begin to be deformed (Fig. 1(b)), and at a higher ion fluence of 3 × 1016 ions cm−2 the deformation is even more prominent (Fig. 1(c)). The nanorods are observed to become welded with each other and form a large-scale network at a fluence of 5 × 1016 ions cm−2 with broadening of the junction points (Fig. 1(d)). The irradiated nano-network contains pores with sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm (see Fig. S5 in ESI†), which demonstrates the creation of a porous nano-network using low-energy ion beam irradiation.

The EDX spectra of this sample (see Fig. S4 in ESI†) show a decrease in the intensity of the peaks related to the Fe and O atoms when compared with the pristine sample (see Fig. S3 in ESI†). Ion irradiation induces the sputtering out of elements from the system and thus vacancies are created. To understand the Ar+ ion range through hematite nanorods, TRIM (Transport of Ions in Matter) simulations were performed.48 TRIM simulations provide a reasonable understanding of the transportation of energetic ions (here Ar+ with an energy of 5 keV) in a static system considering the binary collision approximation and the Monte Carlo approach.49 In this work the average range of 5 keV Ar+ ions passing through a hematite nanorod is found to be 6.5 nm (Fig. 2). Each ion generates roughly 85 lattice vacancies in the target (the hematite nanorod in this case) as a result of collisions between the ions and nanorods. During this process, each oxygen atom acquires 2.23 keV of energy and each iron atom experiences 2.12 keV of energy from each of the argon ions.

To accentuate the effect of such collisions between ions and nanorods on the morphology and the structure in terms of the atomic mixing, defect creation, etc., TRI3DYN is used. For 5 keV argon ions, the projectile ion range is 5 nm which is lower than the average diameter of the hematite nanorods (Fig. 1(a)); therefore, most of the ions are expected to interact with the atoms on the surface and in the close vicinity, and the structures undergo modifications. Fig. 3(a–c) shows the overall atomic density of the pristine and irradiated samples.

The change in atomic fraction after irradiation compared with the pristine hematite nanorods can be seen clearly in Fig. 4(a–f). Such noticeable changes in the atomic fraction are due to the action of sputtering, recoil, collision cascades, and re-deposition of atoms.50,51 It is established that a large number of atoms are sputtered out when the ion fluence is increased. This eventually increases the thickness at the junction point as a large number of recoiled-out atoms are deposited at the junction area between the nanorods. In this study, both iron and oxygen atoms are re-deposited at the junction areas, creating distinct joining amongst the nanostructures. Because of the predominant collisional effect, a nano-network of hematite structures is formed through a welding mechanism.52 An interesting observation is witnessed in the relative changes in atomic fraction of iron (Fe) and oxygen (O) after irradiation (Fig. 4) by taking a cross-section along the X–Z plane of the nanorods through the center. The color code indicates that the pristine hematite rod consists of 60% O (Fig. 4(a)) and 40% Fe (Fig. 4(d)). Compared with the pristine sample, following the irradiation at an ion fluence of 3 × 1016 ions cm−2, it is seen that the atomic fraction of oxygen decreases to 35% (Fig. 4(c)) from the surface of the nanorod, and the same occurs for iron, which is reduced to 20% (Fig. 4(f)). It is evident that a greater number of oxygen atoms is sputtered out from the nanorod surface because of preferential sputtering due to higher stoichiometry ratio and the lower atomic mass of oxygen compared with iron.17,19 The TRI3DYN simulations also confirmed the ion beam mixing, which is much more prominent at the junction point and plays a crucial role in the formation of welded homo-junctions between the hematite nanorods.

The effect of ion irradiation on the change in chemical composition was demonstrated via an XPS study (Fig. 5). Fig. 5(a) presents the Fe 2p spectrum of the as-synthesized hematite nanorods. The broad signal is deconvoluted into five sharp peaks. The peaks at around 725.1 eV and 711.7 eV correspond to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states of Fe3+, respectively.53 The other two peaks located at 723.3 and 709.9 eV can be assigned to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states of the Fe2+ species.54,55 The presence of Fe2+ may originate from the Fe3O4 moiety present in the system as a byproduct of the chemical reaction. To synthesize iron oxide nanorods, an Fe3+ salt is used as a precursor for iron in the presence of urea (CO(NH2)2). Under hydrothermal reaction conditions, i.e., at high temperature and pressure, urea produces ammonia (NH3) which is the reactive species that continues further reactions. The probable chemical reactions involved in this process may be summarised as follows:56 CO(NH2)2 + H2O →2NH3 + CO2(1) NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH−(2) CO2 + H2O → H2CO3(3) H2CO3 → 2H+ + CO32−(4) CO32− + H2O → HCO3− + OH−(5) FeCl3 + 3OH− → Fe(OH)3 + 3Cl−(6) Fe(OH)3 → β-FeOOH + H2O(7) 2β-FeOOH → α-Fe2O3 + H2O(8)

In a closed reaction system, in presence of urea Fe3+ may also form a complex such as [Fe(CON2H4)6]3+, which further decomposes to form Fe3O4 in the system.57 This indicates that the Fe3O4 phase coexists to some extent with the α-Fe2O3 phase. However, the X-ray diffraction study showed the formation of monophasic α-Fe2O3 nanorods (the black line in Fig. 6(a)). Therefore, it may be assumed that the α-Fe2O3 phase is predominant over the Fe3O4 phase in the studied system. The X-ray diffractogram of the pristine nanorod sample (black line in Fig. 6(a)) clearly indicates the predominant growth direction of hematite nanorods along the (104) plane. Liu et al. commented upon the role of the hydrothermal reaction time on the growth orientation of hematite nanocrystals.58 The β-FeOOH particles aggregate and are finally converted to rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 with preferential growth along the (104) plane though a phase transformation and recrystallization processes. The transformation of β-FeOOH to rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 crystals is an energetically favourable process since the surface energy of the primary β-FeOOH particles is minimized during the transformation process. Such oriented crystal facets of materials may significantly influence their surface properties, particularly the surface adsorptivity owing to the enhanced surface reactivity.

The Raman spectrum of the as-grown nanorods further confirms the presence of both hematite and magnetite phases in the sample (black line in Fig. 6(b)). The peaks positioned at 218, 282, 389, and 470 cm−1 correspond to the A1g and Eg vibration modes of α-Fe2O3 (marked as ‘H’ in Fig. 6(b)).59–61 Along with the α-Fe2O3 phase, two broad peaks at 389 and 470 cm−1 may appear due to the presence of a small amount of the Fe3O4 phase (marked as ‘M’ in Fig. 6(b)). There are two peaks corresponding to 458 and 557 cm−1, which are observed due to the FTO glass (marked as ‘F’ in Fig. 6(b)).62
After low energy ion irradiation with an ion fluence of 3 × 1016 ions cm−2, from the deconvoluted spectrum of the Fe 2p state, it is seen that the contribution of Fe2+ predominates over Fe3+ state (Fig. 5(b)). A new satellite peak is also observed at 717 eV, which may be attributed to Fe2+ species.55 This indicates the partial conversion of the α-Fe2O3 phase to Fe3O4 upon ion irradiation.
Interestingly no such change is observed in X-ray diffraction or Raman studies. The X-ray diffractogram shows the gradual amorphization of the sample with increasing ion fluence (Fig. 6(a)) maintaining the basic hematite phase. The peaks at 2θ of 33.3°, 35.8°, 41.0°, 49.6°, 54.2°, 57.8°, 62.5°, and 64.1° match with the characteristic diffraction lines for the (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), (122), (214), and (300) planes of the α-Fe2O3 nanorods (JCPDS Card No. 840311). The Raman spectra also indicate the amorphization of the sample with increasing ion fluence (Fig. 6(b)). For the samples that are irradiated at ion fluences of 1 × 1016 and 3 × 1016 ions cm−2, a new hematite mode appears and the other distinct peaks disappear. Finally, for the sample that was irradiated at 5 × 1016 ions cm−2, almost all the peaks disappear. Amorphization of the nanostructured samples induced by ion irradiation is a well-known phenomenon.63 The accumulation of large number of defects induced by ion collision may cause amorphization, and the extent of amorphization increases with the ion fluence. The ion collision triggers the diffusion of vacancies and interstitials. The core level O 1s spectra of the as-grown nanorods and the sample irradiated at 3 × 1016 ions cm−2 support this fact (Fig. 5(c and d)). The deconvoluted O 1s spectrum of the as-grown sample (Fig. 5(c)) consists of three peaks located at binding energies of 535.8 eV, 531.8 eV, and 529.4 eV, which may originate from the adsorbed H2O, oxygen defects, and the lattice oxygen (O2−), respectively.64 After ion irradiation, significant decrease in the intensities of adsorbed H2O and lattice oxygen is observed, which may be connected to the significant sputtering of oxygen atoms from the irradiated hematite nanorods. The change in intensity of the lattice oxygen has a direct effect on the surface wetting behaviour of the hematite nanorods. To understand the effect of ion irradiation, the interaction of water droplets with the pristine and ion-irradiated surfaces were monitored. The water droplet on the surface of pristine sample disappears within a fraction of a second, which implies the superhydrophilic behaviour of the pristine surface (see the Video file in the ESI†). The XPS spectrum of the as-grown nanorod sample indicated the ample presence of surface hydroxyl (OH) groups. It is well established that the presence of surface hydroxyl groups imparts hydrophilicity.65,66 The superhydrophilic nature changes drastically after ion irradiation. When exposed to an ion fluence of 1 × 1016 ions cm−2, the sample surface develops a hydrophobic regime with a contact angle of 90.2 ± 2° (Fig. 7(a)). The contact angle increases to 95.7 ± 3° using an enhanced ion fluence of 3 × 1016 ions cm−2 (Fig. 7(b)). When the ion fluence is increased further to 5 × 1016 ions cm−2, the contact angle also increases to 100.1 ± 3° (Fig. 7(c)). These experimental observations confirm that ion irradiation can be used efficiently to tune the surface wetting behaviour of hematite nanorods. A contrasting change from superhydrophilicity to hydrophobicity is possible by simply regulating the ion fluence.

The wetting behaviour of any surface is determined by its surface chemistry and the morphology of the surface. It is known that the energy of nanostructured surfaces is high, and therefore they exhibit a water-attracting nature, in general. In the current study, the as-grown nanorods also show very strong hydrophilic behaviour, which is in line with above proposition (see the Video in the ESI†). However, in the case of irradiated nano-network samples, the morphology plays a very important role in determining the surface wetting behaviour. The FESEM images in Fig. 1 showed the formation of a network-like structure via ion irradiation. These network-like structures hold the water droplet on the surface. It is noticed, however, that although the contact angle increases with ion irradiation, it also experiences adhesive wetting behaviour.67 This may be discussed in light of the atomic vacancies created due to sputtering from the system induced by Ar+ ion irradiation. The O 1s XPS spectrum of the irradiated sample clearly indicates an enhancement of the peak area related to the oxygen defect state (Fig. 5). This implies that ion irradiation induces defect states in the hematite nano-network system. The presence of defect states is known to enable dominant control over the wetting behaviour of surfaces.
To validate the effect of the defect states and to understand the underlying mechanism of the wetting properties of the as-prepared and post-irradiated structures, DFT calculations of the ground states of the representative configurations were performed. The lattice parameters a = b = 5.007 Å, and c = 14.652 Å, as shown in Fig. 8, were optimized for the (104) surface structure of Fe2O3, and are extremely near to the experimental values of a = b = 5.001 Å, and c = 13.62 Å. This structure is used as the pristine form of the Fe2O3 structure. Two O, two Fe, and one O and one Fe atoms were removed from the as-prepared Fe2O3 structure to construct the post-irradiated defected structure. To understand the effect of the water droplets, one- and three-molecule-thick layers of water molecules, respectively, were placed initially at a distance of 2 Å from the optimized Fe2O3 surfaces.65Fig. 9 displays the relaxed structure with three layers of water on top of the Fe2O3 surface, and Fig. 10 shows the histogram of the number of H2O molecules at different positions from the top of the surface. The inset to Fig. 10 (blue bars) shows the position of just one layer of H2O molecules from the top surface of the Fe2O3. In the case of the pristine structure, the water layer moves closer to an average distance of 1.5 Å from the top surface of Fe2O3 (Fig. 10(a)), indicating that the hydrophilic nature of Fe2O3 is due primarily to the Fe⋯O bonding (Fig. 9(a)). By contrast, in the case of the irradiated structures, the water layers moved away from the top surface of Fe2O3 (Fig. 10(b)–(d)) and the surface exhibits a hydrophobic nature for all possible types of irradiated Fe2O3 surface. For precise surfaces with either an O vacancy, an Fe vacancy or both O and Fe vacancies, the water layers move further away at an average distance of 3.51, 3.39, and 3.54 Å from the top of the surface, respectively. This implies that the surfaces with vacancies show greater hydrophobicity. The simulation results corroborate with the experimental contact angle measurements.

In order to understand why the surface does not become fully superhydrophobic and remains at an intermediate state, we need to understand the competitive role of the surface roughness developed due to ion irradiation and the change in surface chemistry due to defect formation. Following irradiation, each nanotube is likely to develop a rough surface, which is predicted in the TRI3DYN simulations. Such a surface can behave like the surface of a rose petal,68 which leads to the partial adhesive nature of the surface and pulls the droplet down. For the irradiated surface with the highest fluence, our measurements revealed that the droplet starts to roll off at a titling angle of 15° (Fig. 7(d)), and the contact angle hysteresis is found to be about 30°. Such a surface may behave like an “adhesive Cassie”-type surface.68,69 The water contact angle on the irradiated surface was calculated theoretically using the Cassie model by considering the average pore diameter of 50 nm (Fig. 1(c)) and a thickness of 1.01 μm for the nano-network, yielding a contact angle of about 92°, which is within the range of observed angles in Fig. 7(b). Therefore, modification of both the morphology and the surface chemistry leads to overcoming the superhydrophilic nature of the surface and making it water-repelling.
In addition, the current–voltage characteristics of both the pristine and irradiated samples revealed a drastic improvement in the electrical conductivity (see Fig. S6 in ESI†). The conductivity increases linearly with increasing ion fluence. The electrical conductivity of the pristine sample was measured to be 1.09 S m−1. The conductivity was increased to about three-fold (3.01 S m−1 in the case of the sample irradiated at the ion fluence of 5 × 1016 ions cm−2) for irradiated samples. Such an increase in the electrical conductivity may be possible because of the formation of inter-connected hematite nanostructures, which enable efficient percolation and electron transport through the nano-network.
4. Conclusion
The presented work deals with a detailed study of the wetting behavior of a hematite nano-network induced using low-energy (5 keV) ion irradiation. Ar+ ion irradiation at a higher fluence leads to the formation of solid mechanical joints among the nanorods, leaving behind the porous structure that is expected to have an enhanced surface-to-volume ratio. Using low-energy ion irradiation, surface defects are realized with both O and Fe vacancies, where there are more for O vacancies due to preferential sputtering. Through TRI3DYN simulations, such changes are successfully predicted. Ar+ ion irradiation tunes the superhydrophilic nature of the hematite nanostructures to showing hydrophobic behavior. The role of defect states in the enhancement of the water contact angle is understood through the X-ray photoelectron study, which is further predicted through DFT simulations. Both Fe and O vacancies lower the binding of the water layers with the surface.
This study is unique and opens up the scope to explore hydrophobic hematite nanostructures as an electron-transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), to improve the PCE as well as the stability issue related to humidity and moisture.
