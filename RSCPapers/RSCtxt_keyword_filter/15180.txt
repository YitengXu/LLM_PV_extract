    , Accepted 12th February 2009First published on 2nd March 2009AbstractA novel class of organic D–π–A dyes employing a N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenylbenzidine (TPD) unit as donor was designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells, which achieved a solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 5.63% in preliminary tests as compared to 6.42% for N3 dye under the same experimental conditions.
Energy demands and environmental pollution resulting in global warming have led to an intense focus all over the world on renewable energy sources over the past decades. Since the first report in 1991 by Grätzel and coworkers,1dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cells (DSSCs) based on organic optoelectronic materials have received ever-increasing attention as potential alternatives to traditional inorganic photovoltaic devices.2 These cells are usually composed of a wide band gap TiO2 semiconductor deposited on a transparent conducting substrate, an anchored molecular sensitizer and a redox electrolyte. DSSCs based on Ru-complex photosensitizers such as N33 and black dye4 can provide efficient solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) up to 11% at simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation.5 In recent years, interest in organic dyes as an alternative to noble metal complexes has increased due to many advantages, such as diversity of molecular structures, high molar extinction coefficient, simple synthesis as well as low cost and environmental issues. Metal free organic dyes such as squaraine,6 merocyanine,7 indoline,8fluorene,9coumarin10 and triphenylamine11 organic dyes have been developed and show promising performances.
In this paper, we prepared a novel series of organic dyes which contain a N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenylbenzidine (TPD) unit as electron donor and cyanoacrylic acid as electron acceptor/anchoring group bridged by thiophene, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), benzene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, coded as DT, DE, DP and DT, respectively (Scheme 1). TPD derivatives with highly efficient hole-transporting ability have been applied extensively as optoelectronic materials in organic photoconductors, organic light-emitting diodes, organic field effect transistors and organic solar cells.12 Very recently, Sun et al. reported a novel 2TPA-Rdye which consists of two triphenylamine (TPA) units connected with a vinyl group.13 Their studies suggested that the two conjugated TPAs in the dye could produce the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and energy transfer (EnT) processes that have a positive effect on the performance of DSSCs. Unfortunately this 2TPA-Rdye only achieved lower maximum IPCE values and 2.3% of overall conversion efficiency. In the course of constructing new organic dyes, we chose a highly-branched TPD molecule as donor unit. This would make the organic dyes more rigid and nonplanar to effectively decrease aggregation and have good solubility in common organic solvents.
 Scheme 1  The structures of the TPD-based dyes. 
The TPD-based dyes can be easily synthesized in moderate yields using cheap raw materials by well-known organic reactions including the Vilsmeier, Wittig–Horner, Heck and Knoevenagel reactions. The synthetic procotols and characterizations of these dyes are provided in the ESI.†
The absorption, emission, and electrochemical properties of the four as-synthesized dyes are listed in Table 1. Fig. 1(a) shows the UV–vis spectra of the dyes in THF solutions. Their absorption spectra have two absorption maxima in the ultraviolet region of 340–350 nm and visible light region of 440–520 nm. The two high molar extinction coefficient absorption bands are in favor of light-harvesting and hence photocurrent generation in DSSCs. Moreover, the dyeDE bearing EDOT as electron linker shows a significant red shift in the long-wavelength band compared with that of dyesDT, DP and DT. The wavelength of dyeDP is much shorter compared with the other three dyes, possibly due to the electron deficiency of π-linker with benzene relative to the other thiophene moieties. Absorbed on TiO2 films (Fig. 1b), the absorption maxima of these dyes are blue shifted by 17, 18, 6 and 11 nm for DT, DE, DP and DT, respectively, in comparison to those in solution. Such a phenomenon was also found in other organic dyes.14

To obtain and understand the molecular orbital energy levels, oxidation potentials of the dyes in DMF solutions were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemistry data are demonstrated in Table 1.
The oxidation potentials (Eox) of the as-synthesized dyes, corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, fall in the range between 1.04 (DE) and 1.10 (DP) V vs. NHE. From these data, we found the HOMO levels of these dyes to be sufficiently more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE),15 indicating that the oxidized dyes formed after electron injection into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 could thermodynamically accept electrons from I− to provide enough driving force for an efficient regeneration to the neutral sensitizer state. The reduction potentials of the dyes (Ered), which can be obtained from the oxidation potential and the E0–0 value determined from the intercept of absorption and emission spectra, namely Eox − E0–0, were sufficiently more negative (−1.16 to −1.36 V vs. NHE) than the CB energy level of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),15 implying electron injection into the CB of TiO2 to be feasible.
The photovoltaic properties of these dyes in DSSCs are shown in Table 2 and J–V curves of the dyes are demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). We achieved an η value of 5.63% (short-circuit photocurrent density Jsc = 10.45 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage Voc = 701 mV, and fill factor ff = 0.81) and 4.34% (Jsc = 8.85 mA cm−2, Voc = 639 mV, and fill factor ff = 0.76) for DSSCs based on dyesDE and DT, respectively. Relatively lower η values of 3.60% and 2.07% were detected from dyesDP and DT, respectively. Under the same measuring conditions, the Ru dye N3-sensitized TiO2 showed an efficiency of 6.42% with a Jsc of 15.38 mA cm−2, a Voc of 621 mV, and a ff of 0.67. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of these dyes in DSSCs were also measured and are shown in Fig. 2(b). The onset of the IPCE spectrum for the DE-based device is ∼750 nm, which is significantly broadened compared to the absorption spectrum of the dye absorbed on TiO2 (Fig. 1b),16 and high IPCE performance (>70%) was observed from 470 to 580 nm, with the highest value of 79% at 520 nm. In contrast, despite the onset of the IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on dyesDP and DT being nearly equal to that of DE, they demonstrated lower IPCEs with a maximum of 45% at 480 nm. The lower IPCE values for DP and DT reflect relatively lower photocurrent and hence inferior photovoltaic performance.

To get further insight into the molecular structure and electron distribution of dyeDE, its geometry was optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31+G (D) level. Fig. 3 shows the electron distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of dyeDE. The HOMO is delocalized over the π system with the highest electron density located at the two nitrogen atoms of the TPD moiety, while the LUMO is located in the anchoring group through the π bridge. Thus, the HOMO–LUMO excitation induced by light irradiation could move the electron distribution from the whole molecule to the anchoring moiety.

In summary, we have molecularly engineered a novel class of TPD-based organic dyes, yielding a 5.63% power conversion efficiency under the standard AM 1.5 solar conditions, as compared to 6.42% for N3 dye under the same experimental conditions. Both further optimization of the device processing and structural modification of these dyes are anticipated to give even better performances. This work would lead to the development of more new organic dyes usable in DSSCs for high photoelectrical performances.
