    , Accepted 25th June 2018First published on 27th June 2018AbstractHalide perovskite-based photodetectors, because of their fundamental scientific importance and practical applications in the military and civil fields, have drawn worldwide attention in recent years. However, the toxicity and instability issues are major challenges for their mass production and commercialization. In this study, for the first time, we report the use of the one-step spin-coating method for the preparation of lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films for photodetector applications. The morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties of the as-grown Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were first investigated. Further, symmetrically structured photoconductive detectors were fabricated and characterized. The device performance was remarkable in terms of a high responsivity of 7.01 A W−1, an on/off photocurrent ratio of 2.16 × 104, a specific detectivity of 5.66 × 1011 Jones, an external quantum efficiency of 2146%, and a fast response speed of 956/995 μs. More importantly, the unencapsulated photodetectors demonstrate remarkable operational stability over the aging test (36 h, 35–45% humidity), and the photodetection ability can be almost maintained. Moreover, after storage for two weeks in ambient air, the proposed photodetectors can be efficiently sustained, demonstrating remarkable stability against water and oxygen degradation. Our results indicate that lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 is potentially an environmentally friendly alternative to fabricate high-efficiency and stable perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.
Introduction
Recently, the newly emerging halide perovskites, in particular organometal halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I), have attracted scientific attention due to their great capabilities in cost-effective and large-scale manufacturing in optoelectronic devices.1–6 This upsurge was initially driven by perovskite solar cells, which achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of above 22% in the short term.7 In addition to photovoltaic devices, CH3NH3PbX3 materials in the form of thin films, nanocrystals, or micro/nanowires have been demonstrated to be ideal candidates for other electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes, lasers, photodetectors, memristors, etc.8–17 Compared to the intensive efforts on solar cells and luminescence fields, the investigation of CH3NH3PbX3 perovskites as light absorbers in photodetectors is relatively less intensive, and there is still a lack of significant breakthroughs that could propel perovskite-based photodetectors into the commercialization stage. Despite the stunning progress that has been made in high-performance device fabrication with perovskite materials, their toxicity and environmental instability have cast a gloomy shadow over their application potency.18–20 Thus, there is a pressing need to address these major hurdles in the path of the commercial deployment of perovskite-based photodetectors. It is well known that organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites suffer rapid deterioration once exposed to ambient air, but all-inorganic perovskites exhibit superior stability along with all the excellent properties inherited from their hybrid perovskite counterparts,21–23 and some studies have recognized that replacing methylammonium with inorganic cesium offers the perovskites extra thermal stability up to their melting at ∼500 °C.24 Therefore, searching for alternative all-inorganic perovskites that are Pb-free and non-toxic is a promising research direction. By now, several promising candidate materials have been identified, primarily via theoretical predictions, and only a few among them have been synthesized successfully.25–30 In this context, Sn(II)-based inorganic halide perovskites have become the research focus because the metal Sn shares a similar diameter and electron structure to Pb. Typically, Sn(II)-based perovskite solar cells have achieved a promising power conversion efficiency of 8.12%.31 However, the Sn2+ ion is unstable in perovskites; it is very difficult to make Sn2+-based lead-free perovskites with good intrinsic stability together with solution processibility for optoelectronic device applications at present. A recent approach towards lead-free perovskite materials is the substitution of two divalent Pb2+ ions with one monovalent M+ and one trivalent M3+ ion, forming a Cs2M+M3+X6 double perovskite structure named elpasolite, which provides rich substitutional chemistry and promising optoelectronic properties.32 In main group elements, only the trivalent Bi3+ cation possesses the same electronic configuration as Pb2+, and Bi-based Cs2AgBiX6 single crystals have been experimentally characterized and exhibited attractive features, including long carrier recombination lifetimes and excellent stability.33,34 More recently, lead-free perovskite solar cells based on Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films have been successfully fabricated with a maximum conversion efficiency of 2.5%.35 However, so far there has been no relevant report on Cs2AgBiX6 thin film-based photodetectors as far as we know.
In this communication, for the first time, we have demonstrated lead-free perovskite photodetectors using double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films as light absorbers, which were synthesized by the one-step spin-coating method. The device performance was remarkable in terms of a high responsivity of 7.01 A W−1, an on/off photocurrent ratio of 2.16 × 104, a specific detectivity of 5.66 × 1011 Jones, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2146%, and a fast response speed of 956/995 μs. More importantly, the proposed Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetectors without encapsulation demonstrate remarkable operational stability over the aging test (36 h continuous operation) in ambient air, and the photodetection ability can be almost maintained. In addition, it was also observed that the proposed photodetectors can almost retain their photoresponse properties after storage under ambient conditions for two weeks. These results demonstrate that lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6, as a new kind of perovskite material, has great potential for photodetection applications.
Experimental
In this experiment, double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were synthesized by the one-step spin-coating approach. A mixture of CsBr (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp., ≥99.99%), AgBr (Aladdin, ≥99.9%) and BiBr3 (≥98%) in a molar ratio of 2:1:1 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to form a supersaturated precursor solution with a calculated concentration of 0.5 mol L−1. After complete dissolution of the precursors, both the precursor solution and the substrate were preheated to 80 °C before spin-coating. Fig. 1 shows the main processing steps of photoconductive detectors. The fabrication procedure started with a commercially available Si/SiO2 substrate (Fig. 1a), which was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 10 min, respectively. Then Au electrodes were patterned by photolithography on the Si/SiO2 substrate (Fig. 1b), and the fingers of the Au contact electrodes were 360 μm long and 10 μm wide with a spacing of 5 μm. After the process, 100 μL of the hot precursor solution was spin-coated under conditions involving a low-speed spinning at 500 rpm for 5 s and then a fast-speed spinning at 2000 rpm for 30 s in a glovebox (Fig. 1c). The subsequent drying procedure was slowly vacuumized to 5 Pa and kept undisturbed for 20 min to evaporate the solvent and achieve a better coverage (Fig. 1d). Then, the sample was annealed at 285 °C for 5 min to improve the crystallinity of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films as well as increase the contact adhesion between the semiconductor and metal (Fig. 1e). Fig. 1f displays the corresponding photographs of the fabricated Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetectors.
 Fig. 1  (a–f) Processing procedures for the fabrication of Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetectors. 
The microstructures of the produced Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Jeol-7500F, 15 keV). The elemental composition and distribution of the thin films were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) coupled to SEM. The crystallinity was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X’Pert Pro). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were recorded using a double grating spectrofluorometer (Horiba; Fluorolog-3). Steady-state absorption spectra were acquired with a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer using an integrating sphere. The time-resolved PL measurement was performed using a fluorescence lifetime measurement system with a pulsed LED (Horiba; NanoLED, pulse duration: 1.2 ns) as the light source operating at 404 nm. The electrical and optoelectrical measurements were done using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS) with a system that combines a monochromator, light sources, an oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO2012B), an optical chopper (SRS, SR540), and a digital SourceMeter (Keithley 2636B) in air and at room temperature (RT).

Fig. 2a presents a typical SEM image of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films, which display a somewhat rough surface but with a high surface coverage, and the average grain size is determined to be ∼100 nm. Note that many undesired pinholes exist in the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films (marked by yellow circles in Fig. 2a), but they do not penetrate throughout the entire Cs2AgBiBr6 layer. The reason for the formation of such pinholes is primarily the restricted diffusivity of the perovskite precursor in the solvent drying stage during spin-coating.36 EDS measurements were then performed to investigate the chemical composition and distribution of the Cs2AgBiBr6 products. As shown in Fig. 2b, it is apparent that the Cs, Ag, Bi and Br elements are uniformly distributed throughout the selected region (marked by a red square in Fig. 2a). Fig. 2c shows the corresponding EDS spectrum, and no other chemical impurities were detected except for the well-known compositions, and the incorporated Cs, Ag, Bi and Br elements have a molar ratio of 2.05:1:1:5.87, which is quite close to the nominal ratio given by the stoichiometry of the precursor solutions. The formation and structural characteristics of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were further confirmed by the XRD 2θ pattern shown in Fig. 2d. The characteristic and dominant diffraction peaks at 13.84°, 15.95°, 22.55°, 27.63°, 31.97°, 35.78°, 39.36° and 45.68° could be assigned to the (111), (002), (022), (222), (004), (024), (224) and (044) planes of crystalline Cs2AgBiBr6, suggesting the formation of a cubic perovskite structure (space group Fmm, a = 11.2640 Å), consistent with the simulated value obtained for the Cs2AgBiBr6 powder. To evaluate the optical properties of the Cs2AgBiBr6 products, both ultraviolet-visible absorption and steady-state PL spectra were characterized at RT. As shown in Fig. 2e, there are two parts in the absorption spectrum, a very weak indirect absorption band between 500 and 600 nm involving a photon-assisted process, and an excitonic absorption band in the region from 419 to 500 nm, similar to the observations in other studies.34,35,37 The red dotted line shows the corresponding steady-state PL spectrum of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films, which features a symmetric emission peak centered at 591 nm with a linewidth of 102.1 nm. The broad PL signal is most likely caused by the defects and/or excitonic effects.38 To gain more insights into the carrier recombination dynamics of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films, the time-resolved PL measurement was performed. As shown in Fig. 2f, the PL decay from the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films can be fitted with a two-exponential fitting, and an average PL decay lifetime of 69 ns was determined. Such a relatively large radiative lifetime implies a low concentration of trap states at the surface and/or inside of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films, rendering more time to collect and transport photogenerated carriers in the photodetectors.

To investigate the potential applications of such Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films in photoelectric response, a photoconductive detector was fabricated with a coplanar metal–semiconductor–metal interdigitated patterned Au electrode configuration. Fig. 3a presents the energy band diagram of the Au/Cs2AgBiBr6/Au structure, which shows the processes of generation, transfer, and collection of photogenerated carriers. Under illumination, when the energy of the incident illumination is larger than that of the semiconductor bandgap, the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films absorb photons to generate a large number of electron–hole pairs because of the photoelectric effect. Under an external electric field, the photogenerated electron and hole carriers were rapidly separated and further collected by the opposite contact electrodes. Thus, the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetectors can work effectively and the photocurrent increases gradually with light illumination and electric field intensity. Even though there exists a relatively low Schottky contact barrier at the Au/Cs2AgBiBr6 interface, a slightly low external bias can effectively compensate for the energy barrier, and thus the photogenerated carrier transport or conduction from Cs2AgBiBr6 to the metal contact electrodes takes place, thereby increasing the photocurrent drastically. In order to evaluate the selectivity of the studied Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetector to incident light, the spectral response in the 300–800 nm range was measured and is displayed in Fig. 3b. It can be seen that the device displays an excellent wavelength selectivity with the maximum responsivity value located at a wavelength of ∼510 nm. But when the wavelength increases from 510 to 900 nm and decreases from 510 nm to 300 nm, the sensitivity of the device to light illumination sharply decreases. Therefore, in the subsequent measurement, an excitation light wavelength of 520 nm was employed as the light source. Fig. 3c depicts the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the device in the dark and under light illumination. With increase of illumination power from 0 to 13.63 mW, the photocurrent of the device gradually increases because of the fact that the amount of photogenerated carriers is proportional to the absorbed photon flux. Moreover, the dependence of the photocurrent on the light illumination power can be fitted well by the power law I = m·Pμ, in which m is a proportional constant for a given wavelength, P represents the incident light illumination power, and μ determines the response of the photocurrent to the light intensity. The best fitting gives a sublinear behavior of μ = 0.76, as shown in Fig. 3d. This fractional power dependence (0.5 < μ < 1.0) is presumably a result of the complex process of electron–hole generation, recombination, and trapping within a semiconductor.39

Time-dependent photoresponses of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetector at different (g) light illumination powers and (h) bias voltages. 
Photoresponsivity (R) is the measure of the photocurrent generated per unit power of incident light per area, and the R of the photodetector can be calculated using the equation: R = (Ip − Id)/Popt·S(1)where Ip is the photocurrent, Id is the dark current, Popt is the incident light intensity, and S is the effective illuminated area (2.0 × 10−6 cm2 in the present case). Fig. 3e shows the relationship of the photoresponsivity with the incident irradiance power, and it was found to be 7.01 A W−1 for R at 0.0143 mW. Upon increasing the light illumination power to 4.33 mW and above, the photoresponsivity decays and is finally maintained at a steady value of 0.4 A W−1. It is also noteworthy that when we reduce the light power or have a smaller device area, the photodetector will have a higher photoresponsivity. Besides, the specific detectivity (D*) and the EQE of the proposed photodetector were calculated according to the following relations:40 (2) (3)where A is the effective area of the sample, f is the electrical bandwidth, NEP is the noise equivalent power, in is the noise current, h and c are Planck's constant and the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the excitation light. According to eqn (2) and (3), we calculated the D* and EQE, and the corresponding data are summarized in Fig. 3f. One can see that D* and EQE decrease with increase of irradiance power, and the highest value can be estimated to be 5.66 × 1011 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) and 2146%, respectively.
Temporal photoresponse is one of the critical performance parameters of photodetectors. Fig. 3g shows the time-dependent photoresponses (I–T) of the studied Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetector at a fixed bias voltage of 5 V, where light illumination with a successive on/off switch was employed and the turn on/off time of the incident light was kept at 20 s. From the figure a prompt and reproducible photocurrent response with good cycling stability can be observed, and the photocurrent increases upon increasing the light irradiance power from 0.62 mW to 12.65 mW. In addition, we also measured the I–T curves of the photodetector at different bias voltages, in which the power of the incident light was maintained at 4.63 mW and the bias voltage was changed from 1 V to 7 V. As shown in Fig. 3h, the photocurrent sharply increases with increasing bias voltage because of the increase in the carrier drift velocity of photogenerated charge carriers at a high bias voltage, and in an extremely brief period the photocurrent increases by several orders of magnitude. The current reversibly switched between high and low conductances with high stability and repeatability when the light was turned on and off, indicating a good light switching behavior of the studied photodetector. Note that the on/off photocurrent ratio of the studied photodetector is 2.16 × 104, much higher than those of other reported perovskite-based photodetectors with a similar metal–semiconductor–metal structure.13,41–43 The high on/off photocurrent ratio can ensure the accuracy of the photodetector to detect a relatively weak light signal.
The response speed is another important characteristic parameter for a photodetector, particularly for that utilized in optical communication, imaging, and so on, which reflects its ability to follow a fast varying optical signal. In our case, we used a mechanical chopper to switch the incident light with different frequencies, and the photocurrent signals were recorded using an oscilloscope, and the experimental setup is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4a. As shown in Fig. 4b–d, the characteristic response times of the studied photodetector are extracted at different modulation frequencies of 50, 100, and 300 Hz, respectively. By normalizing the photocurrent according to the highest photocurrent, one can observe that the device can operate with excellent stability and reproducibility over a wide frequency range. In addition, according to the photocurrent response profile recorded at 50 and 500 Hz, the rise time (TR: from 10% to 90% of the saturated value) and the fall time (TF: from 90% to 10% of the peak value) of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetector were extracted. As shown in Fig. 4e, the TR and TF values are obtained to be 5.77/5.97 ms at 50 Hz, and a fast response speed of 956/995 μs was obtained at 500 Hz (Fig. 4f), which proves that the photodetector has the ability to follow fast varying optical signals. In reality, there is still room for improvement in the device performance because the morphology of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films could be optimized further. Owing to the existence of undesired pinholes, the photogenerated carriers could be trapped quickly by the undesired trap states. Therefore, further improving the film quality and maintaining the integrity of the Cs2AgBiBr6 light absorber is an important pursuit and also a worthwhile subject for further promotion of the device performance.

It is well known that the long-term operational stability for perovskite-based optoelectronic devices has always been a challenge, especially for organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, which are characterized by poor stability against environmental oxygen/moisture.44–46 In most cases, the unstable hybrid perovskites decomposed easily because of the hygroscopic amine salts, and such a chemical reaction process is irreversible, even if the resulting device is dried again, leading to a degradation in the device performance and limiting its practical application. To further demonstrate the long-term operational stability of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetector, the photocurrent of the unencapsulated device as a function of running time was monitored, in which a continuous bias voltage of 2 V was applied and a light irradiation power of 0.4 mW was fixed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the photocurrent gradually increased in the initial period (5 h) of the running test. Such an interesting photocurrent enhancement behavior may be due to the “photoactivation” phenomenon, which presumably originates from the removal of dangling bonds or undesired surface defects by highly energetic photons, favoring an improved carrier transport ability. For the next running test from 5 to 36 h under continuous light illumination, the photocurrent demonstrated a steady decline, but with a slightly small decay amplitude. Despite this, the measured photocurrent of the studied device after being operated for 36 h was still higher than its starting value. The results indicate that the proposed Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetector shows remarkable working stability, and also suggest that the lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 can be employed as an effective light absorber for stable photodetector applications. As for the undesired photocurrent decay during the running test, one possibility of increased structural defects induced by the heating effect ought to bear mostly liability. Theoretically, an increased heating effect would be generated in the photodetector working continuously for a long time, and thus the temperature of the device would increase, which would inevitably induce a rapid proliferation of structural defects. Under this circumstance, the photogenerated carriers could be trapped quickly by the undesired trap states, causing the decay of photocurrent accordingly. More importantly, the present device can retain nearly identical photocurrent and work properly even after two weeks storage under ambient conditions (Fig. 5b), without any encapsulation and protection, greatly superior to previously reported organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite-based photodetectors with poor stability.46–50 Understandably, an all-inorganic structure obtained by replacing methylammonium with inorganic cesium offers the perovskites extra stability, and thus the lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 can endure long-term exposure to ambient conditions. The environmental stability of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films was further confirmed by the XRD measurement before and after two weeks storage. As shown in Fig. 5c, all of the diffraction peaks correspond to the diffractions from the cubic Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films, and no other parasitic peaks were detected except for a slight change in peak intensity, which indicated that the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films could maintain their phase purity for two weeks, that was to say, their superior intrinsic/environmental stability. In addition, the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films show remarkable material stability against heat and light in open air, which has been confirmed by the thermal cycling measurements in the 20–120 °C temperature range and the photostability test under continuous ultraviolet light irradiation. The remarkable operational stability together with the good device performance suggested that the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were effective and reliable building blocks for photodetector applications, and will render the present environmentally friendly photodetectors potentially useful for the assembly of optoelectronic systems in the future.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a solution-processed synthesis of lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films. Further, metal–semiconductor–metal type photodetectors were fabricated and characterized. The studied device exhibits a high responsivity of 7.01 A W−1, an on/off photocurrent ratio of 2.16 × 104, a specific detectivity of 5.66 × 1011 Jones, an EQE of 2146%, and a fast response speed of 956/995 μs. More importantly, the proposed Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film photodetectors without encapsulation demonstrate remarkable operational stability over the aging test in ambient air. Moreover, after storage for 2 weeks in ambient air, the proposed photodetectors can be efficiently sustained, demonstrating remarkable stability against water and oxygen degradation, greatly superior to photodetectors constructed with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. Our results highlight the great potential of lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 as an environmentally friendly alternative for future photodetection applications.
