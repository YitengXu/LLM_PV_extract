    , Accepted 21st July 2017First published on 4th August 2017AbstractHerein, we report the impact of single- and co-doping of nanoparticle TiO2 films with carbon and nitrogen on the photovoltaic characteristics of their corresponding dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) devices. Different DSCs with various compositions of the photoanode electrodes are fabricated to study their structural and electronic properties by X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We find that the interstitial nitrogen atoms for single N doping have a greater impact on the band gap energy (Eg) than the substitutional (to Ti) carbon atoms for single C doping. The short circuit current and efficiency of DSCs are enhanced by C and N single- and co-doping with dominant impression of carbon doping. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements reveal that the electron lifetime, charge transport and recombination resistance of DSCs are improved by C and N single- and co-doping with prominent impact of carbon doping. Therefore, we achieve the highest cell efficiency of 10.2% as a result of a balance between the band gap, surface area, and diffused reflection of the photoanode electrode.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), introduced by O'Regan and Gratzel,1 soon became a great option to substitute conventional Si-based solar cells because of their high efficiency and low cost of materials and manufacturing. Moreover, DSC devices can be prepared in various forms such as flexible, bioderived photoanodes and polymer electrolytes.2 Application of TiO2 nanoparticles as the photoanode of DSCs whether in their pure form or doped type has been widely studied in recent years. There are several bases for selecting TiO2 from a wide range of semiconductor oxides, such as its low-cost, nontoxicity and biocompatibility, for solar cell applications. In addition, it shows two different characteristics of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity for DSC applications.3 Among its three main allotropes, including anatase, rutile and brookite, the best photovoltaic performance is expected from the anatase structure due to its active surface energy, high electron mobility and large band gap energy.4
In order to make DSCs commercially viable, it is necessary to improve their energy conversion efficiency. Many efforts have been made towards improving the energy conversion efficiency of TiO2 solar cells using metal ions as dopants such as Nb, Sn, Cr, W and Zn.5 In addition, doped TiO2 with non-metal dopants such as carbon and nitrogen has shown great potential as the photoanode for DSCs.6 The photovoltaic improvement of N-doped TiO2 is due to the enhanced electron lifetime as a result of O–Ti–N formation which retards the recombination reaction.7 Moreover, doping with nitrogen broadens the range of the visible light response effectively.8 The enhanced cell efficiency of C-doped TiO2 is due to improved charge transfer from the bulk to surface of TiO2 where the oxidation reactions take place.9 Furthermore, carbon stabilizes the anatase crystal structure and enhances the visible light response of TiO2.10 So far, no comparative study has been carried out on the photovoltaic characteristics of DSCs made of carbon and nitrogen single- and co-doped TiO2.
Pure and doped TiO2 nanoparticles are generally prepared via different methods such as sol–gel processes, hydrothermal/solvothermal processes, ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, laser-assisted pyrolysis, co-precipitation and anodization. Sol–gel and hydrothermal techniques offer important advantages over other methods, including excellent compositional control, lower synthesis cost and control over the morphology of the product.
In this work, we synthesized three different TiO2 nanoparticles (i.e., N-doped, C-doped and N,C-co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles) by a combination of sol–gel and hydrothermal methods. These nanoparticles were used for the preparation of the photoanode electrode of DSCs and the impact of the dopant configuration on the photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells was studied. Moreover, the effect of dopant concentration on the electronic band structure of the synthesized nanoparticles was studied.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles
TiO2 nanoparticles with an anatase structure and particle size in the 15–30 nm range were synthesized via a process similar to a procedure reported before.11 This procedure was a combination of sol–gel and solvothermal methods. Titanium isopropoxide (TIP) with a purity of 97% (Aldrich, UK) and 1-octanol with a purity of 99% (Merck, Germany) were used as the titanium precursor and solvent, respectively. Briefly, TIP was dissolved in 1-octanol to form a 0.55 M transparent precursor solution. Deionized water was added next to the solution slowly with a [H2O]:Ti ratio of 3.3:1 to form a TiO2 sol. The sol was stirred for 30 min so that the hydrolysis and condensation took place. The prepared sol was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at a filling ratio of 70%, heated at 180 °C for 4 h and cooled naturally to room temperature. The collected precipitates (i.e., anatase–TiO2 nanoparticles) were washed with dilute ethanol and deionized water several times and dried at room temperature.
2.2. Synthesis of C and N single- and co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by single- and co-doping with nitrogen and carbon using the hydrothermal/solvothermal method analogous to a procedure reported previously.12 Ammonium hydroxide 25% (Merck, Germany) and 1-butanol with a purity of 99.5% (Merck, Germany) were used as nitrogen and carbon dopants, respectively. A mixture of 0.8 g of TiO2 nanoparticles and appropriate amounts of the carbon and nitrogen precursors was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel. The autoclave was heated at 100 °C for 4 h. The resulting precipitates were collected and washed with dilute ethanol and deionized water and finally dried at room temperature.
2.3. Preparation of photoanode electrodes
TiO2 paste was prepared using synthesized powders, the solvent and a binder as is reported elsewhere.13 Five different pastes with various compositions composed of pristine TiO2 and C and N single- and co-doped TiO2 were prepared and coated onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (with a sheet resistance of 7 Ω sq−1). The spin coating parameters were controlled to obtain the desired thickness of 19 μm. Before deposition, the substrates were cleaned with acetone and ethanol and then subjected to ultrasound treatment. After coating, the films were dried at 60 °C and finally annealed at 400 °C for 2 h in air. The freshly sintered electrodes were post-treated with TiCl4 solution and then annealed again at 450 °C for 30 min.
2.4. DSC fabrication
The resulting electrodes were immersed in 0.5 mM ruthenium(II) dye (Ruthenium 535-bis TBA dye, or N719, Solaronix) solution (using ethanol as a solvent) for 18 h. After washing the electrodes with ethanol, they were dried and used instantly for photovoltaic measurements. The redox electrolyte composition was 0.6 M dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.05 M 4-tetrabutylpyrydine in acetonitrile. A platinum-coated FTO substrate was prepared as a counter electrode. This platinum electrode was placed on top of the dye-absorbed electrode. Afterwards, the edges of the cell were sealed using a sealing sheet (SX 1170-60, Solaronix) and completed by hot-pressing these two electrodes together at 120 °C. Finally, the redox electrolyte was injected into the cell through the small holes and sealed with a small square sealing sheet. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the fabricated solar cells.

2.5. Characterization and measurements
In order to characterize the photoanode electrodes, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) techniques were used with the help of X'Pert Pro MPD and Mira 3-XMU devices. The thickness of the electrodes was determined with a Tencor Alpha-Step Profiler and using FE-SEM cross sectional images. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements of the films were recorded using an AvaSpec-2048-TEC spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used as a means for doping verification with the help of a ABB-Bomem device. The absorption of N719 dye molecules on the surface of the photoelectrodes was studied using a 6705 JENWAY, UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The specific surface area and pore volume of the nanoparticles were calculated by nitrogen absorption, from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) equations at 77.35 K using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 analyzer. With the help of a Zahner Cimps pcs solar simulator (Zahner, Kronach, Germany) the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated solar cells were measured under standard test conditions (STC, i.e., irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, AM-1.5 spectrum) using a Si cell as a reference. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the DSCs were carried out with the same equipment as the solar simulator under AM-1.5G illuminated conditions. EIS measurements were carried out under an open circuit potential with an oscillation potential amplitude of 10 mV from 0.01 to 106 Hz. The cells were studied in a two-electrode configuration with 10 steps per decade above 66 Hz and a lower limit of four. EIS spectra were simulated using ZView software.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microstructure

Fig. 1 illustrates the FE-SEM images of the synthesized nanoparticles. It is evident that all samples have uniform and homogeneous particles in the 60–130 nm range with a smooth and spherical shape. Moreover, the doping process with carbon and nitrogen has no influence on the morphology of the samples. The cross-sectional view of the NT electrode is shown in Fig. 2. The thickness was controlled with spin coating parameters and the desired uniform thickness of ∼19 μm was achieved. The thickness of the remaining electrodes was also controlled to be the same value as that of the T cell.

3.2. Crystal structure
The band gap energy and photovoltaic properties of the TiO2 DSC are dependent on its crystal structure. The influence of dopants and their configuration on the crystal structure of the nanoparticles are studied by XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 3. All samples have a pure anatase crystal structure with the strongest peak around 2θ = 25.6° (1 0 1). As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 3, a slight shift to greater angles is detected for the doped nanoparticles due to the smaller ionic radii of C4+ and N3+ (i.e., 30 pm) compared with Ti4+ (i.e., 74.5 pm) O2− (i.e., 126 pm). The average crystallite size of the nanopowders is calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation as follows:14  where d is the crystallite size, k is a constant with a value of 0.9, λ is the X-ray wavelength which here is 1.5406 Å (Cu-kα), θ is the Bragg angle in degrees and B is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak. The average crystallite size of pristine TiO2 is around 12 nm, while it is about 7 nm for the doped nanoparticles. This is consistent with the broader peak of the doped nanoparticles compared with that of pristine TiO2 (inset of Fig. 3).

3.3. XPS analysis

Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectrum of an NCT sample which is co-doped with carbon and nitrogen. The high resolution XPS spectra for C 1s, Ti 2p, O 1s, and N 1s are also shown in this figure. The spectrum for Ti 2p (Fig. 4b) depicts two peaks at 458.85 eV and 464.27 eV that originated from Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively.15 O 1s peaks in Fig. 4c can be fitted to a main peak at 530 eV and two minor peaks at 531.5 eV and 533.4 eV.16 The two minor peaks can be related to oxygen vacancies and surface contamination, respectively.17 For the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 4d) three peaks can be fitted including C–C bonds at 284.6 eV, CO bonds at 285.3 eV and C–O–Ti bonding energy at 288.7 eV. A small peak at 400.1 eV in Fig. 4e can be attributed to nitrogen doping.18

3.4. BET analysis
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of T and CT samples are presented in Fig. 5. According to IUPAC classification,19 the isotherm of pristine TiO2 nanoparticles represents a combination of types II and IV and corresponds to mesoporous materials (Fig. 5a). In addition, the pore size distribution diagram (inset of Fig. 5a) verifies the mesoporous structure, as it has a sharp peak around 2.4 nm pore size. C-doped TiO2 nanoparticles show an isotherm somewhat similar to pure TiO2. However, it can be specified precisely as type IV hysteresis and corresponds to a mesoporous material (Fig. 5b). The pore size distribution diagram (inset of Fig. 5b) indicates that all pores are less than 10 nm in size which is in good agreement with the primary analysis. According to Table 2, the specific surface areas of T and CT are measured to be 131 and 177 m2 g−1, respectively, which indicates that C-doped TiO2 nanoparticles have a much higher surface area than pristine TiO2. This result is in good agreement with the average crystallite size of the samples, as CT has a smaller crystallite size than T. It should be mentioned that both mesoporous samples have an upper size restriction since the adsorption and desorption branches are closed in the pressure region near saturation.

3.5. Diffuse reflectance spectral (DRS) analysis
We illustrate the Tauc plots of all samples that resulted from DRS analysis in Fig. 6. It is evident that the band gap energy (Eg) of pristine TiO2 is 3.30 eV and it decreases as a result of doping, being 3.22 eV for CT, 3.19 eV for CNT, 3.16 eV for NT and 3.15 eV for NCT. It has been reported that the substitutional C atom (to oxygen) produces two occupied and one empty localized states in the semiconductor and has no effect on the band gap energy, whereas substitutional C replacing a Ti atom causes a reduction in the band gap by 0.1 eV because of a shift of the top of the valence band, but does not introduce new states in the gap.20 Moreover, in the case of the interstitial C atom the gap is slightly wider than in the undoped material. Therefore, we conclude that the substitutional C atom (to Ti) occurs for C-doped TiO2. A previous study on N-doped TiO2 samples showed that a reduction of 0.2 eV and 0.4 eV was observed for the interstitial and substitutional N atoms, respectively.21 Based on the band gap energies of the NT and NCT samples, we deduce that the interstitial N atom arises for N-doped TiO2. According to our previous work,12 doping with nitrogen had a greater impact on the Eg value of the nanoparticles than carbon doping. The same result is also obtained in the present study since the NT and NCT samples have lower Eg values than CT and CNT. However, co-doping with nitrogen and carbon shows the highest influence on Eg reduction. Such a phenomenon has been reported before as a synergistic effect of the dopants.22 We observe that the scattering properties of all nanoparticles are almost the same, in particular at high wavelengths (Fig. 7). However, the inset of Fig. 7 shows that the C-doped TiO2 nanoparticles have a bit greater diffused reflection percentage than the pure and N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, no remarkable drop in the scattering of the nanoparticles is detected at wavelengths greater than 400 nm.

3.6. Photovoltaic performance of DSCs
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSCs are illustrated in Fig. 8. Besides, the corresponding photovoltaic data are shown in Table 3. We observe that the solar cell made of N-doped TiO2 has a lower open circuit voltage (VOC) than that composed of pristine TiO2, as a result of a smaller energy difference between the conduction band of the nanoparticles and the iodine redox potential. Furthermore, the maximum VOC, in theory, depends on the difference in the energy level between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the Fermi-level of TiO2. As mentioned in Section 3.5, the optical band gap energy of the TiO2 film was decreased by interstitial N impurities, resulting in a lower Fermi level potential of N-doped TiO2 than that of pristine TiO2. The VOC for the remaining cells is almost the same as that of the pristine TiO2 cell. This result is consistent with previous reports.23 It is obvious that the short circuit current (JSC) and efficiency (η) are increased as a result of interstitial N and substitutional C atoms. However, the C atoms have a greater impact on power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the N atoms since the CT and CNT cells exhibit higher PCEs than NT and NCT, respectively. Keeping in mind Fig. 9 such improvement in JSC and η can be attributed to the enhanced dye adsorption of the TiO2 cells doped with carbon and nitrogen, resulting in light harvesting and lower recombination of photogenerated electrons. The impact of substitutional C atoms on the hindrance of the recombination process and, therefore, the improvement of electrical conductivity are higher than those of interstitial N atoms. In addition, we conclude that the more carbon content in doped TiO2 nanoparticles, the more cell efficiency of DSCs, and the ranking is in the following order: CT > CNT > NCT > NT. Therefore, we achieve the highest PCE of 10.2% for DSCs composed of C-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (i.e., CT) amongst all fabricated DSCs. The most likely reasons for the enhanced efficiency of the CT cell in comparison to the T cell are as follows. CT showed a higher surface area than T, resulting in higher dye adsorption and more surface sites for photo-induced reactions.

Furthermore, DRS analysis showed that CT had a smaller band gap energy than T and, thus, could absorb a higher portion of photons. It should be mentioned that such a decrease in the band gap energy of the CT cell is in a critical near-Vis region which makes it much more effective. An EIS test (Section 3.7) also showed that CT had lower charge recombination, higher charge mobility and better transfer of electrons from the bulk to the surface. Another probable reason for the lower efficiency of the cells made of TiO2 doped with nitrogen (i.e., NT, NCT and CNT) compared with that made of TiO2 doped with carbon (i.e., CT) can be explained by the fact that interstitial nitrogen atoms may result in crystal structure deformation and reduce the charge mobility of the electrons. In contrast, substitutional (to Ti) C atoms have no influence on the crystal structure of C-doped TiO2.
3.7. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis
We study the electron transport rate and internal resistance of the DSCs using EIS analysis. Fig. 10 and 11 compare the EIS measurements in the Bode-phase representation and Nyquist plots for the fabricated DSCs. Since our main aim is to study the charge transport and recombination properties of the T, CT and NT cells we just focus on the middle frequency peak (i.e., 1–100 Hz) for the Bode-phase plots and main central arc for the Nyquist plots. These parts are associated with the inverse of the recombination time or electron lifetime and recombination resistance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, respectively.24
 Fig. 10  Bode plots of DSCs that resulted from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. 
 Fig. 11  Nyquist plots of fabricated DSCs that resulted from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. 
We find that the main characteristic frequency peaks of the Bode plots (Fig. 10) for the CT and NT electrodes are shifted towards lower frequencies, and the corresponding central arcs in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 11) become wider with respect to the T electrode. These results imply that the electron lifetime and recombination resistance of DSCs can be improved by doping TiO2 nanoparticles, and are in agreement with previous reports.7,25 In addition, the CT cell shows the lowest main Bode phase frequency peak and the largest Nyquist arc, indicating the longest electron lifetime and the highest retarded charge recombination amongst all DSCs. The performances of the CT and NT cells are further evaluated by fitting the experimental EIS data with an appropriate equivalent circuit and the exploited parameters are summarized in Table 4. There is a reasonable matching between the EIS experimental data and simulated plots for all DSCs, demonstrating a suitable model choice for a comprehensive description of the recombination process of photoinduced excitations occurring in the cells. The resistance element, Rs, in the high-frequency region, which can be obtained from the first real intercept on the Nyquist plot, is responsible for the sheet resistance of the FTO substrate. In this work, DSCs have almost similar Rs values, as the same FTO substrates are used to fabricate the devices. The large semicircle is fitted to a charge transfer resistance (Rct) and attributed to the combination of the parallel association of the charge-transfer resistance at the oxide/electrolyte interface (Rr) with the electron chemical capacitance (Cl), and the electron transport resistance of the oxide (Rt). The large semicircle is evidently larger for the CT cell than those of the T and NT cells, indicating that carbon and nitrogen doping may diminish the recombination process at the oxide/electrolyte interface. Therefore, both CT and NT electrodes have higher Rr and lower Rt than those of the T photoanode. However, the highest Rr and the lowest Rt are achieved for the CT cell, verifying the longest electron lifetime and the fastest charge transport through the photoanode/electrolyte interface. The recombination resistance values (Rr) are consistent with the VOC of the DSCs. The higher VOC, the greater recombination resistance, being 40.0 Ω for CT in comparison to 32.6 Ω and 35.1 Ω for T and NT, respectively. Since Rt is smaller than Rr, the normalized diffusion length  is greater than one. Once the thickness of the film is smaller than the diffusion length of the electrons, the lifetime is greater than the transit time. Such a condition is essential to efficiently collect the charge injected by dye. We estimate the electron lifetime (s) of the electrodes using the impedance plots as a function of frequency using τ = 1/ωmax, where ωmax is the peak frequency in the Rr region. The electron lifetime of the CT and NT cells is slightly higher than that of the T cell, indicating that the recombination rate of injected electrons is almost identical for CT and NT. Furthermore, we observe that the electron diffusion coefficient (D) of the electrodes is considerably improved by carbon doping, showing rapid electron transport for the CT cell. The electron capture capability of the solar cells is determined by the electron transport rate in conjunction with the recombination rate. The impact of carbon doping on the enhanced electron capture of DSCs is greater than that of nitrogen doping. Consequently, the DSC made of C-doped TiO2 nanoparticles has the best photovoltaic characteristics.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a systematic study of DSC devices by fabrication of electrodes from pure and single- and co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with carbon and nitrogen. All photoanodes have a pure anatase–TiO2 crystal structure with an average crystallite size of 7 nm. The band gap energy (Eg) of the electrodes is tuned by C and N single- and co-doping, being in the 3.15–3.22 eV range compared with 3.30 eV for pure TiO2. We find that carbon impurities result in modest variations of the band gap due to their substitutional (to Ti) position, whereas nitrogen atoms induce more impact on Eg reduction due to their interstitial position. Our results also indicate that carbon doping shows a bit greater diffused reflection percentage than nitrogen doping. In addition, no remarkable drop in the scattering of the nanoparticles is detected at wavelengths greater than 400 nm. The photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of the DSCs show that both substitutional carbon and interstitial nitrogen dopants are effective in JSC and PCE enhancement, ranking in the following order: CT > CNT > NCT > NT. EIS results verify that such enhancements are achieved by controlling the electron lifetime, charge transport and recombination resistance, which lead to a maximum power conversion efficiency of 10.2% for the CT cell compared to 7.9% for the pristine TiO2 based solar cell.
