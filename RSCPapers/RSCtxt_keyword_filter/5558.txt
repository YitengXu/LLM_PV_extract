    , Accepted 28th October 2016First published on 29th October 2016AbstractWe report a systematic study of the role of introduced alkyl chains in the easily synthesized conjugated PDTT-ROBT copolymers, which consist of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT) and alkoxy substituted benzothiadiazole (ROBT) subunits. We synthesized new conjugated polymers PDTT-BOBT and PDTT-HDBT, which have molecular structures similar to those of the previously reported PDTTDABT polymer, but have modified alkyl chains in the polymer backbone. The modifications of the alkyl chains from linear (PDTTDABT) to branched (PDTT-BOBT and PDTT-HDBT) had prominent effects on the solubility, crystallinity, molecular orientation and morphology of the co-polymers. Solar cell devices containing the new PDTT-BOBT and PDTT-HDBT polymers exhibited power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 9.2% and 6.2%, respectively, considerably greater than the 2.2% PCE of the previously reported PDTTDABT polymer, and the 9.2% PCE is in fact the highest to date for donor–acceptor polymers containing the BTOR acceptor. This high PCE may be explained by the well-aligned energy levels, optimum film morphology with bicontinuous interpenetrating networks, enhanced charge carrier mobility and decreased amount of charge recombination that we observed for PDTT-BOBT, in contrast to those exhibited by PDTTDABT and PDTT-HDBT. Considering the potential of PDTT-BOBT for industrial application, we tested the scalability, large-area devices (6600 mm2) and stability of PDTT-BOBT. As a result, the PDTT-BOBT polymer with its easily synthesized structure and high efficiency has considerable potential for being synthesized on a large scale and for use in printable electronic applications.
Introduction
Among the various renewable energy technologies, those using polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their advantages such as solution processability, flexibility, and low cost as well as the ability to fabricate them on a large scale using techniques such as inkjet and roll-to-roll (R2R) printing .1–6 In recent years power conversion efficiency (PCE) values as high as 9–11% have been achieved for PSCs either with new donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer structures7–10 or by device engineering.11–15 However, most of these copolymers are not compatible for large-scale synthesis due to the complexity of the processes used to synthesize them. At present much research has been carried out with an eye towards commercializing solar cells using high-throughput techniques along with improving lifetime and cost. The key factors which determine the future of commercialization16,17 of PSCs can be listed as (a) highly scalable high-efficiency low-cost donor materials, (b) enhancing the stability or durability of the solar cell devices by effectively encapsulating them18–20 or engineering them,21–26 (c) using environmentally friendly non-halogen solvents when fabricating the devices9,27,28 and (d) applying large-scale production processes29,30 such as those using inkjet printing, doctor blades, screen printing31 and 3D printing32 to lower the costs of fabricating the solar cells. In the current scenario, the major cost of the final large scale module is largely dependent on active layer materials along with other factors such as electrodes, encapsulation processes, machinery and labor. Thus, to further reduce the costs of commercialized solar cells, it is critical to find easily synthesized donor/acceptor materials with short synthetic routes, high yields and reproducible performance. A study of recent high efficiency donor materials reveals the use of complex molecular designs along with the use of expensive raw materials, low overall yield of the reaction, poor solubility of the polymer backbone and long duration for synthesis;7–9 these factors make the costs of these donor materials very high and hinder their large-scale syntheses. To prevent confining them to just academic interest, an ideal polymer must possess optimized properties in relation to simple synthesis, good absorption, efficiency, stability, operational lifespan, and processing compatibility. Therefore, at present researchers have been thinking about polymers with simple structures, which would have greater potential for being commercialized. This work aims to show the importance of designing and optimizing polymer donors which have a simple molecular structure and hence have greater potential for commercial applications.
The processability of organic semiconducting materials in common organic solvents is a key advantage of these materials, and organic polymers can be used in large-scale processes such as R2R manufacturing. In general, polymer backbones with linear alkyl side chains have shown better aggregation and π–π stacking but they often displayed poor yields due to reduced solubility. As a result, introducing bulky alkyl chains either in the polymer backbone or into the side chain is the common strategy used to make organic conjugated polymers soluble in common organic solvents. Extensive research has been carried out on the effects of these alkyl chains in conjugated polymers; in particular, the type, length and position of the alkyl side chain in the polymer backbone have been shown to directly influence the solubility of the polymer and its aggregation properties in the solid state, and thus affect the optical properties, electronic properties, morphology, and crystallinity, hence determining the performance of the PSC.7–9,33–38 Therefore, optimizing the alkyl side chain length in a conjugated polymer backbone is vital for increasing the solubility and processibility of the polymers and for enhancing the efficiency of solar cell devices fabricated with these polymers.
Among the various polymer backbones with simple structures, those consisting of the alkoxy-substituted benzothiadiazole unit (ROBT) with dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (DTT) have attracted our attention owing to their syntheses being simple, cost effective and highly scalable. Until now, few research groups have synthesized the PDTTDABT copolymer with linear alkyl chains in the polymer backbone and they have not optimized molecular design, which resulted in poor photovoltaic performances (PCE values of 0.13, 0.29 and 2.22% respectively).45–47 Among the reported references, the best PCE of 2.2% with short-circuit current density (JSC) = 7.99 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.49 V and fill factor (FF) = 28% was exhibited by PDTTDABT under optimized device fabrication conditions (with a polymer:PC60BM blend ratio of 1:1 and the devices were annealed at 130 °C for 5 min).45 Despite the overall poor results, Bundgaard et al. tested PDTTDABT for large roll-to-roll-coated modules (PCE = 0.31–0.6%, cell area 120 cm2), outdoor testing (PCE = 0.38%, cell area = 96 cm2),45 and tandem solar cell applications (PCE = 1%).48 Additionally, they also studied the stability of the PDTTDABT by monitoring the influence of temperature, photochemical stability, and effects of photo-oxidation.45 Interestingly, the PDTTDABT polymer displayed better photochemical stability (at 500 h) than any of the other polymers of the series PCbzTBT (maximum stability of 80 h) and P3HT (maximum stability of 200 h) under irradiation using ASTM G173 incident photon flux.45 From these previous studies involving ROBT and the PDTTDABT copolymer, the major advantages of using a molecular design are as follows: polymers (a) are easy to synthesize and hence scalable, (b) display a good ability to form films in order to be compatible with R2R processes, (c) display reasonable thermal and photochemical stability, and (d) have alkoxy substituents in their backbones to help planarize the backbones through non-covalent hydrogen bonding and dipole–dipole interactions between neighboring molecules.39 At the same time, DTT with its flat fused ring structure has proved to increase the conjugation length and decrease the band gap of polymers, and it has been extensively explored for a variety of organic semiconducting polymers due to its advantages such as its ability to form strong intermolecular S–S interactions, and its planarity, crystallinity, high carrier mobility, and good environmental stability.40–44 We speculated that lower efficiency of the PDTTDABT is possibly due to lower molecular weights of the polymer (Mn = 12.3 kDa, PDI = 6.0) and un-optimized device fabrication conditions.45 Further it is predicted that polymers with DTT usually show reduced solubility due to the rigidity of the core, hence requiring higher alkyl chains in the polymer backbone to achieve a high-molecular-weight polymer without compromising solubility. Therefore, taking into consideration the easy synthesis and large-scale R2R compatibility of the molecular design, we attempted optimization of the molecular structure by introducing different alkyl chains.
Herein, we report the synthesis of three DTT-ROBT based copolymers, namely poly(5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-4-(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (PDTT-EHBT) (P2), poly(5,6-bis((2-butyloctyl)oxy)-4-(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophen-2-yl) benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (PDTT-BOBT) (P3) and poly (5,6-bis((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)-4-(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (PDTT-HDBT) (P4). We studied the effects of the alkyl chain on the opto-electrical properties, intermolecular packing or crystallinity, film morphology, charge carrier properties and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers in solar cell devices fabricated using them. Furthermore, to compare the properties of these polymers with those of previously reported polymers, we re-synthesized poly(5,6-bis((tetradecyl)oxy)-4-(dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (PDTT-C14BT or PDTTDABT) (P1). The backbone structures of these polymers have “conformational locks”, similar to those of previously reported molecules,54 resulting from the attractive interaction between S⋯O and C–H⋯N, which proved to influence the planarity of the polymer.39 The replacement of linear alkyl chains with branched ones in the copolymers effectively decreased their crystallinity and molecular order, but enhanced their solubility and showed deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, less charge recombination and improved morphologies. The new polymers with branched alkyl chains, i.e., P3 and P4, exhibited PCE values of 9.2% and 6.2%, respectively, while P2 was found to be insoluble in common processing solvents. Furthermore, in the current study the efficiency value of P1 increased to 6.2% from the previously reported value of 2.2% through increased molecular weight and optimized device fabrication conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that fine tuning of alkyl chains in high-aggregation polymers can be an effective strategy to enhance the PCE. Thus, the P3 polymer with its easily synthesized structure and high PCE opens the door for a wide variety of applications, especially for large-scale synthesis and large-area solar cell applications.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The schemes of the syntheses of the monomers and polymers investigated in the current work are illustrated in Scheme 1. The synthesis of the ROBT monomer was simplified from a previously reported route (6 steps) due to limitation of easy alkyl chain modification.49,70,71 In the new route, commercially available 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole was directly reacted with each of various alcohols in the presence of sodium hydride to yield the corresponding forms of intermediate (1), which were then brominated in the presence of bromine and hydrobromic acid to obtain the corresponding forms of the final monomer (2) with yields over 75%. Thus, this new route allows easy modification of alkyl chains and hence assists to fine-tune the molecular structure. The 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (M5) monomer was synthesized according to previously reported procedures.40 M5 was reacted in a microwave reactor with each of the four ROBT monomers M1, M2, M3 and M4 to yield polymers P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively, via the Stille cross-coupling reaction using tris(dibenzylidene acetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) as the catalyst and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine as the ligand with 80–90% yield. The P1, P3 and P4 showed good solubility in organic solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) or 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). Moreover, due to the presence of longer alkyl chains P3 and P4 were even soluble in chloroform and tetrahydrofuran. In contrast, P2 with ethylhexyl (EH) side chains was found to be completely insoluble in CB and ODCB even under hot conditions. Hence, its photovoltaic properties were not studied. The detailed procedures for synthesizing the monomers and polymers are given in the ESI.† The molecular weights and polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of the polymers are listed in Table 1.

Optical and electrochemical properties
Absorption spectra of the polymers in solution and film states were acquired to study the effect of alkyl chain structure on the optical properties of the polymers. The UV-visible spectra of the polymers in CB solutions and in the thin film state are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively, and the corresponding optical parameters are given in Table 1. In both the solution and the film state, the P1, with its linear alkyl chain, showed >50 nm red shift of its absorbance spectra compared to P3 and P4, indicating that the alkyl chain has a considerable impact on the optical properties of the polymer. For each polymer, the absorption band at about 300–450 nm was attributed to intra-molecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor units, while the band at 500–800 nm was ascribed to intermolecular π–π* transition.36,50 The absorption maxima in solution did not differ much from those in the film state, but the absorption band became broader and vibronic peaks were observed in the film state (Fig. 1b).50 P1, being less soluble than P3 and P4, showed more aggregation and hence displayed a broader absorption pattern in both solution and thin film states. These results were consistent with previously reported results, where polymers with linear alkyl chains showed poorer solubility and greater crystallinity attributed to good π–π stacking between the polymer chains.51 Changing the side chain from linear (C14) to branched (BO and HD) resulted in a blue-shifting of the absorption band. These results indicated that changing the bulky alkyl chain may weaken the aggregation by increasing the π–π stacking distances, thus decreasing the crystallinity of the polymer. The effect of aggregation in solution was further studied by heating the polymers from 25 °C to 65 °C (Fig. S1†). In the case of the branched P3 and P4 polymers, the absorbance intensity at 650 nm decreased continuously from 25 °C to 55 °C, and at 65 °C a new peak was observed at 590 nm. This result indicated that the polymers strongly aggregated at room temperature (RT) and that heating to higher temperatures resulted in their disaggregation, due to the high twisting of the polymer backbone.52 On the other hand, the absorption spectrum of P1 was not affected by heating, emphasizing that polymers with linear alkyl chains have stronger aggregation tendencies, even in hot solution, than their branched counterparts. The optical band-gap (Eoptg) values of the polymers P1, P3 and P4 calculated from the onset of absorption (λonset) in their thin films were 1.62, 1.75 and 1.75 eV, respectively (Fig. 1c and d). In addition to absorbance, the thermal stability of each of the polymers was determined by carrying out thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). P1, P3 and P4 showed 5% weight loss at 314, 313 and 290 °C, respectively (Fig. S2a†). The low thermal degradation temperature of these polymers may be due to decomposition of their alkoxy groups.72,73 There were no endothermic or exothermic peaks observed in the DSC thermograms of all the polymers (Fig. S2b†), indicating no evidence of crystallization transitions. Moreover, all the polymers displayed good thermal stability up to 250 °C, which is adequate for their application in PSCs and other opto-electric applications. The detailed thermal, optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers are given in Table 1.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of the polymers in (a) CB solution and (b) thin film. (c) Cyclic voltammograms of the polymers and (d) schematic energy level diagram of the polymers and PC71BM. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on the films to investigate the electrochemical properties and energy levels of the polymers. The CV data are summarized in Table 1, and CV curves and a schematic energy level alignment are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated using the equations HOMO = −(4.80 + Eox) eV and LUMO = Eoptg − HOMO, where Eox indicates the onset of the oxidation potential of the polymers relative to ferrocene and Eoptg is the optical band gap of the polymer measured in the thin film state. For polymers P1, P3 and P4, the HOMO values were calculated to be −5.32, −5.47 and −5.48 eV, respectively, and the corresponding LUMO values were −3.70, −3.72 and −3.73 eV, respectively. Evidently, increasing the alkyl chain length from that of linear C14 (P1) to that of branched BO (P3) resulted in lowering both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (−5.32 to −5.47 eV and −3.70 to −3.72 eV, respectively), but a further increase in the alkyl chain length from that of BO (P3) to that of HD (P4) had little effect on the energy levels (−5.47 to −5.48 eV and 3.72 to −3.73 eV). These trends were well matched with previous reports, where drafting of linear alkyl chains facilitated planarization of the backbone and better stacking. Hence, it resulted in the upshifting of their HOMO levels compared to branched counterparts.74–76 The deeper HOMO levels of P3 and P4 were helpful in achieving higher VOC; also well-matched LUMO levels (−4.1 eV) with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (difference of >0.3 eV) would be beneficial for efficient charge separation at D–A interfaces.53
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated by fabricating PSC devices with conventional architecture (Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al). To optimize the device fabrication conditions, several PSCs were fabricated by varying the blend ratio and solvents. A polymer:PC71BM blend ratio of 1:1.5 in chlorobenzene (CB) with an active layer thickness of ∼100 nm yielded the best PSC performances, with PCE values of 3.44%, 5.37% and 5.69% for polymers P1, P3 and P4, respectively (Table 2 and Fig. 2a and b). As a result of low-lying HOMO energy levels, new polymers with branched alkyl chains (P3 and P4) yielded higher VOC (VOC = 0.91 and 0.92 V for P3 and P4, respectively) compared to their linear counterparts (VOC of P1 = 0.65 V). In contrast, with its extended absorption range of P1, it displayed much lower JSC values owing to the lower EQE values. Hence, P1 displayed inferior photovoltaic performance compared to P3 and P4. The lower FF values in all the polymers hindered further improvement in device performance and these values indicated poor inter-mixing of the polymer with PC71BM (Table 2). In recent years, the use of high-boiling-point solvent additives in organic photovoltaics have proved to be an efficient way to optimize the bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) morphology owing to selectively solvating one of the components,10,55,56 and we therefore tested solvent additives. Adding 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) yielded a marked improvement in photovoltaic parameters mainly JSC and FF and photovoltaic performances. The detailed J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) graphs of devices with 3 vol% DIO are shown in Fig. 2c and d and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Addition of DIO to CB (CB:DIO = 97:3 by volume) led to substantial, nearly twofold, increases in the PCE of devices using P1 and P3 (from 3.44% to 6.22% and 5.37% to 9.2%. respectively), mainly due to increases in the JSC and FF. In contrast, including DIO in the device containing P4 led to only a minor enhancement of PCE (from 5.69% to 6.21%). The best PCE 9.21% of the P3 polymer tested using an aperture (active area = 9 mm2) for a film thickness of 100 nm with JSC of 15.07 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.82 V and FF of 74%, it also displayed average PCE over 9% for over 20 independent devices under illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) (Table 2). It should be noted that introduction of branched alkyl chains in the backbones of P3 and P4 improved the alignment of their energy levels with those of PC71BM through lowering the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers (Fig. 1d).

 Fig. 2  (a, c) Characteristic current density vs. voltage curves and (b, d) corresponding EQE profiles of P1, P3 and P4 with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al and processed with (a, b) CB and (c, d) CB/3 vol% DIO, under an AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. 
To understand the reason for variation of JSC values with the incorporation of DIO, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of all the PSC devices were measured under CB and CB/DIO conditions (Fig. 2b and d) and observed mismatches between JSC values calculated from integration of EQE curves and J–V measurements were below 5%. The devices that were fabricated employing P1 without DIO displayed lower EQE values over a wavelength range of 350 to 700 nm compared to P3 and P4 devices under similar conditions (Fig. 2b). Hence, devices employing P1 displayed poor JSC and PCE values compared to those employing P3 and P4 (Fig. 2a and b and Table 2). But after incorporation of solvent additive DIO, P1 yielded broad EQE spectra over the whole wavelength region and in particular, EQE values were much enhanced in the 450 to 750 nm region (over 70%) (Fig. 2d). Additionally, P1 also displayed the highest EQE value of 75% at 500 nm. Hence, the highest JSC of 15.96 mA cm−2 was obtained for devices employing P1 fabricated with CB/DIO. But, the high-lying HOMO energy level together with high aggregation behavior of P1 deteriorated the VOC and FF values in the devices (Fig. 1d and Table 2). Therefore, despite having the highest JSC among the polymers, PSC devices with P1 illustrated a moderate PCE of 6.22%. Interestingly, P3 with a BO chain also exhibited enhanced EQE values (over 70% in the 450 to 700 nm wavelength region) and hence yielded a remarkable JSC of 15.07 mA cm−2 after using DIO. These high JSC values of P1 and P3 indicated efficient photon harvesting and charge transport in the solar devices. Furthermore, higher FF and VOC values in P3 also contributed to achieving the highest efficiency of over 9%. In contrast, P4 devices with DIO illustrated lower JSC owing to suppressed EQE values over the 500 to 700 nm region compared to those without DIO counterparts (Fig. 2b vs. d). So, only little enhancement in the performance of the P4 devices was observed after addition of DIO (from 5.69% to 6.21%). In the current series, a significant increase of the FF of all the polymers was observed after addition of DIO, which indicated an improved morphology.
With an eye towards making our devices as compatible for mass production, the effects of blend ratio, active layer thickness and non-halogen solvents were further tested for P3. In all D:A blend ratios tested (1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, and 1:3, w/w), P3 yielded efficiency values of over 8%, with the best PCE of 9.2% achieved using a 1:1.5 blend ratio (Table S1 and Fig. S3†). In the thickness tolerance study, P3 yielded efficiency values greater than 8.5% over a thickness range of 80 nm to 180 nm (Table S2 and Fig. S4†). Upon increasing the active area thickness to 180 nm, JSC increased slightly (from 14.38 to 14.91 mA cm−2) despite the increased light absorption, and the FF slightly decreased (from 74% to 71%) which indicated a possibility of charge recombination at higher thickness. Device fabrication using non-halogenated solvents has not yet been fully optimized, but in preliminary tests P3 yielded PCE values of 5.8% and 5.73% with the solvents 1,2,4-trimethyl benzene (TMB) and o-xylene, respectively (Table S3 and Fig. S5†); these values were still higher than that (PCE = 5.34%) of the most efficient PSC obtained with the halogenated solvent CB without additive, indicating that there is further room for improvement by testing with additives.
Organic solar cells with an inverted architecture (ITO/ZnO/polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE)/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) were also fabricated, considering the advantages of such devices including long-term stability, vertical phase separation and self-encapsulation due to the use of highly air-stable metal electrodes.21 Under the optimized fabrication conditions, an inverted device containing P3 showed an efficiency of 9.22% with VOC = 0.82 V, JSC = 15.67 mA cm−2 and FF = 72%, similar to the values displayed by the conventional PSCs. A PEIE66 interfacial layer was used as the cathode buffer layer on the ZnO surface to improve electron collecting ability in the optimized inverted device and detailed J–V graphs and EQE curves of this device are given in Fig. S6.†
Molecular ordering of the polymers
To attain a deep understanding of the effects of interchain orientation, molecular arrangements and crystallinity of polymers with/without PC71BM and before/after including the DIO solvent additive, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis was carried out with the optimized device fabrication conditions (Fig. S7†). The detailed packing parameters extracted from the GIWAXS profiles are summarized in Table 3 and the in-plane and out-of-plane cut profiles of GIWAXS images are shown in Fig. 3. Pristine P1 films showed clear (100) reflections in both the out-of-plane direction and in-plane direction (lamellar spacings of 22.49 and 26.18 Å), respectively, and also a (010) peak along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions with π–π stacking (both with a d-spacing of 3.66 Å), indicating a mixed orientation (Fig. 3a and b and S7a†); hence, as a result of a well-ordered molecular structure in both directions, P1 exhibits high crystallinity. The pristine polymer films of P3 (Fig. 3c and d and S7b†) and P4 (Fig. 3e and f, and S7c†) showed (100) peaks only in the in-plane direction with lamellar spacings of 18.98 Å and 19.67 Å, respectively, and pronounced out-of-plane (010) scattering with d-spacings of 3.87 Å and 3.89 Å, respectively. These results signify that neat P3 and P4 preferentially adopted face-on orientations. The shorter out-of-plane (010) π–π stacking distance for P1 than that for P3 and P4 emphasizes its more ordered nature and better crystallinity due to the presence of linear alkyl chains.

The lamellar spacings of the blend samples (without DIO) in the in-plane direction were found to be 26.18, 18.20 and 21.07 Å for polymers P1, P3 and P4, respectively. Interestingly, the intense out-of-plane (010) peak in P3 and P4 was diminished (Fig. 3c and e), indicating that PC71BM may have hindered polymer aggregation and instead yielded a well-dispersed BHJ morphology. Hence, the P1:PC71BM blend showed a mixed orientation and the P3 and P4 blends showed face-on lamellar orientations employing CB solvent. After addition of DIO into CB, P1 showed clear (100) peaks in both the out-of-plane and in-plane directions with lamellar spacings of 22.33 Å and 24.26 Å, respectively, and a (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction with a d spacing of 3.50 Å (Fig. 3a and b and S7g†). These results indicated that there was no change in the molecular ordering for P1 (mixed orientation), but the reduced π–π stacking distance indicated enhanced crystallinity after addition of DIO. In contrast, in P4 after addition of DIO, additional (100) peaks were observed in the out-of-plane direction (lamellar distance of 18.38 Å) and in the in-plane direction (lamellar distance of 20.09 Å), indicative of a change of orientation from lamellar face-on to a mixture of edge-on and face-on (Fig. 3e and f). P3 showed only the (100) peak along the in-plane direction (lamellar distance of 18.65 Å) indicating a retention of the face-on lamellar orientation even after the addition of DIO (Fig. 3c and d). Among the polymers, blends of P3 showed a tendency to form a face-on orientation compared to other polymers, which is beneficial for achieving high carrier mobility through vertical charge transport.63 At the same time it is significant to note that the in-plane (100) lamellar distance in P3 increased from 18.2 to 18.65 Å after adding DIO. This result indicated that good mixing of the polymer with PC71BM occurred. Such mixing facilitated the optimization of the BHJ morphology, which is crucial for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. In contrast, a decreased lamellar distance along the in-plane directions was observed for P1 and P4, signifying the possibility of phase segregation. These observations were consistent with the photovoltaic values showing that P3 yielded the highest efficiency (of 9.2%) due to its enhanced JSC (of 15.07 mA cm−2) and FF (of 74%), while lower FF values hindered further enhancement of PCEs in P1 and P4.
Charge carrier properties
Carrier transport characteristics of the polymer blends were determined by measuring hole and electron mobilities using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique (Fig. S8†). The hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron-only (ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al) devices were fabricated under both CB and CB:DIO (97:3 vol%) conditions and the results of our measurements on these devices are summarized in Table 2. The devices with CB but no DIO and containing the polymers P1, P3 and P4 showed average hole (electron) mobility values of 1.03 × 10−4 (3.98 × 10−5), 5.34 × 10−5 (2.76 × 10−5), and 7.32 × 10−5 (4.26 × 10−5) cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with hole/electron mobility (μh/μe) ratios of 2.58, 1.93 and 1.71, respectively. These relatively poor and unbalanced electron/hole mobilities may have contributed to the relatively low JSC and FF values of these devices, hence hindering higher PCEs. After including the DIO solvent additive in the devices containing polymers P1 and P3, significant enhancements of both the hole (and electron) mobilities were observed, to 1.17 × 10−4 (1.08 × 10−4) and 1.42 × 10−4 (1.23 × 10−4) cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the ratio of hole to electron mobilities (μh/μe) also improved, to 1.08 and 1.15, respectively. In contrast, adding DIO to the device containing P4 appeared to have slightly reduced its hole mobility, to 4.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. P4 yielded an electron mobility about an order of magnitude lower than that of P1 and P3, indicating that the HD alkyl chain in its backbone might have adversely affected the film morphology and crystallinity of the polymer. It is quite interesting to note that the addition of DIO effectively enhanced the preference for the face-on lamellar orientation of P3 in the film, and this enhancement, leading to the formation of well-developed charge carrier pathways, may have contributed to the device containing this polymer having displayed the highest charge carrier mobility. As a result of the enhanced and more balanced electron and hole mobilities, the photovoltaic parameters, mainly the JSC and FF, were markedly greater for the P1 and P3 devices containing DIO than for the devices without the solvent additive. The relatively low JSC of the P4 containing device with DIO, compared to that without DIO, was attributed to its lower hole mobility and higher FF values, which may have been due to its more balanced hole and electron mobility (μh/μe = 1.15).
Charge generation, charge transport and recombination study
The correlation between the charge recombination kinetics and performance of BHJ solar cells was studied by analyzing the dependence of certain J–V characteristics on the intensity of the illumination.57J–V graphs of polymers subjected to light with intensities varying from 3.2 to 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4a–c for P1, P3 and P4 devices, respectively. For the devices with P3, the photocurrent was quickly saturated at all light intensities, thus demonstrating more efficient charge dissociation and transport. However, for those with P1 and P4, a much slower saturation was observed at higher illumination intensities, indicating more recombination near the VOC.

Double logarithmic plots of JSC as a function of light intensity (Plight) for all polymers were analyzed to understand the charge carrier dynamics (Fig. 4e). These graphs were found to follow the power law JSC ∝ Iα under short-circuit conditions (where I is the incident light intensity and α is the exponential content).58 Under ideal conditions, where bimolecular recombination was minimum the values of α are found to be unity, while further deviation of α values from 1 indicates the possibility of charge recombination through bimolecular recombination.58 In thecurrent series α values were found to be 0.96, 0.97 and 0.96 for P1, P3 and P4, respectively, suggesting the device with P3 shows less bimolecular recombination behavior than those with other polymers.
The type of recombination behavior (monomolecular or trap-assisted vs. bimolecular) in polymer solar cells was determined from the slope of VOCversus ln(I).59 In the case of bimolecular recombination, the slope is kT/e was observed; while in the monomolecular case, the slope 2kT/e was seen.36 In the current series, slopes of 1.38, 1.14 and 1.37kT/e were observed for P1, P3, and P4, respectively (Fig. 4d), indicating a greater extent of monomolecular recombination for P1 and P4 than for P3. From these results, P3 was predicted to form an ideal morphology with limited trap sites, which would lead to efficient charge transfer between the polymer and PC71BM without any recombination losses.
The dependence of FF on light intensity was also studied and is summarized in Fig. 4f; P3 yielded the best FF values at almost all light intensities, indicating that it had the most efficient charge transport and extraction to the respective electrode due to reduced recombination.
To determine the reason for the high JSC for P1, the exciton generation rates (Gmax) of the polymer blends were measured. The Gmax was determined by plotting photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff). Here, Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively, and Veff = V0 − V, where V is applied bias and V0 is voltage when Jph = 0.62 It is evident from the graph (Fig. S9†) that Jph was almost saturated when Veff exceeded 1.5 V. Gmax was calculated from the equation Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the electron charge, L is the thickness of the active layer in the device and Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density. The Gmax values were calculated to be 10.0 × 1027, 9.60 × 1027 and 6.84 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for P1, P3 and P4, respectively; hence, the relatively high JSC (15.96 mA cm−2) of P1 was mainly attributed to its high rate of charge generation. In addition, high EQE values and an extended light absorption range (from 300 to 780 nm) also contributed to achieve high JSC in P1 (Fig. 2d). The order of the Gmax values from the graphs, i.e., P1 > P3 > P4, matched the order of their JSC values.
Film morphology analysis
Owing to the prominent role of active layer film morphology in determining the performances of PSCs, the morphologies of the polymer:PC71BM blend films processed with CB and CB/DIO were analyzed by acquiring atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 5) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 6). The dark and bright regions in the TEM images represent PC71BM-rich and polymer-rich domains, respectively. In P3, the morphology of the film without the additive was observed to be featureless without distinct polymer and PC71BM phases in the TEM image (Fig. 6c). In contrast, after adding the solvent additive DIO, the TEM image of P3 showed an optimized nano-scale morphology with uniform domain sizes (Fig. 6d) along with bicontinuous interpenetrating nano-fibrillar structures, which assisted in the formation of a BHJ morphology with PC71BM. As previously reported high-efficiency polymers, these interconnected fibrous microstructures with optimum fibril widths are beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation at donor/acceptor interfaces and charge transport in the photo-active layer.10 Thus, several features of P3, including its optimum film morphology as well as its high charge mobility and low levels of recombination, apparently contributed to its high JSC and FF values and also helped to achieve higher PCE than the other tested polymers. These results from TEM well matched the AFM and GIWAXS data. It is very evident from the AFM images that the film from P3 without DIO showed a smooth surface morphology (RMS = 0.26 nm) without a distinct phase separation (Fig. 5b2). In contrast, after addition of DIO, the formation of an optimized morphology was clearly indicated in the AFM height image (Fig. 5b4) along with improved (i.e., greater) roughness (RMS = 0.86 nm). These results helped us to explain why devices containing P3 processed without DIO displayed lower charge carrier mobility and PCE (Table 2) than the devices containing the polymer processed with DIO. Additionally, due to the formation of the BHJ morphology, an increase in the in-plane (100) lamellar distance in P3 from 18.2 to 18.65 Å in was seen GIWAXS profiles, emphasizing good intermixing of P3 and PC71BM after addition of DIO.

In contrast to P3 without DIO, P1 without DIO yielded a TEM image (Fig. 6a) showing considerable phase segregation, which can be seen more clearly in the AFM phase image, showing a rough surface of the blend (RMS = 2.29 nm) (Fig. 5a2). These macro-phase separations apparently hindered exciton dissociation by reducing the donor/acceptor interfacial area,60 and resulted in increased levels of charge recombination and hence, P1 without DIO yielded poor JSC and FF values. But after addition of DIO, the macro-phase separation of P1 was substantially decreased (RMS = 1.00 nm) (Fig. 5a4) demonstrating an improved morphology. These results were in good agreement with photovoltaic parameters derived from P1: as described above, before addition of DIO, the PSC containing P1 showed poor charge carrier mobility and a poor PCE of 3.44% due to its poor JSC and FF; but with DIO, its PCE was much higher, at 6.44%, which was mainly attributed to its extended light absorption range, more balanced charge carrier mobility (μh/μe = 1.08) and improved film morphology. But dark patches in the TEM image (Fig. 6b) indicate the existence of PC71BM aggregation, which possibly hindered further enhancement of PCE.
Interestingly, P4 without DIO showed a better film morphology among the polymers than did the other polymers without DIO, with an RMS surface roughness of 0.39 nm and with distinct polymer and PC71BM phases. This indicated the formation of the BHJ morphology with well interconnected polymer and PC71BM phases (Fig. 5c2 and 6e), which is ideal for effective exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Hence, P4 without DIO yielded a higher hole mobility (at 4.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PCE (at 5.69%) than P3 and P1 without DIO. Perhaps the high solubility of P4 influenced the morphology of its film through good mixing of the polymer with PC71BM. But after the addition of DIO, the phase separation in the P4 containing film was increased, as reflected in the AFM height images (compare Fig. 5c2–c4), where a considerable increase of the RMS roughness from 0.39 nm to 2.32 nm was observed. Analysis of the corresponding TEM images (compare Fig. 6f–e) further indicated an increased fibril width of the polymer when DIO was included, possibly due to polymer aggregation (bright regions). Such aggregation would have been expected to hinder efficient exciton dissociation because of increased diffusion length (>10 nm),37 and hence, in the device containing P4, the hole mobility was reduced due to a disconnected charge pathway after addition of DIO and there was no pronounced increase in efficiency.
Device stability
In viewpoint of mass production application, the device stability of P3:PC71BM PSCs (>9% initial PCE) was measured with an inverted device architecture (ITO/ZnO/PEIE/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) in a weathering chamber under both without/with light soaking conditions at 65 °C with a relative humidity of 85%. The corresponding time resolved photovoltaic properties are shown in Fig. 7. The P3 device without light soaking conditions showed good thermal stability, displaying about 90% of its initial PCE even at 1000 h. But under 1 sun of the light, a considerable 40% drop in PCE occurred quite rapidly, within 100 h. This result emphasizes the considerable variation of stability under light soaking conditions. However, between 300 h and 1000 h of exposure, the device displayed better photo-stability, maintaining about 50% of its initial PCE throughout this time period (Fig. 7a). We speculate that initial drop in the PCEs (burn-in-loss) under light soaking conditions was possibly due to trap-embedded lower molecular weights components, which facilitates the photo induced trap state formation as reported previously.61 In addition, other factors such as morphology changes due to PC71BM aggregation67 and interfacial layers68,69 between the electrode and photo-active layer with charge accumulation also might have contributed to initial burn-in loss. The trends of the other photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, and FF) were imitated PCE trends (Fig. 7b–d). Further efforts to increase the photo-stability of the P3-containing devices are underway, by device engineering such as modification of interfacial layers and improving the encapsulation of the device along with purification of polymers to so that it can be optimally used in large-area applications.

Scalability of the P3 polymer and fabrication of large-area PSC devices
Syntheses of the polymers on a considerably larger scale (∼1 g) were attempted by employing thermal conditions due to the limitations of using a microwave reactor for large-scale synthesis. Several trials were carried out to optimize the scalability of P3, particularly by varying the reaction scale and catalyst. We found the relatively low purity of 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (M5) to have severely affected the polymerization rate, hence limiting high-molecular-weight polymers (Mn < 20 kDa). The devices with these low-molecular-weight polymers showed decreased PCE values of 5–7% depending on batches. To avoid batch-to-batch variation, M5 was further re-purified by using recycling preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. Under the optimized conditions (reaction scale of 1.8 mmol), the reaction here yielded 1.2 g (90% yield) of P3 in a single batch, and its device displayed an efficiency of over 8.7%. The detailed conditions for the polymer synthesis are given in the ESI,† and the photovoltaic results are summarized in Table S4 and Fig. S10.† Thus, the simple molecular design of P3 and the relatively few steps in its synthesis make this polymer a very promising target for large-scale synthesis.
As emphasized earlier, successful commercialization of PSCs greatly depends on the costs of the materials involved, suitability of the donor materials for large-scale synthesis and fabrication techniques such as inkjet and R2R coating. Currently, spin coating is the most common and efficient method for the deposition of BHJ layer systems and all recent PSCs demonstrating >9% efficiency were synthesized using the same technique. Even though it is highly reproducible and reliable, it is often limited to only small area devices. Unfortunately, large-area R2R devices fabricated with either slot-die coating or blade coating often experience significant challenges mainly associated with un-optimal film morphologies, resulting in higher recombination and space charge effects; hence, deteriorating the overall FF and PCE.65 Thus, owing to the advantages of P3 such as its low cost, stability and high scalability, large-area (10 cm × 10 cm) inverted architecture (ITO/ZnO/PEIE/P3:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag) devices were also fabricated using the slot-die coating method. The device fabrication process involving slot dye coating of ZnO, PEIE, and active layer in sequence on patterned ITO glass followed by metal deposition is given in the schematic diagram (Fig. S11†) and the detailed device fabrication process is given in the experimental section. Under the initial screening conditions, a P3 module with an active area of 6600 mm2 displayed an efficiency of 5.44% with JSC = 1.20 mA cm−2, VOC = 8.66 V and FF = 52.5% and the corresponding geometrical FF of the large-area modules were found to be 66%. The detailed device architecture, photograph and J–V characteristics of these large-area devices are given in Fig. 8. To understand the reason for the drop in the FF and JSC of the large-area modules compared to the unit cells, the morphology of the photo-active films processed with slot-die coating and spin coating was compared. Fig. S12† represents the corresponding AFM and TEM images of the P3:PC71BM blend films. As emphasized earlier, the TEM image of the device fabricated with spin coating techniques displayed an optimized nano-scale morphology with bicontinuous interpenetrating nano-fibrillar structures (Fig. S12c†). In contrast, the device fabricated with slot-die coating showed an un-homogeneous film morphology. Moreover in the TEM image, the crystalline polymer phase was further reduced and formation of dark patches indicating PC71BM aggregations was observed in the device fabricated with the slot-die coating technique (Fig. S12d†). Similarly, AFM images also emphasized possible macro phase segregations, where RMS roughness in the height image was increased for the slot die coating devices (RMS = 1.59 nm) compared to spin coated devices (RMS = 0.95 nm) (Fig. S12a vs. S12b†). Thus, enhanced macro phase separations deteriorated overall charge transport properties in devices coated with slot die coating, hence reducing FF and JSC through higher recombination. These results well matched with previous reports, which also emphasized that the drop in the PCE in large-area devices is mainly due to change in the morphology.64,65 Despite the lower efficiencies compared to small area devices, these results were found to be highly reliable due to the use of an aperture for measuring the efficiency. It should be noted that the large-area devices containing P3 have not yet been fully optimized; further studies involving modification to the device fabrication conditions are underway for the enhancement of the PCEs in the large-area modules.

Effects of alkyl chains on polymer solubility
These results emphasized that the nature of the alkyl chain in the DTT and ROBT copolymers affected the solubility and PCEs of the polymer. Hence, the correlation between alkyl chain and the polymer solubility can be summarized as below. In the current polymer series, P4 was observed to be the most soluble polymer, followed by P3 and then P1, with P2 being insoluble. P2, which included the EH chain in its polymer backbone, was completely insoluble in common organic solvents such as ODCB and CB. The use of the linear C14 chain instead, to produce P1, resulted in an improvement of solubility compared to that of P2. But P1 was observed to be soluble only in CB and overall less soluble than P3 and P4, which included BO and HD chains, respectively. Increasing the molecular weights of P1 together with device fabrication engineering greatly helped in increasing the device PCE from 2.2% to 6.1% (Table 2), but excessive aggregation of the polymers along with higher monomolecular recombination and poor morphology had negative effects on PCE. In contrast, introduction of the long branched alkyl chain HD produced the highly soluble P4, which was even observed to be soluble in hexane. However, the poor charge carrier mobilities of the polymer blend along with the un-optimized film morphology prevented its devices from achieving a high PCE. Thus, in this polymer series, either BO or even shorter alkyl chains were thought to be optimum for polymer solubility. The P3 polymer with its BO alkyl chain showed the optimum solubility of all the polymers tested; and due to its resulting good nanoscale phase separation, as well as due to its balanced charge carrier mobility and low levels of charge recombination, its device showed the highest efficiency, of 9.2%, under optimized device fabrication conditions. Efforts were also made to synthesize a polymer using an alkyl chain with a size between that of BO and that of EH, i.e., the polymer PDTT-PHBT (P5) with the propylheptyl (PH or C3C5) chain. Under optimized device fabrication conditions, P5 showed a PCE of 6.61% with a JSC of 14.06 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.77 V and a FF of 61% (Table S5 and Fig. S13†). However, P5 was not investigated as much as the other polymers in the series, due to the commercial unavailability of 2-propylheptan-1-ol. Taken together, these results emphasize that high crystallinity alone cannot always guarantee good photovoltaic properties; rather fine control of the molecular ordering and optimized morphology will help to achieve a high PCE. Thus, optimum alkyl chains should be as short as possible, but as long as it endows the polymer with sufficient solubility for polymer processing.
Conclusions
In summary, we attempted to fine-tune the molecular design of the polymer structures consisting of DTT and ROBT by modifying their alkyl chains. Drafting branched alkyl chains (BO) helped in achieving better solubility and higher VOC through lowering the HOMO energy levels in the polymer, facilitated the formation of the ideal film morphology with PC71BM through the creation of an interpercolated nano-fibrillar network, and enhanced charge carrier properties through molecular orientation and packing, which greatly improved PCEs. The device containing the medium-band-gap (1.75 eV) polymer P3, which contained BO chains, exhibited the highest PCE (9.2%) under both conventional and inverted device fabrication conditions, and showed a high JSC of 15.07 mA cm−2 without sacrificing VOC and FF. The 9.2% PCE is the highest efficiency to date for the D–A polymers employing the ROBT acceptor. We further tested the stability, scalability and large-area devices of P3, which resulted in a device exhibiting an efficiency of 5.44% in a large-area module with an active area of 6600 mm2 defined by aperture. Thus, the PDTT-BOBT polymer, with its easily synthesized structure, low cost, high scalability and high efficiency, has considerable potential for printable electronic applications. Therefore, this study will emphasize the importance of fine-tuning the structure through the alkyl chain modification and such modification can be used as an effective strategy to interrupt excessive aggregation in highly crystalline polymers, which can further assist to achieve higher efficiency through improved processability, controlled molecular ordering, optimum morphology and balanced charge carrier mobility. Moreover, this study has shown the benefits of easily synthesized polymers with a simple structure, which have greater potential for industrial applications than high-efficiency molecules with a complex synthesis.
