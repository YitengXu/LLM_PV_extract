    , Accepted 15th January 2019First published on 28th January 2019AbstractThe strategy of developing organic dyes with exceptional optical, thermal, and stable photovoltaic properties has attracted substantial attention in the replacement of high-cost traditional dyes in DSSCs. Herein, we synthesized four dyes with a D–π–A configuration in order to study the variation produced in the optical, thermal, redox and photovoltaic properties by substitution of different donors and acceptors in the dipyrrolopyrazine (DPP) system. These push–pull systems are based on a pyrrolopyrazine spacer, end-capped with donors (N,N-dimethylamine, and thiophene) and acceptors (pyridine, –COOH, and –CN). The multidisciplinary study concerning the optical, thermal, redox, and photovoltaic characterization of the dyes reveals that compound 3a exhibits the best overall conversion efficiency as a sensitizer in TiO2 dye sensitized solar cells. The theoretical calculations together with experimental data allow us to quantify the charge transfer character of dyes.
1. Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into electricity is one of the most promising approaches to mitigate the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and to satisfy the urgent need for eco-friendly energy. Among new technologies, the dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention, mainly because of their low cost materials, easy fabrication, and high theoretical power conversion efficiency.1–5 The sensitizer is a crucial element, since it plays an important role in the conversion efficiency and stability of the device.6–9 Therefore, dyes are required to fulfil some essential characteristics, such as having a push–pull structure, broad spectral response, photo-stability, proper electronic energy between HOMO and LUMO levels, better intramolecular charge transfer, and an anchoring group to strongly bind onto a semiconductor material.10 Normally, dyes are classified into two categories, metal-based11–14 and metal-free organic dyes.15–18 Even though the efficiency of the metal-based dyes is high, the tedious synthetic process has hindered large scale applications. Organic dyes are regarded as an alternative, because of their low cost, facile modification, ease of purification, and tunable optoelectronic properties.
A conjugated chromophore with a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration is the basic structure for designing the sensitizer for DSSCs.19,20 The D–π–A configuration is popular for its non-toxic nature, flexible molecular engineering, and a high molar extinction coefficient. The push–pull character of these molecules effectuates an intramolecular charge transfer upon excitation, so the electrons accumulated on the acceptor could be injected into a metal oxide. To facilitate the electron transfer from D to A, the π-linker plays a vital role. Besides enhancing the extension, the choice of π-linker is an important factor to affect the efficiency of the cell. It is well known that the extension of conjugation with a heterocyclic core as a π-linker would result in a red shift of the absorption wavelength since longer wavelength absorption peaks for the dyes are attributed to π–π* transition, which is the most common strategy to enhance the overall efficiency. As a result, in the last two decades, a wide range of structural modifications to the π-bridge, and donor and acceptor groups have been implemented for the preparation of sensitizers with high performance for DSSCs.
The structure of the dye has profound influence on the performance of DSSCs; changing the π-bridging unit in the fused ring is an effective strategy to adjust the photovoltaic performance. The nature of the electron donor not only affects the regeneration rate of the oxidised dye but also plays a vital role in modulating the molecular energy levels and light harvesting capability of the dyes. The most common electron donors are triphenylamine, N,N-dialkylamine, and carbazole.21–23 The acceptor groups include acid chloride, pyridine, aldehydes, and phosphoric acid, the most common being carboxylic acid, due to its relative stability and ease of purification.24–29 Various chromophores, such as dithienothiophene, thienothiophene, triphenylamine, and phenoxazine have been incorporated as the π-bridge between the electron donor and electron acceptor for efficient charge separation. The most efficient DSSCs contain pyrazine,30–32 thiophene,33 pyran,34 isoquinoline,35 quinoxaline,36,37 and benzothiadiazole units,38,39 due to their excellent charge transport and better π-conjugation properties.
Pyrazine is a well-known electron withdrawing group and is widely utilized, and shows promising photovoltaic properties in polymer structures for field-effect transistors,40 light-emitting diodes,41 and bulk heterojunction solar cells.42 Thus, using pyrazine units as components in organic sensitizers is a very attractive approach in terms of their diverse structural modifications. To the best of our knowledge, the potential of the dipyrrolopyrazine moiety as a π-linker for DSSCs has not yet been explored. It is given that the introduction of the amine and thiophene moieties leads to a bathochromic shift and broadening of the absorption spectra.
In this paper, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of DPP-based dyes that contain thiophene and N,N-dimethylamine moieties as electron donors, and pyridine, carboxylic acid, and cyano as electron acceptors.43,44 These two building blocks are bridged by DPP, which serves as a π-conjugated spacer to give D–π–A dyes. The electrochemical properties and photovoltaic properties were investigated and DFT calculation is discussed in detail. Influence of the DPP π-linker on the performance is explored to provide helpful clues for the development of more efficient dyes (Fig. 1).

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
Functionalization of the DPP π-conjugated system with different electron acceptors and electron donors determines a clear tuning of the absorption properties of the resulting dyes. Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route to dyes 3(a–d). The key precursors 1(a–b) were prepared from 3,5-dibromo-6-chloropyrazin-2-amine in good yield.45,46 A Pd catalysed Sonogashira reaction on intermediates 1(a–b) with alkynes containing different donors (N,N-dimethylamine, thiophene) under microwave (MW) led to precursors 2(a–d) along with traces of the cyclized product. The mixture was directly used for the next step, without separation. In the final step, the target sensitizers 3(a–d) were obtained in reasonable yields from 2(a–d)via a base-induced MW assisted intramolecular cyclization reaction. We have previously reported the details regarding the synthesis of the compound 3d.47 The structural integrity of all the compounds was confirmed by standard spectroscopic methods.

2.2. Optical properties
The absorption spectra of dyes 3(a–d) in CH2Cl2 (1.0 × 10−5 M) are depicted in Fig. 2(a), and their corresponding absorption data are listed in Table 1. All the dyes exhibit strong peaks and broad bands between 401 and 424 nm, which can be attributed to internal charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor groups, which depends on the donor group linked to the π-bridge. The absorption maxima of compounds 3(a–d) are 424, 401, 414, and 413 nm, respectively. The longest absorption maximum clearly depends on the structure of the given chromophores and assumes a trend in the order 3a < 3c < 3d < 3b. Aryl amine derivatives (3a) showed a bathochromic shift compared with thiophene moiety, which is attributed to ICT.

The emission spectra of the dyes 3(a–d) displayed moderately intense emission in CH2Cl2 when excited at their absorption maxima. The emission profiles are presented in Fig. 2(b). The emission peaks of dyes 3(a–d) appear at 528, 479, 489, and 488 nm, respectively. Similar to absorption spectra, the most red-shifted emission profile is observed for amine derivative 3a while 3b displayed a shorter wavelength emission. Furthermore, the photographic images of the corresponding samples under UV light are presented in Fig. 2(c).
2.3. Thermal properties
The thermal behaviour of dyes 3(a–d) was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. TGA and DSC plots of dyes 3(a–d) are shown in Fig. 3, and their corresponding thermal data are summarized in Table 1. All of the dyes exhibited high thermal decomposition (Td) temperatures with the values of 353, 284, 325, and 305 °C being observed for dyes 3(a–d), respectively. The amount of carbonized residue for dye 3c in nitrogen atmosphere was more than 50% at 1000 °C, due to the high aromatic content after carbonization. Sharp endothermic transition peaks were observed for all the dyes which indicate the crystalline nature of the compounds. Fig. 3(a) shows that the melting temperatures (Tm) of all the dyes were found to be higher than 240 °C. The comparison of the thermal stability of donor substituents shows that they resulted in enhanced thermal stability. The highest thermal stability is observed for 3c, while 3b displayed the lowest in the series, demonstrating that the thermal stability of DPP-based dyes are good enough for application in solar cells.

2.4. Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to investigate the possibility of electron transfer from the dye molecule to TiO2 and Table 1 shows their redox potentials and energy levels. CV measurements were carried out in CH2Cl2 using a conventional typical three-electrode configuration in 0.1 M [TBA][PF6] electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Pt was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was introduced as an internal reference. Fig. 4 shows the CV profile of 3a and the remaining plots are presented in the ESI.† The obtained CV data were used to calculate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels from the onset oxidation potential using eqn (1) HOMO = −[Eox + 4.8 eV](1)Further, the optical band gap (Eoptg) was determined from the intersection of absorption and emission spectra, which is the difference between the energies of the HOMO and the first excited singlet state. Eoptg and HOMO energy values were employed to calculate LUMO energy values according to the eqn (2), LUMO = [HOMO + Eoptg eV](2)The position of the HOMO and LUMO of the dyes affect the photovoltaic performance in DSSCs. The electronic nature of spacer, donor and acceptor together significantly affect the oxidation potential values. The estimated oxidation potential corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of 3(a–d) are 5.42, 5.77, 5.74, and 5.75 eV, respectively. The oxidation can be attributed to donor moieties, while the reduction peaks can be assigned to acceptor moieties. Thus lower oxidation potentials are expected for the strong donor containing derivatives of 3a, while a larger oxidation potential is observed for 3b. The oxidation potential of the dye should be higher than the redox potential of iodine to reduce the backward transfer of electrons from the electrolyte solution. The oxidation potentials of dyes 3(a–d) are in the range 0.57–0.97 eV, which is more positive than the iodine redox potential, which is beneficial for the regeneration of the oxidized dye after electron injection.

2.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to elucidate the interfacial charge recombination process in DSSCs based on these dyes. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots for dyes 3a and 3c. In a typical DSSC Nyquist spectrum, there are three semicircles associated with the charge transfer. The first semicircle is attributed to charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. Here the major semicircle is related to the charge transfer process at the interface between TiO2/dye/electrolyte as the experiment is carried out in the dark. It is clear that dye 3a exhibited the highest recombination resistance.

2.6. Surface morphological analysis
The surface and structural morphologies of the prepared dyes 3(a–d) were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the crystalline nature and molecular orientation in the solid state.48,49 To prepare samples for SEM analysis, thin films were fabricated by drop-casting CH2Cl2 solutions of chromophores 3(a–d) on a bare silica substrate. SEM studies revealed the formation of nanorods/microfibers (3a), microtubes (3b), flake-like (3c) and flower-like (3d) architectures with widths ranging from several nano/micrometers and lengths up to several millimeters. The SEM micrographs of dyes reveal well-ordered particles with one-dimensional microstructure, indicating the crystalline nature of compounds with diverse particle sizes. The schematic representations of the corresponding materials are also included in Fig. 6.

The XRD patterns of all dyes show sharp peaks as shown in Fig. 7. This indicates that compounds 3(a–d) easily form well-ordered molecular crystalline structures and well-defined diffraction peaks with a high degree of crystallinity.

2.7. Computational studies
The geometrical configuration and electron distribution of all target dyes 3(a–d) were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation using Gaussian W09 and subsequently optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.50,51 Optimized ground state geometries of the sensitizers are shown in Fig. 8. The different coplanarity between the aromatic rings is observed. The dihedral angles (θ) between the central π-linker, donor, and acceptor were calculated to be 37° (30°), and –35° (−36°), respectively.

All the calculated data are summarized in Table 2. The HOMO, LUMO, and the band gap energies of the photosensitizers play vital roles in providing the driving force for the electron injection. The calculated energies of the HOMO/LUMO range from −5.28/−4.84 to −2.11/−1.6 eV. Both energies correlate with experimental HOMO/LUMO levels obtained from electrochemical measurements. Although the variance between calculated and experimental data was large in some cases, overall the DFT calculations provide insight into trends in the type of transitions.

Representative visualization of electron density distributions in the frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. 9. In the HOMOs of all sensitizers, the electron density was predominantly localized over the π-linker with partial spread towards the peripheral phenyl rings. In contrast, the electron densities of the LUMOs are transferred to the opposing ends of the charge transfer pathways and are localized at acceptor moieties, because of the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the pyridine, COOH and CN moieties. Frontier orbitals of sensitizers suggest that the HOMO–LUMO excitation would shift the electron density from the donor to the acceptor moiety, facilitating efficient electron injection from the excited dye to the TiO2 electrode. It is likely that ICT states would be formed in these dyes. The calculated ground state dipole moments (μ) of dyes 3(a–d) range from 2 to 7 D with the highest one computed for 3a.

2.8. TiO2 electrode preparation and DSSC fabrication
A dye-sensitized solar cell consists of a TiO2 photoanode as a working electrode, a platinum counter-electrode and electrolyte containing the iodide/triiodide redox couple. To prepare the working electrodes, FTO glasses were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath, rinsed with water and dried at 60 °C prior to use. Initially, a thin layer of TiO2 paste (PST-18NR, CCIC) was coated on the FTO glass with a working area of ∼0.5 × 0.5 cm2 by a doctor-blade technique, and then sintered at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. The doctor-blade method and sintering procedure were repeated 2 more times, in order to reach 3 layers of TiO2 paste. Afterwards, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into a 0.5 mM dye solution in ethanol and kept at room temperature for 12 h. Finally, the dye-coated electrodes were dried using nitrogen gas flow, and stored in a vacuum desiccator at RT.
To prepare the counter electrodes, two holes were drilled in the FTO glass with a drilling machine. Then, platinum (Pt) paste (counter PT-1, Dyesol) was uniformly distributed on the FTO glass by the doctor-blade method, followed by heat treatment at 500 °C for 1 h. Ultimately, the dye-absorbed TiO2 electrode and the Pt counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell and sealed with Surlyn (60 μm) by hot-pressing. Furthermore, the commercially purchased electrolyte (Dyesol, electrolyte HPE) was slowly injected into the cell through the holes presented in the counter electrode side. Here the electrolyte served as a redox mediator. These holes were then sealed by a cover glass and pressed under thermal conditions to prevent leakage of the electrolyte. The schematic diagram of the fabricated DSSC is presented in Fig. 10(a).

2.9. Photovoltaic measurements
The photovoltaic performances of dye absorbed TiO2-based DSSCs were measured using a photocurrent system embedded solar simulator (ABET, SUN 3000) with a 300 W xenon short arc lamp and a source meter (Keithley 2400). Accordingly, the photovoltaic performances (i.e. J–V curves) of the fabricated devices are presented in Fig. 10(b). The characteristics of the fabricated DSSCs such as short-circuit current density (Jsc) obtained by the current powered by the device at V = 0 V divided by the active area of the cell, open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) encountered for the deviation of the experimental J–V curve, and PCE were calculated by the following formulas and the obtained values are summarized in Table 3. (3) (4)where, Vmp is the voltage at the maximum power point, Jmp is the current density at maximum power point and Pin is the power incident radiation.3 The J–V curves, show that the device fabricated with the 3a dye absorbed TiO2 photoanode showed higher Jsc and PCE values of 4.54 mA cm−2 and 1.44% compared to the other dye absorbed devices, which are of 2.96 mA cm−2/1.03%, 1.38 mA cm−2/0.38% and 0.238 mA cm−2/0.056% for the 3b, 3c and 3d dyes, respectively. The higher PCE of the 3a sample is mainly due to ICT between the donor and acceptor, which is supported by DFT calculations (Table 3). Moreover, 3a exhibited lower HOMO energy levels and higher oxidation potential, which helps in reducing the iodine backward transfer and enabled transfer of the electrons effectively from the electrolyte solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report studying the photovoltaic performance of conjugated dyes composed of a DPP spacer, N,N-dimethylamine and thiophene as donor groups and several anchoring groups (pyridine, COOH, and CN). Though the presented output performance of prepared conjugated dye is not competitive with the ruthenium-based commercial dye, it could pave a new way for the development of cost-effective organic dyes for DSSC applications.

3.1. Materials and instruments
All chemicals for synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, while PdCl2(PPh3)2 was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the solvents were purchased from Dea Jung Co., Ltd. All NMR measurements were carried out using a Bruker instrument at 500 MHz for 1H NMR and 126 MHz for 13C NMR, using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as the solvents, respectively. Chemical shifts were reported as δ (ppm) relative to TMS and coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded by a 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF LC/MS system. MW reactions were carried out with Initiator plus Microwave Synthesizers from Biotage. TGA and DSC were performed using TGA 3 plus and DSC 2 STAR systems, respectively, under nitrogen with heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Varian Cary-50 spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectra were measured using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (excitation slit 5 nm). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed using a ZIVE-SP2 LAB system. The chromophores were also characterized by X-ray diffraction (Smartlab, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of thin films was studied by SEM using a FEI Quanta 3D FEG scanning electron microscope. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 system under a simulated AM 1.5G. The DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.

4. Conclusions
In this study, we designed and synthesized DPP based π-conjugated chromophores with a D–π–A molecular framework via a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction. The DPP scaffold was decorated with different donors and acceptors. The optical properties of these π-conjugate systems could be easily tuned by varying the electron donors and acceptors linked to DPP. TGA and DSC analyses show that the present dyes are thermally stable for application in DSSCs. Among all the dyes, 3a shows good efficiency (1.44%). The theoretical calculations provide insight into the nature of the excited states of the dye, and show that all dyes present significant charge transfer characteristics. We hope our work will provide a rational guideline for the future design of D–π–A organic dyes with a dipyrrolopyrazine linker, towards preparing more efficient DSSCs.
