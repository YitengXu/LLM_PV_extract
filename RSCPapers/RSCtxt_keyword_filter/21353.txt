    , Accepted 3rd December 2018First published on 4th December 2018AbstractThe conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS), is certainly one of the most important substitute materials for indium tin oxide in organic devices. Its metallic conductivity and transmittance bring favorable perspectives for organic photovoltaic applications. Although graphene oxide (GO) is not a good conductor, it can form high-quality thin films and can be transparent, and additionally, GO is an inexpensive material and can be easily synthesized. This study investigated how the conductivity of a composite film of graphene oxide (GO) and different amounts of PEDOT:PSS can be modified. The effects of GO:PEDOT:PSS composites with several PEDOT:PSS proportions were analyzed in regards to the composite molecular structure and ordering, charge transfer dynamics (in the femtosecond range), electrical properties and morphology. For the best conductivity ratio GO found with 5% PEDOT:PSS, a solvent treatment was also performed, comparing the resistivity of the film when treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and with ethylene glycol.
Introduction
The major advantages of solution-processable organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are their compatibility with flexible substrates and the different techniques that can possibly be used for large area applications, such as spray-coating, inkjet printing and roll-to-roll.1 These features provide the practicability and option for OPV to be used as an alternative low-cost source of renewable energy. Intense efforts have been focused on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device, which nowadays is reaching the milestone of 17.3%.2
The device structure follows layer-by-layer steps onto a conductive electrode that is usually an indium tin oxide (ITO) film. However, the ITO has some disadvantages (mainly for being expensive and easy to break when deflected), which results in an unwanted setting of device upscaling. The search for new electrodes that are solution processable and able to produce a comparable or higher performance than ITO is one of the main pursuits of organic solar cells studies.3–6 The electrode must provide both high optical transparency and high electrical conductivity concomitantly. In the last few years, several varieties of materials have been used as an electrode in OPVs, including carbon nanotubes, Ag nanowires, oxide derivatives and conjugated polymers. One of the predominant materials that is used is doped polythiophene derivative, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) PEDOT.7 However, the PEDOT itself exhibits a poor solubility in any solvent, resulting in a non-optimized morphology. A mixture PEDOT:PSS can be dispersed in water, showing a high-quality film. However, the insulator properties of PSS can increase the resistivity of the film. Several treatments have been investigated due to significant improvement of the PEDOT:PSS conductivity.4,8–10 For instance, Yamamoto et al. demonstrated that spin-casted PEDOT:PSS films had their sheet resistance reduced after a single step treatment with hexafluoroacetone (HFA).11 Li et al. reported that the nonionic surfactant PEG-TmDD could enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS to 526 S cm−1,9 and Yu et al. presented several treatments of PEDOT:PSS with organic solutions that significantly enhanced its conductivity, being common results found amongst other reports.12
Nevertheless, another promising approach is the use of graphene oxide (GO) to increase the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS.13,14 A water-soluble composite, previously reported by our group,15 was obtained through a simple bulk mixture between GO and PEDOT:PSS without the use of any surfactant. These films present a resistivity of 0.13 Ω cm, which is significantly lower than that of pure PEDOT:PSS. However, the reasons behind the reduction of the resistivity in the composite film are lacking and remain unexplored. With that context taken into consideration, in this study the composite molecular structure, charge transfer dynamics and morphology of GO:PEDOT:PSS with different PEDOT:PSS proportions in the composite were analyzed. The results found in this work may contribute to the understanding of lower resistivity of PEDOT:PSS:GO films in a balanced proportion. Moreover, in an attempt to reach a more efficient electrode, a solvent treatment was performed on the film using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene glycol by drop casting and then dip casting the film in the solvents.
Experimental section
The graphene oxide used was obtained by a chemical route of graphite oxidation, using natural graphite (Graflake) supplied from the company Nacional de Grafite.16,17 The composites were obtained by directly mixing 3.0 mL of GO dispersion (0.15 mg mL−1) and defined volumes of the PEDOT:PSS (Sigma-Aldrich, 500 μg L−1 PEDOT, 800 μg L−1 PSS) solution by vigorous magnetic stirring for 24 h. Some samples of GO:PEDOT:PSS were prepared with 1% (0.03 mL), 5% (0.15 mL) and 10% (0.3 mL) (v/v) of PEDOT:PSS, as well as neat GO and pristine PEDOT:PSS samples for comparison. As substrates, we used glass and every sample had an area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 each. Films of GO:PEDOT:PSS were obtained by drop casting the blends over glass substrates and put to dry at room temperature for 4 hours followed by a thermal annealing at 80 °C, performed on a hot plate for 30 minutes. Both processes were carried out in room atmospheric conditions.
For the investigation of the resistivity of the films, the four-probe technique (in the Jandel Universal probe equipment) was used, performing 10 measurements in each sample. By applying this technique, a forward and a reverse current flow were considered and as an outcome, the sheet resistance (RS) was obtained. To attain the thickness (t) of the films, 10 measurements of profilometry were made in each sample, using Veeco Dektak 150 equipment. It is important to mention that in order to avoid border effects; the edges of the samples were neglected. Using the relation ρ = RSt,15 the resistivity (in Ω cm) was calculated. The unit of RS is Ω sq−1 and the thickness is cm.
The solvent treatment was performed in order to reduce the resistivity of the film, as reported by Nagata et al.18 where treatment with DMSO was used. Okuzaki et al.19 employed ethylene glycol to enhance the conductivity. Here in this study, a different composite was utilized to raise the conductivity, and the technique for that was drop casting 100 μL of the solvent and then setting it aside to dry at room temperature. After that, the film was dip cast in the solvent and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. The procedure to obtain the resistivity of the films remained the same as explained above.
The surface morphology of the films was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using Shimadzu SPM 9700 equipment in a non-contact mode, and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in a TESCAN MIRA 3 FEG-SEM microscope. The Raman spectra were obtained by using a Renishaw Raman Imaging Microscope System 3000. The laser excitation line used was He–Ne (632.8 nm).
The spectroscopic experiments were carried out at the Brazilian Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (LNLS), using the Soft X-ray Spectroscopy (SXS) beamline. A Si(111) double-crystal monochromator was used to cover the sulfur K-edge absorption region. This configuration provides a photon bandwidth of 0.38 eV. The beamline details and the experimental set-up have been reported elsewhere.20 Near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra were obtained indirectly by measuring the electron current at the sample (drain current) in the total electron yield (TEY) mode simultaneously with a photon flux monitor (Au grid). The final NEXAFS data were normalized by this flux spectrum to correct the fluctuations in beam intensity. The well-known energy value for the LIII transition of metallic molybdenum (2p3/2 → 4d) was used for energy calibration of a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. The polarization dependence was evaluated by measuring NEXAFS spectra at different incoming X-ray incident angles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger decay spectra were measured by a hemispherical electron energy analyzer employing a pass energy of 20 eV. No beam damage effects were observed for the photoabsorption or photoemission spectra. For curve fitting analysis of the resonant Auger spectra (RAS), a linear combination of Gaussian (G) and Lorentzian (L) peak shape functions was used. For background correction, a Shirley function was selected in an electron kinetic energy range from 2103 to 2120 eV.
Results and discussion
AFM micrographs for neat GO and pure PEDOT, as well as the composites, are presented in Fig. 1. The pure GO film image shows a rough surface formed by the overlap of GO sheets, unlike the very smooth PEDOT:PSS film surface. In the composites, no trends were observed related to the different GO:PEDOT:PSS proportions. The SEM images present in Fig. 2 confirm that the sample containing 5% of PEDOT:PSS is clearly the most homogeneous, with few aggregates, and smoother than the other two composites. These morphological differences can have a significant effect on the charge distribution over the films.

Raman spectroscopy was applied to analyze the carbon structure in the composite films and investigate the changes that occur at a molecular level with the incorporation of PEDOT:PSS quantities. Fig. 3 presents the Raman spectra for compounds containing 1, 5 and 10% PEDOT:PSS, in addition to pure PEDOT:PSS and pristine GO. First, the correspondent bands were identified using the spectra of pure films. The GO films have well-defined D and G bands at 1336 and 1605 cm−1, respectively. The G band is due to the Csp2–Csp2 stretching modes and the D band corresponds to a Raman mode that becomes active due to the presence of defects in the graphene-like structure. In the PEDOT:PSS film the vibration modes of PEDOT components are clearly observed. At 1430 cm−1 there is a prominent band matching the symmetric CαCβ stretching mode of thiophene rings, while the 1567 cm−1 band is attributed to asymmetric CαCβ stretching. The Cα–Cα inter-ring stretching vibrations and Cβ–Cβ stretching deformations are observed at 1257 and 1365 cm−1, respectively.13 The Raman spectrum for GO:PEDOT:PSS films shows the bands of individual materials but with different intensity as the PEDOT:PSS proportion increases in the composite.

The decrease in the GO:PEDOT:PSS ratio in the composites becomes evident by narrowing the region between 1200–1800 cm−1, due to the decrease in the intensity of the D and G bands of GO. Furthermore, it was also observed that the conformation of PEDOT chains changes with the interaction of GO sheets. When the proportion of GO in the film increases, the band of the symmetric CαCβ stretching mode is shifted to higher wavenumbers. This particular red-shift is attributed to conformational changes of thiophene rings. This result leads to the conclusion that the GO sheets are directly affecting the PEDOT from the benzoid to quinoid structure. The structural modification from benzoid to quinoid with GO:PEDOT interaction was also observed in other studies.21 No changes in PSS bands were observed.

Fig. 4 shows angular dependent S–K edge NEXAFS spectra for GO:PEDOT:PSS composites and neat PEDOT:PSS films. The photoabsorption spectrum is characterized by two main absorption features, which correspond to electronic transitions from the sulfur 1s electron to unoccupied molecular orbitals.22 Following the assignments for gas-phase23 and poly(thiophene) thin films,20,24 the first and less intense feature corresponds to the overlapping of S1s → π* and S1s → σ* (S–C) transitions of the PEDOT (2472 and 2473.2 eV, respectively). The most intense peak is assigned to S1s transitions of the PSS dopant, since the sulfur chemical bonding changes from S–C in PEDOT to highly oxidized sulfur (SO3) in PSS, affecting their energy levels, and consequently the energy absorption. Casu et al. also reported an active influence of the presence of PSS in C1s and O1s NEXAFS spectra measured for PEDOT:PSS thin films.25 The angle-resolved S1s NEXAFS spectra for pristine PEDOT:PSS and GO:PEDOT:PSS composite thin films showed noticeable increment in the intensity of the S1s → π* transition, as opposed to the S1s → σ* behavior with the increase in the incident angle (θ) of the synchrotron radiation (measured with respect to the substrate surface). The observed opposite behavior of the π* and σ* transitions suggests that the thiophene-unit in PEDOT is preferably oriented with the molecular plane perpendicular to the substrate surface. By analyzing the π* intensities (peak areas) at grazing and normal incident angles, a higher difference for GO:PEDOT:PSS (5%) was calculated as shown in Table S1 (ESI†), pointing to a more organized film, which may reflect the higher conductivity presented by this nanocomposite. Furthermore, no clear angular dependence was observed for PSS, which indicates that the sulfur units of this polymeric dopant film have a more amorphous nature.

Sulfur KL2,3L2,3 Auger decay spectra were acquired by tuning the excitation energy. Fig. 5 plots Auger decay spectra at the PEDOT photon resonance energies (2472 eV and 2473.2 eV) and after the sulfur ionization potential for GO:PEDOT:PSS 5% and 10%, and neat PEDOT:PSS films. GO:PEDOT:PSS 1% RAS spectra can be found in the ESI.† Some changes were noticeable.

After the deconvolution procedure, a set of contributions could be identified. On the first resonance photon energy, two narrow peaks were identified at around 2113.7 eV and 2115.4 eV. Following previous studies for other thiophene-based systems,20,24,26 both are well-known spectator Auger decay channels (2 holes and 1 excited electron final state). The broad peak with constant kinetic energy of 2112 eV is a thiophene-characteristic normal Auger decay channel (2 holes state), the 1D2 final state, as discussed previously.24 The presence of these three peaks at the resonance energy position is evidence of electron delocalization during the Auger decay occurring in the femtosecond regime. After the sulfur ionization potential (2496.5 eV photon energy), the Auger decay spectrum should contain only peaks related to normal Auger decay processes. At this photon energy, an intense feature is clearly recognizable at 2108 eV kinetic energy, beyond the 2112 eV normal Auger peak. It is assigned to another normal Auger decay channel, due to the sulfur atom from the PSS dopant. This value is consistent with the normal Auger decay peak found for inorganic sulfates and sulfites.27–29 The width of the normal Auger peak is larger when compared to other Auger decay features caused by the delocalized character of the electron involved in the charge transfer process.30 For the deconvolution procedure, the position of the normal Auger peak was kept at around 2112 eV while the other peaks could shift, and the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) value of the normal Auger contribution was maintained higher than that of the spectator contributions.
Charge transfer times (τCT) were calculated from the branching ratios of the spectators and normal Auger signals through the Core-Hole Clock (CHC) method,24,31,32 using the sulfur core-hole lifetime of 1.27 fs33 as an internal clock to monitor the electron delocalization dynamics in the femtosecond range. These results are plotted in Fig. 6 as a function of the PEDOT:PSS percentage. The calculated times are in the low femtosecond regime. In general, these values show a linear decrease, ranging from 4.7 fs obtained for neat PEDOT:PSS to 3.3 fs encountered for the GO:PEDOT:PSS 5% composite. However, the calculated τCT increases to 5.7 fs when changing to GO:PEDOT:PSS 1%, the largest delocalization time between the analyzed films. Those spectroscopic results reinforce previously reported synergistic effects found between GO and PEDOT:PSS15 nanocomposite films, where a detailed study of electrical and optical properties of GO and PEDOT:PSS mixtures was presented.

Fig. S1 (available at ESI†) shows the XPS survey spectra for all analyzed films (neat PEDOT:PSS and GO:PEDOT:PSS composites), normalized by the maximum peak intensity. All expected core-level peak contributions were detected, namely: S1s, S2s, S2p, O1s, C1s and the Auger S KLL peak. The detected Na is attributed to the PSS−–Na+ since sodium residues are from the Na2S2O8 oxidizing agent used during the PEDOT polymer synthesis.34 Nitrogen traces were also detected.
S1s core-level photoemission spectra acquired for neat PEDOT:PSS and GO:PEDOT:PSS composites are plotted together in Fig. S2 (also available at ESI†) after normalization by the maximum intensity peak. Since there are two sulfur atoms with different chemical environments (S–C from PEDOT polymer and S–O from PSS dopant, respectively, with lower and higher binding energies), two peaks were clearly identified: the first one, at a lower binding energy (at around 2469 eV) and thus attributed to photoelectrons emitted from the PEDOT molecule, is weaker in comparison with the second feature at a higher binding energy (at around 2474 eV), related to photoelectrons emitted from the PSS dopant molecule. We have also noted that this lower energy peak decreases as the graphene oxide concentration increases, which is probably due to the lower amount of PEDOT available at the surface when compared to other composite thin films.
The measured thickness of the films is around 130 nm, and considering that, the resistivity was calculated. The neat PEDOT:PSS film has 0.36 Ω cm of resistivity. For the neat GO film under the same conditions, the resistivity is around 40 Ω cm. Our lower resistivity composite film was obtained with 5% PEDOT:PSS commercial aqueous solution in GO dispersion, as explained above, with the resistivity of 0.035 Ω cm, one order of magnitude less than that of the neat PEDOT:PSS film. In the interest of being competitive as an OPV electrode, a solvent treatment was performed, following some recipes from the literature,35–37 where the PEDOT:PSS films were treated with several solvents to reduce its resistivity. From these papers, one can notice that better results are credited to polar solvents, due to a preferential solvation of the PEDOT and PSS chains, inducing a phase separation and a conformational change of the PEDOT chains.35 The enhancement of conductivity in the case of DMSO solvent is caused by the induced screening effect between counterions and charge carriers, reducing the columbic interaction between the positively charged PEDOT and the negatively charged PSS chains.36 Besides that, Yong et al.37 conveyed that a polar solvent treatment with ethylene glycol and other polar solvents provides differences in the structure of the polymer, revealing that the PEDOT grains are transformed from curved domains to a stretched network, raising the contact area between the PEDOT chains and then decreasing the resistivity because it improves the carriers’ pathways. Thus, in this study, we chose two polar solvents DMSO and ethylene glycol that are not harmful. Then solvent treatments were performed in the samples, washing out the samples with DMSO and ethylene glycol to compare their effects. After the treatment, the results were similar for both solvents, and the resistivity could be decreased by one order of magnitude, considering a sample before and after the treatment. On washing the samples with DMSO, the resistivity value is ρDMSO = 0.0036 Ω cm and with ethylene glycol, the resistivity value is ρEG = 0.0033 Ω cm. Nevertheless, another important characteristic, also reported in the literature,35–37 is the transmittance enhancement of the treated films. In this study, a similar trend was also noticed in the samples, as presented in Fig. S4 (available at ESI†). The PEDOT:PSS 5% film improved by around 15% its transmittance.
Conclusion
The combination of PEDOT:PSS and graphene oxide (GO) was considered as an efficient alternative structure for indium tin oxide (ITO) in organic photovoltaics, due to the elimination of some drawbacks of ITO, such as high production costs and breakable structure under deflection. In this regard, some experimental techniques such as Raman and NEXAFS spectroscopies, and atomic force and scanning electron microscopies were performed to investigate the structure of the composites with different proportions. Charge transfer times at the sulfur 1s absorption edge were calculated by the core-hole clock method and the final results demonstrated the faster electron delocalization process for the composite containing 5% of PEDOT:PSS with a value of 3.3 fs, which may be related to the higher homogeneity and ordering of this film, as probed by AFM and SEM, and NEXAFS, respectively. This remarkable and singular result can supply highly efficient material with some superior properties like flexibility, low cost and high safety, which can be used as a leading electrode in different types of organic photovoltaics. Moreover, it is possible to argue that the application as an electrode can be competitive in the market, considering that it is possible to lower the price for attaining the anode, using a little amount of PEDOT:PSS in a GO matrix, obtaining films with improved resistivity and transmittance values.
