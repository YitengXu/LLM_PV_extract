    , Accepted 14th December 2021First published on 20th January 2022AbstractElectrode materials with exceptional cyclic stability and high-rate performance have been in extensive demand for the fast growth of energy storage applications. The focus of this article is on the recent progress, scientific challenges and future developments of advanced materials as anodes based on the two-dimensional (2D) MXene-based hybrid materials used in next generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). There is a big issue that extensively affects their performance, such as the restacking aggregation problem of MXene flakes. To address this issue, a basic and effective approach is to combine MXene with suitable and advanced materials, such as silicon, tin, different carbon nanofillers, metal oxide, phosphorous, metal sulphide and layered double oxide, to form the MXene hybrid composites. MXene surfaces have been modified in many ways, including decorating with silicon and tin-based nanoparticles, bridging networks with carbon nanofillers, and forming a heterostructure between graphene and MXene layers. The hybrid material has led to high ionic mobility, high diffusivity of Li+-ions, and electrical conductivity apart from specific capacity. In the current scenario, advanced electrode materials of LIBs should be highly promising to enhance the electrochemical performance of the batteries to make it more efficient than previously observed. The MXene-based hybrid nanostructure materials provide insight into future challenges and guidelines for finding new materials used in next-generation energy storage applications.
1. Introduction
Rechargeable batteries are an essential requirement of modern society due to their multiple applications in the field of electronic devices. In the last 30 years, with the growing energy demand, rechargeable batteries have generated a significant focus in research and development with the prime attention directed toward lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To fulfill the basic requirements for the new power source, electric vehicles (EV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), consumer electronics, and grid-scale energy storage have provided remarkable interest in modern society.1–8 Conventional LIBs consist of a transition metal oxide as a cathode and graphite as the anode. Electrode materials play an important role in the performance of the batteries. Various advance materials have been synthesized to fulfill the basic requirement of the electrode performance of batteries, such as longer lifespan, higher energy density, and better rate performance.9 Recently, the two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have drawn significant research interest due to their outstanding physical and chemical properties. Due to their excellent properties, the incorporation of 2D-layered materials has significantly improved the performance of conventional devices, such as batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, fuel cell, and photo-thermal therapies.10–20 Since 2004, the discovery of graphene and its derivatives has provided successful materials used for energy storage applications to improve the charge transport properties. In recent years, numerous 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal oxides (TMOs), h-boron nitrides, metal–organic frameworks (MOF), and perovskites, have been extensively studied.21–23 In 2011, scientists and researchers at Drexel University discovered the 2D material, known as MXene.24,25 MXenes have drawn significant research interest due to their outstanding performance in various energy storage and conversion applications. MXene is the layered form of the metal–ceramic phase (MAX) with the formula Mn+1AXn, and its phase refers to the hexagonal layered transition metal carbides and nitrides.26–29 The term “n” can be assigned the value 1, 2, and 3. M represents an early transition metal element (Ti, Zr, Ta, Mo, V, Zr, Mo, Ta, Hf, etc), “A” represents the elements of groups 13 and 14 in the periodic table, and “X” is the carbon/nitrogen.30
Kshetri et al.31 reported the development of MXene research from the beginning in 2011 to 2020. The first MXene material, Ti3C2Tx, was discovered at Drexel University using the selective etching technique of Al from Ti3AlC2 by hydrofluoric acid (HF).25 After this, various other MXenes, such as Ti3CNTx, Ta2C3Tx, (V,Cr)3C2Tx, and (Ti, Nb)2CTx, were investigated in 2012, and became a large family of 2D materials. In 2013, the single-layer MXene flake was first synthesized by intercalation and delamination with organic molecules.32 In 2014, Ti3C2Tx MXene was synthesized using a mixture of LiF/HCl, instead of extremely concentrated HF acid. In the year 2015, MXene research studies were in progress and increased the yield of the delamination of MXene using organic intercalation.29,33,34 The double-layer transition metals were MXene  where M′ and M′′ were two different early transition metals.35 Tao et al.36 reported on significant research in the contribution of MXene for the synthesis of ordered divacancies of MXene. They reported the synthesized ordered divacancies of MXene after the etching of the TM (transition metal) from an in-plane double transition metal MAX phase. Urbankowski et al.37 reported the synthesis of a 2D transition nitride (Ti4N3)-based MXene. In this method, molten fluoride salt was used for the etching of Al from the Ti4AlN3 powder precursor at approx. 550 °C in the presence of an argon atmosphere. The delamination resulted in a few and single layers of Ti4N3Tx, where “T” is the surface termination (F, O or OH). At the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018, researchers were finding the solution of the restacking, degradation and oxidation stability of MXene. The restacking of MXene flakes led to the research direction toward the synthesis of MXene nanocomposites for various applications.38–43 In 2018 and 2019, various researchers reported on MXene-based hybrid nanocomposites like MXene–metal oxides, MXene–silicon, and MXene–polymer composites for a variety of applications.44–47 In 2020, a water-free etching method solution containing the ammonium dihydrogen and polar organic solvent was used to produce the F-terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene. The water-free etching of MXene will make it possible to use MXene in numerous water-sensitive applications.48 In 2021, the synthesis of MXene was achieved using the halogen etching technique. Fig. 1 shows the historical fabrication of MXene.

The Ti2AlC structure of the MAX phase consists of four atomic layers of Ti–C–Ti–Al. The bilayers of Ti are closely packed atoms. The monolayer of the carbon atom occupies the octahedral sites between the layers of Ti atoms, although the monolayer of the “Al” atom is inserted between two periodic units of the Ti–C–Ti tri-layer.49 The octahedral structure of Ti6C is analogous to rock salt and the Al atoms occupy the centre of trigonal prisms. MXenes are produced from their corresponding layered structured of the bulk ceramics MAX phase via selective etching of the “A” layers (group 3 or group 4 elements) by fluoride-based chemicals (given in Table 1), and the Xn surfaces are often terminated by a mixture of OH, F, and/or O.50–52 For the attachment of the functional group on the surface of the layers, the MXene materials are considered to be highly adjustable in chemical and structural forms. The chronological discoveries of the synthesis of MXene are given in Table 1.

The MXene flakes have suffered from restacking and aggregation because of the strong van der Waals forces of attraction, which affect the performance of the materials and their practical applications. The surface modification of MXene flakes, such as heteroatom doping, coating, and introducing the nanofillers between the flakes, is used to address the issues. The hybridization material of MXene is converted into 3D structures at the micro or macro levels to overcome the problem of the MXene layers. The unique features of MXene hybrid materials include the large redox-active surface area and high electrical conductivity, which help in electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications. The hybrid nanomaterials have not only boosted the fast ion diffusion and fast electron migration, but also improved the stability of the electrode structures and hybrid interface.
This article highlighted the recent development of the MXene hybrid material and its electrochemical performances. Various nanoparticles, such as Si, SiOx, SiO, SiO2 and Sn, SnO, SnO2 carbon nano materials, metal oxide, metal sulphide, phosphorous and layered double hydroxide, have been used as fillers within the MXene. The main aim of this article is to summarize the most up-to-date progress of the MXene hybrid materials as electrodes in LIBs. We discussed the overview of MXene, followed by the synthesis, properties and composites of MXene-based hybrid nanomaterials used as an anode electrode in LIB. The challenges and opportunities for the MXene and its hybrid for next-generation advanced materials are discussed. The outlook and future perspectives of MXene-based hybrid materials used as an electrode are also discussed briefly.
2. Preparation of 2D metal carbides and nitrides
Mostly, the MXene compound is prepared by single metal carbides, like Ti3C2 and Ti4C3. MXene compounds are also synthesized by binary metals.  phases have also been successfully synthesized by B. Anasori, where M′ and M′′ are the two different metals for the synthesis of MXene.35 Mo2TiC2 and Mo2Ti2C3 MXenes are successive examples of binary metals. Fig. 2(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Mo2TiAlC2 before etching (red color) and after etching (green), which terminates to a blue colour, respectively. Mo2TiAlC2 shows the layered structure. After the etching, the peak around 62° is also seen after the delamination peak disappeared. The disappearance of the peaks after the delamination indicates that the layers are restacked randomly, and the crystallographic axis is maintained properly. The XRD plot of Mo2Ti2C3 also exhibits similar behaviour, but the lattice parameter of the Mo2Ti2AlC3 powder (pink plot) is 23.5 Å. It increased up to 34.6 Å after delamination, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(e and j) shows the SEM images of the parent MAX phase and Fig. 2(f and k) exhibits their MXene. The confirmations of the 3D-to-2D transformation of both materials are shown in Fig. 2(b and d). Fig. 2(g and h) shows the high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) images of Mo2TiAlC2 and Mo2TiC2Tx, respectively. Fig. 2(g and h) exhibit the presence and absence of the Al layer, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(h). Mo2Ti2C3Tx shows similar behaviour at the presence and disappearance of the Al layers, as shown in Fig. 2(l and m). The HRSTEM images give clear evidence for the removal of Al layers by etching. The low magnification TEM images show the flake-like layered structure, as shown in Fig. 2(i and n).

2.1 Synthesis of MXene
The synthesis of MXene has several challenges, such as difficulty in preparation, tendency to oxidize, agglomeration and difficulty in exfoliation. The novel MXene materials are produced by etching the layers from their corresponding MAX phases. MXenes are usually synthesized by a selective etching technique under suitable conditions and the use of a solvent for the extraction of the “A” element in the MAX phase. MXene exhibits varying properties depending upon the synthesis condition, such as concentration and nature of etchant, nature of the solvent, and reaction time. The size, thickness, and surface area of the MXene flakes affect its electrical conductivity and the rate performance of the battery. These factors significantly influence the oxidization kinetics of the synthesized MXene. Fabrication techniques also affect the thermal stability and surface terminations, which fabricate different MXenes having specific properties. Therefore, the oxidative degradation of MXene is not controlled only by the parameter of synthesis of MXene, but also by the quality of the parent MAX phase, etching conditions, type and concentration of the etching acid. An early example of Mn+1XnTx (Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2(OH)2) was formed by the removal of Al atoms layers from the Ti3AlC2 phase formed using the etching solvent, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF),94–96 fluoride containing,56,97 sputtering, and exfoliation at high temperature.98
We discuss recent innovations and current technologies used for the synthesis of the MXenes with selective etching materials for the removal of Al layers from the bulk MAX phase using HF acid and sonication of the MAX phase to separate the multilayer of MXene into the few layers. An acid-containing aqueous solution of fluoride has commonly been used for the etching purpose. The etching technique includes the stirring of a layered MXene powder with the aqueous fluoride solution at a suitable temperature and time. In this method, “A” layer of MAX is removed by etching, which changes the metallic bond in the MX phase to the weak bond due to the surface attachment of the different functional groups on the layers of the MXene. The layers of MXene is centrifuged and filtered to isolate the supernatant from the solid materials, and washed properly with deionised water to maintain the pH at nearly 6.26 The reaction occurs at normal temperature with aqueous hydrofluoric (HF) acid used as an etching reagent. Ti3AlC2(s) + 3HF(aq) = Ti3C2(s) + AlF3(aq) + 3/2H2(g)(1) Ti3C2(s) + 2HF(aq) = Ti3C2F2(s) + H2(g)(2) Ti3C2(s) + 2H2O(aq) = Ti3C2(OH)2(s) + H2(g)(3)
HF acid is a hazardous solvent, so alternative solvents are used to avoid the problem of hazardousness. Ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2) and HCl/LiF are successively used for the removal of the Al layers. The common reactions occurring in the removal of Al layers are Ti3AlC2(s) + NH4HF2(aq) = Ti3C2(s) + (NH4)3AlF6(aq) + 3/2H2(g)(4) Ti3C2(s) + 2HF(aq) = Ti3C2F2(s) + H2(g)(5) Ti3C2(s) + 2H2O(aq) = Ti3C2(OH)2(s) + H2(g)(6)
Reactions (5) and (6) show the surface termination with hydroxyl or fluorine groups. The 2D-layered Ti3C2 nanosheet consists of two exposed Ti atoms in the unit cell. Besides, there are also 2D transition metal (TM) carbides, which can be prepared from the non-MAX phase.
Various research groups have reported the synthesis of MXene using the fluoride-free etching technique. Compared with HF, the fluoride-free etching technique is mild and safer for the preparation of MXene. The fluoride-free etching technique is an efficient electrochemical approach for the delamination of MXene in a binary aqueous electrolyte. In this method, the Cl-ions enable the rapid anodic Al etching and break the Ti–Al bonds. The fluoride-free etching technique does not need any hazardous fluoride-containing solution and is useful for the synthesis of novel MXene materials.89,99,100
According to the various theoretical results, the attachment of the functional groups on the surface of the MXene have significant influence on the electrochemical performances. According to the Lewis acid molten salt etching technique, MXenes with the specific functional groups, such as Cl, I and Br, have been successfully synthesized. However, MXene synthesis processes by various techniques contain Cl, OH or F. Thus, it is important to develop some more suitable and optimized synthesis techniques. Li et al.101 reported the fabrication of Zn-containing MAX phases and the preparation of –Cl terminated MXene based on this technique with the original materials of Ti3AlC2 and ZnCl2. In Ti3ZnC2, the fabrication mechanism of Zn-containing MAX can be discussed as follows: Ti3AlC2 + 1.5ZnCl2 → Ti3ZnC2 + 0.5Zn + AlCl3(7) Ti3AlC2 + 1.5ZnCl2 → Ti3C2 + 1.5Zn + AlCl3(8) Ti3C2 + 1.5Zn → Ti3ZnC2(9)
Unsaturated Zn2+ can act as a strong Lewis acid because they strongly accept –Cl and electrons. The weakly bound Al3+ can be easily be oxidized and further bonded with the –Cl to form AlCl3. Due to the low boiling point of AlCl3, it can easily escape from the original system at high temperatures. Ti3ZnC2 was formed by in situ technique and reduction of Zn atoms intercalated into Ti3C2 layers, and occupied the A sites.102
The 2D transition molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) has been synthesized by chemical vapour deposition of methane and molybdenum.63,66 This carbide MXene has been effectively synthesized at a high temperature in the presence of gaseous precursors of hydrogen and methane.66,103–105 The CVD method has also been used for the synthesis of a MXene-based heterostructure.106 In addition to the CVD technique, Xiao et al. reported the fabrication of ultrathin 2D transition metals (W2N, Mn2N2, and V2N) using a salt template approach.107,108 The transition metal carbides (Ti4C3, Ti5C4) were synthesized by the in situ atomic layer growth on the substrate (TiC) with a similar hexagonal metal lattice. MXene materials have also been synthesized using the magnetron sputtering. Using the magnetron sputtering, the MAX (Ti3AlC2) thin film has been deposited on the sapphire substrate using the Ti, Al, and C targets. After the deposition, absorption of the MXene/sapphire by an etching agent for the development of the MXene phase, Ti3C2Tx is observed. MXenes have also been prepared by the exfoliation technique. The electrical conductivity of exfoliated MXene is reported to be 6500 S cm−1.109
MXene layers have also been synthesized from the MAX phase at high temperature. In 2016, the nitride-based MXene was synthesized at high temperature by sintering process. In the experiment, a molten mixture of fluoride salt (KF, LiF and NaF) was used in an inert atmosphere (argon) at the high temperature of 550 °C to remove the Al layer from its Ti4AlN3 phase. Additional material was delaminated in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide for the formation of the monolayer of Ti4N3Tx.37 The etching efficiency was increased by gentle heating. A few authors have also reported the sublimation of the In layers from the Ti2InC at a temperature of 800 °C for the formation of TiCx in vacuum,110 and the removal of the Si layers from Ti3SiC2 at the high temperature of approximately 970 °C using the mixture of molten cryolite.111 Xu et al.66 reported the fabrication of the high quality and defect-free MXene flakes by the chemical vapour deposition technique. In this method, the copper foil was used as a substrate and molybdenum (Mo) foil was placed on the top of the substrate. Methane gas was used as the carbon source at the temperature above 1085 °C. At this temperature, Cu was dissolved to form a Cu–Mo alloy at the interface. The Mo atoms diffused through the interface. Consequently, Mo reacts with the carbon of the methane gas, which was disintegrated and made alloying the growth of the ultrathin alpha-Mo2C crystal with the lateral dimension of 100 μm. The hexagonal layer of the TiC single adlayers formed on the surface, and formed the Ti3C2 MXene using the electron beam radiation and thermal exposure at the temperature above 500 °C.112 This technique provides a controlled synthesis of high quality with a large surface area transition metal carbide MXene material. Initially, the MAX phase was formed by the mixing of the elemental powder of M, A and X in the fixed atomic weight ratio and ball-milled samples. The ball-milled samples are usually prepared by using cold or hot-pressed techniques to form the compressed materials, and reduce the number of voids and cracks present in the material. The pressed samples influence the orientation of grain growth. To avoid the influence of the grain growth orientation, pressure-less sintering has been done by using the sintering of the MAX powders at a certain temperature. Li et al.113 studied the pressure-less sintering method for the preparation of Ti3AlC2, and reported that MXene growth in this technique was highly oriented as compared to the Ti3AlC2 material obtained from the hot-pressing technique. Once the MAX phase is formed, the “A” element is etched to form the MXene phase. The intercalation and delamination techniques are useful for the fabrication of single-layered MXene sheets. In this process, the etching and delamination, and parameters such as the crystalline number of layers, and surface-functionalization are affected. The MXene prepared during the delamination affects the edge of the lamellar structures, and might break the MXene sheets.114
3. Properties of the MXene
3.1 Structural property
The 2D structure of the MXene is achieved by the elimination of the “A” element from the 3D MAX bulk phase. The etching technique is used for the synthesis of 2D MXene and the removal of the “A” element from the bulk MAX phase. The single layer of MXene flake has a hexagonal lattice, similar to graphene sheets. Fig. 3(a) shows the top view of 2D M2X that has a rhombus unit cell. The side outlook shows the X-layer, which is sandwiched between the two layers of transition metal (M). According to the theoretical results, the transition metal M is configured by six chemical bonds with the nearest neighbour “X” atoms attached to functional groups on the surface, and leads to the formation of M2XF2, M2X(OH)2, and M2XO2.

A and B indicate the different types of hollow sites in panel (a).

Two types of hollow sites on the surface of M2X exist as A and B, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The side view of the monolayer MXene consists of tri-layer sheets in which there are two TM layers sandwiched with the one X layer. On the other type, B sites have the X atoms lying in between the M. The attachment of the termination groups is classified according to configurations. Fig. 3 shows the different models: model 1, in which the two functional groups are positioned on the top of the two-transition metal. In model 2, two functional groups are placed on the top of the hollow sites A. In model 3, one functional group is located on the top of hollow site A and the other is placed on the top of hollow site B. In model 4, the attachments of two functional groups are positioned on top of hollow sites B.
Model 1 is energetically less stable as compared to the other three models. The structural stability of the other models depends upon the ionic state of the transition metal on the surface.116
3.2 Electronic properties
The pristine MXene is metallic and analogous to the MAX phase. The presence of surface termination groups on MXene exhibit the semiconducting properties. Depending upon the spin–orbital coupling, MXene can be divided into two types nontrivial117–119 and topologically trivial.116 MXene can be classified into metallic, semiconducting and semi-metallic type based on their electrical conductance.

3.2.1 Topological trivial semiconducting and metallic MXene. 
The presence of a surface-functional group on the surface of MXenes, like Ti2CO2, Zr2CO2, Sc2CF2, Sc2COH, Sc2CO2, and Hf2CO2 materials, indicates the presence of semiconducting properties. The energy band gaps are determined by general gradient approximation, which expose the band gap of these semiconducting MXenes, and the band gaps are 0.24 eV (Ti2CO2), 0.88 eV (Zr2CO2), 1.03 eV (Sc2CF2), 0.45 eV (Sc2COH), and 1.8 eV (Sc2CO2). The Sc2C(OH)2 compound has a direct band gap, and the other semiconducting materials have an indirect band gap. The Ti, Zr and Hf elements are considered in the same group in the periodic table, and the outermost filled orbital shell shows that the metallic-to-semiconducting behaviour (Ti = [Ar] 3d24s2, Zr = [Ar] 4d25s2, Hf = [Ar] 5d26s2) depends on the same type of functionalization.115 The F and OH groups give similar effects on the electronic structure of the pure MXene. The OH and F groups can receive the one electron from the surfaces. However, the oxygen group exhibits different effects because it demands the two electrons in the equilibrium state. Fig. 4(a) exhibits the metallic behaviour of Ti2C due to its Fermi energy locating at the “d” bands of the transition metal. In most of the MXene, the “p” bands of nitrogen/carbon in X occur below the “d” band, and are divided by a lower band gap. The surface functionalized MXene, such as Ti2CF2, still exhibits metallic behaviour because the Fermi energy level is still sited at the d orbital of the M layer as shown in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 4(c) shows the semiconducting behaviour of Ti2CO2 because the “d” band is raised above the Fermi level.

3.2.2 Topological non-trivial semiconducting and metallic MXenes. 
The spin–orbit coupling significantly affects the electronic properties. The heavy transition metals contain heavy 4d and 5d MXene. Without considering the spin–orbit coupling, the MXene M2CO2 and M′M′′C2O2, such as MoCO2, W2CO2, Mo2TiC2O2, Mo2ZrC2O2, Mo2WC2O2, W2TiC2O2, and W2ZrC2O2, act as semi-metallic with the zero-band gap. The semi-metallic behaviour of the MXene exists because of the valence band and the smallest conduction band, which contact with the Γ-point, and both bands show the parabolic behaviour. The M2CO2 and M′M′′C2O2 turned into semiconductors with an indirect band gap. Fig. 5 shows that the spin–orbit coupling behaviour, the degeneracy of the valence and the conduction band at the Fermi energy are raised and opened the band gap near the Γ-point. The band gap can be as large as 0.184 (0.472 eV) for W2CO2 and 0.285 (0.0401 eV) for W2HfC2O2, and similar features are observed in  as far as the spin–orbit coupling behaviour is considered.117,120 Compared to the other 2D materials, the Ti3C2Tx MXene has high intrinsic ionic/electronic conductivities.121,122 The electronic conductivity of Ti3C2Tx strongly depends upon the morphology and attachment of the functional group. The thin film of the Ti3C2Tx MXene is made of delaminates, and the few defects show a high conductivity of 9880 S cm−1.104,121

3.3 Mechanical properties
The mechanical properties of the MXene layers were calculated using the computational method. The mechanical properties of the MXene depend upon the thickness, surface termination and the formation of composites. The value of the Young's modulus is measured from the slope of the stress–strain curve of MXene, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a–c) shows the stress–strain curve under different strain rates. The stress–strain curves under the various strain values have a linear region of elastic deformation. Fig. 6 exhibits the Young modulus of Ti2C, Ti3C2, Ti4C3 as 597, 502, and 534 GPa, respectively.

MXene exhibits unique features like hydrophilicity and good electrical conductivity, and can host numerous dissimilar cations between their layers. Due to these extraordinary features, MXene is used in various potential applications, mainly focused on the energy storage applications including the fabrication of electrodes for lithium-ion, sodium-ion and potassium ion batteries,124–126 Li–S batteries,127 Li-ions, and aqueous supercapacitors.33,95 Various other potential applications include fuel cell membrane,128 electrochemical actuators,129 photocatalysis, water purifications130 and transparent electrodes and sensors.131–135
4. MXene and its composites in lithium-ion batteries
In the past decades, graphite has been used for energy storage and conversion systems.136–138 Recently, various carbon nanofillers, such as carbon nanotube (CNTs), fullerenes, and graphene, have been used as an anode electrode to improve the electrochemical performance of the LIBs due to their high electronic conductance, flexibility, and outstanding mechanical properties.139–147 After the discovery of MXene, it shows significant potential for energy storage and conversion devices. MXene exhibits excellent mechanical properties, electrical conductance, and proton exchange. The MXene-based secondary batteries are representative of the energy storage devices. LIBs have been extensively used in the field of portable electronic devices due to their good cyclic performance and high energy density.
4.1 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
LIBs are the promising candidates used for energy storage devices due to their high energy density, and are widely used in various portable devices, electric vehicles, and wearable and electronic devices.148–151 In the commercialized LIBs, graphite is used as the most popular anode material because of its cyclic stability and intercalation of Li-ions.152,153 The materials used in LIBs consist of porous carbon, such as graphite, that is usually used as the anode and metal oxide for the cathode.154,155 The electrolytic solution consists of lithium salt in an organic carbonate solvent including lithiated ions. LIBs consist of a cathode as an electron acceptor, an anode as an electron donor, and an ionic electrolyte to connect both electrodes and separate. The materials that are commonly used as the cathode electrode include manganese cobalt oxide, nickel oxide; lithium nickel, spinel, borate, silicate, tavorite, and others in the batteries due to their high energy density and cell voltages. The mechanism behind the charging/discharging of the batteries, during the charging, cations, or anions generated from the one electrode (anode) and adsorbed to the other electrode are shown in Scheme 1. It works on the principle of the faradaic reaction in the bulk of the active materials and provides the high energy density. During the charging/discharging process, the LIB involves the reversible insertion and extraction of Li-ions in the cathode/anode. During the charging process, the Li-ion is extracted from the cathode electrode and inserted into the anode. Meanwhile, during the discharging process, it is associated with the release of a Li-ion from the anode and is taken up again in the cathode. The cathode and anode electrode materials have a significant impact on the performance of the secondary batteries because they host the charging/discharging process. MXene with the layered structure and large specific surface area could provide the additional active sites for the Li-ion insertion. Therefore, it enhanced the electrochemical performance.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of MXene-based anode batteries. 
The theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mA h g−1, which cannot satisfy the rapid demand for high energy density. To improve the electrochemical performance of LIBs, the development of the new electrode materials is significant. Researchers are continuously putting efforts into designing the new materials for the anode electrode, which have a higher lifetime, higher safety, high-rate performance, and capacity as compared to graphite. MXene-based materials are widely used in batteries due to its excellent electronic conductivity, high volumetric capacity, fast ion diffusion, high intrinsic specific area, proton exchanger. Due to these extraordinary properties of the MXene, it has attracted the attention of scientists focus on the development of high capacity anodes. The performance of the batteries depends upon the cathode, anode, and the electrolyte. The MXene-based anode electrode plays a significant role in the performance of the batteries.
4.2 MXene based anodes in LIBs
Rechargeable batteries are energy storage devices, having features of high work voltage and high energy capacity, flexible, long cycle life, lightweight, environment friendly, cost-effective, and other properties. After the discovery of MXene, the 2D MXene have been widely used in batteries as electrode materials. Titanium carbide MXene has been reported as the most significant material used as an anode in LIBs. Many other MXene materials have also attained considerable attention as an anode.156–158 Naguib et al.54 reported on the new 2D Nb2C and V2C MXene materials, which are used as an anode electrode in LIBs. The Nb2C and V2C MXene material was prepared by etching Al atom from Nb2AlC and V2AlC at room temperature. After 150 cycles, the value of the reversible capacities was recorded as 170 and 260 mA h g−1 at 1C and 110 and 125 mA h g−1 at 10C, respectively. Yu et al.158 reported the fabrication of 2D TaxCy (x = 2 and y = 1, or x = 1 and y = 1–4) as the anode material in LIBs. They reported that the 2D TaC, TaC2 and Ta2C materials exhibit high thermal stability. The metallic behaviour of TaC2 and Ta2C provided good electronic conductivity. The carbon-rich TaC2 material contains the dimers of carbon on the surface, which in turn, permit the direct absorption of the Li-atoms. The specific capacity, open-circuit voltage, and diffusion of the energy barrier of TaC2 were observed to be much better as compared to the commercial graphite, and monolayer of Ti2C and Ti3C2. Zhou et al.71 reported the syntheses of 2D Hf3C2Tz MXene using HF as a selective etching method of layered Hf3[Al(Si)]4C6. The 2D MXene showed a good reversible volumetric capacity of 1567 mA h cm−3 after 200 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1 for LIBs. Du et al.157 reported the fabrication of multi-layered Ti3CNTx MXene using the environmental friendly LiF and HCl as the etchant. The sample achieved the discharge capacity at 300 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycle as 0.5 A g−1. Y. Wang et al.159 reported the fabrication of (Vx, Ti1−x)2C MXene (x = 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3 and 0) via the selective etching technique from (Vx, Ti1−x)2AlC. The exfoliation of (Vx, Ti1−x)2C MXene exhibited excellent electrochemical properties and optimized the (V0.5,Ti0.5)2C MXene, which possessed the high value of reversible capacity of 205 mA h g−1, and the CE was approximately close to 100% at 1 A g−1. J. Zhou et al.160 reported the fabrication of 2D V4C3 MXene by selective etching of Al layers from V4AlC3 in HF in the presence of 55 °C. The 2D V4C3 MXene exhibited a high-capacity good rate capability and high cyclic performance. The 2D V4C3 MXene delivered a high specific capacity of 225 mA h g−1 after the 300 charge/discharge cycles at the current density of 0.1 A g−1 and 125 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. Titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) gained significant attention as a new anode for LIBs due to its unique features. Tang et al.161 reported the theoretical calculation of density functional theory to investigate the electronic and Li-storage capability of Ti3C2. The theoretical capacities of Ti3C2Li2, I-Ti3C2F2Li, I- and Ti3C2(OH)2Li0.5 were 320, 130 and 67 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to the open circuit voltages (OCV) of 0.62, 0.56 and 0.14 V, respectively. It indicates that the surface functionalization reduces the OCV, which is beneficial for the anode materials in LIBs. Mashtalir et al.32 reported that when Ti3C2-based papers were used as the anode without using any binder, the value of the capacity reached 410 mA h g−1 (at 1C rate). M. Naguib et al.53 reported that Ti2C MXene material was used as an anode in LIBs. They reported that the electrochemical performance and specific capacity of the Ti2C MXene material was 225 mA h g−1 at C/25. After the 80 cycles, the value of the specific capacity was reported to be 110 mA h g−1 at (1C) and 80 mA h g−1 (at the rate of 3C). The specific capacity was 70 mA h g−1 at 10C after more than 200 cycles.
D. Sun et al.162 reported the synthesis of 2D materials by the exfoliation of Ti3AlC2 using the HF solution and subsequent intercalation in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. The electrochemical performance of the Ti3C2 anode electrode was recorded. After intercalation, Ti3C2 possessed higher capacity as compared to the material before intercalation. Fig. 7(a) exhibits the cyclic voltammetry performance of the Ti3C2 material at the rate of 0.2 mV s−1. During the lithiation process, the two reduction peaks were observed at nearly 1.66 V and 0.62 V. In the 1st delithiation process, the anodic peaks were recorded at 1.99 V and 2.44 V. The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the exfoliated Ti3C2 by HF (ex-Ti3C2) and Ti3C2 intercalated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) after the exfoliation (in-Ti3C2) at 1C are shown in Fig. 7(b). The charging/discharging capacity of in-Ti3C2 was 264.5/123.6 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 47%. On the other hand, the charging capacity of ex-Ti3C2 was 107.2 mA h g−1. Fig. 7(c) shows the capacity loss of ex-Ti3C2 and in-Ti3C2 at 89.7 mA h g−1 and 118.7 mA h g−1 respectively, after the 75 cycles. Fig. 7(d) exhibits the charging/discharging curves of Ti3C2 at a different rate. Fig. 7(e) exhibits the CE, which is increased to 98–99% after the 10th cycle. Fig. 7(f) shows that ex-Ti3C2 possesses good rate capability.

The restacking and low instinct capacity of the titanium metal carbide limits its practical applications. So, researchers tried to solve this issue by introducing various nanoparticles reinforced in MXene to improve the electrochemical performance of the MXene. The MXene hybrid materials have improved the specific capacity of the electrodes.
4.3 MXene-based composites
MXene materials have suffered various problems, such as the synthesis route, synthesis of MXene in bulk production, life cycle of MXene flakes, thermal and oxidative stability of MXene layers in aqueous medium, difficulty in preparation, restacking and agglomeration problems.
To overcome these issues, various nanomaterials are used as a filler and MXene as a matrix to form the composites. The MXene composites have significantly improved electrochemical performance. The MXene hybrid has been used as electrodes in LIBs. Numerous materials (sulfur (S), tin (Sn), silicon (Si), phosphorus (P), aluminium (Al), silicon oxide (SiO), graphite, and lithium–titanate–oxide (Li4Ti5O2)) have been used for the development as an anode material to improve the performance of LIBs.163–166 The theoretical capacity of Li4Ti5O2 is 175 mA h g−1, which limited the energy density of LIBs. The Li (3862 mA h g−1) and Mg (3350 mA h g−1) metals have a high theoretical capacity, but the safety issues are of major concern. Tin and lead-based anodes are the problem of the lithiation/delithiation process, which challenges the stability of the batteries. Various talented anode materials have been developed for the LIBs, like Si, SiO, SiO2, Sn, SnO2 carbon fillers, metal oxide, phosphorous, metal sulphide and layered double hydroxide, to form the MXene hybrid composites, as shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Various fillers used in MXene to form the MXene hybrid. 
The silicon–MXene hybrid materials have been used as the anode electrode materials in LIBs, as they improve the charge-to-charge properties and extend the life of the LIBs 5 times higher, as compared to the commercial graphite. Si-based MXene hybrid composite materials have significant potential in the replacement of the graphite due to its unique features. The preparation of the titanium carbide MXene is simpler than that of graphene, as it reduces the difficulty found for the preparation of the composite materials. The initial CE of the Si MXene-based hybrid materials is large as compared to Si–graphene because of its lower surface area (SA). The silicon nanocomposites make good electric contact with the MXene. The Si-based MXene hybrid provides more space for the ions within the anode, and they can move more quickly as compared to the other Si–carbon materials. Si and its oxides are being used as the high-performance anode materials for the next-generation LIBs, and are discussed in the following sections.167–169

4.3.1 Silicon (Si), SiO, SiO2, SiOx/MXene hybrid materials. 
The Si-anode has generated significant research attention for the synthesis of high-performance LIBs owing to its low working potential, earth-abundant element, ultrahigh theoretical lithium storage capacity, and environment friendliness.167,170,171 Si has been intensively used as an anode material for batteries due to its high theoretical capacity, it is considered as an excellent anode electrode material for the next generation. For the Si based-anode, rapid capacity fading and initial low CE has limited its practical applications. Other issues of the Si-anode in LIBs are its low ionic diffusivity, poor electrical conductivity, low power output efficiency, and regeneration of the unstable solid electrolyte interphase.172 To avoid these issues, various approaches have been implemented like reducing the size of Si particles into the nanoscale, protective layer coating on the Si surface, and the Si material used as a hybrid material. The Si-doped Ti3C2 is an excellent layered material used in LIBs, which shows the faster Li+ ion diffusion with lower Li+ ion diffusion barrier, as compared to graphite. LIBs with high energy density are in popular demand for various electronic devices. Kong et al.172 reported that Si/Ti3C2 composites were prepared by ultrasonic technique. The capacity of the Si/Ti3C2 composite was 188 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 150 cycles, and improved capacity retention was observed. The improvement in the cycling stability and rate capability was due to the good electrical connection between the Si nanocomposites and Ti3C2. Zhang et al.173 reported the fabrication of Si/MXene composites via a mechanical mixing. The higher loading of the Si-particle with MXene suffered from the agglomeration problem and exerts a negative effect on the electrochemical performance. Q. Yang et al.174 reported the simple and effective technique for the fabrication of a Si nanoparticle attached within the MXene layer using the facile electrostatic assembly. In this method, Si-NPs were homogeneously adhered on the surface of the Ti3C2 MXene to form Si@Ti3C2.The sheets of Ti3C2 nanoflakes not only provide the electron and Li+ transport of the electrode materials, but also buffer the volume expansion of Si-NPs through charge/discharge. Si-NPs help to avoid the restacking of Ti3C2 MXene sheets and provide the additional active sites. The initial capacity of the Si@Ti3C2 anode was recorded as 3502.3 mA h g−1, the capacity of retention was 1342.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and CE was reached at 99.8%. J. Meng et al.175 reported that Ti3C2Tx scroll material was used in LIBs. The Ti3C2Tx scroll material used as anode materials in LIBs have better performance and higher capacity as compared to Ti3C2Tx sheets. The addition of 10% Si nanoparticle reinforced Ti3C2Tx showed the best rate capability as well as cyclic stability. X. Zhu et al.176 reported that sandwich-like Si/Ti3C2 hybrid materials were used as an anode in LIBs to improve the electrochemical performance. The reversible capacity of Ti3C2 was 1130 mA h g−1 after the 200 cycles. Y. Tian et al.177 reported on flexible, free-standing, and binder-free Si/MXene paper, which were used as an anode material in LIBs. The Si/Ti3C2Tx paper was fabricated through the covalent anchoring of the Si nanosphere on the MXene sheet using the vacuum filtration. The architecture of the Si/Ti3C2Tx paper contained the large volume expansion, solving the issue of restacking the MXene sheets, addition of active sites and providing the efficient ion transports. The cyclic voltammetric curves of the Si/Ti3C2Tx anode were analyzed. They reported on the reversible capacity of Si/Ti3C2Tx of 2930 mA h g−1 and CE of 71% at the 1st cycle. On the other hand, the reversible capacity of the pure Si anode was observed at 2142 mA h g−1. The results showed that the MXene sheets effectively enhance the electrical conductivity of the Si/Ti3C2Tx anode. The rate capability performance of Si/Ti3C2Tx was further analyzed by increasing the current density. The discharging capacities of Si/Ti3C2Tx were recorded at 1768, 1501, 1294, 1033, and 886 mA h g−1, corresponding to the current densities of 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 mA h g−1, respectively. X. Hui et al. reported167 on the low-temperature reduction method for the fabrication of the Si/Ti3C2 composites. The electrochemical performance of the Si/Ti3C2 composite was analyzed and showed an excellent specific capacity of 1849.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, even retaining 956 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. F. Zhang et al.178 reported the fabrication of a sandwich-like Si/Ti3C2Tx material using the electrostatic self-assembly. Fig. 9 shows the TEM and HRTEM characterization of the Si/Ti3C2Tx material.

Fig. 9 exhibits the TEM and SAED pattern of the Ti3C2Tx and Si/Ti3C2Tx composites. Fig. 9(a–d) shows that the Ti3C2Tx MXene possesses the 2D multi-layered structure and interlayer spacing of 0.98 nm. The HRTEM image of Ti3C2Tx represents the (110) lattice plane with d-spacing (0.306 nm), as shown in Fig. 9(c). The SAED pattern of Ti3C2Tx shows a hexagonal crystalline structure, as shown in Fig. 9(d). Fig. 9(e and f) exhibits the TEM images of Si/Ti3C2Tx MXene, in which the Si nanoparticles were decorated on the surface of the MXene (Ti3C2Tx) sheets. The average particle size of Si was in the range of 50 nm. Fig. 9(g) shows the HRTEM image of the Si/Ti3C2Tx composites and (111) lattice plane of the Si-nanoparticle with an interlayer spacing of 0.314 nm. The SAED patterns of Si/Ti3C2Tx exhibited the set of hexagonal diffraction patterns with the bright centre, as shown in Fig. 9(h). The electrochemical performance of the Si/Ti3C2Tx composites was found to be higher than Ti3C2Tx. The Si/Ti3C2Tx composites confirmed the initial reversible capacity of 1076.6 mA h g−1 at 300 mA g−1. After the 100 cycles, the capacity of Si/Ti3C2Tx was recorded as 643.7 mA h g−1 at 300 mA g−1, as compared to pure Si (75.1 mA h g−1).178 Several studies show that Si/MXene composites have been fabricated using physical mixing or in situ magnesiothermic techniques, in which the Si particles were randomly distributed. M. Xia et al. reported179 the fabrication of Si porous nanospheres (Si-p-NSs) wrapped in Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (TNSs) by the interfacial assembly technique. Fig. 10(a) exhibits the preparation technique for the Si-p-NS@TNSs composites. Fig. 10(a) shows separate methods for the preparation of the MXene and Si-porous nanosphere prepared by core–shell architecture (Si-p-NS@TNSs composites). MXene layers were wrapped on the surface of Si-p-NSs by interfacial assembly coupling with the magnesiothermic reductions. SEM was used to measure the surface morphology of the Si-p-NSs@MXene layer. Fig. 10(b) shows Si-p-NSs coated with the PMMA layer for the interfacial assembly and the insert TEM image shows the Si-nanosphere. The crumpled surface of the Si-p-NS@TNSs composite is also shown in Fig. 10(c). The TEM images were used to measure the core–shell structure of the Si-p-NS@TNSs composites, as shown in Fig. 10(d). The diameter of the porous spherical core was approximately 500 nm, and the observed thickness of the crumpled shell in the average range was 5 nm. The HRTEM image presented the interlayer spacing of 1.31 nm and lattice spacing of 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (002) and (111) planes of Ti3C2Tx MXene, as shown in Fig. 10(e). Fig. 10(f) exhibits the energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) of Si-p-NS@TNSs, which indicates the presence of Si, C, and Ti elements with uniform dispersions. The surface areas of the Si-p-NS and Si-p-NS@TNSs composites were analyzed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and the measured value was 124.91 m2 g−1 and 137.51 m2 g−1, respectively. The reversible specific capacity of Si-p-NS@TNSs was recorded 1154 mA h g−1 after the 200 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 current density, which was much higher as compared to TNS (215 mA h g−1) and Si-p-NSs (760 mA h g−1).179

Silicon monoxide (SiO) acts as an attractive anode material for LIBs due to its low working potential (less than 0.5 V vs. Li+/Li), easy synthesis, high theoretical specific capacity (2400 mA h g−1), nontoxicity, abundant natural source, and lower volume expansion, as compared to Si. Fig. 11(a) shows the SEM image of SiO particles, and it was found that the particle size of SiO was not homogenous. The SEM image of SiO-WM (WM = wrinkled MXene) material and the SiO particles were decorated on the wrinkled MXene sheets, as shown in Fig. 11(b). Fig. 11(c and d) exhibits the TEM image of SiO-WM and shows the amorphous nature of the SiO. Fig. 11(e–i) shows the EDS mapping for Ti, Si, O, and C. XRD was used to measure the crystalline and amorphous phase of the samples, as shown in Fig. 11(j). The XRD curves of the Ti3AlC2 and MXene film showed that after the etching of the Al layer, the peak at around 39° disappeared. Various other peaks were shifted towards the lower angles for the confirmation of the preparation of the MXene film.180 The XRD plot of the SiO-WM shows that the peak was observed near 60°. The XRD peak at 25° indicates the amorphous phase of SiO.181Fig. 11(k) exhibits the Raman spectra of the samples. The peak positions at 177 and 198 cm−1 in the MXene film were due to the out-of-plane vibration of C and the Ti-atom, respectively. The modes sited at 281, 390 and 621 cm−1 belonged to the Eg vibrations of Ti, C and O atoms present on the surface of the MXene film.182 The peaks positioned at 162 and 472 cm−1 indicate the presence of amorphous SiO.183 The Raman spectrum of SiO/wrinkled MXene shows the overlapped positions of the spectra of MXene and SiO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the presence of the elemental and chemical compositions of SiO-WM. Fig. 11(l) shows that Si (2p) is divided into five peaks and defined as Si0 (98.7 eV), Si1+ (99.3 eV), Si2+ (102.2 eV), Si3+ (102.9 eV), and Si4+ (103.5 eV). The XPS spectrum of O 1s exhibited the elementary composition with binding energy (BE) as SiO (531.9 eV) and SiO (532.6 eV), as shown in Fig. 11(m). Similarly, the BE of Ti (2p) bonds Ti–C (454.4 eV), Ti2+ (455.4 eV), Ti3+ (457.7 eV), Ti–O (458.2), C–Ti–Fx (460.4 eV), as shown in Fig. 11(n). The BE peak of C 1s varied between 281 eV to 288.5 eV, as shown in Fig. 11(o).184Fig. 11(p) shows the charge/discharge profile of the SiO and SiO-WM material. The initial discharging specific capacity of the SiO and SiO-WM material was 1987 and 1945 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, respectively. The initial CE of SiO-WM and SiO was 69.5% and 61.3%, respectively, because of the lower presence of SiO in the SiO-WM material. The compatibility rate of SiO-WM was better as compared to SiO, as shown in Fig. 11(q). The initial discharging capacity of SiO-WM at 200, 600, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1 was 1945, 1230, 1129, and 985 mA h g−1, respectively. On the other hand, the initial discharging capacity of SiO at 200, 600, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1 was 1987, 1107, 997, and 713 mA h g−1, respectively. The cyclic performance of SiO-WM was enhanced as compared to SiO. The Si-based MXene hybrid nanocomposites provide new insight for the application in the field of electrode materials for LIBs.

Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is the most abundant material that exists on the earth and is known as silica. SiO2 is commonly found in nature in the form of amorphous and crystalline polymorphs. The crystalline polymorph is the major constituent of sand, and the amorphous form of SiO2 is found in living organisms, reed leaves, rice husks, and others.186,187 The cyclic stability of SiO2 is better as compared to Si. The major problem of SiO2 is its inertness to Li and poor conductivity.188 To overcome this issue, the SiO2-based MXene hybrid material is used as an anode for LIBs. MXene has suffered the problem of agglomeration and SiO2 is inserted within the sheet to avoid the problem. J. Liu et al.189 fabricated the SiO2/Ti3C2 composites using three different techniques, such as sol–gel (ST-1), centrifugal–drying (ST-2), and freeze–drying (ST-3). The SiO2/Ti3C2 composites prepared by the freeze–drying process showed excellent electrochemical performance as compared to the other technique. The reversible discharging capacity of ST-3 was 242.4 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. G. Mu et al.190 reported that SiO2/MXene composites were prepared by the combination of stober and spray drying techniques. The cyclic voltammetry performance of the SiO2/MXene anode in the voltage range of 0–0.3 V at the scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 was observed. The charge/discharge curves of the SiO2/MXene anode in the 1st and 100th cycles were recorded. During the 100th cycles, the charge/discharge capacity of the SiO2/MXene anode was 798/799 mA h g−1. The CE of the SiO2/MXene anode was analyzed to 96.4% in the second cycle and maintained 99.9% in the consequent cycles at 200 mA g−1 current density. The CE of the SiO2/MXene anode was 99.5% at the current density of 1 A g−1 in the 6th cycle.
Like SiO and SiO2, SiOx has shown significant potential in the anode material for the next generation LIBs. The value of the oxygen content in SiOx is lower than one.191 M. Jiang et al.192 reported the core–shell(@) preparation of the Ti3C2@Si/SiOx@TiO2 anode material for LIBs. They reported the electrochemical performance of Ti3C2@Si/SiOx and Ti3C2@Si/SiOx@TiO2 composites. During the initial 10 cycles, the Ti3C2@Si/SiOx@TiO2 composites exhibited the highest cyclic stability and improved the capacity retention properties. The initial charge/discharge capacity of the Ti3C2@Si/SiOx@TiO2 anode material reached 1668/2517 mA h g−1 with an increased Initial Coulombic Efficiency (ICE) of 67%. After the 10 cycles, the value of the reversible capacity of retention of the Ti3C2@Si/SiOx and Ti3C2@Si/SiOx@TiO2 composites was stabilized at 75% and 35%, respectively. On the other hand, the Ti3C2@Si/SiOx@TiO2 composite was observed to be stable and exhibited a CE greater than 98%. The reversible capacities of the Ti3C2@Si/SiOx@TiO2 anode with the current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1 were maintained at 1536.0, 1116.7, 873.9, 801.2, and 355 mA h g−1, respectively. The Si-based MXene hybrid material forms a conductive network to enhance the charge transport properties in LIBs.


4.3.2 Sn, SnOx and SnO2-based MXene anode material. 
Tin (Sn)-based materials have been commonly used as an anode material in LIBs. It is a remarkable material for the anode electrode due to its low cost, high theoretical capacity, and natural abundance.193 However, they suffer from the problem of low electronic conductivity and huge volume expansion in lithiation and delithiation, which restrict their practical applications.194 The hybrid or surface-modified Sn-based materials overcome these issues.
Sn/MXene has excellent electrochemical performance and holds a significant demand for next-generation batteries. Sn/MXene presented a better cyclic performance and a higher specific capacity because the MXene layer stabilizes the nanoparticle and has easy migration of the Li+-ion. Z. Wang et al.195 reported the fabrication of the 3D Sn@Ti3C2 anode material using a layer-by-layer manner through the self-assembly of LIBs. The Sn@Ti3C2 anode showed a specific capacity of 666 mA h g−1 after the 250 cycles. The Sn@Ti3C2 anode exhibited a charge/discharge capacity of 701/1039 mA h g−1 in the initial cycle and CE of 77.4%. S. Zhang et al.196 reported the fabrication of the Sn complex-pillared Ti3C2Tx (STCT).
The STCT composites were prepared by the introduction of the Sn nano-atomic particle into the interlayer MXene using the pillaring technique. Fig. 12(a) shows the schematic illustration for the preparation of the STCT composite using the etching, sonication, and pillaring process. Fig. 12(b) exhibits the AFM image of the few-layered structure of Ti3C2Tx and the profile height of the nanosheet indicated the presence of 2 or 3 layers. Fig. 12(c) shows the SEM image of Ti3C2Tx MXene. The TEM image confirmed the few-layered structure of Ti3C2Tx, as shown in Fig. 12(d and e). Fig. 12(f and g) exhibits the SEM image of STCT composites with a lamellar structure. The TEM image revealed the uniform distribution of Sn nanoparticles on the surface of the Ti3C2Tx layers, as shown in Fig. 12(h). The HRTEM image clearly shows that the distribution of the Sn nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 12(i–k). The CV curve of the STCT composites was recorded between 0.01 and 3 V (shown in Fig. 12(l)). The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the STCT composites at various cycles are shown in Fig. 12(m). The charge/discharge capacity of the first cycle was recorded as 1219.7/1892.4 mA h g−1 with 68.4% of ICE. Fig. 12(n) exhibits the rate performance of the STCT electrode, and was measured at the current densities from 50 to 5000 mA g−1. The value of capacity decreased progressively as the current density was increased. The value of discharging capacities at 500 and 5000 mA h g−1 was recorded as 882 and 662 mA h g−1, respectively. Fig. 12(o) shows the rate capability and specific capacities of LIBs as compared to the previous literature.197–199 The CE quickly reached up to 97.2% at the 2nd cycle and remain stable at 99.7% during consequent cycles, as shown in Fig. 12(p and q). J. Luo et al. reported200 the fabrication of pillared Ti3C2 MXene (CTAB-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2) via a facile liquid phase using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) prepillaring and Sn. The CTAB-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 showed excellent cycling stability at higher current density. The capacity of CTAB-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 was delivered at 408 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after the 100 cycles. Zhang et al.201 reported the preparation of 3D delaminated-Ti3C2 (d-) xerogel framework coated with the core–shell SnO2@C nanoparticle using PVA-assisted sol–gel technique, and defined as SnO2@C d-Ti3C2 xerogel. They reported the initial charging/discharging and rate performance of the SnO2@C /d-Ti3C2 xerogel. The discharging capacity was 1314.3 mA h g−1 and CE reached 66%, which was higher as compared to SnO2@C (1196.1 mA h g−1 and 55.4% CE) and d-Ti3C2 (519.8 mA h g−1 with 65.4% CE). The charging and discharging curve at 20–2000 mA h g−1 current densities showed the best rate performance. The reversible capacity of the SnO2@C/d-Ti3C2 xerogel reached up to 520 mA h g−1, after the 1000 charge/discharge cycle at 1 A g−1. At 10 A g−1, the value of the reversible capacity was still achieved at 205.6 mA h g−1 with the discharging capacity of 169 mA h g−1 and CE of 99.5% after 1000 cycles. H. Liu et al.202 reported the fabrication of zero-dimensional to two-dimensional (0D–2D) SnO2 quantum dots (QD) Ti3C2 hybrid via facile electrostatic self-assembly technique. The composition of the MXene weight was varied during the time of the sample preparation, and the samples were designated as SnO2-(QD)/MXene-51 (amount of MXene 20 mg) and SnO2-(QD)/MXene-52 (amount of MXene 40 mg). The QDs of SnO2 behaved like a spacer to avoid the restacking between the MXene sheets, and provided a capable path for the electron and Li-ions to migrate between the sheets. The charge/discharge curve of the samples (SnO2, Ti3C2Tx MXene, SnO2-(QD)/MXene-51, SnO2-(QD)/MXene-52) at 100 mA g−1 was analyzed. The initial capacities and CE of Ti3C2Tx MXene were 79.2 mA h g−1 and 34%, respectively, which was attributed to the restacking of MXene.203 The initial capacity of SnO2-QDs reached up to 840 mA h g−1. The charge/discharge capacity faded very quickly due to the pulverization of SnO2. The initial capacity of SnO2-(QD)/MXene-52 reached 670 mA h g−1 with 91% retention after the 100 cycles. The SnO2-(QD)/MXene-52 exhibited better electrochemical performance as compared to SnO2-(QD)/MXene-51, due to the amount of MXene. The reversible capacities of SnO2-(QD)/MXene-52 was recorded at 887.4, 584.5, 454.8, 409.8 and 364.0 mA h g−1 as the current densities of 100, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mA g−1, respectively. J. Luo et al. reported199 the preparation of Sn4+ ion decorated on the MXene composite by a facile polyvinyl-pyrrolidine (PVP)-assisted liquid phase technique and defined as (PVP-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2). Fig. 13(a) shows the XRD pattern of Ti3C2 and Ti3AlC2. The XRD curve clearly shows that the mean peak (002) shifted towards the smaller angle after the etching and the lowered value of the “c” parameter. The crystallinity behaviour of Ti3C2 was lost after the etching. The SEM image of Ti3AlC2 is shown in Fig. 13(b). After the etching of Ti3AlC2, the material got converted into Ti3C2. Fig. 13(c and d) presents the SEM image of exfoliated Ti3C2 MXene. Fig. 13(e) exhibits the TEM image of the layered structure of Ti3C2 MXene. Fig. 13(f) shows the cross-sectional HRTEM image of Ti3C2 MXene with the interlayer spacing at 0.983 nm along the c-axis. Fig. 13(g) shows the HRTEM image of Ti3C2 MXene, and the measured d-spacing of 0.242 nm. Fig. 13(h) represents the morphology of the Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 composites and the agglomeration of Sn4+ nanoparticles was analyzed. The SEM image of PVP-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 composites showed the distribution of particles on the surface, and the interlamination of the MXene sheet is presented in Fig. 13(i and j). The TEM image of the PVP-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 composite is shown in Fig. 13(k), and the inserted image reveals the size of the Sn(IV) nanoparticles. The fringe spacing was analyzed at 0.214 and 0.228 nm, corresponding to the (105) and (104) planes, respectively, and is shown in Fig. 13(l). Fig. 13(m–p) shows the element mapping of Ti, O and Sn.

Fig. 13(q) shows the CV curves of the PVP-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 samples, which were analyzed at the voltage range from 0 to 3 V. In the 1st cathodic process, four reduction peaks were observed. The first two peaks were recorded at 1.5 V and 1.15 V due to the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).204 The third peak at 0.75 V was attributed to the trapping of the Li+-ion between the MXene. The fourth dominant peak at 0.5 V represented the reversible dealloying process. The CV curve from the 2nd to 5th cycles corresponded to the good reversibility of the PVP-Sn(IV) @Ti3C2 sample in the electrochemical performance. Fig. 13(r) exhibits the charge/discharge curves of PVP-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2. In the 1st cycle, the charging/discharging capacity was recorded at 851/1487 mA h g−1 with 99% CE, as shown in Fig. 13(s). At the increased current density, the value of the stable charge/discharge capacity of PVP-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 was recorded. The values of the discharge capacity at 108.3, 541.3, 1082 and 6495 mA cm−3 were 1662, 1374.8, 1238.8, and 505 mA g cm−3, respectively. X Sun et al.205 reported the fabrication of an ultrathin SnOx nanosheet decorated with the Ti3C2 to form the SnOx@Ti3C2 composites. The SnOx@Ti3C2 composites were prepared via the hydrothermal technique. They measured the charge/discharge curve of SnOx, Ti3C2Tx, and SnOx@Ti3C2 composite. The charge/discharge capacities of Ti3C2Tx were 214/422 mA h g−1, which corresponds to 50.7% CE, due to the attachment of various functional groups present on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. The SnO anode exhibited the charge/discharge capacities at 1060/1350 mA h g−1, corresponding to the CE of 78.7%. On the other hand, the initial charge/discharge capacities of the SnOx@Ti3C2 composites were 337/575 mA h g−1 with CE of 58.6%. The value of the charge/discharge capacities of the SnOx@Ti3C2 anode was recorded to be much higher than the Ti3C2Tx at every value of the current rate. D. Zuo et al.194 reported the fabrication of a sandwich-like structure of Sn/SnOx@Ti3C2 MXene composites. The Sn/SnOx@Ti3C2 MXene composites were prepared by facile electrostatic attraction and liquid phase reduction techniques. Initially, the charging and discharging capacities of the Sn/SnOx@Ti3C2 MXene composite were 1981 and 1169 mA h g−1, respectively, with 59% of CE recorded. The first discharge capacities of Ti3C2 MXene and Sn/SnOx were observed at 481 and 1474 mA h g−1, respectively. The synergetic effects of the Sn/SnOx@Ti3C2 MXene composites exhibited higher electrochemical performance as compared to the Ti3C2 MXene and Sn/SnOx.
Sn is also a suitable candidate for anode materials for LIBs due to its remarkable properties. Sn-based MXene hybrid materials exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance. These exhibited high electronic conductivity, rapid Li-ion diffusion, additional active sites, and variation in spacing between the layers, which benefits in terms of preventing the volume expansion of Sn during lithiation/delithiation. SnO2 is a promising material used as anode materials because of its high theoretical capacity. SnO2-based MXene materials have excellent electrochemical performance for the negative electrode in LIBs. The next-generation advanced material for storage devices requires an improvement in the energy density and power density.

4.4 Carbon nanofillers-based MXene hybrid composite anode material
Over the past few decades, the researchers have continuously explored and developed the flexible electrodes and replaced the metallic materials with the flexible conducting network.206 Various types of carbon nanofillers, such as carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, carbon cloth, carbon bucky paper, and reduced graphene oxide, have been used as a flexible substrate to load active materials to form the composite electrode for a lightweight and flexible material for LIBs.207–209 Researchers continue to explore the design and manufacturing techniques for new materials with different methods, such as doping, controlling the size of the materials, and introducing conductive materials, such as carbon-based materials, polymers, conductive metals, and others.210–214 Composite materials usually show improved performance as compared to the individual one. The ionic and electronic conductivities are the two essential factors in the electrode materials, which influence the electrochemical performance of the batteries to a great extent. Carbon nanofillers are the most popular nanomaterials, which are used as reinforcement nanofiller to form the composites, and are used as an anode for LIBs. Carbon nanofillers are significant materials that are used as interlayer spacers between the MXene flakes.215–217 Various research groups have focused on the fabrication of MXene–carbon nanofillers hybrid materials to prevent the problem of the restacking of MXene flakes, and improve the electrochemical performance in energy storage applications, such as LIBs,218–221 lithium sulfur batteries,42,222 and supercapacitors.219,223,224 Various carbon fillers, such as graphene, CNTs, carbon nanofibers and activated carbon,225–227 graphite, carbon aerogels, and others,228–233 have been used to develop the MXene-based carbon fillers hybrid for electrode applications in the energy storage devices. Carbon nanofillers are generally used in anode electrodes due to their good electronic conductivity, flexible material, lightweight and good compatibility, as compared to the other electrode materials.234–236 Researchers are continuously focusing on the development of advanced electrode materials based on the carbon nanofillers to promote industrial applications for the various secondary batteries.

4.4.1 Carbon nanofiber/MXene hybrid composites for anode materials. 
Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) possess the one-dimensional (1D) carbon structure, used as an electrode material within secondary batteries due to its high electronic conductivity along with the longitudinal directions. Several research groups have reported that CNFs are used as electrode materials, and reported the electrochemical performances of the batteries.210,237–241 Z. Lin et al.242 reported the preparation of multi-sacking MXene particles used in the anode electrode of the LIBs. The growth of CNFs bridges within the gap between the MXene flakes, as well as outside the MXene flakes. The cobalt-based catalyst precursor and poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) were loaded on the surface and within the MXene flakes. The polymer was used to avoid the agglomeration of the catalyst particles within the MXene layers. The modified MXene flakes were placed in the quartz tube furnace for CNF growth on the MXene surface. In the charge/discharge curves of the Ti3C2Tx/CNF hybrid at 1C and after the 295 cycles, the value of the specific capacity observed was still constant at 320 mA h g−1. At the rate performance of 1, 3.5, 8.5, and 30C, the value of specific capacity of the Ti3C2Tx/CNF were recorded to be 320, 180, 145, and 106 mA h g−1, respectively. At 100C, the capacity of the Ti3C2/CNF hybrid particle was reported to be slightly lower than that for Ti3C2Tx. The Ti3C2/CNF hybrid electrode provided a steady capacity of 97 mA h g−1 after 2900 cycles.


4.4.2 Carbon nanotube/MXene hybrid composites for anode materials. 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are another 1D allotrope of carbon. CNTs are the outstanding nanomaterials with the unique hollow structure and capability of forming a nano–mesh structure with good electronic transport properties.243 As advanced carbon nanomaterials, CNTs have been extensively studied. Various researchers have reported the binder-free self-supporting CNTs films and their use for the flexible anode electrode. The binder-free CNTs films have excellent potential for flexible energy storage devices, such as flexible electronic and wearable equipment.213,244–246 So, the CNTs nanofillers can make the hybrid with other materials to form the flexible electrode.
P. Yu et al. reported221 the fabrication of a Ti3C2Tx/CNTs composite film by vacuum filtration technique. The Ti3C2Tx/CNTs composite film delivered a large reversible capacity of 489.2 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1. Y Liu et al.247 reported the use of a binder-free Ti3C2/CNTs hybrid composite for an anode material in LIBs. After the 300 cycles, the value of the reversible capacity of the Ti3C2/CNTs hybrid composite was 428 mA h g−1 at 0.5C, which was higher as compared to the pure Ti3C2 (96 mA h g−1). W. Zheng et al.248 reported the fabrication of the CNTs@Ti3C2 hybrid composites structures prepared in situ via a facile microwave irradiation presence under the suitable conditions. The CNTs@Ti3C2 hybrid composite reported the high reversible capacity of 430 mA h g−1 (1 A g−1) and 175 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, as compared to the pure Ti3C2 of 99 mA h g−1 and 45 mA h g−1. L. Li et al. reported249 the preparation of the Ti2C/CNTs composite by facile synthesis. Fig. 14(a) shows the synthesis method for the Ti2C MXene sheet using etching and intercalation technique.

Fig. 14(b and c) exhibits the TEM image of the Ti2CTx layers, which shows the curves and wrinkles at their edges. The cyclic voltametric curves of the Ti2CTx/CNTs composites were analyzed at a constant rate of 0.1 mV s−1 and is shown in Fig. 14(d). In the 1st lithiation cycle, the two irreversible peaks were found nearly at 0.7 V and 2.2 V. In the next subsequent cycles, they were diminished. In the 2nd and 3rd cycle, the CV curves coincide and show good stability. The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves recorded at 100 mA g−1 are shown in Fig. 14(e). In the first cycle, the values of charge and discharge capacities were measured at 209 and 503 mA h g−1, respectively. Fig. 14(f) shows the cyclic performance of the Ti2CTx and Ti2CTx/CNTs composites, and was recorded at 100 mA g−1. The cyclic performance of the Ti2CTx/CNTs composite was higher as compared to Ti2CTx. The specific capacity of the Ti2CTx/CNTs composite was 156 mA h g−1 after the 200 cycles and CE was around 99.21%. Fig. 14(g) shows the cyclic performance of the Ti2CTx and Ti2CTx/CNTs composites at different current rates. The value of the discharging capacity of the Ti2CTx/CNTs composites was found to be 180, 119, 89, 85, and 74 mA h g−1 at 100, 300, 500, 700, and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. C. Ren et al.250 reported the fabrication of porous Ti3C2Tx (p-Ti3C2Tx) and p-Ti3C2Tx/CNTs composites for high-performance Li-ion storage. Fig. 14(h) shows the schematic procedure used for the preparation of porous Ti3C2Tx composites. The CV curve of p-Ti3C2Tx/CNTs composites showed a pseudo-rectangular shape, as shown in Fig. 14(i). Fig. 14(j) exhibits the cyclic stability plots of pure Ti3C2Tx, p-Ti3C2Tx, Ti3C2Tx/CNTs, and p-Ti3C2Tx/CNTs before and after pre-cycling at 0.5C. For the reversible capacity of pure Ti3C2Tx, the p-Ti3C2Tx film was 35 mA h g−1 and 110 mA h g−1, respectively. The addition of CNTs in p-Ti3C2Tx resulted in the first cycle recorded at 790 mA h g−1. After the 1st cycle, the capacity dropped and reached 500 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The CE was close to 100%. Fig. 14(k and l) shows that the p-Ti3C2Tx/CNTs composite exhibits an excellent value of specific capacity even at higher current rates. The value of the capacity was recorded at 650 mA h g−1 (0.1C), and gradually decreases with an increase in the cycling rates. The value of the capacity was recorded at 230 mA h g−1 (10C) and 110 mA h g−1 (60C). For the pre-cycled p-Ti3C2Tx/CNTs composite electrode, the value of the capacity was achieved at 1250 mA h g−1 (0.1C), which dropped to 330 mA h g−1 (10C).


4.4.3 Graphene/MXene hybrid composites for anode materials. 
Graphene is a 2D network structure and exhibits outstanding properties, such as large specific surface area (SSA), high mechanical strength, and superior electrical and thermal conductivities. Graphene has a problem of the restacking due to the van der Waals force of attraction. The combination of graphene and MXene overcome the problem of restacking in both materials and improved the SSA. Various graphene/MXene hybrid materials have been reported. The hybrid of graphene and MXene has attained more attention in the field of electrode material in batteries and supercapacitors.251–254 The graphene and MXene hybrid materials exhibit the maximum charge storage capacity for the batteries. The graphene sheets behave as a spacer between the MXene layers and enhance the electrolyte diffusion. Y. Fang et al. reported255 the fabrication of a 3D alkali anode Li/Ti3C2Tx-rGO hybrid material by infusing molten Li metal into the 3D porous Ti3C2Tx-rGO membranes. The presence of the functional group on the surface of Ti3C2Tx shows the strong bonding between the rGO and Li, and the formation of Ti3C2Tx-rGO membranes. The porous structure of Li/Ti3C2Tx-rGO composites showed the stable cycling performance in 750 cycles at 5.0 mA cm−2. The Li/Ti3C2Tx-rGO electrodes show the low polarization and maintain the 97% capacity after the 100 cycles. Hence, they conclude that the 2D MXene/rGO hybrid materials provide the practical approach for attaining the safe and stable alkali metal anode. M. Q. Zhao et al.256 reported the preparation method for the MXene/graphene heterostructure using a spray-assisted layer-by-layer technique. Fig. 15(a) shows the schematic representation for the preparation of a MXene/graphene film using spray-assisted layer-by-layer process. In the first step, Ti3C2Tx MXene was coated on the substrate using the spray-coated technique. Then, the rGO layer was coated on the Ti3C2Tx MXene by spray technique and the procedure was repeated an alternative manner to produce the heterostructure film electrode, as shown in Fig. 15(a). Fig. 15(b and c) shows the TEM image of Ti3C2Tx MXene and rGO flakes with a lateral size ranging from 3 to 10 μm. The cross-sectional SEM image of M/G-20 is shown in Fig. 15(d). The single layer of the graphene flake was inserted on the MXene flakes and was analyzed using the cross-sectional TEM image of M/G-20, as shown in Fig. 15(e). Du et al. reported the220 MXene/graphene hybrid composites and theoretical calculation of their electrochemical properties. They concluded that the existence of graphene not only avoided the restacking problem of MXene, but it also enhanced the electronic conductivity, stiffness and Li-adsorption strength.

Z. Ma et al.215 reported the fabrication of the 3D porous MXene–rGO hybrid film using electrolyte-assisted self-assembly and vacuum filtration technique. The MXene–rGO hybrid film showed the rapid diffusion and transportation of the electrolyte ions. Fig. 16(a) exhibits the schematic illustration for the preparation of Ti3C2 MXene, rGO film, and Ti3C2 MXene–rGO film. TEM was used to study the structure of the Ti3C2 MXene, rGO film, and Ti3C2 MXene–rGO film, as shown in Fig. 16(b and c). Fig. 16(d) shows that MXene sheets were spread over the graphene sheets, and the MXene sheets were thicker than the graphene. Fig. 16(e) exhibits the TEM-EDS results of the selected area and the atomic contents of Ti, C, N, O, and F are given in the inserted table of Fig. 16(e). Among all the weight ratios, the composition of 1–1 Ti3C2 MXene–rGO film showed the higher values of charge and discharge capacity of 473 and 940 mA h g−1, respectively. Fig. 16(f) shows the charge/discharge curves of the 1–1 Ti3C2 MXene–rGO electrode, which exhibited the slow decay of reversible capacity as the current is increased, and it represents the excellent rate performance. The rate performance of all of the electrodes like pure Ti3C2, pure-rGO, Ti3C2 MXene–rGO (different weight ratio such as 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 4:1, 3:1) are shown in Fig. 16(g). The 1–1 Ti3C2–rGO electrode exhibited higher capacity at all current rates. The 1–1 Ti3C2–rGO electrode recovered a high value of capacity of 336 mA h g−1 at 0.05 mA g−1 and a good rate capability of 30% capacity of retention at 4 A g−1. At the high current density (4 A g−1), the pure rGO and Ti3C2 recorded the inferior rate performance, and the value of the charge capacity was 16.7 and 33 mA h g−1, respectively. This result indicates that at high rates, the electronic conductivity and the ion transmission rate affect the electrochemical performance.

S. Xu et al. reported257 the fabrication of the rGO/Ti2CTr film by thermal treatment. Fig. 16(h) shows the schematic illustration for the preparation of a flexible rGO/Ti2CTr composite film. Fig. 16(i) shows the SEM image after the etching of the Al atom from the Ti2AlC MXene and gives the Ti2CTr layered structure. The SEM image shows the morphology of the wrinkled rGO flakes, as shown in Fig. 16(j). The cross-sectional SEM image of the rGO/Ti2CTr showed that rGO flakes were embedded in the Ti2CTr. The low and high magnification image of rGO/Ti2CTr is shown in Fig. 16(l and m). Fig. 16(n) shows the Ti2CTr particles surrounded by rGO sheets. In the 1st cycle, the value of the charge and discharge capacity of the rGO/Ti2CTr film electrode was recorded as 920 and 1460 mA h g−1, respectively, with the CE of 63%, as shown in Fig. 16(o). After the 5th cycle, the CE reached nearly to 100%. The charge/discharge capacity of the rGO/Ti2CTr film was recorded at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 16(p). The specific capacities of the rGO/Ti2CTr film exhibited good values even at high rates. The value of the discharge capacities at 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1 were 853.5, 700.5, 558.0, 482.5, 400.9, and 325.6 mA h g−1, respectively. Z. Li et al.258 reported the synthesized route for the fabrication of a sandwich-like structure of Ti3C2/TiO2/rGO via the redox reaction and in situ technique. The intercalations of rGO and TiO2 nanoparticles prevented the existence of restacking problem in Ti3C2 MXene. In the 1st cycle, the value of specific capacities of the charge/discharge of Ti3C2/TiO2/rGO was 339 and 562 mA h g−1, respectively, with the CE of 60%.
P. Zhang et al.259 reported the fabrication of tremella-like 3D carbon-coated Ti3C2Tx (T-MXene@C) hybrid material for an anode electrode. The CV curves of T-MXene@C were recorded at the potential of 0.01 to 3 V and a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. During the anodic and cathodic scans of T-MXene@C, the two additional broad peaks were observed at 1.5 V and 1.3 V, which described the extraction and insertion of Li-ions within the Ti3C2Tx sheets. The initial charge capacity of T-MXene@C was recorded at 581 mA h g−1 with the CE of 60%. The initial capacities of f-MXene and h-MXene were recorded at 347 and 199 mA h g−1, respectively. The cyclic performances of the samples were measured at the fixed rate of 0.2C. The discharge capacity of T-MXene@C was recorded at 499 mA h g−1, even after the 200 cycles. On the other hand, the discharging capacities of f-MXene and h-MXene were 295 and 240 mA h g−1, respectively. The T-MXene@C exhibited the excellent capacities of 478, 365, 330, 290, 238, 195, 142, 102, and 101.6 mA h g−1 at different current rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100C, respectively. The T-MXene@C had a high specific capacity of 338 mA h g−1 at the high cyclic rate.
The carbon nanofillers (CNFs, CNTs, and graphene)/MXene hybrids provide advantages over the graphite electrode. MXene-based hybrid materials have played a significant role in the improvement of the electrochemical performance properties of the batteries. The use of carbon nanofillers/MXene hybrid materials as an anode material for LIBs exhibits several advantages. To overcome the restacking and agglomeration problem, the formation of the conducting networks for the fast Li-ions and electrons transportation properties within the whole electrode is suggested, which enhances the stability of the materials, and reduces the large volume changes of the active materials. The hybrid structures of MXene provided a significant structure improvement rate capability and cycling stability.

4.5 Silicon, carbon, and MXene hybrid composites for anode
S. Liu et al. reported260 the development of silicon, CNTs, and MXene-based anode materials for the improvement in the electrochemical performances of LIBs. Fig. 17(a and b) shows the systematic procedure for the syntheses of Si, CNTs, and MXene-based hybrid composites. Firstly, all three materials were ball-milled using a ball-mill machine. After the ball-milling, homogenous MXene–silicon–CNTs (MSC) composites were formed. During ball-milling, the tungsten carbide balls provided the energy to combine the materials and a chemical bond was formed between them, as shown in Fig. 17(b). Fig. 17(c) exhibits the structure of MSC composites observed by TEM. The TEM image revealed the structure of MXene, Si and CNTs, and their physical contact between them. High annular dark field (HAADF) was used to examine the confirmation of the physical integration of the MSC composite, as shown in Fig. 17(d). The energy dispersive X-ray mapping indicates that Si particles were tightly bounded with the MXene and CNTs, as shown in Fig. 17(e–g). The specific capacity of the MSC composite is shown in Fig. 17(h). The value of the discharge capacities of the MSC electrode was 1613, 1514, 1357, 1140, and 841 mA h g−1 at current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 200 mA g−1, respectively. The MSC anode exhibited the excellent electrochemical performance, as shown in Fig. 17(i). Fig. 17(i) shows the electrochemical performance of Si, MXene–Si, CNTs–Si, MXene–Si–CNTs. The MSC anode material delivered the highest reversible capacity of 1260.2 mA h g−1 and specific capacity of 1000 mA h g−1. After the 200 cycles, the capacity retention was approximately 80%. D. Cao et al.261 reported the preparation of flexible free-standing MXene-CNTs/SiNP (silicon nanoparticles) films by simple and scalable self-assembly techniques. The synergetic effect of Si (0D), CNTs (1D), Ti3C2Tx(2D) film exhibited the excellent electrochemical performance of the hybrid anode electrode in LIBs. Fig. 17(j) shows the SEM image of the compact stacking structure of the Ti3C2Tx sheet. The cross-sectional morphology of the Ti3C2Tx/Si and Ti3C2Tx–CNTs/SiNPs hybrid shows the loose morphology and voids between them, as shown in Fig. 17(k and l). Fig. 17(m–o) shows the top view and cross-sectional image of the hybrid film, and showed the porosity in both samples. Fig. 17(n) shows that the SiNPs were agglomerated within the MXene sheet. When the CNTs were present in the Si/MXene hybrid film, the SiNPs were homogeneously distributed and segregated within the MXene/CNTs hybrid film, as shown in Fig. 17(o). Fig. 17(p) shows the CV curves of the Ti3C2Tx–CNTs/SiNPs hybrid at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. The broad peak was observed at 0.59 V in the first cycles, and was absent in the subsequent cycles due to the formation and decomposition of the SEI film. No cathode peak was observed at 0.2 V in the first two cycles due to the crystalline behaviour of Si. After the reaming cycle, the behaviour of Si was changed into amorphous, and two anode peaks appeared close to 0.3 and 0.5 V. The charge/discharge curves of the Ti3C2Tx–CNTs/SiNPs hybrid at different cycles are shown in Fig. 17(q).

The initial discharge capacity of Ti3C2Tx–CNTs/SiNPs was at 2583 mA h g−1 and a reversible charge capacity of 1623.4 mA h g−1 was recorded. The rate performances of Ti3C2Tx–CNTs/SiNPs, Ti3C2Tx-/Si, and Si electrode are shown in Fig. 17(r). The Si electrode shows the rapid decay in capacity. The addition of Si-nanoparticles within the MXene exhibited a higher capacity at 5.3 mA h cm−2 (100 mA g−1). The reversible capacities of Ti3C2Tx–CNTs/SiNPs were 5.2, 4.0, 2.9, 1.7 and 0.9 mA h cm−2 at the current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA h g−1, respectively. The Si and CNTs made a porous network of Ti3C2Tx–CNTs/SiNPs for the enhancement of the energy storage properties. Y. An et al.262 reported the fabrication of the nanoporous Si@carbon anode material for Li storage and its conjugation with MXene. At 1 mA cm−2, the MXene@NPSi@C film showed improved cyclic performance with 98.2% CE over the 800 cycles. On the other hand, the CE of the Cu foil fluctuated after the 160 cycles and dropped to nearly 80% after 180 cycles, as shown in Fig. 17(s). When the current density was 21 mA cm−2, the hybrid electrode materials still maintained the CE at 97.4% over the 800 cycles. The CE of the Cu foil quickly decayed after the 120 cycles, as shown in Fig. 17(t). Y. Zhang et al. reported168 the fabrication of the MXene/Si@SiOx@C anode material using layer-by-layer for LIBs. Fig. 18(a) shows the schematic illustration for the preparation of MXene/Si@SiOx@C using the layer-by-layer structure with the variation of the Si content and designated as MXene/Si@SiOx@C-1 (Si = 64.8, C = 6.2 wt%), MXene/Si@SiOx@C-2 (S = 72.8, C = 6.5 wt%) and MXene/Si@SiOx@C-3 (Si = 78.7 and C = 6.4 wt%). The structure and morphology were examined by SEM and TEM. Fig. 18(b) shows the SEM image of MXene and the lamellar structure. The Si-nanoparticles were anchored on the surface of the MXene, as shown in Fig. 18(c). Fig. 18(d and e) exhibits the sandwiched structure of MXene/Si@SiOx@C, in which the carbon layer was encapsulated on the surface of MXene/Si. The HRTEM image of the MXene/Si@SiOx@C confirmed the carbon-coating on the surface of MXene/Si, as shown in Fig. 18(f). The interplanar distance of Si was recorded at 0.31 nm, and matched with the Si (111) crystallographic axis and good crystallinity behaviour, as shown in Fig. 18(g). The cyclic performance of the MXene/Si@SiOx@C samples is given in Fig. 18(h). The CE of the MXene/Si@SiOx@C-2 sample was approximately 100%. After the 200 cycles, the hybrid material delivered the stable capacity of 1547 mA h g−1, which was recorded to be larger as compared to MXene/Si@SiOx@C-1 (1049 mA h g−1), MXene/Si@SiOx@C-3(1226 mA h g−1) and Si(238 mA h g−1).

Si/C/MXene is one of the most promising anode materials for LIBs due to its superior theoretical capacity and low operation potentials. Si/C/MXene exhibited excellent electrochemical capability, including the rate and cyclic performance of the anode material.
5. Other MXene-based hybrid composites
The addition of nanomaterials with complementary properties is a significant approach for the development of advanced materials for the energy storage applications. The combination of high-capacity transition metal oxides and the excellent electronic conductivity of MXene are promising materials for the rechargeable batteries due to the synergetic effect between them.
5.1 MXene/metal oxide hybrid composites
The metal oxide hybrid composites have been used in numerous electronic applications.263,264 Various research groups have focused on the significant design and development of high energy density electrode materials to fulfill the requirements for the next generation energy conversion and energy storage devices. To achieve these requirements, various new electrode materials have been synthesized, which have improved the energy density without any compromise on the power density and cyclic stability.265 Metal oxides exhibit relatively high value of capacity as essential in electrode materials. Thus, MXene-based metal oxide hybrid composites influenced the voltage, which can cause the oxidation–reduction reactions to occur not only in MXene, but also contribute to the total capacity of the electrode.266 In the Ti3C2/MnOx composites, the redox reaction of the surface of the MXene depends on the positive ions (Mx+). The positive ion moves inward and out of the interlaminations of the MXene layers by either reaction:267 MnOx + M+ + e− → MnOxM(10) Ti3C2 + 2M+ + 2e− → Ti3C2M2(11)
Few researchers have reported on MXene-based metal oxides hybrid composites. The metal oxides either decorate the MXene surface with metal-ions or produce in situ TiO2 on the surface of MXene.156,268 Naguib et al.268 reported the flash oxidation of 2D Ti3C2 in the presence of the air, and TiO2 nanocrystal entangled with the thin sheet of disordered graphite structures. The electrochemical performance of this material was analyzed and the value of the specific capacity of 220 mA h g−1 at C/18 rate was reported. A. Ali et al.269 reported the electrochemical performance of a MXene-based iron-oxide anode material for LIBs. The synergetic effect between the high lithium-storage capacity of Fe2O3 and stable cyclability and high electronic conductivity was provided by MXene. The different wt% of Fe2O3 were mixed into Ti3C2Tx with the help of the facile and scalable dry ball-milling technique. The hybrid composites of Ti3C2Tx/Fe2O3 were prepared by a different technique, such as ball-milling (BM), wet sonication (WS) and hydrothermal (HT) technique. The hydrothermal treatment was also used for the sample preparation of Ti3C2Tx/Fe2O3. The hybrid composites with a weight ratio of 75:25 Ti3C2Tx/Fe2O3 was designated as HT-25. In the wet sonication, the Fe2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized by the hydrothermal route and calcinated. The wet sonication of Ti3C2Tx/Fe2O3 composites with a weight ratio of 75:25 was designated as (WS 25). The calcinated Ti3C2Tx (75 mg) was ball-milled at 3000 rpm in the presence of 25 mg Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the wt. ratio 75:25 (Ti3C2Tx/Fe2O3) and designated as BM 25. Similarly, in the wt. ratio of 50:50, Ti3C2Tx/Fe2O3 (BM50) was fabricated by the ball milling. The discharge capacities at 1C of the different wt% of hybrid MXene composites were recorded. The composites prepared from the ball milling show the higher specific capacity as compared to that of WS 25 and HT 25. In the first cycle, the discharge capacities of BM25, BM 50, HT25 and WS 25 are recorded as 595, 738, 469, 471 mA h g−1, respectively. The consequent discharge capacity decreased in cycle because of the SEI (solid electrolyte interface), as well as the reversible reduction of Ti3C2Tx. It can be concluded that the ball-milling composites offer more available surface of the MXene layers. The rate performance of the BM 25 and BM 50 electrodes was analyzed. At 1/10C, the value of the reversible capacity of the BM 25 and BM 50 electrodes was achieved as 650 and 700 mA h g−1, respectively. On increasing the number of cycles, the value of the capacity was decreased gradually. At the high discharge rate of 10C, both electrodes were able to hold up to 100 mA h g−1. J. Huang et al.126 reported the novel sandwich structure of Na0.23TiO2/Ti3C2Tx composites, which facilitated the carrier transport dynamics and provided protection of the electrode materials, which was favourable for the high performance of rechargeable batteries. The Na0.23TiO2/Ti3C2Tx composites showed excellent cyclic stability and rate capability. P. Wang et al.270 studied the structural and chemical interaction between the crumpled MXene protected SnO2 core–shell system, which significantly enhanced the contribution to the performance of the anode electrode in LIBs. The SnO2@MXene composites show a high specific capacity of 830 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 current density, and exhibited excellent cycling stability of 534 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1.
Zhao et al.264 reported the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene and Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 hybrid electrodes using spray coating, alternating filtration and in situ wet chemistry synthesis. Among these techniques, the spray-coated Ti3C2Tx/NiCo2O4 hybrid film electrode accomplished high reversible capacities of 1330, 650, and 350 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 5, and 10C, respectively, with a stable capacity up to hundreds of cycles. H. Zhang et al.271 used solvothermal technique for the fabrication of the Cu2O particle-hybridized titanium carbide composites. The discharge capacity of the Cu2O/MXene composite was 143 mA h g−1 at a discharge current density of 1000 mA g−1, and the capacity of retention was nearly 100% after the 200 cycles. Li et al.272 reported the hierarchical Ti3C2@TiO2 MXene hybrid composites, which were prepared with the in situ synthesis of nanoscale TiO2 particles homogenously mixed on the layer of the N-doped Ti3C2 surface. As an anode material, the N-doped Ti3C2@TiO2 MXene acts as an oxidant in the presence of nitric acid (HNO3) at room temperature and designated as Ti3C2@TiO2 (HNO3-RT) hybrids, which are highly durable in LIBs. The Ti3C2@TiO2 (HNO3-RT) hybrid shows a high reversible capacity of 302 mA g−1 after 500 cycles and 154 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 after 1500 cycles. The hybrid composites exhibit excellent stability with a long cycle lifetime in LIBs. The self-assembly of TMO nanostructures on the MXene flakes was stable and exhibited fast Li storage. Li et al.273 reported the nickel hydroxide–Ti3C2 MXene composites, which were fabricated using the hydrothermal technique to reduce the problem of the capacity degradation caused by the terminal functional presence on the surface of the Ti3C2MXene. Due to the synergetic effect of the nickel hydroxide–Ti3C2, MXene displayed the capacity of 733 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, which is significantly higher than the d-Ti3C2-122 mA h g−1 (6 times) and 6.2 times larger as compared to Ni(OH)2 of 118 mA h g−1. Kong et al.274 reported the Fe3O4@Ti3C2 hybrid material prepared by in situ technique, showing the specific capacity of 343 mA h g−1 at 1C. The metal oxide–MXene based hybrids composite have solved the problem of restacking. The LIBs using the MXene/metal oxide hybrid composites have been developed as the active electrode composite materials for energy storage, which gives sufficient electrochemical performance. Zhang et al.275 reported the 3D TiO2@nitrogen-doped carbon/Fe7S8 composite derived from polypyrrole-encapsulated MXene as the electrode material in LIBs. This hybrid material shows the excellent reversible capacity of 516 mA h g−1 after the 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, outstanding rate capability of 337 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and robust cycling stability at 282 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 4 A g−1. L. Wan et al.276 reported the fabrication of 2D (Fe2.5Ti0.5)1.04O4/C/MXene using the solvo-hydrothermal, ultrasound hybridizing, and high temperature annealing processes. The 2D (Fe2.5Ti0.5)1.04O4/C/MXene hybrid exhibits the high discharge capacity of 757 mA h g−1 after the 800 cycles at the current density of 3 A g−1. It can be concluded that the metal oxide MXene hybrid material can be an excellent material for the progress of high-performance anode materials for next-generation LIBs.
5.2 Phosphorus/MXene hybrid composites
Various research groups have studied the improvement in the electrochemical performance of the anode materials through the enhancement of the electrode capacity. The transition metal phosphides are excellent anode materials due to their low polarization and high gravimetric capacity. Still, the energy density of the anode electrode was observed to be low due to the use of the heavy TM.277,278 The direct use of phosphorous as an anode electrode in the LIBs is considered to be an alternative material for improving the energy density properties. Phosphorous also exists in an allotropic form, such as black, red and white. Black phosphorus (BP) has a unique and outstanding 2D structure, and shows a significant potential material for next-generation energy storage devices.279 The material has attained significant research attention due to its advantageous electrochemical and structural properties, such as high carrier mobility, high theoretical capacity, and low redox reactions. Due to these outstanding properties, BP is found to be a suitable anode material in LIBs.280 According to the theoretical calculations from the density functional theory, during the intercalation, the Li-ions come in contact with BP at its edges and rapid ions move across the interlayers, which rapidly enhance the nano domains. The Li-ions react with the BPs, and result in the formation of a new anisotropic lattice phase.278,281 Compared to other 2D materials, BP shows several advantages in the field of rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. Meng et al.282 studied the BP quantum dot/Ti3C2 MXene (BPQD/TNS) composites for energy storage applications. Fig. 19(a) shows the schematic representation for the synthesis of BPQD/TNS composites. The BPQD/TNS composites involve the separation of TNSs and BPQDs, followed by an interfacial assembly. TNS MXenes were synthesized using the Ti3AlC2 as the precursor by a facile two-step technique. In the first step, the HCl/LiF solution was used for etching the Al layers from Ti3AlC2 and the solution was sonicated to obtain the Ti3C2 after etching. The BPQDs were obtained by grinding BP bulk coupled with ultrasonic treatment in the presence of 1-methyl-2 pyrrolidinone solution. The BPQDs/TNS composites were formed by chemical interactions with the help of ultrasonication. Fig. 19(b) shows the TEM image of pure TNS. The relative uniform sizes of the mono-dispersed BPQDs were seen in the TEM micrograph, as shown in Fig. 19(c). The size distribution of BPQDs was reported in the range of 1.6 to 6.5 nm (inset of Fig. 19(d)), giving the average size of 4 nm. The low magnification of the TEM image of the BPQD/TM composite is shown in Fig. 19(e). The HRTEM image indicates the clear lattice fringes with the d spacing of 0.342 and 0.154 nm, as shown in Fig. 19(f). The BP quantum dot/Ti3C2 MXene composites exhibit excellent battery performances in the Li-storage with long cyclic stability, and high-rate capability, and other properties. However, the application of the composites was significantly affected due to the cost of the BP. Red phosphorus has significant potential in future applications, as it is user-friendly and a cost-effective material. On the other hand, the white phosphorus is not user-friendly because of its poisonous nature.

T. Zhang et al.283 reported the red phosphorous/few-layered Ti3C2Tx composites prepared by ball-milling technique. Few-layered Ti3C2Tx was synthesized by the exfoliation of Ti3AlC2 with HF acid. Ti3C2Tx nanodots (TNDs) were synthesized by the ball milling of Ti3C2Tx with red phosphorous. The red phosphorous TNDs composite proved to be excellent materials for the rechargeable batteries due to its improved electrochemical performance. The value of the electrical conductivity of P/TNDs composites was 3.3 × 10−4 S cm−1, and is a magnitude higher than that for red phosphorous (RP). The P/TNDs composite also shows excellent cyclic stability. Zhang et al. reported284 that the nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx and phosphorous composites were prepared by spray drying and vapour deposition technique. Fig. 20(a) shows the schematic illustration for the synthesis of N-doped Ti3C2Tx and phosphorous (N-Ti3C2Tx/P) composites using the flexible matrix with the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Fig. 20(b) shows the electrochemical performances of the composites. Fig. 20(c) shows the values of the composite capacities of 782, 659, 588, 518, 472, and 393 mA g−1 at the gradually increased current densities of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. As the current density returns to the value of 200, 100, and 50 mA g−1, the capacity was recovered to 572, 613, and 657 mA h g−1 with CE of 98.7, 98.4, and 98.5%, respectively.

The synthesis of red phosphorous by vapour deposition facilitates the development of another 2D material combined with the high capacity red phosphorous for the energy storage applications. The preparation of red phosphorous and MXene-based hybrid composites have attained widespread position, and is reproducible by various matrix designs and synthesis for low-cost fabrication and improved energy storage capacity.
5.3 Transition metal sulphide/MXene hybrid composites
The 2D layered transition metal sulphide (TMS) materials are excellent for the electrodes in LIBs. The molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tin sulphide (SnS2) show the extra reversible capacity beyond their theoretical value. The TMS/MXene hybridization has also been considered for high performance anode materials in LIBs.285 The MXene layers have improved the adsorption of Li-ions during the intercalation and conversion processes. Chen et al. reported80 on the fabrication of 2D MoS2 on MXene by in situ sulfidation. Fig. 21(a) shows the schematic representation for the synthesis of MoS2 on the MXene hybrid composite materials. The SEM images of MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx-500 and MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx-700 are shown in Fig. 21(b and c), respectively. The TEM image of MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx-500 has observed lattice fringes of 14.0 Å. The layered compound on Mo2TiC2Tx with the interlayer spacing of 6.9 Å was observed to be similar to the MoS2 phase, as shown in Fig. 21(d). Fig. 21(e) shows that more MoS2 layers were observed at the higher temperature of 700 °C, which facilitates the formation of MoS2. Fig. 21(f) shows the initial charge and discharge capacity of MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx-500 as 554 and 646 mA h g−1, which were higher as compared to the pure Mo2TiC2Tx (134 and 269 mA h g−1, respectively). The improvement in the capacity was due to the open structure of MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx, as compared to the restacked Mo2TiC2Tx. The CE of MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx-500 is 86%, which is superior as compared to pure Mo2TiC2Tx. Fig. 21(g) shows the rate performance of pure Mo2TiC2Tx and MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx-500. The MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx-500 electrode delivered the capacities of 523, 483, 408, 315182 and 90 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 mA g−1, respectively. As soon as the current density returned to 50 mA g−1, the value of the capacity returned to 572 mA h g−1. The MoS2/Mo2TiC2Tx-500 hybrid shows the enhancement in the rate performance as compared to MoS2. Zheng et al.286 reported the fabrication of the sandwich-like 3d structure of the MoS2/partially oxidized Ti3C2 by selective etching and hydrothermal treatment. The synergetic effect of the MoS2/partially oxidized Ti3C2 composite gives the maximum value of the discharging capacity of 656 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, which is significantly higher than the theoretical value of Ti3C2. The stable specific capacity of 153 mA h g−1 was recorded at the high current density of 3000 mA h g−1. The result concludes that the intercalation of MoS2 is an effective strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of the Ti3C2 MXene.

Shen et al.287 reported the fabrication of the MoS2-decorated Ti3C2 (MoS2@Ti3C2) MXene composites by a solid-state sintering technique, which enhanced the electrochemical performance of MoS2@Ti3C2, and was used as anode materials in LIBs. After 200 cycles, the value of the reversible discharging capacity was 131.6 mA h g−1 at the current density of 1000 mA g−1, which is significantly higher as compared to pure MoS2 (3.6 mA h g−1) and Ti3C2 (58 mA h g−1). The MoS2@Ti3C2 hybrid composites show excellent cyclic stability. The enhancement in the electrochemical performance of the hybrid nanocomposites was due to the MoS2 nanoparticle decorated on the layer of Ti3C2 MXene, which reduces the charge transfer distance and improves the charge transfer rate during the electrochemical reactions. X. Zhang et al.288 reported the synthesis of the few-layered MoS2 coating on Ti3C2 MXene (Ti3C2/TiO2@f-MoS2) decorated with TiO2 particles using the hydrothermal annealing techniques. The synergetic effect of the Ti3C2/TiO2@f-MoS2 hybrid shows the extraordinary ability with a storage capacity of 403 mA h g−1 after 1200 cycles at 2 A g−1. The synergetic effect of the MXene-based hybrid materials explores the high-performance MXene-based hybrid materials in energy storage applications.
The SnS2-based materials are attractive in the LIBs because of their high energy density, but they are limited their electrical conductivity, sulfur dissolution and large volume effects. Zhang et al.289 reported the fabrication of pillared SnS/Ti3C2Tx for higher lithium ion storage. The pillared SnS/Ti3C2Tx MXene composite showed the improvement in electrochemical performance. During the discharging capacity of 1253.6 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, it was maintained at 866 mA h g−1 after the 300 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Chen et al.290 reported the electrochemical performance of ultrafine SnS2 nanoparticles into MXene. They reported that SnS2–Ti3C2 showed Li-storage capacities of 1076.1 and 403 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The capacity retention of 88.65% was observed even after the 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Li et al.291 reported the electrochemical performance of the SnS2/Sn3S4 material for the anode electrode in LIBs. These hybrid materials were confined as the multilayer stacker, and prevented the tendency of the restacking and improved the properties. The SnS2/Sn3S4 material exhibits good cycling stability (462 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles) and excellent rate performance (2166 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1).
5.4 Layered double hydroxides (LDH)/MXene hybrid composites
In recent years, layered double hydroxides (LDH) have attained significant research attention in the field of energy storage applications due to their easy preparation and cost effectiveness.292–294 The LDH is considered to have significant potential for the electrode material due to its large surface area, abundant active sites, flexible interlayer structure for electron mobility, high redox activity, environmental friendliness, and open potential window for the electrochemical energy devices.295–298 The electrochemical properties of the LDH are limited due to its self-agglomeration and low conductivity.299,300 To resolve these issues, various researchers have focused on the combination of LDH with highly conductive materials.298,301 The general expression of LDH with the formula of  where M2+ and M3+ are the divalent and trivalent metals, respectively and An− represents a charge-balancing ion (Co32−). LDH and LDH-based hybrid materials, such as MgZnFe-LFH,302 NiFe-LDH/rGO,303 NiCo-LDH/MXene,304 and Ni(OH)2/d-Ti3C2,273 show good Li-ion storage ability. Zhang et al.304 reported the nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides/MXene hybrid materials for LIBs. The NiCo-LDH nanosheet decorated on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene shows a high electrolyte diffusion ability and low internal resistance. Fig. 22(a) shows the schematic representation for the fabrication of the flower-like NiCo-LDH material. After the fabrication of NiCo-LDH, the nanomaterial was grown on the surface of the Ti3C2 MXene, as shown in Fig. 22(b). Fig. 22(c) shows the SEM micrograph of pure Ti3C2 MXene, which exhibited a typical layered structure. The large surface area and unique 2D structure of the Ti3C2 MXene facilitate the nucleation and uniform growth on the 3D interconnected NiCo-LDH network on the surface of MXene, as shown in Fig. 22(d and e). The TEM images of the wrinkled NiCo-LDH materials growth on the surface of Ti3C2 are shown in Fig. 22(f). The thickness of wrinkled NiCo-LDH was roughly estimated at <10 nm, as shown in Fig. 22(g). The HRTEM micrograph of the NiCo-LDH crystal indicates the lattice fringes of 0.26 nm corresponding to the plane, as shown in Fig. 22(h).

Fig. 23(a) exhibits the GCD profile of the NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 and NiCo-LDH/GO electrodes at 0.1 A g−1 with the voltage range of 0.01 to 3.0 V. The initial discharge/charge capacity dropped from 1880 to 1109 mA h g−1 and 1827 to 1267 mA h g−1 with initial CE values of 59 and 69% for NiCo-LDH/GO and of NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2, respectively. The NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 shows a higher CE as compared to NiCo-LDH/GO. Fig. 23(b) shows the different current densities, the rate capability of the NiCo-LDH, Ti3C2, NiCo-LDH/GO, and NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 samples. During the intercalation and deintercalation, NiCo-LDH has a large change in the volume due to the rapid degradation of the capacity. On the other hand, NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 shows excellent rate capability. At the lower current density (1 A g−1), NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 and NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 exhibit a similar value of the specific capacity. When the current density is higher than 1 A g−1, the value of the specific capacity of NiCo-LDH/GO was dropped faster as compared to NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2. The NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 shows an excellent reversible capacity of 923 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. At 10 A g−1, the value of NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 still shows a capacity of 370.6 mA h g−1. When the current density returns to 1 A g−1, the value of the specific capacity is maintained at 910 mA h g−1. Fig. 23(c) shows that the pure NiCo-LDH retained only 10% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles, which indicates that Ti3C2 MXene does not have high capacity. The addition of NiCo-LDH into the Ti3C2 results in the constant value of capacity. It concludes that NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2 has higher volume expansion as compared to NiCo-LDH/GO, and maintains the capacity of 562 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 for 800 cycles without degradation. On the other side, the NiCo-LDH/GO exhibits a higher capacity loss of over 37% after the 800 cycles, as shown in Fig. 23(d).

Li et al.273 reported the fabrication of Ni(OH)2/d-Ti3C2 using the hydrothermal technique to address the issue of capacity degradation. Due to the synergetic effect, Ni(OH)2/d-Ti3C2 showed a capacity of 733 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, which is approximately 6 times higher than that for d-Ti3C2 (121 mA h g−1) and 6.2 times higher as Ni(OH)2 (9118 mA h g−1). D. Zhang et al.305 reported on the NiMn-LDH chemical anchored on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene via in situ crystallization technique. The Ti3C2 MXene, NiMn-LDH and NiMn-LDH/MXene (NM/M) composites were fabricated by electrostatic interaction and in situ crystallization.305 NM/M 21 (ratio of masses the NiMn-LDH and MXene is 2:1) was prepared by in situ crystallization of NiMn-LDH and MXene, as shown in Fig. 24.
 Fig. 24  (a) Schematic representation for the fabrication of NM/M21 and NM + M21 materials. (b) Rate performance and (c) cycling performance with CE at 1 A g−1 of the NiMN-LDH, MXene, NM + M21 and NM/M21. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 305 Copyright (2020) @ American Chemical Society.305) 
For comparison, the simple mixing of both materials was prepared with the fixed mass ratio of 2:1 and designated as (NM + M21), as shown in Fig. 24. The GCD curves of the samples were analyzed for the different current densities. At a current density of 0.1 A g−1, the initial capacity of NiMn-LDH exhibits 1586 mA h g−1 with a CE of 79.6% as compared to NM/M21 (1506 mA h g−1), NM + M21 (1385 mA h g−1) and Ti3C2 (248 mA h g−1), as shown in Fig. 24(b). Among all the samples, NM/M21 has a smaller CE of 71.3% for the 1st cycle. NM + M21 shows 74.6% CE due to its largest SSA, SEI layer and irreversible composition of the Li-ion due to the side reaction.306,307 As the value of the current density increases, NM/M 21 exhibits the higher capacities of 1095, 894, 687, 594 and 522 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. Fig. 24(c) shows the excellent stability in the 1st 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1, and it maintained 89% of the cyclic performance after 3000 cycles, which is better than that for MXene (57%), NiMn-LDH (26%) and NM + M21 (42%). They concluded that the hybrid material of the NiMn-LDH nanosheets was anchored with the MXene material via the electrostatic interactions and in situ crystallization. The NM/M 21 sample exhibits excellent specific capacity and cyclic stability of the electrode. The improvement in the electrochemical performance was due to the formation of oxygen bridging between the NiMn-LDH and MXene atoms. The oxygen bridge connection promoted the diffusion of Li-ions. The conductivity of NM/M was significantly improved due to the formation of the conductive network at the interface. LDH/MXene hybrid materials can be designated as excellent materials for next-generation energy storage applications.
In summary, the various fillers-reinforced MXene hybrid exhibits the enhancement in the electrochemical performance of the batteries. Si and Sn-based nanoparticles incorporating the MXene hybrid show the synergetic effect, providing the fast conduction path and facilitating the volume expansion. On the other hand, the carbon filler-reinforced MXene hybrid enhances the value of the power density, capacity and scalability by increasing the electrical conductivity. The first migration of ions is dependent upon the following three main steps: (a) increasing the interlayer spacing between the multilayers flakes,33 (b) overcoming the problem of restacking of delaminated sheets, (c) bridging between the fillers to improve the conducting network and ease of migration of both ion and electrons. The metal oxide, phosphorous, metal sulphide and layered double oxide to form the MXene hybrid composites show the improvement in the cyclic stability, cycle life, and rate, as shown in Fig. 25. The charge/discharge capacity of the metal sulphide MXene hybrid composites has been recorded after the 2/3rd cycle of the typical graphite anode.308,309 Most of the MXene hybrid composites exhibit enhancement in a cycle life time.
 Fig. 25  Summary of the electrochemical performance of the (a) silicon-based, (b) tin-based, (c) carbon nanofillers, (d) metal oxide, phosphorous, metal sulphide and layered double MXene composites in LIBs. 
The MXene-based hybrid composites deliver excellent electrochemical performance as compared to pure MXenes, which can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the composites and design for the advanced materials for next-generation energy devices.
6. Conclusion and future outlook
MXene has shown outstanding potential for the preparation of electrode materials in the LIBs due to its outstanding properties. This review article highlighted the latest research progress on the development of MXene-based hybrid materials in terms of their characteristic properties. MXenes are the family of 2D materials that show extraordinary physiochemical properties, which are used in various applications. This review article has discussed the synthesis, properties and energy storage applications. The synthesis of the MXene had several challenges, such as difficulty in preparation, tendency to oxidize, agglomeration, and difficulty in exfoliation. We have discussed recent innovations and current technologies used for the synthesis of the MXene with the selective etching materials for the removal of Al layers from the bulk MAX phase using the HF acid and sonication of the MAX phase to separate the multilayer of MXene into the few layers. The synthesis techniques for the production of MXene directly influence the properties of MXene. In general, HF etching and modified fluoride-based etching techniques are mostly used for the synthesis of MXene. The synthesis of MXene using the Lewis acid etching route can be used for the preparation of new MXenes, and offers extraordinary opportunities for tailoring the surface chemistry and properties of MXene.
The defects present on the surface or on the edges of the surface of the MXene flakes, which originate from the synthesis of the MXene phase using the harsh chemical etching, act as active sites for the oxidative degradation reaction with oxygen and/or water. Oxidative degradation reduces the inherent properties of MXene. The oxidative decomposition of MXene can be drastically delayed by controlling the pre- and post-synthesis parameters with the quality of the parent phase, the concentration of the etching solvent, processing time and techniques, temperature, and storage environment, such as pH, storage medium, concentration of aqueous dispersion. In addition, the synthesis approaches of the hybrid materials should be more attentive to control structures in terms of the phase composition, morphology and reproducible features. MXene-based hybrid materials are expected to be developed as robust electrode materials for LIBs. The hybridization of MXene with other materials in terms of the coating and spacing can effectively reduce the agglomeration of MXene and improve the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. This material also helps for the fast transportation of Li-ions, and significantly improves the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials.
The nanosized hybrid materials are of significant interest in the field of LIBs due to their mass transport properties. The nanosize particles cover the short transport lengths for Li-ions and electrons, which provides the larger electrolyte–electrode contact area. MXene-based hybrid materials, like MXene–silicon, MXene–tin, MXene-carbon nanofillers, MXene–metal oxide, MXene–phosphorus, MXene–metal sulfide, and MXene-LDH, which are used as electrode materials for LIBs, have been discussed in detail. These hybrid materials not only help to overcome the problem of restacking and aggregation of MXene layers, but also improve the electrochemical performances of the secondary batteries. The hybrid materials used as an interlayer spacer between the MXene flakes provide an additional route for the electron-conduction process. The synergetic effect of the MXene-based hybrid materials has improved the electrochemical stability, electronic conductivity, suitable contact with the electrolyte, and easy migration of charges. MXene-based hybrid composites could open a new perspective towards energy storage applications, due to the synergetic effect to avoid restacking issues and enhance the electronic properties, good contact with the electrolyte, electrochemical stability and easy ion/electron transfer in these materials. This review article presents the recent advancement in the preparation and energy storage application of MXene materials that would provide a new opportunity for the development of future energy applications.
The practical applications of MXene-based materials are still hindered by many challenges. The main challenge is how to use the active exfoliation methods for the production of 2D materials that are as thin as feasible. Still, some issues and challenges that must be overcome include the following:
• The synthesis techniques of the MXene-based materials should be safe, while still providing high quality, low cost and efficient materials.
• The synthesis of the MXene technique should be improved in such a way as to overcome the issues of difficulty in preparation, tendency to oxidize, restacking, and difficulty in exfoliation.
• The interaction between MXene and various nanofillers should be explored for enhancing the flake size, edge protection and defect-free MXene.
• The MXene-based hybrid batteries with slow loss of charge, high energy-to-weight ratios, low self-discharge rate, and high open circuit voltage would be of considerable significance.
• The synthesis of new 2D MXene materials must be explored for future applications.
• The new 2D materials should be easy to fabricate and should exhibit good stability with improved electrochemical performances.
• Oxidation should be prevented to enhance their shelf life in the suspension phase at ambient conditions.
• The tuning of porosity of the MXene should be explored.
Therefore, a lot of work is required in this area for finding solutions that balance various performances, such as power and energy density, lifetime, and specific capacity. There are several scientific challenges faced by the innovative world in the practical applications of electrochemical energy storage that still require the exploration of new advanced materials. MXene's worth as a reliable electrode for electrochemical energy storage devices has been tackling various obstacles, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. The recent advancement in the fabrication and development of MXene and its hybrid electrode materials for the energy storage devices would lead to a useful path for further investigation towards next-generation energy storage applications.
In conclusion, MXene-based hybrid materials have witnessed breakthroughs in various fields and have significant prospects. In recent years, the energy storage and conversion applications of MXene have received significant attention, but the relevant research is still in its infancy. Advanced analysis of MXene is still desirable to investigate the practical and commercial applications. The more critical and exciting progress in this research area is expected to be very soon.
