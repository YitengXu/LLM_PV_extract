    , Accepted 15th September 2016First published on 16th September 2016AbstractThe influence of TiO2 film thickness on the performance of DSSCs with a new series of dyes having ortho-fluorine substituted phenyl spacers and different donor moieties is reported. Optical, electrochemical, molecular orbital and photovoltaic properties were studied by varying the TiO2 thickness (9 and 12 μm) using these dyes. The thickness variation of TiO2 films had a significant effect on the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc) and efficiency. The Jsc and Voc of dye 1b with a TiO2 film thickness of 12 μm (8.91 mA cm−2 and 0.63 V) were larger than those of the 9 μm film thickness device (8.40 mA cm−2 and 0.57 V). This could be due to the variation in the thickness of the TiO2 film. However, at an optimized thickness of the TiO2 film (12 μm), 1b exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (η) of 4.0% (average 3.6%). This highest efficiency value for 1b from 3.3% to 4.0% without using any co-absorbents was solely based on changing the thickness of the TiO2 film. In addition 1b had a planar structure, whereas dyes 2b and 3b had three and two dimensional structures. The optimized geometry calculation of o-fluoro phenyl π-spacer dyes was ascertained by density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP/631G(d,p) basis set. These results reveal that dye 1b has higher efficiency due to the deeper HOMO level and it exhibited better charge transfer from donor to acceptor, compared to the other dyes.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are an attractive alternative to conventional solar cells because of their reasonable solar to electricity conversion efficiency, low cost of materials, low manufacturing cost and simple fabrication on rigid and flexible substrates.1,2 In DSSCs, during light harvesting by the dyes, free charge carriers are generated after the electrons get injected into the conduction band of TiO2. The electron transfer takes place at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.3 In the past decade ruthenium and porphyrin based sensitizers were considered for high performance DSSC applications, due to the high light to electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long term stability, although these dyes have several drawbacks for commercial application due to the low abundance of ruthenium, modest extinction coefficients, tedious purification, challenging synthesis and environmental issues.4–6 For these reasons, huge efforts have been devoted to the development of new and efficient metal-free organic sensitizers that could advance the device performance and allow for potentially low cost production. These DSSCs are gradually attracting attention due to the easy synthesis and excellent flexibility in structure modification, a high molar extinction coefficient, easily tunable functionalities and photochemical as well photophysical properties of dyes, which are comparable to porphyrin and ruthenium sensitizers.7–9 Generally, metal free sensitizers have donor–π linker/spacer–acceptor type of architecture. Up to now a large number of electron donor groups and different π-linkers and acceptors have been used to construct metal free sensitizers.10–12 Herein, we report the effect of fluorine substitution on the phenyl unit at ortho position (used as a π-linker) to cyanoacrylate and its effect on dye structures having carbazole, triphenyl amine and phenothiazine donor moieties that share the same acceptor (cyanoacetic acid).13,14 The decreasing order of the maximum absorption wavelength was 3b > 2b > 1b. This order of absorption is due to the donating ability of the donor moiety in these dyes (Scheme 1). We introduced the linear hexyl chain on to carbazole and phenothiazine moieties to suppress dye aggregation on TiO2 surface. On the contrary, carbazole dye showed the highest lifetime values and better charge transfer from donor to acceptor (due to the planar structure). The cell with the carbazole donor moiety shows the highest open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Jsc) at 12 μm TiO2 film thickness.

Generally, fluorine atoms have electron-withdrawing ability. When the fluorine atom is incorporated into the π-bridge in organic sensitizers, the properties of dye molecules change drastically, such as molecular energy levels, electron mobility, etc., which are governed by charge distribution and charge transfer from D to A. When the fluorine atom is substituted on the π-spacer the LUMO level of the sensitizer is decreased which influences the intra- and inter-molecular interaction via H-bonding. The earlier reports have revealed that an ortho fluorine substituent on the phenyl unit adjacent to the cyanoacrylic acid group enhanced the light absorption property and improved the overall efficiency when compared to the unsubstituted and meta fluorine substituent to cyanoacetic acid. In the phenyl spacer having two fluorine atoms substituted at ortho positions to cyanoacrylate the cell efficiency was drastically decreased since the planarity of the dye backbone was disturbed due to steric hindrance. These results explain that a single fluorine substituent is better than a double substituent at the ortho position in cyanoacrylic acid dyes.15–19
The PCE was impeded by recombination, slow electron percolation and electron trap states on the surface of TiO2, light harvesting and dye aggregation.20,21 Recent studies have shown that increasing the thickness of TiO2 film increases the internal surface area as well as the absorption of dye. In our experiments, three different newly developed dyes were used with different thickness of TiO2 (9 or 12 μm) with the same redox electrolyte and equivalent active area.22,23 The statistical analysis shows that the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor (FF) of all dyes were improved. Dye 1b exhibited the best performance with an overall average PCE of 2.9% at 9 μm TiO2 film thickness and 3.6% at 12 μm TiO2 film thickness. On increasing the thickness of TiO2 film the transmittance decreased, reducing the incident light intensity on the dye absorbed on the top surface of TiO2. This showed lower injection of electrons from the excited state of dye to the conduction band of TiO2 and more recombination resulting in poor production of current. Thus increasing the thickness of TiO2 does not contribute significantly to improvement of the photovoltaic performance (ESI,† Fig. S1). If the thickness of TiO2 is decreased the dye loading capacity will also obviously decrease which significantly influences the injection capacity of the excited state dye to the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in lower photovoltaic performance (ESI,† Table S1).
Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra of all dyes in chloroform solution and absorbed on TiO2 films are depicted in Fig. 1 and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. 2b and 3b dyes exhibited two major distinct broad absorption peaks in the range of 280–550 nm. Similarly, 1b exhibited two minor and one major broad absorption band in the range of 280–500 nm in chloroform solution (Fig. 1(a)). We ascribed shorter wavelength peaks in the range of 300–380 nm to the localized aromatic π–π* electronic transition of the chromophores, while the longer wavelength band located at 380–550 nm was attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to acceptor. The simplest 3b dye exhibited the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) at 441 nm with a molar extinction coefficient ε = 16230 M−1 cm−1 due to charge transfer transitions of the conjugated molecule. Dyes 1b and 2b exhibited similar spectral properties at λmax of 412 (ε = 25002 M−1 cm−1) and 402 nm (ε = 15829 M−1 cm−1), respectively. Comparatively, dye 2b exhibited a broad absorption band in the visible region than 1b in solution as well as dyes absorbed on TiO2 surface. Fig. 1(b) shows the absorption spectra of dyes on TiO2 films, where the maximum absorption peak of 1b, 2b and 3b is located at 536, 557 and 571 nm. The higher molar absorption coefficient of 1b compared to 3b and 2b is due to the better planarity and strong π–π* transition. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out in an argon atmosphere to investigate HOMO–LUMO levels and the band gap of the sensitizers. The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes are shown in Fig. 2, and relevant data are summarized in Table 1. HOMO levels of all dyes are calculated from the onset oxidation potential of dyes according to the formula EHOMO = −(Eox − E1/2(ferrocene)) + 4.8 eV. Except for 3b, the remaining two dyes exhibit a quasi-reversible oxidation peak, i.e. one electron oxidation couple which can be attributed to the oxidation of the triphenyl amine and carbazole. All dyes show an oxidation potential peak (V vs. NHE) in the range of 0.97–1.2 V (5.47–5.70 eV). The HOMO levels of 3b, 2b and 1b are 0.97 V (5.47 eV), 1.13 V (5.63 eV) and 1.2 V (5.70 eV) respectively. The oxidation potential of all dyes versus normal hydrogen electrode (V vs. NHE) is more positive or lower than the redox potential of I−/I3− (0.4 V vs. NHE or −5.1 eV), indicating that oxidized dyes can regenerate effectively, i.e.1b has an effective regeneration ability.

 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms corresponding to the oxidation of organic dyes in 0.1 M TBAF/CH3CN. Colored arrows represent the first oxidation peak of dyes. 
The LUMO levels of dyes were calculated from the onset thin film absorption spectra of dyes [ELUMO = estimated band gap by using onset of UV (film) − EHOMO], which are 2.58, 2.60 and 2.63 eV for 1b, 2b and 3b dyes respectively. These values are higher than the conduction band (CB) level of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE or −4 eV), predicting a sufficient driving force for electron injection from the oxidized dye to the CB of nanocrystalline TiO2 surface. The electronic calculation results are summarized in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of dyes were carried out in chloroform solution. Pulse excitations at 505 nm (Fig. 3) were applied for all the dyes and their corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Dye 1b exhibited a higher lifetime value than 2b and 3b. The order of lifetime of dyes is 1b > 2b > 3b. The reason for the higher lifetime of 1b may be due to the planar structure and more intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor with respect to other dyes.

Theoretical molecular orbital calculations
To understand the optimized structure of dyes and their geometries, electronic structures were estimated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in Gaussian 09 program with the B3LYP/631G(d,p) basis sets. The optimized geometries are shown in Fig. 4. Carbazole, triphenyl amine and phenothiazine donors share the same ortho fluorine substituted phenyl spacer and cyano acrylic acid as the anchoring group in D–π–A architecture. The optimized geometry of 1b clearly confirms that it has a planar structure and that the HOMO levels are located on the carbazole unit and strongly diffused into the π-spacer. 2b and 3b have three dimensional, butterfly (two dimensional) structures, but the HOMO levels are mainly located on the donor moiety and slightly diffused into the fluorine substituted phenyl spacer. The LUMO levels are mainly located on the anchoring group, π-linker and slightly diffused into donor moieties. In all these dyes representative HOMO and LUMO levels are well separated, which is an advantage for charge migration from donor to acceptor in photoexcitation state.

Fabrication of solar cells
TiO2 photoelectrodes were prepared by following a previously reported process.24 In brief, a transparent layer of TiO2 with thickness 9 μm and 12 μm was used as the photoelectrode. A TCO glass substrate with the deposition of the TiO2 blocking (ethanolic titanium tetraisopropoxide) layer was calcined in a tubular furnace at 450 °C for 10 min. Then, on the prepared TiO2 thin film, the paste containing ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol was dispersed and the film was prepared by the doctor blade method. The thickness of the prepared TiO2 film was 9 and 12 μm respectively. The electrode was cooled to 60 °C and soaked in various sensitizer solutions (10−5 M in dichloromethane and ethanol) for 24 h. Then the counter electrode was prepared by the spin coating method using Pt salt (50 mM H2PtCl6 solution in IPA) and the electrode was calcined at 450 °C for 10 min. The DSSC was assembled in a sandwich type configuration and sealed. The electrolyte consisting of 0.5 M LiI, 0.055 M iodine and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in 3-methoxy propeonitrile was added through the predrilled holes in the counter electrodes. The devices were stored in the dark for 24 h prior to photovoltaic measurements.
Photovoltaic characterization of DSSCs

Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of DSSCs with 12 μm thick TiO2 photoanode measured under light and dark conditions while devices with 9 μm thickness photoanode are shown in ESI† (Fig. S3). The results show that the energy conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSSC changes with the thickness. The various photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs with different film thicknesses are depicted in Table 2. From these results, the Jsc, Voc and PCE of DSSCs showed an increase with the increase of the TiO2 film thickness from 9 to 12 μm. This might be due to the higher amount of dye loading in the case of 12 μm compared to the 9 μm film. From these results we assume that 12 μm TiO2 film exhibited good performance compared to 9 μm TiO2 film. However, the Jsc, Voc and average PCE of 1b sensitized devices were 8.91 mA cm−2, 0.632 V and 3.6% (±0.4) respectively, which are higher compared to the other two sensitizers. The higher PCE of 1b devices might be due to the planar structural geometry and location of the HOMO level on the donor moiety which strongly diffused into the π-bridge.

The Jsc and Voc in 12 μm TiO2 film were high compared to 9 μm TiO2 thin film. The result indicates that the recombination rate increases with the increase of photoanode thickness. The long diffusion distance for the photoelectron to transport to the electrode enhances the probability of recombination.25 The optimized thickness of the TiO2 film is 12 μm, which caused a ∼20% increase in PCE compared to 9 μm TiO2 film. For DSSCs, Voc is determined by the difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte. The Fermi level can be shifted by changing the electron density in TiO2. Since a higher electron density is obtained by a longer electron lifetime, the higher Voc of the 1b device could be related with the longer electron lifetime if the conduction band edge potential is the same among the cells. Therefore, the presence of a long alkyl chain in both moieties (1b and 3b) suppresses the dye aggregation on the TiO2 photoanode surface and hence 1b and 3b show higher Voc compared to 2b.
To get further insight into the variation of Voc among the DSSCs based on different thickness and sensitizers we investigated the interfacial charge transfer process within DSSCs using the EIS technique. As shown in Fig. 6(a), for the 12 μm thickness photoanode EIS showed two semicircles in the Nyquist plots., The Nyquist plot of devices with 9 μm thickness photoanode is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The smaller (higher frequency from 103 to 105 Hz) and larger semicircles (lower frequency from 1 to 102 Hz) in the Nyquist plots were attributed to charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface respectively. Small circles were almost similar in all the dyes due to the use of the same counter electrode and electrolyte. In the EIS measurement the curves were fitted using an equivalent circuit model (Fig. 6(b)) and the obtained parameters are shown in Table 3.

The recombination resistance of the 1b device was larger than that of other devices according to the value derived from curve fitting in Z-view software. Electron lifetime (τn) calculated for all the three devices is of the following order: 2b (100 ms) < 3b (106 ms) < 1b (230 ms). This trend is in good agreement with the variation tendency of Voc (2b (0.624 V) < 3b (0.625 V) < 1b (0.632 V)) observed in the J–V curves. 2b has a slightly lower τn than the recombination resistance as compared to 1b and 3b having a long alkyl chain indicating that the presence of an alkyl chain can act as a charge suppressor, resulting in lower recombination resistance.26
The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) method is a powerful technique to study the electron lifetime and electron recombination velocity in DSSCs.27 In order to conduct the OCVD measurement, the simulated solar light was illuminated on the device and a steady-state voltage was obtained. This indicated that an equilibrium between electron injection and electron recombination is attained at the TCO surface. A potentiostat was then used to monitor the decay of Voc, after interrupting the illumination.

Fig. 7 shows the OCVD decay curves of devices with 12 μm thick TiO2 photoanode and with different sensitizers whereas the OCVD decay curves of devices with 9 μm thick TiO2 photoanode are shown in ESI† (Fig. S5(a)). It was observed from the OCVD curve of the 1b device that the decay was much slower than that of 3b and 2b. It was proposed to quantify the extent of electron recombination with the redox electrolyte and has been proven very effective. The Tafel polarization technique used to study the back electron transfer reaction in the DSSC device is shown in Fig. 8 (12 μm thickness). The Tafel plots of devices with 9 μm thickness photoanode are shown in ESI† (Fig. S5(b)) and the corresponding data are shown in Table S2.

This technique is used to analyze the interface charge transfer of the iodine/triiodide redox mediator on the photoanode surface. The kinetics of the anodic reactions occurring at the electrolyte and TiO2 photoanode interface can be represented using the Butler–Volmer equation:j = −j(expαcnF/RT(E − Eeq) − expαanF/RT(E − Eeq))J0 is the exchange current density, Eeq is the equilibrium potential of the iodide/triiodide redox system, E is the applied voltage, and αa and αc are the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients respectively. It is clear from this equation that j = j0 as E = Eeq in the dark. The Tafel measurement data were fitted using CorrView software and j0 was estimated for all the devices shown in Table 3. From the above technique, it was concluded that the DSSC device with 1b sensitizer possesses higher j0 (6.1 × 10−5 cm2) compared to other sensitizer based devices. As this j0 value is inversely proportional to sheet resistance, Rpt (19.9 Ω), this confirmed the smooth electron transport between Pt/electrolyte interfaces. Fig. 9 shows the IPCEs of solar cells sensitized by dyes with 12 μm thickness, whereas IPCEs of devices with 9 μm thickness photoanode are shown in ESI† (Fig. S6). Compared to the DSSCs sensitized by the dyes with 9 μm thickness, the DSSCs sensitized by the dyes with 12 μm thickness have higher PCE because of their higher Jsc and Voc. The device at 12 μm thickness reduces charge recombination, leading to improvement in Jsc. However, the Voc related to the electron density is obtained by longer electron lifetime, as explained by the above analysis (Tafel, EIS and OCVD). The onset wavelength of the IPCE spectra was 700–750 nm for all the three dyes. Dye 1b at 12 μm photoanode thickness exhibited the highest IPCE value of 40–45% in the range of 420–620 nm, showing highly efficient solar cell performance as compared to 2b and 3b.

Conclusion
A series of new DSSC devices have been fabricated containing newly developed organic sensitizers with varying donor moieties such as carbazole, phenothiazine and triphenylamine. The influence of varying the donor moiety in the sensitizers as well as the effect of the TiO2 thickness (9 and 12 μm) resulted in interesting optical and photovoltaic characteristics. The 1b device with 12 μm thickness displayed a reduced charge recombination compared to the other devices reported herein, which led to an improvement in Jsc. As a result of these variations, the solar cell based on 1b showed a superior photovoltaic performance with a Jsc of 8.91 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.632 V, and an FF of 63.9, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 3.6% (±0.4) under standard AM 1.5 irradiation. Overall these results confirm that single ortho fluorine substitution in cyanoacrylic acid dyes is better than double substitution at the ortho position, whereas the planar structures in 1b are better than the three and two dimensional structures for improved PCE and other device parameters without using any additional coabsorbents.
