    , Accepted 4th June 2012First published on 13th June 2012AbstractIn the present report, we have synthesized MoBi2S5 thin films by the Arrested Precipitation Technique (APT). The deposited thin films were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDS), UV-visible spectroscopy etc. Characterization tools were employed for structure, morphology, chemical composition and optical properties. Further, the effect of tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) on the formation and properties of the MoBi2S5 thin films were investigated. XRD patterns confirmed that the crystallite size of the MoBi2S5 thin film is decreased by using TOPO surfactant. EDS analysis results are in good agreement with the proposed chemical composition. SEM images reveal that grain size decreases from 200 to 160 nm in the presence of TOPO surfactant. The UV-visible absorption spectra of MoBi2S5 thin films show strong absorption in the wavelength range 400–1100 nm. The optical band gap was calculated from absorption spectra and lies in the range 1.20–1.35 eV. Finally, these prepared electrodes were tested for their photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance in polyiodide electrolyte and results are promising.
Introduction
The ternary chalcogenide semiconducting materials have received considerable attention in solar energy conversion devices, optoelectronic devices, and thermoelectric devices.1–4 Groups VIB–VIA, VA–VIA or VIB–VA-VIA chalcogenide materials have maximum attainable solar energy conversion efficiency. Mostly investigations on sulphide compounds are still increasing due to their low band gap and high absorption coefficient (104–105 cm−1).5,6 Preparation of these chalcogenide material thin films have been carried out by different methods, such as spray pyrolysis, chemical bath deposition (CBD), electrodeposition, spin-coating, molecular organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), arrested precipitation technique (APT) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD).7–10 Among these, APT is a simple, inexpensive and facile method for large area deposition at low temperature. It is an excellent technique for the elaboration of chalcogenide semiconductors. Arrested precipitation and reverse micelles are strongly affecting on semiconductor lattice and in situ molecular modification of the cluster surface in organic atmosphere.
Recently, tremendous efforts have been focused on the tuning of morphology to control particle morphology and size.11–13 The basic mechanism is based on reaction kinetics of the growth process by the effect of different surfactant crystal facets and allowing a decreased crystal growth rate in different directions. These parameters strongly depend on reaction conditions, such as the concentration of precursor solutions, temperature, deposition time and concentration of surfactant. Recently, the effect of tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) on the growth of colloidal particles in the solution phases has been investigated.14,15 The structure of TOPO (Scheme 1) is responsible for its excellent complexing properties, due to the presence of a phosphine group (PO). It acts as a surface active amphiphilic molecule containing a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. It also contains a lone pair of electrons, which is used for the formation of complexes with metal ions, separation and purification of metals and also applied in the preparation of high quality microcrystals.16,17 Many authors have reported the synthesis of nanocrystals with controllable sizes by applying TOPO surfactant due to its ability to control the size and enhance the stability of particles,18,19 whose structural formula is shown below.
 Scheme 1  The structure of tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO). 
In this article, we have successfully synthesized MoBi2S5 thin films via an APT method for the first time. The appropriate complexing agent tri-ethanolamine [TEA] is added to eliminate spontaneous precipitation thereby resulting in formation of thin films on a glass substrate.20 We have checked the effect of the surfactant TOPO for the controlling of structural, morphological and optical properties. The deposited films were characterized by different characterization techniques. A detailed growth mechanism of the formation of spheres is discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
All chemicals were used (AR grade) without further purification. The ammonium molybdate (Mo7O24 6(NH4) 4H2O), bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), thioacetamide (C2H5NS), triethanolamine (N(CH2–CH2–OH)3), ammonia (NH3), ammonium acetate (CH3COONH4). The ammonium molybdate, bismuth nitrate and thioacetamide acted as the source of Mo4+, Bi3+ and S2− ions, respectively. The triethanolamine (TEA) was used as a complexing agent to obtain Mo-TEA and Bi-TEA complex solutions. Tri-n-octyl phospine oxide (TOPO) was used as a surfactant.
2.2 Synthesis of MoBi2S5 thin film
For the deposition of MoBi2S5 thin film, the concentrations of ammonium molybdate, bismuth nitrate and thioacetamide were measured to get a 1:2:5 stoichiometry proportion. MoBi2S5 thin films were deposited on cleaned glass substrates by an APT system. Mo-TEA, Bi-TEA complex was formed from ammonium molybdate and bismuth nitrate crushed with the complexing agent TEA to capture Mo4+ and Bi3+ ions. TEA has a tendency to control the rate of reaction between metal ions and chalcogen ions and to get a high quality metal chalcogenide thin film. Aqueous 0.05 M bismuth nitrate and 0.05 M ammonium molybdate solutions were used as cationic precursors and 0.1 M of thioacetamide was used as an anionic precursor. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 9.5 by 20% ammonium acetate. The temperature of the bath was maintained at 48 °C. The deposited sample is designated as MMC-1. For the study of TOPO surfactant, the concentration of TOPO was assessed in terms of film quality and finally was optimized as 0.05%. The deposited film is designated as MMC-2. Deposition time was fixed (2 h) for both the films. After deposition, samples were taken out, washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature.
2.3 Characterizations
The synthesized thin films were characterized by their structural, morphological, elemental composition and optical properties. The surface morphology was investigated with the help of JEOL-6360 scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer facility. XRD analysis was carried out using a Brucker AXS Model (D8 Advance) X-ray diffractometer in the 20–80° range with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54 Å). A UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrometer) was used to determine absorption spectra, band gap and type of transition of the as-deposited thin films with and without TOPO in the wavelength range 400–1100 nm. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were recorded using a semiconductor characterization system (SCS-4200 Keithley, Germany) using a two electrode configuration. 0.5 M polyiodide (0.5 M KI and 0.5 M I2 crystal) was used as a redox electrolyte. The MoBi2S5 thin film acts as a working electrode and graphite as a counter electrode. Measurements for the power output characteristics were made at fixed intervals after waiting a sufficient amount of time for the system to reach equilibrium (both in the dark and under illumination).

(3)The MoBi2S5 thin films can be obtained from an aqueous alkaline bath consisting of Mo and Bi salts in complex form and sulphide ions. The deposition process is based on slow release of the Mo4+ and Bi3+ ions in the solution, which then condense on an ion by ion basis on the substrate. The formation of MoBi2S5 occurs when the ionic product of Mo4+, Bi3+ and S2− exceeds the solubility product of MoBi2S5. In the present case the formation of MoBi2S5 thin films involves hydrolysis of thioacetamide, which releases sulphide ions into the bath. In order to obtain high quality films, it is necessary to decrease the reaction rate.21 We suggest decreasing the reaction rate using surfactant at a lower temperature, keeping the other parameters unaltered and the adsorption of surfactant molecules onto the particles surface restricts their unlimited growth (reaction (1) and (2)).
After formation of the MoBi2S5 thin film, TEA remains stable throughout the deposition period. However, acetamide undergoes hydrolysis and forms acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide. (reaction (3)) The formation and dissociation of ammonium acetate is a reversible reaction. In aqueous alkaline medium ammonium acetate acts as a buffer and hence controls the change in pH throughout the deposition time.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD spectra of the MMC-1 and MMC-2 samples. The XRD pattern of MMC-1 shows that no well defined peak was found except a broad peak between 40–60° (2θ), which suggests that the film is amorphous in nature. The presence of a broad XRD peak is an indication of the nanocrystalline nature of the films.22,23 A close examination of the Fig. 1(b) diffractogram reveals the small intensity of reflection peaks, which confirm that nanoparticles become smaller.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the as deposited MoBi2S5 thin film (a) MMC-1, (b) MMC-2. 
However, the XRD patterns (Fig. 2(a) and (b)) of films annealed in an inert atmosphere (473 K for 6 h) show well-resolved peaks, showing improvement in crystallinity. The significant improvement in crystallinity is due to sintering of nanocrystals into effectively larger crystals after annealing. Matching of observed and standard ‘d’ values from JCPDS cards [No. 77-0341 (MoS2), 84-0279 (Bi2S3)] confirmed the formation of mixed phase (MoS2 and Bi2S3) composite thin films.

Fig. 3(a) shows the SEM images of the MMC-1 MoBi2S5 thin film. It shows well-defined grains of above 200 nm size. An inset figure shown at low magnification indicates the grains are equally distributed. Fig. 3(b) shows the SEM image of the MMC-2 MoBi2S5 thin film. It is observed that the grain size decreased from 200 to 160 nm. Such behavior is observed in the presence of TOPO as the longer hydrocarbon chain generates smaller particles due to the slower nucleation and growth rate.24 During deposition, fast nucleation takes place in the absence of surfactant. However, the presence of TOPO nucleation starts slowly because of the strong binding of the TOPO with the nanoparticle surface. The MMC-2 sample is more compact and adherent to the glass substrates.
 Fig. 3  SEM micrographs of MoBi2S5 thin films (a) MMC-1, (b) MMC-2. 
The compositional analyses of the MoBi2S5 films were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis. EDS spectra reveal that there are no stoichiometric changes in the presence of TOPO. However, the peaks become broader due to a decrease in particle size. These results show that both our films have the same composition. The insets of Fig. 4(a) and (b) indicate that the sulphur percentage is slightly less compared to the stoichiometry of MoBi2S5. Due to the more metallic properties of bismuth and antisite defects,25 the EDS graphs show a high percentage of bismuth. Antisite defects mean that excess bismuth enters the lattice by replacing sulphur. Theoretical studies show that antistructural defects are responsible for contributing extra charges to conduction. Mo and S have peak overlap in the EDS because the sulphur K line energy value appears in the 2.30–2.47 keV range and the molybdenum L line appears in the range 2.01–2.86 keV. We have confirmed the presence of Mo and S on the basis of multipeak patterns.26 TOPO has the capability to synthesise high quality nanocrystals.27 The size of the nanocrystal is controlled by adsorbing long-chain surfactant molecules onto the nanocrystal surface, forming micelle structures.
 Fig. 4  EDS spectra of MoBi2S5 thin films (a) MMC-1, (b) MMC-2. 
From the above studied morphological and optostructural properties, we would except that TOPO binds to MoBi2S5 nanoparticles and prevents agglomeration of particles, forming a uniform, spherical and compact MoBi2S5 thin film.
The effect of TOPO on the formation of MoBi2S5 thin films is explained detail in the growth mechanism shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  A schematic representation of the formation of MoBi2S5 thin films (a) precursor, (b) TOPO molecules, (c) adsorption of TOPO onto MoBi2S5 particle, (d) uniform, spherical MoBi2S5 nanoparticles. 
When TOPO is added into the precursor solution and the reaction bath maintained at 48 °C, Mo4+, Bi3+, S2− start to diffuse. Simultaneously, TOPO molecules constrain the precipitation of these metal ions. Hence reaction (2) takes place at a slower rate. The TOPO (head) is a hydrophilic surface that is attached to the MoBi2S5 molecule in a systematic way to form spherical MoBi2S5 molecules, as shown in Scheme 2(c). Such a procedure continues to form well defined 160 nm grains of MoBi2S5 that are deposited onto a glass substrate (Scheme 2(d)).

Fig. 5 shows the optical absorption spectra of MMC-1 and MMC-2 samples. The fundamental absorption, which corresponds to the electron excitation from the valence band to the conduction band, can be used to determine the value of the optical band gap energy. To analyze optical data, the following absorption equation is used28 (4)where, ‘A’ is a constant, ‘Eg’ is the band gap of the material and the exponent ‘n’ depends on the type of transition. The values of ‘n’ for direct allowed, indirect allowed and direct forbidden transition are n = ½, 2, , respectively.
 Fig. 5  Optical absorption in the wavelength range 400–1100 nm by (a) MMC-1, (b) MMC-2. The inset shows a plot of (αhν)2versus hν of MoBi2S5 thin films. 
The band gap of MMC-1 and MMC-2 samples were obtained from a plot of (αhν)2vs. hν, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The nature of the plots suggests a direct allowed transition. The band gap was obtained by extrapolating the straight portion of the graph (αhν)2vs. hν on the energy axis at α = 0. The MoBi2S5 thin film MMC-1 sample exhibit a band gap energy of 1.20 eV and the MMC-2 sample increased it up to 1.35 eV because smaller nanoparticles get deposited on the surface.29 This effect may also be due to a change in the nucleation process and growth kinetics in the presence of a surfactant.30 In semiconductor nanoparticles, the effective band gap increases with decrease in the particle size and the absorption edge is blue shifted due to a quantum size effect. The blue shift in the absorption edge is due to the decrease in crystallite size caused using TOPO. In the present case, the MMC-1 sample shows a 1.20 eV band gap while MMC-2 shows a 1.35 eV band gap. If we compare the grain size of both samples from the SEM images then it is clear that the grain size of MMC-2 (∼160 nm) is smaller than MMC-1 (∼200 nm) sample.

Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the J–V characteristics in the dark (●) and under illumination () of without and with TOPO of MoBi2S5, respectively. Both samples show that in the dark the J–V characteristics are similar to the diode characteristics (Schottky type in the case of MoBi2S5/electrolyte), in which there is a negligible reverse saturation current. When these electrodes are illuminated, photons are absorbed, electron–hole pairs are generated and get separated due to the built-in potential at the interface, resulting in the flow of photocurrent.31 The power conversion efficiency (η) of solar cells was calculated using (5)where FF is the fill factor and is calculated using eqn (6) (6)where Imax is maximum current density, Vmax is maximum voltage, Voc is the open circuit voltage, Isc is the short circuit current density and Pin is the power density of incident light.
 Fig. 6  
J–V curves for (a) MMC-1, (b) MMC-2 samples. 
Under illumination, the J–V curves shift in the IVth quadrant, indicating the generation of electricity, which is typical of solar cell characterization. The pure MoBi2S5 exhibits a power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.048% with short circuit current (Isc) = 206 μA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) = 282 mV and fill factor (FF) = 0.25. The sample deposited with TOPO, MoBi2S5 shows Isc = 473 μA cm−2 and Voc = 232 mV with power conversion efficiency of 0.057%. A summary of the solar cell parameters is presented in Table 1.

From the above observations, it is clear that photoelectrochemical performance could be enhanced by using TOPO due to morphological modification that enhances the active surface area.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully deposited nanocrystalline MoBi2S5 thin films for the first time by using an APT method. Morphological and optostructural properties show that the TOPO surfactant plays a significant role in the growth process. When the TOPO is used in the reaction process the grain size decreases from 200 to 160 nm. The optical band gap energy increases from 1.20 to 1.35 eV due to quantum size effects. The tuning of the surface morphology and optical band gap find interesting applications in solar cells. The PEC data suggest that MoBi2S5 thin films have a 0.057% power conversion efficiency. Process parameters like film thickness, deposition time, bath temperature, use of different surfactants etc. may also affect the solar energy power conversion. These observations are under way in our laboratory.
