    , Accepted 1st December 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have reached their highest efficiency with the state-of-the-art hole-transporting material (HTM) spiro-OMeTAD. However, the relatively low conductivity and high cost of this material significantly limit the commercialization of this promising technology. In this work, a low-cost, asymmetric HTM containing a carbazole core and peripheral triphenylamine moieties, named Cz-3OMeTAD, was designed and synthesized via a facile three-step synthetic procedure and employed successfully in planar CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs. The optical and electrochemical data of the asymmetric HTM Cz-3OMeTAD exhibited appropriate energy levels for efficient interfacial charge transfer with the perovskite. The asymmetric propeller-shaped Cz-3OMeTAD has a relatively high mobility value of 1.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, beneficial for the PSC performance. Moreover, steady-state PL and time-resolved PL measurements indicate successful hole extraction properties of Cz-3OMeTAD from the perovskite at the perovskite/HTM interface. Consequently, the Cz-3OMeTAD-based devices achieved a high efficiency of 16.36% in PSCs under 1 sun conditions, comparable with the efficiency obtained for the reference cell using spiro-OMeTAD. Thus, our result demonstrated the asymmetric carbazole-based material as a new class of HTM for highly efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly become a strong candidate for large-scale solar commercialization and attracted world-wide attention due to their dramatic increase in efficiency. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been improved from 3.8% to a certified 25.2% during the past few years.1–3 As an essential component for a typical conventional PSC, hole-transporting materials (HTMs) play an important role in improving the device performance.4–7 Among them, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) are still essential for n–i–p structured PSCs to achieve high efficiencies.8–11 However, their complicated synthetic routes, high synthesis cost and multi-step purification are some big obstacles for commercial large scale production and practical application in PSCs.4 Therefore, developing new low cost, and more convenient synthesis routes of HTM alternatives for highly efficient PSCs is desirable and imperative. Ideal HTMs need to have stable physical or chemical properties, suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, and high hole mobility. Recently, different kinds of HTM have been developed and integrated in PSCs, including inorganic HTMs, polymeric HTMs and small molecular HTMs. Of these, small-molecule HTMs stand at the forefront in this field over their inorganic and polymeric counterparts because of several advantageous aspects, such as convenient purification, facile band gap tuning, and controllable molecular structures.5 In this respect, different kinds of small molecular HTM have attractive advantages in PSCs due to their facile synthetic steps and good film-forming ability, e.g., carbazole, pyrene, biphenyl, 3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene, spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX), triphenylamine (TPA) and oligothiophene derivatives.4–7,12–33 Specifically, HTMs based on carbazole as core moieties have been diffusely studied by us and others in PSCs due to their temptingly low cost, simple structures, large conjugated system, good photochemical stability and excellent photoelectrical properties.12–30 Nazeeruddin et al. reported a facile synthesis of a simple carbazole-based HTM in PSCs which obtained a high PCE of 16.9%.12 Johansson et al. designed a carbazole-based HTM X25 for PSCs to reach a PCE of 17.45%.13 Recently, a series of carbazole-arylamine HTMs were developed for efficient and stable PSCs, showing a promising efficiency of 19.25%.14 In our previous report, we used a low-cost carbazole-based small-molecule material 9-ethyl-1,3,6,8-tetrabromocarbazole (Cz-OMeTAD) as a HTM for CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs, achieving 17.81% PCE.15 Therefore, in the race for novel HTMs for PSCs, the design and synthesis of novel organic compounds with simplified synthetic routes but excellent hole-transport properties remains highly desired.
In this work, we report the facile synthesis of an asymmetric carbazole-based HTM (Cz-3OMeTAD) with three methoxydiarylamine groups, while the symmetrical carbazole-based HTM (Cz-OMeTAD) reported by us previously has four methoxydiarylamine groups. The molecular structures of the two carbazole-based HTMs are shown in Fig. 1. The asymmetric Cz-3OMeTAD tilts by highly twisted conformations and forms a “three-wing propeller-shaped” molecular structure, exhibiting weak intermolecular interactions, which can induce a good performance of hole transport.34–39 The HTM was obtained in a three-step synthetic sequence starting from commercial sources. The material manifests good solubility in an organic solvent, which is suitable for manufacturing thin film devices through solution processing. Furthermore, Cz-3OMeTAD has appropriate energy levels and relatively high mobility, which are beneficial for the PSC performance. As a result, PSCs with a typical planar structure of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au based on the asymmetric Cz-3OMeTAD achieved the maximum PCE of 16.36% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.06 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.61 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 71%, comparable to those obtained in devices using the symmetrical Cz-OMeTAD and the ubiquitous spiro-OMeTAD in this study.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis route of the asymmetric molecule HTM Cz-3OMeTAD is illustrated in Scheme 1 and the detailed synthetic processes are provided in the ESI.† The product is fully characterized using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectra (MS) and elemental analysis, as shown in Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI.† The synthesis of Cz-3OMeTAD only requires three simple steps from inexpensive commercial precursors and is much more convenient compared to the synthesis of spiro-OMeTAD, which requires five steps. Firstly, a partial bromine substitution reaction was performed to add a diphenylamine group on the carbazole core for the final cross-coupling reaction. Secondly, the purpose of substituting the active hydrogen on N–H with ethyl was to increase the stability of the product and improve the solubility of the material. The synthesis of Cz-3OMeTAD was finished in good yield via a Buchwald–Hartwig C–N cross coupling between the bromine substitute and 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine in the presence of Pd2(dba)3/P(t-Bu)3 as the catalytic system. The combination of simple synthesis and solution process ability for Cz-3OMeTAD is beneficial for use as a low-cost HTM at a large scale. Importantly, we calculated the synthesis cost of Cz-3OMeTAD using the cost model described by Osedach and co-workers.40 As shown in Table S1 and Fig. S4 (ESI†), the synthesis cost of 1 gram tri-substituted Cz-3OMeTAD is estimated to be 21.61 $ g−1, which is slightly lower than that of the tetra-substituted Cz-OMeTAD (21.94 $ g−1) and remarkably lower than that of commercially available state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD (∼600 $ g−1).15,41

In order to investigate the feasibility of the asymmetric Cz-3OMeTAD as a HTM in PSCs, density functional theory calculations on the molecular orbitals as well as the geometry of the molecules were performed, and the results are depicted in Fig. 2. The Cz-3OMeTAD molecule adopts a highly twisted conformation because of strong steric hindrance. The asymmetric propeller-shaped structure with three wings can thus readily form 3D charge-transporting channels and might be able to effectively protect the perovskite layer.34 As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the HOMO of Cz-3OMeTAD is delocalized over half the backbone of the molecule, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is loaded mainly on the carbazole core. Therefore, the overlap of the partial wave function between the HOMO and LUMO orbits is beneficial for the rapid formation of neutral excitons and hole-transfer transitions. The calculated energy levels are −5.10 eV for the HOMO and −2.03 eV for the LUMO, respectively, which indicates that Cz-3OMeTAD is suitable to be used as the HTM of the PSCs.

2.2. Photophysical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the tri-substituted Cz-3OMeTAD, the tetra-substituted Cz-OMeTAD and the commonly used spiro-OMeTAD dissolved in CH2Cl2 solutions are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S5 (ESI†). We can see that all the three molecules show absorption bands mainly in the UV region. The maximum absorption peak of the tri-substituted HTM Cz-3OMeTAD is located at 294 nm while the tetra-substituted Cz-OMeTAD shows a slight red-shift compared to Cz-3OMeTAD, which can be explained by the enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions with more diphenylamine groups in the Cz-OMeTAD molecule. Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, Cz-3OMeTAD has a weaker absorption from 340 to 420 nm, which may be ascribed to the n–π* transitions of the ethyl substituent on carbazole.15 Besides this, Cz-3OMeTAD has little light absorption in the range of 400–700 nm, which would contribute minor parasitic absorption to the perovskite layer in the PSC devices.14 Moreover, the optical band gap (Eg) values are 2.75 eV for Cz-3OMeTAD and 3.02 eV for spiro-OMeTAD, which are estimated from the onset of the UV absorption spectra.

(c) TGA curves of Cz-3OMeTAD with a scan rate of 10 °C. (d) Energy level diagram of the corresponding materials applied in PSCs in this work. 
2.3. Electrochemical and thermal properties
For HTMs used in photovoltaic devices, the energy levels should be matched with the perovskite energy levels in order to keep a high Voc of devices, and appropriate energy levels can facilitate the transmission of photoexcited holes from the light absorber layer to the anode. The HOMO level of Cz-3OMeTAD was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), in which ferrocene/ferrocenium was used as an internal standard reference. Fig. 3b shows the CV curves of Cz-3OMeTAD. The derived HOMO level value of Cz-3OMeTAD (−5.20 eV) is well-aligned with the valence band (VB) edge of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV). This demonstrates that Cz-3OMeTAD is feasible for effective hole extraction from the CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs. The LUMO level of Cz-3OMeTAD is calculated to be −2.45 eV from Eg on the basis of the equation: LUMO = HOMO + Eg, which is higher than the conduction band (CB) edge of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV), confirming that electron injection from the CH3NH3PbI3 to Cz-3OMeTAD is well prohibited and thus suppressing charge recombination. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to measure the thermal stability of the tri-substituted Cz-3OMeTAD. As shown in Fig. 3c, the decomposition temperature (Td) corresponding to a 5% weight loss is about 392.5 °C, which is slightly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD (424 °C).8 And there is no obvious glass transition of Cz-3OMeTAD during 100–600 °C (Fig. S6, ESI†).
2.4. Hole mobility
Hole mobility is very critical for a new HTM, therefore, a hole-only device was fabricated with a structure of ITO/Ag/HTM/Ag. The hole mobility of the Cz-3OMeTAD film was measured using the space-charge limited currents model. By fitting the current density–voltage (J–V) curve (Fig. S7, ESI†), the mobility value was obtained according to the modified Mott–Gurney equation. The doped Cz-3OMeTAD film exhibits a mobility of 1.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is nearly identical to that of the symmetrical Cz-OMeTAD (1.82 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and even better than that of spiro-OMeTAD (1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).
2.5. Photovoltaic performance of PSCs
In order to test the newly synthesized Cz-3OMeTAD as a potential HTM for PSCs, devices were fabricated with a typical planar configuration of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au, with fabrication details described in the experimental section of the ESI.† The new asymmetric carbazole-based molecule Cz-3OMeTAD and the standard spiro-OMeTAD were used as the HTMs and deposited under the same conditions for a fair comparison. The schematic view in Fig. 4a shows the PSC device structure used in this work. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G are shown in Fig. 4b, the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are presented in Fig. 4c, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 1.

The cells with Cz-3OMeTAD exhibited higher Voc and comparable FF values but inferior behavior in terms of Jsc value compared with the standard spiro-OMeTAD cells. As illustrated in Table 1, the Voc value of Cz-3OMeTAD-based PSCs was 1.06 V, which is slightly higher than that obtained with the standard spiro-OMeTAD cell (1.04 V). However, it is observed that the HOMO energy level of Cz-3OMeTAD is higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD which should result in lower Voc. As the Voc depends on (1) the splitting of the Fermi levels for photogenerated charges, (2) the recombination, and (3) the energetics of the devices, the slightly higher voltage in devices fabricated with Cz-3OMeTAD as the HTM might be due to low recombination which suggests that Cz-3OMeTAD has slightly superior charge extraction capability, which was confirmed by PL measurements. The Cz-3OMeTAD-based device displayed a lower Jsc value of 21.61 mA cm−2 in comparison with that of the tetra-substituted Cz-OMeTAD (ca. 22 mA cm−2) or spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 23 mA cm−2).8,15 And the Cz-3OMeTAD cells displayed an FF value of 71%, which is slightly less than that of the reference cells made of spiro-OMeTAD (72%). Overall, devices fabricated with Cz-3OMeTAD exhibited an average PCE of 15.77% and the champion device afforded the PCE of 16.36%, which is slightly lower than that of the PSC with the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions. The unmatched energy level between the perovskite layer and HTM, as the HOMO level of Cz-3OMeTAD is obviously higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD, results in the inferior yield of the hole transfer towards the electrode and interfacial capacitance, thus leading to the low FF, Jsc, and PCE of Cz-3OMeTAD in PSCs.42
Furthermore, the EQE spectra of our solar devices are provided in Fig. 4c, presenting a photon-to-current response covering a broad range from 300 to 780 nm. The EQE spectra display an onset of photocurrent generation at about 780 nm, which is in accordance with the band gap of CH3NH3PbI3. The cells with Cz-3OMeTAD and spiro-OMeTAD display a spectral response spanning the range between 300 and 800 nm. The device using Cz-3OMeTAD exhibits an EQE of 78–87%, which is a little higher than that of the device with spiro-OMeTAD (77–83%). The integrated Jsc values of the devices with Cz-3OMeTAD and spiro-OMeTAD are 20.18 and 21.68 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in close vicinity to those obtained from the experimental J–V measurements (21.61 and 23.13 mA cm−2).
The steady-state PL spectra of perovskites were obtained with or without the asymmetric HTM Cz-3OMeTAD layer on top in order to investigate the charge extraction in the HTM at the perovskite/HTM interface, and the results are presented in Fig. 4d. The PL of the perovskite on a glass substrate at about 760 nm was significantly quenched when Cz-3OMeTAD was coated on the perovskite layer, indicating successful hole extraction properties of Cz-3OMeTAD from the perovskite at the perovskite/HTM interface, as less recombination and emission were observed. To further understand the charge-extraction abilities of HTM films, time-resolved PL decay traces for the perovskite/HTM were obtained and the corresponding fitting curves recorded to investigate the carrier lifetimes of the perovskites (Fig. S8, ESI†). After introducing HTM layers, the decay time of the corresponding perovskite/HTM films was significantly shortened in comparison with that of the bare perovskite film, suggesting that both i–p interfaces featured the most efficient charge transfer. Moreover, the Cz-3OMeTAD system showed a shorter decay time than the spiro-OMeTAD/perovskite film, again indicating more efficient extraction of holes out of the perovskite to prevent charge recombination.43,44
As high quality HTM films are required to obtain reproducible devices, the deposition of Cz-3OMeTAD was optimized. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to determine the uniformity and morphology of the HTM film (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). Comparing films of Cz-3OMeTAD and spiro-OMeTAD shows that the spiro-OMeTAD layer often has inhomogeneities (commonly referred to as asteroids) in the film, while this was significantly less apparent in the case of the Cz-3OMeTAD films (Fig. S10, ESI†). To confirm the repeatability of device performance, batches of 16 cells each using Cz-3OMeTAD and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs were fabricated, and the histograms of the PCEs are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), giving average PCE values of 15.77% and 16.97%, respectively. Half of the devices based on the HTM Cz-3OMeTAD demonstrated PCEs over 15.0%, indicating good reproducibility.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized an asymmetric carbazole-based HTM (Cz-3OMeTAD) with three methoxydiarylamine groups and applied it successfully in planar CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs. The asymmetric HTM Cz-3OMeTAD was obtained through a facile three-step synthetic procedure using inexpensive starting materials, making it cost effective for photovoltaic devices. Additionally, Cz-3OMeTAD exhibits hole mobility as high as 1.42 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is responsible for the high FFs of up to 71% obtained in our PSCs using the asymmetric Cz-3OMeTAD. The Cz-3OMeTAD-based PSCs displayed impressive performance (PCE of 16.36%), which is competitive with the expensive spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs. Our work offers a new molecular design protocol to develop HTMs with an asymmetric propeller-shaped molecular structure for achieving efficient PSCs.
