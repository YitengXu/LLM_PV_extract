    , Accepted 4th March 2020First published on 6th March 2020AbstractRecent breakthroughs in molecular design have allowed for remarkable achievement in the field of non-fullerene acceptor (NFA)-based organic solar cells (OSCs) with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 15%. However, despite such promising advances, the inferior stability of OSCs under operating conditions remains a prominent challenge that must be overcome for their practical realization. Here, versatile ternary photoactive systems with simultaneously enhanced efficiency and photostability are developed by introducing a small amount of fullerene (PC71BM) into a narrow band gap NFA-based bulk heterojunction nanocomposite (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F); this approach leads to an enhanced PCE of 10.55% and a prolonged lifetime, retaining approximately 80% of the initial PCE after 500 h of operation under continuous illumination. Based on the energy levels and surface energies of the component materials, cascade energetic alignment facilitates electron transfer without trapping. The PTB7-Th/PC71BM interface provides an energy barrier to suppress recombination between holes in PTB7-Th and electrons in IEICO-4F. Moreover, a small amount of PC71BM promotes favorable molecular packing and orientation of IEICO-4F, leading to enhanced electron mobility and balanced charge transport. A study using transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that the ternary blend effectively suppresses the evolution of charge recombination.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been considered one of the most promising candidates for future ubiquitous energy sources due to their advantageous features, such as high throughput cost effectiveness, high power-per-weight ratio, and good aesthetic potential.1–7 The emergence of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) opens a new avenue for synthetic diversity compared to conventional fullerene acceptors, which enable us to control the electronic and optical properties of NFAs with a higher degree of freedom, allowing better energy level matching and a broader spectral range of light absorption.8–14 Although the performance of NFA-based OSCs had lagged behind those of its fullerene acceptor counterparts for the past decade, decent molecular design of NFAs led to a substantial improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs of over 15%, reflecting their noteworthy potential for viable applications.15–19 The newly designed NFAs offer various and even strategic combinations with donor materials for achieving high performance by considering their electronic, optical, and morphological properties. In particular, the NFAs with narrow band gaps that exhibit spectral photoresponsivity up to the near-infrared region are feasible and can attain complementary absorption with a rational donor polymer pair, which is beneficial for high photocurrent generation.20–27 In addition, the unique optical properties of selective and tunable absorption stemming from the nature of organic small molecule NFAs provide the possible potential for realizing various applications, including semitransparent OSCs for building-integrated photovoltaic and greenhouse applications.28–30
Despite this promising potential, narrow band gap NFA-based OSCs show relatively low device performance parameters, e.g., open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) values. Due to the low charge carrier mobility, when the large population of charges are generated under illumination, severe charge carrier losses can be incurred within the photoactive layer, reducing the values of Voc and FF. Recently, several research groups reported an approach to overcome low charge carrier mobility in narrow band gap NFA-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films by using solvent additives, which enhances both electron and hole mobility and balances them.23,31 However, most solvent additives (e.g., 1,8-diiodooctane and chloronaphthalene) for high device performance lead to a poor device stability because of their high boiling point or chemical instability under illumination, inducing morphological changes in the BHJ film with time32–34 or chemical interactions with photoactive materials.34–36 Therefore, it is of paramount importance to devise a method for simultaneously alleviating charge recombination as well as improving device stability under operating conditions.
A ternary blend containing an additional component in conventional binary blend bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems is recognized as a useful approach for concurrently improving device efficiency and stability of NFA-based OSCs.24–27,30,37–43 The most plausible strategy for constructing efficient ternary blend OSCs is to introduce a third component with functions such as morphology control,44–47 complementary absorption,48–51 and transport channels.52,53 Approaches for achieving highly efficient ternary blends should consider many critical factors, such as compatibility between materials for desired morphology evolution, cascade energy level alignment for consecutive charge transfer without trapping, and charge carrier mobility balance, which significantly increase the complexity of processing optimization. Although substantial research efforts have been devoted to improving the PCE of ternary OSCs, so far, only a few successful cases have been demonstrated that exhibited enhancement in both device performance and stability.24,30,37
Herein, we demonstrate efficient and photostable near-infrared absorbing OSCs by integrating a fullerene additive into a conventional narrow band gap NFA-based photoactive material system, which affords the simultaneous increase in performance parameters of Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), and FF without using processing additive techniques. Based on the fact that both acceptor materials (NFA and fullerene) are very compatible with the donor polymer utilized in this study, the addition of a fullerene with excellent electron transport properties provides enhanced electron mobility while retaining favorable nanomorphology. The resulting ternary devices exhibit a high PCE of 10.55%, which outperforms the corresponding binary devices with PCEs of 9.18% (PC71BM) and 9.44% (NFA). More importantly, our ternary OSCs with two acceptors provide superior photostability to those of their binary single acceptor counterparts, which is beneficial for commercial utilization. Detailed investigations revealed that such positive impacts of the fullerene additive appear to be attributed to the synergistic effect of improved molecular packing, enhanced light harvesting, and favorable energetics.
Experimental
Materials
IEICO-4F was synthesized according to the methods described in the previous work.20 PTB7-Th (also known as PCE-10) and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material Inc. and Nano-C Inc., respectively. Unless otherwise stated, all the chemicals were commercially available products and used as received.
Fabrication of the OSCs
The OSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm on UV-Ozone treated glass/ITO substrates and subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 40 min under ambient conditions to form a thin and compact ZnO film. The samples were then transferred into a box. The binary (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F) or ternary (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM) blend active layers were deposited from 20 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution at a constant donor:acceptor ratio of 1:1.5 by spin-coating at 1000 rpm without further annealing. The resulting film thicknesses were ≈100 nm. Finally, MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation to complete device fabrication.
Characterization
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 using a solar simulator (Newport Oriel) and a Keithley 236 source measure unit. The EQE data were obtained using a solar cell spectral response/QE/EQE measurement system (PV Measurements, Inc.) with a chopping frequency of 100 Hz. The contact angles of the materials were determined by uisng a contact angle analyzer (Phoenix 300, SEO Co., Ltd.). The UV-visible absorption profiles were extracted using a UV-visible-NIR spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750). The surface topography of the photoactive layers was measured using an atomic force microscope in tapping mode (XE-100, Park systems, Inc.). The STEM images were acquired using a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin microscope operated at 300 kV. The UPS measurements were conducted using a Sigma Probe (Thermo VG Scientific) equipped with a He I (21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp at a base pressure of 1 × 10−9 Torr. The pass energy and step size for high resolution spectra were set to 5 eV and 0.05 eV, respectively. The GIWAXS measurements were performed at the 3C-SAXSl beam line in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) using a monochromatized X-ray radiation source of 10.55 eV (λ = 0.117 nm) and a two-dimensional charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (Mar165 CCD). The samples were mounted on a z-axis goniometer equipped with a vacuum chamber (∼10−3 Torr). For photostability measurements, devices were continuously exposed to standard illumination conditions (100 mW cm−2) as used in the OSC experiment in a nitrogen atmosphere, and J–V characteristics were recorded every 10 min. The polymers and NFAs of PBDB-T, PBDB-T-SF, PDCBT, ITIC, IT-M, and IT-4F used in photostability tests were obtained from 1-Material Inc. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) was carried out using a commercially available transient absorption spectrometer, HELIOS (Ultrafast systems). Samples were excited with a pulse train generated by using an optical parametric amplifier, TOPAS (Light conversion). Both the spectrometer and the parametric amplifier were seeded with 800 nm, <100 femtosecond pulses at 1 kHz generated by using a Solstice Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier (Newport Ltd).
Results and discussion
For promising photoactive materials that ensure the complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor in a broad range of wavelengths, we chose PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F as shown in Fig. 1a, which stand for poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno [3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile), respectively.20 To compensate for their weak absorption in the wavelength range less than 500 nm (Fig. 1b), [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was introduced as a secondary acceptor for the ternary blends. In addition, since PC71BM is more charge-balanced compared to non-fullerene acceptors,54 it is expected that the electron transport properties throughout the photoactive layer can be improved when PC71BM is added. Moreover, it is well-known that PC71BM works well as an acceptor with PTB7-Th.3Fig. 1b shows the optical absorption spectra of the photoactive materials: PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F and PC71BM. There is little overlap in their absorption, which is desired for complementary absorption in a broad range of wavelengths. As shown in Fig. 1b, as the relative amount of PC71BM in the blend increases, the absorption in the wavelength range less than 500 nm gradually increases.

To verify the effect of PC71BM on the device performance, we fabricated OPV devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag without using any additives and controlled the blend ratio of IEICO-4F and PC71BM at a fixed donor:acceptor ratio of 1:1.5 (Table 1 and Fig. S1†). Fig. 1c and d show the schematic structure and energy level diagram of the OPV devices, respectively. The energy levels of the materials are determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-visible absorption measurements (Fig. S2†). For the binary system with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, the OPV devices show a PCE of 9.44% with 0.73 V, 21.30 mA cm−1 and 0.60 for Voc, Jsc and FF, respectively. When the relative amount of PC71BM increases from 10 to 50%, the value of Vocs gradually increases, which can be expected according to other previous studies dealing with ternary blend systems.55 The values of Jsc increase until 20% of PC71BM, while above 30% of PC71BM, they abruptly decrease. The FF value is maximized at 10% and gradually decreases to 0.51, which is much smaller than those of the binary devices. As a result, the ternary device with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM was optimized at a blend ratio of 9:1 (IEICIO-4F:PC71BM, wt/wt), at which it exhibited a higher PCE of 10.55% than those of the binary devices (Fig. 1e and f).

To understand the origin of the device performance dependence on the added amount of PC71BM, we measured the space charge limited current (SCLC) of the BHJ films and estimated the charge carrier mobilities using the Mott–Gurney equation, , where ε0, εr, μ, and L refer to the vacuum permittivity and the relative permittivity of the photoactive material, the charge carrier mobility, and the thickness of the photoactive layer, respectively (Fig. S3 and Table S1†).56–58 The structures of the electron-only and the hole-only devices are ITO/ZnO/photoactive layer/LiF/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/MoO3/Ag, respectively. The electron and hole mobilities (μe and μh) of the binary film were calculated to be 7.13 × 10−5 and 9.65 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, relatively low compared to other blend systems. Interestingly, as the amount of PC71BM increases from 0 to 30%, the value of μe gradually increases to ∼1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and abruptly drops down to ∼4.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 at the 50% PC71BM level in the device. In addition, the value of μh is increased and maximized (μh = 1.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) at 10% PC71BM and gradually decreases and saturates as the amount of PC71BM increases to more than 10%. Based on these results, we found that the electron and hole mobilities are more well-balanced at 10% PC71BM (μh/μe = 1.32) than at any other acceptor blend ratio. The enhancement and the balance of the electron and the hole mobilities indicate that the photogenerated charges are efficiently collected at the electrodes in the OPV devices.
We further performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements to compare the morphology of the ternary blend films (Fig. 2). The PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F film shows a smooth surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.41 nm. When PC71BM is added, the ternary blend films exhibit a similar surface morphology with a slightly lower RMS roughness (from 1.01 to 1.25 nm). We also checked AFM images of the binary and the ternary blend films on PEDOT:PSS, exhibiting similar morphological properties, which is attributed to the similar surface energy of the underlying layer (Fig. S4†). This result implies that the calculated mobility values from the SCLC measurements are less relevant to the morphology difference between electron- and hole-only devices. In the STEM images, there is no significant change in the surface morphology regardless of the added amount of PC71BM, which is consistent with the results obtained from the AFM measurements.

To probe the detailed molecular packing and orientation in the photoactive layers, grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were conducted (Fig. 3a). First, the GIWAXS data of the neat films of PTB7-Th, IEICO-4F and PC71BM were analyzed, as shown in Fig. S5.† The PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F films show a strong π–π stacking along the out-of-plane direction at qz = 1.53 and 1.77 Å−1, respectively, which corresponds to the (010) plane. This molecular packing is strongly desired for efficient charge transport along the vertical direction. For the PC71BM film, a ring-type pattern was observed at q = 1.28 Å−1, indicating a randomly oriented (010) plane (amorphous structure). Fig. 3b–f shows two-dimensional (2D) X-ray diffraction patterns of the binary and ternary blend films with different amounts of PC71BM. As the amount of PC71BM increases, the relative intensity of π–π stacking of IEICO-4F (qz = 1.77 Å−1) along the out-of-plane direction decreases. In particular, at more than 30% PC71BM, its intensity is abruptly reduced, which implies that excess PC71BM hinders molecular packing, especially the π–π stacking of IEICO-4F along the vertical direction. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3g, both the lamella peaks and π–π stacking peaks are gradually shifted to the right side as the amount of PC71BM increases. A similar trend of the lamella peaks along the in-plane direction was observed, as shown in Fig. 3h. These results indicate that the addition of PC71BM decreases the d-spacing. Based on these findings, we concluded that a small amount of PC71BM is good for the formation of the dense photoactive layers without destroying intermolecular packing and BHJ networks.

In addition to the influence of nanoscale molecular ordering on intermolecular charge transport, PC71BM in the ternary blends may tend to form a hierarchical morphology with favorable vertical distribution.41Fig. 4a displays contact angle measurements for ZnO, PTB7-Th, PC71BM, and IEICO-4F films, exhibiting angles of 17°, 105°, 80°, and 95°, respectively, and the corresponding surface energies are calculated based on Berthelot–Young's equation (Fig. 4b).59,60 Although PC71BM can be classified as a hydrophobic material considering the carbon-based chemical structure, its relatively high surface energy provides a thermodynamic driving force for phase segregation in the blend.61,62 Moreover, because the ZnO surface affords a high energy surface, it is highly expected that the PC71BM molecules can spontaneously migrate towards the ZnO surface during film formation, leading to a compositional gradation in the vertical direction (Fig. 4c).63,64 The enrichment of the PC71BM acceptor near the ZnO/BHJ interface enables it to act as a partial electron selective region to effectively suppress the bimolecular recombination by blocking hole leakage and facilitating electron collection, thereby reducing the losses in Voc, Jsc and FF. Note that an uneven distribution can be observed in the binary system as well; PTB7-Th is enriched at the BHJ/air interface due to low surface energy, whereas IEICO-4F is enriched near ZnO with respect to the bulk. PC71BM possesses a closer surface energy value to IEICO-4F rather than PTB7-Th, however, PC71BM molecules are more likely to interact and be located in coarse IEICO-4F domains at the interfaces, which prevents PC71BM isolation in the donor polymer domain and affects the microstructure of IEICO-4F, as revealed in the GIWAXS study.

Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy measurements were employed to investigate the charge separation dynamics in ternary blend systems which depends on blend morphologies and energetic alignment among the materials. Following selective excitation of PTB7-Th at 580 nm, we observe rapid decay dynamics for PTB7-Th singlet exciton at 1350 nm in PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F binary films as compared to neat PTB7-Th, which can be assigned to fast electron transfer from PTB7-Th to IEICO-4F within a very short time (<200 fs) (Fig. S6a and b†). To further determine the charge separation dynamics in ternary blends excited at 580 nm, we compared transient absorption spectra of the ternary blend with those of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F binary blend as shown in Fig. 5a and b. Interestingly, by adding PC71BM in the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend, the transient absorption spectra of the ternary blend at around 940 nm exhibit dramatic reduction, which might be attributed to the different formation of bound polaron pair states between binary and ternary blends (Fig. S7†). In other words, in the ternary blend, the bound polaron pair states at the PTB7-Th/IEICO-4F interface are significantly diminished. In addition, the ternary blend films excited at 780 nm show a negative ground state bleach signal at 940 nm up to 10 ps, which implies that the hole transfer kinetics from IEICO-4F to PTB7-Th in ternary blends is retarded (Fig. S8†). These results support the evidence for the energetic presence of PC71BM between PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F (Fig. S9†).

We also measured laser excitation intensity dependent charge carrier decay dynamics of binary and ternary blend films, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. The ternary blend shows a more significant dependence of the charge carrier decay dynamics on laser excitation intensity, indicating an efficient charge separation with suppressed PTB7-Th/IEICO-4F interfacial recombination in comparison with the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F binary blend (Fig. S10 and S11†). It should be noted, however, that a larger amount of PC71BM is detrimental for current generation due to lack of light absorption despite its long-lived charge carriers. Therefore, blending component materials with the optimized ratio is important for achieving high efficiency in ternary blend OSCs.
Like the performance enhancement that results from favorable morphology formation, it has been demonstrated that incorporation of a functional third component can improve the stability of OSCs.37 To explore the impact of the ternary blend approach on device stability, we performed photo and thermal stability tests by aging the OSC devices under continuous illumination and a thermal stress of 85 °C, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, the reference binary devices with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F and PTB7-Th:PC71BM rapidly degraded, losing more than half of their initial PCE values after less than 50 h of exposure to light. In contrast, the ternary device with PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM exhibited remarkably long-term photostable behavior without burn-in loss, retaining approximately 80% of its original PCE for up to 500 h (Fig. S12 and S13†). The enhanced stability can be ascribed to a more stabilized morphology in the ternary blend with more densification of the film.65,66 In addition, we confirmed that the degradation behavior of a ternary blend can be affected by the blend ratio of the component materials. These results imply that improved photostability mainly originates from the synergistic interaction between component materials rather than the materials property itself. Notably, the control device presents better photostability compared with other widely available high-performing NFA-based devices, emphasizing the significance of the blending effect (Fig. S14†). Since almost no change in their absorption spectra was detected as the photoaging time increased, degradation of the photoactive materials is rarely associated with photoinduced burn-in degradation (Fig. S15†). In the thermal stability test, the ternary OSCs showed high durability under thermal stress at 85 °C, although PTB7-Th:PC71BM OSCs exhibited a rapid reduction in PCE, indicating that a small PC71BM addition does not significantly influence the thermal stability (Fig. 6b and S16†).

To gain a deeper insight into the photoinduced degradation behavior of the binary and ternary blends, we investigated the exciton dynamic processes of the devices before and after aging by measuring the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff), as shown in Fig. 7a.26,38,41,67 The Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, in which JL and JD represent the current density under standard one sun illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 and Va represent the voltage at Jph = 0 and the applied voltage, respectively. Considering the assumption that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the corresponding electrodes at a high Veff of 3 V and then the incident photons absorbed by the photoactive layer are the only limiting factor for saturation current density (Jsat), the maximum charge generation rate (Gmax) can be obtained from the formula Jsat = qLGmax, in which q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the photoactive layer. The fresh devices with binary and ternary blends exhibited similar Gmax values of 1.53 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.66 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively. For the aged devices, however, the binary device yielded a considerable reduction in the Gmax value of 8.57 × 1027 m−3 s−1, while the ternary device showed a comparable Gmax value of 1.54 × 1028 m−3 s−1, reflecting decreased overall exciton generations in the binary devices. The exciton dissociation and charge transport/collection processes were studied by analyzing P(E,T) values, which are defined as Jph/Jsat, under short-circuit and maximum power point conditions, respectively. The calculated values are listed in Table S2.† Under short-circuit conditions, the P(E,T) values (i.e., Jph,sc/Jsat) for the ternary devices are calculated to be 90.6% (fresh) and 91.0% (aged), both of which are higher than those of the binary cases (86.5% and 84.7% for the fresh and aged devices, respectively), indicating more efficient exciton dissociation. Similarly, under maximum power point conditions, the ternary devices exhibit higher P(E,T) (i.e., Jph,mpp/Jsat) values of 73.4% (fresh) and 73.3% (aged) compared with the binary devices showing P(E,T) values of 67.2% (fresh) and 60.6% (aged), which is indicative of the enhanced charge transport/collection and consistent with the FFs of the corresponding devices. As a result, we speculate that the incorporation of PC71BM retards the degradation of charge transport/collection efficiency.
 Fig. 7  (a) Jph–Veff characteristics and dependence of (b) Jsc and (c) Voc on light intensity for fresh and aged devices with binary and ternary blends. 
Further, the charge recombination mechanism was investigated by examining the dependencies of Jsc and Voc on light intensity (Fig. 7b and c).68 After exciton dissociation, free carriers reach the appropriate electrodes; otherwise, they recombine through non-geminate recombination (e.g., bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination). To elucidate the bimolecular recombination process, the relationship between Jsc and light intensity is evaluated, which generally follows the power-law, Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where Plight is light intensity and α is the exponential factor. As Fig. 7b shows, α values are determined to be 0.959 and 0.945 for the binary devices before and after aging. For the ternary devices, the α values are 0.966 and 0.961 for fresh and aged devices. These results indicate that more severe bimolecular recombination occurs in the absence of the PC71BM additive at both fresh and aged stages. The Voc variation as a function of light intensity provides useful information on the degree of trap-assisted recombination considering that all of the photogenerated charge carriers recombine within the bulk under Voc conditions. A slope of kBT/q implies that bimolecular recombination prevails in the bulk while trap-assisted recombination should be involved when the slope is higher than kBT/q. As confirmed by Fig. 7c, the extent of change in the slope of Voc–Plight characteristics between fresh (slope: 1.11 kBT/q) and aged (slope: 1.22 kBT/q) devices with the ternary blend is much weaker than those of the fresh (slope: 1.40 kBT/q) and aged (slope: 1.86 kBT/q) devices with the binary blend, suggesting that the evolution of trap-assisted recombination is restrained in the ternary blend. Consequently, both bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination can be effectively suppressed in the ternary blend devices, which contributes to maintaining high performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed versatile ternary blend OSCs with enhanced efficiency and stability by integrating PC71BM as a guest molecule into the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F host blend. As a result of compositional optimization, synergistic improvements in all photovoltaic parameters and photostability were observed, resulting in a high PCE of 10.55% with 500 h of stable device operation under light exposure. It was found that the use of the PC71BM additive led to a favorable microstructure of NFA domains with improved molecular packing and, together with high electron transport capability, increased overall electron mobility in the bulk to attain balanced charge transport. In addition, a hierarchical morphology with a compositional gradient facilitates electron transfer without trapping due to cascade energy level alignment. Evaluation of the mechanism of the recombination process revealed that both bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination in binary blend devices largely increased upon photodegradation but are effectively suppressed in ternary blend devices, demonstrating that the addition of PC71BM has a significant impact on reducing recombination losses. This work will provide useful insight into design strategies for ternary blends with simultaneously improved performance and device stability, both of which are regarded as important features for the commercialization of OSCs.
