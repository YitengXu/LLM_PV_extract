    , Accepted 23rd March 2015First published on 24th March 2015AbstractThe interest in organometal trihalide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3)-based solid-state hybrid solar cells has increased in recent years due to the high efficiencies achieved, with a record of over 20%, and the simple low temperature preparation method. Further improvements in the photovoltaic performance can be obtained by increasing the light harvesting in the NIR region up to 1000 nm. Recently, successful energy harvesting up to a wavelength of 1060 nm using Sn/Pb cocktail halide based perovskite materials has been achieved. However, the energy conversion efficiency of such solar cells (less than 10%) is much lower than that of CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells, which is due to their lower open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). In order to improve this, we need to have a good understanding of the key factors governing the photovoltaic performance of these solar cells, i.e., the optical absorption, the charge separation and the recombination dynamics. Therefore, for this study, we characterized the optical absorption properties, including the bandgap and the Urbach energy, clarified the photoexcited carrier recombination dynamics in Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite (CH3NH3Sn0.5Pb0.5I3) and the charge separation and recombination dynamics at each interface in TiO2/Sn/Pb perovskite/P3HT solar cells, and lastly investigated the relationships between these and the photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
The interest in organic–inorganic hybrid solid-state solar cells based on organolead halide perovskite has increased over the past three years following the recently reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.1%.1–12 Organolead halide perovskites in the form of ABX3 (A = organic molecule, e.g., CH3NH3 (MA), B = Pb, and X = Cl, Br, and I) can be simply crystallized from solution at low temperature (≤100 °C), which enables them to be utilized as light absorbing materials in various solar cells. The higher PCEs of organolead halide perovskites (especially MAPbI3) originate from their unique properties which are critical for high photovoltaic performance: (1) a direct band gap and a high optical absorption coefficient;13,14 (2) a high dielectric coefficient leading to a lower exciton binding energy (about 20 meV);15 (3) long photoexcited carrier lifetimes (>100 ns) and long diffusion lengths (100–1000 nm even longer);16,17 (4) no deep state defects and a very low Urbach energy (15 meV).18 It is expected that further improvements in photovoltaic performance can be obtained by increasing the light harvesting up to NIR wavelengths of 1000 nm, since MAPbI3 perovskite only absorbs light at wavelengths below 800 nm due to its optical band gap of 1.5 eV. Also, from a practical point of view, lead-free organometal halide perovskites are preferable because of the potential toxicology issue of lead. Replacing Pb with Sn or mixing Pb and Sn in organometal halide perovskites can increase the light harvesting in the NIR region up to 1000 nm (ref. 19 and 20) and reduce the toxicity problem associated with Pb.
Very recently, several groups have studied Sn-based or Pb/Sn cocktail MASnxPb1−xI3 (0 ≦ x ≦ 1) perovskite solar cells.21–24 The groups of Kanatzidis21 and Snaith22 reported CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite solar cells with a PCE of about 6%, in which mesoporous TiO2 was used as a scaffold and spiro-OMeTAD was used as a hole transport material (HTM). However, Sn in its 2+ oxidation state is very sensitive to air, which results in a poor stability of CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite solar cells. Hayase et al. were the first to report MASnxPb1−xI3 (0 ≦ x ≦ 1) cocktail perovskite solar cells, in which TiO2 and P3HT were used as a mesoporous scaffold and a HTM, respectively.23 They demonstrated energy harvesting in the NIR region using a Sn/Pb cocktail halide perovskite covering wavelengths up to 1060 nm and obtained a maximum efficiency of 4.18% for MASn0.5Pb0.5I3. They also found the stability of Sn/Pb cocktail halide perovskite solar cells to be better than that of CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite solar cells. Kanatzidis et al. also reported MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskite solar cells, in which spiro-OMeTAD was used as a HTM and a PCE of about 7% was obtained.24 Zou et al. reported planar-heterojunction hybrid CH3NH3Pb1−aSnaI3−xClx perovskite solar cells, in which PEDOT:PSS and PCBM were used as the HTM and electron transport material (ETM), respectively. A maximum PCE of 9.7% was achieved for a = 0.15 (15% Sn), although the PCE was only 0.04–0.11% for a ≥ 0.5.25 However, the PCE of Sn/Pb cocktail MASnxPb1−xI3 perovskite solar cells is much lower than that of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. To improve the photovoltaic performance of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite solar cells, a thorough understanding of the optical absorption properties, the photoexcited carrier lifetimes, and the charge separation and recombination dynamics at each interface is needed.
In this study, we systematically studied the optical absorption, the photoexcited carrier lifetime, the charge separation and charge recombination at each interface in Sn/Pb cocktail MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite solar cells. The relationship of each of these phenomena to the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells was clarified. In the solar cell devices, P3HT was used as the HTM and mesoporous TiO2 was used as the ETM. We found that the Urbach energy of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite (34 meV) was more than twice that of MAPbI3 perovskite. A fast recombination (lifetime: 4 ps) of 55% of the photoexcited carriers was observed in the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite. In addition, charge recombination in the solar cells became faster (the recombination lifetime decreased from 880 µs to 190 µs) when P3HT was used as the HTM. Our results provide detailed relationships between these essential properties and the photovoltaic performance of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite solar cells and clarify the mechanisms for the poorer PCE, which shed light on how further improvements in the performance of these solar cells can be made.
Experimental
Sample preparations
The Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite samples were fabricated using the following processes and materials.23 PbI2 (purity: 99.999%), SnI2, and regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. F-doped SnO2 coated glass ((FTO glass), Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd) was patterned using Zn and a 6 N HCl aqueous solution. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in ethanol was sprayed onto this patterned glass at 300 °C to produce a compact TiO2 layer. The substrate was dipped in a 40 mM solution of TiCl4 in water for 30 min followed by baking at 500 °C for 20 min. A porous TiO2 layer was created by spin-coating with TiO2 paste (PST-18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd.) in ethanol (TiO2 paste:ethanol = 2:7 weight ratio), followed by heating the substrate at 550 °C for 30 min. For some TA measurements, glasses other than FTO, with a porous Al2O3 layer deposited on them, were used as substrates. The substrates were spin-coated with a mixture of SnI2, PbI2, and CH3NH3I (0.5:0.5:1.0 (mol ratio)) in dimethylformamide (DMF) (40 wt%), followed by baking at 70 °C for 30 min. Then, a solution of P3HT in chlorobenzene (15 mg ml−1) was spin coated on the perovskite layer and the substrate was held at room temperature for 1 h in a N2 atmosphere. For the TA measurements, samples of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite deposited on both Al2O3 and TiO2 with and without P3HT as a HTM were used. Ag and Au electrodes were deposited by vacuum deposition in order to characterize the photovoltaic performance. The photovoltaic performance was evaluated using an AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 irradiance solar simulator (CEP-2000SRR, Bunkoukeiki Inc) with a 0.4 cm × 0.4 cm mask.
Optical absorption measurements
The optical absorption properties of the samples were studied using a gas-microphone photoacoustic (PA) technique.26 A 300 W xenon arc lamp was used as a light source. A monochromatic light beam was obtained by passing light through a monochromator. This beam was modulated with a mechanical chopper and focused onto the surface of a sample placed inside a sealed PA cell with nitrogen gas. PA spectrum measurements were carried out within the wavelength range of 500–1200 nm with a modulation frequency of 33 Hz at room temperature. The PA signal was measured by first passing the microphone output through a preamplifier and then to a lock-in amplifier. The PA spectra were normalized using the PA spectrum from a carbon black sheet.
Transient absorption (TA) measurements
Two kinds of TA setups were used to characterize the charge separation (electron and hole injection) (a fs TA technique: fs-TA)27,28 and the charge recombination dynamics (a ns TA technique: ns-TA)28–31 in the samples. In the fs-TA setup, the laser source was a titanium/sapphire laser (CPA-2010, Clark-MXR Inc.) with a wavelength of 775 nm, a repetition rate of 1 kHz, and a pulse width of 150 fs. The light was separated into two parts. One part was used as a probe pulse. The other part was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) (a TOAPS from Quantronix) to generate light pulses with a wavelength tunable from 290 nm to 3 µm. This was used as the pump light to excite the sample. In this study, the pump light wavelength was 470 nm and the probe beam wavelength was 775 nm. In the ns-TA setup, the pump light source was an OPO (Surelite II – 10FP) output excited by a Nd:YAG nanosecond pulse laser (Panther, Continuum, Electro-Optics Inc.). The pulse width was 5 ns and the repetition rate was 0.5 Hz. We used pulsed light with a wavelength of 470 nm as the pump light to excite the sample. The probe light came from a fiber coupled CW semiconductor laser. According to the reports of Yoshihara et al. and our earlier studies,31,32 a probe wavelength of 658 nm was used to investigate the charge recombination between the electrons in TiO2 and the holes in the perovskite. For all measurements, the pump and probe light were irradiated from the glass side and the TA measurements were carried out in a N2 atmosphere.
Results and discussion
Optical absorption study: bandgap and Urbach energy

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite deposited on TiO2 substrates before and after the deposition of the P3HT layer, respectively. The P3HT film acts as the hole transport layer for carriers excited in the perovskite material. Fig. 2 shows the optical absorption spectrum of a Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite sample on a porous TiO2 substrate measured using the PA technique (in the following, we refer to this as the PA spectrum) at room temperature. From the position of the shoulder in the PA spectrum, the bandgap energy is determined to be 1.21 eV,33 which is almost the same as that given in our earlier report.23 We find that below the shoulder, the absorption coefficient follows an exponential trend. The slope of this exponential tail (known as the Urbach tail) corresponds to the absorption tail states, and is usually quantitatively expressed by the Urbach energy, EU.18,34 Investigation of these exponential tails can afford information on the band structure, the disorder, defects, impurities, and electron–phonon interactions in semiconductor materials. Using the experimental relationship between the optical absorption coefficient (α) in the exponential tail and the photon energy (hν) (eqn (1)), we can calculate the value of EU of the sample34,35 (1)where h is Planck's constant and α0, ν0, and Eu are fitting parameters. The value of Eu of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite was determined to be 34 meV. This is higher than that of Pb perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3), which is reported to be 15 meV.18 We can assume that the value of Eu is a reflection of the disorder and/or defects in the semiconductor crystal.18,34–36 Thus, when the density of defects increases, the width of the exponential tail also increases. Therefore, the higher Eu for Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite suggests that there may be higher defect states in the sample compared to CH3NH3PbI3. This will result in faster recombination of photoexcited carriers in Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite and lower Voc and FF, which we discuss in detail below in conjunction with the TA measurement results.

Dynamics of photoexcited carrier recombination and hole transfer to P3HT
To find the mechanism behind the low PCE, especially the low Voc and FF in Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite solar cells, which has been reported in ref. 23 and is also shown below, we used both the fs-TA and ns-TA techniques to systematically investigate the charge separation and recombination dynamics in these solar cells. TA measurements were conducted on Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite deposited on either Al2O3 or TiO2 films, with and without P3HT. Electrons can be effectively injected from the perovskite into the conduction band of TiO2, but this process is impossible in the case of Al2O3. This is because the conduction band edge of the perovskite is higher than that of TiO2 but much lower than that of Al2O3 as shown in Fig. 3.

For the fs-TA measurements, the pump light wavelength, incident from the glass side, was 470 nm and the probe light wavelength was 775 nm. The TA measurements were carried out under very low pump light intensity (less than 0.5 µJ cm−2) and all the TA decays were confirmed to be independent of the pump light intensity under such conditions, as reported in detail in our previous paper.31 In the case of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite deposited on Al2O3, the lifetimes of the photoexcited charge carriers in the perovskite and the charge separation dynamics at the perovskite/P3HT interface were investigated. Fig. 4 shows the TA response of the sample over a time scale up to 3 ns. A fast and a slow decay can clearly be observed in the TA response. Because there is no electron injection from the perovskite to the Al2O3 owing to the large band gap of Al2O3, the decays can be attributed to the recombination processes of photoexcited charge carriers in the perovskite. We found that the TA signal could be well fitted to the following biexponential function: Y = A1e−t/t1 + A2e−t/t2 + y0(2)where t1 and t2 are time constants, A1 and A2 are the contributions from the corresponding components, and y0 is a constant corresponding to a recombination process with a much longer lifetime than the measurement timescale of 3 ns. The time constants t1 and t2 of the two charge recombination processes were calculated to be 4.2 ± 0.4 ps (A1/(A1 + A2 + y0): 55%) and 650 ± 57 ps (A2/(A1 + A2 + y0): 25%), respectively. y0/(A1 + A2 + y0) is 20%, which indicates that 20% of the photoexcited carriers have a lifetime much longer than 3 ns. These results indicate that the recombination dynamics and lifetimes of photoexcited carriers in Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite are much faster and shorter than those in Pb perovskite (i.e., CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3ClxI3−x), which are much greater than 100 ns for more than 90% of the photoexcited carriers.16,17,31 The faster decay processes can be considered to be due to some nonradiative recombination of electrons and holes through defects or trap states in the Pb/Sn cocktail perovskite. This is consistent with the measured higher Urbach energy in Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite (34 meV), which is more than twice as high as that in Pb perovskite (15 mev), as mentioned earlier.

Fig. 5 shows the normalized TA responses of the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite/Al2O3 samples with P3HT up to 40 ps, in which a significant difference can be observed compared with that without P3HT. This difference is believed to result from hole injection from the perovskite to the P3HT. For the sample with P3HT, it is very interesting to observe that the TA signal shows a very fast decay accompanied by a fast rise within a few ps, then a peak at around 5 ps followed by a decay with a time constant of about 20 ps. We think that the fast rise and fast decay within the first few ps are a result of charge separation at the perovskite/P3HT interface, where the fast rise is due to the generation of P3HT+ due to hole injection from the perovskite to the P3HT layer and the fast decay is due to the decrease of photoexcited carriers in the perovskite. According to other researchers and also our own experimental results,28,37 we know that the TA signal probed with 775 nm originates from optical absorption giving rise to the radical P3HT cation (P3HT+), i.e., holes in P3HT. Thus the initial fast rise in the TA signal shown in Fig. 4(b) reflects the charge separation dynamics, i.e., hole injection into the P3HT layer and the simultaneous generation of P3HT+. The subsequent decrease in the TA signal after 5 ps (after the peak) represents the decrease in the number of holes in the P3HT layer, i.e., the recombination of holes in the P3HT layer with the remaining electrons in the perovskite. The fast rise in the TA signal within 5 ps can be well fitted with the following equation:28 y = A1(1 − e−t/t1)(3)where t1 is the time constant of the rising TA signal and A1 is a constant. The time constant t1 was determined to be 1 ± 0.2 ps, corresponding to the generation time of P3HT+. This result means that charge separation at the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite/P3HT interface occurs within approximately 1 ps. For the TA decay after 5 ps in Fig. 5(b), we find that it can be fitted very well to an exponential function with a decay time of 16 ps. This result indicates that interfacial charge recombination between the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite (on Al2O3 substrate) and P3HT occurs within approximately 16 ps.

(b) Experimental and fitted results of the TA response of the sample with P3HT (black: experimental; pink: fitted using eqn (3) with a time constant of 1 ps; red: fitted with an exponential function with a time constant of 16 ps.). 
Based on the above results, the photoexcited charge carrier dynamics in Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite deposited on the Al2O3 substrate with and without P3HT as a HTM were clarified. These dynamics are illustrated in Fig. 6.

Dynamics of electron transfer to TiO2
Next, we studied the photoexcited electron injection and recombination dynamics of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite deposited on TiO2 substrates. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the normalized TA responses of the sample measured for 15 ps and 200 ps, respectively. For comparison, the TA response of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite on Al2O3 is also shown in Fig. 7(a). As shown in Fig. 7(a), for Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite on TiO2, there is a fast decrease in the TA signal (region I) with a time constant of 1 ps (which can be well fitted to an exponential function). This fast decay originates from electron injection from the perovskite to the TiO2. A simultaneous rise in the TA signal (region II) with a time constant of about 1 ps (which can be well fitted to eqn (3)) can also be clearly observed. This is considered to result from generation of the oxidation state of the Sn/Pb perovskite. Therefore, charge separation at the perovskite/TiO2 interface occurs in 1 ps. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the TA signal is almost unchanged from a few ps to 200 ps, which indicates that no charge recombination occurs at the interface over this timescale. Thus, we measured the charge recombination in Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite deposited on TiO2 with and without P3HT using the ns-TA setup.
 Fig. 7  (a) Normalized TA responses of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 deposited on TiO2 substrates over time scales of 15 ps (a) and 200 ps (b). For comparison, the TA response of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite on Al2O3 is also shown in (a). 

Fig. 8 shows the TA responses over a time scale of 50 ms of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite deposited on TiO2 without (a) and with (b) P3HT as a HTM, which were measured with a pump light wavelength of 470 nm and a probe light wavelength of 658 nm. From previous studies,29–32 it is known that electrons injected into TiO2 from sensitizers, such as dyes, quantum dots and perovskite, can be detected by the TA signal probed at 658 nm over timescales from µs to ms. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the TA response shown in Fig. 8 corresponds to electrons in the TiO2 injected from the perovskite, since we were unable to observe any TA signal for the samples deposited on Al2O3 under the same measurement conditions. So the decay of the TA signal originates from the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 with holes remaining in the Sn/Pb perovskite (Fig. 8(a)) or holes in the P3HT (Fig. 8(b)). We found that the TA response in Fig. 8(a) could be well fitted to an exponential function with a time constant of 880 µs. This is a very remarkable result, which means that recombination at the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite/TiO2 interface is about two to three orders of magnitude slower compared to that occurring at the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface (usually a few µs or less according to our previous studies).31,38,39 As shown in Fig. 8(b), the TA response of the sample with P3HT decays much faster compared to that without P3HT, which can be well fitted to an exponential function with a time constant of 190 µs. This result means that recombination of electrons in the TiO2 is faster when P3HT is used, which originates from recombination at the TiO2/P3HT interface. This recombination is one of the main reasons for the lower Voc and FF of the Sn/Pb cocktail solar cells.23 Pinhole-free Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite needs to be prepared in order to reduce the direct interaction between the TiO2 and P3HT and thus suppress recombination. The photoexcited charge separation and recombination dynamics of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite deposited on TiO2 with P3HT as a HTM were evaluated based on the above results and this is illustrated in Fig. 9.

The red solid lines shown in (a) and (b) represent exponential decay functions fitted to the results with time constants of 880 µs ((a) without P3HT) and 190 µs ((b) with P3HT), respectively.

Optical absorption, charge separation and recombination dynamics and their relationships to the photovoltaic performance
The most important and interesting thing is to understand how the optical absorption, charge separation and recombination dynamics are related to the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum and the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cell. Fig. 10(a) shows a typical IPCE spectrum of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite solar cells. The IPCE depends on the optical absorption efficiency ηAbs, the charge separation efficiency ηCsep, which is the product of the electron injection efficiency ηEinj and the hole injection efficiency ηHinj, and the charge collection efficiency ηCcol as follows: IPCE = ηAbsηCsepηCcol = ηAbsηEinjηHinjηCcol(4)
 Fig. 10  A typical incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum (a) and the current–voltage (I–V) curve (b) of Sn/Pb cocktail MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite solar cells. 
Based on the photoexcited carrier relaxation dynamics of Sn/Pb perovskite on Al2O3 and the charge transfer dynamics at TiO2/perovskite/P3HT interfaces (summarized in Table 1), the charge separation efficiency can be calculated. First, the hole injection efficiency ηHinj is almost 100% because the hole injection time constant of 1 ps is many orders of magnitude lower than the recombination time of 880 µs at the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite/TiO2 interface. We can calculate the electron injection efficiency ηEinj as follows. The electron injection time is as fast as 1 ps, therefore all photoexcited electrons with longer lifetimes (650 ps (25%) and ≫3 ns (20%)) would be injected into the TiO2, and only 25% of the photoexcited electrons with the shorter lifetime of 4 ps (55%) would not be injected into TiO2. Thus, the electron injection efficiency is about 86%. As a result, the charge separation efficiency ηCsep (ηCsep = ηHinjηHinj) is 86%. The loss in ηCsep (14%) originates from the fast recombination component (lifetime: 4 ps) of photoexcited carriers in the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite. This may result from nonradiative recombination due to defects in the sample. So the crystalline quality of the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite needs to be improved in order to achieve 100% charge separation efficiency. The optical absorption is about 95% here, because the perovskite is much more strongly absorbing over a broader range up to 1000 nm, which can enable complete absorption (e.g., at 470 nm) in films as thin as 500 nm.23 As shown in Fig. 10(a), the IPCE value at 470 nm (the excitation wavelength for the TA measurements in this study) is 68%. Thus, the charge collection efficiency ηCcol is estimated to be 83% from eqn (4). The loss in ηCcol mostly originates from charge recombination occurring at the TiO2/P3HT interface. To improve the IPCE and Jsc, the direct contact between the P3HT and the TiO2 should be suppressed by preparing pinhole-free Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite layers on the TiO2 or by inserting a barrier at the interface.

As shown in Fig. 10(b), the Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite solar cells are 22.61 mA cm−2, 0.21 V, 0.37 and 1.77%, respectively. It is clear that the low PCE is mainly because of the low Voc and FF. The Jsc can be improved to as much as 30 mA cm−2 if the charge separation efficiency can be increased to 100% by reducing the fast nonradiative recombination rate with a lifetime of 4 ps and if the charge collection efficiency can be increased to more than 95% through suppression of recombination at the TiO2/P3HT interface. As for Voc, the bandgap-voltage offset EG − qVoc is as high as 1 eV, where EG is the bandgap of 1.21 eV and q is the elementary charge. This bandgap-voltage offset is similar to that of amorphous silicon and is considered to be closely related to the higher Urbach energy. The recombination resistance from the I–V curve was estimated to be 27 Ω cm2, which could also result in lower Voc. The lower recombination resistance is mostly because of the faster recombination at the TiO2/P3HT interface. Therefore, we think that the lower Voc in Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite solar cells originates from (1) the higher Urbach energy and (2) the lower recombination resistance. The lower FF was also because of the reason (2). Therefore, these findings indicate that the photovoltaic performance of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite solar cells can be improved by decreasing the Urbach energy, i.e. decreasing the defects in the perovskite, and by reducing the recombination occurring at the TiO2/P3HT interface through some interface engineering such as passivation or inserting a barrier layer.
Conclusions
In summary, by undertaking a systematic study of the optical absorption, the photoexcited charge carrier lifetimes, and the charge separation and charge recombination dynamics, we have explored the ways through which the photovoltaic performance of Sn/Pb cocktail MASn0.5Pb0.5I3 perovskite solar cells can be improved. The bandgap was found to be 1.21 eV and light harvesting can be extended to wavelengths over 1000 nm. The Urbach energy was determined to be 34 meV, which is more than twice that of MAPbI3 perovskite. Three recombination processes for the photoexcited carriers were found in the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite, of which the lifetimes were 4 ps (55%), 650 ps (25%) and one much longer than 3 ns (20%). The higher Urbach energy and the faster recombination indicate that there are defects in the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite. These results are significantly different from those of MAPbI3 perovskite, where the photocarrier lifetimes are longer than 100 ns and almost no defects are observed. On the other hand, the charge separation and charge recombination dynamics were clarified. We found that both electron injection into the TiO2 and hole transfer to the P3HT layer occurred on timescales of 1 ps. What was surprising was that the charge recombination lifetime at the Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite/TiO2 interface was as much as 880 µs. This is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that occurring at the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface. However, the charge recombination lifetime was shorter (190 µs) when P3HT was used as a HTM. This suggests that the charge can be more effectively collected without the HTM. Based on the above results, we found that the loss in the charge separation efficiency originates from fast photoexcited carrier recombination with a lifetime of 4 ps, and the loss in charge collection was because of charge recombination occurring at the TiO2/P3HT interface, leading to lower IPCE values. In addition, the low Voc and FF were found to result from the high Urbach energy and recombination occurring at the TiO2/P3HT interface. These findings indicate that the photovoltaic performance of Sn/Pb cocktail perovskite solar cells can be improved by reducing the defects in the material and the recombination occurring at the TiO2/HTM interface through some interfacial engineering.
