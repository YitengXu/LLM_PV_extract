    , Accepted 9th January 2019First published on 9th January 2019AbstractWide-bandgap (WBG) polymers exhibit strong absorption bands in the short wavelength region, and they can offer complementary absorption when blended with their low-bandgap (LBG) counterparts in multi-junction, ternary-blend, or non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) thereby further enhancing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells. In this work, two WBG polymers (PSS2 and PSS3) based on ladder-type dithienocyclopentadibenzothiophene (DTCD) are designed and synthesized successfully. PSS2 and PSS3 possess relatively deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of −5.36 and −5.46 eV with optical bandgaps of 2.01 and 1.92 eV, respectively. In combination with a non-fullerene acceptor (EH-IDTBR), PSS2 exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.46% with a short-circuit current (JSC) of 15.70 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 58.3% and a VOC of 1.033 V. The 9.46% PCE is the highest among all copolymers based on ladder-type multi-ring-fused aromatics. With EH-IDTBR, PSS3 showed an inferior PCE of 4.74% with an enlarged VOC of 1.138 V. Furthermore, the best-performing PSS2-based device showed excellent stability with a PCE of 9.03% after storage for 120 days, which is 95% of its original value. Our results indicate that the ladder-type DTCD is a promising building block for designing WBG semiconductors for photovoltaic applications.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), using a p-type organic semiconducting material as the donor and an n-type semiconducting material as the acceptor, have attracted increasing attention in the past few decades due to their salient advantages, such as light-weight nature, good flexibility and potentially low-cost production.1–5 Rapid achievements in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs have been made through synergetic advances in photoactive materials, interfacial materials and device engineering.6–20 Until 2015, most efforts had been devoted to the development of low-bandgap (LBG) polymers to match the short-wavelength absorption spectra of fullerene derivatives. The highest PCE of fullerene-based PSCs has surpassed 10%.21,22 However, with the trade-off between their open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) values, further increasing the PCE of fullerene-based PSCs becomes more and more difficult. Therefore, to boost the PCE of PSCs far beyond 10%, researchers have proposed three main strategies which include multi-junction, non-fullerene and ternary-blend PSCs.23–26 The first strategy is multi-junction solar cells in which the tandem device configuration can broaden the light-harvesting spectrum and increase the VOC value, simultaneously. In multi-junction devices, the BHJ layers of sub-cells usually require materials with complementary absorption, and therefore, a wide-bandgap (WBG) material is used in the bottom cell and a low-bandgap (LBG) material is employed in the top cell. The second strategy is non-fullerene solar cells in which traditional fullerene derivatives are replaced by non-fullerene acceptors. Since most non-fullerene acceptors have strong absorption in the long-wavelength region, donor materials with wide bandgaps are urgently needed in order to realize complementary absorption.25 The third strategy of enhancing the PCE of PSCs is to use ternary blends in BHJ layers, where both WBG and LBG materials are of great importance.26 To sum up, in order to further increase the PCE of PSCs, high-performance WBG semiconducting materials are in great need.
The donor–acceptor (D–A) architecture has been the dominant molecular design of WBG conjugated copolymers where alternating electron donor units and electron acceptor units are used. In D–A copolymers, the energy levels and bandgaps can be tuned through judicious selection of different donor and acceptor building blocks. It is well-known that most of the reported high-performance WBG polymers used benzodithiophene (BDT) as the electron donating unit.6,18,27–29 For example, Li and co-workers synthesized a series of BDT-based D–A polymers which achieved the best PCE of 11.41% with a high VOC of 0.94 V.30–32 Hou et al. reported a benchmark copolymer (PBDB-T) which was synthesized by using the BDT donor unit and the benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) acceptor unit. The PCE for non-fullerene PSCs based on PBDB-T exceeds 11.21%.14,33 Compared to the tremendous efforts devoted to BDT-based copolymers, much less attention has been paid to the research of copolymers based on other electron-donating units.
Ladder-type heteroheptacene building blocks are promising donor units for efficient semiconducting polymers because the large planar multi-ring-fused aromatics can extend the effective π-conjugation length and promote π-electron delocalization which is closely related to the energy levels of copolymers.34 Meanwhile, rigidified coplanar structures can effectively restrain the out-of-order rotation around inter-annular single bonds to reinforce the intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state and in turn facilitate the charge transportation in the thin-film state. Furthermore, such ladder-type heteroheptacene-cored materials feature excellent thermal and chemical stability, which is favorable for efficient and stable PSCs.34,35 In 2010, Zheng et al. first developed ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene-based WBG polymers for PSCs with a VOC as high as 1.06 V.36 Later on, in an attempt to improve the charge transportation of ladder-type fused-ring-based copolymers, we replaced the central sp3 carbon in the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene with nitrogen, leading to a carbazole-cored heteroheptacene (DIC in Scheme 1) which was used to build WBG copolymers (2.01 eV) with a best PCE of 7.34%.37,38 By replacing the end phenyl groups in DIC with thienyl groups, we further developed a more electron-rich building block39 (HHA in Scheme 1) which was used to synthesize copolymers with reduced bandgaps.40 Then, when the nitrogen atom in HHA is replaced with a sulfur atom, a new ladder-type heteroheptacene, namely dithienocyclopentadibenzothiophene (DTCD in Scheme 1), was obtained. WBG D–A copolymers based on DTCD only exhibited moderate PCEs of around 5.2% when selecting PC71BM as the acceptor.41,42 Besides the efforts from our group, extensive efforts from many other groups have also been made on ladder-type aromatic-based copolymers in the past 8 years.5,34 Nonetheless, the highest PCE for PSCs using ladder-type aromatic-based copolymers as the donor material is no more than 8.14%, to the best of our knowledge.5,34,43–47
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of tetra-p-phenylene, DIC, HHA and DTCD building blocks. 
In this work, we designed and synthesized two WBG copolymers (PSS2 and PSS3, in Scheme 2) using ladder-type DTCD as the electron-donating unit and difluorobenzotriazole (FBZ) or BDD as the electron-deficient unit, respectively. The FBZ or BDD with two thiophene bridges would help to get a planar geometry which is in favor of closer molecular packing and efficient charge transport. When blended with a medium bandgap non-fullerene acceptor (EH-IDTBR), both copolymers show effective absorption in the wavelength range of 300–750 nm. When the PSS2:EH-IDTBR active layer was quenched with methanol at 120 °C, the resulting device showed an increased PCE of 9.46% with a high VOC of 1.033 V, a JSC of 15.70 mA cm−2, and a FF of 58.3%. The PCE of 9.46% is the highest among all the ladder-type aromatic-based copolymers.5,34,43–47 Compared to PSS2, PSS3 showed an inferior PCE of 4.74% but an increased VOC of 1.138 V. Notably, after 120 days, the best-performing PSS2-based device exhibited an outstanding stability with a PCE of 9.03% which is 95% of its original value.

2. Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the two copolymers are depicted in Scheme 2, and the detailed procedures are provided in the Experimental section. Distannyl M1 was prepared from dibenzothiophene according to reported procedures.41,42 The target copolymers were synthesized by the Stille coupling polycondensation between distannyl M1 and a difluorobenzotriazole derivative (M2) or benzodithiophene-4,8-dione substituent (M3), using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst and toluene as the solvent. Both copolymers were purified with methanol, acetone, hexanes and dichloromethane by Soxhlet extraction to remove low molecular weight oligomers and other impurities. The copolymers can be dissolved easily in organic solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), toluene, chloroform, and dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The molecular weights of the copolymers were determined using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene eluent at an operating temperature of 150 °C. The relevant data are outlined in Table 1. Both copolymers show high decomposition temperatures over 430 °C (Fig. S1†).

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1 presents the UV-visible absorption spectra of PSS2 and PSS3 in solution or thin-film states, and the detailed results are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, both in dilute CB solution and in neat film states, the two copolymers show strong absorption bands around 450–650 nm, which are mainly attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units. In solution, the absorption peak (λmax) wavelength of PSS3 is longer than that of PSS2, indicating the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of BDD in comparison with FBZ. It should be noted that in both solution and film states, PSS2 exhibits a comparable strong and broad absorption in the range of 300–650 nm, without a common bathochromic shift of the maximum absorption peak. As shown in Fig. S2,† the temperature-dependent absorption spectra were obtained from a low concentration CB solution (1 × 10−5 M) of PPS2 at different temperatures. When the solution temperature increases progressively to 90 °C, the shoulder peak at 573 nm of PSS2 is gradually reduced suggesting a moderate temperature-dependent aggregation behavior of PSS2. This could be mainly ascribed to the relatively strong intermolecular interactions (F–S and F–H) induced by the fluorination effect on the FBZ acceptor moiety of the backbone. The absorption band of PSS3 slightly bathochromically shifts in going from the solution phase to the thin-film phase although its λmax hypsochromically shifts from 571 to 564 nm (Fig. 1). A similar phenomenon has also been reported by other groups48 and the reason is mainly attributed to the reduced intermolecular π–π interactions in the solid state resulting from the strong steric hindrance between the pendent phenyl rings on the DTCD and the two alkyl chains attached on the BDD unit. Furthermore, in neat film, both copolymers exhibit a strong absorption band from 450 to 650 nm which basically matches the absorption band of EH-IDTBR. The absorption edges (λedges) of the polymers in film are 616 and 645 nm for PSS2 and PSS3, corresponding to optical bandgaps (Eoptgs) of 2.01 and 1.92 eV, respectively. They can be potentially used as short-wavelength absorbing materials when combined with LBG acceptor materials to construct high-performance PSCs.

As is known, the matching of energy levels between donor and acceptor materials plays an important role in achieving high-performance PSCs.49 Thus, the energy levels of the copolymers in thin film were determined using cyclic voltammograms (CV) with ferrocene as a reference. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, the onset oxidation/reduction potentials (Eox/Ered) of PSS2 and PSS3 are 0.54/−1.28 V and 0.64/−1.17 V, respectively. Thus, the bandgaps deduced from the CV curves are 1.82 and 1.81 eV for PSS2 and PSS3, respectively. Meanwhile, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) for PSS2 and PSS3 were calculated to be −5.36/−3.54 eV and −5.46/−3.65 eV, respectively, according to the following equation: EHOMO/ELUMO = −(φox/φred + 4.82) eV. The HOMO energy level of PSS3 is deeper than that of PSS2, which is in favor of a higher VOC. For the acceptor (EH-IDTBR), its HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.58 and −3.90 eV, respectively.21 The HOMO energy level difference between PSS2 (or PSS3) and EH-IDTBR is 0.22 eV (or 0.12 eV), which is sufficient for effective charge transfer.

Photoluminescence
Photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were employed to distinguish whether or not there is efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer between the polymer donors and EH-IDTBR in the blend films. The wavelengths of 520, 550 and 630 nm were used for the excitations of PSS2, PSS3 and EH-IDTBR, respectively, according to their maximum absorption peaks. Fig. 3 displays the PL spectra of both copolymers, EH-IDTBR and the blend films. PSS2 and PSS3 show emissions in the range from 580 to 850 nm. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, for both blends based on PSS2 or PSS3 with the quenching treatment, PL of the polymers is nearly completely quenched by the incorporation of EH-IDTBR, indicating an efficient electron transfer from the copolymers to EH-IDTBR when excitons are produced from the donor copolymers. The emission band of the EH-IDTBR acceptor is located around 650–900 nm when excited at 630 nm. The emission of the blend film (Fig. 3c) based on PSS2:EH-IDTBR (quenching) is also better quenched by PSS2 when compared with that of PSS3:EH-IDTBR. These results indicate that the hole charge transfer can occur efficiently despite a small HOMO energy difference of 0.22 eV for the PSS2:EH-IDTBR blend. As shown in Fig. 3a and c, for the blend film of PSS2:EH-IDTBR with the quenching treatment, the emissions of PSS2 and EH-IDTBR are completely quenched by EH-IDTBR and PSS2, respectively, while the PL quenching is less complete for the as-cast PSS2:EH-IDTBR film. These results suggest that the quenching treatment on the blend film can enhance the electron and hole transfer between the donor and the acceptor, which will contribute to stronger photoresponses in the range from 300 to 700 nm.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of both copolymer materials, PSCs were fabricated using EH-IDTBR as the acceptor with a typical device architecture of glass/indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/ZnO/polymer:EH-IDTBR/MoO3/Ag. As is known, the inverted device structure has advantages in improving the stability of PSCs compared to the conventional configuration. CB was chosen as the solvent, and diphenyl ether (1% DPE, v/v) was used as an additive. A total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in CB was used for the fabrication of PSCs. The optimal active layer thickness for PSS2:EH-IDTBR (PSS3:EH-IDTBR) is around 70 nm (90 nm). The corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4a and S3.†Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of the devices based on polymer:EH-IDTBR blends. As expected, the devices based on PSS2 exhibited a VOC as high as 1.066 V. But the VOC of the device decreased slightly when other donor:acceptor blend ratios were used. At the same time, the blend ratio of PSS2:EH-IDTBR had a significant effect on the JSC of the device, and the value increased from 13.73 to 14.12 mA cm−2 when the donor ratio decreased from 1:2 to 1:2.5. As a result, the PSCs based on the as-cast blend film with a blend ratio of 1:2.5 showed the highest PCE of 8.05% with a high VOC of 1.066 V, a JSC of 14.12 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53.5%. Compared to the PSS2-based counterparts, PSS3-based devices showed a lower PCE of 4.65% with an enhanced VOC of 1.128 V. The increased VOC for the PSS3-based devices is attributed to the much deeper HOMO energy level of PSS3 (−5.46 eV) in comparison with PSS2 (−5.36 eV).

Up to now, several useful strategies have been used for controlling the morphology of blend films, such as use of additives, thermal annealing and solvent vapor annealing treatment, which is vital to achieve high-performance PSCs. In our case, PSS2-based devices without any treatment showed a poor device performance. However, when DPE (1%, v/v) or thermal annealing treatment was used, the PCE of the devices could be enhanced efficiently (Table S1 and Fig. S4†). The improvement when the DPE additive is used is mainly attributed to an increase in JSC though the FF suffered from an obvious decrease. Nevertheless, thermal annealing treatment alone can increase the FF of PSCs. In order to achieve both a high JSC and FF, we quenched the blend films with methanol immediately after constantly heating the substrate at 120 °C for 10 min, which is the so-called “quenching treatment”. Surprisingly, as presented in Table 3 and Fig. 4a, after the quenching treatment, the PCE of the PSS2-based device dramatically increased to 9.46% with a high VOC of 1.033 V, a large JSC of 15.70 mA cm−2 and a relatively high FF of 58.3%. Notably, it is the first example of a ladder-type aromatic-based copolymer exhibiting a PCE over 9%, to the best of our knowledge.5,34,43–47 When the PSS2-based blend was quenched with methanol at room temperature, the performance of the corresponding device was not enhanced, as shown in Table S1 and Fig. S4.† The PSS3-based devices with the quenching treatment (120 °C) displayed an inferior PCE of 4.74% with an enlarged VOC of 1.138 V and a decreased FF of 43.2%. For comparison, the devices based on PSS2:PC71BM or PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR were also fabricated using a process identical to the preparation process mentioned above, and the corresponding PCEs of the devices are 2.62% and 8.40% (Fig. S5†), respectively. Furthermore, the energy loss in the PSS2:EH-IDTBR-based device was calculated to be around 0.64 eV, which is still large in comparison with that of other high-performance PSC systems. Thus, there is still room to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the devices based on PSS2 through a fine adjustment in the energy level alignment.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the best-performing devices were recorded to evaluate their photoresponse to the solar spectrum. As shown in Fig. 4b, all EQE spectra of the best-performing devices have broad and high photocurrent responses in the range of 300–750 nm, which is consistent with the nature of WBG materials. The photocurrent values integrated from the EQE data agree with the measured JSC values in the J–V characteristic curves, and the mismatches are less than 5%. Compared with the as-cast device based on PSS2, the maximum EQE value for PSS2-based PSCs with the quenching treatment increases from 73% to 79%, which suggests a higher photo-conversion efficiency by the absorption of both the PSS2 donor and EH-IDTBR acceptor. The EQE responses in the range from 620 to 750 nm are mainly ascribed to the absorption of EH-IDTBR. The relatively strong photo-response for the device with the quenching treatment in this region indicates an efficient hole transfer from the HOMO of EH-IDTBR to that of PSS2, which is consistent with the result from the PL quenching experiment.
The origin of the quenching treatment influence on the PSC performance was first determined by the UV-vis absorption measurement. Fig. 5 shows the absorption spectra of PSS2:EH-IDTBR (1:2.5, w/w) blend films with or without the quenching treatment. A stronger absorption in the range from 300 to 700 nm could be clearly observed in the film after the quenching treatment, in comparison with that of the as-cast blend film. This stronger absorption might be attributed to the more ordered structure of molecules induced by the quenching treatment, and it should be beneficial to increase the JSC of the resulting PSCs.

To date, significant achievements in the PCE of PSCs have been made, while research on the stability of PSCs is more or less neglected.36,50,51 Using more stable active materials is one of the judicious approaches to improve the stability of devices. As is known, copolymers with ladder-type fused-ring aromatics may show some advantages in device stability.34,36 Thus, continual measurements of the device performance were performed to assess the stability of the best-performing PSS2-based PSCs in this work. The devices were encapsulated using a glass cover with epoxy and kept under ambient conditions to measure the stability. Fig. 6a displays the normalized PCEs versus the storage time. As expected, after 120 days, the PCE of the PSS2-based device still maintained a high value of 9.03%, which is 95% of its original value (Fig. 6b). However, the best-performing PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR-based device delivered relatively inferior stability with a PCE of 90% of the original value after only 20 days (Fig. S6†). The excellent storage stability of PSS2-based devices could be attributed to the improved morphology related to their molecular structures.

Charge carrier generation, transport and recombination
To know the exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes of PSCs, we measured the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4c). Here, Jph is equal to JL−JD, in which JL and JD are the current density under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) and the current density under dark conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, Veff is equal to V0–V, in which V and V0 are the applied bias voltage and the voltage when Jph is zero, respectively. For the PSS2:EH-IDTBR-based devices, Jph achieves saturation (Jsat) at a high Veff (Veff ≥ 2 V), indicating that the photo-generated excitons are efficiently dissociated into carriers and then collected by the corresponding electrodes. The Jph/Jsat ratio is used to estimate the charge dissociation probability of the device. Under short-circuit conditions, the value was calculated to be up to 92.0% for the PSS2-based device with the quenching treatment. However, for the PSS3-based device, Jph exhibits a strong dependence on the Veff, suggesting a poor exciton dissociation and charge extraction with a ratio of 82.0%. Interestingly, the Jph/Jsat ratio is increased from 87% to 92% when the quenching treatment is used. The improved value suggests that the quenching treatment could help achieve a more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, resulting in an increased JSC value for the device. Furthermore, the shunt resistance increases from 0.44 to 0.56 KΩ cm2 and the series resistance reduces from 12.9 to 9.87 Ω cm2 for the device with the quenching treatment, implying better ohmic contact formed by the treatment which can be further confirmed in the subsequently morphology images.
The dependence of JSC at different light intensities (Plight) provides a deeper insight into the carrier recombination process in the non-fullerene PSCs. The relationship between Plight and JSC can be described using the equation of JSC ∝ Plightα, in which the exponential factor (α) suggests the degree of bimolecular recombination in the device. Generally, the α value is close to 1 when the bimolecular recombination in the device could be neglected. As presented in Fig. 4d, α is 0.980 for the PSS2-based device with the quenching treatment suggesting weak bimolecular recombination which is partially responsible for its relatively higher FF of 58.3%. However, the device with the as-cast blend film shows a lower α of 0.956, which indicates relatively severe bimolecular recombination. The results suggest that the bimolecular recombination could be suppressed by the quenching treatment. Compared to the low bimolecular recombination for the device based on PSS2, the α value is as low as 0.891 for the PSS3-based device, which agrees with its lower FF of 43.2%.
The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to determine the mobilities of polymer:EH-IDTBR blend films. The obtained results are shown in Table S2 and Fig. S7.† The structures of hole- and electron-only devices are ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:EH-IDTBR/Au and ITO/ZnO/polymer:EH-IDTBR/Ca/Al, respectively. For the as-cast film based on PSS2, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were calculated to be 6.60 × 10−6 and 1.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, the corresponding μh and μe values for the blend film with the quenching treatment are dramatically improved to be 2.85 × 10−5 and 2.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are higher than those of the as-cast film. In addition, a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.36 is found for the film with the quenching treatment. The relatively higher and more balanced mobilities are in favor for less carrier recombination, and subsequently higher JSC and FF values for the corresponding device. For the PSS3:EH-IDTBR film with the quenching treatment, the corresponding μh and μe values are determined to be 1.34 × 10−5 and 4.52 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole and electron mobilities of PSS3:EH-IDTBR (μh/μe = 0.30) are less balanced in comparison with those of its PSS2-based counterpart, which is partly responsible for the rather low FF of the device based on PSS3. This result agrees with the improved performance of the PSS2-based device compared with that of PSS3.
Morphology
To obtain more insights into the significantly diverse performance of the copolymers, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were employed to investigate the morphology of the blend films. The polymer:EH-IDTBR blend films were prepared in an identical fashion to those used for device fabrication. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the as-cast blend film based on PSS2 is rather coarse with a RMS roughness of 1.80 nm, whereas the value dramatically decreases to 0.49 nm after the quenching treatment. The smooth blend film could help to form better ohmic contact with other interlayers. From the AFM phase images (Fig. 7e), a well-developed interpenetrating network with finely and homogeneously diffused domains with a small size is clearly observed for the PSS2:EH-IDTBR film with the quenching treatment, in which a relatively large interfacial area could be provided for efficient exciton dissociation between the PSS2 donor and the EH-IDTBR acceptor. As a result, higher JSC and FF values were obtained for the device with the quenching treatment. However, the as-cast blend film shows a phase separation with a large and anomalous domain size, which is unfavorable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection. As presented in Fig. 7f, the phase separation for the PSS3-based film with the quenching treatment is less pronounced in comparison with that for the PSS2-based blend which agrees with the lower PCE of 4.74% of the latter.

The scan size is 500 nm × 500 nm. 
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, two novel WBG polymers (PSS2 and PSS3) based on ladder-type DTCD were successfully designed and synthesized for non-fullerene PSCs. Through quenching treatment, the best-performing PSS2-based device exhibited an intriguing PCE of 9.46% with a JSC of 15.70 mA cm−2, a FF of 58.3% and a VOC of 1.033 V. The 9.46% PCE is the highest among all semiconducting copolymers based on ladder-type fused-ring aromatics so far. In contrast, the other copolymer PSS3 delivered a lower PCE of 4.74% due to its poor exciton dissociation and charge transfer, stronger bimolecular recombination, and lower charge carrier mobility. Furthermore, the best-performing PSS2-based device showed excellent shelf-stability. These results suggest that ladder-type DTCD is a promising building block for high-performance WBG copolymers which would have tremendous applications in non-fullerene, ternary blend, and multi-junction solar cells.

Synthesis


PSS2
          . 
Compound M1 (0.15 g, 0.1 mmol) and compound M2 (0.068 g, 0.099 mmol) were added to a 50 mL two-neck flask with 14 mL of toluene. After bubbling the solution mixture with N2 for 20 min, Pd2(dba)3 (5 mg) and P(o-tol)3 (12.5 mg) were added quickly. Then, the solution was bubbled with N2 for another 10 min. The degassed solution mixture was heated to 100 °C for 2 h under the protection of N2. After cooling to room temperature, the crude product was precipitated with 150 mL of methanol. The copolymer was collected by filtration and Soxhlet-extracted with methanol, acetone, hexanes, dichloromethane and chloroform, successively. The final chloroform solution was precipitated again with methanol, and the precipitate was filtered. Then the copolymer (PSS2) was dried under vacuum at 50 °C to yield a dark red solid (0.14 g, 81%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.91 (s, 7H), 7.29 (s, 9H), 7.25 (s, 4H), 7.13 (m, 6H), 4.76 (s, 2H), 2.57 (m, 9H), 1.61 (s, 12H), 1.29 (br, 58H), 0.88 (s, 20H). GPC (in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene): Mn = 72.1 KDa, Mw = 176.6 KDa, PDI = 2.45.



PSS3
          . 

PSS3 was synthesized by using the same procedure as that for PSS2. Yield: 85.0%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.92 (s, 4H), 7.50 (s, 2H), 7.37 (s, 2H),7.23 (s, 8H), 7.10 (s, 10H), 3.37 (s, 4H), 2.57 (s, 8H), 1.80 (s, 2H), 1.28 (br, 64H), 0.89 (s, 24H). GPC (in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene): Mn = 69.3 KDa, Mw = 139.3 KDa, PDI = 2.01.

General characterization

1H NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE-400 spectrometer at 298 K with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. Mass spectroscopy (MS) measurements were carried out by using an IonSpec 4.7T spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Lambda 365 UV-vis spectrophotometer. GPC measurements were conducted on an Agilent PL-GPC 220. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a Netzsch STA449C platform with a heating rate of 10 K min−1. Photoluminescence spectra were measured on a Cary spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded on a CHI 604E electrochemical workstation in the solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M in acetonitrile). Atomic force microscope images were collected on a Bruker Dimension Icon AFM using the PeakForce tapping mode. Hole- and electron-only mobilities of active layers were measured using the SCLC method with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:EH-IDTBR/Au and ITO/ZnO/polymer:EH-IDTBR/Ca/Al, respectively.
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
PSCs were fabricated with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The cleaning of ITO glass and the ZnO preparation process have been reported previously.38 The overall concentration of polymer:EH-IDTBR in chlorobenzene is fixed at 20 mg mL−1. The polymer:EH-IDTBR solution was subsequently spin-coated (1800 rpm, 60 s) on the sol–gel processed ZnO layer to form the active layer and then quenched with methanol at 120 °C. Finally, 10 nm of MoO3 layer and 100 nm of Ag layer were deposited onto the active layer through thermal evaporation with shadow masks. The active area of the devices was 6 mm2. The measurements of J–V and EQE curves were carried out using the same methods and instruments we previously reported.52
