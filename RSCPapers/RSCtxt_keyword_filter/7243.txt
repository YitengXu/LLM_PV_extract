    , Accepted 15th October 2012First published on 16th October 2012AbstractThree-dimensional hierarchical tin oxide microspheres (HM-SnO2) are successfully synthesized by hydrothermal treatment. The SnO2 microspheres with diameter of 1–4 μm are pure rutile phase and consist of nanosheets. The two-dimensional nanosheets ensure fast electron transport and slow charge carrier recombination. Due to their large particle size, the HM-SnO2 films can scatter light efficiently and enhance light harvesting. Because of the above advantages, a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) based on the HM-SnO2 photoanode shows an energy conversion efficiency of 4.55%, which indicates a 12.6% improvement compared to the DSSC based on a current SnO2 nanoparticle photoanode prepared under the same conditions. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC can be improved by modifying the photoanode with a TiO2 blocking layer and TiCl4 post-treatment.
Introduction
Since the first report on the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) in 1991 by O'Regan and Gratzel,1 DSSCs have drawn significant attention because of their low-cost and facile fabrication process.2 Until now, more than 12% light-to-electric conversion efficiency has been reported.3 In the operation of DSSCs, photon energy is absorbed by the dye molecules adsorbed on a metal oxide semiconductor with wide band gap and generates excited electrons. These electrons are quickly injected into the metal oxide and are collected by a conducting substrate. The oxidized dye molecules can be reduced by iodide ions in the electrolyte, and the resulting triiodide ions can accept electrons from the platinized counter electrode to complete a current cycle in DSSCs.4,5
As a wide band gap metal oxide, TiO2 has been widely used in DSSCs due to its good properties.6,7 Besides TiO2, other semiconductor metal oxides, such as ZnO,8,9 Nb2O510 and SnO2 have also been investigated as potential alternatives to TiO2.11,12 Among them, SnO2 has two advantages compared to TiO2 for use in DSSCs: one is its higher electron mobility, which leads to faster transport of photoinjected electrons to a conductive oxide current collector; the other is its wider band gap (3.6 eV) than anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV), which creates fewer oxidative holes in the valence band under UV illumination, so as to minimize the dye degradation rate and improve the long-term stability of DSSCs. In spite of these advantages, the DSSCs based on SnO2 have lower energy conversion efficiency than those based on TiO2 so far.
The poor performance of the DSSCs based on SnO2 has been attributed mostly to the fast electron recombination in the SnO2 layers; also, the low dye adsorption by SnO2 leads to low conversion efficiency. These issues have been partly overcome by engineering the SnO2 surface with barrier layers such as ZnO, TiO2 or MgO.13,14
It is well known that an efficient photoanode for DSSCs should not only have high surface area for dye loading, but also possess a densely packed microstructure for fast electron diffusing and light scattering. For a photoanode consisting of nanoparticles, the poor interconnectivity between particles results in high charge carrier recombination losses, therefore, one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) metal-oxide architectures have attracted great attention, because these ordered nanomaterials contribute to faster electron transport and slower charge carrier recombination.15,16 On the other hand, a photoanode consisting of nanoparticles is rather transparent, which results in the transmittance and loss of a portion of visible light. In order to improve the light harvesting efficiency, many efforts have been focused on micrometer-sized particles which can confine the incident light within the electrode.17 Recently, ordered nanostructures such as SnO2 nanowires and SnO2 nanorod arrays have been applied to improve photovoltaic properties due to their faster electron diffusion. However, the limit in the surface area of the 1D or 2D nanostructures hinders significant improvement of the energy conversion efficiency.
In this work, we describe the synthesis of hierarchical SnO2 microspheres (HM-SnO2) consisting of nanosheets by hydrothermal treatment and their application as high-performance photoanodes in DSSCs. The as-synthesized samples are micrometer-sized and, thus, can function as efficient light scatterers, while the samples consisting of nanosheets can efficiently minimize the grain interface effect and offer fast electron transport capability. It is expected that the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs can be improved by using HM-SnO2 as the photoanode.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
Sensitized dye N719 (RuL2(NCS)2, L = 4,4′-dicarboxylate-2,2′-bipyridine) was purchased from Solaronix SA (Switzerland). Tin oxide, tin dichloride dihydrate, titanium tetrachloride, oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrazine monohydrate, polyethylene glycol 20000 (PEG), tetrabutyl ammonium iodide, alcohol, iodine, 4-tert-butylpyridine, lithium iodide, isopropanol, ethyl cellulose, terpineol and acetonitrile were all analytically pure and all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. All reagents were used without further treatment. Conducting glass plates (FTO glass, fluorine doped tin oxide over-layer, sheet resistance 8 Ω cm−2, purchased from Hartford Glass Co. USA) were used as substrates for precipitating SnO2 films.
Synthesis of HM-SnO2
HM-SnO2 was synthesized as reported previously.18 In a typical procedure, 2.25 g tin dichloride dihydrate and 5.6 g oxalic acid were dissolved in distilled water (200 mL) followed by the addition of 0.4 mL hydrochloric acid (35 wt%). Subsequently, 2.16 g hydrazine monohydrate aqueous solution (80 wt%) was added gradually under magnetic stirring until the stock solution became clear. This was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and reacted hydrothermally at 180 °C for 14 h. After the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature, the samples were centrifuged and rinsed thoroughly with distilled water several times, dried in air at 60 °C for 24 h and calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. HM-SnO2 thus was obtained.
Preparation of SnO2 paste
To prepare HM-SnO2 paste, 0.2 g ethylene cellulose was added to 5 g turpentine oil. Then HM-SnO2 was added to 10 mL absolute ethanol. Finally, the above two solutions were mixed by stirring for 2 days to yield a slurry.
For comparison, the preparation technique for the SnO2 nanoparticles (NP-SnO2) paste was similar to that for the HM-SnO2 paste except the paste was made using commercially available NP-SnO2 with sizes about 50 nm.
Fabrication of DSSCs
First, the cleaned FTO glass was immersed into a 0.2 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 at room temperature overnight and washed with water and ethanol, then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the slurry was spread uniformly onto a FTO glass substrate with adhesive tape to control the thickness of the SnO2 film and to provide a noncoated area for electrical contact. After drying in air, the film was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. TiCl4 post-treatment was performed by dipping the SnO2 electrodes into 0.2 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 80 °C until the TiCl4 was hydrolyzed, then washing the electrodes with distilled water to remove residual TiCl4, and then again sintering at 500 °C in air for 30 min. When cooled to room temperature, the film was sensitized by 2.5 × 10−4 M N719 absolute ethanol solution for 24 h to adsorb the dye adequately. Consequently, a SnO2 film electrode was obtained. Then the electrode was sandwiched together with a platinized FTO counter electrode. Platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by thermal deposition of chloroplatinic acid solution (5 mM in isopropanol) onto FTO glasses. The redox electrolyte (0.6 M tetrabutyl ammonium iodide, 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.1 M iodine and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was injected into the aperture between the dye sensitized SnO2 film electrode and counter electrode.
Measurements and characterization
HM-SnO2 was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD PANALYTICAL, X'Pert PRO, Cu Kα, 40 mA, λ = 0.15406 nm). Their morphologies and sizes were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4800). The diffuse reflectance of SnO2 film was measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV2550, Shimadzu, Japan). The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) under irradiation with a simulated solar light with intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a xenon arc lamp (XQ-500 W, Shanghai Photo-electricity Device Company, China) in ambient atmosphere.
The photovoltaic performances, fill factor (FF) and light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC were calculated according to the following equations:19 (1) (2)where JSC is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), VOC is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power, Pmax is the maximum power output, Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage at the point of maximum power output in the J–V curves, respectively.
Results and discussion
Morphology, phase and surface area

Fig. 1a shows the typical SEM image of HM-SnO2, from which 3D hierarchical microspheres with diameter of 1–4 μm are observed. The high magnification image in Fig. 1b shows a hierarchical structure with numerous randomly arranged SnO2 nanosheets in the sphere. Fig. 1c shows that the particle size of NP-SnO2 is about 50 nm.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of HM-SnO2 and NP-SnO2. It can be seen that all the diffraction peaks of HM-SnO2 can be indexed well to a rutile structure of HM-SnO2 (JCPDS card no. 41-1445); no peak for other phases indicates that HM-SnO2 is highly pure rutile phase, similar to that of NP-SnO2.

Furthermore, nitrogen sorptometer measurements were used to characterize the pore structures of the HM-SnO2 film (film-2) and the film-2 modified with TiO2 blocking layer and TiCl4 post-treatment (film-1), and the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the two films are shown in Fig. 3a. The specific surface areas of film-1 and film-2 are 16 and 14 m2 g−1, respectively, as obtained using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement. The pore size distribution (Fig. 3b) derived from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model indicates that both the films contain two types of pores. The first type may be ascribed to a smaller portion of mesopores (about 40 nm) which come from the parallel assembly of the nanosheets. The second type comprises a majority of slit-like pores (about 60 and 110 nm) which result from randomly assembled nanosheets. The voids formed by interaggregated spheres may also contribute to the second type of pores.

Modification of photoanode

Fig. 4a shows the J–V characteristics of the DSSCs based on four kinds of films (DSSC-1: HM-SnO2 + TiO2 blocking layer + TiCl4 post-treatment; DSSC-2: HM-SnO2; DSSC-3: HM-SnO2 + TiO2 blocking layer; DSSC-4: HM-SnO2 + TiCl4 post-treatment), and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 1. By modifying the HM-SnO2 surface with TiCl4 post-treatment, the DSSC-4 exhibits energy conversion efficiency (η) of 3.20%, whereas the DSSC with bare HM-SnO2 (DSSC-2) only gives an efficiency of 1.53%. This enhanced efficiency might be attributed to the energy barrier formed after TiCl4 treatment which then leads to slow charge carrier recombination. It is also observed that the DSSC with SnO2 photoelectrode modified with a TiO2 blocking layer (DSSC-3) has better photovoltaic performance (3.08%). The improvement of energy conversion efficiency compared to that of DSSC-2 should be ascribed to the suppression of the charge carrier recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface. In addition, the higher density of the compact TiO2 blocking layer improves adherence between the HM-SnO2 layer and the FTO glass surface, which provides more electron pathways from the SnO2 layer to FTO glass and subsequently enhances the electron transfer efficiency.11 As can be found from Table 1, DSSC-4 shows a lower FF than DSSC-1, the main reason for this can be attributed to the TiO2 blocking layer. The blocking layer can improve the incident light harvesting, and also improve the electron transportation, which enhance the fill factor. After the introduction of both TiO2 blocking layer and TiCl4 post-treatment, DSSC-1 shows the highest efficiency of 4.55%. To investigate the reason for the high efficiency of DSSC-1, the dye loaded amounts for film-1 and film-2 were measured as 5.02 × 10−7 and 3.43 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. The dye loaded amount of film-1 is 46.3% higher than that of film-2, however, the η value of DSSC-1 is about three times higher than that of DSSC-1, so the main reason for the high efficiency for DSSC-1 can be attributed to reduced charge carrier recombination.

Fig. 4b shows the changes in the dark current with applied bias. This current is indicative of the recombination of the electrons with the electrolyte. The onset of recombination current occurs at higher potential for DSSC-1 compared to that for DSSC-2. The observed decrease in dark current density of DSSC-1 is essentially due to the suppression of I3− reduction at the dye-sensitized HM-SnO2 electrode. One explanation for the decrease in the dark current in the case of the DSSC-1 relates to the increased energy barrier at the HM-SnO2/electrolyte interface. TiCl4 post-treatment can form a barrier at the HM-SnO2/electrolyte interface, owing to the fact that the TiO2 conduction band edge is more negative than that of SnO2. This energy barrier reduces the back electron transfer from the conduction band of HM-SnO2 to I3− in the electrolyte, which in turn increases the VOC. The other explanation is that the TiO2 compact layer between FTO/HM-SnO2 benefits the electron transfer from the SnO2 film to the FTO glass and the reduced charge carrier recombination occurring at the SnO2/FTO interface.
Comparison between HM-SnO2 and NP-SnO2

Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics of the DSSCs based on four kinds of film (DSSC-1; DSSC-2; DSSC-5, film-5: NP-SnO2 + TiO2 blocking layer + TiCl4 post-treatment; DSSC-6: NP-SnO2), and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 2. Comparatively, DSSC-2 shows a higher energy conversion efficiency (1.53%) than DSSC-6 (1.21%) as shown in Fig. 5. After modification with TiO2 blocking layer and TiCl4 post-treatment, DSSC-1 (4.55%) still exhibits better performance than DSSC-5 (3.97%). This can be attributed to the following factors: first, compared to NP-SnO2, the interconnected nanosheets forming HM-SnO2 provide a faster electron transfer rate due to a decreased number of grain contact barriers.20 Second, HM-SnO2 is also expected to promote electrolyte diffusion in the DSSC because of the mesoporous structure. It is well known that the efficient diffusion of I3−/I− to regenerate the dye is important to the photovoltaic response of the DSSC. Finally, light scattering from HM-SnO2, which extends the distance that light travels within the metal oxide film and provides the photons with more opportunities to be absorbed by the dye molecules, results in a significant improvement in the light harvest ability of the photoelectrode.21,22 This is supported by the results shown in Fig. 7.

In order to study the interfacial reactions of photoexcited electrons in DSSCs, EIS measurements were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 6. Two well-defined arcs extending from total series resistance (RS) are observed in the measured frequency range. The first arc (R1) in the high frequency region is attributed to the impedance corresponding to the charge-transfer process occurring at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, while the second arc (R2) in the low frequency region is attributed to the charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.23 The fitted data are put together in Table 3. It can be seen that the R2 value (21.1 Ω) of DSSC-1 is a bit smaller than that of DSSC-5 (28.6 Ω), reflecting the decrease of the charge transfer resistance on the electrode/electrolyte interface. The reason for the low charge transport resistance is that the faster charge transport in HM-SnO2 nanosheets efficiently decreases the recombination probability with iodine redox carriers.24 In the case of NP-SnO2, photoinjected electron transportation through the photoanode film is slower and results in more recombination probability.25 Hence, 2D nanosheets in HM-SnO2 facilitate fast electron transport in films with less movement hindrance, and higher FF and VOC are obtained.

The electron lifetime (Γeff) could be calculated from the low frequency (fmax) as: (3)where fmax is the peak frequency in the low-frequency range.26 Compared to DSSC-5 (28.6 Hz), DSSC-1 (59.2 Hz) shows a smaller value of fmax. These data suggest that electrons in DSSC-1 have a longer lifetime than that in DSSC-5. In other words, the diffusion of electrons in film-1 is faster than that in film-5. It is believed that HM-SnO2, consisting of tightly packed nanosheets, favors the electron transport through a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance compared to NP-SnO2.
The light scattering properties of film-1 and film-5 were investigated with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 7. Clearly, both films show high diffuse reflection ability in the wavelength range between 370 nm and 450 nm. However, a fast drop in the diffuse reflection ability is observed for film-5 as the wavelength increases from 450 nm to 800 nm, and this causes the unabsorbed light to penetrate through the film without being back scattered to enhance light absorption. This is mainly attributed to the small particle size of NP-SnO2 (∼50 nm), which is much smaller than the visible light wavelength. In contrast, film-1 shows higher diffuse reflection ability in the longer wavelength region (450–800 nm), suggesting that the incident light is more efficiently scattered by the film consisting of HM-SnO2 due to the larger particle size that is comparable to the visible light wavelength. The improved light scattering effect can thus increase the light traveling path and enhance the interaction between SnO2 and dye molecules, resulting in higher light harvesting efficiency and corresponding higher photocurrent. In addition, the charge transport through film-1 might be improved due to better connectivity between nanosheets, as previously discussed in the FESEM image in Fig. 1b, which contributes to better charge collection and higher JSC (10.4 mA cm−2) than DSSC-5 (8.83 mA cm−2).

Conclusion
In summary, 3D-hierarchical tin oxide microsphere (HM-SnO2) consisting of nanosheets has been successfully synthesized by hydrothermal treatment. HM-SnO2 can be a candidate for an electrode material since it offers an interconnected 2D structure and light scattering together with mesoscale pores. The photovoltaic performance of the DSSC with a HM-SnO2 photoanode is further improved by modification with a TiO2 blocking layer and TiCl4 post-treatment. The DSSC with HM-SnO2 exhibits a higher energy conversion efficiency compared to the DSSC with NP-SnO2.
