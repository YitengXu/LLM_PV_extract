, Accepted 11th November 2013First published on 11th November 2013AbstractTwo simple D–A–D structured small molecules based on diketopyrrolopyrrole as central acceptor unit and different terminal units (indole and 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl for CSDPP1 and CSDPP3 respectively) with broad absorption band and suitable energy levels were synthesized. The new DPP molecules are fully characterized and their photovoltaic properties were investigated using them as donor components along with PC70BM as acceptor in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer. The organic BHJ solar cells based on CSDPP1:PC70BM and CSDPP3:PC70BM (1:1 D–A ratio) cast from chloroform solvent showed moderate power conversion efficiency of about 3.26% and 2.42%, respectively. The higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells based on CSDPP1 as donor as compared to CSDPP3 has been attributed to the higher hole mobility and absorption coefficient and low optical band gap of CSDPP1. The PCE of the thermally annealed device based on CSDPP1:PC70BM has been improved up to 4.96% attributed to the better film morphology and increased absorption of the BHJ active layer. We attribute the increase in absorption intensity upon thermal annealing to the stronger electrical polarization in the BHJ active layer resulting from morphological changes i.e. crystallinity and molecular aggregation. Finally, the capacitance–voltage measurements indicates that the increasing local electrical polarizations upon thermal annealing can lead to an enhancement of the charge generation from the excitons at donor–acceptor interfaces and their transportation to the respective electrodes in the BHJ device, leading to better short circuit photocurrents and fill factors.
Introduction
There has been a continuous interest in the search for low cost materials for solar cells to replace inorganic silicon based solar cells. Among all solar cell technologies organic solar cells (OSCs) lead the way for their low costs, easy synthetic methods, sustainability and plastic processing ability.1–4 Among various OSCs, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have attracted significant attention because of their potential for achieving large area, flexible photovoltaic devices with fast roll to roll production and are predicted to yield power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 10%, provided a suitable low band gap donor material is used along with a fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor.5 Generally, the BHJ solar cells consist of an active layer, where the donor phase is intimately intermixed with the acceptor phase, and sandwiched between indium doped tin oxide (ITO) glass and aluminum (Al) electrodes. The increased donor–acceptor (D–A) interfacial area leads to much easier access for the photogenerated excitons to the D–A interface as well as their efficient dissociation into holes and electrons and hence improve the PCE.6,7 Significant improvement in the PCE from 2% to 9% has been achieved by designing effective photoactive materials, device architectures, and processing techniques.8–14 All the efficient BHJ solar cells are based on the low band gap copolymers (donor) and fullerene derivatives (acceptor). Despite these advancements, the PCE of polymer–fullerene solar cells is limited by factors such as complex synthesis and unknown long term stability.15 Recently, organic solar cells based on solution processed small molecules (SM) have been emerging as an alternative to polymer counterparts,4,16–21 offering several promising advantages such as monodispersity and well defined structure, easy purification, and minimised batch to batch variation. The PCE of the organic solar cells based on the BHJ active layer of small molecules as an electron donor and fullerene derivatives as an acceptor has reached more than 6.5%.3,18,22–28 Recently, Jhou et al. have reported PCE of about 8.12% based on small molecule donors.29 More recently Heeger et al. have achieved a PCE of 9.02% for solution processed small molecule bulk heterojunction solar cells with the incorporation of a 10 nm Ba layer in between the cathode and the active layer.30
A useful strategy for synthesizing conjugated small molecules in optoelectronic devices is to begin with a chromophore that can absorb most of the visible region of the solar spectrum. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is a chromophore with a desirable molecular building block because of its high thermal, mechanical and chemical stabilities, colour strengths and ease of synthesis and modification.31,32 These chromophores containing hydrogen atom at the lactam nitrogens are insoluble in most of the common solvents owing to intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the lactam units and π–π stacking between the π-systems. Due to the electron deficiency of the lactam structure in DPP, electron donating functional groups such as thienyl and phenyl derivatives are selected to incorporate with DPP as linkage and end-capping groups to further tune properties such as the optical band gap, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels. Alkyl chains are introduced on the conjugated backbone to induce solubility in common organic solvents, and to modify the degree of crystallinity and specific packing motif.33–41 In recent years, potential of soluble DPP molecules and polymers has been explored with high promising PCE in organic solar cells.42–47 Recently, Yao et al. reported a PCE of 5.29% for a solution processed SM based on DPP, namely BDT-DPP.48 Moreover, the DPP based D–A copolymers have shown PCE of about 7%.49 Therefore, DPP based materials functionalized with a D–A structure will have potential for organic photovoltaic devices.
In this paper, we reported the synthesis and characterization of small molecules based on D–A–D structure with central thiophene capped DPP (TDPP) act as acceptor and different indole (CSDPP1) and 2,4,6-tri-isopropyl phenyl (CSDPP3) donor units at end terminal. Photovoltaic properties of these small molecules were investigated by fabrication of OPV devices with configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CSDPP1 or CSDPP3:PC70BM/Al. We have achieved a PCE of the organic BHJ solar cells using CSDPP1:PC70BM and CSDPP3:PC70BM about 3.26% and 2.42%, respectively. The higher PCE for device based on CSDPP1 as donor is due to higher hole mobility and absorption coefficient for CSDPP1 thin film. The PCE of the device based on CSDPP1:PC70BM has been enhanced up to 4.96% when the device was thermally annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. The increase in the PCE upon the thermal annealing has been investigated using the capacitance–voltage characteristics measurement in dark as well under illumination, AFM and XRD analysis.
Experimental details
Experimental section
The starting materials thiophene carbonitrile, di-n-ethylsuccinate, t-BuOK, t-amyl alcohol, bromodecane, indole boronicacid, triisopropyl phenyl boronicacid and N-bromosuccinimide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The solvents were purified by standard procedures and purged with nitrogen before use. All other chemicals used in this work were analytical grade and were used without further purification, and all reactions were performed under argon atmosphere. Chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (60–120 mesh). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer using TMS as an internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on Shimadzu LCMS- 2010 EV model with ESI probe. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-Vis to near IR region 3600 spectrometer.
General synthesis
The synthetic routes of the CSDPP1 and CSDPP3 molecules are shown in Scheme 1. In the first step 3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c] pyrrole-1,4-dione was synthesized according to a reported procedure50–52 followed by N-alkylation of compound 1 with 1-bromodecane to afford pure 2,5-di-n-decyl-3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione as a purple brown shiny crystalline powder (yield: 75.4%), and then bromination of compound 2 with NBS afforded 3,6-bis-(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-di-n-decyl-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione as a shiny dark-purple powder (yield: 64%). Compound 3 was then subjected to Suzuki coupling reaction with aryl boronic acids using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst. The corresponding yields of CSDPP1 and CSDPP3 are 45.2% and 63.8% respectively. The structure of all of the key intermediates and two novel organic DPP molecules have been confirmed by 1H NMR, ESI-HRMS. At room temperature, these synthesized small molecules exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane and THF because of the alkyl groups substituted on the DPP molecules.

Device fabrication and characterization
The indium doped tin oxide coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially by sonicating in detergent solution, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min each and then dried for 10 min in ambient atmosphere. A thin layer of about 50 nm thickness of PEDOT:PSS was spin coated on the pre-cleaned ITO coated glass substrate at 1500 rpm for 60 s and then baked at 120 °C for 10 min in ambient atmosphere. The photoactive layer was deposited by spin cast (2000 rpm for 60 s) from the chloroform (CF) solution containing the donor i.e. CSDPP1 or CSDPP3 and PC70BM acceptor. The thickness of the blend layer is in the range of 80–85 nm and dried at 60 °C for 30 min. After that Al cathode electrode was deposited onto the top of active layer under shadow mask of area 4 mm2 with a base pressure of 10−5 Torr by thermal evaporation. For the thermal annealing, the device was annealed at 110 °C for 10 min in ambient condition. Photovoltaic cells without protective encapsulation were subsequently tested at AM1.5 G irradiation. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were recorded using a Keithley source meter (model 2400). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured using a monochromator and xenon lamp as light source.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the CSDPPs in CF solution and thin film cast from the CF solution are shown in Fig. 1a and b. Two absorption peaks were observed for each small molecules: one in shorter wavelength region (350–400 nm) and the other peaks at 574 and 624 nm for CSDPP1 and at 526 nm and 566 nm for CSDPP3 at longer wavelength region corresponds to the characteristic peaks for DPP-based oligomers. Benefited from their D–A molecular structure with thiophene bridge the absorption spectra of the compounds in CF solution exhibit a strong and broad absorption band in the wavelength range from 450–650 and 450–610 nm for CSDPP1 and CSDPP3, respectively. The absorption peak corresponds to 320–350 nm can be assigned to the π–π* absorption of the molecule while the absorption peak observed in longer wavelength region attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition from the electron donating units i.e. indole and 2,4,6-triisopropyl phenyl in CSDPP1 and CSDPP3, respectively to electron accepting DPP unit. The optical properties of CSDPP1 and CSDPP3 are shown in Table 1. The maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) and absorption edge of CSDPP1 are red-shifted as compared to CSDPP3 in solution attributed the more ICT in CSDPP1 due the stronger donor nature of indole as compared to 2,4,6-triisopropyl phenyl. Their absorption edges in solution extend to 670 nm and 625 nm for CSDPP1 and CSDPP3, respectively. These results indicate that using electron donor i.e. indole in CSDPP1 is beneficial to enhancing the absorption coefficient of the compound.

In thin films the absorption spectra of the DPP small molecules are significantly broadened and red-shifted by ca. 25 nm and 20 nm, for CSDPP1 and CSDPP3, respectively in comparison with their solutions. The absorption edges of CSDPP1 and CSDPP3 are at ca. 705 nm and 655 nm, respectively, corresponding to optical band gaps (Eoptg) 1.76 eV and 1.89 eV, respectively. The Eoptg of CSDPP3 is significantly larger than that of CSDPP1. In D–A type SMs based on push pull structure, the LUMO energy level is controlled by electron acceptor unit, while the HOMO energy level is governed by the electron donor unit. Since in both the SMs, the electron acceptor is DPP unit, it is expected that the LUMO levels of both the SM are almost same, where as the HOMO energy level are different because of the different electron donating unit in SMs. The CSDPP3 has deeper HOMO energy level and thus larger band gap, due to the electron donating ability of 2,4,6-triisopropyl phenyl unit is weaker than indole unit.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the conjugated small molecules can be estimated from the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry.53 A platinum plate coated with thin film of small molecule was used as working electrode. A Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The analysis were performed in an electrolyte (0.1 M Bu4NPF4 in acetonitrile solution) at room temperature with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple as external reference. The HOMO and LUMO level have been deduced from the oxidation and reduction onsets (as shown in Fig. 2) under the assumption that the energy level of Fc is 4.7 eV below vacuum level.54,55 The HOMO level of CSDPP3 (−5.28 eV) is deeper than CSDPP1 (−5.14 eV), while the LUMO level of both small molecules is almost same (−3.20 eV and −3.24 eV for CSDPP1 and CSDPP3, respectively). The electrochemical parameters are listed in Table 1. The electrochemical band gap of CSDPP1 and CSDPP3 estimated from the CV measured were 2.08 eV and 1.94 eV, respectively which is in excellent agreement with that of optical band gap. The electrochemical band gap is higher than that optical band gap. This phenomenon was usually observed for other type of small molecules and polymers.56,57 The deeper value of HOMO level for CSDPP3 than that for CSDPP1 indicates that the substitution of electron donating isopropyl unit on the benzene ring has effect on the decreasing the HOMO energy level which leads to an increase in Voc for BHJ solar cells based on CSDPP3 as compared to CSDPP1.58 The energy level diagram of the CSDPP1 and CSDPP3 along with the PCBM is shown in Fig. 3. The energy levels are well matched with the PC70BM acceptor.59 The LUMO–LUMO offset between the DPP's and PC70BM is about 0.75–0.71 eV, which is higher than the exciton binding energy, therefore the exciton dissociation is feasible in the BHJ active layer using CSDPP's and PC70BM. Moreover, the HOMO levels were in the range −5.28 eV to −5.14 eV, which approximately 0.70 eV high lying than that of PC70BM. As a result, exciton dissociation of PC70BM at the D–A interface is also feasible. The high Voc observed in these devices is attributed to the lower HOMO energy level of the donor molecule which could be beneficial to higher open circuit voltage of organic solar cells.58–61

Hole mobility
The high hole mobility is a basic requirement for effective photovoltaic active donors, to ensure effective charge carrier transport to the electrode and reduce the photocurrent loss in organic solar cells. The hole mobility of the CSDPPs films were measured by space charge current limited (SCLC) method62 with a hole only device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CSDPP1 or CSDPP3/Au. We measured the J–V characteristics of the devices using these two DPP small molecules in dark. First, we had plots the J–V characteristics in the form of logJ vs. logV and confirmed that at the higher voltage region the currents are space charge limited current i.e. slope of logJ vs. logV is about two. Then we draw a straight line based on the data in SCLC region in the plots of ln(JL3/V2) vs. (V/L)1/2 as shown in Fig. 4, for the calculation of hole mobility. The built in potential used for the extraction of hole mobility is 0.34 V. The hole mobilities estimated from the straight lines observed are 5.4 × 10−4 and 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CSDPP1 and CSDPP3, respectively. The hole mobility for the CSDPP1 is higher that that for CSDPP3 and expected to yield higher short circuit photocurrent in the BHJ organic solar cells using former as donor material. The higher mobility of the CSDPP1 than CSDPP3 may be due to the higher crystalline and more ordered structure of CSDPP1 resulting from indole capping. Usually, heteroaromatic compounds (indole) are prone to crystallize faster compared to simple aromatic compounds (phenyl derivatives). Moreover, the hole mobility increases to 8.9 × 10−4 and 5.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CSDPP1 and CSDPP3, respectively, upon the thermal annealing.

Photovoltaic properties
The BHJ organic solar cells were fabricated with a photoactive layer of CSDPP1 or CSDPP3 as donor and PC70BM as acceptor in a configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Al. First, we have performed the optimization of the photovoltaic performance of BHJ organic solar cells using CSDPP1 as donor and PC70BM as acceptor by changing the D–A ratio and found that the best photovoltaic performance is for 1:1 D–A ratio. Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage characteristics of organic BHJ solar cells, under illumination using CSDPP1 and CSDPP3 as donor and PC70BM as acceptor with the D–A ratio 1:1. The photovoltaic parameters i.e. short circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are listed in Table 1. It can be seen from the Table 2 that the CSDPP1 having indole donor unit shows high Jsc and FF resulting higher PCE (3.26%) than that for CSDPP3 (2.42%) which contains the 2,4,6-triisopropyl phenyl donor unit. However, the BHJ solar cell based on CSDPP3 as donor showed higher Voc than that for its CSDPP1 counter part. This may be attributed to the deeper HOMO level of CSDPP3 as compared to CSDPP1 since the Voc in a BHJ organic solar cells is directly proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels of donor and acceptor materials employed in the BHJ active layer. The higher Jsc and FF for the device based on CSDPP1 could be due to the strong and broad absorption band and higher hole mobility for CSDPP1, relative to CSDPP3 (as discussed above), the high molar absorption coefficient and low band gap are beneficial for enhancing the Jsc in organic solar cells.60,63–65

Effect of thermal annealing
The PCE of an organic BHJ solar cells strongly dependent on the morphology of the active layer, in which a suitable length scale of phase separation between the donor and acceptor components as well as continuous short pathways between the electrodes is necessary in order to achieve effective exciton and charge carrier transportation.66,67 Since the BHJ organic solar cell based on CSDPP1:PC70BM shows higher PCE due to the higher value of Jsc, we have only given the detail results on the effect of thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance for the device using CSDPP1:PC70BM (1:1 D–A ratio). The J–V characteristics of the device under illumination are shown in Fig. 5. The device based on CSDPP1:PC70BM (1:1) blend exhibited the PCE of 4.96% with Jsc = 10.82 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.82 and FF = 0.56, after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. The photovoltaic parameters for the device CSDPP3:PC70BM (thermally annealed) are also included in Table 1. Similar increase in PCE has been achieved for the device with CSDPP3:PC70BM on there, there is a slight decrease in the value of Voc after thermal annealing as observed for other organic solar cells.65,68 As seen in the absorption spectra of thermally annealed film (see Fig. 8) the onset edge shifted to lower energy that attributed to slight change in HOMO level of CSDPP1 and causing a slight decrease in the Voc. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the organic solar cells based on the BHJ active layer CSDPP1:PC70BM (D–A ratio 1:1) with and without thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 6. The devices shows broad IPCE spectra from 350 nm to 720 nm, the device based on as cast film shows higher values in the range of 45–34% from 520 nm to 670 nm with a peak value of 65.4% at 625 nm, and the thermal annealing improves the IPCE maximum to 78% at 645 nm along a shoulder of 58% at 694 nm.

For the high performance of BHJ organic solar cell, nanoscale phase separation of active layer is one of the morphological requirements i.e. domain size must be in the range of 10–15 nm, which enables a large interfacial D–A area for exciton dissociation. The morphology of the BHJ active layer was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique in tapping mode. The AFM height images of the BHJ active layer film of CSDPP1:PC70BM (1:1) with and without thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 7. The as cast BHJ film exhibits typical cluster structure with many crystalline domains and smooth surface with root mean square (rms) roughness of 0.85 nm and the domain sizes estimated by the cross section profiles are in the range of 1–5 nm. However, after thermal annealing, the crystalline grains grow up to large size (15–20 nm) and the rms size increase to 1.56 nm. These nanoscale crystalline domains are beneficial for increasing the D–A interfacial area for the exciton dissociation and enhanced PCE of the organic BHJ solar cells.69 The increase in the surface roughness and crystalline grains are attributed to CSDPP1 self organization which is beneficial to ordered structure formation and charge transport in the BHJ active layer thin film.33,70

The morphological changes in the active layer can be coupled with the local electrical polarizations when the donor and acceptor are in excited states.71–73 Fig. 8 shows the optical absorption spectra of CSDPP1:PC70BM blend thin film with and without thermal annealing. It can be seen from this figure that the thermal annealing leads to an increase in the absorption intensity in the range of 530 nm to 720 nm which mainly corresponds to the absorption band of CSDPP1. The absorption coefficient is defined as the probability that an incident photon can be absorbed by a molecule and depends upon the interaction between the incident photon (electromagnetic field) and induced electrical dipole. The enhancement in the absorption coefficient may be due to the stronger electrical polarization in the CSDPP1:PC70BM film, since the stronger electrical polarization can lead to larger dipole as observed in polymer BHJ solar cells.74–78 As observed in the AFM images thermal annealing increased the crystallinity of the CSDPP1 and aggregation of PC70BM molecules and this results in the increase of Jsc of the device. The crystallinity and molecular aggregation can increase the interchain and inter-molecular Coulomb interactions in excited states under photoexcitation and consequently, the Coulomb interaction between the donor and acceptor at the D–A interfaces can increases upon the morphology (domain size in the range of 10–15 nm) of the donor and acceptor interpenetrating networks.

X-ray diffraction studies clearly indicate the enhancement of molecular ordering within the CSDPP1:PC70BM blend as shown in Fig. 9. As cast CSDPP1:PC70BM film only shows a weak broad scattering at 2θ = 6.2°, corresponding to d-spacing 1.42 nm, which originates from very small crystalline domains of CSDPP1. When the blend is annealed at 120 °C for 10 min, the intensity of the peak corresponds to 2θ = 6.2° increase sharply. The size of crystallites in the blend can be estimated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the respective peaks using Scherrer's equation D = (Kλ)/(βcosθ), K is the shape factor normally taken as 0.89, λ is the incident X-ray wavelength, β is the FWHM is radians of XRD peak, and θ is the diffraction angle. The average crystalline size CSDPP1 in the blend increases from 5 nm for as cast film to 12 nm for thermally annealed film. The crystalline size of CSDPP1 after the thermal annealing is comparable to the exciton diffusion length which promotes exciton dissociation more effectively.

To get more information about the change in electrical polarization upon the thermal annealing, we have performed capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement using an impedance analyzer with alternating voltage of 50 mV at 1 KHz in dark as well under illumination. Fig. 10a shows the C–V characteristics of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CSDPP1:PC70BM/Al device before and after thermal annealing. It can be seen from this figure that at zero bias the effective capacitance is about 3.44 and 3.85 nF for the devices before and after thermal annealing, respectively, which indicates that thermal annealing increase the electrical polarization of CSDPP1:PC70BM thin film. As the applied voltage increases from 0 V to 0.5 V, the effective capacitance also increase and after that the capacitance starts to decrease. The increase in capacitance comes from the fact that with the increase of bias in forward region, the effective electric field decreases, since the effective electric field (Eeff) is given by: Eeff = Ebi − Eappl, where Ebi is built in electric field and Eappl is the applied electric field. The reduction in the effective field leads to reduce the electric polarization. It can be seen from Fig. 10a that the rate of change in capacitance with voltage is much higher for thermally annealed device as compared to un-annealed device. This indicates that the electrical polarizability (Δε/E), (where Δε is the change in dielectric constant) of the CSDPP1:PC70BM film is much larger for annealed device as compared to the un-annealed device. The large electrical polarizability corresponds to a lower binding energy of exciton generated in photoactive layer due to the photon absorption. The larger decreasing rate of the capacitance for the thermally annealed device, as compared to un-annealed device also suggests that thermal annealing increases the electrical polarizability of the film.

The C–V characteristics of the devices under illumination, before and after thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 10b. It can be seen from this figure that the difference in capacitance at zero bias between the thermally annealed and un-annealed devices in much large than that observed in dark. In organic solar cells, when the device is illuminated the active layer contains large amount of photogenerated charges, therefore the capacitance difference at the zero bias reflects the generation of photogenerated charge carrier before and after the thermal annealing. The increase in the capacitance at zero bias upon thermal annealing may result in the increased electrical polarization induced by the thermal annealing which contributes to the generation of photogenerated exciton dissociation. Moreover the rate of change in capacitance with respect to applied voltage is higher for thermally annealed device as compared to that for un-annealed device. The photogenerated charges (Qph) under illumination can be determined by the capacitance measurement using following expression:79–811/C2 = 2Veff/εoεQphwhere Veff is the effective voltage, εo and ε are vacuum permittivity and dielectric constant, respectively. As the value of capacitance is higher for annealed device than that for un-annealed device, therefore the value of Qph and its rate of change is higher for former device. The increasing rate of photogenerated charges to applied voltage reflects the charge transport. A larger rate of photogenerated charges to applied field corresponds to the enhanced transport of photogenerated charge carriers when the electrical polarizations in the film are increased by the morphological changes induced upon the thermal annealing. The C–V measurements under the illumination indicates that the increased electrical polarization due to the morphological changes induced by the thermal annealing, play an important role in the transport of the photogenerated charge carrier in the generation of photocurrent.70,82 Moreover, as can be seen from the Fig. 10b that the geometric capacitance in reverse bias is higher for the thermally annealed device than that for un-annealed device indicating an increase in the dielectric constant upon thermal annealing. The increase in dielectric constant is related to enhancement in electric polarization.
It can be seen from the J–V characteristics of the devices and Table 2 that the FF has been improved from 0.48 to 0.56 upon the thermal annealing. It is known that the photogenerated carriers can accumulate in both bulk film and organic/electrode interfaces in organic solar cells.83–85 Therefore, the charge accumulation changes the charge collection and consequently influences the fill factor and PCE of the organic photovoltaic device.86,87 The FF of the device can be described by the change in the photocurrent caused by the decrease of the effective electric field and the charge recombination causes a loss in the FF in organic solar cells.88–91 In organic solar cells, the photogenerated charge carrier can be divided into three parts: transported carriers (mainly accounts for photocurrent), recombined carriers (loss mechanism of charges) and trapped carriers (responsible for charge accumulation). The FF described by the ratio between the transported carriers and accumulated carriers during the J–V measurement when applied voltage is swiped against the built in electric field. The increase in the FF for the thermally annealed device may be resulting from the reduction in the charge recombination in the photoactive layer by improving donor and acceptor morphological networks92–94 as evidenced from the AFM and XRD results.
Conclusions
Two solution processed D–A–D small molecules with a common central diketopyrrolopyrrole acceptor unit and different terminal units indole and 2,4,6 tri-isopropyl phenyl CSDPP1 and CSDPP3, respectively were synthesized. Both the DPPs exhibit broad band absorption and suitable HOMO and LUMO levels which matched with PC70BM for efficient charge transfer. The organic BHJ solar cells based on CSDPP1:PC70BM and CSDPP3:PC70BM cast from chloroform solution exhibit PCE of about 3.26 and 2.42%, respectively. The higher PCE for CSDPP1:PC70BM has been attributed to the more broad band absorption, low optical band gap and higher hole mobility for CSDPP1 as compared to that for CSDPP3. The PCE of the device based on CSDPP1:PC70BM has been enhanced up to 4.96%, when the device was annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. This increase in the PCE has been attributed to mainly higher Jsc and FF. We have demonstrated that the morphological changes upon the thermal annealing can increase the local electrical polarizations of the BHJ active layer in the device, which enhances the optical absorption coefficient, charge generation and their transportation, leading to the increase in both Jsc and FF.
