    , Accepted 19th June 2019First published on 21st June 2019AbstractAntisolvent methods – solvent engineering and a Lewis base adduct approach – are the most used methods to prepare highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These two methods differ only by the ratio between the perovskite (PVSK) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In this study, the difference between these two methods and the effect of relative humidity (rH) on the crystallization process were evaluated by in situ Grazing-Incidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (in situ GIWAXS) using synchrotron radiation. The technique was applied to the first stages of formation of formamidinium-based perovskite films, under real preparation conditions of spin coating, and at different humidity conditions and time windows to inject the antisolvent. The higher amount of DMSO in the solvent engineering method prolongs the duration of the colloidal gel, which extends the time window for antisolvent injection and, as a consequence, facilitates obtaining films with a homogeneous morphology. Our results confirm that the formation of a cesium/formamidinium-based perovskite takes place through the conversion of 2H–4H hexagonal polytypes directly to a black perovskite without thermal annealing, independent of the rH or method employed. In contrast, a cesium-free, methylammonium/formamidinium-based perovskite follows the 2H–4H–6H polytype sequence. Interestingly, at higher amounts of DMSO and rH (40%), a pure iodide intermediate (MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO) is formed in the cesium-free perovskite, which is undesirable in mixed halide perovskites. Our findings shed new light on the complexity of PVSK film formation, by identifying all crystalline phases in the process, and give clues to manage the composition and environment during film processing, and thus have an impact on efficiency optimization and solar cell manufacturing.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) are currently some of the most promising photovoltaic materials to produce high-efficiency, low-cost solar cells. Such importance comes from the excellent optoelectronic properties of these materials combined with a low-cost, solution-process and low-temperature manufacturing.1–4 The current certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) record is 24.2%, which is close to the 26.1% reported for monocrystalline silicon solar cells that dominate the current market.5 OIHPs are generally labelled ABX3 compounds, where A is a monovalent cation such as methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+), formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2+), or caesium (Cs+); B is a divalent metal, such as lead (Pb2+) or tin (Sn2+); and X is a halide anion, such as bromide (Br−) or iodide (I−). Besides the single junction, tandem solar cells are an interesting way to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit. Recently, silicon–perovskite, CIGS–perovskite and all-perovskite tandem solar cells have been studied to improve the efficiency.6–8 In these cases, perovskite bandgap adjustment is crucial to photocurrent optimization and high efficiency. Thus, CsyFA1−yPb(IxBr1−x)3 and MAyFA1−yPb(IxBr1−x)3 are promising candidates due to bandgap tailoring by controlling Cs, MA and FA compositions at the A-site, and Br− and I− compositions at the X-site.9,10 The replacement of I− by Br− increases the bandgap of the perovskite and the composition Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 has been successfully applied in perovskite/silicon and all-perovskite tandem solar cells.11,12
The most used method to prepare high quality perovskite films is the one-step approach using an antisolvent. Seok's group introduced the solvent engineering method, which is based on the dissolution of perovskite precursors in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (4:1, v/v).13 During the spin coating process, an antisolvent (toluene and chlorobenzene) is dripped on the sample to remove the excess solvent and freeze the intermediate MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO,14 which is then converted to a black phase perovskite by thermal annealing. Our group has also reported that depending on the preparation conditions, this intermediate or the black phase perovskite is preferably formed.15 Another similar approach introduced by Nam-Gyu Park's group is the Lewis base adduct method.16 In this methodology equimolar amounts of DMSO and Pb are introduced in the solution and the excess solvent is also removed by an antisolvent. The main difference between these two methods is the ratio between the perovskite (PVSK) and DMSO. The solvent engineering method results in a PVSK:DMSO ratio of 1:2 (considering 1.2 M perovskite concentration) while for the Lewis base adduct method, the ratio is 1:1. Both methods yield high-quality films, and the devices made with them attain high PCE.16–20 However, the influence of the PVSK:DMSO ratio on the film formation, as well as its final morphology is not well understood. In situ measurement during the spin coating step is one of the best methods to monitor the formation of intermediates, hexagonal polytypes (2H or γ-yellow phase, 4H and 6H), and the black phase before and after antisolvent dripping. The influence of perovskite composition and the difference between the spin coating and blade-coating methods have been studied by in situ GIWAXS for MAPbI3.21–24 However, regarding CsFA-based perovskites and the antisolvent method, this type of investigation is lacking in the literature. For the first time, in situ time-resolved grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements have been carried out during spin coating to monitor the formation of perovskite films based on CsFA and MAFA by the antisolvent method. Our results reveal that perovskite film formation is complex, involving the formation of intermediates and undesirable phases, which depends on the relative humidity, PVSK:DMSO ratio and time to inject the antisolvent. All these factors have important impacts on the type of intermediate/phase formed and influence directly the final morphology. Under conditions with higher amounts of DMSO, the duration of the colloidal gel during spin coating is increased. The presence of the gel at the time when the antisolvent is injected is crucial to obtain a homogeneous morphology. For CsFA perovskites, immediately after the antisolvent injection, we observed the conversion of the hexagonal phases (2H and 4H) to perovskite without thermal annealing, independent of the rH and PVSK:DMSO ratio. This formation mechanism is distinct in comparison to MAFA perovskites, where the sequence is 2H–4H–6H, and thermal annealing is required for black phase perovskite formation. Interestingly, for MAFA perovskites, our results show that for the ratio of 1:2 under high rH conditions (40%), the intermediate MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO is formed after injection of the antisolvent. This may have consequences in the formation of iodide rich regions.
Experimental
Solution preparation
CsFA (Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3) and MAFA (MA0.17FA0.83Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3) solutions were prepared by dissolution of the precursor salts (CsI, FAI, MABr, PbI2 and PbBr2) in a mixture of DMF and DMSO. One solution was prepared with a molar ratio of 1:1 (Lewis base adduct) between the perovskite and DMSO (PVSK:DMSO). The second solution was prepared with a DMF:DMSO ratio of 4:1 (v/v) which corresponds to about 1:2 (PVSK:DMSO) (solvent engineering). The perovskite concentration was 1.2 M for both solutions. The solutions were left to stir overnight inside a glovebox filled with N2 prior to in situ measurements.
Characterization – in situ GIWAXS

In situ GIWAXS measurements were performed at the XRD2 beamline at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). The energy of the X-ray was 7 keV and the scattering signal was collected using a Pilatus 300K detector with an integration time of 1 s. The incident angle of the X-ray beam relative to the film surface was set at 3°. The experiments were carried out in a custom-built acrylic chamber specially designed to fit the spin coater (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The antisolvent (200 μL of chlorobenzene) injection was carried out using an automatic syringe coupled to a hose. The spin coater and syringe were controlled from the computer outside the beamline hutch. The moisture was controlled through N2 purge onto the chamber and the relative humidity (rH) was monitored using a sensor placed few inches from the sample.
Characterization – SEM and XRD
SEM images were obtained on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM, 6360LV, JEOL) at an acceleration voltage of 10 keV. High-resolution X-ray diffraction measurements were performed in a θ–2θ configuration at the XRD2 beamline at the LNLS, using an energy of 7 keV.
Device preparation
FTO-coated glass was cleaned in freshly prepared piranha solution composed of five parts of concentrated H2SO4 and two parts of H2O2 (30%). The substrates were soaked in the piranha solution for 10 minutes and then rinsed, first in water, then in isopropanol and dried in a N2 flow. They were thereafter treated in a UV-ozone cleaner for 30 minutes. A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited by spin coating a 0.15 M solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% isopropanol, Aldrich) in 1-butanol at 700 rpm for 8 s, 1000 rpm for 10 s and 2000 rpm for 40 s, then dried at 125 °C for 5 min in a hot plate. To prepare a mesoporous TiO2 layer, 30 NR-D Dyesol TiO2 paste was diluted to 150 mg per milliliter of absolute ethanol. The resulting dispersion was left under vigorous stirring overnight before use. The TiO2 solution was spin coated on the substrates using a speed of 4000 rpm and an acceleration of 200 rpm s−1 for 10 s. Immediately after this step, the film was dried at 100 °C for a few minutes. Subsequently, the TiO2 was sintered at 500 °C for 30 minutes, cooled to 150 °C, and then transferred to a glovebox.
The deposition of the perovskite layer was carried out by spin coating in a glovebox filled with air and N2. The relative humidity was controlled by a flow of air and N2 and monitored during all the preparation. The deposition was carried out with the same parameters used for the in situ measurements. The samples were prepared and thermally annealed at 100 °C in a hot plate for 10 minutes (30 minutes for MAFA samples) at the same rH of film preparation.
A solution of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was prepared by dissolving 85 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 20 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) salt in acetonitrile (500 mg mL−1) and 33 μL of tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. 30 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution was statically dispersed onto the substrate and then spin coated at 2000 rpm for 45 s. After that, part of the FTO layer was exposed by scratching the perovskite and spiro layers. This is necessary to deposit the gold contact. Before gold deposition, the samples were left overnight in the dark and under dry air (desiccator). The gold layer was deposited in a two-step process: the first 2 nm at 0.2 Å s−1 and then 1.2 Å s−1 up to 60 nm in a vacuum evaporator.
Solar cell characterization
The J–V curves of the perovskite solar cells were analysed using a Keithley 2400 source meter inside a glovebox at room temperature. The illumination intensity was set to 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G, Sciencetech Class AAA simulator) calibrated with a KG5 filtered silicon reference cell. The J–V curves were obtained in forward and backward modes with a step of 10 mV and delay time of 0.25 s.
Results and discussion
We chose to investigate CsFA (Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3) and MAFA (MA0.17FA0.83Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3) perovskites due to their better stability and successful application in single and tandem solar cells.11Fig. 1 shows the schematic representation of the in situ time-resolved grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements carried out during the spin coating step. After the spin coater reached its maximum speed, the antisolvent was injected at different times. Each GIWAXS image was azimuthally integrated to obtain 1D X-ray diffraction patterns and plotted as 2D intensity maps (Fig. 1) with respect to time (abscissa) and the scattering vector q (ordinate). q is equal to 4πsinθ/λ where θ denotes the half of the total scattering angle (2θ in Fig. 1) and λ is the wavelength of the X-ray used in the experiment. The intensity was normalized with the storage ring current.

Effect of relative humidity without antisolvent
It is well known that rH influences drastically the perovskite film formation.25,26 To get more insights on the rH effect, we first performed the measurements under different rH conditions without antisolvent dripping. In the CsFA perovskite without the antisolvent, black phase perovskite formation is expected to occur after removal of the solvent by rotation of the substrate. Fig. 2 shows the results for the CsFA composition under different rH (3–5%, 20% and 40%) conditions. At the early stages, the excess solution is cast off the substrate and a film composed of perovskite precursors (CsI, FAI, PbBr2 and PbI2) and solvents (DMSO and DMF) is formed. After that, the solvent is dried by rotation of the substrate. In these experiments we used a two-step spin coating process, with the first step at 1000 rpm for 10 s and the second step at 4000 rpm for a prolonged time; these conditions are those used to prepare efficient PSCs.9,20 During the first step, we observed a broad scattering signal at low q (3–6 nm−1) attributed to a disordered precursor colloidal sol–gel formed between perovskite precursors and solvents,21–24 which does not change significantly with time. However, when increasing the speed to 4000 rpm, the signal becomes sharper (4–7 nm−1), due to solvent drying until its disappearance.

(g, h and i) 1D XDR plots from the regions marked with coloured dotted lines in (a), (b) and (c). 
The first difference between the two PVSK:DMSO ratios (1:1 and 1:2) is the duration of the signal related to the colloidal gel, which is longer for the ratio with more DMSO (1:2). A plausible explanation is that DMSO has lower vapor pressure and higher coordination affinity to PbI2 than DMF; thus DMSO is expected to evaporate at a slower rate, remaining for a longer duration in the film.15
It is also important to note that the presence of moisture reduces the gel duration for both ratios. The colloidal gel disappears in ca. 35, 30 and 20 s (rH of 3–5, 20 and 40%, respectively) for the ratio 1:1 and 110, 90 and 80 s for the ratio 1:2. Previous reports on DMSO–water interactions27–29 showed that the strong H-bonding between the oxygen lone pair of DMSO and water leads to multiple stable species. During the spin coating, water from the ambient environment can interact with DMSO creating a competition with DMSO–Pb coordination. Thus, the increase in water content contributes to dissolving the precursor gel.
For the ratio 1:1 and at 3–5% rH (Fig. 2a), after the disappearance of the signal assigned to a colloidal gel, a sharp diffraction peak emerges at q = 9.8 nm−1, attributed to the perovskite black phase. The intensity of this signal increases with time. Furthermore, the peaks observed at 8.2 and 9.2 nm−1 are attributed to 4H, and the peak at 8.4 nm−1 to 2H hexagonal polytypes (HPs) (as shown in the 1D data in Fig. 2g). The HP phases are formed by BX6 corner-sharing octahedra with increased complexity in the sequence 2H–4H–6H.30 At 20% rH (Fig. 2b) new peaks emerge at q = 3.6, 5.3 and 6.1 nm−1. These peaks do not match with PbI2·2DMSO, PbI2·DMSO, PbI2·DMF, Pb3I8 or PbI5 structures,31 indicating that they might have contributions of Cs and FA. We attributed these peaks to a (CsI)·(FAI)·(PbBr2)·(PbI2)·(DMSO) intermediate, similar to the intermediate formed between MAPbI3 and DMSO (MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO).14 To better separate the peaks between 8 and 10 nm−1 we fitted this region with Gaussian functions as shown in Fig. 2h. The fitting reveals the presence of four peaks attributed to the same phases observed at 3–5% rH, however, with a sensibly weaker perovskite peak. At 40% rH (Fig. 2c) the more pronounced peaks are those assigned to the same intermediate observed at 20% rH and those from 4H, perovskite and FAPbI3 (ref. 32) with smaller intensity (Fig. 2i). We conclude that for the 1:1 ratio (without the antisolvent), the black phase perovskite is only formed at low humidity levels (3–5%). The complexity of the structures formed increases with the increase in the humidity level, and the peaks assigned to the hexagonal phases and intermediates are more intense at 40% rH.
As pointed out before, for the 1:2 ratio, more DMSO in the precursor solution prolongs the duration of the colloidal gel signal, and thus the appearance of the hexagonal phases and intermediates (when observed) is delayed in comparison to the case of 1:1 ratio (Fig. 2d–f). The scattering behaviour of the 1:2 sample presents similar features in comparison to that of the 1:1 sample. For instance, the structural complexity in the scattering data increases with the increase in the humidity level, with the sample at 40% rH exhibiting a complex mixture of hexagonal polytypes and intermediates. The signal related to the perovskite phase appears at 3–5% and 20% rH. This signal is weak at low rH and not found at 40% rH. Interestingly, although all conditions show the formation of hexagonal polytypes, intermediates are only observed at 40% rH level. This allows us to conclude that the presence of water for both ratios is a necessary condition to form the intermediate phases, and the formation of such intermediates is preferred over the formation of the black phase perovskite. Table S1† summarizes the structures obtained under the conditions of non-addition of chlorobenzene.
Effect of time delay to drip the antisolvent
In these preparation methods, the time delay of the antisolvent injection is crucial to the final properties of the films and, consequently, to the performance of the devices. Thus, we varied the time delay of the antisolvent drip (1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 60 s) at a fixed humidity level of 20%.
The scatter maps for both 1:1 and 1:2 ratios and the respective SEM images under all conditions are displayed in Fig. S2, S3 and S4,† respectively. Fig. 3 shows the scatter map of the perovskite film obtained with solvent dripping at 15 s and 60 s, and the insets exhibit the corresponding SEM images after thermal annealing.

(a and b) Scatter maps with antisolvent injection at 15 and 60 s, respectively, for the ratio of 1:1. (c) XRD pattern at 5 s after antisolvent injection, and (d) evolution of the peaks at q = 8.2 and 9.8 nm−1, marked in (a). (e) XRD pattern at 130 s marked in (b). (f and g) Maps for the 1:2 ratio with injection at 15 and 60 s, respectively. SEM images of the perovskites films were obtained after thermal annealing. 
Considering the PVSK:DMSO ratio of 1:1, from 1 to 20 s the scatter plots are similar as well as the morphology. As observed for the conditions without the antisolvent injection, a broad scattering signal is observed initially, corresponding to a colloidal gel composed of perovskite precursors. Immediately after the antisolvent injection, diffraction peaks emerge (Fig. 3a). To obtain a clear distinction between them, we fitted the region from 7 to 11 nm−1 and we observed four peaks attributed to 4H (q = 8.2 and 9.4 nm−1), 2H (q = 8.3 nm−1) and the black phase perovskite (q = 9.8 nm−1) (Fig. 3c). The peak centred at q = 8.2 nm−1 (4H) fades away while the peak related to the perovskite (q = 9.8 nm−1) becomes more intense (Fig. 3d). This behaviour is accompanied by a colour change from yellow to dark brown, characteristic of the formation of the perovskite phase. These results reveal that CsFA perovskite formation takes place without thermal annealing and occurs through the conversion from 2H–4H phases. This dynamic is distinct from the MA-based compositions where an intermediate phase is formed and the tetragonal phase is only attained after heating.13–15 The SEM image (Fig. 3a, bottom right) of the film reveals grains in the range of 200–900 nm homogeneously distributed without pinholes. On the other hand, the scatter map and film morphology are different when the injection is done at 60 s (Fig. 3b). When the injection of the antisolvent takes place, the 2H and 4H have already been formed and remain even after the dripping of the antisolvent, as shown in the XRD pattern in Fig. 3e. In this case, the colloidal gel was no longer present at the time of antisolvent injection. The morphology of the film is heterogeneous with pinholes (Fig. 3b, bottom right), which can lead to undesirable contact between semiconductor layers, and, consequently, reduce device's performance.
When increasing the amount of DMSO in the solution (PVSK:DMSO, 1:2), all injection conditions present similar scatter maps (see Fig. S3†) between them and in comparison to the case of 1:1 ratio (between 1 and 20 s). Following the same trend, no intermediate phases were detected, which means that independent of the PVSK:DMSO ratio, the role of the antisolvent is indeed to remove the excess DMSO. In addition, all films present a similar and homogeneous morphology even for antisolvent injection at 60 s(Fig. S4b†). Fig. 3f and g show the scatter maps for the antisolvent drip at 15 and 60 s. Under these conditions, the colloidal gel is still present when the anti-solvent is injected, in contrast to the 60 s conditions for the ratio of 1:1. This indicates that the presence of the colloidal gel, at the time when the antisolvent is injected, is crucial to obtain a homogeneous morphology at 20% rH. Besides, more DMSO allows expansion of the time window to inject the anti-solvent.
Films prepared at 20% rH were also characterized by high-resolution X-ray diffraction to verify the phases formed after thermal annealing. The XRD patterns (Fig. S5†) reveal the presence of the black phase perovskite and a small amount of PbI2 for all conditions, independent of the PVSK:DMSO ratio. No signals from 2H, 4H and 6H HPs were identified, except for the film prepared with a 1:1 PVSK:DMSO ratio with antisolvent injection at 60 s. Peaks from the orthorhombic γ-CsPbI3 are also observed for the ratio of 1:2 from 1 to 15 s of antisolvent drip. Differently from PbI2, which improves the PCE of the PSCs,33,34 the γ-CsPbI3 and HP are undesirable due to their higher bandgap and poorer light absorption, which reduce the device performance.
Effect of relative humidity on the perovskite formation using antisolvent
As previously shown (Fig. 2), different humidity conditions have an impact on the formation of intermediates and hexagonal phases. In this section, we describe the formation of the perovskite films carried out under low (3–5%) and high (40%) rH conditions to match the glovebox and ambient conditions, respectively.
As we are interested in knowing how the PVSK:DMSO ratio affects both the morphology and composition, we compared films obtained with the same time of antisolvent injection (15 s). At 15 s, the colloidal gel is still present under all conditions investigated here. This is important because we can rule out any adverse effect that may occur because of the absence of this initial condition. Fig. 4a–d show the scatter maps for both PVSK:DMSO proportions. To get more insights into the role of preparation conditions, all samples were annealed before X-ray diffraction characterization. Their X-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 4e. Table S2† summarizes the phase content before and after thermal annealing.

Scatter maps for 1:1 and 1:2 ratios, respectively, at (a and b) 3–5% rH and (c and d) 40% rH. SEM images of the perovskite films were obtained after thermal annealing. (e) X-ray diffraction patterns after thermal annealing. (f) Evolution of the perovskite peak at q = 10 nm−1 for the ratio of 1:1 under different rH conditions. 
The scatter maps (Fig. 4a–d) reveal similar behaviour for all the conditions. After antisolvent drip, the peaks from the HP and perovskite differ only in intensity. It is clear that moisture accelerates the perovskite formation (Fig. 4f), resulting in films with larger grains due to lower nucleation and faster grain growth. The condition of low rH (3–5%) gives rise to films with good crystallinity, morphology, and with minimal amounts of PbI2 and hexagonal phases for both 1:1 and 1:2 ratios (Fig. 4e). The X-ray diffraction pattern from the sample with 1:2 ratio (40% rH) obtained after thermal annealing is more complex presenting peaks assigned to the polytype 4H, γ-CsPbI3, PbI2, and black-phase perovskite (Fig. 4e). In contrast, for the ratio of 1:1 at the same rH, the X-ray diffraction pattern presents peaks from the black phase perovskite with a discrete amount of PbI2. It is expected that moisture induces the formation of the HP and y-CsPbI3 phases.35 Thus, owing to the water–DMSO interaction, more DMSO increases the water absorption by the film during spin coating, leading to the formation of undesirable phases. Our results indicate that if there is a preference for deposition of perovskite films under ambient conditions, the method with the lowest amount of DMSO should be used.
Caesium free perovskite film formation
Turning our attention to the formation of formamidinium-based perovskites, we also performed in situ measurements for the composition MA0.17FA0.83Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 (MAFA), without caesium. This composition has also been used in efficient PSCs.9,34Fig. 5a and b show the scatter maps for the MAFA (ratio of 1:1) perovskite without antisolvent and prepared at 3–5 and 40% rH, respectively. Unlike CsFA perovskites, peaks from the intermediate emerge (q = 4.7, 5.1 and 6.6 nm−1) at low rH (3–5%) (Fig. 5a and g). This intermediate has a known structure (MA2Pb3I8 2DMSO) and it is formed without and with antisolvent injection in MAPbI3 preparation.13,14,36 These peaks become more intense at higher rH following the same trend of the CsFA perovskite. Besides, peaks from HP phases (2H, 4H and 6H) were also identified. It is interesting to note that the intensity of the peaks of HP phases decreases at higher rH (Fig. 5g, red line), in contrast to the case of CsFA as shown previously. Immediately after antisolvent injection, peaks from 2H and 4H emerge and they are converted to 6H during the spin coating process (Fig. 5c and d); this behaviour is more evident at higher rH (Fig. 5h). The peaks corresponding to the black phase perovskite are not identified at this point, confirming that a heat treatment is required to obtain the perovskite active phase. Interestingly, the intensity of the peak assigned to MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO also increases with time (Fig. 5i) and it is independent from the hexagonal phase conversion.

(g–j) XRD patterns marked with coloured dotted lines in the scatter maps. 
For the ratio 1:2 without antisolvent, the colloidal gel persists for a longer time under both rH conditions as previously discussed (Fig. S7†). When injecting the antisolvent at low rH (Fig. 5e), the behaviour was similar to that for the 1:1 ratio, peaks from 2H and 4H emerge and they are converted to 6H. At higher rH (Fig. 5f), however, peaks from MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO emerge (Fig. 5j, at 120 s). This is the only condition using the antisolvent method where we observe the formation of the intermediate MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO. We speculate that the combination of water + DMSO is responsible for this behaviour.
The XRD patterns after thermal annealing (Fig. S6†) reveal the formation of the perovskite phase under all conditions at low rH with small peaks from 4H and PbI2. At higher rH, the peaks from the perovskite are present; however, those from 4H, 6H and PbI2 become more intense, revealing incomplete perovskite formation. We conclude that for compositions without Cs (MAFA), low rH is fundamental to obtain the perovskite without undesirable phases, unlike CsFA which can be prepared at moderate levels of rH.
Device performance
To evaluate the effect of preparation conditions on the performance of the CsFA perovskite, we fabricated n–i–p perovskite solar cells (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au). The PCE and photovoltaic parameters of the devices are shown in Fig. S8 and Table S3,† respectively. The results revealed a similar performance for the two PVSK:DSMO ratios at 3–5% and 20% rH. After 15 s delay, for the 1:1 ratio, an average PCE of 11.20 ± 0.99% and 11.25 ± 0.78% were obtained at 3–5% and 20% rH, respectively. For the 1:2 ratio, the average PCE slightly increased from 9.82 ± 1.0% to 11.93 ± 0.71%. As expected, the devices prepared at higher rH exhibit smaller PCEs (5.54 ± 1.8% and 6.52 ± 1.2% for 1:1 and 1:2 ratios, respectively) due to the heterogeneous morphology of the films and formation of undesirable phases. Wang et al.37 reported similar behaviour with a heterogeneous morphology at high levels of humidity. In their case, the efficiency was improved by heating the substrate during the deposition and replacing chlorobenzene with diethyl ether. We should point out that to obtain high efficiency perovskite solar cells not only a high quality of perovskite films but also rigorous optimization of the TiO2 layer, spiro-OMeTAD and high-quality chemicals are necessary. However, the focus of this work was not on the device performance but on the understanding of the crystalline phases formed during the spin coating process, thus we did not perform further optimization of the devices.
The important point here is that besides the similar PCEs for both ratios, higher amounts of DMSO (ratio of 1:2) allow the assembly of devices with optimum performance with a wider window for anti-solvent dripping (Fig. S8†). This is clearly seen at 20% rH, where the PCE is rather stable for the 1:2 ratio, from 11.93 ± 0.71%, at 15 s, to 10.61 ± 1.2%, at 60 s delay, while for the 1:1 ratio it decays from 11.25 ± 0.78% down to 5.58 ± 0.18%. The efficiency is slightly lower for devices prepared at low rH (3–5%) in comparison to those prepared at 20% rH, in agreement with several reports in the literature which reveal that the best devices are those assembled under moderate humidity conditions.38–40
Summary, conclusions, and further outlook
The formation of perovskite films, following two different antisolvent routes (PVSK:DMSO ratios of 1:1 and 1:2) and for two hybrid perovskite compositions (CsFA and MAFA), has been investigated by in situ GIWAXS under real preparation conditions of spin coating, exploring relative humidity (rH) levels and the time window for antisolvent dripping.
First, without antisolvent drip, we observed the formation of an intermediate phase between the perovskite and solvent once the colloidal gel disappears. For the CsFA perovskite, the intermediate phases emerge at 20% and 40% rH, for the ratio of 1:1, and only at 40% rH, for the ratio of 1:2. For the MAFA perovskite the intermediate, identified as MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO, emerges at low and high rH, for the ratio of 1:1, and only at 40% rH for the 1:2 ratio. There is a clear connection between the formation of intermediates and moisture. The formation of the pure MA iodide intermediate phase in the FA-based perovskite is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations including the interactions between DMSO, MA and FA.41 The energy is stronger for MA–DMSO than for FA–DMSO formation, stabilizing the MA intermediate, which occurs even at low rH, in contrast to CsFA for which it is necessary that at least 20% rH is present to form a similar intermediate. We learned also from these antisolvent-free experiments that the role of the PVSK:DMSO ratio is to slow down the whole process from the 1:1 to the 1:2 ratio.
Using chlorobenzene as an antisolvent leads to distinct behaviours. Fig. 6 summarizes the most relevant insights gleaned so far into the formamidinium-based perovskites under conditions like those used by the perovskite community (antisolvent injection at 15 s). The presence of the colloidal gel at the time of the antisolvent injection is crucial to obtain films with a good morphology, but does not necessarily lead to good structural quality. For all the conditions reported here, the antisolvent removes the colloidal gel and, soon after the injection, new phases emerge. Gratia el al.30 reported the formation of a CsMAFA perovskite without hexagonal polytypes in perovskite films after the spin coating. However, our results show that CsFA perovskite formation takes place through the 2H–4H–perovskite phases without any evidence of the 6H and PVSK–DMSO intermediate formation during the process. A similar conclusion has been recently reported by Qin et al.42 at the time of our manuscript submission. Our findings are more general and independent of the PVSK:DMSO ratio and relative humidity (rH). Interestingly, our results also reveal a relationship between higher amounts of DMSO and water absorption, which leads to the formation of undesirable phases in some circumstances. On the one hand, the higher the DMSO amount the larger the time window to inject the antisolvent and, on the other hand, the larger the water uptake, preventing good quality samples under moderate humidity conditions.
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of CsFA and MAFA formation during spin coating for different PSVK:DMSO ratios and rH. The intersections between arrows and structures represent the phases formed during the spin coating step up to perovskite formation. 
As previously reported,30 for MAFA the formation sequence is 2H–4H–6H phases, even at low rH and both PVSK:DMSO ratios. Soon after the antisolvent injection, 2H and 4H phases dominate, but are rapidly converted to the 6H phase. In this case, no peaks from the perovskite are observed without thermal annealing and, consequently, heating is necessary to complete perovskite formation and crystallization. Interestingly, only at high rH (40%) and 1:2 ratio, the MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO intermediate is formed along with the 6H phase. This intermediate phase is a pure I compound while the desirable perovskite is a mixture of Br and I. When this intermediate loses DMSO, it is converted to a MAPbI3 perovskite, and to exchange Br and I ions, higher temperature or prolonged annealing is necessary, which can result in perovskite degradation.30,43 Besides that, iodide rich regions can be a seed to halide segregation.44
Our results reveal that the perovskite formation during spin coating is a complex process that depends on the antisolvent method, relative humidity and composition. The CsFA-based perovskite is more appropriate for future large-scale applications owing to its robustness to environmental preparation conditions. The current study clarifies the perovskite formation paths during the spin coating preparation and may guide the PSC community to choose the best parameters to achieve films with high standards of morphology and structure.
