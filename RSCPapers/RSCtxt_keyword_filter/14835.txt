    , Accepted 29th September 2011First published on 25th November 2011AbstractIn this work, the photosensitizing properties of ferrocene (Fc)-based compounds FcCH2CS3CH2Fc (1) and FcCH2SSCH2Fc (2) were investigated and significant enhancement in the light harvesting efficiency was observed compared to those achieved with previously reported compounds from our lab. The compounds were fully characterized by spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and their electrochemical properties studied. DSSCs based on these dyes display efficiencies comparable to those of a standard cell based on N719 under similar experimental conditions. These studies demonstrate that ferrocenyl-based sulfur rich compounds with proper orientation of the Fc groups assisted via suitable linkers, together with desired redox properties and visible region electronic absorption features could constitute a new class of photosensitizers targeting light driven reactions.
Introduction
Renewable solar energy is widely considered as a viable source of energy in the event of depleting fossil fuels in the near future. But there are many practical problems that have to be solved before the fabrication of a cheap and efficient dye sensitized photovoltaic cell becomes practically feasible for harvesting solar energy. The development of solar cells that are based on the sensitization of TiO2 semiconductor films by inorganic complex dyes, which are inexpensive, stable and eco-friendly, has achieved significant advances in recent years. The use of Ru(II) polypyridyl and its substituted derivatives as sensitizers in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with the highest conversion efficiencies reported so far1 has revolutionized the work in this area. The conversion efficiencies of some π conjugated metallophthalocyanins (MPcs) have been studied and attempts have been made to enhance their efficiencies by structural modifications of the functional groups in these complexes.2
Metal dithio complexes, including those of ferrocenyl-based sulfur ligand compounds, are of immense interest because of their exciting electrical conductivity, electrochemical, magnetic, chemical sensing, ion or molecule recognition, optoelectronic and light harvesting properties.3–5 Encouraged by the results reported in our previous publications5d,5e on the conversion efficiencies of some transition metal ferrocenyl dithiocarbamates, we became interested in the synthesis of the corresponding xanthate complexes, but serendipitously this led to the formation of the compounds Fc–CH2CS3CH2–Fc (1) and Fc–CH2SSCH2–Fc (2), especially in the presence of Cd(II) and Hg(II) salts, respectively. We herein report the synthesis, single crystal X-ray structures and light harvesting properties of both 1 and 2; strikingly enhanced conversion efficiencies were observed for these compounds.
Experimental
Materials
All starting chemicals were reagent grade and purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. All reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere and cold conditions. Solvents used in the reactions and experimental measurements were purified and dried by standard procedures. Anhydrous NaClO4 (Purum, Fluka) was used as the supporting electrolyte, LiI (Aldrich) and I2 (BDH) were taken as the redox couple in the cell electrolyte. Titanium paste (HT) was used for preparing the TiO2 electrode. A platinum catalyst (T/SP) for the counter electrode and the sealing agent (SX1170-60, 50 μm) were obtained from Solaronix.
Synthesis of FcCH2CS3CH2Fc, (1)
To a stirring solution of ferrocenylmethyl alcohol (0.216 g, 1 mmol) in 30 ml THF:CH3CN (1:2, v/v), sodium hydride (0.024 g, 1 mmol) was added under cold conditions. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h followed by the addition of CS2 (0.121 ml, 2 mmol). To this reaction mixture, solid Cd (OAc)2·2H2O (0.133 g, 0.5 mmol) was added after 1 h and stirred overnight. The reddish yellow compound was collected after evaporating the solvent on rotary evaporator and recrystallized from CH2Cl2–hexane solution. The needle-shaped auburn crystals were obtained after about 4 weeks. Yield (0.339 g, 67%); m. p. 190–192 °C.

Synthesis of FcCH2SSCH2Fc, (2)
Compound 2 was synthesized adopting exactly the same procedure as that for 1 using Hg(OAc)2 (0.159 g, 0.5 mmol) in place of Cd (OAc)2·2H2O. The compound was recrystallized from CH2Cl2–hexane to get light yellow needle-shaped crystals. Yield (0.272 g, 60%); m. p. 129–130 °C.

Preparation of TiO2 photoanode and platinum counter electrode
For preparing TiO2 thin film electrodes (photoanodes) a highly transparent paste of TiO2 (titanium-HT, Solaronix) was spread on a conductive glass plate (15 Ω/□, Pilkington, USA) using the doctor's blade method and it was annealed at 450 °C for half an hour in air. The dye was anchored onto the surface of TiO2 thin film by immersing the electrode in a methanol solution of the desired dye for 6 h. Thereafter, it was taken out of the solution and washed with anhydrous ethanol. The platinum counter electrode was prepared by depositing the Pt catalyst (T/SP paste, Solaronix SA) on another conductive glass plate using the screen printing method and annealing it at 400 °C for half an hour in air.
DSSC assembly
The platinum counter electrode was placed over the dye-coated TiO2 electrode and sealed from three sides using a hot melt sealant/spacer (SX1170-60, 50 μm thick, obtained from Solaronix), keeping one side opened for the injection of electrolyte solution. The iodide electrolyte solution (0.1 M lithium iodide and 0.01 M iodine in acetonitrile) was introduced into the space between the electrodes by capillary action. Thereafter, the open side of the cell assembly was also sealed. The lids (copper wires) were attached on the electrode using silver paste, which was finally covered with Araldite and dried.
Physical measurements

IR (KBr pellets) and 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Varian 3100 FTIR and JEOL AL300 FT NMR spectrophotometers respectively. Chemical shifts were quoted in parts per million with TMS as internal standard. Elemental analyses were performed on an Exeter Analytical Incl. “Model CE-440 CHN analyser”. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1700 Pharma Spec spectrophotometer.

          Cyclic voltammograms of both compounds were recorded with the help of a bipotentiostat (Model No. AFRDE 4E, Pine Instrument Company, USA) in conjunction with an e-corder (Model 201, eDAQ, Australia). An Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile) electrode was used as the reference and a platinum disk as the working electrode. The same set of the bipotentiostat and e-corder was also used for all other current–potential measurements.
For photoelectrochemical measurements, a 150 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel Corporation, USA) was used as the light source and the semiconductor electrode was illuminated after passing the light beam through a water column 6 inches in length (to filter IR) and condensing it with the help of fused-silica lenses (Oriel Corporation, USA). The UV part of the IR-filtered light was cut off with the aid of a long-pass filter (Model No. 51280, Oriel Corporation, USA) and the resulting light is referred to as ‘visible light’. The monochromatic light was obtained using a grating monochromator (Oriel Model 77250 equipped with model 7798 grating). The width of the exit slit of the monochromator was kept at 0.5 mm. To obtain the action spectrum (Jphoto–λ) of the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode, the monochromatic light-induced short circuit photocurrent (Jphoto) was measured at each excitation wavelength with the help of a digital multimeter (Philips Model No. 2525). The intensities of incident light were measured using a digital photometer (Tektronix model J16 with model J 6502 sensor) in combination with neutral density filters (model No. 50490–50570, Oriel, USA). The absorption spectra of the dyes in acetonitrile solution were recorded on a Cary 2390 (Varian) spectrophotometer.

Crystal data collection and structure refinement
Reflection data for compounds 1 and 2 were collected with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293(2) K using the Oxford Diffraction X-Calibur CCD system. The final unit cell determination, scaling of the data and correction for Lorentz and polarization effect were performed using the CrysAlis program.6 Absorption corrections were carried out using ABSPACK.7 Both structures were solved by direct methods followed by full-matrix least squares refinement using the (SHELXL97) programs.8Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms were placed onto calculated positions and refined using a riding model. Table 1 contains a summary of the crystallographic details. Figs 1 and 2 depict the crystal structures of 1 and 2 and selected bond lengths and angles of 1 and 2 are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

Results and discussion
Treatment of an in situ generated sodium salt of ferrocenyl methanethiolate formed by the reaction of ferrocenyl carbinol in THF:CH3CN (2:1, v/v), sodium hydride and carbon disulfide with solid Cd(OAc)2·2H2O or Hg(OAc)2 fortuitously led to the formation of a new compound, Fc–CH2CS3CH2–Fc (1), and another compound previously reported by another route,9 but not crystallographically characterized, Fc–CH2SSCH2–Fc (2), in good yield rather than the expected metal xanthates. The possible mechanisms for the formation of 1 and 2 are given in Scheme 1. Needle-shaped auburn colored single crystals of 1 and light yellow crystals of 2 were obtained from a CH2Cl2:hexane solution after about four weeks. Both compounds are air stable and were fully characterized by microanalysis, IR, 1H and 13C NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclicvoltammetry and X-ray crystallography and their light harvesting properties investigated.
 Scheme 1  The suggested mechanism for the formation of compounds 1 and 2. 
In this reaction scheme, ferrocenylmethyl xanthate is formed by the nucleophilic attack of alchoholate on CS2. Because of the greater nucleophilic strength of the sulfur anion over its oxygen analogue and anchimeric effect of the ferrocene nucleus, the C–O bond is cleaved to form IV. Intermediate IV is transformed to ferrocenyl methanethiolate (V) with extrusion of OCS. In situ treatment of V with Cd(OAc)2 ·2H2O resulted in the formation of compound 1, bis(ferrocenylmethyl) trithiocarbonate (VII) with extrusion of CdS, whereas with the Hg(OAc)2, compound 2, bis(ferrocenylmethyl) disulfide (IX)via a free radical mechanism.

Spectroscopy

The IR spectrum of 1 shows a band at 1030 cm−1, characteristic of a ν(CS) vibration of a trithiocarbonate moiety,10 whereas in 2 the ν(C–S) frequency of the linking group –CH2SSCH2– occurs at 812 cm−1. The purity and composition of both compounds were checked by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy; they show sharp 1H NMR resonances that integrate well to the corresponding hydrogens. In the 13C NMR of 1, a resonance at δ 223 ppm corresponds to the CS3 moiety.
X-ray crystallographic study
The X-ray diffraction analysis of 1 reveals that the structure (Fig. 1) is comprised of two ferrocenyl fragments bridged via a dimethyl trithiocarbonate linker. The structure illustrates the relative orientations of the ferrocene units within the molecule with respect to the central CS3 moiety, which is lying on a two-fold axis and is, therefore, planar. The C(12)–S(2) and C(12)–S(1) distances of 1.582(5) Å and 1.740(9) Å are well in agreement with carbon–sulfur double and single bonds, respectively. The geometry of the trithiocarbonate moiety is virtually in conformity with the observed dimensions in trithiocarbonate compounds, [(PPh3)2N][AuCl2(CS3)],10Fc–CH(CH3)–CS3–CH311 and (CH2)2CS3.12 The S(1)–S(1) and S(1A)–S(2) distances of 2.801(5) and 3.104(5) Å are substantially shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of two sulfur atoms, indicating significant intramolecular S⋯S interactions. The S(2)⋯S(2) intermolecular distance of 6.474(2) Å is long, whereas the S(1)⋯S(2) distances of 3.980(6) Å and S(1A)⋯S(2) 3.483(6) show considerable intermolecular association. The dihedral angle between the planes of two ferrocene moieties is 58.89°, whereas that between the planes of CS3 and the ferrocenyl unit is 32.62°.
Compound 2 (Fig. 2) is centrosymmetric and composed of two ferrocenyl units bridged by a dimethyl disulfide group. The S(1) and S(2) atoms of the linker –CH2SSCH2– between the two ferrocenyl groups adopts a bent structure because of the significant deviations in the angles of C(11)–S(2)–S(1) and C(12)–S(1)–S(2) (105.36(11)° and 104.9(11)°) from the normal tetrahedral angle, which come from the lone pair–bond pair and lone pair–lone pair repulsions in the molecule. The S(1)–S(2), C(11)–S(2) and C(12)–S(1) bond distances of 2.0262(13) Å, 1.831(3) Å and 1.830(3) Å are in the range of normal covalent bonds. In this compound, none of the intermolecular S⋯S distances are less than 8 Å, indicating an absence of intermolecular association. The two cyclopentadienyl rings in each of the ferrocenyl groups are eclipsed and coplanar. Each ferrocene fragment is twisted out of the plane S(2)–S(1)–C(12) due to the CH2 linking group.

Electronic absorption spectra

The optical property is the most crucial one for deciding the ability of the compound to act as a good photosensitizer. The absorption spectra of ferrocenyl compounds dissolved in dichloromethane solution (Fig. 3) indicate that they absorb visible light in the range 400–550 nm, which is characteristic of the ferrocene moiety.13 This absorption band is assigned to the d–d transition from the dz2 orbital of Fe with some admixture of the orbitals of cyclopentadienyl ring in these compounds. Additionally, the higher energy absorptions in the region 330–250 nm (not shown in the figure) in both compounds are assigned to charge transfer transitions arising from the –CH2CS3CH2– and –CH2SSCH2– groups attached to ferrocenyl units.
 Fig. 3  
Absorption spectra of ferrocenyl complexes in dichloromethane (1mM). 

Cyclic voltammetry

The electrochemical redox behavior of the test compounds was studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) at the Pt electrode in dichloromethane solution (1mM) containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte. The voltammograms obtained in a potential range of −0.5 to 1.0 V at different scan rates are shown in Fig. 4 and the electrochemical parameters derived from these voltammograms (Ep,a, Ep,c, ΔEp and E°′) are given in Table 4. It is to be noted that the peak potential separation (ΔEp = Ep,a − Ep,c) is larger than the expected value for one electron transfer process (∼60 mV) for both of the compounds and it also increases with increasing scan rate. So, one can conclude that these compounds exhibit quasireversible redox behavior coupled with some chemical reaction. In comparison to the ferrocene standard (E°′ = 0.19 V), the potentials for both compounds are anodically shifted due to the electron withdrawing effect of the linker groups between the ferrocene units. The presence of one quasireversible wave suggests that the two ferrocenyl units are oxidised in a single step and are electrochemically independent of one another.

The formal redox potentials [(Ep,a + Ep,c)/2] for these compounds can be taken as 324 mV and 284 mV vs.Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile) for 1 and 2, respectively. These values provide the electron donating energy level of the respective compound in its ground state with respect to the reference electrode used and the same values were used in the construction of the energy level diagram of the compounds.

          Light harvesting property

Energy level diagram for the compounds. 
The thermodynamic feasibility of electron injection from a photo-excited dye molecule (D*) into the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode [D*→ D+ + e− (TiO2)] and subsequent regeneration of the dye molecule to its original form (D+ + I− → D + ½I2) can be assessed from the energy level diagram depicting the relative positions of the electron exchange energy levels of all of the cell components. It was for this purpose that the energy level diagram was constructed on the electrochemical scale with respect to Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile). The potential of the photocurrent onset obtained from the current–potential curve was −0.65 V with respect to the counter electrode (in contact with I−/I3−), which would be −0.60 V with respect to Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile). Taking this as the flat band potential of the TiO2 electrode, the conduction band edge (ECB) can be taken at −0.70 V vs.Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile). Since the band gap of TiO2 is 3.2 eV, the valence band edge (EVB) of the TiO2 semiconductor electrode would be at +2.5 V.
The formal redox potential of the compounds obtained from CV (E0′D/D+ = 0.324V for 1 and 0.284 V for 2) provided the electron-transfer energy levels of the complex molecules in their ground state (D). These values, when coupled with the photoexcitation energy of 1 and 2 evaluated from their λmax values (444 nm and 450 nm respectively), provided the electron-transfer energy levels of the photo-excited dyes as −2.469 V and −2.472 V for 1 and 2, respectively. The redox potential of I−/I3− was taken as 0.05 V versusAg/Ag+ (acetonitrile).
Using these values the energy level diagram shown in Fig. 5 was constructed. This diagram clearly indicates that the process of electron transfer from photo-excited dye molecules to conduction band of TiO2 and subsequent regeneration of dye molecule by redox couple are thermodynamically feasible.

Photocurrent-potential curves
The sandwich-type cells (TiO2-dye/electrolyte containing I−/I3−/Pt counter electrode) were fabricated using different dyes (1, 2 and N719) and their J–V characteristics/curves were determined under visible light illumination (Fig. 6). The cell output parameters, namely, short circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open circuit potential (VOC), fill factor (FF) and overall light-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) derived from these curves (as illustrated in the next section) are given in Table 5. The overall conversion efficiency achieved with the use of compounds 1 and 2 was 0.83% and 0.68%, respectively, whereas in the case of N719 (used as a reference for comparison’s sake) it was 0.996 (≈1%) under identical experimental conditions. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the performance of the test dyes are quite comparable to that of the N719, although VOC was around 120 mV more in the latter case.

 Fig. 6  Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of solar cells based on a TiO2 thin film electrode sensitized by (a) Fe-1, (b) Fe-2 and (c) N719 and illuminated by visible light (intensity = 470 mW cm−2). 
Fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η)
The power output and related parameters of the dye sensitized cells were evaluated from the photocurrent–potential curves shown in Fig. 6. The fill factor (FF) and overall power conversion efficiency (η) were calculated using the following equations.  (1) (2)
Here Jmax and Vmax are the photocurrent and potential, respectively, the product of which (i.e., power, P) has the maximum value. Iinc (mW cm−2) is the intensity of the incident light. The extraction of the required parameters (Jmax, Vmax, JSC and VOC) from current–potential curves is illustrated in Fig. 7. The FF and η values calculated from these equations for the cells sensitized by different complex dyes are given in Table 5.

Photocurrent action spectrum

The sensitization of photocurrent by test dye(s) was ascertained from the action spectra (Jphoto–λ) of the dye-modified TiO2 electrode. The short-circuit photocurrent (Jphoto) of the dye-sensitized cell was measured as a function of the wavelength of monochromatic light (λ) used for the illumination of the semiconductor electrode. From these values of Jphoto and the intensity of the corresponding monochromatic light (Iinc), the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated at each excitation wavelength (λ) using following equation.  (3)
The (IPCE–λ) plots for TiO2 electrode sensitized by 1 and 2 complex dyes are shown in Fig. 8. The close resemblance of the nature of the action spectrum with that of the absorption spectrum of the respective dye confirms the sensitization of photocurrent by dye.

Transient current–time curve
The transient short circuit current–time (J–t) curve was recorded to know the response time of the photoanode to light stimulus and sustainability of the photocurrent on illumination of the semiconductor electrode by visible light. The results of these measurements for cells sensitized by complex dyes 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 9. These current–time profiles clearly show that on illumination of the semiconductor electrode, the photocurrent rises sharply and after attaining the highest value it remains constant without any significant decay. From such an observation, it can be inferred that the dye regeneration process is fast enough to keep up with the rate of electron injection from the photo-excited dye molecules. When light was switched ‘OFF’, the current was found to quickly decay to dark current without any under shooting, indicating therefore the absence of any recombination of charge carriers (injected electrons and oxidized dye molecules).
Dependence of photocurrent on the intensity of visible light
Under short-circuit conditions, the photocurrent was measured as a function of the intensity of visible light used for the irradiation of the photoanode and the results are shown in Fig. 10. The linear variation in photocurrent with the intensity of visible light shows that (i) all of the processes involved are able to keep up with each other and (ii) the recombination of injected electrons and oxidized dye molecules is practically absent.

Unlike the trend shown by JSC, the overall power conversion efficiency (η) was found to increase with decreasing light intensity, as can be seen in Fig. 11. At 100 mW cm−2 light intensity, the η values (evaluated by extrapolating the curves in Fig. 11) were 1.64, 1.08 and 2.50% for the sensitizers 1, 2 and N719, respectively. The power conversion efficiencies achieved with the use of compounds 1 and 2 are reasonably good and can be improved further by optimizing the other cell components.

Conclusions
During this work, we prepared and fully characterized one new compound, 1, and another previously reported compound, 2, via new synthetic routes in good yield. Both compounds were exploited for their application as a photosensitizer in dye sensitized solar cells. Significant enhancement in light harvesting efficiencies were observed using these compounds compared to what could be achieved with our previously reported square planar Ni(II), Cu(II) and Pt(II) ferrocenyl dithiocarbamate complexes.6d This could be because these compounds have linking groups providing the proper orientation of ferrocenyl units to act as antennae for light harvesting and the other ferrocenyl groups to adsorb onto the TiO2 semiconductor. Under the pursued experimental conditions, the dye sensitized conversion efficiencies of compounds 1 and 2 are close to ruthenium bipyridyl complex-based dye N719. This investigation widens the scope for the design and development of ferrocenyl-based sensitizers for light harvesting devices and reveals that these may be more cost-effective suitable replacement of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes in DSSCs.
