    , Accepted 23rd September 2015First published on 25th September 2015AbstractAn electron rich donor moiety plays an important role in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs). In order to attain a suitable donor moiety for DSCs, a deeper understanding of the role of a donor moiety in the dye excited state is significant. In this context, different arylamine dye-based electron donor moieties (TRA, CRA and PyRA) were successfully synthesized and well characterized using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and EI-MS spectrometry. Their photophysical properties and solvatochromic behavior were studied using UV-visible absorption, steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. The absorption of arylamine dyes is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and rhodanine-3-acetic acid via a π-bridge, which is further confirmed by DFT calculations. Lippert–Mataga analysis on the solvatochromic data implies that these molecules are more polar in the excited state, which is additional support for ICT. Furthermore, nanocrystalline TiO2-based dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were fabricated using these dyes to investigate the influence of donor moieties on their photovoltaic performance. The overall power conversion efficiencies of 2.57%, 1.68% and 1.25% were obtained for the TRA, PyRA and CRA dyes, respectively. The enhanced power conversion efficiency of TRA is due to a longer lifetime of injected electrons as demonstrated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are a promising low-cost alternative to traditional silicon-based photovoltaic cells.1 As a key component of DSCs, a sensitizer plays a crucial role in light harvesting and light-to-electricity conversion; extensive effort has, therefore, gone in to synthesizing several ruthenium, porphyrin, and organic dyes and investigating their performance in DSCs.2–6 Ruthenium dyes offer an average efficiency of 11%, but their application might be limited due to the scarcity of ruthenium metal and environmental concerns.7–9 Porphyrins are among the most widely studied sensitizers due to their intense absorption in the Soret and Q bands to harvest solar energy efficiently in a broad spectral region.10–18 More importantly, their optical, photophysical, and electrochemical properties can be modulated with peripheral modifications or inner metal coordinations.19–22 Several porphyrin monomers have been used in DSCs and record high efficiencies of 12% and 13% were achieved by GY50 and SM315 porphyrin dyes, respectively, using a cobalt electrolyte under standard one-sun illumination.23,24
Besides, more efforts have been devoted to the development of metal-free organic sensitizers in recent years due to the wide availability of the raw materials.25 Particularly, organic dyes with a D–π–A configuration are popular for their non-toxicity, high molar extinction coefficients, flexible molecular engineering, and material abundance. Various organic molecules,26 such as merocyanine, coumarin, indoline, squaraine, hemicyanine, phenothiazine, triphenylamine, fluorene, carbazole and tetrahydroquinoline have been reported, thus making organic dyes profitable in their application in DSCs. In 2010, Wang et al. demonstrated a substituted arylamine dye with a η up to 10.3% for a metal-free organic dye with an iodine/iodide redox shuttle.27 Later in 2011, Grätzel et al. reported the phenyldihexyloxy-substituted TPA (DHO-TPA) dye, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency (η) of 10.3% in combination with a cobalt redox shuttle.28 In 2013, Wang et al. tailored a metal-free organic dye with the chromophoric core of cyclopentadithiophene–benzothiadiazole (CPDT–BT), which displays power conversion efficiencies at various irradiances of the simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 sunlight of 11.5–12.8%, setting a new benchmark for organic dye sensitized solar cells.29 This is the highest conversion efficiency of metal-free organic dyes reported so far. Therefore, arylamine dyes have been found to be desirable candidates for organic sensitizers.
We are particularly interested in the design and synthesis of arylamine dyes to study the role of a donor moiety on the excited state properties. In fact, minor changes in the structure of arylamine donors can lead to notable enhancement in the performance of the dye, and its thermal and photochemical stability. For instance, Chen and co-workers reported a family of triphenylamine dyes with an increased electron density of the donor moiety as an effective way to improve the dye performance.30 A dye (TPAR4) with a CH2CH– substituted triphenylamine electron donating group gave a 5.8% efficiency under AM 1.5 G irradiation due to the increase of the electron density in the donor subunit. The corresponding dye (TPAR1)30 without the CH2CH– substitution exhibited a lower efficiency of 4.3%. Hagberg et al. developed a very simple modification of arylamine dyes, namely D7 and D11 sensitizers.31 The overall conversion efficiency of D7 and D11 is 5.43% and 7.03% respectively. The higher efficiency of the D11 sensitizer compared to the D7 sensitizer demonstrates the beneficial influence of alkoxy units on photovoltage and photocurrent, caused by the enhanced red response. The increased photovoltage of the D11 sensitized solar cell compared to that of the D7 sensitized solar cell is mainly due to the increased lifetime of the conduction band electrons.
Here, our aim is to develop arylamine derivatives with very simple modification, to investigate the role of donor moieties on the excited state properties and to correlate the solar cell performance. In the arylamine dyes, taking TRA (diphenylamine donor) as a prototype, CRA and PyRA dyes were developed. In TRA, the free phenyl groups are closed in order to obtain the rigid carbazole donor (CRA), whereas, to form the pyrrolidin donor (PyRA) two phenyl groups were detached from the carbazole structure (Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, there are no systematic studies carried out on these molecules. Steady state and time resolved spectroscopic analyses were performed to understand the influence of donor moieties.

Experimental section
Materials
Rhodanine-3-acetic acid, 4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde, N-(4-formylphenyl)carbazole, 4-(1-pyrrolidino)benzaldehyde, and dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Glacial acetic acid and ammonium acetate were purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories (SRL), India and were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The solvents used for the photophysical studies were HPLC grade.
Instrumentation
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a BRUKER VERTEX 70 attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed on a BRUKER spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C, and the spectra were collected at ambient probe temperature, calibrated to either an internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) standard or to a residual protio solvent. Electron ionization-mass spectra (EI-MS) were acquired using a JEOL GC mate-II mass spectrometer photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were recorded using a CHI-620B Electrochemical Analyzer, CH Instruments Inc. A three-electrode single-compartment cell with a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode were employed for the experiments. The glassy carbon electrode was polished with Al2O3 paste, cleaned thoroughly in an ultrasonic water bath, and washed with ethanol before each measurement. In the present study, the oxidation potential of arylamine dyes was measured in acetonitrile (ACN) with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as the electrolyte. About 10 ml of 1 × 10−3 M arylamine dye in acetonitrile charged with tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate was taken in an electrochemical cell and degassed by bubbling with nitrogen for 15 min before the experiments. The electronic absorption spectra of the samples were recorded using a CARY 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectral measurements were carried out using a Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon). For the fluorescence studies, very diluted solutions were used to avoid spectral distortions due to the inner-filter effect and emission re-absorption. Time resolved picosecond fluorescence decays were obtained by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique with a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, R3809U) as a detector and a femtosecond laser as an excitation source. The second harmonics (400 nm) output from the mode-locked femtosecond laser (Tsunami, Spectra physics) was used as the excitation source. The instrument response function for the TCSPC system is ∼50 ps. The data analysis was carried out by the software provided by IBH (DAS-6), which is based on a deconvolution technique using the nonlinear least-squares methods. Femtosecond fluorescence decays have been collected using a fluorescence up-conversion technique. In our femtosecond up-conversion setup (FOG 100, CDP, Russia) the sample was excited using the second harmonic (400 nm) of a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra physics). The fundamental beam (800 nm) was frequency-doubled in a nonlinear crystal (1 mm BBO, θ = 25°, ϕ = 90°) and used for the excitation. The sample was placed inside a 1 mm thick rotating quartz cell. The fluorescence emitted from the sample was up-converted in a nonlinear crystal (0.5 mm BBO, θ = 38°, ϕ = 90°) using the fundamental beam as a gate pulse. The up-converted light is dispersed in a monochromator and detected using photon counting electronics. The instrument response function of the apparatus is 300 fs. The femtosecond fluorescence decays were fitted using a Gaussian shape for the excitation pulse.
DFT calculations
The geometry optimization and harmonic vibrational frequency calculations of the TRA, CRA, and PyRA dyes were carried with the Gaussian 09 program package.32 The ground state geometries of the three dyes were optimized using the DFT method, the hybrid B3LYP33–35 functional and the 6-311+G** basis set on all atoms. Vibrational analysis was performed at each stationary point found, which confirmed its identity as an energy minimum on the potential energy surface and there is no imaginary frequency. The choice of the B3LYP functional was based on previous theoretical studies that show that B3LYP is very successful in the prediction of photophysical properties of this class of compounds.36
Quantum yield measurements
The fluorescence quantum yields (ϕF) of the arylamine derivatives were calculated using the following eqn (1): ϕF = (AR/AS)(IS/IR)(ηS/ηR)2ϕR(1)where the subscripts S and R refer to the sample and the reference, respectively. A is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, I is the integrated emission area, and η is the solvent refraction index. Coumarin-153 (ϕ = 0.58)37 was used as a standard for CRA and fluorescein (ϕ = 0.9)38 was used as a standard for TRA and PyRA.
Cell assembly and characterization
FTO glass plates were purchased from BHEL, India. The photoanode39 was prepared by the following procedure: 0.5 g of TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles and 0.016 g of polyethylene glycol were added to a solution of 1 M HNO3. Then, 0.21 ml of acetyl acetone and 0.04 ml of Triton-X were added to the mixture. Later the mixture was ultrasonicated for 1 h then stirred for 24 h to get a homogenous TiO2 paste. Before the preparation of the electrodes, the FTO plates were washed by sonicating subsequently in a soap solution, distilled water, acetone, and 2-propanol for 15 min. For the photoanode preparation, the washed FTO plates were pretreated with a 40 mM solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C. After TiCl4 treatment, the plates were washed with water and ethanol and then dried at 100 °C on a hot plate for 10 min. Then, the TiO2 paste was coated on a FTO plate by the doctor blade technique. Then, the plates were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the binder and solvent, getting an electrically-connected network of TiO2 particles by sintering under a tubular furnace. After the sintering process, when the temperature of the plate drops to 80 °C, it was immersed into the dye solution in methanol for 24 h. Excess non-adsorbed dye was washed with anhydrous ethanol. The platinum catalyst counter electrode was prepared by deposition of a H2PtCl6·6H2O solution (0.005 M in isopropanol) onto FTO glass and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The DSC device was fabricated by the following method: the Pt cathode was placed on top of the photoanode and they were tightly clipped together. Then, liquid electrolyte, 0.05 M I2/0.5 M LiI/0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile was injected in between the two electrodes. The thickness of the electrolyte layer is maintained at about 50 μm (approximately the thickness of a tape). The photocurrent–voltage characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the DSCs were recorded under 85 mW cm−2 light illumination using an AUTOLAB12/FRA2 electrochemical analyzer.
Result and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
The electron donor moiety in organic sensitizers plays a crucial role in determining the overall power conversion efficiency.40–42 Therefore, we have targeted three different donor moieties containing arylamine dyes to investigate the role of the electron donor moiety on the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, and the electrochemical, photophysical and photovoltaic properties. Note that, in the targeted dyes, the π-bridge (benzene) and the acceptor/anchoring group (rhodanine-3-acetic acid) remained same. The targeted dyes (TRA, CRA and PyRA) were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation of the corresponding aldehydes with rhodanine-3-acetic acid in the presence of acetic acid and ammonium acetate. The aldehydes used were 4-(diphenylamino) benzaldehyde, N-(4-formylphenyl)carbazole and 4-(1-pyrrolidino)benzaldehyde. The final products were obtained in good yields and successfully characterized by FTIR, NMR and mass spectroscopic techniques. The detailed synthetic route (Scheme S1, ESI†) and characterization data are illustrated in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S9). In the arylamine dyes, taking TRA (diphenylamine donor) as a prototype, CRA and PyRA dyes were developed. In TRA, the free phenyl groups are closed in order to obtain the rigid carbazole donor (CRA), whereas, to form the pyrrolidin donor (PyRA), two phenyl groups were detached from the carbazole structure. Structures and photographs of the synthesized arylamine dyes are depicted in Fig. 1, which clearly reveals that upon changing the donor moieties, the colour of the dyes is remarkably intensified, which is due to the reduced HOMO–LUMO band gaps.
Theoretical considerations
Density functional theory calculations were employed to investigate the impact of the donor moiety on the structure and HOMO/LUMO levels of arylamine dyes. The optimized geometries of TRA, CRA and PyRA along with notable structural parameters are shown in Fig. 2a, which clearly reveals that intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions facilitate the most stable conformation of the arylamine dyes under investigation. The Npyr–Cphenyl bond length in PyRA (1.367 Å) is shorter than that in TRA (1.402 Å) and CRA (1.411 Å). But in the case of TRA and CRA, the Npyr–Cphenyl bond distance is closer to a single bond length of 1.47 Å. This leads to a decrease in the effective delocalization in CRA and TRA. This suggests that the PyRA dye molecule is attributed with partial double bond character, which leads to more effective delocalization throughout the molecule than in the other two dye molecules. In addition to this, PyRA is found to have a planar structure whereas in the TRA and CRA dyes, the donor moiety is lying perpendicular to the acceptor and the π-bridge moieties; as a result, effective charge transfer is expected to be greater in PyRA than in TRA and CRA. Upon investigating the ground state dipole moment of the three dye molecules, PyRA has a relatively larger dipole moment of 11.08 D compared to the others (TRA (8.55 D) and CRA (4.53 D)). This is the additional support of PyRA which is said to have effective intramolecular charge separation between the donor and acceptor units.

It is very important to analyze the nature of the HOMO and LUMO levels of organic dyes prior to studying their photovoltaic properties. The ground state density plots of the HOMO and LUMO of the three dye molecules calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory in THF medium are shown in Fig. 2b. The HOMO is mainly delocalized over the donor unit and the LUMO originates on the acceptor and spacer units. Hence, the HOMO–LUMO excitation by light irradiation induced a shift of an electron from the donor moiety to the acceptor moiety via the π-bridge. This indicates that the HOMO–LUMO transitions bear significant intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character. Notably, the contribution of the HOMO levels is higher in the donor part of TRA and CRA. But, in the case of PyRA, the contribution of the HOMO level is localized in the entire molecule. Moreover, in all the dyes, the LUMO levels are largely localized in the acceptor part (rhodanine-3-acetic acid); this is an essential prerequisite for charge transfer properties to the conduction band of TiO2. Furthermore, the LUMO is mainly concentrated on the carbonyl and thiocarbonyl group of the rhodanine framework and does not extend further to the carboxyl group. Hence, charge transfer cannot be transferred through the carboxylate group, and consequently through-space charge transfer is likely for the selected dyes.
It is noteworthy to analyze and understand the origin of the individual contributions of various segments of the dye molecules towards the HOMO and LUMO levels. So, a Chemissian program was used to compute the individual contributions of various fragments of the dyes. The entire molecule was fragmented into two groups, namely the donor and acceptor groups (Fig. 3). The major contribution of the HOMO in all the dyes is spread on the donor moiety and it is greater in CRA (96%) and TRA (81%), and lower in PyRA (71%), whereas the delocalization of the LUMO electron density on the acceptor unit of PyRA (56%) is higher than that on the other two dye molecules (49% and 31% for TRA and CRA respectively). It clearly indicates that the pyrrolidin unit in PyRA facilitates the effective charge transfer from donor to acceptor. Overall, the theoretical results show that PyRA has been found to have excellent charge transfer properties, hence this molecule may show a better solar cell power conversion efficiency than the other dyes.

Steady state absorption spectroscopy
To obtain a highly efficient DSC, the light harvesting efficiency of the dye in the photoanode is the most important and indispensable factor, which is mainly related to the molar extinction coefficient of the dye.43 Therefore, we intend to measure the molar extinction coefficient of arylamine dyes using a UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer. In addition, by measuring the absorption spectra of the arylamine dyes (TRA, CRA and PyRA), one can understand the influence of electron donors on the light harvesting properties. Hence, UV-vis absorption spectra of the arylamine dyes were recorded in methanol, and are shown in Fig. 4a.
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of TRA, CRA and PyRA (a) in MeOH and (b) on a TiO2 film. 
The absorption of the arylamine dyes is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and the rhodanine-3-acetic acid via the π-bridge. As the concentration of the arylamine dyes was increased, the absorbance of the band regularly increased and at the same time, Beer–Lambert's law was obeyed for all the dyes in the concentration range of 0.5 × 10−5 M to 2.5 × 10−5 M. The maximum absorption peaks and the corresponding molar extinction coefficient values of the dyes were 456 nm (4.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1) for TRA, 403 nm (3.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1) for CRA, and 466 nm (4.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1) for PyRA, respectively. In comparison with the conventional ruthenium dye N719 (1.47 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 535 nm),44 the arylamine dye molecules showed obviously higher absorption coefficients, which could be beneficial for better light harvesting. By comparing all the dyes, PyRA absorbs at a longer wavelength with a high molar absorption coefficient, due to the strong electron donating ability of the pyrrolidin unit to the acceptor via the benzene π-bridge. On the other hand, the TRA molecule shows a hypsochromic shift (10 nm) compared with PyRA, which is due to electrons which are delocalized in the phenyl rings and hence the electron-push effect was slightly diminished. However for CRA, a large hypsochromic shift was observed compared with PyRA, due to the planar nature of the carbazole donor which favours the delocalization of the lone pair electron of the nitrogen atom, which leads to a decrease in the electron-push effect.45 Further investigation, and absorption spectra of the arylamine dyes measured in various solvents are shown in Fig. S10–S12 (ESI†). As seen from the figure, the absorption maximum of the dye is not shifted by much with the increasing solvent polarity, which implies that the effect of solvent in the ground state is not significant.
In order to understand the light harvesting properties of arylamine dyes on the TiO2 surface, 4 μm TiO2 nanocrystalline films were prepared from a commercially available TiO2 paste (Solaronix SA, Ti-Nanoxide HT/SC series) and they were sensitized in 0.5 mM of the arylamine dyes in methanol at room temperature for 1 h. The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the arylamine dyes deposited on transparent TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 4b. The maximal absorption peaks for TRA, CRA and PyRA on TiO2 films appeared at 465, 425 and 455 nm, respectively. Moreover, their absorption spectra on the TiO2 films are broadened due to the interaction of the anchoring group of the dyes with TiO2 which was commonly observed for dye/TiO2 systems.46,47 This spectral broadening allows the dye molecules to harvest visible light more efficiently and thus increases the photocurrent response region with a rise of the short-circuit current density (JSC).48,49 Except for PyRA, compared to the spectra of TRA and CRA in methanol solution, a red shift of the absorption peak was observed on the TiO2 surface, which can be attributed to the formation of a J-aggregate. Interestingly, PyRA/TiO2 exhibits a blue (at the peak maximum) and red (at the peak tail) shift compared with its spectrum in methanol solution, thus indicating that a mixture of H and J-type aggregation is possible in PyRA/TiO2.50
The light harvesting efficiency (LHE)51 can be related to the molar extinction coefficient of the dye which is given in the following eqn (2): LHE = 1–10−Γσ(λ)(2)where Γ (mol cm−2) is the number of moles of dye per square centimeter of the projected surface area of the film and the surface coverage is calculated using the following eqn (3):52–54 Γ = A(λ)/σ(λ)(3)where A(λ) is the absorbance and σ(λ) is the optical cross section at a given wavelength, respectively. Using eqn (4), one is able to calculate σ(λ). σ(λ) = ε(λ) × 1000 (cm3 L−1)(4) The surface coverage of the arylamine dyes was determined to be 1.46 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for TRA, 1.43 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for CRA, and 3.1 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for PyRA. Using these surface coverage values, the LHE spectra of the dye/TiO2 films are plotted and shown in Fig. 5. From this figure, it is clear that PyRA has a higher LHE than the others, hence it is expected that PyRA should show a higher power conversion efficiency.

Fluorescence spectroscopy
To get further information about the role of donor moieties on the excited state properties of the arylamine dyes, fluorescence spectra were recorded by excitation at their absorption maximum. For fluorescence studies, samples are measured in very dilute solutions in order to avoid the re-absorption, excimer and concentration effect. The fluorescence of the arylamine dyes is very weak and they exhibited very low quantum yields such as 0.0011 (TRA), 0.0006 (CRA) and 0.0019 (PyRA) respectively. A weak fluorescence of arylamine dyes is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). It has been previously reported that the ICT is a competitive relaxation process of the singlet excited state and typically reduces the fluorescence.55 Due to its weak fluorescence, it is very difficult to examine the role of the donor moiety from the steady state fluorescence studies, hence time resolved fluorescence measurements have been adopted in order to understand the role of donor moieties. Therefore, a femtosecond fluorescence set-up was used to extract the lifetime of the dyes, since the lifetimes of these dyes are very fast and almost as fast as our TCSPC instrument response function (<50 ps). Fig. 6 displays the femtosecond (fs) fluorescence decay of the dyes in methanol which were measured in a 100 ps time window upon excitation at 400 nm.
 Fig. 6  Time resolved fluorescence decay of TRA, CRA and PyRA in MeOH. 
The obtained fluorescence decays are fitted with a biexponential function [F(t) = A1exp (−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)] and the fitted values are collectively given in Table 1. The ultrafast component of the dyes is at ∼2 ps, whereas the slow component is slightly longer at ∼20 ps. The ultrafast decay component, τ1, is attributed to the solvent relaxation of the excited states and τ2 is due to the lifetime of the relaxed charge transfer state.56 The obtained average lifetimes of the arylamine dyes are in the order of PyRA > TRA > CRA. However, the obtained lifetimes are in the picosecond time scales, hence the electron injection from these dyes to TiO2 is expected to be very fast.56–58

Solvatochromism
It is well known that the excited state properties of the ICT based dyes were found to be very sensitive to the solvent polarity.59 Hence, solvatochromism of the arylamine dyes was performed. The solvatochromic method is based on the shift of the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence maxima with varying polarity of the solvent.60 The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the dyes with varying solvents are shown in Fig. S10–S15 (ESI†) and the corresponding maxima are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). All the dyes show a structured emission in nonpolar solvents, whereas moderate and high polarity solvents show a broad and structureless emission. The Stokes' shift is calculated as the difference between the absorption and emission maxima obtained from the corrected spectra on the wavenumber scale. The obtained large Stokes' shift is a result of efficient charge transfer from the arylamine donor moiety to the acceptor rhodanine-3-acetic acid moiety (cf. above). Moreover, all the dyes were found to be completely insoluble in water and hence the photophysical parameters could not be obtained in water (ε = 80).
The solvent dependent spectral shifts are often interpreted in terms of the Lippert equation (eqn (5)), which describes the Stokes' shift in terms of the change in dipole moment of the fluorophore upon excitation and the dependence of energy of the dipole on the dielectric constant and refractive index of the solvent61 and is given as: (5)where A and F are the wavenumbers (cm−1) of the absorption and emission, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, a is the radius of the cavity, ε is the dielectric constant of the medium, n is the refractive index of the solvent and the term Δf is the orientation polarizability (eqn (6)). (6)Fig. 7 represents the Lippert–Mataga plot of the arylamine dyes in various solvents. Alcoholic solvents were omitted in order to get a linear correlation, since these solvents are involved in specific solute–solvent interactions.62
 Fig. 7  Lippert–Mataga plots for the dyes. 
A specific solvent interaction is further verified by varying the percentage of alcohol into a nonpolar solvent. For instance, the emission spectrum of TRA in pure toluene is structured, whereas in methanol it is weak, broad and structureless (Fig. 8). In the binary mixture as the methanol amount increases, there is a loss in the vibrational fine structure of the TRA spectrum and also a decrease in the overall spectral intensity is observed. Moreover, with an increase in methanol there is a gradual red shift in the emission maximum. The most likely explanation for the above observed spectral changes could be the preferential solvation of the polar excited ICT state by a more polar solvent. In toluene, due to the absence of a solvent dipole, the emission is from the locally excited state showing a structured spectrum.
 Fig. 8  Fluorescence spectra of TRA in toluene–methanol mixtures. 

Fig. 7 shows the linear plot of the solvent polarity function versus the Stokes' shift. The change in dipole moment (Δμ = μE − μG) for all the dyes has been calculated from the slope of the linear plot and is listed in Table 2. The estimated Δμ values are more positive (Table 2) and suggestive of a large dipole moment for the molecules in the excited state. Among the dyes, TRA and CRA exhibit a large change in dipole moment confirming the more pronounced ICT for these molecules in the excited state. The emission spectra of the dyes are broadened on moving from the nonpolar to the polar solvents. This probably supports the speculation that the initially formed local excited state transforms into the more polar charge transfer state, which is stabilized by the polar solvents. Thus significant change in the dipole moment on excitation has been observed.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the arylamine dyes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in deoxygenated ACN solution containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as supporting electrolyte (Fig. S16, ESI†). The measurements were carried out using a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell, which consists of a glassy carbon electrode which is used as the working electrode while platinum wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All of the dyes show an oxidation wave which is attributable to the removal of an electron from the amine segment. The exact oxidation potential for the arylamine dyes was extracted from the DPV method and is listed in Table 3. As shown in this table, the first oxidation potentials (Eox) correspond to the HOMO levels of the dyes, which are more positive than the redox potential of the (I/I3)− redox couple (0.4 V), indicating that the reduction of the oxidized dyes with I− ions is thermodynamically feasible. On the other hand, the excited state oxidation potentials (Eox*), which correspond to the LUMO level of the dyes, can be obtained by the following eqn (7): Eox* = Eox − E(0–0)(7)where E(0–0) is the excited state energy of the dye, which is estimated from the intersection between the normalized absorption and emission spectra. The obtained Eox* of the dyes are more negative than the conduction band potential of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicating that the electron injection process from the excited dyes to the TiO2 conduction band is energetically favourable (Scheme 1).

 Scheme 1  Schematic energy levels for the electron transfer between arylamine dyes and the conduction band of TiO2. 
Driving forces for electron injection (ΔGinj) from the dye excited state to the CB of TiO2 and electron recombination (ΔGrec) from the CB of TiO2 to the dye radical cation (Eox) are determined from the following equations and the values are shown in Table 3. ΔGinj = Eox* − ECB(8) ΔGrec = ECB − Eox(9) The obtained ΔG values are negative, which indicated that both of the processes are thermodynamically feasible and most importantly that injection is the dominant process rather than recombination for these dyes.
Photovoltaic properties
Overall the results clearly show that the dyes developed in this work have promising light absorption properties and suitable ground/excited state oxidation potentials to be used as potential sensitizers for conventional DSCs. In addition, the results from the DFT calculations, and photophysical and electrochemical studies reveal that PyRA may be a potential candidate for solar cells. Hence, the photovoltaic studies of the freshly fabricated cells are measured under AM1.5 solar irradiation (85 mW cm−2) and the corresponding J–V characteristics of the cells are shown in Fig. 9.

J–V characteristics of the TRA, CRA and PyRA devices. 
The parameters such as the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and overall conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 4. From the results, it is clear that there is a significant role of the donor moieties on the power conversion efficiency. For instance, taking TRA as a prototype, PyRA and CRA molecules were developed in order to understand the impact of the donor moiety on the performance of the solar cells. Several groups have reported the power conversion efficiency of TRA63–65 at around 2.5%, and here we have also reproduced the same, hence it is meaningful to compare the newly developed molecules (PyRA and CRA). Under the same conditions, the PyRA and CRA sensitized solar cells gave overall power conversion efficiencies (η) of 1.68% and 1.25% respectively. It is clear that the photovoltaic performances of DSCs are affected by changing the electron rich donors in organic dyes. By comparing PyRA and CRA, the photovoltaic performance of PyRA is significantly improved; this may due to the higher molar extinction coefficient and high JSC. Contrary to our expectation, the power conversion efficiency of PyRA is less than that of TRA. In order to examine why such a difference in power conversion efficiency occurred, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy66 was employed. Fig. 10 shows the EIS Nyquist plots for the DSCs based on TRA, CRA and PyRA. Generally, the largest semicircle in the lower frequency range in the Nyquist plot represents the interfacial charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface,67 which is the charge recombination between the injected electrons and electrolyte.

Hence, the obtained plot in Fig. 10 looks like a semicircle which is assigned to the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The diameter of the semicircle is in the order of: TRA > CRA > PyRA, which means that the electron transfer resistance for the unwanted back reaction is larger for TRA than that for CRA and PyRA. This may be responsible for the achieved higher VOC and JSC of TRA. Moreover, the electron recombination between the electrolyte and TiO2 is related to the electron lifetime in the CB of TiO2, which is ultimately related to the VOC. Therefore, Bode phase plots (Fig. S17, ESI†) were used to find out the effective lifetime (τeff) of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2. τeff was calculated68 by making use of the following eqn (10): τeff = 1/2πf(10)where f is the frequency of the corresponding peak in the Bode phase plot. The obtained electron lifetimes for TRA, CRA and PyRA are 17.58, 13.26 and 4.29 ms, respectively. In principle, a longer electron lifetime indicates improved suppression of back reactions between the injected electrons and the electrolyte that leads to improvement of the VOC value, due to the reduced electron recombination rate.69 Consequently, the observed longer electron lifetime in the case of TRA could explain its high VOC and also the higher efficiency, as well as more effective suppression of back reactions than that of the other dyes (PyRA and CRA).
Summary
We have successfully demonstrated the impact of a donor moiety on the photophysical and photovoltaic properties of certain arylamine derivatives. Among the dyes investigated, TRA and PyRA show strong absorption characteristics due to the reduced HOMO/LUMO energy gaps compared to CRA. The excited state lifetimes of these dyes are almost similar (in the order of a picosecond time scale) and the electron injection is expected to be same; as a result, one can expect a similar power conversion efficiency. In contrast to the expectation, the power conversion efficiency of TRA (2.57%) and PyRA (1.68%) is very diverse. The higher power conversion efficiency of TRA is due to high JSC and VOC values. The lower power conversion efficiency of PyRA is due to a faster electron recombination rate as evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These findings reveal that diminutive alteration in the structure of a donor moiety plays a significant role in the photovoltaic performance.
