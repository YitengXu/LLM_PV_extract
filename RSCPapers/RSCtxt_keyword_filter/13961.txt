, Accepted 10th September 2014First published on 10th September 2014AbstractA TiO2 replica of ZnO nanosheet films is synthesized using a chemical replacement process. ZnO nanosheets are grown by electrodeposition on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) films, and a dissolution/deposition process is used to convert the ZnO template into a TiO2 replica. Electron microscopy shows the final TiO2 structure follows the morphology of the initial ZnO template. X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy verify the total transformation of ZnO to TiO2. The as-synthesized TiO2 sheets are amorphous and after annealing turn into the anatase phase. The film of TiO2 nanosheets is used as the photoanode of a dye sensitized solar cell. Despite the low roughness factor of 100, a conversion efficiency of 3.3% with D35 as sensitizer is achieved. The nanosheets show remarkably faster electron transport and longer electron lifetime compared to the conventional TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide remains one of the most important semiconductor materials, with a wide range of research activity around it. Different properties such as wide band gap, high chemical stability, environmentally friendly nature, and low cost, make TiO2 applicable in photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and chemical sensors.1–5 In most of these potential applications, the morphology of TiO2 plays an important role in determining the performance of devices.
In case of sensitized solar cells, including dye- and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, the structures of the TiO2 photoelectrodes greatly affect the cell performance. Various morphology parameters, including roughness factor, grain boundaries, crystallinity and light scattering influence the dye loading, electron transport time, electron lifetime and finally cell efficiency.6–11 Mesoporous structures based on TiO2 nanoparticles is the conventional structure for dye solar cells (DSC). In these structures the transport time is relatively large, limiting the device to work only with certain electrolyte compositions that provide longer electron lifetime. One and two dimensional structures are expected to provide faster electron transport by geometrically limited transport paths.12,13 In depleted heterojunction quantum dot solar cells, the surface area of the mesoporous TiO2 is not important, while electron transport properties is critical. For these cells it has been demonstrated that one dimensional structures show better electron transport rate and higher efficiency compared to planar structures.14
The template-assisted method is a universal approach to design and prepare certain nanostructures that cannot be directly grown because of specific crystal habits. Different TiO2 morphologies have been fabricated using templates, by growing TiO2 and subsequent removing of the template.15–17 Contrary to TiO2, ZnO nanostructures with different morphologies can be easily obtained depending on the preparation method. ZnO structures can be a good template for preparation of one and two-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures. Electrodeposition of ZnO in controlled conditions has been reported to yield one and two dimensional morphologies on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) surface.18–24 The power conversion efficiencies obtained in ZnO-based DSCs are typically significantly lower compared to TiO2-based devices. Therefore ZnO structures are preferred as templates that may yield TiO2 with certain one or two dimensional structures. There are reports on using liquid phase deposition of TiO2 by TiF4 on ZnO nanorods, resulting in a composite of TiO2–ZnO nanostructures.14,25 In a recent work, TiO2 is deposited on ZnO nanosheets and ZnO is removed in the next step, to create hollow structures of TiO2.26
In this research, we present a one step method to fabricate films of TiO2 nanosheets from ZnO nanosheets deposited on FTO surface. A dissolution/deposition process has been employed to convert ZnO nanosheets into TiO2 nanosheets. ZnO nanosheets were fabricated by electrochemical deposition method. The final product was used as the photoanode of DSC devices. These TiO2 nanosheet electrodes exhibit significantly better electron transport properties.
Experimental section
Preparation of ZnO template
Films of ZnO nanosheets have been prepared by electrochemical deposition in a three-electrode glass cell immersed in a water bath held at 70 °C. The working and counter electrodes were FTO/glass substrates (15 Ω cm−2, Dyesol), while an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. An aqueous solution of 0.05 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck) mixed with 0.1 M KCl (Merck) as the supporting electrolyte have been used for the electrodeposition. A potentio/galvanostat electrochemical workstation (PalmSense) was used to deposit the nanostructures by amperometery potentiostatic method at −1.1 V (relative to the Ag/AgCl electrode) and for different deposition times. After the deposition, the resulting films were thoroughly rinsed with deionised (DI) water. The prepared films were annealed at 350 °C for 30 min.
Synthesis of TiO2 nanosheets
The synthesized ZnO nanosheet films on FTO were immersed vertically in an aqueous solution consisting of 0.05 M of (NH4)2TiF6 (Aldrich) and 0.15 M of H3BO3 at 28 °C for 0–120 min, while the solution has been stirred slowly. The pH of the solution was set at 4.15. It has been explored that in this situation, (NH4)2TiF6 is hydrolyzed and then condensed as TiO2 on the surface of individual ZnO nanosheets while ZnO is dissolved simultaneously in the acidic solution produced by (NH4)2TiF6 hydrolysis. In other words, Zn2+ is exchanged with Ti4+ and TiO2 is deposited in place of ZnO. The TiO2 films were rinsed with DI water, then immersed in ethanol and then pentane each for 5 min, and finally drying at room temperature. TiO2 films were crystallized in air at 500 °C for 60 min.
Fabrication and characterization of DSCs
Dyeing of the prepared films were performed in either a 0.4 M methanolic solutions containing cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium dye (N719, Solaronix) or DN-F04(E)-3-(5-(4-(bis(20,40-dibutoxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino)thiophene-2-yl))-2-cyanoacrilyc acid (D35) at room temperature for different times. The sensitized films were rinsed with ethanol for removing the excess dye molecules remaining on the surface. Subsequently, the sensitized electrode was sandwiched together with a platinum-coated FTO as the counter electrode separated by about 30 μm Surlyn spacer. The internal space between two electrodes was filled with an electrolyte solution composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.6 M methylhexylimidazolium iodide in acetonitrile by capillary action. The active area of the resulting cell exposed in light was 0.25 cm2. For comparison, conventional TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes (20 nm, 12 μm thick, Sharif Solar paste) were prepared in identical fabrication conditions. The DSC performance was evaluated in AM1.5 simulated light (Sharif Solar) using a potentiostat/galvanostat (IVIUM, Compact stat) workstation.
In order to estimate the internal surface area of the films, the number of dye molecules adsorbed on the film was measured by dye de-loading in an aqueous 0.1 M NaOH solution. The concentration of dye in the solution was determined by monitoring its absorption peak using UV-Vis spectrometry (Perkin Elmer Lambda-25). The size of a dye molecule has been assumed 1.5 nm2.
The morphology and composition of the films were recorded using scanning electron microscopy (SEM Philips, XL30) equipped with EDS analyzer. The crystal structure of layers was analyzed by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD, X'Pert Pro MPD, PANalytical). IMPS and IMVS spectra were measured by Modulight (Ivium) coupled to CompactStat (Ivium). The white LED (425–660 nm) of Modulight at a constant luminous flux of 42.75 lm and a modulation amplitude of 10% of the bias illumination was employed for both intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements.
Results and discussions
Fig. 1a shows the top view of ZnO nanosheets grown on the substrate, which exhibit regular hexagonal-end plates with about 70 nm thickness. It can be observed that the surface of ZnO nanosheets is smooth, so the roughness factor is very low. Also it shows that the ZnO nanosheets grow vertically on the substrate. These ZnO nanosheets were used as templates and were subsequently converted to TiO2 nanosheets (Fig. 1b) via a one step dissolution/deposition process. The following reactions are involved in this dissolution/deposition process:24,27TiF62− + 2H2O → TiO2 + 6F− + 4H+H3BO3 + 4HF → HBF4 + 3H2OZnO + 2H+ → Zn2+ + H2O
 Fig. 1  SEM images of initial ZnO nanosheets array of FTO substrate (a) and converted TiO2 nanosheets (b). 
ZnO nanosheets dissolve into the solution by reacting with H3O+ which provides proper condition for the hydrolysis of TiF62− and subsequent condensation as deposited TiO2. As shown in Fig. 1b, TiO2 nanosheets nearly follow the original ZnO template structure, however with higher thickness (100–140 nm). Also the surface of TiO2 sheets is not as smooth as the original ZnO sheets, and the sheets are slightly bent. Bending could be attributed to stress build-up in the sheets in the process of chemical conversion and sintering. Similar effect has been observed for hollow porous TiO2 nanosheets.26
The process of conversion of ZnO sheets to TiO2 sheets involves a controlled balance between the dissolution of ZnO, and sol–gel deposition of TiO2 in place of ZnO. This balance occurs at certain pH, Ti precursor concentration and bath temperature. There have been reports of similar processes involving fabrication of TiO2 nanorod or nanotube from ZnO nanorod template.28–30 During this dissolution/deposition process, the cation exchange reaction between Zn2+ and Ti4+ ions occurs, which could be qualitatively understood in terms of hard–soft acid–base theory.31 Because Ti4+ is a harder acid compared to Zn2+, Ti4+ could bind strongly with the O2− anion to form TiO2. The conversion of ZnO to TiO2 is strongly favoured due to a thermodynamic driving force of about −249 kJ mol−1.
EDS data of Zn and Ti contents of the ZnO and TiO2 nanosheets were recorded at different times of the conversion process. The average contents of Zn and Ti as a function of time during the conversion process are shown in Table 1. This indicates that the deposition of TiO2 and removal of ZnO proceed simultaneously. It is noted that after 90 min all zinc content of initial ZnO layer has been removed, while about 90% of Zn is removed after about 10 min of reaction.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the ZnO and TiO2 nanosheet films before and after annealing process. After annealing, ZnO film shows a hexagonal structure. The diffraction peaks at 31.77°, 34.45° and 36.28° are indexed as ZnO lattice planes (100), (002) and (101), respectively (JCPDS 01-079-0207). The XRD pattern of as prepared ZnO nanosheets is presented in Fig. 2b, which indicates diffraction peaks of ITO and hexagonal ZnO as well as some diffraction peaks which could not be indexed to any compound in the Powder Diffraction File (PDF). As it can be seen in the XRD spectra, TiO2 nanosheets are in the anatase phase and the diffraction peaks at 25.28°, 38.28°, 48.08°, 55.18°, and 62.78° were observed, which corresponded to the (101), (103), (200), (211), and (204) planes of TiO2 anatase phase, respectively (JCPDS 01-086-1157). No ZnO diffraction peaks were observed, suggesting that ZnO was completely converted to TiO2 after the chemical transformation.

Nanosheet films of ZnO and TiO2 were used as photoanodes for fabricating DSCs. Fig. 3 shows the current density versus voltage characteristics of the fabricated DSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the fabricated cells are listed in Table 2. TiO2 nanosheets show clearly improved performance compared to the original ZnO nanosheet DSCs. For N719 dye, the conversion efficiency for ZnO nanosheet DSC is 0.46%, while for TiO2 nanosheets, the efficiency is increased to 2.4%. For D35 dye, the TiO2 cells exhibits slightly higher efficiency of 3.31%. These efficiencies are less than the efficiency of conventional nanoparticle TiO2 DSCs. This is due to the considerably smaller roughness factor of the nanosheets.

Voc of the ZnO device is considerably lower than TiO2 devices, as clearly observed in Fig. 3a. This is an indication that there is less accumulation of charge in ZnO compared to TiO2. Fig. 3b displays the data of charge extraction measurements for both ZnO and TiO2 devices. The data represents also the charge density as the morphology of the films is almost the same. One observes that for the same Voc, ZnO devices show higher extracted charge density. Alternatively, for identical extracted charge density, TiO2 devices result in higher Voc. This indicates that at open circuit condition, a larger part of the charge is lost via recombination in case of ZnO, compared to TiO2. The recombination problem in ZnO DSCs is a known effect, which is mainly attributed to dissolution of ZnO in dye solution and precipitation of Zn–dye complexes on the surface.32,33
The ZnO based solar cells show lower performance compared to TiO2 cells. Different reasons can be mentioned for it including the dissolution of ZnO and the formation of dye–Zn2+ aggregates,32,33 lower injection efficiency,32,33 lower dye regeneration efficiency33 and increased surface trap density after the dye adsorption.34 Because of the dye–Zn2+ aggregates, a large amount of inactive dye molecules remains in the film after the dye loading process, hence it is not possible to estimate the internal surface area by dye loading and de-loading method. However, this method can be used for TiO2 nanosheets, where a roughness factor of 100 is obtained for the TiO2 nanosheet film. This roughness factor is very low in comparison with the roughness factor of conventional mesoporous photoanodes (about 1000). By using a dye with higher extinction coefficient (D35, extinction coefficient = 30000) higher current density and better conversion efficiency can be obtained with these low surface area nanosheet electrodes.
IMVS and IMPS data were used for electron lifetime and electron transport time measurements. Fig. 4a shows the electron lifetime data versus the open circuit voltage. At a specific voltage, ZnO nanosheets exhibit the shortest lifetime, which may be explained by intensified recombination pathways in ZnO electrodes.34
 Fig. 4  Electron lifetime (a) and electron transport time (b) as determined by IMVS and IMPS measurements for DSCs fabricated from ZnO nanosheets () TiO2 nanosheets () and TiO2 nanoparticles photoanode (). 
TiO2 nanoparticle electrodes show slightly better lifetime, while lifetime values for TiO2 nanosheet electrodes is significantly longer. This enhancement can be due to lower surface area (about 10 times smaller), lower trap density and also band bending in nanosheets due to relatively high sheet thickness.35 Fig. 4b displays the electron transport time for the electrodes. ZnO and TiO2 nanosheets show considerably better transport time compared to the conventional nanoparticle electrode. TiO2 nanosheets exhibit even slightly better performance compared to ZnO nanosheets. As pointed out in the literature, ZnO is superior to TiO2 as regards to bulk conductivity, where the conductivity is not much affected by traps, defects, and grain boundaries. In contrast, the electron diffusion coefficients measured for nanostructured ZnO devices are similar or inferior to those encountered for nanostructured TiO2.36 Since electrodeposited ZnO structures are polycrystalline after annealing a better electron transport is not expected. This is an evidence for better transport properties of lower dimensional structures, which can confine the electrons to more directional random walk pathways, compared to the three dimensional random walk transport in the conventional electrodes.
Conclusions
A simple one-step method for the synthesis TiO2 nanosheet films is introduced. The process involves electrochemically grown ZnO nanosheets as the initial template, and a dissolution/deposition process to replace ZnO with TiO2. This creates a TiO2 replica of the ZnO nanosheets. The formed TiO2 nanosheets are Zn-free, and amorphous. They can be crystallized by heat treatment to be used as DSC electrodes. Despite the low roughness factor of 100, a conversion efficiency of 3.31% with D35 as sensitizer is achieved. The nanosheets show considerably better electron transport properties compared to the conventional nanoparticle electrodes. This opens opportunities for use of nanosheets in solar cell devices which do not require large surface area, such as colloidal quantum dot and perovskite solar cells.
