    , Accepted 16th June 2020First published on 17th June 2020AbstractPhotovoltaic performance of solar cells automatically improves when the absorber layer itself simultaneously acts as the anti-reflection nanostructure with an enhanced active absorber area on the front surface. Combined physical and chemical etching of p-c-Si wafers by (Ar + H2) plasma in inductively coupled low-pressure plasma CVD produces various nanostructures with subsequent minimization of reflectance. At a reduced temperature, the rate constant of thermal diffusion of atomic-H in the Si-network becomes smaller, leading to enhanced chemical etching reactions that further increase at an elevated RF power. Regrowth of the SiHn precursors produced by etching and subsequent hydrogenation in the plasma develops a high density of elongated nano-grass structures, which further align with sharp tips via Ar+ ion bombardment and elimination of loosely bound amorphous over-layers, on application of negative dc substrate bias during real-time etching and regrowth. A significantly reduced reflectance (∼0.5%) via coherent light trapping within the uniformly distributed vertically aligned nano-grass surfaces evolves truly black-silicon (b-Si) nanostructures, which further self-convert from the p-type to n-type electronic configuration via etching-mediated modification of B–H bonds from BH1 to BH2 and/or BH3 states, producing autogenic p/n junctions. Using (Ar + H2) plasma etched b-Si nano-grass structures at low temperature (∼200 °C), one-step fabrication of autogenic single p/n-junction proof-of-concept solar cells is accomplished. There is plenty of room for further progress in device performance.
1. Introduction
Silicon is the workhorse of the semiconductor industry. Apart from its innumerable applications in electronic device manufacturing, it has significant involvement in the photovoltaic sector. Si-based solar cell expertise is commonly divided into two categories involving (i) bulk silicon technology and (ii) thin-film silicon technology.1,2 Both for the bulk Si and thin film Si solar cells, the reflection loss of the incident light from the upper surface of the device is a significant concern. The reflection loss can be reduced by using an anti-reflection coating on the front surface of the device to enhance its conversion efficiency.3,4 Apart from using additional anti-reflection coating layers, the reflection loss can be reduced by self-generating different silicon nano-structures (Si-NSs), e.g., nano-wires, nano-pillars, nano-tips, etc., which can efficiently trap light simultaneously to dominantly absorb it by virtue of the associated enhanced surface area.5–12 The silicon nanostructures possessing low reflectance <2% are called ‘black-silicon’ (b-Si).13 The black-silicon categorically includes silicon nano-wires (Si-NWs),14 nano-tips (Si-NTPs),15,16 nano-grasses (Si-NGs),17 nano-cones (Si-NCs),18 nano-pillars (Si-NPLs),19etc.
Various approaches have been adopted to minimize the reflection losses via surface texturing by anisotropic etching of single crystalline silicon20,21 generally in aqueous alkaline solution, by the inverted-pyramid surface texturing used in monocrystalline Si ‘passivated emitter rear locally-diffused’ (PERL) solar cells,22 by isotropic etching of multicrystalline silicon wafers forming a hexagonally symmetric honeycomb surface texture,23 or by producing a fine nanometer scale textured surface, e.g., porous silicon (PS),24 which is rather physically fragile and difficult to reproduce. In a different perspective, minimization of surface reflection has been attempted in subwavelength-scale nano-textured Si arrays via mimicking a moth-eye principle,25–27 Apart from the most commonly used anisotropic etching of single crystalline Si with aqueous alkaline solution, isotropic texturing of the microcrystalline Si via stain etching in acidic solution containing HF and HNO3 produces anti-reflection structures of sub-micrometer dimensions.28,29 Metal-induced selective etching of Si wafers in aqueous HF solution is another process to produce an anti-reflective surface consisting of vertically aligned silicon nanowire arrays at a low cost and even at room temperature, mostly using Ag,30–36 Au,21,37 and also Cu, Pt, Pd, etc.38 In general, in acid-based wet chemical processes, the composition of etching solution changes with time, provided the components are replenished continuously, and the exothermic nature of the reactions makes it difficult to precisely control the solution temperature, and after all, the residual metal atoms remaining attached to the nanostructures deteriorate the device characteristics via reducing the minority carrier lifetime, dominantly affecting in the case of nanostructures grown by the Au-assisted process. Furthermore, a solution-based metal-assisted chemical etching technique suffers from the agglomeration of nano-structures during drying due to van der Waals and capillary forces between the adjacent surfaces at the interface between liquid and air, and, thereby, generally limits their applications in domains where the surface is directly related to the device efficiency. In this context, metal-assisted chemical etching of Si in the gas phase, in a better way, provides the possibility of a low-cost method for growing high aspect ratio nanostructures.39
Plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PE-CVD) is a versatile technique which can precisely control the growth of uniform nanostructures repetitively via a purely dry plasma process40,41 compared to the wet chemical bath etching process.42 Among different PE-CVD systems, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) CVD is the most effective one to produce dense and uniform nano-structures because of its remote plasma configuration, high electron density and low-pressure plasma sustainability.43,44 Following a top-down process, commonly (SF6 + O2) gases are used to produce the nano-structures of silicon.45,46 Pure SF6 is colourless and odourless; however, because of having a high molecular weight it can displace oxygen and cause suffocation.47 Furthermore, it is a high-potential greenhouse gas and generates toxic fluoride by-products of sulphur, e.g., S2F10.48 In contrast, H2 is light, chemically active and environment friendly,49–52 while Ar is normally inert and non-polluting.53,54
The primary objective of the current investigation is to deliver black silicon (b-Si) structures of virtually reflection-free optical response, by the reactive ion etching technique in ICP-CVD, using H2 and (Ar + H2) plasma separately, on single-crystal Si-wafer substrates. Varieties of b-Si nanostructures have been produced by changing the physical parameters, e.g., plasma etching time, substrate temperature and substrate bias, at different plasma parameters maintained by changing the gas pressure and the applied RF power. Furthermore, by performing the p-to-n type conductivity conversion (PTNCC) via changes in the B–H configuration in p-type c-Si, spontaneous formation of single p/n-junction solar cells has been pursued using a one-step perpetual process.
2. Experimental details
For producing black silicon (b-Si) structures on a single-crystal silicon (c-Si) wafer, H2 plasma or (Ar + H2) plasma was used in a planar inductively coupled RF (13.56 MHz) plasma chemical vapour deposition system (ICP-CVD) with a low-inductance (0.54 μH) four antenna planar spiral copper coil, as shown in a schematic diagram in Fig. 1. This system possesses the usable limit of 1000 W RF power, 500 °C substrate temperature with ±500 V substrate dc bias, and a low working gas pressure of several mTorr. Boron-doped p-type (111) c-Si wafers of resistivity 1–10 Ω cm and thickness ∼500 μm were cleaned by the normal RCA cleaning process, followed by dipping in 5% HF for 30 s and then drying with a N2 gas flow before mounting in the load lock chamber of the ICP-CVD system. The base vacuum of the reactive chamber was found to be 7 × 10−7 Torr before the plasma etching treatment on the polished side of the (1.5 × 1.5) cm2 Si wafers. The room temperature optical reflection in the UV–visible region was obtained in the diffuse reflection mode using an integrating sphere in the Hitachi U-4100 spectrometer. The surface morphology was studied using a Veeco (di CP-II) atomic force microscope (AFM; Bruker AXS, Mannheim, Germany). The growth morphology was obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; JEOL JSM-6700F, Japan). In addition, the p-to-n type conductivity conversion (PTNCC) effect facilitated single-step growth of p-Si/n-Si:H single-junction solar cells. The current–voltage characteristics of the autogenic single p/n-junction solar cells were obtained via normal illumination on a (0.8 × 0.8) cm2 irradiated area of the cell structure, using an AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination solar simulator (WACOM) and a Keithley 2400 source meter.

3. Results and discussion
A. Effect of etching duration by H2 or (Ar + H2) plasma on the c-Si wafer surface
In the ICP-CVD system, H2 or (Ar + H2) plasma was produced from a 25 sccm total flow of the gas mixture maintained at 50 mTorr chamber pressure with 500 W of RF power. The p-type crystalline silicon (p-c-Si) wafers, after RCA cleaning and HF wet etching, were maintained at 450 °C temperature (TE) and plasma etching was performed during different etching time spans (tE) varying from 0.5 to 8 h. The initial two sets of etched samples prepared by the exposure of H2 plasma or (Ar + H2) plasma, with the Ar/H2 ratio (Γ) of 1.5, are termed Set-IA and Set-IB, respectively.
The reflectance spectra of the Set-IA etched samples along with that for a virgin Si wafer (without plasma treatment) are shown in Fig. 2(a). An inherent rapid reduction in reflectance, R(%), over the span of wavelength below 450 nm was noted for both the bare Si wafer as well as some of the samples etched with a shorter time span, tE ≤ 1 h. At a longer wavelength, however, the reflectance gradually reached virtual saturation, with a lower magnitude at increased tE. At tE ≥ 2 h, the entire reflection spectrum attained horizontal line shapes with a gradually reduced magnitude at extended tE. Accordingly, for a fair comparison, changes in R occurring due to plasma etching on Si wafers were noted at two different wavelengths, R300 and R550, corresponding to λ = 300 nm and 550 nm, respectively. On extended H2-plasma etching, the reflectance, R300, of the etched Si samples reduced from 79.3% for tE = 0 h (bare Si) to 70.0% for tE = 1 h, and then suddenly reduced to 22.9% for tE = 2 h. R300 attained its minimum of ∼4.81% for tE = 4 h; however, slightly enhanced to 6.88% for tE = 8 h. The reflectance, R550, however, reduced gradually from 34% for bare Si to a minimum of ∼1.83% for tE = 4 h and then elevated a bit to ∼2.86% on further extended etching for tE = 8 h, as shown in Fig. 2(b).

Now, for the Set-IB samples, etched by (Ar + H2) plasma with (Γ = Ar/H2 = 1.5), similar changes in reflectance are shown in Fig. 3(a) and the corresponding variations in R550 with etching time tE are shown in Fig. 3(b). Two major changes are noted in the case of the (Ar + H2) plasma etching, compared to that of H2 plasma etching instances. Substantial reduction in R550 from 34% for bare Si to ∼3.89% occurred very fast, only by a time span of etching tE ∼ 2 h (compared to ∼22.9% for a similar period of etching by the H2 plasma). Furthermore, R550 reduced monotonically with etching time (tE) being different from that of the H2 plasma etching case, and reached ∼3.12% at tE ∼ 4 h and a significantly low magnitude ∼0.53% at tE ∼ 8 h.

The 3D AFM surface morphologies of the H2 plasma-etched silicon Set-IA samples along with the bare Si wafer are shown in Fig. 4(a–f). The estimated RMS surface roughness and the surface area of each sample are plotted in Fig. 4(g), as a function of etching duration (tE). The RMS roughness increased very promptly up to 70 nm and also the corresponding surface area to 115 μm2 for tE = 4 h; however, on extended etching for 8 h, the surface roughness and the surface area both reduced significantly.

(g) The calculated RMS roughness and effective surface area of the samples. (h) Comparative histogram presentation on the RMS roughness of the etched samples obtained from the reflectance spectra and the AFM morphology. 
The RMS roughness of each H2 plasma-etched silicon sample was also obtained from the reflection spectra using the relation:55 (1)where RS is the specular reflectance of the roughened sample surface, RO is that of the smooth surface of the unetched Si wafer, Rrms is the root mean square (RMS) roughness, and λ is the wavelength of incident light. All the data were taken at λ = 550 nm, where R (%) had a negligible wavelength dependence. Accordingly, the RMS roughness of the etched silicon sample was estimated as: (2)
The RMS roughness of the H2 plasma-etched silicon samples, as estimated from the reflectance data and from the AFM morphology, has been compared via the histograms in Fig. 4(h). The reduced reflection loss of the etched samples arose due to the enhanced multiple reflections from the roughened surface produced by atomic hydrogen exposure and the subsequent incremental increase in absorbance.56 Furthermore, the close similarity in the magnitude and the nature of variations in RMS roughness from the spectroscopic and microscopic data showed genuine alteration in the surface morphology of the c-Si sample beyond 4 h of H2 plasma etching that led to the subsequent minor increase in the reflectance from the surface of the concerned etched sample, as seen from Fig. 2(b).
For the Set-IB c-Si samples etched by the (Ar + H2) plasma with (Γ = Ar/H2 = 1.5), similar changes in the 3D surface morphology obtained by AFM study are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b) for the etching duration tE = 0.5 h and 8 h, respectively. Prominent c-Si nanopillar-like structures were grown on the surface via (Ar + H2) plasma etching. The RMS surface roughness as well as the surface area both increased to 242.4 nm and 156.3 μm2, respectively, which were much higher in magnitudes compared to the H2 plasma etching instances; furthermore, those enhanced monotonically with an extended duration of etching (tE) until 8 h, being different in nature from that of the H2 plasma etching event. The spontaneously reduced reflectance (R550) (Fig. 3(b)) associated with the monotonically increased RMS roughness (Fig. 5(c)) showed that the reflection loss could be arbitrarily minimized via modification of the surface morphology of the etched c-Si samples by extended (Ar + H2) plasma exposure.57

Fig. 6(a–d) show the FE-SEM images of the H2 plasma-etched Set-IA samples. With an etching time, tE ∼ 0.5 h, the c-Si surface ruptured almost randomly with tiny white patches non-uniformly distributed on it, which arose due to the regrowth from the plasma species. On plasma exposure for tE = 2 h, the surface etching appeared more prominent with an increased number of larger size grown-up particles. At tE = 4 h, tiny pyramid-like etched structures were formed with one nano-sized particle grown on top of each pyramid [Fig. 6(c)]. Such a structure made the surface more uneven that contributed in trapping the incident light efficiently and reducing the reflection loss significantly [Fig. 2(b)].58 On further extended etching with tE = 8 h, the etched surface was ruptured like platelets with larger size particles grown on those; however, the overall surface roughness reduced, and thereby, the reflectance increased marginally.

Using (Ar + H2) plasma in ICP-CVD, the Set-IB c-Si sample etched for an optimum period, tE = 4 h, that revealed <2% reflectance, showed surface textures, as shown by the FE-SEM image in Fig. 7(a). The high-resolution image in Fig. 7(b) exhibited high-density silicon nano-pillar-like structures of closely similar diameters and alignment, but of different lengths, grown on the etched surface.

The available electron density in the low-pressure ICP-CVD plasma (n0 ∼ 1012 cm−3 at 10 mTorr) was much higher than the conventional capacitively coupled plasma CVD system, which facilitated efficient plasma etching. The reactivity of molecular hydrogen on the silicon surfaces was low. However, atomic and ionic hydrogen possessed reasonable chemical affinity, and the Si–H bond strength (∼366 kJ mol−1) being superior to that of bulk Si–Si bonds (∼226 kJ mol−1), atomic and ionic hydrogen could break the Si–Si bonds and produce a variety of silicon hydride species, e.g., SiH2 and SiH3 on the surface.59,60 The ionic hydrogen was produced by the following chemical reactions within the plasma:61H2 + e− → H2+ + 2e,H2+ + H2 → H3+ + H˙,H3+ + e− → H2 + H˙
Furthermore, the ionic hydrogen (H˙) formed bonds with the surface silicon atoms of c-Si wafer and produced different SiHn (n = 1–4) radicals, following probable chemical reactions:62H˙ + −Si → H − Si (adsorption),H˙ + H − Si → H – H(g) + −Si (abstraction),H˙ + Si − Si → H − Si + −Si (insertion),H˙ + Si − SiH3 → SiH4(g) + −Si (etching).
Finally, within the H2 plasma in ICP-CVD, the c-Si wafer surface experienced chemical etching by atomic and ionic hydrogen and picked up different patterns, e.g., nano-pyramid-like structures. Some ionic hydrogen was bonded with the surface silicon atoms at lower potential positions, blocked the site and acted as resistive caps for further chemical etching. Furthermore, the SiHn (n = 1–4) precursors generated in the plasma from the etched silicon moieties were redeposited on the dangling silicon bonds of the c-Si surface.63 The new depositions on the tip of nano-pyramid-like structures might be of amorphous or crystalline nature, as controlled by the temperature of the growth site; these might also be further etched out with time, depending on the plasma parameters. Under low-pressure plasma conditions, the density of the SiHn (n = 1–4) growth precursors remained low and their stay-time in the plasma happened to be short; accordingly, a few of these got the opportunity to redeposit on the etched surface and finally formed small growth-structures, as shown in Fig. 6.
Furthermore, in the presence of Ar and H2 molecules together in the plasma, ionic hydrogen and argon with its excited state (Ar*) were produced by the following reactions:64Ar + e → Ar+ + 2e,Ar+ + H2 → ArH+ + H˙,ArH+ + e− → Ar* + H˙,ArH+ + H2 → H3+ + Ar,Ar* + H2 → Ar + H2*,H2* → 2H˙.
In addition to the chemical etching process pursued by the atomic H, the physical etching process was accomplished by the Ar+ ions and plenty of ionic H˙. The SiHn (n = 1–4) precursors became surplus and these were redeposited on the dangling Si bonds of the c-Si surface in a larger volume fraction.62,65,66 High-density Si nano-pillar-like structures were, thereby, grown on the etched c-Si surface, as shown in Fig. 7.
B. Effects of varying H2 plasma pressure, RF power and etching temperature on the c-Si wafers
A radical change in the etching performance was identified by lowering the gas pressure in the plasma and simultaneously increasing the applied RF power. At a low pressure of 30 mTorr and an increased RF power of 700 W, 4 h of H2 plasma etching at 450 °C produced a step-like surface morphology, as shown by the FESEM micrograph in Fig. 8(a), and its corresponding AFM morphology in Fig. 8(b). Furthermore, at a low plasma pressure of 30 mTorr, lowering the etching temperature to 200 °C significantly changed the surface texture of the etched samples. A high density of homogeneously distributed uniform Si nano-pyramid-like structures with a dimension varying from 50 nm to 500 nm were obtained at an applied RF power of 500 W, as shown in the FESEM micrograph in Fig. 8(c), and the corresponding AFM morphology in Fig. 8(d). Multiple internal reflections within the uniformly distributed pyramid shaped nano-structured surface led towards coherent light trapping and subsequent minimization of reflection loss in the visible spectrum, with R550 < 1%, that made the etched c-Si sample an ideal active material for solar cells. Furthermore, at a lower TE = 200 °C and low pressure at 30 mTorr, when the applied RF power was increased to 700 W, very sharp and long nano-tip (spike)-like dense structures were produced, as shown in Fig. 8(e), with its corresponding AFM image in Fig. 8(f). The high-density Si nano-tip (spike) structures grown via low temperature plasma etching exhibited ideal black Si (b-Si)-like features with corresponding R550 < 0.7% (inset of Fig. 8(e)).
 Fig. 8  The FE-SEM images of H2 plasma etched Si-nanostructures prepared at low-pressure with (a) high-temperature and high-power, (c) low-temperature and low-power, and (e) low-temperature (200 °C) and high-power (700 W), plasma parameters (corresponding reflectance spectra shown in the inset). The corresponding 3-D AFM morphology of the etched samples is shown in (b), (d) and (f), respectively. 
At a low gas pressure, the atomic and ionic H in the plasma possessed longer diffusion lengths, higher velocities and increased momentums. Furthermore, at higher RF power, the number density of the atomic and ionic H in the plasma enhanced systematically, until saturation limited by the flow rate of H2 was attained. Altogether, lower pressure and higher RF power sequentially increased the etching efficiency of the H2 plasma. It is proposed that atomic H from the plasma interacted with the c-Si wafer in two feasible ways. Atomic H saturated the surface dangling bonds by forming Si–H and SiH2 bonding configurations, and surface etching occurred via the reaction of Si-H2 with a weakly bound mobile overlayer of hydrogen atoms.67 Furthermore, atomic H thermally diffused within the bulk of the material. The surface etching process advanced competing with the bulk diffusion events across the surface. At a reduced temperature, the rate constant of the thermal diffusion weakened, leaving a larger number of atomic H to contribute to the etching reactions. Consequently, the etching rate of the c-Si wafer enhanced at a low temperature of plasma exposure, as evidenced in Fig. 8.68,69
C. Effects of varying (Ar + H2) plasma pressure, RF power, etching temperature and dc bias applied to the c-Si wafers
Using (Ar + H2) plasma on c-Si wafers at 450 °C, samples were prepared by 4 h of etching, at an increased pressure of 100 mTorr at 500 W of RF power. The corresponding FE-SEM image of the silicon nanostructures (Si-NSs) has been shown in Fig. 9(a). At higher chamber pressure, relatively feeble chemical etching by the atomic H and ionic Ar reduced the rate of formation of SiHn precursors with lower internal energy.
 Fig. 9  (a) Silicon nano-pillar-like structure grown at 100 mTorr, 500 W, and (b) silicon nano-root-like structure grown at 100 mTorr, 700 W; by (Ar + H2) plasma etching of the c-Si wafers at 450 °C. 
However, the extended stay time of the precursors at elevated pressure increased their number density in the plasma. The regrowth of the SiHn precursors on energetically favourable as well as unpassivated silicon sites on the etched surface produced crystalline silicon nano-pillar-like structures of uniform diameter, length and alignment, aided via chemical etching by atomic H in the plasma.70,71 Multiple internal reflections from the nano-pillar structures and efficient light trapping resulted in a lower reflectance of R550 ∼ 2.61%, compared to ∼3.12% at p = 50 mTorr.
Furthermore, increasing the RF power to 700 W, a huge number of SiHn (n = 1–4) precursor radicals were generated in the plasma due to significantly enhanced etching of the c-Si surface, and the available precursors initiated a very rapid redeposition on the etched surface, leading to the growth of nano-root-like structures of mostly amorphous configuration, as shown in Fig. 9(b).72
Now, using (Ar + H2) plasma at 100 mTorr pressure and 500 W of applied RF power for 4 h on c-Si wafers maintained at a lower temperature of TE ∼ 200 °C, very high density and long nano-grass-like structures were produced, as shown in Fig. 10(a). The magnified FE-SEM image of the etched Si-NSs in Fig. 10(b) confirmed that the nano-grass-like structures were much wider in diameter at the top, probably indicating that the regrowth rate from the silicon precursors spontaneously increased on time, leading towards the growth of amorphous-dominated structures at a higher rate, because of the available lower growth temperature.69,73 Longer nano-grasses initiated better light trapping and reduced the reflection loss further, as plotted in the inset of Fig. 10(b). R550 decreased from 2.61% to 1.10% in the case of Si-NSs grown at etching temperature (TE) reduced from 450 to 200 °C. The blunt head and little curvy structure of the nano-grasses were eliminated and relatively stiff and vertically aligned parallel nano-grasses were obtained on further application of a negative substrate dc bias of −20 V during plasma etching, as shown in Fig. 10(c). Further reduction in reflectance, shown in the inset of Fig. 10(d), identified the growth of virtually black-silicon (b-Si) structures, which deserve strategic utilization in the fabrication of solar cells.
 Fig. 10  FE-SEM image of the c-Si wafer samples after (Ar + H2) plasma etching in ICP-CVD at low temperature, TE = 200 °C (a and b) without any substrate bias, and (c and d) with the application of −20 V of dc substrate bias. The insets shown on the high-resolution images (b) and (d) compare the reflectance data corresponding to the changes in plasma etching temperature (TE) and application of negative dc bias, respectively. 
Because of the presence of both H2 and Ar in the plasma, an increased etching rate from the c-Si surface produced plenty of SiHn (n = 1–4) growth precursors, which at further increased pressure contributed significant redeposition. The metastable state of the noble gas Ar, denoted as Ar*, contributed neutral reactions with chemically reactive plasma precursors and influenced the radical transformation process.50,66 Ar itself importantly acted in controlling the quality of the redeposited growth structures through the bombardment by Ar* on the surface. The energy released by the de-excitation of Ar* facilitated in structural reorientation and subsequent nanocrystallization, producing Si nano-pillar-like structures, as shown in Fig. 9(a). The Ar* density was determined by the Ar dilution in the gas mixture and the applied RF power. A significant increase in the growth rate at higher RF power (700 W) evidenced effectively amorphous and longer nano-root-like structures in Fig. 9(b). Furthermore, at moderate RF power (500 W), a relatively low density of precursors on a low temperature growth site produced long nano-grass-like structures, which on a longer growth event formed amorphous bulbs at the top. In the solid-state chemical reactions at the subsurface of the growth structures, application of negative dc bias might cause Ar+ ion bombardment and subsequent elimination of the loosely bound amorphous overlayers, making these relatively straight and vertically aligned with sharp tips (Fig. 10).
D. p-to-n type conductivity conversion (PTNCC) and one-step fabrication of autogenic single p/n-junction
During the chemical etching of c-Si wafer, the atomic H from the plasma eventually diffused within the p-type c-Si matrix of the wafer. The diffused hydrogen atom (H) could make different bonding configurations with the boron (B) dopants within the Si network. The main three probable boron-hydrogen configurations are the following:
(a) One hydrogen–boron centre in the BH1 configuration may take place in two possible ways: (i) Hbs, the H atom occupying the position within the B–Si bond [Fig. 11(a)], and (ii) Hss, the H atom sited at the Si–Si bond centre near the B atom [Fig. 11(b)]. Considering the binding energy, the Hbs configuration is more stable than Hss;74 however, both are electrically neutral pairs in the Si matrix and do not affect the type of conductivity of the material. This neutral BH1 pair behaves as an impurity within the p-Si network.75
 Fig. 11  The different configurations of dopant B with H as (a) Hbs and (b) Hss, one hydrogen–boron centre (BH1), (c) B-2Hss and (d) B-2Hss′, two hydrogen–boron centre (BH2), (e) B-3Hss and (f) B-3H′, three hydrogen–boron centre (BH3). 
(b) Two hydrogen–boron centre (BH2) is electrically n-type in nature, which has two stable bond structures: (i) B-2Hss, two H atoms located at the centre of two Si–Si bonds near the B atom [Fig. 11(c)], (ii) B-2Hss′, two H atoms sited at the centre of two Si–Si bonds with the same Si of four neighbours [Fig. 11(d)].74 The energy levels are likely to develop towards the conduction band of the more stable B-2Hss′ bond via the formation of free electrons of the hydrogen weak bonds.76 This configurational donor, known as a single shallow thermal donor (STD), eventually converts the material to electrically n-type.77
(c) Three hydrogen–boron centre (BH3) is also electrically n-type in nature, which can be formed in two possible configurations: (i) B-3Hss, three H atoms sited at the bond centre of three Si–Si bonds near the dopant B atom [Fig. 11(e)], and (ii) B-3H′, three H atoms lying approximately along the [001] direction of the crystalline silicon lattice from the B atom [Fig. 11(f)]. Energetically B-3H′ is more stable than the B-3Hss structure.74 The BH3 configuration is energetically more stable and electrically more n-type compared to BH2 due to the presence of an increased number of STDs together.77,78
Accordingly, the p-type c-Si can be converted into n-type via the conversion from BH1 to BH2 and/or BH3 configurations, as elucidated by Wolkenstein theory.79
In the present experiment, the p-type c-Si has eventually been converted into n-type Si:H (hydrogenated silicon) through etching by H2 or (Ar + H2) plasma in ICP-CVD and further by redeposition on the etched Si surface, forming n-type Si nano-tip/nano-rod/nano-grass-like structures at the top, thereby, facilitating one-step fabrication of the autogenic single p/n-junction via a p-to-n type conductivity conversion (PTNCC) avenue.80
E. Fabrication of solar cells from the plasma-etched autogenic p/n-junction

(i) H2 plasma-etched Si nano-tip solar cells. 

Fig. 12(a) shows the schematic diagram concerning sequential steps for the fabrication of single p/n-junction solar cells via utilization of the PTNCC mechanism by H2 plasma etching on p-type c-Si wafers, including the solar cell measuring configuration. The back surface of the cell was coated with metallic aluminium (Al), deposited by thermal evaporation, and the front contact was made with an Al thin film grid type electrode, as shown in Fig. 12(a). This specific shape of the front contact helped for a better collection of the charge carriers photogenerated at the p/n-junction.

(b) The current-density vs voltage and power-density vs voltage plots with open-circuit voltage (VOC), sort-circuit current density (JSC), fill-factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η), shown in the inset. 
The current-density vs. voltage (J–V) and power-density vs. voltage (Φ–V) characteristic curves of the PTNCC c-Si p/n-junction solar cells produced by H2 plasma etching are shown in Fig. 12(b). A conversion efficiency, η ∼ 1.34%, was obtained for the etched Si nano-tip solar cells prepared at P = 700 W, p = 30 mTorr, TE = 200 °C, with VOC = 0.22 V, JSC = 14.40 mA cm−2, and FF = 42.30% by the following relations:81,82 (3)and (4)where Pmax is the maximum output power of the device and Pin is the input power incident on a solar cell with a solar simulator (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5).
A better charge collection by the front contact was initiated by introducing an optimized ITO layer grown by RF magnetron sputtering83 on the etched structure, as schematically shown in Fig. 13(a), along with the corresponding J–V and Φ–V characteristic curves in Fig. 13(b). The ITO layers, which on glass substrates possess a low resistivity ∼1.7 × 10−4 Ω cm with a corresponding figure-of-merit ∼4.15 × 10−2 Ω−1,84 helped enhancing the short-circuit current density (JSC) from 14.4 to 31.7 mA cm−2 and increasing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) marginally from 0.22 to 0.23 V. Also, the fill factor (FF) increased from 42.3% to 43.61%, and, as a combination effect, the conversion efficiency enhanced from 1.34 to 3.18%.

(ii) (Ar + H2) plasma-etched Si nano-grass solar cells. 
The p-type c-Si wafer surface that was efficiently etched by (Ar + H2) plasma ignited at 500 W of RF power, 100 mTorr pressure of the gas mixture maintaining Γ(Ar/H2) = 1.5, at a low TE ∼ 200 °C, and spontaneously re-deposited by the precursors from the plasma producing Si nano-grass-like structures with n-type conductivity obtained via the PTNCC mechanism was used as the effective p/n-junction and was covered by Al electrodes in the front and back surface, as shown in Fig. 14(a). The solar cell characteristic curves are shown in Fig. 14(b) and (c) corresponding to Si nano-grass-like structures produced without and with the application of a substrate bias of −20 V, respectively. The vertically aligned Si nano-grass structures produced with a negative substrate bias accomplished lower refection loss that produced marginally higher short-circuit-current (JSC) and a trivial increase in the conversion efficiency (η) of the solar cell from 1.81% to 1.97%.

By introducing an optimized RF magnetron sputtered ITO layer of ∼80 nm thickness and further using Ag dots on the ITO layer as the front contact and silver-paste layer on the back as another contact, solar cell structures were fabricated (Fig. 15(a)). A significant increase in the short-circuit current (JSC) from 16.8 mA cm–2 to 36.6 mA cm−2 without bias, and from 18.2 mA cm−2 to 38.4 mA cm−2 with −20 V dc bias applied during nano-grass growth showed a substantial enhancement in the conversion efficiency (η) to ∼4.22% and ∼4.41%, respectively. Thus, the current effort shows the systematic development of virtually reflection-free (R550 < 1%) black silicon (b-Si) nano-tip and nano-grass structures by significantly low temperature (TE ∼ 200 °C) H2 or (Ar + H2) plasma etching in high-density and low-pressure inductively coupled plasma CVD. Furthermore, its application in the low-temperature and single-step fabrication of solar cells has been accomplished, using p/n-junctions self-generated via a p-to-n-type conductivity conversion (PTNCC) mechanism.

Previous reports on the surface passivation studies of silicon nanowires prepared by metal nano-particle-assisted chemical etching combined with stain etching treatment showed that the electronic quality of the Si-NWs improved, facilitating its photovoltaic applications. It was revealed that the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff) enhanced to ∼10 μs in Si-NWs compared to ∼1 μs for the Si-wafers, by virtue of significant reduction in surface recombination velocity (Seff) to ∼16.5 cm s−1 compared to 165 cm s−1 in its wafer counterpart.32 There are other reports available in the literature.31,36 For the present Si nanostructures, effective surface passivation by SiHx species or passivation of the Si surface dangling bonds by atomic H of the plasma could limit the surface recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers and potentially favor the cell performance via enhancement of the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff). Still, the ultimate efficiencies of the developed solar cells are certainly far below the expected efficiency from the state-of-the-art c-Si solar cells.62,85 There lies plenty of room for further improvement in the conversion efficiency, e.g., via selection of a suitably thin c-Si wafer (presently used available wafers are quite thick, ∼500 μm) so as to grossly reduce the bulk recombination and enable the convenient diffusion of photogenerated charge carriers to transport to the external circuit before being restricted by the trapping centres, and optimization in the cell fabrication steps, e.g., proper utilization of the electrodes, in terms of choice of materials, their plasma compatible growth process, contamination-free growth sequence and efficient finger-grid configuration, which all are truly beyond our presently available scope of supply.

4. Conclusion
The reflection loss from the upper surface of solar cells is a significant concern, limiting the conversion efficiency of the device, and that could be virtually eliminated by self-generating anti-reflection nano-structures on the front surface that simultaneously increases the active area of the absorber layer, facilitating enhanced performance.
Extended chemical etching pursued by the atomic H of the H2-plasma on p-c-Si wafers at 450 °C produced tiny pyramid-like etched nanostructures with minimized reflectance, limited to R550 ≤ 2%. At an elevated RF power and moderate etching temperature TE ∼ 200 °C, high-density Si nano-tip (spike)-like structures with minimization of reflection loss to R550 ∼ 0.68%, produced by H2-plasma etching, exhibited black-Si (b-Si) features as an ideal active material for solar cells. At low TE, the rate constant of thermal diffusion of atomic H into the bulk weakened, facilitating atomic H to significantly contribute to the chemical etching reactions on the surface and thereby, the etching rate increased.
Combined physical and chemical etching, accomplished by the Ar ions and plenty of atomic H in the (Ar + H2) plasma, initiated efficient etching of the Si-wafer, producing ample atomic Si which subsequently generated SiHn precursors via hydrogenation in the plasma. The regrowth of the SiHn precursors on energetically favourable as well as unpassivated Si sites on the etched surface produced Si-nanostructures, the physical configuration of which was mostly controlled by the temperature of the growth site and other plasma parameters. Crystalline-like Si nano-pillar structures of uniform diameter, length and alignment were obtained at TE ∼ 450 °C; however, at elevated RF power significantly enhanced etching of c-Si and subsequently increased available precursor density initiated a very rapid redeposition on the etched surface, leading to the growth of nano-root-like structures of mostly amorphous configuration. At low TE ∼ 200 °C and moderate RF power, faster growth from optimally available precursor density produced very high density and long nano-grass-like structures, which on a longer growth event formed amorphous bulbs at the top. Application of negative dc bias initiated Ar+ ion bombardment and eliminated the loosely bound amorphous over-layers, making these relatively straight with sharp tips. Further reduction in reflectance (R550 ∼ 0.53%) via multiple internal reflections within the uniformly distributed vertically aligned nano-grass surfaces and coherent light trapping evolved truly black-silicon (b-Si) structures, which deserved strategic utilization in the fabrication of solar cells.
The atomic hydrogen from the plasma can diffuse within the p-type c-Si matrix of the wafer during chemical etching, and also via the solid-state chemical reactions at the subsurface of the growth structures. These diffused hydrogen atoms (H) make different bonding structures with the boron (B) dopants within the Si network and transform the p-type c-Si into n-type via modification of BH1 to BH2 and/or BH3 configurations via a p-to-n type conductivity conversion (PTNCC) avenue.
Low temperature (200 °C) and single-step fabrication of solar cells was realized, using Si-nanotip or Si-nanograss structured autogenic p/n-junctions via utilization of the PTNCC mechanism initiated by H2 or (Ar + H2) plasma etching on p-type c-Si wafers. The ultimate efficiency (∼4.41%) of the developed solar cell is certainly far below the expected efficiency of state-of-the-art c-Si solar cells. However, the current effort shows the low temperature growth of virtually reflection-free (R550 < 1%) vertically aligned black silicon (b-Si) nano-tip/nano-grass structures by dry plasma etching at a moderate temperature; further, its proof-of-concept application in the single-step fabrication of autogenic p/n-junction solar cells. There lies plenty of room for future advancement via selection of a suitable thickness of c-Si wafer and proper optimization in the technical steps of cell fabrication, including the use of a contamination-free growth sequence of the electrodes with its efficient finger-grid configuration.
