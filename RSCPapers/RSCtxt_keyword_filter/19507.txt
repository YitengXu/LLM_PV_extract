    , Accepted 16th March 2022First published on 16th March 2022AbstractThe potential of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on synthesized D–A–π–A-type dyes with a 9-(p-tolyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole building block as a donor fragment was explored. The influence of the structure of the internal acceptor and of the π-spacer on the optical and photovoltaic properties of the NIK series sensitizers was revealed. Dyes based on benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, which is a stronger electron-withdrawing unit than 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline, showed a bathochromic shift of the absorption band corresponding to intermolecular charge transfer, and incorporation of the 4,4-diethylhexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene π-bridge (NIK119) instead of thiophene (NIK88) resulted in the highest extinction coefficient among all the studied dyes in the UV-vis spectra. The presence of branched alkyl substituents in NIK119 as well as in NIK99 did not allow reaching a high absorption of these sensitizers on a TiO2 surface, so the solar cells based on them showed low short-circuit current values and, as a consequence, a low power conversion efficiency (PCE). On the other hand, the absence of bulky groups in the structure of the sensitizer sharply increases charge recombination and dye aggregation, which causes the dramatic drop in PCE for NIK88. The optimal ratio between the concentration of dyes on a TiO2 surface and the electronic effects of individual blocks was achieved for the NIK97 dye based on unsubstituted 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline, for which a PCE value of 5.68% was obtained using CDCA as a co-adsorbent.

Design, System, Application
New metal-free organic sensitizers of D–A–π–A type with a 9-(p-tolyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole donor building block have been synthesized and used in the design of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The effect of the structural features of dyes on their optical and photovoltaic properties was studied by varying the internal acceptors and π-spacers. Incorporation of branched alkyl substituents in both the acceptor and the π-bridging parts of the molecules leads, on the one hand, to higher extinction coefficients in the UV-vis spectra, but to a decrease in the concentration of dyes on the TiO2 surface, on the other hand. Determination of the photovoltaic characteristics showed the latter factor to be the most significant, and dyes with bulky substituents showed a low overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). At the same time, dyes without alkyl chains were prone to charge aggregation and recombination, which also reduced the PCE values. Unsubstituted 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline proved to be the most optimal internal acceptor, providing a sufficiently high steric load and the necessary electronic effects, which resulted in the highest PCE among the DSSCs studied. Thus, it was shown that incorporation of bulky structural elements as well as their absence leads to low resulting characteristics, and the need to maintain a balance in the molecular design of sensitizers for DSSCs was proved.

1 Introduction
The problem of finding alternative energy sources based on renewable resources has led to an explosive growth in the number of studies dealing with the production of clean electricity by sunlight conversion using solar cells.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on organic sensitizers are among the most promising technologies for converting solar energy into electrical energy due to their advantages over inorganic solar cells, such as low production costs, lightness, flexibility and strength of end devices, the possibility of using roll-fed printing technologies, and device creation for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) as well as long service life and ability to work in reflected and artificial light.2 Organic photosensitizers play a key role in DSSCs and determine their performance and other important characteristics.3 Since the publication in 1991 by M. Grätzel et al. of the first work on the preparation of DSSCs,4 the architecture of the key dyes changed significantly, evolving from simple donor–acceptor (D–A) structures to more complex ones (D–π–A, D–A–π–A, D–π–A–π–A, etc.).5
Among these dyes, a novel concept, the D–A–π–A conjugate system, has demonstrated many advantages due to incorporation of an additional electron-withdrawing unit (such as benzothiadiazole, diketopyrrolopyrrole, quinoxaline, etc.) and a π-spacer (such as benzene, thiophene, and more complicated species), namely, (1) greatly improved photo-stability, (2) broadening of the light-harvesting region with a new absorption band, (3) successful tuning of the molecular energy gap, (4) essential facilitation of the electron transfer from the donor groups to the anchoring acceptor groups and (5) an increase in the open circuit photovoltage due to the presence of a fused nitrogen-containing acceptor heterocycle.6 Since the discovery of the first representative of a dye of this series, WS-2, by Zhu et al. in 2011,7 this structure was intensely modified in order to reveal the effect of individual moieties in sensitizers on the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs.8–14 Finally, the power conversion efficiency reached 12.5%.15 Since complicating the structure of sensitizers does not always guarantee a high PCE, the D–A–π–A sequence can be considered the optimal structure in terms of the ratio of synthetic costs and the resulting efficiency.
Despite the synthesis of a large number of D–A–π–A dyes, a number of questions remain unanswered regarding the possibility of further increasing the PCE of solar cells, including how the structure of various donor, acceptor, and π-spacer elements affects the final characteristics of devices and whether it is possible to increase the PCE by the right combination of these elements. In particular, while the problem of incorporating the most efficient internal acceptors,16 π-spacer,17,18 and anchor electron-withdrawing groups19 has been studied in sufficient detail, the question of how donor building blocks affect the photovoltaic properties of dyes is insufficiently covered in the literature. Therefore, the design and synthesis of a previously unexplored donor building block gives hope for improving the photovoltaic efficiency of DSSCs. In this work, four new sensitizers of the D–A–π–A type containing the 9-(p-tolyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole building block were obtained for the first time. Solar cells were designed on their basis, and their photovoltaic characteristics were measured. The effect of various internal acceptors, which have proven to be the most efficient, on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs was revealed. The rigid and nonplanar 9-(p-tolyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole is the closest analogue of the donor described in the literature with a phenyl substituent instead of a p-tolyl group,20 which provides not only steric hindrance to undesired aggregation but also the required HOMO/LUMO energy level.
A cyanoacrylic acid residue plays the role of a terminal acceptor and anchor to the nanostructured TiO2 substrate. Since the selection of an internal acceptor affects the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic characteristics of organic sensitizers,21 we studied heterocyclic systems widely used in this role, such as benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTD), 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (Qx), and an alkoxy derivative of the latter, i.e., 2,3-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (Qx-OR).
The choice of these objects is not accidental. Researchers working in the field of creating new materials continue to be interested in the BTD unit due to its optimal HOMO and LUMO energy levels, leading to a decrease in the bandgap of the final structures, as well as due to its easy accessibility. Among a wide variety of acceptor moieties, quinoxaline derivatives proved to be attractive building blocks for the creation of various materials not only for DSSCs15,22–28 but also for the synthesis of low-bandgap conjugated polymers29–32 owing to the electron-withdrawing properties of two imine nitrogens in the Qx unit. The attractiveness of the Qx acceptor is also explained by the easy incorporation of various substituents at positions 2 and 3, thus allowing the performance characteristics of the target dyes to be finely controlled. The use of phenyl and p-alkoxyphenyl substituents with a branched alkyl chain will not only balance the strong acceptor properties of the Qx unit but also increase the solubility and reduce possible J-aggregation and π–π-stacking during adsorption on a TiO2 surface.7,33
It is known that π-bridges also have a significant effect on the key properties of sensitizers, changing their absorption spectra, increasing charge separation during photoexcitation, and also reducing charge recombination.34 Therefore, in this work we considered two spacers, namely, the thiophene π-spacer. as it is one of the easiest for introducing into a synthetic sequence, and 4,4-diethylhexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) that promised a significant improvement in the characteristics of dyes based on it,12,35–37 though its synthesis is more laborious.
DSSCs were fabricated from all the synthesized dyes and their key characteristics were measured, including the power conversion efficiency (PCE).
2 Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization

NIK series dyes containing the 9-(p-tolyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole donor moiety are shown in Fig. 1. Their synthesis is based on the use of two sequential cross-coupling reactions of dibromo derivatives BTD and Qx (Scheme 1). It was not possible to obtain a donor 9-(p-tolyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole building block by methods similar to those described in the literature;20 therefore an alternative pathway to boronic ester 1 was developed. It involves the arylation of 6-bromo-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole 2 with p-iodotoluene in toluene in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst, (t-Bu)3P as the ligand, and AcOK as the base,38 followed by borylation of the resulting bromide 3 under the Miayura reaction conditions39 (Scheme 2). Suzuki coupling of boronic ester 1 with dibromides BTD and Qx resulted in monobromo derivatives 4a–c in moderate yields. In all the cases, symmetric derivatives 5a–c were obtained as minor products. The formation of the latter could not be completely avoided.

The second coupling reaction in the synthesis of thiophene derivatives 7a–c involved a Suzuki cross-coupling with 5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde 6a. In the case of CPDT derivative 7d, the method of direct C–H arylation with aldehyde 6b40 was used. The application of this approach made it possible to reduce the number of synthetic stages and increase the overall yield of the target products. Aldehydes were introduced without isolation into the Knoevenagel condensation with t-butyl cyanoacetate. Subsequent saponification of the resulting esters 7a–d gave the final dyes of the NIK series. These dyes were thoroughly purified by column chromatography to achieve the high purity required for optical and electrochemical measurements, followed by fabrication of solar cell devices and measurement of their characteristics.
Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the synthesized dyes of the NIK series in dilute solutions in CH2Cl2 at 2.5 × 10−5 mol L−1 and on a TiO2 film (2 μm transparent layer) were studied and are given in Fig. 2. The absorption maxima and extinction coefficients are presented in Table 1. All solutions of the studied dyes have three absorption maxima. The absorption band in the near-UV range observed at 315–330 nm corresponds to the π–π* transitions of the conjugated aromatic system. The middle weak shoulder peak in the region of 390–405 nm refers to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor moiety of 1,4-methanocarbazole and the internal acceptor BTD, Qx or Qx-OR.6,37 The maximum absorption in the region of 500–560 nm corresponds to the ICT between the 1,4-methanocarbazole derivative and the anchor moiety of cyanoacrylic acid. Comparison of the NIK88 and NIK119 dyes obviously shows that the CPDT bridge has a significant effect not only on the position of the absorption maximum of the CT band but also on its molar extinction coefficient. The red shift from 551 nm for NIK88 to 558 nm for NIK119 and a more than threefold increase in the molar extinction coefficient (from 13174 M−1 cm−1 for NIK88 to 41649 M−1 cm−1 for NIK119) are due to the extended coupling circuit of the CPDT unit compared to a thiophene bridge as well as the larger co-planarity of the CPDT spacer.

Replacing the BTD of the internal acceptor with unsubstituted Qx results in a blue shift of the CT band (500 nm for NIK97), which is associated with the weaker electron-withdrawing properties of quinoxaline compared to benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. Incorporation of donor (2-ethylhexyl)oxy moieties nearly does not affect the position of this absorption maximum that is observed at 499 nm for NIK99. In general, compounds NIK97 and NIK99 with Qx internal acceptors show an almost complete identity of their UV-vis spectra, differing only in the molar extinction coefficients that are higher for the dye with an unsubstituted Qx unit in the case of all three absorption maxima. Apparently, the presence of long branched alkyl chains in the NIK99 compound leads to a decrease in co-planarity in comparison with the unsubstituted analogue, NIK97.
When NIK dyes are adsorbed on a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface, a blue shift of the CT band at 25–45 nm is observed for compounds NIK88, NIK97, and NIK119 due to deprotonation upon absorption on the surface of titanium dioxide, along with H-aggregation.41 Only for the NIK99 dye, there is practically no CT band shift, which indicates that the aggregation of this dye on the titanium dioxide surface is insignificant.42 The trends in the absorption maxima within the NIK series are similar to those in solutions.
The absorption spectra of all the compounds adsorbed on the TiO2 surface exhibit a broad spectral coverage, indicating good light absorption, which is important for DSSCs. The NIK119 and NIK88 dyes with a BTD acceptor unit cover the range up to 700 nm, while dyes based on Qx and its alkoxy derivative Qx-OR, up to 650 nm.
Desorption of dyes attached to TiO2 in order to estimate dye loading was performed by immersing sensitized electrodes in a 40 mM solution of TBA(OH) in THF. The data obtained are shown in Table 3. It is known that the concentration of a dye on a titanium dioxide surface directly depends on the molecular structure of the sensitizer: the smaller the size of the molecule, the greater the dye loading, and vice versa: an increase in the number and size of branched substituents results in a decrease in dye loading on a TiO2 surface. On the one hand, a decrease in the concentration of a dye per unit surface area of titanium dioxide should decrease the undesired aggregation of the dye and charge recombination, which, as a consequence, would make it possible to obtain better device performance. On the other hand, the smaller the number of dye molecules physically located in a test sample, the fewer photons it can absorb and transform into electricity, which would inevitably reduce the resulting efficiency.
Not surprisingly, for sensitizers without bulky substituents, NIK97 and NIK88, a comparable concentration of titanium dioxide on the substrate is observed, which is reflected in a similar absorbance in UV-vis spectra (Fig. 2b) and indicates an approximate equality of the concentrations of these dyes per unit volume of porous TiO2. If branched alkyl chains are introduced into the acceptor (NIK99) or π-bridging (NIK119) part of the molecule, dye loading decreases almost twofold. In the UV-vis spectrum of compound NIK99 deposited on TiO2, the absorbance is also reduced in comparison with its unsubstituted analogue NIK97. However, for the NIK119 dye, the absorbance is 1.5 times higher, despite the lower dye loading, which makes this dye the most promising for making efficient devices on its basis.
Electrochemical properties
To determine the electroreduction (ER) and electrooxidation (EO) potentials of the dyes, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained in DMF on a platinum electrode. The cyclic voltammograms of compounds NIK88, NIK97 and NIK119 are quasi-reversible (Fig. 3a). On the CV curves in NIK99 solutions, we failed to detect the ER peak either on a platinum electrode or on a glassy carbon electrode. The EO curves of all the dyes except the NIK99 dye are also quasi-reversible at a potential sweep rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms showing reduction (a) and oxidation (b) of NIK. Scan rate: 100 mV s−1, electrolyte: 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 in DMF. 
To estimate the energies of the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) and highest occupied (HOMO) molecular orbitals, we used the values of the formal reduction potentials Ered = (Epc + Epa)/2 and oxidation potentials Eox = (Epa + Epc)/2, respectively. Since the multielectron oxidation peak of NIK99 is irreversible, the potential of the peak onset was used to determine the HOMO energy in this case. The Ered(Fc/Fc+) and Eox(Fc/Fc+) values were calculated relative to the potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) reversible redox couple (Table 2). Since the absolute oxidation potential of ferrocene is −5.1 eV,43,44 these values were used to calculate the LUMO and HOMO values according to the formulas: EHOMO (eV) = −|e|(EoxFc/Fc+ + 5.1)(1) ELUMO (eV) = −|e|(EredFc/Fc+ + 5.1)(2)The LUMO values of the compounds obtained are higher than the energy level of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.2 eV),45 and the HOMO values are below the level of I−/I3− (5.2 eV).46 These parameters make it possible to consider NIK compounds as promising dyes for the creation of solar cells.

DSSC performance
To determine the applicability of the dyes synthesized as sensitizers for DSSCs, test cells with a two-layer photoanode made of TiO2 (4.5 μm scattering layer and 9 μm transparent layer), an iodine electrolyte, and a Pt film as the counter electrode were constructed. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded under standard AM 1.5G illumination conditions (100 mW cm−2). They are shown in Fig. 4a, and the parameters obtained are summarized in Table 3. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases in the order NIK88 < NIK99 < NIK119 < NIK97 and lies in the range of 2.74–4.34%. The efficiency of the best DSSCs based on NIK97 is 67% of the PCE measured under similar experimental conditions in a cell based on the N719 dye used as the standard.

It is known that the short-circuit current value (Jsc) is directly related to the molar extinction coefficient. The maximum Jsc value among all the studied dyes was shown by the device based on NIK97 whose extinction coefficient is higher than that of NIK88 or NIK99. Surprisingly, the NIK119 dye whose ε value is almost two times higher showed the lowest current. This is probably due to the low concentration of the NIK119 compound on the TiO2 surface (Table 1). BTD-based dyes, NIK88 and NIK119, have lower Voc values than Qx-derivatives NIK97 and NIK99. This effect is apparently due to a higher probability of electron recombination because of the stronger electron-withdrawing properties of the benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole moiety as well as the steric loading of 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline and its alkoxy analogue that form a hydrophobic barrier, preventing the penetration of hydrophilic I3− ions to the TiO2 surface and thereby slowing down charge recombination.47
Owing to the above factors, the NIK97 dye demonstrates the most optimal ratio between Voc, Jsc and the dye concentration on the titanium dioxide substrate, which leads to the maximum PCE value among the sensitizers studied. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data of NIK dyes shown in Fig. 4b are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained for the corresponding DSSCs. The absorption intensity of sensitizers NIK88 and NIK119 with a stronger electron-acceptor BTD unit is lower than that of Qx-based compounds; however, it is broader and extends from 380 nm to 750 nm. In the case of the NIK119 dye, this also contradicts the maximum molar extinction coefficient in UV-vis spectra among all the compounds studied; however, it agrees with the minimum Jsc value for the DSSCs based on it. The most intense and broadest absorption (more than 40% from 400 nm to 650 nm) is observed for the NIK97 dye. The DSSCs based on the latter showed the maximum values not only of Jsc but also of Voc and PCE.
To improve the photovoltaic parameters and suppress dye aggregation, we tested chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent for all the four sensitizers. The corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S1.† As shown in Table 3, the addition of CDCA increases the Jsc of all the four test cells; however, for the NIK88 dye which does not comprise any bulky groups, this change is most significant (from 7.52 mA cm−2 to 10.03 mA cm−2, i.e., 25%). The dyes with alkyl chains in the acceptor (NIK99) and in the π-spacer (NIK119) parts of the molecules demonstrate the weakest dependence of Jsc on the addition of the co-adsorbent (by 3% and 6%, respectively), which is due to the contribution of branched groups to a decrease in aggregation during adsorption on the TiO2 surface. Another reason for a slight increase in the short-circuit current may lie in a sharp decrease in the concentration of the dye on the surface of titanium dioxide upon cosensitization with CDCA (Table 3). The increase in Jsc value for a sensitizer based on unsubstituted Qx NIK97 is more significant (14%), which is evidence of insufficient steric loading of the diphenylquinoxaline moiety compared to the traditional incorporation of branched alkyl substituents. The IPCE spectra obtained for solar cells with addition of the co-adsorbent are also consistent with the reported Jsc values but show higher absorption compared to CDCA-free devices (Fig. S2†). As a result, in all the four dyes of the NIK series, the addition of the co-adsorbent leads to an increase in PCE by 10–30%. The most significant increase was noted for the NIK88 dye without bulky substituents, whereas the smallest increase was for its CPDT analogue (NIK119).
The concentration of dyes with bulky alkyl substituents, NIK99 and NIK119, on the titanium dioxide surface decreases almost twofold in comparison with the less sterically loaded analogues, so in order to avoid a decrease in the short-circuit current for this reason, we optimized the structure of solar cells by increasing the thickness of the active TiO2 layer and the exposure time of the photoanode in the dye solution. J–V characteristics and the concentrations of dyes on the surface of the nanostructured substrate are summarized in Table S1.† As can be seen from the data presented, both strategies applied to DSSCs based on the NIK99 sensitizer made it possible to increase the Jsc value in proportion to the increase in the concentration of the sorbed dye. As a result, the PCE values of these devices increased by one third. However, the use of a thicker TiO2 active layer for NIK119-based DSSCs did not significantly improve the performance despite the increase in the dye concentration on the titanium dioxide surface.
3 Experimental details
Materials and reagents
The reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. Solvents were purified by distillation from the appropriate drying agents. All synthetic operations were performed under a dry argon atmosphere. 6-Bromo-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole 2,48 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole,49 5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde 6a,50 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2-carbaldehyde 6b,51 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline,52 and 5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxaline53 were prepared according to the published methods and characterized by NMR spectra.
Analytical instruments
Melting points were obtained using a Kofler hot-stage apparatus and were not corrected. 1H NMR (300.1 MHz) and 13C NMR (75.5 MHz) spectra were obtained using a Bruker AM-300 spectrometer with TMS as the standard in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 solutions. The coupling constant (J) values are reported in hertz (Hz). MS spectra were taken with a Finnigan MAT INCOS 50 instrument (EI, 70 eV). High-resolution MS spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF II instrument with electrospray ionization (ESI†). The measurement was carried out in negative ion mode (3200 V) or in positive ion mode (interface capillary voltage −4500 V); mass range: m/z 50–3000 Da; internal or external calibration was made with Electrospray Calibrant Solution (Fluka). Solutions in methanol, water, or acetonitrile were injected with a syringe (flow rate 3 mL min−1). Nitrogen was applied as a dry gas; the interface temperature was 180 °C. IR spectra were recorded in KBr pellets on a Specord M-80 instrument.
General procedure for fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
The fabrication procedure is based on the previously reported procedures by Almenningen et al.54 and Hora et al.55
The anodes were prepared from FTO glass (TEC10, Sigma-Aldrich), which was cleaned in a KOH solution (150 g L−1) in 70 w% ethanol under sonication for 45 minutes. Immersion of the glass in an aqueous TiCl4 solution (40 mM) at 70 °C for 2 × 45 minutes followed by rinsing with deionized water and ethanol was carried out to deposit a blocking layer on the FTO sample. The layer of TiO2 formed was sintered at 500 °C for one hour.
Pastes of TiO2 were screen printed onto the FTO (mesh count 54, thread diameter 64 mm, area 0.2826 cm2). First, two active layers (18NR-T, Dyesol) were printed, with 10 minutes of heating on a hotplate at 120 °C after each layer. A scattering layer (WER2-O, Dyesol) was finally printed, and TiO2 was sintered in a programmable furnace (Nabertherm LT 9/12) at set temperatures of 125, 250, 325, 450, and 500 °C for 5, 5, 5, 15, and 15 minutes with a ramping time of 10 minutes. The thickness of TiO2 measured using a profilometer (Veeco, Dektak 150) was found to be 13.5 μm (9 μm + 4.5 μm). Before staining, the electrodes were annealed at 500 °C for 30 minutes using a hot air gun.
The counter electrodes were prepared from TEC10 FTO glass supplied by Sigma Aldrich. Holes were drilled into the electrodes from the FTO side using a diamond drill bit; this procedure was carried out under water. The glass plates were then cleaned using Deconex 21 (aq., 2 g L−1), deionized water, ethanol, and acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes in each. A solution of H2PtCl6 (10 mM in 2-propanol) dropcast (5 μL cm−2) on the FTO before heating at 400 °C for 15 minutes with a hot air gun formed a catalytic layer of Pt.
The photoanodes were placed in a dye bath while their temperature was still ∼80 °C after the annealing procedure and stored in an oven at 30 °C overnight. The dye baths were prepared using a mixture of acetonitrile and THF (43/57, v/v) to make a solution of a dye and CDCA co-adsorbent at concentrations of 0.5 mM and 5 mM, respectively. The staining of the reference N719 was done similarly, but ethanol was used as the solvent in this case. Following 15 hours of staining the electrodes were rinsed in acetonitrile for 2 minutes, then sealed to the counter electrode using Surlyn (25 μm, Solaronix) in a dry box. A 4 × 20 second treatment of the cell using a 50 W PTC heat element was sufficient to seal the cells. The electrolyte was vacuum backfilled into the device, the filling hole was sealed with Surlyn and a glass cover disk, and then the electrodes were painted with a silver conducting paint (Electrolube, SCP) to complete the devices. He A6141 electrolyte consisting of butylmethylimidazolium iodide (0.60 M), I2 (0.03 M), guanidinium thiocyanate (0.1 M), and t-butylpyridine (0.50 M) dissolved in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85/15, v/v)56 was employed.
The J–V characteristics of DSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2450 unit under a Sciencetech SP300B solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G filter, calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a Newport reference solar cell and meter (91150 V). All the cells were masked with a 0.159 cm2 black mask before characterization. IPCE measurements were obtained from a device fabricated with a halogen lamp (Ocean Optics HL-2000) with a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110) connected to the Keithley 2450 unit. The light intensity was determined using a NIST traceable calibrated photodiode (Thorlabs, FDS100-CAL).
Optical characterization
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Jasco V-670 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer controlled with SpectraManager software. The solution samples for UV-vis measurements were prepared as 1 × 10−5 M toluene/ethanol (7:3, v/v) solutions in a 1 cm quartz cell. Solid UV-vis samples were prepared by adsorbing the dyes onto 2 μm-thick transparent TiO2 films on FTO glass. Blank FTO glass was used as the reference.
Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using a three-electrode scheme and an IPC-Pro potentiostat (Econix, Russia). A platinum electrode was used as the working electrode, a platinum grid was used as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode connected to the solution in the cell via a bridge filled with a background electrolyte was used as the reference electrode. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) in DMF was used as the background electrolyte. The electrooxidation and electroreduction potentials were determined relative to the reversible oxidation potential of ferrocene added to the solution after recording the curves of the compounds studied. The solution was purged with argon to remove dissolved oxygen. The curves were recorded at a potential sweep rate of 0.1 V s−1.

4 Conclusions
The influence of the sensitizer structure on the photovoltaic properties of solar cells based on it is one of the key tasks for increasing the photovoltaic efficiency. To solve this problem, four new D–A–π–A dyes for metal-free organic DSSCs based on 9-(p-tolyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole as a never explored donor building block were synthesized. The correlations between various internal acceptors, namely, benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline, and 2,3-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxaline, and the optical properties of the final structures based on them were established. It was shown that sensitizers based on bulkier quinoxaline units with weaker acceptor properties manifest a blue shift of the CT band in the UV-vis spectra. The π-bridge was varied using a BTD-based sensitizer as an example, and it was shown that incorporation of a more sterically loaded 4,4-diethylhexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene moiety instead of thiophene leads to a significant bathochromic shift and a threefold increase in the molar extinction coefficient due to flattening of the structure, an increase in π-conjugation, and the presence of bulky alkyl substituents. Nevertheless, DSSCs based on 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline as an internal acceptor and thiophene as a π-spacer showed the highest PCE values among the NIK dyes, which increased by almost a quarter by addition of CDCA as a sensitizer. This apparently results from the optimal relationship between the electronic effects of individual building blocks and the relative compactness of the dye molecules. This is probably why sensitizers based on stronger electron-withdrawing benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole as well as bulky alkyl groups in their structure demonstrated lower photovoltaic parameters.

Design, System, Application
New metal-free organic sensitizers of D–A–π–A type with a 9-(p-tolyl)-2,3,4,4a,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-1,4-methanocarbazole donor building block have been synthesized and used in the design of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The effect of the structural features of dyes on their optical and photovoltaic properties was studied by varying the internal acceptors and π-spacers. Incorporation of branched alkyl substituents in both the acceptor and the π-bridging parts of the molecules leads, on the one hand, to higher extinction coefficients in the UV-vis spectra, but to a decrease in the concentration of dyes on the TiO2 surface, on the other hand. Determination of the photovoltaic characteristics showed the latter factor to be the most significant, and dyes with bulky substituents showed a low overall power conversion efficiency (PCE). At the same time, dyes without alkyl chains were prone to charge aggregation and recombination, which also reduced the PCE values. Unsubstituted 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline proved to be the most optimal internal acceptor, providing a sufficiently high steric load and the necessary electronic effects, which resulted in the highest PCE among the DSSCs studied. Thus, it was shown that incorporation of bulky structural elements as well as their absence leads to low resulting characteristics, and the need to maintain a balance in the molecular design of sensitizers for DSSCs was proved.
