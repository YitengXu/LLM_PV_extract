    , Accepted 21st December 2016First published on 21st December 2016AbstractIn this work, we demonstrate a facile two-step hydrothermal method to synthesize layered MoS2 coupled metal organic framework (MOF) derived dual-phase TiO2 (MDT), as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The MOF-derived TiO2 with a controllable pore size effectively prolongs the light traveling length and facilitates the interfacial carrier transport. Coupled with MoS2, the visible light response property and the surface water oxidation kinetics of TiO2 are obviously enhanced. Importantly, the multi-junction between layered MoS2 and dual-phase TiO2 suppresses the recombination rate of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and effectively enhances charge transfer kinetics. Used as a photoanode for DSSCs, the MDT demonstrates a maximum photocurrent density (J) of 17.72 mA cm−2 with a power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.96%, more than 2 times higher than that of pure TiO2 (η = 4.41%). Applied as a photoanode for PEC water splitting, it shows a photocurrent density of 1.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, compared with that of pure TiO2 (J = 0.6 mA cm−2). The greatly improved PEC performance provides methods for building solar energy conversion devices by constructing MOF-derived functional materials.
1. Introduction
TiO2, one of the most important photoanode materials for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting,1–5 has been widely studied for its outstanding chemical stability and suitable energy band structure.6 However, the performance still suffers from low carrier transport efficiency, insufficient visible light absorption and slow surface water oxidation kinetics.7,8 Until now, many strategies have been taken to develop novel TiO2-based materials with enhanced PEC performance.9–11 The effective technique is to couple TiO2 with a narrow band-gap semiconductor to tune the energy band structure and facilitate the carrier transfer processes to enhance the water splitting performance.12,13
Recently, two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) have received great attention due to their suitable energy band structure and extraordinary PEC activity.14,15 It is shown that 2D-TMDs are more sensitive to the photons with different energy in comparison with graphene.16–18 It is revealed that the nesting band structure of 2D-TMDs induces strong inter-band absorption above the fundamental band gap.19 Such characteristics make 2D-TMDs like MoS2 which exhibits a strong photon–electron coupling effect, leading to an enhanced photoelectric reaction activity.20 Compared with other two-dimensional materials, such as graphene,21 ZnIn2S4,22 and layered double hydroxide (LDH),23 MoS2 nanosheets are regarded as a promising photoanode material for PEC water splitting, as their hydrogen adsorption free energy is close to zero, which is quite close to that of Pt.24 Therefore, constructing a hybrid between semiconductor oxide and MoS2 should be a promising strategy to overcome the limitation of intrinsic performance of semiconductor oxide and improve the PEC activity.25–27 Tan et al. synthesized MoS2/ZnO hybrid nanosheets for efficient carrier separation and light absorption.28 Recently, Chhowalla et al. reported that, with the thickness of MoS2 decreasing, although the inter-band energy increases and the absorption edge blue-shifts, it still results in an enhanced recombination of photogenerated carriers and leads to stronger photoluminescence (PL) intensity due to the quantum yield dropping.29 From this point of view, constructing MoS2-based hybrids can effectively facilitate the carrier transfer in layered MoS2. Promoted by these benefits, coupling layered MoS2 with TiO2 is considered to be a promising way to improve the PEC water splitting performance.
It is worth mentioning that effectively boosting light trapping performance and interfacial PEC activity of general photoanode materials is still greatly challenging due to the poor light–matter interaction. It is reported that porous structured photoanodes with interconnected channels can effectively utilize the incident light.30–33 The light capture capability can be remarkably reinforced as the multiple light-scattering processes in the pore-channels greatly extend the incident light-traveling length.34,35 The metal organic framework (MOF) derived porous materials should be promising candidates for their potential application possibility as photoanode materials, benefiting from their large specific surface area and mesopore-rich structure.36,37 Won's group reported that the DSSC photoanode based on ligand modified TiO2 derived from MIL-125(Ti) achieves a power conversion efficiency of 8.0% due to the enhanced light scattering process.38 Based on the recent research, in order to achieve better photoelectric chemical performance, it is of great interest to develop mesoporous structures with a tunable pore size.39–41 One of the possible routes to synthesize pore size controllable MOF-derived metal oxide is to modulate the pore size of the MOF precursors.41 Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, cation exchanged MOF-derived porous TiO2 with a tunable pore size, as a photoanode material for PEC water splitting and photoelectrical conversion, is almost not reported. Hence, it is a great challenge and of fundamental importance to integrate layered MoS2 with cation exchanged MOF-derived TiO2 within tunable mesoporous structures to enhance the PEC performance of the photoanode material.
Herein, we for the first time design a facile hydrothermal route to prepare layered MoS2 coupled Sn4+ exchanged MOF-derived dual phase TiO2 (MDT) with a controllable pore structure. The light harvesting capacity and interfacial photocatalytic activity are pronouncedly improved for the mesoporous-rich MDT with a large surface area and interconnected porous framework. Coupling with layered MoS2, the optical-response range and surface water oxidation kinetics are remarkably enhanced. The multi-junction between layered MoS2 and anatase/rutile dual-phase TiO2 effectively suppresses the carrier recombination. The MoS2 coupled MDT-based DSSC demonstrates a maximum photocurrent density of 17.72 mA cm−2 and an improved power conversion efficiency of 8.96%, nearly 2.06 and 2.03 times higher than those of pure TiO2. In addition, applied as a photoanode for PEC water splitting, it shows an AM 1.5 photocurrent density of 1.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, over 2 times higher than that of the pure TiO2 photoanode.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Preparation of the MoS2/dual-phase TiO2 hybrid

2.1.1 Synthesis of Sn4+ exchanged MIL-125(Ti) and MOFs-derived TiO2. 
Pure MIL-125 (Ti) was synthesized by dissolving anhydrous MeOH, terephthalic acid and titanium isopropoxide in N,N-dimethylmethanamide to prepare the precursor solution.42 Then the solution was transferred into an autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the product was washed with MeOH. To synthesize Sn4+ exchanged MIL-125(Ti), different amounts of SnCl4·5H2O (molar ratio of Sn vs. Ti of 0%, 2.5% and 5%, respectively) were added into the precursor solution. The as-synthesized MOFs were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h under air to decompose the organic components. In order to facilitate the illustration, Sn4+ exchanged MIL-125(Ti) derived TiO2 and pure MIL-125(Ti) derived TiO2 were denoted as DT and 0DT, respectively.


2.1.2 Synthesis of the MoS2/TiO2 hybrid. 
Typically, sodium molybdate and thiourea were dissolved in deionized water to form the precursor solution. Then the obtained TiO2 was added into the precursor and kept stirring for half an hour. The solution was then transferred to the autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 hours.43 After washing with ethanol, the MoS2/TiO2 sample was harvested. In comparison, pure MoS2 was synthesized under the same hydrothermal process without adding TiO2. Corresponding to an adjustable MoS2 precursor ratio versus TiO2 of 25 mol%, 50 mol% and 100 mol%, obtained MoS2/TiO2 was denoted as 0.25MDT, 0.5MDT and 1MDT, respectively.

2.2 Microstructure and performance characterization
The XRD was taken at 40 kV with the current of 30 mA. The morphology and element composition were characterized by using a SU-70 equipped with an EDS. The TEM image was recorded with a Tecnai 20U-Twin. The XPS measurements were carried out in a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250 spectrometer. The UV/Visible spectra were collected from the TU-1900 equipment. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected through a Hitachi U-4100 system.
For the DSSCs, both the current density–voltage measurements and incident photon to current conversion efficiency measurement were performed with a Newport series setup as we reported before. The EIS was recorded with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation.
PEC properties of the HER were obtained by using the CHI660E electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode design. The obtained MDT hybrid was used as the photoanode and a Pt mesh as the counter electrode, and the reference electrode was a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 0.35 M Na2S and 0.25 M Na2SO3. Before irradiation, the system was bubbled with nitrogen for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte. The LSV test was performed under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Mott–Schottky plots were recorded in the dark at an AC frequency of 1.0 kHz.
Henceforth, the electrode potential is converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential according to the Nernst equation:44 ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + EoAg/AgCl(1)where ERHE is the converted potential versus RHE, EAg/AgCl is the measured potential versus the Ag/AgCl electrode, and EoAg/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure characterization

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of (a) DT and (b) pure MoS2 and (c) 0.5MDT. For the XRD patterns of DT (Fig. 1), the peaks located at 25.2°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 53.8°, 62.7°, 68.2°, 75.0° and 82.6° are in good agreement with the (101), (004), (200), (105), (204), (021), (215) and (224) planes of anatase TiO2 (PDF#: 21-1272). The peaks located at 27.4° and 36.1° are in good agreement with the (110) and (101) planes of rutile TiO2 (PDF#: 21-1276). For the pure MoS2, the peaks located at 14.4°, 33.5° and 58.3° can be assigned to the (002), (100) and (110) planes of 2H–MoS2 (PDF#: 06-0097). As for the 0.5MDT sample, both the diffraction peaks of DT and MoS2 can be observed, indicating the successful synthesis of MoS2/dual-phase TiO2 hybrids.

Fig. 2 depicts the SEM images of cation exchanged MIL-125(Ti), DT, 0.5MDT and pure MoS2. From the SEM image in Fig. 2a, it can be seen that obtained cation exchanged MIL-125(Ti) is in a regular cylinder-shape with relatively smooth surfaces. After annealing in air, the MOF-derived TiO2 remains a cylinder-shape but some cavities are observed, which results from the breakdown of organic linkers (Fig. 2b). As shown in Fig. 2c, after loading MoS2, the cylinder is covered by MoS2 nanosheets and the particle size grows to almost 1 μm. Meanwhile, if the decoration of MoS2 is insufficient (0.25MDT) or excessive (1MDT), TiO2 will be only covered by MoS2 nanoparticles or excessively covered by MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. S3†). Moreover, the pure MoS2 nanosheets, obtained by the same hydrothermal method without adding the DT, self-assembled into a microsphere with a length of ∼2 μm (Fig. 2d). The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping images of the 0.5MDT sample also confirm the uniform distribution of MoS2 on TiO2 (Fig. S4†).

The microstructures of DT and 0.5MDT are further investigated by TEM. Fig. 3a shows the typical TEM image of 0.5MDT, where the few-layered MoS2 uniformly covers the surface of the TiO2 inner layer. Most MoS2 nanosheets are very thin (∼3 nm), around 4 layers (Fig. S5†). From the HRTEM images in Fig. 3b and c, the lattice fringes of MoS2 nanosheets can be clearly observed, suggesting the good crystallinity of MoS2 nanosheets. The fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.27 nm and 0.61 nm can be indexed to the (100) and (002) planes of MoS2, and the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm can be indexed to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is shown in Fig. 3d. The diffraction rings correspond well with the (002), (101) and (107) planes of MoS2, (101) and (004) planes of anatase TiO2 and (110) planes of rutile TiO2, respectively. The morphology and phase component of dual-phased TiO2 are illustrated in Fig. S6, † where the dual-phased TiO2 is rich in mesoporous channels and the lattice fringes of 0.35 nm can be assigned to the (101) planes of the anatase TiO2, while the lattice fringes of 0.24 nm and 0.32 nm can be assigned to the (101) and (110) planes of rutile TiO2.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to further investigate the chemical bonding state of 0.5MDT (Fig. 4). From the fully scanned spectrum (Fig. 4a), the presence of element Ti, O, Sn, Mo, S and C is confirmed. The C peak should be attributed to the carbon-based contaminant, and the binding energy for C 1s at 284.6 eV is used as the reference. From Fig. 4b, the asymmetrical O 1s peak can be assigned to the lattice oxygen and –OH surface species.45 According to Li's work,46 the binding energy of oxygen for dual-phase TiO2 is around 530.1 eV, which can be regarded as the mean value of pure TiO2 (529.8 eV) and pure SnO2 (530.8 eV). To further confirm the MoS2 species, the Mo 3d and S 2p spectra are analyzed by fitting their curves, as shown in (Fig. 4c and d). The high-resolution XPS spectra show that the binding energies of Mo 3d3/2, Mo 3d5/2, S 2p1/2, S 2p3/2 and S 2s peaks in pure MoS2 are located at 232.0, 228.8, 162.9, 161.9 and 226.8 eV. This result confirms that MoS2 is successfully grown on dual-phase TiO2.

The nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms depicted in Fig. S7† are utilized to characterize the textural properties of cation exchanged 0DT, DT, xMDT hybrids (x = 0.25, 0.5 and 1) and pure MoS2. As shown in Fig. S7, † cation exchanged MOF-derived TiO2 possesses a high specific surface area of 98.85 m2 g−1, a large pore volume of 0.21 cm3 g−1 and an average pore size of 9.52 nm. It is worthy to mention that the pore size of cation exchanged MOF-derived TiO2 is almost two times larger than that of TiO2 derived from pure MIL-125(Ti), which is helpful to the incident-light scattering and electrolyte infiltration. Therefore, the pore size of MOF-derived TiO2 can be effectively tuned by tailoring the component of the cation exchanged MOF precursor. Coupling with MoS2 nanosheets, all xMDT samples exhibit type III isotherms with evident type H3 hysteresis, typical for mesoporous materials. The pore-size distribution plots show that the xMDT hybrids exhibit relative large pore size and specific surface area, which is positive for the light harvesting and interfacial carrier transport (Table 1).

3.2 Optical property characterization

Fig. 5a shows the diffusive reflectance spectra (DRS) of DT, 0DT and xMDT, (x = 0.25, 0.5 and 1), respectively. It can be seen that, for the DT and 0DT sample, the absorption edges are located around 390 nm, indicating that only ultraviolet light is responded. However, as for the xMDT samples, obvious red shifting of the absorption edges is observed, demonstrating that the coupling of MoS2 nanosheets can effectively broaden the optical-response range of the samples. According to the Kubelka–Munk function,47,48 the optical response range of DT and xMDT can be further estimated: F(R∞) = (1 − R)2/(2R)(2)where R refers to the reflectance intensity (Fig. 5b). It can be seen that, compared with DT, xMDTs exhibit additional absorption edges, which can be assigned to the few-layered MoS2. This phenomenon further confirms that via decoration with few-layered MoS2, the absorption edge of intrinsic TiO2 can be obviously extended to the visible light range.

It is reported that mesoporous structures can obviously enhance the incident light scattering processes and extend the incident photon transport pathway.6,49 Herein, the cation exchanged MOF-derived TiO2 displays evidently better light scattering performance than TiO2 derived from pure MOFs (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, after coupling the MoS2 layer with TiO2, the light absorption region is effectively extended and improved. This enhancement should be attributed to the multiple light-scattering processes from the mesoporous TiO2 channels and the heterojunction between MoS2 layers and TiO2, which obviously prolongs the incident photon transport pathway (Fig. S8†). In addition, it should be noted that, as the nesting band structure exists in few-layered MoS2, strong inter-band absorption will be brought to the xMDT hybrid,20 which significantly enhances its light absorption ability. From this point, coupling few-layered MoS2 with MOF-derived mesoporous materials can be a promising method to enhance the incident-light absorption capability.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is used to investigate the charge separation behavior of the photoanodes. It is shown from Fig. 6a that pure MOF-derived TiO2 displays the highest PL intensity. Nevertheless, as the DT is composed of anatase and rutile TiO2, forming a homojunction and suppressing the carrier recombination within the intrinsic TiO2, it thus results in an obvious PL quenching. After coupling MoS2 with dual-phase TiO2, more significant PL quenching is shown, and the 0.5MDT sample shows the most quenched PL behavior. With the MoS2 content further increasing, the PL intensity starts to increase again.26 Herein, the PL spectra of as-synthesized MoS2 and MDT are also tested in the region of 600–680 nm, which corresponds to the characteristic PL peak of MoS2 (Fig. S9†). It can be seen that for the MDT, the PL intensity displays an obviously deceasing trend, indicating that MDT can effectively suppress the photo-induced carriers' recombination. Therefore, there exists an optimized ratio between TiO2 and MoS2; introducing too much MoS2 layers will offset its advantages in the suppression of excitons' recombination.
 Fig. 6  (a) Photoluminescence spectra and (b) Mott–Schottky plots of as-synthesized 0DT, DT and xMDT. 
To further investigate the effects of the homojunction and heterojunction on the carrier separation, picosecond resolved fluorescence spectroscopy measurements are performed. The fluorescence decay profiles of 0DT, DT and xMDT are obtained with the excitation at 405 nm and monitored at 511 nm as shown in Fig. S11.† The average lifetime τ is calculated using τ = (B1τ12 + B2τ22)/(B1τ1 + B2τ2).50 The time constant of the fluorescence transients (FT) at 511 nm of 0DT shows a lifetime of 3.67 ns as listed in Table S3.† However, as for the cation exchanged MOF-derived dual phase TiO2, the FT lifetime slightly increases, indicating that the homojunction within the DT can improve the carrier separation. After MoS2 is decorated on DT, it can be seen that the FT lifetime is further enhanced. Besides, for the xMDT samples, the FT lifetime of 0.5MDT is the longest, which is in accordance with the PL spectra results. This phenomenon further confirms that there exists a most suitable ratio between the MoS2 and DT, excessive DT or MoS2 will both lead to an enhanced carrier recombination.

Fig. 6b shows typical Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of DT, 0DT and xMDT (x = 0.25, 0.5 and 1) samples. From the M–S plot, we can obtain the flat band potential and Fermi energy level of a semiconductor system by extrapolating the X-intercepts of the linear region. The M–S plot is given by the equation:51,52 1/C2 = (2/eεεoNdA2) [(V − VFB) − kT/eo](3)where C is the specific capacitance, e is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, εo is the electric permittivity of vacuum, Nd is the carrier density, A is the sample area, V is the applied potential, VFB is the flat band potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The VFB values of DT and 0DT are 0.30 and 0.34 V vs. RHE, respectively. The negative shifting in the flat band potential proves that the homojunction in dual-phase TiO2 can suppress the carrier recombination. For the xMDT samples (x = 0.25, 0.5 and 1), the VFB is 0.17, 0.12 and 0.22 V, respectively. The 0.5MDT sample exhibits the most efficient charger transfer performance with a most negatively shifted flat band potential, which is in accordance with the PL results. From the slope of the plots, it can be estimated that the Nd of 0.5MDT is 5.5 times larger than that of 0DT, indicating that the xMDT displays more efficient carriers' separation efficiency.
The band structure of DT and MoS2 is shown in Fig. S12.† According to the XRD results mentioned before, the dual-phased TiO2 is composed of anatase and rutile phase TiO2. As the work reported before,53 anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 can form a band structure matched homojunction, as both the conduction band (CB, −0.29 eV vs. NHE) and valence band (VB, 2.91 eV vs. NHE) of anatase TiO2 are more negative than the CB (−0.48 eV vs. NHE) and VB (2.52 eV vs. NHE) of rutile TiO2. Meanwhile, both the CB and VB of rutile TiO2 are more negative than the CB (−0.60 eV vs. NHE) and VB (1.30 eV vs. NHE) of few-layered MoS2, forming another heterojunction.54,55 The detailed band structure position of anatase, rutile TiO2 and MoS2 is listed in Table S4.† Therefore, between the dual-phased TiO2 and few-layered MoS2, there exists a multi-junction. For MoS2/dual-phased TiO2, it is evident that the photogenerated electrons of MoS2 tend to transfer to the CB of rutile TiO2, and then transfer to the CB of anatase TiO2, whereas the photogenerated holes of anatase TiO2 strongly tend to transfer oppositely to those of MoS2. The formation of multi-junctions can effectively improve the separation of photo-induced electron/hole pairs both at the MDT interface and TiO2 inner layer.
3.3 Photoelectric chemical property characterization
To investigate the photoelectric conversion performance of DSSCs based on DT, 0DT and xMDT (x = 0.25, 0.5 and 1) samples, the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves are recorded under AM 1.5 G illumination. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 7a, and the relevant performance data are listed in Table 2. The DSSCs based on 0DT display a short-circuit current density and fill factor of 8.44 mA cm−2 and 70.04%, with a power conversion efficiency of 4.41%. Nevertheless, for the DSSCs based on DT, the short-circuit current density is 10.61 mA cm−2 and the fill factor is 70.84%, while the power conversion efficiency is 6.12%. This photocurrent improvement should be attributed to light scattering enhancement induced by the porous structure modulation and better carrier separation performances due to the homojunction. After coupling with few-layered MoS2, both the photocurrent density (13.62 mA cm−2) and fill factor (76.83%) exhibit great enhancement, resulting in an obvious improvement in power conversion performance (7.51%). For the 0.5MDT hybrid photoanode, the photocurrent density and fill factor reach the maximum values of 17.72 mA cm−2 and 77.88% and achieve the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.96%. The increased fill factor indicates that 0.5MDT exhibits better dye molecule adsorption ability and electrolyte infiltration, which is attributed to the unique porous structure and increased specific surface area. However, for the DSSCs based on 1MDT, the photocurrent and fill factor display a slight decrease (12.37 mA cm−2 and 74.83%). This should be attributed to the relatively high carrier-recombination rate caused by excessive MoS2.

To test the stability of the as-prepared photoanode material, the long cyclic curves (within 100 thousand seconds) for the DSSCs based on the 0DT, DT and 0.5MDT photoanode are further tested (Fig. S13†). During the test, the photocurrent of DT is generally increasing compared with that of 0DT samples. It should be attributed to the better interfacial photoelectrochemical performance leading to the engineered pore-structure of DT. As for the 0.5MDT sample, it achieves a quite stable photocurrent during the test; no obvious current change occurred. Therefore, the cyclic experiment results confirm that all photoanode materials can remain stable under illumination. From this point of view, it can be concluded that the as-prepared MDT can not only effectively improve the power conversion performance of TiO2, but retain good stability for a quite long time.
The corresponding incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 7b. It is well known that IPCE is determined by the light harvesting efficiency and quantum yield efficiency of electron injection.56 Compared with the 0DT, due to the enhanced light harvesting capability and facilitated carrier transport processes, DSSCs based on DT display improved IPCE intensity. Coupled with few-layered MoS2, the cells based on xMDT exhibit an obviously broadened light harvesting range and enhanced IPCE intensity. This indicates that the coupling of few-layered MoS2 can effectively improve the optical responsibility of TiO2. The 0.5MDT sample achieves the highest IPCE of 66.7% at 500 nm and keeps a relatively high IPCE intensity until 750 nm. However, as for the DSSC based on 1MDT, the IPCE exhibits a drastic decrease, which should result from the poor quantum yield efficiency caused by excessive few-layered MoS2.
To get better insight into the carrier transfer dynamics within DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are carried out. Fig. 7c depicts the Nyquist plots of DSSCs based on the DT, 0DT, xMDT samples. The equivalent circuits shown in the inset figure of Fig. 7c are fitted with Zview software, and the fitting data are shown in Table 3. Due to the same counter electrode and electrolyte applied in the solar cell, the Rs of the cell based on DT, xMDT (x = 0.25, 0.5, and 1) and 0DT are calculated to be 15.42, 14.35, 14.98, 14.54 and 15.30 Ω, respectively. In addition, two semicircles are observed in the Nyquist plots. The small semicircle can be assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) and interfacial capacitance (CPE1) between the electrolyte/Pt electrode interfaces. The large semicircle refers to the electron transport resistance (Rct2) and interfacial capacitance (CPE2) at the photoanode/dye/redox electrolyte interface. The interfacial electron transport resistance has a great influence on the photoelectric conversion processes of DSSCs as it determines the number of interfacial electrons that back-react with the electrolyte. The fitted Rct2 values based on DT, xMDT (x = 0.25, 0.5, and 1) and 0DT are calculated to be 217.15, 209.17, 189.53, 204.63 and 224.63 Ω, respectively. Therefore, the Rct2 of the 0.5MDT photoanode is the smallest, showing the best interfacial electron transport performance.

Through Bode phase plots, the lifetime (τe) of interfacial transport electrons can be calculated and is shown in Fig. 7d. According to the EIS model developed by Kern,57τe can be evaluated according to the equation: τe = 1/(2πfmax)(4)where fmax is the frequency at the maximum of the low frequency region. Larger τe means better contact between the electrolyte/electrode interface and more effective suppression of interfacial electron back-reactions with the electrolyte. The τe of DSSCs based on DT, xMDT and 0DT is calculated to be 9.77, 19.53, 22.94, 8.51 and 7.95 ms, respectively. It is worthy to mention that the τe of DT is large than that of 0DT. Considering the tunable pore size and larger specific surface area of DT, it can be concluded that, via engineering the pore-size of MOF-derived materials, the interfacial carrier transferring processes can be effectively facilitated. Moreover, a longer electron transport lifetime is achieved for 0.5MDT, which is in good agreement with the interfacial electron transport resistance (Rct2).
To evaluate the PEC performance for water splitting, the linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) are tested. It shows that 0DT yields an onset potential about −0.06 V (vs. RHE) and a maximum photocurrent density of 0.6 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. 8a). For the DT photoanode, obviously negatively shifted onset potential (−0.31 V vs. RHE) and amplified photocurrent density (0.9 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. RHE) are revealed. This enhanced PEC performance should be attributed to the tailored pore structure and band structure of DT. The corresponding switched ON/OFF photocurrent density is shown in Fig. 8b. The result indicates that DT exhibits better PEC activity than pure TiO2 for PEC water splitting. Meanwhile, the 0.5MDT photoanode displays a further negatively shifted onset potential about −0.64 V (vs. RHE) and leads to an increased photocurrent density of 1.2 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V (vs. RHE), which is almost 2 times higher than that of 0DT at the same applied potential. According to the ON/OFF photocurrent density plots, the ON/OFF ratio of 0.5MDT is about 120, which is about 3 and 4 times higher than those of as-prepared DT and 0DT. This result is consistent with the LSV results in Fig. 8a. The photocurrent increasing immediately from the OFF to the ON state demonstrates that the obtained photoanode is very sensitive to the incident light, and is effective in the generation and transport of the carriers. Besides, as shown in Fig. S14,† the LSV plots of the xMDT samples are also recorded to illustrate the influences of desorption energy and carrier transport process on the PEC performance. It is known that the zero-approaching hydrogen adsorption free energy makes 2H–MoS2 promising for PEC application. In this work, 2H–MoS2 particles in 0.25MDT do possess more edges than 2H–MoS2 sheets in the others, therefore they achieve the most negative onset potential. However, it can be seen that the photocurrent density of 0.5MDT is larger than that of 0.25MDT. This phenomenon should be attributed to the better photogenerated carrier performance achieved by 0.5MDT, as tested in Fig. 6a. These results confirm that the photoelectrochemical performance of the photoanode material is influenced by not only the hydrogen desorption energy, but also the mobility of photo-induced carriers. By comparison, as 0.5MDT compromises best the intrinsic carrier recombination of MoS2 and TiO2, while retaining a large amount 2H–MoS2 edges at the same time, it shows the best PEC performance, consequently.

Moreover, to study the stability of the as-prepared 0.5MDT photoanode, the photocurrent density stability measurement is implemented and is shown in Fig. S15.† Despite the rapid variation in the first 300 seconds, the photocurrent density exhibits a stable value with negligibly small variations in the following test. This demonstrates that the as-prepared photoanodes are quite stable in the PEC water splitting processes.
Considering the greatly improved PEC performance achieved for 0.5MDT, a possible PEC mechanism is shown in Fig. 9. The MOF-derived TiO2 with a large amount of mesopores facilitates the electrolyte infiltrations and light scattering processes. The homojunction within the DT greatly improves the photogenerated carriers' separation of intrinsic TiO2. The coupling of layered MoS2 with TiO2 brings about a significantly enhanced incident light response in the visible light region and better carrier separation to conquer the intrinsic carrier recombination caused by TiO2 and few-layered MoS2. As it is known that the main limit of TiO2-based PEC photoanodes is the slow surface water oxidation kinetics, coupling MoS2 with TiO2 can effectively enhance the surface water oxidation processes while consuming the photogenerated holes from the TiO2 quickly to keep the stability of the photoanodes.

On the basis of the above experimental results, the great PEC enhancement achieved by the 0.5MDT based photoanode can be assigned to the following issues. Firstly, DT with a controllable mesoporous structure synthesized via annealing the cation exchanged MOF precursor, on the one hand, can efficiently enhance the incident light scattering and electrolyte infiltration processes in the mesoporous channels, which leads to longer photon transport ways and improves the carrier transport at the electrolyte/photoanode interface. On the other hand, the homojunction within the DT can pronouncedly suppress the photoluminescence in the intrinsic TiO2. Secondly, the uniquely matched energy state between layered MoS2 and DT forms a multi-junction, which significantly suppresses the carrier recombination. This can be confirmed by the EIS and Mott–Schottky plots. Thirdly, the enhanced PEC performance can also be attributed the coupling of layered MoS2 nanosheets. The diffusive reflectance spectra and IPCE curves show that the few-layered MoS2 obviously enhances the visible light absorption processes and leads to an enhanced photocurrent density. Therefore, 0.5MoS2/dual-phase TiO2 exhibits facilitated carrier transport and better visible light response properties than pure TiO2 and displays a markedly enhanced PEC performance.
4. Conclusion
In summary, layered MoS2 coupled cation exchanged MOF-derived dual-phased TiO2 with a controllable mesoporous structure is applied as the photoanode for DSSCs and PEC water splitting; the 0.5MoS2/dual-phase TiO2 sample demonstrates an obviously enhanced power conversion efficiency of 8.96% and a photocurrent density of 1.2 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. RHE, over 2 times higher than that of the pure TiO2. The relationship between the microstructure, optical response range, carriers' life time, and photoelectric chemical performance is investigated. The improved photoelectric chemical performance of MoS2/dual-phase TiO2 samples is attributed to the following issues. The engineered pore-structure of dual-phase TiO2 leads to enhanced incident light multi-scattering and electrolyte infiltration processes. It improves the light harvesting capability and interfacial carrier transport performance of the photoanode. In addition, the multi-junction between layered MoS2 and dual-phased TiO2 obviously improves the photogenerated carrier separation. Moreover, the coupling of MoS2 pronouncedly improves the visible light response properties and facilitates the surface water oxidation kinetics of intrinsic TiO2, which further enhances the photoelectric chemical performance.
