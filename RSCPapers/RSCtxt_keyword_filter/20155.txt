    , Accepted 19th May 2020First published on 20th May 2020AbstractIn this work, a novel benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF)-based polymer (PDiFPBDF-TBz, F13) was designed and synthesized with a wide bandgap of 1.93 eV. With the advantage of electronegative fluorine and furan unit, F13 possessed a deep HOMO level of −5.54 eV, which is favorable for higher Voc in polymer solar cells (PSCs). When F13 was blended with Y6, the device achieved a PCE of 12.7% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 22.61 mA cm−2 and an FF of 70.28%. More surprisingly, the unencapsulated pristine fabricated device generated a higher PCE of up to 13.34% after storing it in nitrogen or air. Further studies showed that the unencapsulated device could retain ∼92% of its original PCE even after exposure to air for ∼1150 hours and to nitrogen for ∼1370 hours, indicating quite promising stabilities. This improvement was due to the interfacial interaction of the active layer and anode layer and the stable micromorphological structure of the F13:Y6 film. The F13:Y6 device also exhibited a suppressed energy loss of 0.525 eV, which is one of the lowest among BDF polymer-based NF-PSCs. These results demonstrate that the rational design of the BDF polymer is highly critical in reaching the state-of-the-art photovoltaic performance and long-term stability.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layers have been considered as one of the renewable energy-generating technologies because of their advantages such as low cost, light-weight, mechanical flexibility and potential roll-to-roll processing.1–7 In the BHJ layer, fullerene derivatives have been previously applied as electron acceptors, wherein limited absorption in visible light and the low functionality of fullerene restrict significant advancement in the photovoltaic performance.8,9 Recently, with the breakthrough of narrow band-gap non-fullerene fused-ring electron acceptors, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in non-fullerene PSCs (NF-PSCs) have been boosted tremendously over 16% in the past few years.10–15 To fulfill the requirement of absorbing more and complementary sunlight, wide bandgap polymer donors are therefore highly in demand and critical for highly efficient NF-PSCs.16–18 With such targets, a variety of wide bandgap polymers based on fluorene, indacenodithiophene and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units with various electron-deficient units have been synthesized and applied in NF-PSCs.6,19–25 Among them, however, research on outstanding wide bandgap polymers is mainly focused on BDT type polymers such as P2F-EHp and PBDT-T-2F (PM6).5,26,27 Nevertheless, compared with the great blossom of narrow bandgap non-fullerene acceptors, the availability of efficient wide bandgap polymer donors is significantly insufficient and limited.
Recently, the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) unit has attracted increasing attention in developing wide bandgap polymers due to the smaller atomic radius and higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom, which are favorable for stronger intermolecular interaction and lower-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level in comparison with its thiophene counterpart.28–32 For example, we and others have developed a series of BDF polymers with chain engineering and achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼11% in NF-PSCs, which are even higher than those of BDT counterparts under the same conditions.33–36 In addition, furan can be obtained from renewable energy sources, such as vegetables, rotten leaves and crops, etc.37 Although the above progress has been made in recent years, the photovoltaic performance of BDF-based polymers is still largely behind that of BDT polymers in either fullerene or non-fullerene PSCs. Considering the advantages of BDF building block, it is highly worthwhile and essential to further design and explore BDF polymers with the motivation of developing low cost and highly efficient NF-PSCs through appropriate molecular design.
In the design strategy of polymer donors, it is known that conjugated aromatic side chain engineering has a vital effect on the electron distribution and intermolecular interactions of polymer chains as well as the morphological stabilities with electron acceptors in the BHJ layer.5,38,39 A small change in the aromatic ring, chain length or halogen substitution of the conjugated side chain can also induce a significant variation in the photovoltaic performance. In this work, we selected alkyldifluorophenyl as the conjugated side chain of the BDF unit and synthesized a novel wide bandgap two-dimensional (2D) BDF polymer donor (F13) with difluorobenzotriazole as the electron-deficient unit. With the large conjugated phenyl side chain, the coplanarity of the polymer backbone is further increased, which will enhance the aggregation tendency of polymer chains. Furthermore, the introduction of strong electronegative fluorine atoms in the side chains in combination with the oxygen atom of the BDF unit will be able to synergistically lower the HOMO energy level of F13, providing a further higher open circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs.40 In addition, the fluorine atom may also induce strong intermolecular non-covalent interactions to facilitate charge transport and/or increase the morphological stabilities.41,42 As such, F13 possesses a wide-bandgap of 1.90 eV and a deeper HOMO level of −5.54 eV. In NF-PSCs, the pristine fabricated F13:Y6 device generated a PCE of 12.70% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 22.61 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 70.28%. However, it is surprising that the aged device under either nitrogen or ambient air without encapsulation was able to improve the PCE to 13.34% with a slightly higher Voc of 0.815 V, an enhanced Jsc of 23.27 mA cm−2 and an almost identical FF of 70.37%. On further observation we found that the un-encapsulated device could retain more than 92% of its original PCE even after exposure to air for ∼1150 hours and to nitrogen for ∼1370 hours, showing quite promising stabilities. The results provide a new idea for fine-tuning the molecular structure and intermolecular interactions to obtain state-of-the-art photovoltaic performances and stabilities, and also inspire further development of BDF-based polymers for highly efficient PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and theoretical calculations
The synthetic route to the BDF-based polymer DiFPBDF-TBz (F13) is depicted in Fig. 1a, and the chemical structure of the non-fullerene electron acceptor Y6 is shown in Fig. 1b. The detailed synthesis is provided in the ESI.† The route to benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-difuran-4,8-dione and TBz-Br, and introduction of the 3,5-difluoro-4-(2-ethylhexyl)phenyl side group onto BDF-4,8-dione for synthesizing DiFPBTF were according to the previous literature.43–46 The polymer F13 was synthesized by the Stille polymerization reaction, with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, between (4,8-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (DiFPBDF-Sn) and 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (TBz-Br). Polymer F13 shows good solubility in chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, at room temperature and has a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 29.5 kDa as measured by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography with trichlorobenzene as the eluent.

The polymer geometry of polymer F13 was studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on optimized ground state geometry.47 As shown in Fig. 1c, the dihedral angles among BDF, thiophene π-bridge and difluorobenzotriazole units are small, and the dihedral angle between the BDF core and difluorophenyl side chains was ∼26° as obtained from the dimer model. In the side view of the polymer geometry (Fig. 1c), it can be seen that the chemical geometry of F13 exhibited a nearly planar backbone, which may result in strong intermolecular interactions and polymer chain packing with the assistance of F⋯H(F), F⋯S(O) and O⋯S interactions.48,49
Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized UV-Vis absorption of F13 in dilute chlorobenzene solution and solid film is shown in Fig. 1d. Both absorption spectra in solution and film exhibited strong intermolecular charge transfer peaks with well-defined vibronic absorption bands in the wavelength region of 450–650 nm, which have the same maximum peak at ∼550 nm in both solution and film with a shoulder peak at ∼590 nm. Furthermore, it can see that the absorption spectra in solution and solid film were almost identical, suggesting that polymer chains in solution may already possess similar aggregation behavior to that in the film state.50 The film absorption onset (λonset) was located at 642 nm which corresponds to a wide optical bandgap of 1.93 eV. In addition, the absorption spectrum of the narrow bandgap electron acceptor Y6 film is also shown in Fig. 1d. Its strong absorption in the ∼650–900 nm region is quite complementary to the absorption of F13, ensuring that the BHJ blend harvests photons in the solar light of ∼400–950 nm, which is favorable to achieve a high Jsc in NF-PSCs.
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was applied to measure the energy levels of F13 (Fig. S1†) and the energy level diagrams of materials used in the device are displayed in Fig. 1e. The onset oxidation potential was at 1.09 V vs. Ag/Ag+ with ITO as the working electrode, corresponding to the HOMO energy level of −5.54 eV. The expected lower-lying HOMO level of F13 is mainly attributed to strong electronegative fluorine atoms in the conjugated side chains and BDF unit as discussed above. The LUMO energy level was calculated to be −3.28 eV from the bandgap and HOMO level using the equation ELUMO = Eg + EHOMO. As shown in Fig. 1e, the LUMO level offset (ΔELUMO) between F13 and Y6 was 0.82 eV, which provides the sufficient driving force for efficient exciton dissociations. Furthermore, the small HOMO offset (ΔEHOMO) of 0.11 eV in F13 and Y6 is also favorable to reduce the energy loss (Eloss) and to produce a higher Voc during the exciton dissociation.
Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of F13 based NF-PSCs, inverted devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated and the small NF molecule Y6 was selected as the electron acceptor because of its good complementary absorption to F13. The in situ sol–gel ZnO used in our manuscript is in reference to literature reports.51,52 The active layer was spin-coated from the chloroform solution of F13:Y6 (1:1.5 wt) with 2-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the solvent additive to optimize the morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance.53 The resulting devices were tested under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 in air without encapsulation. The J–V curve of the pristine fabricated F13:Y6 device is shown in Fig. 2a. The device gave an impressive PCE of 12.71% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 22.61 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.28%. The Voc is consistent with the deep HOMO energy level of F13, which has been proved to be lower than that of BDT-based polymers,54 and the high Jsc should be attributed to the broad absorption of the F13:Y6 blend. The Eloss of the pristine fabricated device is 0.525 eV. More surprisingly, we found that the pristine fabricated device without encapsulation was able to perform better after aging for a certain time in ambient air or nitrogen at room temperature. As a result, a remarkable PCE of 13.34% could be obtained with the increased Voc of 0.815 V, higher Jsc 23.27 mA cm−2 and an almost identical FF of 70.37% after aging under nitrogen compared with the pristine fabricated device. The average power conversion efficiency is 12.17% from 7 independent devices.

In the aged device, the Eloss was reduced to 0.515 eV due to the increased Voc, which is one of the lowest among BDF polymer-based NF-PSCs (Table S1†).55 It is known that Voc is roughly proportional to the difference between the donor's HOMO and acceptor's LUMO levels, but there are other factors such as the donor/acceptor morphology and device interfacial layer that will also be able to induce a change in Voc.56 It is well known that minimizing photon energy loss (Eloss) is one of the critical strategies to improve the photovoltaic performance of NF-PSCs. Eloss is defined as Eloss = Eg − eVoc,57 and the Eloss values of most devices are usually greater than 0.6 eV in NF-PSCs. In the aged device, it is believed that the interactions between the active layer and anode buffer layer may play a role.58,59 The remarkably low Eloss values of F13-based NF-PSCs indicate that side chain design via a fluorinated aromatic ring and device interfacial layer optimization provide a facile strategy to decrease Eloss for the fabrication of highly efficient polymer solar cells. Furthermore, it is noted that the devices aged in air also showed an improved photovoltaic performance in comparison with the pristine fabricated device.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured to investigate the photoresponses of F13:Y6 cells and the EQE curve is shown in Fig. 2b. It can be seen that the device exhibited a broad photoresponse covering the range of 300 nm to near-infrared 950 nm and EQE values exceeded 70% in the broad range of 450 nm to 840 nm. It can also be seen that the contribution of F13 with a maximum EQE value of 83.1% in the short wavelength range of 300–650 nm was similar to that of Y6, which has a strong absorption in the long wavelength range of 650–950 nm with the highest EQE value of 86.7%. The results demonstrate that F13 and Y6 both have strong capability for harvesting solar light. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curve for the aged F13:Y6 device was 24.06 mA cm−2, which is well consistent with the Jsc as obtained from the J–V measurement with less than 5% error.
To study the charge transport properties of the F13:Y6 BHJ film, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was applied to measure the charge carrier mobilities.60,61 A hole-only device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/F13:Y6/MoO3/Ag and an electron-only device with the structure of ITO/ZnO/F13:Y6/Ca/Al were fabricated. The measured J–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation were 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, showing more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.1), which are more beneficial to the higher Jsc and FF obtained in the F13:Y6 NF-PSC.

To gain more insight into the charge recombination, the F13:Y6 device was illuminated under various light intensities (Plight) and the curve of Jscversus Plight is shown in Fig. 3c. In the relationship Jsc ∞ Pαlight, the α in the F13:Y6 NF-PSC was close to 1, which suggests that no significant energy barriers existed and almost all charges from exciton dissociation can be collected by the electrode prior to bimolecular recombination.62,63 To further probe the exciton dissociation process in NF-PSC, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the F13:Y6 device was measured and the curve is displayed in Fig. 3d. Jph is defined by the equation Jph = JLight − JDark, where JLight and JDark are the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is calculated from Veff = Voc − Vbias, whereas Voc is defined as the voltage when Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage.64 For the F13:Y6 device, Jph attains saturation (Jsat = 22.56 mA cm−2) at a Veff of more than 2 V, at which all photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the corresponding electrodes. It is known that the exciton dissociation probability is defined using the equation Pdiss = Jph/Jsat. As Jph calculated from Jph = JLight − JDark was 21.32 mA cm−2, Pdiss for F13:Y6 was estimated to be 95%, and this high probability suggests better exciton dissociation in the BHJ layer, leading to a significant improvement in Jsc in the NF-PSC.65
Aging effect on photovoltaic performance
As discussed above, device aging could further improve the photovoltaic performance of the F13:Y6 device. To better probe and understand the aging effect, the F13:Y6 devices were aged in ambient air and nitrogen and their photovoltaic performances at different aging times were measured. As shown in Fig. 4a and Table S2,† while the device was aged under nitrogen, the PCE gradually increased with increasing aging time, and 100% of the initial value of the pristine device could be retained even after ∼1220 hours of storage in nitrogen. The enhancement of the PCE with aging time was mainly due to the gradual increase in Jsc and FF during the initial few hundred hours, and then due to the higher Voc and Jsc since the FF started to decrease. The enhancement of Jsc and FF of the aged device possibly due to the post-annealing treatment induced favorable interfaces (see morphology characterization) in the aging process, which reduced the charge recombination and benefited the charge extraction improvement. Further longer aging time led to performance degradation due to the rapidly declined FF. Under ambient air conditions, an accelerated “burn-in” in the photovoltaic performance was found, which is believed to be mainly affected by oxygen and humidity.66,67 The PCE also gradually increased with increase in aging time during the first ∼400 hours, accompanied by the increase in Voc and FF, but with a decrease in Jsc. After that, the overall performance showed a slow “burn-in” progress with the lapse of time and reached ∼92% of its initial photovoltaic performance after aging in ambient air for ∼1150 hours (Fig. 4b, Table S3†). It should be mentioned that the device under ambient air conditions showed more significant Jsc loss than the device under nitrogen, indicating that oxygen and humidity may play a role in the degradation. From the results of device aging under ambient air and nitrogen conditions, it can be seen that the F13:Y6 device exhibited a very promising long term aging stability.
 Fig. 4  Normalized photovoltaic parameters of F13:Y6 devices without encapsulation as a function of aging time (a) under nitrogen and (b) in ambient air at room temperature. 
In the past years, the possible origins of “burn-in” efficiency loss were known and discussed, which may include electrode migration, morphology change of the active layer, spinodal demixing and photogenerated electronic trap states.66,68–71 In the case of F13:Y6 devices, it is speculated that the small “burn-in” efficiency loss after long time aging may be mainly attributed to the synergistic positive interactions of the stable micromorphology and hydrophobic active layer as well as MoO3 buffer layer.58,59,72 Benefiting from the hydrophobic fluorine atoms in the polymer F13 with two difluorophenyl conjugated side chains, the contact angle of F13:Y6 film generated from water droplets was found to be 104.7° (Fig. S2†), which could prevent the fast penetration of humidity into the active layer while the device was exposed to air. It is known that the morphological stability of the two phases in the BHJ layer is of high importance in determining the device performance. To explore the possible effect of the BHJ layer during the aging, the F13:Y6 film was first spin-coated onto ITO/ZnO and then was aged for 24 hours before MoO3/Ag anode evaporation (Fig. 5a). It is interesting that the pre-aged device showed similar device performance to the pristine fabricated device, and the aging results also revealed that the photovoltaic performance of the pre-aged device showed the same trend in comparison with the pristine fabricated device (Fig. 5c). It is noted that further increasing the aging time of F13:Y6 film prior to applying MoO3/Ag gave similar results as observed in the film after aging for 24 hours. These phenomena suggest that the F13:Y6 device has a relatively stable BHJ layer and interfacial microstructure during long term aging, and provides the basis for the outstanding long-term aging stability in terms of interfacial interactions with the MoO3 buffer layer.

The metal/active layer interface or interfacial interactions between the active layer and top electrode also have a significant effect on the device performance and stability because of their critical role in the charge extraction and energy loss.56 Thus, to explore the role of the MoO3 buffer layer in the F13:Y6 device, we chose to peel off the old MoO3/Ag electrode of an aged device and re-apply the new MoO3/Ag top electrode (Fig. 5b), and the photovoltaic performance was then tested normally. This method is an effective and powerful tool to distinguish the effects associated with the metal/active layer interface.73,74 Surprisingly, we found that the F13:Y6 device with the freshly applied MoO3/Ag top electrode gave a recovered PCE, close to that of the pristine fabricated device (Fig. 5d). This result suggests that the MoO3 interface degradation played a significant role in response to the “burn-in” efficiency loss, instead of the micromorphological structure change. Furthermore, the morphology of the active layer after peeling off the old top electrode was also examined. For better comparison purpose, the freshly spin-coated F13:Y6 film and the aged film were also measured. Fig. 6 depicts the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the films. As seen from Fig. 6a, d, b and e, the freshly spin-coated and aged films have very similar rough surfaces with root-mean-square (RMS) values of ∼3.21 and ∼2.87 nm, indicating the stable micromorphological structure of the F13:Y6 layer, which is also consistent with the similar photovoltaic performance observed in both devices. More excitingly, the film after peeling off the MoO3/Ag top electrode possessed a smoother morphology with a lower RMS of ∼1.28 nm (Fig. 6c and f). The results may imply that there are interfacial interactions between F13:Y6 and MoO3 layers, and the smoother film was formed through the inter-diffusion of the MoO3 hole-extraction interface. At the initial stage (short aging time), the slow inter-diffusion process will generate more and more strengthened interfacial contact between F13 and Y6, which will facilitate the charge selection, extraction and transfer through the interface. Similar results have been observed in the device with a WO3 buffer layer.75 This process can explain the improved FF and Jsc with increasing the initial aging time under nitrogen, and the significant loss of Jsc under ambient air conditions was attributed to the penetration of oxygen into the interface. The increased Voc in the aging devices should be ascribed to the suppressed non-radiative recombination due to the better charge extraction and transfer process through the strengthened interfacial contact.56,76 At longer aging times, the MoO3 will sink to a deeper position of the F13:Y6 layer, at which point it will be difficult to form a continuous interfacial layer with the Ag electrode, which will reduce the charge extraction and transfer efficiency thus leading to deteriorated photovoltaic performance.75,77

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also performed to probe the nanoscale morphology of pristine BHJ and aged BHJ, and the corresponding images are shown in Fig. 7a and b. As shown in Fig. 7a, the pristine BHJ shows a homogeneous film, the donor–acceptor (D–A) interpenetrating networks are not well developed and D–A domains were difficult to distinguish, suggesting the good miscibility of F13 and Y6. From Fig. 7b, we can find that the D–A domain morphology of the underlying interface in the aged BHJ became clear and distinguishable. Therefore, the corresponding interface between blend films and MoO3 layer can also possess a consistent improved and favorable morphology. Thus, the improved nanoscale morphology can be reasonably beneficial for exciton dissociation, charge generation and transport, leading to higher Jsc and FF in the aged devices.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were further performed to give insight into the molecular crystalline orientations and the aggregation behaviors of the polymer donor and acceptor in pristine and blend films. The GIWAXS patterns and corresponding line profiles of neat F13, Y6, MoO3 and F13:Y6 blend films are shown in Fig. 8. The F13 pristine film showed an ordered lamellar structure with a (h00) diffraction peak in both in-plane (Qxy) and out-of-plane (Qz) directions, indicating a preferential face-on orientation of F13 polymer chains, with a weaker stacking peak in the out-of-plan direction and bimodal lamellar peaks in both directions at 0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.93 Å). The Y6 film exhibited a strong stacking peak at Qz = 1.768 Å−1 (d = 3.54 Å) with the face-on orientation, which is similar to the literature.13 MoO3 film showed no such face-on or edge-on orientations as shown in Fig. 8a. In the F13:Y6 blend film a strong and broad π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane direction at Qz = 1.784 Å−1 can be found, corresponding to d = 3.53 Å, which was due to the π–π stacking of Y6. In the in-plane direction, the scattering peak at 0.30 Å−1 became stronger and was attributed to the lamellar stacking of F13 and/or Y6. Similarly, the diffraction peak at 0.40 Å−1 in the neat Y6 film can also be found in the blend film, and in addition, the diffraction peaks at 0.53 Å−1 and 0.77 Å−1 from neat F13 film disappear in the blend film. These results suggested that the more preferred face-on orientation in blend films is maintained, and the presence of Y6 in the blend film may promote more ordered orientation of F13 polymer chains, which, in combination with better-defined phase separation, will benefit high charge carrier mobilities and FF as obtained for the photovoltaic properties of the F13-based device.

Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a 2D BDF polymer F13 with a conjugated fluorinated side-chain and difluorobenzotriazole as the electron deficient comonomer. The coplanarity of polymer F13 was further enhanced by the conjugated phenyl side chains, which induced a strong aggregation tendency. The optical properties revealed that F13 has almost identical absorption spectra in solution and solid film, suggesting that the polymer chains in solution already possess strong intermolecular π–π stacking. The HOMO energy level of F13 was observed to be −5.54 eV as a result of the strong electronegative fluorine atoms and furan units. While applying F13 in NF-PSCs with Y6 as the electron acceptor, the pristine fabricated device gave a PCE of 12.7% with Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 22.61 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.28%, whereas for the aged device under either nitrogen or ambient air conditions, the PCEs were found to increase in the first tens to hundreds of hours. The best PCE was 13.34% with a Voc of 0.815 V, Jsc of 23.27 mA cm−2 and FF of 70.37%. The detailed investigations demonstrate that the interfacial interactions between the anode buffer and active layers played a critical role in the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance, and the blend film of F13 and Y6 also provided a stable micromorphological structure. The un-encapsulated F13:Y6 device aged under nitrogen and ambient air conditions retained more than 92% of its original PCE even after aging for ∼1370 hours and ∼1150 hours, respectively, showing quite promising stabilities. The results demonstrate that BDF-based polymers show great promise for achieving highly efficient PSCs toward commercial applications with rational molecular design and device engineering.
