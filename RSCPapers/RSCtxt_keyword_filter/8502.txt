    First published on 9th September 2014AbstractBatteries and supercapacitors as electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices are continuously serving for human life. The electrochemical performance of batteries and supercapacitors depends in large part on the active materials in electrodes. As an important family, Mn-based oxides have shown versatile applications in primary batteries, secondary batteries, metal–air batteries, and pseudocapacitors due to their high activity, high abundance, low price, and environmental friendliness. In order to meet future market demand, it is essential and urgent to make further improvements in energy and power densities of Mn-based electrode materials with the consideration of multiple electron reaction and low molecular weight of the active materials. Meanwhile, nanomaterials are favourable to achieve high performance by means of shortening the ionic diffusion length and providing large surface areas for electrode reactions. This article reviews the recent efforts made to apply nanostructured Mn-based oxides for batteries and pseudocapacitors. The influence of structure, morphology, and composition on electrochemical performance has been systematically summarized. Compared to bulk materials and notable metal catalysts, nanostructured Mn-based oxides can promote the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrochemical reactions occurring at the solid–liquid or the solid–liquid–gas interface. In particular, nanostructured Mn-based oxides such as one-dimensional MnO2 nanostructures, MnO2–conductive matrix nanocomposites, concentration-gradient structured layered Li-rich Mn-based oxides, porous LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 nanorods, core–shell structured LiMnSiO4@C nanocomposites, spinel-type Co–Mn–O nanoparticles, and perovskite-type CaMnO3 with micro–nano structures all display superior electrochemical performance. This review should shed light on the sustainable development of advanced batteries and pseudocapacitors with nanostructured Mn-based oxides.

1. Introduction
Electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices such as batteries and supercapacitors have been widely applied in the fields of portable electronic products, electric vehicles, and smart electrical grids. Systems of electrochemical energy storage and conversion such as Li-ion batteries (LIBs), Li–O2 batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors have been particularly developed.1–3 The electrode materials which directly participate in or indirectly catalyze electrochemical reactions play a key role in improving the capability of energy storage and promoting the efficiency and the rate of energy conversion.4–6 Among various electrode materials, Mn-based oxides have received a lot of interest because of high nature abundance, low price as well as various crystal structures and phases (Fig. 1).7–10 Furthermore, Mn-based oxides have versatile applications and excellent performance in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. For example, nanostructured MnO2 exhibits outstanding discharge capacity in primary Zn–MnO2 batteries and specific capacitance in pseudocapacitance,11,12 spinel-type LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 displays a high discharge plateau and superior cycling and rate performance in LIBs,13,14 and perovskite CaMnO3 delivers high oxygen reduction potential and large current density in oxygen reduction reactions.15 The recent efforts made to employ nanostructured Mn-based oxides for batteries and capacitors with high energy and power density have been widely investigated. However, full consideration for the relationship between nanostructure and electrochemical performance is still limited. It is thus that this article reviews the advantages and challenges of nanostructured Mn-based oxides for the applications of electrochemical energy storage and conversion such as in the fields of batteries and supercapacitors.

(b) Crystal structure of rutile β-MnO2, tetragonal spinel Mn3O4, rock salt MnO, cubic spinel LiMn2O4, perovskite CaMnO3, and olivine LiMnPO4. 
As the nanoscience and nanotechnology develop, nanostructured materials have attracted more and more people's attention, especially in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Previous studies have demonstrated that the size effects of nanostructured materials to some extent improve the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrochemical reactions. In batteries, electrochemical reactions of the electrodes are the bridge of conversion between electrical and chemical energy. According to the thermodynamic principle, electrochemical transformation obeys the basic thermodynamic equations as follows:16,17 ED = E × Q(1) (2) (3)where ED is the energy density, E is the electromotive force of an electrochemical reaction, Q is the theoretical gravimetric specific capacity, ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, n is the electron transferred number in stoichiometric reaction, F is the Faraday constant, and Mw is the equivalent molecular weight. Because energy density is the product of Q and E, high energy density means high voltage and high capacity. High voltage originates from high chemical potential of cathode materials and low chemical potential of anode materials, while high capacity derives from multiple electron reaction and low molecular weight of the active materials (Fig. 2a). Nanostructures can improve energy density.18 On one hand, nanostructure can increase the utilization of the active materials and initiate new lithium storage space such as micropores, leading to higher capacity than bulk counterparts. On the other hand, nanostructure can reduce the polarization of the electrochemical reaction to enhance the working voltage. In addition, some electrochemical reactions cannot occur in bulk counterparts, unless turning the active materials into nanosize or nanoporous structures.18,19 Among various electrode materials, Mn-based oxide nanomaterials show outstanding properties. For example, Li-rich layered Li(Li1/3−2x/3MxMn2/3−x/3)O2 with low molecular weight delivers a high specific capacity of ∼300 mA h g−1. Spinel-type LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 has a high operating voltage of around 4.7 V vs. Li+/Li.14 Polyanion-type Li2MnSiO4 can achieve a two-electron exchange reaction with a theoretical capacity of 333 mA h g−1 in LIBs.20

High energy density means a strong oxidizing cathode and a reducing anode as well as multiple electron reaction and low molecular weight of active materials. High power density means facile electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion. (c) Schematic illustration of electronic conduction and ionic transport within bulk counterparts and nanomaterials. Nanostructure can effectively improve the thermodynamics and kinetics. 
In comparison, metal–air batteries have shown larger theoretical specific energy than that of lithium-ion batteries. For instance, the Li–air system possesses a theoretical specific energy of nearly 11700 W h kg−1 (for anode). However, the oxygen cathode of metal–air cell needs an efficient catalyst to promote the sluggish kinetics. Nanostructured materials with porous features and relatively larger surface areas favor the electrolyte immersion and Li+ ion/oxygen diffusion, inducing more active contact sites than bulk counterparts. Nevertheless, traditional catalysts are mainly notable metal nanocrystals which are rare and expensive, so it is difficult to achieve in future widespread development of metal–air batteries. Owing to low cost and high abundance of Mn-based oxides, developing nanostructured Mn-based oxides has attracted extensive attention. Mn-based oxides (e.g., MnO2, spinel CoxMn3−xO4, and perovskite CaMnO3) along with various nanostructures all deliver high catalytic activity of oxygen reduction–evolution reactions in metal–air batteries.21–23 Therefore, Mn-based oxides as nonprecious electrocatalysts exhibit sustainable application prospects.
In supercapacitors, energy density can be calculated as follows:24 (4) (5)where C is the capacitance, A is the area of the electrode surface, ε is the medium dielectric constant, and d is the effective thickness of the electrical double layer. For electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), only 0.17–0.20e− per atom is adsorbed on the surface of electrode materials.25 Recently, pseudocapacitors have been particularly attractive because of their battery-level energy density.26 Nanostructure has large surface area to achieve high capacitance, and MnO2 as the electrode material of pseudocapacitors possesses a theoretical specific capacitance of 1370 F g−1.7 However, the practical capacitance is only 200–600 F g−1, so the full potential of Mn-based oxides needs to be further exploited.
Thermodynamics describe the maximum energy release or storage for an electrochemical reaction, while kinetics decide the reaction rate which is associated with charge transport (in the electrolyte and the active materials) and charge transfer (in the two phase interface). To electric vehicles for example, the longest travel distance is determined by thermodynamics and the fastest travel speed relates to kinetics. The kinetics can be expressed by the following equations (eqn (6)–(9) for batteries and eqn (10) for capacitors):16,27,28 PD = E × I(6) (7) (8) (9) (10)where PD is the power density, I is the current, i0 is the exchanging current, α is the transfer coefficient, η is the polarization, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, A is the temperature-independent coefficient, Ea is the apparent activation energy, Rct is the charge transform impedance, and Rs is the equivalent inner impedance. High power density needs large i0 and effective mass transport, which means facile electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion (Fig. 2b). For batteries, nanosized electrode materials facilitate the improvement of kinetics due to the increased reaction interface and the reduced diffusion path for ionic intercalation and deintercalation.2,29–31 In general, the relationship among the ionic diffusion time (τ) in the host material, the ionic diffusion length (Lion), and the ionic diffusion coefficient (Dion) can be described as follows:18 (11)
For similar Dion, τ increases proportionately with the square of Lion. In other words, the ionic diffusion time can reduce by two orders of magnitude when the ionic diffusion length is changed from 100 nm to 10 nm. Therefore, nanostructure benefits the complete utilization of the active materials at high current density (Fig. 2c). Among various nanostructures, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanowires, and nanorods have received considerable interest because of their rapid electron transport along the 1D direction and the short ionic diffusion distance along the radial direction.32–34 For pseudocapacitors, the limitations of ionic diffusion are removed, leading to high power density. Nanostructured materials shorten the electronic transport and ionic diffusion distance to further improve the rate performance.35 However, nanostructured materials are plagued by low volumetric energy density owing to low tapping density and undesirable side reactions which are induced by their highly reactive surface. Recently, hierarchical micro–nano structure has been an effective strategy to solve the problems, which can maintain the advantages of micromaterials and nanomaterials.36,37
In this review, recent efforts made to use nanostructured Mn-based oxides for batteries and capacitors with high energy and power density are summarized. The synthetic method and applications of nanostructured Mn-based oxides in primary batteries, Li secondary batteries, metal–air batteries, and pseudocapacitors are introduced in the following sections. The relationship between nanostructure and electrochemical performance is discussed in detail. The challenges and perspectives of Mn-based oxides are proposed for further development in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.
2. MnO2 as cathode material for primary batteries
Primary batteries as facile and convenient chemical power sources have been widely applied to civil and military facilities such as flashlight, radio, and wristwatches. Primary batteries are fabricated in a “charged” state; while after discharging, primary batteries cannot be charged again. Typical primary batteries include primary Zn–MnO2, Li–MnO2, and Mg–MnO2 batteries. MnO2 is usually used as cathode materials. Table 1 summarizes the electrochemical reactions, potential, and discharge capacity of common primary batteries. The essential obstacle of primary batteries is their low utilization efficiency of the active materials, resulting in low practical capacity and large electrochemical polarization. The development of nanostructured materials offers an intriguing strategy to increase the discharge capacity and operating voltage of primary batteries.

MnO2 can be obtained from nature, chemical synthesis (e.g., hydrothermal–solvothermal, sol–gel, template, deposition, and micro-lacteous methods), and electrochemical preparation (e.g., electrochemical reactions, electro-deposition, and electrospinning).7,38–44Table 2 summarizes the crystallographic structure, morphology, and synthesis method with the corresponding reaction equations of several nanostructured MnO2. Facile hydrothermal methods were used to prepare the MnO2 nanomaterials with 1D shapes (nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes), 2D hierarchical forms (hexagramlike and dendritelike), and 3D morphologies (flowerlike nanospheres). The γ-MnO2 nanoflake, nanoneedle, and nanorod films were synthesized through convenient electrodeposition techniques. Hollow MnO2 spheres and cubes were obtained by simple decomposition of MnCO3 precursors.

2.1 Zn–MnO2 batteries
Among various portable batteries, primary Zn–MnO2 batteries accounted for about 90% of the total sales per year due to their low cost and environmental compatibility.49 In 1860, Leclanché first reported the carbon–zinc battery using zinc foil as an anode, natural MnO2 and carbon black as cathodes, and ZnCl2–NH4Cl (aq) as an electrolyte. In the following hundred years, commercial Zn–MnO2 batteries composed of a mixture of electrolytic MnO2 the graphite cathode, the Zn anode, and the synthetic gel electrolyte are widely used. The discharge product of the MnO2 cathode is MnOOH, the theoretical capacity is 308 mA h g−1, but practical capacity is usually less than 250 mA h g−1. Increasing the utilization of the active materials is a supreme challenge of Zn–MnO2 batteries. As the synthetic technology of nanomaterials develops, nanostructured MnO2 has been attempted to solve the problem.11,50
The previous research indicates that the electrochemical performance of MnO2 is mainly related to three factors: crystallographic structure, crystalline size, and microcosmic morphology.11,47 MnO2 can form various structural forms such as α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and λ-type through different connection ways of the basic structural units (i.e., MnO6 octahedron). By changing the synthetic methods, particle size and morphology of the MnO2 cathode are controllably modified. Fig. 3 shows the crystal structures, reaction equations, and discharge curves of nanostructured and bulk MnO2 prepared by our group.39 For alkaline Zn–MnO2 batteries, the discharge capacity decreases in the order of nano-γ > nano-α > bulk-γ ≫ nano-β. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, α-, β-, and γ-MnO2, respectively, form (2 × 2), (1 × 1), and (1 × 2) tunnels via the different connection ways of the MnO6 octahedron. A large tunnel is favorable for ionic diffusion, so nanostructured γ- and α-MnO2 deliver higher capacity than that of nanostructured β-MnO2. However, the tunnels of α-MnO2 usually contain impure cations and small molecules such as NH4+, K+, or H2O originated from the raw materials in the solution-based process. These impure cations and small molecules stabilize the frame of α-MnO2, but hamper the ionic diffusion and intercalation, leading to worse performance than that of nanostructured γ-MnO2. The former reports have confirmed that various nanostructured MnO2 electrodes show better performance than that of bulk MnO2. Nanostructured γ-MnO2 displayed a high discharge capacity of 267 mA h g−1, but the capacity of bulk γ-MnO2 was less than 150 mA h g−1. Notably, the discharge capacity of nanostructured α-MnO2 was even higher than that of the bulk γ-MnO2. Nanostructured MnO2 has high surface area, which ameliorates the effective contact between the active materials and the electrolyte, resulting in low internal resistance, fast proton diffusion, and high utilization efficiency.

The electrolytic technique is a common method to prepare nanostructured MnO2 with different morphologies. The as-obtained thin film electrode avoids using the conducting and binding agents, which is in favor of the study on the intrinsic properties of active materials. The γ-MnO2 nanorod films delivered the highest discharge capacity of 269 mA h g−1 due to their fascinating 1D nanostructure, while γ-MnO2 nanoflake films displayed a high potential plateau (∼1.0 V).47 In addition, as MnO2 is a semiconductor with poor electronic conductivity, conducting polymer coating is an effective strategy to enhance the conductivity.51
2.2 Li–MnO2 batteries
Primary lithium batteries have also attracted a lot of interest because the molecular weight of lithium is the smallest among all metal elements. Unlike Zn–MnO2 batteries, the electrolytes of Li–MnO2 batteries are non-aqueous, and the discharge product of the cathode is LixMnO2. The effects of structure and morphology on the electrochemical performance of Li–MnO2 batteries are also worth researching. α-MnO2 possesses a hollandite-type structure with the (2 × 2) tunnel which facilitates the diffusion of Li+ ions. Hermann's group52 reported the preparation of α-MnO2 nanofibers with 100 nm diameter by combining the sol–gel route and the template method, showing the discharge capacity of 183 mA h g−1 that corresponds to the composition of Li0.6MnO2. Kijima et al.53 synthesized Li-inserted α-MnO2via soaking the α-MnO2 powder in a mixed solution of LiOH and LiNO3. Rietveld refinement determined that Li-inserted α-MnO2 is (Li2O)0.12MnO2 with the hollandite-type structure. (Li2O)0.12MnO2 showed higher capacity and an average voltage than those of α-MnO2. Our group prepared 1D α-MnO2 nanostructures through a hydrothermal method. The discharge curve exhibits a flat plateau between 3.0 and 2.5 V with the capacity of 204.4 mA h g−1 (Fig. 3e).
Nanostructured γ-MnO2 can display a capacity of more than 210 mA h g−1 in a Li–MnO2 battery, but its average voltage is lower than α-MnO2.39 Bowden and co-authors synthesized Li-inserted γ-MnO2 by heat treating the mixture of electrolytic γ-MnO2 and LiOH. The Li-inserted γ-MnO2 showed a capacity of around 210 mA h g−1 and a discharge plateau of about 2.9 V. Some reports focused on the effects of heat treatment on electrochemical performance of electrolytic γ-MnO2.54–57 It is found that heat treatment can change the cell volume, crystallite size, oxygen content, valance of Mn, and BET surface area of γ-MnO2. Among these complex factors, a high ratio of Mn(IV)/Mn(III) combined with low (but non-zero) cation defects are very important to improve the capacity and plateau potential. Through heating under air at 400 °C, the treated MnO2 delivered a high capacity of 266 mA h g−1 at 5 mA g−1.56
β-MnO2 possesses very narrow (1 × 1) tunnels, which obstructs the diffusion of Li+ ions, leading to low potential and capacity. However, Bruce's group19 reported a high capacity (280 mA h g−1) of ordered mesoporous β-MnO2 prepared by a template process. The performance was attributed to its high surface area and interconnected porous nanostructure. Doping with heteroatoms (e.g., Fe and V) is also an effective strategy to anisotropically change the lattice parameters of heat treated β-MnO2, which enlarges the diffusion channel of Li+ ions.58,59
λ-MnO2 can deliver a capacity of more than 220 mA h g−1 with two plateaus of 4 V and 3 V, resulting in higher energy density than that of heat treated α-, β-, or γ-MnO2.60 However, λ-MnO2 is usually prepared by etching out the Li of the LiMn2O4 spinel, while LiMn2O4 is a cathode of LIBs. Preparing the electrode materials of primary batteries by using the electrode materials of secondary batteries as starting materials is uneconomical.
2.3 Mg–MnO2 batteries
Mg–MnO2 batteries are also aqueous primary batteries. The Mg anode has a low redox potential (2.36 V vs. SHE) and high specific capacity (2.2 A h g−1), but the dense passivation film formed on the surface of Mg anode decreases the utilization and kinetics of the Mg anode, leading to a high corrosion rate.45 Using the nanostructured electrode materials with the modified electrolyte is an effective strategy to solve the problem. Mg–MnO2 batteries composed of the γ-MnO2 nanowires, Mg micro/nanospheres, and the mixed electrolyte of Mg(NO3)2 and NaNO2 display long discharge plateaus at 1.44 V and a high specific discharge capacity of 768 mA h g−1 because of the sufficient electrochemical contact and low electrode polarization.45 For MnO2 nanoparticles, shortening the particle size can increase the discharge capacity and energy density.61 The nanostructured MnO2–graphene composites improve the conductivity, leading to better performance than bare MnO2.62 The main problems of Mg–MnO2 batteries focus on the anode and the electrolyte, the nanostructured MnO2 only partially improves the performance.
3. Mn-based oxides as electrode materials for rechargeable Li-ion batteries
Primary batteries cannot be recycled and random discard may cause environmental pollution. The rechargeable batteries can achieve the repeated conversion between electrical energy and stored chemical energy, which meets the stringent requirements for various electronic devices and large-scale electricity storage.5,63 Among a wide variety of rechargeable batteries, LIBs dominate the rechargeable battery market segment.30,64 However, present commercial LIBs based on the LiCoO2 cathode and the graphite anode can hardly satisfy the demand of high energy and power density (i.e., high capacity, high voltage, and high-rate performance). Many Mn-based oxides are explored as the electrodes of LIBs. For example, MnxOy can be reversibly cycled via the conversion reactions between manganese oxides and metallic Mn.40,65 Spinel-type LiMn2O4 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as cathode materials have also received a lot of interest because of their high discharge plateaus and fast ionic diffusion.13,66 Layered manganese oxides as cathode materials have widely studied owing to their high theoretical capacity.67,68 Polyanion-type Li2MnSiO4 achieves a 2e− reaction with a theoretical capacity of 333 mA h g−1.20,69Table 3 lists the electrochemical reactions, plateau potential, and theoretical capacity of Mn-base oxides as electrode materials of LIBs. These efforts demonstrate that manganese oxides are promising candidates in the applications for LIBs.

3.1 Binary manganese oxides
In earlier research studies, attempts have been made to convert Li–MnO2 primary batteries to the Li–MnO2 secondary batteries, but the discharge capacities rapidly fade because of the conversion from MnO2 to LiMn2O4. The 1D nanostructure can slow the decay, but not stop the decay.39 The ordered mesoporous structure not only accommodates the volume changes but also provides the diffusion channels of Li+ ions, which effectively improves the cycling and rate performance.19 Furthermore, the lithium dendrites may cause a security threat, which restricts the development of Li–MnO2 batteries.
Various binary Mn-based oxides (e.g., MnO2, Mn3O4, and MnO) can serve as anode materials of LIBs based on electrochemical conversion reactions. Our group synthesized nanoporous γ-MnO2 hollow nanocubes and microspheres via a hydrothermal route combined with thermal treatment.40 The as-prepared γ-MnO2 microspheres and nanocubes displayed the first discharge capacities of 1289.0 and 1992.6 mA h g−1, respectively. After 20 cycles, the discharge capacities of γ-MnO2 microspheres and nanocubes decayed to 602.1 and 656.5 mA h g−1, respectively. The morphology and particle size have intensive effects on the reaction interface and electrochemical performance. The as-prepared γ-MnO2 nanocubes have smaller particle size and larger surface area, leading to a shorter diffusion distance of Li+ ions and more efficient contact with the conductive carbon and the electrolyte.
Mn3O4 is also a potential anode material for LIBs, but its low electronic conductivity (∼10−7–10−8 S cm−1) and large volume change during the cycles restrain the capacity. Loading Mn3O4 nanoparticles on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is an effective approach to improve the capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability.70 The Mn3O4–rGO composite showed discharge capacities of ∼780 mA h g−1 at 400 mA g−1 and ∼390 mA h g−1 at 1600 mA g−1. The high performance is attributed to highly conductive rGO which not only enhances the electronic conductivity but also restricts the growth and aggregation of Mn3O4 nanoparticles during the cycles.
MnO is one of the widely studied anode materials but shares the same problems as Mn3O4. Designing nanofilms or nanoporous structure can accommodate the volume change, leading to improved cycling performance. The nanocrystalline MnO thin film displayed a discharge capacity of 425 mA h g−1 at 0.125 C after 25 cycles.77 The porous MnO microspheres delivered a capacity of 800 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 along with capacity retention of 88% after 50 cycles.78 The porous MnO nanoflakes showed a high reversible capacity of 648 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 246 mA g−1.79 Another common strategy is combining nanostructured MnO with conductive materials such as coaxial MnO–C nanotubes,80 MnO–C core–shell nanorods,81,82 MnO–rGO composites,83 porous MnO–C disks,84 and MnO@C core–shell nanoplates.85 Nanostructured MnO–C composites gain improved conductivity, acceptable restricted volume change, and durable high-rate capability. MnO–C nanopeapods showed high capacities of 1119 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and 463 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1 as well as no capacity fading and morphology change after 1000 cycles at 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 4).71 The MnO–graphene hybrid anode exhibited high reversible capacity (2014 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 200 mA g−1), excellent long-term cyclability (843.3 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 2000 mA g−1) and superior high-rate capability (625.8 mA h g−1 at 3000 mA g−1).65 Noticeably, MnO–C composites usually undergo a stage of capacity increase during the early cycles, and the reversible capacity is higher than the theoretical capacities of both MnO (756 mA h g−1) and carbon (grapheme: 744 mA h g−1 and graphite: 372 mA h g−1) at low current density. It may be attributed to that Mn2+ are oxidized to a higher oxidation state,65 but the detailed reaction mechanism needs to be further studied.

Though nanostructure binary Mn-based oxides improve the rate and cycling performance, the high capacity is only obtained during charge to 3 V. As known, because anode materials need low charge plateaus, binary Mn-based oxides are difficult to meet this requirement. Recently, much attention has been focused on Mn-based composite oxides.
3.2 Layered Mn-based oxides
LiCoO2 as the first commercial cathode material of LIBs has an ordered layered structure with an Rm space group. LiCoO2 has a high theoretical capacity of 274 mA h g−1 and a plateau potential of 3.9 V, but the practical capacity is only ∼140 mA h g−1.86 Furthermore, LiCoO2 suffers from high price and safety hazards. Although layered LiMnO2 has a high practical capacity of ∼200 mA h g−1 and low cost, it is difficult to be synthesized because of the inferior thermodynamic stability, which also hinders its practical commercialization.86 In addition, Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ can cause the phase conversion and the disproportionation reaction of Mn3+ leads to the manganese dissolution. Layered Mn-based oxides are also plagued by oxygen evolution at high charging potential to cause serious safety issues. Orthorhombic LiMnO2 (o-LiMnO2) with Pmnm symmetry is also attempted as a cathode for LIBs owing to its high theoretical capacity ∼285 mA h g−1.72 However, o-LiMnO2 easily transforms into a spinel-like phase during the charge–discharge process, leading to awful cyclability. To solve these problems, nanostructured LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, and Li-rich phase Li-rich Li(Li1/3−2x/3MxMn2/3−x/3)O2 are proposed.

3.2.1 Layered LiNixMn1−xO2. 
Ni and Mn cations can appear randomly in transition metal layers with all ratios to form a LiNixMn1−xO2 solid solution. When x ≥ 0.5, the solid solution shows a hexagonal α-NaFeO2 structure, while when x < 0.5, the spinel structure is formed by reconstitution reactions.86 In 1992, Dahn's group studied the structure and electrochemistry of the solid-solution series LiyNixMn1−xO2 (0.5 < x < 1 and y near 1).87 The results showed that the reversibly capacity decreased with the increase of x. After that, Ohzuku et al. systematically investigated the LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cathode which delivered a discharge capacity of ∼200 mA h g−1 with a plateau potential of 3.8 V.88 LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 is layered-hexagonal structure with Rm symmetry, and Li+, Ni2+, and Mn4+ are arranged in the lithium layer and the transition metal layer. During cycling, the redox reaction involves a change from Ni2+ to Ni4+, whereas Mn4+ remains, which avoids the Jahn–Teller distortions of Mn3+.89 However, about 10% Ni and Li ions may exchange in the lithium and transition metal layers,90 leading to sluggish ionic diffusion. The rate capability of LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 can be improved by modifying the surface,91 adjusting the ratio of Ni and Mn,73 and synthesizing the nanostructure.92,93 Sun et al.91 prepared AlF3 coated LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 which displayed better rate performance and thermal stability than bare LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2. The results showed that the ∼10 nm AlF3 layer effectively reduced Ni and Mn dissolution and inhibited the decomposition of the organic electrolyte. Liu and co-works synthesized LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 nanosheets by using the flower-like MnO2 nanosheets as a precursor.92 An initial discharge capacity of 162 mA h g−1 was exhibited at 0.6 C, with a retention of 100% after 100 cycles, which illustrated that the two-dimensional (2D) nanostructure facilitated fast Li-intercalation–deintercalation kinetics and structural stability. Park and co-authors94 fabricated lithium-deficient LixMn0.67Ni0.33O2 nanowires by a hydrothermal method using the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 powder as a precursor. The LixMn0.67Ni0.33O2 nanowires delivered a reversible capacity of ∼230 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 owing to their 1D nanostructure.


3.2.2 Layered LiNi1−x−yCoyMnxO2. 
Ternary transition metal oxide, LiNi1−x−yCoyMnxO2, potentially combines the advantages of LiCoO2, LiNiO2, and LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 to achieve a practical capacity of ∼210 mA h g−1. Though the values of x and y can be adjusted in a wide range, most reports were focused on two series of ternary transition metal oxides (i.e., LiNixMnxCo1−2xO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) and LiNi1−2xCoxMnxO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3)). Whittingham's group95 reported a systematic study of the rate and cycling performance of LiNixMnxCo1−2xO2 (x = 0.5, 0.45, 0.4, and 1/3). The LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 delivered the highest capacity at a high current density of 3 mA cm−2, and the LiNi0.4Mn0.4Co0.2O2 exhibited comparable performance and lower cost. For LiNi1−2xCoxMnxO2 cathode materials, Ni-rich layered LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 composed of Ni3+, Co3+, and Mn3+ displays the highest capacity, but suffers from poor cycling performance owing to the structural transformation.96 To exert synergistic effects of several LiNi1−x−yCoyMnxO2 materials, core–shell structure using core material with high capacity and shell material with high stability is attempted. Sun et al.97 reported a spherical core–shell structure with a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 core and a LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 shell which delivered superior cyclability and thermal stability at 1 C for 500 cycles. Then, Sun's group98 designed a concentration-gradient cathode material with a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 core, a LiNi0.8−xCo0.1+yMn0.1+zO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.34, 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.13, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.21) outer layer, and a LiNi0.46Co0.23Mn0.31O2 surface. The concentration-gradient cathode material exhibited a high capacity of 209 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C with the capacity retention of 96% after 50 cycles.
Meanwhile, LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 which is proposed by Ohzuku et al.99 has also been investigated extensively. LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 possesses an O3 type layered structure with a superlattice based on R30-type in Wood's notation, resulting in a more stable structure than the basic layered oxides such as LiCoO2, LiNiO2, and LiMnO2.100 The performance of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 can be improved by manufacturing the nanostructure,74,101,102 adjusting the surface,103–105 doping other cations.106,107 Nanostructured LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, which is usually prepared by co-precipitation with further heat treatment, can facilitate the Li+ ion intercalation–deintercalation process to obviously improve rate performance. The LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 hexagonal nanobricks with a high percentage of exposed {010} facets showed ∼130 mA h g−1 at 15 C.108 The cycle performance and thermal stability can be enhanced by surface coating. Li's group109 prepared a series of 1D layered Mn-based oxide nanobelts, which exhibited impressive performance benefiting from the surface-Li2TiO3-rich coating layer.


3.2.3 Layered Li-rich Li(Li1/3−2x/3MxMn2/3−x/3)O2. 
Though much effort has been made to improve the performance of Li-stoichiometric layered Mn-based oxides, the capacity is very difficult to excess 220 mA h g−1. Recently, Li-rich layered Li(Li1/3−2x/3MxMn2/3−x/3)O2 (M =Ni, Mn) has been proposed because of its initial discharge capacity of 300 mA h g−1 and reversible capacity of ∼250 mA h g−1.67,75,110,111 The Li-rich layered Mn-based oxides are designed based on Li2MnO3 which has a layered monoclinic structure with C2/m symmetry. The Li-rich layered Mn-based oxides are represented as a solid solution of the Li2MnO3 and Li-stoichiometric layered Mn-based oxides, so they can also be expressed as xLi2MnO3·(1 − x)LiM1−yMnyO2. The Li-rich layered Mn-based oxides suffer from large initial irreversible capacity, phase transformation during the cycles, and poor rate performance. To solve these problems, many nanostructures have been attempted.111–114 Cho's group113,115 prepared Li0.88(Li0.18Co0.33Mn0.49)O2 and Li(Li0.15Ni0.25Mn0.6)O2 nanowires by a hydrothermal method using Co0.4Mn0.6O2 and Ni0.3Mn0.7O2 as precursors, respectively. The Li0.88(Li0.18Co0.33Mn0.49)O2 nanowires exhibited a reversible capacity of 230 mA h g−1 at 3600 mA g−1 (15 C) and Li(Li0.15Ni0.25Mn0.6)O2 nanowires showed a discharge capacity of 311 mA h g−1 at 0.3 C with capacity retention of 95% after 80 cycles. Jiang et al.116 fabricated nanocrystal-assembled hollow 0.3Li2MnO3·0.7LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 microspheres by a template route. The as-obtained hollow spheres displayed a high reversible capacity of 295 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Our group111 synthesized porous 0.2Li2MnO3·0.8LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 nanorods assembled with nanoparticles through a solid-state reaction by using LiOH, Ni(NO3)2, and porous Mn2O3 nanowires as starting materials. As shown in Fig. 5, an initial discharge capacity of 275 mA h g−1 was delivered at 0.2 C, with a capacity decay of ∼10% after 100 cycles. The good performance was attributed to the porous 1D nanostructure which not only accommodated the intrinsic volume change but also reduced the diffusion distance of Li+ ions. Surface modification is also an effective means to decrease the first irreversible capacity and improve the rate capability. Manthiram's group reported a series of functional surface modifications for Li-rich layered Li(Li1/3−2x/3NixMn2/3−x/3)O2 such as Al2O3, RuO2, AlPO4 and CoPO4.117,118 The coating of Li(Li0.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 with 1 wt% Al2O3 and 1 wt% RuO2 exhibited a high capacity of 280 mA h g−1 at 0.05 C and a capacity retention of 94.3% after 30 cycles.117

Large initial irreversible capacity, sluggish Li+ ion diffusion, and poor cycling stability are the main problems of layered Mn-based oxides. Nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanorods, nanosheets, hollow structure, porous structure, and core–shell structure can enhance the rate and cycling performance. Table 4 lists the synthetic method, discharge capacity, cyclability, and rate capability of several nanostructured layered Mn-base oxides. From Table 4, it is difficult to obtain high capacity at a large current rate (>10 C) and the capacity retention is relatively low after over 100 cycles. The surface coating with oxides, fluorides, and phosphates can reduce the surface reactivity to effectively improve the initial columbic efficiency and cycle life, but it cannot absolutely avoid their internal phase transformation. Doping with other elements may promote the structure stability, but it is a challenge for the synthetic method. Therefore, spinel-type Mn-based oxides with high working potential and rate performance and polyanion-type Mn-based oxides with high specific capacity and thermal stability are proposed.

3.3 Spinel-type Mn-based oxides
Spinel-type Mn-based oxides mainly include LiMn2O4 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. Though the theoretical specific capacity of spinel-type Mn-based oxides is lower than those of layered Mn-based oxides, their rate performance is outstanding. Spinel-type Mn-based oxides may become ideal cathode materials of power batteries.

3.3.1 Spinel-type LiMn2O4. 
As an appealing cathode material which offers high power capability and excellent safety, spinel LiMn2O4 has been exhaustively studied in the last 30 years. In the early 1980s, Thackeray et al. discovered that the [B2]X4 framework of many stable A[B2]X4 spinels can provide a stable host structure for the electrochemical insertion and extraction of lithium.119,120 Ohzuku et al.121 studied the electrochemistry of spinel-related manganese dioxide in the lithium nonaqueous cell, which proposed the classic reaction mechanism of LixMn2O4 (0 < x < 2) during the lithium insertion process. Later, Tarascon et al. successfully applied LiMn2O4 as the cathode in rechargeable rocking-chair batteries based on the carbon anode. Such batteries show the advantages of long cycling life, a high average open circuit voltage of 3.7 V, high power and low cost, being widely used in various areas.122,123
LiMn2O4 is a cubic spinel with space symmetry Fd3m. The oxygen ions are cubic close packed in the 32e positions. The manganese ions are located on the 16d octahedral sites, while the lithium ions are positioned on the 8a tetrahedral sites. The MnO6 octahedral in the spinel structure is edge-shared and forms a continuous 3D cubic array, thus resulting in a robust Mn2O4 spinel framework. The 8a tetrahedral shares each of their four faces with neighboring vacant 16c octahedral. During the lithium extraction process, the lithium ions could move from one 8a site into another 8a site via an adjacent 16c site in three different directions.124 Lithium extraction occurs at approximately 4 V (vs. Li+/Li) in a two-stage process (LiMn2O4/Li0.5Mn2O4 and Li0.5Mn2O4/λ-MnO2) with a 150 mV voltage difference. The high voltage stage was ascribed to the two phase reaction caused by lithium ion ordering on the 8a sites, and the low voltage stage was ascribed to a homogeneous phase reaction. Further lithiation of LiMn2O4 occurs around 3 V, which leads to the formation of rock salt phase Li2Mn2O4.121 During the lithium insertion–extraction reaction at 4 V, the unit cell contracts and expands by 7.6%. Nevertheless, the cubic symmetry of LixMn2O4 is not affected, and the Mn2O4 framework could stay safe and sound. However, during the lithium insertion–extraction reaction at 3 V, the lithium ions are forced to fill the 16c sites, leading to the transition of the spinel phase to the rock salt phase. Meanwhile, the average oxidation stage of the manganese ions is less than 3.5, which would induce the Jahn–Teller distortion from the cubic to the tetragonal phase. The electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 is deeply affected by its structural characteristics. The robust Mn2O4 framework with 3D lithium ion diffusion pathways endows LiMn2O4 with promising safety and high rate capability. On the other side, the existence of Mn3+ leads to the manganese dissolution via a disproportionation reaction (2Mn3+ → Mn2+ + Mn4+), which hinders the cycle stability.125–127
At the expense of compromising the theoretical capacity, strategies proposed to improve the cycling stability of LiMn2O4 include surface coating and cation doping.128–131 Recent approaches to enhance the cyclability and high-rate capability of LiMn2O4 cathode have been focused on constructing nanostructure.132–135 For example, porous LiMn2O4 nanograins, mesoporous Li–Mn–O spinels and LiMn2O4 hierarchical porous architectures showed better capacity retention than their bulk counterparts without porosity. 1D nanostructures are also particularly attractive because they not only have large specific surface area which allows for efficient active mass-electrolyte contact but also provides 1D electron transport pathways. Previous studies have proved that LiMn2O4 nanorods and nanotubes can exhibit remarkable high-rate capabilities.136 Herein, it could be envisioned that 1D nanoporous spinel would combine the advantages of both 1D nanostructures and porous morphology. However, it remains a challenge to simultaneously obtain porosity and 1D nanostructure for LiMn2O4, which adopts the cubic crystallographic structure and is unfavourable for anisotropic crystal growth along a 1D direction.
Our group prepared porous LiMn2O4 nanorods through solid state lithiation of the 1D nanoporous Mn2O3 template.13Fig. 6 displays the synthesis route, crystal structure, SEM image, and cycling performance of porous LiMn2O4 nanorods. The synthesis of porous Mn2O3 nanorods was achieved by thermal decomposition of the MnC2O4 rod precursor which resulted from precipitation of Mn(NO3)2 and H2C2O4 in a confined microemulsion system. The formation of 1D structure could be attributed to the microemulsion which confines the nucleation speed and directs anisotropic crystal growth. The nanorods consisted of aggregated nanoparticles with size of approximately 20 nm. The discharge capacity of porous LiMn2O4 nanorods exceeded 80 mA h g−1 at 30 C, and the capacity retention approached 90% up to 500 cycles at 2 C. The lithium diffusion coefficient (DLi) of the porous nanorods was 1.3 × 10−8 cm2 s−1. The result indicates that the spinel porous nanorods favour faster Li-ion intercalation kinetics. Besides, the interconnected pores favour electrolyte immersing and transportation, which could avoid partial overdischarge and thus improve the cycling life.

Other nanostructures are also attempted for LiMn2O4.137–142 Bruce's group137 synthesized porous nano-LiMn2O4 spinel by a one-pot resorcinol-formaldehyde route. The initial capacity reached 131 mA h g−1 and remained 118 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Cui's group133 prepared LiMn2O4 nanorods via a solid-state reaction using β-MnO2 nanorods. The nanorods delivered a capacity of 100 mA h g−1 at 1 C with capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles. Bak et al.142 fabricated LiMn2O4–rGO nanocomposites by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The composites exhibited high specific capacities of 137 mA h g−1 at 1 C, 117 mA h g−1 at 50 C, and 101 mA h g−1 at 100 C, respectively. Cho's group143 demonstrated that the carbon-coated LiMn2O4 clusters consisting of many single-crystal nanoparticles possessed ultrahigh-rate capability. The sample exhibited a gravimetric energy density of 300 W h kg−1 at a power density of 45 kW kg−1 and a volumetric energy density of 440 W h L−1 at a power density of 68 kW L−1.
Another issue of spinel LiMn2O4 is poor performance at high temperature (≥40 °C) because of the accelerating Mn dissolution. In order to solve the problem, some strategies such as surface coating and cation doping are proposed.144,145 Surface coating would avoid direct contact between the electrolyte and LiMn2O4, and cation doping can keep high content of Mn4+ to improve the structure stability induced. Cho's group144 prepared AlPO4-coated Li1.09Mn1.83Al0.08O4via a solid-state reaction combined with a solution-based coating method. The cathodes delivered an initial discharge capacity of 108 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of 78% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C under 60 °C without swelling problem.


3.3.2 Spinel-type LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. 
Nickel substituted spinel LiMn2O4 was initially synthesized and studied as one of the metal substituted LiMn2O4 derivatives to increase the mean oxidation state of the manganese ions with a stable structure.146,147 In spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), sufficient Ni2+ is available to fully oxidize the remaining manganese ions in the spinel structure. The unchanged Mn4+ ions during the electrochemical reactions improve the stability of the structure by eliminating Jahn–Teller distortion. In 1996, Gao et al. found that the lithium in the tetrahedral 8a sites of LNMO sites can be extracted.148 This process occurs at 4.7 V vs. Li+/Li and has been reported to involve the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni4+. Since then, LNMO has been extensively studied as one of the most promising high voltage cathode materials.149
The spinel structure of LNMO is a cubic close packing of oxygen atoms with Mn and Ni occupying half of the octahedral sites and Li residing in an eighth of the tetrahedral sites. LNMO spinels have two types of crystal structure, namely the ordered P4332 phase and the disordered Fd3m phase.150,151 In the P4332 phase, Ni and Mn are located in an ordered fashion in the octahedral 4b and 12d sites, respectively, with Li ions occupying the 8c sites and O ions occupying the 8c and the 24e sites. For the Fd3m phase, Ni and Mn randomly distribute in the 16d sites, with Li and O ions occupying the 8a and 32e sites, respectively. Previous studies have tried to compare the electrochemical performance of the two phases. However, conflicting results are found in the literature, which might be caused by the complicated performance influencing factors of LNMO.150,152–154 Besides crystal structure, particle shapes and sizes also play a critical role in determining the performance of the electrode materials. Therefore, the factors which influence the electrochemical performance should be synergistically taken into consideration for the development of the advanced spinel cathode. As shown in Fig. 7, we have systematically investigated the combined influence of phase (crystal structure) and particle morphologies (size, shape, and surface area) on LNMO's electrochemical performance. Four representative LNMO samples with different particle sizes and crystal structures were synthesized: micro-size P4332 (LNMO-MP), micro-size Fd3m (LNMO-MF), nano-size P4332 (LNMO-NP), and nano-size Fd3m (LNMO-NF).14 LNMO-MP and LNMO-MF had a uniform particle size of about 1 μm, while the particle size of LNMO-NP and LNMO-NF was around 50 nm. A small plateau in the 4.0 V region (assigned to the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couple) was observed in the profiles of LNMO-MF and LNMO-NF, but this was not observed in the profiles of both LNMO-MP and LNMO-NP. The 4.0 V region indicated the existence of Mn3+ in the two Fd3m phase samples. Rate capability tests showed that the disordered LNMO spinels exhibited higher rate capability than that of the ordered spinels. This trend was amplified at higher rates. However, the superiority decreased when the size of the LNMO particles is on the nanometer scale. For the ordered phase, the nanosized sample exhibited much better performance than its micro-size counterpart. The rate capability of the four samples could be ranked in the following order, LNMO-MP < LNMO-NP < LNMO-MF ≈ LNMO-NF. This result indicated that the disordered structures afford intrinsically better rate capability, and nanosizing is effective in achieving high rate capability. When cycling at 1 C for 100 cycles, the capacity retention of LNMO-MP, LNMO-MF, LNMO-NP, and LNMO-NF were 93.7%, 98.4%, 95.7%, and 92.4%, respectively. The LNMO-MF displayed the highest capacity retention at 1 C because of the synergistic effects of micro-size with smaller specific surface area to reduce the contact between the electrolyte and the disordered phase which ensured fast Li diffusion for Li+ extraction and insertion. However, at higher rates (≥5 C), LNMO-NP showed the highest capacity retention. Moreover, the LNMO-NP presented the smallest change of capacity retention. These results suggested that the spinel LNMO phase with disordered cation distributions favors high-rate capability, while the presence of an ordered phase benefits cyclability. Meanwhile, forming nanosized spinel particles greatly improved the high rate performance but worsened the cycling performance. The phase- and size-dependent behaviors could be understood in terms of ionic and electronic diffusion, structural variation, and side reactions associated with Mn3+. By synergistically considering phase and size effects, we achieved excellent electrode performance with LNMO-MF (microsized and disordered phase) and LNMO-NP (nanosized and ordered phase) spinels, delivering the discharge capacities of near 130 mA h g−1 at 5 C and sustaining the capacity retention of exceeding 90% after 300 cycles.

Our previous work has also been focused on constructing 1D nanostructure for spinel LiMn2O4 to improve its rate capability and cycle stability. The same strategy has been implied to LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 too. Two different 1D structures (nanorods and porous nanorods) were constructed and explored.66,155 LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 nanorods (LNMO-NR) were prepared by an impregnation method followed by a simple solid-state reaction with MnO2 nanorods as the morphology template. LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 porous nanorods (LNMO-PNR) were obtained by a morphology inheritance method with porous Mn2O3 nanowires/rods. Fig. 8 shows the SEM and TEM images of LNMO-NR and LNMO-PNR. The LNMO-NR showed typical nanorod shape with the diameter around 50 nm and the length of 2–3 μm. Numerous crystal grains with arbitrary stacked arrangement in the nanorods were observed in the TEM images. The X-ray diffraction pattern and Raman spectroscopy proved that LNMO-NR adopted P4332 phase structure. The LNMO-PNR exhibited a 1D wire or rod shape, with the diameter of 100–400 nm and the length of more than 10 μm. The TEM image showed that the LNMO-PNR was composed of interconnected nanosized subunits with porous structure. The LNMO-PNR also presented P4332 phase structure. Although we have proved that the P4332 phase did not benefit fast Li ion diffusion, this drawback of P4332 phase LNMO could be compensated by the short diffusion distance in the 1D structure. On the other side, P4332 phase structure could benefit the cycling stability of LNMO with 1D structure. LNMO-NR exhibited discharge capacities of 120 and 101 mA h g−1 at 20 and 80 C, respectively. After 80 cycles at 20 C, the capacity retention was 95%. For LNMO-PNR, remarkable capacity retention was achieved in the long-term cycling test (91% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C).

Though nanosized LNMO has high gravimetric capacity, its tap density is relatively low compared to commercialized LiCoO2 (2.6 g cc−1). It is thus that we synthesized hierarchical micro–nano structured LNMO with a high tap density of 1.7 g cc−1via a facile PEG-assisted co-precipitation method.156 Its discharge capacity at 40 C was more than 120 mA h g−1 and the capacity retention at 5 C reached 89% after 150 cycles. Lou's group157 prepared hollow LNMO spheres and cubes via a solid state reaction using porous MnO2 spheres and cubes as precursors, and the hollow structures delivered discharge capacities of 118 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 104 mA h g−1 at 20 C.
Besides nanostructures, cation doping is also an effective approach to improve the cycling and rate performance of spinel LNMO.158–160 Yang et al.158 used first-principles based on the density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic and structural characteristics of the LiM0.125Ni0.375Mn1.5O4 (M = Cr, Fe, and Co) cathode. The results showed that Co-doping would effectively enhance the electronic conductivity and reduce the lithium diffusion barrier. Manthiram's group160 prepared LiNi0.5−xMxMn1.5O4 (M = Cr, Fe, and Ga; 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08) by solid state reaction. These dopant cations aggregated in the surface to form a more stable interface, leading to improved cyclability at both room temperature and 55 °C.
Despite the multiple advantages, spinel LNMO shows the drawback of a much lower theoretical capacity than layered metal oxides. Composite cathode materials such as Li2MnO3/LNMO and LNMO/layered heterostructured materials are effective in enhancing electrode capacity as well as maintaining partial LNMO's advantages. On the basis of our previous studies, we have synthesized a series of intergrown xLiNi0.5Mn1.5O4·(1 − x)LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (xLNMO·(1 − x)NCM) composite nanorods by a similar simple self-support template method.161 The composite exhibited a 1D rod shape, with the diameter around 100 nm and the length of 1–2 μm (Fig. 9a and b). The spinel LNMO and layered NCM nanograins showed remarkable structural compatibility in the nanorods. The XRD patterns of xLNMO·(1 − x)NCM showed a gradual evolution from the layered rock salt phase to the cubic spinel phase, as x increases from 0 to 1. As shown in Fig. 9c, typical galvanostatic profiles of the composite displayed two plateaus: a high voltage plateau above 4.5 V and a low voltage plateau below 4.5 V. The high voltage plateau was attributed to spinel LNMO, and the low voltage plateau was attributed to layered NCM. When x = 0.5, that was 0.5LNMO·0.5NCM, the composite delivered a high discharge capacity of 200 mA h g−1 and a high energy density of 815 W h kg−1, which were induced by the effective combination of high capacity from NCM and high working voltage from LNMO. Normally, due to the structural instability and phase transformation into a spinel-like phase during a deep charge process, the theoretical capacity of layered materials could not be fully utilized. However, the 0.5LNMO·0.5NCM intergrown composite was able to deliver its theoretical capacity, which indicated the complete deintercalation of Li+ in both NCM and LNMO parts. This suggested an interaction between the NCM and LNMO in the composite. A two-phase synergy mechanism in the interfaces of layered-NCM and spinel-LNMO was proposed to explain the improved lithium deintercalation ability of the composite. The intergrown composite structure helped to support the unstable layered structure of NCM upon deep charging, leading to complete deintercalation of the residue Li+.

Table 5 summarizes the synthetic method, discharge capacity, cyclability, and rate capability of several nanostructured spinel-type Mn-base oxides. Though nanostructure improves the rate and cycling performance of spinel-type Mn-based oxides, the low theoretical specific capacity limits the further development of spinel-type Mn-based oxides.

3.4 Polyanion-type Mn-based oxides
Polyanion-type Mn-based oxides mainly include olivine-type LiMnPO4 and silicate-type Li2MnSiO4. Polyanion-type Mn-based oxides possess higher thermal stability than layered Mn-based oxides owing to the stronger covalent bonds of oxygen atoms, leading to better safety. Moreover, polyanion-type Mn-based oxides have higher theoretical specific capacities than those of spinel-type Mn-based oxides, resulting in their higher energy density. However, polyanion-type Mn-based oxides are plagued by poor electronic transport and ionic diffusion. Nanostructures are attempted to solve this problem.

3.4.1 Olivine-type LiMnPO4. 
The olivine-type LiMnPO4 is reported by Goodenough's group in 1997.162 LiMnPO4 possesses an olivine structure with Pnma symmetry, in which an oxygen lattice has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp), Li and Mn metal atoms occupy half of the octahedral sites, and P atoms occupy 1/8 of the tetrahedral sites (Fig. 10a).163 Li+ ions diffuse along the 1D [010] direction (i.e., a-axis), so the (010) plane and the [010] direction are very important for their electrochemical performance. LiMnPO4 has a high operating voltage of 4.1 V vs. Li+/Li with a theoretical specific capacity of 170 mA h g−1 based on the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple. However, it suffers from very low intrinsic electronic conductivity (less than 10−10 S cm−1) and the large structure distortions induced by the Jahn–Teller effect of Mn3+ ions, leading to low practical capacity and poor rate performance.164 Preparing nanostructured LiMnPO4 combined with carbon coating and cation doping is an effective route to solve these problems.165–169 Cho's group165 synthesized 3D macroporous LiMnPO4–C flakes which consisted of many nanoparticles with particle size of ∼6 nm embedded in a carbon matrix. The flakes delivered discharge capacities of 162 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and 110 mA h g−1 at 10 C. Dominko's group167 designed a two-step sol–gel route to prepare LiMnPO4–C nanocomposites. The composite showed a capacity of 165 mA h g−1 at 55 °C with a capacity decay of 0.1% per cycle over 240 cycles. Crystallographic orientation is also very important for LiMnPO4 because of its 1D Li+ ion diffusion path.76,164,170 Choi et al.76 fabricated porous LiMnPO4–C nanoplates via a solid-state reaction. The porous nanoplates with a thickness of ∼50 nm were assembled by nanorods growing along the [010] direction in the (100) plane. The specific capacity reached 168 mA h g−1 at 0.02 C. Furthermore, doping LiMnPO4 with Fe is a common way to enhance conductivity and stability.169,171–174 Aurbach's group171 prepared a LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4–C nanocomposite by a solid state reaction and the composite exhibited a capacity of ∼165 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C. Cui's and Dai's groups172 used a solvothermal method to manufacture LiMn0.75Fe0.25PO4 nanorods–rGO hybrid material. The composite delivered capacities of 155 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C and 132 mA h g−1 at 20 C, respectively. Scrosati's and Sun's groups169 designed double-structured LiMn0.85Fe0.15PO4 modified with LiFePO4. The LiMn0.85Fe0.15PO4–LiFePO4/C composite displayed a high volumetric energy density of 970 W h m−3.

3.4.2 Li2MnSiO4. 
Li2MnSiO4 is attractive mainly for the possible 2e− exchange reaction based on Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couples, giving a theoretical capacity of 333 mA h g−1.163 As shown in Fig. 10b, Li2MnSiO4 possesses four kinds of crystal structures including Pmn21, Pmnb, P21/n, and Pn symmetry.175 Like LiMnPO4, Li2MnSiO4 similarly is also plagued by low intrinsic electronic conductivity (less than 10−14 S cm−1) and the Jahn–Teller distortions of Mn3+ ions. Furthermore, Li2MnSiO4 undergoes the gradual reduction of crystallinity during the cycling derived from the Li–Mn position exchange. Common strategies to solve the problems include designing the nanostructures, doping with other cations, and coating with carbon.20,176–180 Carbon coating can obviously enhance the electronic conductivity and partially impact on the Li+ ion diffusion coefficient. Decreasing the particle sizes can shorten the diffusion path for Li+ ions. Cation-doping can modify the intrinsic properties of Li2MnSiO4 such as conductivity and structural stability. Yang's group176 prepared a Li2MnSiO4–C nanocomposite with a capacity of 209 mA h g−1 at 5 mA g−1, which achieves more than one electron reaction in silicate cathode materials for the first time. Kuezma et al.177 synthesized Li2MnSiO4–C nanoparticles with a particle size of 15–100 nm by a microwave assisted solvothermal method, and the nanoparticles showed a discharge capacity of 250 mA h g−1 at 50 °C and 0.1 C. Our group20 fabricated Li2MnSiO4@C nanocomposites with low carbon content of 5 wt% via a hydrothermal-assisted solution route and the composite exhibited an initial discharge capacities of 281.5 mA h g−1 at 25 °C and 321.4 mA h g−1 at 45 °C. Manthiram's group178 used a template method to prepare Li2MnSiO4–C nanocomposites with hierarchical macro/mesoporosity which delivered a reversible discharge capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C.

Table 6 summarizes the synthetic method, discharge capacity, cyclability, and rate capability of several nanostructured polyanion-type Mn-base oxides. It is pointed out that polyanion-type Mn-base oxides are hampered by sluggish kinetics, so carbon-coating with nanostructure is widely used. However, their cycling and rate performance is still difficult to meet the commercial requirements. Which kind of materials would really fulfill future applications such as electric vehicles, Li-rich layered Mn-base oxides, spinel Mn-base oxides or polyanion-type Mn-base oxides? There is no clear answer up to now, and further investigation is needed. Designing the combination to form composites or developing new cathode materials should be a recommendable option.

4. Mn-based oxides as oxygen electrocatalysts for metal–air batteries
Oxygen electrocatalysts play a crucial role in determining the power density, cycling capability, and energy conversion efficiency of metal–air batteries and fuel cells.4,181–185 Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs in the cathode of metal–air batteries and fuel cells, which plays a key role in the electrochemical performance. Table 7 summarizes the several reaction processes of ORR which mainly include the 4e or the 2e pathway. Extensive efforts have focused on searching efficient ORR catalysts for many years.186–191 At present, Pt and Pt alloys are known to be the best active catalysts for ORR, but they have lost their brilliance owing to the high price and unsatisfied stability. Therefore, it is extremely essential for us to develop alternative catalysts based on non-noble elements. Among them, Mn-based oxides are particularly attractive due to their high abundance, low cost, environment friendliness and considerable electrocatalytic activity.15,21,22,189,192–195 In addition, the variable state (e.g., +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7) and coordination structures (e.g., MnO6 octahedron and MnO4 tetrahedron) of Mn (Fig. 11) lead to rich redox electrochemistry and material chemistry, offering opportunities and challenges for searching and developing non-precious metal based catalysts.15,21,22,189

4.1 Binary Mn-based oxides
Mn-based oxides can simultaneously serve as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution, rendering their bifunctional role in oxygen electrochemistry. Since MnO2 was first reported for the ORR in early 1970s,196 many studies have been devoted to studying and optimizing MnOx-based catalysts for air electrodes.22,189,192–195 Possible motivation is the μ-oxido–CaMn4Ox cluster catalytic active centre to oxidize water in photosystem II in nature.197–199 Electrochemically active Mn-based oxides such as Mn5O8, Mn3O4, Mn2O3, MnO2, and MnOOH all exhibit considerable ORR activities in alkaline media.46,193,194,200,201 The composition, crystalline structure, morphology, oxidation state, and surface area can affect the electrocatalytic properties. For example, the catalytic activities depend strongly on the crystallographic structure, decreasing in the order of α- > β- > γ-MnO2 for 1D MnO2 nanostructure.46 The change is ascribed to the combination effect of their intrinsic tunnel (built up with MnO6 octahedron) size and electronic conductivity. Ohsaka's group202 reported that the catalytic activities are decreased in the order of MnOOH > Mn2O3 > Mn3O4 > Mn5O8 owing to the influence of the valence and coordination environment of Mn. Meanwhile, among the same phase, α-MnO2 nanospheres and nanowires apparently outperform the benchmark micro-sized particles because of smaller size and higher specific surface area. Moreover, the nature of preferentially exposed facets could also influence the catalytic activity of binary Mn-based oxides, which requires further identification.201
Additionally, it seems to be an efficient strategy to enhance the ORR activity by doping another component. MnOx combined with a variety of elements (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ni, Mg, Ca) exhibits superior activity than both pristine metals and non-doped materials.46,193,203,204 The results from Roche et al.194 demonstrated that the doped Ni–MnOx/C and Mg–MnOx/C nanoparticles promoted the ORR toward the direct 4e pathway: firstly the quasiequilibrium proton insertion process to form intermediate MnOOH, secondly O2 adsorption onto surface sites upon MnOOH, thirdly the rate-determining electron transfer step consisting of electrosplitting of adsorbed O2 species into the Oads state, and finally the electrochemical reduction of Oads to hydroxide anions. The MnIII/MnIV redox couple acts as the oxygen acceptor and the donor mediator, thus favoring the electron transfer. Other examples such as manganese oxide nanoparticles electrodeposited on Pt substrates193 or Pd nanoparticles supported on MnO2204 nanorods all exhibit superior catalytic activity to pristine noble metals and single manganese oxides. Consequently, the ORR performance is improved by the doped MnOx electrocatalysts.
Other strategies have also been designed to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of binary Mn-based oxides including optimizing morphologies, coating with metals or integrating conductive nanostructures.46,193,194,203,204 Although these methods have been proved to be effective, they are relatively complex and expensive. Recently, a facile and economic route has been developed to improve the electrocatalytic activity of rutile-type β-MnO2 nanorods by introducing native oxygen defects without modification by foreign additives (Fig. 12a).192 As shown in Fig. 12b, heat treatment in argon and air leads to different concentration of oxygen nonstoichiometry, accompanied by the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+, while still maintains pristine 1D nanostructure morphology. More interestingly, two domains can be observed in oxygen-vacancy samples after heat treatment (Fig. 12d), which is indicative of a typical pyrolusite lattice and a new structure. The different fast Fourier transformation profile and new lattice fringes can be attributed to reconstruction and phase transformation, which correspond to oxygen-defect-induced structural variation of MnO2. Electrochemical results demonstrate that modest concentration of oxygen-defective oxide exhibits more positive potential, larger reduction current and lower peroxide yield of the ORR electrocatalysis and the enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. DFT computational investigations reveal that the improved performance is contributed to modified MnO2 surface-oxygen interaction and a reduced kinetic barrier with the presence of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 12e).

Recently, much effort has been made focusing on developing metal–air primary batteries such as Mg–air, Al–air, and Zn–air batteries.50,205,206 Cheap Mn-based oxides have shown high ORR catalytic performance, while the reports on Mn-based oxides as the cathode catalysts of metal–air primary batteries are relatively few. Ni modified MnOx–C delivered a power density of 122 mW cm−2 in the Zn–air primary batteries, which is comparable to the Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts.207 Besides catalysts, there are still many problems which hinder the wide application of zinc–air batteries. First, the electrolyte is very easy to leakage. Second, the solution is evaporated to dry the electrolyte. Third, the electrolyte is moisture absorbent to decrease the pH value. Last, CO2 in the air can react with the alkaline electrolyte. If the above problems are solved, Mn-based oxides would be more useful.
In addition to aqueous systems, binary manganese oxides have also been applied as oxygen electrocatalysts in nonqueous systems.195,208–210 For instance, Li–O2 batteries based on α-MnO2 nanowires showed a capacity of 3000 mA h g−1 (based on carbon) and excellent capacity retention after 10 cycles.195 Furthermore, MnO2 nanowires exhibit much higher capacity than bulk MnO2 among both α- and β-MnO2 phases, suggesting that the morphology and structure of MnOx play an important role in determining the catalytic activity in the organic electrolyte, which is similar to that in the aqueous electrolyte. Other investigation demonstrates that the single-crystalline α-MnO2 nanotubes display much better lithium–air battery performance than α-MnO2 nanowires and δ-MnO2 nanosheets because the former possesses higher surface area to the surrounding electrolyte and faster electron and Li+ ion transport.211 Recently, a virus biotemplated method has been developed to synthesize δ-MnO2 nanowires for Li–O2 battery application, and the nanowires show improved performance than their nanoparticle counterparts.212 Our group41 synthesized a sponge-like 3D nanostructured ε-MnO2@Ni foam nanocomposite by electrodeposition. The composite showed a high discharge capacity of 6300 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 with a superior cyclability of 120 cycles at 2.2–4.3 V. As to the cathode catalysts in Li–air batteries, many factors including the oxidation state of manganese, crystallite size, surface area and pore volume are all found to have great effects on the catalytic performance.211,213
4.2 Mn-based composite oxides
Mn-based composite oxides adopting spinel or perovskite structure have been largely studied as ORR and OER catalysts and their application in rechargeable metal–air batteries is discussed in this section.15,21,22,189 Extra advantages of composite oxides commonly include improved structural durability and the combination effect of several types of electrochemical active sites. These active sites are favorable to promote the ORR and OER, making them possible as bifunctional catalysts for the air cathode in rechargeable metal–air batteries.4,184

4.2.1 Spinel-type Mn-based oxides. 
Spinels are a class of oxides with the formula AB2O4, where generally A represents a divalent metal ion (e.g., Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni or Zn) and B stands for a trivalent metal ion (e.g., Al, Fe, Co, Cr or Mn). Among various spinels, MMn2O4 is particularly attractive owing to the natural advantages of the manganese element such as high nature abundance, low price, and environmental friendliness. Since Mn-based spinels possess electronic conductivity or semiconductivity and the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couple, their physicochemical performance is closely related to the composition, crystalline structure, surface area, and the oxidation state of metal ions, which are greatly determined under synthetic conditions.214 Traditionally, these spinel compounds have been prepared by a high-temperature solid–solid reaction using the mixing of stoichiometric amounts of appropriate metal oxides, and the heat treatment temperature is often over 1000 °C for several hours, or even periods of a few days.215 The materials synthesized by this method are difficult to control the particle size and shape, thus displaying limited electrochemical activity. Recently, a facile and rapid room-temperature methodology has been developed for achieving highly active spinel nanoparticles.21 The formation is accomplished by reduction-recrystallization of amorphous MnO2 precursors in aqueous solution containing divalent metal ions such as Co2+. Two different crystal structures (tetragonal and cubic CoxMn3−xO4 spinels) were obtained using NaH2PO2 (CoMnO-P) and NaBH4 (CoMnO-B) as the reducing agents, respectively. The as-prepared Co–Mn–O nanocrystalline spinels inherited the morphology of the amorphous nanoparticulate MnO2 precursor and performed remarkably higher activity towards dual ORR/OER due to high surface area, large concentration of lattice defects, and abundant vacancies compared to the counterparts synthesized at high temperature. Interestingly, the cubic Co–Mn–O spinel outperformed the tetragonal phase in catalyzing the ORR (Fig. 13a), while the tetragonal spinel surpassed the cubic phase for the OER (Fig. 13b). This phase-dependent electrocatalytic character was contributed to the different binding energies of oxygen adsorption on the surface of the two phases, which were revealed by both experimental and computational analysis (Fig. 13c and d). Furthermore, the active Co–Mn–O spinel was applied as an air electrode to fabricate coin-type Zn–air cells, which exhibited a stable galvanostatic discharge profile and remarkable specific energy densities. Following the similar synthetic procedure, nanospheres and nanocubes of ZnMn2O4 spinels have also been successfully prepared and shown considerable electrocatalytic performance.216 These illustrated examples provide the feasibility of reasonable design and controllable synthesis of nanostructured composite spinel oxides as bifunctional electrocatalysts for air electrodes which can serve rechargeable metal–air batteries and fuel cells.

Besides standard spinel structure, post-spinel 1D CaMn2O4 nanorods prepared by a solvothermal route at mild temperature have been reported.217 The reaction parameters including solvent, heating temperature, and dwell time are all found to affect the phase formation of CaMn2O4. The as-prepared CaMn2O4 nanorods were detailedly investigated as electrocatalysts for ORR in alkaline electrolytes and exhibited remarkable catalytic performance with similar mass activities to Pt/C despite its slightly lower activity. In addition to the considerable catalytic activity, the CaMn2O4/C electrocatalyst also afforded better catalytic stability due to the chemical and structural robustness of marokite in an alkaline environment. CaMn2O4 nanorods with low cost and high abundance can serve as attractive non-precious ORR catalysts which are widely applied in metal–air batteries and alkaline fuel cells.
Spinel manganese oxides have also been widely used as cathode catalysts for metal–air (mainly Li–air) batteries. For example, multiporous MnCo2O4 spinel microspheres have been successfully employed as air cathodes for Li–O2 batteries. The assembled cells display low overpotential, high capacity and good cycle performance due to the porous nanostructure of MnCo2O4 microspheres, which offers high active sites and enough transmission paths for O2 and Li+ ions.218 Dai's group189,219 developed a spinel manganese–cobalt oxide/N-doped graphene composite and employed it in highly efficient ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalysis in alkaline solution. When transformed the catalyst into the aprotic electrolyte for Li–O2 batteries, the hybrid based electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 0.8 V and an enhanced cyclability of 40 cycles at 400 mA g−1 with a cutoff capacity of 1000 mA h g−1, which are attributed to the high active spinel nanoparticles and the electrochemical covalent coupling between the oxide and the conducting graphene substrate.219


4.2.2 Perovskite-type Mn-based oxides. 
Perovskite-type oxides with the general formula ABO3 have a wide range of physical–chemical properties, whereas A is the rare-earth or alkaline-earth metal and B is a transition metal. The perovskite structures allow partial A and B cation substitution to form A1−xAx′B1−yBy′O3, making researchers tailor their catalytic performance. In general, A-site substitution mainly influences the ability of oxygen adsorption, however, B-site substitution affects the activity of the adsorbed oxygen.184 Various perovskite oxides with different replacements have been studied for oxygen electrocatalysis. Since Bruce firstly applied La1−xSrxMnO3 in aprotic Li–O2 batteries, the perovskite-type catalysts have been widely used as cathode catalysts, showing remarkable electrocatalytic performance.220–223 Recently, porous La0.75Sr0.25MnO3 nanotubes were prepared using the electrospinning technique followed by a heating procedure.222 With the novel material as an electrocatalyst, Li–O2 batteries exhibited much lower charge voltage than that of KB and could maintain 124 cycles by controlling the discharging depth of 1000 mA h g−1.The intrinsically high catalytic activities promoted dual ORR/OER, and porous tubular nanostructure provided more void and active sites for the formation and decomposition of the discharge products, thus benefiting the reversibility of the air electrode.
Aiming at searching new ORR catalysts, a series of micro–nano structured calcium–manganese oxides (Ca–Mn–O) composed of inexpensive and high abundant elements were developed as electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis (Fig. 14).15 These porous Ca–Mn–O compounds were synthesized through thermal decomposition of Ca1−xMnxCO3 solid solution precursors. The catalytic performance of Ca–Mn–O microspheres greatly depended on the surface oxidation state of Mn and the crystallographic structures, which influenced the extent of O2 activation. Among the series of Ca–Mn–Os (perovskite-type CaMnO3, layered structured Ca2Mn3O8, post-spinel CaMn2O4 and CaMn3O6), the perovskite CaMnO3 with open MnO6 tunnels and mixed manganese valence exhibited the highest activities in the alkaline electrolyte, including larger current density and a higher electron transfer number (Fig. 14i and j) with superior catalytic stability compared to the benchmark Pt/C. Following the above results, we synthesized interconnected porous CaMnO3 nanostructures and investigated their catalytic performance as cathode catalysts for rechargeable Li–O2 batteries.224 The CaMnO3-based cathode enables much enhanced cyclability (>80 cycles) with a stable discharge terrace than the pure carbon based cathode (<25 cycles) and much lower discharge–charge voltage gap of 0.98 V (ca. 620 mV smaller than that of the carbon only electrode). The improved performance is attributed to the intrinsic high electrocatalytic activity of CaMnO3 and the designed porous nanostructure. Supporting a small amount of Pt nanoparticles on the porous CaMnO3 matrix to construct the Pt–CaMnO3 nanocomposite can greatly promote the total electrocatalytic performance.23 The hydrogenated Pt–CaMnO3 nanocomposites composed of Pt clusters with particle size of 1 nm and porous cobweb-like CaMnO3 exhibited an 11-fold higher specific activity than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance could be attributed to the homogenous dispersion and ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles, the introduced oxygen defects and a multiple valence of Mn (+3 and +4) and the synergistic effect of Pt and CaMnO3, which alters the electronic structure of Pt and facilitates the adsorption–desorption behaviour of oxygen species. Furthermore, the hybrid catalyst shows superior catalytic durability due to the intrinsic chemical stability of the CaMnO3 support and the confinement effect in the interconnected nanoporous CaMnO3 substrate.

Predicting a catalyst design principle which correlates the material properties with the catalytic performance can promote the search for highly active and low-cost transition-metal oxide catalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that the ORR activity of perovskite family catalysts is primarily related to σ*-orbital (eg) occupation (eg-filling with a value around 1 for maximum activity) and secondarily to the extent of the B-site transition metal–oxygen covalent bond (Fig. 15).22 A single eg electron can provide a moderate strength when breaking the B–OH− bond and forming B–O22−, thereby stabilizing the displacement in a rate-limiting process. Based on the mechanistic analysis, the nature of ORR activity of the perovskite family displays a volcano shape as a function of B ions eg-filling. Notably, by applying this principle, LaMnO3+δ and LaNiO3 oxides show remarkable intrinsic ORR activity compared to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media.22 This principle would provide important guidelines for developing highly active non-precious-metal composite oxide catalysts in electrochemical conversion and storage devices.

Recently, perovskite-type compounds as light-harvesting materials have also attracted intensive attention in the field of solar cells because of their high conversion efficiencies.225–227 However, perovskite-type materials commonly used are Pb-based organic–inorganic hybrid compounds such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). Although there has been no report on Mn-based perovskite-type materials benefiting from the non-toxic and high nature abundance, these series of alternatives are quite worthy of research.
The inherent low conductivity of most transition-metal oxides leads to their insulating or semiconducting character, which could not provide a high electronic conductivity as that in metal and carbon-based catalysts. To overcome this limitation, oxide materials are generally mechanically mixed with carbon powders to construct air electrodes. However, this method may not only limit the surface contact but also reduce the loading amount of the active samples. To combine an oxide catalyst with a highly conducting substrate (e.g., carbon nanostructures) to form a composite is an alternative and useful strategy.189,209,210,219,228 An inorganic–nanocarbon hybrid could simultaneously enhance the electronic conductivity and improve the exposed distribution of active sites. The synergistic coupling effect in the hybrid enables better electrocatalytic performance than that of a single component. Cho's group229 has synthesized a composite air electrode consisting of KB carbon supported amorphous MnOx nanowires. The high conductivity and large surface area of the MnOx–KB composite along with the numerous defects contribute to the significantly improved ORR activity. The composite cathode based Zn–air batteries exhibit a peak power density of ∼190 mW cm−2, which is far higher than that of the commercial air Mn3O4 cathode and is similar to that of the Pt-based catalyst. Other forms of carbon including graphene, carbon nanotubes/nanofibers, and porous carbon have also been selected as conductive matrices to support MnOx nanostructures.210,230–232 The hybrid cathode catalyst endows Li–O2 batteries with low overvoltage and high capacity, suggesting their promising catalytic activity towards reversible discharge–charge reactions. Table 8 summarizes the synthetic method, capacitance, cyclability, and rate capability of several nanostructured Mn-base oxides as cathode catalysts for Li–O2 batteries. The results encourage us to further promote the Li–O2 batteries through designing new nanostructured Mn-base oxide catalysts.

5. Mn-based oxides as electrode materials for pseudocapacitors
Pseudocapacitors store the energy through either a fast or reversible redox reaction (Faradaic reaction) on the electrode surface. The electrode materials of pseudocapacitors are usually transition metal oxides or polymer materials. The transition metal oxides display higher energy density than conventional carbon materials and better cycling performance than polymer materials.24 Among various transition metal oxides, Mn-based oxides have attracted significant interest owing to their high specific capacitance, low price, natural abundance, and environmental friendliness. In 1991, Lee and Goodenough proposed the working principle of Mn-based oxides for pseudocapacitors.234 Afterwards, the charge storage mechanism in the Mn-based oxide electrode is continuously improved. The Faradaic reactions of Mn-based oxides can be expressed as follows:24 MnOα(OC)β + δC+ + δe− ↔ MnOα−β(OC)β+δ(12)where C+ represents the protons or alkali metal cations such as Li+, Na+, and K+.
According to previous research studies, crystallinity, crystal structure, morphology, and specific surface area are key factors to decide the performance of Mn-based oxides. High crystallinity is favourable toward enhancing the conductivity, but reduces the specific surface area. So choosing a suitable temperature of heat treatment is very important for the electrochemical performance of Mn-based oxides. Tsai's group235 prepared amorphous MnOx nanofibers with mixture valences of Mn3+ and Mn4+ and investigated the effects of heat treatment on the performance. The sample annealed at 200 °C showed an increased average oxidation state of Mn and the best cyclic stability. After annealing at 300 °C, the capacitive performance obviously decreased owing to morphology change. When MnOx was annealed above 500 °C, the pseudocapacitive behavior disappeared because of formation of crystalline Mn2O3.
The MnOx nanomaterials with different crystal structures also display varied performance. The amorphous α-MnO2·nH2O could exhibit a high specific capacitance of about 265–320 F g−1.236 While, nanostructured α-MnO2 showed a specific capacitance of 168 F g−1.237 Our group47 used the electrodeposition technique to prepare γ-MnO2 nanoflake films with a high specific capacitance of 240 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, but the most reports on γ-MnO2 materials only showed a very low specific capacitance of 20–30 F g−1.238 Donne et al.239 reported that birnessite-type δ-MnO2 prepared by a hydrothermal method showed a specific capacitance of 150 F g−1 which is much higher than that of β-MnO2 (25 F g−1).
The nanostructures of MnOx also have great effects on the rate and cycling performance because the large specific surface area facilitates the improvement of specific capacitance. 0D MnO2 nanoparticles prepared by electrodeposition showed a specific capacitance of 355 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1.240 1D MnO2 nanotubes and nanowires exhibited good rate capability because the 1D nanostructures reduce the lengths of both electronic transport and ionic diffusion, leading to fast kinetics.241 The specific capacitances of MnO2 nanotube arrays are 349, 325, 285, and 245 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, and 10 A g−1, respectively. 2D H-type layered MnO2 delivered a specific capacitance of 206 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1,242 while 3D α-MnO2 nanoflower with a BET surface area of 206 m2 g−1 only displayed a low specific capacitance of 95 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1.243
Poor electronic conductivity, low structural stability, and electrochemical dissolution of active materials are main problems for Mn-based oxides. One promising strategy to solve these problems is the incorporation of nanostructured MnOx into a conductive carbon matrix. Shao-Horn's group12 prepared multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT)–MnO2 nanocomposites by redox deposition of MnO2 on layer-by-layer assembled MWNT films and the composite showed a high volumetric capacitance of 246 F cm−3 at 10 mV s−1 and ∼11.6% decay after 1000 cycles at 200 mV s−1 (Fig. 16). Yan et al.244 reported graphene–MnO2 composites with the specific capacitances of 310 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 and 228 F g−1 at 500 mV s−1. Shi and co-workers245 synthesized MnO2–CMK-3 composites in which MnO2 were embedded on the mesoporous carbon wall of CMK-3 materials rather than in their pores. The specific capacitance was over 200 F g−1 for the MnO2–CMK-3 composite and 600 F g−1 for the MnO2, and high cycling stability was obtained. Jiang et al.246 designed a novel one-dimensional structure combined with highly graphitic carbon, manganese oxide nanoparticles, mesoporous carbon, and manganese oxide nanowires. The unique structure significantly improved the conductivity of metal oxide materials and exhibited high specific capacitances of 266 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 150 F g−1 at 60 A g−1. The specific capacitance almost had no decay after 1200 cycles at 50 mV s−1. The energy density of 20.8 W h kg−1 was achieved at a power density of 30 kW kg−1. Other conductive materials such as conductive polymers and metals can also improve the electrochemical utilization and promote the electrochemical stability. Ramaprabhu's group247 reported an in situ polymerization method to synthesize the nanocomposite based on polyaniline (PANI) and MnO2 nanotubes. The PANI–MnO2 composite showed a specific capacitance of 626 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, corresponding to the energy density of 17.8 W h kg−1. Xia's group248 fabricated hierarchical Ti@MnO2 nanowire arrays with specific capacitances of 468 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 311 F g−1 at 20 A g−1.

Table 9 lists the synthetic method, capacitance, cyclability, and rate capability of several nanostructured Mn-base oxides. MnO2–conductive material nanocomposites exhibit higher performance than bare MnO2, but it is still lower than the theoretical specific capacitance of MnO2 (1370 F g−1) and practical specific capacitance of RuO2 (600–1200 F g−1).24 Therefore, nanostructured Mn-base oxides have great potential for further development.

In the past 100 years, the science and technology of electrochemical energy storage and conversion have continuously developed. Batteries and capacitors have been widely used in people's daily life. For the batteries with a closed system (e.g., Zn–MnO2 batteries and rechargeable LIBs), the electrochemical reaction is an ionic insertion–deintercalation reaction which takes place on the interface between the solid active materials and the liquid electrolyte, while for the batteries with an open system (e.g., metal–air batteries like Li–O2 batteries and fuel cells), the redox reaction usually takes place on the interface among the solid catalysts, liquid electrolyte, and gas cathode material (i.e., O2) with a normally three-phase reaction. Recently, pseudocapacitors have been particularly attractive because of their battery-level energy density and EDLC-degree power density.26Fig. 17 describes the applications of Mn-based oxides for electrochemical energy storage and conversion over the years, including 1D nanostructured γ-MnO2 as the cathode of primary Zn–MnO2 batteries, porous spinel-type LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 nanorods as the cathodes of LIBs, perovskite-type CaMnO3 as ORR or OER catalysts of rechargeable Li–air batteries, and MnO2 as the electrode materials of pseudocapacitors. Notably, metal–air batteries and pseudocapacitors would be most likely to be developed in the future.

6. Conclusions and outlook
A series of Mn-based oxides with different nanostructures have been applied as the electrode materials of primary batteries, LIBs, pseudocapacitors, and electrocatalysts of rechargeable Li–O2 batteries. This is due to their native advantages of inexpensive price, high abundance, acceptable activity, and low toxicity in comparison with traditional bulk electrode materials and noble metal based catalysts. The influence of structure, morphology, and composition on the electrochemical performance has been widely studied. Generally, nanostructures can promote the electrochemical reaction occurring at the solid–liquid or the solid–liquid–gas interface to obtain high energy density. Furthermore, nanomaterials facilitate both electronic and ionic transport, leading to excellent rate performance. Thus, it is that nanostructured materials improve the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of electrochemical reactions for achieving high energy and power density.
For primary batteries, the low specific capacity of Zn–MnO2 and Li–MnO2 batteries is difficult to achieve long-life use. Mg–air, Al–air, and Zn–air batteries have large specific capacity, but the alkaline electrolyte suffers the difficulties of the leakage, evaporation, hygroscopicity, and reaction with CO2 limiting the scalable application. Using quasi-solid-state or solid-state electrolytes combined with nanostructured Mn-based oxides as catalysts may become the future research direction.
For LIBs, layered, spinel-type, and polyanion-type Mn-based oxides have different features. Layered Li-rich Mn-based oxides exhibit a high specific capacity of ∼300 mA h g−1, but low initial Coulombic efficiency, sluggish Li+ ion diffusion, and poor cycling stability obstacle their application. Although the surface coating and core–shell structure relieve these problems in some degree, their internal phase transformation cannot be absolutely avoided. Doping other cations combined with concentration-gradient structure is helpful to improve the structure stability and reaction kinetics. Spinel-type LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 possesses a fast 3D Li+ diffusion path and high operational potential (∼4.7 V vs. Li+/Li), but the stability of the electrolyte and active materials at high potential is difficult to guarantee. Using 1D porous structure with surface coating would shed light on developing high potential cathode materials for advanced LIBs. Polyanion-type Li2MnSiO4 can achieve 2e− reaction with a high specific capacity of ∼333 mA h g−1, but suffers from low conductivity and poor stability. Core–shell structured Li2MnSiO4@C nanocomposites show great improvements in the rate and cycling performance. However, no obvious effort for optimizing the operation voltage of Li2MnSiO4 is made. To obtain high energy and power density, further attempts should focus on the modification of ion doping such as Co2+ and Ni2+ at the Mn site or PO43−, TiO44−, and AlO33− at the anion site.
For rechargeable metal–air batteries, extensive fundamental studies about the catalytic mechanism and the correlation between the electrochemical performance and physicochemical properties are urgent. A combination of theoretical calculation and in situ experimental analysis would be helpful to gain the in-depth insights. Apart from these, functional materials critically determine the characteristics of assembled electrochemical devices. As for metal–air systems, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution requires the highly efficient bifunctional active catalysts. Mn-based oxides along with various favorable nanostructures are particularly attractive and have been intensely investigated as non-precious catalysts in both aqueous and nonaqueous systems accompanied by different mechanisms. Compared to discharge processes (i.e., ORR), the catalytic behavior for charge is more challenging in rechargeable metal–air batteries, especially in Li–air systems owing to the electrochemical decomposition of the discharge products (i.e., Li2O2). This leads to large anodic polarization and limited cycling ability. Efficient electrocatalysts are urgently required to promote the reversible formation–decomposition of Li2O2 and to lower the overpotential for avoiding carbon corrosion and electrolyte oxidation. By tailoring the physiochemical parameters of the catalysts (e.g., composition, valence value, phase, structure, defect, morphology, size, surface area, and conductivity), improved intrinsic catalytic activity and enhanced density and utilization of the active sites could be obtained through optimizing synthesis strategies and conditions. In addition, rational structure including hierarchical porosity facilitating ion and O2 diffusion and transport and the uniform catalyst distribution also contributes to the improvement of electrode/battery performance. Furthermore, Nature may aid in exploiting and developing new electrocatalysts. Mimicking natural oxygen catalytic processes would help to search for better catalysts.
Pseudocapacitors are particularly attractive because of their battery-level energy density and EDLC-degree power density. MnO2 has a theoretical specific capacitance of 1370 F g−1, but its practical specific capacitance is lower than 400 F g−1. Furthermore, MnO2 suffers from poor electronic conductivity, low structural stability, and electrochemical dissolution. MnO2–conductive material nanocomposites obviously improve the performance, but the full potential of MnO2-based pseudocapacitors has not been explored. Using porous MnO2–conductive material composites with large surface area combined with optimum electrolytes and separators would make pseudocapacitors more attractive.
It is noted that future studies of Mn-based oxides with nanostructures should focus on achieving the large scale preparation, increasing the tap density and volumetric energy density, and maintaining the high electrochemical performance. To sum up the present research efforts and progress, great opportunities and huge challenges coexist in this field.
