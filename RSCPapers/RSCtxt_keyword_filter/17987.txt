    , Accepted 21st May 2012First published on 22nd May 2012AbstractSolvent vapour annealing (SVA), which consists of exposing the active layer of organic films to a vapour of solvent directly after deposition, has been used in small molecule bulk heterojunction (SM-BHJ) solar cell devices whose active layer consisted of 3,6-bis(5-(benzofuran-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP(TBFu)2) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). We demonstrate that upon SVA, well-ordered crystalline domains of the DPP(TBFu)2 donor form inside the active layer, improving greatly the Fill Factor (FF) of the devices. However, SVA treatment is always accompanied by a decrease in device short circuit current (JSC). We demonstrate, using 1D and 2D XRD and AFM, that crystalline domains of DPP(TBFu)2 form in a matrix of PC71BM acceptor. The crystallinity increases with annealing time (ta) and the change in FF and JSC is directly linked to this. The X-ray single crystal structure of the DPP(TBFu)2 donor was solved and provided information of the donor's packing in the solid state. The donor molecules were shown to pack in a herringbone arrangement and shown to form a highly texturized active layer film. We demonstrated that the ability of the donor to form large and highly texturized crystalline domains in the active layer is as equally as determining for the devices' characteristics as the individual stacking properties of the donor in the solid state.
Introduction
The field of solution processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells has been widely dominated by π-conjugated polymer donors over the last decade, with record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) greater than 7% already reported.1,2 Small-molecule BHJ (SM-BHJ) devices have, however, attracted much less attention. It was generally accepted that the inability of small molecules to form ordered domains in a blend would be a major limitation to charge transport leading to poor photocurrent generation and more importantly significantly lower fill factors than polymer-based devices.3,4 This assumption has however recently shown to be a matter of debate with several works published on small molecule-based BHJ devices with PCEs higher than 4% and with fill factors (FFs) over 50%.5–7
In many cases the authors show that post-fabrication treatment – particularly solvent vapour annealing (SVA), sometimes termed ‘slow growth’7–10 – has a major influence on molecular ordering at the nanoscale and is a key factor in achieving high PCE as well as high FF. Forrest and co-workers demonstrated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) that SVA has a superior ability than thermal annealing to form crystalline domains in SM-BHJ films, leading to enhanced device performances.7
A recent study on polymer blends using fluorescence imaging demonstrated that when spin coating at high velocity using low boiling point solvents the molecular structure of the components of the blend is kinetically trapped in a highly energetic disordered conformation. By exposing the organic layer to a saturated vapour of solvent, molecules dissolve locally gaining thermodynamic freedom and equilibrate towards a lower energy state conformation.11 Such conformation is reached through intra- or intermolecular weak interactions (essentially π–π stacking) leading to the formation of well-ordered crystalline domains,12,13 whose size may be as small as a few nanometers and as large as a few hundred micrometers.
Herein we demonstrate that the formation of such crystalline domains using a post-deposition SVA treatment has a dramatic impact on the characteristics of DPP(TBFu)2-based SM-BHJ cells. Fill factors as high as 64% were obtained at 100 mW cm−2 and higher than 67% at 10 mW cm−2 on solution-processed BHJ devices using a similar device structure as reported previously by Nguyen and co-workers (Fig. 1).5

While most studies have stressed the importance of intramolecular π–π stacking in the donor domains to obtain high efficiency in SM-BHJ devices, this assumption could be questioned. Indeed, some of the highest yielding small molecules used in SM-BHJ have been shown to display no π–π stacking at all in the solid state.14 In addition, a recent study where a very similar analogue of DPP(TBFu)2 displayed in the solid state a lot more π–π stacking interactions than DPP(TBFu)2 does not outperform devices based on DPP(TBFu)2.15 Herein we demonstrate, using X-ray diffraction, that the ability of the donor to form large and highly texturized crystalline domains in the active layer is as equally as determining for the devices' characteristics as the individual stacking properties of the donor in the solid state.
Experimental section
DPP(TBFu)2 was synthesised using reported protocols from Nguyen and co-workers,5 first purified by column chromatography and further purified through recrystallization by slow diffusion of MeOH in a concentrated solution of DPP(TBFu)2 in CHCl3. High purity shiny greenish crystalline needles of DPP(TBFu)2 were obtained. PC71BM was purchased from Solenne (Solenne BV, The Netherlands). High purity (HPLC gradient grade, 99.8%) CHCl3 was used for the active layer deposition. The solvent was dried with activated molecular sieves and kept in a sealed bottle with silver foil prior to use. Aluminium (99.999%) and LiF (99.995%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Prepatterned Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) 5 Ohm per square (PSiOTec, Ltd., UK) soda lime glass substrates were first rinsed with acetone to remove the residual photoresist layer. The substrates were placed in a Teflon holder and sequentially sonicated in acetone (1 × 10 min) and isopropanol (2 × 10 min), and finally dried under flow of nitrogen. The ITO substrates were ozone-treated in a UV-ozone cleaner for 30 min in ambient atmosphere, and subsequently coated in air with a layer of filtered (0.45 μm, cellulose acetate) solution of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, HC Starck Baytron P) (4500 rpm for 30 seconds followed by 3500 rpm for 30 seconds). The PEDOT:PSS film was dried at 120 °C under inert atmosphere for 15 min. Active layers were spin-coated (8000 rpm) in air over the PEDOT:PSS layer from a 20 mg ml−1 (total concentration) solution of DPP(TBFu)2 and PC71BM (6:4 w/w ratio). The approximate thickness of the active layer was 80 nm.
The solvent annealing step was carried out straight after deposition of the active layer by exposing the films to a saturated vapour of solvent in an airtight vessel. The vessel (200 ml) was filled with 5 ml of CH2Cl2 and left sealed for 10 min prior to the SVA step to ensure the atmosphere was saturated with the solvent. The substrates were exposed to the solvent vapours from 5 seconds to several minutes by placing them in the solvent vessel.
The cathode layer was deposited by thermal evaporation in an ultra high vacuum chamber (1 × 10−6 mbar). Metals were evaporated through a shadow mask leading to devices with an area of 9 mm2. LiF (0.6 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1 and 0.5–1 Å s−1 respectively.
Following fabrication, the films were maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere and stored in the dark until used.
The UV-vis absorption of films was measured using a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured in a sealed capsule under inert atmosphere using a Sun 2000 Solar Simulator (150 W, ABET Technologies). The illumination intensity was measured to be 100 mW m2 with a calibrated silicon photodiode (NREL). The appropriate filters were utilised to faithfully simulate the AM 1.5G spectrum. The applied potential and cell current were measured with a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The current to voltage curve (J–V curve) was plotted automatically with a home-built Labview© software. As a comparison, some devices were sealed using a UV curing acrylic sealant (Loctite® 350) and some were measured in air. No significant loss in efficiency was observed in sealed devices compared to those measured under inert conditions, however a significant decrease in efficiency was observed with respect to the devices measured in air. The IPCE (incident photon to current efficiency) was measured using a homemade setup consisting of a 150 W Oriel Xenon lamp, a motorized monochromator and a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The photocurrent and irradiated light intensity were measured simultaneously and processed with a home-built Labview© software.
The thickness of the films was measured with a stylus profilometer Ambios Tech. XP-1, from a scratch applied in the middle of the film.
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) of the samples was performed in tapping mode on a Molecular Imaging model Pico SPM II (pico+). Images were collected in air using silicon probes with a typical spring constant of 1–5 nN m−1 and at a resonant frequency of 75 kHz.
Conventional XRD measurements on thin films were carried out on a Bruker-AXS D8-Discover diffractometer with parallel incident beam (Göbel mirror), a vertical θ–θ goniometer, an XYZ motorized stage mounted on an Eulerian cradle, a incident and diffracted beam Soller slit, a 0.02° receiving slit and a scintillation counter as a detector. Diffraction patterns were recorded over an angular 2θ range of 1° to 25° or 1° to 70°. The data were collected with an angular step of 0.05° at 10 s per step. Cu kα radiation was obtained from a copper X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 40 mA.
2D XRD measurements were performed with the same diffractometer equipped with an HI-STAR area detector (multiwire proportional counter of 30 × 30 cm with 1024 × 1024 pixel) and GADDS software (General Area Diffraction System). Samples were placed directly on the sample holder and the area of interest was selected with the aid of a video-laser focusing system. An X-ray collimator system allows to analyze areas of 500 μm wide. 2D XRD patterns (one frame) were collected covering 1.2–22.3° 2θ at a distance of 15 cm from the sample. The exposition time was 600 s per frame and it was χ-integrated to generate the conventional 2θ vs. intensity diffractogram.
X-ray diffraction quality single crystals were grown by slow diffusion of MeOH in a concentrated solution of DPP(TBFu)2 in CHCl3. The structure was solved by the crystallography service at ICIQ.
Results and discussion
Initial studies on DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM BHJ solar cells (see Fig. 2 for structure) involved thermal annealing but it was surprising to observe that the device characteristics depended greatly on the fabrication conditions.

Remarkably, by exposing the substrates to a saturated dichloromethane atmosphere for as little as 10 seconds following spin-coating, a PCE similar to that reported by Nguyen et al. could be achieved without the need for further thermal annealing. Increasing the exposure time further led to a significant increase in FF, which was accompanied by a decrease in photocurrent (JSC).
Several authors have linked the improvement in FF and PCE to the amount of crystalline domains as well as to their respective size, formed upon SVA.7 It has been suggested that the boiling point as well as the polarity of the solvent used in the SVA step can have a strong influence on the size of the crystalline domains which are formed.16 We conducted a study, where we assessed a range of different solvents spanning a wide range of polarities and boiling points for the SVA step.
Exposure time of the sample to the saturated solvent environment was shown to be critical and extremely sensitive. Annealing times (ta) as short as a few seconds were sometimes sufficient to obtain high fill factors. The evolution of FF with ta follows a trend in which it increases up to a maximum value after a given time followed by a subsequent decrease when the annealing process is carried out for extended periods of time. A visual change of colour of the active layer can be noticed as soon as the blended film is exposed to the solvent vapours, similar to when the film is exposed to high temperature when a thermal annealing treatment is applied. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the J–V characteristics with the annealing time (note that JSC is normalised).

A range of solvents was tested to compare their effect on device performance. Table 1 compares device performance with respect to solvent used during SVA. Note the FF values correspond to the highest values obtained in each case. The study clearly shows that the boiling point of the solvent greatly impacts the device characteristics, with high boiling point solvents – chlorobenzene (CB) and dichlorobenzene (DCB) – giving rise to the poorest characteristics (both JSC and FF). Dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran (THF) display a similar activity in SVA although their polarity and boiling point are dissimilar. Di-ethyl ether with a slightly lower polarity index and boiling point than CH2Cl2 gave somewhat lower FFs. Surprisingly, chloroform, although having similar characteristics to THF in terms of polarity and boiling point, does not show the same improvement in FF and JSC. From these results a broad trend can be drawn, however, the weak molecule–solvent interactions are of great significance to the crystallisation process in active layer blends.12,17

Significantly, the increase in FF obtained through longer ta is always accompanied by a drop in JSC. This is corroborated by incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements (Fig. 4) with a decrease in IPCE observed across the entire spectrum as ta increases.

To rule out the possibility that the observed drop in IPCE is due to a change in the absorption of the films their absorption spectra were recorded (Fig. 5). A difference in absorbance between the annealed and non-annealed films can be seen, with annealing causing a slight increase in absorption and a significant blue shift. Importantly, there is no significant difference in absorbance for any of the annealed films.

Interestingly, the hypsochromic shift observed in the UV-visible spectra of solvent-annealed devices relative to the un-annealed device (Fig. 5) is a characteristic of self-assembled H-aggregates.18 This feature is in agreement with the formation of crystalline domains of donor molecules in the blend.19,20 To demonstrate that these well-ordered domains are of crystalline nature, out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed. We recorded the measurements on an exposed 1 cm2 area of the device where no electrode had been deposited, while J–V curves were recorded on two diodes fabricated on the other half of the same substrate. This allowed us to correlate the degree of crystallinity directly to device characteristics (Fig. 6). Firstly we note that the data for SVA-treated devices are in agreement with a previous report that utilised thermal annealing,5 with the appearance of a peak at 2θ = 6.1° with an interplanar spacing of 14.5 Å (Fig. 6a). This diffraction peak has been attributed to crystalline domains of the donor material, which we confirmed here with a diffractogram of a CH2Cl2-annealed pristine film of DPP(TBFu)2. Diffractograms of a CH2Cl2-annealed pristine film of PC71BM and of a PEDOT:PSS covered ITO substrate have also been recorded in the same conditions for comparison (Fig. 6a). There is no evidence of crystallinity in the pristine PC71BM films. However, this may be due to the sensitivity limitation of our diffractometer as the presence of nanometer-sized crystalline domains of PCBM in polymer-based devices has been evidenced by grazing incidence XRD carried out with synchrotron source X-rays.21,22 The diffractogram of CH2Cl2-annealed devices shows the characteristic peaks of the PEDOT:PSS and ITO layers with the appearance of the diffraction peak of the donor DPP(TBFu)2 at 2θ = 6.1° characteristic of the formation of crystalline domains. Fig. 6b shows the evolution of this signal with solvent annealing time. There was no such peak observed in the non-annealed device. This confirms the formation of crystalline domains of the donor inside the blend upon SVA, and the increase in crystallinity with solvent annealing time. The integrated intensity of the diffraction peak (I, Fig. 6b) increases with solvent annealing time confirming an increase of the diffraction volume inside the blend. Additionally, the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) also increases with ta, confirming that the size of the crystalline domains formed increases with annealing time (concomitantly with the FF in the device), consistent with previous work on SVA.7 Interestingly, the crystallites in the films of pristine DPP(TBFu)2 are significantly smaller than in the blend under the same annealing conditions (Fig. 6a) indicating that the presence of fullerene in the blend is necessary to promote further crystal growth in the donor domains.

(b) The 2θ = 6° region of a non-annealed device and annealed device with ta = 45 s and ta = 120 s. 
To obtain a better understanding of the packing of the DPP(TBFu)2 molecules inside the active layer, X-ray quality single crystals of DPP(TBFu)2 were grown. The single crystal structure was solved and used to compare its diffraction pattern with the diffractograms of the active layer films of the devices.23 Although DPP(TBFu)2 in the single crystal structure shows significant π–π stacking it does not display continuous networks of π-stacked molecules. Rather, DPP(TBFu)2 crystallises in the P21/n space group, forming distinctive stacks in a herringbone arrangement oriented in a near 26° with respect to the a–c plane, each plane of DPP(TBFu)2 stacks being tilted near 50° from one another along the a–b direction (Fig. 7a). In each stack, DPP(TBFu)2 planes are separated by a distance of 3.5 Å, a rather typical distance in BHJ solar cell materials.
 Fig. 7  Views of (DPP(TBFu)2 in the single crystal structure as determined by X-ray crystallography. (a) View along the b–c plane of the unit cell and (b) upper view of two DPP(TBFu)2 molecules of a stack. 
Surprisingly, the overlap of the π–π stacked units is not extensive, occurring between the thiophenyl-benzofuran groups of two consecutive DPP(TBFu)2 molecules in a shifted manner (Fig. 7b). The stacking in the crystal structure agrees with the hypsochromic shift observed upon SVA in the absorption spectra.
In order to compare the packing in the active layer with the single crystal structure and assuming that the crystallites in the active layer would adopt a random orientation, the powder diffractogram of DPP(TBFu)2 was calculated24 and compared with that of the active layer of our device. ‘Over’-annealed films of DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM were produced in order to detect any potential reflexions expected to appear with the increase of crystallite size, but their diffractogram did not show any additional peaks, unfortunately (Fig. 8 and 10). However, the diffractograms show that the reflexion observed experimentally in the active layer film at 2θ = 6.1° appears at a lower 2θ angle than the more intense reflexion (corresponding to the (020) reflexion) in the simulated powder diffractogram (corresponding to b = 29.1 Å against 22.9 Å in the crystal structure) (Fig. 8). As previously demonstrated, the diffraction peak at 2θ = 6.1° can be assigned to such (020) reflexion where the packing along the [010] direction (or along the b axis) is less strained than in the single crystal (29.1 Å instead of 22.9 Å for b) due to the intercalation of solvent or fullerene molecules.22
 Fig. 8  Calculated powder diffractogram of DPP(TBFu)2 from the single crystal structure (red line) and experimental diffractogram of DCM-annealed device (ta = 40 min) (black line). 
However, under our experimental conditions (out-of-plane X-ray diffraction), the lack of additional diffraction peaks in the experimental diffractogram implies the presence of very uniformly oriented crystallites inside the film (i.e. highly texturized). Such hypothesis was unequivocally confirmed with an area diffraction pattern recorded of the film. Indeed, the intensity distribution of the (020) reflexion (2θ = 6.1°) is concentrated in a very well defined spot in the corresponding Debye ring rather than in a continuous ring, accounting for a very uniform orientation along the direction of that reflexion plane over the whole layer (Fig. 9a).23,25 As a comparison, the area diffraction pattern of a powder DPP(TBFu)2 sample recorded in the same conditions is shown in Fig. 9b and displays the expected continuous ring given by a randomly oriented material.

To estimate the expected intensity of the higher order (0k0) reflexions, a diffractogram was simulated using the March–Dollase model26 taking into account the selective orientation along the [010] direction (corresponding to the b axis of the unit cell normal to the substrate surface) and the increase of interplanar spacing.27 The theoretical diffractogram was fitted to the experimental one, with the cell parameter b adjusted to the experimental value (theoretical b = 28.73(2) Å versus 29.1 Å experimental). The resulting fitted diffractogram is shown in Fig. 10 together with the experimental diffractogram recorded on the active layer film. By comparison of both diffractograms it appears that the remaining (0k0) reflexions are expected to be of very weak intensity and would undoubtedly be beyond the response capability of our detector (Fig. 10). Moreover, the fact that a significant degree of paracrystalline disorder is expected in such active layer films28 would also induce some anisotropic peak broadening of the greater order reflexions and impede their detection.

This X-ray data indicate that following the SVA treatment, highly texturized films are formed where crystallites are oriented with the [010] direction normal to the sample surface. The packing of donor molecules inside the active layer can be deemed similar to that of the single crystal structure in the direction normal to the substrate surface. However, the spacing between the different stacks is about 6 Å larger in the film. The DPP(TBFu)2 molecules, positioned head-to-tail in the individual stacks, are inclined roughly 26° with respect to the substrate surface (Fig. 11). It is interesting to note that the donor molecules do not adopt a lamellar structure as in many high efficiency polymer based devices, but a herringbone arrangement where π–π stacking is only predominant over a restricted part of the structure. It is, so far, impossible to determine the packing of the DPP(TBFu)2 stacks along the surface of the substrate. An additional in-plane X-ray diffraction study would allow estimating more precisely the packing along the surface of the substrate. The 6 Å difference in the b parameter from the single crystal structure and the film could not be explained by the intercalation of PC71BM molecules in the stacks, since in both films made out of active layer blends and of pristine DPP(TBFu)2 the interplanar spacing is 29.1 Å. Rather it is most probably due to the intercalation of solvent molecules inside the DPP(TBFu)2 lattice, in this case most probably molecules of chloroform remaining in the films after spin coating.
 Fig. 11  Schematic representation of DPP(TBFU)2:PC71BM devices (side view) showing the stacks of crystallites uniformly oriented normal to the substrate surface. The herringbone arrangement of DPP(TBFu)2 units inside the crystals is symbolised by the black lines. The surface roughness occurring as a result of crystal growth along the direction normal to the substrate is shown by the uneven surface of the active layer. Some amorphous domains of mixed DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM molecules are represented. The presence of such domains is evidenced by the remaining low-energy absorption bands in the UV-vis spectrum, characteristic of a non-crystalline phase.19 
Finally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was utilised in order to corroborate the crystallisation process with the morphology of the active layer. From the results obtained it can be seen that increasing the annealing times leads to a large increase in surface roughness. Here, devices displaying the highest JSC and lowest FF have a root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) value of 1.7 nm with a maximum peak-to-peak height (RP) of 14 nm. These values increase to 5.5 nm and 40 nm respectively for devices SV-annealed for longer times (displaying higher FF) (Fig. 12). Relating the AFM data with the XRD results presented above, we see how the crystal growth affects the morphology of the BHJ, leading to an increase in roughness. The longer the exposure time, the larger the crystalline domains of donor formed causing molecular ‘translocation’ resulting in protruding edges along the sample surface as seen in the AFM micrographs. The 3D pictures show that these protruding edges have the shape of ‘sharp spikes’ in the device annealed for the shortest time and become much wider and prominent upon longer annealing times. This is consistent with a larger portion of small crystalline domains created at short annealing times and a smaller portion of larger crystalline domains at long annealing times. Upon annealing, the active layer changes from a rather homogeneous distribution of small donor crystallites inside the amorphous PC71BM matrix resulting in a large D–A interfacial area (e.g.Fig. 12a and d) to a more heterogeneous distribution of larger crystallites resulting in a significantly smaller D–A interfacial area (e.g.Fig. 12c and f).

(a) and (d) ta = 15 s; FF = 48%; roughness: RMS = 1.7 nm; max. peak-to-peak height = 14 nm (b) and (e) ta = 60 s; FF = 53.3%; roughness: RMS = 2.7 nm; max. peak-to-peak height = 26 nm (c) and (f) ta = 120 s; FF = 59.5%; roughness: RMS = 5.5 nm; max. peak-to-peak height = 40 nm. 
The crystal growth, as shown, dictates the overall size of donor and acceptor domains. However, as recently suggested by Chen and Darling,29 the segregated domains of DPP(TBFu)2 may not be entirely of crystalline nature but composed as well of non-crystalline ‘ordered paths’ formed through the SVA triggered thermodynamic intermolecular assembly. The presence of such domains is evidenced by the remaining low-energy absorption bands in the UV-vis spectrum, characteristic of non-crystalline phase.19
In the present study we have demonstrated that the formation of domains with increasing crystallinity and increasing relative size has a direct impact on the shape of the J–V curve (JSC and the FF) of DPP(TBFu)2-based devices. The control of the donor domain size and ordering is the main parameter controlling the shape of the J–V curves. We observe that at low solvent exposure times the highest JSC was obtained, which can be attributed to smaller domain sizes and a larger D–A interfacial area. This allows a greater number of photogenerated excitons to reach the D–A interface and dissociate. Increasing the domain size leads to the presence of more crystalline domains of greater size with better charge carrier properties and then to higher extracted current at a low internal field, so higher FF. Of course, the trade off for an increase in FF in these devices is that much larger domains are required, which limits the maximum photocurrent that can be extracted due to a reduced D–A interfacial area and a limited exciton diffusion length.
Various explanations have been given regarding the shape of the J–V curve in OSC. It is now widely accepted, at least for polymer–fullerene BHJ devices, that the device built-in field plays only a minor role on CT state dissociation. The built-in field of most OSC devices is typically one order of magnitude lower than those required to overcome the coulomb binding energy of bound polaron pairs.
The unexpectedly high yield of CT dissociation at low internal field (i.e. close to VOC) has mainly been explained by the long range conjugation of polymer chains30 or by the presence of dipoles in the D–A interface.31
In contrast to polymer donors where the high conjugation length allows for CT dissociation to be field-independent, in SM-BHJ devices conjugation is restricted to a very short length (1–2 nm) and efficient CT dissociation at low internal field is highly bound to fast ‘hoping’ rate. Such process deemed to be proportional to the overlap of the wave functions of the hopping partners is thus supposedly occurring mainly through π–π stacked molecules.32 These requirements are met in our devices where upon SVA larger continuous pathways of ordered π stacked molecules inside the highly crystalline domains of the donor form. A faster hopping rate is then expected across the crystallites resulting in the charge being delocalized over the crystallite in a rather similar manner as in the polymer chains. This increase in crystallite size appears to induce a less field dependent CT dissociation and then fewer current losses around VOC.
Additionally, the importance of crystalline texture in bulk heterojunction devices for charge carrier transport through the different crystalline domains in the direction normal to the substrate has been recently demonstrated.33 Indeed, as for inter-molecular transport, transport through crystal boundaries is liable to a strong orbital overlap, reflecting that π–π stacking at the crystal boundaries is equally as important for charge transport through the bulk. In the case of DPP(TBFu)2:PC71BM devices where crystallites display a high degree of orientation, molecules at the crystallites' boundaries are expected to be well aligned and favour a strong molecular orbital overlap.34,35 Moreover, the herringbone arrangement in the crystal structure has shown superior through-boundary charge transport properties even if the crystallite boundaries not perfectly oriented due to the fact that molecules can adopt one of two in-plane orientations, thus decreasing the probability of very weak orbital overlap.34
It appears that molecular arrangement in the crystals, the size of the crystallites and the uniform orientation of the crystallites over the active layer film are the main parameters controlling charge transport. SVA was shown to vary one of these three parameters – i.e. the crystallite size – while keeping the others constant.
Conclusion
In this study, the large increase in FF obtained through SVA leads to values as high as those measured in optimised polymer-based BHJ devices. Upon exposure of the active layer of the device to solvent vapours, crystalline domains of DPP(TBFu)2 donor form inside the PC71BM matrix. The annealing time governs the size of the DPP(TBFu)2 crystallites and therefore the D–A interfacial area. The process of crystal growth has been fully characterised using XRD and AFM and used to explain the increase of FF. It was shown that crystalline growth occurs preferentially in one direction and leads to highly texturized films. The X-ray crystal structure of DPP(TBFu)2 has provided valuable information on the packing of the donor in the active layer film. The adopted herringbone stacking of the donor molecule cannot solely explain device performance as the orbital overlap between the donor molecules in the crystallites is expected to be substantially weaker than that of polymer OSC donors. This work suggests that although π–π stacking is a prerequisite in a SM-BHJ donor material its ability to form crystalline domains of considerable size when blended with the acceptor and its ability to adopt a uniform orientation inside the film are probably equally as important as the individual stacking properties of the donor.

The term ‘slow growth’ was introduced by Yang and co-workers. In their method the spin-coated active layers are left to slowly dry in a closed Petri dish. The active layer is not exposed to an additional vapour of solvent as in what is commonly called ‘solvent annealing’. The effect on crystal growth is believed to be rather similar as in both techniques ‘self-oganisation’ occurs in locally dissolved molecules in the blend through formation of low energy donor–donor conformations (see ref. 9).
