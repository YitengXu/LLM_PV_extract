    , Accepted 29th December 2021First published on 29th December 2021AbstractIn this work, we report the design and successful synthesis of two new heteroleptic polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes (SD-5 and SD-6), by incorporating hetero-aromatic electron-donating N-alkyl-2-phenylindole moieties into the ancillary ligand. These novel ruthenium complexes were used as photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. The primary objective was to investigate the electron-donating effect of the indole segments on the photo-related properties and the influence of the length of terminal alkyl chains tethered to N-indole on the charge recombination resistance. The chemical structures of both targeted compounds were confirmed via FT-IR, 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. Under the same device fabrication conditions, the photovoltaic performance of SD-6 outperformed that of SD-5 and N719 with an overall efficiency of 8.14% (JSC = 19.21 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.675 V and FF = 62.7%), compared to 7.74% of N719 and 4.99% of SD-5. The enhanced photovoltaic power of SD-6 can be attributed to the presence of long alkyl antennas (–C18H37) in SD-6; it reduced the intermolecular aggregation of dyes and suppressed charge recombination, thus resulting in enhanced JSC and VOC values, respectively, compared to its analog SD-5. Furthermore, the presence of indole moieties with long alkyl chains in the ancillary ligand enhanced the photovoltaic performance compared to N719 with bi-anchoring ligands. The photovoltaic and EIS measurements were consistent with the equilibrium molecular geometry calculated using density functional theory (DFT). The structure–property relationships have been discussed in detail.
1. Introduction
To deal with the threat of energy shortage and the environmental pollution brought about by the accelerating consumption of fossil fuel-based energy, the exploitation of solar energy—the most plentiful renewable energy resource—has come into public notice during the past few decades.1 As an efficient type of photovoltaic device, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are usually thought of as a promising replacement for traditional silicon solar cells thanks to their ability to function smoothly at diffuse light conditions and low illumination levels and low fabrication costs.2–4 Research interest in the field of DSSCs was spurred by Dr O’Regan and Dr Gräetzel's seminal publication in 1991.5 As of today, the maximum reported photoconversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs is 13.0% based on a zinc porphyrin complex6 and a phenanthrocarbazole-based metal-free dye,7 respectively. The efficiency was further raised to 28.9% under ambient lighting by joining two judiciously chosen sensitizers as reported in 2017.8 Since the photosensitizer is the most vital element engineering the DSSC performance,9 many researchers have directed their focus into the tailoring of sensitizer structures.10–13
Amongst numerous dyes, ruthenium-based complexes still dominate the marketing trend of commercialized sensitizers because of their appropriate ground and excited state potentials and their unique metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) characteristics.14–17 The representative bipyridyl Ru(II) complexes are N3, N719 and Z907 with maximized efficiencies beyond 10%.18–20 Particularly, N719, primarily reported by Dr Gräetzel,18 serves as a general benchmark in both academic and industrial domains. A lot of effort has been put into the modification of N719 to achieve better photovoltaic performance, including but not limited to the adjustment of ancillary ligands as well as anchoring ligands and the alternation of thiocyanate groups with other strong electron donors.21–24 Previously in our group, the construction of ancillary ligands to obtain a near-infrared region absorption response has been the main research theme for several years and many striking Ru(II) sensitizers have been synthesized and fabricated.25–31
In order to improve the molar extinction coefficient not only for the π → π* transition but also for the 4d → π* (MLCT) one within Ru(II) complexes, one practical method is to integrate strong electron donors as the antennas.32–34 Indole, with one electron-sufficient nitrogen atom, is considered as one of the most promising candidates for designing sensitizers with respectable efficiencies.35 Many metal-free organic sensitizers have employed indole moieties36,37 as well as indole-derived heterocycles such as indoline,38–40 indeno[1,2-b]indole,41,42 and thieno[3,2-b]indole43 to attain highly efficient DSSCs. Dr Kim reported a metal-free sensitizer utilizing the N-substituted thieno[3,2-b]indole moiety to enhance the π-spacer capability and exhibited a remarkable efficiency of 12.45% in DSSC applications.44 Moreover, indole moieties can also be employed for the construction of good co-sensitizers.45–47 Dr Adhikari and Dr El-Shafei reported the synthesis of a novel indole-based co-sensitizer incorporated with bi-anchors and its outstanding co-sensitization effect with a maximum efficiency of 10.68%.48 However, the synthesis of indole-based ruthenium complexes has seldom been reported49,50 and its application in DSSCs was even further rarely observed.51
In this regard, we focused on the incorporation of indole-based moieties into the antennas of the ancillary ligand to synthesis two heteroleptic amphiphilic bipyridyl Ru(II) sensitizers, SD-5 and SD-6, and to study the electron-donating effect of indole segments on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties for DSSCs. Two different lengths of alkyl chains, i.e., 1-octyl and 1-octadecyl groups, were attached to the N-terminal of the indoles to investigate its relation to the retardation of charge recombination.52 To further mediate π-electronic conjugation and avoid dye inter-aggregation, a benzene ring was substituted at the 2-position of the indoles. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) study was carried out to evaluate the correlation between the structure modification and corresponding properties. The chemical structures of SD-5, SD-6 and the benchmark N719 are sketched in Fig. 1.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Molecular design and synthesis
For the benchmark N719, its chemical structure involves two anchoring ligands (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid). Our strategy is to convert one anchoring ligand into an ancillary ligand. The ancillary ligand doesn’t interact with the TiO2 surface directly. It possesses chromophores—indole moieties in our case—which can be adjusted by different substituents to amend the photophysical and electrochemical properties. Our target is to reveal the effect of indole-based electron donors on the overall photoconversion efficiencies of DSSCs with the corresponding ruthenium sensitizers compared to N719 and the effect of different lengths of substituted alkyl chains on the photovoltaic performance, particularly, the photovoltage.
According to Scheme 1, the synthesis of novel Ru(II) dyes took place as a one-pot reaction which has been reported before.22 The ruthenium dimer, targeted ancillary ligand, anchoring ligand and ammonium isothiocyanate were added into the reaction in a sequence. The reaction conditions were optimized before. The products were solidified, purified and analyzed by ATR/FT-IR, 1H NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The detailed synthetic procedures of the ancillary ligand and anchoring ligand are presented in ESI.†

2.2. Photophysical behavior
Electronic absorption and emission spectra of SD-5, SD-6 and N719 were recorded in DMF and are outlined in Fig. 2. The concentration was adjusted to exactly 2 × 10−5 M to derive the corresponding molar extinction coefficients. The photophysical properties are summarized in Table 1.

In Fig. 2, the absorption peaks were closely related to the structures of N-substituted 2-phenylindole-based dyes. The absorption peaks between 297 and 310 nm with molar extinction coefficients in the range of 46100 to 66600 M−1 cm−1 are associated with π → π* transitions, whereas the absorption peaks in the range of 371–381 nm and 516–528 nm are linked to ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions, respectively.53 Considering the photophysical parameters in Table 1, SD-5 and SD-6 possessed similar wavelengths of the π → π* assigned band and LLCT band with similar corresponding molar extinction coefficients, which is due to their mutual indole-based antennas. However, the MLCT band of N719 was greater than that of SD-5 in the molar extinction coefficient and peak broadness; on the contrary, the MLCT molar extinction coefficient of SD-6 was greater than that of N719 which is mainly attributed to its N-octadecyl chain. Therefore, the introduction of strong electron-donating indole moieties with considerably long alkyl chains as the substructure is responsible for an increase in molar absorptivity in the absorption responses as compared to the benchmark dye N719.52
2.3. Electrochemical behavior
The ground state oxidation potentials (GSOP) of SD-5 and SD-6 were calculated from the primary oxidation onset of cyclic voltammetry (CV) graphs. DMF was also used as the solvent for testing with the further addition of 0.1 M [TBA][PF6] as the electrolyte. To standardize the redox potential, the CV of Ferrocene (0.4 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) was measured first as the external ref. 29. Furthermore, the onset of the previously evaluated absorption spectra was applied to determine E0–0 whose definition is the distance between the excited and ground state oxidation potentials. The excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) was calculated as the sum of the E0–0 and GSOP values,29 and all the values as the unit of volt (V) against NHE were exchanged with electron volts (eV) based on eqn (1).54 ESOP = [(GSOP (V) + 4.7)–E0–0] eV(1)
The relationship between the GSOP, dye regeneration, ESOP and electron injection for both the dyes i.e.SD-5 and SD-6 is summarized in Table 2 in comparison with N719 and the corresponding energy level diagram is presented in Fig. 3. The GSOP values are found to be –5.79 and –5.56 eV for SD-5 and SD-6, respectively, confirming that their HOMO levels stay below the potential of redox couple, I3−/I−, in the electrolyte (–5.2 eV),55 hence supplying enough thermodynamic driving power for spontaneous dye regeneration. The GSOP of SD-6 (with C-18 chain lengths on nitrogen of indole moiety) is more destabilized than SD-5 (with C-8 chain length). Furthermore, the ESOP values of SD-5 and SD-6 are calculated to be –3.79 and –3.62 eV, respectively, which are higher in energy than the CB TiO2 (–4.2 eV)56 and provided ample electron injection free energy. Compared to N719, SD-6 has a smaller bandgap (E0–0) value (1.94 eV) which is assigned to its better molar absorptivity in the absorption response. Besides, among these three dyes, the ESOP of SD-6 up-shifted the most, indicating that the electron injection in SD-6 is the most thermodynamically favorable, which is beneficial to the photocurrent. As a result, SD-6 is predicted as potentially the best during the DSSC application.

2.4. Theoretical calculations
Quantum calculations serve as a valuable method to understand the electron separation upon photoexcitation and to rationalize the electrochemical properties. The equilibrium molecular geometries of the novel dyes were calculated using the Gaussian 09 package.57 During the optimization, the solvent effect was taken into consideration by choosing the non-equilibrium version of the CPCM model58 and solvent DMF for consistency with the experimental data. The energy functional and basis set for DFT modeling were selected as PBE1PBE59 and DGDZVP,60,61 respectively. The optimized geometries were consequently submitted to time-dependent (TD)-DFT energy computation without altering the functional and basis set. The ground and excited state oxidation potentials and the lowest bandgap (E0–0) were calculated accordingly and are summarized in Table 3 in comparison with the benchmark N719, which coincide with the laboratorial data.

Fig. 4 outlined the optimized geometries of SD-5 and SD-6 with dihedral angles between primary building blocks. The dihedral angles between the indole segment and the additional phenyl group within one antenna of the ancillary ligands were 65.16° and 65.66° for SD-5 and SD-6, respectively, indicating that the length of alkyl chains did not cause any differences in the steric hindrance on the donors. Furthermore, the indole moieties were coplanar within the pseudo-stilbazole system since the dihedral angles between the indoles and the bipyridine moieties only varied from 4.38° to 6.06° for SD-5 and SD-6. Furthermore, the long alkyl chain in SD-6 functioned as a physical barrier between TiO2 and the electrolyte, which led to suppression of charge recombination and dark current.

Fig. 5 displayed the isodensity surfaces on the frontier orbitals of Ru(II) complexes SD-5, SD-6 and N719, particularly to visualize the molecular orbitals of HOMO and LUMO for all the complexes. The visualization demonstrates that the HOMOs of both indole-based dyes exhibit a ruthenium t2g character, a considerable isodensity on the two thiocyanates and one indole moiety; while in N719, the HOMOs are mainly localized only on the two thiocyanates since N719 has no additional electron-donating segments. The difference in HOMOs is ascribed to the presence of the indole-based chromophore with a strong electron-donating effect. The LUMOs of SD-5 and SD-6 are majorly delocalized over the ruthenium anti-bonding eg orbitals and 4,4′-dicarboxylic-2,2′-bipyridine (dcbpy). Therefore, the strong indole donors guarantee adequate photoexcited electrons and efficient charge transfer via MLCT, leading to a comparable or even higher JSC in the photovoltaic performance compared to N719.

2.5. Photovoltaic characterization
The DSSC performances of the fabricated solar cells with the designed Ru(II) dyes, SD-5, SD-6 and N719 were examined under a solar simulator with standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), i.e., one sun illumination on the nanocrystalline TiO2-based electrode with a commercially available electrolyte (Solaronix, Iodolyte HI-30). Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was employed as a co-adsorbent during the dye absorption.62 DSSCs fabrications were performed on FTO glass, on which two layers of TiO2 were printed and used as the working electrode (photoanode). The prepared photoanode was immersed into a dye/CDCA solution to allow dyes to be anchored onto the TiO2 surface. The counter electrode was prepared by printing a Pt-paste on FTO conductive glass. Both electrodes were sealed together and iodolyte (redox couple) solution was injected into the device.
The J–V characteristic plots of the assembled devices employing SD-5, SD-6 and N719 were drawn in Fig. 6 and their resultant photovoltaic parameters were collected in Table 4. Four fundamental photovoltaic parameters—the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), the fill factor of the cell (FF), and the overall photoconversion efficiency (η)—were included and their relationship was according to eqn (2). (2)

Among these solar devices sensitized with ruthenium dyes, SD-6 gave the highest efficiency of 8.14% (JSC = 19.21 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.675 V and FF = 62.7%), which even outperformed the benchmark N719 with an efficiency of 7.74%. Compared to SD-5, SD-6 achieved higher molar absorptivity and a smaller optical bandgap E0–0, resulting in a considerable improvement in JSC values. Furthermore, the increase in VOC values from SD-5 to SD-6 (0.594 V to 0.675 V) can be attributed to the enhancement of the charge recombination resistance caused by the presence of relatively longer alkyl chains along with the presence of the phenyl indole moiety in the ancillary ligand.63 Considering N719, the solar cells employing the novel indole-based Ru(II) complex, SD-6, displayed a higher JSC value, which can also be ascribed to both the strong electron-donating effect of indole and the anti-aggregation effect of the appendages on the ancillary ligands, i.e., additional phenyls and long alkyl chains. In short, the integration of indole blocks as the ancillary ligand is beneficial to the photovoltaic performance compared to N719 with bi-anchoring ligands.
To further evaluate the relationship between sensitizer structures and the photocurrents, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for all the stated dyes are shown in Fig. 7 as a function of wavelength. The higher molar absorptivity of SD-6 translated into better electron injection, and, hence, greater short-circuit photocurrent density compared to SD-5. In detail, SD-6 with a C-18 chain length on the nitrogen of phenyl indole exhibited considerable overwhelming quantum efficiencies in the range of 350 and 750 nm, and its plateau region between 470 and 570 nm even approached 70%. The IPCE results of SD-6 outperformed the benchmark dye N719 in the visible region as well. The superior performance of SD-6 comes from its greater light harvesting around 350 nm, which is a sharp dip in the case of N719 and enhanced light harvesting in the NIR region (800 nm).

2.6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization
Shortened as EIS, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy offers information to study both the resistance and capacitance properties at the interfaces involving either TiO2/electrolyte or Pt/electrolyte during the operation.64–66 Nyquist and Bode plots provide the charge recombination resistance between TiO2/electrolyte and the lifetime for injected electrons into the conduction band edge of TiO2, respectively.
The Nyquist plot mainly offers charge recombination resistance between different components.67,68 The corresponding plots for the dyes SD-5, SD-6 and N719 are presented in Fig. 8. As discussed previously, the mid-frequency semicircles correspond to charge recombination resistance (RCT) and hence correlate to photovoltage. Comparing SD-6 and N719, SD-6 has a smaller radius on the x-axis of the second semicircle, indicating its lower charge recombination resistance and lower VOC value as measured. On the other hand, the same semicircles are also related to the resistance of charge diffusion (Rd) under Gerischer impedance as reported in previous publications.65,69 In the case of SD-6, two semicircles were observed, indicating that Nernst impedance or RCT outperformed Rd as a standard efficient solar device.28,70 However, in the case of SD-5, RCT is smaller than Rd. The intermediate impedance semicircle for SD-5 is mainly dominated by Gerischer impedance due to the fact that VOC sensitized with SD-5 was lower than SD-6. As a result, a higher RCT improves the VOC values as measured in J–V characteristics.23
 Fig. 8  EIS Nyquist plots for DSCs sensitized with SD-5, SD-6 and N719. 
The Bode plot mainly provides the lifetime for charges in the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2.71 In the Bode plots shown in Fig. 9, the value on the x-axis for the mid-frequency peak gives the lifetime in the CB TiO2, which also reveals the electron recombination between the electrolyte and TiO2. The electron lifetime (τe) can be derived from eqn (3): τe = 1/(2πf)(3)Where f is the corresponding x-value of the peak. As the peak is shifting to the low-frequency region, the electron lifetime becomes extended. According to this equation, the frequency peak of the DSSCs based on SD-6 was 18 Hz which corresponded to a lifetime of 8.8 ms, leading to the comparably higher VOC of 0.67 V; whereas SD-5 exhibited a 257 Hz peak value on the frequency axis and the lifetime of electrons in the CB of TiO2 was calculated as 0.61 ms, thus resulting in a lower VOC of 0.59 V. In short, the EIS results prove that, owing to spatial constraint, the longer alkyl chain on the indole-based electron-donating ancillary ligands can deliver a strong anti-aggregation effect, sufficient suppression of charge recombination and an undesirable dark current.

3. Conclusions
This study reported the DSSC application of novel N-alkyl-2-phenylindole-based Ru(II) complexes, namely, SD-5 and SD-6, which are constructed as highly efficient sensitizers. Solar cells based on SD-6 gave an overall efficiency (η) reaching 8.14% which also outperformed the benchmark N719 with an efficiency of 7.74%. SD-6 displayed greater negative free energy for charge injection compared to N719, leading to an impressively higher photocurrent density JSC value, i.e., 19.21 mA cm−2. According to the EIS results, charge recombination resistance was closely related to the VOC values. In the case of SD-5, the Gerischer impedance should be considered. The higher JSC of SD-6 compared to that of SD-5 can be justified by the comparatively smaller bandgap and larger electron injection free energy. Both JSC and VOC values are highly influenced by the length of the N-substituted alkyl chain tethered to the indole unit. Thus, a paradigm shift of photovoltaic performance could be brought about by the molecular modification of indole-derived moieties in Ru(II) sensitizers.
