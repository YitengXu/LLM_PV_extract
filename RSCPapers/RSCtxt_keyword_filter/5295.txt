    , Accepted 19th September 2018First published on 20th September 2018AbstractPerovskite-structured cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) halide provides new opportunities for promoting the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSC) due to its high carrier mobility and light absorption coefficient as well as remarkable environmental stability at high humidity and high temperatures. Herein, all-carbon electrodes from multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and carbon black (CB) were prepared for all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon. The as-prepared electrodes were free of hole-transporting layers and precious metals. The work function and electrical conductivity of the carbon electrode were tuned by changing the MWCNT/CB ratio to reduce charge recombination at the perovskite/carbon interface. The optimal all-inorganic PSC achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.62% using the MWCNT (75 wt%)/CB (25 wt%) electrode in comparison with 6.24% for the pure MWCNT-based device. Upon persistent attack by 80% RH in air atmosphere, the solar cell retains 95% of its initial efficiency over 1100 h.
Introduction
Over the past few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their remarkably enhanced properties.1–6 Since the first prototype was developed in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been improved from 3.8% to the certified 23.2% in 2018.7–12 This rapid PCE enhancement demonstrates PSCs as promising competitors to silicon solar cells. However, the poor tolerance of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbX3) and formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbX3) to moisture, thermal and ultraviolet-light attack has significantly limited the commercial application of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.13 Moreover, the use of noble metal back-electrodes (for example, Au and Ag) and expensive hole-transport materials (HTMs, P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD)14–22 in state-of-the-art hybrid PSCs has been an economical burden for commercialization. To address these issues, all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs free of HTMs were developed in 2016, with features of excellent environmental stability and considerable photovoltaic performances.23–26 One of the remaining problems is that the large bandgap (2.3 eV) of CsPbBr3 results in a narrow spectral response (<550 nm) and unsatisfactory PCE outputs in corresponding PSCs. Although the substitution of iodide with bromide markedly reduces the bandgaps and enhances cell efficiencies, the stability at high humidity and high temperature is simultaneously reduced. Another problem is the use of noble Au electrodes, which still result in high fabrication costs for inorganic CsPbI3−xBrx PSCs. Therefore, it is a challenge to develop high-performance and cost-effective CsPbBr3-based inorganic PSCs free of HTMs and noble metal back-electrodes.
Carbon materials have been widely used in the fields of photocatalysis, sensors, renewable energy, etc.27–36 Owing to their high conductivity, good chemical stability and low cost, the combination of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and carbon black (CB) is theoretically regarded as a promising way to fabricate high-performance back electrodes for inorganic PSC applications. MWCNT are used to increase the electrical conductivity of carbon electrodes, while CB is added to tune the combination of carbonaceous species and hole transporting performances. In this study, an all-carbon back-electrode from MWCNT/CB was fabricated for HTM-free CsPbBr3-based inorganic PSCs with the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon configuration. By changing the MWCNT/CB ratio, the work function (WF) and electrical conductivity of the carbon electrode is tuned to minimize the energy difference at the perovskite/carbon interface and maximize the charge extraction.37 The optimized PSC achieves a PCE of 7.62% and remarkable stability in 80% RH.
Results and discussion
The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the all-inorganic PSC with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon is shown in Fig. 1a. This image shows that the final device is a well-defined multilayer structure with thicknesses of 300, 300 and 600 nm for c-TiO2/m-TiO2, CsPbBr3 and carbon electrode, respectively. As shown in the top-view SEM image of the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 film (Fig. 1c), the perovskite layer has a dense and smooth surface with grain size in the range of 400 nm–1.6 μm, where the large grains along with vertical and monolayer arrangement are beneficial to maximize charge-transfer kinetics and minimize energy loss at the grain boundaries. The carbon electrode comprises homogeneous MWCNT and CB, as shown in Fig. 1d and Fig. S1.† The addition of CB to the MWCNT framework is beneficial to improve the hole transporting behaviour and binding of carbonaceous species. Upon solar illumination, the CsPbBr3 layer absorbs photons and releases electrons from the conduction band of perovskite (−3.3 eV) to the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.2 eV), leaving holes to increase the WF of the carbon electrode. The MWCNT provide electronic conductivity for the carbon electrode, while the addition of CB improves the hole extraction and binding of the carbon film to the perovskite film.

The current(J)–voltage(V) characteristics of the all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs with MWCNT, 25 wt% CB, 30 wt% CB and 40 wt% CB electrodes are presented in Fig. 2a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters including short-circuit density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are summarized in Table 1. It is worth noting that the solar cell with the MWCNT electrode displayed the worst performances with a Voc of 1.294 V, Jsc of 6.35 mA cm−2, FF of 76%, and PCE of 6.26%. Its low photovoltaic performances are attributed to the large energy difference (1.0 eV) at the CsPbBr3/MWCNT interface and poor adhesion of the carbon electrode with perovskite. Both the large interfacial energy difference and poor contact produce severe electron–hole recombination. Therefore, CB nanoparticles were used to address these two issues, and the device tailored with the 25 wt% CB electrode achieved a Voc of 1.431 V, Jsc of 6.84 mA cm−2, FF of 78%, and PCE of 7.62%. The mechanism behind the improved performances is mainly derived from the reduced energy difference at the CsPbBr3/carbon interface. In order to demonstrate why CB can reduce energy loss at the CsPbBr3/back electrode interface, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) of four carbon electrodes at various CB dosages were recorded and shown in Fig. S2.† The WF values of the carbon electrodes were determined to be −4.6, −4.7, −4.8 and −4.9 eV for MWCNT, 25 wt% CB, 30 wt% CB and 40 wt% CB electrodes, yielding energy differences at the perovskite/carbon interface of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7 eV (Fig. 1b), respectively. Although the 30 wt% CB and 40 wt% CB electrodes have closer WF edges to the valence band (VB) of perovskite, the device performances are not maximized because of the high Ohmic resistance (Fig. S3a†) and low electrical conductivity (Fig. S3b†). By combining the Nyquist plot results (Fig. S3c†), we can conclude that the superior performance of the 25 wt% CB device may be attributed to its lowest series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) (Table S1†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the all-inorganic PSCs in Fig. 2b were used to demonstrate the photon-to-electron conversion behaviours. Since the bandgap of CsPbBr3 halide is as large as 2.3 eV, all the devices have a narrow spectral response at 300–550 nm. In addition, the 25 wt% CB electrode-tailored inorganic PSC exhibits a significant improvement in the maximal EQE values compared with the other devices, which stems from the effective hole extraction from perovskite to the carbon layer. By Integrating the EQE spectra for the solar cells with MWCNT, 25 wt% CB, 30 wt% CB and 40 wt% CB electrodes, the corresponding Jsc values were determined to be 6.25, 6.76, 6.69 and 6.28 mA cm−2, respectively. These data are in a good agreement with the J–V characterization. Fig. 2c shows the statistical PCE data of twenty solar cells, suggesting high replicability using the method reported herein. According to the steady-state PCE outputs (Fig. 2d), the devices have stabilized PCE outputs for over 120 s, which are 6.26%, 7.52%, 6.92%, and 6.3%. These values agree well with the PCEs obtained from the reverse scan for the J–V characterization.

The leakage current density obtained from the dark J–V curves was measured to explore the intrinsic charge-transfer mechanism of the all-inorganic PSCs, as shown in Fig. 3a.38–40 Clearly, the peak current has a sharp reduction/increase cycle. Under a reverse bias, the dark current for the solar cell with the 25 wt% CB electrode is drastically lower than that of the other devices, indicating minimum current leakage. At higher forward bias such as higher than 1.16 V, the largest injected Jsc for the PSC with 25 wt% CB suggests the lowest charge injection barrier at CsPbBr3/carbon interface. The peak current mainly depends on the quality of the CsPbBr3/carbon interface, and it is determined that the leakage current and charge injection barrier obey the order 25 wt% CB < 30 wt% CB < 40 wt% CB < MWCNT, which refers to the charge extraction ability of 25 wt% CB > 30 wt% CB > 40 wt% CB > MWCNT.

The J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices under dark conditions were measured to investigate the trap states density of the all-inorganic PSCs, as shown in Fig. 3b. Each curve exhibits a linear response at a low bias, revealing the Ohmic response of the devices below the kink points. Once the applied bias voltage exceeds the kink point, the remarkable increase in current density indicates completely filled trap states in perovskite. Therefore, the kink point is usually represented by a trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL).41 It has been reported that the trap state density is positively correlated to VTFL,42,43 where the lowest VTFL for the PSC tailored with 25 wt% CB suggests that the trap state in the CsPbBr3 film is effectively passivated. This lower trap state density is one of intrinsic factors leading to its performance enhancement.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were measured to compare the charge extraction ability of the carbon electrodes from the CsPbBr3 layer. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, the PL intensity is in the order MWCNT > 40 wt% CB > 30 wt% CB > 25 wt% CB. In comparison with the other solar cells, the PSC with the 25 wt% CB electrode exhibits significant fluorescence quenching, suggesting more efficient charge extraction from CsPbBr3.44,45 The remarkable fluorescence quenching phenomena of CsPbBr3/carbon was verified via TRPL characterization, as shown in Fig. 3d. By fitting the TRPL data with a double-exponent,46–48 the corresponding carrier lifetimes were calculated to be τ1 = 3.953 ns and τ2 = 1.124 ns (MWCNT electrode), τ1 = 1.617 ns and τ2 = 0.171 ns (25 wt% CB electrode), τ1 = 2.069 ns and τ2 = 0.185 ns (30 wt% CB electrode), and τ1 = 2.159 ns and τ2 = 0.220 ns (40 wt% CB). The lowest carrier lifetime confirms that the photo-induced holes are efficiency extracted by adding 25 wt% CB in the carbon back-electrode.
In order to investigate the charge recombination kinetics of the all-inorganic PSCs, we measured the relationships between Jsc and light intensity. As depicted in Fig. 3e, the Jsc is approximately linear to the light intensity; therefore, we performed a nonlinear fit according to the following equation:49,50 Jsc ∝ Iα(1)where, Jsc is the short-circuit current density and α is the charge recombination factor. If α is closer to 1.000, the device has less bimolecular recombination. According to the relevant formula, the α values for the PSCs tailored with 25, 30, 40 and 0 wt% CB were calculated to be 0.990, 0.982, 0.973 and 0.965, respectively. Similarly, the dependence of Voc on light intensity was also studied using the following equation51,52 and shown in Fig. 3f. Voc = nkT/qln(I) + constant(2)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, and q is elementary charge. By linearly fitting Voc as a function of light intensity, the slopes are 1.55kBT/e, 1.74kBT/e, 1.75kBT/e and 1.84kBT/e. Theoretically, the device will be governed by monomolecular recombination if the slope is closer to 2kBT/e. The lowest slope for the 25 wt%CB-based device indicates that the charge recombination at the perovskite/carbon interface is effectively reduced.
Similarly important to a high PCE, improved stability at high humidity atmosphere is also applied to assess the potential commercialization of a PSC. The FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon device with 25 wt% CB was persistently exposed to 80% RH in air (temperature = 25 °C). The time-dependent photovoltaic parameters including PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF are shown in Fig. 4. Apparently, this device, which is free of encapsulation, is relatively stable over 1100 h, retaining 95% of its initial PCE. This improved stability may arise from the chemical stability of the CsPbBr3 crystal even under moisture attack as well as protection by the hydrophobic carbon electrode.

Conclusions
In summary, an all-inorganic PSC with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon and free of HTM and precious metals was successfully fabricated using the cost-effective carbon back electrode. The charge extraction at the perovskite/carbon interface is maximized by tuning the WF and electrical conductivity of carbon by changing the MWCNT/CB ratio. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the inorganic PSC tailored with a carbon electrode having 25 wt% CB presents the best performances, yielding a maximum PCE of 7.62%, Voc of 1.431 V, Jsc of 6.84 mA cm−2 and FF of 78%. Moreover, the all-inorganic PSC retains 95% of its initial PCE even in 80% RH for over 1100 h. The high efficiency and improved stability demonstrate that inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs tailored with all-carbon electrodes provide new opportunities to promote their commercialization.
