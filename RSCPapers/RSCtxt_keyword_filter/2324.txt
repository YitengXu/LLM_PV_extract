1. Introduction
Very soon after the successful demonstration of graphene, other graphene analogous ultrathin 2D nanostructures such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal oxides (TMOs), phosphorene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have also received a great deal of attention due to their remarkable physical and chemical properties.1–8 Among the large family of ‘post-graphene’ materials, TMDs have become the focus of enormous research owing to their distinctive compositional and structural features.9–14 TMDs consist of a variety of materials with diverse electronic properties ranging from insulators (e.g. HfS2), semiconductors (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2), semimetals (e.g. TiSe2), and metals (e.g. NbS2 and VSe2). The outstanding properties of TMDs have stimulated basic studies and technological progress in diverse applications such as electronics,15,16 sensing,17–19 biomedicine20,21 and energy conversion and storage.22–24 However, the tremendous popularity of 2D TMDs does not exclusively depend on their inherent material properties, but largely originates from their adjustable properties. Several strategies have been widely investigated for improving the innate features of 2D TMDs including intercalation,25,26 alloying,27–29 employing pressure,30,31 irradiation,32,33 and so on. Modifying the intrinsic properties of 2D TMDs by hybridizing them with other materials is one of the most fascinating approaches to overcome their constraints.34,35 Great achievements in the production of 2D TMD nanosheets through various scalable approaches have paved the way for fabricating hybrid nanostructures by utilizing them as constructing components.
Recently, the combination of CPs with ultrathin TMD nanosheets to fabricate functional TMD/CP nanocomposites has received increasing attention not only for understanding the fundamental properties of these hybrid nanostructures but also for utilizing them in various kinds of applications. Conducting polymers with π-conjugated polymeric backbones possess several unique features such as high electrical conductivity in the doped state, mechanical flexibility and ease of synthesis, tunable physical properties, and facile chemistry. Tremendous effort has been devoted to the development of synthetic methods for TMD/CP with various morphologies, structures, and properties in order to satisfy the requirements arising from different applications.

Fig. 1 provides a schematic outlook of the field of TMD/CP nanocomposites. Starting from the center of the circle, the schematic shows the main synthetic routes based on the order of addition of each component and the applications of these nanocomposites. In this review, we initially introduce the synthetic strategies for the preparation of TMD/CP hybrid nanocomposites with different structures. Following that, we describe their promising applications in supercapacitors, batteries, sensors and so on. The focus is laid on those nanocomposites with attractive structures or applications. Finally, we give brief personal perspectives on the future challenges and opportunities for this appealing research area.

2. Synthesis and characterization
The properties and performances of TMD/CP nanocomposites not only rely on the quality and morphology of each component, but also highly depend on the type of fabrication approach, which strongly governs the strength of interfacial interaction. Depending on the mechanism and procedure for the fabrication, the synthetic strategies of TMD/CP nanocomposites can be divided into three major categories: (1) in situ synthesis, (2) ex situ synthesis, and (3) one-pot (simultaneous) synthesis. In the following subsections, these synthetic routes and the corresponding produced TMD/CP nanohybrids will be discussed with strong emphasis on the appealing structures.
2.1 
          In situ synthesis
The in situ synthesis approach has been widely applied to fabricate TMD/CP hybrid nanomaterials with a rich variety of morphologies. In the in situ synthesis, nucleation and growth of one component occurs in the presence of its counterpart which serves as a template. Therefore, utilizing the in situ method for synthesizing TMD/CP nanocomposites leads to effective interfacial interaction between 2D TMD nanosheets and CPs.

2.1.1 TMD nanosheet-templated nanocomposites. 

In situ chemical oxidative polymerization of CPs in the presence of TMD nanosheets is one of the most commonly used methods to construct TMD/CP nanocomposites. While PANi is the most used CP to incorporate into TMD nanostructures by using this method,36–53 other CPs such as PPy,42,54–59 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)60,61 and polythiophene (PTh)62 have also been employed to obtain TMD/CP nanohybryids. The in situ polymerization method involves the polymerization of monomers in a system containing the TMD nanosheets. The typical procedure is as follows: monomers for CP and TMD nanosheets are added into the host dispersion. Then an oxidant solution is added and the monomer polymerizes. TMD/CP nanocomposites can be obtained after purification treatment. The morphology of the CP composite can be controlled by tuning the polymerization conditions such as the concentration of monomer, dopant and oxidant, the molar ratio of oxidant to monomer, the temperature and the time of the reaction. As a typical example, Zhu et al. have demonstrated a novel method to construct MoS2/PANi nanocomposites by coupling polyaniline nanoneedle arrays with MoS2 nanosheets via an ice-reaction process (Fig. 2A).36 By introducing a dilute amount of aniline monomer to the solution containing chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets, aniline molecules were absorbed onto the surface of MoS2 nanosheets through electrostatic forces. Then by adding ammonium persulfate (APS) as an oxidant, the polymerization process was initiated. The nanoneedle arrays were grown on both sides of the sheets (Fig. 2B) with a length of around 50 nm and a diameter of 20 nm (Fig. 2C). The length of the nanoneedles can be easily tuned by changing the reaction time. In addition, no clear crystal lattices were observed in the needles that confirmed the amorphous nature of these nanoneedles (Fig. 2D and E). The perfect lattice periodicity was observed from the dark part of the architecture (Fig. 2F). These observations demonstrated that amorphous nanoneedles were well coupled with the MoS2 nanosheets. In another report, Ren and co-workers demonstrated the preparation of vertically aligned PANi nanowire arrays on both the external and internal surface of 3D tubular MoS2 by using in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline monomers (Fig. 3A).46 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicates an uneven layer assembled surface (Fig. 3B). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows a clear contrast between the dark rough edge and the pale interior in the tubular MoS2, suggesting its hollow structure characteristic (Fig. 3C). From the HRTEM image, ultrathin single nanosheets in the rim of tubular MoS2 can be identified (Fig. 3D). However, for MoS2/PANi hybrid material, not only the external diameter increases to 290 nm from 190 nm, but also its internal diameter decreases to 40 nm from 80 nm after PANi is grown on the surface of the tubular MoS2, suggesting that PANi nanowire arrays are grown on both the external and internal surfaces of the tubular MoS2 (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the outside surface of the tubular MoS2 is covered by PANi nanowire arrays with a diameter of 10–20 nm, resulting in an apparently porous surface (Fig. 3F). The HRTEM image of the MoS2/PANi hybrid material shows that an interplanar spacing of 0.62 nm can be attributable to the (002) plane of MoS2 nanosheets, while no clear interplanar spacing of PANi is observed (Fig. 3G), suggesting nearly amorphous character of PANi in the hybrid material. Besides growing on the surface of TMD nanostructures, CPs can intercalate between the interlayer gaps of few-layered MoS2 nanosheets.38,60 For example, Wang and co-workers have demonstrated a facile synthesis of MoS2/PANi nanocomposites doped with dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) using the in situ chemical polymerization method. The small size of the aniline monomer allows for easy intercalation of the interlayer MoS2, forming a uniform dispersion. During the polymerization of MoS2/PANi intercalation composites, an aniline monomer could form an aniline nitrenium cation under the effect of the free radical initiator. The aniline nitrenium cation tends to bond with the negatively charged MoS2 layers. On the other hand, DBSA decreases the surface energy of the inorganic MoS2 layers; thus the polarity of MoS2 layers is close to that of the aniline monomers. The two aspects mentioned above are favorable to the intercalation of aniline monomers into the interlayers of MoS2. The intercalation of PANi into the MoS2 host layers was further confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction technique. Compared with bulk MoS2, the interlayer spacing of MoS2 in the intercalation composite was expanded by approximately 5.5 Å due to the intercalation of PANi.38 In addition, Liu et al. demonstrated controlled patterning of mesoporous conducting polymers of PPy and PANi on various functional free-standing surfaces such as 2D MoS2 nanostructures via solution-based assembly of close-packing monolayers of block copolymer micelles.42 Amphiphilic polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) diblock copolymers with different PS block lengths and PS:PEO ratios were chosen as structure-directing macromolecules that can self-assemble into spherical micelles in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) and H2O solvent mixture. The spherical PS-b-PEO micelles were closely organized on both 2D surfaces via H-bonding and guided the oriented in situ polymerization of pyrrole or aniline monomers. Upon the removal of BCP templates, patterned PPy and PANi with regular mesoporous features on free-standing 2D surfaces were achieved.

2.1.2 Polymer-templated approach. 
Constructing 2D TMD nanosheets in the presence of a polymer matrix is a fascinating approach to fabricate hierarchical hybrid TMD/CP nanostructures and has been reported by several groups.63–72 For example, Yang and co-workers have reported a novel strategy to fabricate hierarchical MoS2/PANi nanowires under mild conditions (≤200 °C).64 This method combines synthesis of the organic precursor and hydrothermal sulfuration. Starting from the 1D precursor of Mo3O10(C6H8N)2·H2O (anilinium trimolybdate), MoOx/PANi nanowires were obtained after polymerization, which were then converted to MoS2/PANi via the hydrothermal process with thiourea (Fig. 4A). This strategy has also been adopted by some other groups.63,66 Microscopy characterization studies conducted by Zhang and co-workers clearly show the uniform and dense growth of MoS2 nanosheets with an outstanding edge-rich morphology (Fig. 4B and C). The MoS2 nanosheets were rooted into PANi in a vertical direction. A HRTEM image of MoS2/PANi (inset of Fig. 4C) shows that MoS2 nanosheets with some folded edges exhibit parallel lines with an interlayer distance of 0.62 nm, attributed to the (002) lattice of MoS2. In addition, elemental mapping images of C, N, Mo, and S elements corresponding to scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm uniform distribution of Mo and S elements on each PANi nanofiber (Fig. 4D).

2.1.3 Other in situ methods. 
In another approach, fabrication of MoS2 and self-doped polyaniline (MoS2/SPAN) nanocomposites was achieved by utilizing a chemical exfoliation method.73–75 In this approach, MoS2/SPAN nanocomposites were constructed through intercalation of SPAN nanofibers to the layer space of bulk MoS2 by applying ultrasonic waves. Owing to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged SPAN and MoS2 and the strong π–π* stacking between the backbones of SPAN and the MoS2 the obtained nanocomposites were homogeneous and stable. Furthermore, a facile method of electropolymerization has also been developed for the construction of MoS2/PEDOT nanocomposite films by electrodeposition of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in the presence of MoS2 nanosheets.76 In addition to the electropolymerization approach, fabrication of TMD/CP nanocomposite thin films can be achieved by using the vapor phase polymerization technique. Recently, Vucaj and co-workers have reported the successful inclusion of 2D MoS2 nanosheets within PEDOT-Tosylate using the vapor-phase polymerization method. First, by adding sterically stabilized dispersions of 2D MoS2 into the oxidant solution, oxidant thin films were deposited on glass microscope slides. Then the obtained thin films were exposed to EDOT monomer vapor and the polymerization process was carried out in a vacuum oven.77

2.2 
          Ex situ synthesis
The ex situ approach means that for fabrication of TMD/CP nanocomposites, the CPs and TMD nanosheets are synthesized separately, and then hybridization is achieved during a subsequent step by direct or more complex blending of the components. Although this approach requires more time and steps to complete, the structure, size and morphology of the hybridizing component are pre-defined.

2.2.1 Solution mixing approach. 
The direct mixing approach is one of the simplest and most direct methods for the preparation of TMD/CP nanocomposites and has been reported by several groups.78–83 In short, CP and TMD nanosheets are dispersed separately in solvent using mechanical stirring or ultrasonication, followed by mixing and filtration. For example, Jiang and co-workers have reported the incorporation of a small amount of liquid-phase exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets into PEDOT:PSS solutions by using sonication assisted mixing (Fig. 5).79 Initially, two different dispersions of MoS2 were prepared by the solvent exfoliation technique in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF). MoS2 nanosheets were also obtained by chemical exfoliation with n-butyllithium. The resultant intercalated powder was exfoliated in deionized water. Then aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution was added into specified amounts of as-prepared MoS2 dispersions and the resulting mixtures were sonicated. The PEDOT:PSS/MoS2 composite thin films were fabricated through direct vacuum filtration with a PVDF membrane. Finally, the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS/MoS2 thin films were dried in a vacuum oven.

2.2.2 Electrophoretic deposition. 
The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been utilized to construct MoS2/PANi composite films (Fig. 6).84 This method is a promising approach, as it enables precise control over the film deposition rate, thickness and uniformity. At first, few layered MoS2 nanosheets were synthesized by the chemical exfoliation method. 1D polyaniline nanowires were prepared by the chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomers using APS as the oxidant. Then, the colloidal solution of the hybrid MoS2/PANi was prepared by mixing the solutions and sonicating. By applying a constant DC voltage to the conducting substrate (stainless steel substrate) against a graphite electrode in a colloidal suspension of MoS2/PANi composites, the fabrication process was carried out.

2.3 One-pot synthesis. 
This method is one of the most straightforward methodologies for the fabrication of different types of nanocomposites. Recently, Lei and co-workers have reported the preparation of MoS2/PPy nanocomposites through a redox reaction between ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and pyrrole monomer under hydrothermal conditions without any other templates.85 The obtained nanocomposite displayed an algae-like morphology with a diameter of about several hundreds of nanometers, which is composed of several folded thin pieces (Fig. 7A and B). The morphology of the MoS2/PPy composites was attributed to self-assembly of MoS2 during the hydrothermal process, in which ammonium tetrathiomolybdate was reduced to MoS2 in the presence of pyrrole monomer and the obtained thin MoS2/PPy composite self-assembled into a 3D architecture by partial overlapping. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images confirmed successful fabrication of MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. 7C). The fringe with a lattice spacing of 0.27 nm corresponds to the (100) plane of MoS2. The (002) plane of MoS2 with a lattice spacing of 0.61 nm was observed. Moreover, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images (Fig. 7D) confirmed the presence of N in the PPy/MoS2 nanocomposites with the identical shape of Mo and S, which revealed the existence of PPy and MoS2 in the product.

3. Applications
The construction of composite structures by utilizing TMD nanosheets and CPs as the components is considered a promising approach for combining the exceptional 2D features of TMD nanostructures with outstanding properties of CPs, which paves the way for using them in many promising applications such as energy storage, sensing applications, hydrogen production, and so on.
3.1 Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors, also known as ultracapacitors or electrochemical capacitors, have attracted tremendous scientific interest for use in advanced energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh power density, long operating lifetime, rapid charging/discharging, safe operation and low cost of maintenance.86 According to the energy storage mechanism, supercapacitors can be classified into two types: electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. EDLCs store the energy physically by adsorption of ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Pseudocapacitors utilize another approach in which energy storage takes place through charge-transfer reactions between the electrochemically active electrode surface and the electrolyte ions. Both of these mechanisms can occur concurrently depending on the type of electrode material.
TMD nanostructures such as MoS2 and WS2 have been widely studied for use in electrochemical storage due to their sheet-like morphology. However, these nanosheets suffer from relatively low electrical conductivities, which hinders their use as electrodes in supercapacitors. To overcome such a problem, compositing these nanosheets with conducting materials such as CPs is considered a promising approach (Table 1). Among the different types of CPs, PANi has been mostly studied for this purpose because of its high conductivity, low cost, strong electrochemical activity, and satisfactory electrochemical stability.36,38,47,50 For example, Zhu and co-workers demonstrated that the nanocomposite made of an aligned array of PANi nanoneedles on ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.36 A high specific capacitance of 669 F g−1 was depicted with the voltage window of ±0.6 V at a current density of 1 A g−1 and higher capacitances of 821 and 853 F g−1 were delivered when the voltage window changed from ±0.6 to ±0.8 and ±1.0 V, respectively. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the MoS2/PANi nanostructure remained as high as 180 F g−1 at a very high current density of 50 A g−1, which indicates its high power capability. In addition, this nanocomposite exhibited excellent cycling performance. The capacitance retention was ≈91% after 4000 cycles at a constant current density of 10 A g−1 within the potential window of ±0.6 V, while it showed 83% capacitance retention when the potential windows changed to ±1.0 V. This remarkable electrochemical performance can be attributed to the following reasons. First, interlayer space of thin MoS2 nanosheets provide useful space for ion storage, assisting rapid access of electrolyte ions for fast faradaic redox reactions. Second, the PANi nanoneedles allow the effective intercalation of H+ ions into its frameworks and transportation of electrons. Third, the nanosized MoS2 thin nanosheets and PANi nanoneedles are considered more desirable than powder nanostructures in terms of shorter diffusion paths for H+ ions and electrons. Fourth, the flexible PANi is favorable for accommodating the structure strain of MoS2 nanosheets caused by the H ion insertion/extraction. In addition to PANi, PPy has also been used in compositing with MoS2 for supercapacitor applications.55–57,71 As a typical example, Tang and co-workers reported the utilization of MoS2/PPy nanocomposites as electrode materials for supercapacitors (Fig. 8).55 MoS2/PPy nanocomposites with the mass ratio of 25.8:1 displayed capacitance of 695 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 which is much higher than that of MoS2 monolayers, pure PPy, and graphene/PPy. In addition, the electrode of MoS2/PPy nanocomposites exhibited remarkably high energy and power densities as can be seen in the Ragone plot, for example, 83.3 Wh kg−1 at 3332 W kg−1, which surpassed many other reported electrode materials. The enhanced capacitance can be ascribed to the metallic nature of 1 T phase MoS2 monolayers, strong interface interaction between PPy and MoS2 sheets, and uniform and ultrathin PPy films with a large surface area.

Moreover, ternary hybrid nanomaterials have also been shown to display an outstanding electrochemical performance. These ternary nanocomposites can be achieved by adding either other CPs87 or nanostructures.44,50,53,69 For example, Wang and co-workers used the MoS2/PPy/PANi ternary nanocomposite as an electrode material for supercapacitors (Fig. 9).87 The MoS2/PPy/PANi electrode exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance of 1273 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, which was much higher than those of MoS2 nanosheets (169 F g−1), PPy (136 F g−1), PANi (528 F g−1), MoS2/PPy (449.5 F g−1), and MoS2/PANi (784 F g−1). Besides, the coulombic efficiency of the MoS2/PPy/PANi electrode is observed above 92% at 1 A g−1, indicating a good electrochemical reversibility. The MoS2/PPy/PANi electrode remains as high as 673 F g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1, maintaining ≈53% of its capacitance at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The excellent rate capability in the MoS2/PPy/PANi electrode could be attributed to short ion diffusion paths and good electrical conductivities. In addition, the Nyquist plots of electrodes obtained by EIS measurements displayed no semicircles for all the electrodes in high-frequency regions, indicating extremely low electron transfer resistances of all electrodes. Nearly straight lines in low frequency regions represented the ion diffusion and transport due to an EDLC behavior. Such superior performance of the MoS2/PPy/PANi hybrid nanostructure electrode can be attributed to the enhanced electrode/electrolyte interface interactions of intimately attached PANi nanoparticles on the layered PPy structures, providing more electroactive regions with rapid, reversible faradic reactions and shorter ion diffusion paths. Moreover, MoS2 nanosheets in the ternary hybrid provide a large surface area that allows excellent electrolyte access, as well as providing a low internal resistance. Furthermore, the transition metal centers of MoS2 might form strong coordination with nitrogen atoms in PANi and PPy. The Mo ions from MoS2 which are intimately coordinated with nitrogen atoms (from CP) possess a range of oxidation states from +2 to +6, resulting in additional pseudocapacitance performance.

3.2 Lithium-ion batteries
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are among the most popular energy storage systems that have been extensively exploited to power many portable electronic devices.88–90 The performance of lithium-ion batteries greatly relies on the intrinsic properties of their electrode materials. Recently, 2D TMD nanosheets have been utilized as electrode materials due to their ultrathin thickness and high surface-to-volume ratio.91,92 However, TMD-based electrodes suffer from unsatisfactory cyclability and low rate capability due to their intrinsically poor electrical conductivity and structural degradation during the charge/discharge process. One attractive strategy to overcome these drawbacks is hybridizing TMD nanosheets with other materials.93–95 Recently, CPs have been composited with TMD nanosheets to be used in LIBs (Table 2).39,58,59,64,67,72,81,96 For instance, Yang and co-workers utilized hierarchical MoS2/PANi nanowires as the anode material for LIBs.64 The optimized MoS2/PANi nanocomposites showed greatly improved Li storage properties with a high charge capacity of 1063.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 10A), an excellent cycling behavior of 952.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles (Fig. 10B) and a good rate performance of 320 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 10C), making them a promising anode material for high-energy LIBs. In addition, as can be seen from the Nyquist plots of MoS2/PANi nanowires and MoS2 microparticles (Fig. 10D), the diameter of the semi-circle at high frequencies is remarkably reduced in the plot of MoS2/PANi, compared with that of bare MoS2 microparticles, indicating the greatly decreased charge-transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the combination with conductive PANi. In another report, Liu and co-workers designed sandwich-like SnS/polypyrrole ultrathin nanosheets.59 The as-made electrode showed a high charge specific capacity (1000 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), good rate performance (561 mA h g−1 at 5 C) and long cycle-life (703 mA h g−1 at 1 C for 500 cycles). Beyond MoS2, SnS2 nanosheets have also been composited with PANi as anodes for LIB with enhanced performances.39 The nanocomposite showed a high reversible capacity of 968.7 mA h g−1, which is higher than that of pure SnS2 sheets. Moreover, the SnS2/PANi nanoplates exhibited an excellent cyclability of 730.8 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles, corresponding to 75.4% of the initial reversible capacity. This impressive electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergic effect of the lamellar structured SnS2 and the conducting polymer PANi.

3.3 Sensing applications
Recently, 2D TMDs have been utilized as a sensing platform for electrochemical sensors due to their superior electrochemical activities and large surface area.97,98 However, the low conductivity of MoS2 nanosheets has imposed restrictions on its use as electrode materials for sensors. To overcome this limitation, hybridizing MoS2 nanosheets with other conducting materials such as conductive polymers have been investigated for sensitive and selective detection of analytical objectives ranging from small molecules to heavy metal ions and DNA.37,45,48,52,73–76,99 For example, Yang et al. demonstrated the simultaneous electrochemical detection of guanine and adenine using MoS2 and self-doped polyaniline (SPAN) nanocomposites.73 The obtained hybrid showed a high specific surface area, a large number of electroactive species, and open accessible space, accompanied by a rich negatively charged and special conjugated structure, which was applied to adopt positively charged guanine and adenine, based on their strong π–π* interactions and electrostatic adsorption. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 11A) demonstrated that in contrast to carbon paste electrodes (CPE), MoS2/CPE and SPAN/CPE, MoS2-SPAN/CPE exhibits a clear oxidation peak with the peak-to-peak potential separation of 141 mV. Furthermore, the electrochemical behaviors of 0.1 mmol L−1 adenine, guanine, and their mixture in a Britton–Robinson buffer solution (Fig. 11B and C) demonstrated that SPAN-MoS2/CPE exhibits the largest peak current. Moreover, it enables researchers to detect adenine and guanine simultaneously for the large enough peak-to-peak separation of about 296 mV (Fig. 11D). Compared to the electrochemical performance of solely MoS2 and SPAN, the improved electrochemical responses of guanine and adenine at the surface of the MoS2/SPAN were attributed to the synergistic effect between MoS2 and SPAN, which shows a linear range from 0.05 to 100 μmol L−1. Similarly, MoS2/SPAN modified electrodes were used for electrocatalytic determination of chloramphenicol75 and bisphenol A.74 In another report, Huang et al. developed an electrochemical sensor based on the MoS2/PANi composite and Au nanoparticles for the detection of dopamine in urine samples. The sensor exhibited good electrocatalytic activity towards oxidation of dopamine with a linear response range from 1 to 500 μM and a detection limit of 0.1 μM.45 Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the MoS2/PANi nanocomposite can act as a superior candidate for direct and label-free electrochemical DNA sensing.52 Gan and co-workers reported the construction of an electrochemical sensor for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of Cu2+ ions based on the HxTiS2/PANi nanocomposites.48 It was found that the incorporation of HxTiS2 nanosheets into the nanocomposites played three main roles: (1) it regulated the growth of PANi, (2) enhanced the electrode stability, and (3) improved the rates of interfacial electron transfer. The high selectivity was mainly derived from the coordination bond between Cu2+ and the N atoms of the imine groups of PANi. The high sensitivity was ascribed to the high conductivity of both HxTiS2 nanosheets and PANi.

In addition to the utilization of TMD/CP nanocomposites in electrochemical sensors, other types of sensors such as gas sensors and colorimetric sensors have also been developed. Recently, Lei and co-workers have reported colorimetric detection of H2O2 with a high sensitivity based on the intrinsic peroxidase-like property of the MoS2/PPy nanocomposite.85 This nanocomposite exhibited an excellent peroxidase-like catalytic activity toward the oxidation of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in acetate buffer solution (pH 4.0). The mechanism of enhanced catalytic activity may contribute to the synergistic effects between MoS2 and PPy components. Specifically, the photogenerated electrons excited by MoS2 under visible light irradiation will transfer from MoS2 sheets to the covered PPy, which effectively prevents the recombination of the electron–hole pairs. H2O2 is a good electron scavenger to form OH˙ on the surface of the nanocomposite, which largely enhanced the oxidation ability of TMB. Moreover, the MoS2/PANi composite has been reported to be used for mercury (Hg) vapor sensing.65 The sensor showed fast response and recovery to a wide range of concentrations of elemental mercury vapor and good selectivity over common gases like NO2, SO2, and NH3 in flue gas at room temperature. Such a resistive Hg sensor has exhibited attractive sensing performance, especially reduced response and recovery time, and long term stability.
3.4 Hydrogen evolution reaction
Recently, TMD nanosheets have been widely investigated and used as an active material for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to their promising properties, such as high surface area, more active sites and tunable bandgaps.100–103 The photocatalytic and electrocatalytic performance of TMD nanosheets for the HER can be further enhanced by hybridization with many other materials such as noble metals,104,105 carbonaceous materials,106,107 metal oxides108,109 and CPs.63,66,70 In particular, CPs can act as high-surface-area substrates to accommodate more TMD nanosheets with active sites in order to increase HER activity. In addition, using these conductive materials can facilitate electron transport for effective proton reduction. For example, Zhang and co-workers demonstrated integration of edge-rich MoS2 nanosheets with polyaniline nanofibers for effective electrochemical hydrogen evolution (Fig. 12).63 The hybrid MoS2/PANi composite possessed superior electrocatalytic activity toward HER in comparison with pure MoS2, pure PANi and physically mixed MoS2 and PANi (MoS2-PANi). A small Tafel slope of 45 mV per decade and a small onset overpotential of 100 mV were obtained for the MoS2/PANi nanocomposite. In addition, the nanocomposite showed a slight decay after 3000 cycles in current density suggesting the high electrochemical stability of MoS2/PANi. By providing abundant protonated sites in the close vicinity of active sites and demonstrating an excellent adsorption ability, PANi contributed significantly to the superior HER performance. In another report by Ding et al., MoS2 decorated PANi nanocomposites with different weight ratios of PANi were employed as an efficient catalyst for HER.70 The optimized MoS2/PANi hybrid catalyst with 19 wt% PANi exhibited excellent HER activity, i.e., 80 mA cm−2 cathodic current at 400 mV overpotential and a Tafel slope of 49 mV per decade were obtained. Moreover, the optimal MoS2/PANi nanocomposite showed impressive long-term stability after 500 cycles. The effective electron transport channels of PANi and the increase of electrochemically accessible surface area in composite materials mainly contributed to the high catalytic activity of MoS2/PANi nanocomposites. Besides electrocatalytic H2 evolution, MoS2 nanosheets hybridized with PANi for the photocatalytic HER have also been investigated recently. Liu and co-workers demonstrated that uniform vertical alignment of MoS2 nanosheets on the PANi substrate can contribute to the excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light.66 Uniform, dense and vertical alignment of MoS2 nanosheets provided a large amount of exposed active edge sites. On the other hand, utilization of conductive PANi improved the electron delivery efficiency.

3.5 Other applications
In addition to the aforementioned applications, TMD/CP nanocomposites have been utilized in other kinds of applications, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), thermoelectric applications and photodegradation. Intriguingly, it was demonstrated that the MoS2/PANi hybrid nanomaterial can be used for efficient adsorption/photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions.49 The flower-like MoS2 nanostructures provided larger specific surface area that can be coated with PANi to improve the adsorption capacity of the hybrid materials. On the other hand, the presence of amino and imine groups on PANi provided adsorption sites for Cr(VI) anions from aqueous solutions. As a result, under UV irradiation, Cr(VI) was adsorbed on MoS2/PANi and further reduced to Cr(III). Moreover, the TMD/CP nanocomposites have also been employed as a counter electrode (CE) catalyst in DSSCs with enhanced performance.82,83 As a typical example, Huang and co-workers reported successful utilization of MoSe2/PEDOT:PSS as a CE material. The DSSC device with a composite film having equal weights of MoSe2 and PEDOT:PSS gave a high power conversion efficiency of 7.58 ± 0.05%, which is only slightly lower compared to that of the Pt counter electrode (7.81 ± 0.03%). It has also been shown recently that TMD/CP nanocomposites are promising candidates for thermoelectric applications. The thermoelectric performance of a material can be described by using the figure of merit (ZT = (S2σT)/κ), where σ is the electrical conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficient, T is the absolute temperature and κ is the thermal conductivity. In principle, a thermoelectric material should possess a high σ, a remarkable S, and a low κ. CPs have been employed as organic polymer thermoelectric materials, as they can have a higher electrical conductivity than other organic polymers and a lower thermal conductivity than metals. However, the thermoelectric performance of organic materials is still limited by the low power factor (S2σ) compared with inorganic materials. In this regard, the incorporation of inorganic materials with high Seebeck coefficients is a great strategy to overcome the aforementioned problems. Recently, Ju and co-workers demonstrated the fabrication of SnSe/PEDOT:PSS composites with a maximum ZT of 0.32 at a SnSe nanosheet loading of 20 wt%.78 The dramatic improvement in the power factor of the composite samples with the SnSe nanosheet content is ascribed to the substantial increase in Seebeck coefficient compared with the reduction in electrical conductivity. Moreover, the Seebeck coefficient values were further enhanced, which may be due to the potential barriers formed at the interfaces between the PEDOT:PSS and SnSe materials. These results show an enhancement in the thermoelectric performance of the SnSe NS/PEDOT:PSS composite compared with the pristine PEDOT:PSS sample. In another report, Jiang and co-workers investigated the thermoelectric performance of nanocomposites made of liquid-exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets with PEDOT:PSS.79 The organic solvent-assisted exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet solution was found to play an important role in improving the thermoelectric performance of the PEDOT:PSS thin films. Common organic solvents such as DMF, NMP and water effectively removed some of the PSS during the formation of the film, resulting in significantly enhanced electrical conductivity for the PEDOT:PSS/MoS2 thin film. On the other hand, the introduction of MoS2 nanosheets in PEDOT:PSS led to a slight increase of the Seebeck coefficient from 14.5 to 19.5 μV K−1 without a significant reduction of the electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS/MoS2 thin film. An optimized power factor of 45.6 μW m−1 K−2 was achieved for the PEDOT:PSS/MoS2 thin film with 4 wt% MoS2 exfoliated in DMF solution.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, during the last few years, significant research efforts have been devoted to developing novel strategies for the fabrication of TMD/CP functional nanostructures. The resultant nanocomposites, with improved physical and chemical properties as compared to their individual counterparts, demonstrated outstanding performance in a wide range of applications, such as supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, hydrogen evolution reactions, sensing applications, and so on. Some interesting examples with enhanced performances have been emphasized, such as aligned arrays of PANi nanowires on MoS2 nanosheets for supercapacitors,36 hierarchical MoS2/PANi nanowires for lithium-ion batteries, and algae-like MoS2/PPy nanocomposites for H2O2 detection.
Although several studies have been carried out in this research area, there are still many challenges that must be addressed both in the basic understanding and in the rational fabrication of TMD/CP hybrid nanomaterials. The appealing features of TMD/CP nanocomposites do not solely depend on the intrinsic properties of the constructing components but also on the method of intelligent construction and hybridization of these composite nanomaterials. In this regard, developing advanced and simple synthetic approaches to construct TMD/CP nanocomposites in a controlled manner is highly desirable. In addition, most of the studies have focused on the hybridization of MoS2, as a representative of 2D TMDs, with PANi or PPy as the two most famous members of the CP family. Considering that both 2D TMD nanosheets and CP nanostructures constitute large families, the combination of other kinds of 2D TMDs, such as MoSe2, MoTe2, HfS2 and VSe2, with PANi, PPy and other members of the CP family to create state-of-the-art hybrid nanostructures for various applications offers an excellent opportunity.
