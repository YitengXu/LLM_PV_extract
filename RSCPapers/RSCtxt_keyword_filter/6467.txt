    , Accepted 11th September 2014First published on 11th September 2014AbstractThree new thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based organic dyes have been designed and synthesized for employment as DSSC sensitizers. Alternation of the electron poor thiazolothiazole unit with two propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) groups ensured very intense light absorption in the visible region (ε up to 9.41 × 104 M−1 cm−1 in THF solution). The dyes were particularly suitable for application in transparent and opaque thin-layer DSSCs (TiO2 thickness: 5.5–6.5 μm, efficiencies up to 7.71%), thus being good candidates for production of solar cells under simple fabrication conditions.
Since their discovery in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered a promising alternative to traditional silicon-containing photovoltaic devices. In a DSSC, the power conversion efficiency (η) is strongly dependent on the sensitizer, since the latter is involved in both the light absorption and charge transfer processes.2
Traditionally, the most efficient DSSCs were built with ruthenium complexes as sensitizers,2,3 but their performances have been surpassed thanks to the use of porphyrin-based dyes4 and, more recently, inorganic lead perovskites.5 Despite that, employment of organic dyes still offers some potential advantages, such as the possibility of avoiding the use of expensive and/or hazardous metals and the capability to harvest light efficiently due to their high molar extinction coefficients.6 Indeed, organic sensitizers were reported to give DSSCs with >11% efficiency,7 sometimes even coupled with excellent stability.8 Organic dyes with a superior light-absorption ability could be particularly useful for the sensitization of thin TiO2 layers,9 both for the development of solid-state solar cells10 and the construction of colored, transparent modules to be applied in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).11 In addition, the discovery of new sensitizers providing high efficiencies even under simple fabrication conditions, without deposition of multiple TiO2 layers, application of surface treatments or excessive use of additives, would be very important to reduce the current economic and environmental costs12 of DSSC technology, favoring its commercial exploitation. Therefore, with the aim of finding a class of sensitizers with the appropriate electronic and physico-chemical properties for application in thin-layer DSSCs, we started a thorough investigation targeting new organic D–π–A dyes endowed with innovative heterocyclic cores.
During such studies, we described for the first time sensitizers bearing a thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz) ring as their central unit,13,14 among which compound TTZ1 (Fig. 1) gave the best photovoltaic efficiency of 3.53% in the presence of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent.13 The relatively low η yielded by TTZ1 was likely due to a combination of factors, such as its insufficient light harvesting ability, its limited solubility and its tendency to form aggregates onto the TiO2 surface.

We reasoned that replacement of the hexylthiophene rings present in TTZ1 with more electronrich and less aromatic units should increase the HOMO energies of the resulting molecules, reducing their HOMO–LUMO gap and leading to a red-shift of their absorption spectra. Moreover, an improvement in light harvesting was also expected by alternating such moieties with the electronpoor TzTz and cyanoacrylic units.15 Finally, introduction of further alkyl chains on the sensitizer backbone was supposed to improve their solubility and reduce aggregation. Accordingly, we modified the dye scaffold by introducing two bis-pentyl propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) groups (TTZ3).16 In addition, to modulate the electronic properties of the dyes, we decided to decorate the donor unit with different electronrich substituents, namely hexyloxy and hexylthio groups (TTZ4,5). The structures of the new organic dyes are shown in Fig. 1.
The energy and shape of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of compounds TTZ3–5 were computed by means of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level17 (alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups to reduce computational effort). As an example, the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for dye TTZ5 are reported in Fig. 2 and compared with those previously found for dye TTZ1,13 while the FMOs for all new dyes are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

In line with our expectations, dyes TTZ3–5 showed smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps compared to TTZ1, mostly due to HOMO destabilization. Orbital shapes were similar in all cases, with the HOMO–1 distributed along the entire conjugated system and the HOMO and LUMO mostly localized on the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively. In addition, the absorption maxima (λamax), oscillator strengths (f) and vertical excitation energies (Eexc) for TTZ3–5 were also calculated by means of time-dependent DFT at the PCM/CAMB3LYP/6-31G* level (Table S1, ESI†).18,19 Results indicated that the new dyes should show intense absorptions with maxima above 500 nm, stemming from mixed HOMO → LUMO and HOMO − 1 → LUMO transitions.
Supported by the above computational data, we embarked on the synthesis of the new molecules (see Scheme S1, ESI†). First, we prepared the central heterocyclic unit by modification of our microwave-assisted thiazolothiazole synthesis,20 changing the solvent from nitrobenzene to n-butanol and adjusting the reaction time and temperature in order to improve substrate conversion and facilitate product isolation by column chromatography. After electrophilic iodination,13 two consecutive Suzuki cross-coupling reactions allowed the introduction of the donor and acceptor moieties. To minimize formation of the symmetrical double coupling products, in the first reaction a strictly stoichiometric amount of boronic reagent has to be used, and the reaction has to be stopped before full conversion of the starting material, resulting in low yields of products 4–6; nevertheless, in all cases a certain amount of unreacted diiodide 3 (30–66%) could be recovered after purification for later reuse. Furthermore, in the second coupling step, use of MW heating allowed to shorten reaction times, thus limiting the formation of byproducts (for example stemming from protodehalogenation processes). The synthesis was then completed by Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes 7–9 with cyanoacetic acid to give compounds TTZ3–5, which were fairly soluble in various organic solvents.
In THF solution, the new dyes showed broad and intense absorptions in the visible region (Fig. S2, ESI†) with maxima in the 510–518 nm range, red shifted of ca. 40 nm compared to TTZ1,13 and extremely high molar absorptivities, reaching up to 9.41 × 104 M−1 cm−1 in the case of TTZ5 (Table 1). Optical band gaps (E0-0), obtained from the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra in THF (Fig. S3, ESI†), were comprised in the 2.19–2.25 eV range. Attachment of the dyes to nanocrystalline TiO2 caused further broadening and a slight blue-shift of their absorption spectra, a phenomenon that was attributed to deprotonation of the carboxylic acid groups (Fig. S4, ESI†).21

The density of dyes attached to the semiconductor was measured via the desorption method, and was found to be slightly higher for TTZ5 compared to the other two sensitizers (up to 1.19 × 10−7 mol cm−2). Ground-state oxidation potentials (Eox), measured by means of cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S5, ESI†), were more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (+0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating possible regeneration of the sensitizers. Finally, excited state oxidation potentials, obtained from the expression Eox* = Eox − E0-0, are more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (approx. −0.5 V vs. NHE).
Photovoltaic performances of dyes TTZ3–5 were assessed by fabrication of thin-layer DSSCs, which differed only for the nature of the TiO2 layer employed. A first series of devices featured a transparent semiconductor layer with a thickness of 5.5 μm, while a second series of cells contained an opaque TiO2 layer with a thickness of 6.5 μm. In view of the possible practical application of thin-film DSSCs mentioned above, we kept device fabrication as simple as possible using only commercially available materials. In particular, different from other studies on thin-layer DSSCs,22,23 we did not perform any superficial treatment (e.g. treatment with aq. TiCl4) nor on the conductive substrate nor on the semiconductor layer, and we did not employ any light-scattering layer in the photoanode. In addition, we decided to use the I−/I3− redox couple, since that is the one that works best with ruthenium sensitizers and is therefore routinely used for BIPV applications.
For both types of devices, performances obtained with the new sensitizers were compared with those of standard organic dye D524 and Ru-based sensitizer Z907.25 Typical J/V curves obtained for the transparent devices are shown in Fig. 3a, together with the corresponding IPCE spectra (Fig. 3b), while the relevant photovoltaic parameters are reported in Table 2.

Transparent cells built with the new dyes gave efficiencies between 4.85% and 7.39%, with TTZ5, bearing a hexylthio-substituted triphenylamine moiety, being the best sensitizer. The sulphur-containing donor unit was introduced since it was reported to enhance dye regeneration and increase Voc compared to its oxygenated analogue,26 a result confirmed by our data (compare Voc of TTZ5 with that of TTZ4). On the other hand, the lower photocurrents measured for TTZ3-4 compared to TTZ5 could be caused either by the inferior light-harvesting ability of TTZ3 (lowest ε, λmax on TiO2 and Γ among all dyes) or by inefficient dye regeneration for TTZ4 (Eox less than 0.5 V higher than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple). Finally, the relatively low fill factors observed for all cells (59–63%) were likely due to the small thickness of the TiO2 layer in combination with the absence of a blocking layer, which probably favoured electron recombination between the conductive substrate and the electrolyte.
Remarkably, all new dyes gave higher efficiencies than standard organic dye D5, and compound TTZ5 even outperformed Ru-based sensitizer Z907 (η 7.39% vs. 5.51%). Such a result was particularly significant, since Z907 is one of the sensitizers of choice for applications in BIPV, thanks to its excellent oxidative and anchoring stability.27 All compounds gave broad IPCE spectra with onsets above 700 nm, in agreement with their UV-Vis spectra recorded on TiO2: in particular, the IPCE of dye TTZ5 was superior to Z907 in the 370–480 and 550–660 nm regions, consistent with its higher Jsc. The data obtained for opaque cells (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†) confirmed those seen for transparent devices, with TTZ5 being once again the best sensitizer (η 6.91%). In general, Voc and Jsc values were similar in the two classes of cells, but fill factors were slightly lower in opaque devices, likely due to differences in the TiO2 layer morphology.
To verify whether the bis-pentyl substituted ProDOT units, with their tri-dimensional arrangement of alkyl chains,16 were indeed effective in reducing dye aggregation, we also built two series of cells with the addition of 1 mM CDCA in the sensitizing bath (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). Interestingly, an increase in Jsc was observed in all cases, with TTZ3 showing the largest enhancement. This could be explained considering that TTZ3 lacks the terminal alkyl chains found in TTZ4,5, and should thus be more prone to aggregation (consistent with its lower solubility). More generally, η values varied by 4–21% in the presence of the co-adsorbent (Table 2), which was less than that previously observed with TTZ1,12 suggesting that in this case CDCA has a smaller impact on the dye aggregation state on TiO2. The best result was obtained when CDCA was used in TTZ5-containing opaque cells, providing an average efficiency of 7.71% with an impressive Jsc of 18.33 mA cm−2.
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized three new thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based organic dyes (TTZ3–5) with the aim of using them as sensitizers in thin-layer DSSCs (TiO2 thickness ≤ 6.5 μm). Gratifyingly, the new compounds displayed broad and intense absorption spectra in the visible region, with exceptional molar absorptivities up to 9.41 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Solar cells built with TTZ3–5, both transparent and opaque, gave good power conversion efficiencies (up to 7.71%), which in the case of TTZ5 were clearly superior to those obtained with standard Ru-dye Z907. Further studies are currently underway to gain insight into the charge transfer dynamics of dyes TTZ3–5, understand the origin of the superior performances recorded with TTZ5, prepare new and improved sensitizers and, finally, test the efficiency and stability of the corresponding DSSCs under optimized conditions.
