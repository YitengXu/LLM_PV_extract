R. China. E-mail: fqiang@nenu.edu.cn; zmsu@nenu.edu.cnReceived 14th June 2013, Accepted 16th August 2013First published on 19th August 2013AbstractThe advantages and disadvantages of a new anchor group 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodamine (DCRD) in D–π–A dyes for dye sensitized solar cells, compared with the commonly used anchor group cyanoacrylic acid (CA), were firstly investigated through DFT/TDDFT calculations on the dye/(TiO2)48/electrolyte interfacial electronic dynamics. It was found that the dissociative bidentate bridging mode is the most stable adsorption configuration on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface for DCRD. The calculated results indicate that in contrast to dyes with a CA group, the DCRD anchor group-based dye has a red-shifted absorption spectrum, which is beneficial for the enhancement of Jsc. However, the S atom in the DCRD group near the semiconductor surface has strong interactions with I2, which could lead to a higher I2 concentration in the vicinity of the dye-coated TiO2 surface, accelerating interfacial charge recombination. To avoid such shortcomings, a further optimization strategy for DCRD-based dyes was also proposed from a theoretical point of view. More importantly, we anticipate that dyes with the DCRD anchor group could show better performance in iodine-free redox shuttles-based DSSCs, in which the dye–I2 interaction could be avoided.1. IntroductionAs one of the most promising types of environmentally friendly photovoltaic device, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant interest due to their low cost, flexibility, easy fabrication and relatively high efficiency, since they were reported by O'Regan and Gräzel in 1991.1,2 Up to now, a record efficiency of 12.3% has been achieved by a donor–π–acceptor type zinc porphyrin sensitized cobalt-based solar cell.3 However, the efficiency is still lower than that of conventional Si-based solar cells, and further breakthroughs are still necessary for their commercial application.4There are mainly three components in a typical dye sensitized solar cell, namely, the sensitizer, the semiconductor oxide (TiO2), and the redox mediator. Although the optimization of each component could improve the performance of the cell,5 lots of research is focusing on the design and development of new sensitizers considering their key role in the cell.2,6–8 In general, two types of dye are used in DSSCs, they are ruthenium polypyridyl dyes and metal-free organic dyes. The most extensively studied organic dyes usually adopt a donor–π spacer–acceptor (D–π–A) structural motif, which exhibit several advantages over ruthenium dyes: high molar extinction coefficients, low cost of production, and extraordinary diversity. Despite various donor groups and π spacers being reported to get more efficient sensitizers, fewer acceptor groups have been explored and cyanoacrylic acid is still the most commonly used acceptor/anchor group.9–12 However, as we know, the acceptor group anchors the dye onto the semiconductor surface directly and plays a key role for dye anchoring, optical absorption, and electron-transfer processes. Exploring more efficient anchor groups is thus crucial to further enhance the performance of the cells.Recently, Tian et al.13 synthesized a series of novel D–π–A dyes with just different anchor/acceptor groups, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodamine (DCRD, 1) and cyanoacrylic acid (CA, 2), respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. They found that a 1-based cell shows a larger short-circuit current density (Jsc, 13.94 vs. 11.34 mA cm−2), smaller open-circuit photovoltage (Voc, 746 vs. 804 mV) and similar fill factor (FF, 0.68 vs. 0.70) in comparison to a 2-based cell. That is, the larger Jsc of a 1-based cell compensates for its smaller Voc, leading to an improved overall efficiency (7.11% vs. 6.39%) compared with the 2-based cell.13 To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported dyes with alternative electron acceptors showing higher efficiency than their commonly used cyanoacrylic acid counterparts. In addition, there is no computational study dealing with the adsorption configuration of a DCRD anchor group onto anatase (101) surfaces, which is the most stable surface for this material14 and one of those most frequently exposed in nanoparticles synthesized for solar cells,15 whereas the adsorption of the CA group has been systematically investigated in the past.16,17 These facts attract our significant interest in this new type of anchor group. How does this anchor group affect the performance of the dyes, especially the factors relating to the Jsc and Voc? In other words, the advantages, as well as the disadvantages, of DCRD compared to CA will be analyzed herein to speed up the further development of new anchor groups in the future. Fig. 1  Molecular structures of 1 and 2. 2. Computational detailsThe geometry optimization of the ground state of 1 and 2 in the gas phase were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.18 Frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory to confirm that the optimized geometry corresponds to a stationary point. Linear response TD-DFT calculations were performed with a polarizable continuum model (LR-PCM)19 under the CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G* level for simulating the absorption spectra of the isolated dyes in CH2Cl2 solution.20,21 In order to investigate the charge recombination dynamics, we need to optimize the dye–I2 complex, which is linked via weak interactions, i.e. halogen bonding.22,23 Although conventional functionals, such as the LDA (Local Density Approximation) and GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation) still fail to describe these noncovalent interactions accurately,24 it has been demonstrated that M06-2X (ref. 23) has excellent performance for the description of noncovalent interactions.25,26 Thus, the dye–I2 complex was optimized in the gas phase employing the M06-2X functional with a LanL2DZ (6-31G*) basis set for I (C, H, O, N, S) atoms. For dye–I2 interactions, the basis set superposition error (BSSE) to the binding energies were also done using the counterpoise method. The reliability of the used level of theory was proven in our previous works.27,28 All the calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package.29The (TiO2)48 cluster used to model the TiO2 nanoparticle effects was obtained by ‘cutting’ an anatase slab, exposing the majority (101) surface and is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Optimization of the dye-(TiO2)48 systems was performed by means of Siesta package.30–32 The charge displacement curves (CD) and density of states (DOS) profiles, implemented in Multiwfn,33,34 were also evaluated to analyze the electron density change during the formation of dye-TiO2 adducts and to extract information on the energetic position of the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2, respectively. Computational details for the dye-(TiO2)48 optimization, CD and DOS are described in detail in the ESI.†3. Results and discussionThe power conversion efficiency (η) of the cell was determined by the product of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), as follows:35 (1)where Is is the intensity of the incident light. Apparently, factors affecting the Jsc, Voc, and FF could influence the η of the cell.The short-circuit current density, Jsc, is defined as:36 (2)where LHE(λ), the light harvesting efficiency at wavelength λ, is given by LHE(λ) = 1–10−f, and f is the oscillator strength. The electron injection efficiency from the photo-excited dye into TiO2, Φinj, is closely related to the injection driving force, ΔGinj, which is determined by the difference between the oxidation potential of the excited dye and the conduction band edge of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.0 eV).37 The regeneration efficiency of the oxidized dye, ηreg, is related to the regeneration driving force, ΔGreg, defined as the difference between the oxidation potential of the ground state of the dye and the redox potential of I−/I3− (−4.58 eV).38 Islam et al. have confirmed practically that when the ΔGinj is larger than 0.2 eV, the Φinj tends to unit efficiency.39 Also, ηcoll is the charge collection efficiency, in close connection with the properties of electrodes. As we know, besides these properties at a fixed wavelength, the matching degree between the sensitizer absorption spectrum and the solar photon flux spectrum is also an important parameter affecting the Jsc.40The open-circuit photovoltage, Voc, is determined by the difference between the quasi Fermi level in TiO2 (EF) under illumination and the redox potential of the redox couple (Eredox), as follows:41 (3)where Ec is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor, nc is the free carrier density in the conduction band, and NCB is the accessible density of the conduction band states (7 × 1020 cm−3).42kT and q are constants, representing the thermal energy and the unit charge, respectively. It seems like the Voc is determined by the semiconductor and the redox couple. However, in a real device, the adsorbed molecules could induce the shift of Ec, and nc is also affected by the electron injection and charge recombination, which could be varied by different sensitizers.On the basis of eqn (1)–(3), it is obvious that the sensitizer is really an important component in the DSSC, since it could influence the Jsc and Voc through affecting the LHE, Φinj, ηreg, Ec and nc. Thus, in the following the advantages and disadvantages of 1 with a new anchor group compared to 2 will be characterized and discussed based on these factors.3.1 Anchor group effects on the key factors influencing JscAs discussed above, we know that the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), the electron injection rate (Φinj) and the regeneration rate (ηreg) of the dyes are critical factors directly related to the Jsc, as shown in eqn (1). In order to evaluate the LHE, we first calculated the absorption spectra of these two dyes (shown in Fig. S2†). The calculated maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), oscillator strengths (f), transition natures, electron density difference maps corresponding to S0 → S1 and the available experimental results from ref. 13 are summarized in Table 1. We found that the calculated λmax are in good agreement with the experimental results with discrepancies of 0.1–0.2 eV. Although 1 has a slightly larger f, both 1 and 2 show similar LHE values. More importantly, we found that 1 has a red-shifted absorption spectrum relative to 2 (about 20 nm), leading to a better matching between the absorption spectrum and solar photon flux spectrum, which is beneficial for the enhancement of Jsc. The electron density difference maps of 1 and 2 corresponding to S0 → S1 in CH2Cl2 solution, plotted by GaussSum,43 demonstrated that after the photoexcitation, there will be intramolecular charge transfer, which would be beneficial for the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2.

Thus we could predict that the change of the anchor group could modulate the Edye*, rather than the Edye. The calculated results collected in Table 2 confirmed this. From the calculated ΔGinj (ΔGinj = Edye* − ECB)44 and ΔGreg (ΔGreg = Eredox – Edye),46 we found both dyes have sufficient driving force for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration. Thus, it is safe to make the conclusion that for these two dyes with different anchor groups, the comparable electron injection process, dye regeneration process and light harvesting efficiency are not the decisive factors affecting the Jsc, while the red-shifted absorption spectrum could contribute to the increase of Jsc for 1.

Considering that the unsaturated five-fold coordinated Ti atoms (5c-Ti) and two-fold coordinated O atoms (2c-O) present on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface are generally believed to be the chemically active sites, and both the O and N atoms of the DCRD anchor group could bond with the 5c-Ti atom, thus six possible adsorption modes for 1, either molecular or dissociative, were considered using a dye-(TiO2)48 cluster model, as depicted schematically in Fig. 3. Configurations D1 to D3 are dissociative adsorption modes, with the proton transferred to the adjacent 2c-O atom on the surface. Both N and O atoms coordinate with the 5c-Ti atoms in modes D1 and D2 with different directions. For D3, apart from the O–Ti bond, a hydrogen bond was also present. Configurations M1 to M3 are the corresponding molecular adsorption modes. Fig. 3  Possible adsorption configurations for 1 on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface. After optimization of the initial structure of the dye-(TiO2)48 systems with the Siesta package, we got only five adsorption modes. It should be noted that for the initial modes D3 and M3, the same structure with a molecular adsorption mode was obtained upon optimization. To determine the most stable configuration, the adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated as following: Eads = E[dye-TiO2] − E[TiO2] − E[dye](4)where E[dye-TiO2] is the energy of the dye-TiO2 complex, and E[TiO2] and E[dye] are the energies of the isolated dye and the bare TiO2 with the adsorption geometry, respectively. Computational details about how to calculate Eads are described in the ESI.† The Eads and specific interatomic distances (Å) are listed in Table 3. We found that the deprotonated modes are more stable than the molecular ones due to the larger Eads. For the two dissociative modes D1 and D2, both the N and O atoms in the DCRD group chelate with the Ti atom in the semiconductor, and D1 shows a larger Eads than D2. For D1, the O–Ti and N–Ti interatomic distances are 1.93 and 2.23 Å, in line with the conclusions of Meng et al.6

As stated by De Angelis and his coworkers, the sensitizer adsorption can evoke a variance of the conduction band energy of the semiconductor (ΔECB), and thus further change the Voc of the cell for a defined redox shuttle in DSSCs.49 As a result, we will first discuss how these two dyes with different anchor groups affect the ΔECB during the sensitizer adsorption. As for the adsorption mode for 2 with a carboxylic anchor group, since in the previous experimental studies, it has been demonstrated that the carboxylic acid group is deprotonated (–COO−) after adsorption using infrared Fourier transform (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.50,51 Furthermore, theoretical calculations also demonstrated that the bidentate bridging adsorption mode is more stable than the monodentate adsorption mode for dissociative adsorption in the solution,48 while Vittadini et al.52 demonstrated that the bidentate chelating mode is an unstable binding mode, thus only the bidentate bridging adsorption was taken into consideration in this study. The optimized 2-(TiO2)48 and the most stable 1-(TiO2)48 system are shown in Fig. 4 (other optimized configurations for 1 are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI†). In order to get ΔECB, we evaluated the Density of States (PDOS) profiles on TiO2 for the dye-TiO2 systems, shown in Fig. 5 and S4,† and details about how to get ΔECB are described in the ESI.† The assessed ΔECB for 1 and 2 are 0.222 and 0.245 eV, respectively, implying that the larger Voc of 2 is partially due to its slightly larger ΔECB. How does the molecular structure affect the ΔECB? Two effects could be at work to induce the shift of the CB when sensitizers adsorb on the semiconductor, one is the charge transfer (CT) from the sensitizer to the semiconductor during dye-TiO2 bonding, and the other is the electrostatic effect (VEL), as discussed by De Angelis et al.49 The calculated CT through a Charge Displacement (CD) curve (shown in Fig. S5 and S6 in ESI†) and the VEL are summarized in Table 4 (for details about the CD curve and VEL analysis see the ESI†). The results indicate that the anchor group has effects both on the CT and VEL. Although 1 has a few more electrons transferred from the sensitizer to the semiconductor, it has a smaller VEL, and finally it seems that the VEL has more significant effects on the ΔECB, thus leading to the decreased ΔECB for 1.

Apart from the sensitizer adsorption effects on the ΔECB, which could influence the Voc of the cell, it is well known that the charge recombination process in the solar cell also plays a very important role in cell performance, as it could affect the electron density in the TiO2 and also cause a fluctuation of the titania conduction band edge.53,54 It is commonly accepted that the special atoms in the sensitizer, such as S and O, could provide the sites for dye–I2 interactions through halogen bonding,22,55 which could accelerate the charge recombination process through changing the concentration of the electron acceptor I2 near the semiconductor surface, while the closer the binding site to the semiconductor surface, the faster the charge recombination.56 At first glance, this new anchor group DCRD seems to introduce an additional interaction site, as compared to the CA group. The interaction energy shown in Fig. 6 indicates that this S atom in the DCRD group does interact with I2, and the interaction energy is comparable to the S atom in the thiophene group. More importantly, this binding site is closer to the semiconductor surface, which could lead to a higher I2 concentration in the vicinity of the dye coated TiO2 surface, and thus result in the accelerated interfacial charge recombination. In a word, the S atom in the DCRD group provides a competing charge recombination site, leading to the decrease of Voc. It should be pointed out that besides the charge recombination mentioned above, the injected electrons in the conduction band could also be recaptured by the oxidized dye in principle. However, the high concentration of the redox couple in the electrolyte and the 3 orders of magnitude faster dye regeneration rate leads to the low concentration of oxidized dyes,57 this charge recombination process is thus usually not the dominant recombination route.58,59 Fig. 6  Optimized molecular structures of the dye–I2 adducts and the corresponding interaction energies. 3.4 Further optimizationFrom the above analysis, we could clearly see the dye with the DCRD anchor group has superior light-harvesting properties compared with the CA-based dye. However, the S atom in the DCRD group, which is close to the semiconductor surface, could also speed up the charge recombination due to the S–I2 interaction, decreasing the Voc of the cell. As a result, if the dye–I2 interaction determining the extent of the charge recombination could be retarded or avoided, this new anchor group (DCRD) could present a much better performance than the CA-based dyes. To this end, we designed compound 3, shown in Fig. S7,† in which the S atom in the DCRD group was replaced with an O atom, because previous experimental research has demonstrated that the two ruthenium(II) sensitizers with only two-atom changes in the structure (a change of an oxygen to sulfur in two equivalent positions) could show a different charge recombination rate (the replacement of oxygen by sulfur alone causes a 2-fold increase in the recombination rate constant), which was ascribed to the different abilities in binding iodine.60 Is this strategy also suitable for our system? We therefore calculated the binding energies of S–I2 and O–I2, as listed in Fig. 7, to confirm our proposal. As seen from Fig. 7, an S atom has a much larger binding ability than an O atom in the DCRD group with I2, thus dyes with an O-DCRD group were expected to have slower charge recombinations compared with the S-DCRD dyes. This finding was also confirmed by the experimental measurements on the iodine binding constant of ethylether and ethylthioether, being ∼6 and ∼200 L mol−1, in n-heptane, at 20 °C, respectively.61,62 The caveat we have to mention here is that it is more reasonable to optimize the dye–I2 interaction, rather than the five-number-heterocyclic–I2 interaction. However, due to the stronger binding ability of the S site of thiophene than the O site of DCRD in 3, the optimized geometry for the dye (O site)–I2 complex could not be obtained. Thus, we think it is reasonable to only consider this five-number-heterocyclic–I2 interaction to qualitatively analyze the binding ability of O and S atoms with I2. Fig. 7  Optimized molecular structures of the molecular-I2 adducts and the corresponding interaction energies, where yellow atom is S and red atom is O. Besides the extent of charge recombination, other key factors, such as LHE, electron injection, dye regeneration and ΔECB caused by the sensitizer adsorption, were all investigated in the following to evaluate the effects of this chemical modification on the dye performance. Thus the electronic absorption spectra of 1 and 3 were calculated and shown in Fig. 8. The strongest absorption peaks for 3 also arise from S0 → S1, which mainly correspond to the promotion of an electron from HOMO to LUMO, and the frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI.† Although, 3 has a slightly lower f than that of 1 (1.286 for 3 and 1.444 for 1), the calculated LHEs of 1 and 3 have a negligible difference (0.96 for 1 and 0.95 for 3). Moreover, from the calculated results, we know that the maximum absorption wavelengths of both dyes are identical, implying that these two dyes have comparable degrees of matching between the absorption spectrum and solar photon flux spectrum. Moreover, the ground state (−5.11 eV) and the excited state oxidation potential (−2.52 eV) also demonstrated that 3 satisfies the fundamental requirement for efficient sensitizers to ensure the electron injection and dye regeneration. At last, the ΔECB of 3 only decreased slightly in comparison with that of 1 (0.222 eV for S-DCRD and 0.216 eV for O-DCRD) (see Fig. S9 in the ESI†). Thus, we could expect that the O-DCRD-based cells could show improved performance, as compared with the S-DCRD-based cells, due to the remarkably decreased charge recombination. Fig. 8  The calculated absorption spectra of the free organic dyes with different anchor groups in CH2Cl2 solution at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G*//B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. On the other hand, we could also anticipate that DCRD could be used in the iodine-free based solar cells to avoid the accelerated charge recombination induced by the DCRD(S)–I2 interaction compared with CA-based dyes, while keeping its advantages in the light harvesting. Moreover, the higher Voc of the cell can in principle be achieved by using a redox shuttle with a lower redox potential, lots of redox shuttles with different redox potentials have been developed, especially for a Co-complex-based electrolyte, using which the record efficiency of 12.3% has been achieved.3 Wang et al. have also demonstrated that the difference of Voc, which is induced by the different extent of the dye–I2 interaction of two sensitizers, could be avoided in Co-complex-based solar cells, while the Jsc almost did not change with different redox shuttles.38 Although a redox shuttle with a lower potential could lead to a higher Voc in principle, the driving force for dye regeneration should be taken into consideration. The driving force should be enough no matter what redox shuttle is used. For the dyes under investigation, when the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle (−4.81 eV) was used,38 these dyes all had enough driving force (−0.33 eV for 1, −0.35 eV for 2 and −0.30 eV for 3) to ensure the dye regeneration. Thus, we believe that when 1 with a DCRD anchor group was used in the cobalt-based solar cells, it should show much better performance than 2 with a CA group, because the shortcomings of DCRD could be avoided efficiently, while the advantages could be retained.4. ConclusionsA theoretical investigation on a sensitizer with a new anchor group, i.e. 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodamine (DCRD), has been firstly presented to shed light on its strengths and weaknesses, in comparison with the widely and commonly used cyanoacrylic acid (CA) acceptor/anchor group. After establishing the most stable adsorption mode of DCRD on the TiO2 (101) surface, factors relating to the short-circuit current density and open-circuit photovoltage were studied in detail through dye/(TiO2)48/electrolyte interfacial electronic dynamics. The results revealed that 1 with the DCRD group shows a red-shifted absorption spectrum compared with that of 2 with a CA group, enhancing the overlap between the solar photon flux spectrum and the sensitizer's absorption spectrum. However, one more interaction site (S atom) in the DCRD group also has strong interactions with the main electron acceptor I2 in the electrolyte near the semiconductor surface, resulting in the higher I2 concentration in the vicinity of the dye-coated TiO2 surface, and thus the more accelerated interfacial charge recombination. Thus our theoretical investigations indicate that the DCRD anchor group is a promising alternative to the conventional CA group for dye sensitized solar cells with an iodine-free redox mediator. Moreover, as for the iodine redox mediator, a further optimization strategy for DCRD, which could, not only make full use of the advantages of DCRD, but also significantly slow down the recombination rate, was proposed through tiny structure modification.AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from 973 Program (2009CB623605), NSFC (20903020, 21131001, 21273030, 21203019 and 21203020), SRFDP and RGC ERG Joint Research Program (20120043140001) and the Science and Technology Development Planning of Jilin Province (201201071 and 201201067)ReferencesB.
