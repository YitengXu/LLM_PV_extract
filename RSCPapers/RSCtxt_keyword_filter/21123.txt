    , Accepted 26th March 2021First published on 27th March 2021AbstractTwo new di-acceptors metal-free organic dyes based on indolo[3,2-b]indole donor backbone with extra electron donors were designed, synthesized, and applied for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In this study, the effect of the additional donors was investigated by the replacement of the typical N-alkyl side chain using methoxyphenyl (dye 1) and hexyloxyphenyl (dye 2) as secondary donor groups. Molecular dyes-based di-anchoring models enhanced the significant interaction between sensitizing dyes and the TiO2 surface as well as yielded better light-harvesting efficiency, compared to the familiar core indolo-indole donor. Under global standard condition 1.5 AM, dye 2-based cells show an enhanced overall conversion efficiency of 7.86% while that of the standard commercial N719-based cells is 8.08%. Therefore, the double anchor indolo[3,2-b]indole with additional donors is a promising candidate for efficient DSSCs.
1. Introduction
The economic expansion in 21st century gave rise to some global challenges such as environmental crisis and severe energy insecurity. The utilization of renewable energy sources has become one of the most important and necessary scientific and technological advancements.1 Since the pioneering report of Grätzel in 1991,2 the study of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has received steadily growing interest from both academia and industries as an alternative to conventional inorganic silicon-based solar cells due to their low material cost, relatively simple production, up-scaling capability, and environment friendliness.3,4
The traditional metal-free organic sensitizers generally consist of the D–π–A motif, where D is the electron-donating group, π is the conjugated linker, and A is the electron-accepting group.5 Of all components, the electron acceptor (A) or the anchoring group plays a critical role in the binding energy between the sensitizing dye and the TiO2 surface, which in turn affects the long-term stability of the dye and the efficient electron injection rate from the dye to the current-collecting substrate.6,7 For ruthenium complex-based dyes, increasing the number of anchoring groups has been found to result in better performance8–12 than the mono anchor.13
According to prior reports from several research groups including our study, multi-anchored sensitizers exhibit great potential and offer advantages over their congener with a single anchor, such as higher dye loading and better electron injection and/or dark current suppression efficiencies (higher Voc and/or Jsc values).14–20 The A–D–A architecture exhibited the highest photovoltaic performance compared to other derivatives with mono electron-accepting group.20 Therefore, in this study, the A–D–A-based structure was chosen as a platform for molecular design to further enhance the photoconversion efficiency (Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 1  (a) The molecular architecture of the previous20 and new organic dyes with two acceptors and two extra electron donors; (b) the new metal-free sensitizers 1 and 2 with 5,10-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]indole-based donor and di-acceptors approach. 
In a typical organic framework (D–π–A or D–A–π–A), the alteration of the π-spacer has generally received much attention.21 Diverse new structures have been synthesized and introduced to target molecules as the π-conjugated bridge to obtain better photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, the study on the effect of the electron-donating group and the double electron-accepting group on the cell performance has scarcely been reported.
Up to the present, only a few structures have been employed as electron-donor (D) units, for instance, triphenylamine,22–26 carbazole,27–30 and anthracene.31,32 Among those, triphenylamine-based architecture is the most commonly used as the D moiety due to its good electron-donating ability and facile synthetic method.33,34 Nevertheless, several drawbacks still remain in that the triphenylamine geometry can decrease the degree of conjugation within molecules and allow for free-rotation, which leads to energy dissipation, all of which lead to the poor efficiency of DSSC. Based on these considerations, a number of electron donors with fully planar geometry structures such as carbon-based donors (e.g., perylene35) and heterocyclic-based donors (e.g., the sulfur-containing compound indacenodithiophene (IDT),36–38 the nitrogen-containing compound indolo[2,3-b]carbazole,39 indeno[1,2-b]indole,40 indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline,41 as well as the mixed-heteroatomic compound S,N-heteroacene42) were rationally developed to optimize the characteristics of dyes for the DSSC performance. Although some investigations related to the different types of donor moiety were previously reported, studies and the efficiency of organic solar cells with unique donor units are not nearly enough in the era of energy conversion.
In this study, we introduced the fully planar fused-ring scaffold containing desirable properties of the DSSC donors, including excellent electron-donating capacity and high thermal stability.43–45 Among various types of metal-free organic sensitizers, the heteroaromatic type, specifically the indole derivative, is considered as one of the sensible choices capable of associating fused-ring structure, which is crucial for dye properties.46–51 Thus, the linear, planar structure of indolo[3,2-b]indole was chosen as a parent scaffold for further modification. To suppress π–π stacking between the molecules, the N,N′-positions can be factionalized by either alkyl or aryl group. Furthermore, in addition to its role as a physical spacer, the high electron density of the indolo[3,2-b]indole scaffold also provides electron-donating or π-conjugation properties to the molecular sensitizer (Fig. 1).52
As described above, the organic sensitizers consisting of double acceptors (dye 1 and dye 2) were rationally designed to improve the photoconversion efficiency. In the structures of these dyes, a fused N-heteroaromatic indolo[3,2-b]indole functions as a π-conjugation system and a self-electron donor, cyanoacrylic acid provides strong electronic coupling to the electron acceptor,53 and the incorporated aryl moieties serve as additional donors, as shown in Fig. 1b. The extra-donor methoxyphenyl (dye 1) and hexyloxyphenyl (dye 2) moieties were installed in the core-structure at the N,N′-position to further investigate the additional donors’ effect on the A–D–A dyes. It was envisioned that the embedded anisole-based moieties (methoxyphenyl and hexyloxyphenyl) would facilitate the electron-donating ability from the donor to the-acceptor groups, contributing to the hydrophobic environment in the device architecture and suppressing dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface.
Hence, the new metal-free sensitizers, dyes 1 and 2, were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. The fully-characterized photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties, as well as the energy bandgap of the new synthetic compounds were also systematically investigated in this work.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and instruments
All 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured using Bruker AV 400 MHz NMR spectrometers. All the NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-d6, or DMSO-d6, where the chemical shifts are expressed in ppm relative to the internal standard TMS or the residual non-deuterated solvent peak. The ESI-TOF MS spectra of all the compounds were measured using a Bruker micrOTOF mass spectrometer and HRMS MALDI-TOF mass analysis was performed on a Bruker Autoflex Speed using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. UV/Vis absorption spectra were documented on a Cary 60 UV/Vis (Agilent Technologies) spectrophotometer in a spectrograde solvent. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were determined by Autolab PGSTA101. CV experiments were conducted with a three-electrode system using glassy carbon as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The redox potential was studied in DMSO solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte and the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox system as an internal standard. The infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Frontier FT-IR spectrometer. All chemical reagents used in this work were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Solvents were distilled before use in reactions. Dry and oxygen-free tetrahydrofuran (THF) was freshly distilled from sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen. All air-sensitive reactions were carried out under inert atmospheric pressure using degassed solvents. Merck silica gel 60H and Merck silica gel 60 PF254 were employed for column chromatography and preparative thin-layer chromatography, respectively.
2.2 Fabrication of DSSCs
To prepare the photoanode, the TiO2 nanoparticle (18NR-T, Dyesol) was screen-printed onto the prepared surface of the fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glasses (15 Ω sq−1, TEC15, Pilkington). The coating was repeated until a desired thickness of ∼9 μm was obtained. After that, additional ∼3 μm of mesoporous TiO2 (WER2-O, Dyesol) was screened onto the initial transparent layer, resulting in a double nanostructure thick film (transparent scattering layers of ∼12 μm in thickness), according to the previous procedure.53 To get rid of any organic binder in the paste and fuse all the coated TiO2, the electrode was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The resulting photoanode was then immersed in the dye solution for another 12 h for sensitization. The unabsorbed dyes were removed by rinsing with appropriate solvents, resulting in the dye absorbed cell as the monolayer. The Pt counter electrode was prepared using predrilled 8 Ω sq−1, TEC8, FTO glass (Pilkington). The Pt precursor (H2PtCl6 solution) was dropped onto the cleaned FTO surface and was then annealed at 450 °C for 15 min.
To assemble all the components into a DSSC device, both electrodes were joined and sealed using a heat press to apply the sealing film Meltonix 1170-25 film (25 μm thickness, Solaronix) between the two electrodes. Then, the redox mediator, which consists of 0.05 M of iodine (I2), 0.1 M of lithium iodide (LiI), 0.4 M of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.6 M of tetrabutylammonium iodide (TPAI) in a mixture of acetonitrile:veleronitrile (85:15 V/V), was filled through the pre-drilled hole on the electrode using the vacuum filling method. After the electrolyte was filled, the hole was quickly sealed with a heated sealing film and topped with a thin glass to prevent electrolyte leakage. Finally, silver paint was spread onto both the working and counter electrodes to reduce the Ohmic contract resistance between the surfaces and to ensure electrical contraction with the measuring cable, such as a copper wire.
Solar cells were fabricated by coating the organic dyes 1 and 2 on the TiO2 surface as sensitizers, and N719 as a standard benchmark for comparison. The synthetic dyes' photovoltaic performances were investigated under the standard AM 1.5G condition (100 mW cm−2) and the active area was controlled using a 0.25 cm2 mask.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of dyes
Dyes 1 and 2 were prepared in 4 steps (Scheme 1). Compounds 4 and 5 were obtained from the same donor (indolo[3,2-b]indole, 1), which is consistent with a synthetic sequence reported previously.52 The core structures were then functionalized via Ullmann cross-coupling reaction, followed by a bromination reaction to provide compounds 4 and 5 in 98% and 97% yields, respectively. The following bromination reaction of compounds 4 and 5 employing NBS provided bromine adducts 6 (38% yield) and 7 (70% yield), respectively. The formyl group was introduced into their corresponding compounds by lithium–halogen exchange, followed by formylation to yield compound 8 in 84% yield and compound 9 in 70% yield. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of 8 and 9 (cyanoacetic acid and piperidine in the presence of molecular sieve (4 Å) in refluxing anhydrous THF) provided dye 1 (34% yield) and dye 2 (56% yield), respectively.
3.2 Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of dyes 1 and 2 were studied using UV/Vis spectroscopic and fluorescence emission measurements. The results were summarized in Table 1.

The absorption spectra of the dyes were measured at room temperature in methanol (∼10−5 M), as shown in Fig. 2a. According to the UV/Vis spectral pattern, both the dyes provided a similar absorption profile because of their identical conjugated-donor backbone. Two main distinction regions were found: one was assigned as the π–π* transition (334–462 nm) and another was assigned as an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor indolo[3,2-b]indole and acceptor cyanoacrylic acid (440–566 nm). The maximum intensity peak of the π–π* transition was found at 396 nm for dye 1 and 408 nm for dye 2. The absorption at maximum wavelength λmax of the corresponding dyes was obtained to be 463 and 483 nm with the relative molar extinction coefficients of 0.86 and 0.84 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively.54,55 In particular, dye 2 exhibited a slightly red-shifted pattern from dye 1 (20 nm), which can be beneficial for photon capture over extended areas of the spectra.56 Moreover, the experimental absorption spectra are consistent with those obtained from the time-dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT).57 The π–π* transition, as well as the ICT band of dye 2, showed a bathochromic shift when compared with dye 1. These peaks (π–π* and ICT) exhibited strong allowed transitions, as verified by the high oscillator strengths (f) of more than 0.1 (see in ESI,† Table S1).

In addition, the fluorescence emission spectra of the dyes were investigated in methanol (∼10−6 M) using the excitation wavelength of their corresponding maxima of absorption (Fig. 2b). Both dyes showed a single characteristic emission peak in the region of 488–715 nm. From the normalized emission data, Fig. 2b and Table 1, the λem of dye 2 (586 nm) was slightly longer than that of dye 1 (571 nm), which might be the result of the significant number of hydrocarbon chains on different donor groups, suggesting less energy loss upon photoexcitation.54 Moreover, the emission data also show that the Stokes shift of dye 2 (178 nm) is more pronounced than that of dye 1 (175 nm), indicating more flexibility of the conformational structure in the excitation state and efficient donor-to-acceptor electron transfer, which is critical for the light-harvesting of solar cells.58,59
To figure out the device's light-harvesting ability, the solid-state dye absorptions were measured. The spectra were recorded from the absorbed analogous dyes on the TiO2 surface. Based on the absorption spectra in Fig. 2c, the bathochromic shifts were observed for both dyes 1 and 2 in the solution phase, providing the broadening absorption peaks. As shown in Fig. 2c, the λmax for the π–π* transition of dyes 1 and 2 on TiO2 were slightly shifted to longer wavelengths, while the ICT bands were red-shifted by 50 nm and 24 nm, respectively. In comparison with the absorption peak for the solution phase, the broadening peaks and red-shifted spectra can be ascribed to J-aggregation on the TiO2 surface.54 This aggregation type can be readily formed in the system containing carboxyl anchoring (dyes) and titanium ions (semiconductor) preceding the enlarged electron delocalization of the molecular dye, thereby reducing the overall energy of the antibonding π* orbital.58,60
The cyclic voltammetry data are summarized in Table 2. The potential values were calibrated with internal standard ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) and the first oxidation potential (Eonset) was determined from the intersection of the tangents between the baseline and the current signal.61 The potential values obtained versus Fc+/Fc were converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by adding a constant of 0.63 V. Therefore, the ground-state potential (EHOMO) of all the dyes were converted from Eonset using the equation EHOMO (V) = Eonset (V) + 0.63.62,63 The excited-state potential ELUMO energy levels were calculated by subtracting the corresponding EHOMO from the optical band gap (E0–0). As summarized in Table 2, the EHOMO values of dye 1 and dye 2 were estimated to be 1.03 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (see ESI,† Fig. S1), which were more positive than the redox potential of iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) (0.4 V vs. NHE).64 The lower absolute value of the HOMO level ensured sufficient driving force of the oxidized dyes to trap electrons from a redox mediator. Besides, the energy band gap of dye 2 was slightly lower than that of dye 1 as a consequence of longer aliphatic side chains that induce more electron density of the structure. Nonetheless, the higher absolute value of the LUMO level relative to the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE) also offers a driving force for electron injection from both the dyes.65

To investigate the thermodynamic processes that occurred at the dye/electrolyte/semiconductor interfaces, the feasibility of dye injection (ΔGinj), recombination (ΔGrec), and regeneration (ΔGreg) processes was investigated. The energy changes were formulated using eqn (1)–(3), where ECB is the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), EI3−/I− is the redox potential of the electrolyte (0.4 V vs. NHE), EOX is the HOMO energy level, and EOX* is the LUMO energy level, the results of which are summarized in Table 2.59 ΔGinj = EOX* − ECB(1) ΔGrec = ECB − EOX(2) ΔGreg = EI3−/I− − EOX(3)
From the calculation, as shown in Table 2, all of the ΔG values were negative, suggesting thermodynamically spontaneous processes. The calculated recombination values of both the dyes 1 and 2 were found to be −1.53 eV. Similarly, both dyes yielded −0.63 eV for the electron regeneration due to their equivalent HOMO energy levels. The results of ΔGrec and ΔGreg showed that both the dyes had sufficient and equivalent driving forces for their electron regeneration processes to prevent electron recombination between the oxidized dye and the injected electrons.60 Moreover, the calculated Gibbs free energy for the electron injection of dye 1 (−0.76 eV) was higher than that of dye 2 (−0.67 eV), indicating more efficient electron injection of dye 1 to the conduction band of TiO2. Even though the absorption spectra and ΔG of electron injection seem to favor dye 1 over dye 2, other essential factors such as the morphology of active materials, the dye-loading capacity of the working electrode, as well as the optical energy band gap of the dye still need to be taken into account.
3.3 Performance of DSSCs
To evaluate the potential of the dyes for the DSSC performance, the photovoltaic tests of both the dyes were conducted. The J–V characteristics curves and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) spectra were plotted and are shown in Fig. 3a and b. Likewise, the obtained open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (η) are summarized in Table 3. The prepared cells (0.25 cm2 of the active area with the thickness of ∼12 μm) were immersed into the prepared dye solutions (∼0.2 mM) and left for 12 h to allow for dye adsorption on the TiO2 films.

According to the results, all devices exhibited satisfying power conversion efficiencies (PCE) ranging from 5.20% to 7.86%. As listed in Table 3, under the global standard condition 1.5 AM, dye 2 yielded high solar-to-device performance with a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 17.04 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 718 mV, a fill factor (FF) of 0.64, and the corresponding overall conversion efficiency (η) of 7.86%. Dye 2 exhibited better efficiency in comparison with various organic dyes in the same-indole class.66,67 In contrast to dye 2, DSSC of dye 1 showed lower η value of 5.20%. Although the sensitizer with methoxyphenyl, dye 1, earned a lower PCE value relative to dye 2, its performance is still superior to the more familiar structure with only one accepting group.20 This indicates that the customization of non-planar bulky auxiliary donors together with the A–D–A structure can promote better photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs. We note that under the same conditions, the standard reference cell based on N719 showed an 8.08% efficiency.
Furthermore, the different non-conjugated supplementary donors have a significant impact on the sensitizer's light-harvesting ability. For instance, as evidenced by the cell's performance, the phenyl-based substitutions (dye 2 with PCE of 7.86%) provide an impressive improvement in their photon-to-current efficiency over the alkyl-substituted dye owing to their larger molecular size that can suppress more back electron transfer from the semiconductor.20 Likewise, the elongated alkyl groups of hexyloxyphenyl in dye 2 endow greater conversion efficiency over methoxyphenyl in dye 1, as presented in Fig. 3a. This trend can be attributed to the longer aliphatic side chain (C6), which leads to an architecture capable of suppressing intermolecular π–π aggregation compared to dye 1 with only one carbon atom. As expected, the introduction of a long alkyl chain can also improve the homogeneity of dye adsorption on the substrate, which should lead to better dye loading and photoanode morphology.68,69
To confirm the relationship between the device morphology and dye loading, the dye-uptake experiments were investigated.70 The desorption experiment was performed in 0.05 M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) in MeOH solution.71 At identical surface area (0.25 cm2), thickness (∼12 μm), and porosity, the amounts of dyes 1 and 2 adsorbed on the TiO2 surfaces were 6.32 × 1016 and 9.80 × 1016 molecule cm−2, respectively. From this data, the amount of dye adsorption steadily increased in the presence of alkyl side chain at the extra-donor groups of dye 2, which relates to their high performance on the solar cell device. Thus, the poor solar-to-device performance of dye 1 could be ascribed to lower dye loading and the overall light-harvesting efficiency and/or Jsc value would be affected.52 Moreover, the dye absorption mechanism (both dissolved in solution and absorbed on solid-state) were recorded using FTIR spectroscopy (see in ESI,† Fig. S3 and S4). As illustrated in the FTIR spectra, the characteristic vibrational mode of the carboxylate functionality dramatically decreased for the solid dyes compared to the free-form one. The lower wavenumber absorption confirmed that the interaction on the TiO2 surface was chemisorption rather than physisorption. The depletion of carboxylate groups matched with those reported previously,72,73 which specifies the favorable bidentate grafting composition.74 Besides, it was noticeable that the cyano groups did not participate in the adsorption process because their peak remained unchanged both for the free-formed dye and the adsorbed dye. The trends were observed for both dyes 1 and 2; thus, the variation in the observed solar cell performance could be due to the molecular volume of the dye as well as the amount of dye loading.75 Therefore, these simplified modification approaches can be used to achieve better light-harvesting efficiency by suppressing intermolecular aggregation, retarding electron recombination, and enhancing the photovoltage.76,77
In addition, as depicted in Fig. 3b, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of dyes 1 and 2 was measured in the region of 350–800 nm to analyze the Jsc values. The onset IPCE spectra of dyes 1 and 2 were at 669 and 680 nm, respectively. The IPCE spectra of dyes 1 and 2 were similar in their pattern because of the identical conjugated structure. However, the IPCE profile was slightly shifted to a longer wavelength in the case of dye 2. The bathochromic shift of dyes 1 and 2 can be explained by the J-aggregation occurring at the semiconductor's interface. The observed IPCE trend correlated well with the red-shifted UV/Vis spectra of the molecular dyes in the solid-state. According to the spectra, dye 2 had both higher and broader peaks than dye 1, where the dye 2-based device can achieve more than 70% of IPCE in the region of 370–550 nm and a maximum of 97% in IPCE at 415 nm. The high PCE and broadened absorption spectral peaks are consistent with the corresponding higher Jsc and PCE values, which can be attributed to the suppression of the back electron transfer from the semiconductor in the presence of the long alkyl chains of the dyes.60,78
To understand the interfacial properties of the devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted. The relationship between the recombination resistances (RCT) and the applied bias voltage (V) is presented in Fig. 4a. The experiment was performed in the dark with 10 mV amplitude in the 50 mHz to 100 kHz frequency range, the bias potentials ranged from −0.60 to −0.75 V, and the corresponding Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4b. The larger semicircle is related to the charge-transfer process occurring at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte. According to the Nyquist plots, the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) is dramatically increased from dye 1 to dye 2, as evidenced by the increase in the size of the semi cycle, indicating a smaller dark current. Moreover, the RCT values (at ∼0.7 V) for dye 2 (79.17 Ω) was higher than that of dye 1 (41.37 Ω). The RCT result was in agreement with the fact that the dye 2-based device showed higher Voc value than that of dye 1. The superior performance of the dye 2-based device could be due to the hydrophobic properties of hexyloxyphenyl substitutions. The bulky aryl groups likely play an essential role in impeding the electrolyte diffusion on the TiO2 surface, resulting in the suppression of charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, thus increasing the Voc. Similar phenomena were previously observed for other dyes such as organic dyes,79 Ru-based dyes,80 and other organic dyes.78
 Fig. 4  Plots of (a) the electrochemical impedance spectral plots between charge recombination resistances (RCT) vs. applied bias voltage (V), (b) Nyquist plots of the DSSCs measured under dark conditions with a fixed potential of −0.7 V. 
Furthermore, the lifetime of the excited electron (measured at 0.7 V) of dye 2 (6.34 ms) was relatively longer than that of dye 1 (2.00 ms), suggesting that the electron injected from the excited state dye 2 can survive longer and prefers to get transferred to the conduction band of TiO2 rather than undergoing losses through recombination (see ESI,† Fig. S2). Therefore, the charge loss in the TiO2/electrolyte interface was indeed suppressed via the introduction of additional donating bulky groups into the core indolo-indole, providing an increase in both the electron lifetime and photovoltage.
3.4 Long-term stability and reproducibility of the devices
In terms of the long-term stability, the devices using dyes 1, 2, and N719 were fabricated, and their photovoltaic performances were subsequently measured every 24 h for two weeks, the results of which are presented in Fig. 5. It is evident that the devices’ power conversion efficiency could be maintained for at least 14 days and only exhibited ≤1% drop in the PCE relative to their initial performance. According to the stability data, the dye 2-based device showed only 0.62% of ΔPCE (ΔPCE = 0.67% of N719). Interestingly, the PCE of dye 2 measured several days after fabrication (7 or 8 days) had a stability profile that closely resembled that of the standard N719. It is worth noting that although dye 1 displayed a relatively low device efficiency, only ∼1% of its overall efficiency was decreased after 14 days. A similar trend of stability was also observed for other photovoltaic metrics such as Jsc, Voc, and FF (see in ESI,† Fig. S5). It is even more remarkable when considering the fact that the liquid electrolyte-based cell can generally undergo performance deterioration due to cell leakage and volatility-induced degradation of the electrolyte.81 Therefore, these results also suggest that the stability of dyes 1 and 2 is sufficiently robust to withstand all the physical limitations inherent in the DSSC device.
 Fig. 5  Stability profiles of dyes 1, 2, and N719 by comparing their power conversion efficiency. 
Moreover, five identical cells for both dye 1 and dye 2 were fabricated to confirm the device's reproductivity through the photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and photon-to-current efficiency (η), the results of which are shown in Fig. 6. The solar devices of dye 1 exhibited Jsc in the range of 10.65–11.60 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.64–0.66 V, and the FF of 0.69–0.70. Similarly, dye 2 gave the corresponding photovoltaic values in the range of 16.67–17.23 mA cm−2, 0.71–0.72 V, and of 0.63–0.65. In addition, molecular dyes 1 and 2 also displayed consistent conversion efficiency with little data dispersion, i.e., 5.04 ± 0.18% and 7.80 ± 0.03%, respectively, which indicates good reproducibility of the devices (Fig. 6).82

3.5 Molecular orbital calculations
The molecular orbital calculation data of dyes 1 and 2 were obtained from the theoretical analysis using the Gaussion09 program. The geometry optimizations were done with the literature specifications and the widely used B3LYP density functional with the 6-31G(d) basis set.52,54,58,75,83,84 The molecular orbitals were plotted by the Jimp2 visualizing program.
The calculated molecular orbitals (MOs) are shown in Fig. 7. As illustrated in both the dyes’ optimized configuration, the electrons donors (indolo[3,2-b]indole, methoxyphenyl, and hexyloxyphenyl) contributed largely at the ground stage, while the electron acceptor cyanoacrylic acid contributed largely at the excited state. It could be implied that the charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO is directly related to the electron transfer from methoxyphenyl or hexyloxyphenyl-substituted indolo[3,2-b]indole to cyanoacrylic acid acceptor in their excited state. Thus, according to the electron distributions, there was electron density overlapping between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels in each molecule. This kind of good electron intersection should help facilitate the efficient electron injection between organic sensitizers and the conduction band of TiO2. Besides, the optimized geometry of dyes 1 and 2 revealed the perpendicular alignment between the secondary donor group and the planar core donor, which may suppress dye aggregation and improve their photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, the calculated energy bandgap of dye 2 (EH–L = 2.98 eV) is slightly lower than that of dye 1 (EH–L = 3.00 eV), which correlated well with the band gap (E0–0) estimated from the onset of the experimental absorption spectra, as shown in Table 1.
 Fig. 7  The optimized configurations and electron distributions of dyes 1 and 2 optimized with DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, where the HOMOs are at the left and the LUMOs are at the right. 
Furthermore, the electronic transition parameters of the dyes, such as the TD-DFT excitation energies (E), oscillator strengths (f) above 0.1, as well as the MO compositions and characters, have been summarized (see ESI,† Table S1). The calculated excitation energy at the ICT and the π–π* transition character of dye 2 at f > 0.1 was found to be slightly red-shifted from that of dye 1. Similarly, the trend was also observed in the experimental absorption data, which implies the reliability of the chosen functional basis for calculation studies. In addition, at oscillator strengths of more than 0.3, the calculated TD-DFT excitation energy, E, was still consistent with the experimental result.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the metal-free organic sensitizers (dyes 1 and 2) containing 5,10-dihydroindolo[3,2-b] indole with di-acceptors (A–D–A) and extra electron donors were designed and synthesized. The A–D–A model was selected for better interaction with the TiO2 surface. The slight difference in substitutions leads to a clear difference in electron delocalization, absorption ability, HOMO–LUMO energy level, as well as photovoltaic performance. According to the results, dye 2 exhibited better performance than dye 1 and our previous dye20 with the PCE value of 7.86% under standard conditions. Moreover, the relatively high Jsc and Voc values can be rationalized in terms of the better light-harvesting efficiency and charge injection ability when compared to its derivatives with a mono anchor. Both the molecular dyes exhibited satisfying long-term stability and device reproducibility. Furthermore, the molecular modification of the 5,10-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]indole-based di-anchoring dye with a simplified structure incorporating additional donors is a promising strategy to create yet even more classes of efficient organic dyes for DSSCs.
