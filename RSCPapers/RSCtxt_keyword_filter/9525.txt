    , Accepted 11th January 2022First published on 12th January 2022AbstractWurtzite CuInS2 exhibits great potential for optoelectronic applications because of its excellent optical properties and good stability. However, exploring effective strategies to simultaneously optimize its optical and photoelectrical properties remains a challenge. In this study, the bandgap of wurtzite CuInS2 nanocrystals is successfully extended and the photocurrent is enhanced synchronously using external pressure. The bandgap of wurtzite CuInS2 increases with pressure and reaches an optimal value (1.5 eV) for photovoltaic solar energy conversion at about 5.9 GPa. Surprisingly, the photocurrent simultaneously increases nearly 3-fold and reaches the maximum value at this critical pressure. Theoretical calculation indicates that the pressure-induced bandgap extention in wurtzite CuInS2 may be attributed to an increased charge density and ionic polarization between the In–S atoms. The photocurrent preserves a relatively high photoresponse even at 8.8 GPa, but almost disappears above 10.3 GPa. The structural evolution demonstrates that CuInS2 undergoes a phase transformation from the wurtzite phase (P63mc) to the rock salt phase (Fmm) at about 10.3 GPa, which resulted in a direct to indirect bandgap transition and fianlly caused a dramatic reduction in photocurrent. These results not only map a new route toward further increase in the photoelectrical performance of wurtzite CuInS2, but also advance the current research of AI–BIII–CVI2 materials.
Introduction
The AI–BIII–CVI2 (A = Cu, Ag, B = Al, Ga, In, C = S, Se, Te) ternary chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties.1–5 Among these materials, Cu–III–VI2 compounds have high theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE, about 25–32%),6 high light absorption coefficient (105 cm−1),7 relatively low toxicity, and good stability against long-term radiation,8 which make them promising for photoelectrical applications. CuInS2 (CIS) are the most typical materials among these, with diverse crystal structures,9,10 suitable direct bandgaps,11 notable charge carrier mobilities, and potential high carrier concentrations.12 Compared with the ordered chalcopyrite (CH) CIS, disordered wurtzite (WZ) CIS offers more flexibility for stoichiometry control and can tune the Fermi energy over a wide range, which are beneficial to obtain exciting optical and optoelectronic properties.11,13–15 To further approach the Shockley–Queisser limit, it is highly desirable to tune the crystal structure of WZ-CIS in a way that can synergistically extend the bandgap for broader solar spectrum absorption and enhance the photocurrent for greater photovoltage.16 The traditional methods to tune optical properties mainly include composition engineering, built-in electric field, and alloying.17–19 Composition engineering and dimensional tailoring have been developed to optimize the performances of WZ-CIS, such as doping the metal elements or hetero nanocrystals, and controlling the nanocrystal growth size, etc.20–26 However, compositional modification is subject to numerous challenges, such as dopants can cause irreversible changes to the host structure beyond some critical concentration and the WZ-CuInxGa1−xS2 largely extends its bandgap but reduces the photocurrent when the Ga doping concentration is increased.21,27 Thus, developing an effective approach to simultaneously improve the optical and photoelectrical properties of WZ-CIS has become an urgent target.
Hydrostatic pressure, as an alternative of chemical pressure, can not only effectively optimize the physical and chemical properties of materials without changing their chemical compositions but also explore the structure–property relationship. Up to now, pressure-based materials engineering has motivated and strengthened the photoelectrical performances of semiconductive halide perovskites, iodide, sulfides and oxides.28–35 For example, the perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2 achieved significant photocurrent enhancement at high pressures to regulate the excitonic features.28 The pressure-treated CH3NH3SnI3 exhibited significantly higher photocurrent than its original phase.30 The inverse photoconductivity of the WO3/CuO nano-heterojunction was induced by a high pressure, accompanied by phase transition and bandgap modification.35 These results indicate that pressure-induced variations in atomic distance, bandgap, and electronic structure can effectively promote the photoelectric performance of functional materials. In addition, the bandgap of CH-CIS has shown an increasing trend with an increase in the pressure.36 Inspired by these studies, we are eager to extend the high-pressure effect on WZ-CIS in order to reveal the influence of the crystal structure on bandgap and try to improve its photoelectrical properties.
In this study, we studied the optical, photoelectrical, and electrical transport properties of WZ-CIS under high pressure using Vis-NIR absorption, photocurrent, and electrical resistivity measurements. The photocurrent was dramatically enhanced and the bandgap was also extended upon compression, the reason of which was discussed from the band theory. The structural stability of WZ-CIS was examined subsequently by in situ angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) measurement and theoretical calculations. These results not only provide in-depth understanding of the relationship between the structure and properties variations, but also develop guidelines for optimizing the design of WZ-CIS based photovoltaic device.
Experimental and computational details
WZ-CIS nanocrystals were synthesized via a hot-injection technique. Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (0.099 g, 0.5 mmol), In(CH3COO)2·3H2O (0.146 g, 0.5 mmol), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 0.7732 g, 2 mmol), and 10 mL oleylamine/1-octadecene combination (volume ratio OLAM/ODE 5:5) were loaded into a 25 mL filter bottle and stirred under vacuum for 30 min. The mixture was placed into a 25 mL three-neck flask and heated to 473 K. Subsequently, the mixture of 0.25 mL 1-DDT and 1.75 mL t-DDT was injected, and the reaction system was kept at 513 K for 1 h. Naturally cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was centrifuged three times with absolute ethanol and deionized water, respectively. The colloids were redissolved in hexane, followed by ultrasound, centrifugation, and drying to obtain powder samples.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a MicroMax-007HF diffractometer (CuKα1, λ = 1.5406(4) Å) at ambient conditions. The simulated XRD pattern was calculated using the GSAS program.37 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and high-resolution TEM image (HRTEM) were obtained using a JEM-2200FS microscope at an operating voltage of 200 kV. To derive compositional information about the sample, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed on an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using an monochromated aluminum anode and Magellan 400 scanning electron microscope, respectively.
A standard symmetrical diamond-anvil cell (DAC) with 300 μm culets and pre-indented rhenium gasket were used for high-pressure ADXRD. The WZ-CIS powders were pressed in a slice and loaded into the sample chamber filled with neon as the pressure transmitting medium (PTM). A ruby sphere was loaded in the sample chamber as well to calibrate the pressure via the ruby fluorescence method.38 The ADXRD patterns were collected at the beamline 15U1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) at the wavelength of 0.6199 Å and CCD detector. Diffraction intensities on the 2D detector were integrated using the FIT2D software. The indexing and refinement of powder patterns were performed using GSAS program.37
High-pressure Vis-NIR absorption measurements were conducted using an Ocean Optics QE65000 modified spectrophotometer with transmittance methods. The transmission spectrum of silicon oil around the sample was subtracted as the background. The in situ resistivity measurement was carried out by four-point-probe using a platinum foil strip as the electrode. To achieve electrical insulation, a layer of a mixture of cubic boron nitride (cBN) and epoxy were inserted between the gasket and diamond culet. A Keithley 2400 current source and Keithley 2700 multimeter were chosen to supply electric current and detect the voltage, respectively. The resistivity was calculated by van der Pauw method.39 For the photocurrent measurements, electrochemical workstation CHI760E was used to record the I–t data and 532 nm excitation laser was used as the irradiation source. No PTM was used in the last two experiments in order to avoid the introduction of impurities interfering with the electrical measurements and to ensure good electrical contact.
First principles calculations were carried out within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT) using the local density approximation (LDA).40 The pseudopotential method using the projector augmented wave (PAW) was adopted with S 3s23p4, Cu 3d104s1 and In 5s25p1 electrons as the valence electrons in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.41,42 For structural relaxation, a plane-wave basis set with an energy cut-off 600 eV and 10 × 5 × 5 k-point mesh were employed. All the enthalpy calculations were converged to within 1 meV per atom.
Results and discussion
Pure phase WZ-CIS nanocrystals prepared by hot injection methods were used in this study (Fig. S1†). The WZ-CIS nanocrystals are the hexagonal phase with space group P63mc (lattice parameters: a = b = 3.907(4) Å, c = 6.428(4) Å). The WZ-CIS sample has an average diameter of about 20.5 nm by using the Scherrer formula. The sample exhibits a hexagonal morphology with good crystallinity, as shown by TEM and HRTEM characterizations in Fig. 1a and b. The energy state structure and elemental stoichiometry of WZ-CIS nanocrystals have been shown in ESI† (Fig. S2–S3 and Table S1).

In general, bandgap plays a crucial role in determining the ability to absorb light and gain photogenerated carriers. In order to track the bandgap evolution, Vis-NIR absorption measurements are carried out on WZ-CIS under pressure. It can be seen in Fig. 2a that the optical absorption spectrum shows a steep slope of absorption edge at ambient conditions indicating a direct bandgap in WZ-CIS. The bandgap is estimated to be 1.38 eV by the Tauc plot (Fig. 2b), which is consistent with the previous reports.24 The absorption edge exhibits a blueshift with increasing pressure up to 9.1 GPa and then a sharp redshift from 10.2 GPa till 18.4 GPa (Fig. 2a). The absorption spectrum shows less steep absorption edge above 10.2 GPa compared to those at lower pressures, representing the characteristics of indirect bandgap semiconductor (Fig. S4†).43–45 This intriguing direct to indirect bandgap transition could be induced by a structural phase transition, like its binary II–VI analogues.44–46 The direct bandgap in the WZ phase increases at a rate of 19.7 meV GPa−1 with pressure, which is slightly smaller than that observed in CH-CIS (24.0 meV GPa−1)36 and the indirect bandgap decreases with pressure at −26.8 meV GPa−1 (Fig. 2c). Significantly, the bandgap increased to 1.5 eV at near 5.9 GPa, which is considered as the optimal value for photovoltaic solar energy conversion.47,48 Hence, WZ-CIS may exhibit excellent photoelectrical performance at around 5.9 GPa.

To gain further insight into the bandgap opening behavior, we calculated the band structure, DOS and ELF of WZ-CIS by first principles calculations, as shown in Fig. 3. A direct bandgap exists at Γ point and the bandgap increases with pressure from 0.1 eV at 0 GPa to 0.36 eV at 9.0 GPa (Fig. 3a and b). As DFT calculations generally underestimate the bandgap, the calculated bandgaps are smaller than the corresponding experimental values, but give more accurate pressure dependence.49 The calculated pressure dependence of 28.8 meV GPa−1 is comparable with the experimental result of 19.7 meV GPa−1. The valence band maximum (VBM) is composed by the hybridization of the Cu 3d state and the S 3p state, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly contributed by the In 5s state and S 3p state (Fig. 3a). Both CB and VB move towards the high energy region under pressure but the CB moves faster than the VB (Fig. 3b). The ELF of WZ-CIS (Fig. 3c) shows distinct localization of valence electrons around the S atoms, demonstrating the ionic character of the bonding, which is same as the bonding type of binary analog WZ-ZnS.50 However, there is strong mixing of chalcogen valence s and p orbitals with the outer s and p orbitals from the metals in Cu-based chalcogenides, which results in more covalent rather than ionic character.51 Thus, decrease in the interatomic spacing increases the localization of charge density and ionic polarization under high pressure, inducing covalent enhancement (Fig. 3d). In addition, the increased localization with pressure produces deeper potentials, making unoccupied level in the CBM harder to access energetically.52,53 While same effect is observed in the VBM, the p and d character of these states results in a much smaller shift, and the net effect is larger bandgap.54 Thus, one can infer that the pressure-induced bandgap opening is mainly attributed to an increased charge density and ionic polarization between In–S atoms. These interesting changes are expected to affect the photoelectric and electrical transport properties.

Photocurrent is believed to be one of the most important parameters determining the photoelectric performance. We conducted in situ photocurrent measurement on WZ-CIS under different pressures and it exhibits a remarkable photoresponse with the on–off switch of visible light. As shown in Fig. 4a, the photocurrent rises rapidly due to the increase in the photogenerated charge carriers upon illumination. Under constant illumination, a gentle increase in the photocurrent is likely due to the photo-enhanced mobility of charge carriers. The magnitude of photocurrent significantly increases as a function of pressure and reaches the maximum value at 6.0 GPa, which is nearly 4-folds that of ambient conditions. Significantly, the bandgap of WZ-CIS approaches the optimal value (1.5 eV) for photovoltaic solar energy conversion and the photocurrent simultaneously reaches its peak value at 6.0 GPa, which is consistent with the previous prediction. Unlike perovskite photovoltaic materials, e.g., APbBr3 (A = Cs, CH3NH3, CH(NH2)2) for which excellent photoresponse is achieved in their high-pressure phases,55–57 the optimal bandgap and the peak photocurrent of WZ-CIS can be obtained in the original phase, making this material more promising for pressure-responsive photoelectrical applications.
 Fig. 4  (a) Photocurrent and (b) photocurrent amplitude of WZ-CIS as a function of pressure. 
The photocurrent amplitude decreases slightly from 6.0 to 8.8 GPa due to the bandgap mismatches the optimal value of solar energy conversion. Upon further compression, the photocurrent falls sharply at 10.3 GPa and then almost disappears above 11.9 GPa (Fig. 4b). In general, bandgap plays a crucial role in determining the light absorption ability and gaining photogenerated carriers. For the direct bandgap semiconductor, the VBM electrons jump to CBM as long as they absorb the photon energy when the photon energy of the excitation light is greater than or equal to the bandgap. However, the photon absorption efficiency will be decreased due to the necessity of absorption of an additional phonon to supply the difference in momentum.58 It has been demonstrated that the photoresponsivity of monolayer MoS2 with direct bandgap dramatically improved about 9000 times compared to that in the multilayer sample with indirect bandgap.59 Thus, the pressure-induced direct to indirect bandgap transition of WZ-CIS could be responsible for the sharp drop in photocurrent above 10.3 GPa. Considering the pressure enhanced photoresponse in WZ-CIS, except for chemical modification, our experimental results point out that physical tailoring can be regarded as a new strategy to improve the photovoltaic properties of AI–BIII–CVI2 materials.
Discontinuous changes of optical and photoelectrical properties of materials usually originate from the instability of the crystal structure. Therefore, we conducted high-pressure ADXRD measurements to examine the structural modification of WZ-CIS. Fig. 5a shows representative ADXRD patterns of WZ-CIS obtained at different pressures during compression. With increasing pressure, three new diffraction peaks emerge at 10.3 GPa. Some original peaks of the WZ phase (P63mc) begin to disappear at this pressure and ultimately vanish at 17.2 GPa. This fact indicates that the onset of a pressure-induced phase transition of WZ-CIS is 10.3 GPa. The Rietveld refinement of the diffraction pattern at 17.2 GPa indicates that the high-pressure phase adopts the RS structure with space group Fmm (a = 5.0810 Å), as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2.† Therefore, the direct to indirect bandgap transition and the disappearance of photocurrent under a high pressure originated from the structural phase transition of CIS from the WZ phase to the RS phase. The lattice parameter evolutions of CIS under pressure are plotted in Fig. S6.† For the WZ- and RS-CIS, the occupation probability of Cu and In atoms on every cation position is 50%, suggesting that these two phases are disordered, in contrast to the ordered CH phase. The symmetry changes from P63mc to Fmm accompanied with a volume collapse of about 9.7%, as a result of the increase in coordination number around the cations from 4 to 6 (Fig. 5b). The P–V data were fitted to the third-order Birch–Murnaghan equation of state (BM EOS) yielding B0 = 73.5 ± 3.3 GPa, B′0 = 3.3 ± 0.4, V0 = 85.0 ± 0.1 Å3 for the WZ phase and B0 = 100.7 ± 4.1 GPa, B′0 = 4.2 ± 0.2, V0 = 74.4 ± 0.4 Å3 for the RS phase. The bulk modulus of WZ-CIS is smaller than that of CH-CIS (87.7 GPa),60 indicating that the metastable disordered phase is more compressible than the stable ordered phase in CIS.

The insets show the crystal structures. (c) The decompression curve. (d) Enthalpy curves (relative to CH structure) of WZ and rock salt (RS) structure as a function of pressure in CIS. 
Upon decompression (Fig. 5c), CIS does not return to its starting WZ structure, but converts into the CH structure. The diffraction peaks of the recovered phase are fairly broad, which is consistent with the experiment with CH-CIS and WZ-CuGaS2.60,61 It has been reported that some vanadates, such as NaVO3 and MgV2O6, need heat treatment to obtain good diffraction patterns of the recovered phase from the high-pressure experiments.62,63 When the recovered sample was heated at 453 K (below the synthesizing temperature of 513 K) for 3 h, the diffraction peaks still can be indexed to the tetragonal CH structure with the space group I2d (Fig. S5c and Table S2†). Thus, the pressure-induced structure evolution of WZ-CIS can be regarded as disorder (WZ phase)  disorder (RS phase)  order (CH phase). Our first principles calculations indicate that the CH-CIS is the stable phase throughout the pressure range up to 13.1 GPa (Fig. 5d). The WZ structure has very small enthalpy difference above the CH phase making it possible to present as a metastable phase. When the pressure exceeds 12.8 GPa, the RS structure becomes energetically stable over the WZ structure, suggesting that WZ may directly transform into the RS structure. Upon decompression, the RS structure transforms into more energetically favorable CH structure instead of the metastable WZ structure, which is consistent with our experimental structural phase transition evolution. The difference in the transition pressure between experiments and calculations can be attributed to neglecting the temperature effect.
To explore more information of pressure effect on the sample, we also conducted the electrical resistivity measurement on WZ-CIS under pressure. As shown in Fig. 6, the lowest pressure data point was recorded at 0.4 GPa, yielding a resistivity of 21.4 ohm cm, which is smaller than that (44.2 ohm cm) reported in CH-CIS.60 The resistivity increases with pressure reaching its peak value at 10.5 GPa and then decreases rapidly to 17.0 GPa, followed by a gentle decrease till 35.5 GPa. The evolution of the resistivity is consistent with that of CH-CIS under pressure, but shows more moderate variation. The increase in resistivity with pressure up to 10.5 GPa is attributed to the pressure-induced opening of the bandgap in the WZ phase (Fig. 2c). The sharp decrease of resistivity is due to the increase in the RS phase in the pressure region of 10.5–17.0 GPa. Upon further compression, the sample completely converts to the pure RS phase and the resistivity shows gradual and gentle decrease due to bandgap closure. The opposite variation trend of the resistivity in WZ and RS phases suggests different structural responses to the pressure tuning, which may provide us some special applications in photovoltaic devices as a switch.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully extended the bandgap of WZ-CIS by a high-pressure treatment, which reached the optimal value for photovoltaic solar energy conversion at about 5.9 GPa. Simultaneously, the photocurrent of WZ-CIS reached the maximum value, which was nearly 4-folds that of ambient conditions at 6.0 GPa. First principles calculation revealed that high charge density and ionic polarization between In–S atoms account for the bandgap opening in the WZ phase. Further compressed to 10.3 GPa, the sample undergoes phase transformation from the disordered WZ phase to the disordered RS phase, accompanied by an intriguing direct to indirect bandgap transition and a dramatic reduction of photocurrent. The sample finally returns to the ordered CH phase after releasing pressure, which is consistent with the theoretical calculations. These results not only uncovered the relationship between structure and properties, but also developed guidelines for optimizing the design of the WZ-CIS based photovoltaic device.
