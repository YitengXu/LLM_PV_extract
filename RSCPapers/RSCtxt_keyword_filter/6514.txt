E-mail: kapg2@sussex.ac.uk;  Fax: +44 (0)1273606196First published on 15th May 2013AbstractThis chapter reviews the literature reported during 2012 on fullerenes chemistry including fullerene production and properties, organic- and organometallic- chemistry, endohedral derivatives and advanced materials as well as theoretical studies and possible applications of fullerene and its derivatives.HighlightsA novel approach to the highly selective synthesis of amine and amino acid derivatives of C60 fullerene has been developed. The obtained water-soluble C60 derivatives demonstrated pronounced antibacterial and antiviral activities in vitro that may lead to valuable biomedicinal applications.11 Production, separation and properties of fullerenesA comprehensive evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of fullerenes, focusing on the comparison between pristine and functionalised C60 preparations and the mechanisms of their toxicity in mammalian cells and tissues were reviewed. It appears that most of the pure and derivatised C60 preparations are not overtly toxic unless photoexcited or used at very high concentrations unlikely to be encountered environmentally or during therapy.2A facile and convenient synthesis of C60 and C70 by microwave techniques using graphite powder has been reported. Pyrrole was also used as a reactant for the formation of aza-fullerenes using the same technique. The substances synthesised were characterised by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry technique.3Stable aqueous suspensions of individual fullerenes, nC60, nC70, nC76 and nC84 clusters have been prepared using a calorimetric modification of a commonly used liquid–liquid extraction technique for the first time.4 Fullerene nanowhiskers composed of C60 fullerene molecules were prepared using the liquid–liquid interfacial precipitation method in the carbon-disulfide and isopropyl alcohol system. The structure of the fullerene nanowhiskers were revealed by the electron microscopic images and XRD.5The influence of the carbon precursor, carbon feed rate and helium gas flow rate on the synthesis of fullerenes from carbon powder using a plasma reactor operating at atmospheric pressure were studied. This study revealed a strong dependence of these parameters with fullerene yield and rate of fullerene production. It also revealed the key role of the carbon black purity.6 It has been demonstrated that C60 could be synthesised by detonating the mixture of trinitrotoluene–graphite under high pressure and temperature. The detonation products were analysed by mass spectroscopy and HPLC.7 The first X-ray structures of both a stable pristine 1:1 corannulene:C60 co-crystal and also of a C60:penta-tert-butylated corannulene have been achieved.8The production and consumption of ROS by C60 and fullerenol were investigated in aqueous systems. The results showed that fullerenol exhibits a higher photoproduction efficiency of ROS than aqueous suspensions of C60 aggregates.9Mammalian cells were used to examine the in vitro clastogenicity and phototoxicity of C60. It was concluded that C60 did not, by mutagenic or phototoxic activity, cause direct DNA damage in mammalian cells in vitro.10 An environmentally realistic method to test C60 toxicity to the benthic organism Chironomus riparius was developed. The study provides an important first step toward the development of standard ecotoxicological methods for fullerenes and understanding the potential risks that these materials may carry after release into the natural environment.11It was found that the C60 stability in the aqueous solution is caused by a formation of a thin layer of methylbenzoate produced during sonication of C60/toluene–water mixture.12 The first demonstration of C60O's role in stabilising aqueous fullerene colloidal suspensions (aqu/nC60) and the first demonstration of ambient ozone's role in the formation of aqu/nC60 have been presented.13The structures and field electron emission properties of C60 fullerene nanowhiskers were investigated. Field electron emitters using the heat-treated C60 fullerene nanowhiskers were fabricated, and characterised.14Biochemical redox responses in brain and gill homogenates of the fish C. carpio after exposure to C60 fullerene suspension under fluorescence light were evaluated.15It has been found that both C60 and single-walled carbon nanotubes can be readily dissolved in water with the aid of a triptycene or naphthalene derivative.16 The preparation of a crystalline highly water-soluble C60 by complexation with disaccharides in a mixed homogeneous solvent system was described for the first time. The solubility and stability of C60–disaccharides were found to be higher than the traditional C60–CD inclusion complex.17The behaviour of C60, C70 as well as N-methyl-fulleropyrrolidine and (1,2-methanofullerene C60)-61-carboxylic acid in NACE was studied. The results showed that the NACE method proposed was suitable for the analysis of C60 in commercial cosmetic creams.18 The effect of C60 on the mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites based on polyamide/12 was investigated.19 The thermal behaviour of a mixture of fullerites C60/70 in various media was studied by XRD, FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. It was found that the C60/70 mixture decomposed at lower temperatures than in pure C60 and C70; the decomposition temperature depended on the impurity content.202 Chemistry of the fullerenes2.1 Organic chemistry2.1.1 Addition reactions. The reactions of C60 with active methylene compounds, methyl ketones, beta-enamino carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acid derivatives, and diallylamines in the presence of Mn(OAc)3·2H2O affording the singly bonded fullerene dimers, 1,4-adducts and 1,16-adduct of C60, C60-fused dihydrofurans, methanofullerenes, C60-fused pyrrolines, C60-fused lactones, fullerenyl ester derivatives, and C60-fused pyrrolidines have been reviewed.21A stereoselective method for the synthesis of cis- and trans-2′,5′-disubstituted N-arylpyrrolofullerenes by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides generated by heating of dialkyl aziridinedicarboxylates to C60 was proposed.22 [3+2] cycloaddition of electron-deficient enynes with C60 by phosphane-promoted tandem alpha(delta′)-Michael addition reactions leading to a new class of cyclopenteno-fullerenes bearing phosphorus ylides with unusually high LUMO energy levels were described.23 The thermal and catalytic cycloaddition of diazothioates to C60 has been investigated. It was found that the reaction between C60 and diazothioates led to the selective formation of methanofullerenes in the presence of a palladium-based three-component catalyst and afforded a mixture of stereoisomeric homofullerenes in the absence of catalyst.24 Multiadditions of heteroaddends to C60 were achieved via the oxazolination reaction of 1,4-(PhCH2)2C60 with OH− and PhCN, which exhibit a unique regioselectivity regarding the addition sites of the heteroatoms.25 A hexafullereno-diporphyrinoid was obtained in a sequence of [4+2]-cycloaddition and cheletropic SO2-extrusion reactions using porphyrins programmed and C60.26The principal possibility of the synthesis of monoadducts of C60 by solid phase synthesis was shown for the first time.27The Diels–Alder reaction between C60 and [3] dendralene using DFT has been reported for the first time. The versatility of this reaction offers an attractive means for the functionalisation of C60 fullerene.282.1.2 Alkylation and arylation. New soluble fullerene derivatives ButnC60 were synthesised by the reaction of C60Mn(THF)x (M = Li, Na; n = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) with tert-butyl bromide. The compounds were chromatographically isolated and characterised by spectroscopic methods.29 C60-induced alkyne cyclisation and scission reactions with the carbonyl complex W(CO)(PhCCPh)3 to give complexes containing η4-C4Ph4, η5-C5Ph5, η3-benzyl, and terminal benzylidyne ligands were demonstrated. The structures have been determined by XRD.30 A wide variety of methano-C60 linked with a single electron-withdrawing group were synthesised through the one-step reaction of active halides with C60 mediated by CuBr–PMDETA. A possible reaction pathway was proposed for the formation of the methano-C60 derivatives.31The relationship between the size of the substituents of aryl groups in a series of fifteen 6,9,12,15,18-pentaaryl-1-hydro-C60 and the solid-state structures and packing motifs of these compounds has been analysed. The series of pentaarylfullerenes was characterised by single-crystal XRD.32A series of arylated dihydrofullerene derivatives were prepared to elucidate the effective design of fullerene derivatives for enhancing the performance of organic photovoltaics.332.1.3 Hydrogenation. The hydrofullerene C50H10 was synthesised by low-pressure benzene–oxygen diffusion combustion. The Saturn-like structure with D5h symmetry and optical properties comparable to those of C50Cl10 has been established by spectrometric identifications. The cyclic voltammetric analysis reveals that C50H10, in contrast to C50Cl10, exhibits reversible redox behaviour occurring at more negative potentials with possible application in photovoltaic devices.34 The reaction of C60/catalyst with hydrogen gas was studied at 400 °C and 50 bar of H2 pressures. The effect of Ni- or Pt-catalysts addition on the fullerene composition and crystal structure of hydrogenated C60 was shown. However, the chemical composition of highly hydrogenated samples (C60Hx with x = 36–52) was revealed by mass spectrometry to be similar to samples hydrogenated with and without catalyst.35The complexation and activation reactions of C64H4 with triosmium carbonyl clusters were presented and the resulting compound structures were determined by XRD.36 The hydrogen absorption and desorption properties of pure NaxC60 without any by-products was determined and compared to pure C60. The hydrogen amount was determined volumetrically and the samples were investigated by X-ray- and in situ neutron- powder diffraction, Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy.37The generalised gradient approximation based on the density functional theory was used to analyze the geometric and the electronic properties of C80H80.382.1.4 Polymerisation. Fullerene-containing poly(ethylene oxide)-block-polystyrene have been synthesised as model shape amphiphiles with variable composition, diverse architecture, and high fullerene functionality.39 A novel C60-appended initiator for living cationic polymerisation and its application to the synthesis of C60-end-capped poly(vinyl ether)s was studied. It was found that the initiator afforded C60-end-capped polymers with well-controlled architecture, and the obtained polymer exhibited solvatochromism, indicating self-assembly in the media.40A novel and highly efficient Cu(OAc)2-catalysed homo-dimerisation of various monofunctionalised hydrofullerenes that affords the single-bonded fullerene dimers in excellent yields in the presence of dimethylformamide at room temperature under air atmosphere were reported.41 Unprecedented, efficient, nontoxic and transition-metal-free NaOH-catalysed homo- and cross-dimerisations of monofunctionalised hydrofullerenes were developed. The present novel catalytic dimerisation provided a general, mild, and green method for the construction of various single-bonded fullerene dimers with remarkably high yields.42A new method to prepare well-defined acceptor copolymers comprising C60 through a Cu catalysed alkyne–azide click chemistry approach was demonstrated. The results obtained can be further used to design donor–acceptor block copolymers yielding materials interesting for polymer solar cells.43 The mono-addition product of C60 polystyrene conjugates was obtained by using the thiol–ene click-chemistry approach. The spectral analyses and thermal observations proved the mono-addition nature of the process.44 A new thiophenic 3-substituted monomer bearing a C60 moiety at the end of its side chain was synthesised. The monomer has been copolymerised with 3-hexylthiophene through oxidative polymerisation with iron trichloride. The soluble products have been characterised by different spectroscopic techniques. These results indicate that the newly synthesised monomer and copolymer can be strategic materials for organic photovoltaic applications.45C60–polystyrene nano particles were prepared by using emulsion polymerisation. The structure and morphologies of the nano particles were examined by various analytical techniques.46 C60–polyaniline nanocomposites have been synthesised by the oxidative polymerisation of aniline with ammonium peroxydisulfate in the presence of C60 by using an interfacial reaction.47Branched copolymers containing covalently bonded C60 were synthesised by cross-linking radical copolymerisation of N-vinylpyrrolidone with triethylene glycol dimethacrylate in toluene saturated with C60. Their composition was studied by elemental analysis, IR and electronic absorption spectroscopy.48The synthesis and characterisation of carbazole based π-conjugated system with C60 as electron accepting moieties and its electropolymerisation in order to obtain an ambipolar conjugated polymer were described. Their optical and electrochemical characterisations were presented.492.1.5 Fullerene derivatives containing halogens. The synthesis and molecular structures of fullerene halides, covering earlier work in this field and progress in synthetic methods developed in the last few years, have been reviewed.50A series of new trannulenes, C60F15[CX(COOR)2]3 (X = COOMe, Br; R = Me, Et, Prn, n-Hex, But, (CH2)3NHCOOBut), some water soluble, was synthesised and their compositions and structures were proved by various spectroscopic techniques.51 Several fluorinated pentaphenyl-monohydro-C60 derivatives have been prepared in good yields via reaction of the corresponding fluorinated phenyl copper reagent under a nitrogen atmosphere.52 A convenient method was reported for the synthesis of C60-fused fluorinated lactones based on the manganese(III) acetate promoted radical reaction of C60 with fluorine-containing phenylacetic acids.53The chlorofullerene C2v-C60Cl8 has been synthesised by reaction of C60 with iodine monochloride. The compound has been separated by means of HPLC, and its molecular structure has been determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis.54It was found that the solution-phase perfluoroalkylation of C60 is a versatile technique suitable for preparation of bis-C60(RF)2 and many other derivatives with varying number of perfluorinated aliphatic or benzylic RF groups.55Cs-C60(CF3)6 was synthesised by the reaction of S6-C60(CF3)12 with C60 at 530 °C. Its molecular structure was elucidated by XRD. Theoretical DFT calculations were performed to account for a high degree of fragmentation in negative-ion mass spectra.56 Novel C60 fullerene derivatives bearing a fluoroalkyl group were synthesised, and their photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties were investigated.57Chlorination of IPR C82 isomer with SbCl5 results in two consecutive Stone–Wales rearrangements into non-IPR C82Cl28 with one pair of fused pentagons. An extensive theoretical study of the transformation pathways in C82 revealed that the thermodynamically favourable rearrangement into non-IPR C82Cl28 needs comparatively low activation energy.58Synthesis, isolation and XRD study of C84(CF3)16, C84Cl20, and C84Cl32 were reported.59 The synthesis, isolation, and XRD study of a new C2F5 derivative of C84 and C84Cl22, has been described.60The synthesis, separation and XRD analysis of the trifluoromethyl derivatives of C88 (CF3)n (n = 16, 18 and 20) were presented.61Four C96 isomers have been isolated from fullerene soot and their structures were confirmed by XRD of their chlorides C96Cl22 and C96Cl24, the latter three isomers have been reported for the first time.62Electronic structures, polarisabilities and absorption spectra of the fluorinated C60 derivative C60F17CF3 has been systematically studied by DFT.632.1.6 Fullerene derivatives containing nitrogen. An effective way for the synthesis of C60-fused tetrahydroisoquinolines via Pd-catalysed heteroannulation of C60 with N-benzyl sulfonamides via C–H bond activation has been discovered.64 Direct thermal reaction of C60 with amino acids or amino acid esters in refluxing o-dichlorobenzene and in the absence of aldehydes under aerobic and dark conditions has been investigated.65Four novel C60–pyrrolidines containing trifluoromethyl group have been synthesised via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions and have been characterised by various spectroscopic techniques. Their optical and electrochemical properties have been studied, and the results show that those fulleropyrrolidines containing CF3 group have good fluorescence and electrochemical properties.66 Stereodivergent syntheses of cis/trans pyrrolidino[3,4:1,2]fullerenes and endo/exo pyrrolidines were reported with high enantioselectivity levels. These results pave the way to the synthesis of very useful fulleropyrrolidines with complete control of their stereochemistry.67The facile syntheses of series of N-alkylaziridino-C60 through the [2+1] reaction of C60 and primary alkylamines with the aid of di(acetoxyiodo)benzene and I2 under mild ambient conditions and their application in polymer BHJ solar cells has been reported.68 The one-pot synthesis of unsubstituted aziridinofullerene and triazolinofullerene was performed for the first time via the cycloaddition of fullerene C60 with hydrazoic acid under the conditions of thermal and photochemical reactions.69 Variously substituted [6,6]closed aziridinofullerenes were exclusively obtained from acid-catalysed denitrogenation of triazolinofullerenes without formation of relevant [5,6]open azafulleroids, which are the major products on noncatalysed denitrogenation.70New conjugates based on fullerene C60 and nickel and copper complexes of meso-aryl substituted porphyrins with long-chain substituents were prepared using the Prato reaction.71A series of pyrazolino-C60–1,8-naphthalimide fluorescent derivatives were synthesised in one pot by a [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition between C60 and corresponding hydrazone in good yield. The electrochemical properties and molecular orbital calculations of obtained derivatives were studied.72Recent progress in the preparation and reactions of azafullerene including free radical reactions and electrophilic aromatic substitution were summarised.73 The synthesis of a new azafullerene C59N-phthalocyanine dyad was described and its structure was verified by different spectroscopic techniques.742.1.7 Fullerene derivatives containing oxygen. The synthesis, isolation and structural characterisation of fullerene epoxides have been reviewed.75 The reactions of C60 with malonate esters, beta-keto esters, nitriles, aldehydes/ketones, and arylboronic acids in the presence of ferric perchlorate to afford the corresponding C60-fused products have been reviewed and their possible reaction mechanisms were also described.761,2-Fullerenols C60(OCOR)(OH) have been effectively prepared via the reaction of C60 with acid chlorides in the presence of ferric perchlorate, and they can be utilised as precursors for further functionalisation such as esterification, etherification and arylation. A possible reaction mechanism for the product formation was proposed.77A series of isomerically pure alkynyl-substituted fullerenol derivatives such as C60(OH)6(O(CH2)3CCH)2 were synthesised through Lewis acid catalyzed epoxy ring opening and/or SN1 replacement reactions starting from the fullerene-mixed peroxide C60(O)(t-BuOO)4.78 Fullerene-containing boronic esters, C60(O2BAr)(OOt-Bu)4 have been prepared through the reaction between vicinal fullerendiol, C60(OH)2(OOt-Bu)4 and arylboronic acid.79It has been shown that the Arbuzov-type reaction of C60Cl6 with trialkyl phosphites leads to the formation of highly functionalised fullerene derivatives C60[P(O)(OR)2]5H with high yields.80 Alkoxy C60 fullerene derivatives containing hydroxy groups [C60(OR)x(OH) (x = 3, 4)] were produced in high yields by the free-radical reaction of C60 with primary alcohols mediated by cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate.81Synthetic procedures for the preparation of azafullerene and oxafulleroids such as C59O3 and C60O4 have been developed involving BBr3-mediated removal of peroxo addends as a key step.822.2 Organometallic chemistryA highly soluble organometallic C60 dumbbell consisting of two fulleropyrrolidines connected to a central ferrocene unit by amide linkages has been prepared and fully characterised by various spectroscopic techniques.83A lithium-doped fullerene (Lix–C60–Hy) that is capable of reversibly storing hydrogen through chemisorption at elevated temperatures and pressures was reported.84It was found that the attachment of the redox-active C60(H)PPh2 group modulates the electronic structure of the Fe2 core in [(μ-bdt)Fe2(CO)5(C60(H)PPh2)].85A system based on late transition-metal halides, phosphanes, water, and reducing agents in 1,2-dichlorobenzene can efficiently catalyse the intermolecular reductive coupling of C60 with N-sulfonylaldimines to afford novel 1,2-hydrobenzylated C60 derivatives.86Three salts containing discrete C604− anions were synthesised by the reduction of C60 in solution using rubidium–mercury amalgams and rubidium suboxide both in the presence of elemental mercury. The three new salts, [Rb6DMF14(C6H13N2O2)2]·C60, [Rb(diaza-18-crown-6)]4·C60·(en)4, and [Rb(benzo-18-crown-6)]4·C60, were characterised by XRD.872.3 Advanced materialsDihydronaphthyl-based C60 bisadduct derivative, NC60BA, was synthesised at mild temperature in high yield. It has been found that the NC60BA-based PSC exhibit superior photovoltaic performance and thermal stability compared to PC61BM-based PSCs.88 A series of alkoxy-substituted dihydronaphthyl-based C60 bisadduct derivatives (Cn-NCBA, n = 1–6), with the alkoxy chain length from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, were synthesised and the effects of C60 on the photovoltaic properties of PSCs were investigated.89The synthesis, structure, electrochemistry and photodynamics of a difluoroborane azadipyrromethene–C60 dyad were studied. The study opens up a venue for utilisation of the dyed in light energy harvesting donor–acceptor systems.90Three new fullerene derivatives with one, two, and three PCBM units, respectively, were synthesised and their photovoltaic properties were investigated. The dumb-belled PCBM derivative showed better photovoltaic performance than PCBM, suggesting that the covalently linked fullerene aggregates are promising acceptor materials in solar cells.91Several water-soluble C60-porphyrin electron donor–acceptor conjugates that implement a redox-active architecture have been synthesised and their physicochemical properties were reported.92 The synthesis and photophysical properties of a series of novel C60–phthalocyanine–porphyrin triads and pentads were described.93 Newly designed zinc porphyrin–C60 dyads with segregated and alternately stacked donor–acceptor configurations were presented and demonstrated clear geometrical effects on optoelectronic outputs.94Up to 5.1% PCE from PSC based on a series of newly developed thieno-o-quinodimethane-C60 have been achieved.

The absorption and photoluminescence of the synthesised acceptor and its mixed films with different polymer donor materials were investigated, as well as its electrochemical property and electron mobility.101 The synthesis of C70 dihydronaphthyl-based bisadduct (NC70BA) as well as the photovoltaic performance in P3HT-based PSCs was described.1023 Endohedral fullerenesCurrent progress in the synthesis, extraction, isolation, and characterisation of EMFs, as well as their physiochemical properties and applications in electronics, photovoltaics, biomedicine, and materials science has been reviewed.103 The synthesis methods of EMFs focusing on the new synthetic routes of nitride clusterfullerenes, the extraction, separation and the intriguing molecular structures of EMFs were reviewed.104 An overall view of the effect of the encapsulated metal species on the exohedral reactivity of the carbon cages has been addressed and the differences between empty cage fullerenes and EMFs has been emphasised.105The latest findings of MRI imaging probes based on various gadofullerenes, including Gd@C60, Gd@C82 and Gd3N@C80 were presented.106The synthesis of endohedral fullerene H2O@C60 was achieved by opening, filling, and reclosing the carbon cage. It was found that the incarcerated water does not alter the structure of the cage, but it confers an appreciable dipole moment to the new entity with its intrinsically a polar carbon sphere.107 Open-form H2O@C60 and H2@C60 mononitroxide derivatives were synthesised and an array of isomers was detected by employing the 1H NMR spectrum of the corresponding endo-H2O/H2 moieties.108Supramolecular donor–acceptor systems composed of anionic sulfonated porphyrins and a cationic lithium ion encapsulated fullerene (Li+@C60) which are connected by using ionic and π–π interactions in a polar solvent were constructed.109 Preparation of EMFs containing lithium (Li@C60), as well as the synthesis, characterisation, and properties of its chemically oxidised derivative [Li+@C60][PF6−] have been described.110 Covalently organic derivatisation of [Li+@C60]PF6− to obtain Li+-encapsulated PCBM, [Li+@PCBM]PF6−, was described.

The purified product was characterised by different spectroscopic techniques.116 The reaction of a new carbide cluster EMF, Sc2C2@C2v(5)–C80 with adamantylidene carbene affords five isolable monoadducts isomers whose structures and properties are fully characterised.117 The electrosynthetic method has been used for the preparation of Sc3N@Ih-C80 methano derivatives from Sc3N@Ih-C80 trianion.118 The synthesis, isolation and spectroscopic characterisation of holmium-based mixed metal nitride clusterfullerenes HoxSc3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2) have been described.119 Isomeric [5,6]- and [6,6]-azafulleroids were obtained from the thermal reaction of Sc3N@Ih-C80 with 4-isopropoxyphenyl azide, while photoirradiation leads exclusively to the [6,6]-azafulleroid. An unprecedented thermal interconversion between the two isomeric azafulleroids has also been discovered.120 The preparation and isolation of the mixed-metal EMF, LaSc2N@Ih-C80, and its structural characterisation by single-crystal XRD were described.121 Detailed electrochemical and electron spin resonance spectroelectrochemical studies of Sc4O2@C80 were reported.122 The first example of a reaction of Lu3N@Ih-C80 with a thermally generated silylene was described.

These isomers were characterised by single-crystal XRD.127The size and shape of isolated yttrium carbide clusters in different fullerene cages have been studied. A family of diyttrium EMFs with the general formula of Y2C2n (n = 40–59) were reported.128Rapid and efficient separation–purification of pure metallofullerenes Mx@Cn (M = metal; x = 1, 2; n > 70) and carbide metallofullerenes of the type MyC2@Cn−2 (y = 2, 3, 4; n − 2 > 68) that uses TiCl4–Lewis acid has been reported.129DFT calculations were carried out to determine the structural and electronic properties of C4H4@C70 (ref. 130) and La@C72, La@C74 and La@C76 isomers with IPR and non-IPR cages.1314 Applications of fullerene derivativesThe recent trends in fullerene chemistry in context to antimicrobial, neuroprotection, photochemical, antioxidant nature, diagnostic drug delivery, enzyme inhibition, fluorescence, catalytic, purification, radioprotection, biomaterial application, quantitative measurements and sensor technology have been reviewed.132 Preparation, characterisation, biological activities and clinical perspectives of water-soluble derivatives of fullerene were reviewed.133,134Chemical methods for target-selective photodegradation of various biomacromolecules, including DNA, proteins, HIV-1 protease and carbohydrates using designed and synthesised fullerene derivatives have been developed.135,136 The in vitro influence of polyhydroxy-C60 and N-ethyl-polyamino-C60 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals, angling their effect on proliferation, expression of surface markers, and cytokine production has been analysed.137 The effects of two fully characterised C60 derivatives, C60[C(COOH)2]3 and C60(NH2)x(OH)y, have been investigated on the BL of humanized Gaussia luciferase for the first time. It was demonstrated that water soluble C60 carboxyl derivatives could be exploited in BL assays138 and inhibit effectively herpesviral infections in cell cultures.139The PDT effects of three water-soluble C60 derivatives were evaluated on HeLa human cervix uteri tumor-derived cell line. The results suggest that derivatives have the potential application in cancer cell inactivation by PDT.140 Glycol chitosan-grafted-C60 conjugates were developed for use in PDT of tumor cells. These conjugates exhibited an advanced capacity for C60 solubilisation, the photodynamic tumor cell ablation, and to carry C60 in the body.141 Novel water-soluble decacationically armed C60 and C70 decaiodide monoadducts, C60- and C70[>M(C3N6+C3)2], were synthesised, characterised, and applied as photosensitisers and potential nano-PDT agents against pathogenic bacteria and cancer cells.142 It was demonstrated for the first time that a CD derivative bearing primary amino groups at the primary face acts as a smart carrier of non-substituted hydrophobic C60 to the slightly acidic cancer cells. Consequently, the efficient uptake of C60 exhibited excellent photodynamic activity against cancer cells.143 It has been found that a highly water-soluble, non-ionic malonodiserinolamide-derivatised C60 has a potential nanovector to deliver biologic and cancer drugs across biological barriers, including malignant liver tumors and brain.144The molecular interactions between fullerenols or nano-C60 and bacterial cells and their impacts on the biochemical activities of the fermenting bacterium Z. Mobilis were studied.145The efficacy of C70-tetraglycolateate for the treatment of asthma was reported. It was found that C70 derivative treated mice have significantly reduced airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and bronchoconstriction.146C60–polyamine conjugates were synthesised, evaluated for their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity and their cytotoxicity was determined. Members of this family of compounds showed interesting anti-lipid peroxidation, anti-lipoxygenase and anti-inflammatory activity and comparable cytocompatibility to spermidine.147A water-soluble α-CD–C60 conjugate with a flexible linker at the secondary face of alpha-cyclodextrin has been prepared. It displays high activity for blocking hepatitis C virus entry with IC50 at 0.17 μM.148 The synthesis, characterisation and DNA binding studies of a series of highly water soluble dendrofulleropyrrolidine bisadducts were reported.149It has been shown that oral administration of C60 dissolved in olive oil at reiterated doses to rats not only does not entail chronic toxicity but it almost doubles their lifespan.150Perylenebisimide–C60 dyads with strong absorption of visible light, a long-lived triplet excited state and efficient intramolecular energy transfer were prepared. The dyads were used as an 1O2 sensitizer for photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxyl naphthalene.151 Visible light-harvesting C60–organic chromophore dyads were devised as a general molecular structure motif for heavy atom-free organic triplet photosensitisers, which can be used for photocatalysis, PDT, and triplet–triplet annihilation upconversions.152Novel spherical Pd@Cys-C60 nanoparticles via an in situ spontaneous reduction process have been prepared. A nonenzymatic electrochemical biosensor was developed for the detection of glucose based on the spherical nanoparticles film.153 Haemoglobin biosensors based on polyhydroxylated fullerene derivatives were constructed through layer-by-layer assembly.154The superconducting behaviours of newly synthesised KxC60 nanowhiskers in comparison to those of K3C60 crystals were reported. The lattice structures were also discussed based on XRD analyses.155 A new air-stable n-type dopant, 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dimethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-3-ium iodide, for vacuum-processed organic thin films was synthesised and employed as a strong n-type dopant for C60, a well-known n-channel semiconductor.156Ethyl cellulose–C60 hybrid membranes with different C60 contents were prepared and investigated for the sulfur removal efficiency from the model gasoline. The effect of adding C60 on the desulfurisation mechanism was investigated.157The effects of C60 bisadduct regioisomers on solar cell performance have been examined for the first time and the two substituent positions on C60 have been found to have a large impact on the solar cell performance.158The effect of small additives of fullerene black (from 0.01 to 1 wt%) on the antifriction and anti-wear properties of a steel–steel pair lubricated with mineral oil under boundary friction was studied.159A facile approach to fabricate high quality graphene films from a non-toxic fullerene on metal substrates has been developed.160List of abbreviationsBHJbulk heterojunctionBLbioluminescenceCDcyclodextrinDFTdensity functional theoryEMFsendohedral metallofullerenesFT-IRfourier transformer infraredHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyIPRisolated pentagon ruleLUMOlowest unoccupied molecular orbitalsMALDI-TOFmatrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flightMRImagnetic resonance imageNACEnon-aqueous capillary electrophoresisNMRnuclear magnetic resonanceOPVoligophenylenevinylenePMDETApentamethyldiethylenetriaminePCBM[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl esterPCEpower conversion efficiencyPDTphotodynamic therapyP3HTpoly(3-hexylthiophene)PSCpolymer solar cellROSreactive oxygen speciesXRDX-ray diffractionUV-Visultra violet-visibleReferencesA.
