    , Accepted 26th December 2018First published on 27th December 2018AbstractNon-fullerene small molecular acceptors (NFSMAs) exhibit promising photovoltaic performance; however, their electron mobilities are still relatively lower than those of fullerene derivatives. The construction of a highly planar conjugated system is an important strategy to achieve high charge mobility. In chemical parlance, it is tedious and costly to synthesize planar compounds by restricting the rotation at a specific bond. Recently, nonbonding intramolecular interactions, also termed “conformational locks,” have been considered as an alternative way to achieve planar geometry. The successful implementation of this approach for designing polymers has been extensively reported. Recently, several examples of NFSMAs containing conformational locks have been presented in the literature. This situation encourages us to perform a detailed theoretical investigation in designing planar small molecular acceptors. Various nonbonding interactions were studied using accurate computational methods, and molecules with multiple nonbonding interactions showed high planarity. Planar acceptors showed red-shifted absorption with high oscillator strengths. In addition, backbone planarity plays a very important role in tuning the charge transport properties and decreasing reorganization energy. Our results could provide important information to guide the further design of promising NFSMA materials.
1. Introduction
In solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type organic solar cells (OSCs), the active layer consists of a p-type material as the electron donor and an n-type material as the electron acceptor. In the early years, polymer donors and fullerene acceptors formed the predominant material combination. Different polymer donors were designed to pair with fullerene acceptors, such as ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM))1 and ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM2)). This combination led to significant improvements in device performances with the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 11%.3 Fullerene derivatives have remained unbeatable for a long time due to their unique properties, namely, high electron-withdrawing ability and high electron mobility due to their three-dimensional structure.4 Furthermore, fullerenes can easily form optimal blend morphologies with p-type polymers under suitable film fabrication conditions.5 Despite these beneficial properties, fullerene derivatives possess non-ignorable disadvantages. Their absorption ability in the visible region is limited, the chemical modification at their backbone is difficult, and their low structural flexibility deters the realization of desirable electronic/optical properties. Lastly, their poor photostability is also a big problem for the application in OSCs.6
Recently, non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (NFSMAs) have gained increasing attention. They possess unique characteristics such as easy and cheap syntheses, structurally tunable electrochemical properties, optical complementarity, and energetic compatibility with donor polymers.7,8 The photovoltaic performance of these acceptors has increased sharply with the PCE ranging from 6.8% in 20159 to >14% in 2018.10
It is well known that a planar and extended conjugated structure is an important strategy to increase charge mobility. In traditional approaches, rotation around single bonds was restricted by connecting neighboring aromatic rings through covalent bonds to increase planarity. However, such synthesis approaches generally necessitate several steps, which become tedious and costly. Very recently, attention has been diverted toward noncovalent intramolecular interactions named as “noncovalent conformational locks” to achieve extended π-electron systems with high planarity and rigidity. Basically, the dihedral angle between two units of molecules strongly affects the conjugation and a small dihedral angle could increase the conjugation strength and planarity. Because the molecular geometry strongly influences intermolecular packing and charge mobility, the photovoltaic performance can always be improved by noncovalent interactions.11
Noncovalent conformational locks have been successfully used to control conformational motion and achieve highly planar semiconductors.12–17 For example, S⋯X (X = O,17 N,18 and halide19), Se⋯O,13 and traditional hydrogen bonding20 have been used to achieve a rigid conjugated system by locking conformations and improving charge transport. Wei's group synthesized S⋯O locked polymers; OSCs based on this polymer exhibited PCEs of 8.2%, which is much higher than the PCE of OSCs based on an analogous polymer without conformation locks.17 Yu and co-workers reported high hole mobility (5.37 cm2 V−1 s−1) for semiconducting copolymers with S⋯O and O⋯H noncovalent conformational locks.16 Bo et al. reported the synthesis of planar acceptor indacenodithiophene (IDT)-BOC6 with S⋯O and O⋯H noncovalent conformation locks. IDT-BOC6-based devices exhibited higher performance (9.6%) than that of unlocked IDT-BC6-based ones (2.3%).11 Huang et al. synthesized the small molecular acceptor (IDT-4CN) that is highly planar due to the presence of multiple noncovalent interactions (N⋯S, C–H⋯O, and C–H⋯N). IDT-4CN-based BHJ OSCs exhibited PCE of 8.13%.21
Nonbonding interactions strongly affect the molecular backbone planarity, intermolecular packing, film morphology, and photovoltaic performance. Therefore, it is worthwhile to employ theoretical analysis to select materials for photovoltaic applications, as well as design new materials by controlling the dihedral degrees of freedom. Increasing computer speeds and the improving capability of computational software are facilitating the use of computational science for material design. This is the key to designing planar molecules that can enhance conjugation, improve light absorption, and promote charge transport properties.22,23
In the present study, we have designed a series of non-fullerene acceptors (1–20, Fig. 1). IDT was used as the intermediate donor unit. Its rigid and coplanar structure is considered to facilitate electron delocalization and charge transport.24–27 2-(1,1-Dicyanomethylene)rhodamine (RCN) was used as the terminal electron-withdrawing unit.28–30 This study is based on the testing of various noncovalent interactions to align donors and acceptors in-plane through spatial interactions. Several types of pi-spacers were inserted between the donor and acceptor units to analyze the viability of different types of interactions. The strengths of these interactions were also calculated. Further, detailed calculations were performed to analyze the impact of backbone planarity on the electronic, photochemical, and charge transport properties.

2. Theoretical models
Charge transport properties play a very important role to improve the performance of organic photovoltaic materials. However, the theoretical predication of charge transport properties is not easy for both short-ranged and fast processes. The mobility of electrons and holes can be described by using two extremely different mechanisms: coherent band mechanisms and incoherent hopping models. In the former, the charge transport between neighboring molecules through bands can be attributed to overlapping molecular orbitals. However, in the latter, charge transfer takes place between neighboring coupled molecules.
The hopping model is considered to be suitable for studying OSCs because of their weak intermolecular interactions. In our study, reorganization energies are larger than the transfer integrals. We have adopted the hopping model to predict charge mobility. In the hopping framework, charge carriers pass through the organic layer by jumping between neighboring molecules. The following reactions describe the hole and electron transfers, respectively: M + M+ → M + M+(1) M + M− → M + M−(2)Here, M, M+, and M− denote the neutral molecule, cation, and anion, respectively. In the hopping regime, carrier mobility μ can be calculated using Einstein relation: (3)In the above equation, kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electron charge, and D is the diffusion coefficient. D can be expressed by using the following equation. (4)Here, n = 3 is the space dimensionality, i represents a specific hopping pathway, ri is the hopping distance, ki is the hopping rate of the charge carrier on the ith pathway, and Pi is the relative probability for charge carrier hopping to a particular ith neighbor.
Further, Marcus–Hush theory is used to describe the charge hopping (K) rate.31 (5)Here, λ is the reorganization energy, t is the transfer integral, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. As our designed molecules are electron-accepting materials, we have only predicted the reorganization energy for electron (λ−) transport, which can be calculated using the following equation. λ− = E0(Q−) − E0(Q0) + E−(Q0) − E−(Q−)(6)where E0(Q0) and E−(Q−) are the energies of the optimized neutral and anionic structures, respectively. E0(Q−) denotes the energy of a neutral molecule calculated at anion geometry, and E−(Q0) is the energy of the anion calculated at neutral geometry.
The charge transport integral is an important index when investigating the organic charge transport process. It can be calculated using various numerical methods such as band-fitting method, site-energy correction method, and direct coupling method. These three methods have been widely used. Among them, the direct coupling method has been proven to be a more accurate and low-cost approach to estimate the transport integral. In terms of this scheme, the transport integral between the neighboring monomers can be directly expressed as32,33 t = 〈ϕ0,site1i|F0|ϕ0,site2j〉(7)where ϕ0,site1i and ϕ0,site2j represent the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO) of isolated molecules 1 and 2, respectively. F is the Fock operator (F = SCεC−1) of the dimer with a density matrix from the non-interacting dimer, where S is the intermolecular overlap matrix and C and ε are the molecular orbital coefficient and energy from one-step diagonalization without iteration, respectively. The transfer integral for electrons (te) is half the energy difference between the LUMO and LUMO+1 of the dimer.
3. Computational details
Density functional theory (DFT) is the most extensively used computational tool to study organic materials.34–39 It has been used to study conformations and inter-ring rotational barriers. DFT is considered to be a worthwhile method for the accurate determination of ground-state geometry optimization and properties. To study noncovalent interactions, it is insufficient as it has a bias toward planarity. This error, termed the self-interaction error, results in incorrect data for the delocalization of the wavefunction.40,41 Overly planar structures were reported in previous studies due to artificially large torsional barriers.42–46 Second-order Moller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) (which does not suffer from SIE) is reported to be a reliable method for calculating barrier heights and relative conformational energies.42,47–49 The molecular structures were optimized at the MP2/cc-pVTZ. MP2 with a sufficiently large basis set (cc-pVTZ) is a better choice to study long-range dispersion and hydrogen-bonding interactions.50,51 To save on computational cost and simplifying calculations, branched alkyl chains in the molecular backbone were repacked with methyl groups because of their insignificant influence on the frontier molecular orbitals and optoelectronic properties of molecules.52 Frequency calculations were performed on these geometries to confirm the success of geometry optimization.
To predict the crystal structures of the designed molecules, the polymorph module of the Materials Studio 8.0 software was used.53 Common space groups such as P, P212121, C2/c, Cc, P21, P21/c, and Pna21 were tested. These space groups characterize 68% of all the known organic compounds.54 Details involving the calculation of transfer integral, reorganization energy, electron mobility, and other properties are provided in the ESI.†
4. Results and discussion
The main goal of this study is to understand the impact of noncovalent interactions on the geometry and physiochemical behavior of NFSMAs. The diversity of nonbonding interactions results in unique behaviors among these molecules.
4.1. Effect of noncovalent interactions on geometry
Obviously, the chemical structure plays a very important role in influencing electrochemical properties. A small structural change in the donor or acceptor can significantly influence the performance of OSCs; here, noncovalent interactions were used to rigidify the molecule. We designed a series of small molecular acceptors, and different noncovalent interactions were studied. The optimized geometries of the small molecules of 1–20 are shown in Fig. 2–5.

Theoretical analyses indicate that S⋯O interactions were sufficiently strong to ensure crystal structure conformations.55,56 In the present study, we have used S⋯O interactions to control the conformational rotation and achieve planar SMAs for OSCs. The optimized geometries are shown in Fig. 2–5, where the O⋯S distance and torsional angles for specific bonds are given. The calculated results indicate that 1 and 4 are highly planar, but the planarity of 2 is slightly lower than those of 1 and 4 because the terminal acceptor unit is out-of-plane by 5°. In the case of 2, the O⋯S distance between the oxygen of the terminal acceptor and sulfur of the pi-spacer is 3.12 Å, which is larger than those for 1 and 4 (2.79 Å and 2.78 Å, respectively). For 3, the absence of nonbonding interactions between the pi-spacer and terminal acceptor led the terminal acceptor to go out-of-plane. For 5, the donor unit and terminal acceptor unit are connected through carbon–carbon double bonds having oxygen on the trans positions, and noncovalent interactions are insufficient to control the strong rotational tendency of the carbon–carbon double bond. In addition, there is no interaction between the pi-spacer and terminal acceptor.
The torsion angle (θ) is fairly indicative of the relative strength of noncovalent interactions;57 a small θ value for different bonds of molecules indicates that these interactions are forcing the aromatic rings to become coplanar. With regard to acceptors 6–10, they are highly planar due to the presence of multiple noncovalent interactions. In the case of acceptors 11 and 13, the terminal electron-deficient groups are out-of-plane due to the absence of noncovalent interactions. For 11, oxygen in the terminal unit as well as fluorine in the pi-spacer are electronegative atoms; therefore, nonbonding space interactions cannot operate. This phenomenon also occurs in the case of acceptor 13. Differently, small molecules of 12, 14, and 15 are highly planar due to the presence of multiple strong noncovalent interactions.
It is worth noting that DPP-based molecule 17 is planar, while DPP-based molecule 18 is not planar. The absence of a thiophene group between the DPP and terminal acceptor in 18 hinders noncovalent interactions and leads the terminal acceptor to move out-of-plane. If we compare 17 and 18, the presence of additional S⋯O interactions between the S of thiophene and O of terminal electron-deficient 17 makes it planar; otherwise, the other interactions are the same in both these molecules. In the case of acceptor 19, only O⋯S interactions are present between the donor and pi-spacer, with θ = 25°; however, double C–H⋯O and C–H⋯S interactions operate between the pi-spacer and terminal acceptor: in this case, θ = 5°. With regard to 20, the torsion angle between IDT and difluorobenzotriazole is 5° due to the presence of N⋯S (2.90 Å) and CH⋯S (2.15 Å), but the torsion angle between difluorobenzotriazole and thiophene is 40° due to weak interactions (N⋯S, 3.22 Å). We can conclude that the geometry of the molecule is controlled by both strength and number of interactions.
Here, an important fact is that molecules with strong noncovalent interactions always show high planarity, while molecules with weak interactions are less planar. Further, it is important to provide a comparison of the strengths of all the interactions.
4.2. Electronic properties
The calculation of the basic structural and electronic properties is the first step in theoretical modeling. HOMOs and LUMOs are extensively studied parameters. They are considered as the band structure of organic semiconductors. In semiconductor technology, bandgap (Eg) engineering is extensively used to achieve desired electronic and physical properties. Any deviation from backbone planarity due to rotations about single bonds decreases the conjugation and increases bandgaps. Planar molecules showed a low bandgap, which primarily results from the high-lying HOMO levels (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  HOMO, LUMO, and bandgap of the designed acceptors (planar and nonplanar acceptors are indicated by green and red colors, respectively). 
4.3. UV-visible spectra
Molecular geometry also plays a very important role in changing the position and shape of the absorption spectra. Generally, planar molecules show higher light-harvesting abilities than their nonplanar analogues. It is well known that coplanarity between the donor and acceptor enhances resonance interactions. Because the visible and near-infrared regions retain most of the solar energy, the absorption spectra of organic semiconductors should extend to this region to harvest the maximum amount of energy. Obviously, the bandgap of molecules determines the absorption range: low bandgap molecules can absorb more photons. The calculated absorption spectra of these acceptors are given in Fig. S1–S4 (ESI†), while the absorption wavelength, oscillator strength, and transition configurations are given in Table 1. Highly planar molecules showed red-shifted absorption with large oscillator strength. The transition from the ground state S0 to the first excited state S1 is a major transition for most acceptors. Only in the case of acceptors 6 and 18, the transition from S0 to S2 is a major transition. In the early period of OSC research, sunlight absorption was mainly determined by the donor materials because fullerene acceptors exhibit negligible absorption abilities. Recently, it was proven that non-fullerene acceptors could be fine-tuned to absorb more solar light than donor materials. Therefore, non-fullerene acceptors with absorption capabilities in the visible and IR regions will succeed fullerene derivatives. The λmax values of acceptors 10, 15, and 16 could exceed 1000 nm; however, these bandgaps are too low (near to 1) for OSC applications. Shockley and Queisser indicated that the optimal bandgap is around 1.3 eV, which can provide balanced Voc and Jsc values to achieve optimal device performance.58 Brabec et al. showed that donor polymers with bandgaps of around 1.35–1.65 eV can achieve PCE > 10%.59 Non-fullerene acceptors with bandgaps close to 1.5 eV and absorption maxima near 900 nm might be a worthwhile choice.

Here, it is noteworthy that a conjugated system significantly contributes to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Any deviation from coplanarity hinders their charge transfer interactions and decreases light-absorption ability. Therefore, a planar structure increases the excited-state charge transfer processes and extinction coefficients over an extended range of the solar spectrum. Noncovalent interactions can be used to tune the absorption spectra of non-fullerene acceptors to achieve complementarity with the donor spectrum.
4.4. Charge transport
The charge transport property plays an important role in improving the photovoltaic performance of materials, and efficient charge transport is essential to achieve high PCE. It is necessary that charges move through molecules without getting trapped and scattered. Several factors influence charge carrier mobilities, such as packing behavior, temperature, presence of impurities, electric field, and size/molecular weight. Theoretically, it is too formidable to study all these parameters. Further, it is complicated to assume that the theoretical mobility is equivalent to experimentally obtained thin-film mobility because a single-crystal structure is considerably different from the real packing behavior of thin films. However, theoretical results can easily provide rough estimates in a lesser time frame even before the synthesis of compounds. Low mobilities generally decrease the performance of OSCs due to high charge recombination and resistive losses.

4.4.1. Molecular packing. 
Crystal structures were predicted by using the polymorph module of Materials Studio 8.0 software. Space groups with the lowest total energies were used to calculate the transfer integral. The calculated crystal cell parameters of the compounds under investigation with the lowest total energies are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). When predicting packing, only the parameters of the unit cells are optimized. The structural parameters of the molecules are maintained constant, i.e., molecules are assumed to be rigid bodies. The selection criterion of the crystal structure for further modeling is low lattice energy.
In order to understand charge hopping behavior, we performed calculations on the dimers of the molecules under different packing motifs. These predictions allowed us to examine the rate of charge hopping of the carriers toward molecules. To calculate the t value of two adjacent molecules, the dimers of 1a and 2a are constructed using experimental parameters of crystalline lattices 1a and 2a, respectively.25,26 The geometrical parameters of the monomers are obtained from computations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level.


4.4.2. Transfer integral. 
The orientations and packing characteristics of molecules influence charge transport. Generally, large planarity and pi-conjugated system, as well as strong intermolecular interactions, are considered to be necessary to achieve high charge transport mobility. The transfer integral is sensitive to the relative position of molecules in the solid state.60 In the framework of a dimeric model, it is important to understand the relative position of joint molecular pairs. The predicted crystal structures were used to determine possible charge hopping channels, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S5 (ESI†).
 Fig. 7  Schematic diagram of the main charge hopping channels selected on the basis of crystal structures for all the molecules under investigation. 
The values of the transfer integral for different hopping channels are listed in Table 2. The values for most of these channels are exceedingly small. Further, it is noteworthy that the transfer integrals for different hopping pathways are significantly different, which indicates anisotropic electron transport behavior.

4.4.3. Reorganization energies and electron mobilities. 
Reorganization energy strongly influences charge transfer. It is accepted that a lower value of reorganization energy leads to higher charge transfer rate.61,62 We have calculated the reorganization energies required for electron transfer, and the results are listed in Table 3. Planar molecules showed lower reorganization energies than their nonplanar analogues. The relationship between the dihedral angle and reorganization energy for 6 and 16 is shown in Fig. 8. The rotation about the single bond between the donor and pi-spacer is selected. Reorganization energy was low at a small torsion angle; then, it started to increase up to θ = 90° and then slowly started to decrease. We have also plotted the reorganization energy as a function of bandgaps: there is no direct relationship between these parameters. The R2 value is very low (0.30): a value higher than 0.85 indicates a strong relationship between the two parameters (Fig. 9).

 Fig. 8  Reorganization energy as a function of rotation around the carbon–carbon single bond between the donor and pi-spacer units. 
 Fig. 9  Reorganization energy as a function of bandgap. 
It is important to recall that reorganization energy is larger than the maximum transfer integral. Therefore, the Marcus–Hush model is a suitable choice to explain the localized description of charge transfer. The calculated electron mobilities are listed in Table 3. Evidently, planar molecules showed higher electron mobilities than their nonplanar analogues. High electron mobility of 6 is due to the lower reorganization energy resulting from the high polarizability of the sulfur atom in thiophene rings63 and stronger electron affinity because of the presence of fluorine.64
This study can pave the way for experimental scientists to synthesize efficient small molecular acceptors. It is possible to shortlist the potential candidates on the basis of planarity, HOMO, LUMO, bandgap, absorption profile, and charge transport properties (Table S2, ESI†).

5. Conclusion
Noncovalent interactions are the key driving force to rigidify the molecular backbone and tune bandgaps. We have analyzed various noncovalent interactions and compared their relative strengths. Hydrogen-bonding interactions were stronger than the other interactions. In most of the cases, conformational locks were successful to realize planar geometry. In addition, these interactions have a strong impact on the energy levels and absorption behavior, and the absorption spectra red-shifted with an increase in conjugation resulting from higher planarity. Oscillator strength (f), which indirectly indicates the light-absorption ability, was high for planar molecules. Planar molecules showed lower reorganization energy and higher electron mobility as compared to their nonplanar analogues. As a concluding remark, we can say that noncovalent interactions are responsible for the modification of the conformation of small molecules, as well as influence the physical and chemical properties of molecules.
