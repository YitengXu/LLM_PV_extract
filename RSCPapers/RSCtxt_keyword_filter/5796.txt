    , Accepted 20th March 2015First published on 23rd March 2015AbstractA series of D–(π)–A′–π–A featured organic dyes with different numbers of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridges and different anchoring groups, i.e., cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid, have been designed and synthesized for application in quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The absorption, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties are systematically investigated. Upon the incorporation of an auxiliary EDOT unit into sensitizers FNE60 and FNE61 with D–A′–π–A configuration, sensitizers FNE62 and FNE63 with D–π–A′–π–A configuration exhibit much broader absorption spectra, which is beneficial to the light-harvesting capability and photocurrent generation. When the cyanoacrylic acid group in sensitizers FNE60 and FNE62 is replaced by a much stronger electron-withdrawing group, rhodanine-3-acetic acid, strengthened intramolecular charge transfer interactions are realized, which results in the significantly bathochromically shifted maximum absorption wavelengths for sensitizers FNE61 and FNE63. However, the methylene group in the rhodanine-3-acetic acid unit interrupts the LUMO delocalization on the anchoring group in sensitizers FNE61 and FNE63, as revealed by theoretical calculation, which may result in less effective electron injection from the LUMO to the conduction band of the titania semiconductor. Consequently, the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on FNE62 exhibits a highest power conversion efficiency of 8.2%, which illustrates good long-term stability after continuous light soaking for 1000 h.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1 regarded as one of the most promising photovoltaic devices, have been extensively investigated due to their high theoretical efficiency, facile fabrication processes, and potential low cost. Undoubtedly, the sensitizers are considered as one of the key components in these cells since they absorb sunlight, thereby injecting excited electrons into the conduction band of nanostructured/porous titania, and then are regenerated by the electrolyte. In the past two decades, organometallic dyes of ruthenium polypyridine have been demonstrated as light-harvesters for highly efficient DSSCs, such as N7192 and black dye,3 which have become the most representative DSSC sensitizers with overall power conversion efficiencies (η) of over 11%. Recently, zinc-porphyrin dyes have been developed as promising candidates for DSSCs due to their efficient light-harvesting capability and tunable spectral properties and energetics.4 Impressively, the DSSC based on the porphyrin sensitizer SM315 have reaped an efficiency record of 13.0% without the assistance of any co-sensitizer.5 However, in view of the limited ruthenium resource and the complicated synthetic procedure for porphyrin dyes, it is desirable to develop metal-free organic dyes6 for the upcoming large-scale application of cost-effective DSSCs due to their unique advantages, such as high molar-extinction coefficients, low synthetic and purification cost, tunable photophysical properties via molecular engineering, and essentially no resource limitation. Most recently, considerable efforts have been made to develop metal-free organic dyes and impressive efficiencies in the range of 10–12% have been achieved.7 However, most highly efficient DSSCs have been realized with volatile organic liquid electrolytes, which have a drastic effect on the long-term stability of DSSCs and limit their outdoor applications. To overcome such shortcoming, alternative non-volatile ionic liquids or non-flowing (quasi-)solid-state electrolytes8 have been utilized in DSSCs and demonstrated greatly improved long-term stability for potential applications in DSSCs. Therefore, concerning the promising outdoor applications, highly efficient and stable DSSCs with non-liquid electrolytes are still required.
Open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc) are two fundamental parameters for the DSSC performance. To improve the value of the latter parameter, it is essential to expand the absorption spectrum of the organic sensitizer meanwhile maintaining suitable energy levels. The simplest way for lowering down the sensitizer band gap is to strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions in the organic dye with D–π–A configuration. Recently, we have incorporated auxiliary electron donor (D′) and electron acceptor (A′), respectively, into D–π–A featured organic dyes and found that D–A′–π–A configuration is superior to the D–D′–π–A one in bathochromically shifting the sensitizer absorption spectrum, enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency, and improving the photocurrent and device efficiency.9 Meanwhile, an electron-deficient group, such as benzothiadiazole,10 diketopyrrolopyrrole,11 and pyrazine derivatives,12 has been integrated as an auxiliary acceptor (A′) to construct a novel D–(π)–A′–π–A framework by several groups. The relationship between the chemical structure of the auxiliary acceptor A′ and the photophysical and photovoltaic properties of the related sensitizer has been systematically investigated. However, few studies have been carried out to optimize the other moieties in the D–(π)–A′–π–A framework.13 In this contribution, other building blocks, such as the π bridge and the anchoring groups, are adjusted on a quinoxaline based organic sensitizer to tune the related photophysical and photovoltaic properties. Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT),14 one of the most popular building blocks in organic semiconductors, is utilized as the π-conjugation bridge and two types of organic sensitizers with D–A′–π–A (FNE60 and FNE61) and D–π–A′–π–A (FNE62 and FNE63) frameworks have been constructed, as shown in Fig. 1. For comparison, our previously reported sensitizer FNE4612j is included as reference. It is found that the D–π–A′–π–A configuration is superior to the D–A′–π–A configuration in expanding the absorption spectrum and enhancing the light-harvesting capability and photocurrent generation. In addition, a much stronger electron withdrawing group, rhodanine-3-acetic acid,15 is incorporated as an anchoring group instead of the traditional cyanoacrylic acid group. Although a significant bathochromic shift can be observed in the absorption maxima of sensitizers FNE61 and FNE63, the related quasi-solid-state DSSCs exhibit less effective electron injection. Consequently, the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on D–π–A′–π–A featuring sensitizer FNE62 with cyanoacrylic acid as the anchoring group exhibits a highest power conversion efficiency of 8.2% with good long-term stability after continuous light soaking.

Characterization

1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were measured on a Varian Mercury Plus-400 spectrometer. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet); d (doublet); t (triplet); m (multiplet). UV-vis absorption spectra of the dyes were measured in toluene solutions and on TiO2 films on a Shimadzu UV-2550PC spectrophotometer. The film thickness was measured by a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 150). Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed on a CHI604D electrochemical workstation using a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in water-free acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon. A dye-adsorbed TiO2 film (0.25 cm2) on a conductive FTO glass was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated by ferrocene, and all potentials mentioned in this work are against the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).
DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
The working electrode was composed of a TiO2 nanoparticle (20 nm) film (active area 0.25 cm2) in direct contact with the FTO substrate. The films were sintered at 500 °C for 2 h to achieve good necking of neighboring TiO2 particles. The sintered films were then treated with 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. When TiO2 electrodes were cooled down at around 120 °C, the electrodes were dipped in dye solutions (0.3 mM in chloroform/ethanol, 7/3, v/v) with deoxycholic acid as coadsorbate for 24 h at room temperature for complete dye adsorption. The counter electrode was prepared by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution on an FTO plate and heating at 400 °C for 30 min. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm) and sealed together by pressing them under heat. A quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing 5% (wt%) poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) in a redox solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) under heating until all solids were dissolved. After introducing the hot gel solution into the internal space of the cell from the two holes predrilled on the back of the counter electrode, a uniform motionless polymer gel layer was formed between the working and the counter electrodes, and then the holes were sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat. The working performance of DSSCs was tested by recording the current density–voltage (J–V) curves with a Keithley 2400 source meter (Oriel) under the illumination of simulated AM 1.5G solar light produced by a solar simulator (Sol3A equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp and an AM 1.5G filter). The incident light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (Newport 91150). Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were obtained with an Oriel-74125 system (Oriel). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Oriel-71640). The electron lifetimes were measured with intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and charge densities at open-circuit were measured using a charge extraction technique. IMVS analysis and charge extraction were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT, Germany), which includes a white light emitting diode and the corresponding control system. The intensity modulated spectra were measured at room temperature with light intensity ranging from 20 to 120 W m−2, in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and with modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of sensitizers
As depicted in Scheme 1, the syntheses of all the sensitizers started from 5,8-dibromoquinoxaline (1),16 which was then converted to 5-bromo-8-(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)quinoxaline (2) via an asymmetrical Stille coupling18 with tributyl(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)stannane.17 After refluxing with a Vilsmeier reagent,19 the corresponding monoaldehyde-substituted derivative 3 was obtained. A further Suzuki coupling20 with N,N-bis(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)aniline afforded the precursor 4. Herein, octyloxy substituted triarylamine was incorporated instead of traditional triphenylamine due to the following consideration. Firstly, the two octyloxy substituents can ensure sufficient solubility of the target sensitizers in common organic solvents. Secondly, alkoxyl functionalized triarylamine is more electron-rich than triphenylamine, which may enlarge the ICT interactions and thus reduce the band gap. Finally, the introduced alkoxyl chains can effectively weaken the intermolecular aggregation and charge recombination during the DSSC operation, which is beneficial to reducing the current and voltage losses. However, it should be noted that for the synthesis of precursor 5, a two-step coupling with EDOT and further with N,N-bis(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)aniline on compound 3 was not straightforward due to the difficult functionalization of the EDOT derivative. Therefore, precursor 5 was alternatively obtained via a direct Stille coupling between the key intermediate compound 3 and N,N-bis(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-4-(7-(tributylstannyl)-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)aniline.9 In the last step, the two precursors obtained were converted to the four target sensitizers FNE60, FNE61, FNE62, and FNE63, respectively, by Knoevenagel condensation21 with cyanoacetic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid in the presence of piperidine. All the target dye sensitizers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy, and were found to be consistent with the proposed structures. The obtained dyes are black in solid state and can be dissolved in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, THF and toluene.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2) of sensitizers FNE60, FNE61, FNE62, and FNE63 in toluene solutions were measured at a concentration of ca. 10−5 M, and the corresponding photophysical data are listed in Table 1. It can be found that all the sensitizers exhibit two distinct absorption bands, which are similar to those of reference sensitizer FNE46.12j The absorption band in the visible region corresponds to the charge transfer between the electron donating unit and the electron withdrawing group, and the other one in the ultraviolet region can be assigned to the π–π* electron transition of the conjugated backbone. As shown in Fig. 2, sensitizer FNE60 exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength at 486 nm in toluene solution. Upon replacing the cyanoacetic acid in FNE60 with a stronger electron acceptor in FNE61, i.e., rhodanine-3-acetic acid, a dramatic bathochromic shift of 51 nm can be observed for the maximum absorption wavelength, which is obviously stemmed from the strengthened ICT interactions after introduction of rhodanine-3-acetic acid. When an auxiliary EDOT unit is inserted between the triarylamine and quinoxaline units in FNE60, sensitizer FNE62 displays the absorption maximum wavelength at 548 nm with a more significant bathochromic shift of 62 nm and increased molar extinction coefficient in comparison to that for sensitizer FNE60. It should be noted that a bathochromic shift of 23 nm can be observed as compared with reference sensitizer FNE46,12j which exhibits the absorption maximum at 525 nm in chloroform solution. Such a remarkable bathochromic shift is obviously due to the greater electron donating capability of the EDOT spacer as compared with the thiophene one. Moreover, when the cyanoacrylic acid unit in sensitizer FNE62 is replaced by the rhodanine-3-acetic acid unit, sensitizer FNE63 exhibited the maximum absorption wavelength at 583 nm with a bathochromic shift of 36 nm in comparison to that for sensitizer FNE62, which is similar to those for sensitizers FNE60 and FNE61. These results suggest that not only a stronger electron donating spacer but also a stronger electron acceptor contribute to reducing the sensitizer band gap and improving the light-harvesting properties. Moreover, in comparison to sensitizers FNE60 and FNE61 with D–A′–π–A configuration, sensitizers FNE62 and FNE63 with D–π–A′–π–A configuration exhibit bathochromically shifted absorption maxima by 62 and 47 nm, respectively, which indicates that the D–π–A′–π–A framework is superior to the D–A′–π–A configuration in expanding the absorption spectrum and enhancing the light-harvesting capability.

The UV-vis absorption spectra for the dye-loaded TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 3. Sensitizers FNE60, FNE61, FNE62, and FNE63 demonstrate the maximum absorption wavelengths at 469, 511, 531, and 562 nm, respectively, which displays the same trend as those in toluene solutions. A slight hypsochromic shift of 17, 26, 17, and 22 nm, respectively, can be found for the absorption maxima of dye-loaded TiO2 films in comparison to those for the dye solutions. Since no obvious shift can be observed for the maximum absorption wavelength of the sensitizers in different solution concentrations, such a hypsochromic shift for the absorption maxima is mainly due to the deprotonation effect after the dye molecules are anchored on nanocrystalline TiO2 films.12i,j,22 However, the hypsochromic shift is much smaller than those for D–π–A featured organic dyes,23 which is obviously due to the weakened deprotonation effect caused by the auxiliary quinoxaline acceptor. When the dye molecules are adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface, although the anchoring acid group is deprotonated, the charge transfer from the electron donor to the auxiliary quinoxaline moiety is not affected significantly and therefore only a slight hypsochromic shift can be observed for organic dyes with both D–A′–π–A and D–π–A′–π–A configurations.

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the possibility of the photo-generated electron injection and the sensitizer regeneration, cyclic voltammetry was performed in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell with the dye-loaded TiO2 film as the working electrode. Fig. 4 displays the cyclic voltammograms of the four sensitizers and it can be found that all the dyes display reversible oxidative curves, which correspond to the removal of electrons at the triarylamine moieties to form the stable radical cations. As shown in Fig. 4, sensitizer FNE60 displays a reversible anodic redox couple at the half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.94 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level. Upon the replacement of the cyanoacrylic acid in FNE60 by a rhodanine-3-acetic acid, a negatively shifted oxidation potential can be observed for sensitizer FNE61 (0.90 V). Moreover, when an EDOT unit is incorporated into the conjugation backbone of sensitizer FNE60, sensitizer FNE62 displays a negatively shifted oxidation potential at E1/2 = 0.78 V. Furthermore, upon replacing the cyanoacrylic acid in FNE62 by a rhodanine-3-acetic acid, sensitizer FNE63 exhibits a further negatively shifted oxidation potential at E1/2 = 0.75 V. It should be noted that both the EDOT unit and the rhodanine-3-acetic acid group can lift up the HOMO levels of the organic dyes. The lift contribution from the EDOT unit is higher than that from the rhodanine-3-acetic acid group. This can be attributed to the more delocalized HOMO after incorporation of the EDOT unit close to the triarylamine moiety. The HOMO values for all the sensitizers are much more positive than the redox potential for I−/I3− redox couples (∼0.4 V), indicating that the reduction of the oxidized dyes with I− ions is thermodynamically feasible.24 Then the LUMO energy level was estimated from eqn (1),25 LUMO = HOMO − ΔE(1)where ΔE is the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels and derived from the wavelength at 10% maximum absorption intensity for the dye-loaded TiO2 film.26 Correspondingly, the LUMO levels for sensitizers FNE60, FNE61, FNE62, and FNE63, are calculated to be −1.15, −0.98, −1.04 and −0.92 V, respectively. In comparison to the LUMO levels of FNE60 and FNE62, the positively shifted LUMO levels of FNE61 and FNE63, respectively, are obviously due to the introduction of a much stronger electron acceptor, rhodanine-3-acetic acid, instead of the cyanoacrylic acid unit. The LUMO values for all the sensitizers suggest that there is enough driving force for the electron injection from their excited states to the conduction band of TiO2 semiconductors.24

Theoretical approach
To have deep insight into the ground state geometry and electronic properties of the four organic dyes, density functional calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 03 program using the B3LYP method and 6-31G* basis set.27 As shown in the optimized conformation (Fig. 5), the dihedral angles between the quinoxaline unit and the neighbouring benzene ring in sensitizers FNE60 and FNE61 are calculated to be 38° and 37°, respectively, which are generalized observation for dihedral angles between the two benzene rings. While the dihedral angles between the quinoxaline unit and another neighbouring EDOT unit are calculated to be 4° and 3°, respectively. The values are much smaller than the dihedral angles (22° and 24°) between the quinoxaline unit and thiophene ring in sensitizer FNE46, which is probably due to the formation of hydrogen bond between the O atom in the EDOT unit and the H atom in the quinoxaline unit. However, when an auxiliary EDOT unit is incorporated between the triarylamine and quinoxaline, the dihedral angles between the benzene ring in the triarylamine moiety and the inserted EDOT unit in sensitizers FNE62 and FNE63 decrease to 21° and 19°, respectively, while the dihedral angles between the quinoxaline unit and the two neighbouring EDOT groups are calculated to be 2–4°. It should be noted that when an auxiliary EDOT unit is inserted between the triarylamine and quinoxaline in sensitizers FNE60 and FNE61 with D–A′–π–A configuration, a less twisted molecular structure can be observed for both sensitizers FNE62 and FNE63 with D–π–A′–π–A configuration. Therefore, in addition to the π-conjugation elongation upon the incorporation of the EDOT unit, a more delocalized π-conjugation can be realized in the D–π–A′–π–A featured organic sensitizers, which therefore results in the extended effective π-conjugation length and is consistent with significant differences in the absorption spectra in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 5  Optimized ground state geometry and related dihedral angles for the organic sensitizers. 

Fig. 6 shows the calculated frontier molecular orbitals of the found sensitizers. It can be clearly found that for all the sensitizers, the HOMOs mainly delocalize on the triarylamine moiety with extension to the bridged quinoxaline and EDOT moieties, while the LUMOs mainly delocalize over the two acceptors and the EDOT linker. The overlap of the HOMOs and LUMOs facilitates the charge transfer from the electron-donating center to the electron-withdrawing center. For sensitizers FNE60 and FNE62 with cyanoacrylic acid as anchoring groups, the LUMOs delocalize on the anchoring carboxylic acid moieties. Thus, upon excitation by sunlight, the excited electrons can easily transfer from the triarylamine center to the carboxylic acid group and further into TiO2. However, for sensitizers FNE61 and FNE63 with rhodanine-3-acetic acid as anchoring groups, the LUMOs delocalize on the rhodanine sulfur atom instead of the carboxylic acid moiety, which is probably due to the fact that the methylene group disrupts the π* conjugation between rhodanine and the carboxylic acid.28 Consequently, the excited electrons may not be effectively injected into the TiO2 electrode via the rhodanine-3-acetic acid group.

Solar cell performance
Quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the four sensitizers were fabricated with a polymer gel electrolyte containing 5% PVDF–HFP (w/w) in MPN. To achieve the best DSSC performance, the thickness of the TiO2 films, the content of tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in the electrolyte and deoxycholic acid (DCA) in the dye bath were optimized for FNE62 based quasi-solid-state DSSC since it provided the best performance in our initial measurement. Table 2 summarizes the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the quasi-solid-state DSSC (CTBP = 0.1 M, CDCA = 10 mM) based on sensitizer FNE62 loaded on mesoscopic TiO2 films with different thicknesses. It can be found that with the TiO2 film thickness increasing, the Jsc value increases gradually and peaked at 15 μm owing to the enhanced surface area which adsorbs more sensitizers, harvests more sunlight, and provides a higher photo-generated current.29 The Jsc value slightly decreases to 16.69 mA cm−2 on the 20 μm TiO2 film, which is due to slower electron diffusion and consequently a lower electron collection efficiency.29 However, on the other hand, the Voc value decreases with increasing thickness due to the augmentation of the surface area providing additional charge recombination sites and enhancing the dark current.29

To further investigate the relationship between the additive concentration and the quasi-solid-state DSSC performance, the content of the additive TBP in the electrolyte was also optimized (Table 3). When the concentration of TBP increases from 0 to 0.2 M, the Voc value increases slightly from 654 to 691 mV, which is consistent with the reported phenomenon30 and mainly attributed to the negative shift of the conduction band of TiO2 caused by the adsorption of TBP on the TiO2 surface. On the other hand, Jsc value increases from 16.88 to 17.59 mA cm−2 upon addition of 0.1 M TBP, probably owing to the reduced charge recombination rate, and then decreases to 14.31 mA cm−2 at 0.2 M TBP due to the reduction in the driving force for the electron injection from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor.

DCA is often utilized as a coadsorbate in the dye bath to suppress the dye aggregation, retard the charge recombination, and improve the DSSC performance. Therefore, the effect of the DCA content on the quasi-solid-state DSSC performance was investigated (Table 3). Upon coadsorption of DCA (10 mM), although the dye-loading amount of FNE62 decreases from 1.42 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 (0 mM DCA) to 0.96 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 (10 mM DCA), both the Voc and Jsc values significantly increase for FNE62 based quasi-solid-state DSSC. This is obviously stemmed from the coadsorption of the additive DCA, which reduces the charge recombination rate in the DSSCs. However, with further increasing of the DCA content, both the Voc and Jsc values dramatically decrease probably due to the lower dye adsorbed amount which further reduces to 0.62 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1.
Therefore, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE60–FNE63 were fabricated on a 15 μm thick photoanode with 0.1 M TBP in the electrolyte and 10 mM DCA in the dye bath as coadsorbate. Action spectra of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs are shown in Fig. 7. It can be found that FNE60 based quasi-solid-state DSSC displays a maximum IPCE of 75%. Upon the incorporation of an auxiliary EDOT unit into the π-conjugation bridge, the DSSC based on sensitizer FNE62 exhibits an increased IPCE maximum of 85% along with a significantly expanded photo-response range, which is obviously due to the bathochromic shift of the maximum absorption band of the FNE62 loaded TiO2 film compared with that for FNE60. However, upon replacing the cyanoacrylic acid in sensitizers FNE60 and FNE62 with rhodanine-3-acetic acid group, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on both FNE61 and FNE63 display much lower IPCE values with maximum below 50%. According to the formula (2):31 IPCE (λ) = LHE (λ) × Φinj × Φc(2)where LHE (λ) is the light-harvesting efficiency, Φinj is the electron injection efficiency, and Φc is the charge collection efficiency, since the LHE for the dye-loaded 15 μm thick TiO2 film is close to unity for all the three devices, the relatively low IPCE values for the DSSCs based on FNE61 and FNE63 are probably due to the low electron injection efficiency or charge collection efficiency. Although the driving force for the electron injection is sufficient, the methylene group interrupts the LUMO delocalization over the carboxylic acid, as revealed by the theoretical calculation, which reduces the electron injection efficiency or the charge collection efficiency and therefore dramatically lowers down the IPCE values. Compared with the IPCE spectrum of FNE61 based quasi-solid-state DSSC, the DSSC based on FNE63 displays a much broader IPCE spectrum obviously due to its bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum (Fig. 3). It can be concluded that the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE62 and FNE63 with D–π–A′–π–A configuration exhibit much wider photo-response range than those for the DSSCs based on FNE60 and FNE61 with D–A′–π–A configuration, respectively, which is beneficial to the photocurrent generation and power conversion efficiency.
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs. 
The photovoltaic performance of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs were evaluated under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G solar light and the J–V curves are displayed in Fig. 8. The quasi-solid-state DSSC based on FNE60 produces a Jsc of 13.97 mA cm−2 (Table 4). Upon the incorporation of an additional EDOT unit, sensitizer FNE62 based DSSC provides an improved Jsc of 17.59 mA cm−2, which is higher than the Jsc value (15.68 mA cm−2) for FNE46 based quasi-solid-state DSSC12j owing to the expanded photo-response range (Fig. 7). However, when the cyanoacrylic acid is replaced by rhodanine-3-acetic acid, although the absorption spectra of sensitizers FNE61 and FNE62 are broadened in comparison to those for sensitizers FNE60 and FNE62, respectively, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE61 and FNE63 produce a significantly decreased Jsc of 9.23 and 10.81 mA cm−2, respectively. The Jsc values exhibit an order of FNE61 < FNE63 < FNE60 < FNE62, which is consistent with the trend of the photo-generated current integrated from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 7). Correspondingly, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE60, FNE61, FNE62, and FNE63 offered a Voc of 656, 620, 682, and 641 mV, respectively, and a FF of 67%, 68%, 68%, and 70%, respectively, corresponding to an η of 6.1%, 3.9%, 8.2%, and 4.9%, respectively.

To further qualitatively investigate the Voc difference among the quasi-solid-state DSSCs, electron lifetime32 against charge density33 was evaluated since Voc is related to the charge recombination rate in DSSCs while electron lifetime is a judgment for the charge recombination of injected electrons with I3− in the electrolyte at open-circuit. The electron lifetime (τ) was calculated by eqn (3):34 τ = (2πfmin)−1(3)where fmin is the frequency at the top of the semicircle measured by intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS).35Fig. 9 shows the electron lifetimes of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the four organic dyes as a function of Q. It can be found that for all the quasi-solid-state DSSCs, electron lifetime decreases with increasing Q. At a fixed Q, the electron lifetime increases in the order of FNE61 < FNE63 < FNE60 < FNE62, which is consistent with the Voc trend shown in Fig. 8. The relatively shorter electron lifetimes for the DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE61 and FNE63 with rhodanine-3-acetic acid as the anchoring group may be due to the poor electron injection efficiency which has a negative effect on the competition process between the circuit current and dark current.28a Since a retarded charge recombination rate constant can reduce electron loss at open circuit, more charge is accumulated in TiO2. As a result, the Fermi level moves upward and the Voc values for the DSSCs based on FNE60 and FNE62 with cyanoacrylic acid groups get larger than those for the DSSCs based on FNE61 and FNE63 with rhodanine-3-acetic acid groups.
 Fig. 9  Electron lifetime as a function of electron density at open circuit for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs. 
Finally the stability of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulting sensitizers was recorded over a period of 1000 h under one sun soaking. Fig. 10 displays the photovoltaic performance parameters of sensitizer FNE62 based quasi-solid-state DSSC under sunlight soaking. It can be found that the Jsc, Voc, FF, and η values slightly changed within 5% of the initial value after 1000 h of one sun soaking, which indicates that the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on sensitizer FNE62 demonstrates good long-term stability.

Conclusions
In summary, four novel organic sensitizers with different numbers of EDOT bridges and different anchoring groups have been designed and synthesized. Either the incorporation of an auxiliary EDOT unit into sensitizer FNE60 with D–A′–π–A configuration, or the replacement of the thiophene bridge in sensitizer FNE46 by the EDOT unit, sensitizer FNE62 with D–π–A′–π–A configuration illustrates a much broader absorption spectrum, which contributes to the light-harvesting property and photocurrent generation. Further strengthened ICT interactions and bathochromically shifted absorption maxima can be achieved by introducing rhodanine-3-acetic acid instead of the cyanoacrylic acid as used in sensitizers FNE60 and FNE62. However, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE61 and FNE63 demonstrate less effective electron injection from the excited dye molecules to the titania semiconductor due to the interruption of the LUMO delocalization on the carboxylic acid by the methylene group. Therefore, the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on sensitizer FNE62 displays the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.2%, which exhibits good long-term stability after continuous light soaking.
