    , Accepted 23rd February 2017First published on 27th February 2017AbstractRegio-random (P1) and -regular (P2) difluorobenzene-naphthalene-containing polymer acceptors were developed for bulk-heterojunction all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). P2 exhibited significantly higher crystallinity in thin films, providing high spectral absorptivity and electron mobility than P1. When used in all-PSC devices, P2 afforded a respectably higher power conversion efficiency of over 5%.
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) comprising organic polymer donors and non-fullerene polymer acceptors have attracted considerable attention in recent years.1 This stems from the realization that replacing fullerene acceptor components in the active layers of organic solar cells (OSCs) with polymer acceptors may provide several advantages including light absorption tunability, ease of molecular orbital energy matching, better mechanical and thermal properties as well as potentially lower acceptor costs.2 Despite these perceived attributes, progress toward the realization of all-PSCs with performance characteristics comparable to those of fullerene-based PSCs has been slow. Major challenges in developing an efficient PCBM replacement persist, and current power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs are comparatively much lower at about 1–8%.2a,3–5
Among polymer acceptors, naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based polymers6,7 have been shown to be promising alternative acceptors for fullerene derivatives. In theory, the electron transport, frontier molecular orbital energy levels and spectral absorption properties of NDI-based polymers can be appositely tuned to improve the PCEs of corresponding all-OSCs. This may be accomplished via incorporation of suitable donor or acceptor moieties into the NDI polymer structure as well as controlling its structural regioregularity. To capitalize on these attributes, appropriately functionalized donor or acceptor precursors would have to be readily accessible and their incorporation into the polymer acceptor structure would not negatively impact polymerization in achieving higher molecular weights and that the solution processability of the resulting polymer would not be compromised. High molecular weight and solution processability are two important parameters for achieving optimal PCEs. Likewise, it is also important that the resulting polymer acceptor possesses reasonable compatibility with the polymer donor component of all-PSC devices.
A fluorine atom, when incorporated into the acceptor moiety of polymer acceptors, has been particularly effective in simultaneously lowering their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels.8 When appositely positioned on the repeating units on the polymer backbone, it can also help attain polymer structural coplanarity for low band-gap properties by locking-up neighboring moieties via C–F⋯S, C–F⋯H and C–F⋯π interactions.9 It may also facilitate charge separation and help reduce charge recombination leading to enhanced charge carrier mobility.10 Accordingly, we have witnessed a variety of fluorine-containing donor polymers been developed and utilized in single-junction PSCs, providing PCEs in excess of 11%.11 Despite significant achievements in fluorine-containing polymer donors, not many fluorine-containing acceptor polymers have hitherto been reported.12 It is thus of great interest to explore appropriately constructed fluorine-containing acceptor polymer systems with random and regioregular backbone structures for all-OSCs. We report herein the synthesis of two difluorobenzene-containing NDI polymers, one structurally random (P1) and one regioregular (P2) isomers, and the studies of the structural effects on their electrical and photovoltaic performances as polymer acceptors in all-PSC devices.
The synthetic schemes for both random and regioregular polymer acceptors, P1 and P2, are summarized in Scheme 1. The polycondensation was carried out via Stille cross-coupling reaction using tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium as the catalyst and tri-o-tolylphosphine as the ligand. P1 was synthesized from the coupling reaction of 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene with 1,4-dibromo-2,5-difluorobenzene and 4,9-dibromo-2,7-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-benzo[lmn][3,8]-phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone. On the other hand, P2 was obtained from the reaction of 4,9-dibromo-2,7-bis(2-octyldodecyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]-phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)tetraone with [(2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)-bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl)]bis(trimethylstannane). Both polycondensations were conducted at 90 °C for 20 h. The crude polymer products were isolated via precipitation from stirring methanol and collected by filtration. Subsequently, they were subjected to sequential Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexane, ethyl acetate and chloroform to remove low molecular weight materials and isolated by extraction with chlorobenzene from the extraction residue. Both polymers displayed reasonably good solubility in hot chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, etc. As the solutions of both polymers displayed a tendency to aggregate at room temperature, their molecular weights were thus measured by high-temperature GPC at 160 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as an eluent against polystyrene standards (see the ESI,† Table S1). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P1 and P2 are 22.3 kDa (PDI: 4.57) and 44.8 kDa (PDI: 6.38), respectively. The observed higher molecular weight of P2 would be consistent with its being structurally more rigid than P1, thus the GPC measurement against PS standards may have overestimated its molecular weight relative to that of P1.13 Both polymers exhibited good thermal stability as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed their decomposition temperatures to be above 400 °C (5% weight loss) in an inert atmosphere (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of polymer acceptors, P1 and P2. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of P1 and P2 are depicted in Fig. 1a and b, and their spectral properties are tabulated in Table S2 (ESI†). In dilute solutions and in thin films, both polymers displayed broad, somewhat featureless dual-band absorptions typical of NDI-based D–A polymers: a short-wavelength band arising from localized π–π* transition (300–450 nm) and a long-wavelength band (500–750 nm) attributable to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).14 From their dilute solution to thin-film spectra, both P1 and P2 exhibited bathochromic shifts of about 30–35 nm in their long-wavelength absorptions, while only P2 simultaneously experienced a bathochromic shift of 18 nm in its short-wavelength absorption (Table S2, ESI†). This may be attributed to significantly higher molecular ordering of P2 in the thin film state by virtue of its structural regioregularity.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis absorption spectra (a and b), thin-film absorptivity (c), and cyclic voltammogram (d) of P1 and P2. 
As expected on the basis of structural regioregularity, P2 exhibited significantly much higher absorptivity than P1. Fig. 1c shows the thin-film spectral absorptivity of the two polymers, with P1 displaying absorption coefficients of 5.30 × 104 cm−1 at λmax, 388 nm, and 4.19 × 104 cm−1 at λmax, 600 nm, and P2, 1.06 × 105 cm−1 at λmax, 388 nm and 5.67 × 104 cm−1 at λmax, 620 nm. The substantially higher spectral absorptivity of P2 lends unequivocal support to a significantly enhanced π-conjugated system of P2 as a result of its relative backbone coplanarity enabled by structural regioregularity.
The electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 1d). The voltammetry was calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (energy level assumed to be −4.8 eV relative to vacuum),15 and the reduction potential was estimated from the onset of reduction. The LUMO energy levels were calculated according to the equation: LUMO = −(Eonsetred + EFc/Fc+1/2 + 4.8) eV16 = −(Eonsetred + 4.36) eV, where the half-wave potential of Fc/Fc+ (EFc/Fc+1/2) was found to be 0.44 V relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Both polymers displayed similar LUMO energy levels of about −3.90 eV. Their HOMO energy levels as calculated from their LUMO energy levels and optical band gaps were about −5.64 and −5.61 eV for P1 and P2, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels of these polymer acceptors (Table S2, ESI†) would match well with those of widely used donor polymer PTB7-Th (Fig. S2, ESI†), leading to favorable energetic offset and driving forces sufficient for charge transfer.
As molecular ordering and surface morphological properties of the active layer have decisive influence over photovoltaic properties, we accordingly engaged X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements to gain insights into the bulk crystalline nature and surface morphology of P1 and P2 in their thin film states. Fig. 2 shows the thickness-adjusted XRD diffraction patterns of thin films of P1 and P2 spin cast from their solutions in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Both P1 and P2 displayed diffraction peaks arising from the lamellar interlayer and π–π stacking orderings in their thin-film XRD diffraction patterns. It is noteworthy that the second-order (200) diffraction peak was also visible in the diffraction pattern of P2. The diffraction signals of P2, particularly the (100) interlayer ordering, were significantly more intense than those of P1. In addition, the second-order (200) diffraction peak (2θ = 8.2°) was also visible in the diffraction pattern of P2. These results strongly support a higher degree of molecular ordering in the thin film of P2. The latter exhibited a lamellar interlayer (100) peak at 2θ = 4.1° and a π–π stacking (010) peak at 2θ = 23.0°, corresponding to the d-spacing of 21.5 Å and 3.86 Å, respectively. On the other hand, the interlayer (100) and π–π stacking (010) peaks of P1 were at 2θ = 3.9° and 2θ = 21.0°, corresponding to respective d-spacing of 22.6 Å and 4.22 Å. The observed much closer π–π stacking distance of P2 was also a strong manifestation of a substantially higher molecular ordering of P2 in the solid state. Stronger π–π stacking should be conducive to charge transport leading to enhanced photovoltaic properties.

Fig. 3 shows the AFM topographic images of composite films of P1 and P2 with PTB7-Th (acceptor:PTB7-Th composition ratio of 1:1.5 by weight) processed with and without DIO processing additives. We observed that the surface morphologies of the P1:PTB7-Th films did not show any noticeable changes when fabricated from o-DCB solutions with or without the DIO processing additive (Fig. 3a and b). In sharp contrast, visibly observable morphological changes occurred when the P2:PTB7-Th films were fabricated in the presence of 1 vol% of DIO additive. In the absence of the DIO additive, the P2:PTB7-Th film still displayed a somewhat rougher surface morphology than those of P1:PTB7-Th films, with the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.1 nm (Fig. 3c). With 1 vol% of DIO additive, the resulting P2:PTB7-Th film exhibited substantially rougher surface morphology with the RMS roughness of 3.4 nm (Fig. 3d). A distinctly discernable nanofibrillar network structure could be clearly observed in this P2:PTB7-Th film. This interconnected nanofibrillar network structure would be beneficial to charge transport, and thus enhanced photovoltaic performance.

The bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic properties of P1 and P2 as acceptor polymers with a donor polymer, PTB7-Th, for all-OSCs were evaluated using an OSC device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1 or P2:PTB7-Th/LiF/Al under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G illumination. The composition of the active layer (P1 or P2:PTB7-Th) was adjusted from 1:2 to 2:1 by weight, and 1–5 vol% of DIO was used as a processing additive to optimize the photovoltaic performance. The optimization conditions are summarized Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI,† and the optimized photovoltaic performance properties are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table S3 (ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Current density–voltage curves (a) and EQE curves (b) of all-PSC devices with active layers of P1:PTB7-Th and P2:PTB7-Th (1:1.5, w/w; with 1 vol% DIO). 
As can be noted, the optimized P1:PTB7-Th device (1:1.5, w/w; 1 vol% DIO) gave a PCE of 1.30% with a Voc of 0.78 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.80 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.34. On the other hand, the corresponding P2:PTB7-Th (1:1.5, w/w; 1 vol% DIO) afforded a significantly much higher PCE of 5.20% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a short-circuit current density of 14.3 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.44. The P2 devices also exhibited much higher Jsc than those of P1, in strong agreement with their much higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) values (Fig. 4b). Nonetheless, these results were opposite to those of recent reports, showing random polymers of being more efficient than their regioregular counterparts for improving PCEs.7e,f This may be attributed to the relatively low-to-medium structural “randomness” of the earlier copolymers (to about 30 mol%) as compared to our copolymers of high structural “randomness” (50 mol%), which greatly lowered their crystallinity, and thus adversely affected their charge transport capability. Further analysis of the dependence of PCE on the degree of structural regioregularity of the polymer would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
The higher short-circuit current density of P2 devices is primarily linked to its higher electron mobility than that of P1 by virtue of its structural regioregularity. The charge carrier mobilities of P1:PTB7-Th and P2:PTB7-Th active layers were evaluated via a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method using electron-only and hole-only devices (Fig. S5 and Table S4, ESI†). The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of the P1:PTB7-Th layer were estimated to be 1.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while those of P2:PTB7-Th layer, respectively, are 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The fact that the P2:PTB7-Th layer had a higher electron mobility, which was comparable in magnitude to its hole mobility (Table S4, ESI†), clearly contributed to the overall much better performance of P2 as a polymer acceptor in all-OSCs.
In summary, two new difluorobenzene–naphthalene diimide polymer acceptors, one random and one regioregular structurally, were developed to study the structural effects on their electronic, morphological, electrical and photovoltaic properties as polymer acceptors in all-PSC devices. Being structurally regioregular, P2 presumably possess significantly higher efficacy in the molecular self-assembly than its random counterpart, P1, leading to the formation of an extensively interconnected nanofibrillar network structure in thin films processed with a suitable amount of a DIO additive. This was supported by longer-wavelength spectral absorption and substantially stronger absorption coefficients as well as higher crystallinity reflected in its XRD properties. As a result, P2 exhibited much higher electron mobility and a more balanced electron and hole mobility in its composite film with the polymer donor, PTB7-Th. This explains the significantly enhanced Jsc and photovoltaic performance compared to its random counterpart, P1, when used as a polymer acceptor with the PTB7-Th donor in all-PSC devices. The P2:PTB7-Th device afforded a respectably high PCE over 5% for all-PSC devices. We believe that appropriate structural modification of the polymer acceptor with an appositely designed fluorinated moiety as well as processing optimization would lead to enhanced active layer composition for all-PSCs.
