    , Accepted 9th September 2014First published on 3rd October 2014AbstractBone-like Au nanoparticles (NPs) along with a small number of by-products of nanorods, nanocubes and other irregular shapes were synthesized using a seed-mediated growth approach. The mixed Au NPs generate a very wide absorption spectra of 300–1000 nm with three main absorption peaks at 520, 600, and 770 nm, extending to the main absorption, cut-off and transparence region of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) active layer. The mixed Au NPs were attached onto the ITO anode via a self-assembly method, and then P3HT:PCBM-based polymer photovoltaic cells (OPVs) were fabricated. The short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency are significantly enhanced by 18.6% and 24.2% respectively, accompanied by the optimization of NPs distribution density. Optical, electrical, and morphological changes with the incorporation of Au NPs in the cells were thoroughly analyzed, and the results demonstrated that the cell performance improvement is mainly attributed to a synergistic reaction, including both the localized surface plasmon resonance- and scattering-induced absorption enhancement of the active layer, Au NPs-induced hole extraction ability enhancement, and large interface roughness-induced efficient exciton dissociation and hole collection.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are attracting considerable attention due to their potential for low-cost and high-throughput processing.1,2 However, compared to inorganic cells, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) in OPVs must be addressed due to the limitations that include absorption transparence in the near-infrared (NIR) region for most of the organic/polymer active layers, the low carrier mobility of organic materials, large energy loss generated with charge separation, and mismatched energy levels between the donor and the acceptor. Therefore, promoting light absorption is one of key points to increase the PCE. The use of new materials with low band gaps has efficiently promoted light absorption in the NIR region.3–6 Another effective approach to enhance the absorption in an active layer involves the use of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs),7,8 which has been widely reported in inorganic photovoltaic cells,9,10 OPVs,11,12 and dye-sensitized solar cells13,14 in recent years.
SPPs are electromagnetic surface waves confined to a metal-dielectric interface by coupling to the free electron plasma in metals, which are localized around metal nanoparticles (noted with localized surface plasmon resonance, LSPR) or propagate along the planar metal surfaces. Spherical Ag or Au nanoparticles (NPs)-induced absorption enhancement has been mainly reported in OPVs in the past several years.15–17 However, the photocurrent enhancement from spherical Ag or Au nanoparticles is restricted due to a limited resonance region around 430 nm and 530 nm, respectively.18 Some other Au NPs shapes such as triangular17,19 and octahedral20 have also been designed and applied in OPVs, but their LSPR peaks are still localized around 550 nm, thus restraining a further effective performance enhancement. Recently, Au NPs with asymmetrical structures have attracted considerable attention due to adjustable absorption spectra, simple processing technology, and low manufacturing cost. Rod-shaped Ag and Au nanostructures are becoming attractive candidates due to tunable longitudinal plasmon resonance wavelength from visible, NIR to the infrared region by simply manipulating the aspect ratios of the rods,4,21 providing a unique opportunity for utilizing the low energy range of the solar light spectrum. In addition, Ag or Au nanorods (NRs) can be processed through wet chemical synthesis,22 using which an efficient dispersion of these NRs in a variety of aqueous/organic solutions can be simply realized. Simultaneously, their size, shape, and density can also be easily controlled.23–25 It should be noted that this approach of obtaining Ag or Au NRs is less expensive compared to the preparation of metal nanostructures with other methods, e.g., laser ablation,26,27 electron beam lithography,28 focused ion beam milling,29 and scanning tunneling microscopy assisted nanostructure formation.30 Bone-like Au NPs, having all the advantages of Au NRs, can also generate a strong local electric field intensity around the end of the bone. However, their application in OPVs has not been reported to date.
In this study, we have synthesized mixed Au NPs with a majority having a bone-like shape and a small number of rod, cube and irregular shapes, and then introduced them into the OPV's hole extraction layer to observe their influence on the device performances. Note that the bone-like Au NPs along with the minority of NRs, nanocubes and other irregular shapes generate a very wide resonance absorption spectrum of 300–1000 nm with three main absorption peaks at 520, 600, and 770 nm. The absorption spectrum covers not only the main absorption region of the active layer poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM), but also the cut-off and transparence region of the active layer; therefore, it will be in particular beneficial for the enhancement of PCE. Another highlight in this study is the use of self-assembling approach to acquire an efficient distribution and good controllability of Au NPs. Moreover, self-assembly approach31 is also a good choice for saving the cost of Au raw material. After optimizing the Au NPs' distribution density onto the ITO electrode, we realize 24.2% and 18.6% enhancement in PCE and short-circuit current density (Jsc) respectively, and this result is among the highest enhancement factors in the case of OPVs with metal NPs being doped into carrier extraction layers.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, ≥99.9%), ascorbic acid (AA, 99%) were purchased from J&K, and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, ≥99%), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, ≥99%), and silver nitrate (AgNO3, ≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Linear polyethyleneimine (PEI, with a Mw of ∼750000, 50 wt% in H2O) and poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, Mw of ∼70000, 30 wt% in H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and diluted in 1 mM NaCl solution. Ultrapure deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm−2) was used for all solution preparations and experiments.
2.2 Synthesis of Au NPs
Au NPs were first synthesized in an aqueous solution using the colloidal seed-mediated approach according to the Murphy method.22 The detailed steps are as follows:

Preparation of Au seeds: 0.25 mL of an aqueous 0.01 M HAuCl4·3H2O solution was added to 7.5 mL of a 0.10 M CTAB solution in a glass tube. Then, 0.6 mL of 0.01 M ice-cold NaBH4 solution was quickly added into the above mentioned mixed solution, followed by rapid inversion mixing for 2 minutes. The solution developed a pale brown-yellow color and was maintained at 25 °C in a test tube. This seed solution was used 2 hours after its preparation.

Synthesis of Au NPs: 0.20 mL of a 0.01 M HAuCl4·3H2O aqueous solution was added into 9.5 mL of a 0.10 M CTAB solution in a glass tube. Then, 0.07 mL of a 0.01 M AgNO3 solution was added into the above solution with gentle mixing. 0.06 mL of a 0.10 M AA was then slowly added into the mixed solution at a rate of one drop per 5 s. The solution became colorless upon the addition of AA. Finally, 0.02 mL of the seeded solution was added, the reaction solution was gently mixed for 10 s and left undisturbed for at least 3 hours.

Fig. 1(a) shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the as-synthesized Au NPs, from which it can be observed that in addition to the majority of bone-like Au NPs, a small number of NRs, nanocubes and other irregular shapes as by-products also occur. The lengths of longitudinal and transverse axes for most of the bone-like and rod shape NPs are around 45 ± 5 and 13 ± 3 nm, respectively, while the bone edge width is about 15 ± 2 nm. For the cubes, their average side length is around 30 ± 4 nm. The measured extinction spectra of the Au NPs shown in Fig. 1(b) cover a very wide wavelength region of 300–1000 nm with three main absorption peaks at 520, 600, and 770 nm. We used finite difference time domain (FDTD) software from Lumerical Solutions Inc. to simulate the absorption cross sections around the bone, rod, and cube NPs; the results are also shown in Fig. 1(b). The simulated results demonstrate that the peaks around 770 and 520 nm mainly appear due to the resonances of longitudinal and transverse axes of bones and rods. From the results in Fig. 1(b), it can be observed that one major absorption peak in the measured absorption spectra is around 770 nm with a wide full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 153 nm, which is far broader than 40–50 nm of rods (the curves with magenta and dark yellow colors are rods with longitudinal and transverse axes of 40/14 and 46/12 nm, respectively.) and 60–70 nm of bone-like shapes (the curves with dark, red, green, and blue colors are the bone-like shape NPs with longitudinal and transverse axes of 46/12, 45/12, 45/13, and 45/16 nm, respectively, and an edge width of 15 nm). Therefore, it can be concluded that the 770 nm peak is composed of some rod and bone shape NPs with a ratio range of 2.8–4.0. The 525 nm peak value corresponds to the resonance peak of the transverse axis for the rod and bone shape NPs. In our simulation result, we cannot observe the resonance from the transverse axis mainly due to the assumption that all the Au NPs stayed in the aqueous solution with the longitudinal axis perpendicular to the incident light source and this does not efficiently match with the real status of Au NPs (random distribution) in the water. In contrast, if we assume that all the Au NPs stayed in the solution with their longitudinal axis parallel to the incident light source, the intensity from the transverse axis is considerably higher than that from the longitudinal axis (not shown here). The resonance around 600 nm is mainly attributed to the nanocube shapes with side lengths of 30 ± 4 nm.

It should be noted that the above absorption spectrum was measured with the NPs dispersed into aqueous solution, while in the case of the Au NPs in the cells, they were assembled onto ITO and covered with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole extraction layer; thus, their absorption spectra generated a redshift due to the larger refractive index of PEDOT:PSS (∼1.5) than that of water (∼1.3). Thus, we simulated the absorption cross sections of some representative NPs structures that are discussed in this paper, e.g., the bone-like Au NPs with longitudinal/transverse axes of 45/13 nm and the edge width of 15 nm, the rod ones with longitudinal/transverse axes of 46/12 and 40/14 nm, and the cube ones with the side length of 28 nm. The absorption cross sections for these NPs in the PEDOT:PSS film are summarized in Fig. 2, and simultaneously compared with those in aqueous solution, from which it can be observed that ∼60 nm absorption redshift occurs in the films for all the types of Au NPs. This means that the resonance peak of ∼600 nm in aqueous solution will move to ∼660 nm in the film, while the longitudinal resonant peaks of ∼770 nm in aqueous solution will shift to ∼830 nm in the film, respectively corresponding to the absorption-edge (∼650 nm) and the transparence zone (>700 nm) of the active layer P3HT:PCBM. According to Hsiao,32 Li,33 and Lu's34 research work, the integration of the two kinds of metal NPs or metal NPs with metal nanostructures with complementary absorption spectra is beneficial for the performance enhancement of OPVs. In addition, the analysis from Hsiao et al.32 reveals that the integration of NPs covering the entire absorption band-edge of the active layer is in particular beneficial for the acquirement of a high enhancement factor in OPVs. Our mixed NPs cover not only the entire absorption band but also the absorption-edge and transparence zone of the active layer, indicating that the effective absorption enhancement induced by LSPR will be beneficial to the performance enhancement in our solar cells.

2.3 Self-assembly of Au NPs onto ITO
The as-synthesized Au NPs solution was centrifuged two times at 9000 rpm (10 minutes) to remove the raw materials and reactants. To maintain a positive charge environment around the Au NPs, 1 mL of a 0.10 M CTAB aqueous solution was added into the Au NPs solution.
ITO glass substrates were sequentially sonicated in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 10 min. After blowing with nitrogen gas, the dried substrates were first immersed into the 10 mM PEI solution (containing 0.01 mM NaCl) for 2 h to introduce positive charges on the ITO surface, then immersed into 10 mM PSS aqueous solution (containing 0.01 mM NaCl) for 2 h to introduce negative charges on the substrate surface. After exhaustive rinsing with water and drying with nitrogen gas, the substrates were immersed into the Au NPs solution for 12 h, forming the self-assembled Au NPs structures.31 To increase the self-assembled Au NPs density, the ITO glass substrates were immersed again into the PSS aqueous solution for 20 min and then into the Au NPs solution for 40 min, which corresponds to 2 immersions.35 In this paper, the Au NPs distributions on ITO with number of immersions of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were analysed using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the influence of different number of immersions on the cell performances was observed. As exhibited in Fig. 2, the Au NPs density obviously increases with increasing number of immersions. We also observe that almost all Au NPs with bone or rod shapes stayed on the ITO substrates with their longitudinal axes aligned with the electrode, and no apparent aggregation of the Au NPs is found using this simple method.
2.4 Device fabrication and characterization
The ITO substrates covered with the self-assembled Au NPs were first treated with an ultraviolet light for 3 min. Then, another PEDOT:PSS hole extraction layer was spin-coated onto ITO with an annealing process of 100 °C for 15 min. The polymer blend solution was prepared by mixing P3HT and PCBM with 1:1 weight ratio in dichlorobenzene with a total concentration of 30 mg mL−1. The mixed solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800 rpm for 36 s to form the active layer, followed by a solvent annealing process of 1.5 h. The final thickness of the active layer was about 70 nm. Finally, a 1 nm LiF ultrathin film as the electron extraction layer and a 100 nm Al layer as the cathode were sequentially evaporated onto the active layer. Fig. 4 shows the architectures of our plasmonic-enhanced OPV device and the control device.

3. Results and discussion
The effect of the number of immersions in the solution of Au NPs on the distribution density of Au NPs is first discussed. As shown in Fig. 3, the distribution density of NPs significantly increases with the number of immersions. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the four groups of OPV devices with different Au NPs density distributions are presented in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. These data are obtained from more than 20 groups of devices for each structure. The analysis reveals that assembling Au NPs helps to enhance both Jsc and PCE. The device immersed three times achieves a maximum Jsc and PCE of 10.64 mA cm−2 and 4.06%, with enhancement factors of 18.6% and 24.2%, respectively compared to those in the control device. With a low density of Au NPs, FF shows a slight decrease, and then begins to increase along with the increase in the Au NPs density. A maximum FF value occurs at 3 immersions with a distribution density of 2.5 × 107 NPs per cm2. The introduction of a small number of NPs on the ITO electrode surface hardly changes the open-circuit voltage (Voc), and with a further increase in the distribution density of Au NPs, Voc shows a very slight decline. A proper NPs density also reduces the series resistance (Rs) in the cells mainly due to two reasons discussed as follows: a higher work function of Au (5.4 eV) compared to the highest occupied molecular orbital (∼5.2 eV) of PEDOT:PSS provides a fine hole extraction ability at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface. In addition, the Au NPs simultaneously generate a shallow impurity energy level in the PEDOT:PSS film.36,37 The single hole devices with and without Au NPs were fabricated to observe the influence of Au NPs doping on the hole transport ability of the PEDOT:PSS film. The result indicates that it forms an ohmic contact at both the interfaces of ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/Au NPs-doped PEDOT:PSS. The incorporation of Au NPs efficiently decreases the resistance of the PEDOT:PSS film, resulting in the increase in current density under the same driving bias. This point is also consistent with dark J–V characteristics (Fig. 5b), in which Rs and J are decreased and enhanced, respectively, with a high Au NPs distribution density.

Fig. 6 shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) data for the OPV devices with different number of immersions in NPs. The corresponding IPCE curves with different number of immersions exhibit an obvious improvement over a wide wavelength range of 380–650 nm compared to the standard device, consistent with the above measured J–V characteristics and similar to other reported results.16,38 The improvement on IPCE can be attributed to many factors, including electrical and optical improvements. As discussed above, the decrease in the resistance of the PEDOT:PSS film is helpful to transport the dissociated holes. Moreover, the higher work function of Au compared to ITO is beneficial to extract holes into the anodes. In addition, the absorption spectra of the multilayer films of Au NPs/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM and the control film of PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM were also measured to observe the LSPR-induced absorption enhancement.
 Fig. 6  IPCE curves for the OPV devices with different NPs number of immersions. 
As shown in Fig. 7a, the light absorption around 350–650 nm is continuously enhanced along with the increase in Au NPs density. This enhancement can be attributed to the absorption increase of the active layer and the PEDOT:PSS extraction layer induced by the LSPR of Au NPs. To observe the absorption change in the PEDOT:PSS extraction layer, the light absorption of only Au NPs/PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 7b) is measured, and the results demonstrate that the absorption from PEDOT:PSS shows some increase with the introduction of Au NPs, indicating that some light enhancement occurs in PEDOT:PSS, which is not contributed to the photocarrier generation. But fortunately, this increase is relatively weak compared to that in the active layer, indicating that the main absorption enhancement results from the active layer induced by LSPR. In addition to the absorption difference between A3 (Au NPs with three immersions/P3HT:PCBM) and A0 (P3HT:PCBM) shown in the inset of Fig. 7a, another minor absorption shoulder around 740 nm is observed, which is mainly due to a direct absorption of the bone or rod Au NPs with large aspect ratios to the incident light. However, this part of absorption does not provide any help to the increase in IPCE around 740 nm due to the transparence of the absorption of the active layer. However, the NPs with larger sizes bring about a significant scattering of the incident light and generate a lengthened light transport path, resulting in a further increase of light absorption by OPV cells. The fact that the incorporation of the Au NPs increases the light harvesting in the devices is further confirmed by the significant intensity enhancement in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 8). With the increase in number of immersions, the PL spectra for Au NPs/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM exhibits a significant increase in intensity. We attribute the enhanced PL intensity to the fact that excitation of the LSPR increases the degree of light absorption, and therefore, enhances the light excitation rate.39 In addition, according to a previous report,16 with respect to the absorption enhancement, the exciton quenching with non-radiative energy transfer at metal/active layer interfaces also changes the PL intensity. Our PL results indicate that no obvious PL quenching phenomenon occurs in the active layer due to the efficient wrapping of NPs with CTAB and PEDOT:PSS. Another possible factor affecting the PL intensity is the change in the morphology of films. Therefore, we measured the XRD profiles of P3HT:PCBM films and observed the influence of the introduction of Au NPs on the film morphology. From Fig. 9, we clearly observed that the intensity of the (100) peak (corresponding to the diffraction peak of 5.4°) increases along with the decline in the FWHM of (100) diffraction spectrum with the utilization of Au NPs, indicating that the number of P3HT crystallites increase and the film has closer P3HT chains. Here, closer P3HT chains distance suggests a lower resistance to the hopping of carriers between P3HT backbones, which results in a higher Jsc and a smaller Rs than the reference devices.40

In addition to the absorbance enhancement in the NPs-modified OPVs and the alteration of the hole extraction and transport ability induced by Au NPs, other possible factors, e.g., the influence of incorporating Au NPs on the morphological changes of the PEDOT:PSS film, have been further investigated to observe their influences on solar cells. It has been suggested that a rough P3HT:PCBM surface creates defect sites that assist exciton dissociation.41 Moreover, increasing the anode surface roughness will increase the interface area between the anode and the active layer, providing shorter routes for holes to travel to the anode and enhancing the hole collection at the anode.42 The increased interfacial area between PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:PCBM allows the collection of a larger number of holes in the P3HT:PCBM layer, thus increasing Jsc. Therefore, the morphological changes of the PEDOT:PSS layer with different Au NPs density are measured by applying atomic force microscopy (AFM) on the PEDOT:PSS film, as shown in Fig. 10. With the introduction of the Au NPs, we observe an obvious surface morphology change of the NPs/PEDOT:PSS film with an increase in surface roughness (Ra) from 0.55 nm for the pure PEDOT:PSS film to 1.025 nm for the Au NPs-assembled PEDOT:PSS film immersed for 3 times. This result indicates that the introduction of NPs is beneficial to exciton dissociation and the collection of a larger number of holes to some extent, resulting in the increase in Jsc. The obvious phase separation for the P3HT:PCBM films after assembling the Au NPs is also helpful for the carrier transport, thus the Jsc increase.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized mixed Au NPs comprised of majority of bone-like Au NPs along with a small number of rod, cube and irregular shapes with a seed-mediated growth approach. It is noted that the mixed Au NPs generate a very wide absorption spectrum of 300–1000 nm with three main absorption peaks at 520, 600, and 770 nm. For the first time, we assembled the mixed Au NPs with a wide absorption spectrum on the ITO anode and fabricated polymer photovoltaic cells with P3HT:PCBM as the active layer, in which Jsc and PCE show significant enhancement factors of 18.6% and 24.2%, respectively, with the optimization of Au NPs distribution density. We explored optical, electrical, and morphological changes due to the incorporation of Au NPs in the cells and research results demonstrated that the improvement in cell performance can be attributed to a synergistic reaction, including (1) both the localized surface plasmon resonance- and scattering-induced absorption enhancement of the active layer, (2) Au NPs-induced hole extraction ability enhancement, and (3) large interface roughness-induced efficient exciton dissociation and hole collection.
