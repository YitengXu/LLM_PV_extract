    , Accepted 31st March 2021First published on 8th April 2021AbstractNon-fullerene all-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) have attracted considerable attention for industrial application owing to their well-defined molecular structure, high purity and good batch-to-batch reproducibility. However, nearly all the high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ASM-OSCs rely heavily on the extra treatment of their active layers. Herein, two A-π-D-π-A-type benzodithiophene trimer (3BDT)-based large planar conjugated rigid small molecules (3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5) were successfully designed and synthesized. When blended with a non-fullerene acceptor (Y6), the 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5-based solution-processed bulk heterojunction OSCs exhibited PCEs of 5.8% and 10.4% under 1.5G illumination without extra treatment, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, 3BDT-5 is the first small molecule-based OSC device with Y6 as an acceptor to exhibit a PCE breaking 10% without thermal annealing, solvent vapor annealing, or use of additives. More importantly, when using post-treatments on the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film, the PCEs of the devices did not change obviously. Thus, the excellent photovoltaic properties of 3BDT-5 make it an alternative material for the industrial large-scale fabrication of high-performance OSCs. This result demonstrates that the molecular design method can be a very effective strategy for controlling the active layer morphology.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered as promising next-generation green technology because of their flexibility, light weight, and roll-to-roll coating processes.1,2 According to the composition of the active layer, it is well known that OSCs can be classified into three types of devices, namely, polymer solar cells (p(n)-type polymers + n(p)-type organic small molecules), all-polymer solar cells (p-type polymers + n-type polymers), and all-small-molecule organic solar cells (p-type organic small molecules + n-type organic small molecules).3–5 Among them, all-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) have attracted considerable attention for industrial application owing to their well-defined molecular structure, high purity and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility.6,7 In recent years, with the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors,8,9 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ASM-OSCs have significantly improved from ∼3% (in 2013) to ∼16% (in 2020).10,11 Especially, with the development of the non-fullerene acceptor Y6-system,12,13 the highest PCEs of the devices increased from ∼11% to ∼15% very quickly.14
However, nearly all the high PCEs of Y6-based ASM-OSCs rely very heavily on the extra treatment of their active layers, such as use of additives, thermal annealing (TA), and solvent vapor annealing (SVA). Fig. 1 and Table S1† completely summarize the photovoltaic performances of the reported Y6-based ASM-OSCs devices in the literatures.15–26 Without the extra treatments, all the PCEs of the devices are less than 9%, and more than half of them are lower than 2%. In contrast, the PCEs are greatly improved to over 10% by TA, SVA, dual treatments of TA and SVA, or TA and use of additives to optimize the morphology and to form nanoscale phase separation of the active layers, leading to a much enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), thereby achieving high PCEs. Recently, Zhu et al. reported that the PCE of as-cast BSFTR:Y6-based ASM-OSCs was as low as 0.22%, but when treated with TA (120 °C for 5 min) and SVA + TA treatments, the PCEs increased to 12.56% and 13.69%, respectively.15 In 2020, Min et al. reported that the PCE of TBFT-TR:Y6-based ASM-OSCs reached 14.03% with TA (140 °C for 2 min) treatment, but was only 0.19% without extra treatment.23 Although the PCE of the treated devices are obviously enhanced, the extra treatments on the active layer result in great challenges for the large-scale industrial fabrication of OSCs.27,28 Therefore, it is very important and urgent to develop highly efficient p-type organic small molecules for ASM-OSC devices without the need for extra treatment to optimize the morphology of the active layers.
 Fig. 1  Efficiencies for the reported small molecule Y6-based organic solar cells devices. 
Thus, to solve this problem, all the chemical structures of the p-type organic small molecules reported in Fig. 1 were carefully analyzed. It was found that only the FG3:Y6- and FG4:Y6-based ASM-OSCs exhibited relatively low differences in PCEs under as-cast and post-treatment (∼8% vs. ∼11%, respectively).25 It should be noted that FG3 and FG4 (shown in Scheme 1) employed the two and three planar rigid structures dithienocyclopenta (DTC) as the central electron-donor units, respectively, instead of the commonly used single benzodithiophene (BDT) unit. This indicates that the introduction of a planar rigid structure in p-type small molecules may be beneficial for forming an ideal and stable phase separation morphology when blending with the non-fullerene acceptor Y6-system.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of FG3 and FG4. 
Herein, two A-π-D-π-A-type conjugated small molecules, 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5, with a benzodithiophene trimer (3BDT) as the central electron-donor unit, different electron-acceptor end groups of 3-hexylrhodanine (3BDT-4) and 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (3BDT-5), and 3-octyl-2,2′-bithiophene as the π-bridge unit were successfully designed and synthesized, as shown in Scheme 2. In the two target molecules, the introduction of the large planar conjugated 3BDT unit can greatly enhance the rigidity of their molecular backbones.29,30 Moreover, Lee's research work demonstrated that the number of BDT units is very useful for creating well-defined intermolecular interactions, thus forming the desired interconnectivity in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type active layer.31 Consequently, 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 demonstrated medium bandgaps of 1.83 eV and 1.90 eV, and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of −5.14 eV and −5.15 eV, respectively. When blended with the non-fullerene low bandgap acceptor Y6, the 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5-based solution-processed BHJ-OSCs afforded a Voc of 0.829 V, Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2, FF of 0.413, and moderate PCE of 5.82%, and Voc of 0.840 V, Jsc of 21.3 mA cm−2, FF of 0.581, and impressive PCE of 10.4% under 1.5G illumination without extra treatment, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, 3BDT-5 is the first small molecule-based device with Y6 as an acceptor that exhibits a PCE breaking 10% without any treatment to date. More importantly, even if using TA and SVA on the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film, the PCEs of their devices did not obviously change. The results revealed that the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film possessed an ideal and stable phase separation morphology. Therefore, 3BDT-5 is a considerably attractive donor material for the large-scale fabrication of OSCs.

2.2 Device fabrication and characterization
Electron acceptor Y6 was purchased from Solarmer Energy, Inc. Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated using indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass as the substrate. The sheet resistance of ITO was 10 Ω sq−1. The patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min each. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS (4083) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s on to the ITO surface, and the substrates were heated at 130 °C for 20 min before being moved to a glovebox. Subsequently, the photoactive layers (thickness: 100 nm, 2000 rpm/60 s) were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of donors and Y6 in chloroform with a total concentration of 18 mg mL−1 in an N2-filled glovebox at 45 °C. Afterwards, the PDINO solutions (1.0 mg mL−1 in methanol) were spin-coated on the photoactive layers at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, the substrates were transferred back to the high-vacuum chamber, where Al (100 nm) was deposited as the top electrode at pressures less than 2 × 10−4 Pa at a rate of 0.2–1.0 Å s−1, resulting in final OSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/SM:Y6/PDINO (5 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active area of the OSC cell was 4 mm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the devices were carried out using a Keithley 2440 source meter with a solar simulator (Newport-Oriel® Sol3A 450 W) device. EQE measurements were conducted with a solar cell QE tester (QE-R, Enli Technology Co., Ltd). The integration of EQE data over an AM 1.5G solar spectrum yielded calculated Jsc values with an experimental variation of less than 2% relative to the Jsc measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5 G light illumination.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
The two objective molecules were synthesized via two step of Stille coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions with a total yield of around 40%. The detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† The molecular structures were characterized by NMR and high-resolution time-of-flight mass (TOF-MS) spectroscopy. The two donor materials exhibited good solubility (>15 mg mL−1) in common halogenated solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. Additionally, high quality films of 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 could be obtained through spin-coating. As shown in Fig. S1,† the decomposition temperatures of 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 were as high as 407 °C and 382 °C, respectively, suggesting their excellent thermal stability.
3.2 Optical properties
The normalized UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 in dilute chloroform solution and thin film are shown in Fig. 2, and the data is summarized in Table 1. Compared to that of 3BDT-5 (λmax = 512 nm), the maximum absorption peak of 3BDT-4 is slightly red-shifted by 10 nm in the dilute solution state (λmax = 522 nm). This red-shift should be attributed to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of alkyl rhodanine (in 3BDT-4) compared to alkyl cyanoacetate (in 3BDT-5). Compared with the solution state, the two donor materials display a bathochromic-shifted (∼40 nm) and broadened absorption spectra in the range of 300 to 660 nm in the film state. The 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 films present maximum absorption peaks at 564 and 550 nm with shoulder peaks at 606 and 584 nm, respectively, indicating the existence of strong π–π stacking between their molecule backbones.32 The absorption edges of the 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 films are 676 nm and 652 nm, corresponding to the medium optical bandgaps of 1.83 and 1.90 eV, respectively. Considering that Y6 is a typical low bandgap acceptor (Eg = 1.34 eV), medium optical bandgap donors will be favorable to form complementary absorption (300–950 nm).

3.3 Electrochemical properties
To estimate the HOMO and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels of 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5, their electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. S2.† The EHOMO/LUMO energy levels of 3BDT-4 were calculated to be −5.14/−3.44 eV and that of 3BDT-5 was calculated to be −5.15/−3.40 eV, respectively. Obviously, the electron-withdrawing end groups have nearly no effect on the HOMO energy levels, but have a slight effect on the LUMO energy levels. The EHOMO/LUMO energy levels of Y6 were calculated to be −5.44/−3.78 eV (as shown in Fig. S3†), respectively. The HOMO and LUMO offset between the donor materials and Y6 is ∼0.30 and ∼0.36 eV, respectively, which is sufficient to achieve efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation.33
3.4 Photovoltaic properties
To gain insight to the photovoltaic properties of the two donors, ASM-OSC devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:Y6/PDINO/Al were fabricated,34 in which 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 acted as the donor (D) and Y6 was used as the acceptor (A). By careful device optimization, the optimized D/A weight ratio was determined to be 1:0.55 and the best thickness was 100 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the data are listed in Tables 2, S2, and S3.† The as-cast ASM-OSC device based on 3BDT-4:Y6 exhibited a moderate PCE of 5.82% with a Voc of 0.829 V, Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.413. Conversely, the as-cast ASM-OSC device based on 3BDT-5:Y6 displayed an impressive PCE of 10.4% with a Voc of 0.840 V, high Jsc of 21.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.581. The enhanced PCE is attributed to the obviously higher Jsc and FF compared to that of the 3BDT-4:Y6-based device. Thus, to elucidate the origin of the enhanced Jsc, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured. As shown in Fig. 3(b), greatly increased EQE values were observed in the 3BDT-5:Y6-based devices in the range of 350 to 850 nm, thereby resulting in a high Jsc. Consequently, the integrated current densities from the EQE spectra of the 3BDT-4:Y6 and 3BDT-5:Y6-based devices are 17.3 and 21.8 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the obtained Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves.

3.5 Charge recombination mechanism
To investigate the charge recombination mechanism of the two devices, the dependence of Voc and Jsc on the light intensity (Pin) was carefully measured. The relationship between Jsc and Pin can be described as JSC ∝ LnPinα, where the α value will approach 1 if there is no bimolecular recombination in the device.35 As shown in Fig. 4(a), the α values are 0.93 and 0.97 for the 3BDT-4:Y6 and 3BDT-5:Y6-based devices, respectively, which indicates that there is slightly stronger bimolecular recombination in the 3BDT-4:Y6-based device. The Voc and Pin can be fitted by the relationship , where n, k, T, and q are the ideal factor, the Boltzmann constant, the temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively.36 Generally, the more n deviates from 1, the higher the degree of trap-assisted recombination. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the n value of the 3BDT-5:Y6-based device is 1.00, whereas that of the 3BDT-4:Y6-based device increases to1.34, indicating the existence of heavy trap-assisted recombination in the 3BDT-4:Y6-based device. This should be the main reason for the much lower Jsc and FF of the 3BDT-4:Y6-based device compared to the 3BDT-5:Y6-based device.

To investigate the charge transportation properties of the two devices, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobility of the active layers were measured using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method, and the data is listed in Table 2. μh and μe of the 3BDT-4:Y6 blend film were calculated to be 0.80 × 10−4 and 2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas that of the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film obviously increased to 3.64 × 10−4 and 6.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, thereby resulting in a higher Jsc. Furthermore, the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film (μe/μh = 1.70) demonstrated more balanced hole and electron mobility than the 3BDT-4:Y6 blend film (μe/μh = 3.06), leading to a higher FF. Consequently, the higher mobility together with better-balanced μe/μh in the blend film contributed to more effective charge transportation and extraction, which led to an enhancement in Jsc and FF.37
3.7 AFM and GIWAXS measurements
To understand the relationship between the phase separation of the active layers and the device performances, the surface morphologies of the active layers were observed via atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 5, both the 3BDT-4:Y6 and 3BDT-5:Y6 blend films exhibited a uniform and smooth surface morphology with a similar small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of around 1.7 nm. However, their phase separation behaviors were distinctly different. The 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film presented a clearer microstructure, displaying obvious nanoscale phase separation and continuous interpenetrating networks, compared to the 3BDT-4:Y6 blend film, which agrees well with the higher mobility of its active layer. This is beneficial for achieving better charge transport, thereby resulting in the higher Jsc and FF of the 3BDT-5:Y6-based device.
 Fig. 5  Phase and height images obtained by tapping-mode AFM for the 3BDT-4:Y6 blend film (a and b) and 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film (c and d), respectively. 
The molecular crystallinity and orientation of the blend films were investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements.38 The 2D GIWAXS patterns and detailed GIWAXS peak information of the as-cast blend films are shown in Fig. 6(a and b) and Table 3, respectively. The corresponding out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line cuts of the GIWAXS patterns of the as-cast blend films are presented in Fig. 6(c and d), respectively. The (010) π–π stacking peak at ∼1.73 Å−1 (d = 3.63 Å) in the OOP direction and the lamellar stacking peak at ∼0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.9 Å) in the IP direction originate from the packing of Y6.19 As shown in Table 3, the crystal coherence length (CCL) of the (010) peak of the 3BDT-4:Y6 blend film is 2.48 nm, which is lower than that of the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film (CCL = 3.20 nm). However, the CCL of (100) peak of the 3BDT-4:Y6 blend film is slightly higher than that of the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film (6.90 vs. 6.47 nm). In the two blend films, the intensity of both the π–π and lamellar stacking peaks of the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film significantly increased in both the OOP and IP directions, suggesting its higher crystalline property. Moreover, an additional (100) peak at ∼0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.9 Å) with a CCL of 1.91 nm in the OOP direction was observed in the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film, indicating the presence of more ordered lamellar stacking. This result agrees with the morphology of the active layers revealed by the AFM measurement. Consequently, a clearer feature comprising primarily face-on and some edge-on crystalline orientations could be observed in the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film. Many reports revealed that these mixed orientations can enable high efficiency OSC devices by forming coexisting parallel and vertical charge transport channels in the blend film.15,39–41 Consequently, the obviously higher crystalline property of the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film could promote the intermolecular charge transport and reduce charge recombination, thereby resulting in the significantly enhanced Jsc and FF of the device.

3.8 Devices with treatments
Considering the fact that the active layers treated by TA and SVA can greatly improve the performances of all ASM-OSC devices with Y6 as an acceptor (Table S1†), TA and SVA-treatments were performed on the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film. The optimized TA condition was 100 °C for 10 min, and the best SVA condition was chloroform as the solvent for 90 s, with the details summarized in Tables S4 and S5.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 7(a), and the corresponding data is listed in Table 4. The as-cast device based on 3BDT-5:Y6 exhibited an impressive PCE of 10.4% with a Voc of 0.840 V, Jsc of 21.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.581. After the active layer was treated by TA-treatment, the PCE slightly increased to 11.0% with a Voc of 0.832 V, Jsc of 22.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.602 owing to the higher Jsc and FF even if the Voc decreased. Nevertheless, nearly no improvement in PCE was observed in the SVA-treated devices. With SVA-treatment, the highest PCE of the device remained at 10.5% with a Voc of 0.835 V, Jsc of 22.1 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.571. Although the Jsc of the device was enhanced, both the Voc and FF were slightly reduced. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the integrated current densities of the EQE spectra of the as-cast, TA, and SVA-treated 3BDT-5:Y6-based devices are 21.8, 22.1, and 22.5 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. As shown in Table 4, the mobilities of the blend films can be used to explain the changes in the Jsc and FF of the devices. Besides, when using TA-treatment on the 3BDT-4:Y6 blend film, the PCEs of the devices also slightly improved (5.82% vs. 6.39%), as shown in Table S6.† Therefore, both blend films were insensitive to the extra treatment processes.

As shown in Fig. 8, the surface morphologies of the as-cast, TA, and SVA-treated active layers were investigated by AFM. Compared with the as-cast blend film, the RMS of the TA-treated blend film slightly increased to 1.95 nm, showing better crystallization behavior. This can be used to explain the enhanced Jsc and FF of the device with TA-treatment. In the case of SVA-treatment, the blend film presented excess nanoscale phase separation with the highest RMS of 3.23 nm; however, the Jsc of the device is still improved even if the FF decreased. This result agrees with the crystalline property of the active layers revealed by the GI-WAXS measurement, as shown in Fig. S4.† Interestingly, when using extra treatments (TA or SVA) on the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film, the PCEs of the devices did not change significantly. Thus, the results reveal that 3BDT-5 is a very promising donor material for forming the optimized morphology of the active layer when blending with Y6 without any extra treatments. This is very useful for the fabrication of high efficiency large-area OSCs devices.

4. Conclusion
In summary, two A-π-D-π-A-type benzodithiophene trimer-based large planar rigid conjugated small molecules, 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5, were successfully developed for ASM-OSCs. 3BDT-4 and 3BDT-5 adopted 3-hexylrhodanine and 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate as their terminal groups, respectively. The two donor materials exhibited similar absorption spectra and energy levels. However, when blended with Y6 acceptor, the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film exhibited lower bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination, much higher hole and electron mobility, more ideal nanoscale phase separation, and stronger molecular crystallinity compared to the 3BDT-4:Y6 blend film. Consequently, the as-cast 3BDT-5:Y6-based ASM-OSC device exhibited a significantly higher PCE of 10.4% than that of the 3BDT-4:Y6-based device (PCE = 5.82%). To date, 3BDT-5 is the first small molecule-based OSC device with Y6 as the acceptor to exhibit a PCE breaking 10% without any extra treatments. More importantly, extra treatments were performed on the 3BDT-5:Y6 blend film, the PCEs of its devices did not change obviously, indicating that the blend film possesses an ideal and a stable nanoscale phase separation morphology. This remarkable result gives an important strategy for the industrial large-scale fabrication of highly efficient OSCs.
