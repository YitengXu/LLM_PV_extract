    , Accepted 18th November 2010First published on 22nd December 2010AbstractA novel Ru(II) sensitiser A597 containing the 4,4′-dioctylamido-2,2′-bipyridine ancillary ligand is synthesised without the need for purification steps. It shows an irreversible oxidation at 0.92 V in the cyclic voltammogram and an absorbtion at 539 nm in the UV-vis spectrum corresponding to an 1MLCT transition. Preliminary DFT calculations reveal that the HOMO is localised on the ruthenium metal centre and the thiocyanate ligands, whereas the LUMO is predominantly on the 4,4′-carboxy-2,2′-bipyridine ligand. The ruthenium complex exhibits a maximum power conversion efficiency (7.25%) compared with the known Z907 (8.32%) in dye-sensitised solar cells.
Introduction
The manufacture of photovoltaic (PV) cells has expanded significantly over the last decade, due to an urgent and growing demand for clean, renewable energy sources with carbon neutrality. A dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC) is one such type of PV cell and has been studied extensively since the early 1990s due to their low cost and ease of fabrication.1 The cells consist of dye molecules, which act as light absorbing/harvesting sensitisers and are coated onto a nanomaterial scaffold (TiO2). In most cases the iodine/iodide redox couple is used for transport of the electrical charge back to the dye.2 The Ru(II) complex photosensitisers such as N3, N719, Z907 (Fig. 1), C101, “black dye” (N749 a terpyridine derivative) and others show solar-to-energy conversion efficiencies up to 11–12% under AM (air mass) 1.5G irradiation (Table 1).3 However, there are two fundamental limitations associated with the exploitation of Ru(II) dye complexes in this context. Firstly, the lack of absorption in the red region (> 600 nm) of the visible spectrum4 and secondly, in many cases of Ru(II) dye preparation, several costly purification steps (involving column chromatography on Silica or Sephadex) are necessary.3,5 Indeed, it has been reported that up to 40% of the total cost of commercial dye production is due to purification procedures.6 This has major implications for the exploitation and potential commercialisation of novel dye complexes. The purification procedures along with optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic data of current state-of-the-art ruthenium dye sensitisers are summarised in Table 1.

 Fig. 1  The molecular structures of Z907 and A597. 
Here we utilise a bisamido-functionalised bipyridine ancillary ligand. The benefits to such an approach are three-fold: the amide moieties act in red-shifting the 1MLCT absorbance (incorporating electron withdrawing groups onto the ligand periphery has been shown to red-shift the absorption of complexes, via attenuation of the 1MLCT transitions);7 the reduced solubility of bis-amide compounds results in straightforward isolation of the target complex; and long-chain alkyl groups prevent the water-induced desorption of the dye from the TiO2 surface as well as inhibiting π-stacking of the complexes which can lead to less efficient DSSCs.
In this paper we report the synthesis and optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic characterisation of a new Ru(II) sensitiser, containing a 4,4′-dioctylamido-2,2′-bipyridine ligand, thiocyanate co-ligands and 4,4′-carboxy-2,2′-bipyridine in order to anchor the dye to TiO2. As with the custom for naming ruthenium dyes, this complex has been assigned the abbreviation A597 (Fig. 1).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterisation
Reaction of 4,4′-diethoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine with an excess of neat octylamine afforded the 4,4′-dioctylamido-2,2′-bipyridine ligand in 90% yield. The ruthenium dye was prepared by modification of the literature procedure for Z907.8 Subsequent reaction in a one-pot procedure with dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II)dimer followed by 4,4′-carboxy-2,2′-bipyridine in DMF and ammonium thiocyanate in EtOH resulted in precipitation of the desired complex from solution. Here, the increased insolubility of the amide moieties on the ligand resulted in reduced solubility of the complex and precipitation, with no further purification required.
The complex A597 was characterised by 1H NMR, IR, low and high resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and cyclic voltammetry. The positive ion MS identified an [M+NH4]+ species (run with NH4OAc additive). Elemental analysis showed the product as a 2:1 H2O solvate. The IR spectrum of A597 showed a peak at 2098 cm−1, characteristic of the cis-configuration of N-bound thiocyanate groups consistent with previous examples.14 Peaks at 1610 and 1675 cm−1 are assigned to the carbonyl stretches of the acids and amides respectively.

Cyclic voltammetry

The energy levels of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dye are important for electron transfer processes. Electrochemical studies and absorption spectroscopy were performed (Table 2) to ensure the HOMO matched the redox potential of the electrolyte and to verify the LUMO was suited for injecting electrons into the conduction band of TiO2. The cyclic voltammogram of A597 measured at a platinum disc electrode (scan rate 200 mV s−1, 1 × 10−3 M DMF solution) showed a metal based oxidation at 0.92 V, which is not fully reversible (Fig. 2). This is higher than the value quoted for the previously reported analogous hexyl-amido complex (0.80 V vs. Ag/AgCl on a glassy carbon electrode).15 This oxidation is due to the Ru2+/3+ couple and is 0.14 V more positive than for Z907. The difference in metal oxidation potentials is due to the donor influences of the 4,4′-dioctylamido-2,2′-bipyridine and 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′-bipyridine ligands, the former being more electron poor and therefore less stabilising for Ru3+. The data show that the I−/I3−redox couple (ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE) is more negative than the HOMO for A597 and thus the dye can be regenerated.

UV-vis spectroscopy

The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3 and Table 2) of A597 and Z907 were measured as DMF solutions. The spectrum of A597 showed two 1MLCT bands at 539 and 397 nm with molar extinction coefficients of 17500 and 16000 M−1cm−1 respectively. These bands are advantageously red-shifted by 7–11 nm compared with Z907 and show larger molar extinction coefficients. The bands at ∼312 nm are assigned to intra-ligand π–π* transitions of the 4,4′-dioctylamido-2,2′-bipyridine and 4,4′-carboxy-2,2′-bipyridine ligands. The band gap of A597 was approximated by measuring (and converting) the absorption edge of the UV-vis spectrum. Thus, the LUMO energy level was calculated (−3.56 eV) and is appropriate for efficient electron transfer into the conduction band of TiO2.

Density Functional Theory studies
Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies were performed to obtain the frontier molecular orbitals of the dye complexes (Fig. 4). However, whilst the accuracy of the orbital energies from calculations on complexes incorporating late transition metals is insufficient to warrant a detailed discussion of the HOMO–LUMO energies (and their comparison with experimentally observed absorption energies), an analysis of the frontier orbitals nevertheless provides a qualitative insight into the observed lowest energy absorptions. Firstly, it is noteworthy that two of the highest-energy occupied orbitals are sufficiently close in energy to be considered isoenergetic (ΔE <0.2 eV). Therefore, for A597 there is ambiguity as to which MO is involved in the lowest energy absorption process. For the HOMO (E = −4.82 eV) and HOMO-1 (E = −4.98 eV) the electron density is distributed primarily on the ruthenium metal centre and the NCS ligands, facilitating the 1MLCT transition. The same general distribution of orbitals is also observed for Z9073f (see ESI) as well as other Ru(II) complexes.3g,5d,16 Similarly, the LUMO (E = −3.10 eV) and the LUMO+1 (E = −2.91 eV) can be considered isoelectronic. The LUMO and LUMO+1 are mostly π* orbitals delocalised on the 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine and 4,4′-dioctylamido-2,2′-bipyridine ligands respectively. For Z907 the same distribution of orbitals is observed, however, the LUMO+1 (E = −2.04 eV) is not within experimental error of the LUMO (E = −2.40 eV) (ΔE = 0.36 eV) and cannot be considered isoelectronic. The charge transfer between the metal (HOMO) and 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine anchoring ligand (LUMO) has a large effect on the conversion efficiency of the DSSC. The position of these orbitals also accounts for the high extinction coefficients of the MLCT bands for A597. Although direct energy levels for molecules containing heavy metals cannot be reliably determined by DFT, relative energies can still be compared. Interestingly, from these calculations the HOMO–LUMO energy gap for A597 (ΔE = 1.72 eV) is slightly larger than that obtained for Z907 (ΔE = 1.35 eV) (Fig. 3 and Table 2), and therefore contrasts with the experimental observations.

Photovoltaic properties
The methods for the cell fabrication and photovoltaic characterisation are fully described in the experimental. The photocurrent voltage (I–V) curve (Fig. 5 and Table 2) for A597 gives a respectable short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 11.83 mAcm−2, which is lower than observed for Z907 (15.49 mAcm−2). However, the value of 0.778 V for the open circuit potential (VOC) shows an improvement on that of Z907 (0.739 V). In addition, the fill factor (ff) of 0.78 for A597 is superior to Z907 (0.72). These data yield an overall power conversion efficiency of 7.25% (1 sun) for A597 compared with 8.32% for Z907 under identical conditions. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) curve for A597 shows a plateau of over 45% from 400 to 650 nm with a maximum of 57% at 540 nm. The onset of the IPCE curve is ∼770 nm. In comparison, the IPCE curve for Z907 shows a maximum of 78% at 550 nm. These values are a little surprising given that the UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry data suggest A597 should show an improvement. However, despite the relatively low incident photon-to-current efficiency for A597, the comparable (with Z907) overall power conversion efficiency is notable and suggests that, with tuning of the redox properties (to increase the short current efficiency), this class of ruthenium complex could provide an extremely useful addition to the range of dyes currently exploited in DSSC devices.

Conclusions
We have described the high yielding, facile synthesis of a ruthenium sensitiser, A597, utilising a novel ligand whilst addressing the desirable physical characteristics of state-of-the-art Ru(II) dyes. Importantly, the synthesis of both the ancillary ligand and target complex was achieved without recourse to purification steps. The complex has competitive visible light absorption and tunable redox behaviour and we report fully elucidated frontier orbital descriptions. Finally, a comprehensive photovoltaic device assessment show clear potential for future prototypes.
Experimental section
Materials and Instruments
All reactions were performed with the use of vacuum line and Schlenk techniques. Reagents were commercial grade and were used without further purification. 4,4′-Diethoxycarbonyl-2,2′-bipyridine and Z907 were prepared according to the literature procedures.17,181H NMR spectra and were run on a NMR-FT Bruker 400 spectrometer and were recorded in d6-DMSO. 1H NMR chemical shifts (δ) were determined relative to internal TMS and are given in ppm. Mass spectra were carried out by the staff at Cardiff University. High resolution mass spectra were carried out by at the EPSRC National Mass Spectrometry Service at Swansea University. Infrared spectra were run on an ATR Nicolet iS10 spectrophotometer as solid samples. UV-Vis studies were performed on a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer as DMF solutions (6.3 × 10−5 mol L−1). Elemental analysis were performed by Warwick Analytical Services Ltd.
Electrochemical studies
Electrochemical studies were carried out using a Parstat 2273 potentiostat in conjunction with a three-electrode cell. The auxiliary electrode was a platinum wire and the working electrode a platinum (1.0 mm diameter) disc. The reference was a silver wire separated from the test solution by a fine-porosity frit. Solutions (10 ml DMF) were 1 × 10−3 mol dm−3 in the test compound and 0.1 mol dm−3 in [NBu4][PF6] as the supporting electrolyte. Solutions were deoxygenated with a stream of N2 gas and were maintained under a positive pressure of N2 during all measurements. Potentials are quoted vs. the [Fe(η5-C5H5)2]+/[Fe(η5-C5H5)2] couple (E0 = +0.45 V in DMF)19 as the internal standard.
Density functional theory
All calculations were performed on the Gaussian 03 program.20 Geometry optimisations were carried out without geometry constraints using the B3PW91 functional. The LANL2DZ basis set was used for the Ru centres, and was invoked with pseudo-potentials for the core electrons, a 6-31G(d,p) basis set for all coordinating atoms with a 6-31G basis set for all remaining atoms. All optimisations were followed by frequency calculations to ascertain the nature of the stationary point (minimum or saddle point).
Photovoltaic studies

Device Fabrication. 
A screen-printed double layer film of interconnected TiO2 particles was used as mesoporous negative electrode. A 8 μm thick film of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was first printed on the fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass electrode and further coated by a 5 μm thick second layer of 400-nm-sized light scattering anatase particles (CCIC, Japan). The detailed preparation procedures of TiO2 nanocrystals, pastes for screen-printing, and double-layer nanostructured TiO2 film have been reported previously.21 A TiO2 electrode was stained by immersing it into a dye solution containing 300 μM of dye sensitiser in the mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio: 1/1) overnight. After washing with acetonitrile and drying by air flow, the sensitised titania electrodes were assembled with thermally platinised conducting glass electrodes. The electrodes were separated by a 25 μm thick Surlyn hot-melt gasket and sealed by heating. The internal space was filled with a liquid electrolyte using a vacuum back filling system. The electrolyte-injecting hole made with a sandblasting drill on the counter electrode glass substrate was sealed with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover by heating.


Photovoltaic Characterisation. 
A 450 W xenon light source (Oriel, USA) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 {the equivalent of one sun at air mass (AM) 1.5} at the surface of solar cells. The current–voltage characteristics of the cell under these conditions were obtained by applying external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source metre (Keithley, USA). Photovoltaic performance was measured by using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.159 cm2.
