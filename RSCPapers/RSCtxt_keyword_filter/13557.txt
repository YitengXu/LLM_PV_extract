    , Accepted 26th May 2023First published on 29th May 2023AbstractAlternating weak electron donating and electron withdrawing units can be used to easily achieve wide bandgap (WBG) π-conjugated polymers for non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs), which can match well with low band gap (LBG) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) not only in the optical absorption, but also in appropriate energy levels. A wide sunlight absorption of the WBG polymer:LBG-NFA blending film and a deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the polymeric donor are the prerequisites for achieving a high short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC). Therefore, here we design two kinds of polymers by copolymerization of BDT and thiophene units, on which the electron withdrawing ester or carbonyl groups are introduced, namely PTO and PTC, respectively. The carbonyl substituent that has stronger positive electricity than the ester group can decrease the HOMO energy level of the polymer and lead to red-shifted absorption for PTC; however, owing to the larger steric hindrance of the carbonyl group and the cyclohexyl side chain, PTC exhibits weaker aggregation than PTO. Studies have found that the optical, electrochemical, and electrical properties and photovoltaic performances of the polymers are directly affected by the side chain substituent. An overall higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.83% for PTO is obtained compared to 10.66% for PTC in their bulky heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs. Although the ester group seems to be more efficient in the design of π-conjugated polymers, the carbonyl group which has been relatively less studied on WBG polymers reveals great potential for solar cell application due to the advantages of an improved VOC and enhanced hole mobility. This work compares in detail the effects of the ester and carbonyl groups on the physicochemical properties of polymers and provides ideas for the design of WBG polymeric donors for BHJ-PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) obtained by mixing electron donating and electron accepting organic semiconductors have attracted much attention due to their easily available materials and the advantage of solution processability, and have been recognized as one candidate of low-cost, light-weight and flexible photovoltaic technology.1–3 Thanks to the discovery of low band gap (LBG) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which can effectively absorb photons and transfer electrons generated from exciton disassociation, as well as their flexible spectral tunability, the design of wide band gap (WGB) polymeric donors becomes crucial.4 State-of the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE), around 20%, has been reported for non-fullerene PSCs by means of material tailoring and preparation optimization.5 An appropriate WBG polymeric donor should have the desired features as follows: (1) a deep lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that can reduce the voltage loss and improve the open-circuit voltage (VOC);6,7 (2) moderate self-aggregation characteristic in solution, so as to have a more uniform and appropriate nanophase separation with NFAs, and then improved exciton dissociation, charge transfer, and fill factor (FF);8,9 (3) an important requirement for the commercialization of PSCs is that polymeric donors should be low cost.10 Therefore, the design and synthesis of WBG polymeric donors based on the above characteristics play an important role in the development of PSCs.11
Several strategies have been reported to construct a WBG polymer, for instance incorporating weak electron withdrawing building blocks to design a donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer with charge transfer (CT) characteristic, among which, the alkylated 4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),12 2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (TAZ)13,14 and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TT)15 derivatives are extensively developed. Another WBG π-conjugated polymer contains repeated electron donating units and can be classified as a non-CT polymer; common are the homo- or copolymerized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),16,17 thieno[3,2-b]thiophene,18 thiophene, etc.19–22 However, to obtain a higher VOC for a solar cell, fluorine atoms, chlorine atoms and so on are introduced to decrease the energy levels.23–25 There are additional benefits in the introduction of highly electronegative atoms or substituents; the halogen atoms can help in regulating the inter-molecular interactions of the polymer backbone, and meanwhile, optimizing the morphologies and micro-structures in their film states. It is worth noting that the ester group has distinctive advantages in improving the polymer's electrical properties besides its electron deficiency that can well adjust the CT absorption, such as the well-known PTB7,26 PCE1027 and a series of polythiophenes.23,28–31 Moreover, different from halogen atoms, the ester substituent can be easily synthesized from a wide variety of alcohols or halogenated alkanes, and then appropriate alkyl chains can be directly introduced to monomers and the corresponding polymers, which are very important for solution processed materials.11,32,33
Similar to the ester group, the carbonyl group in ketone compounds has an electron-deficient carbon atom, but lacks the electron donating p–π conjugation existing in the ester group, which will show stronger positivity and more easily impact the optical and electrical properties of the polymer. However, studies on the carbonyl substituent used for the design of a semi-conducting polymer are relatively rare compared to those on the ester group.34,35 In this work, two easily available polymers named PTO and PTC were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1); they have the same conjugated backbone, but different ester or carbonyl substituents are fixed on the thiophene units, respectively, and cyclohexyls are adopted as side chains for their well-defined structures that can regulate the polymer self-assembly and packing.36–38 Both PTO and PTC showed deep lying HOMO energy levels and a corresponding high VOC of about 1 V when IT-4F was used as the electron acceptor for the pristine BHJ-PSCs. The electronic effect and the steric hindrance of the ester or carbonyl chains will significantly influence the polymer's optical and electrochemical properties, and meanwhile, in this study, we found that the working mechanisms of the PSCs varies with the substituents, such as exciton disassociation, charge carrier transfer and recombination, which are highly dependent on the aggregation and micro-structures of the polymers in their film states. All these results demonstrate that both the ester and carbonyl groups are desirable for the design of WBG polymers; especially for the latter, deep insights are obtained, which would help in proposing more refined design ideas.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and optical properties
Both PTO and PTC were synthesized by Stille polymerization of (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (BDT) and cyclohexyl 2,5-dibromothiophene-3-carboxylate (TO) or 2-cyclohexyl-1-(2,5-dibromothiophen-3-yl)ethan-1-one (TC), respectively. The molecular structure and detailed synthesis process of the two polymeric donors with different electron withdrawing units are shown in Fig. 1a and Scheme S1 in the ESI.† The monomer BDT was obtained from the purchase of commercial products; TO and TC were synthesized and characterized. Both PTO and PTC have good solubility in tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), etc. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with monodisperse polystyrene as the standard and tetrahydrofuran as the eluent shows that the number average molecular weight (Mn) of PTO and PTC is 50.13 and 51.96 kDa with a PDI of 2.99 and 3.12, respectively (Fig. S1 and S2†).
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers PTO and PTC in CB solution and their films are shown in Fig. 1b and c. In diluted CB solution, the two polymers have a wide and strong absorption band of about 300–600 nm, which is attributed to intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption. In the film states, the spectral absorption bands of PTO and PTC are red shifted, indicating that the inter-molecular interaction occurred compared with that in solution. The maximum absorption peaks (λmax) of PTO and PTC films are at 525 nm and 540 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, a more recognizable shoulder peak existed for PTO compared with that for PTC, indicating stronger molecular aggregation of PTO than that of PTC, which is attributed to the smaller steric hindrance of O atoms in the ester group compared with that of the methylene in the ketone group. However, the stronger electron withdrawing character of the carbonyl group makes TC a stronger electron absorbing unit than TO, resulting in red-shifted absorption and a lower optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.95 eV for PTC. Here, we can find that the subtle differences in the ester and ketone groups can influence the optical and aggregation characteristics of the polymers. The absorption spectra of PTO and PTC are very complementary to that of the IT-4F (structure depicted in Fig. 1a) film in the whole range of 300–800 nm (Fig. 1c), so IT-4F was adopted as the electron acceptor to study their photovoltaic performances in BHJ-PSCs. The absorption spectra of the blending PTO:IT-4F and PTC:IT-4F films are shown in Fig. 1d, relatively stronger absorption in 400–600 nm for PTO:IT-4F is obtained, probably because the stronger aggregates of PTO strengthened inter-molecular CT absorption.
Electrochemical properties
Using a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode and ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fe/Fe+) as the internal standard, the electrochemical properties of the two polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 1e). As expected, PTC has a slightly higher oxidation potential than PTO because of the stronger positive charge of the carbonyl group compared with that of the ester group; as a result, a deeper HOMO energy level (EHOMO) is obtained for PTC. The EHOMO values of PTO and PTC are estimated to be −5.61 eV and −5.65 eV, respectively, while the LUMO energy level (ELUMO) values of PTO and PTC are −3.59 eV and −3.70 eV respectively estimated from their corresponding Eoptg. The energy level diagrams of the two polymers and IT-4F acceptor are shown in Fig. 1f and the detailed data are summarized in Table 1. The electrochemical properties of PTO and PTC also show us that the carbonyl group is also an electron withdrawing substituent that can finely regulate the polymers’ energy levels as well as their optical and aggregation characteristics. Both PTO and PTC have relatively low-lying energy levels but match well with IT-4F, and then high VOC values are expected.

Micro-structures and molecular stacking
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed to investigate the molecular stacking of PTO and PTC in their pristine films. Both the films were fabricated by spin coating from their 10 mg mL−1 CB solutions. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, PTO and PTC exhibit relatively amorphous solid-state characteristics with inconspicuous (010) diffractions in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and (100) diffractions in the in-plane (IP) direction. The weak crystalline property for a semi-conducting polymer can be influenced by many factors,39 and here the twisted polymer backbones and bulky cyclohexyl side chains are the primary cause of their amorphous states.36 Even though the PTC film exhibits more pronounced (010) diffraction than PTO, the π–π stacking distance (dπ–π) of PTC (3.70 Å) is larger than that of PTO (3.67 Å) obtained from the wire cutting profile (Fig. 2c and d), indicating that PTO has tighter intermolecular π–π stacking than PTC, which agrees with their optical properties. However, PTC exhibits a smaller lamellar packing distance (dlamellar) than PTO calculated from the (100) diffraction peak in the IP direction; this may be caused by the larger steric hindrance of the carbonyl group according to our previous work. The GIWAXS analysis demonstrates that the choice of the side substituent plays an important role in regulating the polymer's stacking behaviors.

Photovoltaic performance
BHJ-PSCs were prepared by using the traditional device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS)/polymeric donor:IT-4F/3,3′-(1,3,8,10-tetraoxoanthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-2,9(1H,3H,8H,10H)-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amineoxide) (PDINO)/Al. PDINO is chosen as the cathode buffer layer due to its high conductivity, thickness-insensitive characteristic, and effective optimization of the work function for the cathode.40 A high VOC approaching 1 V was obtained for both PTO:IT-4F and PTO:IT-4F based devices with a donor:acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 and spin coated from CB solutions, attributed to the deep-lying EHOMO of the polymers. To further improve the PCE of the devices, 1,8-diiooctane (DIO) was used as the additive, and the blending films were thermally annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes and the optimized DIO concentration was 0.5% for both the polymers (Table 2 and Fig. 3). PTO:IT-4F exhibits better overall photovoltaic performance than PTC with the best PCE of 11.83%, VOC of 0.94 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.96 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.35%. In comparison, PTC:IT-4F based devices have a slightly higher VOC of 0.95 V, which is consistent with the deeper EHOMO of PTC; however, the JSC and FF are not high as those of the PTO:IT-4F based devices and result in a relatively low PCE of 10.66%. For the PTO-based device, the EQE values exceed 70% in the range 460–740 nm, and the maximum EQE recorded at 645 nm is up to 75.6%, which outperforms the PTC-based devices. Beside the low photo-response for PTC:IT-4F obtained in the EQE curve, the exciton dissociation, charge recombination, and charge transport can also influence the device parameters which will be discussed further.

Exciton dissociation, charge recombination, and charge transport
The photocurrent density (Jph)–effective voltage (Veff) curves are depicted in Fig. 4a; the Jph/saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) ratio can be used to judge the overall dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency of excitons.41,42Jph = JL − JD, JL is the photocurrent density and JD is the dark current density. Therefore, we can estimate the exciton dissociation efficiency (94.99% vs. 94.79%) and charge collection efficiency (80.26% vs. 78.00%) of PTO:IT-4F and PTC:IT-4F, respectively, under the optimal conditions, which could help in understanding the higher FF and JSC for PTO compared with those for PTC. In addition, the relationship of JSC and incident light intensity (Plight) is defined as JSC ∝ Pαlight,43,44 in which the α value provides information about the bimolecular recombination efficiency. Ideally, α = 1 indicates that the charge carrier is swept out before charge recombination and that there is no bimolecular recombination. For PTO:IT-4F and PTC:IT-4F cells, the α value is 0.975 and 0.974, respectively, which means that the bimolecular recombination in both the devices is suppressed well. Moreover, the dependence of VOC on Plight given by the relationship of VOC = n(kBT/e)ln(Plight) + C (n = ideal constant) is studied to clarify the influence of other recombination processes. The n values for PTO:IT-4F and PTC:IT-4F BHJ-PSCs are 1.04 kT/e and 1.06 kT/e, respectively, estimated from Fig. 4c, indicating that slight bimolecular and monomolecular recombination occurs. All the physical processes existed in the devices, and the polymers’ optical and condensate characteristics help in explaining the differences in the ester and carbonyl groups in designing semi-conducting polymers and fabricating BHJ-PSCs.

In order to further study the charge transfer mechanism in the blending films, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to study the hole mobility (μh) of the device using the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/MoOx/Ag and the electron mobility (μe) of the device using the device structure of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/PDINO/Al. The hole-only and electron-only J–V curves are shown in Fig. S3† and the corresponding data are listed in Table S1.† The μh and μe for PTO:IT-4F are 1.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and in contrast, they are 3.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for PTC:IT-4F. Although PTC:IT-4F has higher μh and μe, the more balanced μh/μe value of PTO:IT-4F is more conducive to charge extraction and collection,45,46 so as to obtain a higher JSC and FF (Table 3).

Characterization of film morphology
The molecular stacking and micro-structure of the PTO:IT-4F and PTC:IT-4F blending films were characterized using GIWAXS (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5a, a single diffraction arc in the OOP direction is obtained for the PTO:IT-4F blend, with a dπ–π of about 3.40 Å calculated from the cut line (Fig. 5c); this value is comparable to the reported dπ–π of IT-4F2 and matches well with the pristine IT-4F film (Fig. S4†). Different from PTO:IT-4F, the PTC:IT-4F blend has two distinguishable diffraction arcs as shown in Fig. 5b; one maybe rises from IT-4F with a dπ–π of 3.32 Å and the other one should be from the diffraction of the polymer PTC; the calculated dπ–π of 3.67 Å is comparable to that in the pristine PTC film. The micro-structures and packing patterns of the polymers can help in explaining the higher μh of the PTC:IT-4F based device. Nevertheless, the unbalanced charge carrier mobility in the PTC:IT-4F blending film may be because of the poorer miscibility between the donor and acceptor, which will be discussed later.

Film miscibility characterization
The donor:acceptor miscibility is estimated by measuring the contact angles (CA) of water or the organic solvent on the semi-conducting films. As shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2,† IT-4F has the smallest water CA of 91.5° compared with PTO of 103.7° and PTC of 104.9°, indicating that IT-4F has the highest hydrophilicity because it contains hydrophilic groups (i.e., F atoms, carbonyl and cyano groups). The surface tension (γ) of PTO, PTC, and IT-4F is further calculated by the Wu method as 42.7, 40.2, and 45.6 mN cm−1 respectively,47 indicating that the compatibility between PTO and IT-4F is better than PTC. Previous research by the Cho research group and Moon research teams shows that according to the empirical formula  (K is constant),48,49 the Floy–Huggins interaction parameter χ between PTO and IT-4F is slightly lower than that between the PTC and IT-4F (0.05 k vs. 0.18 k); therefore, the surface tension difference between PTO and IT-4F is smaller and results in better compatibility. Good miscibility between the donor and acceptor is crucial for the observation of high device performance such as effective exciton dissociation and balanced charge carrier transport.
Photoluminescence (PL) characterization
The charge transfer mechanism between the donor and acceptor was characterized by their photoluminescence (PL) properties. The peak PL wavelength (λpeak) for PTO is 627 nm (Fig. S6†), which is quenched by about 96.8% in the presence of IT-4F, indicating that most excitons produced in PTO are dissociated at the donor/acceptor interfaces. On the other hand, only 2.5% residual emission for IT-4F (λpeak = 785 nm) is observed in the same blending film, which demonstrates that the photons absorbed by IT-4F are fully utilized in the PTO:IT-4F devices. PTC shows red-shifted PL compared to PTO with a λpeak at 658 nm; this agrees with their UV-vis absorption. The PL of PTC and IT-4F can also be quenched by each other of about 98.1% and 95.6%, respectively, indicating that charge transfer occurs in the PTC:IT-4F films. The overall exciton dissociation efficiency of PTO:IT-4F is higher than that of PTC:IT-4F, which can help in explaining the high JSC for the PTO:IT-4F based devices.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two easily achieved WBG π-conjugated polymeric donors PTO and PTC, which have the same BDT and thiophene alternated backbone, but different electron withdrawing ester or carbonyl groups, respectively. The side chain substituents can effectively influence the polymer's optical and electrochemical properties and result in a narrower bandgap and deeper HOMO energy levels for PTC compared to PTO, which can be attributed to the stronger electropositivity of the carbonyl group. However, because of the larger steric hindrance of carbonyl and the cyclohexyl side chains, PTC exhibits relatively weak aggregation characteristic and then feeble crystallized micro-structures in the pristine films. A high VOC approaching 1 V was obtained for the as-cast polymer:IT-4F BHJ PSCs; even when the active layers were treated with an additive and thermal annealing, the VOC of the PTO:IT-4F and PTC:IT-4F based devices maintains at 0.94 and 0.95 V, respectively. Because of the high exciton dissociation and low charge recombination efficiency, PTC exhibits higher JSC and FF in the BHJ-PSCs; as a result, the PCE of PTC:IT-4F (10.66%) is slightly lower than that of PTO:IT-4F (11.83%), even though the μh of PTC is higher than that of PTO caused by the stronger crystallization. A further study indicated that the higher performance of PTO is also related to the better miscibility of the donor and acceptor and then the more balanced charge carrier mobility in the active layer. This study demonstrates that the weak electron withdrawing carbonyl or ester group can be easily employed to design WBG polymers for PSCs; especially the carbonyl group can significantly decrease the HOMO energy level of the polymer and benefit the realization of a high VOC.
