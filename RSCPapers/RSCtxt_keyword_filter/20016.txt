We find that excess of PbI2 in the precursor solution results in crystalline PbI2 in the final thin film that is located at the grain boundaries. From UPS we find that this crystalline PbI2 phase has no direct impact on the electronic structure of MAPbI3. In contrast to this, temperature dependent absorption measurements indicate a systematic change in the temperature dependence of the exciton binding energy in the perovskite. We also observe a decrease in the critical temperature and a concomitant smearing out of the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transition as a function of excess PbI2. Our results thus help to better understand the exact role of PbI2 in the perovskite layer and pave the way for a more tailored design of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Hybrid perovskite based solar cells have evolved significantly within the last few years, when the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells improved from 9% in 2012 to 22.7% in 2017, which is now comparable to that of the well-established inorganic silicon solar cells.1 Furthermore, significant steps forward regarding the environmental and long term stability of perovskite solar cells could be made,2,3 so that perovskite solar cells have serious potential towards a commercial product. In principle, the perovskite layer in solar cell devices is produced by the synthesis of only two precursor compounds, which are an organic salt, e.g. methylammonium iodide (MAI), and a metallic salt, like lead iodide (PbI2), to form the perovskite, for example the widely studied methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). It is possible to synthesise a large number of different hybrid perovskites by mixing different precursor compounds or by changing the stoichiometric ratio between the organic and metallic salts. Current state-of-the-art high performance perovskite solar cells make use of this chemical versatility, where a mixture of components in the A and X positions in the ABX3 perovskite structure is used.3 Another approach to increase the solar cell PCE is to use a certain degree of excess PbI2 in the precursor solution. Typically, a maximum device PCE is obtained when the MAI:PbI2 ratio contains an excess of PbI2 of 5–10 mol%.4–9 The microscopic origin of this beneficial effect on the device efficiency is not fully understood. By some authors, the beneficial effect on device efficiency was attributed to an increased charge extraction at the interface between the perovskite and the electron transport layer,5,7,10 though a concomitant increase in crystallinity with PbI2 content has also been proposed.5 While the impact of excess PbI2 in solar cell devices has been addressed in several works in the past, systematic studies on the impact of PbI2 on the structural and the spectroscopic properties of neat MAPbI3 are yet rare and limited to room temperature.5,7,11
Here we investigate the impact of varying amounts of excess PbI2 on the well-known hybrid perovskite MAPbI3 by studying the surface morphology, structural properties, and temperature dependent absorption. From surface morphology and structural investigations we find a correlation between additional PbI2 content and the crystallite or grain sizes of the perovskite films. By combining these results with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) we identify that PbI2 remains as a pure phase and is mainly located in the grain boundaries. Furthermore, we analysed the temperature dependent absorption spectra of the MAPbI3 samples with different excess PbI2 contents in the temperature range of the well-known phase transition between tetragonal and orthorhombic crystal structures. We show that excess PbI2 impacts on the phase transition behaviour. For a higher amount of excess PbI2 the transition temperature decreases and the temperature range of the phase transition broadens. This behaviour can be understood by considering the difference in the volume expansion coefficients of PbI2 and MAPbI3. Detailed modelling of the absorption spectra within the temperature range of 5–300 K reveals a systematic change in the temperature trends of the exciton binding energies as a function of excess PbI2 content. This work thus shows that even though excess PbI2 merely accumulates in the grain boundaries, it directly impacts on the electronic properties of the perovskite.
Results
MAPbI3 thin films with different degrees of excess PbI2 were synthesised by an anti-solvent approach,5 where the MAI:PbI2 ratio of the two precursor compounds was altered in the range between 1:1 (0 mol% excess PbI2) and 1:1.25 (25 mol% excess PbI2) in steps of 5 mol% excess PbI2. We measured the performance of MAPbI3 with different amounts of excess PbI2 in a solar cell layer structure of FTO/compact-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au and indeed observe a small improvement in the performance of some solar cells for 5 mol% excess PbI2 in the precursor solution. However overall, the power conversion efficiency reduces for higher amounts of excess PbI2, consistent with recent publications (see the ESI† for details).4–8Fig. 1a shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the pure MAPbI3 samples with 0 and 25 mol% excess PbI2 in the precursor solution. The SEM pictures of the remaining samples are shown in the ESI.† All films are compact and polycrystalline. The average grain size, as observed in the SEM image, decreases as a function of excess PbI2 content from 200 nm for the 0 mol% sample to about 100 nm for the 25 mol% sample (see Fig. 1b, top panel, and the ESI† for detailed analysis). XRD measurements reveal the typical patterns of MAPbI3 (Fig. 1c), with the 〈110〉 reflection at a characteristic 2θ angle of 14° for all samples.12 Generally, the peak characteristic for crystalline PbI2, indicated by an asterisk, is located at 2θ ∼ 12.7°. In the sample without any excess PbI2, the XRD pattern shows that the film is composed of a pure perovskite phase without any PbI2 phase. A PbI2 phase appears when an excess proportion of PbI2 over MAI was used. With increasing amounts of excess PbI2, the characteristic PbI2 peak increases in intensity for the 5 to 25 mol% samples. Fig. 1b (middle panel) shows the actual amount (in wt%) of PbI2 present in the perovskite films determined from the XRD peak areas. We find that the amount of crystalline excess PbI2 in the thin film correlates linearly with the increase in the excess weight ratio of PbI2 in the precursor solution. This implies that PbI2 forms a separate, crystalline phase rather than being incorporated in the perovskite structure. Detailed calculations of PbI2 content in MAPbI3 films from the 〈110〉 and 〈002〉 peaks of MAPbI3 and the 〈001〉 peaks of PbI2 from XRD are given in the ESI.† We next considered the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 〈110〉MAPbI3 peak and used the Scherrer equation, , where d is the crystallite size, K = 0.829 the Scherrer constant for reflections in spherical crystallites, λ the X-ray wavelength, θ the Bragg angle,13 and β is the line broadening at FWHM, to calculate the crystallite size of MAPbI3. The upper panel in Fig. 1b shows the calculated crystallite sizes from FWHM for different MAPbI3 samples in addition to the grain sizes obtained from SEM. We find that the crystallite size and the grain size of MAPbI3 decrease with increasing excess PbI2 amount in the films, suggesting an altered crystallization behaviour. Also, the bulk crystallite sizes calculated from XRD are very similar to the measured average grain size based on the grain size distribution from the surface SEM for all samples. The good match between the grain size and crystallite size in all samples implies that PbI2 is located in the grain boundaries and not within the grains, as a reduced crystallite size compared to the grain size would be expected in the latter case.

The asterisk indicates the 〈001〉 PbI2 reflection, and the triangle corresponds to the 〈110〉 MAPbI3 reflection. 
In addition, XPS measurements on the samples with different PbI2 contents were performed (see the ESI†). Similar to the results obtained from XRD, a linear correlation between excess PbI2 in the precursor solution and the amount in the film is found in general (Fig. 1b, bottom). Upon close inspection, the data hint at a slightly larger relative content of excess PbI2 in the film when a higher amount of excess PbI2 is used in solution. Given that XPS is a surface-sensitive technique this might point to a preferential accumulation of excess PbI2 on the surface when present in larger amounts, consistent with literature reports,14 though follow-up investigations would be required to confirm this.
In order to study the impact of excess of PbI2 on the electronic structure of the valence band, UPS measurements have been performed on all samples. Fig. 2a shows the density of states in the valence band region of the perovskite which is similar for all contents of excess PbI2 in the precursor solution. From the difference between the energy of the UV photons of 21.2 eV and the cut-off of the signal at about 16.7 ± 0.15 eV we infer a work function of about Wf = 4.5 ± 0.15 eV for all samples. The binding energy of about 1.65 eV for the valence band edge therefore translates into an ionization energy of IE = 6.15 ± 0.15 eV with respect to the vacuum level. These values are somewhat larger than the commonly reported ones, e.g. IE = 5.4 eV,15 due to differences in the valence band readout procedure.16 Importantly, we observe no systematic changes either in work function or ionization energy with PbI2 content. From this, we conclude that the energy levels of the perovskite are not significantly altered by the presence of excess PbI2. However, beyond the valence band onset we observe the emergence of a metallic Fermi edge upon increasing excess of PbI2 content in the precursor solution (see Fig. 2b). The emergence of the metallic Fermi edge is attributed to the presence of small amounts of metallic lead Pb(0) whose signature could also clearly be observed in XPS measurements (see Fig. 2c). This additional XPS feature increases with excess PbI2 and it is not observed in films of neat MAPbI3 or PbI2 (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†). Our finding of an IE that is independent of excess PbI2 is in contrast to previous observations by some of the authors, where an increase in IE was found for excess PbI2.17 This discrepancy seems to be caused by differences in preparation conditions to create excess PbI2, as in the previous study no metallic lead and no PbI2 phases could be observed in the samples with excess PbI2. Furthermore, in that study, the Pb2+ ions are evenly distributed as interstitials in the film, changing the overall charge carrier balance.

In order to elucidate possible associated changes in the electronic structure, we have studied the optical properties of our samples as a function of temperature. MAPbI3 is well known to show a transition from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic phase upon cooling. The temperature dependent absorption spectra of a MAPbI3 thin film are displayed in Fig. 3a. Upon cooling from room temperature (red curve) to 150 K (orange curve), the absorption onset shifts to the red and develops a more prominent peak at the low energy edge. This peak is attributed to absorption from excitons in the tetragonal phase.18,19 This peak, at 1.6 eV for 150 K, disappears gradually upon further cooling. Concomitantly, an additional peak develops (at 1.7 eV for 145 K, blue curve) that also shifts to the red with further cooling to 5 K. This newly emerging peak is attributed to the absorption from excitons in the orthorhombic phase.20 Therefore, the two peaks, denoted by (o) and (t), serve as an indicator for the presence of a tetragonal or an orthorhombic crystal structure.

(d) First derivative of the curves in (b) alongside Gaussian fits. (e) Phase transition temperature and FWHM of the transition deduced from the fits in (d) as a function of excess PbI2 (in mol%) in the precursor solution. The grey lines are parabolic fits and serve as a guide to the eye. 
For both structures, the bathochromic shift of the absorption onset is well understood.21,22 Upon cooling MAPbI3, there is significant thermal contraction that improves interatomic coupling thus decreasing the bandgap. This effect dominates over the also existing widening of the bandgap due to a reduction in electron–phonon coupling upon cooling.21
The temperature onset of the phase transition can be identified by the first appearance of the orthorhombic exciton peak (near 1.7 eV) upon cooling, and the phase transition can be considered as completed when any signature of the tetragonal excitonic peak (near 1.6 eV) has fully disappeared. Temperature-dependent absorption curves for the different amounts of excess PbI2 are provided in the ESI.† It turns out that for all samples, the phase transition has started at 145 K and it has well advanced at 140 K. The degree to which the phase transition has already advanced can be assessed by considering the relative intensity of the exciton peaks from the orthorhombic and the tetragonal phase. In Fig. 3c, the absorption spectra of the different samples taken at 140 K are compared, normalized to unity at the orthorhombic exciton peak (1.7 eV). With increasing content of excess PbI2, a higher signal intensity is observed from a remaining exciton peak of the tetragonal phase near 1.6 eV. This implies that, at a given temperature, the phase transition is completed to a lesser degree when the content of excess PbI2 is higher.
We evaluated the temperature-dependent intensity of the signal at 1.62 eV to determine the temperature Tc of the phase transition (Fig. 3b). In this representation, the onset of the phase transition can be associated with the deviation of the signal from unity. The point of inflexion in this curve can then be assigned to the critical transition temperature Tc. This can be easily identified by calculating the first derivative of the optical density, which results in a peak function (Fig. 3d). This approach is analogous to the former works in which temperature induced phase transitions in organic semiconductors were analysed.23,24 The critical transition temperature and the FWHM of the transition are displayed as a function of excess PbI2 content in Fig. 3e. With increasing content of excess PbI2, a lower temperature is required to induce the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition upon cooling. Furthermore, the width of the transition is increased. In the context of Fig. 1 we have found that increasing the amount of excess PbI2 also reduces the grain size. To exclude that a reduced grain size is responsible for the change in Tc, we have also investigated samples with 0 mol% excess PbI2 and three different grain sizes, that is 200 nm, 500 nm and 900 nm. As we could not observe any trend in Tc with grain size (see Table S4 in the ESI†), we exclude that the change in grain size in the samples with different degrees of excess PbI2 significantly contributes to the reduction in Tc.
The structural changes induced by the presence of excess PbI2 impact not only on the width and the critical temperature at which the phase transition occurs, but also on the binding energy of the exciton in the tetragonal or in the orthorhombic phase. To analyse this behaviour we deconvoluted the absorption spectrum of MAPbI3 for each of the two crystal structures in the contributions from bound and continuum states according to Elliott's theory.25 Such an analysis readily yields the binding energy Eb of the exciton, as detailed in the ESI.† The binding energies obtained from the analysis in the framework of Elliott's theory for the two phases at different temperatures are displayed in Fig. 4a for the samples with different amounts of excess PbI2. We observe different evolutions of Eb(T) in particular for the temperature range above 150 K. For low amounts of excess PbI2, the binding energy reduces upon heating, while for a high excess of PbI2, it increases.

The shaded area indicates the temperature range of the phase transition. (b) Slope of a linear fit to the exciton binding energies in the range of 160–300 K as a function of excess PbI2 content in the precursor solution. The dashed line is a guide to the eye. 
This change in the slope of Eb(T) is displayed as a function of PbI2 content in Fig. 4b. In a hydrogen-like model, such as the one used in Elliott's theory, the exciton binding energy depends on the reduced mass μ of the electron–hole pair and on the effective dielectric constant εeff, according to . When the reduced mass is assumed to be independent of temperature,26 the variation in the temperature dependence of the exciton binding energy reflects the temperature dependence of the effective dielectric constant for MAPbI3 with different amounts of excess PbI2 content. The reported experimental values for the exciton reduced mass range from 0.10 to 0.15 me,26–30 and the theoretical values span 0.09 to 0.13 me.31–34 We have thus used a mean value of (0.12 ± 0.03) me. From this, we obtain values of the dielectric constant in the range of 8.6 ± 1.9 in the orthorhombic phase, and of 11 ± 3 in the tetragonal phase (see Fig. S11 in the ESI†).
Discussion
To summarize the results of the structural analysis we find that an increased amount of excess PbI2 in the precursor solution translates into an increased amount of crystalline PbI2 in the resulting films. Based on the XRD, XPS and UPS measurements we conclude that PbI2 is located in the grain boundaries. This is in accordance with several reports in the literature.4,14
With this knowledge, the impact of PbI2 on the transition from the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase upon cooling can be rationalized. One aspect to consider regarding the impact of excess PbI2 on the phase transition is that the volume of the orthorhombic unit cell is larger than that of the tetragonal one. A simple estimate based on data from the literature (see the ESI† for details)12 shows that at the temperature of the phase transition, Tc, the reduction in volume, ΔV, obtained when cooling from room temperature happens to be just the same as the extra volume required when forming the orthorhombic phase at Tc. However, for higher PbI2 content, some of the MAPbI3 volume, in particular at the grain boundaries, is replaced by PbI2. Its thermal expansion coefficient is significantly below that of MAPbI3, that is 1.2 × 10−4 K−1 (PbI2) instead of 3.8 × 10−4 K−1 (MAPbI3).21,35 Yet upon cooling from room temperature to Tc0% (the temperature at which phase transition occurs for 0 mol% excess PbI2) the relative change in volume, ΔV/V, within the MAPbI3 phase remains unaltered and, in principle, within the MAPbI3, the transition to the orthorhombic phase should proceed. Experimentally, however, we observe that in samples with, say 25 mol% PbI2, additional cooling by a few Kelvin to Tc25% is required for the phase transformation to take place. It seems that extra space needs to be created by further cooling. Based on this observation we suggest that PbI2 at the grain boundaries and possibly on the surface impedes the phase transition at Tc0% in a mechanical way, e.g. by causing stress or strain or unsuitable space filling after cooling. In the literature, the values reported for the phase transition temperature in thin films cover a range of 140–170 K.18,19,36 Our finding thus suggests that the discrepancy from the corresponding values for single crystals (∼162 K) might perhaps be due to different amounts of PbI2 incorporated in the film.37,38
We now consider the changes induced in Eb and the dielectric constant with excess PbI2 content. The films have exciton binding energies of around 25 meV (orthorhombic phase) and 15 meV (tetragonal phase), which are in good agreement with typical values reported using this method.39–42 Our obtained value of ε is in the range of 9 (orthorhombic phase) to 11 (tetragonal phase). This fits very well with the value reported for the real part of the dielectric constant in the higher frequency range (4–7 × 1014 Hz) reported by Lin et al. on the basis of ellipsometric measurements.43 These values would imply that the dielectric screening is largely controlled by the electronic polarizability, yet not by the slow dielectric response of the lattice due to longitudinal optical phonons. This is reasonable since the electronic transition resulting in exciton formation (e.g. at 750 nm, corresponding to 4 × 1014 s−1) occurs on a much faster timescale than molecular motions (e.g. the librations of the MA cation at 59 cm−1 = 2 × 1012 s−1)44 or than oscillations in the crystal such as longitudinal phonon modes. We note, however, that the slower rotational, librational or phonon processes may become relevant and contribute to an energetic relaxation when the exciton is considered on longer timescales than absorption, e.g. before emission or dissociation occurs.
The overall higher exciton binding energy in the orthorhombic phase compared to the tetragonal phase can be understood by recalling that . Upon the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition, the Pb–I–Pb bond angles reduce.45 The effective mass depends on the crystal structure46 and on the bond angle Pb–I–Pb, with smaller angles restricting the charge transfer and thus increasing the effective mass.28 Concomitantly, a restricted charge transfer is also associated with a reduced polarizability, and thus with a smaller effective dielectric constant in the optical frequency range, εeff. A correspondingly higher exciton mass as well as a reduced polarizability can thus nicely account for the observed higher exciton binding energy in the orthorhombic phase compared to the tetragonal phase. This is also consistent with the observation of a higher optical gap in the orthorhombic phase that was also observed in the corresponding temperature dependent emission spectra of MAPbI3.47
The evolution of the binding energy with temperature that is observed in the tetragonal phase and the associated changes with excess PbI2 are more complex to understand. For the stoichiometric sample, i.e. 0 mol% excess PbI2, we find an increase of the binding energy upon cooling. The same trend upon cooling was also observed in the literature, where Davies et al. and Yamada et al. reported increasing exciton binding energies by applying Elliott's theory to the absorption and transmittance spectra of MAPbI3 thin films, respectively.40,48 However, we clearly observe that this intrinsic temperature trend of MAPbI3 changes with the amount of excess PbI2, even leading to a reversed temperature trend for the highest PbI2 contents. Evidently, this phenomenon is associated with the accumulation of PbI2 in grain boundaries, and possibly also at the perovskite surface. Since the volume expansion coefficients of MAPbI3 and PbI2 differ, it is conceivable that changes in the interfacial area between MAPbI3 and PbI2 contribute to this effect.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have studied the impact of excess PbI2 in the precursor solution on the structure and on the temperature dependent optical properties of MAPbI3 thin films. Our results suggest that a crystalline PbI2 phase accumulates in grain boundaries, and possibly on the surface. This is associated with a decrease in grain size, and a reduction in the critical temperature for the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition. While ionization energy and work function of the MAPbI3 are not affected by the presence of crystalline PbI2, we observe associated changes in the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and thus the exciton binding energy.
Experimental methods
Sample preparation
The quartz and FTO substrates were cleaned with detergent diluted in deionized water, rinsed with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol, and dried with clean dry air. After cleaning, the quartz substrates were transferred in a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere. The MAI precursor powder was synthesised as described elsewhere.49 The MAI (1.0 M) and PbI2 (1.0 M) precursor powders were dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide overnight under stirring conditions. The resulting solution was coated onto the FTO and quartz substrates for a spin-coating process. The substrate was then spun at 3000 rpm for 50 s and after eight seconds toluene (150 μL) was dropped onto the center of the substrate. This instantly changed the color of the substrate from transparent to light brown. The perovskite film was annealed at 373 K for 20 min. For 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% excess PbI2 content, molar concentrations of PbI2 were changed with constant MAI concentration in the precursor. To prevent the samples from being affected by air and humidity, 40 mg mL−1 poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA; Aldrich) in butyl acetate was spin-coated on top of the perovskite at 2000 rpm for 30 s. All steps were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box.
Sample characterization

XRD. 
The structural and phase characterization of the MAPbI3 layer deposited on the FTO substrate was carried out by reflection mode XRD using a Philips/PANalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer with CuKα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm), operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The diffractograms were recorded in the 2θ range of 10 to 45° with a 2θ step size of 0.008°.


SEM. 
The surface morphology was characterized by field emission SEM using a Zeiss 1530 instrument with an accelerating voltage of 3.0 kV.


UPS and XPS. 
UPS and XPS measurements were performed on a multi-chamber UHV system at a pressure of 5 × 10−10 mbar using a Phoibos 100 hemispherical analyzer (Specs). As the X-ray excitation source a MgKα anode was used (hν = 1252.6 eV, probing depth <10 nm) and for UPS a monochromatic helium UV source (VUV 5000, VG Scienta) operated at 21.22 eV. The solution processed perovskite samples were transferred into the setup through a nitrogen atmosphere and were at no time exposed to air.

Temperature dependent absorption measurements
For temperature-dependent absorption spectra, we used a home-built setup. The sample was put into a continuous flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments, Optistat CF). We used a tungsten lamp as a light source impinging on the sample in transmission. The transmitted light was detected using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Andor iDus) coupled to a spectrograph (Andor Shamrock 303i).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) SEM images of MAPbI3 films with 0 and 25 mol% excess PbI2 in the precursor solution. (b) (top) Average crystallite and grain size as a function of excess PbI2 (converted from mol% to wt%) in the precursor solution; (middle, bottom) weight percentage of PbI2 in the film calculated from XRD and XPS. The grey dashed lines with a slope of 1 serve as a guide to the eye. (c) XRD patterns of MAPbI3 films with different mol% of excess PbI2 in the precursor solution as indicated. The asterisk indicates the 〈001〉 PbI2 reflection, and the triangle corresponds to the 〈110〉 MAPbI3 reflection.	 

 	Fig. 2  UPS and XPS measurements of MAPbI3 films with excess PbI2 (in mol%) in the precursor solution as indicated. (a) Region of the high binding energy cutoff position as well as the valence band region. (b) Close up of the region around the valence band onset. (c) XPS signal of the lead 4f7/2 level where the metallic Pb(0) feature is marked by the shaded area.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Temperature dependent absorption spectra of MAPbI3 in the range of 5–300 K. Thin lines without label correspond to temperatures 260 K, 220 K, 180 K, 160 K, 140 K, 120 K, 80 K, and 40 K. (b) Normalized absorption coefficient at 1.62 eV photon energy corresponding to the absorption from the tetragonal phase as a function of temperature for different contents of excess PbI2 (in mol%) in the precursor solution. (c) Absorption spectra at T = 140 K normalized to the excitonic peak of the orthorhombic phase with different amounts of excess PbI2 (in mol%). (d) First derivative of the curves in (b) alongside Gaussian fits. (e) Phase transition temperature and FWHM of the transition deduced from the fits in (d) as a function of excess PbI2 (in mol%) in the precursor solution. The grey lines are parabolic fits and serve as a guide to the eye.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Exciton binding energies as a function of temperature for different amounts of excess PbI2 (in mol%) in the precursor solution. The shaded area indicates the temperature range of the phase transition. (b) Slope of a linear fit to the exciton binding energies in the range of 160–300 K as a function of excess PbI2 content in the precursor solution. The dashed line is a guide to the eye.
