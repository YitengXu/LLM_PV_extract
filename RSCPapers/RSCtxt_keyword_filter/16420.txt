    , Accepted 4th January 2016First published on 6th January 2016AbstractCompared to the fast electron transport in perovskite and rapid electron injection from perovskite to TiO2 nanoparticle scaffold, the slower electron transport rate in mesoporous TiO2 is reported to be a hindrance factor for power conversion efficiency. One-dimensional nanomaterials are believed to show faster carrier transport rate. In this paper, vertically aligned one-dimensional TiO2 nanocones on transparent conducting oxide were synthesized and utilized as a promising scaffold for perovskite solar cells. A simple concentration-dependent CH3NH3PbI3 seeding spin-coating method was developed to effectively improve the surface coverage at low cost. The resultant perovskite solar cells realized an average power conversion efficiency up to 11%, which is higher than that of rectangular TiO2 nanorods-based device. Besides the faster electron transport rate and slower recombination in such one-dimensional nanostructures, we attribute the superior performance of the nanocone-based device to the fact TiO2 nanocone arrays allow more CH3NH3PbI3 to deposit. By scaling up the nanocone-based devices to 1.2 cm2, they yielded a decent average power conversion efficiency of ∼6%. The combination of TiO2 nanocones with perovskite paves a way to take full advantage of one-dimensional nanomaterials and organic–inorganic perovskites for photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
The rapid development of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells (PSCs) has sparked a low-cost, highly efficient avenue to harness the vast clean solar energy. PSCs first emerged in 2009 as unstable liquid electrolyte-based solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.1 Later the PCE was improved to 6.5% by changing the electrolyte components in 2011.2 By employing the solid organic hole transport material 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-dimethoxyphenyl-amine-)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), CH3NH3PbI3 sensitized solar cell on Al2O3 scaffold yielded an impressive PCE of 10.9%.3 Since then, PSCs have been developed at an unprecedented rate. The PCEs of both sequential deposited and vapor deposited PSCs were boosted up to 15% in 2013.4,5 An efficiency of 16.72% was achieved on a mesoscopic scaffold in early 2014.6 By August 2014, the PCE climbed to 19.3% by engineering the interface on a planar device.7
The abundant material source, ease of fabrication, and low temperature processing paves a way for low-cost hybrid organic–inorganic PSCs. Moreover, perovskites serve three primary functions that make them an excellent solar cell active layer: light absorption, exciton generation and separation, both electron and hole transport.3,8–10 The most intensively studied CH3NH3PbI3 is a direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.55 eV, which determines its light absorption offset up to 800 nm.11 Ultrafast exciton generation right after photoexcitation, almost instantaneous charge separation, long carrier lifetime, and slow recombination are properties of CH3NH3PbI3.12 In addition, the small effective mass of electrons and holes generated in CH3NH3PbI3 promotes rapid transport of these carriers.13 The lifetime of the carriers are in the hundreds of nanosecond range, leading to much slower recombination and much longer diffusion length from 100 nm to 1000 nm.12,14,15 Furthermore, ambipolar charge transport property was verified for perovskite,8,11 which means both electrons and holes can be transported through the sensitizer by itself.
The property of ambipolar charge transport for perovskite simplifies the structure of PSCs with the emergence of planar PSCs,5 keeping a record PCE of 19.3%.7 To date, although planar PSCs and nanoparticle-based PSCs are comparable, scientists anticipate that a combination of planar and mesoporous architecture will prompt further improvement for PSCs.16 However, for PSCs utilizing mesoporous TiO2 as a scaffold, inefficient electron mobility in the TiO2 scaffold is unbalanced with the fast electron injection from the perovskite.12 Finding and employing a faster electron-transport material is expected to further increase the performance of PSCs.12 Fortunately, one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures have shown superior carrier transporting rate and longer survivability of photogenerated carriers, by offering direct transport pathway and reducing the electron scattering.17–23 In addition, compared to the relatively smooth photoanode in the planar device, the protruding 1-D nanomaterials would increase the roughness and further enhance the adhesion between the perovskite and the scaffolds. Taking all the properties of perovskites and 1-D nanomaterials into account, it is expected that using vertically aligned 1-D semiconductors on transparent conducting oxide substrate as photoanodes will elevate the performance of PSCs without the concern for its small surface area owing to the ambipolar charge transport property. With the guidance of this point in mind, it is believed that sparing ample space rather than specific surface area of 1-D nanomaterials for perovskite loading appears to be more crucial to make them act synergistically in photovoltaic application. Fortunately, nanocone-shaped arrays require less space than nanorods and nanowires. Nanocone arrays are also reported to be beneficial for light harvesting.24,25 Moreover, both theoretical and experimental results prove there is an electrostatic potential that drives electron moving faster from perovskite to the nanocones.26,27
Another issue that needs to be addressed for 1-D nanomaterials or other mesoporous scaffolds-based perovskite solar cells is how to improve the coverage and filling of perovskite.4,28–30 Vacuum deposition and vapor-assisted methods are reported as two successful routes to obtain uniform and dense perovskite film, but they are suitable for planar devices only.5,7,31 100% surface coverage can not be achieved via spin-coating during solution-processed methods. Great efforts are still needed to yield homogeneous perovskite layer over a large area.
In this report, vertically aligned rutile TiO2 nanocone arrays (NCs) on transparent conducting oxide were synthesized. Meanwhile, to improve the quality of the perovskite layer, a newly developed, more effective perovskite seeding spin-coating method is also introduced in this paper. Via the seeding spin-coating method, the NCs are expected to function synergistically with inorganic–organic perovskite in photovoltaic application due to the unique conical morphology and excellent photovoltaic properties of the perovskites. Moreover, scaling up of the NCs-based solar cells to 1.2 cm2 is also attempted in this study.
Experimental section
TiO2 nanocone synthesis
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (F:SnO2, 13 Ω per square, Aldrich) was successively cleaned by water, acetone and ethanol, followed by ultraviolet treatment for 30 min. NCs on FTO substrate were synthesized following the procedures as below. 7.5 mL HCl (12 M) was first mixed with 7.5 mL methanol in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave under stirring to form a homogeneous solution. Then 0.15 mL of titanium(IV) butoxide (97%, Aldrich) was added under stirring for another 5 minutes. Afterwards, FTO glass was placed at 15 degrees against the Teflon liner wall with the conducting side facing down. Afterwards, the autoclave was sealed and transferred to an oven at 160 °C for 2 h. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, the obtained TiO2 NCs were washed with deionized water and ethanol repeatedly and subsequently dried in nitrogen flow. The NCs were subsequently annealed at 450 °C in air for 30 minutes. NRs on FTO were synthesized by replacing methanol with ethanol or isopropanol.
CH3NH3PbI3 synthesis
CH3NH3I was synthesized according to the reported method.8 10 mL methylamine (40% in methanol) reacted with 10.8 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water) in a 250 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. Then the solution was kept at 50 °C and rotary evaporated to remove the solvent. The precipitate was washed by ample diethyl ether and finally recrystallized from ethanol solution by diethyl ether. After filtration, the solid product was collected and dried at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum condition.
To prepare the desired concentrated CH3NH3PbI3 solution (20 mM, 1.25 M, and 2 M), a certain equimolar CH3NH3I and PbI2 were dissolved in 2 mL γ-butyrolactone and kept at 60 °C overnight under stirring. Then the CH3NH3PbI3 solution was obtained.
Seeding spin-coating of CH3NH3PbI3
20 mM CH3NH3PbI3 solution was first spin-coated onto the NCs as CH3NH3PbI3 seeds with a rotation rate of 2000 rpm for 1 minute. Afterwards, it was annealed at 100 °C for 20 minutes to evaporate solvent. 2 M CH3NH3PbI3 was then spin-coated to grow the compact CH3NH3PbI3 layer followed by heating at 100 °C for 20 minutes. All procedures were conducted in nitrogen atmosphere. It can be seen that the color changed into dark brown during the drying process (Fig. S9†), indicating the formation of solid CH3NH3PbI3.
Sequential deposition process of CH3NH3PbI3 was referred to the reported method.4 Firstly, a PbI2 solution in DMF (462 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the nanocone film, and was kept at 70 °C overnight. After drying, the films were dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) for 20 s and rinsed with 2-propanol. The whole synthesis was conducted in N2 atmosphere.
Device fabrication and measurement
30 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution (68 mM in chlorobenzene), containing 55 mM tert-butylpyridine and 9 mM lithium bis(trifluoromethylsyfonyl) imide salt, was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3/NCs film at 2000 rpm for 1 minute.3 By using a metal mask with aperture area of 9 mm2, gold electrode was casted onto the above film by thermal evaporation. For the scaled-up device, the aperture area is 1.2 cm2.
Devices were characterized by a solar simulator (Oriel 91192, Newport, USA) calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell (PEC-SI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan) under illumination of AM 1.5 simulated sunlight at a power density of 100 mW cm−2. Jsc–Voc characteristics were recorded by sweeping starting from open circuit to short circuit at a sweeping rate of 20 mV s−1.
Material characterizations
The synthesized nanostructures were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800), X-ray diffractometry (XRD, X'Pert Pro MPD) using Cu Kα radiation (1.5405 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010HR) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
Result and discussion
The growth of the NCs and characterization
TiO2 NCs on FTO were synthesized by immersing FTO glass in a mixture of 15 mL 6 M aqueous hydrochloride diluted by methanol and a certain amount of titanium(IV) butoxide (TBO) in a sealed 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 165 °C for 2 hours. The details are described in Experimental section.
The evolution of the NCs was tracked by changing the amount of TBO from 0.1 mL to 0.3 mL while keeping other conditions constant. Following the procedures which were described in Experimental section, the obtained nanostructures were presented in Fig. 1 and S1.† When TBO amount was 0.1 mL, the unique short cone-shaped arrays grew sparsely on the substrate (Fig. S1a†). The NCs were only 130 nm long. Part of the substrate was still uncovered by the NCs (circled in Fig. S1a†). This would probably cause a short-circuit when incorporating them into photovoltaics. As TBO amount was increased to 0.15 mL, as shown in Fig. 1a where a nanocone profile is depicted, the conical morphology was retained while the NCs grew to ∼467 nm long (Fig. 1a). The bottom width of the nanocone was not more than 150 nm. In this case, the substrate surface coverage was much improved with the coverage density of 1.1 × 1010 nanocones per cm2. With close inspection, just as the inset cartoon of Fig. 1a shown, it seemed that only the bottom part of the NC arrays was fused together (area between the parallel dashed lines in Fig. 1a) while the top part of the NCs remained unfused. When TBO amount was further increased to 0.2 mL, well-aligned individual nanocones could not be obtained although the conical shape could still be discerned (Fig. S1b†). Instead, the nanocones were entirely fused with lengths of ∼700 nm in this case. Fig. S1c and d† presented the SEM images of the ∼1 μm thick film synthesized with 0.3 mL TBO, where individual structures could not be discerned from both cross-sectional and top-view SEM images because of complete fusion. Without placing FTO substrate into the reactor, over 5 μm-sized TiO2 spheres were obtained following the same synthesis process (Fig. S2†). Thus, the nanocone morphology is dependent on the FTO substrate. We speculate that the TiO2 nanocone formation is caused by the low concentration of TBO and its anisotropic growth fashion. As the TBO hydrolysis progresses, the TBO concentration becomes so low that TiO2 nanostructures preferentially grow starting at the axis to form nanocones. Impressively, the NC morphology is methanol-dependent. After replacing methanol with ethanol or isopropanol during the synthesis process, short TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRs) of tetragonal morphology (460 nm long and 120 nm wide in Fig. 1b) were obtained (Fig. 1b and S3†). The coverage density is 1.9 × 1010 nanorods per cm2 when using ethanol as solvent.

Here, it is necessary to mention that small changes of autoclave volume, reaction temperature and titanium precursor concentration would greatly change the TiO2 morphologies. In a our recent publication, by adding 0.5 mL TBO into 30 mL 6 mol L−1 aqueous hydrochloride diluted by methanol in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and reacted at 150 °C, ultra-small TiO2 nanowire arrays on FTO were obtained. Completely fused films were synthesized when using ethanol or isopropanol as synthesis solvent.18 The morphology changes in this study could be aroused by TBO amount alterations (from more than 0.5 mL to less than 0.2 mL) and the inner pressure changes in the reactor because of the temperature differences (increased from 150 °C to 165 °C) and reactor volume changes (changed from 50 mL to 25 mL).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed to characterize the nanostructures. An individual TiO2 NC was shown in the bottom left image in Fig. 1c. The diameter at the pyramid bottom was ∼150 nm, which is consistent with that observed in Fig. 1a. Top TEM image in Fig. 1c presents the NC arrays which were scraped off the substrate after they were synthesized using 0.15 mL TBO. The well-aligned NC arrays after being removed from the substrate, rather than being randomly distributed, indicate that the NCs are connected to each other by the fused under-layer. This phenomenon also implies that the whole substrate surface is covered by the continuous TiO2 NCs, avoiding electron recombination at the FTO/sensitizer interface in photovoltaics. The adherence of TiO2 NCs could be originated from the unique conical morphology because the relatively wider bottom would facilitate the fusing between each NC and promote the formation of the continuous under-layer at the bottom. The HRTEM image shows the NCs exhibit good crystallinity with the lattice spacing of d110 = 2.9 Å, d001 = 3.3 Å (bottom insets in Fig. 1c). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern agrees well with the tetragonal rutile TiO2. The rutile phase growth is mainly due to the good lattice match between rutile FTO interface (a = b = 0.4687 nm) and rutile TiO2 (a = b = 0.4594 nm).30 After extracting the peaks of FTO substrate, XRD patterns of both NCs and NRs (Fig. 1d) also index well to the standard rutile pattern (JCPDS 86-0147). The absence of (110) peak and (111) peak implies the anisotropic growth for both nanostructures. The extremely intense (002) peak at 62.8° compared to being small in the standard pattern indicates the anisotropic growth fashion of these nanostructures favoring in [001] direction, which can be explained by chloride ions being preferentially adsorbed onto the (110) crystal plane, inhibiting the growth of (110) crystal plane of TiO2 nanocrystal.17,32,33
CH3NH3PbI3 seeding spin-coating
Because of the well-known fast electron transport of 1-D nanomaterials, the NCs and NRs were used to replace TiO2 nanoparticles in mesoporous PSCs. It is expected that the 1-D nanomaterials would promote the electron transport to keep up with the rapid electron injection from perovskite to the TiO2 scaffold.
CH3NH3PbI3 was synthesized according to the reported method.8 The quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is a critical factor for the performance of the photovoltaic devices. By using the reported one-step spin-coating method with a CH3NH3PbI3 concentration of 1.25 M,8 after crystallization by heating at 100 °C for 20 minutes, only about half the surface of the NCs was infiltrated and covered by CH3NH3PbI3 islands (Fig. 3a). To our best knowledge, the exposed scaffold would reduce the light absorption and cause extra carrier recombination, which would deteriorate the device performance.
To improve the infiltration and coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 onto the TiO2 NCs, a seeding spin-coating method was developed in this report with the schematic illustration shown in Fig. 2. 20 mM CH3NH3PbI3 in γ-butyrolactone was first introduced onto the NCs as CH3NH3PbI3 seeds by spin-coating method and heated to crystallize. After pre-seeding by 20 mM CH3NH3PbI3, as is shown in Fig. 3b, compared to the unseeded NCs in Fig. 1b, the surface of the NCs became so rough that it was difficult to see the conical shape clearly, which indicates the CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals managed to anchor onto the NCs. After that, the seeded NCs were spin-coated using an oversaturated 2 M CH3NH3PbI3 solution which was more concentrated than 1.25 M used in one-step spin-coating method. The SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3 coated seeded NCs were shown in Fig. 3c and d. From the SEM images it is apparent that >40 μm long continuous CH3NH3PbI3 islands formed. With close inspection, the profile of small islands could be seen in the large CH3NH3PbI3 islands (Fig. 3c and S4†). In addition, the densely populated small CH3NH3PbI3 islands between the large islands were going to merge with each other into compact film (Fig. 3c and S4†). This phenomenon indicates that CH3NH3PbI3 film grows starting from CH3NH3PbI3 seeds into small CH3NH3PbI3 islands, and then to compact film in the spin-coating of CH3NH3PbI3 γ-butyrolactone solution process. Overall, compared with that which was obtained via one-step spin-coating method in Fig. 3a, the surface coverage of >90% was much improved by the seeding spin-coating method. Following the same procedures, CH3NH3PbI3 coated seeded NRs yielded similar surface morphology as the CH3NH3PbI3 coated seeded NCs (Fig. 3e).

The concentration of CH3NH3PbI3 is confirmed as a crucial factor during the seeding spin-coating process. When using 1.25 M CH3NH3PbI3 for the second-step infiltration, almost the same CH3NH3PbI3 layer was observed (Fig. S5†) as the CH3NH3PbI3 coated unseeded NCs in Fig. 3b, where 4 μm-sized islands formed with only ∼50% surface coverage. This is probably because the pre-synthesized CH3NH3PbI3 seeds were redissolved into the unsaturated 1.25 M CH3NH3PbI3 solution. However, when spin-coating oversaturated CH3NH3PbI3 solution with concentration of 2 M, CH3NH3PbI3 islands grew bigger at the interface of CH3NH3PbI3 seeds/the oversaturated CH3NH3PbI3 solution to form a CH3NH3PbI3 layer, and redissolution does not happen.
The XRD pattern of CH3NH3PbI3 infiltrated NCs and NRs after crystallization were recorded in Fig. 3f. Apart from the features of FTO and rutile TiO2, the diffraction peaks at 19.94, 23.44, 24.48, 28.32, 31.87, 40.44 and 43.12 are assigned to the (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (224), and (314) planes of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3, respectively (Fig. 3f).2,4,34
Hole transporting materials (HTMs) such as spiro-OMeTAD,7,35,36 spiro-OMeTAD derivative,37 poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT),36 poly(triarylmine),26,38 and other inorganic HTMs,39–42 play a significant role in elevating the performance of PSCs. Among these HTMs, spiro-OMeTAD is thought as the most efficient HTM and the corresponding PSCs exhibited an astonishing PCE of 19.3% so far.7 Therefore, in this study, spiro-OMeTAD was chosen as the HTM, and gold was evaporated as the electrode. The schematic illustration of the seeded NCs-based device (SNC-Device) is portrayed in Fig. 4a. From the cross-sectional SEM images of SNC-Device (Fig. 4b) and seeded NRs-based device (SNR-Device) (Fig. 4c), it could be seen that the interstices between NCs and NRs were completely filled with CH3NH3PbI3, on top of which there was a continuous layer of spiro-OMeTAD. The topmost layer showed that a gold layer was successfully evaporated to coat onto the surface. Since over 90% of the surface was covered by compact CH3NH3PbI3 after spin-coating (Fig. 3c–e), the devices can be recognized as a combination of a 1-D nanomaterial based device and a planar device on top (Fig. S6a and b†), which is thought to boost performance of the PSCs.6,16 In addition, the infiltration of CH3NH3PbI3 obtained by seeding spin-coating method in this report is much better than the film obtained by sequential deposition method where little CH3NH3PbI3 was penetrated while many CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles formed on the TiO2 nanostructure surface with the device PCE of 4.97% (Fig. S7†) (see ESI† for sequential deposition process details).

Device performance
After the fabrication, J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were performed to evaluate the resultant devices. Fig. 5a shows the representative J–V characteristics of the devices under illumination of AM 1.5 simulated sunlight with the power density of 100 mW cm−2. The parameters were summarized in Table 1. The devices, including SNC-Device and SNR-Device which were fabricated via CH3NH3PbI3 seeding spin-coating method, delivered better photovoltaic performance than those obtained by devices fabricated using unseeded one-step CH3NH3PbI3 spin-coating method (NC-Device and NR-Device). The Voc of 862.98 mV, FF of 52.20% for NC-Device increased to Voc of 937.52 mV, FF of 66.75% for SNC-Device. Most notably, the Jsc almost doubled from 9.68 mA cm−2 for NC-Device to 18.23 mA cm−2 for SNC-Device. Jsc of NRs-based devices increased as well when adopting the seeding spin-coating method. The much elevated Jsc is a direct positive result of the improved CH3NH3PbI3 loading, which is confirmed by the increased surface coverage from ∼50% to >90% (Fig. 3a and c). Meanwhile, the increased surface coverage and perovskite filling reduce the exposed TiO2 nanostructures. Direct contact between the photoanode and the HTM is avoided, thus reducing the electron recombination in the resultant device. This explains why larger FF and Voc for SNC-Device and SNR-Device were obtained when using the seeding spin-coating method. Consequently, compared to the PCE of 4.36% for NC-Device and 3.60% for NR-Device, the PCEs of SNC-Device and SNR-Device climbed to 11.41% and 8.36%, respectively.

Here, it is necessary to note that both NC-Device (PCE = 4.36%) and NR-Device (PCE = 3.60%) performed inferior to the reported TiO2 NR-based device (PCE = 9.4%).43 This is because, unlike the 560 nm long, ∼80 nm wide individual TiO2 NRs grown on dense TiO2 layer coated FTO for the best PSCs in the literature,43 the TiO2 NCs and NRs in this report are only ∼460 nm long, and these nanostructures are grown on bare FTO glass. In addition, if taking off the ∼100 nm-thick bottom fused part (Fig. 1a and b) which acts as hole blocking layer, the actual length of these nanostructures that could be filled with CH3NH3PbI3 is barely ∼360 nm thick. Moreover, both widths of the TiO2 NCs (∼150 nm) and TiO2 NRs (∼120 nm) are larger than that in the literature (∼80 nm).43 All these factors would diminish the space for CH3NH3PbI3 loading in this study, thus leading to inferior Jsc and PCE than those obtained in the literature.
Furthermore, as list in Table 1, NCs-based devices (SNC-Device and NC-Device) have better photovoltaic performance than NRs-based devices (SNR-Device and NR-Device), especially for the one fabricated through CH3NH3PbI3 seeding spin-coating method. In order to rule out the accidental error, a rounding-off method was employed to summarize the PCEs among fifty devices for both devices. The statistic bar charts are depicted in Fig. 4b and c. Although the PCEs ranged from 9% to 12% for SNC-Devices while the PCEs of SNR-Devices varied from 7% to 10%, the maximum distribution of PCE centered at ∼11% for SNC-Devices, and ∼8.5% for SNR-Devices. The PCE of the SNC-Device also outperforms the reported TiO2 nanorods-based CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell with its PCE of 9.4%, even though the TiO2 nanostructures here are shorter than that in the literature.41 EQEs as a function of wavelength were collected in Fig. 5d as well. Both devices showed promising EQE over the whole visible light region and over 65% from 400 nm to 600 nm. The high EQE indicates that the incident photons are efficiently converted into isolated carriers, and the as-fabricated devices are structurally well-designed. Compared to the SNR-Device, the superior EQE of the SNC-Device coincides with the relatively higher Jsc of SNC-Device, which indicates the nanocone arrays are a more promising scaffold than the regular tetragonal nanorods for perovskite solar cells.
Devices show inferior performance when sweeping from short circuit to open circuit compared with that obtained by reverse sweeping during device performance test, namely anomalous hysteresis, is found in nanoparticle-based PSCs.44,45 Here, the J–V behavior of SNC-Device swept starting from short circuit to open circuit was also recorded and shown in Fig. 5a. Apparently, hysteresis occurred in the SNC-Device at the sweeping rate of 20 mV s−1 as well with the corresponding data (reversed-SNC-Device) presented in Table 1. Optimistically, only slight decreases of Voc (decreased from 937.52 to 924 mV) and FF (decreased from 66.75% to 60.94%) were observed, resulting in a relative shabby PCE of 10.22%. The indistinctive hysteresis for SNC-Device implies that such PSCs are of excellent structural design and fabrication.
More recently, 1400 nm-long TiO2 NCs were synthesized following another different hydrothermal process, and the obtained PSCs yielded a comparable PCE of 11.9%.26 However, the TiO2 synthesis process in this report is more energy saving because of the lower reaction temperature (165 °C versus 200 °C) and shorter duration (2 h versus 20 h). In addition, the most appropriate length of TiO2 NRs in PSCs was reported to be ∼500 nm by exhibiting the highest PCE and showing superior IPCE over the short wavelength region.43 Consequently, the facilely synthesized ∼460 nm-long TiO2 NCs afford a more synergistic scaffold fitting for inorganic–organic perovskites.
Advantages of NC-Device
Carrier transport behavior is an important issue that would affect the photovoltaic performance. To further obtain the advantages of using 1-D TiO2 (including NCs and NRs) for perovskite solar cell application, the electron recombination kinetics was monitored by recording the transient Voc as a function of time after promptly shutting off the illumination, and was further compared with that of the conventional nanoparticle-based CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells (denoted as SNP-Device). It is noted that the SNP-Device was fabricated via the same seeding spin-coating process with the cross-sectional SEM image and a typical comparable J–V curve (Voc = 975.10 mV, Jsc = 19.05 mA cm−2, FF = 59.73%, PCE = 11.09%) shown in Fig. S8a and b,† respectively (see ESI† for the nanoparticle photoanode fabrication details). As is shown in Fig. 6a, after turning off the illumination under open circuit condition, the Voc decayed sharply for all three different devices due to the electron recombination. With careful comparison by zooming in on the squared area as an inset in Fig. 6a, it is observed that the voltage of SNP-Device decayed much faster, while SNC-Device and SNR-Device exhibited comparable slower decay rates given the initial voltage difference for these two devices. As is well known, the decay rate reflects the electron lifetime and recombination rate.46 By fitting the decay curves using the equations presented in ESI,† the obtained fitted solid curves were shown in Fig. 6a. After that, the photogenerated electron lifetime (τn) could be calculated via the following equation:47  where kB is the Boltzmann constant of 1.38 × 10−23 J K−1, T is the temperature and is 298 K in this study, and e is the elementary charge of 1.60 × 10−19 C. The calculated τn of three kinds of devices are plotted in Fig. 6b as a function of voltage. Apparently, both the SNC-Device and SNR-Device show longer electron lifetime than that of SNP-Device at equal voltage. It is necessary to mention that, although the accuracy of these values here is actually limited by the responsivity of the instrument analyzer, it is qualitatively convincing that both the 1-D nanomaterial devices bear longer electron lifetime and slower recombination rate than the SNP-Device.

(d) Bode phase angle versus frequency plots of the SNC-Device and SNP-Device. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also adopted to evaluate the charge transport difference between the SNC-Device and SNP-Device. Fig. 6c presents the EIS spectra of the two devices, which were tested at 800 mV forward bias under dark condition. It was found that one main arc appeared in the region from 10 to 105 Hz, although with closer look, another small arc could be observed in both plots in the high frequency region (inset in Fig. 6c). Generally, the size of the main arc in the moderate frequency to low frequency is associated with charge transfer and represents the recombination resistance.48–50 Keeping this point in mind, it is easy to perceive that the arc size of SNC-Device is one third bigger than that of SNP-Device, indicating larger recombination resistance existing in the 1-D-based devices. The increased recombination resistance in SNC-Device leads to reduced recombination rate and longer electron lifetime, which is in good accordance with the results obtained via Voc decay experiment. In addition, compared with SNP-Device, the bode plot of SNC-Device showed left-shift toward low frequency (Fig. 6d), which also indicates the relative longer electron lifetime for the 1-D nanomaterial-based device.51 Conclusively, compared to the SNP-Device, the superior electron lifetime and reduced recombination in SNC-Device and SNR-Device learned from the Voc decay and EIS experiments should be due to the faster electron transport, suppressed electron scattering, and the reduced recombination due to the direct transport pathway along the 1-D TiO2.18–21
Furthermore, to better understand the advantages of the NCs over NRs in perovskite solar cell application, the schematic illustrations of cross-sections of both devices are depicted in Fig. S6.† It has already been reported that there is an extra force driving electrons to inject from perovskite into TiO2 NCs at the interface of perovskite/TiO2 NCs but not for TiO2 NRs,26 which is beneficial for rapid electron transfer and reduction of recombination. Apart from that, the ambipolar charge transport property of CH3NH3PbI3 makes the exciton separation and carrier transport no longer a challenge.8,11 It also simplifies the solar cells by not requiring the scaffold possessing large surface area for sensitizer loading. To some degree, it is sensible that the larger void space between the TiO2 nanostructures would allow more perovskite nanocrystals to fill in, which helps to improve PCE consequently.
Judging from this viewpoint, as shown in Fig. S6c,† a NC merely takes up one third volume as that of a NR on the assumption that both the NC and NR have the same base surface area (a2) and height (h) (a2h/3 versus a2h). Furthermore, the coverage density of the nanocones is almost half that of the TiO2 nanorods (1.1 × 1010 nanocones per cm2versus 1.9 × 1010 nanorods per cm2) in this study. Both abovementioned factors spared more space (red brown area in Fig. S6a†) for perovskite to fill in, thus harvest more light. Moreover, the gradually shrunken NCs are more likely to help the formation of the bottom fusion (the area between the parallel dashed line in Fig. 2b and S6a†), which is helpful to cut off the direct contact of CH3NH3PbI3 with the bare FTO, reducing the recombination caused by back-injection of the photogenerated holes into the substrate.17 But for short NRs, just as the schematic illustration (Fig. S6b†) shows, there is a structural drawback that the substrate could not be fully covered by the NRs (circled in Fig. 2d) which would result in short-circuit in photovoltaic application. Therefore, it is reasonable that the devices using NC arrays as photoanode produces higher Jsc, EQE, and PCE.
Structurally, such nanocones-based device is a combination of planar device and 1-D nanomaterials based device, which is confirmed by the continuous top CH3NH3PbI3 layer. Photo-generated electrons will be transported more efficiently via the TiO2 nanocones while the holes are transported through the perovskite (Fig. S6a and b†). Meanwhile, compared with the planar device, in a principle of composite materials, the protruding nanocones increase the roughness of the perovskite/TiO2 interface, which would enhance the adhesion between the CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 scaffold. The enhanced adhesion is expected to facilitate the charge transport and increase the physical stability of photovoltaic device. Therefore, the SNC-Device takes full advantages of the ambipolar charge transport property of CH3NH3PbI3 and fast charge transport property of 1-D nanostructures.
Scaling up of the NC-Device
Scaling up the solar cells and putting them into real life application is one goal of scientific research. Although the small photovoltaic devices (<20 mm2) have been developed rapidly in recent years, few publications have reported the scaling up process. After Burschka et al. reported a 28.5 mm2 cell which yielded a PCE of over 15% by using porous TiO2 nanoparticles,4 Malinkiewicz et al. pioneered another planar 98 mm2-sized PSC using organic charge-transport layers, which realized a PCE of 8.27%.52 In this study, we attempted to scale up the NCs based device from 9 mm2 to 1.2 cm2 employing the same process as the 9 mm2-sized solar cell. Fifty 1.2 cm2-sized SNC-Devices were tested under illumination of AM 1.5 with power density of 100 mW cm−2. From the PCE distribution bar chart of fifty devices, one could see that most PCEs of these big devices centered at ∼6% (Fig. 7b). For a representative big device with its J–V characteristics shown in Fig. 7a, compared to the parameters of 9 mm2-sized SNC-Device, those parameters generated by the big device decreased with Jsc of 14.07 mA cm−2, Voc of 802.13 mV, a much smaller FF of 53.54%, and the resultant almost halved PCE of 6.04%. The decreased performance could be caused by the scaling up effect, such that the NCs might be not as uniform as a certain small area, or CH3NH3PbI3 and spiro-OMeTAD might be not evenly penetrated by spin-coating over the large surface (usually, the amount increases from the center to the rim due to centrifugal force). Although the PCE is only 6.04%, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time for the scaling up of the 1-D nanomaterial based perovskite solar cells with the size over 1 cm2.

Conclusion
In conclusion, vertically-aligned TiO2 nanocones on FTO glass were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The unique nanocone-shaped morphology was dependent on synthesis solvent. When fabricating these nanocones into perovskite solar cells, a 20 mM CH3NH3PbI3 solution was first spin-coated onto the nanocones as seeds before the infiltration of a 2 M CH3NH3PbI3 solution. The seeding spin-coating method was confirmed to effectively improve the surface coverage to more than 90%. The resultant devices showed an improved average PCE of ∼11%. By comparing with the nanorods-based devices, the nanocones-based devices showed better photovoltaic performance. We ascribed this performance to the higher loading of CH3NH3PbI3 due to the gradually shrunken conical nanostructures, which would spare more space for the filling of perovskite. Meanwhile, excitons were supposed to be more efficiently separated because of the faster electron transport by the 1-D NCs. By structural analysis, the TiO2 nanocones are believed to act more synergistically with CH3NH3PbI3 than rectangular nanorods. Furthermore, a scaling up process was attempted. By scaling up the active area to 1.2 cm2, the devices yielded a PCE over 6%. To date, this is the first report regarding scaling up 1-D nanomaterial-based perovskite sensitized solar cells.
