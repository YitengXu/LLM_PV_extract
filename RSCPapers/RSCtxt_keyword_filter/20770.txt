    , Accepted 28th October 2016First published on 28th October 2016AbstractThe conformational change of the polymer backbone has an obvious influence on the blended film morphology and the photovoltaic properties. A planar polymer backbone can provide strong intermolecular interaction, but excessive self-aggregation usually disadvantages a favorable film morphology. Here, a dithienothiophene (DTT) unit and a terthiophene (T3) unit were introduced to construct a pair of new conjugated polymers, PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT, respectively, to investigate the correlation between the conformation of the polymer backbone and the photovoltaic properties. The highly planar structure of the DTT unit made PDTT-DTBT exhibit a stronger molecular aggregation than PT3-DTBT. Compared to the DTT unit, the T3 unit changed the molecular structure from fused thiophenes to linked ones, which relaxed the rigidity of the polymer backbone and reduced the degree of polymer self-aggregation, and a more suitable blended film morphology was formed. Due to the weaker electron-donating ability of the DTT unit, PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM-based devices showed a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.75 V, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.01% was obtained with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 14.85 mA cm−2 and a filled factor (FF) of 71.62%. This PCE value was slightly higher than for PT3-DTBT/PC71BM-based devices, which exhibited a PCE of 7.68% (along with a Voc of 0.66 V, a Jsc of 16.62 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.69%).
Introduction
With the successful application of a donor–acceptor (D–A) strategy in material design, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have made great progress to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 11% currently.1,2 In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance, an optimized design of the material structure3 (with broad absorption, suitable energy level, high hole mobility, etc.) and favorable control of the film morphology4 (device structure, additives, annealing treatment, etc.) should be considered simultaneously. In particular, the molecular conformation (backbone curvature,5 backbone rigidity,6 backbone dihedral angle7) should receive special attention, because conformational changes can obviously influence the degree of π conjugation, the molecular energy levels, and the intra/intermolecular interactions, with consequent impacts on the electronic delocalization, exciton transfer, charge transportation and film morphology in PSC devices.8,9 For organic semiconductor materials, besides the polymer backbones, intermolecular hopping in the π–π stacking direction can also provide a means to transport of charge carriers.10 Polymer backbones with a planar conformation can increase the degree of π orbital overlapping and provide strong molecular aggregation and good π–π stacking between polymer chains, thereby improving the charge mobility.11,12
Up to now, much work has been involved in the modulation of polymer conformation in PSCs to improve the intermolecular interaction, such as introducing the fluorine atom with a strong nonbonding interaction,13,14 replacing the branched alkyl side-chains with linear ones,15,16 constructing polymer backbones with planar blocks,17,18etc. For example, Yan and co-workers19–22 did a great deal of excellent work on side-chain engineering and device optimization, and they found a series of polymers with strong aggregation that could exhibit high crystallization and reasonable polymer domain size in blended films, and the corresponding device displayed over 11% PCE.2 Hou et al.23 replaced 2-ethylhexyl with octyl to construct PBDTTS1 and improve the ordered intermolecular stacking, and consequently a high PCE of 9.48% was obtained with an enhanced short-circuit current (Jsc). In other cases, fused aromatic ring moieties with π-extended heteroarene structure and large overlapping areas, such as naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT),24 thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT),25 and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),26 are commonly used as the donor unit or π bridge to construct planar conjugated polymers with strong aggregation.
As is well known, the active layer of PSCs is a mixture of donor materials and acceptor materials blended by physical methods,27 which is different from that of organic field effect transistors (OFETs) with a single phase. A high photovoltaic performance requires that the blended film possess a good morphology with a low surface roughness and a cross-interpenetrating network of reasonable size.28,29 Reported work has demonstrated that the distance for effective exciton diffusion is limited to 10–20 nm.30 If polymer self-aggregation is too strong, it can coarsen the polymer nanofibrils formed in the blended film and enlarge the size of the cross-interpenetrating network, which will lead to a poor film morphology and low Jsc.31 Jo et al.32 synthesized a series of polymers containing different numbers of fluorine atoms and found that excessive fluorination caused a large aggregation of polymer chains that finally produced a low Jsc. Janssen et al.33 summarized the character of diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP)-based polymers and pointed out that the intrinsic character of DPP polymers tended to present a high degree of aggregation with obvious fibration in blended films. Therefore, the correlation between the conformation of the polymer backbone, the film morphology and the photovoltaic properties merits further study.
As a highly extended conjugated structure, the dithienothiophene (DTT) unit is well known in the synthesis of high-mobility materials for OFETs34–37 and PSCs,38–41 but poor solubility caused by the lack of side chains and excessive aggregation nature hinders its further application. Compared to the DTT unit, the terthiophene (T3) unit changes the structure from fused thiophenes to linked ones, which can relieve the rigidity of the polymer backbone, and hence a better film morphology would be expected. Here, we utilized the DTT unit and the T3 unit as donor, the 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (BT) unit as acceptor and 3-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophene as the π bridge to construct a pair of new conjugated polymers, PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT, in order to investigate the effect of the conformation of the polymer backbone on photovoltaic properties. Interestingly, the absorption spectra of these two polymers in the film state are blue-shifted compared to that in solution. PDTT-DTBT-based photovoltaic devices exhibited a lower Jsc, 14.85 mA cm−2, than the PT3-DTBT-based device (Jsc of 16.62 mA cm−2), but a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.75 V and a slightly higher PCE of 8.01% than for the PT3-DTBT (Voc of 0.66 V and PCE of 7.68%). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 8.01% is among the best devices fabricated without any additives and post-annealing treatment.42
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
A pair of conjugated polymers, PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT, were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1, in which these two polymers were polymerized from the corresponding monomers (M1 and M3, M2 and M3) by a Stille coupling polymerization reaction, using Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 as catalyst, and anhydrous toluene as solvent. Here, M1, M2 and M3 were synthesized according to previously reported methods.43–45 Owing to the long alkyl side chains that remain, both polymers exhibit good solubility and can be readily dissolved in toluene, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and hot tetrahydrofuran. Their molecular weight was estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 150 °C. PDTT-DTBT shows a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 52.96 kDa, a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 113.29 kDa and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.14, and PT3-DTBT shows a Mn of 104.04 kDa, a Mw of 214.60 kDa and a PDI of 2.06. These two polymers' thermal stability was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere and the corresponding TGA curves are shown in Fig. 1a. The onset decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT are 435 °C and 422 °C, respectively, and the high Td ensures these two polymers are thermally stable for the subsequent PSCs application.46 The crystallinities of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the corresponding XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1b. PDTT-DTBT shows an obvious diffraction peak at 2θ = 24.74°, corresponding to a π–π stacking distance of 3.59 Å between polymer backbones. But differing from PDTT-DTBT, PT3-DTBT exhibits a diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.03°, corresponding to a distance of 21.89 Å between the polymer backbones separated by side chains. The difference in the diffraction peaks between PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT suggests that the orientation of the intermolecular ordered packing is different.

Optical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT in DCB solution and in the film state are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding absorption properties are summarized in Table 1. These two polymers exhibit a similar wide absorption from the ultraviolet region to the infrared region, both in solution and in the film state. Three obvious absorption peaks located at 458 nm, 648 nm, and 712 nm for PDTT-DTBT in DCB solution at 15 °C (Fig. 2a) are observed, with these three peaks being attributable to the localized π–π* transitions of the polymer backbone, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor DTT to acceptor BT and the strong intermolecular π–π stacking.47 The peak for π–π stacking indicates that a strong aggregation exists between the polymer backbones even in the solution state, and when the temperature increases to 75 °C, the peak for the π–π stacking disappears, which indicates that a temperature of 75 °C can provide enough energy to destroy the π–π stacking interaction between polymer backbones. The film absorption properties of PDTT-DTBT are similar to those in solution, but it should be noted that the absorption of the PDTT-DTBT film is blue-shifted by about 16 nm relative to that of the solution, and a similar phenomenon can be found for PT3-DTBT (Fig. 2b), which maybe arises from the strong aggregation caused by the enhanced planarity of the polymer backbone.48 The absorption onset for the PDTT-DTBT film is located at 741 nm, and according to the equation that the optical band gap (Eoptg) = 1240/λ (eV), the Eoptg of PDTT-DTBT is calculated to be 1.67 eV. PT3-DTBT exhibits similar absorption properties to PDTT-DTBT and its Eoptg is 1.67 eV, based on the absorption onset located at 743 nm. It is noteworthy that these two polymers possess the same Eoptg value, which means that the DTT unit and T3 unit have a similar influence on photon capture and electron transition.

Electrochemical properties and molecular energy levels
To obtain the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT, cyclic voltammetries (CV) were measured and the corresponding cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 3a. The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT are located at 1.03 V and 0.96 V, respectively, and according to the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4), the corresponding HOMO values were calculated to be −5.43 eV and −5.36 eV, respectively. The higher HOMO level of PT3-DTBT compared with that of PDTT-DTBT maybe results from the stronger electron donating ability of the T3 unit than that of the DTT unit. In view of the positive proportional relationship between Voc and the HOMO energy level, a higher Voc could be expected for PDTT-DTBT in PSC devices. According to the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) values of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT were calculated to be −3.76 eV and −3.69 eV, respectively, and the corresponding energy level diagram is described in Fig. 3b. The higher LUMO level of PT3-DTBT than of PDTT-DTBT can provide a more efficient exciton dissociation.49

Theoretical calculations
The molecular backbone conformations of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT and the corresponding effect on the optoelectronic properties were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase. The dihedral angles, molecular energy levels, band gaps and corresponding electron distributions were calculated and are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4. To avoid excessive computation demand, in the calculations the alkyl chains attached to the backbones were replaced by methyl groups. θ1 is the dihedral angle between donor units (DTT unit and T3 unit), and θ2 is the inner dihedral angle of the terthiophene unit, drawn in red. PDTT-DTBT has a dihedral angle of 24.49°, indicating obvious twisting between DTT units and thiophene bridges. But PT3-DTBT exhibits a dihedral angle of 0.04° and an inner dihedral angle of 0.02°, which means that the relatively flexible T3 unit with linked thiophene structure may have a lower degree of torsion between adjacent aromatic rings. It should be noted that the theoretical calculation could not replace the experimental value. The calculated HOMO levels for PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT are −5.07 eV and −4.86 eV, respectively, which agrees well with the values obtained from CV. Otherwise, the two polymers show similar distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals, where the HOMO is delocalized over the whole backbone, whereas the LUMO is mainly located in the BT units and thiophene bridges.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT, PSCs devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated and characterized under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Without any additives and post-annealing treatment, only different weight ratios of polymer:PC71BM (1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2) were adjusted and the corresponding current density versus voltage (J–V) curves and photovoltaic parameters of the devices are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. When the blend ratio was 1:1, the PDTT-DTBT device (Fig. 5a) showed a PCE of 7.28%, slightly lower than that of the PT3-DTBT device (Fig. 5b) with a PCE of 7.51%. Meanwhile, the Voc of the PDTT-DTBT device is higher than that of the PT3-DTBT device, which is well in agreement with the difference of HOMO values between PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT obtained from CV and theoretical calculations. Along with the weight ratio of polymer:PC71BM varying from 1:1 to 1:2, the Jsc values of these two polymer devices decreased gradually, but the FF values increased simultaneously. Eventually, both polymers achieved optimal photovoltaic performance at a weight ratio of 1:1.5, at which the PDTT-DTBT-based device exhibited an optimal PCE of 8.01% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc f 14.85 mA cm−2 and a filled factor (FF) of 71.62%, whereas the PT3-DTBT-based device showed an optimal PCE of 7.68% with a Voc of 0.66 V, a Jsc of 16.62 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.69% under the same conditions. Although a relatively lower Jsc existed, the weaker electron-donating ability of the DTT unit led to a Voc of 0.09 V higher for PDTT-DTBT than for PT3-DTBT. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 8.01% is the highest one for DTT-based conjugated polymers38–41 and is also one of the highest efficiency for PSCs fabricated without any additives and post-annealing treatment.42

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of these polymer based devices were measured under the optimal device fabrication conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, both PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT devices exhibited a similar broad photo-to-current response from 300 nm to 750 nm that covered the whole visible region. The PT3-DTBT-based device showed a higher maximum value (79.33%) than that of PDTT-DTBT (68.32%), indicating that PT3-DTBT has a better photo response than PDTT-DTBT and further explaining the higher Jsc of the PT3-DTBT device (16.62 mA cm−2) relative to the PDTT-DTBT device (14.85 mA cm−2).
 Fig. 6  EQE curves of devices based on PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM and PT3-DTBT/PC71BM blends (1:1.5, w/w). 
The hole mobility and electron mobility for each donor:acceptor ratio were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au and ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al respectively, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM blends with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 showed a hole mobility of 8.69 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was smaller than that of PT3-DTBT/PC71BM blends with the same ratio (9.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). When the weight ratio changed from 1:1 to 1:1.5, a reduced difference between hole mobility and electron mobility could be observed for these two polymers, which meant an improved balance between hole mobility and electron mobility and consequently an improvement in FF. When the weight ratio further changed to 1:2, the difference between hole mobility and electron mobility changed slightly and this led to a non-obvious change in FF. The lower hole mobility of PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM blends maybe results from the strong self-aggregation of PDTT-DTBT chains with a poor film morphology (discussed in the next section). Moreover, the higher hole mobility of PT3-DTBT/PC71BM blends is a potential reason for the fact that the Jsc of PT3-DTBT/PC71BM-based devices is higher than that of the PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM-based devices.
Morphology characterization
The morphological properties of the blend films consisting of polymers and PC71BM were investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the images are shown in Fig. 7. The root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness is 2.17 nm and 1.83 nm for the PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM and PT3-DTBT/PC71BM blends, respectively, indicating the smooth surface of the two active layers. As shown in Fig. 7b and c, PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM blends exhibit obvious melanic PC71BM aggregation and wide polymer fibril aggregation with a size of about 40 nm, providing a bicontinuous interpenetrating network of a large size. But for PT3-DTBT/PC71BM blends, the size of the polymer fibrils is diminished to about 20 nm and the bicontinuous interpenetrating network becomes more delicate and compact than that of the PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM blends. Because the exciton diffusion length is typically limited to 10–20 nm,28PT3-DTBT/PC71BM blends could provide more efficient exciton diffusion to the interface between polymer and PC71BM.

Compared to the T3 unit, the DTT unit has a planar rigid structure, which is conducive to the stronger self-aggregation of PDTT-DTBT backbones (π–π stacking, Fig. 1b) and thus resulted in the relatively wide polymer fibrils. The T3 unit connecting three linked thiophene rings can make the polymer backbone more flexible and soft, and reduce molecular self-aggregation; this contributes to the formation of a polymer fibril of smaller size and better film morphology. Thus PT3-DTBT/PC71BM-based devices exhibited a higher Jsc (16.62 mA cm−2) than PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM-based devices (14.85 mA cm−2).
Conclusions
A pair of new conjugated polymers, PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT, was designed and synthesized to investigate the effect of the conformation of the polymer backbone on photovoltaic properties. Due to the presence of the DTT unit with a highly planar structure, PDTT-DTBT exhibited a stronger aggregation between polymer chains, which led to too strong a self-aggregation in blend films. But for PT3-DTT, the T3 unit with three linked thiophenes relaxed the rigidity of the polymer backbone and reduced the degree of polymer self-aggregation and, as a consequence, a more suitable blended film morphology was formed, with a higher Jsc of 16.62 mA cm−2 than that for PDTT-DTBT/PC71BM (14.85 mA cm−2). However, the weaker electron-donating ability of the DTT unit provided a deeper HOMO level for PDTT-DTBT and thus a Voc 0.09 V higher than that of PT3-DTBT was achieved. Finally, a PCE of 8.01% was obtained for PDTT-DTBT, which was slightly higher than that for PT3-DTBT (7.68%). The work highlights that the correlation between the conformation of the polymer backbone, the film morphology and the photovoltaic properties should typically be considered in the design of high-performance photovoltaic materials.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Energy Chemical, J&K Scientific and other commercial sources. The reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification, except for toluene, which was dried over Na/benzophenoneketyl and freshly distilled prior to use. M1, M2, and M3 were synthesized according to the previously reported literature.43–45
Synthesis of PDTT-DTBT and PT3-DTBT

M1 (104.4 mg, 0.2 mmol), M3 (233.5 mg, 0.2 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (1.8 mg, 0.002 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (3.6 mg, 0.012 mmol) were dissolved in dry toluene (5 mL). After purging with argon for 30 min, the mixture was heated to 110 °C and stirred for 24 h under argon. Then, after cooling down to room temperature, the solution was precipitated into MeOH and filtered. The crude product was then purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform for 12 h, respectively. Finally, the product PDTT-DTBT was purified by silica gel column chromatography, and dried under vacuum. 122 mg, yield: 51%. Mn = 52.96 kDa, PDI = 2.14.
The synthesis of PT3-DTBT was the same as that for PDTT-DTBT, 208 mg, yield: 83%. Mn = 104.04 kDa, PDI = 2.06.
Characterization
The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by GPC under 150 °C, using TCB as the solvent and polystyrene as the standard. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed by SDT Q600 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The XRD spectrum was obtained on a Hitachi S-4800. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded by a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation under an argon atmosphere with a three-electrode cell (a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and an SCE reference electrode) in 0.1 M solution of Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at ambient temperature. DFT calculations were carried out by the Gaussian 09 program suite at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in the gas phase. Morphological characterizations of the polymer/PC71BM blend films were characterized using a tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5400) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, HITACHIH-7650).
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs devices
The solar cell devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al on 15 mm × 15 mm patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. The ITO glass was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, methanol and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. After oxygen plasma treatment for 20 min, the substrate was spin-coated with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (30 nm) and then dried under argon at 120 °C for 20 min. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of polymer and PC71BM (10 mg mL−1) with different weight ratios (1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2) in DCB solution onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Then, the Ca/Al cathode was deposited onto the active layer by vacuum evaporation under 3 × 10−4 Pa. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under simulated 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. Light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The thickness of the active layers was determined using a Dektak 150 profilometer, about 100 nm. The EQE of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.
