    , Accepted 11th April 2018First published on 17th April 2018AbstractTo date, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved superior photovoltaic performance with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 22%. However, there are very few devices which have a high PCE and high stability simultaneously. In this study, we fabricated PSCs made from (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 using the non-volatile Lewis base acetamide (CH3CONH2) as an additive. Compared to a reference device, the device containing 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 displayed a markedly improved PCE of 19.01% and less hysteresis, due to its high-quality film with a better crystal structure, evidently larger grain size and greater thickness. In addition, the device with CH3CONH2 exhibited better humidity and heat stability. The unsealed device could maintain about 70% and 50% of its starting PCE under around 50% and 80% relative humidity (RH) for 1000 h and 700 h, respectively. Meanwhile, the unsealed device with CH3CONH2 could retain about 80% and 60% of its starting PCE at 60 °C and 85 °C for 200 h and 150 h, respectively. These results clearly show that using CH3CONH2 as an additive can promote crystal growth and enhance the grain size of perovskite thin films and introducing a suitable additive can realize the simultaneous improvement of the PCE and stability of PSCs.
Introduction
Recently, perovskite materials based on the general form ABX3 (A = CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+ or Cs+, B = Pb2+ and X = Cl−, Br− or I−) have displayed outstanding optoelectronic properties (desirable band gaps, high absorption coefficients, long exciton and charge diffusion lengths and low exciton binding energy), which have made them attractive for fabricating low-cost photovoltaic devices.1–6 To date, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 22%, making them promising for the next generation of photovoltaic technology.7
Unfortunately, perovskite materials have been reported to suffer from instability upon exposure to moisture and heat, which has hindered the realistic popularization of PSCs.8–11 There have been numerous attempts to improve the stability of PSCs against moisture and heat, such as using dopant-free or inorganic hole-transporting materials (HTM),12–14 introducing an interfacial layer,15,16 replacing the electron transport layer (ETL),17,18 incorporating Rb and Cs cations19,20 and adding additives into the absorber layer.21,22 Among these improved efforts, the simplest and most effective method is adding a suitable additive into the perovskite layer.
In the last few years, more and more additives have been used to improve the PCE and stability of PSCs by enhancing the morphology and crystallinity.23–30 For example, Lee et al. reported that the use of a bifunctional non-volatile Lewis base additive, urea, could retard crystal growth and enhance crystallinity, resulting in an improved PCE.31 Fu et al. introduced 3-hydroxypyridine molecules to coat the perovskite layer and greatly improved the long-term stability of solar cells.32 By adding a 2-pyridylthiourea additive into the perovskite precursor solution, Sun et al. prepared highly efficient and stable PSCs in ambient air, which was due to promoted crystal growth.33 Wu et al. found that an additive engineering strategy could improve the PCE and the durability of PSCs by modulating the crystalline quality of the film using an ionic liquid additive, methylammonium acetate, and a molecular additive, thio-semicarbazide.34 Moreover, polyvinyl ammonium (PVAm•HI), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), fullerene derivatives etc. have been used as additives to enhance PCEs and stability.35–38 However, the question of how to simultaneously improve the PCE and humidity and heat stability of a PSC remains.
Herein, we firstly introduced a Lewis base, acetamide (CH3CONH2), as an additive in the fabrication of PSCs for improving the PCE and stability. It was found that the addition of CH3CONH2 promotes grain growth and enhances the crystallinity of perovskite films, resulting in improvements in grain size and film thickness, and then the enhancement of optical and electrical properties. The PCE of a device with 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 was obviously enhanced from 16.44% (control device) to 19.01%. More importantly, the device with CH3CONH2 exhibited outstanding humidity and heat stability. After over 1000 h and 700 h under 50% and 80% relative humidity (RH), it retained about 70% and 50% of its starting PCE, respectively. Moreover, the PCE was only reduced by about 20% and 40% after aging at 60 °C and 85 °C for 200 h and 150 h, respectively.
Results and discussion
To explore the influence of the CH3CONH2 additive on the prepared perovskite films, we investigated the properties of the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite layer when varying amounts of CH3CONH2 (3, 5 and 10 mg mL−1) were added to the perovskite precursor solution. The fabrication process of the perovskite films, with and without CH3CONH2, is shown in Fig. 1a and the detailed preparation steps are described in the experimental section.

We obtained Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra to ascertain the interaction of the CO bond in CH3CONH2 with Pb2+ in the perovskite. The FTIR spectra of the CH3CONH2 and perovskite powders, with and without CH3CONH2, are shown in Fig. 1b and S1.† It is clear that the characteristic peak of the CO bond in CH3CONH2 appears at a wavenumber of 1680 cm−1 (the stretching vibration of C–O), whereas the perovskite sample with CH3CONH2 exhibits the characteristic peak of the CO bond at a wavenumber of 1658 cm−1. The existence and shift of the CO stretching vibration peak from 1680 cm−1 in CH3CONH2 to 1658 cm−1 in the CH3CONH2-treated perovskite indicate that CH3CONH2 has been incorporated into the perovskite film and interacted with Pb2+ in the perovskite. This interaction is beneficial for forming the nucleation center around CH3CONH2 and promoting the uniform growth of the perovskite layer. Furthermore, we also performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for the O 1s and Pb 4f signals of the perovskite films, with and without CH3CONH2, as shown in Fig. S2.† In Fig. S2a,† the O 1s signal of the perovskite film with CH3CONH2 is obviously higher than that of the film without CH3CONH2 (for the film without CH3CONH2, a slight O 1s signal is inevitably detected due to oxygen and moisture in the air). This result is strong evidence for the existence of CH3CONH2 in the perovskite. Fig. S2b† displays the two main peaks of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2. Compared to the film without CH3CONH2, the Pb 4f peaks of the film with CH3CONH2 exhibit an obvious shift which clearly reveals the interaction between CH3CONH2 and Pb2+ in the perovskite.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of perovskite films with varying amounts of CH3CONH2 are shown in Fig. 1c. The main diffraction characteristic peaks of the perovskite crystal structure appear at around 14.2°, 20.0°, 24.5°, 28.4° and 31.8°, which is in accordance with the positions of the (110), (112), (202), (220) and (310) crystal planes that have been previously reported in the literature. It can be shown that the perovskite thin films with CH3CONH2 display a stronger diffraction intensity which represents better crystallinity under the same experimental conditions. When 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 is added, the strongest diffraction peaks can be seen, indicating that it shows the best crystal structure. These results demonstrate that the addition of appropriate amounts of CH3CONH2 is beneficial for the growth and crystallization of perovskite thin films. However, when the amount of CH3CONH2 added increases to 10 mg mL−1, the intensity of the perovskite characteristic peaks decreases, which may be due to excess CH3CONH2 in the grain boundary affecting the uniform growth of the perovskite crystal.
The effect of adding varying amounts of CH3CONH2 on the surface morphology of the perovskite films was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the perovskite films, with and without CH3CONH2, exhibit smooth surfaces with high surface coverage and ordered crystallites. Compared to the film without CH3CONH2, the grain sizes of the perovskite films with CH3CONH2 are significantly enhanced, which can be seen from the top view and cross-sectional SEM images. The cross-sectional SEM images of the PSCs, with and without CH3CONH2, are exhibited in Fig. 2e and f. The thickness of the bare perovskite layer is around 895 nm, whereas the film with 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 displays a higher thickness of 1252 nm. When the amount of CH3CONH2 added was increased to 10 mg mL−1, the perovskite film displays high surface roughness with several small grains on the surface due to excess CH3CONH2. These results are consistent with the XRD patterns and the addition of urea, which has been previously observed.31

To further investigate the influence of CH3CONH2 on the optical properties of perovskite films, the UV-vis absorption spectra and PL spectra of perovskite films were obtained. They are depicted in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the absorption intensities of the perovskite films with CH3CONH2 show a slight improvement compared to that of the film without CH3CONH2, over a wavelength range from 550 to 850 nm. This improvement in absorption may be caused by the larger crystal size of perovskite films with CH3CONH2. However, the absorption intensity evidently decreases as the amount of CH3CONH2 increases to 10 mg mL−1, owing to poor film quality. Fig. 3b clearly shows that the PL intensities of perovskite films with CH3CONH2 are significantly reduced, and the film with 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 shows more evidently quenched PL, which indicates faster electron injection due to the addition of CH3CONH2.

The photovoltaic performances of PSCs with varying amounts of CH3CONH2 have also been tested. Current–voltage (J–V) curves and detailed photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Fig. 4a and Table S1,† respectively. As the amount of CH3CONH2 added increases from 0 mg mL−1 (without CH3CONH2) to 10 mg mL−1, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) are evidently improved. When the amount of CH3CONH2 added was 5 mg mL−1, the Jsc increased from 21.91 to 22.89 mA cm−2 which is a 4.5% enhancement and Voc increased from 1.02 to 1.09 V, a 6.9% enhancement. These results led to a 15.6% improvement in the PCE of the device with 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2, from 16.44% to 19.01%. Fig. 4b shows a PCE histogram fitted with a Gaussian distribution of perovskite devices, with and without CH3CONH2, over 30 measured devices. Average PCEs of 17.69% and 15.88% are acquired for the devices with 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 and without CH3CONH2. These results show that devices with CH3CONH2 have significantly enhanced PCEs and high reproducibility. However, when the amount of CH3CONH2 is increased (10, 15 and 20 mg mL−1), the excess nucleation centers around CH3CONH2 prevent the perovskite from growing uniformly and the residual photo-inactive CH3CONH2 at the grain boundary and interface impedes charge transfer, resulting in a sharp decline in PSC photovoltaic performance (as shown in Table S1†).

(b) A PCE histogram fitted with a Gaussian distribution of perovskite devices, with (5 mg mL−1) and without CH3CONH2, over 30 measured devices. (c) J–V curves of perovskite devices with (5 mg mL−1) and without CH3CONH2 under reverse and forward scan directions. (d) IPCE spectra of perovskite devices with (5 mg mL−1) and without CH3CONH2. 
The hysteresis phenomenon of PSCs is also an important indicator of photovoltaic performance. Therefore, we characterized J–V hysteresis with different scan directions. J–V curves of perovskite devices with and without CH3CONH2 under reverse and forward scan directions are depicted in Fig. 4c. The hysteresis index for the device with CH3CONH2 reduces from 1.61 to 0.49 without apparent J–V hysteresis. Detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S2.† It can be noted that the enhanced PCE is mainly ascribed to the slight improvement in Jsc. Thus, we further tested the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) to confirm the Jsc. As shown in Fig. 4d, the perovskite device with CH3CONH2 exhibits a slightly enhanced spectral response from 400 to 750 nm, indicating that it can more efficiently convert incident photons into electric current. The integrated Jsc values from the IPCE spectra are also shown in Fig. 4d. The calculated Jsc values from the IPCE spectra enhanced from 21.40 to 21.91 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the corresponding Jsc values of 22.48 and 22.89 mA cm−2 obtained from the J–V curves.
To understand the charge carrier and recombination behavior of perovskite films with CH3CONH2, transient absorption (TA) responses were investigated. Generally, higher quality perovskite film has a longer recombination lifetime, showing its excellent morphology and few structural defects, that is to say, more charge is efficiently outputted from the perovskite film to the TiO2 layer. Normalized TA responses of perovskite films with and without CH3CONH2 are demonstrated in Fig. 5a and S4.† It can be observed that the recombination lifetime of the perovskite film improves from 39 to 65 ns when 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 is added to the perovskite. This result indicates that the higher quality perovskite film with CH3CONH2 is beneficial to the diffusion of electrons and holes.

Nyquist plots, shown in Fig. 5b and S5†, were obtained to further detect charge transfer and recombination rates. Clearly, two semicircles appear in the Nyquist plots. At a low frequency range, the incomplete semicircle represents the recombination resistance (Rrec), and at a high frequency, the large semicircle reflects the charge transport resistance (Rct). From Fig. 5b, in comparison to the device without CH3CONH2, it can be found that the device with CH3CONH2 has a small Rct and a big Rrec, which indicate that the addition of CH3CONH2 is beneficial to charge transfer and suppresses the carrier recombination between the perovskite and the TiO2 layer.
Although the perovskite device with CH3CONH2 shows high photovoltaic performance, enhancing its moisture and temperature durability becomes the one greatest concern for commercial applications. Hence, we performed aging tests of the unsealed perovskite devices with and without CH3CONH2. We compared the humidity stability of the devices under 50% and 80% RH, as shown in Fig. 6a and b, and detailed methods are given in the experimental section. From the normalized PCE variation curves under 50% RH for about 1000 h, the PCE of the perovskite device with 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 exhibits a slow degradation trend and remains at about 70% of its original value. In contrast, the device without CH3CONH2 degrades to <10% of its original PCE. Under 80% RH for 700 h, in comparison to the pristine perovskite device which retains around 10% of its original PCE, the device with CH3CONH2 retains about 50% of its initial PCE. The humidity aging tests demonstrate that the perovskite device with CH3CONH2 possesses outstanding long-term stability against humidity, in contrast to the device without CH3CONH2.

Then, we carried out temperature aging tests at 60 °C and 85 °C, and these normalized PCE variation curves are displayed in Fig. 6c and d. The device with CH3CONH2 displayed superior heat stability. At 60 °C for 200 h, the device with CH3CONH2 maintained about 70% of its starting PCE, but the PSC without CH3CONH2 retained no more than 10% of its initial PCE. In addition, the PCE of the device with CH3CONH2 retained about 60% of its initial value at 85 °C for over 150 h, in contrast to the device without CH3CONH2 which retained less than 10% of its initial PCE.
From the above results, it can be clearly seen that the films with CH3CONH2 have better crystal structure and larger grain size and the devices with CH3CONH2 present better photovoltaic performance and stability than that without CH3CONH2. However, detailed reasons for this and the precise mechanism are still unclear. Here, we suggested a possible mechanism, as displayed in Fig. 7, which shows the schematic process of perovskite crystal growth with CH3CONH2 and the structure of the corresponding PSC. The high quality film of perovskites with CH3CONH2 is probably attributed to the following reasons: (1) the solubilization effect, where the addition of CH3CONH2 can promote the dissolution of PbI2, which can produce FA+ (MA+) and Pb2+ simultaneously and slowly separate out to form a uniform and dense perovskite layer, decreasing the crystallization rate of the perovskite. (2) The electron pair on the oxygen atom of the CO bond in CH3CONH2 has a strong coordination with Pb2+, which can form nucleation centers around CH3CONH2 and result in the slow and uniform growth of the perovskite layer. The slow crystallization implies high Gibbs free energy, which reduces the formation of nucleation centers.31 As a result, perovskite crystals slowly and uniformly grow into high-quality film with large grain size around a small number of nucleation centers. To further analyse the reasons for improved stability, we supposed that: on the one hand, the high-quality perovskite layer has played a significant role; on the other hand, CH3CONH2 exists around the perovskite layer after annealing and interacts with Pb2+, which can protect the perovskite layer from decomposition due to water molecule infiltration and high temperature. Hence, the devices with high-quality perovskite films have superior photovoltaic performance and high stability due to the addition of CH3CONH2.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully introduced a Lewis base CH3CONH2 additive into perovskites for the promotion of grain growth and enhancing crystallinity. It was found that the perovskite films with CH3CONH2 have a better crystal structure, larger grain size, greater thickness and improved optical and electrical properties. As a result, the device with 5 mg mL−1 CH3CONH2 displayed superior photovoltaic performance with an improved PCE from 16.44% to 19.01% and less hysteresis. In particular, the unsealed device with CH3CONH2 had enhanced moisture resistance under 50% and 80% RH for 1000 h and 700 h, respectively, and better heat stability at 60 °C and 85 °C for 200 h and 150 h, respectively. This work shows that introducing a suitable additive into a perovskite is an effective strategy for promoting perovskite film growth and further enhancing the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
All of the chemicals and reagents were purchased from TCI, Sigma-Aldrich and Sinopharm, and were used as received without further purification. Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was prepared by reacting hydriodic acid (0.1 mol, 57 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) and formamidine acetate (0.1 mol, 98%, Sinopharm) in a round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2–3 h under stirring. The solvent and excess hydriodic acid were removed using rotary evaporation at 60 °C under vacuum, leading to a white powder. After sufficient drying, the powder was further purified twice with ethanol and washed by diethyl ether and then the white solid was collected by air pump filtration. Finally, the powder was sufficiently dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven.
Device fabrication
The devices were prepared on a patterned FTO substrate, which was cleaned using ultrasonication in detergent, ultrapure water and ethanol. Using air as a carrier gas, a compact TiO2 layer was coated on the FTO using a spray pyrolysis method at 430 °C. The solution contained 0.6 mL titanium diisopropoxide and 0.4 mL bis(acetylacetonate) in 7 mL isopropanol. Then, the substrate was heated at 430 °C for 30–40 min. By diluting the TiO2 paste (30 nm, Dyesol) using anhydrous ethanol (TiO2:ethanol = 1:5.5 by weight), a mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated on the substrate at 4000 rpm for 20 s and then the substrate was annealed at 510 °C for 1 h. The perovskite layers were deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 layer by a one step spin-coating method in an airflow glove box (the relative humidity was maintained at about 20%) at firstly 1100 rpm for 11 s and secondly 4600 rpm for 33 s. A moderate amount of chlorobenzene was carefully added dropwise to the surface of the perovskite during the spin coating step 15 s before the end of the procedure. Then, the perovskite films were heated on a heating platform at 105 °C for 60 min. By dissolving the stoichiometrically corresponding perovskite powders in DMSO and DMF mixed solvent (DMF:DMSO = 4:1 by volume), 1.4 M (Pb2+) perovskite precursor solutions were obtained. Before use, the precursor solutions were heated at 60 °C for 1 h under stirring. CH3CONH2 (3, 5 and 10 mg mL−1) was dissolved in the mixed solvent before spin-coating. The HTM was formed by spin-coating a spiro-OMeTAD solution at 3000 rpm for 20 s, which included spiro-OMeTAD (73 mg), 4-tert-butylpyridine (29 μL), Li+ salt (17 μL) and cobalt(III) salt (8 μL) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, around 60 nm Au was coated on the HTM layer via thermal evaporating under high vacuum.
Characterization
XRD patterns of the perovskite films were obtained using an X’Pert MPD PRO (PANalytical). The 2θ range was 10–70° at room temperature. The spectral data in the 4000 cm−1 to 500 cm−1 range were collected using FTIR (Thermo Fisher IS50R, USA). XPS measurements were conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi system. A high-resolution field-emission SEM (FE-SEM, sirion200, FEI Corp., Holland) with a Schottky field emission gun was used to record perovskite film morphologies. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (U-3900H, HITACHI, Japan). The measurement range was from 300 nm to 900 nm. Steady-state PL spectra were obtained using a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) and studied using Fluorescence software. A standard 450 W Xenon CW lamp with an excitation wavelength of 473 nm was used to excite the samples. J–V curves were executed using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G). Before measurements were taken, the setup was calibrated using a certified silicon solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). The active area of the device was maintained at 0.09 cm2 using a black mask. IPCE spectra were performed on a dual Xenon/quartz halogen light source (PV Measurements, Inc.), and measured in DC mode with no bias light used. The wavelength range was from 300 nm to 900 nm. TA spectra were measured on an LKS (Applied photophysics) with a laser energy of 150 μJ cm−2 and repetition rate of 5 Hz. The probe light wavelength was 760 nm, and the laser light wavelength was 500 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded at −0.9 V using an Autolab analyzer (Metrohm, PGSTAT 302N, Switzerland) in the dark. The frequency range was 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Humidity aging tests were carried out in two containers under 40–50% and 70–80% RH. The containers were kept at room temperature and in the dark. Temperature aging tests were carried out in two containers at 60 °C and 85 °C. The containers were maintained at less than 10% RH and kept in the dark.
