    , Accepted 2nd July 2012First published on 4th July 2012AbstractLight induced thermocleaving of a thermally reactive copolymer based on dithienylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (DTZ) and silolodithiophene (SDT) in contact with the heat sensitive substrate the heat sensitive substrate polyethyleneterphthalate (PET) was effectively demonstrated with the use of high intensity pulsed light, delivered by a commercial photonic sintering system. Thermally labile ester groups are positioned on the DTZ unit of the copolymer that can be eliminated thermally for enhanced photochemical stability and advantages in terms of processing (solubility/insolubility switching). The photonic sintering system was successfully implemented in a full roll-to-roll process on flexible PET substrates and large-area polymer solar cell modules were prepared by solution processing of five layers under ambient conditions using the photonic sintering system for thermocleaving of the active layer. The PET foil did not show any deformation after exposure to the high intensity light only leaving the insoluble thermocleaved active layer. The active layer remained planar after light exposure thereby allowing the coating of supplementary material on top.
1. Introduction
The harvesting of energy directly from sunlight and converting it into electrical energy using photovoltaic technology is recognized as a part of the solution to the mounting global energy challenge and a fundamental part of the future renewable energy production. In contrast to the inorganic solar cell technologies, hampered by their high cost, polymer solar cells (PSCs)1–5 enable high volume solution processing under ambient conditions using fast roll-to-roll (R2R) coating and printing6–8 techniques which can realize their presumed very low production cost. At this point, a lot of the research efforts in the field have been dedicated towards the improvement of the device performance that currently reaches over an impressive 8% (ref. 9) for small scale bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer/PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) solar cells. While processing and stability issues have been by far less explored, there has been a recent interest in the photochemical stability of conjugated polymers since a high photochemical stability will be required to fully realize the potential of PSCs. The influence of the polymer chemical structure on its stability has been studied by Manceau et al.10 where general rules relative to the polymer structure–stability relationship are proposed and can be used as general guidelines for the design and development of new conjugated materials with high photochemical stability. A clear discovery was that the solubilizing groups play a key role in the degradation of conjugated polymers and their elimination largely enhances the photochemical stability. This is in good agreement with earlier reports that have linked the solubilizing groups to the instability of polymer solar cells11–19 as they allow for both morphological changes in the active layer along with eased diffusion of small molecules and constituents.
The solubilizing groups are mandatory in order to solution process polymer materials into thin films but there are many possibilities in employing polymer materials bearing thermally cleavable solubilizing groups. In this approach a labile bond functions as the linker between the solubilizing group and the photoactive polymer which allows for thermal elimination of the solubilizing group in a post-processing step. While ongoing research exploiting this novel class of material in PSCs has afforded promising results, showing stable power conversion efficiency for at least 4000 h of full sun20 (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2), high temperatures are required for thermocleaving (∼200 to 300 °C). Glass substrates, generally used for small scale lab devices, do support these temperatures but most plastic substrates, relevant for large scale roll-to-roll coated PSCs, will not. As examples, low-cost transparent plastic substrates such as biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and poly(ethylene naphthalenate) (PEN) support temperatures of 65 °C, 140 °C, and 180 °C respectively without significant deformation.
To overcome this challenge thermocleaving at lower temperatures has been explored in a large-scale public demonstration21 of PSCs, where thermocleaving of the polymer poly(3-(2-methyl-2-hexyl)oxycarbonyldithiophene) (P3MHOCT) was carried out on PET at 140 °C. While P3MHOCT does thermocleave at 140 °C, the reaction is very slow which was a significant limitation to the process in this work. While thermocleavable materials can offer significant advantages in terms of stability and processing (solubility/insolubility switching) new methods for achieving fast thermocleaving in high speed roll-to-roll coating of PSCs are needed before this class of material can be considered as a potential candidate for large scale production of PSCs. A possible solution to this problem could come from looking beyond the vacant material properties and also focusing on the processing options. Instead of using a heating oven, that heats both material and substrate, one could explore the use of light-induced heat generation where the absorption of light by a material generates heat through non-radiative energy dissipation and exothermic photochemical reactions. High intensity pulsed light has been used in the production of optical storage media and displays for many years and recently it has also been found useful for the sintering of metal based inks on heat sensitive low-cost plastic substrates.22–24 The advantage, compared to using a heating oven, is that thin films can be annealed at a high temperature in milliseconds on flexible or rigid substrates. In addition, the short-duration pulses, with high power density, are rapid enough to avoid heat buildup on the substrate which leaves thermally fragile substrates unaffected.
In this work we explore the use of high intensity pulsed light, delivered by a commercial photonic sintering system (Sinteron 2000, Xenon Corp.), for selectively heating and thermocleaving a thermocleavable semiconducting layer in contact with the heat sensitive substrate PET. In theory, the pulsed light is only absorbed by the thermocleavable layer, thus heating it to a high temperature for a very brief amount of time where the latent heat of the substrate together with a cooling zone between pulses prevents it from being damaged. The photonic sintering system was implemented in a full roll-to-roll process on flexible plastic substrates. Large-area polymer solar cell modules were prepared by solution processing of five layers under ambient conditions using the photonic sintering system for thermocleaving of the active layer. The thermocleaving reaction was studied by the chemical characterization technique, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), to determine the degree of the chemical transformations.25
2. Results and discussion
For the thermocleavable semiconducting layer we chose to employ thermally reactive copolymers (Fig. 1a) based on dithienylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (DTZ) and dialkylsilolodithiophene (SDT). The use of the thiazolothiazole fused ring as electron-deficient moiety has been reported to ensure a rigid coplanar backbone with extended π-electron delocalization and strong interchain stacking ability.26,27 In addition, the polymer system based on alternating DTZ and SDT units has proven to exhibit excellent photochemical stability during accelerated ageing conditions at 100 solar intensities.28 For solubility, we initially investigated the correlation between different thermally labile ester substituents on the DTZ unit (Fig. 1a) and the BHJ polymer/PCBM device performance. The polymers were prepared by a previously published 5 step procedure28 in good total yield (9–14%). Copolymerization was performed via a Stille coupling using the catalyst system Pd2dba3/P(o-Tolyl)3 which gives the polymers P1–P3 as dark blue solids. At room temperature P1 shows limited solubility but dissolves in hot chlorinated solvents. On the contrary, P2 and P3 dissolve readily in chlorinated solvents at room temperature which is ascribed to enhanced solubility of their bulkier ester substituents on the DTZ unit. The molecular weight after purification, as determined by analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in chloroform, could only be determined for P1 (Table 1). P2 and P3 have a higher tendency to aggregate in the SEC column which gives rise to an artificial expansive peak at a shorter retention time in the chromatogram corresponding to a significant overestimation of the molecular weight.

The thin-film absorption spectra of the polymers have an anticipated related profile (Fig. 1b) with maximum around 580 nm, optical band gaps around 1.8 eV and vibronic fine structure in the 590–620 nm range. By replacing the bulkier ester substituents in P2 and P3 with the less bulky 3-methyl-3-octanyl-carboxylate in P1 a small broadening and red-shift of the absorption spectra are obtained. A more significant red shift, 47–60 nm, can be observed when the polymer films, P1–P3, are annealed at 225 °C (ESI, Fig. S2†), leaving a completely insoluble film. As shown in our previous work,28,29 the bulky ester groups are eliminated at this temperature which most likely improves the polymer packing and the planarization of the conjugated backbone, thereby lowering the band gap. However, the same red-shift of the absorption spectra after elimination of the ester groups does not apply for the polymers in blends with PCBM, indicating that the conformation in the conjugated backbone gets locked to some extent.28
The photovoltaic performance of the polymers was firstly tested in small area bulk heterojunction solar cells with the inverted device architecture glass/ITO/ZnO/polymer:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag, where PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). The active layers were processed by spin-coating and thermal elimination of the ester groups was carried out on a hot-plate. The optimized solar cell efficiencies are summarized in Table 2 and the obtained current–voltage curves of the polymer:PCBM solar cells are presented in Fig. 2. An open circuit voltage (Voc) up to 0.68 V can be reached with all three polymers but the best devices were prepared with P1 reaching PCEs up to 1.76% with a short-circuit current density Jsc = 5.98 mA cm−2 and a fill factor FF = 0.43. When comparing P1–P3 it is apparent that when decreasing the branching of the ester group, from 2,5,9-trimethyl-2-decanyl-carboxylate (P3) to 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanyl-carboxylate (P2) and further to 3-methyl-3-octanyl-carboxylate (P1), the device performance improves, generally due to an increase in the current density. In addition, the polymer/PCBM device films have a surface roughness (Sa), measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (ESI, Fig. S1†), ranging from 0.89–1.22 nm which is reduced along with the decrease of the branching of the ester groups in the polymer. The best performing polymer, P1, appears to comprise the most favorable ester groups for optimal device film processing and subsequent thermocleaving. Thus, we chose to explore P1 further in a full R2R process of polymer solar cells.

2.1. Light cleaving of thermocleavable materials
Initially, we explored the photonic sintering system using a model compound, poly[2,5-(2-methyl-2-hexyl thiophene-3-carboxylate)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PMHTBT), that displays a clear color change upon thermocleavage due to a significant red-shift in the absorption spectra (Fig. 3b). Thermocleavage of PMHTBT follows a well known process for solubility switching of polymer films where thermal elimination of a tertiary ester, attached to a thiophene unit, can proceed in two steps with increasing temperature (Fig. 3a) by initial removal of the tertiary substituent followed by decarboxylation.30 Fourier-transform IR (FTIR) spectra and thermogravimetric data for PMHTBT in the temperature range 50–500 °C confirmed the thermolytic transformations (see ESI†). The advantage of using the model compound PMHTBT, instead of the polymer of interest in this work (P1), for a pre-study investigating the suitable dose of light required for thermocleaving, is that it can provide a very quick result in terms of a noticeable color change upon thermocleaving. An approximately 100 nm thick PMHTBT film was spin-coated onto a 130 μm thick PET substrate and placed under the flash lamp. The xenon flash lamp was set to operate with an electrical pulse energy of approx. 700 J which delivered an optical energy density of approx. 3.3 J cm−2 at 25 mm distance to the lamp housing. The pulse duration was set to 0.5 ms which results in a power density of 6.6 kW cm−2 (25 mm distance). Fig. 4 shows flashed PMHTBT films at two different distances from the flash lamp. At 25 mm distance (in-focus) 3–5 pulses were sufficient to convert PMHTBT through the film to PTBT which can be seen as a clear color change from orange to blue (Fig. 4a). Moving out of focus lowers the percentage of the delivered pulse energy that will reach the film surface while giving better uniformity and a wider light footprint. Thus, a larger area can be flashed, when out of focus, over a given time period which is more practical in a R2R process of large area PSCs where web speeds up 2 m min−1 are used.31 At 35 mm distance (power density approx. 6 kW cm−2) PMHTBT thermocleaved to PCTBT/PTBT by means of 1–3 pulses which could be determined by a detectable color change from orange to pale violet and a high solvent resistance (Fig. 4b–d). The thermocleaved PMHTBT film is likely to present chemistry corresponding to both the free carboxylic acid and the decarboxylated material (PCTBT/PTBT) to varying degrees while the overall goal of eliminating the side chains and conveying insolubility has been accomplished.

(b) Thin film absorption spectra of PMHTBT, PCTBT and PTBT. Thin films of PCTBT and PTBT were prepared by annealing a PMHTBT film on a hotplate at 200 or 300 °C respectively.

Not to scale. Images (b)–(d) show a typical solvent resistance test of a flashed PMHTBT film (35 mm distance) fully immersed in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). After washing with ODCB (d) only the flashed thermocleaved band remained on the substrate demonstrating a high solvent resistance. 
Thermocleaving the polymer of interest in this work (P1) to P0 does not display any evident color change so the degree of the chemical transformation was followed using XPS25 and solvent resistance tests through immersing the polymer films in ODCB. Approximately 100 nm thick P1 films, on PET substrates, were converted to P0 using the flash lamp at 35–50 mm distance which results in a delivered power density of approx. 3–6 kW cm−2 (pulse duration = 0.5 ms). At 35 mm distance P1 thermocleaved to P0 by means of 1–3 pulses whereas at 50 mm distance it required 4–7 pulses. Experimentally determined atom compositions of pristine and flashed P1 films, as measured using XPS, are shown in Fig. 5. The observed atom percent correlates well with the theoretical prediction for carbon, nitrogen and silicon but not in the case of the sulfur and oxygen contents for flashed P1 films. From the theoretical prediction the oxygen content should not change much, when P1 transforms to P0, but this was not observed so it is likely that a minor part of the material oxidizes through several pulses in an attempt to achieve 100% reaction. The over enrichment of oxygen in the flashed P1 films can possibly explain why the measured carbon content is slightly smaller than the theoretical prediction. It should be stressed that all the flash experiments were carried out in ambient air to reduce the complexity to a minimum since R2R coating equipment is large and difficult to enclose and operate in an inert atmosphere.

2.2. Roll-to-roll processing
Both small area roll coated solar cells (active area = 1 cm2) and large area R2R coated solar cell modules (active area = 35.5 cm2) were processed with an inverted device geometry (PET/ITO/ZnO/P1:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag) on flexible PET substrates (Fig. 6). Coating of the active layer was initially tested on a simple roll coating machine32 to investigate a variety of parameters (i.e. temperature, ink usage, speed, flash process) before proceeding to full R2R processing. The roll coating was performed on an ITO sputtered PET substrate (1 m × 0.15 m mounted on the roll coater) with patterned stripes of 13 mm width precoated with a ZnO layer. P1:PCBM (1:2) ink, with a total concentration of 29 mg ml−1, coated optimally from ODCB with a roller temperature around 70 °C and at a speed of 1 m min−1. These conditions allowed a quick and uniform drying process which resulted in good quality films. After drying, the foil was removed from the roller and mounted under the flash lamp at 50 mm distance from the lamp housing. The lamp was set to operate with an electrical pulse energy of approx. 500 J which delivered an optical energy density of approx. 1 J cm−2. The best results were executed with a web speed of 0.5 m min−1 and the pulse duration set to 0.5 ms, whereas the flash frequency is fixed at 1.8 Hz by the manufacturer. With this setup the films thermocleaved efficiently and dramatically improved the solvent resistance. In addition, the PET foil did not show any deformation after exposure to the high intensity light and the coated material remained planar which allowed supplementary coating. Subsequently, the foil was mounted back on the roll coater and PEDOT:PSS was coated on top of the thermocleaved active layer. Lastly, the solar cells were completed from the coated stripes by dividing the 1 m stripe into sections for application of a 1 cm2 printed silver top electrode (Fig. 6E). This resulted in over 50 solar cells in each stripe experiment which were characterized under 100 mW cm−2 white light (Fig. 7a). The solar cells showed an average PCE around 0.4% whereas the best devices showed efficiencies up to 0.6% with Jsc = 3.50 mA cm−2, FF = 0.30 and Voc = 0.60 V (Table 3).

The roll process of PSCs based on P1:PCBM was readily scalable to a full R2R process with successful implementation of the photonic sintering system. A schematic drawing of the R2R setup is shown in Fig. 8 together with pictures of the R2R process of PSC modules based on P1:PC71BM. The device modules were prepared using both slot-die coating and screen printing of the layers in the form of 5 mm wide stripes that were serially connected. The final modules comprised of 16 serially connected solar cells with a total active area of 35.5 cm2. This set of flashed modules gave a performance of 0.25–0.53% with module open circuit voltages in the range of 6.5–8.2 V and module short circuit currents in the 4.99–9.02 mA range. Compared to some of the most well documented examples of a fully R2R coated PSC,33,34 where PCEs around 2% are reported, the performance of the P1:PC71BM modules is inferior but it should be stressed that thermocleavable materials bring an extra dimension to the optimization scheme where the device film in addition to thermal and solvent annealing can be altered chemically. One observation, that could partly explain the inferior performance, was the generation of minor cracks in the ITO layer in flashed areas. Even though the devices were still functional these cracks could lead to reduced charge transport and thereby hamper the performance of the cells. However, in spite of the more complex materials-handling, these results should be considered as an essential step on the way to large scale R2R manufacture of polymer solar cells based on thermocleavable materials. The flash system described here enables the selective heating of a thermocleavable semiconducting layer in contact with a heat sensitive plastic substrate which was the overall goal. This represents a significant step beyond the current state-of-the-art where light induced curing of thermocleavable materials using a high intensity light-emitting diode (LED) based source was demonstrated to work only on heat stable substrates giving inferior performance.25 However, further work on optimizing the flash process is warranted with respect to a variety of flash parameters (i.e. pulse energy, pulse duration, web speed, lamp spectra) and the choice of suitable active materials (e.g. ITO free devices).

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, thermally reactive copolymers based on DTZ and SDT, demonstrating band gaps in the range of 1.66–1.82 eV, have been synthesized and evaluated in small area bulk heterojunction polymer/PCBM solar cells. For improved photochemical stability and advantages in terms of processing (solubility/insolubility switching) the solubilising chains on the DTZ unit are thermally removable ester groups. Decreasing the branching of the ester group to a minimum appears to comprise the most favorable ordering for optimal device film processing and subsequent thermocleavage. The best performing polymer (P1) was further explored in a full R2R process of PSCs on a flexible PET substrate using high intensity pulsed light for thermocleaving. Selective heating of the thermocleavable P1 film in contact with the heat sensitive substrate PET was effectively demonstrated with the use of high intensity pulsed light, delivered by a commercial photonic sintering system. The photonic sintering system was successfully implemented in a full roll-to-roll process on flexible PET substrates and large-area polymer solar cell modules were prepared by solution processing under ambient conditions using the photonic sintering system for thermocleaving of the active layer. The final modules demonstrated a photovoltaic performance up to 0.53%. While the flash system facilitates the selective heating of a thermocleavable semiconducting layer in contact with a heat sensitive plastic substrate we also observed minor cracks in the ITO layer in the flashed areas. Thus, it is clear that there will be some restriction to the choice/quality of active materials when one explores the use of high intensity pulsed light in a PSC process.
4. Experimental
4.1. Photonic sintering system
The commercial photonic sintering system (Sinteron 2000, Xenon Corp.) consists of a power supply, controller, pulse forming networks (PFN) and an air-cooled xenon flash lamp. The system has a pulse energy range of 150 to 2000 Joules and fixed pulse durations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 ms, whereas 50–60% of the electrical pulse energy is converted to optical energy output. The flash lamp housing was mounted on a roll-to-roll system at a variable distance to the substrate as illustrated in Fig. 8. The 16" xenon linear flash lamp delivers a broadband spectrum from 190 nm to 1000 nm. The pulse duration in this study was set to 0.5 ms (PFN 1) with a fixed flash frequency of 1.8 Hz in continuous mode. The lamp housing contains a reflector which focuses the light at a distance of 1". The maximum optical energy reaching the target at this distance has an optical footprint of 1.9 cm × 30.5 cm and is generated by direct and focused light reflected by the mirror. Optical energy densities for different distances and electrical pulse energies were derived by datasets given in the system's manual and represent approximate values.
4.2. Small area solar cells
Inverted photovoltaic devices were made by spin coating a ZnO precursor solution35 onto precleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (9–15 Ω per square) (LumTec) followed by annealing at 140 °C for 10 min. The active layer was deposited by spin coating a 1:2 blend of the polymer and PCBM dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (26 mg ml−1). After drying the substrate was heated on a hotplate at 225 °C for approximately 1 min in order to eliminate the ester groups to yield P0. This was followed by the application of PEDOT:PSS (Agfa EL-P 5010) diluted with isopropanol 2:1 (w/w) by spin-coating at 3000 rpm and then drying on a hotplate at 110 °C for 5 min. The device was completed by evaporation of silver as back electrode at 2–3 × 10−6 mbar. The active area of the cells was 0.25 cm2. I–V characteristics were measured under AM1.5G corresponding to 100 mW cm−2 white light using a solar simulator from Steuernagel Lichttechnik.
4.3. R2R coated solar cells
Roll and R2R coating was performed following ProcessOne technology.33,34 Firstly a layer of the ZnO precursor solution was slot-die coated on top of a ITO sputtered PET substrate with patterned stripes in the form of 5 mm wide stripes separated by 1 mm. The typical coating speed was 2 m min−1 and the coated material was dried at temperatures up to 140 °C affording insoluble films of zinc oxide. This was followed by slot-die coating of a 1:2 blend of P1:PC71BM (29 mg ml−1) at a web speed of 1.6 m min−1 giving a wet layer thickness around 5.3 μm and a dry layer thickness around 130 nm. Thermocleaving of the active layer was performed at 50 mm distance from the flash lamp. The lamp was set to operate with a pulse energy of approx. 500 J which delivered an optical energy density of approx. 1 J cm−2. The films thermocleaved efficiently with a web speed of 0.5 m min−1 and the pulse duration was set to 0.5 ms, whereas the flash frequency is fixed at 1.8 Hz by the manufacturer. This was followed by slot-die coating of PEDOT:PSS (Agfa EL-P 5010) diluted with isopropanol 2:1 (w/w) at a web speed of 0.3 m min−1 and drying at temperatures up to 140 °C. Finally the devices were completed by screen printing of a silver (PV410, Dupont) grid back electrode followed by heat treatment at 140 °C. The final modules were comprised of 16 serially connected solar cells with a total active area of 35.5 cm2. I–V characteristics were measured under AM1.5G corresponding to 100 mW cm−2 white light using a solar simulator from Steuernagel Lichttechnik.
