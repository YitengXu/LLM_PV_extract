    , Accepted 7th July 2020First published on 14th July 2020AbstractAll-inorganic double perovskites as promising photovoltaic materials have received great attention in recent years. In this work, the structural, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of mixed-halide double perovskites Cs2TiI6−xBrx (x = 0, 2, 4, and 6) were studied by using first-principles calculations. The calculated lattice parameters of Cs2TiI6−xBrx agree well with the reported experimental values. The calculated results have confirmed that these compounds are thermodynamically stable. Moreover, these mixed-halide double perovskites can easily be converted into thin films based on their unique mechanical properties. The obtained band gaps of the Cs2TiI6−xBrx systems using the PBE+U method have better matched with the experimental values. When the Br content increases, the band gap of Cs2TiI6−xBrx increases gradually, which leads to a decreased optical performance in the visible light region. Based on a suitable direct band gap and strong absorption coefficient, Cs2TiI2Br4 is an ideal potential material for single-junction solar cells.
1 Introduction
The search for lead-free halide perovskites has attracted extensive attention owing to their excellent properties, such as tunable band gap, high optical absorption, long carrier diffusion length, low exciton binding energy, and low-cost manufacturability.1–8 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead-based perovskite solar cells has rapidly improved from 3.8% in 20099 to 25.2% in 2019.10 However, to overcome the intrinsic instability of hybrid perovskites is still a challenging task. Besides, these materials contain the toxic lead element. Therefore, the development of non-toxic, stable, and high-efficiency perovskite materials has attracted significant attention in recent years.
Vacancy-ordered double perovskite Cs2SnX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) materials have been widely studied in the past few years.11–15 Cs2SnI6 is a direct band gap semiconductor with strong optical absorption. The reported experimental band gap of Cs2SnI6 is in the range of 1.3–1.6 eV.13,14 However, the PCE of the Cs2SnI6-based solar cell is about 1%.14 A series of phase transitions in Cs2SnI6 have been investigated by anharmonic phonon modes.16 Recently, a series of Cs2TiI6−xBrx perovskites have been successfully synthesized, and their band gaps are in the range of 1.0–1.8 eV.17 Owing to its suitable band gap, good structural stability, and high optical absorption coefficient, Cs2TiI6−xBrx shows potential applications in perovskite solar cells. The electronic and optical properties of inorganic halide perovskites Cs2TiX6 (X = Br, I) have been investigated.18 The effects of thickness of the absorbing layer and the variation of the device working temperature on the photovoltaic performance of Cs2TiX6 (X = Br, I, F, Cl) were also explored using a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS) program.19 Compared with Cs2TiBr6 and Cs2TiI6, Cs2TiI2Br4 is considered as a better light absorption layer based on the hot carrier energy loss.20 The band gap of Cs2TiBr6 is ∼1.8 eV,17 and it has a long carrier diffusion length of over 100 nm.21 The certified PCE of the Cs2TiBr6-based solar cell is only 3.28%.21 The open voltage is 1.02 eV, while its short circuit current density is very low (5.69 mA cm−2).21 The structural, electronic, and optical properties of double perovskites Cs2Ti(Br1−xYx)6 (Y = Cl, I, x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) were studied based on density functional theory. The calculated results reveal the potential applications of Cs2Ti(Br0.75Cl0.25)6 in perovskite solar cells.22 Mixed-halide perovskites have been studied theoretically to improve their structural stability and tune the band gap.23–25 In order to enhance the efficiency of Cs2TiBr6-based solar cells, it is critical to decreasing the band gap of Cs2TiBr6, which leads to an increased short circuit current density. To the best of our knowledge, the mechanical properties of Cs2TiI6−xBrx perovskites have not been studied so far.
In this work, the effects of the partial substitution of I by Br on the material properties of Cs2TiI6 are explored in detail. We find that the band gaps of the Cs2TiI6−xBrx perovskites can be tuned by Br doping according to our calculated results. Moreover, the band gaps obtained from the PBE+U method agree with their experimental values. The band gap of Cs2TiI2Br4 is 1.39 eV, which is an ideal candidate material for single-junction solar cells. Compared with Cs2TiI6, the Br-doped perovskites are considered as ductile materials, which is beneficial for forming high quality films. Our study provides a reasonable and feasible method to tune the band gap and increase the optical absorption in the visible light region through the doping of the halide element. This strategy is expected to further improve the photovoltaic performance of all-inorganic Ti-based perovskite solar cells.
2 Computational details
The material properties of mixed-halide double perovskites Cs2TiI6−xBrx were calculated using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method26 based on density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).27 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to account for the exchange–correlation interaction.28 A cut-off energy of 500 eV was adopted for the plane wave basis sets. The total energy was converged until it is smaller than 10−5 eV, and the criterion of forces for each atom was set to 0.01 eV Å−1. Special k points of 4 × 4 × 4 and 8 × 8 × 8 were adopted to calculate the structural and electronic properties, respectively. In this work, the electronic structure of Cs2TiI6−xBrx was evaluated by using the PBE and PBE+U methods.29 Different values of U have been tested for Ti 3d orbitals of Cs2TiI6−xBrx. U = 2 eV was finally chosen for the electronic and optical calculations for the Cs2TiI6−xBrx perovskites.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structural properties
The cubic structures of the Cs2TiI6−xBrx perovskites have been reported in the experiment.17 Crystal structures of the Cs2TiI6−xBrx perovskites are shown in Fig. 1. Two values of I:Br ratios are considered in this study, namely 2:1 (x = 2) and 1:2 (x = 4) in addition to the pure structure of each compound (x = 0 and 6). The optimized lattice parameter of Cs2TiI6 is 11.82 Å, which is in agreement with its experimental value (11.67 Å).17 The lattice parameter of Cs2TiI6−xBrx decreased gradually with the increasing content of Br, as shown in Fig. 2. We find that the values of our calculated lattice parameters are slightly larger than the corresponding experimental data17 within an acceptable value (1–2% overestimation).

 Fig. 2  Theoretical and experimental lattice parameters of Cs2TiI6−xBrx. 
To explore the change of thermodynamical stability after Br doping, we calculated the formation energy of Cs2TiI6−xBrx. For the pure perovskite, the formation energy can be evaluated using the following expression: ΔE1 = E(Cs2TiX6) − 2E(CsX) − E(TiX4)(1)where X stands for the halide element (I or Br), and E(Cs2TiX6), E(CsX), and E(TiX4) are the total energies of Cs2TiX6, CsX, and TiX4, respectively. Besides, the formation energies of the mixed-halide perovskites can be described as follows: ΔE2 = E(Cs2TiI4Br2) − 2E(CsBr) − E(TiI4)(2) ΔE3 = E(Cs2TiI2Br4) − 2E(CsI) − E(TiBr4)(3)
The calculated formation energies of these compounds are shown in Fig. 3. It should be noted that the temperature is set to be 0 K in DFT calculations, so the values of T and ΔS are equal to zero. It can be seen that the negative ΔE indicates that these compounds are thermodynamically stable. Interestingly, Cs2TiI4Br2 is the most stable structure, and Cs2TiI2Br4 has the lowest stability among the studied perovskites. When the Br content increases gradually, the material stability of Cs2TiI6−xBrx does not increase linearly, which is related to the considered phase decomposition pathway of the mixed-halide perovskites.

3.2 Mechanical properties
In order to predict the mechanical stability of these materials, the elastic constants are calculated using the finite strain theory.30 The cubic structure has three independent elastic constants (C11, C12, and C44). Born mechanical stability criteria is given by: C11 − C12 > 0, C11 + 2C12 > 0, and C44 > 0.31 The calculated elastic constants of Cs2TiI6−xBrx are shown in Fig. 4(a). According to the above-mentioned criteria, these compounds are mechanically stable. To distinguish the ductile materials from brittle, the Pugh's ratio (B/G) and Poisson ratio (ν) are used. The Poisson ratio can be evaluated by using the following formula:32 ν = (3B − 2G)/(6B + 2G)(4)where B and G are the bulk modulus and shear modulus, respectively. The critical values of B/G and ν are 1.75 and 0.26, respectively.33,34 In other words, the compound is considered as a ductile material when the B/G value is greater than 1.75 or the ν value is larger than 0.26, otherwise it is taken as a brittle material. As shown in Fig. 4(b), it can be seen that Cs2TiI6 is a brittle material, while the other three compounds are ductile materials. Moreover, the larger values of Pugh's ratio and Poisson ratio can be obtained by increasing the Br content. It is beneficial for mixed-halide perovskites to form high quality films and further improve the photovoltaic efficiency.

3.3 Electronic structure
The band structures of Cs2TiI6−xBrx are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that all perovskites are direct band gap semiconductors. Fig. 6 shows that the band gap variation concerning the Br concentration, which is calculated using the PBE and PBE+U methods and compared with the corresponding theoretical and experimental values. In general, the band gaps of Cs2TiI6−xBrx increase with the increasing Br concentration. The band gaps of Cs2TiI6−xBrx are slightly underestimated using the PBE method. The calculated band gaps from the PBE+U method are 1.11, 1.05, 1.39, and 1.81 eV for Cs2TiI6, Cs2TiI4Br2, Cs2TiI2Br4, and Cs2TiBr6, respectively, which agree well with the experimental values.17 The previous theoretical results have indicated that the band gaps of Cs2TiI6−xBrx obtained from the HSE06 calculations are slightly larger than their experimental values.17 When the effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is considered, the calculated band gaps of Cs2TiI6−xBrx are close to the experimental results.17 Note that both the HSE06 and HSE06 + SOC calculations are quite time-consuming. It is well known that the SOC effect can significantly reduce the band gaps of lead-based halide perovskites.35 The recent theoretical study has confirmed that the SOC effect has little impact on the band gaps of Cs2TiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I).22 The major reason for this phenomenon is that Ti is a light element and it has less electron coupling. The band gaps of Cs2TiI2Br4 and Cs2TiBr6 obtained from the PBE+U method matched better with the experimental values (1.38 eV and 1.78 eV). According to the Shockley–Queisser theory,36 Cs2TiI2Br4 is a promising candidate material for single-junction solar cells, while Cs2TiBr6 is an ideal candidate for tandem solar cells.37 A recent theoretical study suggests that cubic K2SnBr6 and monoclinic K2SnI6 are suitable for applications in single-junction solar cells due to their appropriate band gaps and low exciton binding energies.38

The density of states of Cs2TiI6−xBrx is computed and is shown in Fig. 7. The analysis of the partial density of states of Cs2TiI6 reveals that the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly contributed by the I 5p-orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mostly contributed by the Ti 3d-orbitals. It can be seen that the addition of Br increases the 4p-orbitals in the VBM, as shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c), and the results show that the contribution of the VBM is mainly composed of the I 5p-orbitals and the Br 4p-orbitals. When I is substituted by Br, the VBM is mainly contributed by the Br 4p-orbitals. It is clear that the halogen substitution has little effect on the CBM, and the 3d-orbitals of Ti are still the major contributors to the CBM. The 6s-orbitals of Cs provide no contribution to the VBM or CBM.

3.4 Optical properties
Another important property of photovoltaic materials is the optical absorption coefficient. Fig. 8 shows the calculated absorption coefficient of Cs2TiI6−xBrx. Cs2TiI6 exhibits good optical absorption in the whole region. Two major absorption peaks are located at about 420 and 750 nm, respectively. The main optical absorption of Cs2TiBr6 is in the range of 300–600 nm, and it has the strongest absorption coefficient at ∼320 nm. Two strong absorption peaks of Cs2TiI2Br4 are located at about 400 and 650 nm, respectively. It is observed that Br doping has an important effect on the optical properties of Cs2TiI6−xBrx. In view of the strong absorption coefficient and suitable band gap, Cs2TiI2Br4 is a promising candidate material for single-junction solar cells.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the effect of mixed-halide on the structural stability, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of double perovskites Cs2TiI6−xBrx (x = 0, 2, 4, and 6). The calculated lattice parameters of Cs2TiI6−xBrx are consistent with their experimental values. From the calculation of formation energy, all the studied perovskites are found to be highly stable. Br-doped Ti-based double perovskites are considered as ductile materials. Their band gap can be tuned from 1.1 to 1.8 eV by changing the ratio of Br doping. The band gaps of the Cs2TiI6−xBrx systems can be accurately predicted by employing the PBE+U method. Cs2TiI2Br4 has an ideal band gap and strong optical absorption, and this material is suitable for single-junction solar cells. However, Cs2TiBr6 can be used for tandem solar cells. The present theoretical findings are expected to provide more information on the photovoltaic performance of mixed-halide double perovskites.
