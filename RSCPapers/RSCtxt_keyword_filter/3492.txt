    , Accepted 25th September 2019First published on 27th September 2019AbstractCZTSSe absorbers are synthesized by a one-step annealing process from Cu, SnS and ZnS stacks prepared by sputtering deposition. CZTSSe thin films are fabricated by a selenization process using an optimized precursor stack structure. The selenization temperature has a strong influence on the phase and reactions of the elements in the films. CZTSSe formation is initially triggered by the interaction of Cu with Sn(S, Se) to form CuSn(S, Se) compounds, which then react with ZnS. CZTSSe films obtained at 590 °C exhibit a kesterite structure. Sulfo-selenization is performed using an optimized selenization process. Based on the mass ratio of the chalcogen sources, selenium disulfide and selenium, the effect of the S/(S + Se) compositional ratio on the structural and morphological properties of the as-grown films and the optoelectronic parameters of solar cells fabricated using these absorber films are studied. Using this single-step sulfo-selenization method, CZTSSe devices with conversion efficiencies up to 9.47% are obtained.
1. Introduction
Thin-film photovoltaic materials need to be cost effective and earth abundant and offer a long functional lifetime without significant reduction in the solar cell efficiency. From an industrial production point of view, Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) has shown the best conversion efficiencies among photovoltaic materials both on the lab scale and for full-sized modules and therefore has better potential in the long run for use in the most cost-effective solar cells.1 However, the amount of the expensive rare metal indium used in the mass production stage of CIGS thin-film solar cells is troublesome.2 Indium resources are becoming increasingly scarce with the expansion of the display field. For these reasons, the need to replace indium has led to the investigation of materials with similar properties. Among these materials, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) and sulfo-selenide Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin films are the most promising photovoltaic absorbers to replace CIGS because they are composed of abundant and inexpensive elements and have a very high absorption coefficient of over 104 cm−1 and a direct bandgap energy of 1.5 eV.3 The theoretical solar conversion efficiency of CZTS-based thin film solar cells is as high as 32.2%.4 However, regarding the electrical characteristics of devices based on these materials, the maximum reported conversion efficiencies are still far from those achieved with more mature CIGS technologies. A key parameter impacting the increasing photovoltaic efficiencies in CZTSSe solar cells is bandgap control of the absorber through the control of the S/(S + Se) ratio in CZTSSe thin films. The well-renowned hydrazine process led to the world record efficiency for CZTSSe of 12.6% after proper optical design and control of the S/(S + Se) ratio.5 Various physical and chemical techniques, such as RF magnetron sputtering,6 thermal evaporation,7 pulsed laser deposition,8 nanocrystal coating,3 hybrid solution-particle coating,5 and sulfurization of electron beam-evaporated precursors,9 have been used for the synthesis of CZTSSe thin films for solar cell application. However, methods for precisely controlling the chalcogen composition in the absorber layer are rarely reported. In general, CZTS and the related selenide CZTSe and CZTSSe thin films have been prepared through different routes, including the reaction of metal or sulfide precursors in a sulfur or selenium atmosphere and single-stage physical vapour deposition. Nevertheless, freely adjusting the composition of the S/(S + Se) ratio in CZTSSe thin films using these methods is difficult.
In addition, the characteristics of CZTS, CZTSe and CZTSSe thin films and devices produced by a two-step process are greatly affected by the stacked structure of the precursor.10–15 In the case of our selenization annealing process, we chose a Cu/SnS/ZnS/Mo/glass stacked structure, which afforded CZTS and CZTSe with good crystallinity.10–12
We previously prepared CZTSSe thin films from sulfur compound precursors under an elemental selenium atmosphere in a sealed tube.12 The merits of this technique are as follows: (1) introducing Se and S into the precursor films leads to good uniformity of the films. (2) Deviation of the resulting compositions from those of the precursors can be suppressed through the thermal selenization process. (3) CZTSSe films without noticeable voids can be obtained. However, previous studies did not show free control of S/(S + Se) because the S originated not from a chalcogen vapour source but from a SnS and ZnS precursor stack. One method to prepare pentenary compounds from metal or sulfide precursors is to submit precursors to a multistep chalcogenization process, such as a two-step selenization/sulfurization growth process. Although the multistep reaction process can enable control of the S/(S + Se) ratio in the CZTSSe film, controlling the electrical properties and reaction growth of the absorber layers in our experiments is difficult. These reaction processes could require a large amount of process time and equipment. Thus, a single-step thermal treatment capable of introducing both sulfur and selenium is of interest. Some reports on single-step sulfo-selenization processes for Cu–Zn–Sn precursors have been presented, but little is known about the effect of the process parameters on chalcogen incorporation.15–17
In this work, pentenary CZTSSe thin films are synthesized by a one-step sulfo-selenization process using a metal and sulfur compound hybrid precursor, Cu/SnS/ZnS/Mo/glass, deposited by RF and DC magnetron sputtering. We show the possibility of tuning the S/(S + Se) ratio to form CZTSSe films with increased sulfur content. We also demonstrate the ability to tune the S/(S + Se) ratio by varying the amount of each chalcogen placed in the thermal process chamber. The sulfo-selenization process can be performed in a pressurized chamber at a pressure of 1.2 atm. The S and Se vapour in the chamber of the heat treatment equipment is designed to be well trapped in the precursor sample holder, with the internal gas flow stagnating above atmospheric pressure, allowing the S/Se contents to be controlled by maintaining the reactivity. In our thermal process system, minimization of vapour source exhaustion and easy substitution with chalcogens in CZTSSe films are possible.
2. Experimental section
The precursor metal films were fabricated on molybdenum-coated SLG substrates. The metal and sulfide precursor layers were sequentially deposited by sputtering 99.99% pure Cu, ZnS, and SnS targets. The metal and sulfide precursors with Cu/SnS/ZnS sequences were formed on the Mo/SLG substrate by RF/DC sputtering at room temperature. The layers were deposited under sputtering powers of 150 W, 200 W, and 200 W for the Cu (DC power), SnS (RF power/Sn:S = 1:1) and ZnS (RF power/Zn:S = 1:1) targets, respectively, at a working pressure of 3 mTorr in an Ar atmosphere. The thickness of each layer of the precursor was adjusted to control the final thickness and composition ratio of the CZTSSe film. Each layer of the precursor was controlled to obtain a Cu:SnS:ZnS thickness ratio of 1:2.6:2.1. The metal-sulfide compound precursors were reacted and annealed in a nearly sealed halogen furnace with a heating block push–pull sample holder in the quartz chamber that enabled the precursor samples to be inserted or removed from the hot reaction zone. The selenium for the selenization process was placed under the precursor sample jig. The SeS2 addition method for the sulfo-selenization process was the same as that for the selenization process. To provide sufficient Se vapour and prevent severe decomposition of the CZTSSe films, the selenization processes were carried out in an Ar-filled furnace at 1 atm. A relief valve was attached to the end of the furnace to maintain the system pressure at slightly above 1.2 atm regardless of the furnace temperature. Before the annealing process, the halogen furnace was evacuated to a low 10−3 torr pressure to remove moisture and impurities. Then, Ar gas was introduced into the furnace, and the pressure was allowed to reach atmospheric pressure. Then, the heat treatment process was carried out, and the detailed heat treatment profile will be described in the results section. To fabricate solar cells, the obtained absorber layers were covered with a 50 nm-thick CdS buffer layer by chemical bath deposition (see S1†). Then, a 50 nm intrinsic ZnO layer and a 300 nm Al-doped ZnO layer were deposited by RF sputtering. Finally, a 1 μm Al collection grid was deposited on top of the device by thermal evaporation.
The samples were characterized by means of a solar simulator, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometry, depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy, and capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements of the charge density (NCV). The I–V characteristics were measured under a simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) spectrum and 100 mW cm−2 illumination (1 sun) using a solar simulator (Newport Co., model 94022A). The EQE values were obtained using an SR 830 DSP lock-in amplifier system (McScience Co.). ICP emission spectrometry (Shimadzu Co., model ICPS-8100) and STEM-EDS (Bruker Co., model QUANTAX-200) measurements were performed to analyse the compositions of the films. Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using the 632.8 nm line of a He–Ne laser as the excitation source. The C–V characteristics (Keysight Agilent, model E4980) were measured using 50 mV and 100 kHz AC excitation with a DC bias from −4.5 V to 0 V.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Growth of CZTSSe thin films by the selenization annealing process
In our previous work, we reported the growth of large-grained CZTSSe thin films using a fully sealed tube furnace with a SiC heating element.12 The fabricated CZTSSe thin films could be successfully produced in our previous work by vapour-phase selenization of stacked precursors prepared by sequential vacuum sputtering deposition of Cu, SnS and ZnS. In this paper, we introduced a halogen furnace with a square quartz system. For large-area chalcogenization, we changed our thermal treatment system from a cylinder-type tube furnace to a square and planar-type rapid thermal processing (RTP) system, and we developed a new base process for obtaining highly crystalline CZTSSe films without voids and a double layer in the absorber layer. Ensuring the heating profile in the selenization process, which causes volume expansion of the film from the sputtered precursor, is important. A K-type thermocouple was attached outside the chamber, and heat was applied by a PID controller. When the temperature was controlled through an external thermocouple, the actual internal temperature of the chamber was different, so the internal temperature was measured at the same time. The externally applied thermal profile in the selenization process and the actual internal temperature measured at this time are shown in Fig. 1. The surface of the K-type thermocouple could be easily selenized, so it was attached to the outside to improve the heat treatment reproducibility.

To understand the reaction paths and the CZTSSe film formation in our annealing process with metal and sulfur compound precursors, monitoring the phase changes at different annealing times is important. To confirm the formation of CZTSSe films with selenization, the films were analysed with XRD. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of precursor films and films selenized at 250 °C, 350 °C, 380 °C, 420 °C, 470 °C, 510 °C, 550 °C, 570 °C, 580 °C and 590 °C, showing the progression of CZTSSe formation through different phases with increasing temperature. All samples were cooled down immediately after reaching a specific annealing temperature. The XRD-analysed thin film samples were prepared under the same conditions as those of the SEM-analysed samples. At 250 °C, peak positions corresponding to Cu (111), SnS (021, 111, 311/131) and ZnS (111) phases in the same crystal form as the precursor were observed. The ZnS (111) and Cu (111) crystal phases were retained at 330 °C, but the SnS layer showed a SnSe ((111), (400)) crystal phase. In addition, the peak intensity of the ZnS layer increased at 330 °C compared to that at 250 °C, but the intensity of the Cu (111) peak decreased. The intensity of the SnSe (111) peak is greater than that of the (400) peak at 380 °C, and the intensity of the Cu (111) peak at 380 °C is smaller than that at lower temperatures. When the selenization temperature increased to 420 °C, a crystal phase change was evident, as the Cu- and Sn-related elements in the upper layer readily reacted. However, due to the overlap of the crystal peaks, the 27° to 29° 2θ region was difficult to distinguish. The secondary phases of Cu2SnSe3 and SnSe2 have the same underlying structures as CZTSe, and these phases usually cannot be distinguished from CZTSe by XRD.18 During annealing from 420 to 470 °C, the Cu2SnSe3, CZTSe, CZTS, SnSe2 and other 2θ peaks at approximately 27°–29° could not be easily distinguished, as they overlapped. Although ascertaining the presence of CZTSe or Cu2SnSe3 is difficult for annealing temperatures from 470 to 580 °C, the formation of the CZTSSe phase is clearly evidenced by the decreased intensity of the ZnS phase peak. At 590 °C, the main CZTSSe peak increased in intensity, and MoSe2 formation in the Mo films and CZTSe/Mo films during the selenization process was observed. To clarify and corroborate the phases present in these layers, Raman microprobe measurements were performed on the surface of the absorbers. Raman scattering is a useful technique complementary to XRD for identifying secondary phases, such as Cu2SnSe3, ZnS or SnS.19Fig. 3 shows a series of Raman spectra measured with a 632.8 nm (red laser) excitation wavelength of the films selenized at different temperatures. When the annealing temperature reached 250 °C, peaks corresponding to SnS were observed at 95, 101 and 164 cm−1.20,21 The Raman peaks at 95 and 166 cm−1 were assigned to the Ag and B3g modes, respectively. During annealing from 330 to 380 °C, the films showed modes at approximately 69 and 145 cm−1, assigned to SnS.20 The Raman peak at 145 cm−1 was assigned to the B2u mode. Intense Raman shifts at approximately 108 and 130 cm−1 were observed for SnSe.20 The well-defined peak appearing at 108 cm−1 could be assigned to the B3g mode; however, the peak at 130 cm−1 was related to the Ag mode. At 420 °C, in agreement with the XRD measurements, CuSe was detected by Raman scattering, with a dominant peak at 264 cm−1 and a peak corresponding to Cu2SnSe3 observed at 178 cm−1.22 Additionally, the peak at approximately 218 cm−1 could be assigned to Cu2Sn3S7.23 At 470 °C, the SnSe, SnSe2 and Cu2SnSe3 phases persisted, and the CuSe peaks no longer appeared. During annealing from 470 to 550 °C, the SnSe (peak at 71 cm−1), SnSe2/SnS (peak at 218 cm−1), and Cu2SnSe3/Cu3SnS4 (peak at 348 cm−1) phases were observed.20,22,23 For the sample annealed at 570 °C, the Raman peaks of the film could be assigned to CZTSe and CZTS. The formation of the CZTSe and CZTS phases, products from the reaction between Cu2SnSe3/Cu3SnS4 and ZnS or SnSe2 in the presence of liquid Se, which occurs at a high temperature, on the surface of the absorber began at 570 °C. At 580 °C, the main phase detected was CZTSe. The high-temperature range (∼580 °C) where CZTSe formation begins could be clearly detected. From the XRD and Raman results, it is found that the annealing temperature should be above 590 °C to obtain high-quality CZTSSe films.
 Fig. 2  XRD spectra of samples selenized at temperatures of 250–590 °C. Above 300 °C, the reaction with the vapourized Se begins, and a rapid reaction starts at 420 °C, indicating that CTS and CZTSe phases are obtained above 500 °C.

Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CZTSSe thin films selenized at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. Surface SEM images of the CZTSe thin films selenized at different temperatures can be seen in S2.† The SEM-analysed thin-film samples were prepared under the same conditions as those of the XRD- and Raman-analysed samples. XRD and Raman analysis can indirectly identify the CZTSe reaction pathway observed in the SEM images. When the selenization temperature was increased to 350 °C, the Cu and SnS thin film layer reacted with vapourized Se, resulting in a slight increase in the thickness. However, the bottom ZnS layer was relatively stable at this temperature. During annealing from 380 to 420 °C, a phase change in the thin film over ZnS was clearly observed, and the ZnS layer was confirmed to not participate in the reaction even in this temperature range. At 470 °C, significant expansion of the thin-film layer on the ZnS layer was observed, and some ZnS layers were found to participate in the reaction with the upper thin-film layer. The grain crystallinity in the upper region at 510 °C was better than that at 470 °C, and the phase of the intermediate layer formed by the reaction with ZnS was confirmed. At 550 °C, the lower ZnS layer participated in the reaction and disappeared, and the absorber layer was divided into two parts up to 570 °C. This phenomenon was caused by the presence of a Zn-deficient CTSSe phase in the upper part and a Zn-rich CZTSSe phase in the lower part, both of which were confirmed by XRD and Raman analysis. When the temperature increased to 580 and 590 °C, ZnS (or ZnSSe) and CTSSe were sufficiently reacted that a single CZTSSe grain formed. In the CZTSSe thin film fabricated using ZnS and SnS, no voids were found between the film and the Mo back electrode layer, and an absorber layer with a large grain size grew.

It can be confirmed that the reaction is active at the upper part of the temperature range from 380 °C to 550 °C. The ZnS thin film on the Mo layer does not participate in the reaction up to 420 °C and remains stable. At 580 °C, the CZTSe absorption layer was formed by the combination of the Cu, SnS and ZnS layers in the precursor with Se. 
In summary, Cu, SnS and ZnS are the main metallic and binary sulfide phases present in the precursors, and all of them are present at 250 °C. SnS and SnSe are clearly observed up to 330 °C, whereas CuSe appears at 420 °C. Then, the CuSe phase reacts with SnSe or SnSe2 to form the Cu2SnSe3/Cu3SnS4 phase. Consequently, the upper part of the film and the regions with Cu2SnSe3/Cu3SnS4 phase formation can reach a Cu-rich state. The CuSe layer is gradually consumed, and Cu2SnSe3/Cu3SnS4 reacts with ZnS during the annealing process. A formation mechanism for CZTSe/CZTS with binary selenide phases as intermediate precursors is proposed. Cross-sectional SEM images reveal the detailed reaction process and phase change mechanism during selenization of metal and metal-sulfide precursors. Based on the Raman, XRD and SEM analyses, the following thermodynamic reaction mechanism is predicted for the formation of the metal-sulfide precursor.SnS + Se → SnS + SnSe (∼380 °C)Cu + SnS + SnSe + Se → CuXSnSeY/CuSnS + CuSe + SnSe/SnSe (∼420 °C)CuSnSe/CuSnS + CuSe + SnSe/SnSe2 + ZnS + Se → CuSnSe/CuSnS + CZTSSe + SnSe2 (∼550 °C)CuSnSe/CuSnS7+ SnSe2 + ZnS + Se → CuSnSe + CZTSSe (∼580 °C)CuSnSe + ZnS + SnSe2 + Se → CZTSSe (∼590 °C)
The growth of CZTSSe crystals from the sulfide compound precursors, except for Cu, is found to be caused by the reaction of CZTSSe with the ZnS layer after the selenization of the Cu and SnS layers and the growth of CTS and CTSe.
3.2 Fabrication of CZTSSe thin films by the sulfo-selenization annealing process
We used the optimized heating profile in our selenization process to control the composition of S/(S + Se) in the absorber layer. That is, the sulfo-selenization annealing process was performed under the optimum heating profile in Fig. 1 and atmospheric pressure, as determined from the pure selenization process. However, unlike the pure selenization process, the sulfo-selenization process involved the addition of SeS2 powder. To verify the predicted dependence of the chalcogen composition, we developed a single-step sulfo-selenization procedure to prepare CZTSSe thin films. Table 1 shows the masses of Se and SeS2 used and the ICP composition ratios of the CZTSSe thin films prepared according to the experimental conditions. The names of the CZTSSe thin film samples were each defined as the percent by weight ratio (SeS2/Se) of the chalcogen sources used in the heat treatment process. The chemical compositions of the CZTSSe thin films were controlled so that they were Cu poor and Zn rich. In addition, the composition ratio of chalcogen atoms in the CZTSSe films varied from 0.074 to 0.524. For the films sulfo-selenized at 590 °C, the S/(S + Se) ratio showed an almost linear dependence on the ratio of the chalcogen sources. The S/(S + Se) chemical composition increased abnormally with increasing SeS2 source content because the sulfur reaction easily occurred and involved the Mo(S, Se)2 material in the back electrode layer.

Fig. 5 shows the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the samples obtained with various chalcogen source ratios. The films were approximately 1.2 μm thick, showed large micron-sized grains, and were dense and pin-hole free. Interestingly, the morphology in the top-view images changed with increasing SeS2 source content. Among the different samples, the fabricated CZTSSe films in which the SeS2 source was not injected during the sulfo-selenization process (CZTSSe-0) showed the smoothest surface morphology. The surface morphology became rougher and less regular with increasing sulfur in the CZTSSe films. Based on the morphological study, the surface morphology of the CZTSSe thin film is strongly dependent on the chalcogen sources in the post-annealing treatment. The Mo back contact layer was approximately 300 nm thick, with approximately 500 nm of Mo(S, Se)2 formed at the interface with CZTSSe during the sulfo-selenization thermal process. A thick Mo(S, Se)2 layer was generally formed due to the necessary high-temperature annealing process and Se pressure.
 Fig. 5  SEM images of the top and cross-sections of the various CZTSSe samples: (a) CZTSSe-0, (b) CZTSSe-0.2, (c) CZTSSe-0.4 and (d) CZTSSe-0.6. The CZTSSe thin films show different surface shapes depending on the S/(S + Se) ratio. 
To evaluate the chalcogen ratio in the grown films and evaluate which phases are present, XRD measurements were performed, and the diffractograms are presented in Fig. 6. All fabricated CZTSSe films clearly showed the presence of a Mo layer (not shown here). The selenized and sulfo-selenized films also possessed a pure kesterite structure without any impurity phases. The 2θ-angle range from approximately 27.3° to 27.7° (Fig. 5(a)) showed that the (112) peak of the CZTSSe films shifted towards higher angles as the relative S/(S + Se) content increased. With increasing relative S/(S + Se) content, the 2θ values of the major peaks corresponding to the (112), (220)/(204), and (312)/(116) planes shifted to higher angles due to the smaller unit cell lattice parameters of CZTSSe with Se sufficiently replaced by S.24 This result was attributed to the reduction in the unit cell volume by the partial replacement of Se with S. In addition, some minor peaks, such as (110), (103), (211), and (400)/(008), were observed after the annealing process, demonstrating that the CZTSSe thin films have good crystallinity (not shown here). In the case of the selenized CZTSSe film, the 2θ values of the major peaks of Mo(S, Se)2 were also shifted to higher angles due to the larger unit cell lattice parameters of CZTSSe with Se sufficiently replaced by S.

To investigate the influence of S/(S + Se) on the presence of CZTSe and CZTS phases, a series of Raman measurements were performed on all fabricated CZTSSe films. Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of these samples measured with a 532 nm excitation wavelength. No evidence of the formation of Zn–(S, Se), Sn–(S, Se) or Cu–(S, Se) secondary phases was found on the surface of the films. Among all fabricated CZTSSe films, the strongest Raman peaks presented typical two-mode behaviour (189 cm−1 for the CZTSe mode and 338 cm−1 for the CZTS mode), and generally, the peaks of both modes shifted to higher frequencies with increasing content of lighter sulfur atoms. When sulfur atoms partially substitute for Se atoms, the lattice constants of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 samples shrink gradually, and the bond lengths are shortened.25 The shift in the A1 peak for CZTSe was larger than that for CZTS, which was caused by the difference in force constant between CZTS and CZTSe. A series of peaks occurred at approximately 189–211 cm−1 when 0 < x < 1, and their relative intensities obviously increased with increasing Se content. The Raman peaks at 323–338 cm−1 also broadened with increasing Se content. Based on the above results, by using an appropriate SeS2/S ratio, the S/(S + Se) ratio of the thin film can be controlled, and phase changes in the thin film can be observed. Adjustment of the S/(S + Se) ratio in the thin film is one of the factors affecting efficiency because it leads to a bandgap change of the CZTSSe thin film.
 Fig. 7  Raman results of the various CZTSSe samples: CZTSSe-0, CZTSSe-0.2, CZTSSe-0.4 and CZTSSe-0.6. The Raman results also show that the CZTSe peak shift and the CZTS peak intensity are different depending on the S/(S + Se) ratio. 
3.3 Electrical characteristics of CZTSSe thin film solar cells

Table 2 lists the current density–voltage (J–V) parameters for each solar cell (with a 0.185 cm2 device area without an antireflection (AR) coating) based on CZTSSe films grown in the annealing process. Their properties showed a clear dependence on the annealing process conditions. As the amount of SeS2 used in the sulfo-selenization process was increased, the open voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) were improved, but the short-circuit current (JSC) was lowered. This result implies that optimized control of S/Se in the photoabsorption layer is required to produce a high-efficiency CZTS solar cell.

Table 3 shows the J–V parameters of the best-performing samples obtained from the sulfo-selenization processes. Solar cell CZTSSe-0.4 showed the best efficiency of 9.47%, with a VOC of 434 mV, a JSC of 32.79 mA cm−2 and an FF of 66.23%. Similar to the statistical data, as the amount of SeS2 increased, VOC increased, and JSC decreased. Furthermore, the electrical parameters were extracted by fitting the J–V curves according to the diode model, as described in previous reports.26Fig. 8 shows the dark and illuminated J–V curves of the best-performing devices. For the highest efficiency devices fabricated through the sulfo-selenization process, the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current showed opposite relations with the S/Se ratio in the CZTSSe thin film. As indicated by the semilog dark J–V curve plotted in Fig. 8(a), the reverse saturation current density depends on the sulfur content in the absorber layer, and S/Se composition control is necessary to fabricate a diode device with excellent characteristics. In addition, the forward current characteristics of all CZTSSe diode devices were divided into a majority charge carrier-depleted space charge region and a quasi-neutral region. From the linearly plotted dark and illuminated J–V curves in Fig. 8(b), the crossover phenomenon of the dark and illuminated J–V curves could be seen for all CZTSSe devices. In the CZTSSe devices, the current densities at the crossover point for CZTSSe-0, CZTSSe-0.2, CZTSSe-0.4 and CZTSSe-0.6 were ∼15, ∼4, ∼19 and ∼8 mA cm−2, respectively. In the highest efficiency device based on CZTSSe-0.4, the current density at the crossover point was the highest, but the crossover point of the CZTSSe-0 device with the lowest efficiency and lowest FF value was higher than those of CZTSSe-0.2 and CZTSSe-0.6. The crossover phenomenon is reported to be attributable to absorber/buffer interface properties associated with high-density defect states, which are present in the absorber layer close to the heterointerface (p + layer), in the CdS buffer layer (photoconductivity of the CdS buffer layer) or at the CdS/ZnO interface.27,28 Another aspect is that the FF and crossover point are related to the high resistivity of the MoS(Se)2 nonohmic back contact barrier or the CZTSSe absorber layer present at the Mo/CZTSe interface.29 As the S content increases, the resistance of the back contact will increase, and thus, the crossover phenomenon will become apparent. However, the CZTSSe-0 device with the lowest S ratio in the absorber layer or MoS(Se)2 had the worst FF, but the current density for this device at the crossover point was higher than those of the CZTSSe-0.2 and CZTSSe-0.6 devices. Therefore, we think that this phenomenon is primarily related to the absorber/buffer layer interface properties. We will observe and explain the characteristics from this aspect in a later discussion.

 Fig. 8  (a) Semilogarithmic dark I–V behaviour and (b) dark & illuminated J–V characteristics of CZTSSe-0, CZTSSe-0.2, CZTSSe-0.4 and CZTSSe-0.6 solar cell devices. The control of the S/(S + Se) ratio in the thin film of the absorber layer is essential for the optimization of the characteristics of CZTSSe solar cell devices. 

Fig. 9 shows the EQE of the best solar cell fabricated with our CZTSSe films as a function of photon wavelength. The EQE spectrum at short wavelengths (below 500 nm) indicated similar absorption originating from the CdS/i-ZnO/AZO top layers. In the middle wavelength part, the lowest EQE was observed in the CZTSSe-0.6 device with the highest S ratio and the lowest JSC. The extension of the EQE spectra into the longer wavelength region was mainly due to the increase in the S/(S + Se) ratio. The bandgap values of the CZTSSe thin films were obtained by plotting dEQE/dλ. As expected, the bandgaps of the CZTSSe thin films increased linearly from 1.04 to 1.17 eV with increasing S/(S + Se) ratio.
 Fig. 9  EQE of CZTSSe-0, CZTSSe-0.2, CZTSSe-0.4 and CZTSSe-0.6 solar cell devices. We calculated their optical bandgaps by using the rear inflection of the EQE curves (the peak of the dEQE/dλ plot) near the band edges. 

Fig. 10 shows both types of C–V profiles for the four CZTSSe devices with varying bandgaps. For both types of profiles, the x-axis is the same: Wd = εrA/C, where Wd is the depletion width, C is the capacitance measured for each value of the DC bias, A is the total cell area and εr is the relative dielectric constant. Since the εr of CZTSSe thin films depends on their bandgap, the value extracted from εr was used according to the bandgap.30εr was approximately 8.3, 8.1, 8 and 7.8 for CZTSSe-0, CZTSSe-0.2, CZTSSe-0.4 and CZTSSe-0.6, respectively. We extracted the carrier density NCV and estimated Wd values from the C–V profiles. Devices with a carrier density greater than 1017 cm−3 showed Wd values less than 100 nm. CZTSSe-0.4, which had the lowest carrier density among the CZTSSe samples, showed the longest Wd. A long Wd will promote the efficiency because it can enable the generation of more photogenerated carriers.31 To obtain CZTSSe solar cells with high efficiency, bandgap control is essential, and the S/Se ratio must be optimized. These results are consistent with those from previous reports on changes in the CZTSSe efficiency with the S/Se ratio.5,32,33

4. Conclusions
We carried out detailed studies on the crystal growth mechanism of CZTSSe films prepared from sputter-deposited metal and compound precursors and on the possibility of obtaining CZTSSe films with a wide range of S/(S + Se) compositions using a single-step sulfo-selenization annealing process. The selenization temperature has a strong influence on the phase and reactions of the elements in the films. The formation of CZTSSe is initially triggered by the interaction of Cu with Sn(S, Se) to form CuSn(S, Se) compounds, which then react with ZnS. The CZTSSe films obtained at 580 °C exhibit a kesterite structure. We also fabricated CZTSSe thin films and devices with varying S/(S + Se) compositions by adding SeS2 powder in an optimized selenization process. In the sulfo-selenization process, sulfurization easily occurs with a small amount of sulfur, so optimization of the chalcogen sources used in the process is essential. SeS2 has an advantage over S in bandgap control because it is less reactive than S and can further suppress the sulfurization of the film. We fabricated CZTSSe thin films and devices with controlled S/(S + Se) ratios by controlling the amount of SeS2. We obtained a device efficiency of 9.47% through the fabrication of a bandgap-tuned thin film and examined the changes in the characteristics with S/(S + Se). This study confirmed that the S/(S + Se) ratio in the film can be easily controlled by controlling the chalcogen sources. For higher efficiency, S and Se appear to be required to fabricate CZTSSe thin films with different depth distributions. If the S and Se sources are controlled according to the time conditions, then the depth distribution of the S/Se ratio of the absorber layer is expected to be adjustable.
