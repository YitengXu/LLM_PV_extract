    , Accepted 31st July 2020First published on 1st August 2020AbstractThe use of non-halogenated solvents is one of the important requirements for large-scale industry production of polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, the current high-performance PSCs are mostly obtained using halogenated solvents to ensure good solubility and morphology. In this work, we report high-performance PSCs processed using a halogen-free solvent (toluene), reaching an efficiency of 17.33%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value reported for PSCs processed from non-halogenated solvents. Importantly, we show a novel aggregation or “aging” process of the non-fullerene acceptor in the toluene solvent, which can be used to fine-tune the crystal size of the non-fullerene acceptor. As a result, we achieve an optimized nano-fibril like morphology of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl by delaying the processing time. This is conducive to charge dissociation and transport, and thus greatly improved device performance. This method is expected to be investigated further and applied to other PSC systems toward precise morphology optimization and performance improvements in the future.

Broader context
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable research interest over the past decades. The recently emerging nonfullerene acceptor-based polymer solar cells have pushed OPVs’ development on a new journey. However, current polymer solar cells with cutting-edge performances are fabricated commonly by using halogenated solvents. These halogenated solvents are detrimental to human health and the environment, and are not adaptable for industrial application. Meanwhile, the application of halogen-free solvents is obstructed by their limited solubility, which makes it difficult for them to fulfill the ideal morphology control requirement. In this work, we report a smart morphology optimization strategy – delayed processing using a non-halogenated solvent – for realizing high-performance nonfullerene polymer solar cells. By simply controlling the delayed processing time, we realized the optimization of the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend morphology. The fine-tuned nano fibril-like interpenetrating networks were conducive to more efficient charge separation and transport, which successfully boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 15.69% to 17.33%.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) based polymer solar cells (PSCs) owing to their facile synthesis, easily tunable optoelectronic properties and strong absorption reaching the near infrared (NIR) region.1,2 State-of-the-art NFAs have boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs over 16%.3–15 The efficiency is sufficiently high, but there are other requirements for industry production, such as solvents.16–18 Note that the current high-performance PSCs are mostly obtained using halogenated solvents, e.g. chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB), to ensure good solubility and morphology.2–13,19 However, these halogenated solvents are detrimental to human health and the environment, and are not adaptable for industry production.18,20,21 Meanwhile, the application of halogen-free solvents is also obstructed by their limited solubility, which makes it difficult for them to fulfill the ideal morphology control requirement. To optimize the morphology, a few post-treatment strategies have been implemented, such as solvent vapor annealing (SVA),9,22 thermal annealing (TA),23–25 hot spin-coating,26–28etc. These processing strategies rely on kinetically trapping the fine-tuned phase separation via fast evaporation of the processing solvent,29,30 and are sensitive to small variations and lack desirable repeatability from lab-scale small-area devices to industrial large-area solar cell panels.29 Therefore, developing high-performance PSCs which can be processed using halogen-free solvents and industrially accessible morphology optimization methods is of great significance for future industrial applications.
With respect to the halogen-free solvent solubility and processability, a feasible way is introducing bulky side groups or longer alkyl chains onto the conjugated skeleton of organic/polymeric semiconductors.31–34 However, the molecular packing, blend miscibility and phase separation, as well as the optoelectronic properties, will also be impacted. In most cases, these influences are difficult to anticipate.5,35 A general design rule is to introduce appropriate alkyl chains to get a “precisely suitable” solubility of organic semiconductors while maintaining a high density of chromophores.19,36,37 This is crucial to balance the solution processability and charge transport as well as other properties. At present, a PM6:Y6-based device represents the most efficient candidate in PSCs.1,25PM6 has good solvent tolerance and can be processed using many common solvents, such as CB, CF, toluene (Tol), etc. In contrast, Y6 and its derivatives are more sensitive to the processing solvent. The initial Y6 developed by the Zou group could perform well from CF solutions.25 Hou et al. conducted systematic research on the side chain engineering of Y6-series NFAs.12,37,38 They demonstrated that the length of the alkyl chains on both the pyrrole rings and the edge of the dithieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-e:2′,3′-g][2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (BTP) core had a great impact on the molecular aggregation and blend morphology and thereafter the device performances. Among these NFAs, BTP-BO-4Cl with 2-bultyloctyl (BO) on the pyrrole rings and undecyl (eC11) on the edge of the BTP group not only had good solubility in CB and CF, but also could be fully dissolved in warm Tol (>50 °C). This solubility affords an opportunity to fabricate BTP-BO-4Cl-based PSCs using halogen-free Tol as the processing solvent.
In this work, we attempted to develop halogen-free solvent processed high-performance PSCs using recently prevailing donor and acceptor materials. As shown in Fig. 1a, PM6 and BTP-BO-4Cl were selected as the donor and acceptor, respectively, for their potential high device performance and halogen-free solvent solubility. In addition, benzyl viologen (BV) was introduced instead of halogenated additives, which served as a microstructure modifier to optimize and stabilize the morphology and as an n-type dopant to improve the electron transport in PSCs.10 Interestingly, we found that BTP-BO-4Cl had good solubility in CB, but it was sensitive to temperature when dissolved in Tol. The PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend was readily dissolved in warm Tol (>50 °C), but BTP-BO-4Cl would crystallize gradually and even precipitate finally by delaying the processing time under ambient temperature. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, preaggregation could be performed before active layer deposition, and the degree could be controlled straightforwardly by varying the delay time before processing. Excitingly, such a solvent delay processing method fine-tuned the phase separation as expected. The optimized interpenetrating networks contributed to efficient charge separation and transport, which successfully elevated the PCE from 15.69% up to 17.33%. To our best knowledge, 17.33% is a new record for PSCs processed using halogen-free solvents so far. Importantly, such a strategy can be further applied to other efficient PSC systems towards precise morphology optimization and performance improvements in the future.

The effects of different solvents on the molecular packing of neat PM6 and BTP-BO-4Cl were examined first by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements (Fig. 2). All the pristine films were processed from their respective solutions immediately on top of a silicon wafer as the solutions cooled to room temperature. PM6 processed using CB exhibited strong (100) diffraction predominantly in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction with a semicircle at q = 0.30 Å−1. These observations suggested that preferred edge-on packing with some extended face-on packing coexisted in such conditions. Using Tol instead of CB as the processing solvent, the (100) diffraction decreased in the IP direction but enhanced in the OOP direction, while a reverse variation trend of the (010) diffraction (q = 1.71–1.73 Å−1) was observed (Fig. 2e and Fig. S1, ESI†). That meant that Tol induced a further enhanced edge-on packing fraction of PM6 in the pristine film. BTP-BO-4Cl processed from CB displayed relatively moderate (100) diffraction in the IP direction (qxy = 0.40 Å−1) with a weak peak tail towards the OOP direction, where a small diffraction peak (qz = 0.54 Å−1) was observed. In addition, strong and broad (010) diffraction (qz = 1.2–2.5 Å−1) with a peak at qz = 1.80 Å−1 was observed, which suggested that polymer-like extended crystal transport channels might form in the BTP-BO-4Cl film.23 Compared to the CB processed film, BTP-BO-4Cl processed from Tol exhibited many diffraction spots due to the formation of well-packed crystallites. This was mainly because BTP-BO-4Cl had limited solubility in Tol, especially in concentrated solution (the GIWAXS sample was prepared from a Tol solution with a concentration of ∼25 mg mL−1). Meanwhile, much stronger diffraction at qz = 0.54 Å−1 was observed in the Tol processed BTP-BO-4Cl film, suggesting different packing properties from the CB prepared film (Fig. 2e and Fig. S2, ESI†). These observations clearly demonstrated that both the polymer and acceptor packing properties were sensitive to the solvent. Regardless of that, both the polymer and acceptor had almost comparable high crystallinity to those prepared from CB solution, which was conductive to efficient charge transport.

To further study the solvent effect on the molecular packing, droplet contact angles on the neat PM6 and BTP-BO-4Cl films were measured by using water and ethylene glycol (EG) as the wetting liquids (Fig. 2f and Table S1, ESI†). The water contact angle (θwater) and EG contact angle (θEG) of PM6 processed using CB and Tol exhibited minimal changes (within 0.5°). The slightly increased θwater and reduced θEG of the Tol processed PM6 film might originate from the increased edge-on packing, where the top-surface was covered by more hydrophobic alkyl chains. In contrast, the BTP-BO-4Cl processed from Tol displayed an obviously increased θwater over 2° and a slightly increased θEG of 0.15°. These might be due to the crystallites with uneven sizes, which created an extremely rough top surface (vide infra), thus increasing the hydrophobicity. Based on the droplet angles, the surface energies (γ) were calculated to be 18.15 and 17.92 mN m−1 for PM6 deposited from CB and Tol, which were also found to be 24.07 and 25.71 mN m−1 for BTP-BO-4Cl deposited from CB and Tol, respectively. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χdonor–acceptor was used to evaluate the miscibility between the donor and acceptor, which could be calculated using the following empirical eqn (1)39 (1)where K is a positive constant, and γdonor and γaceeptor are the respective surface energies of the donor and acceptor materials. The calculated χdonor–acceptor increased from 0.42 K for the CB processed samples to 0.70 K for the Tol processed samples, suggesting that the donor and acceptor preferred to phase separate when using Tol instead of CB as the processing solvent.
To investigate the different solvent effects on the photovoltaic performances, PSCs with a conventional device structure were fabricated (Fig. 1c). CB and Tol solutions of the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend with the BV additive were fully dissolved at 60 °C prior to use. Then, the solutions were cooled to room temperature (∼25 °C) and were allowed to delay for different times before spin-coating on glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) substrates. More detailed fabrication procedures are presented in the ESI.† Without delaying the processing time of the active blend film, the devices processed using CB achieved a moderate PCE of 15.63%, with a Voc of 0.846 V, a Jsc of 25.24 mA cm−2 and an FF of 73.2% (Fig. S3 and Table S2, ESI†). The Tol processed devices achieved a lower PCE of 14.75%, owing to the lower Jsc of 24.98 mA cm−2 and FF of 69.7%. By adding a trace amount of BV (0.4 wt‰) as the additive, the PCEs were improved significantly to 16.77% and 15.69% for the CB and Tol processed devices, respectively. The significantly increased Jsc and FF values were responsible for their performance improvements. The delayed processing treatment exhibited no obvious impact on the CB processed devices (Fig. S4 and Table S3, ESI†). In contrast, a distinct delayed processing time dependent performance change was observed for the Tol processed devices (Fig. 3 and Table 1). After delaying for 20 min, Jsc increased from 25.41 to 25.87 mA cm−2 and the FF increased from 72.8% to 75.7%, thus improving the PCE to 16.51%. After delaying for 40 min, Jsc and the FF increased further to 26.10 mA cm−2 and 77.7%, respectively, which successfully boosted the PCE up to 17.33%. Meanwhile a longer delayed processing time would lead to a dramatic decrease of the device performance. A quite poor PCE of 12.59% was obtained with a sharply decreased Jsc of 22.96 mA cm−2 and FF of 64.5% after 100 min of delayed processing. Therefore, the delayed processing time played a key role in optimizing the performance of the above Tol processed devices.

The effects of solvent types and delayed processing times on the photovoltaic performances were investigated by UV-vis-NIR absorption. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), both the CB and Tol coated PM6 films showed absorption independent of the delayed processing, suggesting the adequate solubility of PM6 in these two solvents at room temperature. However, the PM6 films cast from CB exhibited slightly redshifted absorption with stronger peak shoulders compared to those cast from Tol. This was because CB had better solubility and a higher boiling point than Tol, providing much more sufficient time for molecular organization during the film deposition. In contrast to the good solubility of PM6 in the above two solvents, BTP-BO-4Cl was able to be fully dissolved in CB but partially dissolved in Tol at room temperature. Therefore, the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend films cast from CB after different delay times kept identical absorption profiles (Fig. S5b, ESI†), whereas the Tol processed films exhibited obviously enhanced absorbance in the range of 700–900 nm with increasing the delayed processing time to 40 min, which was caused by the aggregation of BTP-BO-4Cl (Fig. 1d). On further delaying the processing time up to 100 min, significantly decreased absorbance was observed. This delayed processing time dependent absorption property suggested that BTP-BO-4Cl tended to accumulate gradually in Tol solution because of the limited solubility. The preaggregation contributed to the more ordered packing in the film state and improved the absorbance. However, if the delayed processing time was too long (over 40 min), nanoscale preaggregation would serve as the nuclei for further crystal growth, forming microscale BTP-BO-4Cl clusters (vide infra). The homogeneous distribution of BTP-BO-4Cl was crucial for effective light harvesting. However, the BTP-BO-4Cl amount in the homogeneous blend was exhausted gradually by the growth of large BTP-BO-4Cl clusters, thus resulting in largely decreased absorbance.
The delayed processing effects on the molecular packing in blend films were studied by GIWAXS measurements (Fig. 4 and Fig. S6, ESI†). In the Tol processed films, the strong diffraction peak at qxy = 0.31 Å−1 and weak shoulder peak at qxy = 0.39 Å−1 in the IP direction belonged to the (100) diffraction of PM6 and BTP-BO-4Cl, respectively. On the other hand, the broad and strong diffraction peak at qz = 1.80 Å−1 in the OOP direction was induced by the ordered π–π stacking of BTP-BO-4Cl. These observations suggested the face-on packing of both the donor and acceptor. In the early stages of delayed processing (<80 min), the (100) diffraction of PM6 displayed minimal changes, demonstrating that the delayed processing had extraordinarily little effect on the molecular packing of PM6. In contrast, the (010) diffraction of BTP-BO-4Cl was much more sensitive to the delayed processing, and the film cast from 40 min aged Tol solution reached the highest diffraction intensity. On further increasing the delayed processing time, an obvious decrease could be observed. On the other hand, one more diffraction peak appeared at qz = 0.54 Å−1 in the OOP direction when the delayed processing time was increased up to 60 min, which could be observed in the pristine BTP-BO-4Cl film. The diffraction intensity strength decreased gradually with increasing the delayed processing time. For the film processed from 100 min delayed Tol solution, the (100) diffraction of PM6 was in the OOP direction, suggesting predominant edge-on packing, which was different from the other condition but similar to its pristine film. In addition, the (010) peak of BTP-BO-4Cl was weak and widely distributed in a large azimuthal angle range, implying that the crystal orientation was random.23 These observations demonstrated that the delayed processing promoted the aggregation of BTP-BO-4Cl for more ordered packing. A too long time of delayed processing would cause the formation of excessively accumulated crystallites, leading to the inhomogeneous distribution of BTP-BO-4Cl and decreased scattering intensity. In contrast to the Tol processed films, the CB processed films without or with a long time delay displayed no obvious diffraction change (Fig. S7, ESI†). Both the (100) diffraction of PM6 and the (010) diffraction of BTP-BO-4Cl exhibited smaller q values than those from the Tol processed films, suggesting longer packing distances (Fig. S7, ESI†). These results indicated that no significant preaggregation formed in CB solution. Moreover, the CB processed films had much stronger (100) diffraction intensity but weaker (010) diffraction intensity, indicating the more ordered packing of PM6 but less ordered packing of BTP-BO-4Cl than those of the Tol processed films. The molecular packing modulation enabled by delayed processing of Tol would have a significant influence on the charge transport properties and phase separation of the resulting PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blends.

The charge transport properties were studied by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S8 and Table S4, ESI†). The CB processed films showed quite close hole mobilities (μh) around 3.57–3.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobilities (μe) around 1.55–1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which were impervious to the delayed processing treatment. The Tol processed devices exhibited a slightly lower μh of 3.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 but a much lower μe of 0.97 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, leading to unbalanced charge transport. The delayed processing showed a positive effect on improving both the μh and μe values. After 40 min of delayed processing, μh and μe were improved to 5.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The highest and more balanced (μh/μe = 1.51) charge transport properties contributed to the significantly improved device performances. However, further increasing the delay time to 100 min would lead to a more dropped μe (0.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) than μh (4.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This was mainly due to the agglomeration of BTP-BO-4Cl, which caused the discontinuous distribution of acceptor domains in the blend film (vide infra).
To further understand the delayed processing effects on the photovoltaic performances, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed. The samples processed from CB solutions without delayed processing and with long time delayed processing were quite uniform, as observed from the optical microscope (an accessory of the AFM equipment) and AFM images (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). These films exhibited a quite close root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.92–1.96 nm. Nevertheless, relatively large nanofibrils throughout the blend could be clearly observed in both the AFM phase images (Fig. S10, ESI†) and TEM images (Fig. 5). The large nanofibrils should be templated by the PM6 organization during the film deposition of its CB solutions with better solubility and slower drying processes. Such a large phase separation would reduce the D/A interfaces, leading to inefficient charge separation, and thus moderate the device performance. The samples processed from Tol solutions displayed uniform images in the early delaying stages (within 40 min) but unceasingly agglomerated particles with long time delayed processing (over 60 min) (Fig. 5 and Fig. S9, S11, and S12, ESI†). According to the UV-vis-NIR absorption and GIWAXS experiments, these particles were BTP-BO-4Cl crystallites, suggesting that the delayed processing promoted the aggregation of BTP-BO-4Cl. The RMS values were 1.27, 1.35, 1.56, 1.67, 1.81, and 2.11 nm for the samples processed with 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 min delayed processing in Tol solutions, respectively. The preaggregation of BTP-BO-4Cl also promoted the phase separation of PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl films with intensified nanofibrils for efficient charge transport (Fig. 5). However, further agglomeration of BTP-BO-4Cl resulted in the growth of large particles, which exhausted its concentration in the mixed phase and gave insufficient D/A interfaces for charge separation. Among them, the 40 min delayed devices achieved balanced high crystallinity of the donor and acceptor. In such conditions, the presence of neither excessive polymer aggregation like the CB processed films nor oversize acceptor agglomeration like the longer time aged ones provided optimized phase separation for charge separation and transport, thus achieving the highest device performances.

To investigate the universal application potential of this delayed processing method in organic photovoltaics with other material systems, we employed IT-4F and Y6 as the electron acceptor, respectively, and paired with PM6 to fabricate PSCs. Excitingly, we also observed a delayed processing time dependent photovoltaic change in both IT-4F and Y6-based PSCs. We found that IT-4F-based devices were not very sensitive to the delay time. The PCE was slightly increased from 12.93% to 13.48% and then decreased to 12.63% if the delayed processing time was increased from 0 to 60 min and 120 min (Fig. S13 and Table S5, ESI†). Moreover, the PCEs could keep over 12% even delaying for 5 h. This might be due to the fact that IT-4F had relatively higher solubility and lower crystallinity than BTP-BO-4Cl in Tol. In contrast, Y6-based devices were extremely sensitive to the delay time (Fig. S14 and Table S5, ESI†). Without a delay, a poor PCE of 9.35% was achieved. After 3 min, the PCE was remarkably improved to 12.53%. Meanwhile, after 6 min the PCE was dramatically decreased to 10.07%. Although the delayed processing could improve the PCE of Y6-based devices, the performance processed by Tol was still much lower than those CF processed ones.25 These results were reasonable due to the much lower solubility of Y6 than BTP-BO-4Cl in Tol. Therefore, a precisely controlled suitable solubility would play a key role in tuning the delay time and morphology when employing this method. Regardless of that, our results demonstrated the universal application potential of this strategy.
In conclusion, we presented an exquisite aggregation control strategy using a halogen-free solvent that realized high-performance fullerene-free PSCs. Using halogen-free Tol as the processing solvent, the polymer donor of PM6 exhibited adequate solubility at room temperature, while the nonfullerene acceptor of BTP-BO-4Cl had a weak temperature-dependent aggregation behavior. This allowed for controlling the aggregation and crystallization of the blend films by just delaying the active blend processing at room temperature. After being delayed for 40 min, the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl films reached a near-ideal morphology, in which both the polymer donor and acceptor retained high crystallinity, yet with small domains. The optimized interpenetrating networks contributed to efficient charge separation and transport. As a result, a significantly improved PCE of 17.33% was achieved, which is a new record for PSCs processed using halogen free solvent so far. Importantly, such a strategy can be further investigated and applied to other efficient PSC systems towards precise morphology optimization and performance improvement.

Broader context
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable research interest over the past decades. The recently emerging nonfullerene acceptor-based polymer solar cells have pushed OPVs’ development on a new journey. However, current polymer solar cells with cutting-edge performances are fabricated commonly by using halogenated solvents. These halogenated solvents are detrimental to human health and the environment, and are not adaptable for industrial application. Meanwhile, the application of halogen-free solvents is obstructed by their limited solubility, which makes it difficult for them to fulfill the ideal morphology control requirement. In this work, we report a smart morphology optimization strategy – delayed processing using a non-halogenated solvent – for realizing high-performance nonfullerene polymer solar cells. By simply controlling the delayed processing time, we realized the optimization of the PM6:BTP-BO-4Cl blend morphology. The fine-tuned nano fibril-like interpenetrating networks were conducive to more efficient charge separation and transport, which successfully boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 15.69% to 17.33%.
