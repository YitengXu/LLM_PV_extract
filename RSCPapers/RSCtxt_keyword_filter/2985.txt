    , Accepted 22nd January 2020First published on 25th January 2020AbstractA successful application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) must face socioeconomic challenges such as lead poisoning. In this regard, Sn-based halide perovskite compounds, such as CsSnI3, have attracted tremendous attention as effective replacements to their counterparts. However, the current CsSnI3 PSCs are still plagued with the tough issues of low efficiency and chemical instability. Herein, for the first time, we present a chemical doping agent, namely, cobaltocene (denoted CoCp2) with a strong electron-donating ability as a stabilizer and an electrical property manipulator of the inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite for photovoltaic applications. A thermal-driven electron injection from CoCp2 into CsSnI3 maintains a reducing environment and thereby effectively suppresses Sn2+ oxidation (named after remote reduction), which can be confirmed by an increase in the density of states near the Fermi level and the emergence of the oxidized species, cobaltocenium (CoCp2+). Therefore, we have achieved an unprecedented efficiency of 3.0% under standard illumination test conditions in air for a perovskite solar cell using a mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon framework. We further noticed that without the remote reduction treatment, such devices produced negligible photovoltage and photocurrent. The incorporation of donor elements offers a novel and viable strategy to develop stable Sn-based inorganic PSCs with attractive properties for practical applications.
Introduction
Solar cells based on organic–inorganic lead hybrid perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbI3, have achieved significant and remarkable progress in the past several years.1–6 However, the toxicity of lead (Pb), widely used in high-efficiency PSCs, remains a serious issue that hinders the application of this “wonder” material. Substituting Pb with environmentally benign elements without sacrificing its fantastic properties could greatly increase its potential for practical production.7,8 For example, the inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite is a promising option due to its high structure or electron dimensionality,9 relatively high intrinsic or thermodynamic stability,10 small bandgap (about 1.3 eV) combined with high optical absorption coefficient and low exciton binding energy.11–15 Unfortunately, the power conversion record of the CsSnI3-based solar cells has been maintained at about 4.8% during the 2 year development,16 representing a large room for further improvement in the performance.
The performance of CsSnI3 PSCs suffers from a high defect density (that is, Sn vacancies) in the bulk and surfaces of the CsSnI3 perovskite due to the fast oxidation of divalent Sn2+ into tetravalent Sn4+.17 Considering the law of electroneutrality, the electronic states in the band gap of the CsSnI3 perovskite can serve as sources of carriers and necessarily affect all defect concentrations. Together with the law of mass-action, the electrons (n) in the conduction band per volume and the holes (p) in the valence band per volume may not be equal as they typically are in an intrinsic material. Some of the experimental observations indicate that the minority carrier concentration for CsSnI3, i.e. electron carrier concentration, is about 107 cm−3.18 This implies that the typical average intrinsic doped carrier concentration in CsSnI3 films without treatments should be about 1019 cm−3, according to the mass action law. Such heavy intrinsic doping would greatly reduce the mobility and lifetime of the minority carrier, and eventually deteriorate the perovskite structure, semiconducting behavior and device performance.18,19 As an additive, SnF2 has been applied to successfully limit the metallic behavior of Sn-based perovskites into a relatively mild self-doping state.20,21 Similarly, other tin halides (such as SnI2,16,22,23 SnCl214 and SnBr215) were proposed to decrease the density of the Sn vacancy by increasing the chemical potential of Sn. Likewise, strong antioxidants (like hydrazine,24 hypophosphorous acid25 and triphenyl phosphite26) were introduced during the perovskite film processing procedure, which have also shown a positive effect in enhancing the material performance. Recently, a so-called hollow 3D{en}CsSnI3 was reported with significant improvement in film morphology and reduction in trap density.27 However, these methods have failed to completely retard the oxidation of Sn2+ and brought additional issues, such as phase separation and high toxicity of strong reducing agents.28
Actually, even though the harsh demand for crystal growth conditions can be satisfied, Sn4+ already forms in the precursor solution before thin film deposition. Thus, we are unable to entirely manipulate the electrical properties of the CsSnI3 perovskite during the subsequent processes.29 Extrinsic doping has been demonstrated as a robust method to tune the alloying and doping capabilities for Pb-based perovskites.30 However, most investigations on the incorporation of metals into the perovskite structure in correlation with their mechanism for governing properties remain in their infancy.31 Instead, we should search for a simple, non-destructive and plausible solution to this issue of chemical instability of CsSnI3. We firmly believe that chemical doping is a powerful approach to exert control over the charge carrier behavior, as such devices typically employ highly p-type doped CsSnI3 materials, in which the charge carrier concentrations are manipulated through “doping”.
In this work, we studied the chemical doping of CsSnI3via charge transfer from the molecular donor, which is named as “remote reduction”. By directly depositing the CsSnI3 precursor solution containing cobaltocene molecules (with the formula of Co(C5H5)2, denoted CoCp2), an electron-donating interaction can be formed simultaneously, with which we could examine the impact of electron doping on the Fermi-level position and the valence state of the Co element. An electron-rich environment provided by incorporating CoCp2 offers the capability of suppressing Sn2+ oxidization and lowering the trap density compared to the bare CsSnI3. Therefore, solar cells based on the mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon framework, through which the inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite is penetrated, have achieved a PCE of 3.0%. It is noted that this is the first attempt to embed inorganic CsSnI3 perovskites into a mesoporous inorganic framework to fabricate a device without using organic materials. This work represents a big step for the fabrication of efficient and stable inorganic solar cells based on Sn–perovskite compounds.
Results and discussion
So far, there are only a few reports on the application of CsSnI3 in photovoltaics, as the electrical property manipulation of the CsSnI3 perovskite has remained a challenge. For instance, the preliminary attempt with solvent engineering methods to control crystallization has a negligible effect on device performance, presumably failing to produce the intermediate phase of the so-called SnI2·3DMSO (Fig. S1, ESI†).32 Herein, the chemical doping of CsSnI3via remote reduction has been suggested in this study to suppress Sn2+ oxidation. The “Kröger–Vink” diagram in Fig. 1a illustrates the effect of the dopant concentration on defects in CsSnI3, where donor doping clearly increases the electronic concentration. The electric properties can be rearranged in the presence of dopants through an electron transfer mechanism, such as a chemical treatment or electrochemical charge injection, opening a range of routes to controlling functions that are not accessible to the rigid inorganic crystalline structures with their single structural minimum. Similar phenomena have been observed in remote chemical doping where cobaltocene is commonly used as the donor source.33,34 Cobaltocene, a commonly used one-electron reducing agent with its structure diagram shown in Fig. S2† for organometallic chemistry, can easily give up an “extra” electron from the metal cobalt to form an 18-electron cation with high stability (Fig. 1b).35,36 The chemical diversity and complex conformational space of the ordered CsSnI3 perovskite semiconductor offers a highly possible adaptable structure to interact with chemical redox molecules. In this study, we tuned the CsSnI3 perovskite films by directly adding CoCp2 at various molar ratios. All precursor solutions were made with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent in an inert gas atmosphere. Hereafter, 1% CoCp2 (relative to SnI2) doped black-γ-CsSnI3 is referred to as CoCp2-CsSnI3.

CoCp2 has 19 valence electrons and it tends to lose this “extra” electron to yield an 18-electron cation known as CoCp2+. (c) XRD diffraction patterns and (d) UV-vis spectra of the CoCp2-doped CsSnI3 films. 

Fig. 1c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsSnI3 films with and without CoCp2. The similar diffraction peaks of all samples containing different amounts of CoCp2 are mainly located at 14.3°, 20.3°, 22.8°, 23.9°, 25.0°, 29.0°, 32.5°, and 35.8°, corresponding to black-γ-CsSnI3.14,20 Specifically, CoCp2 (with content less than 1%) has negligible influence on the CsSnI3 film crystallization. Fig. S3† compares the top-view SEM of the CsSnI3 film with and without CoCp2. Apparently, no obvious changes in the film surface and crystalline grains were observed during the film transformation. Conversely, adding too much CoCp2 (2%) reduces the crystal size, possibly due to the release of iodide by chemical damage.37 As illustrated in Fig. 1d, these perovskites show strong absorption with onset at around 950 nm (1.3 eV), irrespective of the content of CoCp2. The UV-visible absorption spectra of these samples maintained the main characteristic profile for black-γ-CsSnI3. In addition, the existence of non-covalent interactions between the CsSnI3 host and donor molecule CoCp2 mainly caused by the unchanged crystal-growth dynamics was further verified by Raman spectroscopy characterization (Fig. S4†). In light of the above observation, incorporating CoCp2 into the bulk CsSnI3 has a negligible effect on the optical properties of the CsSnI3 perovskite films.
We measured the XPS narrow scans of Co2p for the CoCp2-CsSnI3, as well as pristine CoCp2 as reference. As shown in Fig. 2a, we clearly observed peaks assignable to Co 2p3/2 in the CoCp2-CsSnI3 films, indicating the presence of CoCp2. The binding energy peak of Co 2p3/2 at around 780.3 eV for the pristine cobaltocene film positively shifted by about 1 eV for CoCp2-CsSnI3. Interestingly, the peak appearing at around 781.5 eV was assigned to Co3+, due to the electron transfer from cobaltocene to CsSnI3.38 This indicated that the oxidation state of almost all of the cobalt ions has changed from Co2+ to Co3+, suggesting the occurrence of a substantial electron transfer from CoCp2 to CsSnI3. In addition, the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiles of the photon-irradiated CoCp2-CsSnI3 verified a homogeneous distribution of Co characteristic ions across the sample depth (Fig. 2b). A continuous and homogeneous distribution of CoCp2 throughout the whole perovskite layer comprised the uniform electron-donating interaction, ensuring the uniform properties of the CsSnI3 film. In addition, we observed a difference in the Sn ion profiles, which may indicate possible phase separations induced by the excess use of SnF2.

(d) Schematic presentation of the remote reduction induced by CoCp2. 
Fig. S5† presents the photoemission spectra of the CsSnI3 + x% CoCp2 (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2) surfaces. The valence band maximum energy level (EVB) of the CsSnI3 films was estimated to be −5.248 eV relative to the vacuum level (Evac = 0 eV), and the conduction band minimum energy level (ECB) was estimated to be −3.948 eV by adding the band gap (Eg). Together, we noticed that this might be controversial to previous reports on the position of the band structure of CsSnI3.16,20 This could be caused by a result of preparation conditions, sample treatment, and substrates used. The addition of CoCp2 could slightly shift the Fermi energy level (EF) toward a lower bonding energy, near the vacuum level, being consistent with n-type doping (Fig. 2c). This suggests that the p-doping level was decreased by the electron-donating interaction.16 The electron densities of the CsSnI3 + x% CoCp2 films (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2) were further estimated as a function of the CoCp2 concentration, and the results are shown in Fig. S6.† The rise in the free electron density tuned by the Fermi energy level rearrangement is attributed to the charge incorporation from CoCp2 into the CsSnI3 semiconductor. Indeed, the ionization energy of CoCp2 (about −4.0 eV) lies close to the ECB of the CsSnI3 host, satisfying the prerequisite for an effective charge transfer (n-type doping) from small molecular dopants.37Fig. 2d vividly demonstrates the electron transfer from CoCp2 to the bulk CsSnI3 film and induces n-type doped electrical properties. This electron transfer process is referred to as remote reduction. For comparison, an organometallic compound derivative with the formula Fe(C5H5)2, namely ferrocene, was further tested as an additive into the CsSnI3 film, which showed a totally different consequence. Fig. S7b† shows the reduction potential of these compound (cobaltocene and ferrocene) derivatives, which were calculated from the CV measurement shown in Fig. S7a.† The data shows that cobaltocene is around 1.3 volts more negative than the ferrocene derivative. The treatment of CsSnI3 with ferrocene gave no signs of a charge state change in Fe 2p, indicating that there existed no such remote reduction effect (Fig. S7c†).
In order to elucidate the effect of the remote reduction effect on reducing Sn2+ oxidation, we further carried out XPS measurements on the Sn states of the films with and without the CoCp2 additive (Fig. 3a). The main peaks at 495.0 and 486.6 eV are ascribed to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 for Sn2+, respectively. Further deconvolution of the XPS results suggests that the peaks situated at 495.9 and 487.5 eV are identified as the binding energies of Sn4+. It is noteworthy that the proportion of Sn4+ in atomic concentration can be significantly decreased from 18% to 10% in the CsSnI3 film by adding CoCp2. As shown in eqn (1), the pre-existing Sn4+ cation in the crystal structure under the Sn-rich condition is inevitable, leading to the self-doping effect. We suggest that the underlying reasons for reducing the harmful effects of Sn2+ oxidation in our remote reduction process can be correlated with the donating electrons by CoCp2, offering a reduction environment in terms of the redox chemistry as expressed in eqn (2). (In this notation,  and Sn×Sn denote +2 and a neutral charge, respectively, being relative to the ideal charge on the Sn lattice site.) (1) (2)

The trap density of the CsSnI3 perovskite is strongly associated with the Sn4+ content. We further evaluated the trap density to be 1.08 × 1019 cm−3 and 4.48 × 1018 cm−3 for the CsSnI3 and CoCp2-CsSnI3 films using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. 3b). We take it for granted that reducing the in-grain defect density (that is, Sn vacancies) would empower us to improve the performance. We further carried out the time-resolved PL spectroscopies measured at 800 nm to investigate the charge dynamics relevant to the trap density (Fig. S8†). The average lifetime was enhanced from 3.66 to 8.71 ns after incorporating CoCp2. The extended PL lifetime suggests that the remote reduction process leads to a lower trap density in the perovskite film, which is consistent with the aforementioned SCLC measurement. The results clearly indicate that the suppression of Sn2+ oxidation occurred to a great extent in the CoCp2-containing CsSnI3 films.
In particular, the remote reduction plays a critical role in the stability of the CsSnI3 films. We evaluated the oxidation of the CsSnI3 films by monitoring the absorbance and XRD patterns under ambient air conditions. The CsSnI3 film with CoCp2 possessed higher film stability, as reflected by a longer lifetime of about 30 min for maintaining the absorption profile of black-γ-CsSnI3 (Fig. 3c and S9†). The XRD spectrum exhibited Cs2SnI6 diffraction patterns (diffraction peak at 13.1° in Fig. 3d). By contrast, the original CoCp2-CsSnI3 film retained its black-γ-CsSnI3 phase for 1 h. Previous reports have indicated that Cs2SnI6 and some byproducts (oxygen species) are formed via two-step chemical oxidation with oxygen (eqn (3)).39 The Sn2+ oxidation in air could start on the surface of the CsSnI3 crystal grain and then continue within the bulk via ion diffusion. (3)
We further evaluated the concentration of the Sn species in the ToF-SIMS depth profiles of the CsSnI3 films with and without CoCp2 (Fig. 3e and f). The Sn cations efficiently interacted with species with high electronegativity (like diffused I− ions and oxygen species), and eventually formed the characteristic SnI−, SnI2−, SnO− and SnO2− ions. The existence of SnI2− inhibited the Sn2+ oxidation, and wove the Sn–I network that may have prevented the SnO− and SnO2− ions from being generated.19 The higher concentration of SnI2− in CoCp2-CsSnI3 led to two-fold lower content of SnO2− than that in CsSnI3, confirming the effective inhibition of Sn2+ oxidation by CoCp2.
Photovoltaic experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the CoCp2-containing CsSnI3 film-based devices using the mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon framework. Fig. S10a† shows a precise cross-sectional SEM image of the inorganic PSC device. Interestingly, the PSC based on CsSnI3 with the addition of 1% CoCp2 demonstrated a superior performance (Fig. S10b and Table† S1) to the pristine one. Fig. 4a presents the J–V curves of the optimized CsSnI3 devices without and with CoCp2. An inferior performance of the pristine PSC was observed with a PCE of 0.65%, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.27 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 6.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.39. The PCE increased as the amount of CoCp2 increased. This observation could be attributed to the improved VOC and FF. The PCE reached a maximum of 3.0% with 0.36 V, 18.24 mA cm−2, and 0.46 for the VOC, JSC, and FF parameters, respectively, when employing the 1% of CoCp2 contained in the black-γ-CsSnI3 phase film. In the meanwhile, the devices with ferrocene exhibited an almost similar inferior photovoltaic performance (Table S2†). Therefore, the observed performance improvement could not be attributed to the grain boundary passivation from CoCp2. It should be noted that the PCE is far below than that of the CsSnI3 nanorod-based solar cell with a PCE of 12.96%,40 presumably due to a lower crystallinity of the black-γ-CsSnI3 film in the constrained mesoporous structure, as well as a shorter carrier lifetime in the thick device. The short electron diffusion length and lifetime are the primary limitations for realizing an efficient CsSnI3-based PSC.41 We suggest that the dopant concentration optimization, material quantization,40 device structure designment26 and interface functionalization42 could further improve the device performance.

Fig. 4b and S11† further presents the dark J–V characteristics, from which the series resistance (RS) and reverse saturation current density (J0) were obtained by fitting the plot with the Shockley diode model.43 The corresponding fitted RS decreased from 50 to 40 Ω cm2, and J0 was evaluated to be one order lower than that of the pristine CsSnI3 device. A low value of RS and/or J0 is necessary to eliminate the charge loss at high bias voltages and to achieve high FF and VOC.44 This is consistent with the reduction of the interfacial charge recombination for the PSC containing CoCp2, as evidenced by the electronic impedance spectroscopy measurement (EIS) shown in Fig. S12.†Fig. 4c compares the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices, where it presents a substantial improvement from 300 to 950 nm. Meanwhile, the higher EQE of the CoCp2-CsSnI3 device at the longer wavelength region can be attributed to a lower trap state and thus better electron collection efficiency. However, the charge collection efficiency was seen in the negative slope of the quantum efficiency towards longer wavelengths. This could be related to the loss of carriers by recombination in the bulk of the perovskite layer before they could diffuse to the junction to be collected.45 From the aforementioned optical measurements, the absorbance of the CoCp2-CsSnI3 perovskite films was observed to hardly increase. As a result, the enhanced charge collection efficiency led to the substantial increase in EQE without question. An integrated JSC of 17.53 mA cm−2 from the CoCp2-CsSnI3 device was higher than that of the CsSnI3 device with 5.46 mA cm−2. A stabilized PCE of 2.58% was achieved for the cobaltocene-containing device, while that of the pristine device was 0.46% (Fig. 4d). Stability is another crucial parameter for the CsSnI3 PSCs. We anticipated that reducing the Sn vacancies in the perovskites would improve the stability of the CsSnI3 PSCs. We investigated the shelf lifetime of the CsSnI3 PSCs stored in a glovebox and tracked the evolution of the PCEs. Fig. S13† shows that there was no obvious degradation in performance following dark storage in a nitrogen atmosphere for 100 h. This indicates that the stability of the CsSnI3 perovskites is achievable by incorporating a donor element.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we incorporated the electron donor cobaltocene to induce what we call a remote reduction process. The electron donor cobaltocene donated its extra electron to CsSnI3 to construct a reducing environment in which the high energy lying state 5s2 could stably exist. As a result, CsSnI3 perovskite films were obtained with low hole trap density, low degree of oxidation, lower p-type doping state, higher electron density and higher stability. Consequently, the performance was significantly improved with the cobaltocene additive, achieving a PCE of 3.0% with the full printable mesoscopic PSC architecture due to defect depression. The novel study provides an effective method for fabricating efficient and stable lead-free perovskite solar cells by incorporating donor elements to suppress Sn2+ oxidation.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
The device fabrication procedure can be referred to in previous reports.25,46 To prepare a CsSnI3 precursor solution, CsI (Sigma-Aldrich), SnI2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and SnF2 (Sigma-Aldrich) with a molar ratio of 1:1:0.2 and different amounts of cobaltocene (0, 0.5, 1, 2 mol%) were dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, Sigma-Aldrich) to form a 0.8 M solution. A 3 μL solution was dropped onto the 70 °C pre-heated substrate. Finally, the films were annealed at 70 °C for 5 min to finish the device fabrication. All fabrication steps were performed in an argon-filled glovebox.
Characterization
A xenon light source solar simulator (450 W, Oriel, model 9119) with AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the solar cells. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices under these conditions were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the devices, and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. A similar data acquisition system was used to control the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (EQE) measurement. Surface morphology was observed by a field-emission scanning electron microscopy instrument (FSEM, FEI Magellan-400). The crystal structures of the perovskite films were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6100 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation). The morphology of the sample was characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Nova NanoSEM 450). UV-Vis absorption spectra were observed with a PE950 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (LabRAM HR800). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) decays were measured at 760 nm with a 478 nm light pulse as excitation by Delta Flex Fluorescence Lifetime System (Horiba Scientific Com., Japan). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W, SHIMADZU-kratos, Japan) was adopted to determine the band structure of the resulting compounds. X-ray photoluminescence spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W, SHIMADZU-kratos, Japan) was used to further examine the presence of cobaltocene and the relevant influence in the film. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS, TOF.SIMS 5-100, Germany) was used to detect the depth profiles of the involved species. The electronic impedance (EIS) measurements were measured using the PGSTAT302N frequency analyzer from Autolab (The Netherlands), together with the frequency response analyzer module providing voltage modulation in the desired frequency range.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Kröger–Vink diagram representing the defect concentration as a function of the dopant content in the CsSnI3 system. A representation of the log[defects] as a function of log[D], here D is the donor species, [D] is the concentration of donor species. The inset n, p, VSn and VCs represent the electrons, holes, Sn and Cs vacancy, respectively. (b) Schematic illustration of CoCp2's redox property. CoCp2 has 19 valence electrons and it tends to lose this “extra” electron to yield an 18-electron cation known as CoCp2+. (c) XRD diffraction patterns and (d) UV-vis spectra of the CoCp2-doped CsSnI3 films.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) X-ray photoelectron spectra (Co 2p) of the CoCp2 and CoCp2-CsSnI3 films. (b) Presentation of the cross-sectional cobalt element analysis for the CoCp2-CsSnI3 film measured by ToF-SIMS. (c) Schematic band energy diagram of CsSnI3 + x% CoCp2 (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2) films. The variations of the Fermi level (EF) are depicted. (d) Schematic presentation of the remote reduction induced by CoCp2.
