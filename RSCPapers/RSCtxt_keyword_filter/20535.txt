Introduction
The search for new organic/inorganic fluorescent dyes over the past few decades with improved luminescence, electrochemical and charge-transport properties is a thriving subject which is undergoing rapid development. This widespread interest is motivated because of their use as light emitting films, electroluminescent materials, and molecular probes.1,2 The applicability of organic/inorganic fluorescent dyes depends upon their photostability, solvatochromism, molar absorptivity, luminescence quantum yields, solubility and processability. 4,4-Difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (Chart 1) commonly named BODIPYs are effective fluorescent probes/sensors. BODIPY derivatives have emerged as a fascinating class of dyes with excellent performance and stability with a wide range of applications as biomolecular labels,3,4 chromogenic probes and cation sensors,5,6 drug delivery agents,7,8 fluorescent switches,9 electroluminescent films, laser dyes,10–13 light-harvesters14 and sensitizers for solar cells,15 and in labelling16 and photodynamic therapy.17,18 These dyes have excellent features such as high molar extinction coefficients, high fluorescence quantum yields, strong chemical and photochemical stability in solution and in the solid state and remarkable electron/energy transfer properties.19–21 Furthermore, their spectroscopic and photophysical properties are sensitive by attaching secondary units at the pyrrole core, the central pseudo meso position, and at the boron substituents.22 The electronic properties of BODIPYs can be fine-tuned by using several different approaches such as introduction of functional substituents on the carbon framework, enlargement of the chromophore, substitution of the fluorine atoms with O- or C-donors or replacing the meso-CH position with a nitrogen bridge to name a few.19–22 These modifications on the BODIPY architecture provide new opportunities to tune the properties for various applications.

BODIPY dyes were first discovered in 1968 by Treibs and Kreuzer.23 BODIPY dyes can be synthesized in two steps: in the first step, dipyrromethane unit 1 is prepared by condensation of pyrrole and electrophilic carbonyl compounds, such as acid anhydrides, acyl chlorides or aldehydes with a catalytic amount of an acid. In the second step, the dipyrromethane 1 is oxidized to dipyrromethene 2 followed by complexation with BF3·OEt2 in the presence of a base to afford BODIPY 3 (Scheme 1).24,25 Using the standard synthetic approaches, several BODIPY dyes have been prepared from readily available pyrroles and the synthetic efforts were being focused on varying the nature of substituents located at the 8-position.26–28 BODIPY 3 exhibits good photophysical and electrochemical properties. BODIPY 3a absorbs and emits in the visible region at ∼500 nm and 520 nm respectively (Fig. 1a) with decent quantum yields and singlet state lifetimes.29 The BODIPYs are electron deficient and generally show one reversible reduction (Fig. 1b) and one irreversible reduction, along with one ill-defined oxidation. However, the spectral and electrochemical properties can be fine tuned by introducing suitable substituents at the various positions of the BODIPY core.19–21 In recent times, several excellent reviews on BODIPYs have been published because of their steadily increasing popularity over the last few decades. Loudet and Burgess in 2007 reviewed the complete synthetic aspects of various types of BODIPY dyes and their derivatives.20 Ziessel and co-workers discussed photophysical properties and cation/anion sensing abilities of BODIPY dyes.19,21 Awuah and You described the role of the BODIPYs as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy of cancer.17 Boyle and co-workers discussed BODIPYs as components of novel light active materials.30 Ni and Wu described the synthesis of NIR BODIPY dyes and their applications as fluorescent pH probes and in bioimaging.3a Boens, Leen and Dehaen discussed synthesis and applications of BODIPY dyes as fluorescent indicators.31 Shen and co-workers discussed spectral and photophysical properties of different types of long wavelength absorbing BODIPY dyes.22b Thus all these reviews have covered the synthesis and properties of BODIPYs as well as their applications as fluorescent indicators, photodynamic therapy, luminescent devices and energy transfer cassettes. While working on BODIPYs, we realized that the functionalization at all the six pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY core is one of the best strategies to prepare new types of BODIPYs for a wide range of applications.31 A perusal of the literature reveals that the reports on functionalization of pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY core are limited and only the functional groups such as halogens, formyl, cyano, azido, amido and esters were introduced at the pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY framework. Among the functional groups, only halogens have been introduced at all six pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY core,32 and the spectral and electrochemical properties were systematically studied by varying the number of halogen groups.32,33 Furthermore, the halogenated BODIPYs were used as precursors to prepare several interesting BODIPY based systems.34 The halogenated BODIPYs have tremendous potential for use in the synthesis of several other novel BODIPY based systems with properties suitable for a variety of applications. In this review, we provide an overview of different synthetic strategies employed for the synthesis of halogenated BODIPYs containing one to six halogens at pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY framework, the systematic effect of increasing the number of halogens from one to six on spectral and electrochemical properties of BODIPY and the applications of halogenated BODIPYs towards the synthesis of novel BODIPYs along with discussion on their important properties.

Halogenated BODIPYs
The halogenated BODIPYs are the key building blocks to synthesize various substituted complex BODIPYs using palladium coupling reactions.19–22 In addition, halogenated BODIPYs can find applications as probes for photodynamic therapy18 (PDT), a noninvasive methodology for the treatment of malignant tumours. The presence of heavy halogens increases the rate of intersystem crossing resulting in the population of the triplet state which is required for the generation of reactive oxygen species.35 A perusal of the literature revealed that it is possible to introduce halogens at all pyrrole carbons of BODIPY selectively32 and regiospecifically33 and most of these synthetic strategies were reported recently. There are three different strategies to synthesize halogenated BODIPYs: (1) using halogenated pyrroles for BODIPY synthesis;25 (2) halogenation of the dipyrromethane precursors36,37 and using them for the synthesis of BODIPYs and (3) electrophilic substitution reactions on the BODIPYs.38 These methods have been used to synthesize BODIPYs containing one to six halogens at the pyrrole carbons.
Mono-halogenation
The 2-halogenated 4a–4c and 3-halogenated BODIPYs 5a and 5b were prepared by following different strategies shown in Scheme 2. The condensation of an appropriate 4-halogenated-2-acylpyrrole with the desired substituted pyrrole in the presence of one equivalent of phosphorus oxychloride resulted in the formation of dipyrromethene which was complexed by adding excess triethylamine and BF3·OEt2 to afford 2-halogenated BODIPYs394a–4c (Scheme 2a). In this method, the halogen atom was varied from chlorine to bromine to iodine and all three mono-halogenated BODIPYs 4a–4c were prepared in 36–57% yields.39 Alternately, 2-halogenated BODIPYs 4a–4c were prepared by treating BODIPY 3b with one or less than one equivalent of N-halosuccinimide in CH2Cl2 in good yields12,40–44 since the 2-position of BODIPY is more prone to electrophilic substitution reactions (Scheme 2a). The halogenation at the 2-position of BODIPY was also carried out by treating BODIPY 3 with a brominating agent33 such as Br2 and an iodinating agent45 such as I2/HIO3 and afforded respectively 2-halogenated BODIPYs 4a–4c in high yields (Scheme 2a).
 Scheme 2  Different synthetic routes for mono to hexahalogenated BODIPYs 4–16. 
The 3-halogenated BODIPYs 5a and 5b were prepared by condensing 5-halogenated 2-acylpyrrole with a substituted pyrrole in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride followed by treatment with excess NEt3/BF3·OEt239 (Scheme 2b). In this method, one can use any substituted pyrrole as the second pyrrole to prepare a range of 3-halogenated BODIPYs. Alternately, treatment of meso-aryl dipyrromethane 1 with one equivalent of an appropriate N-halosuccinimide at −78 °C in THF followed by oxidation with DDQ and complexation with NEt3/BF3·OEt2 afforded 3-halogenated BODIPYs 5a and 5b in decent yields (Scheme 2b).46
Di-halogenation

3,5-Dihalogenated BODIPYs. 
The 3,5-dihalogenated BODIPYs 6a and 6b were prepared by starting with meso-aryl dipyrromethane 1 as shown in Scheme 2c. Treatment of meso-aryl dipyrromethane 1 with two equivalents of an appropriate N-halosuccinimide in THF at −78 °C followed by oxidation with DDQ and complexation with NEt3/BF3·OEt2 afforded the 3,5-dihalogenated BODIPYs 6a and 6b.36,37 Other halogenated BODIPYs were also formed in these reactions and chromatographic purification was required to separate the 3,5-dihalogenated BODIPY 6a/6b from the mixture of halogenated BODIPYs. This is the only reliable method available to synthesize 3,5-dihalogenated BODIPYs 6a/6b.


2,6-Dihalogenated BODIPYs. 
The 2,6-positions of BODIPY 3 bear the least positive charge and are susceptible for electrophilic attack. The 2,6-dihalogenated BODIPYs33,44,457a–7c were prepared by treating appropriate BODIPY 3 with N-halosuccinimide (NXS) or X2 (Br2, Cl2, I2) in CH2Cl2 at room temperature or other slightly varied reaction conditions (Scheme 2d). Recently Wang et al.47 showed that the regioselective dihalogenation at 2,6-positions can be much faster when reactions were carried out in hexafluoro-2-propanol using N-halosuccinimide as the halogen source (Scheme 2d).


1,7-Dihalogenated BODIPYs. 
The 1,7-positions of BODIPY 3 are electron poor like 3,5-positions and direct halogenation on BODIPY at these positions is not possible if other positions are not blocked with the substituents. Leen et al.48 synthesized the first examples of 1,7-dihalogenated BODIPYs 8a and 8b by adopting two synthetic routes as shown in Scheme 2e. In the first strategy, the authors condensed the 2,3-dimethylpyrrole with acetyl chloride in CH2Cl2 followed by in situ complex formation to afford 2,3,5,6-tetrasubstituted BODIPY 3c which was subjected to bromination by treating with Br2 in CH2Cl2 and afforded 1,7-dibrominated BODIPY 8b in excellent yield.48 In the second strategy, the 2,3-dimethylpyrrole was first formylated at the 5-position under standard Vilsmeier–Haack reaction conditions which was then halogenated at the 4-position by treating with NXS affording 2,3-dimethyl-4-halo-5-formyl pyrrole. The substituted pyrrole was then treated with phosphorus oxychloride to afford dipyrromethene which was then complexed with BF3·OEt2 yielding 1,7-dihalogenated BODIPY 8a/8b as the sole product (Scheme 2e).48 Thus, the 1,7-dihalogenated BODIPYs 8a and 8b can be prepared only by blocking all other pyrrolic positions of BODIPY. Ortiz et al.49b reported the synthesis of 1,2-diiodinated 9a and 2,3-diiodinated BODIPYs 9b by treating BODIPY 3e (pyrrole carbons were blocked) with 2.5 equivalents of ICl in CH2Cl2–CH3OH and the resulting mixture of diiodinated BODIPYs 9a and 9b were separated by column chromatography (Scheme 2f). These kinds of dihalogenated BODIPYs 9a and 9b can be prepared only by blocking the second pyrrole ring carbons of the BODIPY unit.

Tri-halogenation
2,3,5-Trichloro BODIPY 10a was synthesized by treating BODIPY 3a with four equivalents of N-chlorosuccinimide in THF (Scheme 2g) at room temperature.12 Lakshmi and Ravikanth synthesized 2,3,5-tribromo BODIPY 10b by treating meso-aryl dipyrromethane 1 with three equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide in CH2Cl2 at −78 °C followed by oxidation with DDQ and complexation with BF3·OEt2.32 In these bromination reactions, although the other brominated BODIPYs also form, the major product is the desired compound 10b which was separated by column chromatography (Scheme 2g). Jiao and co-workers33 reported regiospecific bromination of BODIPYs by treating BODIPY with liquid bromine but they could not isolate tribromo BODIPY 10b. Ortiz et al.49b prepared the 1,2,3-triiodo BODIPY 11 by taking BODIPY 3e in which one of the pyrrole ring carbons was blocked and treated with 4.5:4 ratio of I2–HIO3 in CH2Cl2–CH3OH at room temperature (Scheme 2h). The reaction resulted in the formation of a mixture of two different types of 1,2,3-triiodo BODIPYs which were separated by column chromatography. The same research group also reported the synthesis of 2,3,6-triiodo BODIPY 12 by treating meso-aryl BODIPY with 3.5 equivalents of ICl and the resulting mixture of halogenated BODIPYs was separated by column chromatography to afford 2,3,6-triiodo BODIPY 12 (Scheme 2i).49b
Tetra-halogenation
The 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro BODIPY 13a was synthesized by treating BODIPY 3a with N-chlorosuccinimide.1213a was also synthesized by treating the meso-thienyl BODIPY with sulfuryl chloride (Scheme 2j) at room temperature.49a Jiao et al.33 reported the synthesis of 2,3,5,6-tetrabromo BODIPY 13b by treating BODIPY 3a with 6 equivalents of Br2 in CH2Cl2. Lakshmi and Ravikanth32 synthesized 2,3,5,6-tetrabromo BODIPY 13 by reacting meso-aryl dipyrromethane 1 with four equivalents of NBS in THF at −78 °C followed by oxidation with DDQ and complexation with BF3·OEt2 (Scheme 2j). This method afforded the desired tetrabrominated BODIPY 13b along with other brominated BODIPYs and the desired tetrabrominated BODIPY 13b was separated from other brominated BODIPYs by column chromatography. Ortiz et al.49b prepared tetraiodo BODIPY 14a and mixed tetrahalogenated BODIPYs having two different types of halogens such as iodo and chloro groups 14b and 14c by treating BODIPY with 8 equivalents of ICl in CH2Cl2–CH3OH (Scheme 2k) and isolated tetrahalogenated BODIPYs 14a–14c by column chromatography.
Penta-halogenation
The 1,2,3,5,6-pentabrominated BODIPY 15 was prepared either from meso-aryl dipyrromethane321 or meso-aryl BODIPY333a (Scheme 2l). Jiao et al.33 prepared this compound by treating BODIPY 3a with 40 equivalents of Br2 in CH2Cl2 whereas Lakshmi and Ravikanth32 prepared the same compound by treating meso-aryl dipyrromethane 1 with five equivalents of NBS in THF followed by oxidation with DDQ and complexation with BF3·OEt2 (Scheme 2l). In both strategies, the pentabrominated BODIPY 15 forms as a major product along with other minor brominated BODIPYs and column chromatography was used to isolate the 1,2,3,5,6-pentabrominated BODIPY 15 in decent yields.
Hexa-halogenation
Lakshmi and Ravikanth32 and Ortiz et al.12 used the same synthetic strategy to prepare 1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahalogenated BODIPYs 16a and 16b by treating meso-aryl dipyrromethane 1 with excess equivalents of N-halosuccinimide in THF at room temperature followed by oxidation with DDQ and complexation with BF3·OEt2 (Scheme 2m). Simple column chromatographic purification was required to afford pure hexahalogenated BODIPYs 16a and 16b in decent yield. Jiao et al.33 also succeeded in synthesizing hexabrominated meso-aryl BODIPY 16b by treating meso-aryl BODIPY 3a with excess equivalents of Br2 (Scheme 2m).
Properties
The introduction of halogens at the pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY core, in general, alters the electronic properties of the BODIPY and there are several reports discussing the effect of halogen(s) on spectral and electrochemical properties of the BODIPY. Lakshmi and Ravikanth32 carried out a systematic study on alteration of electronic properties of the BODIPY by sequential addition of bromines from one to six at the pyrrole carbons of BODIPY. The crystal structures were solved for brominated BODIPYs32,33 where the number of bromines was varied from two to six bromines. The crystal structures revealed that the dihedral angle between the BODIPY core (C6C5C10C15) and the meso-anisyl group was increased from 48° to 88° (Fig. 2) with the increase of the number of bromines. Thus, the meso-anisyl ring was almost in perpendicular orientation in pentabromo- 15 and hexabromo BODIPYs 16. This observation indicates that only the bromine groups present at 1- and 7-positions causes steric hindrance and restricts the rotation of the meso-anisyl group resulting in nearly perpendicular orientation of the meso-anisyl group with the BODIPY core.32 The absorption properties of brominated BODIPYs (5, 6, 10, 13, 15 and 16) with a step wise increase in the number of bromines were studied and compared with unsubstituted meso-aryl BODIPY 3a (Fig. 3a). The studies indicated that each step wise increase in the number of bromine groups at the pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY core resulted in a bathochromic shift compared to unsubstituted meso-aryl BODIPY 3a and the magnitude of the red shift in the absorption band depends on the number of bromines substituted at the BODIPY core. It was noted that each bromine substitution at the pyrrole carbon contributes 10 nm red shift compared to the absorption band of unsubstituted BODIPY 3a. However, the authors noted that the systematic red shift was possible only up to the introduction of four bromines and compounds with five and six bromines 15 and 16 did not show any further red shift. The plot of the magnitude of red shifts versus the number of bromines substituted showed a clear non-linear curve which indicates that the magnitude of red shift with each bromine substitution is non-additive. The fluorescence spectral studies revealed that the brominated BODIPYs (5, 6, 10, 13, 15 and 16) show one single broad emission band which shifted gradually to higher wavelength with the increase of the number of bromine groups up to four and no further red shifts were noted for penta 15 and hexabrominated BODIPYs 16. The quantum yields were decent for mono to tetrabrominated BODIPYs (5, 6, 10, 13) and significantly low for penta 15 and hexabrominated BODIPYs 16 due to the heavy halogen effect which was more pronounced only for 15 and 16.

The redox properties of brominated BODIPYs showed a very interesting trend with the increase of the number of bromines at the pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY core. The BODIPYs are, in general, electron deficient and show one or two reductions but oxidation is either irreversible or absent. The brominated BODIPYs (5, 6, 10, 13, 15 and 16) showed one reversible reduction and one irreversible reduction and the comparison of the first reduction wave of brominated BODIPYs along with unsubstituted meso-aryl BODIPY 3a is presented in Fig. 3b.32 The addition of each bromine resulted in a successive anodic shift of the reduction potential compared to unsubstituted meso-aryl BODIPY 3a indicating that the BODIPY becomes easier to reduce with the increase of the number of bromine groups. The linear relationship between E1/2 for the first reduction and the number of Br groups (Fig. 3c) indicates that the effect was additive and the slope of the straight line plot was 80 mV per Br group. Thus, the redox properties exhibited a systematic trend with the increase of the number of Br groups and the first reduction potential of BODIPY was linearly related to the number of Br groups.32
Applications
The halogenated BODIPYs 4–16 are highly useful synthons to prepare several interesting BODIPY derivatives which have potential applications in various fields. The halogenated BODIPYs 4–16 were subjected to various transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions as well as nucleophilic substitution reactions and the selective systems are described here.
2-Substituted BODIPYs
The 2-halogenated BODIPYs 4a–4c were used to synthesize a variety of 2-substituted BODIPYs 17–21 including BODIPY–chromophore conjugates (Scheme 3) under palladium catalyzed coupling conditions.39–43 The β−β linked BODIPY dimer 18 was prepared by palladium catalyzed borylation with bis(pinacolato)diboron (pin2 B2) followed by the in situ cross-coupling sequence in the presence of Cs2CO3 as a base.50 When CH3COOK was used instead of Cs2CO3, the authors obtained mono-boryl BODIPY 19a (Scheme 3) which was used for the synthesis of β−β linked BODIPY trimer 19b (vide infra). The β−β linked BODIPY dimer 18 showed significant bathochromic shifts in both absorption and emission spectra. However, the fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime of 18 were decreased compared to meso-aryl BODIPY monomer 3a due to enhancement of non-radiative decay processes contributed by the decreased HOMO–LUMO gap as well as increased vibrational relaxation channels including the torsional motions around the β−β linkage of BODIPY dimer 18.50

Ulrich et al.51 carried out carbopalladium reaction by treating 2-iodo BODIPY 4c with a palladium catalyst under a stream of CO and in the presence of various nucleophiles, primary or secondary alcohols and afforded BODIPYs containing ester or amido substituents at 2-positions 17a–17c (Scheme 3). The 2-halo BODIPYs 4b/4c were reacted with various types of boronic acids under Suzuki coupling conditions and several 2-substituted BODIPYs 20a–20f were prepared. 2-Substituted BODIPYs52–59 containing bulky substituents such as tetraphenylethene5220d and triphenylsilylphenyl53 groups 20f were found to be strongly fluorescent in the solid state because of inhibition of aggregation. The 2-halo BODIPYs 4b/4c were also subjected to Sonogashira coupling by treating it with various aryls containing ethynyl functional groups and afforded ethynyl bridged BODIPY systems41,44,60–6221a–21e (Scheme 3). Some of these 2-substituted BODIPYs were used for various applications44,45,60,61 (Scheme 4). Zhao and co-workers used 2-bipyridyl substituted BODIPY 21c to prepare BODIPY-Ir(III)3 complex 22 (Scheme 4a) by treating 21c with [Ir(ppy)2]Cl2 in CH2Cl2–CH3OH.61 This kind of complex was used as triplet photosensitizers for singlet oxygen mediated photooxidation of 1,5-dihydronaphthalene to produce juglone.61 Since these complexes were efficient for singlet oxygen production, the complexes were also used for photocytotoxicity studies in lung cancer cells upon irradiation. Thus, the complexes such as 22 also have potential applications in in vivo photodynamic therapy of cancer.61 Zhao and co-workers59 also synthesized BODIPY-C60 dyad 23a by reacting 2-thienyl substituted BODIPY 20b with C60 and sarcosine in toluene at reflux temperature (Scheme 4b) and used the dyad 23a as a triplet photosensitizer for triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion. The authors claimed that this kind of heavy metal free BODIPY-C60 dyad 23a can act as an organic triplet photosensitizer which replaces the conventional heavy transition metal based phosphorescent complexes such as 22.59 Akkaya and co-workers45 used the 2-terpyridyl BODIPY 21e as a building block to prepare BODIPY-metal terpyridine complex 23b (Scheme 4c).

3-Substituted BODIPYs
The mono-3-halogenated BODIPYs 5a and 5b were used first to introduce the aryl group at the 3-position (Scheme 5) under transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reaction conditions.39,41 The 3-halogenated BODIPYs 5a and 5b were subjected to Stille coupling reactions by treating with an equimolar amount of Sn(R)4/RSn(Bu)3 (R = phenyl/furyl/thienyl) in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4 in toluene at reflux temperature to afford 3-aryl BODIPYs 24a–24c (Scheme 5).39 Alternately, the 3-aryl BODIPYs 24a–24f were prepared by subjecting 3-halogenated BODIPYs 5a/5b to Suzuki coupling conditions by reacting with aryl/heteroarylboronic acids under palladium catalyzed conditions.39 The alkenylated BODIPYs 25a and 25b were prepared by treating 3-halogenated BODIPY 5a with alkenes under Heck coupling reaction conditions (Scheme 5).39 The 3-halogenated BODIPYs 5a/5b were also subjected to a palladium catalyzed Sonogashira reaction with aryl/alkyl ethynes to afford ethynylated BODIPYs 26a–26c.39,41 Recently, 3-ethyl substituted BODIPY 27 was prepared by treating 3-bromo BODIPY 5b with different organozinc reagents in the presence of Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 under Negishi reaction conditions for the first time.62 Thus, 3-halogenated BODIPYs 5a and 5b were used to prepare different types of substituted BODIPYs 24–27 under various types of palladium catalyzed coupling conditions.

The introduction of a substituent at the 3-position of BODIPY by following any synthetic methods alters the electronic properties of the BODIPY dye which reflects in their spectral properties.39,41,46 For example, the meso-aryl BODIPY 3a absorbs and emits strongly at 500 and 520 nm, respectively.29 However, upon introduction of the styryl group at the 3-position of BODIPY by Heck coupling reaction,39 the absorption and emission bands of 25a experienced significant bathochromic shifts and absorbs at 559 nm and emits at 571 nm.39 Similarly, the other properties such as extinction coefficients, quantum yield, singlet state lifetime, redox potentials, etc. also alter significantly upon introduction of substituents at the 3-position. In addition to simple substituents at the 3-position, Ravikanth and co-workers46,63,64 used 3-bromo BODIPY 5b to synthesize covalently linked BODIPY–chromophore/redox active conjugates 28a–28g under mild Pd(0) coupling conditions as shown in Scheme 6. The chromophores possessing very distinct features such as anthracene, terpyridine, porphyrin, Zn(II)porphyrin, 21,23-dithiaporphyrin, thiasapphyrin4628a–28f and redox active unit such as ferrocene63–6528g were connected at the 3-position of the boron-dipyrromethene dye (Scheme 6) by coupling of 3-bromo BODIPY 5b with an appropriate ethynyl functionalized chromophore/redox active in toluene–triethylamine in the presence of a catalytic amount of AsPh3/Pd2(dba)3 at 40 °C. The spectral studies indicated that the interaction is stronger in ethynyl bridged BODIPY–anthracene conjugate 28a compared to other ethynylphenyl bridged BODIPY–chromophore conjugates 28a–28f.46 The steady state fluorescence studies indicated that in ethynyl bridged BODIPY–anthracene conjugate 28a, the BODIPY unit acts as the energy acceptor (Fig. 4a) and showed a possibility of energy transfer from the donor anthracene unit to the acceptor BODIPY unit on selective excitation of the anthracene unit at 350 nm.46 However, in ethynylphenyl bridged BODIPY–porphyrin conjugates 28e and 28f, the BODIPY unit acts as the energy donor and exhibited a possibility of singlet–singlet energy transfer from the BODIPY unit to other chromophore units. For example, in the BODIPY–porphyrin conjugate 28e, on excitation of the BODIPY unit at 488 nm, the emission was quenched from the BODIPY unit significantly and strong emission was observed from the porphyrin unit (Fig. 4b) because of singlet–singlet energy transfer from the BODIPY unit to the porphyrin unit.46 Thus, the BODIPY can act either as an energy donor or an energy acceptor depending on the chromophore to which it is attached in the BODIPY–chromophore conjugates 28a–28f.

The 3-mono-halogenated BODIPYs 5a and 5b were also subjected to nucleophilic substitution reactions by treating with O-, N- and S- based nucleophiles in the presence of a base under reflux conditions (Scheme 7).39,65 Ravikanth and co-workers65 synthesized 3-oxypyridine BODIPY 35 by treating 3-bromo BODIPY 5b with 3-hydroxypyridine and used compound 35 to prepare non-covalent BODIPY-Zn(II) porphyrin dyad 36a and BODIPY-Ru(II) porphyrin dyad 36b assembled via Zn(II)/Ru(II)-pyridine “N” interactions (Scheme 7). The 3-(pyridine-4-one)BODIPY 37 was prepared by treating 3-bromo BODIPY 5b with 4-hydroxypyridine and converted to 3-(pyridine-4-thione)BODIPY 38 by treating it with Lawesson's reagent.66 The 3-(pyridine-4-thione)BODIPY 38 was used as an exclusive chemodosimetric sensor for Hg(II) ions as it shows significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity and a dramatic colour change from pink to fluorescent green in the presence of Hg(II) ions.66
 Scheme 7  Nucleophilic substitution reactions on 3-halo BODIPYs 5a and 5b. 
The 3-amino BODIPY 41 was prepared by two different routes from 3-bromo BODIPY 5b. Talukdar and co-workers67 prepared the 3-amino BODIPY 41 by treating 5b with 15% NH3 in H2O–CH3CN at room temperature (Scheme 7). Alternately, Ravikanth and co-workers68 prepared 41 by treating 5b with sodium azide in acetonitrile followed by triphenylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran at reflux temperature. The 3-amino BODIPY 41 was used to prepare 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl (DBS) appended BODIPY 42c by treating 41 with DBS chloride in the presence of NaH (Scheme 7).67 The BODIPY 42c is non-fluorescent due to photo-induced electron transfer from BODIPY to the DBS group. However, in the presence of thiophenols which cleave the DBS group, the fluorescence was restored and thus 42c can be used as a turn-on fluorescent probe for selective detection of thiophenols.67 Furthermore, the amino group of 3-amino BODIPY 41 was derivatized to prepare 3-phenylurea substituted BODIPY 42a and 3-phenylthiourea substituted BODIPY 42b under simple reaction conditions.68 The authors demonstrated that 42a can be used as a colorimetric and ratiometric sensor for the F− ion and 42b can used as a specific chemodosimetric sensor for the Hg2+ ion.68
The 3-azido BODIPY 39 was prepared by reacting 5b with NaN3 in acetone–water (1:1) at room temperature (Scheme 7).69,70 The BODIPY 39 was found to be a fluorescence turn-on probe for selective and sensitive detection of H2S and demonstrated in living cells.69 The 3-azido BODIPY 39 was used as key precursor to prepare a series of trizole bridged BODIPY–chromophore conjugates 43a–43e by treating 3-azido BODIPY 39 with an ethynyl containing chromophore in the presence of CuI/DIPEA in THF–CH3CN at room temperature (Scheme 8).70,71 The fluorescence studies indicated efficient energy transfer from BODIPY to the BF2-smaragdyrin unit in conjugate 43e but the energy transfer was not efficient from BODIPY to porphyrin macrocycles in conjugates 43b and 43c.70

3,5-Disubstituted BODIPYs
The 3,5-dihalo BODIPYs 6a and 6b were used to prepare symmetrically or asymmetrically aryl substituted BODIPY derivatives 44–47 by the Stille, Suzuki, Heck, Sonogashira and Negishi coupling reactions (Scheme 9).62,72–75 Prior to this approach, the 3,5-diaryl substituted BODIPY derivatives were prepared from the aryl substituted pyrroles.25 The accessibility of 3,5-dihalo BODIPYs 6a and 6b helped in the preparation of a wide range of 3,5-diaryl substituted BODIPYs 44–47 under various Pd catalyzed coupling conditions in good yields.72–75 Recently, Ziessel and co-workers76 used 3,5-bis(thiophene-benzothiadiazole-thiophene) substituted BODIPY 44c as bulk heterojunction solar cells by blending the dye 44c with [6,6]phenylC61 or 71 butyric acid methylester which showed a power conversion efficiency of about 1.26% upon mild thermal annealing. The presence of conjugated aryl groups at the 3,5-positions alters the electronic properties of the dye significantly which reflected in their spectral and electrochemical properties.77 For example, the 3,5-distyryl BODIPY 45 exhibits 50–70 nm shifts in its absorption and emission bands compared to the unsubstituted BODIPY 3a which is due to the enhancement of conjugation.77 Some of these 3,5-disubstituted BODIPYs were also used for a wide range of applications since the substituents at the 3,5-positions significantly alter the electronic properties. Rajeswara Rao et al.37 showed that the 3,5-bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)BODIPY [BODIPY(CCTMS)2] 46b can be used as a selective colorimetric and fluorescent chemodosimeter for fluoride ions. The fluoride ion induced cleavage of the trimethylsilyl group of 46b, the protecting group of the ethyne functionality, resulted in clear changes in UV-vis (Fig. 5a) and fluorescence spectra as well as in the solution colour. No such observations were made when compound 46b was treated with other anions such as Cl−, Br−, I−, ClO4− and HPO42−. Thus the authors demonstrated that small alterations in the molecular structure of BODIPY dyes by using well-known reactions make the BODIPYs act as specific sensors for anions.37 The 3,5-bis(ferrocenyl)BODIPY 46c has been shown as a fluorescent redox switch by absorption, electrochemical and fluorescence studies.63 Compound 46c showed a strong charge transfer band at ∼700 nm due to electron transfer from ferrocene to the BODIPY unit along with absorption bands corresponding to the BODIPY moiety and the compound was weekly fluorescent. However, upon oxidation of the ferrocene moiety of 46c to the ferrocenium ion resulted in a decent fluorescence (Fig. 5b) due to elimination of the possibility of electron transfer and thus 46c acts as a fluorescent redox switch.63

Furthermore, the 3,5-dihalo BODIPYs 6a and 6b were also used for nucleophilic substitution reactions by treating 6a/6b with C-, O-, N-, S-, Se- and Te-nucleophilic groups under reflux conditions and a wide variety of BODIPYs78–89 (48, 49) substituted with different nucleophiles including BODIPYs substituted with crown ethers78,7948k were prepared (Scheme 10). These substituted BODIPYs 48, 49 were explored for a wide range of applications as discussed here for some selected systems. The 3,5-bis(sulfosuccinimidyl diester) substituted BODIPY 50 synthesized from 48i was used for labelling proteins as the dye exhibits a bright and stable fluorescence.88 The crown ether substituted BODIPYs (Scheme 10b) such as 49c were used as ratiometric fluorescent sensors for potassium ions.78 Similarly, the 3-(ethynyl)phenylethynyl-5-(2-picolyl)amine substituted BODIPY 49e was used as a selective fluorescent turn on chemosensor for Cu2+ ions among various metal ions.90,91 The di-2-picolyamine substituted BODIPY 49f (Scheme 10a) was used as a fluorometric sensor for heavy metal ions.92
 Scheme 10  Reactivity of 3,5-dihalogen BODIPYs 6a and 6b towards nucleophilic substitution reactions. 
Ravikanth and co-workers65 used the BODIPY containing two oxypyridine substituents at 3,5-positions 48f to prepare non-covalent BODIPY-metalloporphyrin triads 52 assembled using metal-pyridine “N” interactions (Scheme 10c). The BODIPY-metalloporphyrin triads 52a and 52b were prepared by treating BODIPY with two oxypyridine substituents at 3,5-positions 48f with metalloporphyrin 51 (M = Zn(II), Ru(II), Scheme 10c).65 The NMR studies on triads 52 indicated that the triad based on oxypyridine-Ru(II) porphyrin 52b is more stable than the triad 52a based on Zn(II) porphyrin interactions.65 Four covalently linked trichromophore systems9353a–53d containing the central BODIPY unit connected to two different types of porphyrin units or one porphyrin and one expanded porphyrin units at 3,5-positions were synthesized by treating 3-bromo-5-porphyrinyl BODIPY 54a or 3-bromo-5-rubyrinyl BODIPY 54b with the corresponding hydroxy porphyrin 55 or hydroxy expanded porphyrin 55d in CHCl3 at 60 °C as shown in Scheme 11. The absorption and electrochemical studies supported weak ground state interactions among the three chromophore units in trichromophore systems 53a–53d. The fluorescence studies indicated that the BODIPY emission is quenched in all trichromophore systems 53a–53d due to transfer of singlet-state energy of BODIPY to one or both macrocyclic units attached to BODIPY either radiatively or non-radiatively. However, the magnitude of BODIPY fluorescence quenching is varied among the trichromophore systems 53a–53d and the maximum quenching was observed for the trichromophore system 53c.93

2,6-Disubstituted BODIPYs
2,6-Dihalogen substituted BODIPYs 7a–7c were also equally reactive like 3,5-dihalo substituted BODIPYs 6a and 6b and several 2,6-disubstituted BODIPY derivatives 56–59 were synthesized by coupling 2,6-dihalogenated BODIPYs 7a–7c under transition metal catalysed reaction conditions (Scheme 12a). The groups such as terpyridyl, bipyridyl,45 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole,94 platinum(II) bis(aryleneethynylene) bis(trialkylphosphine)95,96 at 2,6-positions of BODIPY 56a–56e were prepared (Scheme 12a) by treating 2,6-dihalo BODIPY 7b/7c with appropriate ethynyl containing chromophores under Sonogashira coupling conditions.45,94–98 The terpyridyl containing BODIPY 56a was used to prepare fluorescent metallosupramolecular coordination polymers 60 or BODIPY-metal terpyridyl complexes 61 (Scheme 12b).45,97 The aromatic groups such as thienyl, phenyl,99 biphenyl,100 pyridyl,101,102 and triphenyl amine103 were introduced at 2,6-positions of BODIPY by treating 2,6-dihalo BODIPY 7b/7c with appropriate boronic acids under Suzuki coupling conditions.99–104 The 2,6-dipyridyl BODIPY 57d was used to prepare metal–organic frameworks by treating with Zn(II) porphyrin and these porphyrin-BODIPY based metal–organic frameworks were used to study the light harvesting properties.101 The 2,6-dipyridyl BODIPY 57d was used for selectively sensing Cu(II) ions.102 The triphenylamine substituted BODIPY 57a was used in bulk heterojunction solar cells as an electron donor which exhibited photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 0.77%.103 The BODIPY based polymers 58a–58c were synthesized by treating 2,6-dihalo BODIPY 7b/7c with distannyl arenes under Stille cross-coupling conditions.104–106 Similarly, BODIPY homopolymer 59 was also synthesized from 2,6-dihalo BODIPY 7b/7c in the presence of Ni(COD)2–bipyridine (1:1) in DMF at 80 °C for three days (Scheme 12a).104 These BODIPY based polymers 58a–58c, 59 were used for photovoltaic applications.

1,7-Disubstituted BODIPYs
Similarly, the 1,7-dihalo substituted BODIPYs 8a and 8b were also subjected to various types of Pd coupling reactions as well as nucleophilic substitution reactions (Scheme 13).48 The 1,7-positions of BODIPY 3 are rather electron poor like 3,5-positions and are susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitutions. However, among the nucleophiles based on nitrogen, oxygen, carbon and sulphur, only sulphur based nucleophiles were able to introduce at 1,7-positions of BODIPY.48 Generally, the introduction of new substituents on the BODIPY system creates a huge difference in its optical properties.19–22 The studies showed that the introduction of new substituents by extending the conjugation at 1,7-positions of BODIPY (63–66) did not alter the optical properties significantly compared to 3,5-positions of BODIPY.48

Tri, tetra and pentasubstituted BODIPYs
The 2,3,5-tribromo BODIPY3210b, 2,3,5,6-tetrabromo BODIPY3213b and 1,2,3,5,6-pentabromo BODIPY3215 were also used to prepare the corresponding phenyl substituted BODIPYs 67–69 by reacting the respective halogen substituted BODIPYs 10/13/15 with phenylboronic acid under Suzuki coupling conditions (Scheme 14a).33 2,6-Dichloro-3,5-dipyrrolyl BODIPY 68b and 2,3,6-trichloro-5-pyrrolyl BODIPY 68c were prepared by nucleophilic substitution of tetrachloro BODIPY 13a with pyrrole under reflux conditions (Scheme 14b).107 The sterically crowded hexaarylated BODIPYs 70a–70f were prepared by treating 1,2,3,5,6,7-hexabromo BODIPY 16b with various types of boronic acids such as phenyl, thienyl, p-tolyl, 4-fluorophenyl, p-anisyl, biphenyl and naphthylboronic acids under the same Pd(0) mediated Suzuki cross-coupling conditions (Scheme 15).33,108–110

The introduction of bulkier aryl group(s) at the pyrrole carbons of BODIPY alters the electronic properties of the BODIPY which reflects in their spectral and electrochemical properties. Lakshmi and Ravikanth studied the variations in spectral and electrochemical properties by systematically introducing one to six phenyl groups at the pyrrole carbons of BODIPY (24a, 44a, 67–70).33 The absorption and fluorescence studies showed a bathochromic shift in absorption and emission bands, an increase in quantum yield and singlet state lifetime in the presence of four phenyl groups at the pyrrole carbons of BODIPY but the properties were reversed for five and six phenyl substituted BODIPYs 69 and 70. The electrochemical studies indicated that with the increase of the number of phenyl groups at the pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY framework, the electron rich nature of BODIPY increases.33
Recently, Lakshmi and Ravikanth111,112 also successfully synthesized mixed polyarylated BODIPYs containing two or three different types of aryl/alkyl groups 71–74 (Chart 2) using halogenated BODIPYs over a sequence of steps. For example, the mixed BODIPYs containing two different types of aryl groups 71–73 such as BODIPY with three phenyl and three tolyls 72a was prepared using 2,3,5-tribromo BODIPY 10b as key precursor as shown in Scheme 16a.111 The 2,3,5-tribromo BODIPY 10b was first reacted with phenylboronic acid under Suzuki coupling conditions to afford 2,3,5-triphenyl BODIPY 67. The 2,3,5-triphenyl BODIPY 67 was treated with liquid Br2 to obtain 1,6,7-tribromo-2,3,5-triphenyl BODIPY 75 which was further reacted with p-tolylboronic acid under Pd(0) coupling conditions (Scheme 16a) affording BODIPY containing two different types of aryl groups 72a.111 The BODIPY containing three different types of aryl groups 74a–74d were also prepared over a sequence of steps of bromination followed by Suzuki coupling with aryl boronic acids as described here (Scheme 16b).112 In the first step, the 3,5-dibromo BODIPY 6b was converted to 3,5-diphenyl BODIPY 44a under Suzuki coupling conditions which was then selectively brominated at 2,6-positions by treating 3,5-diphenyl BODIPY 44a with 2.2 equivalents of liquid Br2. The resulting 2,6-dibromo-3,5-diphenyl BODIPY 76 was reacted with p-tolylboronic acid under the same Pd(0) coupling conditions to afford 2,3,5,6-tetraaryl BODIPY 77 which was then further subjected to bromination by treating it with liquid bromine affording 1,7-dibromo-3,5-diphenyl-2,6-ditolyl BODIPY 78.112 This 1,7-dibrominated 2,3,5,6-tetraaryl BODIPY 78 was then reacted with 4-fluorophenylboronic acid under Pd(0) coupling conditions to obtain polyarylated BODIPY containing three different types of aryl groups at the pyrrole carbons (74a). All these mixed polyarylated sterically crowded BODIPYs 71–74 absorb and emit strongly in the region of 550–650 nm with decent quantum yields and singlet state lifetimes and are very stable under redox conditions.

Conclusions
Halogenated BODIPYs are versatile building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of BODIPYs with interesting applications. Halogens are the only functional groups which can be placed at six pyrrole carbons of the BODIPY framework. The synthetic strategies which are established would allow synthesizing any desired halogenated BODIPY, and the halogenated BODIPYs give access to a variety of BODIPY compounds that can be made. Indeed, hexahalogenated BODIPYs are the only functionalized BODIPYs which assist in the synthesis of hexasubstituted BODIPYs in one-pot reaction. Thus, we hope that the halogenated BODIPYs would be exploited in the preparation of new BODIPY based compounds which can find applications in various fields ranging from materials to medicine.
