    , Accepted 6th December 2018First published on 20th December 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) reached a certified 23.7% efficiency in 2018 by boosting their surprisingly high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and photocurrent. The suppressed recombination in PSCs significantly cut down the voltage loss between the bandgap energy and VOC, which encouraged the VOC to reach closer to the bandgap. In addition, the photocurrent is considerably closer to the theoretical value at a given bandgap, leaving almost no room for further improvement. This remarkable development in the performance of PSCs is mainly ascribed to high-quality perovskite material being consistently tailored in the progress of technology. At the beginning of the progress, the morphology of the perovskite was a major target for improvement to enhance the crystal quality. The need for compositional engineering of the perovskite was raised in later stages of the progress by considering the benefits from different compositions of perovskites and their structural stability. Here we review the overall progress in perovskite materials from two perspectives: morphological progress and compositional progress.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have expanded explosively since their first emergence in 2012.1,2 Remarkably, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs was rapidly raised to 23.7% as a certified efficiency in 2018.3 In terms of PCE, PSCs not only surpassed other emerging photovoltaics, such as dye-sensitized solar cells, organic cells, inorganic cells and quantum dot cells,3 even before PSC technology had matured, but they also became more competitive in thin-film technologies, including CIGS, CdTe and amorphous Si solar cells,3 which means that PSCs are successfully settling into being one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies. The perovskite materials in PSCs generally refer to halide perovskites which show outstanding photo-electrical properties. The favorable electronic band structure of perovskite exhibits a direct p–p transition bandgap, which is responsible for the strong optical absorption, absorption coefficients one order of magnitude higher than that of GaAs, and small effective masses for both carriers.4 The photo-generated exciton can be readily dissociated into free charges owing to its low binding energy (∼50 mV),5 where the free carriers travel independently due to their ambipolar charge-transfer property.6 Notably, perovskite shows a long balanced carrier diffusion length (>1 μm) and a long carrier lifetime (ca. 273 ns),7 which is rarely expected from a solution-processed material, which is inevitably accompanied by a high density of defects.8 The outstanding carrier property in perovskite is also accounted for by the large polaron formation and high defect tolerance with a shallow trap density.4,9,10 While tremendous efforts have been made into understanding the fundamental physics, the perovskite engineering technology has also been consistently developed to obtain a high-quality perovskite layer.11,12 The progress in perovskite engineering can be roughly understood in two ways: morphological optimization and compositional engineering. From the perspective of morphological evolution, the perovskite morphology has been changed from dots at the very beginning to bulk in the most recent state-of-the-art. On the other hand, from the compositional point of view, single cation-based and single halide-based perovskites have turned into structures with multiple cations and anions to ensure superior properties and stability. In this review paper, we investigate the progress in PSCs chronologically by focusing on the perovskite material from the two perspectives of morphology and compositional evolution.
2. Morphological evolution of perovskite
The morphology of perovskite has changed consistently, as a result of the development of new processes for perovskite deposition. The morphological evolution, aimed at maximizing the potential of perovskite, was enabled by an in-depth understanding of the photo-electrical properties of perovskite. The initial perovskite showed a dot-like morphology based on the one-step spin-coating deposition method, which changed into a cuboidal morphology by using a sequential two-step method. Recently, the bulk perovskite layer has settled down as a representative morphology for efficient PSCs by using either anti-solvent or adduct methods. In addition, other technologies have also been developed to deal with the large-scale processing of the perovskite layer for commercialization to avoid the spin-coating method, which is still the most widely used for lab-scale devices.
2.1. Dot and cuboidal morphology: one-step and sequential two-step based methods
Halide perovskites were firstly employed in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) as light harvesters,13,14 showing a semi-spherical (∼ca. 2 nm) morphology of perovskite formation on TiO2 particles, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The semi-spherical dot morphology was simply obtained by using a single polar solvent for the perovskite precursor solution (Fig. 1(c)), which is called the one-step method. The one-step method was similarly applied to the first configuration of PSCs where the efficiency and stability of the device were significantly enhanced. Two main changes shown in the first PSCs were the incorporation of a thinner mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) film as an electron transport layer (ETL) and the replacement of the liquid electrolyte with solid-state 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) as a hole transport layer (HTL) (Fig. 1(b)).1 The high absorption coefficient of the perovskite, based on its beneficial electronic band structure with a direct p–p transition bandgap, enabled the thickness of the mp-TiO2 film to be significantly reduced from the μm-scale13,14 to the hundreds of nm-scale,4 which substantially suppressed recombination, and was responsible for the enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF).1 Furthermore, the instability of perovskite in liquid-type DSCs was overcome by replacing the electrolyte with a solid-state HTL, spiro-MeOTAD. Based on the one-step method, randomly infiltrated perovskite domains, aside from the dot morphology, could also be formed inside the pores of mesoporous film.15 Importantly, a peculiar behavior of the perovskite was observed from femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements for perovskite deposited on either a TiO2 or an Al2O3 substrate.1 The perovskite material deposited on Al2O3 was fully responsible for relaxation of the bleaching of the perovskite absorption (483 nm) because no electron transfer was expected from perovskite to Al2O3. Nevertheless, similar relaxation dynamics were monitored from the perovskite deposited on TiO2, which would have induced faster relaxation by extracting the excited electrons from the conduction band of the perovskite, implying the possibility of the existence of free charge (electron) in the perovskite material. This concept was later verified by in-depth fundamental studies, such as the capacitance change in the perovskite16 and ambipolar characteristics of the perovskite.6

In the meantime, the ambipolar charge transfer in the perovskite material was revealed, showing long-range balanced electron and hole diffusion,7 which opened up the possibility of bulky perovskite morphology in the device configuration. A two-step method was devised by using a sequential deposition of PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (MAI) (Fig. 1(c)),15,17–19 where the resultant morphology of the perovskite was cuboidal, as can be seen in Fig. 1(d). It was noted that the optimized device configuration for the two-step method contained an even further decreased mp-TiO2 thickness of ca. 150 nm, leaving the bulky perovskite cuboids above the mp-TiO2 layer after filling its voids with perovskite (Fig. 1(d) and (e)).
The cuboidal size was fully controllable by changing the concentration of MAI solution or reaction temperature, which can be explained by a thermodynamic model for the two-step process.20 In particular, varying the concentration of MAI solution is a facile and effective way to control the cuboid size, where large cuboids were grown from a low concentration of MAI solution (0.038 M) due to the sparsely distributed seed crystals (Fig. 2(a)), while a high concentration of MAI solution (0.063 M) produced a large population of seed crystals from the beginning of the reaction, which inhibited the crystal from growing (Fig. 2(b)).18 The cuboid size influenced the light harvesting efficiency. Efficient light harvesting was observed from the densely populated crystals being large enough to utilize internal light scattering in the longer wavelength region (green-red). The highest photovoltaic performance was accordingly obtained from an intermediate cuboid size by compromises in light harvesting, hole mobility and charge recombination.18

Moreover, the crystallinity of PbI2, which could be determined by the temperature of the substrate for PbI2 deposition, was also found to affect the cuboidal size of the perovskite.19 Higher PbI2 crystallinity retarded the reaction with MAI and resulted in bigger cuboids during a longer reaction period. The full conversion of PbI2 into perovskite was, however, hardly to be expected. Therefore, a decent pre-heating temperature of 50 °C for the mp-TiO2 substrate was required to obtain full coverage of perovskite over the mp-TiO2 film, with PbI2 well-infiltrated into the mesoporous pores, even under high humidity.19
2.2. Bulk layer: anti-solvent and adduct methods
The bulky cuboid perovskite still left room for improvement. Even though the two-step method had been carefully optimized for the complete conversion of PbI2 to perovskite with full coverage over the mp-TiO2 film, there still existed a certain possibility not only of unreacted PbI2 remaining deep at the bottom,19 but also of mp-TiO2 being exposed to the HTL, which is liable to accelerate recombination.21 In this regard, the solvent-induced fast crystallization-deposition (FDC) method, widely called the anti-solvent method, was introduced in 2014 where the anti-solvent (e.g. chlorobenzene) was used as a second solvent, leading to fast crystallization based on swift nucleation.22 In Fig. 3(a), a schematic illustration of the anti-solvent method is shown in comparison with the conventional one-step method. An excessive amount of perovskite precursor solution was firstly removed during the initial spinning, which was followed by dropping of the anti-solvent while spinning. When the anti-solvent was dropped, most of the solvent in the residual precursor solution on the spinning substrate was forced to be instantly removed due to a sudden decrease in solubility, resulting in a dense and uniform perovskite film after mild annealing at 100 °C, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Remarkably, perovskite grains spanning the whole cross-sectional perovskite film, without any horizontal grain boundary (Fig. 3(c)), were confirmed to be single crystals, which was definitely beneficial for charge-transfer across the perovskite bulk layer.

Conventional spin-coating (top) results in a shiny gray film composed of non-uniform large crystals as a result of slow crystallization. In the FDC process (bottom), a second solvent (e.g. chlorobenzene) introduced on top of the wet film during the spin-coating process induces fast crystallization of uniformly sized perovskite grains.

A more systematic approach was tried to obtain high-quality perovskite through the formation of an intermediate adduct phase.23,24 Mixed solvents, γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), were used to induce the intermediate phase of MAI–PbI2–DMSO by removing GBL and excess DMSO via toluene dripping,23 similar to the anti-solvent method. The formation of the intermediate phase effectively retarded the rapid crystallization of the perovskite, unlike the anti-solvent method, and produced an extremely homogeneous film showing a root mean square roughness of 8.3 nm with 100–500 nm-sized grains. The method was further elaborated with an understanding of the mechanism based on Lewis base adduct formation, raising the PCE from 16.7% to 19.7%.24 The lone pair electrons on the oxygen in DMSO as well as the iodide in MAI are prone to interact with Pb2+, producing a stable Lewis-base and acid-adduct of MAI–PbI2–DMSO, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) in Fig. 4(a) and (b), in which the wavenumber responsible for SO stretching decreased with the weakening of the bond strength by adduct formation.25 The perovskite precursor solution was prepared based on mixed solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF) and DMSO, containing a molar ratio of MAI:PbI2:DMSO = 1:1:1 for efficient adduct formation. Diethyl ether was chosen as a dripping solvent after considering the miscibility of DMSO with toluene and chlorobenzene, which selectively removed only DMF during the spinning, leaving DMSO for adduct formation, as indicated by a transparent film in Fig. 4(c). The MAI–PbI2–DMSO adduct converted to perovskite at 100 °C, showing a mirror-like dark film (Fig. 4(d)), indicative of a highly planar surface (Fig. 4(e) and (f)). The efficient charge extraction with an outstanding carrier mobility of 3.93 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the perovskite was accounted for by the improved quality of the perovskite layer via the adduct method.

Other polar aprotic solvents containing sulfur or nitrogen can also act as the Lewis base by donating a lone pair electrons on S or N.25 Thiourea was considered as the Lewis base for formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite.26 The adduct formation of formamidinium iodide (FAI)–PbI2–thiourea was confirmed by FTIR in a similar manner, showing a shift toward a lower wavenumber for the SC vibration, as expected. Owing to the higher temperature required to remove the thiourea (175.4 °C), a mixed-adduct system based on thiourea and DMSO was applied to induce the adduct for FAPbI3. The grain size of the perovskite was rapidly increased by increasing the ratio of thiourea in the adduct, FAI–PbI2–(DMSO1−XthioureaX). The coverage of perovskite was, however, worsened by increasing the thiourea-based adduct, which enhanced the exposure of the substrate to HTL. The best performance was obtained when the ratio between DMSO and thiourea was 8:2 (x = 0.2), reaching a grain size ranging from 1 to 4 μm (Fig. 5(a) and (b)) with an improved carrier lifetime of 31.3 ns (Fig. 5(e)), compared to a grain size between 10 nm and 1 μm (Fig. 5(c) and (d)) and a carrier lifetime of 17.7 ns (Fig. 5(e)) for the single adduct based on FAI–PbI2–DMSO without the addition of thiourea.

In summary, Fig. 6 shows an increase in efficiency with respect to the perovskite deposition method, indicating resultant morphology improvement from dots to a well-developed bulk layer.

2.3. Other technologies
Various technologies have been introduced to achieve a high-quality perovskite film via different approaches. In the solution process, it was found that the inclusion of additives such as polymers36 or small molecules37 in the perovskite precursor solution could improve the perovskite morphology, closely related to nucleation during crystal development. In particular, the progress in the technology for large-scale devices is noticeable.38 The dripping of anti-solvent during spinning with a spin-coater prevents large substrates being used. Alternative drying methods for the removal of a solvent from the perovskite precursor solution have been suggested. A vacuum flash-assisted solution process successfully demonstrated a highly smooth and crystalline perovskite film by replacing the anti-solvent dripping with a flash-vacuum to remove the solvent.30 Flash infrared annealing also led to micrometer-sized perovskite grains with a short irradiation time of less than 2 s.39 In terms of scalable-deposition methods (>10 cm2) using a perovskite ink, the blade coating method has shown promising results,40,41 especially coupled with surfactant-controlled solvent evaporation, demonstrating a PCE of 14.6% from a 57 cm2 area.41 Recently, ink-jet printing has been also tried for a scalable wet-coating process.42
3. Compositional advances in perovskites
The hybrid halide perovskite has an ABX3 structure where A and B are cations and X is a halide. The B cation (Pb2+ or Sn2+) and X halide (Cl−, Br− or I−) participate in building a corner-sharing BX6 octahedron, while the A cation (MA+, FA+ or Cs+) is locked in an octahedral cage by coordinating with a 12-fold X in the unit cell.43 The formability of the 3D perovskite can be easily assumed by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) based on the effective ionic radii (r) of each component (A, B or X in ABX3), t = (rA + rX)/[√2(rB + rX)],44 suggesting the possibility of compositional engineering of the perovskite as long as the tolerance factor (t) satisfies a stable 3D structure, ranging from 0.8 to 0.9.45 One of the strongest benefits of compositional engineering in a perovskite is the possibility of tuning the bandgap in the visible range window.46 Nevertheless, here we approach compositional engineering from the perspective of establishing a stable perovskite phase with an excellent photo-electrical property for high PCE, maintaining a bandgap of around 1.6 eV for efficient light harvesting over the whole visible light region.
3.1. From single cation to mixed-cation lead halide perovskite
The MAPbI3 perovskite has been the most standard perovskite composition for PSCs since MAPbI3-based PSCs appeared in 2012.1,2 Therefore, studies on the fundamental physics of perovskites have mostly been carried out with MAPbI3 perovskite.4–10,16 Morphological progress in perovskites, as discussed in the previous section, has also been predominantly led by MAPbI3. Meanwhile, FAPbI3 appeared to be a strong candidate, anticipating a formable structure with a higher tolerance factor than MAPbI3.47 The band structure of lead iodide perovskite is usually dominated by lead and halide, where the antibonding of Pb-6s and I-5p is responsible for the valence band maximum while the conduction band minimum is mostly determined by the bonding orbitals of Pb-6p.48 The cation, however, indirectly influences the band structure by being involved in the lattice expansion/contraction or tilting the PbI6 cages.48 The replacement of MA+ with FA+ induces a lattice expansion, leading to an improvement in symmetry from the tetragonal phase for MAPbI3 to the cubic phase for FAPbI3. Consequently, the strong overlapping antibonding in higher symmetry FAPbI3 is expected to produce a reduced bandgap, 1.52 eV for MAPbI3 and 1.45 eV for FAPbI3,49 being close to the ideal band gap of 1.34 eV referred to as the Shockley–Queisser limit.50,51
A promising result of PSCs based on FAPbI3 was achieved by suppressing the growth of the non-perovskite yellow phase during crystallization.47Fig. 7(a) shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of FAPbI3 with respect to the annealing temperature for the perovskite film. The yellow phase (δ-phase) existing at 100 °C disappeared at higher temperature, demonstrating the best performance after annealing at 150 °C. Further performance enhancement resulted from employing a thin layer of MAPbI3 on top of the FAPbI3 layer based on the two-step coating method (Fig. 7(b)), which allowed the weak incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) near 700 nm of FAPbI3 to be increased while still taking advantage of the expanded light absorption window of the FAPbI3 layer (Fig. 7(c)). The comparable high PCE (Fig. 7(d)), in 2014, confirmed the potential of FAPbI3 for PSCs.

Despite the promising potential of FAPbI3, FAPbI3-based PSCs have not been preferred, mainly due to the instability of the black polymorph FAPbI3 (α-phase), which is inclined to turn into the non-perovskite yellow phase (δ-phase), especially in a humid atmosphere.52 Compositional engineering has been seriously promoted to stabilize the α-phase to fully utilize the benefit of the FAPbI3 perovskite without compromising phase stability. The mixed-cation perovskite form of MA0.4FA0.6PbI3 revealed that the mixed-cation system not only effectively suppressed the undesirable formation of the δ-phase, but also increased light harvesting and carrier lifetime.53 A more pronounced structural stability of the FAPbI3 α-phase was fulfilled by adopting a mixed-cation and mixed-anion perovskite, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15.31 As shown in Fig. 8(a), the δ-phase of FAPbI3 was partially avoided by establishing a mixed-cation (FA0.85MA0.15PbI3) or mixed-anion (FAPb(I0.85Br0.15)3) perovskite system, which eventually showed a synergetic effect by incorporating both a mixed-cation and a mixed-anion system, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, showing a high crystallinity of the α-phase without forming the δ-phase. On the other hand, Cs+ (1.81 Å) was also strategically substituted for FA+ (2.79 Å) to stabilize the overall lattice structure of FAPbI3 perovskite (α-phase) by inducing a partial shrinkage of the unit cell to strengthen the interaction between Pb and I.54 In Fig. 8(b), FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 has a full α-phase perovskite with highly enhanced (110) and (220) peaks, implying preferentially oriented crystal growth perpendicular to the (110) plane with a large crystal size.54 Consequently, Cs-containing FAPbI3 (FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3) resulted in outstanding photo-stability, by taking advantage of FA+ preventing proton releasing, and moisture-stability, by avoiding formation of the δ-phase. The enhanced structure stability by mixing the cations was also well supported in terms of entropy, where the mixed-cation system in the α-phase energetically prevails over mixing cations in the δ-phase, leading to a reduction in free energy.55

It was found that small cations, especially Cs+, had a significant effect on stabilizing the 3D FAPbI3 perovskite structure based on the favorable entropy gain from the mixed-cation system.31,53–55 A similar approach has been taken with different combinations of cations and anions. A Cs+ cation was introduced into the (FAPbI3)1−X(MAPbBr3)X perovskite, showing the most optimized composition of Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3.56 Furthermore, superior thermal stability was observed from the triple cation (Cs+, MA+ and FA+)-based lead iodide perovskite, which was further enhanced by adding Br− into the halide site. The highest stabilized PCE of 21.1% with an improved stability (85.3% of initial PCE after 250 h under full sun with maximum power point tracking) was obtained from Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3, based on the anti-solvent adduct method.56 In this regard, the rubidium cation (Rb+) was also explored to boost PCE and the stability of the perovskite the majority of which stayed in FA+ and I−. The quadruple cation (Rb+, Cs+, MA+ and FA+)-based and double anion (Br− and I−)-based PSCs performed with 21.6% of stabilized PCE with an outstanding thermal stability (95% of initial PCE remained at 85 °C for 500 h under full sun with maximum power point tracking).57 Surprisingly, a small potential loss of 0.39 eV, 1.24 V of open circuit voltage from 1.63 eV of bandgap, was monitored from the quadruple mixed-cation and double mixed-anion perovskites, indicative of subtle nonradiative recombination in the PSC.57 Recently, a mixed perovskite, but MA- and Br-free, (RbXCsYFA1−X−YPbI3) has been newly proposed as a promising perovskite composition where the thermal instability of MAI and a loss in bandgap by Br incorporation were completely avoided. The most promising composition was identified as Rb0.05Cs0.1FA0.85PbI3, suggesting that the structural stability of FAPbI3 can be sufficiently assured by incorporating inorganic cations of Cs+ and Rb+ without the aid of MA+ or Br−.58 In summary, Fig. 9 shows the improvement in efficiency with respect to the compositional change in the perovskite, underlining the importance of compositional engineering in the perovskite on the basis of its evolved morphology.

3.2. Nonstoichiometric composition
Solution-processed PSCs enable a complicated perovskite composition to be facilitated through minute control over the precursor solution, which seems hardly practical in the vacuum deposition process or a similar gas-state transfer method. Relying on the facile manipulation of the composition in the solution process, a non-stoichiometric composition between an organo-halide (e.g. MAI) and PbI2 has been planned and some interesting advantages in charge-transfer in the perovskite can be drawn. The beneficial effect of a PbI2-enriched surface, formed either by degradation or by unreacted components from the two-step process, was attributed to passivation of the surface states of the perovskite,32,33 which, however, contradicts the argument that PbI2 employing a high defect level was detrimental to the photovoltaic performance.65 PSCs showing a high PCE (∼20%) based on (FAXPbI2+X)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 with the anti-solvent adduct method were investigated to obtain a reliable effect of PbI2 in the perovskite layer. The highest PCE was obtained from PbI2/FAI = 1.05 (mol mol−1) mainly due to suppressed non-radiative recombination, particularly near the mp-TiO2 substrate, leading to an improved open-circuit voltage with a high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL = 0.5%) at a comparably low voltage of 1.5 V.59 Interestingly, the MAPbI3 perovskite with an excess of MAI, on the other hand, also significantly inhibited non-radiative recombination.34,66,67 A thin layer formed from excessive 6 mol% MAI was observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The thin film showed a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of the MAI crystal on the grain boundary of the MAPbI3.34 This was consistent with a negligible change in absorbance spectra or the XRD pattern of the perovskite film irrespective of the excess MAI, indicating no interference with the MAPbI3 perovskite crystal by the unreacted MAI. The self-formed MAI crystal on the perovskite grain boundary was found to prolong the carrier lifetime by suppressing the non-radiative recombination, mediated at the surface, while establishing an ionic-conducting pathway for efficient charge extraction. Moreover, a favorable energy-level tuning at the interface of MAI-excess MAPbI3 perovskite adjacent to the HTL was also proposed as an underlying mechanism, as evidenced by results from photoelectron spectroscopy, which resulted in efficient hole extraction at the interface adjacent to the HTL.66
4. Summary and outlook
PSCs have developed remarkably within a few years with a tremendous input from the perovskite field as well as from other related fields. In this review, the morphological and compositional development of halide perovskites has been chronologically discussed to understand the overall progress in PSCs and to gain insight into the future development of PSCs. In terms of morphological evolution, the perovskite layer has evolved significantly from an inhomogeneous dot and cuboid morphology to a uniform bulk layer showing high crystallinity owing to developments in the deposition method. Progress has also been made in composition, in parallel with the morphology, from the single composition of MAPbI3 to hybrid perovskites based on mixed-cations and mixed-halides. Regardless of the huge advances in perovskite material for more efficient and robust performance, PSCs still need intensive research to ensure their long-term stability to satisfy the stringent criteria for industrialization. There is no doubt that the key material to be preferentially considered for high efficiency and long-term stability is perovskite. Strongly secured photo-, thermal- and bias-stability of perovskite material over the long-term must be achieved by making it free from unstable electronic or lattice structures (e.g. photo-induced traps, thermal degradation, bias-induced ion migration, etc.) through further compositional engineering. In the meantime, the stability of the remnant components of PSCs should also be assured by reinforcing them or simply replacing them with optimal candidates, as inspired by other fields. Furthermore, the importance of the perovskite interface with selective contacts has been emphasized for dealing with non-radiative recombination to enhance the fill factor and open-circuit voltage toward their theoretical values. In spite of these formidable challenges, the future looks promising considering the consistent progress that has been made in the long-term stability of PSCs with the aid of customized interfaces and selective contacts with enhanced perovskite stability by compositional engineering.
