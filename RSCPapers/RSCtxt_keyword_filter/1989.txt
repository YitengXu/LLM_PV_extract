    , Accepted 15th September 2017First published on 18th September 2017AbstractOxygen vacancies in non-stoichiometric TiO2 electron transport layers can capture injected electrons and act as recombination centers. In this study, the compact TiO2 electron transport layers of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are doped with different molar ratios of Fe3+ in order to passivate such defects and improve their electron transport properties. The electrical conductivity, absorption, crystal structure, and the performance of the PSCs are systematically studied. It shows that Fe3+-doping improves the conductivity of TiO2 compact layers compared with the pristine TiO2, boosting the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The reduced trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) of the Fe3+-doped TiO2 compact layers suggests that trap density in the Fe3+-TiO2 films is much lower than that of a pristine TiO2 film. With the optimized doping concentration (1 mol%) of Fe3+, the best power conversion efficiency of PSCs is improved from 16.02% to 18.60%.
1. Introduction
The past several years have witnessed the fast development of a brand-new type of solar cell based on organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials.1,2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 22.1% since it was first reported in 2009.3–8 For PSCs, electron transport layers (ETLs) play a significant role in transporting electrons and blocking holes. In the vast majority of PSCs, TiO2 is the preferred material for ETLs because of its superior electronic properties.9–12 For example, the conduction band of TiO2 matches well with that of the perovskite active layers. Meanwhile, TiO2 is low-cost, compatible with various deposition methods, chemically stable and highly conductive.12–17 However, there exist oxygen vacancies, Ti interstitial sites, and trap states in TiO2 ETLs, which can capture injected electrons and act as recombination centers. As a result, these defects and trap states dramatically degrade the efficiency and stability of devices.18–21 Therefore, fabrication of a TiO2 ETL with reduced oxygen vacancies and defects is critical to improve the charge extraction and collection of PSCs.
Previous works have demonstrated that electron transport in TiO2 can be effectively enhanced by doping suitable metal ions. In 2014, Snaith's group doped Al into a TiO2 compact layer and found that the conductivity of the TiO2 compact layer was increased by several orders of magnitude due to reduced oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 ETL.20 Zhou et al. reported that yttrium-doped TiO2 compact layers improved the conductivity and carrier extraction ability of the ETLs, and enhanced the cell's PCE to 19.3%.22 In addition, Zn-doped, Nb-doped, Mg-doped and Li-doped TiO2 ETLs have also been reported.23–28 However, a very limited study has been reported on Fe-doped TiO2 ETLs for perovskite solar cells. Previous studies of Fe-doped TiO2 were devoted to improving the photocatalytic properties, visible light activity or tuning the band-gap structure of TiO2 rather than enhancing its electrical properties for applications in PSCs.29–31 For example, Yalcin et al. found that visible light activity and photocatalytic properties of TiO2 particles were improved by Fe3+-doping and the same result was reported by Zhu et al.29,32 Fe3+ has the same valence as Al3+ and Y3+ and a similar radius to Ti4+ (Fe3+ = 0.064 nm, Ti4+ = 0.068 nm).33 Therefore, Fe3+ cations can penetrate into the TiO2 lattice and substitute Ti cations.29 One would expect that Fe3+-doped TiO2 ETLs could lead to further improved photovoltaic performance of PSCs compared with other doped ETLs.
In this work, we doped TiO2 compact layers with Fe3+ ions (Fe3+-TiO2) and used them as ETLs for perovskite solar cells. The Fe3+-doped TiO2 precursor solution can be obtained easily through mixing the Fe(NO3)3 solution with TiO2 solution in appropriate proportion, including 0.5 mol%, 1 mol%, 2 mol%, and 5 mol%. As a result of Fe3+ doping, we demonstrate that the conductivity increases significantly by an order of magnitude and the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) of the Fe3+-doped TiO2 compact layers obviously decreases compared with the pure TiO2 compact layers.34 Consequently, we obtain a high efficiency of 18.01% for MAPbI3-based solar cells and 18.6% for Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based cells. The results reported in this work demonstrate that the performance of PSCs can be enhanced by doping TiO2 compact layers with Fe3+ ions.
2. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, the mesoporous-structured perovskite solar cells, consisting of FTO/Fe3+-TiO2 (or TiO2)/meso-TiO2/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, are fabricated. Fig. 1b and c are the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the pristine TiO2 and 1 mol% Fe3+-TiO2 layers. The results show that both the Fe3+-TiO2 and pure TiO2 compact layers are uniform and homogeneous. The SEM cross-sectional image of a PSC in Fig. 1d shows that perovskite thin films with large crystalline grains are prepared. Fig. 1e exhibits that the color of the Fe3+-TiO2 solution gradually changes to red with the increase of the doping concentration. In order to investigate the distribution of Fe elements, we recorded the energy dispersive spectra (EDS) at five separated positions for the 5 mol% Fe3+-TiO2 film (≈700 nm). As displayed in Fig. S1, S2 (ESI†) and Table 1, the atomic ratios of Fe/Ti at five positions show a small difference, and the obtained average atomic ratio in EDS analysis is 6.4%. The EDS result confirms that the Fe element is homogeneously distributed within TiO2 films.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement is conducted to elucidate the lattice structure. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the TiO2 compact layers doped with different doping concentrations are of anatase phase. This is because the ionic radius of Fe3+ is very similar to Ti4+, and the Fe3+ dopants cannot change the lattice parameter of TiO2. In Fig. 2b, the absorption of Fe3+-TiO2 compact films shows an enhanced visible light activity or a red shift. The absorbance increases with the increase of the Fe3+ doping concentration. This has been attributed to the formation of a Fe-dopant energy level within the band gap of TiO2.29,31,32,35 XRD patterns of MAPbI3 thin films on doped and undoped TiO2 compact layers shown in Fig. 2c reveal an identical crystalline structure as reported in the previous literature.36 The absorption shown in Fig. 2d implies that Fe3+-doping of TiO2 compact layers indicates negligible effects on the absorption of MAPbI3 thin films in the range of visible light.

(c) XRD patterns of MAPbI3 thin films with doped and pure TiO2 compact layers. (d) Absorption lines of the cells with the following structure: FTO/TiO2 or Fe3+-TiO2/MAPbI3. 
The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves shown in Fig. 3a reveal that the PSCs doped with 1 mol% Fe3+ yield the best performance. As shown in Fig. 3b, it is known that oxygen vacancies or Ti interstitials are the predominant non-stoichiometry defects in TiO2 lattices, resulting in the conversion of Ti4+ to Ti3+.37–40 Therefore, Ti3+ defects can induce a shallow energy level below the conduction band and act as electron trap sites, which can capture electrons and reduce electron transport efficiency and conductivity of TiO2. Based on the above analysis and previous literature, as shown in Fig. 3c, two Fe3+ can substitute two Ti3+ adjacent to an oxygen defect. Consequently, this substitution effectively passivates or removes oxygen vacancy defects or traps in TiO2 compact layers. The Fe3+-doping mechanism is consistent with that of Al-doped TiO2. This conclusion is supported by the increased conductivity and decreased trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) of TiO2 compact layer thin films in the following study.

(d) XPS spectra of pristine TiO2 and Fe3+-TiO2. (e) XPS spectra of O 1s peaks for pristine TiO2 and 1 mol% Fe3+-TiO2 samples. (f) XPS spectra of Ti 2p peaks. 
To explore the role of Fe3+-doping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out. Fig. 3d shows the XPS spectra of the Fe3+-doped and undoped TiO2 samples. The binding energies in the range 710.4–712.3 eV and 724.0–724.5 eV should be assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Fe3+ cations.35,41 The signal of Fe 2p3/2 (1 mol% Fe3+-TiO2) is weak due to the low doping level, but still obvious compared with the pristine TiO2. The result indicates that Fe elements doped into the TiO2 lattice are in a trivalent valence state. The atomic ratios of Fe/Ti for pristine and Fe3+-doped TiO2 are shown in Table 2 and the survey XPS spectra are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). In Fig. 3e, the binding energy of the O 1s peak centered at 529.13 eV and 529.19 eV can be ascribed to TiO2. The smaller peaks at 531.02 eV and 531.21 eV may be assigned to the surface hydroxyl groups or chemisorbed water molecules.32 The slightly higher O 1s binding energy for the Fe3+-doped sample further suggests the linkage of the Fe–O–Ti bond in Fe3+-TiO2. Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks for all samples in Fig. 3f are located at binding energies of 457.96 eV and 463.63 eV, respectively. Perhaps, due to the low concentration of Fe3+, the shift of Ti 2p peaks is below the detection limit.

It is demonstrated that the transport of photogenerated electrons in films is limited by space-charge effects.34 The density of free carriers is reduced when the trap centers capture the photogenerated free carriers, leading to a smaller current with a small slope at a low bias voltage. However, as the voltage is continuously increased, all the traps are filled. The current quickly increases nonlinearly with a higher slope if the bias voltage exceeds the kink point. The kink point is the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). So we can estimate the values of VTFL by calculating the intersection of the two slopes. Furthermore, VTFL can be determined by the trap-state density (Nt). (1)where e is the elementary charge of the electron, d and ε are the thickness and relative dielectric constant of the active layer, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity.42 According to eqn (1), we can see that VTFL increases with the increase of trap density.
To confirm whether doping Fe3+ can effectively reduce the trap density in the TiO2 compact layers, we measured the log–log plot of I–V curves for Fe3+-doped and undoped devices with a structure shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. The nonlinear curve in Fig. 4a indicates the existence of space charges, e.g. Ti interstitials, oxygen vacancies, etc. For the best Fe3+-doping condition, the I–V curve is more linear. VTFL of 1 mol% Fe3+-TiO2 is estimated to be 0.45 V, which is pretty lower than that of pure TiO2 (0.64 V) and Fig. 4a shows a significant difference in current between doped and pristine samples. The result demonstrates that the trap-state density in the Fe3+-TiO2 film is much lower than that in a pristine TiO2 film. The reason is possibly because Fe3+-doping suppresses space charges and increases the carrier density and conductivity of TiO2. These can be verified from the results of the Hall Effect measurements. The conductivity versus dopant concentration curves and the results of the Hall Effect are shown in the inset of Fig. 4a and Table S1 (ESI†). Table S1 (ESI†) shows that the conductivity of Fe3+-doped TiO2 is increased by an order of magnitude compared with pristine TiO2, which is possibly caused by the increased carrier density and reduced trap states in ETLs.

Fig. 4b is the hysteresis curve of the cells. Under the best doping concentration of Fe3+, a high PCE of 18.01% from reverse scan and 17.22% from forward scan for CH3NH3PbI3-based cells are obtained. We observed a slight reduction in hysteresis compared with the undoped devices. This may be attributed to Fe3+ ions passivating the electronic defects or trap states caused by non-stoichiometric oxygen-induced defects within the TiO2 lattice. The passivation enhanced the extraction of free electrons and suppressed the cell's hysteresis.19,20Fig. 4c shows a steady-state current density of 20.15 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 17.12% after 150 s operation at a bias voltage of 0.83 V from the reverse scan direction for the Fe3+-TiO2/MAPbI3-based cell, whereas the TiO2-based control cell displays a steady-state current density of 16.24 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 14.13% at a bias voltage of 0.77 V. Fig. 4d shows that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the Fe3+-doped device is much higher than the undoped one. The highest value for the Fe3+-doped device is almost 91%, which is mainly due to enhanced electron extraction via using Fe3+-TiO2. The integrated Jsc value for Fe3+-doped and undoped devices in Fig. 4d is 22.06 mA cm−2 and 20.19 mA cm−2, respectively. According to Table 3, the PSCs with 1 mol% Fe3+-TiO2 compact layers exhibit the best performance. Voc, Jsc and FF increase from 1.02 V to 1.06 V, from 22.03 mA cm−2 to 23.22 mA cm−2, and from 63.25% to 66.68% (mean values with reverse scan). As a result, the average PCE increased from 14.59% to 17.01%.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is utilized to investigate the charge-transport process and carrier recombination of the TiO2-based perovskite cells. The inset in Fig. 4e is an equivalent circuit of the cells and our test frequency is from 1 Hz to 1 MHz under 1 Sun illumination. The parameters of carrier transport and recombination in PSCs are fitted by analyzing Nyquist curves. Normally, there are two arcs on the Nyquist curve, where the first arc at a high frequency is related to the transport and extraction in the cathode and the second arc is related to the recombination process between different layers.43–45 The Nyquist plot in Fig. 4e and parameters in Table S2 (ESI†) show that recombination resistance of Fe3+-TiO2-based cells at interfaces between different films is significantly larger than TiO2-based cells. Since a larger recombination resistance indicates a lower recombination loss, this result illustrates that the recombination process is effectively suppressed for Fe3+-TiO2-based cells. It further manifests that Fe3+-TiO2 has fewer trapping centers and improved interface properties (more information about the Nyquist plot can be obtained from the ESI†).
Furthermore, to determine the junction property of the cell, a model based on the single heterojunction solar cell is adopted.46 In a heterojunction solar cell, the value of the ideality factor (N) represents the quality of a junction and the carrier recombination mechanisms. The smaller value of N, the less recombination caused by defect in the cell. The calculation method of N can be found in the ESI† and Fig. S4 is the box plot of N at different doping concentrations. In our experiment, we calculated N for doped and undoped samples under light conditions shown in Fig. 4f and Table 3, and the mean values of 1 mol% Fe3+-TiO2 and pure TiO2 perovskite cells are 2.95 and 3.99, respectively. We can see that the former is much smaller than the latter, which probably means that the carrier recombination in Fe3+-TiO2 cells is reduced due to the reduction of trap states in the doped TiO2 compact layers.

Fig. 5a–d are the statistics of Voc, FF, Jsc, and PCE of 100 devices based on different doping conditions. The statistical distributions of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE for the TiO2 and Fe3+-TiO2 based cells in Fig. 5 show that 1 mol% Fe3+-doped cells exhibit higher photovoltaic parameters compared with the others. Thus, photovoltaic performance of the cells can be effectively improved by doping Fe3+ in the ETLs. The stability of MAPbI3-based cells tested for three weeks in the dark is provided, as shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†). The devices were exposed directly to the air without encapsulation (25–35% relative humidity (RH), 25 °C). It has been demonstrated that the degradation of PSCs is mainly ascribed to the decomposition of perovskites in air.47 As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the perovskite solar cells based on Fe3+-doped and pristine TiO2 exhibited similar performance deterioration.

We also fabricated Cs/FA/MA-based PSCs with Fe3+-doped compact layers as reported by Saliba.48 In Fig. S7a (ESI†), the device yields a high PCE of 18.60% from reverse scan and 17.88% from forward scan under best doping concentrations, whereas the TiO2-based control devices exhibited a PCE of 16.02% and 14.86% respectively. In addition, Fig. S7b (ESI†) shows a steady-state current density of 20.75 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 17.6% for Fe3+-doped Cs/FA/MA-based cells after 150 s operation from the reverse scan direction at a bias voltage of 0.84 V. The results demonstrate that the high performance of Fe3+-TiO2-based PSCs is repeatable. Detailed parameters of the devices are presented in the inset table of Fig. S7a (ESI†).
3. Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated MAPbI3-based and Cs/FA/MA-based perovskite solar cells by doping compact TiO2 layers with different Fe3+ concentrations. Due to the reduction of electron trap density, the Fe3+-doped TiO2 compact layers show enhanced conductivity and reduced VTFL. Therefore, Fe3+-doped compact TiO2 films extract photogenerated electrons more efficiently. As a result, cells with doped ETLs are successfully improved compared with cells with pristine TiO2. Finally, the PCE is improved from 14.59% to 18.01% for MAPbI3-based cells, while the PCE of Cs/FA/MA-based cells is increased from 16.02% to 18.6%. So Fe3+ doped TiO2 compact layers provide a feasible way to fabricate high performance PSCs.
