    , Accepted 6th October 2020First published on 8th October 2020AbstractAchieving high-efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) with long-term thermal stability is a major challenge toward commercialization. In the present study, a ternary blend strategy was employed to improve the thermal stability of OSCs with a novel small molecular acceptor ITC6-2F serving as the second acceptor. Compared with its parent compound ITC6-IC, the introduction of fluoro substituents at the two end groups can reduce the π–π stacking distance and enhance the intermolecular interactions in films. The PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6:ITC6-2F-based ternary blend film exhibits a reduced lamellar distance and an increased crystalline coherence length, compared to the corresponding binary blend films. Photo-physics and device physics analyses demonstrate that the charge-transfer state energy is dominated by PBDB-T and IDT-PDOT-C6 in the ternary OSCs. Also, ITC6-2F can facilitate the photonic energy transfer to IDT-PDOT-C6 and promote more excitons to reach the donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces to achieve high-efficiency photoelectric conversion. More importantly, the enhanced intermolecular interactions and good miscibility between the two acceptors help to “freeze” the film morphology, leading to a significantly improved long-term thermal stability. The device efficiency remained at 80.3% of its initial value after 137 days of continuous heating at 75 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box, which is a record result for high-efficiency OSCs reported so far.
Introduction
Nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted wide attention in recent years due to their rapid increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and potential as low-cost, light-weight, flexible systems that are compatible with large-area production using roll-to-roll printing.1–7 Nonfullerene acceptors possess high tunability of optoelectronic properties, allowing precise optimization of their charge carrier mobilities, molecular energy levels, and absorption spectra. Additionally, the use of two nonfullerene acceptors and one donor, forming a ternary blend, can further boost the performance of OSCs, due to the broadened absorption spectra, optimized film morphology, and better aligned energy levels of the photo-active layer.8–18 The power conversion efficiency has reached more than 17% in ternary OSCs.19,20
As the PCE of OSCs is getting closer and closer to the required value, more attention should be paid to another important factor for practical applications, namely, the device stability. In general, the device stability can be affected by the electrode oxidation, the interfacial layer breakdown, and the unstable morphology of the active layer, driven by light and/or thermodynamics.21–24 Especially, under operational conditions, solar cells can be heated to ∼65 °C,25,26 and the morphology of the active layer becomes unstable, since the nanophases can transform to oversized aggregates due to the thermal dynamic equilibrium.27,28
The T80 time (defined as the time needed for the PCE to decay to 80% of its initial value) is a key factor used to describe the thermal stability of OSCs. The highest T80 reported for high-efficiency OSCs, heated under similar circumstances, is only ∼1000 h (i.e., 42 days).29 Effective strategies are thus highly needed to improve the T80, namely, the thermal stability of OSCs, which is primarily attributed to the morphology stability of the blend film. As reported, the film morphology can be stabilized via enhancing the intermolecular interactions.30–32 For instance, OSCs based on donor polymers bearing cross-linkable side chains can exhibit better thermal stability in comparison with those based on non-cross-linked ones.33,34 The morphology of a blend film can be locked by hydrogen bonds between 4,4′-biphenol and fluorinated electron donors in fullerene-based OSCs.35 The N–H⋯O noncovalent interactions between ITIC and a dye molecule (SR197) can improve the thermal stability of nonfullerene OSCs.36 Additionally, it has been reported that a third component can be introduced into the active layer, which can not only improve the device efficiency, but also improve the morphology stability of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs.24,37,38 However, the introduction of a third component may not always give positive results; sometimes, the third component could cause miscibility problems in ternary OSCs, which can reduce the device performance.39,40 Therefore, it is important to carefully choose appropriate components for the fabrication of ternary OSCs to achieve long-term device thermal stability for devices.
Here, we report high-efficiency nonfullerene OSCs with record long-term thermal stability by using our previously reported nonfullerene molecule IDT-PDOT-C6 as the acceptor,41PBDB-T as the polymer donor, and a newly synthesized small molecule ITC6-2F as the third component. For comparison, the non-fluorinated compound ITC6-IC and tetrafluoro-substituted compound ITC6-4F were also synthesized and tested for OSCs.42 Since the fluorine atom possesses a strong electron-withdrawing capability,43,44 the introduction of fluoro substituents can enhance the intermolecular electrostatic interactions, reduce the π–π stacking distance, enable ‘freezing’ of the blend film morphology, facilitate the electron transport, and enhance the thermal stability of OSCs. We also found that ITC6-2F is well-miscible with PBDB-T and ITC6-IC in the active layer. By introducing ITC6-2F, the extraction efficiency of the charge carriers was significantly improved, and recombination was suppressed in the ternary OSCs, compared to the corresponding binary devices. As a result, the ternary solar cell outperformed the binary device, with a PCE of 13.36%. More importantly, the ternary PSC showed excellent long-term thermal stability. The PCE remained at 80.3% and ∼70% of its initial value after 137 days and 238 days, respectively, under continuous heating at 75 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The results show that high-efficiency and thermally-stable OSCs can be realized by using a ternary blend strategy.

Fig. 1a shows the molecular structures of organic materials used in the active layer of the OSCs. The donor was PBDB-T, and the acceptors were IDT-PDOT-C6, ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F. As shown in Scheme S1,†ITC6-2F was synthesized in a 72% yield by the Knoevenagel condensation of 3,9-dihexyl-6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydrodithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene 2,8-dicarboxaldehyde (1) and compound 2 in chloroform with pyridine as the catalyst under a nitrogen atmosphere. The chemical structure of ITC6-2F was verified by 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy. ITC6-IC, ITC6-4F, and IDT-PDOT-C6 were prepared according to the reported procedures41,42,45 and used for comparison. The UV-vis absorption behaviors of neat ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, ITC6-4F, IDT-PDOT-C6, and PBDB-T films are depicted in Fig. 1b. Also, the absorption spectra of their 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solutions and blend films are displayed in Fig. S1.† With increasing the number of fluoro substituents, both in the solutions and as films, the main absorption peak of the acceptors was gradually red-shifted due to the enhanced intramolecular charge-transfer effect from the central donor unit to the terminal acceptor unit. When compared with their corresponding solution absorption spectra, the film ones of ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F showed red-shifts of 21, 26, and 38 nm, respectively, indicating that fluoro substitution could enhance the intermolecular interactions and thus cause closer molecular stacking (vide infra). Their absorption spectra were all perfectly complementary to that of PBDB-T and IDT-PDOT-C6, thus being conducive to constructing a ternary device.

The optical band gaps of ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F, calculated from their absorption onsets (776, 787, and 805 nm) were determined to be 1.60, 1.58, and 1.54 eV, respectively. The electrochemical properties of ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F were probed by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The onset reduction/oxidation potentials (Ered/Eox) of ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F were −0.57/+1.37, −0.54/+1.38, and −0.51/+1.39 V (Fig. S2, ESI†), corresponding to HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.72/−3.78, −5.73/−3.81, and −5.74/−3.84 eV, respectively, as calculated by the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −e[Eox/red,onset + 4.8 − E(Fc/Fc+)].46,47 The optical and electrochemical data are shown in Table 1. The energy levels of the electron acceptors and donor are also illustrated in Fig. 1c. It can be seen that fluoro substitution lowered both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels compared with the parent compound ITC6-IC. The absolute fluorescence quantum yields (ηFL) of ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F in CHCl3 solution were determined to be 5.51%, 8.15%, and 6.90%, respectively, among which ITC6-2F demonstrated the highest ηFL value. It should be noted that a high ηFL will be beneficial to reduce the non-radiative energy loss.48

The thermal properties were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S3,† their decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss were 345 °C, 336 °C, and 349 °C for ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F, respectively, indicating their sufficient thermal stability for device fabrication. They did not have visible melting and crystallization peaks in their DSC curves (Fig. S4†). The packing of ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F molecules in the films was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the diffraction peaks of ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F obtained at lower angles were located at 2θ of 5.11°, 5.13°, and 5.42°, corresponding to lamellar stacking distances of 17.28, 17.24, and 16.30 Å, respectively. Diffraction peaks arising from the π–π stacking of the backbones appeared at 2θ of 22.98°, 23.70°, and 25.36°, corresponding to distances of 3.87, 3.75, and 3.51 Å for ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F, respectively (summarized in Table S1, ESI†). These results indicate that fluoro substitution increases the intermolecular interaction to reduce both the lamellar and the π–π stacking distances. The formation of closer packing for ITC6-2F and ITC6-4F in the blend films was beneficial to achieving higher electron mobility (vide infra). Such results well prove the success of our molecular design, i.e., using fluoro substitution to enhance electrostatic interactions among molecules, so that both a fixed morphology and facilitated charge transport can be expected.

Optical and photovoltaic characterization
The photovoltaic properties of OSCs with various nonfullerene acceptors were investigated with a device configuration of Ag (100 nm)/MoO3 (8.5 nm)/active layer (110 nm)/zinc oxide (30 nm)/indium tin oxide (ITO). Our previous work showed that a PCE of 10.67% could be obtained for the PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6-based OSCs (FF = 62.25%, Jsc = 18.94 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.903 V).41 Since ITC6-IC and its fluorinated analogs have a complementary absorption with PBDB-T and IDT-PDOT-C6 (Fig. S1†), they were therefore introduced as the third component in the ternary OSCs to improve the light absorption. Before constructing the ternary OSCs, the device performances of PBDB-T:ITC6-IC/ITC6-2F/ITC6-4F binary systems was evaluated. The effects of different processing conditions, such as thermal annealing, thickness of the active layer, and acceptor to donor weight ratio, on the solar cell performance were systematically investigated. The optimal weight ratio of PBDB-T to the acceptor was found to be 1:1, the optimized thickness was about 110 nm (a spin-coating speed of 1500 rpm), and the processing solvent was DCB. The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 2, and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3a. The ITC6-IC-based binary OSCs gave a PCE of 10.87% (FF = 71.15%, Jsc = 16.24 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.938 V). The ITC6-2F-based devices exhibited a higher PCE of 11.20% (FF = 72.80%, Jsc = 17.83 mA cm−2, and Voc = 0.861 V). Further increasing the number of fluoro atoms in the acceptor, which is the case of ITC6-4F, deteriorated the device performance with a PCE of 10.48% accompanied with a much lower Voc value (0.776 V). Although the LUMO level of ITC6-2F was slightly lower than that of ITC6-IC, the introduction of fluoro substitution could enhance the intermolecular π–π stacking and lower the optical band. Therefore, the electron mobility of PBDB-T:ITC6-2F blends was significantly improved (1.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, see Table S2 and Fig. S6†). Meanwhile, the photon to current response was broadened in solar cells based on ITC6-2F, without significantly decreasing the charge-transfer state energy (which is related to the EHOMO,donor − ELUMO,acceptor gap and determines Voc). As a result, an improved PCE was achieved relative to the solar cell based on the parent compound ITC6-IC. In the case of ITC6-4F, although a further reduced molecular stacking distance and energy bandgap, and increased electron mobility (2.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, see Table S2 and Fig. S6†) and Jsc value were obtained, with a largely reduced Voc, which was due to the lowered LUMO energy level, resulting in the lowest PCE value among these three acceptors.

To further enhance the device efficiency, ITC6-2F was used as the third component to construct ternary OSCs. The weight ratio of PBDB-T to the acceptor was maintained at 1:1, while the ratio between ITC6-2F and IDT-PDOT-C6 was changed. We found that a solar cell based on the ternary blend PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 with a ratio of 1:0.6:0.4 demonstrated the best photovoltaic performance (see Table S3†) with a PCE of 12.23% (FF = 69.83%, Voc = 0.883 V, and Jsc = 19.84 mA cm−2). Compared to the binary devices, the increased Jsc could be attributed to the broadened light absorption. After being annealed at 160 °C for 5 min (which was the optimized temperature, see Table S4†), the PCE of the ternary OSCs was further improved to 13.36%, due to the increased Jsc of 21.73 mA cm−2 and enhanced FF of 72.06%. The Voc of the ternary OSCs was slightly decreased to 0.853 V, compared to the binary OSC. Therefore, as expected, the ternary devices based on ITC6-2F exhibited a higher device efficiency than the binary OSC based on ITC6-IC. It is worth noting that the performance of the ternary OSC based on ITC6-2F was also better than that of the ternary OSC using ITC6-4F as the third component (see Tables S5–S8†).

Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the binary PBDB-T:ITC6-IC/ITC6-2F/ITC6-4F/IDT-PDOT-C6 devices and the ternary PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6:ITC6-2F devices. The binary devices based on PBDB-T:ITC6-IC/ITC6-2F/ITC6-4F had a spectral response in the range of 300–800 nm, which was obviously narrower than those based on PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 (300–900 nm). However, the maximum EQE values were higher, especially for devices based on ITC6-2F (with a maximum EQE of 80%), than that of IDT-PDOT-C6-based binary devices (only 75%). The EQE curve of the as-cast ternary-blend devices (PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6, 1:0.6:0.4) exhibited a wider response range, compared to PBDB-T:ITC6-IC/ITC6-2F/ITC6-4F-based binary devices. The maximum EQE value of the as-cast ternary solar cells was 79%, and it reached 82% after annealing (see Fig. S7a†). Also, the difference spectrum showed that the enhancement in the photoresponse was mainly contributed to by the light absorption in the wavelength range of 650 to 850 nm. The two dominant peaks at 660 and 730 nm were in accordance with the absorption bands of the ITC6-2F film, and the weak shoulder at 810 nm was related to the absorption peak of the IDT-PDOT-C6 film (Fig. S7a†). After thermal annealing, the absorption spectrum of the ternary blend film became slightly broader and red-shifted by approximately 6 nm (see Fig. S7b†), indicating that annealing is beneficial for the close-packing of acceptor molecules. The corresponding integrated current densities (Jcalsc) matched well with the values from the J–V tests (within a 5% mismatch).
In order to clarify the working mechanism in the ternary system (PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6:ITC6-2F), we measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and performed time-resolved transient photoluminescence (TRTPL) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4, the neat ITC6-2F film had a wide PL emission spectrum, ranging from 700 nm to 1100 nm, with a peak at 777 nm and full-width-at-half-maximal (FWHM) of 71 nm. In comparison, the neat IDT-PDOT-C6 film showed a broad PL emission with a FWHM of 164 nm and a red-shifted emission band peaked at 866 nm due to its narrower bandgap. The emission spectrum of the IDT-PDOT-C6:ITC6-2F film was similar to that of IDT-PDOT-C6, but the emission intensity was much higher in the blend film, compared to that in either of the neat acceptor films. The characteristic peak at 777 nm of ITC6-2F could not be observed in the emission spectrum of the blend film, which implied that energy transfer from ITC6-2F to IDT-PDOT-C6 can occur in the blend film, being a possible reason for the enhanced emission intensity of IDT-PDOT-C6. This also indicates that the two acceptors have a good miscibility (i.e., being well blended) in the blend film to favor the energy transfer processes. By fitting the TRTPL data (Fig. 4b) with an exponential model, we found that the exciton lifetimes were 0.47, 0.5141, and 0.67 ns for ITC6-2F, IDT-PDOT-C6, and their blend, respectively. This verified that the ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 blend film had a longer exciton lifetime than the neat films, and thus could explain the enhanced steady-state PL emission of the blend film (as shown in Fig. 4a). The extended exciton lifetime of the acceptor favors a longer exciton diffusion length to promote more excitons to diffuse to the donor and acceptor (D/A) interfaces, giving rise to the increased short-circuit current of the ternary solar cell.

In order to further elucidate the charge-dissociation and charge-transfer behavior in the device, photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were then carried out. The PL spectra were effectively quenched by 96%, 98%, and 99% in the PBDB-T:ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F blend film, suggesting more effective exciton dissociation and photo-induced charge transfer in the device with the increasing number of F atoms (as shown in Fig. S8†) for the ITC6-2F- and ITC6-4F-based films; while the ITC6-IC-based ternary film still had an observable emission from IDT-PDOT-C6, indicating that fluoro-substitution of the parent compound (ITC6-IC) could facilitate charge transfer between the donor and acceptors. This would be beneficial to the enhancement of the short-circuit current in devices, which is consistent with the data shown in Tables S3–S8.†
The electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the binary and ternary blend solar cells and the devices based on neat acceptor films were obtained. Fig. 5a shows that the locations of the EL emission peaks of the neat ITC6-2F and IDT-PDOT-C6 films were identical to the location of the PL peaks, indicating that the EL emissions came from the same excited states generating PL emission. For the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F and PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 binary films, the emission peaks were located at 1.25 and 1.45 eV, respectively. For the ternary film, the dominant EL emission peak was at 1.44 eV, with a shoulder at 1.30 eV.

The charge-carrier lifetimes were determined by transient photovoltage decay measurements, using steady-state illumination to generate different bias photovoltages and pulsed illumination to generate the decaying signal. The x-axis in (d) is the photovoltage generated by the steady-state illumination, which was corrected by the difference in ECT of the different solar cells. Then, the difference in lifetime values represents the difference in recombination rate constants of the different solar cells. 

Fig. 5b shows the Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) spectra of the binary and ternary OSCs. By fitting the low energy part of the FTPS-EQE spectra, using the methods described in references,49–51 the energy of CT state (ECT) could be obtained for the binary and ternary devices. We found that the ECT of the devices based on PBDB-T:ITC6-2F, PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6, and PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 blend films were 1.5, 1.4,41 and 1.4 eV, respectively (see Fig. S9 in the ESI† for details).
Solar cells based on the PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 binary blend film and the ternary one had the same ECT value, indicating that the CT state in the ternary solar cell was dominated by the CT state formed at the interfaces between PBDB-T and IDT-PDOT-C6.

Fig. 5c shows electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) yields of the OSCs measured with increasing injection current densities. Based on the EQEEL value, the nonradiative energy loss (Enrloss) could be obtained using equation:52,53  where q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence of the solar cell.
It can be seen that the PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 binary film exhibited the lowest Enrloss of 0.24 eV41 while the ternary blend showed a slightly higher Enrloss of 0.27 eV. This is the main reason for the lower Voc value in the ternary device relative to the binary solar cell. Fig. 5d shows the charge-carrier lifetime obtained by the transient photovoltage (TPV) decay method.54 We found that the lifetime of the charge carriers in the ternary solar cell was longer than that of the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F-based device, but shorter than that of the PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6-based solar cell. This indicates that recombination of charge carriers in the ternary device was slower than that in the ITC6-2F-based binary device, but faster than that in the IDT-PDOT-C6-based binary device. This result is in accordance with the EQEEL measurement.
Because the long-term stability of OSCs is a key factor influencing their potential applications, we further investigated the thermal stability of optimized solar cells based on the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 blend, as kept under continuous heating at 75 °C. As shown in Fig. 6a, after being heated, the PCE of the OSCs maintained approximately 80% of its initial value after 137 days, and ∼70% of its initial value after 238 days; the original J–V data for the device stability measurements are shown in Fig. S11.† From Fig. 6b–d, we can see that the roll-off of device efficiency mainly arose from the decreases in Voc and FF, which were reduced to 83% and 84% of their initial values, respectively, after being heated for 381 days. In comparison, the PCEs of the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F and PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 binary devices rapidly decayed to ∼70% of their initial values in less than 30 days (Fig. S10, ESI†). Obviously, the ternary strategy could significantly prolong the long-term thermal stability of OSCs. It should be noted that the long-term thermal stability of high-efficiency OSCs (PCE > 8%) with a T80 larger than 42 days has never been achieved previously, as shown in Fig. 6e.

Morphology and component miscibility
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the film morphologies of the binary PBDB-T:ITC6-IC/ITC6-2F/ITC6-4F/IDT-PDOT-C6 and ternary PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 blends. As shown in Fig. 7a–f, all the blend films exhibited similar homogeneous surface morphologies with nanoscale phase separation. The root mean square roughness (Rq) values were measured to be 1.01, 1.33, 1.18, and 1.47 nm for the ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, ITC6-4F, and IDT-PDOT-C6 based binary blend films, respectively. The Rq values of the ternary blend films were 1.58 and 1.69 nm for the as-cast and thermally annealed (optimized) films, respectively, which were slightly larger than those of the binary blend films. As shown in Fig. 7g–l, all these blend films showed similar morphologies with polymer nanofibrils surrounded by acceptor phases. Due to the good solubility of the acceptors, they can stay in solution before the precipitation of polymers to form favorable fibrous structures; therefore, the first formed polymer nanofibrils can be well dispersed in the small molecular acceptor matrix.55 As we carefully compared the TEM images of ITC6-IC/ITC6-2F/ITC6-4F based binary blends with that of the IDT-PDOT-C6 based one, we found that the fibrous structures were more obvious in the latter than in the former.
 Fig. 7  AFM and TEM images of films based on (a) and (g) PBDB-T:ITC6-IC = 1:1, (b) and (h) PBDB-T:ITC6-2F = 1:1, (c) and (i) PBDB-T:ITC6-4F = 1:1, (d) and (j) PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 = 1:1, (e) and (k) as-cast PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 = 1:0.6:0.4, and (f) and (l) optimized PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 = 1:0.6:0.4 blend films, respectively. 
We further investigated the morphologies of the blend films by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). It can be seen from Fig. 8 that all the binary and ternary blend films exhibited dominant lamellar (100) diffraction peaks along the in-plane (IP) direction and π–π stacking (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, indicating that the molecules in these blend films preferred a face-on orientation.56,57 The (100) peaks for the binary blend films were located at around 0.291, 0.291, 0.290, and 0.289 Å−1, corresponding to distances of 21.57, 21.56, 21.66, and 21.73 Å, for ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, ITC6-4F, and IDT-PDOT-C6 based binary films, respectively. In comparison, the (100) peak for the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 ternary blend exhibited two side chain stacking peaks at 0.292 and 0.337 Å−1, corresponding to smaller lamellar distances of 21.49 and 18.66 Å. In addition, in the π–π stacking direction, the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) were 19.58, 19.54, 20.35, and 21.47 Å for ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, ITC6-4F, and IDT-PDOT-C6 based binary films, respectively, while the CCL value increased to 24.59 Å in the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 ternary blend film. Such results demonstrate that the ternary strategy was helpful to enhance the electrostatic interactions among molecules to reduce the lamellar stacking distance and to increase the CCL in blend films. Such an improvement in the film morphology of the ternary blend was in favor of better charge transport, separation, collection, and high device performance.

Since the miscibility of different components determines the final morphology of the active layer during film formation, which can be described by the Flory–Huggins parameter (χ), we thus calculated the χ value by carrying out contact angle measurements (see Table 3). The corresponding contact angles are listed in Table S10† and details for calculating χ can be found in the ESI.† We found that the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F blend demonstrated the lowest χ value of 0.35, while PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 had the highest one (0.46). It is pointed out that a low χ value represents a high miscibility of blends with a more homogeneous morphology.58 Therefore, the phase separation in the PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 film should be larger than that in the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F one. This is in line with the TEM image of the IDT-PDOT-C6-based binary film, whose fibrous structures were more obvious than in the ITC6-2F based one. As for the ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 blend, it demonstrated a χ value of 0.40, which was much smaller than that reported in other blend systems,59,60 indicating that these two acceptors have a good miscibility and can be beneficial to enhance the intermolecular interactions, as verified by the GIWAXS measurements. Consequently, it can overcome the shortage of large-scale phase separation occurring in the acceptor phase, thus being helpful for improving the thermal stability of devices.

In order to ensure that the long-term thermal stability can be related to the stable film morphology after introduction of the third component, we performed film characterization by using XRD and TEM measurements for the ternary (PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6) and binary (PBDB-T:ITC6-2F and PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6) films after continuous heating at 75 °C in air. The XRD result showed slight shifts of the π–π stacking peaks (2θ = 24.376° vs. 24.211°) and lamellar stacking peaks (2θ = 5.170° vs. 5.203°) after heating relative to those before heating. This indicated that a decreased π–π stacking distance but an increased lamellar distance were formed after heating of the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F binary film (see Fig. S12†). Such a phenomenon has also been observed in other D:A blend films.61 However, for the PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 binary film and PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 ternary film, we did not observe such peak shifts after heating. So we resorted to TEM characterization for further clarification. The TEM images in Fig. S13† show the morphology evolutions of the blend films heated at 75 °C in air for 0–72 h. The ternary blend films (both as-cast and optimized) showed a good morphology stability with similar fibrous structures before and after thermal annealing in air; the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F binary films displayed a slightly poor morphology stability with the fibril structures disappearing after heating for 72 h, and the PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6 binary films showed the worst morphology stability, with black spots occurring even after thermal annealing for 10 h. These results prove that the morphology of the ternary blend film was much more stable than that of the binary ones, being consistent with the device stability.
Charge transport
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was applied to further understand the effect of fluoro-substitution in the acceptors on the photovoltaic performance (as shown in Fig. S6†). The hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities were calculated to be 1.51 × 10−4/6.56 × 10−4, 2.74 × 10−4/1.58 × 10−5, 2.85 × 10−4/2.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the ITC6-IC-, ITC6-2F-, ITC6-4F-based blends, respectively, and the corresponding μh/μe ratios were 2.30, 1.73, and 1.06. The largely increased electron mobilities in the fluorinated acceptors, attributed to a more efficient intermolecular connectivity, gave rise to more balanced hole and electron transport, thus being beneficial for solar cells to achieve a higher FF. This can well explain the improved FF of solar cells with fluorinated acceptors, as shown in Table 2. For the PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 ternary blend film, μe and μh were calculated to be 5.66 × 10−4 and 4.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μe/μh = 1.21). After thermal annealing, μh and μe increased to 8.98 × 10−4 and 8.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and became more balanced with a μe/μh ratio of 0.98. Therefore, compared to the as-cast solar cell, the increased and more-balanced charge-carrier mobilities were considered to be the main reason for the higher PCE of annealed solar cells.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we employed a ternary blend strategy to improve both the power conversion efficiency and the long-term thermal stability of OSCs. A series of small molecular acceptors, namely ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, ITC6-4F, and IDT-PDOT-C6, were used to fabricate binary and ternary organic solar cells. Compared with the parent compound ITC6-IC, the introduction of fluoro substituents in ITC6-2F and ITC6-4F enhanced the intermolecular interactions, leading to closer stacking of the acceptors in the films, as verified by XRD and UV-vis spectroscopy measurements. The ITC6-2F-based binary OSCs exhibited the highest PCE among the three acceptors (ITC6-IC, ITC6-2F, and ITC6-4F) due to the improved Jsc and FF. Ternary OSCs based on PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 achieved a high PCE of 13.36%. Photophysical and device-physical analyses demonstrated that in ternary devices, although the charge-transfer state energy is dominated by the CT states formed at the PBDB-T and IDT-PDOT-C6 interfaces, ITC6-2F could facilitate photonic energy transfer from ITC6-2F to IDT-PDOT-C6, promoting more excitons to reach the donor and acceptor (D/A) interfaces for more efficient photoelectric conversion. Moreover, benefitting from the enhanced intermolecular interactions in the ternary blend and good miscibility between the two acceptors (ITC6-2F and IDT-PDOT-C6), a fixed (“frozen”) film morphology could be achieved, which significantly improved the long-term thermal stability of the OSCs. We demonstrated a record-high T80 value of OSCs, larger than 137 days, under continuous heating at 75 °C. Our results showed that high-performance OSCs with good thermal stability could be realized via a ternary blend strategy, which is highly promising for the commercialization of OSCs in the near future.

 	Fig. 3  (a) J–V curves and (b) EQE curves of the binary PBDB-T:ITC6-IC/ITC6-2F/ITC6-4F/IDT-PDOT-C6 devices and the ternary PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 (1:0.6:0.4) devices.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) PL spectra (the PL emission intensities were calibrated by the UV absorbance at the excitation wavelength of 650 nm) and (b) TRTPL spectra (excited at 780 nm) of ITC6-2F neat film and the ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 (0.6:0.4) blend film.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Electroluminescence spectra recorded with an injection current of 1 mA, (b) EQE measured by the sensitive FTPS method, (c) EQEEL measurements with calculated Enrloss values (under 25 mA cm−2 current density), (d) charge-carrier lifetime of the solar cells based on the binary PBDB-T:ITC6-2F and PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6, and the ternary PBDB-T:ITC6-2F:IDT-PDOT-C6 (1:0.6:0.4). The charge-carrier lifetimes were determined by transient photovoltage decay measurements, using steady-state illumination to generate different bias photovoltages and pulsed illumination to generate the decaying signal. The x-axis in (d) is the photovoltage generated by the steady-state illumination, which was corrected by the difference in ECT of the different solar cells. Then, the difference in lifetime values represents the difference in recombination rate constants of the different solar cells.
