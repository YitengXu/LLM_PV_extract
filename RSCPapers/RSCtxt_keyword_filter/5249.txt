    , Accepted 29th January 2017First published on 31st January 2017AbstractThe rapid development of modern electronics has given rise to a higher demand for flexible and wearable energy sources. Flexible transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) are one of the essential components of flexible/wearable thin-film solar cells (SCs). In this regard, we present highly transparent and conducting CuS-nanosheet (NS) networks with an optimized sheet resistance (Rs) as low as 50 Ω sq−1 at 85% transmittance as a counter electrode (CE) for flexible quantum-dot solar cells (QDSCs). The CuS NS network electrode exhibits remarkable mechanical flexibility under bending tests compared to traditional ITO/plastic substrates and sputtered CuS films. Herein, CuS NS networks not only served as conducting films for collecting electrons from the external circuit, but also served as superior catalysts for reducing polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) electrolytes. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 3.25% was achieved for the QDSCs employing CuS NS networks as CEs, which was much higher than those of the devices based on Pt networks and sputtered CuS films. We believe that such CuS network TCEs with high flexibility, transparency, conductivity and catalytic activity could be widely used in making wearable electronic products.
Introduction
In recent years, wearable, portable and foldable design has gradually become one of the trends for the development of electronic products.1–4 The rapid development of modern electronics, such as electronic skin, cell phones and unmanned aerial vehicles, raises higher demands for flexible and portable energy sources. As one kind of renewable green energy source, quantum-dot solar cells (QDSCs) have received extensive attention due to their low cost, high molar extinction coefficient and ease of fabrication.5 Flexible QDSCs can be mostly divided into two different configurations according to the direction of light irradiation: (i) front-side illuminated configuration (light irradiates photoanodes which are generally on the transparent polymer substrates) and (ii) back-side illuminated configuration (the photoanodes are opaque and light irradiates transparent counter electrodes).6 Generally, since high-temperature annealing is usually required to achieve high-quality nanomaterials for use as QDSCs’ photoanodes (e.g. TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 nanotubes), the temperature limitation of plastic substrates is a major challenge preventing QDSCs from flexible application. In the back-side illuminated configuration, opaque conducting fibers or foils such as carbon fiber, titanium (Ti) or stainless steel are employed as photoanode substrates which allow for high-temperature processing.7–9 Nonetheless, fabricating a flexible back-side-illuminated QDSC requires the following three conditions: (i) both the counter electrodes (CEs) and working electrodes (WEs) exhibit superior mechanical flexibility and chemical stability; (ii) the CEs should be highly transparent and conductive for light transmission and electronic delivery; (iii) the CEs should exhibit superior electrochemical catalytic activity toward the redox couples in the electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, few reported flexible QDSCs have satisfied all the aforementioned requirements. In an early attempt, Lan et al. employed Ti meshes and platinized metallic meshes as WEs and CEs for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), respectively.10 Although mesh-structure electrodes exhibit moderate transmittance, they are difficult to be sealed up. What is more, platinum (Pt) is expensive and not a good CE for QDSCs due to the sulphur atom present in the polysulfide electrolyte being easily absorbed onto the surface of the Pt CE. To this end, metal sulphides including Cu2S, CuS,11,12 CoS, PbS,13 and Cu2S/reduced graphene oxide composite,14,15etc. have been widely exploited as CEs for QDSCs.16,17 However, besides CuS films, most of the aforementioned CEs are insulating and opaque. Although CuS is a well-known narrow-band-gap p-type conducting material, great effort has been made to improve its optoelectronic performance by directly sputtering or coating it through solution routes.18–22 It still suffers from poor conductivity and low transmittance (only 60% transmittance was achieved for 50 nm thickness of CuS films according to the calculation, further enhancing the transmittance results in a thinner CuS layer which leads to very high Rs19). One of the most effective strategies to increase the transmittance of a TCE is assembling the conducting films into a mesh structure with periodic or random lines, as applied in metal (Cu or Ag) networks. In this way, the transmittance of the mesh TCEs can be significantly increased while the Rs is slightly increased. Here, we present highly flexible, transparent and conducting CuS networks by utilizing electrostatic spinning, magnetron sputtering and sulphide treatment processes. The conductivity and transmittance of the CuS networks can be easily adjusted by varying the density of the polymer spinning and sputtering time. An optimized CuS NS network electrode exhibits an Rs of ∼50 Ω sq−1 at 85% transmittance which is much better than traditional sputtered CuS films. What is more, CuS network TCEs show remarkable mechanical stability under bending tests compared to commercial ITO/plastic substrates and directly sputtering CuS films. In addition, the electrochemical catalytic activity of CuS networks towards the polysulfide electrolyte was first investigated and a 3.25% power conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved by using CuS NS networks as CEs. After 300 cycles of mechanical bending and releasing testing, the PCE of the QDSCs based on CuS NS networks demonstrated an 18% decrease.
Experiment
Preparation of the photoanode
A thin-film titanium (Ti) foil with a thickness of 30 μm was pre-cleaned by acetone, alcohol and deionized water, respectively. Then the foil was cut into small pieces (2 cm × 3 cm) and highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNARs) were fabricated on the Ti foil by a two-step electrochemical anodization method as previously reported.4 The obtained TNARs/Ti foil was annealed at 450 °C in oxygen for 2 h with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1 to induce crystallinity. After annealing, the sample was subsequently immersed in 20 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 70 °C, and then further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. CdS and CdSe QDs were deposited on the TNARs/Ti foil by chemical bath deposition (CBD).23 Firstly, CdS QDs were deposited on the TNARs/Ti foil by an aqueous solution comprised of 20 mM CdCl2, 66 mM NH4Cl, 140 mM thiourea and 230 mM aqueous ammonia for 120 min. Then, CdSe QDs were subsequently deposited on CdS QDs by immersing CdS/TNARs/Ti samples into a mixed solution at 3 °C for 36 h; the mixed solution was comprised of two parts: one part contained Se (0.1 M) in an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (0.18 M) at 75 °C for 8 h, which could serve as a Se source; the other part contained Cd(NO3)2 (0.08 M), which could serve as a Cd source; the two parts were mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1.
Preparation of the counter electrodes (CEs)

Fig. 1(a and b) represents three different approaches to fabricate flexible, transparent and conducting CEs for QDSCs. For the CuS or Pt networks, firstly, the free-standing PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) nanofibers were fabricated on an aluminum frame by electrospinning with a positive voltage of 15 kV and a negative voltage of 1.5 kV. Secondly, Cu or Pt thin layer was sputtered on the PVA networks by magnetron sputtering at room temperature, with the argon pressure of 0.4 Pa and a sputtering power of 120 W for 10 min. The metallized fibers were transferred to an arbitrary flexible substrate (such as plastics, cloth or paper) and the Cu or Pt nanotroughs were derived after removing the PVA nanofibers using deionized water. CuS nanotroughs were obtained by immersing Cu nanotroughs into an ethanol solution comprised of S (0.01 M) at 80 °C until all the Cu networks were transferred into the CuS network electrode. For the sputtered CuS film, a CuS thin layer was directly deposited on the PET substrate by RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature, with the argon pressure of 2.4 Pa and a sputtering incident power of 120 W, and reflection power within 10 W for 20 min, 40 min and 60 min, as shown in Fig. 1b.

Fabrication of QDSCs
The ITO-free and Pt-free flexible QDSCs were assembled into a typical sandwich structure. The CdSe/CdS QD co-sensitized TNARs on the flexible Ti foil (30 μm) were employed as the photoanode and coupled with one of the various TCEs including sputtered CuS films, Pt networks, or CuS networks as CEs. The aforementioned CEs and photoanodes were assembled together by applying a 25 μm thick hot-melt sealed film as the spacer (SX1170-25; Solaronix Co.). A solution containing 0.5 M Na2S, 0.2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in a mixture of methanol and deionized water (DIW) (3:7 v/v) was injected into the space between the photoanode and the CE by the capillary effect as the electrolyte.
Characterization
A four-point probe (RTS-8) was used to measure the films’ Rs. The light transmittances of all the TCEs were measured by UV–vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-3600). The phase identification of the CuS NS and sputtered CuS film electrodes was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer. The morphology and structure of the prepared materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU-70) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation in a conventional three-electrode system at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. One of the various CEs was used as the WE, a Pt foil was used as the CE, and a saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode, respectively. The methanol–DIW (3:7 v/v) mixed solution containing 0.5 M Na2S, 0.2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl was used as the electrolyte for CV measurements. The EIS was carried out on the symmetric cells to measure charge transfer resistance (Rct) using a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz and the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The equivalent circuit models were used to analyse impedance spectra. J–V curves of the obtained QDSCs were measured under simulated solar light (Newport, Oriel 300 W Xe lamp) with an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter. To examine mechanical durability, the electrode was bent to a radius of 0.5 cm and released to the initial position in a second.
Results and conclusions

Fig. 1c shows the photographs of the three different flexible CEs obtained on PET substrates, respectively. It is obvious that all the CEs are transparent and both CuS and Pt network films are light grey while sputtered CuS films (∼50 nm) are deep yellow. The corresponding SEM images in Fig. 1d show that the magnetron sputtered CuS film is continuous while electrospun CuS and Pt nanotroughs are arachnoid. It follows from Fig. S1 (ESI†) that the obtained CuS and Pt are trough-like and the inner diameters just equal those of PVA fibers which can be easily adjusted by varying the voltage of the electrostatic spinning. The length of the ultralong nanotroughs can achieve several centimetres (Fig. S2†), which can significantly decrease the number of wire–wire junctions and ultimately enhance the conductivity and mechanical flexibility. Fig. 1e shows the SEM images of CuS NS networks after different growth times. At the beginning, sulphur particles in suspension react with Cu nanotroughs to form the nucleus. After 3 hours, numerous nuclei formed on the surface of Cu, and then the growth rate increased rapidly and abundant NSs completely spread across the Cu nanotroughs as time progressed. When the growth time was extended to more than 12 h, all the Cu was exhausted and the network film turned light black.

Fig. 2a displays the XRD spectra of Cu networks, sputtered CuS films and Cu NS networks after 12 h sulphur treatment, respectively. No diffraction peaks are observed on the spectra of sputtered CuS while several diffraction peaks located at 27.4°, 29.4°, 31.8° and 48.1° can be readily indexed to (101), (102), (103) and (110) of a pure hexagonal CuS phase, according to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS card no. 06-0464), indicating that the crystallinity of CuS films prepared by the solvothermal method is much better than that prepared by magnetron sputtering. Both the Raman spectra of sputtered CuS films and Cu NS networks shown in Fig. 2b exhibit very sharp peaks at 473 cm−1, which can be attributed to the lattice vibrations (S–S stretching) of CuS. Furthermore, the crystal structure of a CuS network and a sputtered CuS film were analysed by TEM as shown in Fig. 2c and S2,† respectively. The lattice spacing of 0.323 nm as marked in Fig. 2c matches with the lattice spacing of (101) planes for the hexagonal CuS phase, indicating that the CuS NS grows along the [101] crystallographic direction. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern as shown in the inset of Fig. 2c shows several diffraction rings, which can be indexed as the (101) and (110) lattice planes of CuS. Fig. S3† shows the TEM of the CuS film onto the PET substrate by RF magnetron sputtering. It is obvious that no crystal structure and diffraction spot appeared on the TEM image, indicating that the obtained CuS film is amorphous.

The CuS NS networks exhibit several outstanding features as CEs in QDSCs. First of all, compared with sputtered CuS films, CuS networks exhibit better optoelectronic performances and higher infrared transmittance. The broad transmittance spectra of the six different TCEs are plotted in Fig. 3a. The transmittance curves of the Pt, Cu and CuS networks were almost flat in the range of 400–2000 nm while those of commercial ITO on PET, FTO glass and sputtered CuS film suffer from a sharp decrease in the range of wavelength greater than 700 nm, indicating that network TCEs can solve the low infrared transmittance problem. Apart from high infrared transmittance, network TCEs exhibit excellent optoelectronic performance. Fig. 3b plots the transmittance of sputtered CuS films and CuS networks on PET substrates as a function of Rs. It is worth noting that no obvious decrease in transmittance was observed after converting Cu networks into CuS networks. The Rs of the CuS networks and sputtered CuS film are ∼20 Ω sq−1 and ∼130 Ω sq−1, respectively, when their optical transmittances are 80%. The gigantic increase in optoelectronic performance can be attributed to the following reasons. First of all, due to the existence of inherent trade-off between the Rs and the transparency of CuS films, it is difficult to improve the optoelectronic performance of continuous CuS films by increasing film thickness. However, for percolated network films, the theoretical transmittance (T%) of the metal grid film can be calculated on the basis of eqn (1): (1)where Aempty refers to the empty area, and Atotal is the total area. According to eqn (1), the transmittance of CuS networks was dominated by the density and diameter of the CuS nanotroughs, rather than by thickness. In this regard, the optoelectronic performance of CuS networks can be significantly improved by increasing the film thickness. Secondly, due to the extra-nuclear electrons of amorphous structure being disorganized, the sputtered CuS film shows lower electric conductivity than the monocrystalline CuS NS. Fig. 3c presents the I–V curve of strip-like amorphous CuS and crystalline CuS which intuitively shows the electric conductivity of different crystal forms. The electric conductivity of the crystalline CuS is ∼151 times higher than that of sputtered CuS films, indicating CuS networks fabricated by the solvothermal method exhibit much better crystallinity than CuS films fabricated by magnetron sputtering.

Apart from increasing the optoelectronic performance, network CuS can greatly enhance the mechanical flexibility. Fig. S4† shows the CuS NS networks on PET after bending and unfolding; the TCE remained conductive after bending as can be seen from the ignited light emitting diode (LED). The mechanical durability of three CEs was tested by periodic bending and releasing using a linear motor and the Rsversus bending times for different CEs as shown in Fig. 3d. Obviously, both Pt and CuS network TCEs exhibited superior mechanical flexibility and only a slight increase in Rs after 500 bending cycles, while the Rs of the sputtered CuS TCEs increased over 700% after bending tests. Fig. 3e shows the SEM images of the sputtered CuS film, Pt and CuS networks on PET before and after bending tests. It is obvious that no cracks were observed on the surface of the Pt and CuS networks after bending, while sputtered CuS films began to crack.
The electrocatalytic abilities of the aforementioned CEs including sputtered CuS films, Pt and CuS networks were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, which were carried on in a typical electrolyte, containing 0.5 M Na2S, 0.2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Fig. 4a displays the CV curves of the sputtered CuS film, CuS and Pt networks, respectively. It is known that the negative current in the CV plots can be used to evaluate the electrochemical catalytic activity toward the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte, which herein can be expressed by the equation Sx2− + 2e− ↔ Sx−12− + S2−. In this regard, it is obvious that the current densities at the reduction zone of CuS networks were significantly larger than those of sputtered CuS films and Pt network electrodes, suggesting a higher catalytic activity for reducing S2−/Sx2− electrolytes. The higher catalytic activity of the CuS networks can be attributed to the following reasons. First, the S2−/Sx2− redox species are prone to absorb onto the surface of the Pt networks, which will greatly reduce their catalytic activity. Second, compared with Pt networks, CuS networks with porous and sheet-like structures provide a larger active surface area for Sx2− reduction. Finally, the sputtered CuS film exhibited the lowest catalytic activity, which can be attributed to its amorphous structure, and there are limited active crystals for Sx2− reduction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to evaluate the aforementioned three different CEs’ electrocatalytic kinetics. Fig. 4b illustrates the corresponding three Nyquist plots which are fitted to the equivalent circuit model shown in the inset and the obtained EIS parameters are summarized in Table 1. Generally, the Rct value at the CE/electrolyte interface is directly proportional to the overpotential for the electron transfer from the CE to the S2− species. In this regard, as can be seen from Table 1, the Rct values of the CuS network electrode are 12.42 Ω cm−2 and 335.4 Ω cm−2, respectively, which are much smaller than the sputtered CuS film electrode (Rct1 = 82.94 Ω cm−2, Rct2 = 635.8 Ω cm−2) and the Pt network electrode (Rct1 = 89.29 Ω cm−2, Rct2 = 452.4 Ω cm−2), indicating the excellent electrochemical catalytic ability of the CuS network electrode. What is more, Tafel curves of the three different CEs as shown in Fig. 4c were employed to evaluate the electrochemical catalytic ability. It is well known that the extrapolated intercepts of the anodic and cathodic branches can be used to estimate the value of the exchange current density, which is inversely proportional to Rct according to the equation J0 = RT/nFRct. It follows from Table 1 that the J0 of the CuS network CE (2.344 mA cm−2) is larger than those of Pt networks (0.891 mA cm−2) and sputtered CuS films (0.158 mA cm−2), indicating that CuS networks exhibit higher catalytic activity than Pt networks and sputtered CuS films.

Fig. 5a shows the schematic structure of a flexible QDSC based on TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNARs) on 30 μm Ti foil as the photoanode and a CuS network film on PET as the CE. Fig. 5b shows the SEM images of the top and side-views of TNARs, respectively, revealing that the TNARs are highly ordered with ∼100 nm diameter and ∼8 μm thickness. The Raman spectra of CdSe/CdS co-sensitized TNARs in Fig. 5c exhibit very sharp peaks at 206.3 cm−1 and 397.4 cm−1 related to the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon and overtone (2LO) for CdSe, respectively. The small peaks located at 275 cm−1 and 300 cm−1 can be attributed to the LO phonon in the CdS crystal, the reason why the CdS nanocrystal exhibits a lower Raman shift than bulk CdS (305 cm−1) may be due to a combined effect of strain and phonon confinement.24,25Fig. 5d shows the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of QDSCs based on the sputtered CuS film, CuS and Pt networks as CEs, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1, showing that the Jsc, Voc and FF of the QDSC based on CuS networks are 17.4 mA cm−2, 0.44 V and 0.42, respectively, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.25%, which is much higher than that of the devices based on sputtered CuS films (0.61%) and Pt networks (1.07%). Furthermore, periodic bending tests were performed to investigate the mechanical stability of the QDSCs based on CuS network CEs. Fig. 5e presents the normalized PCEs as a function of the bending cycle. The inset 3D diagram shows the measurement state of the devices. There is only an 18% decrease in PCE after 300 bending cycles.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated ITO- and Pt-free flexible QDSCs employing CuS NS networks as the CEs (conducting layer and catalyst). It is demonstrated that CuS NS networks not only exhibit superior optoelectronic performance (50 Ω sq−1 at 85% transmittance), but also show remarkable mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, CV, EIS and Tafel measurements revealed that CuS NS networks exhibited excellent electrocatalytic ability in the reduction of Sx2− ions for QDSCs, yielding a PCE of 3.25% with a fill factor (FF) of 42.16%, a Voc of 0.44 V and a Jsc of 17.39 mA cm−2. After 300 bending cycles testing, such a device suffers from only an 18% decrease in PCE. We believe that such CuS TCEs with high flexibility, transparency, conductivity and catalytic activity could be widely applied in making wearable electronic products.
