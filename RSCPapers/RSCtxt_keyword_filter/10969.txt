    , Accepted 23rd November 2015First published on 25th November 2015AbstractLow-band-gap push–pull copolymers are promising donor materials for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. One of the best push–pull copolymers are composed of bridged dithiophene pushing units and benzothiadiazole (BT) pulling units, but BT has no proper position to accommodate alkyl side chains introduced to enhance the solubility of the resulting copolymers in organic solvents. On the other hand, N-alkylthienopyrroledione (TPD), which has an alkyl side chain attached to its pyrrole moiety, has been combined with various bridged dithiophene pushing units to give high-solubility donor polymers whose power conversion efficiencies are higher than those of the BT-based polymers especially after a morphology control. However, our well-validated time-dependent density functional theory calculation on the intrinsic (single-chain) electronic structure, which has been proved powerful to estimate the efficiency, gives a contradictory prediction that both polymers would show essentially the same efficiency. Intrigued by this, we subsequently perform density functional theory calculations on their π-stacked-pair models in a number of stacking configurations and conclude that the enhanced performance of the TPD-based polymers is ascribed to their enhanced inter-chain interaction resulting from their enhanced dipole moments in the push–pull direction. Enhanced morphological ordering (π-stacking and π-conjugation) in their solid films, which is not considered in electronic-structure calculations, would reduce the band gap (as proved by the low-energy shoulders in UV/vis absorption spectra), improve the charge transfer (as shown by the calculated transfer integral, transfer rate, and hole mobility), and enhance the power conversion efficiencies (as observed after a morphology control).
1. Introduction
Roll-to-roll mass production of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells from low-cost lightweight flexible materials will eventually bring solar energy to interesting applications at conventional fuel costs.1 Low power conversion efficiency (PCE), their major drawback, has been dramatically improved with a bulk heterojunction architecture where push–pull-type polymeric donors are mixed with fullerene-derivative acceptors.2–7 A push–pull copolymer exhibits a low band gap and a strong absorption of the solar spectrum owing to the presence of both electron-rich pushing units and electron-deficient pulling units. Push–pull polymers used for the best OPV cells8–10 are exclusively composed of benzothiadiazole (BT) derivatives as pulling units, while their pushing units have been chosen from various bridged dithiophenes: cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), dithienopyrrole (DTP), dithienosilole (DTS) (1–3; Fig. 1),4–7,11–20 and so on.21–23 The molecular orbital (MO) energy levels, UV/visible absorption spectra, and PCE (<6%) of such BT-based polymers 1–3 have been well described by (time-dependent) density functional theory [(TD)DFT] calculations on dimer models (∼2 nm; n = 2 in Fig. 1) in our previous studies.24,25
 Fig. 1  Push–pull polymers 1–6 where BT (1–3) or TPD (4–6) pulling units are linked to CPDT, DTP, or DTS pushing units. All the alkyl side chains are replaced by methyl groups. 
In these studies we have also designed their high-PCE derivatives where the bridging position of the dithiophene pushing unit [e.g. C(alkyl)2 of 1] is replaced by an electron-withdrawing group such as dicyano C(CN)2, dicyanomethylene CC(CN)2, and carbonyl CO.24,25 However, this position is where long alkyl chains are introduced to ensure the solubility of the polymer in organic solvents for solution-processed production without exerting steric hindrance against neighboring units in the same backbone and twisting it. Therefore our newly designed polymers lacking the long alkyl side chains would be insoluble in most organic solvents, unless the long alkyl chains are introduced to the pulling units. Unfortunately, the current pulling unit, BT, has no proper position to accommodate the long alkyl chains while keeping the planarity of the backbone which is critical for good OPV characteristics.
Hence, in order to expand the design scope of pushing units without sacrificing the solubility of the resulting polymers, it would be desirable to develop a pulling unit incorporated with long alkyl side chains. In fact, a recent development of OPV donor polymers8–10 has been along this line, introducing alkylated pulling units such as N-alkylthienopyrroledione (TPD),26–48 alkylthienothiophene,49,50 bis-N-alkyldiketopyrrolopyrrole,51 and 2-alkylbenzotriazole.52–55 [2,2-Dialkylbenzimidazole with C(alkyl)2 at the position of S of BT has also been proposed but it turned out to go through degradation under a conventional polymer synthesis condition.56] Among them, TPD has been combined with the same bridged dithiophene pushing units (CPDT, DTP, and DTS) as in 1–3 to make highly soluble donor polymers 4–6 (Fig. 1).29–40 Their PCEs have been measured up to 7.3%, which are even higher than those of 1–3.
In this work we carry out DFT/TDDFT calculations on the single-chain dimer models of 4–6 (n = 2, Fig. 1) in the same manner as done on 1–3 in our previous study24 (but including the solvent effect in the current study), expecting more favorable backbone structure, electronic structure, optical properties, and PCE values for 4–6 than for 1–3. Our calculation scheme has been carefully validated against various polymers of such kind and proved reliable for predicting PCE,24,25,56,57 but we are surprised to find essentially the same electronic structure and PCE predicted for both classes of polymers in contrast to the observation (Sections 2.1 and 3.1). Intrigued by this discrepancy, we subsequently perform DFT calculations on their π-stack-paired monomer models (n = 1, Fig. 1) and conclude that the enhanced performance of the TPD-based polymers 4–6 is ascribed to their enhanced inter-chain interaction (stronger binding in the π-stacked pair) resulting from their enhanced dipole moments in the push–pull direction (Sections 2.2 and 3.2).
2. Calculation details
2.1. Single-chain models
The same type of calculation as done in our previous studies24,25,56,57 is carried out using Jaguar v6.558,59 and Gaussian09.60 The optimized structures of the monomer and dimer models of BT-based 1–3 are taken from our previous study24 to build the monomer and dimer models of the TPD-based 4–6 (n = 1–2; Fig. 1). All the alkyl side chains are replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculation (Fig. 1). The ground-state geometry is fully optimized at the B3LYP61–65/6-311G(d,p) level in the gas phase and in the CHCl3 (chloroform) solution using the CPCM (conductor-like polarizable continuum model) implicit solvent model.66,67 The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), EHOMO, are taken from the eigenvalues of the Kohn–Sham equation. The first ionization potential [= E(cation) − E(neutral)] should in principle be more appropriate to compare with experimental EHOMO, which is estimated electrochemically from the oxidation onset potential,68 but inspection of previous studies including ours24 indicates that our approach is as simple and reliable (requiring only dimer models instead of tetramer models for closer agreement with experiments). At the optimized geometry, the vertical singlet–singlet electronic transition energies are calculated with the TDDFT method69–72 at the same level of theory. The UV/vis absorption spectra are simulated on the basis of the TDDFT calculations, employing Gaussian functions with a fixed width of 0.4 eV to build a continuous spectrum from a collection of transition peaks corresponding to the TDDFT transition energies and oscillator strengths. The lowest (S0 → S1) vertical transition energy gives the optical band gap (Eg; eV) corresponding to the lowest peak maximum λmax (not the onset λonset; nm) in the absorption spectrum (Eg = 1240/λmax). Our band gap Eg should be compared with literature values with care, because the optical band gaps in the literature (ref. 68, for example) are typically much lower values converted from the absorption onset wavelength λonset. Since most (∼90%) of the lowest-energy (S0 → S1) transition in most copolymers of the same type (ref. 68, for example) comes from the electronic transition from HOMO to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), the lowest TDDFT transition energy can be approximated as the HOMO–LUMO energy gap and thus the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), ELUMO, are approximately estimated by adding EHOMO of DFT and the transition energies of TDDFT [ELUMO = EHOMO (DFT) + Eg (TDDFT)].
2.2. Stack-paired models
The strength of inter-chain interaction is estimated from the binding energy (BE) between two monomer models (n = 1; Fig. 1) in a π-stacked pair [BE = 2 × E(isolated monomer) − E(π-stacked pair)]. Numerous initial configurations of a π-stacked pair are generated by systematically changing the distance, angle, and orientation of the second monomer with respect to the first one and then submitted to a full geometry optimization in the gas phase at the ωB97XD/6-311G(d,p) level of DFT. The ωB97XD functional (ωB97X73–75 combined with the Grimme's dispersion correction76,77) is known as probably the most recommendable DFT-based method for non-covalent complexes, which avoids the underbinding (B3LYP) and overbinding (B3LYPD) problems.78 Since most DFT-D schemes are parameterized without employing the counterpoise correction of the basis set superposition error and should be used this way with at least triple-zeta quality basis sets,78 we also skip the counterpoise correction in this study.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Single-chain models
The dihedral energy curves of 1–6, that is, the energy changes as a function of the dihedral angle between the pushing and pulling units (SCCCH for 1–3 and SCCS for 4–6; Fig. 2), indicate that the minimum-energy structures of 1–6 have a planar backbone conformation with a dihedral angle around 0°. This planar conformation is 2–3 kcal mol−1 more stable than the other planar conformation with a dihedral angle around 180° and well separated from it by a barrier of 6–7 kcal mol−1. Hence the following analyses are performed on this conformation as done in previous DFT studies40,48,79 [contrary to other DFT studies29,39,80 which assume the latter conformation with the S⋯O bond as a conformational lock].
 Fig. 2  Dihedral energy curves of the monomer models of 1–6. The minimum-energy structure indicated by red arrows is shown for 1 and 4. Color code: black (H), gray (C), blue (N), red (O), and yellow (S). 
The HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) from the DFT calculations on the dimer models of 1–6 in CHCl3 are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3a (red marks) along with a collection of the experimental values from cyclic voltammetry (CV; black bars).4,5,7,14,16–19,29–35,37–40,81,82 [Some values for 6,35,37 which were converted from the oxidation onset potential (Eox) using a different formula (EHOMO = −Eox − 5.12 eV) from the one used for all the others (EHOMO = −Eox − 4.8 eV),83,84 are excluded from the comparison.] The calculated EHOMO values of all the polymers 1–6 fall within the range of the experimental values. The EHOMO values of 4–6 are slightly lower than those of 1–3, most likely due to EHOMO of TPD itself (−7.50 eV) which is lower than that of BT (−6.84 eV), indicating that the TPD-based donor polymers 4–6 would show larger open-circuit voltages Voc [= ELUMO(acceptor) − EHOMO(donor)] (favorably for PCE) than the BT-based 1–3. The EHOMO values of 1–3 and 4–6 follow the same pattern: an electron-withdrawing character of the bridging position of the dithiophene pushing unit [N(alkyl) < C(alkyl)2 < Si(alkyl)2] pulls down EHOMO (2 > 1 > 3 and 5 > 4 > 6).

The band gaps (Eg) estimated from the lowest TDDFT transition energies of 1–6 in CHCl3 are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 3b (red marks). The UV/vis absorption spectra of 1–6 simulated from the TDDFT transition energies and oscillator strengths are shown in Fig. 4 (black peaks and curves). Shown together is a collection of the experimental spectra (color curves) measured in solutions (Fig. 4a) and in solid thin films (Fig. 4b). The experimental spectra (of 4 and 6 in particular) exhibit a solution-to-film bathochromic red shift due to the development of low-energy shoulders on the first absorption peaks measured on thin films. Such low-energy shoulder peaks are often observed for π-conjugated polymers with a strong inter-chain interaction as a signature of π-stacked polymer crystalline phases with extended conjugation lengths.4,30–32,39,85 The experimental Eg estimated from the position of such high- and low-energy shoulders (intrinsic Eg of a polymer chain versus thin-film Eg of a π-stacked phase) is summarized in Fig. 3b (black versus green bars) and Table 1.4,5,7,11,12,14,16–19,29–35,37–40,82,86–91 The solution-to-film red shift due to the low-energy shoulder is more prominent for 4–6 than for 1–3 (Fig. 4), implying that the TPD-based 4–6 have a higher tendency to form π-stacks than the BT-based 1–3. Indeed, the TDDFT absorption spectra (black curves, Fig. 4) and Eg (red marks, Fig. 3b) calculated on the single-chain models are in good agreement with those measured for 1–3 (colored curves, Fig. 4; black and green bars, Fig. 3b) and also with the intrinsic characteristics of 4–6 measured in solutions (colored curves, Fig. 4a) and films (high-energy shoulders of colored curves, Fig. 4b; black bars, Fig. 3b), but fail to reproduce the thin-film characteristics of 4–6 (low-energy shoulders of colored curves, Fig. 4b) and significantly overestimate the thin-film Eg of 4–6 (green bars, Fig. 3b). A greater amount of π-stacked aggregates in their films is expected for 4–6 than for 1–3.

The TPD-based 4–6 show significantly larger Eg (unfavorably for PCE) than the BT-based 1–3 (because TPD itself has a wider Eg than BT; 4.54 versus 3.87 eV) and slightly lower EHOMO (favorably for PCE) for 4–6 than for 1–3, and thus ELUMO (= EHOMO + intrinsic Eg) is higher (unfavorably for PCE)24 for 4–6 than for 1–3 (Fig. 5a). The PCE values (in %) evaluated by plugging the intrinsic Eg and ELUMO into the Scharber diagram92–94 as done in our previous studies24,25,56 are thus essentially the same for both 1–3 (3.9, 3.3, and 4.2; yellow mark, Fig. 5b; blue squares, Fig. 5c) and 4–6 (3.9, 3.2, and 4.1; red marks, Fig. 5b; blue squares, Fig. 5c). The PCEs estimated for 1–3 from their intrinsic electronic structure calculated in CHCl3 are higher than those previously estimated in the gas phase (3.2, 2.4, and 3.5)24 but still agree well with the experimental PCEs (black bar, Fig. 5c): 1.9–3.5 (1), 0.7–2.8 (2), and 1.2–5.2 (3).4,5,11–13,15–17,19,20,54,82,95 The PCEs estimated likewise for 4–6 also agree well with the experiments: 1.0–4.9 (4), 0.6–1.9 (5), and 1.2–4.4 (6).29–34,38 A morphology control with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)6,95,96 or microwave heating,14 which transforms an amorphous29,31 or phase-segregated37 blend film into a fine interpenetrating structure of well-ordered domains whose small sizes improve exciton dissociation, charge separation, short-circuit current, and PCE,37,39 however, makes a more dramatic effect on 4–6 than on 1–3, achieving a higher PCE for 4 (<6.4)30,32 and 6 (<7.3)35–39 than for 1 (<5.5)6,15,95 and 3 (<5.9),14 again indicating that the TPD-based polymers, 4 and 6 in particular, have stronger π-stacking interchain interaction than the BT-based ones, but this effect is not included in our single-chain-based PCE estimation.

3.2. Stack-paired models
A pair of two monomer models is taken as the simplest model describing the inter-chain interaction which is a rather localized and short-range quantity. From a full geometry optimization starting from a number of initial pairing configurations, seven distinct configurations of the strongest binding are selected and presented in Fig. 6. They are all face-on π-stacked pairs, as suggested from experiments.31,37,39 In these seven configurations, two monomer models face each other in the same orientation (FF), with one monomer flipped about the short axis (x) (FFX) or the long axis (y) (FFY) or both (FFZ), or in a cross form (CF). They can also be significantly shifted from each other (FFXS or FFYS). The inter-planar π-stacking distance is calculated as ∼3.6 Å, which is close to the value estimated from a grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering experiment (3.7 Å).39 As expected from all the discussions above, the seven most strongly bound pairs of 4 have indeed overall higher binding energies (BE; 24.3, 24.0, 23.9, 23.8, 22.0, 21.5, and 19.9 kcal mol−1; Fig. 6, right) than those of 1 (22.3, 22.1, 22.0, 20.9, 20.1, 20.1, and 17.5 kcal mol−1, Fig. 6, left). [A simple test with one configuration (FFY) of stacked-pair dimer models (not shown here) gives a binding energy of 21.6 (1) and 23.6 (4) kcal mol−1 per monomer unit, which is essentially the same as that obtained with the monomer models (22.3 and 23.8 kcal mol−1), confirming the validity of our simple model.]
 Fig. 6  Binding energy (BE) of 1 and 4 in various optimized configurations of π-stacked monomer pairs. Color code: gray and light green (C); black and white (H); blue and light blue (N); yellow and light yellow (S); red and light red (O). 
The stronger electron-withdrawing character (the lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels) of TPD than of BT would result in a larger amount of charge separation (q in electron unit from the Mulliken population analysis) between the pushing units (+q) and the pulling units (−q) in 4 (0.11) than in 1 (0.03). As Fig. 7 shows, the magnitude of the dipole moment vector lying in the direction from the pushing unit to the pulling unit is larger for 4 (3.4 D) than for 1 (1.7 D). This would bring an inter-chain dipole–dipole interaction in addition to the π–π interaction, and it would be stronger for 4 than for 1.
 Fig. 7  Dipole moment vectors developed in the push–pull direction of 1–6. 
As will be reported in detail separately in the near future, the hole transport properties (hole transfer integrals, hole transfer rates and hole mobilities) of 1 and 4 are evaluated on the seven stacked-pair configurations following previous studies80,97,98 and Boltzmann-averaged on the basis of the relative BE with respect to the lowest-energy configuration. The average hole transfer integral, hole transfer rate and hole mobility of 4 are indeed higher (by 20–50%) than those of 1, explaining in part the difference in PCE between 1 (<5.5%)6,15,95 and 4 (<6.4%)30,32 after a morphology control.
The difference in the inter-chain interaction between 1 and 4 would be even larger in reality when all the long alkyl side chains (two of the pushing units and one of the TPD pulling unit in 4 and two of the pushing units in 1) are introduced to the positions of the methyl groups and contribute to inter-chain dispersion interaction. Among the series of 4–6 (and 1–3), the copolymer with the DTP pushing unit, 5 (and 2), has the largest dipole moment of 3.9 D (and 2.7 D) due to the most electron-donating (pushing) character of the bridging N(alkyl) in DTP (Fig. 7) and would exert the strongest dipole–dipole inter-chain interaction. However, only two long alkyl chains would be present in 5, instead of three present in 4 and 6 (and only one in 2 instead of two in 1 and 3), exerting the weakest alkyl–alkyl dispersion interaction. The two effects would cancel each other and thus would not alter the sequence of PCE estimated from their intrinsic electronic structure (6 ∼ 4 > 5 and 3 ∼ 1 > 2).
3.3. Proposition
The same sequence of PCEs is predicted for both series of polymers (6 ∼ 4 > 5 and 3 ∼ 1 > 2). We thus expect that the same type of PCE enhancement as proposed for the BT-based polymers in our previous studies (up to 6–11%)12,13 could be proposed for the TPD-based polymers (7–12, Fig. 8).24,25 A realization of our previous proposition for the BT-based polymers has not been reported yet, probably due to their low solubility with a limited number of long alkyl side chains (zero in the BT-analogues of 7–9 and one in the BT-analogues of 10–12), but the situation should be improved by replacing BT with N-alkylated TPD (one long alkyl side chain in 7–9 and two in 10–12). Therefore, we propose a potential high-performance high-solubility push–pull-type OPV donor polymer such as 7–13, where TPD pulling units are linked to pushing units of dithiophenes bridged with various electron-withdrawing groups. The copolymer 8 and its imine derivatives 13 are particularly interesting: their analogues have been synthesized but bulky alkoxy99 and alkyl100 substituents introduced to ensure sufficient solubility appear to twist the backbone,25,57 increase the band gap, and lower the PCE. Introducing N-alkyl-TPD units and removing those bulky substituents would improve their OPV characteristics. We hope that this proposition would call for the attention of experimentalists.

4. Conclusions
The DFT and TDDFT calculations were carried out on push–pull OPV donor polymers composed of bridged dithiophene pushing units and TPD pulling units. The MO energy levels, band gaps and absorption spectra calculated with the solvent effect included reproduce very well the experiments except the low-energy shoulders observed on thin-film UV/vis spectra, indicating a facile formation of local π-stacked phases. Indeed the inter-chain interaction was calculated to be stronger in the TPD-based copolymers than in their BT analogues, probably due to their higher degree of local dipole moments developed in the charge-separated push–pull direction. A rather strong dipole–dipole interaction in addition to a π–π interaction between different polymer chains (or their segments) would help inter-chain stacking and (locally) crystalline ordering. The TPD-based copolymers have lower HOMO energy levels but larger band gaps than their BT analogues, and thus a similar PCE is estimated for both polymers. The PCE measured after morphology control is slightly higher for TPD-based polymers, probably due to their stronger inter-chain interaction. We hence make the same proposition as done for the BT-based polymers in our previous study: a push–pull polymer made of TPD (pulling unit) and dithiophenes bridged with electron-withdrawing groups (pushing unit) could be a potential high-PCE high-solubility OPV donor copolymer. Another proposition we make from this work is that, contrary to a concern about the accuracy of TD-B3LYP in describing a long-range charge-transfer excitation,101–103 a good agreement with experimental UV/vis absorption spectra was obtained with our simple TD-B3LYP calculations on dimer models (∼2 nm, a typical π-conjugation length). Our preliminary TDDFT calculations performed with long-range-corrected functionals such as LC-BLYP,104 CAM-B3LYP,105 and ωB97XD73–77 gave a dramatic blue shift of the S0 → S1 transition (not shown here) as also observed previously84,103,106,107 probably due to the short dimer model or the out-of-the-box default value for the range-separation parameter ω,103 but even a combination of fine-tuned parameters and long oligomer models could not yield as good agreement as ours with experiments.103 The success of our approach could be due to a fortunate error cancellation between the error from the B3LYP functional and the error from the short oligomer (∼2 nm) model. However, since it has been stated that the S0 → S1 transition of a BT-based polymer is essentially localized around the BT segments,103 we may not need to concern about the limitation of B3LYP in describing a long-range charge-transfer excitation. In any case, the level of theory used in this work [DFT EHOMO and TDDFT Eg from B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) on short oligomer models (∼2 nm)] appears practically suitable for studying push–pull OPV polymers (and small molecules84) with planar backbones.

 	Fig. 3  (a) HOMO energy levels and (b) band gaps of the dimer models of 1–6 in CHCl3 (red mark; this work) and the corresponding experimental data (the oxidation onset potential in CV and the first peak maximum in UV/vis absorption spectra) (black and green bars; see Table 1 for data; see text for references).	 

 	Fig. 4  TDDFT absorption spectra of the dimer models of 1–6 in CHCl3 (black peaks and curves; this work) and experimental UV/vis absorption spectra (colored curves; see text for references) measured in solutions (a) and on thin films (b).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Frontier MO diagram of the dimer models of 1–6 in CHCl3, where the vertical arrows indicate the S0 → S1 transitions whose principal contributions come from the HOMO → LUMO transitions, (b) the Scharber diagram to estimate the PCE of the OPV cells containing 1–3 (yellow circle) and 4–6 (red circle), and (c) the calculated (blue square) and experimental [with and without 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO); black bar and red square] PCE values (see text for references).	 

 	Fig. 6  Binding energy (BE) of 1 and 4 in various optimized configurations of π-stacked monomer pairs. Color code: gray and light green (C); black and white (H); blue and light blue (N); yellow and light yellow (S); red and light red (O).	 

 	Fig. 7  Dipole moment vectors developed in the push–pull direction of 1–6.	 

 	Fig. 8  Push–pull polymers 7–13 where TPD pulling units are linked to pushing units of dithiophenes bridged with electron-withdrawing groups.
