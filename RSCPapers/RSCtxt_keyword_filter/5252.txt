The nanostructure of the films was reformed, and the thickness decreased after the HCl hydrothermal treatment, which was observed by SEM analysis. It was found that the electron lifetime, band gap, recombination rate and TiO2 film electron injection efficiency had been changed by the processing when different analysis methods were employed to analyze the experimental results, including OCVD, UV-Vis and Mott–Schottky plots. In addition, the schematic for electron transfer and recombination was shown to discuss the process in clear detail. The performance of the DSSCs based on the different TiO2 films was measured by J–V curves and IPCE. When the TiO2 film was treated by 1 mol L−1 HCl at 180 °C for 3 h, the device had the optimum 7.77% photo-electric conversion performance and 16.04 mA cm−2Jsc. The results suggested that the reformed film nanostructure led to an optimized electron transportation pathway, and the decreased electron recombination and increased injection efficiency resulted in improved DSSCs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were considered as the most potential solar energy conversion device for their advantages of low cost, low toxicity and excellent light permeability.1,2 There are many oxides and multiple compounds that can act as a photoanode such as TiO2,3–5 ZnO,6,7 SnO2,8 Zn2SnO4 and SrTiO3.9,10 Among those materials, TiO2 is the ideal choice because of the high energy level matching degree with the dye and better chemical stability.11,12 To date, the nanocrystal TiO2 nanoporous film is still the most promising structure for a DSSCs photoanode. The advantage of a nanocrystal TiO2 nanoporous film originates from the high surface area, which is beneficial to load more dye molecules and cause a high amount of light harvesting. It is well known that the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), the electron injection efficiency (ηinj) and the electron collection efficiency (ηcol) are the leading factors contributing to the Jsc value.13,14 However, there may not be full interconnections between the particles and there are vacancies in the nanoporous TiO2 films network structure.15 This means that the electron from this part cannot transport to the conductive glass successfully, thus the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) would be reduced.16 Another part of electron loss comes from the recombination processes that occurs on the TiO2 surface and the uncovered conductive glass surface with I3− in the electrolyte.17 The electron injection efficiency (ηinj) is affected by the energy level relationship between the dye and titanium dioxide.18
Many studies have been carried out to modify the TiO2 nanoporous film for more efficient solar energy conversion such as doping, surface treatment and construction of composite structures. Wide band gap metal oxide, insulator and co-adsorbing materials have been used to modify the TiO2 nanoporous film, which were proven effective in improving the DSSCs conversion efficiency.19–24 It has been demonstrated that the electron injection efficiency was increased and electron recombination reduced between conduction band and I3− in the electrolyte when the nanoporous TiO2 film was modified with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid.25 Jaspreet Singh treated a nanoporous TiO2 film with oxalic acid to obtain improved short circuit density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc), which resulted from the increased dye loading and efficient electron transfer.26 Many other acids, such as HNO3, H3PO4, H2SO4, and H2O2, have also been reported to improve the power conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.27–30 Therefore, the surface treatment of TiO2 film by various methods will effectively help to enhance the photo-electric conversion efficiency (PCE).
In this study, the pre-prepared nanoporous TiO2 films were treated by different concentrations of hydrochloric acid (HCl) via the hydrothermal method for the first time. The hydrothermal treated TiO2 electrode was investigated and compared with the untreated TiO2 electrode. The different structure of the hydrothermal treated TiO2 electrodes and the corresponding performances of DSSCs are reported and discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of TiO2
First, anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by the hydrothermal method: 5 mL TiCl4 was added into 45 mL deionized (DI) water containing 0.66 g (NH4)2SO4; the diluted ammonia was used to adjust the pH to 8 and a water bath was used to heat the solution to 90 °C for 1 h under magnetic stirring; furthermore, the precursor was transferred to Teflon-lined autoclaves, which were placed in an electric oven at 180 °C for 4 h to obtain the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. The FTO glasses were cleaned with water, ethanol and acetone by ultrasonic cleaning. TiO2 compact layer on the cleaned FTO substrate was prepared with 0.2 mol L−1 TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min after been sintered in the air at 500 °C for 30 min. TiO2 paste were prepared with 0.5 g P25 and 0.5 g anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, 0.5 g ethocel, 0.2 mL acetate and 4.3 mL terpineol. The nanoporous TiO2 film was deposited by the doctor blade method on the pre-treated FTO glass. After drying, the films were sintered via a typical sintering system. The pre-prepared nanoporous TiO2 film was placed against the inside wall of a Teflon-liner with the conductive side facing down. Different concentrations of hydrochloric acid were transferred to the Teflon-lined autoclaves, which would be placed in an electric oven at 180 °C for 3 h. When the temperature was down to 25 °C, the sample was taken out and dried in the ambient air. Subsequently, the sample was sintered at 500 °C for 3 h. Finally, the sample was treated with 0.04 mol L−1 TiCl4 by the previously reported method.32 The concentrations of hydrochloric acid were 0.5 mol L−1, 1 mol L−1, 2 mol L−1, 3 mol L−1, and 4 mol L−1, and the corresponding samples were named as 0.5HM, 1HM, 2HM, 3HM, and 4HM, and the control film was named as CM.
2.2 Fabrication of the DSSC devices
The as-prepared films were immersed into N719 dye solution (0.3 mmol L−1) at 25 °C for 24 h. The dye-sensitized films were washed with ethanol and dried at 40 °C. The liquid electrolyte was a high-efficiency electrolyte system (Yingkou China, OPV tech new Energy Co, OPV-AN-I) and the platinum counter electrode (CE) was a commercial product prepared with magnetron sputtering. The iodide/triiodide electrolyte solution was added into the gap between the electrodes by an injector.
2.3 Characterization
The chemical composition of the films was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, DX-1000, Dandong, China) at a 3.6° min−1 scanning speed, and the morphologies were characterized by emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7500F, JEOL). The J–V curves and IPCE spectra were obtained with an electrochemical workstation under simulated solar spectroscopy (AM1.5) produced by a solar simulator (CEL-S500, Beijing) and IPCE system (PVE 300) from 300 to 800 nm under the short-circuit conditions. Mott–Schottky measurements were based on a three-electrode system with TiO2 films as the electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum electrode as reference and counter electrodes. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the film were obtained on an UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-1700, SHIMADZU). The active area of the solar cells was controlled to 0.25 cm2 by a mask of set dimensions.
3. Result and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology analysis of TiO2 films
Insight into the phase and morphology of the TiO2 films was acquired through combining XRD analyses with SEM investigation of the top and section images. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the control film (CM) and the samples treated with different hydrochloric acid concentrations. The peak at 27° is characteristic of SnO2 oxide, which came from the FTO conductive substrate. The peaks at 25° and 37° were the characteristic peaks belonging to anatase and rutile TiO2, respectively. When the samples were treated hydrothermally and sintered, the intensity of the diffraction peaks at 25° was increased and FWHM values were reduced slightly, which indicated the appearance of higher crystallinity and an increased grain size. It was found that sample 1HM showed optimal crystallinity when the treated TiO2 films were compared furtherly.

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the sample CM, 1HM, 2HM and 4HM. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the TiO2 nanoparticles were packed randomly, and the agglomeration of nanoparticles occurred with uneven distributed porosity. Then, partial diameters of the apertures were more than 100 nm, which may have lead to a rupture in the internal structure of TiO2 film. The thickness of the sample CM was about 14.5 ± 0.5 μm, which could be evaluated from Fig. 2(a1). When the TiO2 film was treated with 1 mol L−1 HCl hydrothermally at 180 °C for 3 h, the porosity was distributed evenly and the pore size was decreased, all of which were beneficial to obtain superior properties for the devices. In addition, the surface of the sample 1HM was rugged, and the thickness reached to about 10 ± 0.5 μm, which was thinner than that of CM, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (b1). When the HCl concentration continued to increase, the thickness of the film was reduced further to about 8 ± 0.5 μm and 4.5 ± 0.5 μm for the 2HM and 4HM samples, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The mesoporous nature of the films became smaller and denser after the treatment. As a result, some relatively compact and thinner films with a well-proportioned and distributed mesoporous structure were obtained by the hydrothermal treatment.

Most of the time, TiO2 showed an excellent chemical stability under acidic conditions, which does not mean that it was insoluble in acid. When the conduction was changed, the reaction was possible, especially under high temperature and pressure conditions, which has been proved in many articles.31–33 In the study, the surface layer of the nanoporous TiO2 film was first of all dissolved in the HCl solution when the reaction kinetics was enhanced hydrothermally. Then the Ti4+ ions began to recrystallize, generate TiO2 and attach to the membrane surface with increasing ion concentration in solution. However, full recrystallization was impossible, and some Ti4+ ions were still found in solution. Thinner and denser films with the mesoporous structure were obtained after the treatment. Moreover, the film was dissolved more quickly when the HCl concentration increased. As a result, the sample 4HM showed the thinnest and densest film structure.
3.2 Photovoltaic properties analysis of TiO2 films

Fig. 3(a) shows the J–V curves of different electrodes under AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. The CM exhibited a 6.58% conversion efficiency, 12.51 mA cm−2Jsc and 0.74 V Voc. When the HCl concentration was lower than 4 mol L−1, both the Jsc and Voc of the treated samples were higher than that of CM, whereas the lower Jsc (10.90 mA cm−2) was measured for sample 4HM. The DSSCs fabricated from the sample 1HM exhibited a PCE as high as 7.77%, which was 18% above the efficiency of the control film. However, the fill factor (FF) of the HCl treated samples was decreased when compared with CM sample. This was likely because the redox transfer was affected by the decreased pore size.

Fig. 3(b) shows the IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on different TiO2 films. The IPCE values were enhanced when the photoanodes were HCl treated. The DSSC based on 1 mol L−1 HCl hydrothermal treatment exhibited the best performance in the wavelength of 300–800 nm and reached the highest IPCE value at about 530 nm.
As shown in Fig. 4, the electron lifetime was confirmed by the open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement, which related to the electron transfer process in DSSCs.34 It is well known that the rate of open-circuit voltage decay was inversely proportional to the electron life time that can be calculated from OCVD curve by eqn (1) as follows:35 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and e is the electronic charge.
 Fig. 4  The OCVD curve of DSSCs based on different TiO2 electrodes. 
It can be observed that the electron lifetime of the treated electrodes was longer than that of the control film at any Voc value from 0 to 0.8 V. Furthermore, the DSSC based on 1 mol L−1 HCl hydrothermal treatment electrode exhibited the longest electron lifetime when the four treated electrodes were compared. The electron recombination rate based on HCl hydrothermal treated electrode was lower and the electron transfer was more efficient. They led to increased electron collection efficiency, which would contribute to improved Jsc values. The improved electron transfer efficiency may result from the shorter electron transfer pathway and higher crystallinity.
3.3 Energy band analysis of TiO2 films
To investigate the optical properties of different TiO2 films, the UV-Vis spectra over the wavelength range from 250 to 800 nm were obtained. The band gap energy can be estimated by eqn (2) for a direct band gap semiconductor as follows:36 (αhν)1/2 = k(hν − Eg),(2)where α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the band gap and k is a constant. The estimated band gap could be confirmed by intercepting the tangent to the plot of (αhν)1/2versus photon energy (hν) straight portion. From the Fig. 5(a), it can be observed that the treated electrodes exhibited a red shift and the band gap decreased when compared to the control film. From Table 1, it can be observed that the band gap of the control film was 3.18 eV. The films with HCl hydrothermal treatment exhibited lower band gap values from 3.12 to 3.04 eV. This indicated that the conduction band (CB) shifted positively and then the driving force of electron injection was increased in the DSSCs, resulting in improvement of the electron injection efficiency from the LUMO of the N719 dye to the CB of TiO2. As reported, the Mott–Schottky plots of the films were measured to investigate changes in the flat band potential (Efb) of the electrode films.37 The Efb of the semiconductor film was associated with the space charge layer capacitance (CSC) at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, and the relationship could be expressed using eqn (3) as follows:38 (CSC)−2 = 2(E − Efb − kBT/e)/NDεε0eA2(3)where E is the electrode potential, ε is the relative dielectric constant, A is the active surface, T is the absolute temperature and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
 Fig. 5  (a) UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the electrodes without loading the N719 dye; (b) Mott–Schottky plots for the CM and 1HM samples. 
As shown in Fig. 5(b), the Efb of the CM sample was −0.49 V (vs. SCE), whereas the Efb of the treated electrode (1HM) was −0.37 V (vs. SCE). It was also corroborated that the conduction band could shift positively after the hydrothermal treatment to improve the electron injection efficiency, which would contribute to increased Jsc values. Furthermore, the reduced electron recombination implied a higher electron density, which also benefited from the increased electron injection efficiency. The Voc in DSSCs highly depended on the electron density at the TiO2 conduction band. As a result, the performance of the cells was better for the higher electron density after the treatment.

Fig. 6 shows the schematic model of the electron transfer process, the effect of HCl hydrothermal treatment on the TiO2 conduction band level, and the recombination processes in the different films. In Fig. 6(a) and (b), the solid line suggested the effective electron transfer pathway. The electron over the Ln thickness in the photoanode had no chance to transfer to the FTO substrate.39 The package between the nanoparticles lengthened the electron pathway, which would lead to an increased electron recombination rate. After HCl hydrothermal treatment and sintering (see Fig. 6(b)), the thickness of the films decreased and the particles distribution was uniform. The increased connection and well-distributed particles indicated that the TiO2 internetwork may be more fully interconnected with other particles, which could be beneficial for lessening the electron recombination rate and more electrons may then be collected at the FTO substrate. Therefore, it was obvious that the electron lifetime of the treated electrodes was prolonged when compared to that of the control film. In Fig. 6(c) and (d), the decreased TiO2 conductive band level resulted in improved driving force from N719 LUMO and higher electron injection efficiency. Moreover, it was also beneficial for the reduction in electron recombination rate.

4. Conclusions
The TiO2 films were treated with different concentrations of HCl by the hydrothermal method. The structure of the films was reformed, and the thickness decreased after the hydrothermal treatment. Relatively compact and thin films with well-proportioned distributed mesoporous structure were obtained in this study. The results showed the band gap of the treated electrodes was decreased with the increased HCl concentrations. The reduced recombination rate and enhanced electron injection efficiency contributed to improved Jsc and Voc values. The film treated with 1 mol L−1 HCl at 180 °C for 3 h showed the optimum 7.77% PCE and 16.04 mA cm−2Jsc. This finding demonstrated the feasibility of HCl hydrothermal treatment TiO2 in dye-sensitized solar cells. Moreover, an effective way to reform the nanostructure of TiO2 film to obtain a higher efficiency was provided.
