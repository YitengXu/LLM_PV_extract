    , Accepted 28th December 2016First published on 4th January 2017AbstractThis work deals with the fabrication and evaluation of color-changing dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that include N-propanoic acid-functionalized spiropyrans and spirooxazines as sensitizing dyes. We investigated the photophysical properties of these compounds in various solvents and pH conditions using UV-Vis spectroscopy, and their behavior on TiO2 photoanode surfaces using a combination of UV-Vis and FT-IR. Their performance as sensitizing dyes for DSSCs was also analyzed. This study revealed a number of unique properties for this class of compounds that affect their performance as both photochromic compounds and DSSC sensitizers, which allow for future creation of efficient photochromic DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Solar power is one of the fastest growing power sources on the planet.1 However, most of this growth is in the silicon solar cell market,2 which has a high initial cost that prevents widespread deployment.3 One class of device that attempts to lower this cost is the dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC).4 DSSCs, while inexpensive, have been unable to achieve higher efficiencies than silicon solar cells. However, one could make use of their low cost by deploying them where there is no competition from silicon such as deployment in the numerous glass windows of metropolitan areas. A window that could both harvest energy and change color depending on ambient conditions could justify the cost of such a system. As such, we attempted to make dynamic, photochromic dye-sensitized solar cells using spiropyrans and spirooxazines, which will be collectively referred to here as spirans.
Discovered in 1952, spiropyrans are one of the earliest compounds found with photochromic behavior.5 Since then, they have become one of the most widely used compounds in this class, along with their derivatives, the spirooxazines. These compounds are well suited for integration into DSSCs to fabricate photochromic solar cells due to their high stability and well known chemistry, as well as for their strong absorption in the visible range, which has the largest solar output.6 However, few studies have been done on the application of these compounds to DSSCs. They are characterized by a weak Cspiro–O bond, which can be broken upon excitation by UV light (Fig. 1). This opened form, a merocyanine (MC)-like structure, can decay back to the spiran form when the light source is removed.
 Fig. 1  Mechanism of photochromic behavior in spiropyrans and spirooxazines. 
Anchoring dye to the TiO2 surface commonly used in DSSCs generally requires the use of an acidic moiety,7 and spiran compounds are well known for their sensitivity to acidic conditions.8–10 In this work, we took common, neutral examples of photochromic spirans, and synthesized a propanoic-acid functionalized derivative. This would allow us to study the effect of the added acidic group along with the general spiran functionality (Fig. 2). Two main classes of compound were compared: the nitrospiropyrans Sp1 and Sp2 (Fig. 2a and b) and the naphthospirooxazines Ox1 and Ox2 (Fig. 2c and d). The nitrospiropyrans are the more reactive of the two derivatives, but the naphthospirooxazines are the more stable. Depending on their behavior on the TiO2 surface, each of these properties could be desirable in different situations. The merocyanine structure of Sp1, Sp2, Ox1, and Ox2 are designated by Sp1M, Sp2M, Ox1M, and Ox2M, respectively. It should be noted that as the spiran forms of these compounds are colorless, the strongly colored MC forms will be the strongest contributors to solar cell efficiency (Fig. 3).

2. Experimental section
All UV-Vis spectra were taken on a Perkin-Elmer LAMBDA 35 Spectrophotometer. Acetone, methanol, acetonitrile, and hexane were spectroscopic grade and used as received. Pyridine, piperidine, and triethylamine were dried and distilled prior to use. All UV-Vis analysis was done at a concentration of 0.05 mM.
The solar cells were prepared according to the procedure described previously.11 A titanium dioxide paste was purchased from Solaronix (Ti–Nanoxide T/SP). The paste was then doctor bladed onto FTO glass (Hartford Glass, 7 Ω sq−1) and sintered at 500 °C for 1 h and cooled to 80 °C, at which point it was immersed in the respective dye solutions (0.5 mM in methanol or toluene) for 48 h. Next, the photoanode was rinsed with ethanol and dried. The cell was completed by adding an electrolyte solution consisting of 0.5 M lithium iodide (Aldrich 99.9%) and 0.05 M iodine (Aldrich 99%) in acetonitrile between the photoanode and the platinized counter electrode. The counter electrode was prepared by spin coating 50 μL of a 5 mM solution consisting of chloroplatinic acid hydrate (Aldrich, 99.9%) in 2-propanol (Aldrich, 99%) onto FTO glass (Hartford Glass, 15 Ω sq−1) and annealing at 400 °C for 40 min. The cells were assembled using standard published procedures.12 The photoanode thickness, as determined by SEM, was 13 μm. The solar cells were tested with a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat, using a 300 W Xe lamp and 0.25 cm2 mask, filtered to 1.5 AM (100 mW cm−2).

3. Results and discussion

N-Substitution of spiropyrans has been shown to have an influence on the ring opening and closing reaction of spiropyrans, due to both sterics and electronics.14 It has also been shown that the ring closing rate, as well as the λmax of the MC, are affected by mildly electron withdrawing groups attached to the indoline nitrogen.15 This effect can be clearly seen when comparing the λmax of Sp1M and Sp2M. When the solvents are organized according to the Dimroth–Reichardt polarity index (EtN16), there is a clear linear relationship between λmax and solvent polarity (Fig. 4a). Throughout the range of solvents, Sp2M is clearly redshifted with respect to Sp1M (Fig. 3 and 4a, and Table 1). This could be attributed to the electron withdrawing carboxylic acid moiety that is connected to a positively-charged nitrogen in the MC form, which would greatly destabilize its ground state.

Sp2M also has a weaker sensitivity to solvent polarity. Intramolecular interactions from the propanoic acid functional group could be stabilizing the highly polar MC structure in nonpolar solvents. A nearly identical trend is seen with the rate of the ring-closing reaction, and is likely due to the same phenomenon (Fig. 4b and Table 1).
One piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis of intramolecular interaction is aggregation in solution. The MC form is known to aggregate under the right conditions, a fact which has been used to assist the supramolecular interaction.17 These MC structures align in a head-to-tail conformation, driven by the separated charges on the zwiterrionic MC.18 While Sp1M can be seen to undergo some aggregation in less polar solvents like THF (Fig. 5a), as evidenced by the appearance of a shoulder peak at 562 nm,19 the H-aggregate peak of Sp2M at 542 nm is far more pronounced (Fig. 5b). This would indicate that the propanoic acid moiety is aiding in stabilizing aggregation in nonpolar solvents through intermolecular interactions, and could similarly be stabilizing individual molecules through intramolecular interactions.

The naphthospirooxazines, however, have a much more interesting response to the addition of the propanoic acid moiety. What we observed was a different trend in λmax, where solvent polarity red-shifts the maximum absorbance (Fig. 6 and Table 2), rather than the blue-shift seen for the spiropyrans (Fig. 4a). This is likely due to the less polar nature of their MC form, which drastically changes how the solvent interacts with the compound. As the blueshift from the spiropyrans with increasing solvent polarity can be explained by the zwiterrionic structure of the MC form, this λmax redshift of Ox1M and Ox2M can be explained by a more polar excited MC state, which would be stabilized by the increased polarity. However, the sensitivity of this effect to the solvent polarity is different between these two compounds.

Fig. 6 and Table 2 shows a different trend in decay rates for Ox1M and Ox2M. The increase in the decay rate for Ox1M with solvent polarity matches our trend for λmax. However, Ox2M shows the opposite trend. The previous explanation for Fig. 6 would predict the opposite, so the hypothesis of compensating intramolecular forces that we used for Sp2M becomes more feasible. A hypothetical intramolecular interaction with the propanoic acid moiety would become less pronounced in more polar solvents, causing a competing trend that decreases the ring-closing rate.
Coordination with the metal oxide semiconductors commonly found in DSSCs is generally done with acidic functionalities, such as carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids, phosphoric acids, etc.7 These can then undergo an acid/base reaction with the surface to form a strong bond that enables efficient electron transfer from the dyes into the surface. While acid-functionalized derivatives of the spiran compounds have been made,15,20 they are normally synthesized as an intermediate to create other derivatives, with their photochromic properties being left unstudied.21–23 Research on the effect of pH on these spirans is also rare, with most of the research focusing on the protonation of the basic phenoxide in acidic conditions. This protonation has been found to quench the visible π–π* transition of the MC forms. This form is known as the protonated merocyanine (MCH+).9,10 Comparatively, very little research has been done on the effect of alkaline conditions,24 which would be especially relevant with an acid-functionalized compound.
Our study on the acid-functionalized spirans showed that the addition of pyridine to a solution of Sp2 in methanol caused an immediate conversion of the compound to a colored form, without the input of any ultraviolet light (Fig. 7). This effect was independent of the base used, as it was also seen with added triethylamine, piperidine, and K2CO3. This same effect was seen in acetonitrile, but was not apparent in THF or hexane. Added base also had no visible effect on Sp1, or either spirooxazine.

As this color change is only seen in highly polar solvents, it likely is an effect that requires stabilization of the merocyanine. One hypothesis was that the propanoic acid moiety was protonating the spiran to form the MCH+. These compounds are mostly colorless, and would rapidly convert to the colored merocyanine upon addition of base. This was tested by titrating an acidic solution of Sp2 with triethylamine (Fig. 8). Indeed, there is very little difference between Sp2 in neutral and acidic conditions, indicating that the propanoic acid functionality could be protonating Sp2M under neutral conditions. This was seen to reverse upon addition of the base, with the formation of the visible transition occurring as the acid was neutralized. This supports the idea of the observed color change being caused by MCH+ being neutralized to the colored MC form.

We also investigated the effect of basic solvents on the photophysical properties of spirans. As such, the same spectroscopic tests as before were undertaken in pure triethylamine, piperidine, and pyridine. Results here, however, were different than with added base. Rather than causing interconversion in the spiropyrans, the basic solvents alone simply stabilized the zwiterrionic MC form, following the polarity trend predicted by the Dimroth and Reichardt scale.16 The basic solvents alone also had no appreciable effect on the rate of the ring-closing reaction in spiropyrans (Fig. 4b).
As one of the most common and well-studied metal oxide semiconductor in DSSCs, a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode was used in our work to assemble DSSC devices. As such, studies were necessary to determine optimal binding conditions for our compounds. The standard procedure for coordination of a chosen dye compound to TiO2 is to soak the prepared electrode in a solution of around 0.5 mM for 24–72 hours. Solvents such as acetonitrile and alcohols are generally used for this binding.11 In our work, methanol was initially chosen for this coordination, as Sp2 was unstable in acetonitrile. These electrodes were a faint yellow color, as opposed to the N719 standard (Fig. 9a). This could be attributed to two factors: a very low dye loading, or a very weak visible absorption (or both). The TiO2 surface was not responsive to UV light, which supports the conclusion of low dye loading, or it could indicate inhibited molecules. The UV-Vis spectrum, however, was more instructive (Fig. 9b). The dye loading of Sp2 appears to be sufficient, as the transmittance quickly drops to 0% below 500 nm. This would indicate that rather than having too few dye molecules, Sp2 is not absorbing photons in the visible range. As it has been shown that other spiran complexes are still photoswitchable when immobilized on surfaces,13,25 the fact that it was not observed under this condition suggests that Sp2 forms aggregates on the TiO2 surface that inhibit its photochromic behavior. This is possibly due to the increased concentration of Sp2M in polar solvents, which will support aggregation of molecules as they bind.

By contrast, Sp2 maintains its monomer form in nonpolar solvent before binding to TiO2. After binding, the compound is expected to be free to open to the MC structure. And, indeed, this is exactly what was found. When toluene was used as the solvent, a strongly colored surface was created, indicating a high loading of a visibly colored compound (Fig. 10a). This corresponds to well-separated MC structures, which would indicate that the spirans were coordinated to the surface independently. Their properties diverged from here, however. Sp2 stayed the same color of red, and was unresponsive to UV light, visible light, and heat. After being left in darkness for one week, it still had not visibly lost any color, indicating a long-lived MC structure on the TiO2 surface.

We also loaded Ox2 onto the TiO2 photoanode surface in toluene (Fig. 10a). In contrast to the irreversible of Sp2M, Ox2M lost its color under ambient conditions over the course of 5 minutes, decaying to the plain white color of the undoped TiO2 photoanode surface – i.e. Ox2 maintained its photochromic properties while on the surface, reversibly changing to its green MC form Ox2M upon UV light irradiation. This was easily illustrated by using a UV LED to irradiate a small portion of the surface, which caused the irradiated section to color green, as opposed to the surroundings (Fig. 10b).
While it was previously shown that Ox2M has a shorter lifetime than Sp2M in solution, the difference between the two was not much more than an order of magnitude (Fig. 4b and 6b). Thus, it can be supposed that the TiO2 surface is favorably interacting with Sp2M, more so than Ox2M. Looking at the chemical structure (Fig. 2), the major difference between these two compounds is the different substitution on the benzopyran ring. Nitro groups, under very rare circumstances, have been shown to be capable of anchoring to TiO2,26 and that might be the case here – anchoring the –NO2 in the MC form could prevent the decay back to the closed spiran, giving rise to the observed effects. The IR spectrum of Sp2M was therefore compared to the IR spectrum of the compound anchored to TiO2 (Fig. 11). There are three main possible binding modes for a carboxylic acid to TiO2: monodentate, bidentate chelating, and bidentate bridging. These modes can be distinguished by the frequency separation of the carboxylate stretching bands.27,28 In our case, ν(C–O) was shifted from the open value of 1708 to 1681 cm−1, while ν(C–O) shifted from 1272 to 1279 cm−1. This Δν of 402 cm−1 is consistent with a monodentate binding mode, similar to an ester linkage. The binding of the carboxylate is also seen in the complete disappearance of the O–H bending mode. However, what is most interesting is the shift of the N–O stretching modes upon binding to TiO2. Changes of the N–O stretching modes were seen in the previous case of –NO2 binding to the TiO2 surface,26 where the passage of significant current through the cell caused the disappearance of the N–O stretching bands. This could indicate the first example of an –NO2 binding to TiO2 under ambient conditions.

Finally, the compounds were tested as the photosensitizing dye in DSSCs. Solar cells sensitized with Sp2 in methanol had a conversion efficiency of 0.028% compared to a 1.9% efficiency for the reference29 N-719 cell (Fig. 12a). As discussed in our previous work,29 the fairly low N719 reference efficiency is because we purposely did not used any additives or enhancements, such as adding 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), adding a compact layer, adding a scattering layer, or undergoing TiCl4 treatment to boost performance so we could isolate and only compare the effect of the dye molecules on the performance of the DSSC without any unwanted interference. Based on the UV-VIS spectra, these cells appeared to either have a low dye loading or likely a great deal of aggregation. Because of this, we experimented with a nonpolar solvent system for the binding process, an approach used in systems with similar compounds.30 When toluene was used as the solvent, the color not only improved drastically (Fig. 10a), but the overall efficiency did as well, rising by an order of magnitude to a conversion efficiency of 0.26% for Sp2 (Fig. 12b). This was mainly driven by an improved short-circuit current, Jsc, (from 0.1 mA cm−2 to 1.58 mA cm−2).29 As Jsc is the number of electrons passing through the system per unit time without a potential bias, photosensitive dyes can influence the Jsc in two main ways. First, altering the chemistry can alter the number of electrons generated from absorbed photons and secondly, altering the dye anchoring chemistry can change the number of electrons successfully injected into the TiO2 photoanode. By changing the solvent from methanol to toluene, the number of generated electrons likely improved due to better dye loading or less aggregation as visually seen in Fig. 9a and 10a. Under polar conditions, the –COOH group that is normally responsible for binding is separated from the main chromophore by two sp3-hybridized carbons, so injection efficiency would be expected to be lower through this path and explains the low short-circuit current in the methanol case. Under nonpolar conditions, –NO2 is possibly coordinated to the TiO2 surface in the MC form, and this would serve as a very efficient electron injection pathway when the compound is adsorbed. This would also match well with the natural charge separation of the compound and explain the improvement in short-circuit current in the toluene case.

In DSSCs, the open-circuit voltage, Voc, is the difference between the fermi energy level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte. Upon soaking in a nonpolar solvent, the Voc dropped to 0.33 V from the original cell's Voc of 0.48 V. This indicates that the conduction band and therefore the fermi energy level shifted to more positive values (vs. NHE).31,32 In literature, it is well known that the Voc is affected by the basicity of the chemical groups that adsorb onto the TiO2 surface. Boschloo et al.33 experimentally observed that the addition of tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) (a basic compound) can cause the TiO2 surface to become more negatively charged and this shifts the conduction band of TiO2 to more negative values (vs. NHE), leading to an increase of ∼0.34 V34 in Voc. As the TiO2 surface becomes more positively charged, the Voc decreases because the conduction band shifts to more positive values. By changing from the polar to nonpolar condition, the higher concentration of the MC form on the TiO2 surface may have altered the surface charge of TiO2 to more positive values because the dye itself has an acidic moiety and this is a possible reason for the decrease in the voltage.
While Sp2 has a good efficiency, the nature of its dual binding sites to TiO2 prevents it from relaxing back to its spiran form. By contrast, Ox2 retains its photochromic properties on TiO2 as it binds only from the flexible propanoic acid moiety (Fig. 10b). However, this very property also decreases its solar conversion efficiency to 0.002%, as it lacks an efficient electron injection pathway (Fig. 13).

4. Conclusions
We studied the properties of several photochromic spiran compounds in a variety of conditions to assess their suitability for use in a color-changing solar cell. While the studied napthospirooxazine bound to the TiO2 surface and maintained its photochromic properties, its solar conversion efficiency was quite low (0.002%). In contrast, due to secondary binding through an aromatic –NO2 group, the nitrospiropyran was found to have a reasonable solar conversion efficiency of 0.26%, while simultaneously losing its photochromic properties. These understandings are useful for designing spiran derivatives that have both photochromic properties and high solar conversion efficiency.
