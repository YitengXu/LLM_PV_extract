    , Accepted 4th July 2014First published on 8th July 2014AbstractTriphenylamine (TPA) dyes usually show relatively narrow spectral response range with respect to indoline and porphyrin based dyes. To optimize light-harvesting, WS62 and WS64 are molecularly engineered on the basis of D–A–π–A model. We employ TPA in the absence or presence of long alkoxy-chain as the electron donor, benzoxadiazole as the auxiliary acceptor, a 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) unit as the π-bridge, and cyanoacetic acid as the anchor group. The incorporated electron-withdrawing unit of benzoxadiazole enhances light harvesting by decreasing the molecular energy gap and red-shifting absorption spectra. Moreover, three D–π–A-featured dyes (S0, S1 and S2) with different length of the π-bridge are developed as co-sensitizers for WS62 and WS64. As demonstrated, the co-sensitization effect is critically dependent upon the π-conjunction length in the three co-adsorbent dyes. Dye S2 containing dithiophene unit as the π-bridge shows a promising co-sensitization result for enhancing photovoltaic efficiency. In contrast, S1 and S0 with fewer thiophene units negatively contribute to photovoltaic performances. The cocktail co-sensitization of WS62 and WS64 with S2 can compensate the peak valley of IPCE adsorbed by electrolyte near 400 nm and compact the surface of TiO2 to retard charge recombination, essentially for the optimization of photovoltaic performances. Solar cells based on the co-sensitization of WS64 and S2 show a high efficiency of 7.9% (VOC of 738 mV, JSC of 14.9 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.72), exhibiting a significant improvement by 41% compared to the WS64 alone sensitized devices under the same conditions. The charge transfer resistance (RCT) of the co-sensitized DSSCs is larger than that of DSSC comprising only WS62 or WS64 by around 10-fold, indicating that the unfavourable charge transfer from TiO2 to electrolyte is efficiently blocked by the cocktail co-sensitization of S2. These findings pave a way regarding how to choose the proper and matchable co-sensitizers for further increasing the photovoltaic performances of pure organic sensitizers.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are under extensive interdisciplinary investigation in both academia and industry because of their cost-effective and flexible solar energy conversion.1,2 Compared with ruthenium (Ru)-based dyes, metal-free organic sensitizers are low-cost and easily modified. However, organic sensitizers show a narrow spectral response range over the broad distribution of sunlight.3 Multiple dyes used as “dye cocktails”4 for co-sensitization pave a new approach to panchromatic sensitization5–7 with preferable photovoltaic performances. An excellent candidate for co-sensitization should compensate light absorption,4,8 and can be moderated for avoiding competitive adsorption. In addition, the co-sensitization dye should be able to cover the bare TiO2 surface, prevent the aggregation of dye molecules and retard charge recombination between TiO2 and electrolyte.9–14 As demonstrated, the co-sensitization strategy not only broadens the spectral response range and enhances light-harvesting,4 but also retards charge recombination on the surface of TiO2, thus making a distinct contribution for improving short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC).9
Recently, D–A–π–A organic sensitizers with the incorporation of auxiliary accepters has been intensively explored, resulting in efficient modulation of energy levels, light response as well as a significant increase in photo-stability.15–18 In this work, we developed a couple of new benzoxadiazole based D–A–π–A organic sensitizers WS62 and WS64 (Scheme 1), and demonstrated the influence of co-sensitization for improving their photovoltaic performances. Three D–π–A-featured dyes, S0, S1 and S2 (Scheme 1) containing different number of thiophene units were also developed as co-sensitizers for WS62 and WS64. Interestingly, the co-sensitization effect is critically dependent upon the π-conjunction length of the three co-sensitizers. Compared with WS64 alone, the co-sensitization of WS64 with S2 is optimized, resulting in a significant improvement by 41% in photovoltaic efficiency.

2 Experimental
2.1 Characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AM-400 MHz using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were performed using a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The absorption spectra of sensitizer dyes in solution and adsorbed on titania films were measured with a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were obtained on a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using a three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) in saturated KCl solution, and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was used as the supporting electrolyte in DCM. Ferrocene was added to each sample solution at the end of the experiment, and ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal potential reference. Unless otherwise stated, all the raw materials were commercially available from chemical reagent companies, and used without any further purification.

2.3 Fabrication of nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells
Double layer TiO2 films, Pt-counter electrodes and devices were fabricated according to our published procedures.25 A double-layer TiO2 film was composed of a 12 μm thick nanoporous TiO2 layer and a 5 μm thick scattering layer 0.12 cm2. TiO2 films were immersed in the dye solution (4 mM in a mixture of CHCl3–CH3OH = 4:1) of WS62 and WS64 for 12 h, respectively. After that, the sensitized electrodes were rinsed with dry CH2Cl2 and dried, and then were immersed into S1, S2 and S0 dye solutions (4 mM in a mixture of CHCl3–CH3OH = 4:1) for half an hour. If immersed for a long time, competitive adsorption became serious, especially in S0. Electrolyte was composed of 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.1 M lithium iodide and 0.03 M I2 in the mixed solution of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v = 85/15).
2.4 Photovoltaic performance measurements
The counter electrode (Pt-coated TCO) and the working electrode (dye-loaded TiO2 film) were sealed together by a hot-melt 30 μm-thick spacer (Surlyn, from Solaronix, Switzerland) under heat pressure. DSSCs were evaluated by recording the J–V curves with a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of Air Mass 1.5G simulated solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-91160 equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp and an AM1.5 filter) at a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm. Incident monochromatic IPCE spectra were measured by an Oriel-66902 system (Oriel Instruments). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard reference silicon solar cell (Oriel-91150), and the intensity of incident monochromatic was measured with a Si detector (Oriel-71640). In this work, 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G light is almost the same as the integrated current density from IPCE spectrum and AM1.5G solar emission spectrum, maintaining the measured efficiency reliable.
2.5 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements
EIS experiments were carried out in the dark using a ZAHNER ZENNIUM electrochemical workstation with frequency ranging from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential amplitude of 10 mV. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the ZSimpWin software (v3.10) in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Design and synthesis
In WS62 and WS64, we employed triphenylamine as the electron donor, 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) as the π-bridge, benzoxadiazole as the auxiliary electron-withdrawing unit, and cyanoacetic acid as the anchor/acceptor (Scheme 1). The difference between WS62 and WS64 is the absence or presence of alkoxy chains. Incorporating the auxiliary electron-withdrawing unit of benzoxadiazole is expected to optimize the molecular HOMO–LUMO energy gap and facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the anchor.18 Instead of the traditional thiophene unit as the π-bridge, CPDT unit can increase the conjugation degree for further narrowing the HOMO–LUMO band gap and enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer. In addition, the long alkyl chain (octyl group) substituted on CPDT unit is beneficial for suppressing dye aggregation behaviour.19–21 Because dendritic molecules are beneficial for forming a dense monolayer and effectively blocking charge recombination,11,22 three co-sensitizers (S0, S1 and S2) were developed with alkoxy-chain-decorated triphenylamine donor by the different length of the π-bridge. The synthetic routes of these dyes are depicted in Scheme 2. Suzuki coupling reaction and Knoevenagel condensation were mainly used for synthesizing the target structures that were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, and HRMS (Experimental section).

3.2 Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of WS62 and WS64 were determined in dilute CH3OH and CHCl3 mixed solution (v/v = 1:4, Fig. 1a). They show similar absorption curves with three absorption bands at around 300, 450 and 550 nm (Table 1), which is consistent with our previous results.16,17,23–25 The band located at 301 nm is due to localized π → π* transitions. Intramolecular charge transfer absorption peaks in the visible region are located at 543 and 559 nm for WS62 and WS64, respectively. Obviously, the introduction of alkoxy chains on TPA donor can red-shift the absorption band by 16 nm (ref. 26–30) and enhance the molar absorption coefficient from 3.99 × 104 to 4.70 × 104 M−1 cm−1. In addition, a third (shoulder) absorption band is observed at 454 and 464 nm for WS62 and WS64, respectively. Obviously, there is a deep valley at around 400 nm in the absorption curves of both WS62 and WS64, which may cause low IPCE response at this region, especially considering the strong light absorption by triiodide (I3−) in the electrolyte. Therefore, co-sensitization with compensating light-harvesting may benefit the device performance of both WS62 and WS64. The absorption spectra of dyes S0, S1 and S2 are shown in Fig. 1b. Upon changing the thiophene number from zero to 1 and 2, the absorption bands for S0, S1 and S2 are gradually red-shifted with their band peaks located at 418, 465 and 478 nm (Table 1), respectively. The strong absorption of these dyes at short wavelength region make them attractive for co-sensitization with WS62 and WS64.

3.3 Photovoltaic device performances
First, we studied the individual dye sensitized devices. Dyes WS62, WS64, S1, S2 and S0 based devices are denoted as A1, B1, C, D and E, respectively. Their photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. All of these dyes showed moderate power conversion efficiency of 4.4–6.3% under AM1.5 simulated sun light. Although two D–A–π–A dyes show broad light absorption range, their performances in DSSCs are not as high as reported for benzothiadiazole and quinoxaline based sensitizers.16–18 Devices based on WS62 and WS64 (A1 and B1) showed an efficiency of 4.4% (VOC of 615 mV, JSC of 9.9 mA cm−2, FF of 0.73) and 5.6% (VOC of 668 mV, JSC of 11.7 mA cm−2, FF of 0.71), respectively. Their J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2. According to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both the dyes in Table 1, we can rule out mismatch possibility in energy level because the driving forces for efficient electron injection and the dye regeneration of WS62 and WS64 are thermodynamically favourable. We speculated that the CPDT unit with a relatively large and planar structure enabled the dyes to aggregate easily. Even after incorporating two long alkyl chains on the CPDT unit,31–33 it is still not enough to efficiently suppress aggregation. On the other hand, the IPCE curves of WS62 and WS64 (Fig. 3) showed a significant valley at around 400 nm, which might be because of the combination of the low absorbance of dyes and the competitive absorption of triiodide in the electrolyte. Therefore, we investigated the effect of co-sensitization with S0, S1 and S2.

 Fig. 3  IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on WS62 and WS64 with/without the co-sensitization of S2 under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. 
The devices based on the co-sensitization of WS62 with S1, S2 and S0 are coded as A2, A3 and A4, respectively. Similarly, the devices based on the co-sensitization of WS64 with S1, S2 and S0 are coded as B2, B3 and B4, respectively. The photoanode TiO2 films were first immersed in the dye solution (4 mM in a mixture of CHCl3–CH3OH = 4:1) of WS62 and WS64 for 12 h. Then, they were immersed in S1, S2 and S0 dye solutions (4 mM in a mixture of CHCl3–CH3OH = 4:1) for half an hour. Interestingly, a significant influence on the performance of co-sensitized devices was observed. As the number of thiophene units increased, the efficiency of co-sensitized device increased significantly. Encouragingly, devices A3 and B3 based on the co-sensitization of WS62 and WS64 with S2 produced a photovoltaic efficiency of 6.5% (WS62 + S2, device A3) and 7.9% (WS64 + S2, device B3), which were significantly improved by 48% and 41% with respect to WS62 and WS64 dye alone under the same condition (Table 2), respectively. Obviously, co-sensitization with S2 increased both JSC and VOC to a great extent. In contrast, co-sensitization with S1 and S0 resulted in significantly less improvement in the photovoltaic efficiency. Therefore, the delicate molecular structure plays an important role in the co-sensitization process, which is discussed in the following theoretical studies.
To investigate the improvement in the co-sensitization of JSC (device A3, W62 + S2; device B3, WS64 + S2), their IPCE spectra were carefully compared with individual dye (device A1, WS62; device B1, WS64). As shown in Fig. 3, the co-sensitizer of S2 makes a preferable contribution to IPCE improvement, mostly around 400 nm. In general, competitive light absorption by I3− in the electrolyte affects the light-harvesting efficiency of dyes in the wavelength range of 350 to 400 nm. However, co-sensitization with S2 can recover IPCE loss caused by I3− (Fig. 3). In fact, S2 has two absorption peaks at 368 and 465 nm (Fig. 1b), which can exactly compensate light absorption in the region for enhancing light harvesting. The IPCE onsets for WS62, WS64, WS62 + S2, and WS64 + S2 are 789, 820, 770 and 810 nm, respectively. Note that the co-sensitization with S2 can blue shift the IPCE onset of WS62 and WS64 to some extent. Although the co-sensitization of S2 can replace some host dye molecules with narrow IPCE onset, the IPCE platform upon co-sensitization with S2 becomes higher, resulting in an overall increase in IPCE and JSC.34–36 Compared to individual WS62 and WS64 based devices, the VOC of co-sensitized cells were also largely improved (Table 2).
Furthermore, we studied the co-sensitized photoanode in the reverse dipping order, that is, the TiO2 films were first immersed in S series dyes for half an hour, and were then immersed in WS series dyes for 12 h. In addition to sequence dipping, immersion in a mixture of two co-sensitized dyes for 12 h was also investigated. Their photovoltaic parameters were less efficient than their corresponding devices (sensitized by WS and S series in proper order, Table 2). For example, compared with device B3, the efficiency of co-sensitized devices in the reverse order decreased to 6.7% (VOC of 664 mV, JSC of 14.2 mA cm−2, FF of 0.72), and the mixture co-sensitization was 7.1% (VOC of 683 mV, JSC of 15.8 mA cm−2, FF of 0.70) under the same condition.
3.4 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS is a versatile method to study charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, determined at a range of potentials near the VOC values of WS62, WS64, WS62 + S2, and WS64 + S2 in dark. The resulting data were fitted with an equivalent circuit to extract chemical capacitance (Cμ) and charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.37 As shown in Fig. 4, the logarithms of RCT values decreased linearly with increasing bias potential. At a fixed bias potential of 0.60 V, RCT for the co-sensitized DSSC was larger than that of DSSC, comprising only WS62 or WS64, by around 10-fold, indicating that the unfavourable charge transfer from TiO2 to electrolyte is efficiently blocked by the cocktail co-sensitization of S2.
 Fig. 4  Interfacial charge transfer resistance (RCT) in TiO2 of DSSCs based on WS62 and WS64 with/without the co-sensitization of S2 in the dark at the different potentials. 
In general, VOC is dependent upon the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox), which can be illustrated by eqn (1): (1)where ECB is the conduction band edge of TiO2, q is the elementary charge, K is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons in TiO2, NCB is the effective density of states, and Eredox is the redox potential of the electrolyte. Here, the last term Eredox/q is determined to be the redox potential of I−/I3−, which is constant in DSSCs with the I−/I3− redox couple. That is, VOC is dependent upon the first two terms (ECB and the electron concentration in TiO2). Obviously, the balance of electron density can be shifted by co-adsorbing with S2.38 We can expect that the interspaces between the molecules of WS62 or WS64 are filled by the co-sensitizer, thus suppressing the charge recombination on the surface of TiO2 and increasing injected electron lifetime in the TiO2 conduction band.
The electron lifetime τn can be estimated from the equation of τn = Cμ × RCT.37Fig. 5 shows the electron lifetime as a function of bias potential at open circuit for DSSCs based on WS62 and WS64 with/without co-sensitization. At a bias potential of 0.6 V, the electron lifetime of WS64 and WS64 + S2 are 0.0122 and 0.4350 s, respectively. Obviously, the co-sensitization of WS64 with S2 increases the electron lifetime by one order of magnitude. Similarly, the co-sensitization of WS62 with S2 increases the electron lifetime by two orders of magnitude, i.e. from 0.0012 s to 0.13 s. The prolonged electron lifetime in co-sensitization is beneficial for charge accumulation in TiO2 conduction band under open-circuit, thus increasing electron density and the Fermi level of TiO2. As is well-known, the VOC of DSSC is determined by the difference between the TiO2 Fermi level and redox potential of electrolyte. The measured electron lifetime is in agreement with the VOC values of these devices (Table 2). Therefore, the cocktail co-sensitization of S2 with WS62 and WS64 can efficiently block the interfacial charge recombination loss and enhances the electron lifetime, which accounts well for rendering higher VOC in the co-sensitized devices.

3.5 Theoretical approach
TD-DFT calculations performed with Gaussian 09 program package at the B3LYP/6-31G* (LANL2DZ for Ti atom) level39 were employed for further exploring the dependence of charge recombination on molecular geometries and orbitals. Table 3 shows the frontier molecular orbital profiles and optimized molecular structures with the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels for sensitizers and co-adsorbents. In the case of WS62 and WS64, electron density is predominately distributed along the D–A system (TPA and benzoxadiazole) at HOMO orbital; while at the LUMO orbital, electrons are transferred intramolecularly and delocalized across the entire A–π–A system. Here, electrons can successively transfer from the donor (TPA) to benzoxadiazole, then transfer to the anchor (cyanoacetic acid) and finally to TiO2.40 Additional alkoxy-chains on WS64 also upshifts the HOMO but barely influences LUMO. In the case of co-sensitized dyes (S1, S2 and S0), fusion of thiophene unit can upshift the HOMO and lower the LUMO.

Note that the bond angles of the double long alkyl chains attached on CPDT unit are 162°, 163° for WS62 and WS64, respectively, under the optimized configuration when adsorbed on the TiO2 film. Both the large bond angles and long alkoxy chains are expected to extend the intermolecular distance. The electrolyte permeates through the TiO2 surface, thus causing serious charge recombination. In addition, the alkoxy-chains may block co-adsorbents anchoring on TiO2 films. Consequently, a suitable molecular size is critically important for co-adsorbents.
From theoretical calculations (as shown in Fig. 6), the distance from the TiO2 films to alkoxy chains in WS62 and WS64 is 8.4 Å, and the conjugated length for S0, S1 and S2 are 4.3, 8.1 and 12.1 Å, respectively. Obviously, the co-adsorbent of S2 has a relative longer conjugated bridge than S1 and S0, ensuring that S2 has an opportunity to overcome the barrier of alkoxy chain and anchor on the TiO2 film. In addition to the dendritic alkoxy-chains, the co-sensitization of S2 with a proper conjugation bridge can further guarantee the formation of a compact sensitized layer, and preventing I3− from approaching TiO2 film (Fig. 7). Meanwhile, S1 and S0 with a shorter length may have low possibility to pass through the barrier when dipped in the corresponding dye bath.

4 Conclusions
We apply the co-sensitization strategy for benzoxadiazole based D–A–π–A featured metal-free dyes (WS62 and WS64), especially focused on compensating light-harvesting and retarding charge recombination. As observed, the JSC of co-sensitized solar cell devices is heavily dependent upon the chemical structure of the co-absorbents. As a proper π-conjunction size, co-sensitizer dye S2 containing dithiophene unit can efficiently permeate into the benzoxadiazole based D–A–π–A dye molecules, resulting in a compact co-sensitization layer. Co-sensitization with S2 can not only compensate the peak valley of IPCE near 400 nm, but can also realize retard charge recombination. Indeed, the increase in JSC predominates. The photovoltaic efficiencies of WS62 and WS64 improved by 48% and 41%, and increased from 4.4% and 5.6% to 6.5% and 7.9%, respectively. This work provides insight on how to choose the proper and matchable co-sensitizers for further increasing the photovoltaic performances of pure organic sensitizers.
