    , Accepted 16th November 2012First published on 19th November 2012AbstractA high porous molybdenum sulfide–carbon (MoS2–C) hybrid film was prepared by using an in situ hydrothermal route. The MoS2–C hybrid film served as a low-cost and high efficient platinum-free counter electrode for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel curve analysis indicate that the MoS2–C electrode possesses low charge transfer resistance on the electrolyte–electrode interface, high electrocatalytic activity and fast reaction kinetics for the reduction of triiodide to iodide at the counter electrode, which is due to large specific surface area and special structure and compositions of MoS2–C film. A DSSC with the novel MoS2–C counter electrode achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 7.69% under standard light illumination, which exceeds that of the DSSC with a Pt counter electrode (6.74%).
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention in the past decades as a promising renewable energy source due to their relatively high efficiency, environmental friendliness, simple fabrication process and low cost.1–4 A DSSC based on traditional platinum (Pt) counter electrode (CE), cobalt(II/III) electrolyte and zinc porphyrin dye has achieved a power conversion efficiency over 12%.4 However, although Pt has high conductivity, catalytic activity and chemical stability, it is one of the most expensive components in DSSCs.2,3 In addition, the Pt can be decomposed to PtI4 in traditional I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte, which will affect the long-term stability of the DSSC.5,6 Thus, it is necessary to develop an economic, stable, effective and Pt-free CE. Many materials, such as carbon materials,7–9 conducting polymers,10–12 and inorganic materials including transition metal sulfides, nitrides and carbides,13–16 have been attempted to replace the Pt as CE in DSSCs.
As a typical layered transition metal sulfide, molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is composed of three atom layers: a Mo layer sandwiched between two S layers, and the triple layers are stacked and held together by weak van der Waals interactions.17 Due to its analogous structure to graphene, MoS2 has attracted great interests and was proposed as a potential CE candidate in DSSCs. MoS2 is extensively applied as solid lubricants and spent hydrodesulfurization catalysts.18–20 However, only a few reports focused on the application of MoS2 as the CE in DSSCs. Very recently, Wu et al.21 employed MoS2 and tungsten sulfide (WS2) as CE materials for DSSCs and showed high photovoltaic efficiencies of 7.59% and 7.73%, respectively. On the other hand, hybrids of inorganic compounds and carbonaceous materials maybe can improve the electrocatalytic property of the CEs. Li et al.22 reported a composite CE composed of TiN with high electrocatalytic activity and carbon black with good electrical conductivity, and an improved photovoltaic performance of DSSC was obtained. Wu et al.23 reported high photovoltaic performance when MoC and WC particles were embedded in ordered nanomesoporous carbon. Also, Lin et al.24 demonstrated enhanced performance of a MoS2–graphene composite catalytic film prepared by simply mixing graphene oxide nanosheets with MoS2. In these works, the electrocatalytic activity of metal carbides, nitrides, and sulfide is improved due to the fast electron-transport network provided by the carbon-based materials.
Here, a high porous molybdenum sulfide–carbonaceous (MoS2–C) hybrid material was synthesized by a hydrothermal route. The hybrid was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel measurements. The results indicate that the MoS2–C hybrid possesses large specific surface area and excellent electrocatalytic activity. A DSSC based on the MoS2–C hybrid CE significantly improved its photovoltaic performance.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
Sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), thiourea, polyethylene glycol with average molecular weight of 2000 (PEG 2000), glucose, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), isopropanol, 4-tert-butyl-pyridine (TBP), acetonitrile and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Agent Ltd, China. The sensitized dye N719 [RuL2(NCS)2·2TBA, L = 2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylic acid, TBA = tetrabutylammonium] was obtained from Solaronix SA (Switzerland). All reagents are of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. FTO glass substrates (8 Ω cm−2, Hartford Glass Co., USA) were cut into 2.5 × 1.5 cm2 carefully and ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in detergent, acetone and distilled water for 10 min each and then stored in isopropyl alcohol.
Synthesis of MoS2–C hybrid
4.84 g Na2MoO4·2H2O, 6.12 g thiourea and 0.5 g PEG 2000 were dissolved in 120 ml distilled water, followed by ultrasonication and stirring for 30 min until a clear and homogeneous solution was achieved. After that, 0.5 g, 1.0 g, 1.5 g, 2.0 g or 2.5 g of glucose was added into the reaction solution, followed by further sonication for another 30 min before being transferred into a 150 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, and then heated in an oven at 200 °C for 48 h without intentional control of ramping or cooling rate. The product was collected by filtration and washed with ethanol and distilled water at least 5 times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 24 h. The above black precipitates were the final conductivity active materials, which were denoted as MoS2-1.13-C, MoS2-2.23-C, MoS2-3.30-C, MoS2-4.35-C and MoS2-5.38-C. The values 1.13, 2.23, 3.30, 4.35, and 5.38 represent the weight ratio of carbon in all mixed reactants.
Preparation of counter electrodes
Typically, the MoS2–C CE was prepared by a slurry coating procedure on the cleaned FTO substrate. The slurry consisting of 80 wt% MoS2–C hybrids, 10 wt% acetylene black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride grinded together and then was dissolved in NMP. Then the slurry was further sonicated for another 30 min, and kept stirring for 12 h. Subsequently, the as-prepared slurry was coated on the FTO substrates using a doctor blade method. In our experiments, the thickness for the CE film was controlled by the transparent adhesive tape layers (one layer thickness of transparent adhesive tape is about 4 μm). The electrodes were dried at 100 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven.
Fabrication of TiO2 anode and DSSC
A TiO2 anode was prepared as described previously.25,26 In brief, a thin TiO2 blocking layer was deposited on the FTO substrate by immersing the FTO in 0.15 M TiCl4 isopropanol solution for 12 h, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min in air. Subsequently, a TiO2 layer with a particle size of 10–20 nm was coated onto the blocking layer by using the doctor blade method, and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min in air. The resultant TiO2 film was sensitized by immersing the TiO2 film in a 0.3 mM dye N719 ethanol solution for 24 h. Thus a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode with thickness of 6–8 μm was obtained. After that, the photoanode and a CE were clipped together and wrapped with thermoplastic hot-melt Surlyn. The DSSC was fabricated by injecting the liquid electrolyte (0.05 M of I2, 0.1 M of LiI, and 0.6 M of tetrabutylammonium iodide and 0.5 M of TBP in acetonitrile) in the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the CE. The active area of the DSSC was 0.4 × 0.5 cm2.
Characterization and measurements
The micromorphologies of the MoS2–C hybrids were observed by using a JSM-7600F field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The morphology of the samples was observed using a JEM-2100 (JEOL, Japan) transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with EDS to measure the elements contained in the samples. The compositions of samples were studied using a glancing incident X-ray diffractometer (XRD 6000, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). The 2θ angular regions between 10° and 80° were investigated at a scan rate of 4° min−1 with a step of 0.02. The specific surface area (BET) was measured using a JW-K analyzer by nitrogen absorption. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was implemented, in which an as-prepared CE was taken as the working electrode, one 4 cm2 of Pt sheet as auxiliary electrode and one Pt wire as reference electrode in the acetonitrile solution consisting of 10 mM of LiI, 1 mM of I2, and 0.1 M of LiClO4 in a three-electrode one-compartment cell. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out with two identical electrodes, sealed with thermoplastic hot-melt Surlyn and leaving an exposed area of 0.64 cm2. The electrolyte used in the DSSC tests was also injected into the cells. The EIS tests were carried out simulating open-circuit conditions at ambient atmosphere by using an electrochemical measurement system (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenhua Device Company, China) at a constant temperature of 20 °C with AC signal amplitude of 20 mV in the frequency range from 0.1 to 105 Hz at 0 V DC bias in the dark. The complex nonlinear least square analyses of the Nyquist plots were analyzed with the ZSimDemo version 3.30d. The spectral response of the DSSC was determined by measuring the wavelength dependence of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) by focusing light from a xenon lamp through a monochromator (PXJ43B11, Japan) onto the cell.
The photovoltaic testing of the DSSC was carried out by measuring the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) characteristic curve under white light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5) from a solar simulator (XQ-500W, Shanghai Photoelectricity Device Company, China) in ambient atmosphere. The fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC were calculated according to the following equations:3 (1) (2)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage at the point of maximum power output in the J–V curve, respectively.
Results and discussion
Compositions and morphologies

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of MoS2 and MoS2–C hybrid synthesized by using the hydrothermal route at 200 °C for 48 h. In Fig. 1a, the diffraction peaks at 14.42°, 32.64°, 35.92°, 44.12° and 57.80° can be assigned as the contribution from MoS2,27 which are in good agreement with the hexagonal structure (MoS2: 75–1539); in particular the strong peak at 14.42° indicates a well-stacked layered structure.28 This absence of strong diffraction peak of MoS2 reveals that stacking of the single layers very possibly takes place,29 which is named graphene-like structure. In Fig. 1b, two very weak diffraction peaks at 26.26° and 46.66° are found, which should be attributed to the signals of amorphous carbon offered by carbonization of glucose in the hydrothermal process.30 In addition, as shown in Fig. 1b, there is a new strong diffraction peak for the MoS2–C hybrid at 18.23° and marked with ▼, which is very possibly attributed to the spacing between the MoS2 layer and the carbon layer.

The synthesized samples were characterized by EDS (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†). From Fig. S1,† the signals of C, O, S and Mo elements can be seen. The XRD and EDS results indicate that the MoS2–C hybrid was synthesized successfully.
The SEM images of the commercial MoS2, hydrothermal synthesized MoS2, and hydrothermal synthesized MoS2–C hybrid are shown in Fig. 2. The commercial MoS2 (Fig. 2a) shows a large surface area with lamellar structure. The hydrothermal synthesized MoS2 and MoS2–C hybrid (Fig. 2b and c) are composed of lots of interlaced nanosheets. Interestingly, the thickness of intercalated nanosheets in the spherical MoS2–C hybrid is thinner than that in MoS2. This implies that the incorporated glucose can accelerate the growth speed of MoS2 nanosheets and increase the specific surface area, which is ready for the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity. Fig. 2d shows the HRTEM image of MoS2–C hybrid.

Fig. 3 shows N2 adsorption isotherm of the MoS2–C hybrid. The pore size distribution curve of the MoS2–C is inserted in Fig. 3. Based on these measurements, the specific surface area and the average pore diameter calculated by the BET method and by the BJH method are about 385.43 m2 g−1 and 6.8 nm, respectively. The total pore volume was about 0.66 cm3 g−1. This means that synthesized MoS2–C hybrid possesses a highly porous structure and large specific surface area, which may be the key factors to enhance the performance for DSSC.

Cyclic voltammetry analysis

Fig. 4a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of Pt, MoS2 and MoS2–C electrodes in I3−/I− system at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 from −0.4 to 0.4 V.31 It can be seen that the MoS2, MoS2–C and Pt electrodes have cathodic peak potentials −0.197, −0.151 and −0.191 V, respectively. Also, the MoS2–C electrode has larger oxidation and reduction current densities than the Pt electrode, The smaller cathodic peak potential (absolute value) and larger current density for MoS2–C indicate its lower overpotential and better electrocatalytic activity, and faster reaction velocity for I3− reduction, which can be ascribed to the larger specific surface area and the synergistic effect of the combination of carbon and MoS2 for the MoS2–C electrode.

Fig. 4b shows the CVs of MoS2–C electrodes with different carbon contents. With carbon content increasing from 1.13 to 3.30 wt%, the absolute value of cathodic current density increases, and the cathodic potential is more positive. The electrode doped with 3.30 wt% carbon achieves the highest Ipc absolute value of 3.05 mA cm−2 and the lowest Vpc absolute value of 0.15 V. When the weight ratio of carbon percentage increases to 4.35 wt% or 5.38 wt%, it has a slightly negative effect on the electrocatalytic activities of CEs, which maybe due to more defects produced by a mismatched hybrid ratio.
Fig. S2† shows the CV curves of MoS2–C electrodes with different thicknesses. It can be observed that the thickness of the electrode has no significant influence on the cathodic potential; but the cathodic peak current density increases with the thickness, and reached the highest cathodic current density when the thickness was about 12 μm. The cathodic peak current density decreases with further increasing of the thickness to 16 or 20 μm. This indicates that a suitable electrode thickness is important for improving the I3− reduction on the MoS2–C electrode.

Fig. 5a shows a 100-cycles CVs for highly porous MoS2–C electrode at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The curves shape and redox peak current density are not changed after 100 times cycles. The CVs for the MoS2–C electrode with different scan rates are shown in Fig. 5b; it can be observed that both the oxidation and reduction peaks gradually and regularly shift to the more positive and negative values with increasing scan rates. According to Fig. 5b, the relationship between current density and (scan rate)1/2 is made and shown in Fig. 5c, the current density versus (scan rate)1/2 plots have a good linear relationship. This means that the I3− reduction on the MoS2–C electrode is a diffusion limited process in the reaction mechanism, and there is no specific interaction between I−/I3− redox couple and electrodes.32,33

Electrochemical impedance analysis
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) with the symmetrical cells consisting of two identical Pt, MoS2 and MoS2–C CEs were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 6a; the corresponding EIS parameters are listed in Table 1, in which the Rs is associated with the series resistance of the electrolyte and electrodes, and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte–electrode interface. No Warburg diffusion resistance (Rdiff, the second semicircle) appeared at low frequency in the EIS test, which may be because a very thin spacer was used in our EIS measurement devices, and the electrolyte is a liquid.34

As seen as in Fig. 6a, the Rct values for the MoS2 and Pt electrodes are 4.13 and 2.29 Ω cm2, respectively. The MoS2–C electrode has a decreased Rct of 2.07 Ω cm2. This is due to the large specific surface area and high conductivity for the MoS2–C hybrid, which improve the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode.

Fig. 6b shows the Tafel curves for the Pt, MoS2 and MoS2–C electrodes. From Fig. 6b, the MoS2–C electrode has a large exchange current density (J0) compared with Pt and pristine MoS2 electrodes, which means higher electrocatalytic activity and lower charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte–electrode interface. The results are agreement with the EIS measurements (Fig. 6a), since J0 is in inverse proportion to Rct according to eqn (3). The lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrolyte–electrode interface reduces the interface loss of charge transportation, and enhances charge collection efficiency, which will increase the photocurrent (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the DSSCs. (3)
From Fig. 6b, it also can be seen that the MoS2–C electrode has a large limiting current density (Jlim), which depends on the diffusion coefficient of the I−/I3− redox couple in the DSSC according to eqn (4):35 (4)where R is the gas constant, D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, l is the spacer thickness, T, Rct, F and n have their usual meaning. Namely, the EIS and Tafel results explain the good photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on the MoS2–C electrode.

Fig. 7 and Table 2 show the influence of carbon content on the performance of the DSSCs; the Rct of MoS2–C electrode decreases gradually with increasing carbon content from 1.13 wt% to 3.30 wt%. In particular, the sample with the carbon content of 3.30 wt% exhibits the smallest Rct of 2.07 Ω cm2 among all hybrid electrodes, suggesting excellent electrocatalytic activity. The J0 and Jlim of the MoS2–C electrode are inversely proportional to Rct, and increase gradually with increasing carbon contents. The change tendency of J0 and Jlim in the Tafel curves of Fig. 7b is in agreement with the EIS. This proves that suitable carbon contents can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity and the conductivity of the electrodes due to the synergistic catalytic effect by combining the carbon and MoS2. This result is accordance with the observation from the CV tests.

Fig. S3† shows the EIS curves of MoS2–C electrodes with different thicknesses. It is observed that the impedance of the MoS2–C electrode is greatly dependent on its thickness. The Rct first decreases with increasing thickness of the electrode from 4 to 12 μm, and then has a negative effect on the impedance with further increasing the thickness to 16 or 20 μm. The highly porous MoS2–C electrode prepared with a thickness of 12 μm exhibits the lowest Rct of 2.07 Ω cm2, thus indicating the most excellent electrocatalytic activity. Notably, the EIS is more affected by the thickness compared to the CVs. Such a large difference may be possibly caused by the measurement environment: the samples for CV tests were dipped in electrolyte solution, and can be wetted completely; while the electrolyte used in EIS was injected into the cells, which for the thicker catalytic films is difficult to penetrate.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs

Fig. 8 shows the IPCE curves of the DSSCs based on the Pt, MoS2 and MoS2–C CEs. The IPCE of the DSSCs with these CEs have similar photoelectric response spectra in the 300–750 nm range; the strong photoelectric response of IPCEs at 340 nm was mainly due to the direct band gap photo-electron excitation of TiO2.36 The IPCE of the DSSC using the MoS2 CE has its highest photoelectric response of 44.6% at 520 nm, which is lower than that of the DSSC using the Pt CE (60.9%). It is apparent that the DSSC using the highly porous MoS2–C CE exhibits the highest photoelectric response of 67.3% at 520 nm, which is 10.5% higher than that of the DSSC based on the Pt CE, which may result in a higher Jsc than that of Pt CE.

Fig. 9 shows the J–V curves of DSSCs based on Pt, MoS2 and MoS2–C CEs under irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. The obtained photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DSSC based on the MoS2–C CE achieves a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.07 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.75 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.68 and a conversion efficiency (η) of 7.69%, which are much higher than those of DSSCs based on MoS2 and Pt CEs. Fig. S4 and Table S1† confirm that the doping with 3.30 wt% carbon and the thickness of 12 μm form the optimal choice. The performance improvement for the DSSC based on MoS2–C can be attributed to the large specific surface area and the synergistic effect of the combination of carbon and MoS2, which results in low charge transfer resistance on the electrolyte–electrode interface, high electrocatalytic activity and fast reaction kinetics for the reduction of triiodide to iodide at the counter electrode. These factors have been analyzed in the aforementioned CV, EIS and Tafel sections.

Conclusions
A molybdenum sulfide–carbon (MoS2–C) hybrid material was synthesized by using an in situ hydrothermal route, and was used as a Pt-free counter electrode in a dye-sensitized solar cell. The morphology observation, cyclic voltammetry characterization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis and Tafel curve measurements indicate that the hybrid electrode possesses highly porous structure, large specific surface area, low charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte–electrode interface, good electrocatalytic activity and fast reaction kinetics for the I−/I3− redox reaction, which is due to the synergistic effect of combining carbon and MoS2. Under optimal conditions, the solar cell based on the MoS2–C counter electrode achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 7.69% under simulated solar light illumination at 100 mW cm−2, which exceeds that of the solar cell based on a Pt counter electrode (6.74%). These results demonstrates the feasibility of using low-cost transition metal sulfide–carbon hybrid materials as Pt-free counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells.
