    , Accepted 4th July 2022First published on 5th July 2022AbstractThe diverse molecular stacking tuned by peripheral halogens in non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) significantly affects the molecular physicochemical properties, the film morphologies and thus the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite the crucial role of peripheral halogens, few explorations have been performed to bridge peripheral halogenation with molecular stackings and device performances, especially for the state-of-the-art Y-series. Herein, a series of high-efficient NFAs, CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl, are constructed with the same backbone but different peripheral halogenations in both conjugate extended central units and end groups. Single-crystal analysis indicates that CH-6F possesses similar molecular packings to Y6; however, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl with chloro-substitutions demonstrate several quite unique packing modes of end unit to central unit, etc. Compared with CH-6F and Y6, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl possess greatly reduced electron reorganization energies and shorter intermolecular packing distances, and exhibit more balanced charge mobilities, better phase separation, and lower energy disorders when blended with the PM6 donor. Furthermore, the reduced energy offsets between charge transfer and local exciton states for CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl result in an enhanced hybridization of these two states and thus suppress the non-radiative recombination losses in OSCs. Consequently, high-efficient OSCs are afforded by utilizing CH-series NFAs with a champion PCE of 18.22% and a markedly reduced ΔVnr of 0.203 V in CH-4Cl-based ternary devices. Our study reveals that such a slight modification of peripheral halogens could cause quite different but superior intermolecular packings, rendering peripheral halogenation engineering as an effective strategy to further boost PCEs of high-performance OSCs through delicate molecular stacking control.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention in both academic and industrial fields due to their great advantages including solution processing, low-cost, and great potential in achieving flexible or semi-transparent devices, together with continuing increased power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1–6 Traditional electron acceptors based on fullerene have dominated OSCs for decades; however, fullerene acceptors come with several challenges such as difficulties in making chemical modifications, absorbing only high-energy photons, and unstable device performance.7,8 In the last few years, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged and boosted the PCE of tandem OSCs towards 20% and single-junction OSCs towards 19.6% owing to their stronger and broader absorption in visible and near-infrared regions, adjustable energy levels, being easy to chemically modify, and more importantly, strong and superior molecular stacking.9–18 NFAs usually feature planar conjugated backbones and exhibit various molecular stacking and aggregation behaviors during the film casting process.19,20 This can result in significantly improved exciton dissociation, charge transport and recombination, and thus a much enhanced PCE of OSCs.21–24 Therefore, optimizing the phase separated feature of active layers through molecular stacking control should be the key point in further improvement of device performance. Nevertheless, how to conduct molecular structural engineering to tune the molecular stacking precisely and further afford suitable film micromorphologies still poses great challenges.
Diverse peripheral groups, especially for halogens, have been employed to modify NFAs,25–29 which can result in multiple changes of molecular properties by (I) tuning the energy levels, (II) modifying the absorption spectra, (III) improving carrier mobilities, (IV) changing intermolecular interactions and crystallinity, etc.30–32 In addition to the experimental studies above, many theoretical studies have also testified that peripheral halogenation tends to enlarge the dipole moment variations remarkably between the ground and first excited states of NFAs, which could minimize the exciton binding energy and thus improve the exciton dissociation efficiency even with a very small driving force.33,34 Moreover, peripheral halogenation can simultaneously enhance molecular packing orders and crystallization, optimize film morphologies,35,36 facilitate carrier mobility and decrease the resistance of the bulk heterojunction.37 Among different halogenations, fluorine and chloride with large electronegativity but a small atomic radius are particularly effective in tuning the physicochemical characteristics of NFAs without introducing undesirable steric hindrance,38,39 such as enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects,40 down-shifting molecular energy levels,41 and promoting nanoscale aggregation.42 In detail, the great improvement of OSC performance caused by peripheral fluorination or chlorination of NFAs could be generally attributed to two aspects. At the single-molecular level, such a halogenation could render suitable energy levels, enhance light absorption, and improve excited state lifetimes.43–46 At the level of molecular aggregation, peripheral halogenation could usually enhance intermolecular interaction of NFAs, shorten π–π stacking distance, and enhance molecular packing orders and crystallization, thus leading to better film morphologies and reduced energy losses in OSCs.35,36,47–50 Although both experimental and theoretical studies have highlighted the irreplaceable effects of halogenation on improved PCEs of OSCs, the lack of systematical investigation, especially on the state-of-the-art Y-series NFAs, makes the connection of halogenation with molecular packings, active layer morphology, charge transfer/transport dynamics and device performances of the resulting OSCs as a crucial but still unaddressed issue.
Given the dominant molecular packing mode of end unit to end unit (E/E) observed in the single crystals of ITIC51,52 and F53,54 series NFAs, significantly improved photodynamic processes and even PCEs have been generally achieved after halogen substitution on the end groups.55,56 However, in a typical Y6 single crystal,57–59 the central unit of benzothiadiazole (BT) is also largely involved in molecular packing and leads to a much more effective three-dimensional nanoscale network, which is significantly different from those in ITIC and F series NFAs. Based on these results, it is expected that the degree of molecular packing affected by the halogenation on central units may be no less than that of on end groups in Y-series NFAs, and further improvement of OSCs possibly could be rendered if suitable halogenation can be also conducted on central units of high-performance Y-series NFAs. Nevertheless, very few investigations have been performed thus far to unveil the crucial effects of central unit halogenation on molecular stackings, energy losses and even PCEs of OSCs in Y-series NFAs. Two reasons should account for the rare trials: (I) there are no extra reactive sites for further halogenation based on the chemical structure of the BT central unit; and (II) the construction of central heterocyclic units is very challenging when attempting to replace the BT central unit. Although facing great challenges, it is really meaningful to disclose the effects of halogenation in both central units and end groups on molecular stackings and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, since that may make a major contribution to the optimized molecular packing modes57,58,60,61 of NFAs and also the improvement of OSCs.
In this contribution, a new series of NFAs with the same benzoquinoxaline central unit62–64 has been constructed by conjugated extension of the central unit, affording another two chemical active sites on the central unit. In order to reveal the significant effects of halogenation on molecular stacking, herein diverse halogen atoms were introduced at different positions alternating from end groups to central units, to manipulate the molecular packings of NFAs. Fig. 1a displays the chemical structures of NFAs studied here, ranging from the all-fluorinated CH-6F to both fluorinated and chlorinated CH-4Cl, and further all-chlorinated CH-6Cl. With CH-series NFAs, a comprehensive study has been conducted to systematically probe the significant effects of peripheral halogenation on their single crystal packings, disclosing the peripheral halogenation induced completely different crystal systems and quite unique molecular packing modes. Moreover, this superior molecular packing optimizes film morphology, improves photovoltaic performances, and reduces energy losses of the resulting OSCs, finally affording a series of high-efficient OSCs by utilizing CH-series NFAs with a champion PCE of 18.22% and a markedly reduced ΔVnr of 0.203 V in CH-4Cl-based ternary devices. Our results indicate that controlling molecular stacking modes by peripheral halogenation engineering should be a possible avenue toward OSCs with higher efficiency.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The successful synthesis routes to CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl are displayed in Scheme S1 (ESI†) and the detailed procedures and characterization studies are described in Schemes S2–S5 and Fig. S38–S54 (ESI†). Herein, taking the synthesis of CH-6Cl as an example (Fig. 1b), the indispensable but challenging step of phenazine conversion from benzothiadiazole was conducted by an in situ reaction in a good yield of 74%, which was developed by converting compound 1 into an intermediate diimine (1a) first through reduction and subsequent oxidation, further followed by an in situ condensation with a diamine (Note S1, ESI†). Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 1c present the normalized absorption spectra of CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl in solutions and neat films, respectively. In dilute chloroform solutions, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl possess maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) of 803 and 809 nm, bathochromically shifted by 4 and 10 nm, respectively, compared with that of 799 nm for CH-6F after chlorination. Moreover, the enhanced molar extinction coefficients (ε) of 2.27 × 105 and 2.20 × 105 M−1 cm−1 can be also afforded by CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl in comparison to that of 2.11 × 105 M−1 cm−1 by CH-6F. From solutions to thin films, all CH-series NFAs exhibit an obvious red-shift (∼52 nm), demonstrating that there exists an effective intermolecular π–π stacking at the solid state (Fig. 1c).65 The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl were calculated from their thin-film absorption edge (λonset) of 879, 888 and 914 nm, being 1.41, 1.39 and 1.36 eV, respectively (Table 1). The change of bandgaps should be ascribed to the variations of energy levels induced by diverse peripheral halogenations. Therefore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to evaluate the energy levels of CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl (Fig. 1d and Fig. S2, ESI†). Based on the oxidation and reduction onsets, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) energy levels can be estimated to be −5.70 and −3.85 eV for CH-6F, −5.74 and −3.91 eV for CH-4Cl, and −5.79 and −3.97 eV for CH-6Cl. Although fluorine has a larger electronegativity than a chlorine atom, the enhanced electron-donating p–π conjugation of fluorine atoms with the broad conjugated backbone of NFAs enables the upshifted LUMO/HOMO of CH-6F compared to those of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl. Note that a similar tendency has also been observed from the DFT calculations shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The derived energy gaps from CV measurements for CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl can be determined to be 1.85, 1.83 and 1.82 eV, respectively, which agree well with their optical bandgaps.

The thermal stability of CH-series NFAs was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†), all the three NFAs exhibit excellent thermal stability at decomposition temperatures of 332, 329 and 332 °C for CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl, respectively, at a 5% weight loss. In addition, a clear acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) feature for the three NFAs can be indicated by the characteristic peak–valley–peak plots along the longest direction of the molecular backbone (Fig. 1e and Fig. S5, ESI†) for their frontier orbital charge density difference (ΔQ).66 As it has been proposed before, such a unique feature with a peak–valley–peak plot of ΔQ for A–D–A type NFAs will enhance their molar extinction coefficient, facilitate better exciton separation and charge transport, and thus lead to better performance OSCs with small energy losses compared with some other types of molecules.
Molecular packing in single crystals
As we have discussed above, different peripheral halogenations in NFAs could have a significant effect on molecular stacking. Therefore, single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements of CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl were performed first to investigate the molecular geometry and stacking mode variations caused by diverse peripheral halogenations. The needle-like single crystals with a reddish-brown metallic luster for CH-series NFAs were grown in chloroform by a slow solvent diffusion method using n-hexane or methanol as the antisolvents (see the experimental section for details, ESI†). The related parameters of CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl crystals are listed in Table S1 (ESI†) and those of Y6 were obtained from the literature.57,58 As illustrated in Fig. 2a–d, all CH-series NFAs exhibit a similar banana-curved and helical molecular geometry to that of Y6. Among them, CH-6F and Y6 both have two configurations (Fig. S6, ESI†), whereas CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl have only one configuration. Note that the fewer conformations of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl should be conducive to the more ordered molecular stacking and lower energetic disorder which will be discussed below. More interestingly, the molecular torsion angle consisting of planes built from the two end groups is 3.1° for CH-6F, 2.8° for CH-4Cl and 18.5° for CH-6Cl, all much smaller than that of 22.7° for Y6. This is consistent with the observed stronger non-covalent S–N secondary interaction between the central unit and bridged thiophene with a van der Waals distance of ∼3.30 Å formed only in the CH-series NFA molecules (the non-bonding S–N distance is ∼3.50 Å,67 Fig. S7, ESI†). The relatively larger torsion angle of CH-6Cl with respect to those of CH-6F and CH-4Cl may be caused by the larger atomic radius of chlorine atoms on the central units. The extended conjugated backbones in combination with their unique S–N non-covalent secondary interactions enhance the planarity and rigidity of CH-series NFAs greatly, which could theoretically lead to a reduction of electron reorganization energies (λ).58,68 As can be expected, the calculated λ values for CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl are 145.5, 135.4 and 136.6 meV, respectively, smaller than that of 148.0 meV for Y6 (Table 1). The smaller λ may render CH-series NFAs as better charge transport materials than Y6 based on Marcus charge-transfer theory.69

Y6 and CH-6F both have two configurations and all configurations have been extracted in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and other views of indicated crystals are displayed in Fig. S8–S11, ESI.† 
As we have mentioned above, not only end groups but also central units can effectively participate in the compact molecular stackings in Y-series NFAs, that is why peripheral halogenations on both end groups and central units have been performed in this work. As shown in Fig. 2e–h, different peripheral halogenations indeed result in dramatically different single crystal structures for CH-series NFAs. In the reported Y6 single crystal, which belongs to a monoclinic system,57,58 the central unit plays a unique role in constructing the three-dimensional (3D) network with rectangle-shaped voids of ∼22.2 × 29.2 Å. From Y6 to CH-6F with an extended central unit but the same fluorinated terminals, the single crystal of CH-6F could also be attached to the monoclinic system with similar rectangle-shaped voids. However, CH-6F forms much smaller voids of ∼14.7 × 26.3 Å than Y6, which should be caused by the π-conjugated extension of central units. When substituting the peripheral fluorine atoms on the terminals of CH-6F with chlorine atoms, the single crystal of CH-4Cl exhibits a dramatically changed crystalline system of trigonal and a small circle-shaped void with a diameter of ∼20.0 Å. Further replacing the fluorines on the central units with chlorides, the crystalline system for CH-6Cl single crystal continues to transform into a triclinic system with rectangle-shaped voids of ∼13.1 × 19.2 Å. As we expected, such a little modification of peripheral halogens on the same backbone significantly affects the corresponding crystalline systems and the multi-dimensionally intermolecular stacking networks, which may also have an influence on charge transfer/transport dynamics in active layers.
Intrinsically, the significant differences of crystal frameworks discussed above in the crystals of related NFAs should be caused by different peripheral halogenations and thus diverse intermolecular packing modes. Therefore, all the packing modes with intermolecular potentials >|70| kJ mol−1 are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S12 (ESI†). From the single-crystal data shown in Fig. 3a–d, both Y6 and CH-6F possess four similar packing modes, including end unit to end unit (“E/E” mode), dual end unit to bridge unit (“dual E/b” mode), end unit to end unit and central unit to central unit (“E/E + C/C” mode), which account for their same monoclinic crystal system. After chlorination on the end groups, CH-4Cl maintains a similar “E/E” mode to CH-6F, whereas displays another newly observed distinctive mode of dual end unit to central unit (“dual E/C” mode) (Fig. 3f). With further chlorination on the central unit, the common packing mode of “E/E” mode in Y6 and CH-6F can be also observed in CH-6Cl; nevertheless, another two different packing modes of dual central unit to bridge unit (“dual C/b” mode) and end unit to central unit (“E/C” mode) emerged (Fig. 3h). In general, compared to the four packing modes in both Y6 and CH-6F, the simplified molecular packing modes of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl may result in more ordered molecular packing, lower energetic disorders and thus reduced non-radiative recombinations. As is known, the unique “E/E + C/C” mode was first observed in Y6 series NFAs and plays probably the most essential role in forming their 3D packing network in single crystals.57 Although CH-6F also displays the four similar packing modes to Y6, its “E/E + C/C” packing mode exhibits a larger molecular packing overlap because of the extended central unit, leading to a much enlarged intermolecular potential of 236.4 kJ mol−1 and closer packing distance of 3.35 Å than that of 198.6 kJ mol−1 and 3.37 Å for Y6 as displayed in Fig. 3a, 3c and Table 2. With peripheral chlorinations, the packing modes of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl have been greatly changed and simplified. Among them, the “E/E-2” mode in CH-6Cl affords a greatly enlarged intermolecular potential of 140.9 kJ mol−1 with respect to that of 85.5 kJ mol−1 for the same mode in CH-6F. More importantly, the newly formed packing modes of “dual C/b” and “E/C” also present relatively large intermolecular potentials of 194.5 and 86.3 kJ mol−1, respectively, indicating strong intermolecular interactions and possibly leading to a more efficient charge transport for CH-6Cl. As for that of CH-4Cl, the “E/C” mode in CH-6Cl transforms into the “dual E/C” mode which possesses a much increased molecular packing overlap. The π–π packing distance of CH-4Cl in the “dual E/C” mode can be estimated to be 3.22/3.25 Å, significantly smaller than not only 3.46 Å for “E/C” in CH-6Cl but also ∼3.35 Å for the other effective packing modes in Y6 and CH-6F. The small π–π packing distance in combination with the sufficient molecular packing overlap for the quite unique “dual E/C” mode in CH-4Cl contributes to a large intermolecular potential of 207.7 kJ mol−1. Therefore, it is expected that CH-4Cl based thin films may render an improved charge transport property when taking the only two packing modes and the efficient “dual E/C” mode into consideration.

The different peripheral halogenations on CH-series NFAs have led to diverse intermolecular packing modes and completely changed molecular packing networks, which should have an influence on the charge transport properties of the resulting thin films inevitably. Therefore, the hole transfer integral (VH) and electron transfer integral (VE) were calculated to evaluate the overall charge transport capacities.58,68 As illustrated in Table 2, compared with Y6, especially in the effective “E/E + C/C” mode, CH-6F possesses a more effective VE of 95.38 meV, which is almost comparable with that of some most well-known n-type semiconductors such as perylene diimide.70 After replacing peripheral fluorines with chlorides in CH-6Cl, both very small VH and VE can be observed for the two unique packing modes of “dual C/b” and “E/C”, rendering probably the “E/E-2” mode with a VH of 19.85 meV and a VE of 54.82 meV as the most effective charge transfer channel in CH-6Cl. But for CH-4Cl, the newly emerged “dual E/C” mode shows a large VH of 52.88 meV and a VE of 34.34 meV, which could result in both efficient and balanced hole and electron transport.70 Note that the values of VH and VE are really hard to compare directly between different packing modes; the ratio of hole/electron transfer integral in the most effective packing modes could be applied to assess the charge transport capabilities of A–D–A acceptors.69 Although all the four NFAs have demonstrated both large VH and VE in their preferable packing modes, CH-4Cl affords the most balanced electron/hole transfer integral ratio (VE/VH)2 of 0.42 compared to that of 1.59 for Y6, 5.70 for CH-6F and 8.59 for CH-6Cl, suggesting its better charge transport behaviors. As a result, due to the large and balanced transfer integral along with the smallest reorganization energy for CH-4Cl, the neat film of CH-4Cl contributes to the highest and most balanced experimental electron and hole mobility of 3.79 × 10−4 and 2.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with respect to those of other three NFAs (Table 2 and Fig. S18, ESI†). These results indicate that the packing mode of NFAs, including stacking distances, intermolecular potentials, and charge transfer integrals, plays a significant role in the charge transfer/transport dynamic of acceptor films, and further demonstrates the effectiveness of peripheral halogenation in controlling molecular packings and even the charge transfer/transport dynamics of NFAs.
Photovoltaic properties
The diverse intermolecular packing networks for CH-series NFAs should result in different photovoltaic parameters. Therefore, OSCs with a conventional device structure (Fig. 4a) were fabricated to evaluate the potential photovoltaic performance of CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl. For the sake of complementary absorption and matched energy levels, polymer donor PM6 has been selected to blend with NFAs studied here (Fig. S13b, ESI†). All the device optimization and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S6–S19 (ESI†). Among them, the J–V curves and device parameters of champion OSCs are presented in Fig. 4b and Table 3, respectively. Meanwhile, excellent device reproducibility can be noticed as shown in Fig. 4d. The CH-6F-based device presents a superior PCE of 16.77% to 16.27% of the controlled Y6-based device (Table 2 and Fig. S16, ESI†), along with a JSC of 25.31 mA cm−2 and a high VOC of 0.872 V. Notably, the CH-4Cl-based device yields an impressive PCE of up to 17.72% with an enhanced JSC of 26.50 mA cm−2 comparing to that of CH-6F, which could be attributed to the red-shifted absorption of CH-4Cl. Note that a comparable VOC of 0.872 V can be achieved by CH-4Cl-based OSCs despite the smaller bandgap of CH-4Cl, indicating the possible reduced non-radiative energy loss based on the energy-gap-law.71 A slightly lower PCE of 17.22% is afforded by CH-6Cl-based OSCs mainly due to their inferior VOC and JSC compared to those of the CH-4Cl-based one. Generally, all the three OSCs based on CH-series NFAs exhibit higher PCEs than Y6-based OSCs mainly benefitting from their enlarged VOC and FF. Among them, the increased VOC matches well with the gradually increased LUMO energy levels and higher FF should be ascribed to the better molecular stackings of CH-series NFAs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured and are presented in Fig. 4c. PM6:CH-4Cl and PM6:CH-6Cl-based OSCs show a broader and higher photocurrent response than that based on PM6:CH-6F, which should be attributed to their red-shifted absorption and improved photodynamics discussed below. The calculated current densities obtained from the corresponding EQE curves are 24.97, 25.76 and 25.57 mA cm−2 for PM6:CH-6F, PM6:CH-4Cl and PM6:CH-6Cl-based OSCs, respectively, which represent less than 3% mismatch with the JSC values from the J–V curves. We also select D18 donor72 with a lower-lying HOMO to match CH-series NFAs, and a higher Voc of approaching 0.900 V could be afforded as we expected (Fig. S17, Tables S2 and S17–S19, ESI†). However, the inferior JSC and FF lead to slightly lower PCEs compared to those of PM6-based OSCs.

To further understand the charge generation and dissociation behavior in OSCs, the plots of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) were measured under short-circuit conditions and are shown in Fig. 4e, Fig. S21 and S22 (ESI†). The corresponding exciton dissociation efficiencies (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be afforded (see the explanation in Fig. S20 for details, ESI†). The derived ηdiss values for PM6:CH-6F, PM6:CH-4Cl, PM6:CH-6Cl and PM6:Y6 are 97.8%, 98.0%, 97.9% and 96.8%, respectively. The ηcoll values of PM6:CH-6F, PM6:CH-4Cl, PM6:CH-6Cl and PM6:Y6-based devices can be determined to be 87.4%, 88.4%, 87.6% and 86.5%, respectively. Note that all the devices here show excellent ηdiss and ηcoll, whereas the slightly higher ηdiss and ηcoll values for PM6:CH-series suggest that CH-series NFA based devices exhibit more effective exciton dissociation and charge collection than those based on Y6. Then charge recombination behaviors of OSCs were evaluated by exploring the relationships between JSC/VOC and light intensity (Plight). Under different Plight values, the corresponding JSC follows the equation JSC∝(Plight)α. The value of α is close to the unit, indicating weak bimolecular recombination. As illustrated in Fig. S19 (ESI†), the recombination parameters (α) are 0.985, 0.988, 0.987 and 0.982 for CH-6F, CH-4Cl, CH-6Cl and Y6-based devices, respectively, suggesting quite a low degree of bimolecular recombination for all the devices. In addition, the relationships between VOC and ln(Plight) could suggest the possibility of trap-assisted recombination. As demonstrated in Fig. 4f and Fig. S20 (ESI†), the slopes for CH-6F-, CH-4Cl- and CH-6Cl-based OSCs are 1.17 kT/q, 1.12 kT/q, and 1.15 kT/q, respectively, which are slightly lower than that of Y6-based device (1.21 kT/q). The smaller slopes for CH-series NFA based devices indicate that the trap-assisted recombination has been suppressed, thus contributing to their higher FFs. All the related parameters have been summarized in Table S3 (ESI†) for a clear comparison.
The charge transport properties in the optimal devices were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method using the hole-only and electron-only devices, respectively (Fig. 4g and Fig. S18, ESI†). The calculated electron/hole mobilities for PM6:CH-6F, PM6:CH-4Cl, PM6:CH-6Cl and PM6:Y6 are 4.69 × 10−4/2.43 × 10−4, 5.24 × 10−4/2.89 × 10−4, 5.10 × 10−4/2.78 × 10−4 and 4.02 × 10−4/2.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the corresponding μe/μh ratios of 1.94, 1.81, 1.83 and 2.00. CH-series NFA based devices exhibit higher and more balanced charge mobilities than those based on Y6, which is consistent with the calculated mobilities derived from their single crystals. Moreover, Fig. 4h, i and Fig. S21, S22 (ESI†) show the transient photovoltage and photocurrent (TPV and TPC) decay kinetics of these devices. The PM6:CH-series NFA based devices showed the charge sweep-out times of 0.38 μs for CH-6F, 0.31 μs for CH-4Cl, and 0.35 μs for CH-6Cl, slightly shorter than that of 0.45 μs for Y6. Moreover, the carrier lifetimes calculated from the TPV measurements were 45.8, 68.9, and 58.9 μs for CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl based devices, respectively, which are larger than 42.8 μs of the Y6-based one. The relatively shorter charge extraction time under short-circuit conditions and a higher lifetime of carriers at open-circuit voltage are correlated to the observed higher electron mobility and the weaker recombination in the CH-series based devices. All these results contribute to the improved JSC and FF for the CH-series-based devices, leading to high performances of the studied OSCs. Note that among all the three CH-series NFAs, the CH-4Cl based device displays the smallest charge extraction time and largest carrier lifetime, which is consistent with its best device performances.
For Y-series, it has been widely observed that ternary devices have further improved OSC performances due to enhanced Jsc, Voc and FF, better morphology and improved light harvesting.73–80 Therefore, based on these studies, we further investigate ternary devices of the CH-series and select F-2F53 (Fig. S13a, ESI†) as the third component to fabricate ternary devices using the same conditions as those of the corresponding binary devices. The photovoltaic performance parameters and J–V curves of the best devices are collated in Fig. 4j and k, respectively. After optimizing the ratio of the acceptors (Tables S9 and S14, ESI†), the PM6:CH-4Cl:F-2F (1:0.9:0.3) based ternary device exhibits the best PCE of 18.22%, resulting from the simultaneously enhanced VOC of 0.896 V, JSC of 26.69 mA cm−2, and FF of 76.17%. Note that the performances of the other two ternary blend devices of CH-6F and CH-6Cl could be also improved (Table 3, Tables S13 and S15, ESI†), demonstrating that F-2F could help CH-series NFAs further improve the JSC and VOC with keeping high FF to achieve higher PCEs than the corresponding binary devices. Furthermore, the best CH-4Cl-based ternary devices were taken as an example to disclose enhanced light harvesting, improved exciton dissociation efficiency, charge transfer and charge collection efficiency, and optimized film morphology (see the figures and discussions in Fig. S23–S29, ESI†) after introducing F-2F as the third component. In addition, their effects on the CT states and non-radiative recombination losses will also be discussed below.
Morphology analysis
To investigate the influence of peripheral halogenations on phase separation, we resorted to atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in the AFM images (Fig. 5a–f), all the blends exhibit a uniform and relatively smooth surface morphology, and the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values for PM6:CH-6F, PM6:CH-4Cl, and PM6:CH-6Cl are 0.87, 0.93 and 1.01 nm, respectively. In addition, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl-based blends present obvious fiber-like surface morphologies compared to that of CH-6F, which can be attributed to the stronger crystallization induced by chlorinated terminals. From the TEM image (Fig. S25, ESI†), CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl-based devices show slightly larger and more suitable phase separation, along with more obvious interpenetrated structures than that of CH-6F. The enhanced crystallization and superior interpenetrated networks for CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl-based blends are in good consistency with their improved electron mobility compared to that of the CH-6F-based one. In addition, after introducing F-2F as the third component, the PM6:CH-4Cl:F-2F-based film shows improved fiber-like surface morphologies (Fig. S23, ESI†) and an enlarged domain size (Fig. S25, ESI†), which partially account for its enhanced charge transport dynamics. These results suggest that the delicate tuning of peripheral halogenation in NFAs can achieve a suitable donor/acceptor distribution and phase separation scale in the blend films, leading to more efficient charge transport and enhanced JSC. The contact angles of neat films were also measured (Fig. S29, Note S3, ESI†) and the corresponding miscibility parameters between donor and acceptor are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). The reckoned Flory–Huggins interaction parameters χ81,82 between PM6 donor and CH-6F, CH-4Cl, CH-6Cl, and Y6 acceptors are 0.31, 0.19, 0.34 and 0.40, respectively, suggesting that PM6 and CH-4Cl show the suitable miscibility.

To further comprehend the impact of different molecular packing modes on the microstructures of neat and blend films based on these NFAs, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed. As shown in Fig. S24 and Table S4 (ESI†), the neat CH-6F, CH-4Cl, CH-6Cl and Y6 films exhibit a distinct π–π stacking (010) peak at ca. 1.76, 1.79, 1.77 and 1.72 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction with dπ (π–π stacking distances) of ca. 3.56, 3.51, 3.54 and 3.65 Å, respectively, suggesting predominant face-on molecular packing patterns for all the NFAs. The smaller dπ of CH-series NFAs compared to that of Y6 agrees well with the single crystal analysis (Table 2). More importantly, as displayed in Fig. S27 (ESI†), there are strong peaks at 0.37, 0.49 and 1.81 Å−1 in the X-ray diffraction pattern generated from the single crystal structure of CH-4Cl, corresponding to the packing distances of 17.12, 12.33 and 3.44 Å, respectively. This matches well with the GIWAXS data in the CH-4Cl film, indicating that the packing modes of NFAs in single crystals can be largely preserved in the spin-coated films. Moreover, similar peaks can be also observed in both single crystals and spin-coated films for CH-6F and CH-6Cl (Fig. S26 and S28, ESI†).
The 2D GIWAXS images of the three blend films and the corresponding 1D line-cuts are presented in Fig. 5g–j and Table 4. All the blend films present face-on orientation indicated by the (100) diffraction peaks at ca. 0.30 Å−1 in the IP direction and (010) diffraction peaks at ca. 1.74 Å−1 in the OOP direction. In detail, the blend CH-6F, CH-4Cl, CH-6Cl and Y6 films exhibit a distinct π–π stacking (010) peak at ca. 1.74, 1.75, 1.74 and 1.71 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction with dπ (π–π stacking distances) of ca. 3.62, 3.58, 3.59 and 3.65 Å, respectively. CH-series based blend films exhibit smaller dπ compared with that of Y6, and CH-4Cl owns the smallest dπ, which agrees well with the single crystal analysis (Table 2). The corresponding crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of (010) π–π stacking peaks and (100) lamellar diffraction peaks are estimated to be 18.21 and 83.16 Å for PM6:CH-6F, 19.30 and 89.76 Å for PM6:CH-4Cl, 19.98 and 91.21 Å for PM6:CH-6Cl and 19.10 and 73.44 Å for PM6:Y6. The greatly enlarged CCLs for PM6:CH-4Cl and PM6:CH-6Cl compared to those of PM6:CH-6F and PM6:Y6 should be caused by the increased crystallinity after peripheral chlorination, which agrees well with the data from AFM and TEM images. Moreover, the larger CCLs for PM6:CH-4Cl and PM6:CH-6Cl blends indicate the more ordered molecular packings and should result in lower energy disorder, which will be discussed in detail below. After adding F-2F as the third component, the PM6:CH-4Cl:F-2F blend demonstrates enhanced molecular packings in the interpenetrating networks with both smaller dπ of 3.56 Å and dl of 21.16 Å relative to those of CH-4Cl based films, shown in Table S4 (ESI†). To sum up, precisely chosen peripheral halogenation can effectively adjust the crystallization of NFAs, control face-on orientation and then control molecular stacking of the corresponding blend films, leading to higher JSC and FF values in the corresponding OSCs.

Energy loss analysis of OSCs
Minimizing energy loss (Eloss) to maximize VOC and further improve the PCEs has been regarded as one of the most crucial issues in OSCs.32,83 The Eloss of OSCs is closely related to the molecular packing of light harvesting components; therefore, the energy loss analysis has been conducted to disclose the effects of different peripheral halogenations. The total Eloss of OSCs can be determined by the following equation: Eloss = Eg−eVOC, where Eg is estimated by the cross-point of normalized absorption and emission spectra of neat film,84,85 being 1.381, 1.429, 1.409, and 1.400 eV for Y6, CH-6F, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl, respectively (Fig. S30, ESI†), and the tendency of gradually narrowing bandgaps for CH-series NFAs agree well with those of Eoptg, shown in Table 1. As a result, the total Eloss values of Y6-, CH-6F-, CH-4Cl- and CH-6Cl-based OSCs can be estimated to be 0.529, 0.557, 0.537 and 0.533 eV, respectively. In detail, the Eloss values of OSCs should originate from three parts: ΔECT, qΔVr and qΔVnr.83 Among them, ΔECT is the energetic difference between the local exciton (LE) state and charge transfer (CT) state. qΔVr represents the energy loss induced by inevitable radiative recombination and is hard to be depressed.86qΔVnr is the energy loss caused by the most-concerned non-radiative recombination and the suppression of qΔVnr through molecular systematic engineering has been regarded as the most approached but challenging issue to further improve the VOC and even PCEs of OSCs.87
Note that the absorption of CT states contributes to the low energy part of EQE spectra, thus the ECT of OSCs can be estimated by fitting the highly sensitive EQEs (sEQE) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra (Fig. 6a–c, Fig. S32, S33 and S34, ESI†).83 Consequently, the ECT values of OSCs based on PM6:Y6, PM6:CH-6F, PM6:CH-4Cl and PM6:CH-6Cl are determined to be 1.328, 1.363, 1.369 and 1.367 eV, leading to the ΔECT values of 0.066, 0.040, 0.033 and 0.053 eV, respectively (Table 5). With such a high CT state close to its LE state, the potential hybridization of LE and CT states caused by electronic couplings (tLE–CT) should be taken into consideration based on the recently developed three-state model (Fig. 6d).88,89 There are no clear sub-bandgap CT-state features from both sEQE and EL measurements of these OSCs,58 also implying the occurrence of hybridization of the LE and CT states in these blends with their small ΔECT. The reduced ΔECT of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl blends compared with those of CH-6F and Y6 (Table 5) could render more sufficient hybridization of the CT state with the LE state and the weakened electron-vibration coupling between the lowest energy CT state and the highest vibrational ground (G) state,71,90 thus enlarging the radiative rate of the CT state via an intensity borrowing mechanism or the energetically possible back transition from the CT state to the LE state.89 These characteristics can depress the non-radiative recombination and contribute to stronger emission of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl blends. This is consistent with their smaller ΔVnr of 0.224 V and 0.231 V with respect to that of 0.243 and 0.232 V for Y6 and CH-6F, respectively, which can be indicated by the higher EQEEL in Fig. 6e and Fig. S35 (ESI†). Given that the limit of ΔVnr in organic solar cells could be defined by the PLQY of pristine material components when ΔECT is small,88,89 the smaller ΔVnr values of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl are also consistent with their higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.77% and 5.61% compared to that of 5.49% for CH-6F and 4.80% for Y6 in the pristine material as shown in Fig. 6f and Fig. S36 (ESI†). The reduced ΔVnr of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl-based OSCs should account for their comparable VOC with that of CH-6F, which should be caused by their optimized interpenetrating network and strong packing modes based on our single crystal analysis above.

Moreover, we also analyzed the Urbach energies (Eu) in the active layers, which is determined by the width of the tail of the electronic density of states (DOS) for photoactive layers91 and reflects the degree of overall energy disorder.92 By fitting the sEQE onset (Fig. S32 and S37, ESI†), CH-4Cl-and CH-6Cl-based OSCs show the comparable Eu values of 21.98 and 22.11 meV, respectively, smaller than 23.30 meV for CH-6F- and 24.70 meV for Y6-based devices (Table 5). In general, smaller Eu values for CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl are indicative of a lower static disorder and hence account for their reduced charge recombination.93 Note that the smaller Eu for CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl could be attributed to their more ordered molecular packings caused by the simplified but superior packing modes. In addition, compared to the corresponding binary devices, the PM6:CH-4Cl:F-2F ternary device exhibits a higher ECT value of 1.371 eV, a reduced ΔECT of 0.038 eV, a similar Eu value of 22.08 meV, and thus a smaller ΔVnr of ∼0.203 V (Table 5 and Fig. S30–S37, ESI†). Moreover, the total Eloss of the PM6:CH-4Cl:F-2F-based device is 0.513 eV, ranking CH-4Cl based OSCs among the smallest Eloss systems.
To summarize, based on all the above molecular structure and morphology analyses of single crystals, GIWAXS, AFM, TEM etc. for CH-series NFAs and the photodynamic and performance of resulting OSCs, some important conclusions related to the important role of peripheral halogenation could be noted: (I) at the molecular level, peripheral halogenation could not only tune the energy levels delicately but also affect the molecular rigidity and planarity which could contribute to a reduced reorganization energy; (II) in the solid states, such a little modification of peripheral halogens in NFAs leads to diverse intermolecular packing modes and completely changed molecular networks, which have a dramatical influence on the micromorphology of the blend films, charge transfer/transport dymanics and also energetic disorder; (III) when coming to the device level, the different peripheral halogenations on NFAs could affect the feature of the CT states, tune the degree of the hybridization between the CT and LE states, and thus suppress the non-radiative recombination process and improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs; and (IV) all the results above have proven that peripheral halogenation engineering is an effective strategy to further boost the PCEs of high-performance OSCs through delicate molecular stacking control.
Conclusions
To conclude, a series of A–D–A type CH-series NFAs have been designed and synthesized, featuring multiple peripheral halogenations in both conjugated extended central units and end groups, to unveil the effects of different peripheral halogenations on the optoelectronic properties, molecular stackings, and even PCEs of OSCs systematically. Crystallographic analysis indicates that peripheral halogenation with different halogens leads to dramatically different single crystal structures and packing modes. Among them, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl demonstrate several unobserved packing modes of “dual E/C”, “dual C/b” and “E/C” in the state-of-the-art Y-series NFAs. Compared with CH-6F and Y6, CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl possess greatly reduced electron reorganization energies and shorter intermolecular packing distances, and exhibit more balanced charge mobilities, better phase separation, and lower energy disorder when blended with PM6 donor. In addition, the reduced energy offset between the CT and LE states of CH-4Cl and CH-6Cl may result in the enhanced hybridization of the CT and LE states and thus suppress the non-radiative recombination losses. Finally, high-efficient OSCs have been afforded for all these three compound devices, especially with a champion PCE of 18.22% and a markedly reduced ΔVnr of 0.203 V by utilizing CH-4Cl NFA for its ternary device. These results reveal that the molecular packing modes, charge transfer/transport properties, and even PCEs of OSCs could be optimized by a simple modification of peripheral halogens in NFAs with exactly the same backbone structure and will stimulate the further exploration of peripheral halogenation engineering with the aim of boosting PCEs especially in high-performance OSCs.
