    , Accepted 16th January 2020First published on 19th January 2020AbstractThermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dyes are third-generation light emitting materials. With impressive photophysical properties, TADF dyes are now widely recognized as successful emitters in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, their use in photovoltaic applications has not been realized. In this study, we for the first time present a TADF dye based luminescent solar concentrator device for efficient sunlight harvesting. We synthesized two carbazole dicyanobenzene (CDCB) derivative dyes and employed them in a bulk LSC device. Due to the charge transfer characteristics and twisted structures, TADF dyes help to achieve reduced reabsorption losses in the LSC. The photovoltaic measurements showed that the optical conversion efficiency (ηopt) and power conversion efficiency (ηPCE) of the champion device are 10.4% and 2.2%, respectively. Additionally, the superior resistance against photodegradation of TADF dyes facilitates their long-term use in LSCs. The results demonstrate that TADF dye-based LSCs provide a promising route for high-efficiency and low-cost solar energy generation.
1. Introduction
Development of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) is one of the fastest growing segments of the photovoltaic (PV) industry. Among the various BIPV elements, the luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) device offers a remarkable opportunity to harvest solar energy in a cost-effective way while ensuring its compatibility and integration with urban infrastructures.1–5 An LSC is a sunlight collector, typically consisting of an optically transparent glass or polymer plate embedded with light emissive fluorophores. The light collection is attributed to three main processes: absorption, re-emission, and trapping. The fluorophores inside the plate absorb the incident light and re-emit it at longer wavelengths. Due to total internal reflection (TIR), a substantial portion of the re-emitted light is trapped within the plate and is waveguided to the edges of the LSC, where it is converted into electricity by the attached PV cell (Fig. 1).6–8 Colorful aesthetics, structural flexibility, and the ability to harvest direct and diffused light are the key advantages of the LSC that enable it to be recognized as a BIPV element in the form of building windows and facades.9–11
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic representation of the LSC device. Incident light is absorbed by the embedded fluorophore and is re-emitted. The re-emitted light is then moved via total internal reflections toward the edges of the LSC, where it is harvested by the attached PV cell. (b) Photograph of the 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me based LSC device under the Air Mass (AM) 1.5 global spectrum, indicating that the light is collected at its edges. 
Despite the significant market potential, widespread utilization of the LSC is still hindered due to several reasons such as limited photostability12–18 and other light-loss processes within the device. These light-loss processes include non-radiative photon relaxation,19,20 reabsorption losses,21–23 photostability and restricted trapping efficiencies for glass or polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) waveguides.24–27 Among these processes, the most crucial is the reabsorption loss that occurs due to the larger overlap between the absorption and emission spectra of the fluorophore. Strong reabsorption restricts the mean path length of trapped photons and drives losses through nonradiative decay and outcoupling.28–30 The reabsorption losses are mostly associated with first-generation LSCs employing commercial laser dyes such as coumarins,31–33 rhodamines,34,35 and perylenes.20,36 Besides reabsorption, such dyes also display the concentration quenching effect, i.e. the formation of non-emissive aggregates at higher concentrations. Reduced concentrations of these dyes can be utilized to mitigate these issues but at the cost of decreased light absorption. Second generation LSCs are based on inorganic phosphors37 and semiconducting quantum dots (QDs).38–42 In these cases, reabsorption loss can be reduced by controlling the size and composition of phosphors and QDs; however, they normally exhibit decreased photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) compared to first-generation fluorophores; thus, the overall performance of LSCs is suppressed. In the past few years, thanks to the advancement in molecular design, some LSCs using donor–acceptor (D–A) systems have been introduced to reduce the reabsorption losses without a significant concentration quenching effect. Some are based on a multiple-fluorophore D–A system exhibiting Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).43–45 Others include a single fluorophore D–A system in which intermolecular energy transfer takes place from the donor moiety to the charge acceptor moiety.46,47
Purely organic D–A fluorophores exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are a novel class of highly effective light emitters. TADF is a fluorescence mechanism that relies on a specialized molecular design of an emissive material in which the first excited singlet state (S1) can be thermally repopulated by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from the first excited triplet state (T1). RISC is only possible when the energy difference between the T1 and the S1 (ΔEST) is smaller than 0.3 eV.48 In general, simple organic fluorophores have a larger ΔEST, and thus exhibit only prompt fluorescence and non-phosphorescence. The so-called “TADF dyes” are now widely recognized as successful emitters in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs);49–53 however, they are yet to be employed in PV applications such as LSC devices.
In this study, we for the first time present a TADF dye based LSC device. As a proof of principle, we synthesized 1,2,3,5-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-4,6-dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) and 1,4-dicyano-2,3,5,6-tetrakis(3,6-dimethylcarbazol-9-yl)benzene (4CzTPN-Me), carbazole dicyanobenzene (CDCB) based TADF molecules, with carbazole (Cz) as a donor and dicyanobenzene as an electron acceptor. Density functional theory calculations reveal that in CDCB based TADF dyes, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are localized on the donor moiety Cz and acceptor moiety dicyanobenzene, respectively, leading to a small ΔEST.54 The existence of charge transfer (CT) between the Cz and dicyanobenzene moieties causes an increment in the Stokes shift which is the most important prerequisite to develop high-efficiency LSCs. A given molecular design allows independent fine-tuning of both orbitals through the alteration of the donor and acceptor moieties, by which the photophysical properties of the LSC device can be adjusted according to the desired aesthetics. Besides synthesis of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me, we report the spectroscopic properties, photostability, and photovoltaic performance of the TADF dye based bulk LSC with a properly designed setup.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
To synthesize TADF dyes, all reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI), or Wako Pure Chemical Industries, and used without further purification, while materials (methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2,2′-azobis 2-methylpropionitrile (AIBN)) for LSC preparation were purchased from Sigma Aldrich only.
2.2. Synthesis of TADF dyes

2.2.1 Synthesis of 1,2,3,5-tetrakis(carbazole-9-yl)-4,6-dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN). 
60% sodium hydride (0.94 g, 39 mmol) was washed with hexane and dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 0 °C. 9H-carbazole was added and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. Again at 0 °C, 2,4,5,6-tetrafluoroisophthalonitrile (0.52 g, 2.6 mmol) was added. After 30 min, the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The organic layer was washed with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/acetone = 1:2, v/v) to afford 4CzIPN as a yellow powder (yield = 1.54 g, 75%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 8.23 (d, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H), 7.73–7.67 (m, 8H), 7.49 (td, J = 7.9, 1.3 Hz, 2H), 7.34 (d, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 7.23 (dd, J = 7.2, 1.2 Hz, 4H), 7.11–7.05 (m, 8H), 6.82 (t, J = 7.8 Hz, 4H), 6.63 (td, J = 7.9, 1.1 Hz, 2H).


2.2.2 Synthesis of 1,4-dicyano-2,3,5,6-tetrakis(3,6-dimethylcarbazol-9-yl)benzene (4CzTPN-Me). 
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazole (0.78 g, 4.0 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (30 mL) in a two-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C; then, 60% sodium hydride (0.16 g, 4.0 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred for half an hour. After that, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (0.20 g, 1.0 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 150 °C for 16 h. The reaction was quenched with water and the precipitate was filtered off. The crude product was purified by recrystallization with dichloromethane and methanol and dried in a vacuum oven to obtain an orange powder (yield = 0.49 g, 54.4%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ = 7.81 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 8H), 7.71 (s, 8H), 7.11 (m, 8H), 2.37 (s, 24H).

2.3. Fabrication of the LSC device
The LSC was fabricated according to our previously reported method.4 First, 0.1 w/w% 2,2′-azobis 2-methylpropionitrile (AIBN; Aldrich, USA) and 0.010–0.040% of the as-prepared 4CZIPN were blended with methyl methacrylate (Aldrich, USA), followed by sonication for 15 min. A free-radical polymerization reaction was initiated by heating the prepared solution at 85 °C. After 30–45 min, the solution turned into a syrupy liquid, indicating the formation of the prepolymer. After the viscosity exceeded that of glycerol, this thick syrup was cooled to room temperature and poured into a glass mold. The resulting product was dried in the mold at 45 °C for almost 24 h. Finally, the 4CzIPN-doped PMMA LSC was laser-cut into square pieces with dimensions of 7.5 × 7.5 × 0.3 cm3, and further polished to obtain the 0.3 cm thick LSC. The same procedure was applied to prepare the 4CzTPN-Me based LSC device.
2.4. Measurements
NMR spectra of the synthesized TADF dyes were recorded on an Avance III 500 spectrometer (Bruker), using tetramethylsilane (δ = 0.00) as an internal standard. Absorption and emission spectra were measured using a UV-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 35) and fluorescence spectrophotometer (JASCO, FP-8600), respectively. The edge emission output was measured using a spectrometer (Avantes, ULS2048) connected to an integrating sphere through a 1 m long optical fiber cable. LSCs were positioned on the sample holder such that one edge of the LSC was exactly in front of the entry port of the integrating sphere while the other three edges of the LSC were left open (Fig. 5(c)). For photovoltaics measurements of the prepared LSCs, high-efficiency (20%) crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells purchased from Puguang Solar China were employed. Optically transparent refractive index matching epoxy adhesive (United Adhesives, OE 1582) was used to bind 7.5 × 0.3 cm2 solar cells with the edges of the LSC having the same dimensions. The edge emission spectrum and current–voltage measurements of our prepared devices were taken by illuminating the LSC surface with a solar simulator (Mc-Science) having a xenon arc lamp of 160 W as a light source equipped with filters to approximate the Air Mass (AM) 1.5 global spectrum. The light intensity was calibrated with a KIER-calibrated Si-solar cell before performing the efficiency test and found to be 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
Keeping in mind that the main justification for the LSC approach to harvest sunlight is the cost reduction compared to traditional PV systems, we synthesized 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me from commercially available reagents in a one-step reaction. The reaction routes for the synthesis of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me are shown in Fig. 2. Synthesis of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me is the result of the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of carbazole anions that are generated by treatment with NaH and dicyanobenzenes. The four carbazole moieties having a strong charge transfer character serve as electron donors, while natural transition orbitals are centered on the dicyanobenzene moiety, thus making it an electron acceptor.

Normalized absorption and emission spectra of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me embedded in a 0.3 cm thick PMMA plate are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. It is worth mentioning that, since this study presents the incorporation of TADF dyes in PMMA based LSC devices, all optical measurements of TADF dyes were obtained in the solid state rather than in solution form. As shown in Fig. 3, the absorption spectra of both TADF dyes cover the entire UV spectrum and a part of the short wavelength visible spectrum. In detail, an absorption spectrum of 4CzIPN is characterized by two semi-condensed peaks, spanning from 300 nm to 500 nm. In the case of 4CzTPN-Me, the overall absorption range is 300–550 nm, represented by two well-separated peaks. The emission spectra of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me are characterized by a single broad peak with the maximum values at 509 nm and 557, respectively. The Stokes shift is defined by the difference between absorption and emission maxima (λems − λabs). According to the given spectra, the Stokes shift exhibited by 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me is 139 nm and 217 nm, respectively. The larger Stokes shift shown by 4CzTPN-Me, as compared to 4CzIPN, is due to substitution of the methyl group at carbazole in 4CzTPN-Me.54 The Stokes shifts exhibited by 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me are significantly larger than those of first-generation organic fluorophores. Such prominent photophysical improvement in both TADF dyes is attributed to the CT characteristics and their twisted structures resulting from the steric hindrance.

Control over the dye concentrations is essential for achieving higher efficiency in LSCs. Therefore, we obtained the absorption spectra of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me embedded in LSCs at various concentrations (Fig. 4). As evident from the plots, absorption increased upon increasing the concentration of both TADF dyes. Another important feature of the given plots is a slight red shift in the absorption spectra. This implies the electronic reconfiguration of excited states with increasing concentrations of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me.55 Moreover, the integrated absorption values indicate that the overall absorption of 4CzIPN dominates the 4CzTPN-Me absorption, and the difference is even more pronounced at 0.03 w/w% (Fig. 4(c)).

A deeper understanding of the effect of concentration of TADF dyes on the LSC performance can be attained by acquiring edge emission spectra. As described in the Experimental section, an integrating sphere method has been applied to obtain edge emission spectra of the LSC devices embedded with varying concentrations of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me and the results are plotted in Fig. 5. Upon increasing the concentrations, both TADF dyes exhibited a progressive shift in the wavelength towards higher values. Nevertheless, 4CzIPN features a weaker red-shift compared to 4CzTPN-Me. Besides this, Fig. 5(a) shows that the intensity of edge emission power increased up to 0.03 w/w% 4CzIPN. Further increment in 4CzIPN caused a reduction in the edge emission power intensity. Our results show a similar trend to those of Kim et al., where a decline in fluorescence intensity was observed at higher concentration of 4CzIPN doped CBP films.55 In the case of 4CzTPN-Me based LSCs, the rationale for not going beyond 0.03 w/w% is the reduced solubility of 4CzTPN-Me in PMMA (ESI, Fig. S2†). In the efforts to make an LSC based on 0.04 w/w% 4CzTPN-Me, we observed a strong scattering effect and hazy LSC device. The predominant reason for the spectral shift towards the red region is the formation of dimer or aggregated states upon increasing the concentration of multi-carbazole TADF dyes.56 Moreover, the molecules are more sterically constrained in the solid state than in the solution phase. This can lead to a strong local electric field and restricts the reorientation molecules around the emitter. Such local dipolar interactions also contribute to shifting the emission wavelength towards the red region.57

Furthermore, we report the peak emission wavelengths (λpeak emission) as a function of illumination distance (L) from the light collecting edge of the LSC device. To compare our TADF dye-based LSCs with conventional dye based LSCs, we fabricated an LSC doped with coumarin 6, which is one of the most common green emission dyes employed in LSCs.25,58 Coumarin 6 exhibits a smaller Stokes shift (∼40 nm) as indicated by the overlapped absorption and emission spectra (ESI, Fig. S3†). λpeak emission as a function of L was obtained by moving the light source along the length of an LSC while the emission is collected at the end (Fig. 6). Generally, when the distance between the light source and collection edge increases, the emitted photons travel a longer distance and have a higher probability of being reabsorbed, leading to reabsorption losses, and are then re-emitted at longer wavelengths. The ultimate effect is a net red-shift of the emission spectrum.59 In the case of the LSCs doped with 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me, the observed gradient in λpeak emission is less than that of the coumarin 6 based LSC (Fig. 6). For the coumarin 6 based LSC, at excitation distances of 2.5 cm and 12.5 cm, λpeak emission was 520 nm and 532 nm, respectively. We represent a gradient in λpeak emission by the quantity ά = (λL=12.5 − λL=2.5)/ΔL, which is 1.2 for coumarin 6. At an excitation distance of 2.5 cm, λpeak emission exhibited by 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me based LSCs was 509 nm and 576 nm, respectively, while at an excitation distance of 12.5 cm, λpeak emission was 517 nm for the 4CzIPN based LSC and 576 nm for the 4CzTPN-Me based LSC. Thus, based on the given values, ά becomes 0.8 and 0.9 for 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me based LSCs, respectively. The apparent increase in the peak wavelength can be attributed to the local dipolar interactions within the molecules as already described in the above section. Moreover, a slight spectral overlap near the absorption tail may be responsible for the spectrum shifting.

Most LSC research featuring new materials is limited to the fabrication of small LSC devices.60,61 Nevertheless, the efficiency of the LSC strongly depends on its size. Reabsorption losses are the most important factor that limits the up-scaling of a large area LSC. In this study we also highlight the potential of our TADF dye based LSC for large area applications. To support our perspective, we measured the integrated edge emission power (Pint emission) from the LSC edge as a function of exposed area. As shown in the inset of Fig. 7, one edge of the LSC (3 × 0.3 cm2) was kept constant, while a black mask was progressively moved along the length of the LSC (L) to increase the illumination area. Regression analysis was done using SigmaPlot® software to acquire the linear fit of the experimental data. Pint emission of LSCs increases linearly with the increasing area of LSCs as shown in Fig. 7. For a smaller area, i.e. 7.5 cm2, Pint emission of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me based LSCs was nearly the same i.e. 33.4 μW and 30.7 μW, respectively. The plot further suggests that, in the case of TADF dyes, the difference between the Pint emission increased with increasing illumination area; for example, when the area was extended up to 37.5 cm2, Pint emission received by the 4CzIPN based LSC was nearly 49% more than that of the 4CzTPN-Me based LSC. For the purpose of comparison, area dependent Pint emission data were also obtained for the coumarin 6 based LSC. The increased absorption range of coumarin 6 provides a justification of enhanced Pint emission for all the given illumination areas. However, it is noteworthy that the difference between Pint emission of coumarin 6 and 4CzIPN based LSCs was quite prominent for 7.5 cm2, while a decrease in this difference was observed for larger illumination areas. Due to facility limitations, we were unable to increase the area beyond 37.5 cm2, which corresponds to L = 12.5 cm. Herein, slopes of the linear fits (m) of experimentally measured Pint emission data were obtained for further understanding. Nevertheless, a linear fit of a given dataset does not provide a complete estimation of power efficiency of a large area LSC, which indeed requires a comprehensive ray tracing approach. The steepness and the higher value of m could provide a general idea for large area applicability of LSC devices. According to Fig. 7, m for coumarin 6, 4CzIPN, and 4CzTPN-Me based LSCs is 2.6, 3.4, and 2.1, respectively. The difference is mainly owing to the relatively higher self-absorption shown by coumarin 6 and 4CzTPN-Me, in which emitted photons are reabsorbed and then subsequently lost due to non-radiative decay or secondary re-emission out of the waveguide. Thus, among the given systems, the 4CzIPN based LSC has potential for large area application.

To further confirm the potential of the TADF dyes to serve as effective emissive materials in LSCs, their photostabilities were compared with that of coumarin 6. The photostability of these materials is known to influence their energy harvesting capabilities, probably due to photodegradation of molecules leading to products that affect the emission intensities.62,63 Strong 360 nm excitation light with a power of 100 mW cm−2 was irradiated on the coumarin 6, 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me based LSC samples for 5 hours. The photodegraded samples were analyzed by obtaining their PL spectra at various intervals (Fig. S4, ESI†) and a change in emission intensity/initial emission intensity (I/I0) was calculated. In the case of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me, the gradient of the I/I0 curve became more gradual than that of the I/I0 curve for coumarin 6 as can be seen in Fig. 8. In particular, the reduction in the emission intensity of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me based LSCs was 7.2% and 10% after irradiation for 5 hours, respectively. On the other hand, a 24% decrease in the emission of the coumarin 6 based LSC was observed within the same irradiation time. These results indicate that 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me display much higher stability than coumarin 6.

To check the validity of the newly developed LSCs, the PV response was recorded under standard illumination conditions (as described in the Experimental section). Three samples against each concentration were prepared and J–V curves were obtained for each sample. Then the data were averaged to acquire the final PV parameters, such as the short-circuit current (ISC), short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF). Common figures of merits used to describe the performance of LSC-systems are the optical conversion efficiency (ηopt) and power conversion efficiency (ηPCE).28,64ηopt is the optical collection probability and is defined as the ratio of the LSC edge emission power to the absorbed incident power. ηPCE is the ratio of the electrical power output to the incident power. The following equations define ηopt and ηPCE. (1) (2)where ISC and JSC are the short-circuit current and short-circuit density, respectively, measured from the LSC attached solar cell, Isolar cell is the short circuit current measured from the same solar cell under direct illumination of the same light source, and ALSC and Aedges are the LSC's top surface area and the area of its lateral faces where the solar cells are attached.
At first, PV parameters were obtained for the solar cell under direct illumination and the obtained values of ISC, JSC, VOC, and FF were 102 mA ± 1, 45 mA cm−2 ± 1, 612 mV ± 2, and 69 ± 1, respectively. Schematics of the LSC-PV in 1-cell and 4-cell configurations, as well as the J–V curves of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me based LSCs in the 1-cell configuration and 4-cell configuration are presented in the ESI (Fig. S5–S7†). Support for the PV analysis results for our LSC devices emerges from the edge emission measurements that indicate that the photocurrent increases till the optimum concentration of TADF dyes. The obtained PV parameters of our devices at various concentrations of 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me are presented in Fig. 9 while the corresponding values of these parameters and the figure-of-merits (ηopt, ηPCE) are listed in Table 1. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the trend of ISC, VOC, FF and Pmax is not linear as the 4CzIPN concentration increased. Among the 4CzIPN based LSCs in the 1-cell configuration, LSC-3A with 0.03 w/w% 4CzIPN showed the highest performance. For LSC-3A, the recorded values of ISC, VOC, FF and Pmax are 104.8 ± 3 mA, 617 ± 3 mV, 69 ± 3 and 44.6 ± 0.07 mW, respectively, while ηopt and ηPCE are 4.0% ± 0.07 and 1.0% ± 0.01, respectively, which are remarkably higher than those of LSC-1A and 2A. On the other hand, among the 4CzTPN-Me based LSCs in the 1-cell configuration, LSC-3B with ηopt of 2.8% ± 0.02 and ηPCE of 0.7% ± 0.01 outperformed LSC-1B and LSC-2B. Furthermore, the results of the champion LSCs, i.e. LSC-3A and LSC-3B in the 4 cell configuration were collected (Table 2). As anticipated, a significant improvement was recorded for both devices. Notably, ηopt of the 4-cell configuration LSC-3A and LSC-3B was 10.4% ± 0.06 and 7.3% ± 0.05, respectively, which is approximately 2.5 times more than that of the same LSC in the 1-cell configuration. Similarly, ηPCE also doubled in the 4-cell configuration with the corresponding values of 2.2 ± 0.08 and 1.6 ± 0.05 for LSC-3A and LSC-3B, respectively. The results obtained with our devices are improved compared to those obtained with other yellow/green dye based LSC systems; for example, our LSC based on TADF dyes exhibits 1.6 times higher ηopt than the recently reported conjugated heterocyclic fluorophore based LSC.65 Benefiting from the design flexibility in TADF molecules, we consider that a further improvement in LSC efficiencies is possible.

4. Conclusion
For the first time, we presented TADF dye based LSC devices. The TADF dyes are characterized by pre-twisted intramolecular charge transfer and have comparatively small relaxation energy because of the steric hindrance between D and A moieties. We synthesized 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN-Me, which exhibit large Stokes shifts. Photostability analysis showed that 4CzIPN and 4CzTPN based LSCs displayed better resistance against photodegradation. According to the photovoltaic analysis, optical efficiencies ranging from 2.2% to 4%, and power efficiencies of 0.6–1% have been achieved for the 4CzIPN based LSC in a one cell configuration, while the 4CzTPN-Me based LSC in a 1-cell configuration showed optical efficiencies of 2–2.8%, and power efficiencies of 0.5–0.7%. The champion device was the LSC with 0.03 w/w% 4CzIPN, which displayed optical and power efficiencies of 10.4% and 2.2%, respectively, in a 4 cell configuration under sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2). Also, TADF dye based LSC devices may be suitable for large size applications owing to near-zero reabsorption losses.
