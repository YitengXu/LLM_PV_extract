    , Accepted 11th April 2014First published on 16th June 2014AbstractFlexible Dye Solar Cells (FDSCs), in their most widespread architecture, are assembled with two opposing planar films or foil substrates in metal–plastic or plastic–plastic combinations. The use of one metal electrode enables the convenient utilization of materials and high temperature processes but is accompanied by issues including partial opacity of the electrolyte and catalyst layer. Constraints on the stability of plastic substrates have led to the development of a variety of alternative material formulations and processes to guarantee performance even at low temperatures compatible with plastic films. Recently, efforts in doing without transparent conducting oxides have led to the development of new unconventional architectures. Review of the operation of DSCs shows that initial target markets are represented by indoor applications where power output densities have been shown to outperform competing flexible photovoltaic technologies. Whereas performance, stability in particular, needs to be significantly improved for the adoption in long term outdoor installations, commercial products integrating FDCSs for indoor or portable use have already been launched. Issues pertaining progress in materials, processes, devices and industrialization of FDSCs will be analyzed and discussed in this review.T. M. BrownThomas M.

1. Introduction
Dye Solar Cells (DSCs)1–3 represent an attractive photovoltaic technology, initially developed on glass substrates, which has seen growing efforts and success in its application to flexible substrates. Glass provides an extremely effective barrier towards water and oxygen penetration into the device and enables the utilization of high-temperature processes (when coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide, FTO, rather than indium tin oxide, ITO) for the fabrication of efficient DSCs and is well suited for building integrated photovoltaics (PV). Nevertheless, the drawbacks of this type of substrates consist mainly in their rigidity, weight, and frangibility which limit the potential integration of DSC devices in portable electronics and their conformability to any surface, even curved ones.
Based upon these considerations, alternative, low-cost, lightweight, and flexible substrates, such as plastic films and thin metal foils, have been investigated for the fabrication of DSC electrodes. The development of flexible dye solar cells (FDSCs)4–8 not only addresses the need for applications where portability, conformability, reduced dimensions and weight are important, but is also conducive to industrial roll-to-roll (R2R) fabrication which enables the implementation of high throughput production lines and its associated potential reduction in manufacturing costs.
Here we will review recent progress in flexible DSCs. After a short run through the basic device structure and operation (Section 1), the first section on the materials utilized and developed for FDSCs will focus on the foundations on which the devices are developed: i.e. the substrates (Section 2). These, represent a tremendous opportunity for both manufacturing and applications, but also set important constraints on materials and especially processes which can be applied to manufacturing. Since at least one of the two substrates comprising the FDSC has to be made out of transparent plastics, processing temperatures have to be typically kept lower than 120–150 °C. Whereas those utilized for glass DSCs are typically higher than 400 °C (for the conventional sintering of the TiO2 layer and the conversion of catalyst precursors), researchers have innovated and developed alternative materials, deposition and post-processing techniques with which the devices on flexible substrates are assembled, which, at the state of the art, deliver not only uncompromising output power densities but also carry commercial appeal especially for the application in specific environments. As we will see, plastic substrates also impact FDSC technology because of their high gas permeation rates which can limit their lifetime. In fact, encapsulation strategies and lifetime are discussed in Section 9 after sections dedicated to photoelectrodes (PE, Section 4), counterelectrodes (CE, Section 5), dyes (Section 6), electrolytes (Section 7), and large area modules and their fabrication (Section 8). The operation, applications, costs and markets for FDSCs will be discussed in Section 10, new architectures and concepts in Section 11 before finishing with the conclusions and outlook of this review.
2. Basic structure and operation

Fig. 1 shows the basic operation of a DSC2,3,9–11 in its simplest form, i.e. that of two conducting substrates which sandwich the active materials. The photons are absorbed by dye molecules, which are anchored to (and cover) a mesoporous, high-surface-area layer (to maximize dye uptake and thus light absorption) of a nanocrystalline high band gap semiconductor (typically TiO2) with a consequent excitation of electrons from the low energy state to a high energy state of the dye. The exciton is split at the TiO2/dye interface due to the energy difference and proximity in the wavefunction density between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the dye and the conduction band of the TiO2 in which the electrons are injected. Here the electrons diffusing through the TiO2 film are collected at the transparent conducting oxide, TCO, and driven through the external circuit. The oxidized dye molecules are regenerated back to their neutral state by the electrons provided by the iodide (I−) species in the electrolyte which are converted to triiodide (I3−). The build-up of I3− at the photoelectrode creates a concentration gradient so that the ions diffuse to the counterelectrode where their reduction back to I− is catalyzed by a catalyst layer.10
 Fig. 1  Schematics of the basic operation of a dye solar cell (DSC) consisting in its simplest form of two conducting substrates. On the left is the electron collecting electrode (photoelectrode, PE) covered by a mesoporous TiO2 layer, sensitized by a monolayer of dye molecules. Light excites the molecule (S*). The electron is injected into the conduction band (C.B.) of the TiO2 where it diffuses into the transparent contact. After flowing through the load, the electron is shuttled towards the dye (which reverts back to its ground state S0) via ions in the electrolyte. The catalyst layer of the counterelectrode (Pt in this embodiment) enables the effective reduction of the ionic species of the Red–Ox couple and thus a quick passage of charges between the electrode and the electrolyte. 
The main reactions giving rise to the photovoltaic effect can be summarized as:
Electron-collecting photoelectrode (PE)S0 + hv → S* (light absorption by the dye)S* → S+ + e− (TiO2) (electron injection from the dye into the TiO2)e− (TiO2) → e− (PE) (electron transport in the TiO2 layer)2S+ + 3I− → 2S0 + I3− (dye regeneration via I− ions)
Counterelectrode (CE)I3− (CE) + 2e− (CE) → 3I− (CE) (charge transfer reaction catalyzed by the CE material, Pt in Fig. 1)
Electrolyte3I− (CE) → 3I− (PE) iodide diffusion from the CE to the PEI3− (PE) → I3− (CE) tri-iodide diffusion from the PE to the CE
The above reactions compete with recombination of photoexcited electronic charges, mainly those in the TiO2 and the conducting electrode with either holes in the oxidized dye or more significantly with the red-ox species in the electrolyte. At low light intensities the electrode–electrolyte recombination path becomes the dominant route for the back transfer of electrons to tri-iodide, reducing the photovoltage of the DSC. It can be limited by thin compact layers over the photoelectrode arising (naturally or induced) on titanium foils or by inserting specific thin films between the electrode and the mesoporous TiO2 layer.12 In depth reviews of the operation and dynamics of DSCs can be found in ref. 2, 3, 9–11, 13 and 14.

Fig. 1 represents the flat sandwich-type architecture most commonly utilized for cells where both substrates are transparent: i.e. glass/glass for rigid devices or plastic–plastic for flexible devices. FDSCs of this type come in three different configurations according to whether metal or plastic are used as electrodes (see Fig. 2). Metals can withstand high temperatures so that material formulations and processes developed for glass DSC technology can be readily applied. Typically it is the photoelectrode which is metallic (Fig. 2a) since it permits high temperature sintering of the mesoporous TiO2 layer which has a strong bearing on device efficiency because temperatures of 450–500 °C guarantee an optimal degree of electromechanical bonding between the nanoparticles (and these to the conducting substrate) and thus sufficiently long electron lifetimes for effective charge collection.15,16 The counterelectrode17–19 then has to be transparent and is made of TCO/plastic coated with a catalytic layer deposited with compatible techniques. Although this metal PE configuration has the advantage of maximizing photoelectrode performance, light has to pass through the CE and tens of microns of electrolyte solution where a significant fraction of photons are absorbed before reaching the active dye molecules. Because of this, CE- (or back-) illuminated cells yield photocurrents which can be as much as 30–40% lower compared to the same transparent cells illuminated through the PE20,21 unless more transparent electrolytes are formulated. Thus, the other main configuration for FDSCs utilizes all plastic electrodes (Fig. 2b) so that light can be shone directly through the PE. The challenge in this latter case is to develop TiO2 films at low temperatures (<150 °C) which are as effective in collecting charge as their counterparts processed at high temperatures.

In (b) light is shone through the (top) photoelectrode. Another type of device consists of a metal substrate as the counterelectrode and a conductive plastic film as the photo-electrode (not shown). 
3. Substrates
Flexible second generation thin-film solar cells, due to their relatively high processing temperatures, have been realized preferably either on high glass transition temperature polyimide plastic films or on stainless steel substrates. Power conversion efficiencies of 12.5–16.3% have been reported in triple junction amorphous silicon devices on polyimide,22 13.6% in CdTe on metal,23 and 20.4% in CIGS on polyimide.24 Instead, for flexible dye solar cells, the more transparent and lower cost polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) polymers have represented the most common substrate choice. They act as widely used transparent conductive substrate electrodes when coated with ITO.25 The sheet resistance of ITO/polymer substrates reaches 10–15 Ω □−1, close to the typical value of the FTO-coated glass (7–15 Ω □−1) maintaining high transparency in the visible spectrum, with costs which are similar or in the same range.7 Notwithstanding its good transparency/conductivity properties, ITO on plastic has a number of issues. Firstly, ITO is a brittle material, sensitive to tensile and compressive stress (e.g. during bending) leading to conductivity degradation. In addition damage greatly depends on the thickness of the ITO layer and the substrate itself. In particular for high conductivity ITO (15 Ω □−1), a previous study shows that curving devices with radii above 14 mm no degradation effects occur but crack formation and propagation does appear for lower radii.26 Secondly, despite ITO-coated substrates provide good resistance towards the solvents typically used in DSC fabrication,26 its stability in the electrolyte solution is not always guaranteed and can vary greatly according to the additives used in the electrolyte composition27,28 (see Section 7). Different materials such as graphene,29 carbon nanotubes,30 and conductive polymers,31 have been investigated to replace ITO due to the drawbacks accompanying this coating.32 The main limit of these conductive PET and PEN substrates consists in their maximum practical processing temperatures of around 150 °C.26 In fact these ITO–polymer substrates start to deform with temperatures above that range, and even melt at 235 °C.26 More thermally resistant films such as clays and polyimides have been investigated as substrates to overcome the 150 °C barrier. However since their transparency is low, CE-rear-side illumination is required which leads to device efficiencies which are lower compared to those assembled with PET and PEN.33,34 Finally plastic films are very sensitive to water and oxygen permeation with a water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) of 1–10 g per m2 per day, which is ∼6 orders of magnitude higher than the common target range of 10−6 g per m2 per day which can be comfortably sustained by glass.35,36 The stability of FDSCs can be compromised by permeation of oxygen and water molecules from the outside and their interaction with dye and charge mediators. Thus, the deposition of multilayer films (inorganic/organic or pure inorganic), acting as low permeation barriers, on the films' surfaces has been the most reliable approach to reduce WVTRs to 10−5 to 10−6 g per m2 per day.36 Different methods such as sputtering,37 plasma enhanced or initiated chemical vapor deposition,38,39 atomic layer deposition,35,40 and strategies such as multilayers41,42 have been successfully implemented for lowering permeation rates and tested in other optoelectronic technologies such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaics (OPV) but systematic investigations need to be carried out in FDSCs.
Thin metal foils4,7 can be valid alternatives to conducting plastic films, since they withstand the high temperatures required by conventional manufacturing processes. Furthermore they provide excellent conductivity compared to TCOs and a better barrier to moisture or oxygen ingress. However, when fabricating large-area series-connected modules, metal foils (unless used only as carriers) need to be cut into individual cells in order to guarantee electrical isolation whereas for plastic substrates scribing of the TCO is sufficient. Since metals are opaque, the other substrate used for completing a DSC must be transparent to allow light to penetrate into the device where it is absorbed by the dye molecules. The key requirement for a metal electrode foil in a liquid-based DSC is the chemical inertness towards the corrosive electrolyte. Different metals have been investigated such as aluminum, copper, iron, nickel, zinc, stainless steel (StSt), titanium (Ti), and alloys such as Inconel.4,43–47 Simple soaking tests revealed that only some types of StSt, Ti and Inconel are stable and thus suitable for the fabrication of DSCs. However the stability of the last three metals seems to be different depending on whether they work as PEs or CEs. Miettunen et al. have studied StSt, Ti and Inconel in both the configurations, highlighting large differences in corrosion behavior,44,48 which is well known to be a function of the voltage applied to the electrode.49
Among these metals, high purity (>99%) titanium foils are the most stable and resistant to corrosion due to a natural passivating oxide forming on its surface. The drawback of this material is the higher cost (12–40 $ per m2) compared to StSt sheets (4 $ per m2).7 Other cheaper metals such as stainless steel (StSt), nickel or aluminium may be made to work as well if properly protected from the electrolyte, e.g. by TiN/polyimide composite coatings on the photoelectrode50 or by sufficiently thick catalyst overcoats on the counterelectrode.51
Recently metal meshes, also developed for OLEDs and OPV,52 composed of very thin metal wires (StSt or Ti) have been successfully integrated in new types of TCO-free FDSC architectures which are particularly appropriate for applications where strong flexing is desirable, yielding also high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs of over 6%).53 Metal meshes54 can be less expensive than foils (Ti meshes 15–20 $ per m2, StSt meshes 0.1–0.25 $ per m2),7 and are also transparent thus overcoming the drawback of having to illuminate through the CEs. The most suitable aperture/distance between two wires has been shown to be different whether metal meshes were developed for PEs or CEs. For PEs it was around 15–20 microns, similar to the diffusion length for electrons in the TiO2 layer so as to ensure efficient charge collection.55,56 For CEs the aperture size could be increased up to millimeters according to Xiao et al.57 Section 11 covers alternative substrate architectures in more depth.
4. Photoelectrodes
The most utilized material for the fabrication of the electron-collecting photoelectrode is a mesoporous nano-crystalline TiO2 (nc-TiO2) deposited on one or more layers over the conducting substrate with thicknesses ranging from a few microns up to around 15 microns depending on the dye and charge mediator combinations. It possesses the right properties in terms of energy levels and electron mobility, especially in its anatase state.58 TiO2 is a large band gap n-type semiconductor with an energy gap of 3.2 eV (absorbing only in the UV). Absorption of the visible solar spectrum is through a dye anchored to the TiO2 which, due to the high surface area of the mesoscopic film (around three orders of magnitude larger than a flat surface59), guarantees photoexcitation of a large number of molecules and high photocurrents. The conduction band lies a few hundred meV under the LUMO of the dyes, allowing for efficient charge injection.2 The TiO2 requires a sintering step after deposition to obtain the right porosity/surface-area (for dye loading) and sufficient electromechanical bonding between nanoparticles to achieve sufficiently long electron lifetimes, effective transport and collection at the electrode. Lowering the concentration of defect and trap states is accompanied by lower recombination rates and thus higher diffusion lengths.60 Attention should be given to the deposition and processing technique, which will influence the morphology of the PE. Moreover, to obtain a truly flexible DSC, the TiO2 layer should resist to the stresses generated by bending the device.
The fabrication of TiO2 photoelectrodes can be divided into four steps: synthesis, and dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles into coatable or printable pastes, deposition on the conducting substrate and post-processing of the layer. Additionally, pre-treatment of the nanoparticles and/or the substrate has been implemented in a number of studies. TiO2 synthesis can be avoided by purchasing commercial TiO2 particles or ready-made printable dispersions/pastes. For glass-based DSCs, the common procedure to prepare the photoelectrode consists of dispersing the nanoparticles together with a (cellulose) binder to formulate a paste, screen printing and firing the paste at 450–500 °C to remove the binder and sinter the nanoparticles together to form a mesoporous structure before dye sensitization.61 Alternative approaches for fabricating the TiO2 layer, such as sol–gel synthesis with templating agents, are also present in the literature.62–65 Nevertheless, for devices with substrates that can withstand them, application of high temperatures represents the most common treatment to guarantee the required sintering quality. Instead, especially for plastic substrates, alternative material formulations and processes have been developed for the PEs.
4.1. Photoelectrodes on plastic substrates
When the photoelectrode is prepared on ITO-coated plastic substrates (Table 1), the set of possible processes available are constrained by the lower chemical stability of ITO with respect to FTO66,67 and especially by the maximum processing temperatures that can be utilized (∼150 °C) which also limit the effectiveness of the PEs if the typical TiO2 paste formulations are utilized.68 To reach levels of uncompromising performance, scientists have thus developed a range of material formulations and processes which are different from the standard ones used for glass-based devices.

4.1.1. TiO2 and wide band gap photoelectrode materials. 
Nanocrystalline films of TiO2 are the most popular and currently the best-performing photoelectrode structures. The most-used approach consists of preparing a binder-free paste (made of nanoparticles, solvents such as alcohols and/or water and additives with low boiling points but no binders which are useful for their film-forming properties but do not decompose off at the low temperatures compatible with plastics), coating it on the ITO substrate and heating it up to 150 °C to remove solvents and additives and promote slight sintering.69 Further or alternative post-processing techniques have been developed as will be detailed below. Nanoparticles can be synthesized in the laboratory or commercially sourced. For the latter kind, Degussa P25 powder is widely utilized. These particles are cubic with rounded edges with a mean diameter of ∼20 nm and a BET area of 55 m2 g−1.70 The production of P25 is performed using the AEROSIL© process allowing production in very high-volumes.71 The maximum published PCE obtained with this powder in a plastic-based FDSC (sensitized by a single dye) is 6.3%,72 whereas PCEs above 8% were obtained using hydrothermally custom-synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles.73,74 The most efficient plastic DSCs amongst these were realized by mixing together different particles with diameters of 20 and 100 nm in order to obtain high surface areas and efficient transport through the mesoporous structure. In fact addition of even very small (d < 5 nm) TiO2 particles promotes necking between these.75–77 The same strategy of mixing different diameters has also been implemented utilizing commercial particles yielding devices with a PCE of 6.5%.78 The concept of adding materials to promote necking between particles at low or even room temperatures, sometimes referred to as nanoglues, has been an effective route for PE fabrication76,79 aiding not only the efficiency of FDSCs with low-T PEs (a PCE of 5.43% was achieved in films containing the TiO2 interparticle binding agent synthesized by a sol–gel process)79 but also mechanical flexibility.
A recently developed alternative approach (see Fig. 3, left) consisted of preparing much larger submicron- to micron-sized “building blocks” (such as prefabricated mesoporous TiO2 beads), by using solvothermal synthesis or by sintering nanoparticles into clusters (even at high temperatures before their deposition).80–83 In this way it was possible to obtain strongly interconnected TiO2 networks while maintaining the advantage of solution-processing of the TiO2 layer, delivering devices with PCEs of 7.5%.83 The blocks can be physically and chemically treated prior to integration on the photoelectrode. Pre-sintered P25 mesobeads have been treated with TiCl4 (which is known to increase photocurrents in FTO/glass devices but damages ITO)84 and then deposited with a cold vacuum spraying technique, without having to apply further processing steps such as heating, compression or UV.85 Not only TiO2 nanoparticles but also high aspect ratio pre-sintered TiO2 nanowires have been successfully employed by transfer on plastic and a FDSC with a PCE of 5.5% was obtained.86

A SiO2 mesoporous layer (white circles) was incorporated over the TiO2 layer (purple circles) so as to decrease the volume occupied by the electrolyte increasing its transparency and thus improving light harvesting at the PE.145 Figures reproduced with permission from (left) ref. 83, © 2013, AIP Publishing LLC, and (right) ref. 145 © 2013 RSC. 
Recently, composites were used to improve the transport and/or flexing characteristics of the TiO2 layer. TiO2-coated double-walled carbon nanotubes were added to TiO2 pastes to improve the electrical properties of the films obtained at low temperatures, improving the PCE of the FDSCs from 3.0% to 3.9%.87 TiO2/polymer composites have been shown to improve cell bendability.88 Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was successfully introduced in the mesoporous layer by simultaneously depositing TiO2 by electrospraying and PVDF nanofibers by electrospinning (see Fig. 4 (ref. 89)). Subsequent compression at 80 MPa yielded devices with a PCE of 4.8%. The stresses of the fragile TiO2 layer are transferred to the other component of the composite (the polymer fibres in that work) dramatically increasing bendability thus preventing delamination of the layer upon curving. Also (Sb,In)-doped SnO2 (SITO) was used in FDSC photoanodes to enhance interconnection between P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (see Fig. 5), not only raising the PCE from 4.5% to 6.8% but also its mechanical stability to bending.90 HCl can also improve particle interconnection when added to a binder-free paste increasing device PCE from 4.0% to 5.0%.66

Other materials have been used as alternatives to TiO2 to fabricate flexible photoanodes including ZnO. The best ZnO-based FDSC (via electrophoretic deposition) showed a PCE of 4.0%.91 MgO-coated SnO2 showed very high photocurrents (18 mA cm−2) with a PCE of 6.5%.92


4.1.2. Deposition of the TiO2 layers. 
In contrast to the TiO2 pastes used for high temperature sintering on glass or metal foils which are commonly screen printed, most of the ones described above relating to low-T TiO2 on plastic substrates were deposited by the doctor blade technique because the absence of binders and additives in the TiO2 paste makes screen printing difficult. As shown in Tables 1 and 2 doctor blade deposition is currently also the technique used to obtain the highest PCEs both for plastic and metallic substrates.73,74 Although optimization studies on the rheological properties of low-T TiO2 pastes have been carried out (by adding an increasing quantity of ammonia or hydrochloric acid in water for example), the appropriateness of the doctor blade technique93–96 for large area (e.g. roll-to-roll) fabrication needs to be validated. Other techniques such as spin coating, gravure printing and ink jet printing have been used97–99 although PCEs under 5% are reported. Even if different sources mention low-temperature paste compositions for screen printing (the coating technique widely used for high temperature pastes), which would be suitable for large area fabrication (as much as gravure printing for example), hardly any photovoltaic data have been reported.75,100,101 The only clear result reports a PCE of 0.25%.102 Cold vacuum spraying of pre-sintered P25 mesobeads was used to deposit a TiO2 with no additional post deposition treatment. The resulting FDSC had a PCE of 4.2%.82

Alternative techniques to printing include electrophoretic deposition (EPD). In EPD the flexible substrate is immersed in an electrically charged TiO2 dispersion facing a conductive electrode. A voltage is applied between the substrate and the electrode to deposit the mesoporous nc-TiO2 layer or even multilayers of which the thicknesses can be easily fine-tuned. The best performing solar cell fabricated with EPD had a PCE of 6.6%.103 A different route used to fabricate strongly interconnected mesoporous TiO2 layers consisted of transferring on ITO/plastic films pre-sintered (at high-T) mesoporous TiO2 previously made on glass or ceramic substrates.104–107 Adhesion of the transferred film on the plastic substrate was improved by depositing a thin TiO2 adhesion layer prior to the transfer process. By using a double layer P25 photoanode with two different dyes a 6.6% PCE was obtained.105


4.1.3. Post-processing of the photoelectrode. 
Since room- or low-temperature (120–150 °C) treatments do not typically guarantee sufficient necking between nanoparticles required to reach those maximum efficiencies achievable at high T,68 apart from the introduction of necking agents (or nanoglues) in the paste formulations as outlined previously, other strategies consist of subjecting the deposited photoelectrodes to further processing such as compression, UV irradiation and chemical baths (compatible with plastic substrates) in order to improve device performance.
Static compression at 50–200 MPa was applied on the TiO2 photoelectrode to obtain the first significantly efficient plastic FDSC with a PCE of 4.6%.108 High pressure was applied during TiO2 sintering to improve grain interconnection.109 Continuous compression applied with a calender press (10 m min−1), which may be particularly suited for R-2-R manufacturing, yielded almost the same performance as static compression, with PCEs equal to 4.7% and 5.1% respectively.98 Although not yet applied to flexible DSCs it has been shown that utilization of both compression and temperature simultaneously (with a heated press) is beneficial.68 The most efficient plastic DSC (PCE of 8.1%) was obtained applying 100 MPa of static compression on a mesoporous layer of hydrothermally synthesized nanoparticles.74 UV-O3 cleaning of the TiO2 surface was used before dye immersion in order to improve its uptake. The effect of the applied pressure is shown in Fig. 6. Using the same technique Fu et al. obtained a PCE of 7.0% using a photo-platinized CE.110
 Fig. 6  Photovoltaic parameters of a fully plastic DSC as a function of the pressure applied on the TiO2 film with an hydraulic press for one minute at room temperature.74 Figure reproduced with permission from ref. 74 © 2010 Elsevier. 
Compression is usually applied with a hydraulic press. However, a 200 MPa compression carried out with a cold isostatic press (CIP)96,111 on a P25 TiO2 film delivered a PCE of 6.3%.96 The P25 electrode became transparent after CIP compression, a transformation that has not been reported with hydraulic and calender presses. Compression is also used in the transfer technique to bond the high temperature sintered TiO2 layer to the flexible substrate.104–107
Not only microwave irradiation has been utilized for sintering the TiO2,112,113 but also UV irradiation has been applied to TiO2 films thanks to the latter's strong photocatalytical activity and capabilities to oxidize and remove organic compounds.114 These characteristics were used to improve necking in the presence of a TiO2 precursor, to remove organic additives present in the TiO2 pastes and to clean TiO2 surfaces before dyeing.74,115,116 A UV treatment (200 mW cm−1) for a few tens of minutes, depending on the layer thickness, completely removed the hydroxyl-ethylcellulose stabilizing binder in the TiO2 film, led to a doubling of the PCE and better performance compared to equivalent FDSCs assembled with binder-free pastes.116 UV-irradiation is often coupled with other sintering procedures to optimize the final results. It was used together with SITO interconnecting agent to improve solar cell performance. The UV treated photoelectrode was placed in a 100 °C water bath before the dyeing process. The use of the SITO nanoglue (Fig. 5), together with UV and water treatment led to a PCE of 6.8%, the highest value reported for a fully plastic DSC fabricated without compression.90
UV scanning laser systems can represent an alternative to halogen lamps since they are highly automated, precise and selective.117 They have been successfully implemented for sintering TiO2 films leading to the same performance as oven sintering in glass DSCs.118–120 Lasers have also been applied to flexible substrates.121 Application of laser processing over flexible substrates is a challenging step due to the high fluences of the beams. Nevertheless, in situ laser sintering has been shown to boost efficiency in FDSCs by as much as 80%.122,123 Kim et al.124 reported a method to transfer a TiO2 film from glass (where it had been previously sintered) to a plastic substrate via laser detachment. The film was subsequently subjected to high pressures to improve adhesion and a PCE of 5.7% was obtained for a plastic FDSC.
Photoelectrodes have also been treated in hot water (attempting to simulate a more complicated hydrothermal treatment which can convert amorphous TiO2 in crystalline forms) although the PCE of the resulting device was not high (i.e. 2.5%).125 Sol–gel precursors can be added to the paste composition, but can also be used for a chemical bath at a later stage. A chemical bath in titanium butoxide solution was used to improve bonding of a transferred TiO2 layer.107 Chemical vapour deposition of a sol–gel precursor coupled with UV irradiation has been shown to improve particle interconnection126 as also a chemical sintering post-treatment using titanium n-tetrabutoxide.127


4.1.4. Compact layers. 
To improve adhesion of mesoporous TiO2 on flexible substrates, and to minimize recombination between the electrolyte and the TCO, a thin compact layer of TiO2 can be deposited on the TCO surface.128 The recombination-blocking behaviour can considerably improve performance of the solar cell especially when illuminated at low light levels or when a solid hole transporting material (HTM) is used, i.e. in solid state DSCs.14 In SSDSCs HTMs such as the organic semiconductors P3HT or Spiro-O-MeTAD substitute the electrolyte and a metallic contact is directly deposited (usually by evaporation) over the HTM. In SSDSCs a compact layer separating the TCO from coming into contact with the HTM, thus suppressing strong recombination, is crucial.129,130 The assembly of a TiO2 compact layer on plastic substrates is not straightforward, since TiO2 of low crystallinity is usually obtained at low temperatures. Sputtering is a feasible technique which has allowed the deposition of 10 nm of semicrystalline TiO2, with an associated PCE increase of 29%.131 No data on low levels of illumination or solid state architecture were reported.
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a layer by layer deposition technique used to deposit amorphous films of TiO2 at low temperatures.132 Since amorphous films have low charge mobilities, thicknesses should be large enough to completely cover the TCO but not higher in order to prevent strong ohmic losses. The optimal thickness of such a TiO2 layer in a solid state flexible solar cell with a P3HT HTM was equal to 16 nm, while both 13 nm and 20 nm resulted in poor performance.133 Results on glass were equivalent to devices made with compact layers obtained by spray pyrolysis (which represents a state of the art method to deposit crystalline compact layers at high T). Applied to FDSCs, the ALD layer led to a PCE of 1.9% (2.2% on glass).
The paucity in available low-cost, efficient low-T compact layers represents an issue for indoor applications or solid state architectures for plastic–PE dye solar cells. Recently, new techniques to obtain low temperature compact layers by solution processing have been developed for flexible hybrid organometallic halide perovskite solar cells.134 PCEs up to 10.2% were achieved with compact layers obtained by depositing a nanoparticle dispersion sometimes mixed with a sol–gel precursor or graphene.135–137 These materials and techniques may be well-suited for testing on FDSCs.

4.2. Photoelectrodes on metal substrates
When the flexible DSC photoanode is fabricated on metal foil (Table 2), such as Ti or stainless steel (StS), sintering at high temperatures is allowed. Titanium presents a much better surface in terms of thermal processing, paste adhesion, recombination inhibition, conductivity and barrier properties when compared to plastic TCO-coated substrates.69 It is very stable to corrosion and is in fact the current choice for mass production.138 G24 Power/Konarka reported a PCE of 7.17% at 1 Sun for cell sizes 0.402–1.69 cm2 certified by NREL.139 The Ti surface can be subjected to mechanical polishing and chemical baths in order to optimize charge collection by varying the native oxide morphology and composition.
The best-performing solar cells utilize hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 or commercial pastes. The most efficient FDSC on metal foil fabricated with commercially available particles, such as Degussa P25 (d = 21 nm) and P90 (d = 13 nm), was obtained by the electrophoretic deposition technique followed by 100 MPa compression and annealing at 350 °C.140 The PCE obtained was higher (i.e. 6.5%) with P90 owing to the larger surface area with respect to P25. This procedure delivered high PCE values at lower temperatures compared to the customary 450–500 °C and without pretreatment of the Ti foil.
Indeed a pre-treatment of the substrate is often used to obtain high performance cells.141 First, mechanical polishing was carried out to remove the native oxide and any contaminant arising on the surface during the fabrication of the foil raising the PCE of titanium FDSCs from 2.4% to 5.1%. Furthermore, by dipping the substrate in hydrogen peroxide for 48 hours at room temperature, a rough TiO2 underlayer was obtained, improving charge collection and delivering FDSCs with a PCE of 6.2%.
An alternative way to improve charge collection at the Ti/TiO2 interface, consisted of applying the TiCl4 pre-treatment developed for glass based DSCs.142 This treatment was applied on a clean Ti foil first and later also on the mesoporous TiO2 layer, by immersing the substrate in a TiCl4 solution, followed by annealing at 450 °C. The flexible DSC made with this photoanode delivered a PCE of 7.2%.142
The polishing step can also be realized via a chemical bath, using strong acids such as HF, at times followed by HNO3.110,143,144 The surface pre-treatment with HF, together with a photo-platinized CE led to a PCE of 8.1%.110 A hydrothermal treatment in NaOH solution delivered a PCE of 6.7% on large areas (100 cm2) measured outdoors (incident power of 55 mW cm−2).143
By combining several aforementioned pre-treatments, chemical polishing with HF and HNO3, H2O2 chemical bath and TiCl4 treatment on the oxidized foil, a TiO2 nanoforest underlayer was obtained onto which complete devices (Ti PE and a plastic CE) were subsequently fabricated as shown in Fig. 7. A PCE of 8.5% was obtained, which is considerably higher than the one relative to Ti foil used as received (3.5%) and represents the most efficient flexible DSC on Ti foil under standard illumination conditions.144

(Bottom image) JV curves of FDSCs fabricated on Ti substrates which previously underwent different treatments. The acid + H2O2 + TiCl4 process led to the cells with the highest photocurrents.144 Figure reproduced with permission from ref. 144 © 2012 John Wiley and Sons. 
A different way to enhance the performance of titanium based DSCs consists of depositing submicron SiO2 beads over the TiO2 (see Fig. 3, right). In this way the transparent beads occupy the space previously taken by the opaque electrolyte thereby enhancing the number of photons reaching the active dye-sensitized layer, thus improving the overall transmittance of the electrolyte chamber. With this method a 10% increase in the JSC was observed, resulting in a PCE of 7.2%.145 Titanium is also interesting in that it allows for simple electrochemical growth of aligned TiO2 nanotubes.146
It is interesting to note that we have found only one report of a metal-based solid-state FDSC which uses a semi-transparent gold window as the top electrode and with a PCE of 0.8%.147 Finally, the most efficient flexible dye solar cell reported was fabricated on a modified stainless steel foil.73 A thin bilayer of SiOx and ITO was sputtered on the StS. A hydrothermally synthetized TiO2 paste was printed by the doctor blade and subsequently sintered at 600 °C reaching a maximum PCE of 8.6%.
5. Dyes
Many FDSCs in the literature utilize di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (N719) as the dye sensitizer, including amongst the most efficient FDSCs currently reported.73,74 Other complexes such as Z907 and the black dye have also been used.148,149 Generally, dyes utilized for FDSCs are the same as those developed for glass devices on which there is ample literature.3,150 Recently a heteroleptic ruthenium complex named CYC-B11 was employed to fabricate a highly efficient and stable flexible DSC sub-module thanks to its wide absorption spectrum and hydrophobic side chains.145 In fact, since the rate of ingress of moisture will be higher for devices with plastic electrodes compared to their glass-based counterparts, it is generally even more desirable to have stable hydrophobic dyes to minimize the effect of H2O on the long term stability of these devices.
Dyes with particularly high molar extinction coefficients are also especially desirable for plastic FDSCs since they allow the use of thinner mesoporous TiO2, which would result in both improved electron collection (due to the TiO2's higher transport resistance compared to high-temperature-processed counterparts) and also enhanced resistance to delamination or cracking upon bending.101 Organic dyes and quantum dots (QDs) may also be suitable for this aim.151 CdS/CdSe QDs were used in FDSC delivering a PCE of 3.5%. A double layered TiO2 PE with a ruthenium dye on top and an organic dye near the bottom delivered a PCE of 6.6%.105
6. Counterelectrodes
Flexible CEs should be endowed with both good catalytic activity towards the electrolyte redox couple and good adhesion of the catalyst to the substrate,3 even when processed at low temperatures (as required for CEs developed on plastic substrates26). In addition, high transmittance of light is mandatory for a CE152 when using an opaque metal-based photoelectrode (PE)7 or for those applications where transparency is sought for aesthetical and/or operational reasons (e.g. BIPV).
So far, a large number of materials have been integrated in devices as catalyst for flexible CEs: platinum-based,74,110,153,154 carbon-based,155–158 polymers,159–162 transition metal sulfides,163,164 nitrides,165,166 carbides167 and oxides.168 Depending on the substrate type (metallic or plastic) and catalyst material, a wide variety of processes have been developed, based on both chemical and physical techniques.169 Most of them are low-temperature and easily up-scalable.

Table 3 summarizes some of the main results concerning flexible CEs and related fabrication processes for both plastic and metallic substrates. An effective CE presents both low charge transfer resistance at the catalyst/electrolyte interface, Rct (i.e. strong catalytic activity) and/or transparency, together with high PCE values when assembled in FDSCs. Further interesting techniques and promising alternative catalyst materials, especially for novel ITO-free solutions, are reported in the following sub-sections. For most of those CEs, high efficiencies are shown when coupled with FTO/glass PEs but should be tested in all-flexible DSCs in the future.
Table 3 Examples of published catalyst materials on different flexible substrate and redox mediators, sorted by the fabrication/deposition method. Charge transfer resistance at the catalyst/electrolyte interface, optical transmittance and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are reported in devices where even the PE was on flexible foil or film (in all-flexible DSCs)

6.1. Plastic counterelectrodes

6.1.1. Platinum counterelectrodes. 
Similarly to glass,170 platinum is the most commonly utilized catalyst material due to its impressive catalytic properties. So far, sputtered Pt has often been the preferred choice for plastic CEs. In fact, Yamaguchi et al. demonstrated the most efficient all-plastic DSC using sputtered Pt on ITO/PEN as CE (PCE of 8.1%).74 Tuning the deposition time, a highly transparent (almost 70%) Pt layer with a good charge transfer resistance (10.35 Ω cm2) was obtained,171 making it suitable for CE-illuminated DSCs with metallic PEs (Fig. 8, top). Konarka/G24 Power Ltd., commercial manufacturer, reported a sputtered Pt CE on ITO/PEN and an NREL-certified lab cell efficiency of 7.17%.139 Although one can prepare sputtered Pt rolls to insert into a R-2-R line, many efforts have gone into finding alternatives to sputtering in order to overcome some of its drawbacks (related to the requirement of high vacuums and costs172). Recently, effective transparent and catalytic Pt layers were obtained via atomic layer deposition (ALD) on ITO/PEN, even on large areas.153 Other simple and low temperature processes such as dipping173 and spray coating107 have given promising results: Pt spray-coated on ITO/PEN as the CE coupled with a Ti foil PE yielded a device with a state of the art efficiency of 8.5%.144 By simple chemical reduction of Pt precursors, both reflective174 and very transparent154 Pt CEs have been obtained. A similar reduction process can be also induced by UV exposure. An Rct as low as 0.66 Ω cm2 was obtained by UV processing the Pt precursor on a TiO2 template. This CE (76% transparency) assembled in a Ti/plastic FDSC delivered a PCE of 8.12% which is amongst the highest values reported.110 Utilizing a simple screen printed Pt precursor paste on ITO/PEN and powerful UV irradiation, Zardetto et al. demonstrated the first all UV processed DSC and also the suitability of such method for large area devices without the need for additional TiO2 templates (Fig. 8, bottom).116

Electrochemical deposition (ED) of platinum has received also considerable attention since Kim et al. proved its suitability for plastic substrates175 and Ito et al. reported a PCE 7.2% for a back-illuminated metal-plastic DSC equipped with such a CE.142 Changing deposition parameters,176 and even blending different catalyst precursor materials,152 allows one to tune the optical and catalytic characteristics of the layer with the ED technique delivering low Rct and superior transparency (beyond 75% on ITO/PEN (Fig. 8, middle)) with less material consumption.152 Electrodeposition is a simple, fast and inexpensive process, easily up-scalable for metallic substrates (SoloPower Systems Inc. has implemented it in its CIGS production line177). Additional efforts are required to prove and validate the long term stability of this kind of CE, mainly related to adhesion to the TCO and/or possible poisoning,178 and to include the process in a roll-to-roll production line, solving the problem of non-homogeneous deposition caused by voltage drop especially on the more resistive ITO/plastic substrates. Ref. 179 reports a method to overcome this issue by depositing a conductive grid necessary to maintain uniformity of the voltage of the substrate during the ED process. A large area parallel module (22 cm2) in which the CE was obtained by ED of Pt in a few seconds on a plastic–ITO substrate, covered by conducting grids which subsequently functioned as current collectors in the finished device, delivered a PCE of 3.0% at 1 Sun and 4.3% at 0.2 Sun.179


6.1.2. Alternative counterelectrode materials. 
Apart from Pt, a variety of other catalytic materials have been electrodeposited on conductive plastic substrates,159,161,163,164,180 including cobalt sulfide (CoS),163 PEDOT164 and carbon.181 CoS resulted in a semi-transparent CE with an Rct of 1.8 Ω cm2 and a front-illuminated device PCE of 6.5%, withstanding also a 1000 h ageing test at 60 °C under 1 Sun illumination.163 PEDOT, coupled with a disulfide/thiolate (T2/T−) based electrolyte, showed a higher Rct (15.2 Ω cm2) but still a remarkable PCE of 5.9% and good shelf life after 1000 h storage.164 Semitransparent PEDOT has been also deposited by electropolymerization on ITO/PEN yielding a PCE of 8% when integrated in a front-illuminated device based on I−/I3− electrolyte and N719 dye.159 Ellis et al. succeeded in electrodepositing PEDOT from an aqueous micellar solution, even on 9 × 9 cm2 ITO/PEN substrates.182 Pt nanoparticles can also be used to enhance the performance of otherwise less catalytic but cheaper materials,180 resulting in lower Pt loading and overall cost reduction and have been sprayed on single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)183 and spin coated on polyaniline (PANI)184 on ITO/plastic substrates. By printing a composite paste prepared by adding TiO2 nanoparticles to an aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS and a slurry of ITO over an ITO/PEN substrate, a semi-transparent Pt-free CE was obtained and used in DSCs that delivered a PCE only slightly lower than devices with sputtered Pt CEs.185 Such low T (110–130 °C) printable solutions, including a carbon based gel with excellent flexibility can represent a very low cost option for R2R fabrication of large area CEs in plastic–plastic devices.181
Due to the issues of brittleness and stability of ITO (due to interaction with the components of the electrolyte), TCO-free counterelectrodes are being investigated including abundant carbon based materials (see Fig. 9). The challenge is to guarantee sufficient conductivity and high surface areas which often means combining different materials together. PEDOT becomes more conductive by tuning the PSS concentration and can be easily printed or applied by electro- and solid state polymerization.160,186 Its conductivity and catalytic action can be respectively enhanced by silver nanowires embedded in the substrate and by TiO2 nanoparticles187 or by honeycomb-like silver grids printed on the plastic substrate.188 A cheap graphite substrate covered by a large-effective-surface-area polyaromatic hydrocarbon layer and coupled with a FTO glass-based PE in a device delivered a PCE of 8.63%.189 The more evident drawback of relatively thick carbon based layers like graphite is their very low or null transparency168,190,191 which makes them unsuitable for back-illuminated devices such as those fabricated on opaque metallic PEs. Graphene seems promising and can be deposited on substrates like polyimide (PI) via different routes based on chemical reduction:190,192 the resulting CEs exhibit highly catalytic performance, thanks to the porous structure with numerous edges of the graphene film (Fig. 9, bottom-left), equaling the PCE of sputtered DSC with Pt CEs. Exfoliated graphite served as a substrate for an electropolymerized PEDOT:PSS layer (0.78 Ω cm2) used in a DSC employing polymer electrolytes yielding a PCE of 5.7% (ref. 191) (Fig. 9, top-right). Spin coated PEDOT on conductive graphene/PET substrates showed more than 70% transmittance and passed bending tests (Fig. 9, top-left), confirming its flexibility and strong adhesion to the substrate.193 SWCNTs deposited on PET by a simple press-transfer method155 exhibit impressive Rct (0.72 Ω cm2) for a Co2+/3+ electrolyte. SWCNTs have also been printed on PVC using a low temperature ink delivering a low Rct (2.7 Ω cm2) when coupled with a thin spin-coated PEDOT-TsO layer and a similar PCE compared to thermally platinized CE.156 Conductive carbon on PI can act as a conductive underlayer for sprayed vanadium nitride (VN), tungsten oxide (WO2) and titanium carbide (TiC),168 which can also be printed.167 More recently, a simple low temperature method was demonstrated to obtain a free-standing paper-like polypyrrole (PPy) membrane, based on self-assembling from PPy nanotubes dispersed in a suspension under a vacuum atmosphere.194 Such a flexible ITO- and Pt-free CE exhibits good catalytic performance (5 Ω cm2) thanks to its porous structure and high specific surface area, leading to a PCE of 5.27% when integrated in a cell.

6.2. Metallic counterelectrodes
Constraints on maintaining low temperatures, high-transparency and the concerns on the stability of ITO can be lifted by adopting metallic foils (or meshes/fibers) as CE (although they are then necessarily transferred to the plastic PE). As already mentioned, metals possess lower sheet resistance compared to ITO but are more prone to corrosion in the aggressive I−/I3− electrolyte medium4,45,46 with titanium showing the highest stability.
Pt is the preferred catalyst used even for metal CEs. Deposition techniques range from sputtering,74,195 even on fiber-shaped substrates,196 to electroless197 or electrochemical deposition,198 and physical vapour deposition.51 Sputtered Pt on Ti foil gave a certified record of 7.6% PCE when integrated in a FDSC, as reported by Yamaguchi et al. in their work on the TiO2 PE compression method.74 Electroless deposition of Pt on nickel and StSt substrates gave a Rct of ∼2 Ω cm2 and almost 7% PCE in DSCs assembled with PEs on FTO glass.197 Xiao et al. demonstrated simple and fast electrodeposition of Pt over a Ti mesh in an all-metallic large-area (80 cm2) DSC, with a PCE of 6% under 55 mW cm−2 outdoor natural light irradiation.198 By the same method, they also deposited PEDOT on a similar mesh, obtaining 6.33% PCE over 100 cm2, proving the suitability of conductive polymers as catalysts on large areas.199 In the same vein, an 11 μm-thick polyaniline (PANI) film was electrodeposited on StSt foils, which gave an Rct of 6.8 Ω cm2 and a device PCE of 7% (PE on FTO glass).162 Transition metal nitrides (and carbides) were investigated for use as CEs. Highly ordered titanium nitride (TiN) nanotube arrays, prepared by anodization of a Ti foil and subsequent nitridation in an ammonia atmosphere demonstrated high catalytic activity, leading to a PCE of 7.73% (with an FTO/glass PE);166 sputtered molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) and tungsten nitride (W2N) on Ti foils also showed a very low Rct, achieving almost 6% PCE with a FTO/glass PE.165 TiC, WO2 and VN were deposited on Ti substrates by simple spray coating of their respective precursors, reaching lower Rct and higher PCE than in the case of the same catalysts on plastic substrates (conductive carbon on polyimide).168 Low-cost carbon-based materials also attracted much attention: carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers were spin coated on a Ti foil and post treated with an ethanol flame synthesis method, showing high catalytic activity thanks to a peculiar hierarchical porous structure (Fig. 9, bottom-right) and leading to a PCE of 6.5%;200 vertically oriented graphene was obtained via plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) on the StSt substrate with encouraging results (Rct = 7.3 Ω cm2, >5% PCE);157 a carbon aerogel deposited on the StSt mesh gave 4.8 Ω cm2Rct after compression and a PCE of 9% in a glass-based DSC.201 Combining noncarbonaceous catalysts, e.g. Pt nanoparticles or CoS, with carbon based materials such as MWCNT is another explored route.202,203
7. Electrolytes
Currently the I−/I3− redox mediator204 is the most common electrolyte for FDSCs in either acetonitrile (ACN) or methoxypropionitrile (MPN) solvents.2 The latter has a higher boiling point and viscosity, fundamental to avoid electrolyte leakage/evaporation and to assemble long-lasting devices. The former has a low viscosity which enhances the mobility of the ions and thus photocurrents. Optimal iodine concentration, appropriate additives and solvents are crucial to obtain highly efficient or highly stable DSCs. Different compositions are often used depending whether tests are aimed at obtaining the highest efficiency or rather long term stability (see Table 4). The amount of I2 (which determines [I3−]) defines the final concentration of the redox couple, since the iodide salt is generally about an order of magnitude more concentrated. Although it enhances the conductivity of the electrolyte, too much iodine raises recombination losses and the unwanted absorption of the incoming light (an important issue especially for back-illuminated DSCs). The appropriate concentration depends on solvent viscosity, TiO2 porosity, chamber thickness and also on the catalytic properties of the CE.205,206

Two classes of iodide salts are typically used, alkaline inorganic salts or organic salts based on imidazolium or tetrabutylammonium. ITO/plastic substrates are more unstable compared to FTO/glass regarding both the resistance to corrosion against acidic solutions and the Li+ inorganic cation.67,125 Inorganic cations enhance charge injection in TiO2 by increasing the driving force and thus enhance JSC,207 but can degrade the ITO. Tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) can substitute Li+ since it has been shown to enhance both the PCE and the device's durability compared to a propyl-methyl-imidazolium iodide (PMMI) or the LiI-based electrolyte, thanks to its passivation of the TiO2 surface.67,208 Other Li+-free additives used to improve cell performance by modifying the TiO2 surface are 4-tert-butylpyridine (4TBP), N-methylbenzimidazole (NMB) and guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN). From the contrasting literature available it is not yet clear if the effect of 4TBP is as effective or even detrimental in FDSCs compared to when used in glass DSCs.145,149,209 NMB can easily substitute 4TBP in flexible cells, since it has a similar effect and no observed incompatibility with ITO.210 GuSCN is added to the electrolyte formulation to increase charge injection and JSC and to passivize TiO2 recombination sites enhancing both performance and stability,211 an effect enhanced in combination with NMB.210
Liquid electrolytes have been used to test the stability of FDSC under light soaking or temperature and humidity stresses.67,145,208 However no quantitative extraction of acceleration factors for estimating operational lifetime was carried out (in analogy to glass based devices212,213). For plastic DSCs a TBAI-based formulation with NMB in MPN helped maintain 75% of the maximum PCE after 1000 hours under a light soaking test at 1 Sun and 60 °C.67 A titanium foil FDSC with PMII based electrolyte with 4TBP in MPN maintained a more stable performance, with a less than 20% PCE loss after 1500 hours of the light soaking test (1 Sun, 50 °C).145
In order to improve cell performance and stability a gelling agent,148,191,214 either inorganic or polymeric, can be added to electrolyte formulation and then deposited. At times polymer matrices can be either grown on the PE and then filled with electrolyte or dipped in electrolyte and then transferred onto the PE. Gelification can be considered a route not only to avoid electrolyte egress for enhancing lifetimes, but also towards processing with large area techniques such as screen printing.215–217
Silica nanoparticles are a well-known gelling agent for rigid DSCs.218 A light-scattering gel–electrolyte with commercial SiO2 nanoparticles and submicron mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) was employed to improve JSC.219 The mesoporous morphology of the MSNs helped the diffusion of the ionic species while maintaining the light-scattering properties. Addition of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles to the liquid based electrolyte improved ion mobility and the PCE more than the SiO2 nanoparticles did.78 The effect was even more evident in a solvent-free binary ionic liquid formulation, where the PCE was improved from 1.6% to 2.8% by adding 17.5% of P25. The latter formulation showed good stability, maintaining >97% of the initial efficiency after 500 hours of light soaking as shown in Fig. 10. Due to the higher permeation rates of vapours in and out of FDSCs, developing very low-volatility/high-boiling point electrolytes may be even more important compared to glass-based counterparts. Electrolytes, with boiling points even above 280 °C, have proven to enhance stability of glass DSCs220 and should be tested on flexible DSCs too. Tailored formulation of the electrolyte can be considered when trying to combat corrosion of metal substrates other than Ti. In fact additives/compounds contained in the electrolyte (e.g. 4-tertbutylpyridine,51 nitrogen containing heterocyclics221) can help in inhibiting corrosion to certain metals like StSt.

Besides the iodide redox couple, cobalt complexes have been employed in electrolytes for glass-based DSCs delivering increased Voc and even efficiency.222–224 Cobalt-based electrolytes have been proven to be compatible with plastic counterelectrodes155,182,186 but systematic studies on performance and stability in full FDSCs should be carried out to exploit the potential of these formulations. These electrolytes have high transmittance in the visible range which can enhance the photon flux arriving on the PEs in metal based cells.
8. Flexible large-area dye solar cell modules
The up-scaling from small laboratory test cells (as those described in the previous sections) to those large-areas required in applications (to deliver the necessary electrical power) is not trivial. It requires development of effective module architectures and ultimately of high-throughput, high-yield, low-cost manufacturing lines.
8.1. Module architectures
Since the sheet resistance of the transparent conductors acting as electrodes are relatively high, developing a module225–229 entails integrating a number of cells on a common substrate and interconnecting these together.6 To minimize resistive losses due to the TCO, cells are usually shaped as rectangular stripes whose optimal width depends on the sheet resistance of the ITO, the efficiency of the cells, and illumination conditions but are generally in the few-mm to ∼1 cm range.20,230 Current collecting fingers or vertical connections are usually added to the long side so as to also diminish resistive losses. Connections can be in series for increasing the module voltage (keeping the currents low) or in parallel (current output scales with the module area). Module fabrication requires developing vertical connections (Z-type series architectures), current collection grids (parallel architectures) and their protection, evaluating the effects of sheet resistance of the substrates on performance, designing the most efficient layout depending on illumination conditions, and other issues such as electrolyte filling and cell sealing. The different architectures developed, primarily on glass include parallel modules,231 W-type series interconnections,20,227 Z-type series interconnections,20,230 and monolithic modules.232–234
Compared to glass-based devices, the literature on modules on flexible substrates is limited. Arakawa et al. developed a fully plastic parallel sub-module (10 cm × 10 cm) with Ti current-collecting grids, static compression of the TiO2 photoelectrode and a sputtered Pt CE.231 Instead, parallel modules developed with photoelectrodes on metallic foils (see Fig. 11) use arrays of rectangular cells with a silver collecting grid printed on the plastic counterelectrode. A few papers are reported in the literature, developed on Ti or StSt, with efficiencies between 3 and 7%,145,153,179,235–237 where performance depends also strongly on the foil surface pretreatment applied.
 Fig. 11  (Left image) A photograph of the metal–plastic parallel module (CHOSE laboratories). (Right image) Cross section of a parallel Ti/plastic-CE module with: conductive Ag collecting grids for current collection; primary sealing which protects the grids from electrolyte corrosion, seals the two electrodes together and avoids egress of the electrolyte; secondary sealing applied at the perimeter for improved bonding and to minimize ingress of oxygen and water vapour; the multilayer ultra-high barrier film applied over the plastic electrode to minimize gas permeation rates. Combined encapsulation and barrier strategies like these, in tandem with stable active material combinations, are developed to increase lifetimes. 
Regarding the Z-type series architecture, a large 30 cm × 30 cm fully plastic module integrating 10 unit cells via vertical interconnections between cells was exhibited in Expo Aichi 2005 by Ikegami et al. 3.5 cm × 30 cm rectangular cells were interconnected along their long edge with a double-sticky conductive tape applied on printed conductive silver busbars treated at temperatures <120 °C. The TiO2 mesoscopic titania layer was fabricated following the low temperature procedure introduced by Miyasaka et al.,238 while titanium/platinum was sputtered on PEN/ITO CE.27 Metal based DSC series modules do not follow the integrated approach of the Z-type series of depositing all the active and conductive layers simultaneously on common substrates. This is because a common metal foil would short all the cells together. Fabrication of stripe cells and their subsequent electrical connection and integration (lamination) together on (with) flexible insulating substrates yield series architectures such as those already commercially manufactured by G24 Power Ltd. Their large area modules (>200 cm2) at the time of writing consisted of Ti-based PEs and plastic film CEs138 with an unpublished PCE of 4.97% at 1 Sun (ref. 139) and, as will be detailed in Section 10.1 (operation in relevant environments), with high power densities in indoor lighting, outperforming other main competing flexible photovoltaic technologies.
The first example of the W series-interconnected module, which requires no additional metallic interconnects (such a Z architectures) or collecting grids (such a parallel modules), but requires shaping neighboring cells in two different sizes in order to match the currents flowing through all cells (due to the fact that, for each pair, one cell is illuminated from the PE and its up-side-down neighbor from the CE) was recently demonstrated. Both electrodes were treated by UV-processing which permitted platinization and post-treatment of the TiO2 on a common plastic substrate simultaneously yielding a PCE of 2.3% at 1 Sun and 2.7% at 0.3 Sun on an active area of 16.4 cm2.116 A selection of results of FDSC modules are summarized in Table 5.

Compared to conventional architectures, the development of highly conductive metal meshes has led to a novel approach based on the development of very large area single cells in order to overcome the limit of the considerable size of the inactive areas remaining between cells (after fabricating modules as a multitude of narrow rectangular cells). Single flexible devices with an active area of over 100 cm2 were demonstrated. TiO2 nanoparticles or 3-D interpenetrating network of TiO2 nanowires were prepared on Ti as PEs. PEDOT-Pt or Pt-single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were deposited on the Ti mesh for highly transparent and high catalytic CEs. These backside-illuminated large-area (100 cm2) devices delivered high efficiencies for such areas under outdoor conditions (at 0.55 Sun) of 6.69% and 6.43% respectively.143,239
8.2. Large area manufacturing
The industrialization of FDSC technology passes also through the tackling of some important technological challenges related to large-area manufacturing, high throughputs and low-cost materials and processes. Industrialization of FDSCs, such as those sought or implemented by companies or centers operating in the field, often aim to, or have already, set up a continuous line for the manufacturing of flexible modules. Similarly to the flexible OPV field, roll-to-roll (R2R) fabrication can sustain high volume production of large area devices240 whilst reducing costs per m2. This review has attempted to cover not only the materials but also the coating, printing and post-processing options for the two functionalized electrodes (i.e. PE and CE) in previous paragraphs, so will not be repeated in this section. Apart from these, other issues pertaining industrial production of modules should be tackled. For example, we have seen that, for the Z and parallel architecture prototypes developed in the academic literature, low-temperature printable silver pastes are often utilized. Their mechanical stability and resistance to delamination after numerous bending cycles is still to be demonstrated. A further important issue in large volume manufacturing is to streamline the process of module assembly. It is thus interesting to delve into the patent landscape to have an idea of some of the solutions adopted for the production of FDSC modules. A number of these pertain to assembling strategies with a metal foil photoelectrode.
For instance in ref. 241 a method is disclosed for the mass production of identical, rectangular-shaped FDSCs. A plurality of electrodes is pre-formed from a common substrate and are cut and separated at a later stage (e.g. by water jet or laser cutting). After the cells are finished they can be incorporated into a semi-rigid printed circuit board and interconnected according to a Z-series architecture.242

Ref. 243 and 244 disclose R-2-R methods to form a Z series-connected module from a plurality of single stripe cells. All the photo-electrodes are processed (TiO2 deposition in rectangular stripes, sintering and dye application) over the same metallic substrate.245 The substrate is successively divided into separated metallic strips (each corresponding to the PE of the unit cells), and then interconnected and sealed on top with a single, Pt-coated, conductive and transparent plastic substrate, i.e. the CE which had its ITO scribed away between the strips in order to electrically insulate the CEs of each cell. Fig. 12 (top) shows part of the fabrication process. The same patent245 also proposes various methods to obtain reliable Z-series interconnections between the cells including the use of soldering irons to connect PE and CE, whilst in ref. 246 interconnections are implemented by wires coated with a surrounding layer of a metal that possesses a low melting temperature so that, upon lamination at appropriate temperatures, the metal flows helping to forge a more durable and effective contact between the metal PE and the plastic CE (see Fig. 12, middle). Ref. 247 discloses a method to realize fully plastic FDSCs and joining them utilizing a fixing member, which is generally conductive and clamps, in some sections, both plastic substrates (see Fig. 12, bottom).

A rolling metallic substrate on which a plurality of TiO2 film strips has been previously printed is cut in order to separate single photoelectrodes and successively separated for subsequent manufacturing steps. (b) A method to contact cells utilising a metal with high melting temperature core coated with a low T melting metal.246 (c) Schematics of a method for series connection utilizing a fixing member.247 
It is interesting to note that due to the nature of metallic substrates (for which electrical isolation by cutting is the easiest option) and the difficulty in maintaining a sturdy vertical connection by simple printing like in glass based modules (due to the laxness of thin plastic films) the examples described above typically fabricate a plurality of cells first and then interconnect them together subsequently, differently from the typical integrated manufacturing on common substrate options adopted in glass based devices.
9. Encapsulation and lifetime
With a view to its operation as a product, the modules' architecture, geometry, interconnections and active materials are not only designed to maximize the power output but have to be able to sustain performance over the lifetime of the application.248–252 We have seen in the previous sections that for the latter, electrolytes and dyes play a crucial role. Devices also require protection from extrinsic causes of degradation, i.e. moisture and oxygen ingress from outside which can cause dye desorption, electrolyte degradation (e.g. bleaching), and also leakage/evaporation from inside. Thus lifetime requires a two-pronged approach: stable active materials combinations and effective encapsulation. The latter (see Fig. 11, right) typically starts with a reliable primary sealant, which is applied at the perimeter of the active areas, bonding together the two electrodes of the sandwich structure, defining the thickness and volume of the electrolyte chamber, often protecting the metallic interconnects (collecting grids in parallel modules and vertical interconnections in Z series architectures) from coming into contact with the corrosive electrolyte whilst also preventing its egress. Additionally a secondary sealant and/or barrier layers/laminates are applied to prevent or diminish permeation of oxygen and water vapour. Primary sealants for DSCs are typically thermoplastic polymer films61,248,253–255 or even printable resins/glues.228,256,257 For FDSCs, the most commonly utilized are of the former commercial thermoplastic type, e.g. Bynel and Surlyn. Since Surlyn cannot withstand sustained temperatures much higher than 60 °C, which is too low for outdoor conditions,250 Bynel is more appropriate for such applications258,259 while Surlyn can remain a good choice for indoor use, where temperature and humidity conditions are more moderate. In fact, plastic modules using Surlyn demonstrated 220 hours stability, in dark under accelerated ageing tests (55 °C and 95% humidity),260 while a cell with the same LiI-free electrolyte, the same sealing and a glass-based CE showed a lifetime of 800 h under light irradiation (1000 W m−2) at 50 °C. Very promising results are reported by Lee et al.145 where a Ti/plastic sub-module with a low volatile electrolyte and a wide absorption spectrum CYC-B11 dye was tested under 1 Sun at T = 50 °C. After 1560 h the sub-module PCE maintained 80% of its initial value (see Fig. 13).

In a glass-based DSC, it is the glass substrates that act as exceptionally good barriers: exchange with the outside environment is limited to the very thin perimeter boundary (and electrolyte filling hole) of the permeable primary sealant between the two glass plates. But when the relatively permeable plastic sheets replace glass, the areas and pathways enabling permeation of gases increases tremendously. Using a metallic sheet as the substrate for one of the two electrodes can halve the problem without solving it. A plastic substrate having an adequate water vapour transport rate (WVTR) is required10 to ensure a stable and durable encapsulation, crucial for FDSCs to move quickly ‘from the laboratory bench to the factory gate’, in the same vein as for flexible organic photovoltaics and electronics (e.g. OPV, OLEDs, TFTs). Moreover plastics, especially PEN, suffer from long-term UV irradiation, which alters their optical transmittance (yellowing)261 and also leads to dye and strong electrolyte degradation (bleaching).252,262 Therefore, UV barriers become necessary.7
So far, in the field of FDSCs, apart from a small number of publications,263 most studies on stability and long term durability have focused on alternative cell materials (e.g. less volatile solvents and/or quasi solid electrolytes), avoiding the use of LiI or other inorganic cations to prevent ITO degradation, developing more water resistant devices7,264,265 (see also sections on dyes and electrolytes) more than on encapsulants and/or barriers.
In contrast, encapsulation for OPV has become a hot topic, mainly because the monolithic structure of its modules entails that the top of the device is exposed directly to air if not immediately sealed (whereas for FDSCs most architectures have an ITO-coated plastic and/or a metallic substrate enclosing the active layers on both sides which already acts as an initial barrier). Krebs et al.266,267 utilized commercially available low-cost materials with good barrier properties (WVTR = 0.04 g per m2 per day, oxygen transmission rate OTR < 0.01 cm3 m−2 per bar per day) for their OPV modules and often incorporated a UV-filter film,268 suitable for roll-to-roll lamination evaluated in a 900 h lifetime test at 35 °C.267
As mentioned before, in theory, even for flexible DSCs the best barrier could consist of glass. Some important glass suppliers such as Corning and Schott have developed ultra-thin (25–100 μm) flexible glass for electronic applications (touch screens and similar) even suitable for R2R fabrication. However, these have not yet been tested in FDSCs in the literature. In practice glass is a brittle material so that the development of rugged permeation barriers which are at the same time transparent and flexible without adding significant cost to the final product is an ongoing and a complex undertaking. An effective strategy to implement FDSCs may consist of drawing on the experience of the flexible OPV and OLED fields. Huang et al.263 demonstrated sputtered aluminum oxynitride (AlOxNy) on PEN to be a good barrier film (WVTR = 0.02 g per m2 per day): flexible DSCs equipped with such a layer sustained 50% of its initial PCE even after 300 h of storage. In February 2014 G24 Power Ltd. ensured 3 years lifetime in an attuned environment for its modules protected by a vapour barrier polymer front sheet with high light transmission.138 Further and in-depth studies have to be addressed to evaluate the long-term stability of encapsulated devices, mainly during operation. Since the required WVTR to assure sufficient protection for thousands of hours of operation should be in the 10−3 to 10−6 g per m2 per day range269,270 techniques such as ALD and sputtering are continuing to be developed as effective processes for depositing barrier layers, even compatible with a roll-to-roll manufacturing. A multi-layer barrier approach can be an effective solution.42,271 Fahlteich et al. reported two layers of metal oxide, e.g. aluminum oxide or zinc–tin oxide,272 separated by a hybrid polymeric layer,42 and deposited by sputtering and magnetron-PECVD. Such multilayer stacks show very good permeation barrier properties, high optical transmission, and good UV, mechanical and temperature stability which are also required for FDSCs7 and should therefore, with these, be tested.
10. Operation, applications, costs and markets
10.1. Operation of the technology in relevant environments
As mentioned in the preceding sections, under outdoor or solar simulator illumination conditions, considering only module size (which customarily present lower performance per unit area compared to the small laboratory cells (see Tables 1–3 for these) as for all PV technologies), the highest PCEs reported (see Table 5) over these large (active) areas are 7% with PEs on Ti foil145,273 and 4.5% on plastic.231 Promising stability has been reported under certain light soaking conditions, as those shown in Fig. 13, but which nevertheless needs to improve especially under real changing (high illumination, temperature excursions, UV and humidity) outdoor conditions to compete for applications with other PV technologies.274 Outdoors, a recent study275 implemented the peculiar property of FDSCs of being able to be conformed to curved surfaces and analyzed the energy produced by a large area 8 cm2 cell over the course of a diurnal cycle: compared to flat devices, curved cells delivered up to almost 10% enhancement of energy produced per unit of occupied projected area demonstrating the attractiveness and possibilities of portable, light-weight, 3D and conformal FDSC technology.
Recently, a number of studies276–280 have pointed out that DSCs represent the best-performing technology for harvesting energy from indoor illumination. FDSCs deliver more power per unit area than even flexible OPV and amorphous silicon under 102 to 103 lux illuminance138,276 (a-Si previously being considered the most suitable for indoor light harvesting). The remarkable indoor performance of DSCs is due to a combination of factors: better match of the illumination spectra with the external quantum efficiencies of DSCs (compared to the Sun, for example, fluorescent lamps emit a much higher fraction of their light in the visible range which is where most dyes absorb strongly), very good (and in selected ranges superior) performance under low levels of incident power and oblique angles of incidence.229,281 G24 Power Ltd. (or G24i at the time), at the Dye Solar Cell Industrialization Conference 2010 (DSC-IC 2010), presented a doubling in the power density output by changing part of the materials and chemistry in the DSC system, from 3.43 to 6.73 μW cm−2 at 200 lux. In early 2014, these power density values advertised on their website for their product devices were also accompanied by a lifetime of 3 years in the attuned indoor range (50–2000 lux and operating temperatures of 10–50 °C). At the EuroNanoForum conference in 2013 their indoor modules (200–1000 lux) outperformed a-Si ones (showing very high efficiencies estimated to be around 15% notwithstanding the difficulty of carrying out indoor measurements and lack of existing standard protocols for these). Always indoors, Miyasaka et al. demonstrated a high 110 V voltage output delivered by a very large 1 m × 2 m flexible DSC panel composed of ninety six 10 cm × 10 cm plastic–plastic sub-modules.101
10.2. Applications, costs and markets
Due to both the remarkably high power densities generated, and the stability issues which still need to be solved to guarantee long-lasting devices under all outdoor conditions, the immediate ‘natural' target market for FDSCs is represented by indoor low-power applications. G24 Power Ltd., relatively recently has seemed to embrace this business opportunity, even changing its web site, highlighting its offer for indoor applications. The technology is suitable for recharging consumer electronic devices (for many of these, current lifetimes are similar to those of FDSCs), powering wireless devices (sensors, actuators, displays) for improving the management of indoor environments (energy, comfort, information, etc.), making these (and fitted products) “smart” (e.g. in domotics/home automation) and for electronic devices utilised for retail trade (ePrices, RFid Tags, POS shelf Talkers, Powered Smart Card).138 Depending on location, placement and living conditions, the technology is also envisaged to compare favourably with wired energy in terms of installation costs and flexibility; with disposable batteries for maintenance costs, functionality and environmental impact, with some other mechanical (vibration), and thermal energy-harvesting sources in performance per cm3, and with other flexible photovoltaics (see section above) such as a-Si delivering greater power under low level light conditions.276 It can also be tailored in form, dimensions and colour for custom projects282 and being thin, lightweight and conformal is more easily integrated into the electrical device it needs to power (opening routes to easy-to-install self-powered electronics and to fit-and-forget sensors with negligible maintenance costs). In 2013 Dyesol Ltd. and Printed Power teamed up to integrate DSCs (not specified, in the press release, whether with rigid or flexible substrates, both of which Dyesol has had interests in) with printed batteries and power management systems to create fully integrated combined energy generation and storage devices.283
In early 2014 a number of commercial products powered by FDSCs onto which they were integrated were available on the market. Amongst these we mention for instance the e-reader cover by Leia Media138 the bluetooth keyboard by Logitech,284 the indoor cylindrical gas sensor, by Argus Security285 and motorized shades by Skyco.286
Market studies support these intuitions and foresee strong expanding business opportunities in these fields (see Fig. 14) and in the emerging market of the Internet of Things, where billions of physical devices will be interconnected together (in a network). According to projections by IDTechEx, the market for DSCs (in general) will slowly grow to over $130 million in the next decade287 starting out with indoor low-power portable products to much larger outdoor applications. Markets will expand in tandem with continuous improvement in performance and lifetime. In fact the roadmap for FDSC development aims to satisfy the harsh demands of continuous outdoor use, and, thus, to being applied for example on clothes, shelters and ultimately BIPV which represents a huge market.288
 Fig. 14  Current and envisaged future products integrating (flexible and rigid) DSCs.287 The current main sector of application is in indoor, portable and disposable electronics but DSCs are forecasted to penetrate in several market segments in the next few years, including BIPV, depending on opportunities, technical developments and competition. Figure reproduced with permission from ref. 287 © IDTechEx. 
The success of future penetration of FDSCs into such promising markets also depends on reducing costs, which vary depending on application but a target ≤1 $ per Wp being common to many PV technologies.254,289 As we have seen in the previous sections, the choice of abundant, low-energy materials/processes and the implementation of continuous high-throughput roll-to-roll production are promising strategies to follow for reducing product costs.6 Cost analyses for FDSCs mainly refer to cost evaluations for OPV266 or glass-based DSCs since they share many common components.254,289 Compared to glass DSCs significant reduction of costs in substrate components was estimated both for plastics and metal foils (especially the more abundant ones like aluminum)6,7 although one needs to consider the cost of additional permeation barriers which will also depend on the sensitivity of the active materials to gas ingress. Considering production capacities of 10 MW per year, one can estimate costs well below 100 $ per m2 including manufacturing, materials, labour, capital and overheads.6,289,290 Notwithstanding the difficulty of making reliable future cost estimates for a new technology, an outdoor efficiency of 5% brings these in the 1.5–2 $ per Wp range and below 1 $ per Wp for efficiencies in the 8–10% range. Clearly, the roadmap for large-scale penetration of FDSCs must not only maximize the market potential of its peculiar characteristics (conformal, light-weight, flexible, customizable in forms and colours etc.) but simultaneously achieve ever higher targets pertaining its efficiency (in relevant environments) and costs, together with the appropriate lifetimes required by each application.
11. Alternative device architectures and concepts
Most of the device architectures developed in FDSCs, and encountered in the previous sections, have been of the sandwich type, based on plastic substrates coated with TCOs and/or metallic foils which either need to be scribed or cut in the process of manufacturing series-connected modules. When reviewing the sections on substrates and electrodes, we have already come across the growing literature on TCO-free and metal mesh-based FDSCs for the fabrication of both PEs and CEs.7,32,54–57,291Fig. 15 (top left) shows the microcopy of a StSt mesh onto which the mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited after a 3-cycle dip and subsequent spray coating of a TiO2 solution followed by sintering at 500 °C for 15 min.54 The CE consisted of a 0.05 mm thick Pt foil. 6.1% efficient devices were obtained by stacking together a TCO-free PET insulating film, a sheet of flexible mesoporous titania supported by a metal mesh, a gel electrolyte sheet and a Pt/Ti sheet.53
 Fig. 15  (Top left) SEM photos of the metallic mesh coated with porous TiO2 layer to be used as a TCO-free photoelectrode.54 (Top right) cylindrical transparent TCO-free FDSC consisting of a plastic tube/stainless steel mesh-TiO2-dye/gel electrolyte/Pt–Ti rod.321 (Bottom left) SEM image of a flexible device in which two wires, CE and PE, are intertwined to form a DSC.294 (Bottom right) A TCO-free monolithic dye solar cell consisting of two coplanar charge-collecting electrodes. Pt was deposited on the bottom electrode and a titanium working electrode was deposited over a porous ZrO2 spacer layer. The dye sensitized layer was applied over the stack. The top substrate was a plastic transparent insulating film for a flexible cell and required for electrolyte/device encapsulation.292 Figures reproduced with permission from: (top, left) ref. 54 © 2007 AIP Publishing LLC; (top, right) ref. 321 © 2013 OSA; (bottom, left) ref. 294 © 2008 John Wiley and Sons; (bottom, right) ref. 292 © 2013 RSC. 
The use of metallic meshes opened up the possibility of fabricating TCO-less devices in a three-dimensional cylinder architecture (Fig. 15, top right).55 The flexible solar cell consisted of a porous silicone tube (A), a titanium-coated stainless metal mesh tube working as a CE (B), a gel electrolyte tube based on a PTFE sheet (C), a dye sensitized mesoporous titania tube (D) fabricated on a protected stainless metal mesh tube working as PE (E), and a transparent plastic tube (F). With this configuration, the total electric energy output (generated in a day) reported was 1.3 times larger than that of the TCO-less flat device.
Another different architecture compared to the common planar independent PE/CE sandwich structure shown in Fig. 2 was proposed by Fu et al. (Fig. 15, bottom right).292 In this structure, a platinized flexible Ti foil was used as the bottom substrate and acted as the CE onto which a porous ZrO2 spacer layer was coated. Subsequently a thin Ti film was deposited (acting as the PE) and also a mesoporous TiO2 layer with electrolyte injected into the porous matrix finally completing the device (capped by a top transparent substrate to contain the liquid but with no electrical functions). This TCO-free architecture delivered a PCE of 4.2%. Cha et al.293 developed another TCO-free design, in which the PE, a conductive metal mesh, and the CE, were bonded to a glass fiber paper, which was filled with electrolyte maintaining its PCE even when bended to a 2 cm radius of curvature.
Flexibility and miniaturization were taken to remarkable levels with the development of wire shaped FDSCs (see Fig. 15, bottom left). ITO-free, wire-shaped FDSCs were formed by twisting two fiber-like electrodes (one acting as PE and the other as CE) in a helic-like structure.32,294 The successful implementation of metal wires or cheap flexible commercial threads as DSC electrodes represents a possibly interesting concept for future wearable solar cells since.295–298 Although it is presumably difficult to gauge the PCEs for such shaped miniature devices, a PCE of 7.2% and 8.5% were reported using titanium wire coated with TiO2 nanoparticles as PE and either platinized StSt wire or graphene/CNT composite fiber with Pt nanoparticles as CE.297,299 PEDOT:PSS-coated flexible commercial carbon fibers and polyester threads were also integrated as CE in fiber-shaped DSCs delivering a PCE of 5.5% and 4.8% respectively.295,296
12. Conclusions and outlook
We have reviewed flexible dye solar cell (FDSC) technology. Metal based devices permit high temperature processes for more effective charge collection but are limited by issues including partial opacity of electrolytes and corrosion of the cheapest metallic foils. Constraints arising from stability of plastic substrates have brought the development of a surprising breadth of different material formulations, especially for the fabrication of the photo- and counter-electrodes (PEs and CEs), and processing techniques, with results that in a number of cases come close to glass-based devices for both photo- and counter-electrodes. Efficiencies above 8.5% for metal–plastic devices and above 8% for plastic–plastic devices on small active areas and 5–7% on the active area of larger modules have been reported under standard AM1.5G illumination conditions. Remarkable power outputs, superior than some of the main competing flexible photovoltaic technologies, have been observed under indoor conditions. In fact, the integration and commercial availability of FDSCs in portable or indoor products represents an important endorsement for this technology, which the field has to exploit as a launching pad for continual development in the roadmap of improved performance and market adoption. Roadmaps must consider power output, costs and stability, apart from the peculiar desirable characteristics of easy-integration of thin, lightweight, conformable FDSCs. Thus material combinations with highly stable, transparent (especially for metal PEs), less corrosive (even solid or quasi solid) electrolytes, and stable strongly absorbing dyes, more resistant to ingress of moisture from the outside, must be developed in parallel to continually more effective solutions for cost-effective transparent, flexible encapsulants and permeation barriers. Maintaining efficiency and performance consistently close to laboratory prototypes over total large-area modules produced in an industrially applicable manufacturing line is also a challenge including assembling PEs with even higher collection efficiencies on plastic, for example. Reviewing the literature it becomes apparent that there are not enough studies concerning the long term stability of FDSCs, which needs to be improved over continual operation in outdoor environments and thus requires more consistent efforts in order to compete in that arena with inorganic flexible photovoltaics already on the market. Furthermore FDSCs compete with new generation technologies such as flexible organic300–311 and perovskite135,312,313 cells which can also represent an opportunity for cross-fertilization for future hybrid devices. Finally, recent development of TCO-free architectures, including integrating conducting meshes, monolithic designs and cylindrical and wire shaped devices represent a proof that the technology is a fertile ground for new concepts.

 	Fig. 1  Schematics of the basic operation of a dye solar cell (DSC) consisting in its simplest form of two conducting substrates. On the left is the electron collecting electrode (photoelectrode, PE) covered by a mesoporous TiO2 layer, sensitized by a monolayer of dye molecules. Light excites the molecule (S*). The electron is injected into the conduction band (C.B.) of the TiO2 where it diffuses into the transparent contact. After flowing through the load, the electron is shuttled towards the dye (which reverts back to its ground state S0) via ions in the electrolyte. The catalyst layer of the counterelectrode (Pt in this embodiment) enables the effective reduction of the ionic species of the Red–Ox couple and thus a quick passage of charges between the electrode and the electrolyte.	 
S0 + hv → S* (light absorption by the dye)
S* → S+ + e− (TiO2) (electron injection from the dye into the TiO2)
e− (TiO2) → e− (PE) (electron transport in the TiO2 layer)
2S+ + 3I− → 2S0 + I3− (dye regeneration via I− ions)
I3− (CE) + 2e− (CE) → 3I− (CE) (charge transfer reaction catalyzed by the CE material, Pt in Fig. 1)
3I− (CE) → 3I− (PE) iodide diffusion from the CE to the PE
I3− (PE) → I3− (CE) tri-iodide diffusion from the PE to the CE

 	Fig. 2  Main sandwich-type architectures (above) for flexible dye solar cells (FDSCs) and associated photographs (CHOSE laboratories) of such devices (below). (a) FDSC with bottom metal substrate as the photoelectrode and top conductive plastic as the counterelectrode through which light is incident and partially absorbed by the electrolyte chamber before reaching the dye sensitized layer; (b) FDSC with both substrates being conductive plastic films. In (b) light is shone through the (top) photoelectrode. Another type of device consists of a metal substrate as the counterelectrode and a conductive plastic film as the photo-electrode (not shown).

 	Fig. 10  Normalized efficiency of a plastic dye solar cell during a light soaking ageing test at 1 sun and 60 °C assembled with different electrolytes showing the considerable bearing of electrolytes on the lifetime of FDSCs: bi-EL is a binary ionic gellified electrolyte with 17.5% of TiO2 Degussa P25, while LE-EL is a gel electrolyte made by adding 17.5% of TiO2 Degussa P25 to a methoxyproprionitrile based formulation.78 Figure reproduced with permission from ref. 78 © 2013 Elsevier.	 

 	Fig. 11  (Left image) A photograph of the metal–plastic parallel module (CHOSE laboratories). (Right image) Cross section of a parallel Ti/plastic-CE module with: conductive Ag collecting grids for current collection; primary sealing which protects the grids from electrolyte corrosion, seals the two electrodes together and avoids egress of the electrolyte; secondary sealing applied at the perimeter for improved bonding and to minimize ingress of oxygen and water vapour; the multilayer ultra-high barrier film applied over the plastic electrode to minimize gas permeation rates. Combined encapsulation and barrier strategies like these, in tandem with stable active material combinations, are developed to increase lifetimes.
