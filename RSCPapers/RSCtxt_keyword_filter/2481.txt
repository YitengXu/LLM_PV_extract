    , Accepted 19th June 2015First published on 19th June 2015AbstractWe report the addition of a small amount of Pb(SCN)2 into PbI2 in a two-step solution method. The resulting CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x perovskite films present larger-sized crystals and fewer traps than CH3NH3PbI3. Their planar solar cells exhibit a maximum power conversion efficiency of 11.07% with remarkably high reproducibility and good stability.
All-solid-state hybrid solar cells based on ABX3 (where A is a small organic molecule such as methylammonium or formamidinium, B is a metal such as lead or tin, and X is a halogen) perovskites have recently attracted much attention due to their excellent light absorbing characteristics, solution processability and low cost.1–6 Since 2009, perovskite solar cells have demonstrated remarkable progress and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to a certified value of 20.1% has been achieved.7 It now becomes increasingly clear that reproducibility and long-term stability remain the two crucial challenges of high-efficiency perovskite cells prior to the realization of their commercialization.
As is well-known, the crystalline morphology of the perovskite film is crucial to achieving high efficiency and good reproducibility of the cell performance.8–10 Recently, a two-step deposition method has been widely used for the fabrication of perovskite films because it is relatively easy to obtain a uniform crystalline morphology. In this method, a metal halide is firstly spin-coated onto the substrate and then methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite is formed by dipping or spin-coating methylammonium iodide.11–13 It was reported that the introduction of chloride can permit the easy control of the perovskite film morphology; for instance, the morphology-controlled CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites can be prepared by mixing CH3NH3Cl with CH3NH3I or mixing PbCl2 with PbI2 in such a sequential fabrication.14–16 In another work, by precise control of the CH3NH3Br:CH3NH3I molar ratio in the reaction with PbI2, large-sized CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx having an enlarged bandgap of 1.72 eV was obtained.17
Thiocyanic (SCN) is a kind of stable pseudohalogen that has similar properties to halogen. In addition, SCN− and I− have similar ionic radii. Of critical importance is the fact that incorporation of the SCN group in the sensitizing dye structure can improve the optical absorption and charge transport, leading to a higher photocurrent density.18 Moreover, such a SCN group was utilized in a hole-transporting layer—p-type copper thiocyanate (CuSCN)—in perovskite based solar cells due to its good transparency, high hole mobility and good chemical stability. The CuSCN layer ensured effective hole extraction and collection, leading to an improved PCE value of 12.4%.19
Herein, we report a facile two-step method of formation of the uniform, compact perovskite films by spin-coating a mixture of PbI2 and Pb(SCN)2 source in the first step, followed by coating of a CH3NH3I layer. The final mixed CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x perovskite film displays much larger-sized crystals and fewer traps than CH3NH3PbI3. A high efficiency of 11.07% was achieved for the CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x devices with a planar device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/Ca/Al under AM 1.5G sunlight irradiation. Importantly, devices based on these mixed perovskite films exhibit remarkably high reproducibility and good stability. Note that we have also applied the one-step method of preparing the CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x film, which, however, shows a notably poor film morphology in the absence of additives compared to that prepared using the two-step method.
All perovskite films in this work were prepared via the two-step solution method, as shown in Fig. 1a. Specifically, 1M PbI2 with or without the presence of 5 wt% Pb(SCN)2 and 40 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I were first dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) and 2-propanol, respectively. A hot solution of PbI2 or PbI2/Pb(SCN)2 mixture at 80 °C was spin-coated onto the substrate at 3000 rpm for 40 s, immediately followed by spin-coating of a CH3NH3I layer at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Subsequently, the film was annealed at 100 °C for 5 min to obtain the perovskite film.

We first compared the optical properties of CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x and conventional CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites, as shown in Fig. 1. Both perovskite films show similar optical absorption spectra (Fig. 1b), but CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x exhibits a notably stronger absorption at 400–625 nm. In addition, these two films display a PL emission peak around 780 nm (Fig. 1c). However, CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x shows a much stronger PL intensity, indicating fewer traps and defects within the film.20
Phase structures of the prepared CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x were then studied by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x shown at 14.10°, 28.47° and 31.93° are assigned as the (110), (220) and (310) lattice planes, respectively, which are consistent with those of pure CH3NH3PbI3.21,22 This indicates that the crystal growth in the perovskite film is not structurally affected by the addition of Pb(SCN)2, which is similar to that of Cl incorporation in mixed halide perovskites.23 Moreover, the intensities of all XRD peaks in CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x are considerably stronger than those of pure CH3NH3PbI3, suggesting that the addition of Pb(SCN)2 favours the perovskite crystallization. We also noted that the diffraction peaks in CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x are sharper than CH3NH3PbI3, implying increased crystallinity with fewer defects and decreased scattering of grain boundaries.9,23 There is an additional diffraction peak at 12.58° in CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x, which is ascribed to the residual PbI2. The existence of Pb(SCN)2 may hinder the conversion of PbI2 to perovskite to some degree. However, the exact mechanism of such solid-state precursor reactions remains unclear. It has been reported that a small amount of PbI2 generated a passivation layer at the grain boundaries, thereby reducing the charge recombination and improving the device performance.24–27

To examine the effects of the addition of Pb(SCN)2 on the crystalline morphology, field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was carried out. As shown in Fig. 3, CH3NH3PbI3 displays much smaller-sized perovskite crystals than CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x. Also, the sizes of these large CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x crystals, which were analysed as shown in Fig. S1,† exhibit a distribution of more than 80% crystals in the range of 230–600 nm size. Such large-sized crystals in the perovskite bulk film are beneficial for charge transport in the perovskite.9 In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (Fig. S2†) shows the signal of sulfur element, implying that SCN− remains in the final CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x film. Furthermore, Raman spectra (Fig. S3†) show that CH3NH3PbI3–x(SCN)x exhibits a band at 98 cm−1, an upshift compared to that of CH3NH3PbI3 at 94 cm−1 which is assigned to the stretching of the Pb–I bond.28 Such a shift is presumably caused by the interaction between the Pb atom and the SCN group.

The influence of such a favourable crystalline morphology on the device performance was investigated in comparative studies. The devices possess a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM/Ca/Al, as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices with reverse scan direction under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight irradiation, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The best CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell exhibits a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.72 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V and a fill factor (FF) of 73%, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.24%. By contrast, the most efficient CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x based solar cell exhibits a Jsc of 15.51 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.05 V and a FF of 68%, giving a PCE of 11.07%. The improvement of PCE is attributed to the larger-sized crystalline grains and fewer traps of the CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x film compared to CH3NH3PbI3. Fig. 4c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of both CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x cells. The maximum EQE values of CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x reach over 75% in the range of 500–750 nm. Efficiency histograms of 20 individual devices are shown in Fig. 4d. It is evidently shown that CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x devices exhibit much better reproducibility in performance than CH3NH3PbI3 ones, which can be attributed to the improved morphology of the perovskite film caused by the addition of Pb(SCN)2. We noted that upon continuous 1 sun light irradiation for one hour, the CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x cells showed only 8% drop of PCE, while the PCE value of the reference CH3NH3PbI3 devices decreased dramatically by 42%, as shown in Table S2.†
In addition, the anomalous hysteresis was a general issue in evaluating the perovskite solar cells.29,30 As shown in Fig. S4,† compared to CH3NH3PbI3, a substantially reduced hysteresis was observed in CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x, which can be explained by the large crystal size in our SEM observation. It has been reported that capacitive charge tends to be stored in smaller crystals.31 Lastly, note that all the above studies are based on CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x with 5 wt% Pb(SCN)2, which is the optimum composition for yielding the best device performance in our systematic studies. Table S1† displays the photovoltaic performances of devices with other amounts (1 and 10 wt%) of Pb(SCN)2. We anticipate that further optimization of the Pb(SCN)2 composition ratio in CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x would notably improve the solar cell performance.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the addition of a small amount of Pb(SCN)2 into PbI2 in a two-step solution method of preparing uniform, compact perovskite films. The resulting CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x mixed perovskite film displays the enhanced optical absorption, larger crystal size and fewer traps than conventional CH3NH3PbI3 film. The best power conversion efficiency of over 11% was obtained from planar CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x/PC61BM bilayer heterojunction solar cells. Importantly, the performance of CH3NH3PbI3−x(SCN)x cells show remarkably higher reproducibility and better stability than CH3NH3PbI3 ones.
