    , Accepted 25th May 2020First published on 26th May 2020AbstractA dye-sensitized betavoltaic cell is developed for the first time, which utilizes radioisotopic carbon, composed of nano-sized quantum dots, and ruthenium-based dye sensitized TiO2 as electrodes. In this cell, emitted beta radiations are absorbed by the dye rather than TiO2, which resulted in enhanced performance compared to the pristine betavoltaic cell.
Betavoltaic cells, similar in concept to a photovoltaic cell, combine a beta radiation source with a p–n junction semiconductor couple.1 The beta radiation impinges on the semiconductor p–n junction, thereby exciting the valence band electrons into the conduction band.1,2 The useful life time of a betavoltaic device depends upon the half-life of the isotope; with tritium, for example, it can be used for at least 10 years. A critical factor influencing betavoltaic performance is the radioisotope, like H-3, Ni-63, S-35,3–5 and Pm-147,6 each of which have their own energy density and half-life, which are inversely related.1 The first betavoltaic cell was reported by Paul Rapport in 1953; the cell, fabricated utilizing Sr90–Y90 as a radioactive source, exhibited an efficiency of 0.2%.7 Several researchers have explored semiconductor materials such as SiC, GaN, and GaAs to improve conversion efficiencies.6,8,9 Cheng and co-workers fabricated betavoltaic cells using nanotubes of graphene-TiO2, and black titania.10,11
Over the past several decades there has been extensive research and development of solar cell technologies.12–15 For example, in 1991 Grätzel et al., reported on the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells,12 and in 2009 Kojima et al. explored the potential of perovskite solar cells using a combination of organic dyes and organometallic halide perovskites.14 Herein, we report on a dye-sensitized betavoltaic cell (DSBC), a new addition to aforementioned technologies in the Fig. 1A, which successfully integrates two different technologies: dye-sensitized photovoltaics and beta particle excitation. In this device, carbon-14 (C-14) is concurrently used as the beta particle source and the counter electrode. In contrast with semiconductor-based betavoltaic cells, the operation of a DSBC depends on beta radiation exciting surface-bound dye molecules as opposed to UV-Vis light illumination.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of a radioisotope carbon nano/quantum dot betavoltaic cell: (A) timeline of the relative progression in solar cell technology toward dye-sensitized betavoltaic cell. (B) An illustrated mechanism for dye-sensitized betavoltaic cell. 
The morphology and chemical properties of the composite TiO2 and carbon-12 (C-12) electrode are shown in (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†); however, we note that due to safety regulations (Table S1, ESI†). C-12 electrodes were actually analyzed as a substitute isotope of similar chemical characteristics to C-14. As seen in Fig. 1B, the dual role played by the carbon, as counter electrode material and radioactive source, simplifies the device architecture. As a result of ionization driven by beta radiations, see Fig. 1B, the electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye molecules are excited into its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The excited electrons are injected into the TiO2 conduction band, from which they pass through the external circuit reaching the counter electrode. Finally, the electrons undergo a conventional redox process in the electrolyte involving the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) reaction by which the dye is regenerated.16
The electrochemical J–V characteristics of the DSBC were investigated in comparison to several control cells that included a blank cell (no dye and no radiation), a dye-sensitized cell (dye without radiation), and a pristine betavoltaic cell (no dye but with radiation). Comparison of the various control cells are shown in Fig. 2. For example, the DSBC (N719 dye) was found to have a higher short circuit current density (Jsc) and a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) with corresponding values of Jsc = 12.75 nA cm−2 and Voc = 29.2 mV as shown in Fig. 2A. When DSBC results are compared to control cells without dye, a significant difference is observed in the J–V characteristics. The enhanced J–V characteristics of the DSBC are due to charges generated by the beta radiation that are incident upon the dye molecules that, in turn, increase the electron density in the external circuit. The low performance of pristine cell can be attributed to low energy of beta radiations incapable to excite TiO2, Fig. S5, ESI.† The energy conversion efficiency of beta radiation was calculated, shown in supplementary text, using eqn (1)17,18 (1)where FF is the fill factor, ϕ is the source activity of C-14, Eavg is average beta energy (49.4 keV), e is electron charge and A is active area. The power densities of the DSBC and other control cells are shown in the Fig. 2B and experimental results obtained for each control cell are summarized in Table S2, ESI.† The DSBC produced 0.095 nW cm−2 at 29.2 mV, which corresponds to an efficiency of 0.48%. The peak splitting of the power density might be due to the back charge transfer at the counter electrode, resulting from partial defects on the conductive substrate.19–21 To the best of our knowledge, our DSBC is the first betavoltaic cell integrated with a dye and the first to achieve high current per radioactivity as compared to other betavoltaic studies (Table S3, ESI†). The DSBC generates 3.2 × 104 times more mobile electrons than those generated only by beta radiation. The enhanced electron generation is mainly attributed to electrons excited within the dye molecules due to the electron-impact multiple ionization22 or secondary ionization.23,24 However, in case of pristine TiO2 electrode this phenomenon is almost negligible due to the low energy of beta radiations. Thus, the probability of electron excitation in the TiO2 layer is very low.

As shown in Fig. 2C, the stability of a N719 DSBC over a 10 h period was measured to be 12.75 nA cm−2 at 29.2 mV. The fluctuation in Jsc and Voc may be due to a variable beta electron emission rate.25 In addition, there was a negligible change in device temperature over the 10 h period of operation, and as a result, the DSBC efficiency remained constant in the ranged of 0.40% to 0.55% as shown in Fig. 2D. After that it was decreased which is possibly due to dye degradation by high energy beta radiations26 or leakage of electrolyte.27 Quite interestingly, this is the first to report a stable betavoltaic cell. DSBC device performance was tested in comparison to DSSC performances using three different dyes as shown in Fig. S7, ESI† and summarized in Table S4, ESI.† The relative impact of the specific dye (N719) used on the performance of the DSBC was compared using the N3, and SQ2 dyes as illustrated in Fig. 3A and Table S5, ESI.† Shown in Fig. 3A are measurements of two ruthenium-based dyes wherein N719 produced 12.75 nA cm−2 at 29.2 mV with an efficiency of 0.48% while N3 produced 11.33 nA cm−2 at 23.9 mV with an efficiency of 0.244%. Energy provided by beta radiation resulted in transfer of charge from the ruthenium metal ions to the ligand (π → π*) via metal–ligand charge transition (MLCT) that leads to electron-transfer from a deprotonated carboxylate, –CO2−, group to the TiO2 anode.28 The difference in the two measured values is presumably due to varying degrees of protonation between the two dyes.28–30 The SQ2 dye compared to the N719 and N3 dyes is quite different in composition. The resulting lower performance of SQ2 is most likely due to its aromatic structure and its relatively narrow wavelength absorption spectrum. The structural limitations for the use of SQ2 in DSSC applications can be overcome by using a co-sensitization strategy or by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).31–33

Differences in charge carrier transport are also another reason for the inconsistent efficiencies between the ruthenium complexes and non-metal based organic dyes. While the ruthenium complex and SQ2 dyes have similar HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (ΔE ≈ 1.8 eV), see Fig. 3B, C and Fig. S8, ESI,† charge transfer in the ruthenium complex dyes is based upon MLCT by which an electron in the ground state (S0) absorbs energy provided by beta radiation to efficiently form a singlet excited state as well as a triplet excited state (∼10−12 s) via intersystem crossing (ISC). Given a kinetic competition between electron injection mechanisms, triplet-state electron–hole pairs, 3(e–h), are formed resulting in injection of the electron into the TiO2 conduction band, while the hole remains localized on a ruthenium dye molecule.34 Meanwhile in the metal-free organic dye SQ2, the singlet 1(e–h) pair ISC, S1 → T1, is a spin forbidden transition illustrated by the dotted yellow line in Fig. 3C. As a result, excess holes are generated in the long-lived T1 state thereby creating a crucial loss pathway, known as a triplet drain, reducing the probability of electron capture.35
In conclusion, the DSBC is an energy generating device with a MLCT-based ruthenium ligand complex dye and a C-14 as a beta radiation source and a counter electrode. This combination allows for relatively efficient electron harvesting for improved performance in a betavoltaic device. The DSBC system using the N719 dye had a maximum power density of 0.095 nW cm−2 with an energy efficiency of 0.48%. We opened the new horizon that is explored first time in the field of betavoltaic. We believe it has potential to show higher efficiency through modifications such as optimization of TiO2 thickness, dye loading and energy control of beta radiation. The use of dye-sensitized semiconductor anodes in modified betavoltaic cells will create new opportunities in the field of nuclear batteries.
