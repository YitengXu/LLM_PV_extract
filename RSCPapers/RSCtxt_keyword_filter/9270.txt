    , Accepted 25th May 2022First published on 25th May 2022AbstractThe combination of noble metal catalysts and semiconductors presents a typical avenue for boosting photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production. However, noble metal catalysts directly deposited on Si can easily aggregate into large clusters and tend to peel off from the Si surface, thereby limiting the effective use of noble metal and PEC performance of the Si photocathode. Here, we report that oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are developed as an ideal multifunctional layer between an Ir catalyst and Ni protected Si photocathode, which could not only effectively capture and stabilize atomic Ir via the newly formed O–Ir–O bonds, but also significantly enhance the reaction kinetics by accelerating charge and mass transport and reducing the energy barriers of both the Volmer and Tafel steps. A benchmarking applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 12.4% and a sustainable stability of more than 300 h are achieved under AM1.5G one sun illumination, outperforming all the previously reported Si photocathodes in alkaline media. Our findings emphasize the importance of the interlayer for the Si photocathode and offer the avenue to achieve highly efficient and durable PEC devices.

Broader context
Hydrogen generation through solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting provides a carbon-neutral alternative to solve the impending energy and environmental crisis. Although silicon (Si)-based photocathodes hold great perspective for PEC water splitting, the sluggish HER kinetics on the Si surface seriously impedes the PEC performance. Considerable efforts have been therefore devoted to functionalize the Si photocathodes with an appropriate co-catalyst, for example, noble metal catalysts. Unfortunately, the direct loading of noble metal catalysts on Si gives rise to unsatisfactory PEC performance, primarily due to the facile aggregation of noble metal catalysts and exfoliation of catalysts from the Si surface. Herein, a highly efficient and stable Si photocathode is reported by utilizing the oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni(OH)2 nanosheet as a multifunctional layer to bridge the Ir catalyst and Ni protected Si photocathode. Both experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that this Ni(OH)2 layer can not only effectively capture and stabilize atomic Ir via the newly formed O–Ir–O bonds, but also significantly enhance the reaction kinetics by accelerating charge and mass transport and reducing the energy barriers of both the Volmer and Tafel steps. This study offers an economic and efficient route for engineering the high performance PEC devices.

Introduction
Solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting offers a promising approach to directly convert the intermittent solar energy into sustainable and storable hydrogen fuels.1,2 A major barrier to solar energy conversion via the PEC approach is the lack of highly active, durable and economic photocathodes.3,4 As an essential component in semiconductor technology and photovoltaic application, silicon (Si) has also emerged as a promising photocathode for PEC water splitting, due to its attractive features including relatively low bandgap (∼1.12 eV) with efficient light absorption and suitable band position for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).5–8 Nonetheless, the severe charge recombination and sluggish HER kinetics seriously restrict its PEC performance.9–11 To overcome these bottlenecks, there is a great demand to rationally design and integrate the co-catalyst layer with Si efficiently.12,13
Since the demonstration of a single-crystal n+p-Si photocathode with evaporated platinum catalyst by Boettcher et al.,14 tremendous progress has been made on Si photocathodes in terms of efficiency and durability, and an acidic medium is generally a prerequisite to produce hydrogen with high efficiency.15–17 However, on a device level, the photocathode and photoanode working as a pair are more preferred in the alkaline electrolytes from the viewpoint of environmental accountability and sustainability.18 Unfortunately, designing high-performance Si photocathodes for the HER under alkaline conditions still remains a grand challenge and only limited successes have been made to date.19,20 Typically, Kast et al. demonstrated an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 10.9% by decorating a TiO2 protective layer and 2 nm iridium (Ir) catalyst layer onto a Si photocathode.21 However, it failed after 48 h, due to the dissolution or exfoliation of catalyst from the Si surface. One way to conquer this issue is to anchor atomically dispersed metals with a suitable support, which can not only decrease the dosage of noble metals but also improve the catalytic activity and stability due to the strong metal–support interactions.22–24 For example, atomic-scale ruthenium (Ru) embedded into phosphorus nitride imide nanotubes via forming a strong Ru–N bond may help to improve the stability of Ru while endowing it as a highly active electrocatalyst for the HER.25 By comparing the experimentally measured and theoretically calculated volcano relationships for the HER, Ir is known to be a promising candidate for the HER because it sits very near the vertex of both volcanoes (Sabatier principle).26,27 Despite great promise, no attempt has been made to apply atomically dispersed Ir to the modified Si photocathodes, and the exploration of an interlayer between atomically dispersed Ir and Si photocathodes would be of particular interest.
Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is believed to be a great support for noble metal catalysts because of its abundance in the earth's crust, unique layered structures, and outstanding compositional stability in a basic environment.25,28 The transition metal Ni in the laminate bridged by the oxygen of hydroxy can provide special anchoring sites for the supported noble metal atoms.29 In addition, it can synergistically enhance the HER activity of noble metals in alkaline media by contributing active sites to cleave H–OH bonds.28,30 Furthermore, its attractive two-dimensional lamellar structure is favourable for charge and mass transfer by accelerating the diffusion of water molecules and the release of gaseous products.31,32 Recently, many researchers have reported that the defects in oxides such as vacancies, reconstructed defects, and doped non-metal (or metal)-defects can alter the electronic structures and serve as docking sites to capture and stabilize heteroatoms to form a new synergetic coordination structure, thus presenting great promise to achieve high HER activity.33 However, to the best of our knowledge, the interplay between the atomically dispersed Ir and the oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni(OH)2 is lacking, which may serve as an effective combination to catalyze and stabilize a Si photocathode.
Herein, an oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni(OH)2 (denoted as r-Ni(OH)2) nanosheet layer synthesized by a facile atmospheric solvothermal method and subsequent reductive treatment has been studied as a multifunctional layer between the Ir catalyst and Ni protected Si photocathode. The combined analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping reveals that the r-Ni(OH)2 layer has significant impact on pushing the Ir catalyst into an atomic scale. In addition, strong electronic interactions between Ir and r-Ni(OH)2 are elucidated through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the r-Ni(OH)2 layer can provide special anchoring sites to effectively capture and stabilize atomic Ir via the newly formed O–Ir–O bonds, and the interface of Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 is highly favorable for charge carrier extraction. More importantly, the combination of r-Ni(OH)2 and atomic Ir not only reduces the energy barriers of the dissociated water molecules, but also significantly optimizes the regulation of H adsorption energies, thereby accelerating the HER process in alkaline media. As a result, the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathode exhibits excellent PEC performance in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, including a benchmarking ABPE of 12.4% and a sustainable stability of more than 300 h under AM 1.5G one sun illumination. Such a superb PEC capability outperforms all the previously reported Si photocathodes working in alkaline media.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the stepwise synthetic procedures of Ir-based Si photocathodes integrated with and without an interlayer of Ni(OH)2 or r-Ni(OH)2. All the photocathodes are constructed on n-type single-crystal and micro-pyramid textured Si with a surface n+n junction and a rear p+n junction, which was produced according to the procedure in the Experimental Section and our previous reports.19,34 A conformal and uniform Ni film was fabricated on the Si surface via electron beam (E-beam) evaporation (denoted as Ni/Si),34 serving as both the protection layer for Si and the adhesion layer for the following Ir-based catalysts. Subsequently, an r-Ni(OH)2 layer was prepared by a facile atmospheric solvothermal method on Ni/Si, followed by a chemical reduction with NaBH4 to in situ convert to r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si. Finally, Ir was integrated on the r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si by an electrodeposition process, forming Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si (additional details are provided in the Experimental Section).35 To investigate the virtue of the r-Ni(OH)2 interlayer, Ir was also deposited on Ni/Si and Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si as control samples, denoted as Ir/Ni/Si and Ir/Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si, respectively.

The aggregated nanoparticles are observed once Ir is directly deposited onto the surface of Ni/Si (Fig. S1, ESI†). The SEM images of Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si indicate that two-dimensional (2D) interconnected Ni(OH)2 nanosheets with a planar size of 50–200 nm are uniformly grown on the micro-pyramid Si substrate (Fig. S2, ESI†). After NaBH4 treatment, the size and morphology of r-Ni(OH)2 are barely changed (Fig. S3, ESI†). We note that the Ir deposition onto both Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2 maintains the overall nanosheet morphology (Fig. 1a and Fig. S4, S5, ESI†). In sharp contrast to that of the Ir/Ni/Si sample, no local aggregation of Ir species can be observed, revealing that Ni(OH)2 can be an ideal interlayer to prevent their aggregation during electrochemical deposition. Fig. 1b discloses the cross-sectional features of Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si. The thickness of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets is ∼160 nm, which can be observed more clearly in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The cross-sectional TEM image in Fig. 1c manifests the vertically aligned r-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets on the underlying Ni/Si, consistent with the observation of SEM. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Fig. 1c) exhibits perfect hexagonally arranged diffraction spots, which can be readily indexed as the 2D in-plane reflection with the [100] crystal planes of Ni(OH)2.36 This result confirms that the 2D structure of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets was well maintained after the NaBH4 treatment and the deposition of Ir. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1d clearly illustrates that there are three layers at the device interface. The top layer vertically aligned on the electrode surface exhibits a layered structure with a characteristic layer-to-layer distance of 0.47 nm, slightly larger than the (001) plane of hexagonal β-Ni(OH)2 (d = 0.460 nm). Besides, small and homogeneously distributed dots with sizes of ∼0.5 nm are also detected, indicating the existence of atomic-level Ir anchored onto r-Ni(OH)2 (Fig. 1e). Notably, distinct crystalline phases with lattice distortions (denoted by yellow circles) are observed in the HRTEM image of r-Ni(OH)2, confirming the presence of numerous dangling bonds associated with the formation of abundant crystal defects.37,38 Such lattice distortions may provide more efficient anchor sites to directly couple Ir atoms, leading to fast reaction kinetics and excellent stability.39,40 Beneath the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 layer, there is a thin Ni layer evidenced by lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.204 nm, which can be indexed to the expected (111) plane of metal Ni (Fig. 1f). The Ni layer (∼12 nm) is quite uniform according to the high-resolution cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. S7 (ESI†), providing good contact between the catalyst and Si photocathode. Note that the contrast difference can be observed both in the Ni layer before and after the growth of the Ni(OH)2 layer, suggesting the contrast difference in the Ni layer may not be a sign of compositional and structural variations (Fig. S8, ESI†). In the upper right area of the HRTEM image, the spacing of lattice fringes measured at 0.321 nm is found to be equal to the Si lattice constant. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and the corresponding EDX mapping images (Fig. 1g) again confirmed the hierarchical structure of Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 and Ni layers on the Si surface. The TEM images and aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images of Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 and Ir/Ni(OH)2 peeled off from the sample surface further demonstrated that isolated Ir atoms were uniformly distributed on the r-Ni(OH)2 or Ni(OH)2 (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). The mass loadings of Ir on Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2 were determined by TEM EDX elemental mapping (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†). The Ir content on Ir/Ni(OH)2 and Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 was detected to be 2.33 and 1.34 wt%, respectively, which was also confirmed by repeating the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurement 5 times (Fig. S13 and Table S1, ESI†). These results strongly suggest the atomic-level Ir has been homogeneously integrated on the surface of Ni/Si due to the existence of the Ni(OH)2 or r-Ni(OH)2 interlayer.

To characterize the detailed structural information of Ir-based catalysts, XRD, Raman, EPR and XPS were systematically conducted using the sample deposited on a Ni foam support. When Ir is directly deposited on Ni, the XRD pattern shows no other peaks apart those from Ni, suggesting that Ir is in an amorphous state or present limited long-range order (Fig. S14, ESI†). After coating a Ni(OH)2 layer, the electrode exhibits a series of additional diffraction peaks, which are all in good agreement with the well-known hexagonal β-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS card no. 14-0117). After NaBH4 reductive treatment, the r-Ni(OH)2 sample shows similar diffraction patterns as pristine Ni(OH)2, however, the (001) peak shifts slightly to a lower value by ∼0.3° with reduced peak intensity (Fig. 2a). This variation in XRD patterns implies that NaBH4 reductive treatment contributes to a disordered structure with oxygen defects and a lattice expansion of the Ni(OH)2 layers along the [00l] direction. This is consistent with the TEM and SEM results. After anchoring Ir on Ni(OH)2 or r-Ni(OH)2, no extra diffraction peaks emerge, implying Ir in such cases is still in an amorphous state or present limited long-range order.

Raman spectroscopy was performed to obtain information about the chemical identities of these samples (Fig. 2b). After the direct loading of Ir on Ni, a Raman peak can be monitored at 545 cm−1 (Fig. S15, ESI†), corresponding to the typical Ir–O vibration.41 Three sharp Raman peaks are observed at 308, 445 and 3580 cm−1 for the Ni(OH)2 decorated electrode, which can be exclusively indexed to an E-type vibration of the Ni–OH lattice, the Ni–O stretch and the symmetric stretching of the O–H band in the β-Ni(OH)2, respectively.42,43 After NaBH4 reductive treatment, the Raman response of the O–H band becomes clearly weaker, suggesting the relatively poor crystallinity of r-Ni(OH)2.44 Furthermore, an extra peak located at 522 cm−1 emerges, which can be best indexed to defective or disordered Ni(OH)2.43,45 After anchoring Ir on Ni(OH)2 or r-Ni(OH)2, the Ir related Raman signal is not observed, indicating that atomic-level Ir is too small to be detected.46 It is worth noting that the Raman feature at 522 cm−1 for the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 sample has almost disappeared, referring to strong interactions between Ir and oxygen defect sites in the r-Ni(OH)2. In addition, both Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2 exhibit a weaker Raman feature at 3580 cm−1 after the deposition of Ir. Such variation implies a reduction in the crystalline quality, which is consistent with the XRD results. The increased density of oxygen defects in r-Ni(OH)2 is confirmed by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, where the EPR signal measured at g = 2.003 can be identified as electrons trapped in oxygen vacancies (OVs).38,40 As shown in Fig. 2c, the r-Ni(OH)2 exhibits a much stronger EPR signal than that of the pristine one, revealing that the OVs in the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet are introduced by NaBH4 reductive treatment. Furthermore, the EPR signals of the above two samples are attenuated after the incorporation of Ir, suggesting the electrochemical process during Ir deposition contributes to the reduction of OVs. Specifically, the OVs in r-Ni(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 are reduced by 10.4% and 6.8% respectively after the incorporation of Ir, according to the calculated EPR areas (Fig. S16, ESI†).
The XPS measurements were carried out to gain insight into the chemical and electronic states of O, Ni and Ir for various samples. The survey spectrum reveals the presence of Ni, Ir and O signals, which is consistent with the EDX and ICP-AES results (Fig. S17, ESI†). Fig. 2d shows the XPS O 1s spectra, which can be deconvoluted into three peaks: lattice oxygen (M–O) at 530.8 eV, oxygen loss with low oxygen coordination (OVs) at 531.7 eV and adsorbed oxygen in water (Oabs) at 533.2eV.47,48 Note that the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the three peaks are all controlled to less than 2 eV to make the fitting reasonable (Table S2, ESI†). The OVs density can be estimated by taking the peak area of OVs to M–O, according to the previous reports.47,49 From Fig. 2d and Table S3 (ESI†), the OVs density in the r-Ni(OH)2 electrode is 82.8%, which is 1.4 times greater than that in the pristine one. After the incorporation of Ir, the OVs density in the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 decreases by 25.0%, which is obviously larger than that of Ir/Ni(OH)2 (18.6% decreasing). This trend in the change of OV density is quite consistent with the EPR results. In Fig. 2e, the high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum of pristine Ni(OH)2 can be well fitted by two Gaussian peaks with Ni2+ 2p3/2 at 855.7 and Ni2+ 2p1/2 at 873.4 eV, along with two satellites, which are characteristic of Ni(OH)2.50 After NaBH4 treatment, there is a small peak shift in the Ni 2p spectrum toward lower binding energies, suggesting a decrease in the oxidation state of Ni.51 Compared with the Ni 2p spectra of Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2 with and without Ir, one could find that there is no difference for the Ni(OH)2 sample while the Ni 2p spectrum of the r-Ni(OH) is positively shifted by around 0.7 eV after Ir incorporating, suggesting the chemical environment of Ni ions in r-Ni(OH)2 was more liable to be modified by Ir in comparison with that in Ni(OH)2. In the Ir 4f region, the high-resolution Ir 4f spectrum of Ir on Ni/Si can be split into four peaks at 61.9, 62.4, 63.8 and 65.1 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of Ir3+ 4f7/2, Ir4+ 4f7/2, Ir3+ 4f5/2 and Ir4+ 4f5/2, respectively (Fig. S18, ESI†),52,53 indicating that Ir4+ and Ir3+ coexist and Ir4+ is dominant. The Ir/Ni(OH)2 shows a similar Ir 4f spectrum as the Ir/Ni sample, however, the Ir 4f spectrum clearly shifts to lower binding energies, suggesting that the Ir species on the surface of r-Ni(OH)2 are mainly at the 0 valence state (Fig. 2f). Generally, a decrease in the valence electron charge leads to an increase in binding energy, whereas an increase of valence electron charge results in a decrease in binding energy.54 Therefore, the opposite shift of the binding energy for the Ni 2p and Ir 4f suggests the existence of strong electronic interactions between r-Ni(OH)2 and Ir species, which is beneficial for the charge transfer. Although errors may be introduced by the ex situ XPS measurement due to the absorbed oxygen on the sample surface, our control experiments suggest that the adsorbed oxygen has no noticeable effect on the oxidation states of the sample (Fig. S19, ESI†). Furthermore, the presence of close interaction between r-Ni(OH)2 and Ir species is also responsible for the accelerated HER kinetics due to a synergistic effect, which will be demonstrated below.

Fig. 3a depicts the schematic representation and band energy diagram of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathode, in which a back-illuminated Si photoelectrode is used to spatially and functionally decouple optical absorption and catalytic activity.34,55,56 This design allows the catalyst layer to be sufficiently thick for more catalytically active sites without concerning the light-harvesting ability of the PEC device. This point can be confirmed by the UV-Vis reflectance spectra of various Si photocathodes (Fig. S20, ESI†). The PEC performance of the various Si photocathodes during water splitting was evaluated by recording linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in 1 M KOH solution (pH = 13.6). The onset potential (Von) is defined as the potential which drives the photocurrent density at −1 mA cm−2. In Fig. 3b, all the electrodes show negligible current under dark conditions. For the Ni/Si photocathode, a poor PEC performance is observed. The LSV curve right-shifts obviously after the deposition of the Ir catalyst. The optimal treating time by NaBH4 on Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si and the optimal loading amounts of Ir catalysts on Ni/Si, Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si and r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathodes for the HER were investigated in detail (Fig. S21–S24, ESI†). It is generally accepted that the efficiency of a photocathode can be defined by the maximum ABPE, adopting the equation: η(%) = |J0 × Von × FF|/Pin × 100%, where Pin is the incident optical power density (i.e., 100 mW cm−2), J0 is the photocurrent density at 0 VRHE and FF is the fill factor.34 From this equation all three parameters (J0, Von and FF) are critical to design a highly efficient Si photocathode, therefore these parameters are compared in Table S4 (ESI†). Notably, the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si exhibits the best PEC performance with a high J0 of −42 mA cm−2, Von of 0.56 VRHE and FF of 0.53. Correspondingly, an unprecedented ABPE of 12.4% was obtained for the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathode (Fig. 3c), which is the highest reported value for Si homojunction based photocathodes under alkaline conditions. We note that this value is also superior to most of the previously reported Si photocathodes working under acid conditions, even if the most effective HER catalyst Pt was used (Fig. 3d and Table S5, ESI†). Moreover, the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathode shows a nearly unity faradaic efficiency when measured at 0 VRHE in 1 M KOH solution under simulated AM1.5G one sun illumination over a 5 h period, verifying that most of the photogenerated charges are consumed for the HER (Fig. 3e).

(f) Chronoamperometic current versus time (j–t) curves of various Si photocathodes measured at 0 VRHE under simulated AM1.5G one sun illumination in 1 M KOH. 
In addition to high efficiency, long-term catalytic durability is also a major concern for large-scale practical applications. The stability of all the photocathodes was evaluated by a chronoamperometry test at the maximum photocurrent density in 1 M KOH under simulated AM1.5G one sun illumination. As illustrated in Fig. 3f, the Ir/Ni/Si sample experiences a dramatic decrease in photocurrent only after 4 h of testing, consistent with the corresponding LSV curve recorded after the stability test (Fig. S25a, ESI†). This poor stability is derived from the dissolution/exfoliation of Ir in a strongly alkaline solution, as confirmed by the SEM images (Fig. S25b and c, ESI†). The introduction of the Ni(OH)2 interlayer plays an essential role in improving the stability of the photocathode, because the Ir/Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathode shows an enhanced long-term stability of about 170 h operation. Although its photocurrent begins to drop after 170 h, the surface morphology remains virtually the same as compared to the one before the experiments, indicating superior stability and good adhesion of the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet structure on the Ni protected Si surface (Fig. S26, ESI†). We found that the photocurrent degeneration is due to the Ir catalyst leaving the Si photocathode during the durability test, as confirmed by XPS survey scans (Fig. S27 and Table S6, ESI†). To investigate the role of Ni(OH)2 on the stability of the Ir/Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathode, the PEC long-term stability of the Ni/Si photocathode as a control experiment was evaluated, which showed no noticeable decay in photocurrent density for a duration of 300 h (Fig. S28, ESI†), suggesting that the dense Ni layer has a strong ability to prevent corrosive ions from damaging the Si electrode. Note that it is difficult to judge whether the Ni(OH)2 layer helps to prevent corrosive ions from damaging the Si electrode, since it is difficult for the same Ni(OH)2 layer to grow directly onto the Si surface. Notably, the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathode is able to maintain a high photocurrent density of >40 mA cm−2 with negligible decay for a testing duration of 300 h. Fig. S29 (ESI†) shows almost an identical surface morphology and LSV curves before and after the test. Furthermore, the morphology of the Ni(OH)2 remained virtually the same compared to those before the 300 h duration test (Fig. S30, ESI†), suggesting both Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2 showed good adhesion with the Si substrate. Moreover the XRD pattern of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si is also well retained after the 300 h stability test (Fig. S31, ESI†). These results manifest that the r-Ni(OH)2 interlayer endows not only high chemical stability against corrosion and good adhesion with the Si substrate but also serves as a docking site to capture and stabilize the atomic-level Ir due to the strong metal-support interactions at the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 interface.
To understand the evidently enhanced PEC performance of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si photocathode, the HER electrocatalytic performances were evaluated and compared with the other two control samples in 1.0 M KOH solution with a three-electrode cell system, using the Ni layer as the bottom electrode.19,34 Bare Ni(OH)2 resulted in poor HER activity with an overpotential of 263 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, while r-Ni(OH)2 exhibits a slight improvement in HER activity (Fig. S32, ESI†). The optimal loading amounts of Ir, Ni, Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2 for HER electrocatalytic activity are presented in Fig. S33–S35 (ESI†). The HER polarization curves in Fig. 4a clearly show that the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 has superior HER activity with a very small overpotential of 34 mV at −10 mA cm−2, much lower than those of Ir (83 mV) and Ir/Ni(OH)2 (53 mV). The corresponding Tafel plots show the consistent enhancement of HER kinetics, as shown in Fig. 4b. The Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 catalyst displays a low Tafel slope of 31.7 mV dec−1, significantly superior to that of Ir (68.5 mV dec−1) and Ir/Ni(OH)2 (55.2 mV dec−1), demonstrating a fast increase in the hydrogen generation rate.23 To provide more insights in the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ir/r-Ni(OH)2, electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) were measured and then the HER activities were normalized by the corresponding ECSA values (Fig. S36 and S37, ESI†). From the ECSA normalized LSV curves shown in Fig. S38 (ESI†), the superiority of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 is still remarkable as compared to the Ir and Ir-Ni(OH)2. To determine the activity more accurately, the turnover frequency (TOF) of various catalysts recorded at −0.15 VRHE is shown in Fig. S39 (ESI†).57 Strikingly, the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 shows a high TOF of 2.04 s−1, which is much higher than that of Ir (0.53 s−1) and Ir/Ni(OH)2 (0.72 s−1). These experimental results reveal that the excellent HER performance of Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 can be attributed to its intrinsic activity, which will be demonstrated by DFT calculations below.

Generally, there are three major processes that are involved in a complete PEC water splitting reaction: (I) light absorption; (II) charge carrier separation and transportation and (III) surface redox reactions, among which (II) is also a key factor for efficient PEC devices.58 In this regard, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted in 1 M KOH under simulated AM1.5G one sun illumination at a bias of 0.20 VRHE (Fig. 4c). Nyquist plots of various Si photocathodes were fitted using the equivalent circuit commonly employed for similar catalyst–semiconductor systems,59,60 which consists of a series resistance of the whole circuit (Rs), an Rct1–CPE1 pair associated with the charge transfer process at the interface between Si and various catalysts, and an Rct2–CPE2 pair related to the charge transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interface (Fig. S40, ESI†). The charge-transfer resistances with other parameters obtained from the fittings are summarized in Table S7 (ESI†). The charge transfer resistance Rct1 across the Si/catalysts interface for the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si sample (0.79 Ω) is comparable to that of the Ir/Ni/Si (0.85 Ω), indicating good coupling between the light absorber and the catalyst. Additionally, Rct2 from the catalyst to the electrolyte of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si (3.36 Ω) is dramatically lower than that of the Ir/Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si (23.18 Ω) and the Ir/Ni/Si (46.80 Ω), confirming the highly efficient charge extraction at the electrode/electrolyte interface and further proving that Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 is indeed much more catalytically active toward the HER. To provide further insights into the charge behavior, Bode phase plot measurements were performed. Typically, a lower peak frequency in the Bode phase plots represents a longer electron lifetime.13,34 As shown in Fig. 4d, the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si sample exhibits a lower characteristic peak frequency (18.6 Hz) than the Ir/Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si (34.2 Hz) and Ir/Ni/Si (52.4 Hz), indicating the longer charge carrier lifetime for the photogenerated electron to be engaged in the HER process and therefore the PEC performance is improved.
Aside from the intrinsic properties, efficient charge carrier separation and transport also depend on the extrinsic properties of the electrodes, such as the surface wetting and gas removal properties.61 During the water-splitting process, especially at high current densities, the access of electrolytes and significant gas bubble generation on the electrode surface are big concerns. A high level of bubble coverage on electrodes would pose a barrier between the electrolyte and catalysts, resulting in a decreased effective surface area and high ionic diffusion resistance.32 To identify the surface wettability of various Si photocathodes, water contact-angle measurements were obtained and are shown in Fig. 4e and Fig. S41 (ESI†). The water contact angle for the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si sample was measured as 17.9°, much smaller than those of the Ir/Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si (50.5°) and Ir/Ni/Si (93.2°), thus demonstrating the hydrophilic properties of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si sample. Moreover, the gas evolution reaction during the PEC process was recorded by a high-speed camera to compare the size distribution of bubbles for various Si photocathodes (Fig. 4f and Fig. S42, ESI†). It was reported that the size of gas bubbles nucleated on the active sites grows following a direct injection model, and bubble removal in a small diameter was beneficial to suppress gas bubble coalescence, jamming, and trapping, resulting in fast bubble release.32,62 The digital photographs show the average diameters of hydrogen gas bubbles escaped from the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si and Ir/Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si were 26 μm (±8 μm) and 56 μm (± 8 μm), much smaller than that released from the Ir/Ni/Si (202 μm (±83 μm)). This feature suggests that the r-Ni(OH)2 interlayer contributes to an exceptionally low contact region between the bubbles and the surface of the electrode, leading to the rapid release of gas bubbles.
To elucidate the synergy between Ir and r-Ni(OH)2 for an enhanced PEC performance at the atomic level, systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The as-built models for Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2 were provided in Fig. S43 (ESI†). Fig. 5a shows the optimized configurations of Ir atom adsorption on the Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2, respectively. It was found that the Ir atom is adsorbed on the surface of the Ni(OH)2 by forming a single Ir–O bond. In contrast, there are strong interactions between the Ir atom and r-Ni(OH)2, with three O atoms strongly binding to the Ir atom. In addition, the adsorption energy for the Ir atom on r-Ni(OH)2 is calculated to be 0.63 eV, which is much smaller than that on the Ni(OH)2 (3.53 eV), supporting the fact that the Ir atom can be effectively captured and stabilized by r-Ni(OH)2via the newly formed O–Ir–O bond. This result agrees well with the long-term catalytic durability measurements that the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si electrode shows better stability as compared to the Ir/Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si. To further investigate the detailed bonding interaction between the Ir atom and Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2, the differential charge density was examined, as shown in Fig. 5b. Cyan and yellow regions indicate electronic charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. For both Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2, notable electron accumulation near the Ir atom and the bonded O atoms and electron depletion around the adjacent Ni atoms are displayed after coupling the Ir atom. Especially, a locally enhanced electric field around the Ir site was generated on the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2, which is more intensive than that of Ir/Ni(OH)2, suggesting electrons in r-Ni(OH)2 are more prone to move to the bonded Ir atom.63 This demonstrates an ideal electron-migration channel for highly efficient charge carrier extraction in the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2/Ni/Si heterostructure, due to the suitable electronic properties of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2, as well as the excellent geometric-matching structure as indicated above.

(b) Differential charge density of Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2 after the loading of Ir atom. Iso-surface contours of the electron density differences were drawn at 0.3 e Bohr−3. (c) Calculated Gibbs free energy diagrams for alkaline HER on Ir/Ni(OH)2 and Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 surfaces. The blue, gray, pink and red spheres represent Ir, Ni, H and O atoms, respectively. 
In principle, the reaction pathway for a HER process in alkaline media involves four steps: the initial catalyst–H2O contact step, the H2O dissociation (or Volmer) step, the formation of H* intermediates step, and the H2 generation (Tafel or Heyrovsky) step.64 The free energy differences between the first and second steps, ΔG(H2O), and between the third and fourth steps, ΔG(H*) are widely considered useful for understanding the HER catalytic activity.65 Of all possible catalytic sites for the HER on Ni(OH)2 and r-Ni(OH)2, it is the Ni atoms that exhibit the highest activity (Fig. S44 and S45, ESI†). Meanwhile, in the case of Ir loaded samples, Ir atoms are more attractive sites for the HER (Fig. S46 and S47, ESI†). Fig. 5c shows the calculated Gibbs free energy diagrams on the surface of the above catalysts. Ni(OH)2 exhibits a very high ΔG(H2O) up to 1.65 eV, which significantly hinders the dissociation of H2O to H* intermediates and leads to sluggish HER kinetics. NaBH4 reductive treatment and loading of Ir can dramatically decrease the ΔG(H2O) value in the order of: r-Ni(OH)2 (ΔG(H2O) = 1.21 eV) < Ir/Ni(OH)2 (ΔG(H2O) = 0.53 eV) < Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 (ΔG(H2O) = −0.006 eV). The greatly reduced ΔG(H2O) value on Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 suggests that the kinetics of the initial water dissociation step can be effectively promoted after the NaBH4 reductive treatment and loading of Ir. Turning to the energy barrier of H2 generation, the ΔG(H*) is 0.33 eV for Ni(OH)2, and −0.2 eV for the r-Ni(OH)2. After the loading of Ir, Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 demonstrates a ΔG(H*) of 0.22 eV, which is much lower than that of 0.83 eV for Ir/Ni(OH)2. To clarify the advantages of atomic-level Ir, the intrinsic HER activity and DFT calculations of the Ir nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on r-Ni(OH)2 (denoted as Ir NPs/r-Ni(OH)2) were also systematically implemented in comparison with those of the Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 (Fig. S48 and S49, ESI†). In general, these results indicate that the synergy of uniform Ir loading and oxygen defect incorporations in Ir/r-Ni(OH)2 not only reduces the kinetic energy barriers of the prior water dissociation, but also provides abundant active sites to promote H* desorption.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a Si photocathode for efficient and stable solar water splitting by using the oxygen-vacancy-rich r-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet as a novel multifunctional layer between the Ir catalyst and Ni protected Si. The combination of experimental investigations and DFT calculations revealed that the r-Ni(OH)2 layer not only provides abundant active sites for the HER by tailoring the electrodeposited Ir catalyst to the atomic scale, but also significantly enhances the reaction kinetics by accelerating charge transport and reducing the energy barriers of both the Volmer and Tafel steps. These multifunctional features endow the Si photocathode with an extraordinary PEC performance. An impressive photocurrent density of −42 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE, a large onset potential of 0.56 VRHE, and an unprecedented ABPE of 12.4% are obtained in alkaline media under simulated AM 1.5G one sun illumination, making it one of the most efficient Si photocathodes reported to date. It is surprising to find that the atomic-level Ir is able to be effectively anchored and stabilized on the r-Ni(OH)2 layer via the formation of O–Ir–O bonds, enabling the photocathode to operate at a high photocurrent density of about −40 mA cm−2 for up to 300 h without obvious degradation. These strategies provide a scalable platform for engineering highly efficient and stable solar fuel devices and systems.

Broader context
Hydrogen generation through solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting provides a carbon-neutral alternative to solve the impending energy and environmental crisis. Although silicon (Si)-based photocathodes hold great perspective for PEC water splitting, the sluggish HER kinetics on the Si surface seriously impedes the PEC performance. Considerable efforts have been therefore devoted to functionalize the Si photocathodes with an appropriate co-catalyst, for example, noble metal catalysts. Unfortunately, the direct loading of noble metal catalysts on Si gives rise to unsatisfactory PEC performance, primarily due to the facile aggregation of noble metal catalysts and exfoliation of catalysts from the Si surface. Herein, a highly efficient and stable Si photocathode is reported by utilizing the oxygen-vacancy-rich Ni(OH)2 nanosheet as a multifunctional layer to bridge the Ir catalyst and Ni protected Si photocathode. Both experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that this Ni(OH)2 layer can not only effectively capture and stabilize atomic Ir via the newly formed O–Ir–O bonds, but also significantly enhance the reaction kinetics by accelerating charge and mass transport and reducing the energy barriers of both the Volmer and Tafel steps. This study offers an economic and efficient route for engineering the high performance PEC devices.
