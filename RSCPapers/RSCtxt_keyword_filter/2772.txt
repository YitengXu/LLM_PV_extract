    , Accepted 3rd January 2018First published on 4th January 2018AbstractIn this work, we present a structurally defined blue-shift non-fullerene electron acceptor (ITCT) matching with PTB7-Th as the electron donor for high-performance fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs). The PTB7-Th/ITCT blend based bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices give an appreciable PCE of 8.23% and a relatively high VOC of 0.96 V without any optimization. Upon device processing with thermal annealing and the addition of 0.1% DIO additive, the active layer achieves a more ordered and crystalline morphology. Consequently, a high PCE of 10.42% has been achieved with a VOC of 0.95 V, a JSC of 15.13 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 0.72. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 10.42% is among the highest values reported in the literature to date for non-fullerene PSCs using PTB7-Th as the electron donor.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structures1 have achieved impressive progress as a promising technology to harvest solar energy. Generally, the BHJ active layer that converts light into electricity consists of an electron donor and an electron acceptor. Several features of the active layer are essential for obtaining high-performance PSCs, which include balanced and high mobilities (hole mobility and electron mobility),2,3 an appropriate alignment of molecular energy levels to improve charge separation,4 a favourable bi-continuous phase-separated morphology to facilitate charge diffusion,5,6 and a strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) region of the solar spectrum to minimize optical loss.7–9 In the past two decades, researchers have focused on high-performance PSCs using blends of new electron donors and fullerene derived electron acceptors.10–13 Typically, the combination of PTB7-Th as a low bandgap polymer donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor has been employed as the workhorse for high-efficiency PSCs.14,15 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PTB7-Th based fullerene solar cells have surpassed 10% (ref. 14) and occupied the efficiency record in the literature of PSCs for a long time. PTB7-Th/fullerene device systems have been extensively explored for a deep understanding of the principles and mechanisms of PSCs. Meanwhile, various molecular design strategies have been devised to optimize polymer donors using PTB7-Th as a reference. 16–19 Consequently, many high quality narrow bandgap polymer donors have been exploited and the PCEs of fullerene based PSCs have been pushed up to 11.7%.13 However, further progress in fullerene derivative based PSCs is challenging because of their limited tunability in energy levels, weak absorption in the vis-NIR region and intrinsically large energy loss (usually ∼0.7 eV).
Recently, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (SMAs) have emerged as promising alternatives due to the super tunability of their molecular energy levels and absorption spectra region. The PCEs of fullerene-free solar cells have exceeded 13.1% (ref. 20) in a relatively short period, surpassing the best results of their fullerene counterparts (11.7%). Generally, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives and fused-ring cored SMAs with the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone architecture are two families of the most efficient non-fullerene acceptors. PDI derivatives show advantages of high electron mobility and high electron affinity, and PCEs over 9.5% have been reported for PDI-based PSCs.21–25 For instance, a porphyrin cored PDI acceptor (PDI-Por) has been recently reported to boost the PCE of PBDB-T to 7.4%, which is the highest photovoltaic performance with porphyrin based SMAs.26 Meanwhile, A–D–A structured non-fullerene SMAs exhibit great superiority in fine-tuning their energy levels and absorption region.27–30 Great solubility, compatibility and moderate crystallinity can be easily achieved by manipulating alkyl chains and the rigidity of the conjugated backbone.31–39 The remarkable molecular ITIC,32 as the first non-fullerene acceptor breaking the PCE of 10%, has attracted a lot of attention and significantly promoted the development of PSCs.40 When introducing conjugated side chains onto the backbone of the fused ring structured D units, the 2-dimensional ITIC acceptor (ITIC2) achieved extended conjugation and higher charge carrier mobility.41 The blend of FTAZ:ITIC2 contributed a PCE of 11.0% for PSCs. In pursuing high performance non-fullerene PSCs, photoactive polymer donors with quinoidal resonance structure, especially commercialized PTB7-Th, are widely used as the standard donor materials for the screening of new non-fullerene acceptors. When ITIC was employed as the electron acceptor and using PTB7-Th as the electron donor, the resulting devices exhibited only low PCEs (6–7%), mainly attributed to existential high energy loss and overlapped optical absorption regions of the donor and acceptor.32
To further explore the potential of PTB7-Th as an electron donor in non-fullerene PSCs, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing novel non-fullerene SMAs for tuning the energy levels and broadening the absorption bands. Compared with the absorption of PTB7-Th (bandgap Eg = 1.58 eV), some red-shift or blue-shift SMAs have been developed. The resulting PTB7-Th devices have yielded outstanding photovoltaic performance with PCEs over 10%.9,42–44 For instance, Yao and Hou9 demonstrated a small molecule acceptor IEICO-4F with an ultra-narrow optical Eg of 1.24 eV. The devices using PTB7-Th as the electron donor exhibited a PCE of 9.7%, with JSC values over 22 mA cm−2 with a low energy loss of approximately 0.5 eV. The non-fullerene SMA SFBRCN with an Eoptg of 2.03 eV boosted the PCE of PTB7-Th based non-fullerene PSCs to 10.12%.43 Very recently, Ding et al. reported a narrow bandgap (1.26 eV) SMA called COi8DFIC with absorption extending to the near-infrared region, which boosts the PCE of PTB7-Th based non-fullerene PSCs to 12.16%.45 However, there is still a high demand for studies devoted to the optimization of PTB7-Th based non-fullerene PSCs.
Herein, we design and synthesize a non-fullerene acceptor (ITCT) (Fig. 1a) by introducing thienyl-fused indanone as the end group, which is a weaker electron withdrawing unit compared with the phenyl-fused indanone used in the compound of ITIC. Relative to ITIC, a lifted LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level and a larger bandgap can be predicted and demonstrated in our experiments. These properties of ITCT could be beneficial for achieving high open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC) with enhanced photovoltaic performance in PSCs when employing PTB7-Th as the electron donor. Almost at the same time when we prepared this paper, we noticed that Yao and Hou46 synthesized the same SMA (named ITCC) using a different approach and achieved an outstanding photovoltaic performance with PBDB-T as the electron donor.

In this work, we have scientifically demonstrated the photovoltaic properties of non-fullerene PSCs with a combination of PTB7-Th as the electron donor and blue-shift ITCT as the non-fullerene electron acceptor (device structure in Fig. 1b). All the devices show a relatively high VOC of about 0.96 V. After elaborative device optimization including the D/A ratio, thermal annealing and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive, more ordered and crystalline morphologies of the BHJ films can be induced. Consequently, the devices exhibited a high VOC of 0.95 V, a JSC of 15.13 mA cm−2 and an outstanding fill factor (FF) of 0.72, delivering a PCE of 10.42%, which is the highest value reported in the literature to date for non-fullerene PSCs using PTB7-Th as the electron donor.
The detailed synthetic procedure is shown in Scheme 1, with detailed characterizations summarized in the ESI (ESI, Fig. S1–S5†). In our synthesis of the A unit (TDO-CN) via Michael addition of 4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophene-4,6(5H)-dione (TDO) with malononitrile,47 two isomers were observed. The isomer with the carboxyl group and S atom of thiophene on the same side was assigned as βTDO-CN, while the other as αTDO-CN.

We carefully conducted 1H NMR and mass characterization as well as theoretical simulation to reveal this isomerization phenomenon (Fig. 2). The molar ratio between βTDO-CN and αTDO-CN was estimated to be 8.3:1 according to the NMR study (Fig. 2a and b). The chemical shift values of H atoms at the 3′ position of βTDO-CN shift to a low field compared with those of αTDO-CN attributed to the stronger electron withdrawing dicyano group. This agrees well with the DFT calculation of NMR spectra (with TMS as a reference) using the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) method (Fig. 2c and d). It should be noted that αTDO-CN tends to deteriorate within a week when exposed to heat and light, while βTDO-CN is stable during storage in both solid and solutions. The lower total energy of βTDO-CN also confirms its higher stability in comparison to its counterpart. The Knoevenagel condensation between βTDO-CN and the ladder-type D core generated ITCT as a new SMA.42ITCT shows good thermal stability (Td = 346 °C for 5% weight loss) in TGA analysis (Fig. S6, ESI†) and high solubility in common solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene.

UV-vis absorption spectra of PTB7-Th and ITCT were measured in the thin film state and are shown in Fig. 1c. The maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of the ITCT thin film exhibited a slight blue-shift of 44 nm as compared to that of PTB7-Th. The enhanced complementary absorption region of the PTB7-Th/ITCT film is beneficial to harvest more light and results in an increased JSC of the relevant PSCs. The electrochemical properties of ITCT were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S7, ESI†) and the energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 1d.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the PTB7-Th/ITCT system, PSC devices with an inverted configuration of ITO (indium tin oxide)/ZnO/PFN/BHJ active layer/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 1b) were fabricated.43,47,49 The detailed device fabrication conditions are described in the ESI.† Characteristics of the devices were investigated by measuring the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves under irradiation of AM 1.5G using a 100 mW cm−2 solar simulator. After optimization of PTB7-Th:ITCT weight ratios, solvent additive and thermal annealing (Fig. S8–12 and Tables S1–S5, ESI†), the optimized blend films with a thickness of 110 nm were processed by spin-coating from a warm solution of PTB7-Th:ITCT (40 °C, 1:2 weight ratio, 15 mg mL−1 in total weight concentration) in chloroform with 0.1% DIO additive and thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 minutes.
The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The initial solar cell without any post-treatment gives an appreciable PCE of 8.23% with a relatively high VOC of 0.96 V, a JSC of 13.61 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.63. Compared with the photovoltaic parameters of high-performance PTB7-Th based fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs in the literature50,51 (Fig. 3a, b, 4a–d, and Table S6 in the ESI†), the impressive VOC (0.96 V) of PTB7-Th/ITCT based devices demonstrates a smaller energy loss (∼0.63). When a trace amount of DIO (0.1%, v/v) is applied as the processing additive and the solution is heated to 40 °C, the PCE value increases to 9.22% with an increased JSC and a higher FF. After thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 minutes, the efficiencies of PTB7-Th/ITCT based devices can be further improved to 10.42%, with a VOC of 0.95 V, a comparable JSC of 15.13 mA cm−2 and an impressive FF of 0.72. The improved performance is mainly ascribed to the increased JSC and FF after DIO additive and thermal annealing processes. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4a. External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 4b. According to the EQE curve of the optimal device, the integrated JSC value is calculated to be 14.95 mA cm−2, which agrees well with the value obtained from the J–V curves (within 3% mismatch), validating the accuracy of the measurements and the results. The efficiency of 10.42% is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art PSCs based on PTB7-Th as the electron donor (Tables 1 and S6 in the ESI†).

To investigate the influence of DIO additive and thermal annealing (post-treatment), the charge-transporting behaviour of the studied devices (as cast and under optimal conditions) was determined by evaluating the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The detailed fabrications are summarized in the ESI and the results are shown in Fig. 3c and d. The hole and electron mobilities of the blend film without post-treatment are determined to be 1.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 2.25), respectively. After post-treatment with 0.1% DIO additive and thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 minutes, the hole and electron mobilities of the relative blend film are increased to 4.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.12), respectively. The higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities are induced after post-treatment, indicating better charge-transporting properties that can facilitate efficient exciton dissociation in devices.53 This could be responsible for the improved JSC and FF after post-treatment.
The photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff) and the dependence of JSC on illumination intensity (P0) were measured to comprehensively investigate the influence of post-treatment on the excition dissociation and charge extraction properties.54,55Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at the point of Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias. As shown in Fig. 4e, the Jph of the device with post-treatment increases dramatically at a low value of Veff and reaches its saturation (Jsat = 16.35 mA cm−2) at lower Veff = 1.7 V. The values of Jph/Jsat under the short-circuit and maximal power output conditions are 87% and 73%, 93% and 80% for the devices without and with post-treatment, respectively. The higher values of Jph/Jsat indicate that the device with post-treatment exhibits higher charge dissociation and more efficient charge extraction.
To further study the charge recombination behaviour of the devices, the variations of JSC as a function of illumination intensity (P0) were studied and modelled with the equation of JSC ∝ P0α, as shown in Fig. 4f. In principle, α will be close to 1 if the bimolecular recombination is negligible under the short-circuit conditions. As presented, the fitted slopes (α) for the relative solar cells are 0.89 and 0.96 for the devices without and with post-treatment, respectively. This result further affirms that strong bimolecular recombination can be suppressed in the blend film with post-treatment. Consequently, more efficient charge dissociation, charge extraction and reduced recombination result in its higher JSC and FF after post-treatment in the derived device.
In order to understand the reasons for the improved device performance with post-treatment, the morphological properties of the blend films without and with post-treatment are studied by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5, the PTB7-Th/ITCT blend film without post-treatment exhibits a smooth surface with a mean-square roughness (Rq) of 1.31 nm on the top morphology. And the PTB7-Th/ITCT blend film without post-treatment almost remained uniform in bulk without clear phase separation. After post-treatment, the PTB7-Th/ITCT blend film showed a smoother surface with a Rq of 0.87 nm which is beneficial for the ohmic contact interface between the BHJ active layer and MoO3 buffer layer. Besides, an enhanced crystallinity of the blend film is induced obviously, and an appropriate nanoscale phase separation occurs forming an optimized bi-continuous nanofibril-like network.

Based on the AFM and TEM observations, the bigger domain size of the blend film may be attributed to the self-assembly of ITCT in the solid film as well as strong aggregation effect in the solution state.40 Consistently, the photovoltaic performance of the devices is affected by the change in the temperature of the prefabricated solution for spin-coating (see Table S4, ESI†), suggesting that the aggregation effect of the non-fullerene small molecule acceptor in the blend film plays a critical role in phase-separation morphology. The fabrication of the PTB7-Th/ITCT devices from their hot mixture solutions at optimized temperature is based on two considerations as follows: (1) increasing the solubility of non-fullerene SMAs and therefore the miscibility of the donor/acceptor blend, (2) facilitating the π–π stacking of the donor and acceptor when transferring from the solution to the solid state. The morphology of the active layer can be further optimized by post-treatment of as-fabricated devices. The ordered and appropriate surface and bulk morphologies of the PTB7-Th/ITCT blend film with post-treatment are favourable for exciton separation, charge transport and charge extraction, resulting in an improved JSC and FF with a better photovoltaic performance in devices.56,57
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a new blue-shift ITIC non-fullerene acceptor with a defined molecular structure for high-performance PSCs. PSCs based on the blend of PTB7-Th/ITCT processed under different conditions were fabricated with an inverted configuration. All the devices show a high VOC of ∼0.96 V with smaller energy loss. The combination of PTB7-Th/ITCT exhibits a broad absorption with an appropriate alignment of molecular energy levels. After post-treatment, such as DIO additive and thermal annealing, a bi-continuous nanofibril-like network and crystalline morphology of the bulk-heterojunction film can be induced. The optimal BHJ solar cells based on PTB7-Th/ITCT delivered superior PCEs of 10.42% with a relatively high FF of 0.72, which is among the highest efficiencies for single-junction non-fullerene BHJ solar cells based on PTB7-Th. Our results also demonstrate that controlling the crystallinity of the non-fullerene small molecule acceptor is an effective method to rationally regulate the morphological evolution and its photovoltaic performance in non-fullerene polymer solar cells.
