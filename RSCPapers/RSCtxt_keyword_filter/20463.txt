    , Accepted 30th September 2015First published on 30th September 2015AbstractThe TiO2 layer made by electron beam (e-beam) induced evaporation is demonstrated as an electron transport layer (ETL) in high efficiency planar junction perovskite solar cells. The temperature of the substrate and the thickness of the TiO2 layer can be easily controlled with this e-beam induced evaporation method, which enables the usage of different types of substrates. Here, perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx achieve power conversion efficiencies of 14.6% on glass and 13.5% on flexible plastic substrates. The relationship between the TiO2 layer thickness and the perovskite morphology is studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Our results indicate that the pinholes in the thin TiO2 layer lead to pinholes in the perovskite layer. By optimizing the TiO2 thickness, perovskite layers with substantially increased surface coverage and reduced pinhole areas are fabricated, increasing overall device performance.
Introduction
Organometallic halide perovskite solar cells have attracted tremendous interest from both academia and industry. Within only a few years, an unprecedented certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.1% has been achieved for perovskite solar cells,1 which makes them one of the most promising thin film photovoltaic technologies.2,3 To date, most research groups have reported high efficiency perovskite solar cells employing a sol–gel or spray pyrolysis synthesized TiO2 compact ETL that needs to be annealed at very high temperatures (500 °C).4–10 The preparation of these sol–gel based TiO2 layers is, however, typically complicated and incompatible with the thermal budget of flexible plastic substrates.11
Efforts have been made to develop low temperature alternatives to high temperature sol–gel based TiO2 ETLs. For example, sol–gel prepared TiO2 nanoparticles have been developed as a replacement, reducing annealing temperatures to 150 °C.12,13 However, residual organic additives remain in these low temperature TiO2 layers.13 Moreover, 150 °C is still close to the maximum processing temperature of cheap plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is another promising alternative to get low temperature TiO2 layers, but the PCE values of perovskite solar cells with ALD TiO2 still need to be improved.14–17 Consequently, the development of high quality TiO2 layers processed at low temperatures is being ardently pursued.
The relatively low processing temperatures needed to form the perovskite crystal structure enable the use of organometallic halide perovskite in flexible thin film solar cells.14 Yet, there are few reports of flexible perovskite solar cells. Limited by the poor alternatives for the high temperature TiO2 ETL in the n–i–p structure, most flexible perovskite solar cells are based on a p–i–n structure with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the hole transport layer on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated substrates.18–21 However, PEDOT:PSS has proven detrimental to device stability in organic solar cells, due to its acidic and hygroscopic nature.22 To the best of our knowledge, solution processed ZnO nanoparticles and ALD synthesized TiO2 layers have been implemented in flexible perovskite solar cells with a n–i–p structure on flexible substrates, with the highest efficiencies of approximately 12%.14,15,23,24 More recently, a photonic curing technique was also used to achieve TiO2 layers at low processing temperatures on PET substrates, resulting in devices with a PCE of only 8.1%.25
In this work, TiO2 deposited by e-beam induced evaporation is examined as a compact ETL for perovskite solar cells. With this method, both the layer thickness and substrate temperature can be controlled. Deposited with neither additives nor annealing steps, the e-beam evaporated TiO2 can be used as prepared. Device efficiencies reach 14.6% with such TiO2 ETLs and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite photoactive layers. Moreover, we demonstrate flexible perovskite solar cells with PCE values of 13.5% on PET substrates using our e-beam evaporated TiO2 ETL, which are amongst the highest values for flexible perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussions
The optical properties of the e-beam TiO2 layer were evaluated before making the devices. Fig. 1a shows the results of the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) measured by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. The e-beam TiO2 layer is highly transparent in the visible to near infrared wavelength regions, which makes it a good candidate as an ETL in thin-film photovoltaic devices. The crystallinity of the e-beam TiO2 layer was checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and no diffraction peak is detected, indicating its amorphous nature (Fig. 1b).

To fabricate the perovskite solar cell, typically a 300 nm thick CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite layer was deposited on a 60 nm thick e-beam TiO2 layer. After annealing, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx shows a highly crystalline perovskite structure,26 as indicated by XRD patterns (Fig. 1b). To complete the device, doped poly(triaryl amine) PTAA was used as the hole transport layer and Au was used as the anode. Therefore, our devices have an architecture of ITO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PTAA/Au, as indicated by the cross-sectional SEM image of our typical device on a glass substrate (Fig. 2a).

The inset presents the quasi-steady state efficiency measured at the maximum power point voltage (0.72 V) over time. (c) The EQE of the device with the highest efficiency, peaking at 85%, and giving an integrated Jsc in AM1.5G of (19.5 mA cm−2). (d) A histogram of the efficiency values of 84 devices, with a mean efficiency of 13.2 ± 0.5%. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) plot of the highest efficiency device on a rigid glass substrate, measured from forward bias to reverse bias using a measurement speed of 1 V s−1, is shown in Fig. 2b. The device demonstrates an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.5 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 78%, giving a PCE of 14.6%. The Jsc calculated from the corresponding EQE curve is 19.5 mA cm−2, within 5% mismatch compared to the value measured from the J–V scan (Fig. 2c). The quasi-steady state efficiency of the device is measured by operating the device at the maximum power point voltage (0.72 V) as obtained from the J–V scan (inset, Fig. 2b). A rapid drop of the efficiency from 14.6% to 13% is observed within the first 15 seconds, likely due to the hysteresis effects observed in perovskite devices.27 The efficiency gradually stabilizes and reaches 12.8% after 10 minutes of operation. The histogram of the initial efficiency values of 84 devices displays a high yield (96%) of working devices (PCE > 11%) with a mean efficiency of 13.2 ± 0.5% (Fig. 2d), indicating that high efficiency perovskite solar cells are achievable on amorphous TiO2 layers.
To have more evaluation of the hysteresis of the devices made on e-beam TiO2, the J–V scan from different directions are shown in Fig. 3a. The reverse scan from 1 V to −0.5 V gives a higher efficiency of 13.9% than the efficiency (12.6%) of the forward scan from −0.5 V to 1 V, which is mainly due to the higher Voc and FF. Moreover, the same device was also measured with different J–V scan speeds. From Fig. 3b, we can find that the J–V curve and efficiency do not change much when the scan speed reduced from 1 V s−1 to 0.1 V s−1. However, if the scan speed is too slow, it starts to have significant effects and gives abnormal J–V curves. In this case, it will be difficult to extract the real photovoltaic parameters from the J–V curves. Therefore, we suggest using a relative high scan speed to find out the maximum power point and measure the stabilized efficiency around the maximum power point, in order to have a better evaluation of the device performance.

To verify the low temperature process of the e-beam TiO2, an irreversible temperature sensor strip was taped on the sample holder to detect the temperature of the samples during the e-beam induced evaporation. As shown in Fig. S1,† no change is observed on the temperature sensor, indicating that the temperature of the samples never exceeded the lowest detectable temperature (77 °C) for this type of temperature sensor. Such a low temperature budget of the whole stack (≤100 °C) enables the use of flexible plastic substrates. Perovskite solar cells with e-beam TiO2 reach high efficiencies of 13.5% on ITO coated PET substrates. The J–V plots measured for the highest efficiency device show a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 21.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 69% (Fig. 4a). The Jsc calculated from the corresponding EQE curve under AM1.5G conditions is 19.9 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b). Moreover, compared to the highest performing device on a glass substrate, the highest performing flexible device shows only a relatively lower FF, while the Voc and Jsc are similar. This lower FF may be partially resulted from the higher sheet resistance of the ITO on the PET substrate (35 Ω per square), compared to that on the glass substrate (15 Ω per square). Therefore, e-beam evaporated TiO2 is a good candidate for ETLs that suit both glass and plastic substrates.

The above devices are all made on e-beam TiO2 layers with an optimized thickness of 60 nm. It is found that the thickness of the TiO2 layer has a crucial influence on the device performance (Table 1). Increasing the TiO2 layer thickness from 15 nm to 45 nm leads to a significant improvement of all the photovoltaic parameters. An additional increase in FF occurs for even thicker TiO2 layers (60 nm). No further improvement in device performance is observed for thicknesses above 60 nm. Top-view SEM of perovskite layers on e-beam TiO2 indicates that the size of pinholes in the perovskite dramatically decreases with an increased TiO2 layer thickness (Fig. 5). The area coverage loss from pinholes in the perovskite layer is 3.4% for 15 nm and 0.5% for 30 nm thick TiO2 layers. Nearly negligible area losses are found for TiO2 layer thicknesses of 45 and 60 nm. This increase in active area can result in an increased light absorption as well as reduced shunt currents, leading to an improvement of all photovoltaic parameters.

 Fig. 5  Top-view SEM images of the perovskite (CH3NHPbI3−xClx) layers deposited on e-beam TiO2 layers with thicknesses of: (a) 15 nm, (b) 30 nm, (c) 45 nm, and (d) 60 nm. The percentages of calculated pinhole area are 3.4%, 0.5%, 0.09%, and 0.06% from (a) to (d), respectively. 
While similar observations that a thicker TiO2 layer gives better morphology of the perovskite layer have been reported by others, the origin remains poorly understood.28,29 Speculatively, Snaith et al. suggested that a thicker TiO2 layer was able to electrostatically stabilize the perovskite formation near the surface.28 We propose that the roughness and pinhole density in these perovskite films are related to the pinhole concentration in the TiO2 layer. A greater density of pinholes in thinner TiO2 layers exposes the perovskite precursor solution to bare ITO. The spin coating of precursors and formation of perovskite directly on ITO lead to extremely rough films with copious numbers of pinholes, demonstrating the apparent high stress interface between ITO and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.
AFM and XPS of TiO2 layers with different thicknesses confirm the existence of pin-holes in thinner TiO2 layers. The AFM images in Fig. 6 indicate similar surface topography and platelet sizes for each thickness of TiO2, and only a slight change of the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness from 4.21 nm to 3.81 nm with increasing TiO2 thickness. Also, each TiO2 layer thickness has a similar peak-to-valley depth of approximately 30 nm. With the peak-to-valley depth of a similar magnitude to the layer thickness, it is probable that some of the valleys measured in the 15 and 30 nm thick TiO2 layer are ITO surfaces. The thicker TiO2 layers likely reduce the chance of exposing the underlying ITO surface.
 Fig. 6  AFM images of e-beam deposited TiO2 layers with thicknesses: (a) 15 nm, (b) 30 nm, (c) 45 nm, and (d) 60 nm. 
XPS measurements further substantiate the exposure of ITO at the surface of samples with thin TiO2 layers (Fig. 7). All samples have the same spectral shape and binding energy (458.5 eV) for the Ti 2p3/2 XPS peak, which can be attributed to TiO2.13 This shape in energy signifies that there is no difference in the chemical composition for the different TiO2 thicknesses. Thus, similar surface properties, e.g. the surface energy, are expected. However, signals of In 3d can be found in the XPS spectrum obtained from the samples with 15 and 30 nm thickness of TiO2 on ITO. The intensity of the In 3d peaks decreases with increasing TiO2 thickness until finally they are undetectable for layer thicknesses above 45 nm. Since XPS is surface sensitive to approximately 5 nm in depth, the observation of the In 3d signals clearly indicate the existence of pinholes in thin TiO2 layers, coinciding with the results from AFM. Since the TiO2 layers with identical chemical composition are evaporated, all evidence points to pinholes in the thin TiO2 layers accounting for the poor morphology of the subsequently deposited perovskite layers, and thus lead to increasing device performance with increasing TiO2 thickness.
 Fig. 7  Each layer thickness (15, 30, 45, and 60 nm) of e-beam TiO2 show similar XPS spectra for the Ti 2p3/2 peak. The zoomed-in inset shows the In 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks decreasing with the layer thickness from 15 to 60 nm. Neither of the two In peaks are discernable for the 45 and 60 nm thicknesses. 
Conclusions
In summary, a low temperature e-beam deposited TiO2 layer is examined as an alternative to the archetypal, high temperature sol–gel prepared TiO2 for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based perovskite solar cells. Planar perovskite solar cells are demonstrated on both glass and PET substrates, achieving efficiencies of 14.6% and 13.5%, respectively. The thickness of the e-beam TiO2 layer plays a critical role in determining the morphology of the subsequently deposited perovskite layer. We propose that the pinholes in thin TiO2 layers expose the underlying ITO, and lead to pinholes in the perovskite layer. Thus, for complete coverage of perovskite and high performance, it is imperative that the TiO2 layer be sufficiently thick to fully cover the ITO. The e-beam induced TiO2 deposition enables processing of low temperature ETLs for n–i–p structure perovskite devices with high efficiency and freedom of substrate choice, taking the field another step closer to industrial scale production.
Experimental section
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
Glass substrates with patterned ITO electrodes were purchased from Colorado Concept Coatings. ITO electrodes on PET substrates were deposited using a low temperature radio-frequency magnetron sputtering of In2O3:SnO2 (95/5 wt%) according to the procedures reported previously.30 The ITO coated glass and PET substrates were first cleaned in ultrasonic baths of detergent, deionized water, acetone, and iso-propanol for 10 minutes each. The substrates were then transferred into an evaporation system (Angstrom Engineering) equipped with an electron beam source. The TiO2 pellets (Prof. Feierabend GmbH) were evaporated at a rate of 2 Å s−1 onto ITO substrates using a partial O2 pressure of 1.7 × 10−4 Torr during the deposition to maintain the stoichiometry of the film. The 40 wt% CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution, containing PbCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and CH3NH3I (Lumtec) with a molar ratio of 1:3 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 60 s onto the TiO2 layer. The obtained films were annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 1 h to form the perovskite structure. After that, 10 mg ml−1 PTAA solution (15 mg in 1.5 ml chlorobenzene) doped with 15 μl lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (170 mg ml−1 in acetonitrile) and 7.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine was spin coated onto the perovskite layers. All of the spin coating processes mentioned above were performed in an N2 filled glovebox. The PTAA material (Mn = 45500 g mol−1 and Mw = 96400 g mol−1) was synthesized as reported.31 The devices were completed by depositing an 80 nm Au layer onto the PTAA through shadow masks, defining twelve devices on one substrate, each with an active area of 0.13 cm2.
Instruments and characterization
Photovoltaic characteristics of the devices were measured under a nitrogen atmosphere using a Keithley 2602A Source-Measure Unit and an Abet solar simulator with 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G illumination, calibrated with an KG5 band pass equipped ISE Fraunhofer certified Si photodiode. The devices were measured from forward to reverse bias with a scan speed of 1 V s−1. The quasi-steady state current density was measured by operating the devices at the maximum power voltage that was found in the initial current density–voltage scan measurements. The quasi-steady state efficiencies were calculated by multiplying the quasi-steady state current density and the operating voltage. The EQE was measured with a photospectrometer setup (Bentham PVE300) by illuminating the solar cell with modulated monochromatic light (Xe and quartz halogen lamps). The complex index of refraction was measured by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE, ges5, sopra). The XRD patterns were recorded on a PANalyticalX'Pert Pro Materials Research Diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The top-view SEM images were obtained from a FEI Nova 200 scanning electron microscope. AFM images were obtained from a Bruker dimension edge system in peak-force tapping mode. XPS experiments were performed on a Physical Electronics (PHI) 5600LS electron spectrometer, equipped with a small-spot X-ray source providing monochromatic Al Kα photons (1486.6 eV) with resolutions of <0.4 and 0.04 eV, respectively. The binding energy scale was calibrated by means of an independent Au reference sample, setting the Au 4f7/2 core-level position to 84.00 eV.
