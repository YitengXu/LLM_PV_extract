    , Accepted 8th June 2022First published on 10th June 2022AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) have become one of the most rapidly developing research fields in the past two decades due to their low cost, light weight, and suitability for large-area preparation. OSCs have been using fullerenes and their derivatives as acceptors in the past years, but the shortcomings of fullerenes and their derivatives limit the further improvement of photovoltaic performance. Non-fullerene acceptor materials have been developed due to their modifiable molecular structure, adjustable energy level and regulated blend film morphology, which has set off a research upsurge in the field of OSCs. In this perspective, we mainly summarized the recent advances in innovation of small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptors (SM-NFAs) and structure–property relationships and compatibility of donors and acceptors, as well as the guidelines for future structure designs, morphology control and the direction for the development of SM-NFAs.Chuantao GuChuantao Gu received his Ph.D. degree from Qingdao Institute of Biomass Energy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences supervised by Prof. Renqiang Yang in 2016, and joined Qingdao University as a lecturer in the same year.

Design, System, Application
Small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptors (SM-NFAs) have received a lot of attention in recent years due to their advantages such high absorption coefficients, adjustable energy levels and bandgaps, straightforward synthesis, and excellent electrical and photovoltaic properties. Designing and synthesizing high-performance NFAs have become the mainstream approach for research of organic solar cells (OSCs). Thanks to the rapid development of SM-NFAs, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been increased from 3–4% to 19% just in several years. After the reports of ITIC and Y6, intense investigations have been made on structural tailoring of the molecules and lots of SM-NFAs with new structures have been reported. Those new NFAs play a vital role in improving device efficiency and solar cell performance. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in innovation of SM-NFAs.

1. Introduction
The energy crisis is a major problem facing the development of human society. At present, the widely used fossil fuel reserves such as oil and coal are limited, and the global warming and environmental pollution problems caused by the excessive consumption of fossil energy are becoming more and more serious.1 Development of clean energy is an inevitable choice of people and has become the research focus of scientists all over the world. Compared with coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear energy, etc., solar energy is an inexhaustible clean energy. Realizing the efficient use of solar energy is an important way to solve energy problems. In recent years, solar cell technology has developed rapidly and has been widely used in human production and life.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have the characteristics of solution processability, flexibility, and light weight. They are suitable for large-area low-cost preparation through printing or roll-to-roll technologies.2 OSCs use photosensitive organic materials as the active layer between the cathode and the anode, and generate voltage through the photovoltaic effect to form a current, thereby realizing the conversion of light energy to electrical energy.3 As a new energy technology, OSCs are expected to become an effective supplement to inorganic solar cells such as silicon-based solar cells, and have broad practical application prospects.4,5
As early as 1958, the photovoltaic phenomenon of organic materials was discovered by M. Calvin.6 In 1981 and 1986, T. Moriizumi7 and C. W. Tang3 developed organic photovoltaic cells with double-layer structure respectively, which achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1%. In 1995, A. J. Heeger used fullerene materials and adopted bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure to effectively solve the problem of limited diffusion distance of photogenerated excitons in organic semiconductors.8 At present, the active layer of OSCs is usually a BHJ structure which is a blend of p-type electron donor materials and n-type electron acceptor materials.9–12 The active layer with a BHJ structure produces an exciton (which is an electron–hole pair bound together by electrostatic) after the absorption of light. Both electron donors (D) and electron acceptors (A) have a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or ionization potential (IP) and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or electron affinity (EA). Electrostatic forces at the interface of D and A are generated because differences in EA and IP of D and A. The excitons diffuse inside the material to reach the D–A interface and then separate into free electrons and holes by the electric field. The hole will be accepted by the material that has lower IP while the electron will be transferred to the material that possesses higher EA. The free carriers transport towards the electrodes for collection.2,13
Both organic small molecules and polymers can be used as electron donor or electron acceptor materials.14,15 According to the types of electron acceptors in the active layer of BHJ OSCs, it can be divided into fullerene OSCs and non-fullerene OSCs. Fullerene OSCs use fullerenes and their derivatives16 (such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)) as acceptors. In the first 20 years of the development of OSCs, due to the high electron affinity, excellent charge transport properties and the easy-to-control phase separation morphology of fullerenes, fullerene OSCs have been extensively investigated, and achieved PCE higher than 10%.17–19 However, fullerene acceptors have their inherent shortcomings, such as difficulty in synthesis and purification, unadjustable energy levels, weak light absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, and poor morphological stability.20,21 These shortcomings greatly limit the further development of fullerene OSCs. In order to overcome these shortcomings, OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors have emerged and received more and more attention. Compared with fullerene acceptor materials, non-fullerene acceptor materials have the advantages of easy modification of chemical structure, adjustable energy level, adjustable spectrum, and more stable morphology.20,21 Based on the above advantages, OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptor materials have developed rapidly in recent years and have become a research hotspot in the field of organic photovoltaics.22,23 At present, non-fullerene OSCs have made great progress, and the PCE has exceeded 19%.24–28
Thanks to the advent of high performing NFAs, new use cases for OSCs have emerged, such as agrivoltaics,29 semi-transparent OSCs,30 indoor OSC,31 as well as new types of devices (i.e. photodetectors32). Although the PCE threshold for economic up-scaling has been or is close to being crossed, for practical applications, environmental benign technology and manufacturing cost of OSCs also need to be considered together. OSCs are usually processed with halogenated solvents that are hazardous towards humans and the environment. The environmental impact of solution processed OSCs can be mitigated by introducing halogen-free solvents or green solvents during the fabrication processes.33–37 Potential bottlenecks to low-cost OSC production lie largely in the cost of raw materials, especially for active layer materials.38,39 Therefore, it is important to develop low-cost and efficient acceptor materials.
Both small molecules and polymers can be used as electron donor or electron acceptor materials in the active layer. According to the types of electron donor and acceptor materials, non-fullerene OSCs can be divided into four types: all small molecule OSCs, polymer donor/small molecule acceptor OSCs, all polymer OSCs and small molecule donor/polymer acceptor OSCs. Among the four types, the polymer donor/small molecule acceptor OSCs obtained the highest PCE. Zhan et al.40 developed the A–D–A type small molecule acceptor material ITIC with the fused ring unit as the central core and the strong electron unit as the end group. ITIC has strong light absorption, suitable energy level and excellent charge transfer capability, showing high performance after blending with polymer donors. With the participation of scientific researchers from all over the world, the modular molecular design of such A–D–A type fused ring electron acceptor materials has been carried out, and many small molecule acceptor materials with excellent performance have been developed, such as IDIC, IT-4F and COi8DFIC.41–43 Zou et al. have developed high-efficiency A2–D–A1–D–A2 type fused-ring electron acceptor materials,44,45 such as Y6. At present, OSCs based on this type of fused-ring small molecule acceptors can realized PCE higher than 19%.46 In addition, driven by small molecule fused-ring electron acceptor materials, all small molecule OSCs27,47 and all polymer OSCs48–50 have also made great progress in recent years and have achieved PCE higher than 15%.47,50 The PCE of small molecule donor/polymer acceptor OSCs is relatively low when compared with other types of OSCs, and the current highest PCE is 9.5%.15
This review aims to summarize the recent research progresses of polymer donor/small molecule acceptor OSCs and all-small molecule OSCs. The recent advances of polymer donor/small molecule acceptor and all small molecule OSCs is introduced from the perspectives of molecular structure and photovoltaic properties. Finally, we look forward to the future development direction and prospects of small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptors (SM-NFAs) OSCs.
2. Polymer donor/small molecule acceptor OSCs
Conjugated polymers have been developed for many years and have been widely used in photovoltaics14,51 and other fields.52–55 Compared with conjugated polymers, small molecule materials have the advantages of high purity, definite chemical structure, and good repeatability. Small-molecule donor materials have been developed for many years,56,57 but the development of small-molecule acceptor materials was relatively slow until the emergence of non-fullerene fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), which promoted the improvement of photoelectric conversion efficiency of polymer donor/small molecule acceptor OSCs. According to their skeleton structures, small molecule acceptor materials can be divided as A–D–A type FREAs, A2–D–A1–D–A2 type FREAs, A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type FREAs and un-fused ring electron acceptors (UFRAs) with symmetric or asymmetric structures, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Classification of small molecule acceptors according to their skeleton structures. 
2.1 A–D–A type FREAs
In 2015, Zhan et al. designed and synthesized an A–D–A type electron acceptor named ITIC40 with a bulky seven-ring fused core (indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene, IT) and end-capped with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) groups (Fig. 2a). This molecule has a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect, with a strong absorption from 500 nm to 800 nm, the absorption spectrum can cover the near-infrared region, and the optical band gap is 1.59 eV. Thanks to the close packing of the end groups in the molecule, the electron mobility of the molecule is as high as 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Zhan et al. blended ITIC with the polymer donor PTB7-Th (Fig. 2b) as the active layer to prepare OSCs and achieved a PCE of 6.8%. In 2016, Hou et al.58 blended ITIC with another polymer donor PBDB-T (Fig. 2b) as the active layer, after optimizing the morphology, a PCE of 11.21% was obtained. These results proved the great potential of non-fullerene fused ring electron acceptor materials.

Zhan et al.43 replaced the phenyl side chain on ITIC with a thienyl side chain and obtained a new small molecule acceptor ITIC-Th (Fig. 2a). The σ-inductive effect of thienyl side-chains can match with both high-performance wide-band-gap and narrow-band-gap polymer donors. Thanks to the enhanced intermolecular interaction induced by sulfur–sulfur interaction, the electron mobility (6.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of ITIC-Th was higher than that of ITIC (3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Zhan et al. used the blend of the ITIC-Th acceptor and the wide band gap polymer donor PDBT-T1 (Fig. 2b) as the active layer to prepare solar cells and obtained a PCE of 9.6%.
Hou et al.42 introduced two fluorine atoms into the terminal group of ITIC, and the obtained new acceptor IT-4F (Fig. 2a) exhibited decreased LUMO energy level, redshifted absorption spectrum, and reduced energy band gap, and a PCE of 13.1% was obtained when blended with the fluorine-containing polymer donor PBDB-T-SF (Fig. 2b). Hou et al. further matched IT-4F with polymer donor PTO2 (Fig. 2b), and a PCE of 14.7% was achieved.20 Chen and co-workers59 designed and synthesized a series of polymers named PCE10-2Cl, PCE10-SF and PCE10-2F, respectively (Fig. 2b). These polymers were blended with IT-4F to fabricate OSCs and the devices based on PCE10-2Cl:IT-4F yielded a PCE of 10.72% with an average visible transmittance of over 30%. Containing 0.004 wt% n-type dopant benzyl viologen is incorporated into a bulk-heterojunction blend of PM6 (Fig. 2b) and IT-4F by Anthopoulos and co-workers,60 and the PCE of the cells increased from 13.2% to 14.4%.

Halogen substitution. 
In order to modulate the optoelectronic properties and intermolecular aggregation of materials, great efforts have been devoted to developing molecular design methods in the past three decades. Halogen substitution is one of the most popular and efficient molecular modification methods to lower the energy level, increase the planarity, and modulate the morphology.61 The low-lying HOMO is beneficial to obtain higher VOC since VOC is proportional to the offset between the HOMO of donor and the LUMO of acceptor.14 In order to investigate the effects of the fluorine atom position and number on electronic properties, film morphology, charge transport and photovoltaic properties of small molecular acceptor, Zhan et al.62 designed and synthesized four small molecular acceptors (INIC, INIC1, INIC2, INIC3) based on 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanones with 0–2 fluorine substituents as the electron-deficient units and 6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-indacenobis(dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d] thiophene) as the electron-rich unit (Fig. 3a). The absorption spectra are red-shifted, the LUMO energy levels are downshifted and electron mobility are enhanced after fluorine substitution. The organic solar cells based on FTAZ(Fig. 3b):INIC3 exhibit PCE as high as 11.5%, which is much higher than that of FTAZ:INIC (7.7%). Shen et al.63 employed electron-rich fluorene-fused dithienocyclopentafluorene as the central donor core and electron-withdrawing fluorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (ICF) or chlorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (ICCl) as the terminal acceptor group to fabricate two nonfullerene small-molecule acceptor namely DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl (Fig. 3a). They were blended with PM6 as the active layer to construct solar cells, and obtained a PCE of 7.67% and 11.03%, respectively. Huang et al.64 reported a novel non-fullerene small molecule acceptor namely TfIF-4FIC. Compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts TfIF-IC, the molecular energy levels TfIF-4FIC (Fig. 3a) were down-shifted due to the fluorination of the end-group IC. As a result, solar cell based on PM6:TfIF-4FIC offers a high JSC of 17.6 mA cm−2, an extremely high VOC of 0.98 V and a PCE of 13.1%. And tandem solar cells with PM6:TfIF-4FIC and PTB7-Th:PCDTBT:IEICO-4F as the front cell and the back cell obtained a PCE of 15%. In order to delineate device photophysics in polymer:NFA blends comprehensively, especially investigate the subtle differences in energetics and morphology, Nguyen and co-workers65 conducted a systematic study of PTB7-Th:IEICO, PTB7-Th:IEICO-2Fa, and PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (Fig. 3a) blends to unify and correlate the cumulative effects of i) voltage losses, ii) charge generation efficiencies, iii) non-geminate recombination and extraction dynamics, and iv) nuanced morphological differences with device performances. Finally, a deconvolution of the major loss processes in polymer:NFA blends and their connections to the complex BHJ morphology and energetics are established.

Core engineering. 
Core engineering is an effective method to improve energy level, enhance absorption and electron mobility. This method can simultaneously increase JSC and VOC.22
Adjusting the conjugation of the electron-donating fused-ring units in non-fullerene acceptors is an effective strategy to enhance electron mobility and absorption, tune energy levels, and finally achieve high device performance. Zhan et al.20 designed and synthesized IHIC2 and IOIC2, and their structures are shown in the Fig. 4. Compared with naphthalene-based IHIC2, the core of IOIC2 is extended to a fused octacyclic building block with stronger electron-donating ability. The IOIC2 shows higher LUMO (IOIC2: −3.78 eV vs. IHIC2: −3.86 eV), broader absorption and higher electron mobility, which is conducive to obtain higher VOC, JSC, FF and as well as higher PCE. FTAZ:IOIC2-based devices obtain a PCE of 12.3%, which is higher than that of the FTAZ:IHIC2-based devices (7.31%). Zhan et al.21 also reported three non-fullerene acceptors with varying core size named as F6IC, F8IC and F10IC (Fig. 4). OSCs based on these acceptors in combination with PTB7-Th as polymer donor yield PCE of 7.1–10.9%. Bazan and co-workers66 designed and synthesized a series of narrow bandgap NFAs named as ITIC-2F, IOTIC-2F and ITOTIC-2F (Fig. 4). Extending π-conjugation of donor frameworks leads to an intense intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in broad absorption profiles with band edge reaching 950 nm. The authors blend polymer donor PTB7-Th with those NFAs to fabricate OSCs, and PTB7-Th:IOTIC-2F-based devices achieve a PCE of 12.1% with good visible transparency (52% transmittance from 370 to 740 nm).
 Fig. 4  Structures of ITIC derivatives based on core engineering. 
Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene is fused in the naphthalene bay area through a six-membered ring connection to form an eight-ring ladder-type donor core based on dihydropyrenobisthieno[3,2-b]thiophene. Wang constructed two novel fused-ring electron acceptors with this core, namely PTT-IC and PTT-2FIC,67 respectively. Their structures are shown in the Fig. 4. They were blended with PBDB-T (Fig. 2b) as the active layer to construct solar cells, and obtained a PCE of 7.39% and 10.40%, respectively.
Small molecule electron acceptors containing a two-dimensional fused-ring core have recently attracted more and more attention. Wang et al.68 designed and synthesized two chlorinated two-dimensional fused-ring electron acceptors namely C8T-BDT4Cl and C8T-BDSe4Cl (Fig. 4). They were featured with the two-dimensional alkylthienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and alkylthienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]diselenophene (BDSe), respectively. Benefiting from more favorable morphology, solar cells based on C8T-BDSe4Cl:PM6 presented PCE of 13.50% higher than that of sulfur-containing analogue-based C8T-BDT4Cl:PM6 (12.21%). Kim et al.69 achieved significant improvements in the operational stability of OSC devices by combining substitution of Se in different positions in the molecular core and methylation of end groups of ITIC-derived acceptors. Combined with methylation and outer selenization, 95% of the initial solar cell efficiency is still retained after 450 hours under operating conditions, and its half-life is estimated to be 5600 hours, while ITIC is 400 hours. Their results reveal the key role of molecular structure of acceptor on solar cell operation stability, and provide important non-fullerene acceptors design rules through end group and heteroatom position control.
Symmetry-breaking strategy is a promising strategy to design high-performance fused-ring electron acceptors for organic solar cells. Müller-Buschbaum et al.70 designed and synthesized two fused-ring electron acceptors named IPT-2F and INPIC-2F. IPT-2F has an asymmetric core while INPIC-2F has a symmetric core, their structures are shown in Fig. 4. A favorable blend ordering with suitable phase separation and small domain sizes is obtained due to the better miscibility between the PBDB-T (Fig. 2b) and the asymmetric IPT-2F. Benefiting from more favorable morphology, solar cells based on IPT-2F:PBDB-T presented a PCE of 14.0% which is higher than that of INPIC-2F-based ones (8.37%). Different end capping groups were introduced to the 4,4,9,9-tetramethyl-4,9-dihydroselenopheno [2′,3′:5,6]-s-indaceno[1,2-b]thiophene core by Gao and co-workers71 to construct three asymmetric A–D–A type non-fullerene electron acceptors T–Se, T–Se–4F, T–Se–Th (Fig. 4). They were blended with PM6 (Fig. 2b) as the active layer to construct solar cells, and 7.44–10.29% PCE was obtained. In order to optimize light absorption and energy losses in near-infrared OSCs, Bazan and co-corkers72 designed and synthesized a series of A–π–D–π–A-type NFAs (p-IO1, o-IO1, p-IO2, and o-IO2, Fig. 5) with different substitutes and π bridges. The photovoltaic performance of asymmetric p-IO1 and o-IO1 are better than that of symmetric p-IO2 and o-IO2. OSCs based on o-IO1 and PTB7-Th exhibit an optimal PCE of 13.1%. The excellent photovoltaic performance obtained with the o-IO1 acceptor can be attributed to a JSC of 26.3 mA cm−2 and energy losses on the order of 0.54 eV. This work demonstrates that symmetry-breaking strategy and side-chain engineering are straightforward strategies to tune the molecular design of n-type molecular semiconductors.

IDIC and its derivatives. 
Based on ITIC, Zhan et al. replaced the phenylalkyl side group with an alkyl chain, and obtained a new small molecular acceptor named IDIC73 (Fig. 5a). Compared with ITIC, IDIC lacks the steric hindrance of phenyl, so the planarity is enhanced and the electron mobility is improved to 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Zhan et al. blended IDIC with PTB7-Th, PDBT-T1 (Fig. 2b), PDCBT, J51, PTFBDT-BZS (Fig. 5b) respectively as the active layer, and realized a PCE of 5.24–11.03%.24 Wang et al.74 synthesized three small molecule acceptors IDTC16-IC, IDTC16-Th, IDTC16-4F (Fig. 5a) by extending the alkyl chain and introducing fluorine atoms based on IDIC. These three molecules were blended with PM6 respectively as the active layer to construct OSCs, and PCE of 5.89–9.42% was obtained.
In order to obtain a fused-ring central core with stronger electron-giving ability, Ding et al. modified the central core by introducing an electron donating CO-bridge, and obtained a series of A–D–A type fused-ring small molecule acceptors such as CO5IC, IDTIC and COi8DFIC75,76 (Fig. 5a). Electron donating CO-bridge-containing COi8DFIC has strong absorption in the range of 600 nm to 1000 nm. Ding et al. blended it with the polymer donor material PTB7-Th as active layer to fabricate OSCs and obtained a PCE of 12.16%.76 The PCE further increased to 13.4% after adjusting molecular ordering and orientation.77 The authors also used COi8DFIC to construct ternary OSCs and tandem OSCs, and obtained PCE higher than 14.08%78 and 17.3%,79 respectively.
Woo et al.80 designed and synthesized two fullerene-non-fullerene hybrid acceptors named as IP and PIP, which contained IDTIC and PC61BM. Their structures are shown in Fig. 5a. The hybrid acceptors IP and PIP have both broad light absorption of IDTIC and efficient electron transport capability of PC61BM, as a result, OSCs based on PBDB-T:PIP shows average PCE of 8.14% and OSCs based on PBDB-T:IP shows average PCE of 7.93%. The parameters of OSCs based on A–D–A type FREAs discussed above were summarized in Table 1.

2.2 A2–D–A1–D–A2 type FREAs
Another type of representative small molecular non-fullerene is the A2–D–A1–D–A2 type FREA. Compared with the A–D–A type FREAs, A2–D–A1–D–A2 FREAs have obviously different conjugated skeleton. Alternating A2–D–A1–D–A2 framework structure can promote the charge transfer within the molecule and achieve excellent charge transport performance.
In 2018, Liu's group developed two A2–D–A1–D–A2 type small molecule acceptors named IID-IC81 and IID-IC-O82 (Fig. 6a). The authors blended them with the polymer donor J61 (Fig. 6b) as the active layer to construct OSCs with a PCE of 2.82% and 4.20%, respectively. In 2019, Zou et al. designed and synthesized a A2–D–A1–D–A2 type small molecule acceptor named Y5,44 which has a fused D–A–D core obtained from benzothiadiazole (BT) units fused with thienothiophene (TT) units as the central core and dicyanoindandione as the terminal group (Fig. 6a). Y5 was blended with polymer donor PBDB-T as the active layer to fabricate OSCs, after device optimization, a PCE of 14.1% was obtained. Subsequently, on the basis of Y5, Zou et al. introduced two fluorine atoms into the terminal dicyanoindandione and obtained Y6 (ref. 45) (Fig. 6a). Hou et al. introduced one chlorine atom into the terminal dicyanindandione and obtained eC9-2Cl,83 and introduced two chlorine atoms into the terminal dicyanindandione and obtained Y7.84 Their structures were shown in Fig. 6a.
 Fig. 6  Structures of IID-IC, IID-IC-O, Y6 and its derivatives (a) and related polymer donor materials and the third component (b). 
OSCs based on Y6:PM6 made by Zou et al. with conventional and inverted architectures each exhibited a high efficiency of 15.7%.45 Ding et al. blended Y6 with wide-bandgap polymer donor D18 (Fig. 6b) forming the active layer. After device optimization, a PCE of 18.22% was obtained.24 Zhou et al.85 employed a ternary strategy with PM6:Y6:PC71BM as the active layer, a large area flexible organic solar cell of 54 cm2 with an efficiency of 13% was obtained after device optimization. In addition, the solar cells based ternary and quaternary strategy with Y6 or its derivatives as acceptor achieved PCE of 15–19%.25,83,86–90 The parameters are summarized in Table 2.

In order to investigate the influence of side chains on the performance of the small molecule acceptors, Sun26 and Yan91,92 designed and synthesized nine acceptors (named N-C11, N3, N4, L8-BO, L8-HD, L8-OD, BTP-4F-PC6, BTP-4F-P2EH and BTP-4F-P3EH) with the same aromatic backbone of Y6 but with different side chains (Fig. 7a). They were blended with PM6 as the active layer to construct solar cells, and obtained PCE of 12.91–18.32%. Three acceptors C6OB-H, C6OB-Me, and C6OB-F (Fig. 7a) with different terminal groups were synthesized by Kim and co-workers.93 The effect of terminal group on blend morphology and voltage loss was systematically investigated. Their results showed that polymer donors and small molecule acceptors with similar terminal groups can improve blend morphology and suppress voltage loss. PBDT-H and PBDT-F (Fig. 7b) were blended with those acceptors to fabricated OSCs, and PCE of 10.06–15.21% were obtained. Li et al.94 designed and synthesized a new acceptor named BTPV-4F-eC9 (Fig. 7a). Devices based on PTB7-Th:BTPV-4F-eC9 obtained a PCE of 12.77% processed by the non-halogenated solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF). And a PCE of 16.67% was obtained through non-halogenated-solvent processed tandem solar cells based on BTPV-4F-eC9. Chu et al.95 designed the selenium heterocyclic small-molecule acceptor Y6-Se-4Cl (Fig. 7a), solar cells based on PM6:Y6-Se-4Cl yielded a PCE of 15%. Marks et al.96 compared direct skeletal fluorination (BTF) and indirect trifluoromethyl fluorination (BTFM) of end group of Y6 (Fig. 7a). Their results showed that these two patterns could induce distinctive behaviors in the active layer blends with chlorinated D18-Cl (Fig. 6b) and the 1-chloronaphthalene additive, and high PCE values of 17.30% (BTF, additive) and 17.10% (BTFM, no additive) were obtained after device optimization. Min et al.97 added 1 wt% of PZ1 to the blend of PM6:BTTT-2Cl (Fig. 7a), thermal stability of solar cells was improved as well as PCE increased from 13.80% to 15.10%. The asymmetric strategy has been widely used in the design of conjugated polymers98,99 and small molecule acceptors.71 Solar cells with Y6-based asymmetric acceptors and polymer donors as the active layer achieved PCE higher than 15%.100,101
 Fig. 7  (a) Structures of derivatives of Y6 with different side chains and end groups and (b) related polymer donor materials. 
In order to investigate the impact of molecular interaction and orientation on energy loss in organic solar cells, two benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran polymers P-FT and P-FP (Fig. 7b) together with two electron acceptors Y6 and m-ITIC were employed by Zhang and co-workers to fabricated solar cells.102 Their results showed that the use of Y6 can reduce energy loss when compared with ITIC. In order to investigate the impact of crystallinity and energy levels of the polymer donor on the active layer morphology and device performance in non-fullerene organic solar cells, Wei et al.103 designed and synthesized three polymer donors namely PDTBDT, PDTBDT-T, and PDTBDT-T-Cl, their structures were shown in Fig. 7b. The BTI unit has good planarity and strong electron withdrawing ability, which can effectively reduce the steric hindrance and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level. The combination of the DTBDT unit and the BTI unit is beneficial to improve the crystallinity of the active layer and obtain preferred face-on orientation, which greatly improves the efficiency of charge transfer. The optimized organic solar cells based on PDTBDT-T-Cl:Y6 achieved a PCE of 15.63%.
The acceptor Y7 has two more fluorine atoms on the terminal dicyanoindandione than Y6.84 When compared with Y6, Y7 displays a higher VOC and exhibits an extended optical absorption. Benefiting from the reduced non-radiative energy loss (0.206 eV), VOC and JSC were improved simultaneously and a high PCE of 16.5% (PBDB-TF:Y7) was achieved. Kim et al.104 introduced different amounts of 1,10-di(thiophen-2-yl)decane as flexible spacer into the PM6 polymer backbone (Fig. 7b). Their results showed that the morphology of polymer donor-small molecule acceptor blends significantly improved after a small content of flexible spacer was added. Benefiting from improved JSC and FF, the best-performing device based PM6-C10:Y7 showed a high PCE of 17.0%. Hao et al. fabricated solar cells based ternary strategy with PM6:Y7:DRCN5T as active layer achieved PCE of 16.83%.105 All the parameters of OSCs based on A2–D–A1–D–A2 type FREAs discussed above were summarized in Table 2.
2.3 A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type FREAs
Another type of representative small molecular non-fullerene is the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type FREA. McCulloch et al.106 designed and synthesized two A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type acceptors (named as O-IDTBR, EH-IDTBR) in 2016, their structures were shown in Fig. 8a. Solar cells based on P3HT:O-IDTBR and P3HT:EH-IDTBR obtained PCE higher than 6%. In 2017, McCulloch et al.107 fabricated a high efficiency device utilizing the EH-IDTBR as acceptor and the low-bandgap donor polymer PffBT4T-2DT (Fig. 8b) as donor with mesitylene as the solvent. A PCE of 11.1% was achieved without pre- or post-treatments. They also employed the ternary strategy to construct solar cells with PCE10:O-IDTBR:IDFBR (1:0.5:0.5) as active layer, and a PCE of 11.0% was obtained after device optimization.108 Yan et al.109 developed a wide bandgap donor polymer named PvBDTTAZ (Fig. 8b), and solar cells based on PvBDTTAZ:O-IDTBR realized a PCE of 11.6%. Yan et al.110 reported organic solar cells using polymer PffBT2T-TT (Fig. 8b) as the donor, which have identical bandgaps and close energy levels to the acceptor O-IDTBR. The Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) spectrum of neat PffBT2T-TT and O-IDTBR overlaps with that of the blend, which indicated that the driving forces for both electron and hole transfer were small. Despite the small driving forces, a maximum EQE of 67% and a high PCE of 10.4% can still be achieved. And this was the first example of efficient charge separation in nonfullerene organic solar cell despite small driving forces and a low Vloss, which was helpful for the understanding of charge transfer processes in organic solar cells. Shin et al.111 used a simple-structured nonfullerene acceptor T2-ORH (Fig. 8b) as the third component together with PTB7-Th and EH-IDTBR as active layers of a ternary solar cell. In the ternary device, a PCE of 11.55% was achieved with a 1:1:1 blend ratio after device optimization.
 Fig. 8  Structures of A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type FREAs (a) and related polymer donors and the third components (b). 
Zhan et al.112 added 1% or 2% PDI-2DTT to the blend of PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR as an energy driver to enhance the driving force for charge transfer, structures of IDT-2BR and PDI-2DTT were shown in Fig. 8. The best PCE of solar cells based on PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR/1% PDI-2DTT is 10.1%, which is one of the highest for single junction solar cells with small energy loss (<0.6 eV) and high VOC (>1.0 V). Ye et al.113 provided a facile and cost-effective method to construct thermally stable organic solar cells. They added 10 wt% polyacenaphthylene (PAC, Fig. 8b) with high glass-transition temperature over 230 °C into PTB7-Th:EH-IDTBR blend. Their results showed that the blend with 10 wt% PAC maintained 85% of initial efficiency upon continuous heating at 150 °C for over 800 h. This method was validated in many other organic solar cell systems, indicating great potential for achieving thermally stable organic photovoltaic devices. Peng et al.114 designed and synthesized a wide bandgap (2.03 eV) small molecular acceptor named as SFBRCN (Fig. 8a), which contained a spirobifluorene core flanked with a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) and end-capped with highly electron-deficient (3-ethylhexyl-4-oxothiazolidine-2-yl)dimalononitrile (RCN) units. The self-aggregation tendency of SFBRCN was effectively suppressed by the 3D spirobifluorene core. The strong electron-deficient RCN and BT units afforded SFBRCN a low-lying LUMO level. The device based on PTB7-Th:SFBRCN obtained a promising PCE of 10.12%. Jenekhe et al.115 designed and synthesized a small molecular acceptor named as NIBT (Fig. 8a), which contained an indaceno-[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (IDT) core flanked with a BT and end-capped with highly electron-deficient rylene imide units. The device based on PBDB-T:NIBT yielded a promising PCE of 10.8%.
In order to control the energy offsets, Zhou and co-workers116 proposed the “Same-A-Strategy” (SAS). They constructed polymer donor J52-Cl and small molecule acceptor BTA3 with the same electron-accepting unit of benzotriazole(BAT) (Fig. 9). The blend of J52-Cl:BTA3 yields decreased nonradiative recombination loss and small energy offsets. Benefiting from fine film morphology and strong molecular aggregation, device based on J52-Cl:BTA3 suppressed charge recombination losses and delivered balanced carriers mobilities. As a result, the device yielded a promising PCE of 10.5% with high VOC beyond 1.20 V. According to SAS, Zhou and co-workers117 constructed a non-fullerene acceptor named as BTA5 and four polymer donors named as PE31, PE32, PE33, and J52-Cl (Fig. 9). The effect of methoxy substituent (PE32), chlorination (PE33) and fluorination (J52-Cl) on the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance was systematically investigated. A highest PCE of 10.08% with a VOC of 1.11 V was obtained by the device based on BTA3 and PE31, which contained the unsubstituted BTA unit. In order to improve the VOC and JSC simultaneously, Zhou and co-workers118 designed and synthesized three BTA-based polymers (J52, J52-OMe, J52-F) to match the thiophene-fused BTA unit based small molecular acceptor JC2. The HOMO energy level of J52-OMe and J52-F downshifted when compared with J52. The VOC distinctly improved while JSC was slightly compromised. Their work provides an in-depth understanding of how different substituents affect photovoltaic performance, and provides guidance for the design of matching polymer donors and acceptors to balance the trade-off between VOC and JSC and achieve high device performance. Structures of all the acceptors and donors based on SAS mentioned above were shown in Fig. 9. All the parameters of OSCs based on A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type FREAs discussed above were summarized in Table 3.

2.4 Non-fused-ring electron acceptors (NFRAs)
The small molecule acceptors discussed above are fused-ring electron acceptors. These acceptors require tedious synthesis, which will undoubtedly increase material costs and limit commercial applications.119,120 Therefore, it is of great significance for the wide application of OSCs to obtain efficient acceptors through novel and reasonable molecular design and simplified synthesis steps to reduce costs. So scientists designed and synthesized NFRAs.
Chen and co-workers developed a serious of high efficiency NFRAs.90,119–125 In 2018, they designed and synthesized a new NFRA DF-PCIC (Fig. 10) with an unfused-ring core containing two cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) moieties and one 2,5-difluorobenzene (DFB) group.119 Due to the F⋯H noncovalent interaction between CPDT and DFB, DF-PCIC realized a nearly planar geometry. OSCs based on PBDB-T:DF-PCIC yield a PCE of 10.14% after proper optimizations. They also studied the effect of intramolecular O⋯S noncovalent bonds123 on photovoltaic properties of NFRAs with AOT1, AOT2 and AOT3 (Fig. 10) as models. Benefiting from multiple O⋯S interactions, the molecular backbone of AOT3 could be locked tightly, which is beneficial for J-aggregation. OSCs based on PCE10:AOT3 obtained a higher PCE of 6.59%. Chen et al. developed two narrow-band gap NFRAs BCDT-4F and BCDT-4Cl (ref. 122) by the conjugation of a BT core to halogenated end groups through a CPDT bridge. The chlorinated BCDT-4Cl (Fig. 10) showed stronger J-aggregation and closer molecular packing than fluorinated BCDT-4F, which led to an optimized blend morphology. OSCs based on PBDB-T:BCDT-4Cl presented a PCE of 12.10%, higher than that of PBDB-T:BCDT-4F (9.65%).
 Fig. 10  Structures of NFRAs. 
Chen et al. developed three NFRAs PTICH, PTIC and PTICO (Fig. 10) through two step synthesis from single aromatic units.120 These rotatable NFRAs can transfer into planar and stackable conformation in condensed solid with the assistance of non-covalent interactions, which is beneficial for feasible solution-processability and excellent film characteristics. OSCs based on PBDB-TF and these NFRAs yield PCEs of 4.08–10.27%. Based on this work, two-dimensional chain 4-hexylphenyl was introduced into the NFRAs,125 and obtained PTB4F and PTB4Cl (Fig. 10). Their results showed that the two-dimensional chain and halogenated terminals play synergistic roles in optimizing their solid stacking and orientation, which promote fast charge transfer and an elongated exciton lifetime. OSCs based on PBDB-TF:PTB4Cl gave a PCE of 12.76% after optimizations. The synergistic effects of branched alkyl side chain and chlorination on the photovoltaic properties were also studied with four NFRAs QCIC1, QCIC2, QCIC3 and QCIC4 (Fig. 10), which had the same conjugated backbone but different halogen atoms and alkyl side chains.124 Chen et al. studied the photostability of small molecule acceptors with fused IT-4F, semi-fused HF-PCIC and non-fused PTIC (Fig. 10) as model molecules.121 Their results showed that non-fused PTIC not only exhibits efficient performance in OSCs but also excellent photochemical tolerance in aerobic condition. After a series of in-depth investigations, they identified the structural confinement to inhibit photoisomerization of NFRAs, which helps enhancing the photochemical stabilities.
Tang et al.126 reported three narrow optical band gap (Eoptg < 1.45 eV) dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) based NFRAs with different frameworks named DBD-4F, DBT-4F and DBTD-4F (Fig. 10). OSCs based on PBDB-T:DBT-4F contribute a champion PCE of 12.14% which benefited from the better miscibility to form homogenous fibrous phase separation. Tang et al.127 discussed side-chain economy through 7H-dibenzo[c,g] carbazole (DCB) cored DCB-4F and carbazole cored CB-4F (Fig. 10). Although with the same side chain, the solubility of DCB-4F was higher than that of CB-4F due to the unique conformation of the DCB core. OSCs based on PM6:DCB-4F deliver a PCE of 9.56%. A promising PCE of 11.17% was achieved by adding 10 wt% PC71BM. The low structure order DCB-4F was also introduced into PM6:DTPSe-4Cl blends as the third component and exhibited an outstanding PCE of 15.93%.128
Bo et al.129 designed four simple NFRAs H-2F, CH3-2F, OCH3-2F and SCH3-2F (Fig. 10) with slightly twisted molecular backbone and nonplanar conformational diphenylamino substituents. The ICT and absorption in the NIR region was enhanced benefitting from the electron donating diphenylamino substituents. Their results showed that the substituents on diphenylamino had great influences on photovoltaic properties, and changing substituents can improve the PCE from 6.67 to 12.28%. In order to take full advantage of both fullerene acceptors PC61BM and NFRAs, Bo et al.130 designed and synthesized two novel NFRAs with PC61BM as the lateral pendent. The GIWAXS measurements showed that PC61BM modified PCBM-C6 and PCBM-C10 (Fig. 10) displayed isotropic diffraction patterns. The blends of PBDB-T and the new acceptors displayed more uniform and smoother morphology. OSCs based on PBDB-T:PCBM-C10 afforded an elevated PCE of 13.55% after device optimization.
Nguyen and co-workers131–133 designed and synthesized a series of narrow bandgap NFRAs (COTIC-4F, SiOTIC-4F, CO1-4F, CETIC-4F and CTIC-4F, Fig. 10) with similar backbone but different side chains. The bandgaps of those NFRAs are between 1.1–1.3 eV. Modulation of intramolecular charge transfer characteristics is achieved by replacing substitutes on thiophene spacers that connect an electron-rich cyclopentadithiophene or dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole core to peripheral electron-poor fragments. They blend polymer donor PTB7-Th or PBDBT with those NFRAs to fabricate OSCs, and achieve PCEs of 2.32–10.5%. Structures of NFRAs mentioned above were shown in Fig. 10 and all the parameters of OSCs based on NFRAs discussed above were summarized in Table 4.

Researchers have designed and synthesized a lot of small molecule acceptors134–136 with excellent properties through the strategies of side chain optimization, end group adjustment and center core regulation, together with device optimization achieved PCE higher than 18%. These explorations based on small molecule acceptors not only improved the PCE of polymer donor/small molecule acceptor type OSCs, but also proved the application prospects of small molecule electron acceptors.
3. All small molecule OSCs
All small molecule OSCs refer to OSCs in which the donor and acceptor materials of the active layer are both small molecules. In recent years, the vigorous development of non-fullerene FREAs has also promoted the improvement of the PCE of all small molecule OSCs.137–144 The recent advances of all small molecule OSCs will also be classified according to the type of acceptors.
3.1 All small molecule OSCs based on A–D–A type FREAs
In 2018, Hou et al.138 designed and synthesized a group of small molecule donor materials named DRTB-T-CX with triple two-dimensional BDT as the core and rhodamine with different alkyl substitution as the end-capping group (Fig. 11b). They employed DRTB-T-CX as the donor material and IT-4F (Fig. 2a) as the acceptor material to blend as the active layer to construct OSCs. The results showed that by adjusting the alkyl chain length of DRTB-T-CX can change the molecular orientation, and the highest PCE of 11.24% was obtained when the alkyl chain was n-butyl.
 Fig. 11  Structures of acceptors (a) and donors (b) used in all small molecule OSCs based on A–D–A type FREAs. 
Li et al.140 synthesized two medium-bandgap p-type small molecular donors named H21 and H22. The central units of H21 and H22 (Fig. 11b) are two-dimensional BDT units with conjugated alkylsilyl–thienyl side chains, and the end-capping groups are 3-ethyl rhodanine (H21) and cyanoacetic acid esters (H22), respectively. The PCE of OSCs based on H22:IDIC reached 10.29% after device optimization.
Jen et al.141 used ZnP-TBO (Fig. 11b) as the donor and 6TIC (Fig. 11a) as the acceptor to construct OSCs. A very high PCE of 12.08% was achieved by tuning the sequentially evolved crystalline morphology through combined solvent additive and solvent vapor annealing. The crystallinity of the ZnP-TBO and 6TIC blend had been improved and multilength scale morphology formed, as a result, charge mobility and charge extraction were enhanced.
Zhu et al.142 designed and synthesized a weak crystalline small molecular donor named as BSFTR (Fig. 11b). BSFTR was blended with a strong crystalline acceptor NBDTP-Fout (Fig. 11a) as active layer to fabricate OSCs. Thanks to the weak crystallinity of BSFTR, a well-intermixed blending morphology was achieved, efficient charge percolation pathways formed and the recombination suppressed. A PCE of 12.26% was obtained after device optimization.
Ternary strategy is also a promising strategy to improve the performance of all-small-molecule OSCs. Wei et al.145 added the small molecular acceptor IDIC (Fig. 5) to the blend of ZR1-Cl:IDIC-4Cl (Fig. 11) to construct ternary all-small-molecule OSCs. Two small molecule acceptors with similar structures can not only enhance the absorption, but also have good miscibility to form acceptor alloys, which is beneficial to increase the VOC and JSC. Ordered packing, good miscibility and high crystallinity in the ternary film with a fibrous structure was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering. The morphology is conducive to electron transfer, and the fill factor increased to 69.66%. Finally, the ternary system doped with IDIC achieved a PCE of 11.65%.
3.2 All small molecule OSCs based on A2–D–A1–D–A2 type FREAs
The most commonly used acceptors of all small molecule OSCs based on A2–D–A1–D–A2 type FREAs are Y6 and its derivatives. Donors used in high-performance all small molecule OSCs is mainly based on BTR and its derivatives,143,146–148 their structures were shown in Fig. 12.
 Fig. 12  Structures of donors (a) and acceptors (b) used in all small molecule OSCs based on A2–D–A1–D–A2 type FREAs small molecular acceptors. 
Ge et al.143 adjusted the number of substituted fluorine atoms on the thiophene side group on the BDT core unit of the small molecule donor material DCAO3TBDTT (Fig. 12a) and obtained two new donors named BTEC-1F and BTEC-2F (Fig. 12a). Their results showed that fluorination could be an effective way to regulate molecular crystallization and orientation. BTEC-1F and BTEC-2F were blended with Y6 as active layer to fabricate OSCs, and OSCs based on BTEC-1F:Y6 yielded a PCE of 11.34% and OSCs based on BTEC-2F:Y6 gave a PCE of 13.34% after device optimization. Li et al.147 used an alkylthiophene-substituted BDT unit as the core unit and rhodanine as the end-capping group. They were connected by thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole to synthesize a wide band gap small molecule donor BTTzR (Fig. 12a). Using the blend of BTTzR:Y6 as the active layer to construct an all-small-molecule OSC, 13.9% of PCE was obtained after device optimization, and the non-radiative energy loss of the device was only 0.18 eV, which was equivalent to that of inorganic solar cells.
Our research group designed and synthesized four small molecule donors47,149 named FBD-S1, TBD-S2, FBD-S3, TBD-S4 (Fig. 12a), which used a subtly tailorable asymmetric central core. They were blended with the small molecule acceptor Y6 as the active layer to construct OSCs, and PCE of 11.5%, 13.1%, 12.5%, and 15.1% were obtained respectively. The introduction of the asymmetric core gives small molecules a curved skeleton similar to Y6, and a unique network can be formed in which small molecule donors can easily penetrate into adjacent Y6 through strong intermolecular interaction and facile stacking direction. These characteristics hinder rapid aggregation and prevent the formation of large single component domains in blends, as a result a PCE of 15.10% in TBD-S4:Y6 based device was obtained, which is one of the highest values of all small molecular OSCs. This work shows that regulating the conformation of small molecule donor materials through an asymmetric central core is a novel and powerful method for designing small molecule donor materials, which opens a new way for efficient all small molecular OSC (Table 5).

Side chain engineering has been widely used in conjugated polymers:fullerene OSCs, and it is also applicable to all small molecule OSCs. Based on small molecular donor SM1 (Fig. 12a), Li et al.144 replaced the alkyl substituent of the thiophene on BDT core unit with the alkylthio substituent obtaining the small molecule SM1-S, and replaced the hydrogen atom of the thiophene on BDT core unit with fluorine atom obtaining the small molecule SM1-F (Fig. 12a). They were blended with the small molecule acceptor Y6 as the active layer, and a PCE of 12.94% and 14.07% were achieved after device optimization. Wang et al.148 replaced the alkyl substituent of the thiophene on BDT core unit of FYSM-H with tetrialkylsilyl and chlorine atom yielding the small molecule donor FYSM-Si and FYSM-SiCl, respectively (Fig. 12a). When blended with Y6, the FYSM SiCl based all small molecular OSCs exhibited both high JSC of 23.7 mA cm−2 and high VOC of 0.85 V, which is high for all small molecular OSCs. The high JSC and VOC could be attributed to the delicate balance between suitable blend morphology and high crystallinity, as well as low HOMO level of FYSM-SiCl. As a result, FYSM-SiCl achieved a high PCE of 13.4%.
Based on BTR (Fig. 12a), Hou et al.146 designed and synthesized a new small molecule donor B1 (Fig. 12a) by replacing the thiophene side groups on the BDT core with phenyl side groups. Compared with BTR, B1 exhibits stronger interaction with the non-fullerene acceptor Y7. The morphology of the donor-acceptor blend was synergistically optimized in the B1:Y7 system. The B1:Y7-based devices achieve an outstanding PCE of 15.3%. OSCs based on B1:BO-2Cl and B1:BO-4Cl obtained PCE of 13.7% and 15.3%27 respectively. They also fabricated ternary cells based on B1, BO-2Cl and BO-4Cl (1:0.5:0.5) (Fig. 12b), and the optimal ternary cell exhibits a PCE of 17.0%22 which was the highest PCE of all small molecular OSCs.
In order to improve the FF of all small molecular OSC based on BTR-Cl(Fig. 12a):Y6, Lu et al.150 added 5 wt% PC71BM as additive, and a PCE of 15.34% was obtained. They also designed and synthesized an asymmetric small molecule acceptor BTP-FCl-FCl (ref. 151) (Fig. 12b) based on the Y6, and blended BTP-FCl-FCl with the small molecule donor BTR-Cl (Fig. 12a) as the active layer to construct OSCs, obtaining a PCE of 15.3%. BTP-FCl-FCl has F and Cl substitutions on the same end group, providing a local asymmetric structure. So compared with the globally asymmetric isomer BTP-2F-2Cl (ref. 151) (Fig. 12b), BTP-FCl-FCl has a lower total dipole moment, lower distribution disorder and larger average electron static potential, thereby improving charge generation and extraction. The locally asymmetric F and Cl substitution on the same end group is a new strategy to improve the performance of all small molecular OSCs.
Wei et al.152 realized highly ordered packing and the optimized morphology with multi-length scale domains by moving the alkyl-thiolation side chains of small-molecule donor from the para- (P-PhS) to the meta-position (M-PhS). All small molecule OSCs based on M-PhS:BTP-eC9 (Fig. 12) obtained a record efficiency of 16.2%.
In addition to designing and synthesizing small molecule donor materials and acceptor materials with new structure, the construction of ternary cells and morphology control are also effective strategies to improve the performance of all small molecule OSCs. Researchers have added PC71BM150,153 and small molecule acceptor materials with similar structures154 to the active layer to construct ternary OSCs, and the morphology optimization of the active layer,155–158 all achieved PCE of more than 14%.
3.3 All small molecule OSCs based on other type small molecular acceptor
Beaujuge et al.139 used DR3 (Fig. 12a) as small molecule donor and O-IDTBR (Fig. 8a) as small molecule acceptor to construct all-small molecule OSCs, and obtained a PCE of 6.4% after device optimization. Park et al.159 designed and synthesized three small molecular acceptor named NIDCS-MO, NIDCS-PrO and NIDCS-PeO (Fig. 12b) with different alkoxy side chains on the central unit. They were blended with the small molecular donor DTS-F (Fig. 12a) respectively as the active layer to construct OSCs. Their results showed that the VOC gradually increased as the alkoxy chain increased. After device optimization, PCE of 4.82%, 3.55%, and 3.97% were obtained, respectively.
Although compared with the rapid development of polymer solar cells, the research progress of all small molecule organic solar cells is obviously lagging behind, but with the vigorous development of new small-molecule donors and small-molecule FREAs and NFRAs, we believe that the device performance of all-small-molecule OSCs is expected to be further improved.
4. Current challenges in SM-NFAs based OSCs
4.1 Stability
Previous studies have emphasised to significantly enhance performance of SM-NFAs OSCs. Despite these advancements, the long-term stability of these devices needs to be increased to enable OSCs to be competitive with other solar cell technologies. Sunlight, oxygen and thermal stresses can cause deterioration of organic materials. Researchers have proposed various strategies for stable operation of OSCs based on NFAs.160
In order to increase the intrinsic chemical and photochemical stability of A–D–A type NFAs, Liu et al.161 employed cyclohexene as π-conjugated bridges between electron donor unit and electron withdrew unit, and obtained a series of ring-locked NFAs. The PTB7-Th:IDTT-CT based OSCs showed very encouraging photostability, the PCE of which could retain over 80% of its initial PCE in air after one sun irradiation without UV filter for 200 h. Holliday et al.106 present a new SM-NFA named O-IDTBR which is based on an indacenodithiophene core with benzothiadiazole and rhodanine flanking groups. They compared the air stability of OSCs with OIDTBR to those with fullerene acceptors. The PCE of the OSCs based on fullerene derivatives deteriorated rapidly, and the devices were barely working after 1200 h. Attributing to the smooth surface of the active layer with O-IDTBR which did not aggregate under ambient conditions, the OSCs based on O-IDTBR worked stably for 1200 h, and maintained 72% of the original PCE. In order to improve the thermal stability, Xu et al.162 employed ladder-type donor units to fabricate SM-NFAs named IDT-BT-R. IDT-BT-R was utilized to form thermally stable OSCs, which maintained a comparable PCE of 8.2% at 150 °C for 1 h. The high morphological stabilities are due to low-crystallinity nature of IDT-BT-R.
4.2 Cost
With the development of OSCs, the cost analysis for organic photovoltaics is also constantly updated and improved.38 Min et al.39 performed a cost analysis for organic solar modules via a bottom-up cost model. They explored the materials cost, manufacturing cost (MC), minimum sustainable price (MSP) and the low levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Their results showed that the direct MC and MSP for an opaque single solar module (SSM) is 187 ¥ per m2 and 297 ¥ per m2, respectively. The LCOE value for an SSM with a 10% PCE in a 20 year range from 0.185 to 0.486 ¥ per kW h−1, with a national average of 0.324 ¥ per kW h−1 in China under an average solar irradiance of 1200 kW h m−2 year−1. Material cost accounts for 70% of MC, and the cost of active layer materials and electrode materials accounts for 60% of the total material cost.39 Therefore, further reducing the cost of photovoltaic materials while achieving high photovoltaic performance is the key to promoting the commercialization of OSCs.
4.3 Large-area devices
At present, high-efficiency devices are usually small-area (less than 0.1 cm2) devices prepared by spin coating. How to prepare large-area high-performance devices has become a problem that needs to be solved in industrialization.4
The film thickness of OSCs fabricated by the spin-coating method is about 100 nm. But it is inappropriate to choose a thin active layer to fabricate large-area OSCs because there are lots of point defects exist in large-area OSCs, which makes the thin active layer sensitive to the point defects on the substrates with high roughness. The active layer materials with high thickness tolerability should be developed to fabricate the effective large-area organic solar cells. In 2020, Hou et al.163 designed and synthesized a highly efficient NFA named BTP-4Cl-12 with high thickness tolerability. The blend film based on PBDBTF:BTP-4Cl-12 showed very good morphology when the blade-coating method was used and 1 cm2 OSCs based on the blade-coating method yielded a high PCE of 15.5%.
Large-area devices usually lead to PCE losses, so modular design for large-area OSCs processing should be carefully considered to minimize PCE loss and be simple and economical. The spin-coating method is nearly the solely employed technique to prepare OSCs, but it is not applicable for a large volume production, as it leads to several unintentional and bewildering variations in device processing. Various scalable fabrication techniques for large-area fabrication have been developed,160 such as slot-die coating, knife coating, screen printing, gravure printing, inkjet printing, flexographic printing. By synergistically reducing the electrical losses within the flexible substrate and optimizing the morphology of the active layer, Wei et al.164 successfully fabricated large-area flexible OSCs using the slot-die coating technique. An excellent PCE of 12.16% is realized by 1 cm2 flexible devices, which is very close to the PCE (12.37%) of the small area (0.04 cm2) rigid device fabricated by the spin coating process.
The fabrication of large-area OSCs will be successfully realized through combining thick-film material systems with efficient modular designs exhibiting low-efficiency losses and employing the right printing methods.4
4.4 Green solvent processing
Conjugated polymers generally have better solubility in halogenated solvents such as chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, and chloroform. High-performance OSCs are usually processed with halogenated solvents despite being considered highly hazardous to environment and human health. The environmental impact of solution processed OSCs can be mitigated by environmentally friendly solvents (so-called green solvents, such as ortho-xylene (o-XY), para-xylene (p-XY) trimethylbenzene, THF, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and (R)-(+)-limonene) during the fabrication processes. Recently, fabrication of OSCs with green solvents has become an emergent trend with exciting prospects.33,34,36,37 Li and co-workers35 obtain certified PCEs over 17% in OSCs processed from a green solvent p-XY by a guest-assisted assembly strategy. They also deposit a uniform large-area module (36 cm2) processed with p-XY and yield a high PCE of over 14%. Enabling green processing options will minimize negative impacts on the environment and health hazards, which will accelerate the mass fabrication of OSCs and is pivotal for industry scale implementation.
5. Conclusion and outlook
The field of organic photovoltaics has moved from the fullerene era to the non-fullerene era. This article reviews the important developments in non-fullerene small molecule acceptors in recent years. The development of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors has gone through more than 10 years. From the initial PCE less than 1%, it has experienced two qualitative leaps. One was in 2015, the synthesis of ITIC and its derivatives increased PCE to 13%, and the other one was the synthesis of Y series acceptors in 2019, which increased PCE to 17–19%. Through structure optimization, construction of ternary, quaternary and tandem cells, and in-depth exploration of the working mechanism of OSCs, it is expected that the efficiency of OSCs will be further improved.
In order to realize the commercialization of organic photovoltaics, it is still necessary to carry out more systematic and in-depth research in the following aspects:
(1) Active layer materials. a) Develop more efficient acceptor materials through strategies such as adjusting the skeleton, substituent groups, and terminal groups, and at the same time strengthen the research in mass preparation, repeatability and purity control of materials. b) Design and synthesize donor materials that are more compatible with non-fullerene acceptors, broaden the absorption spectrum of the D/A blends, and optimize energy level matching to further improve photovoltaic performance. c) Choose a suitable donor/acceptor material as the third component, employ the ternary strategy to further broaden the absorption spectrum, improve the crystallinity, increase the carrier mobility, and elevate the PCE.
(2) Device. a) It is very important to further reduce the voltage loss. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the driving forces of exciton dissociation and reduce non-radiative recombination loss in order to carry out targeted molecular design and device optimization. b) In addition to spin-coating the active layer, explore other processing methods of the active layer and simplify the processing steps of the active layer, such as roll-to-roll to prepare large-area devices, so as to conduct more exploration for practical applications of flexible devices, semitransparent devices and indoor photovoltaics.
(3) Materials cost. High PCE with cost-effective material synthesis and device fabrication are the prerequisite for commercialization of OSCs. The cost of the active layers and the electrode materials account for a large proportion. Therefore, it is necessary to design low-cost donor and acceptor materials with simpler chemical structure and easier synthesis and purification processes while ensuring high performance.
(4) Device lifetime. Most investigations are still based on small-area devices and lifetime estimates obtained by extrapolation. It is necessary to carry out long-term life testing based on large-area devices.

Design, System, Application
Small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptors (SM-NFAs) have received a lot of attention in recent years due to their advantages such high absorption coefficients, adjustable energy levels and bandgaps, straightforward synthesis, and excellent electrical and photovoltaic properties. Designing and synthesizing high-performance NFAs have become the mainstream approach for research of organic solar cells (OSCs). Thanks to the rapid development of SM-NFAs, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been increased from 3–4% to 19% just in several years. After the reports of ITIC and Y6, intense investigations have been made on structural tailoring of the molecules and lots of SM-NFAs with new structures have been reported. Those new NFAs play a vital role in improving device efficiency and solar cell performance. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in innovation of SM-NFAs.
