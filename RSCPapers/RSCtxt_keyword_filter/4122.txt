    , Accepted 23rd March 2020First published on 23rd March 2020AbstractIn the last five years, the tremendous progress achieved in the field of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has attracted extensive attention to this emerging technology for exploiting renewable energy. Owing to their excellent optoelectronic features and outstanding manufacturability for film deposition, wide bandgap (WBG) polymer donors have become a leading component in bulk heterojunction layers and thus, a correlative review focusing on their molecular design, aggregation behavior and photovoltaic properties is necessary.

Introduction
As an emerging technology utilizing clean and renewable energy, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential in the fabrication of flexible, semi-transparent, and modular photovoltaic devices via solution processing.1–4 Solution processing offers researchers opportunities to overcome the short exciton diffusion distance in organic semiconductors with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, which requires photovoltaic material innovation and device optimization. Based on the state-of-the-art device structure (Fig. 1) and meticulous regulation of BHJ materials, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has gradually increased in this field. Evidently, in recent years, the innovation of BHJ materials has enabled the rapid development of PSC branches, including architecture modification, physical understanding and industrialization. Dialectically, however, the flaws and defects of the current BHJ materials have become a major problem for their further optimization. According to the numerous reports on OPV, a crucial issue in the donor material design is the balance among bandgap, aggregation and photovoltaic properties, which will be discussed specifically in the following sections.
 Fig. 1  (a) Device configuration of PSCs. (b) Typical absorption spectra of the materials in the BHJ layer. 
In the design of reasonable polymer donors, the primary principle for maximizing solar radiation utilization is to construct complementary absorption spectra against given acceptors, so that the upper limit of quantum efficiency can be maintained at a high level. This means that tuning the onset wavelength in the absorption spectra as well as the equivalent bandgap is required, which is challenging and dominates the quantum efficiency and components employed.
According to a previous study,5 conjugated molecules are usually classified into three categories based on their optical bandgap (Eoptg): wide bandgap (WBG, Eoptg > 1.8 eV), medium bandgap (MBG, 1.6 eV < Eoptg < 1.8 eV) and low bandgap (LBG, Eoptg < 1.6 eV). In the early stage in the development of PSCs, WBG polymers were usually constructed using homo building blocks, such as poly[2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyloctylocy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene] (MDMO-PPV) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),6,7 which were widely studied as donors in fullerene-based PSCs. Subsequently, a fluorene and benzothiadizole-based alternating WBG copolymer donor was synthesized using electron-donating (D)/electron-accepting (A) units and successfully applied in BHJ PSCs.8 Several WBG copolymers were prepared and showed decent PCEs in PSCs. Unfortunately, the PCEs of WBG donor-containing devices are usually lower than those of narrow bandgap (NBG) donors because of the low circuit-current density (JSC) induced by the mismatched absorption spectra between the WBG polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors. As shown in Fig. 1b and numerous reports, fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors only have strong absorption in the short wavelength region. However, a significant exception appeared in 2015, where Zhan et al. reported the low bandgap (LBG) non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) ITIC, showing a PCE of 6.8% by blending with an LBG polymer (PTB7-Th). Subsequently, our group achieved a PCE of 11.21% with a high JSC of 16.81 mA cm−2 by employing a WBG polymer (PBDB-T) and ITIC, which was the highest value reported for PSCs at that time.9 Henceforth, the design and synthesis of WBG polymer donors have become highly desirable for high-performance PSCs.
Unlike quasi-spherical fullerene derivative acceptors, NFAs with planar conjugated backbones have anisotropic charge carrier transport properties, which make them more difficult to form favourable BHJ morphologies due to their inefficient π–π interactions with WBG polymer donors. Therefore, designing WBG polymer donors in NF-based PSCs is challenging due to the coexisting morphological and photovoltaic demands. Nevertheless, with the development of NFAs, there are opportunities for the further improvement of PCEs by combining LBG NFAs and WBG polymer donors in PSCs. For instance, (i) compared to the low JSC (<20 mA cm−2) of fullerene-based PSCs, NF-based PSCs can yield a JSC of more than 25 mA cm−2. (ii) Compared to the large driving force (>0.3 eV) of fullerene-based PSCs, NF-based PSCs only need a small driving force (<0.3 eV) for efficient charge separation.10,11 (iii) Compared to the large energy loss (Eloss > 0.6 eV) in fullerene-based PSCs, NF-based PSCs yield a lower Eloss (<0.55 eV). Eloss is defined as Eloss = Eg − qVOC, where Eg is the bandgap, q is the elementary charge, and VOC is the open-circuit voltage, but the calculation of Eg is not consistent in the literature.12 One of the methods suggests the use of the intersection between the normalized absorption and emission spectra of the active material in the film due to the clear physical meaning of this concept.13 The related progress on WBG polymer donors has been well documented in several reviews.5,14,15 In this feature article, we highlight our recent efforts in the development of high-performance WBG polymer donors (Fig. 2, and the corresponding NFAs are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1), specifically summarizing the molecular design rules for high-performance WBG polymer donors, quantifying the charge generation and separation under a small driving force between the WBG polymer donor and NFA, and discussing the reduction in Eloss. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges towards the realization of the commercialization of PSCs based on WBG polymer donors are presented.

Recent progress of WBG polymer donor-based high-performance PSCs
In 2012, we reported a WBG polymer donor, PBDB-T, which is composed of a benzodithiophene (BDT) unit and benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) unit. This polymer exhibited excellent temperature-dependent aggregation property in o-dichlorobenzene solution. After blending with PC61BM, the as-fabricated polymer-based device obtained a PCE of 6.67%.16 Subsequently, considering the unique aggregation property and wide absorption spectrum of PBDB-T in the short wavelength region, we employed this polymer donor to fabricate PSCs with the LBG acceptor ITIC in 2016. Compared to the PBDB-T:PC71BM blend, the PBDB-T:ITIC blend displayed a much broader absorption spectrum and smaller ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO, which are beneficial to enhance solar photon harvesting and reduce VOC loss, thus yielding a higher JSC and VOC in the PBDB-T:ITIC-based device. Additionally, the high and balanced charge carrier mobilities and granular aggregation morphology in the PBDB-T:ITIC blend led to a high fill factor (FF). Finally, the PBDB-T:ITIC-based device showed an outstanding PCE of 11.21%. Furthermore, the PCE of 10.78% was certified based on the PBDB-T:ITIC-based device with an area of 1.00 cm2. This is the first example where the PCE of an NF-based PSC was higher than that of fullerene-based PSCs.9 Using the same polymer donor, the IT-M-based device exhibited a higher VOC value (0.94 V) than that of the ITIC-based device (0.90 V), thus resulting in an enhanced PCE of 12.05%.17 The introduction of the electron-deficient F atom into the end-capping groups of ITIC produced an acceptor (IT-4F) with a downshift in the LUMO energy level, redshift in absorption and enhancement in extinction coefficient. Thus, to avoid reducing the VOC of the resulting device, we designed and synthesized a new polymer (PBDB-T-SF) donor with a deep HOMO energy level by introducing fluorinated and alkylthiolated thiophene as functional side chains.18 Consequently, the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F-based device showed a high efficiency of 13.1% with a VOC of 0.88 V, and significantly improved JSC of 20.5 mA cm−2.
Another deep HOMO polymer donor (PBDB-TF, also named PM6) with excellent aggregation properties, which was synthesized in 2015,19 was also used to fabricate a PSC with IT-4F, and this device achieved a PCE of 13.7% with an improved FF of 0.77, which was attributed to the higher charge carrier mobility of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F blend.20 Recently, a PBDB-TF-based device achieved a PCE of over 17% by employing the electron acceptor BTP-4Cl-12.21 When the acceptor was further optimized by tailoring its flexible chain, the PBDB-TF-based device achieved a higher PCE of 17.8%, with an ultrahigh FF of 0.81.22 Thus, considering the excellent aggregation properties and different molecular energy levels of PBDB-T and PBDB-TF, both polymer donors have been widely used as donor materials to blend with new LBG acceptors for testing their photovoltaic performances to date.21,23–35 The Cl atom is another important electron-deficient element compared to the F atom; however, the Cl atom has empty d-orbitals available for π electron delocalization, thus resulting in deeper HOMO levels, stronger intermolecular aggregation and higher charge transport in chlorinated conjugated materials than that of their fluorinated counterparts.36,37 More importantly, chlorinated building blocks can be synthesized through simple synthetic routes from low-cost commercial materials, which is beneficial for their large-scale production. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a new polymer, PBDB-T-2Cl, in which Cl atoms replaced the F atoms in the conjugated side chain of PBDB-TF.38 This minor change did not affect the polymer geometry but downshifted the HOMO level of the resulting polymer. When both polymers were used to fabricate PSCs with an inverted device architecture by blending IT-4F, the chlorinated polymer showed a much better PCE of 14.4% than its fluorinated counterpart (13.2%). Besides, the Cl atom has a larger van der Waals radius (1.75 Å) compared to that of the F atom (1.35 Å), which can strongly impact the molecular planarity when it is introduced into the polymer main chain. Thus, to study this effect, we designed and synthesized two new polymers, PCl(3)BDB-T and PCl(4)BDB-T, in which the thiophene-bearing Cl atom faces the BDD and BDT unit, respectively.39 Surprisingly, both polymers exhibited significantly different conjugated conformations. Due to its more planar backbone, PCl(4)BDB-T exhibited a more redshifted absorption spectrum and stronger aggregation in diluted chlorobenzene solution compared to that of PCl(3)BDB-T. The strong aggregation of PCl(4)BDB-T was beneficial for good nanoscale phase separation with IT-4F in the BHJ blend. Therefore, the PCl(4)BDB-T-based device produced a high PCE of 12.33%, whereas the PCl(3)BDB-T-based device gave an extremely low PCE of 0.2% due to its poor intra-/inter-molecular charge transfer and BHJ morphologies. Thus, our results imply that suitable chlorination sites in conjugated materials are vital for the development of high-performance chlorinated photovoltaic materials.
Besides PBDB-T analogues, we also developed a series of alkoxycarbonylthiophene-based WBG polymers for high-performance NF PSCs. For instance, alkoxycarbonyl-functionalized polythiophene (PDCBT) was facilely prepared40 and applied in NF PSCs by blending with the ITIC acceptor.41 In comparison to the low PCE (1.25%) of the P3HT:ITIC-based device, PDCBT:ITIC gave a remarkably high PCE of 10.16%. This was attributed to less geminate and nongeminate charge recombination due to the formation of a better nanoscale morphology in the PDCBT:ITIC blend. F atoms were grafted onto bithiophene to obtain a polymer, PDCBT-2F, with a deeper HOMO level.42 After blending with IT-4F, this device achieved a PCE of 11.9%, with simultaneously improved JSC and FF. Later, the PCE of these types of polymers was increased to 12.38% by employing the Cl atom strategy.43 Due to the electron-withdrawing ability of alkoxycarbonyl thiophene, this building block is very suitable for the development of WBG polymers with deep HOMO levels, which is beneficial to decrease Eloss in the resulting photovoltaic devices. In 2017, we synthesized two conjugated polymers, PB2T and PB3T, which included two alkoxycarbonyl thiophenes with and without a thiophene connection, respectively. Compared to the highly twisted conjugated backbone of PB2T, PB3T has a more planar conjugated backbone, stronger aggregation and π–π stacking. After blending with the electron acceptor IT-M, the PB2T-based device gave a negligible PCE of 0.01%, while the PB3T-based device showed an outstanding PCE of 11.7%.44 Furthermore, we introduced F atoms into the conjugated side chain of BDT and employed the side chain strategy to downshift its HOMO level and optimize the molecular ordering and π–π interaction.45 Finally, more balanced charge transport and reduced recombination were achieved for the P2-based device, and the corresponding PCE of 13.0% was obtained using the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P2:IT-4F/PFN-Br/Al. Interestingly, when the inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/P2:IT-4F/MoO3/Al was employed, the FF of this device significantly improved from 0.70 to 0.76, resulting in an outstanding PCE of 14.2%. The main reason for this is that the inverted device architecture can restrain the bimolecular recombination in the P2:IT-4F blend due to the formation of a P2-enriched layer and IT-4F-enriched layer near the top electrodes and bottom substrates, respectively. Additionally, we developed another polymer (PTQ2), which was composed of alkoxycarbonylthiophene and fluorinated BDT. Compared to P2, the synthetic route for PTQ2 was significantly shorter, and more importantly, this polymer exhibited a superior PCE of 14.7% after blending with the electron acceptor IT-4F.46
Due to the limited solubility of conjugated polymers, PSCs are often fabricated using chlorinated solvents such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB), which are highly detrimental to human health and the environment. Thus, to develop high-performance non-chlorinated solvent-processed NF PSCs, two strategies were employed in our group. The first one is the introduction of large flexible, and conjugated side chains in conjugated polymers to improve their solubility and aggregation in non-chlorinated solvents. For instance, we reported one high-performance polymer via the two-step optimization of different molecular structures.47 Firstly, we used 2-butyloctyl side chains to replace the 2-ethylhexyl in PBDB-T to give the PBDB-T-BO polymer, which exhibited weak aggregation in the non-chlorinated solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF). Secondly, we further enlarged the conjugated side groups and synthesized another new polymer, PBDB-BzT, which exhibited slightly enhanced aggregation in THF compared to PBDB-T-BO. The solubility of these three polymers in THF were evaluated by investigating their surface topographies in THF-processed thin films using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface roughness (Rq) values were 58, 0.8 and 2.1 nm for the THF-processed PBDB-T (3 mg mL−1), PBDB-T-BO (30 mg mL−1) and PBDB-BzT (20 mg mL−1) films, respectively. This suggested that the solubility of the latter two polymers in THF was significantly improved. Finally, the moderate aggregation effect of PBDB-BzT caused its THF-processed blend film to form strong π–π stacking and face-on to edge-on ratio. Thus, this polymer-based PSC achieved a PCE of 12.10%. As a reference, the PBDB-T-based PSC only produced a PCE of 6.41% via THF processing. Another strategy is the development of copolymers. For example, we introduced an alkoxycarbonylthiophene unit into PBDB-TF to obtain a new polymer, T1, which exhibited a broader absorption spectrum, downshifted HOMO level and improved solubility in non-chlorinated solvents compared PBDB-TF. When THF was used to fabricate PSCs, the T1:IT-4F and T1:BTP-4F-12-based devices achieved a PCE of 14.2% and 16.1%, respectively.48,49
After LBG NF acceptors were reported, many WBG polymer donors were also synthesized and prepared by other groups to achieve high-performance PSCs,50–69 and a few new polymer donor-based devices have also achieved PCEs of over 16% thus far.70–74 However, it is still essential to develop new WBG polymer donors with deep HOMO levels for high-performance PSCs.
Molecular design rules for high-performance WBG polymer donors
WBG polymer donors have achieved great success in improving the PCE of PSCs. However, the construction of WBG polymers is rarely discussed compared to LBG conjugated polymers. Considering that most high-performance WBG polymer donors contain the BDT unit, herein, we take the BDT electron-donating unit as an example to discuss the design of WBG polymer donors. To obtain WBG polymer donors, the following two key factors should be considered. Firstly, building blocks with strong quinoid character should be avoided. The bandgap decreases as a function of increasing quinoid structure in conjugated materials due to the destruction of its aromaticity and reduction in its stabilization energy.75 As shown in Fig. 4a, due to the weak quinoid character of the benzene unit, the corresponding polymer, poly(para-phenylene) (PPP), had a large bandgap of 3.2 eV. After the enhancement of the quinoid structure using a thiophene unit, the bandgap of polythiophene (PT) was remarkably reduced to 2.0 eV.76 The BDT-based homo-coupling polymer PBDTT showed a bandgap of 2.13 eV.77 Among the fused thiophene rings, poly(2-decylthieno[3,4-b]thiophene) (PTT) gave a very low bandgap of ∼1.2 eV due to the stabilization of the quinoid character by fusing the aromatic thiophene unit.78 Secondly, strong electron-accepting units should be avoided in BDT-based copolymers. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of a D–A polymer are determined by the LUMO of the electron-accepting moiety and HOMO of the electron-donating moiety, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4b. Strong electron-accepting units will yield very low LUMO energy levels in D–A copolymers, which is beneficial to obtain a low bandgap. For instance, copolymers of perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) with the BDT unit yielded the corresponding bandgaps of 1.74 and 1.63 eV, respectively.79 Meanwhile, the quinoid characters of other building blocks also play a crucial role in the development of BDT-based WBG D–A copolymers. For instance, although the strong quinoid character of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene results in a high LUMO level, the corresponding BDT-based copolymers still exhibited a small optical bandgap of 1.6 eV.80 Besides, the bandgaps of polymers also can be impacted by other factors such as the degree of polymerization, side chain geometry and substitution position and electron donating/accepting functional groups.

Although some active layers have well-matched molecular levels and absorption spectra, they still fail to output the maximum VOC and JSC, thus resulting in a low PCE, which is attributed to their poor phase-separation morphologies. The phase-separation morphology including domain size, degree of intermixing, crystallization, and molecular orientation has a large influence on exciton generation, exciton dissociation, charge transport, charge collection, and recombination, thus determining the PCEs of PSCs.81,82 The planar conjugated backbones of NFAs have similar molecular geometries with polymer donors, which make them more difficult to form favourable BHJ morphologies due to their inefficient orbital overlaps with WBG polymer donors.
To investigate the relationship among polymer structure and self-aggregation in solution, BHJ morphology and photovoltaic performance, we studied the steric hindrance of polymer side chains, polymer backbone conformations, and functional polymer side chains. Firstly, two polymer donors, PBDT-DTN and PIDT-DTN, were designed and synthesized, which have planar conjugated backbones, but remarkable differences in the steric hindrance of their side chains.83 Compared to PIDT-DTN, PBDT-DTN exhibited stronger aggregation in solution due to the smaller steric hindrance of its side chain units (Fig. 5a and b). After blending with ITIC, proper phase-separation was observed in the PBDT-DTN:ITIC film, while there was no phase-separation in the PIDT-DTN:ITIC film (Fig. 5c and d). Therefore, the PBDT-DTN:ITIC-based device gave a PCE of 8.3%, while the PIDT-DTN:ITIC-based device only showed a PCE of 1.1%. Secondly, two conjugated polymers, PBDD4T and PBDD4T-2F, were prepared, which have the same side chains, and the difference of without/with fluorine atoms in their conjugated backbones, respectively.84PBDD4T-2F had a more stable backbone than PBDD4T due to the enhancement of the rotation barrier between the fluorinated thiophenes. Meanwhile, PBDD4T-2F exhibited remarkably enhanced self-aggregation in solution and π–π stacking in the film compared to PBDD4T (Fig. 5e and f). In the PSC devices, the PBDD4T-2F-based device produced a PCE of 8.69%, which was 20 times higher than that of the PBDD4T-based device. The major reason for this is that the PBDD4T-2F:ITIC blend film exhibited phase separation with clear nanoscale fibrils, while the PBDD4T:ITIC blend showed a homogeneous morphology (Fig. 5g and h). This work suggested that the introduction of fluorine atoms in the conjugated backbone is an effective method to enhance self-aggregation in solution and form good phase separation, hence improving the PCEs in PSCs. Thirdly, we designed and synthesized two twisted conjugated polymers, PBDT-3T and PBDT-3TCO, which only differed in without/with carbonyl side chains, respectively.85 Compared to PBDT-3T, PBDT-3TCO exhibited significantly enhanced aggregation in solution due to the existence of inter/intra-molecular interactions between the carbonyl group and thiophene unit (Fig. 5i and j). After blending with an electron acceptor (IT-4F), both blends showed a similar organization, but significantly different BHJ morphologies. The PBDT-3T:IT-4F film did not display phase separation, while the PBDT-3TCO:IT-4F film exhibited good nanoscale bi-continuous phase separation (Fig. 5k and l). Furthermore, the PBDT-3TCO:IT-4F film showed suitable domain sizes (25.8 nm) and high domain purity (1), which were two times higher than that of the PBDT-3TCO:IT-4F film (13 nm and 0.49, respectively). Therefore, the PCE of the PBDT-3TCO:IT-4F-based device was one order of magnitude higher than that of the PBDT-3T:IT-4F-based device. Additionally, we also attempted to enhance the planarity of this type of polymer by replacing thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene between two carbonylated thiophenes.86 The results demonstrated that the planar conjugated polymer exhibited strong aggregation in solution, yielded large aggregation sizes in the active layer, and thus outputted a much lower PCE. These results showed that polymers with weak aggregation in solution yield homogenous BHJ morphologies with small domain sizes and low domain purity. In contrast, polymer donors with strong aggregation in solution produce big domain sizes in BHJ morphologies. Thus, tuning the polymer aggregation in solution is very important for nanoscale phase-separation in BHJ morphologies by rational chemical modification.

Charge separation and non-radiative recombination energy loss in NF PSCs
Traditionally, efficient fullerene-based PSCs require a large driving force (usually > 0.3 eV) to separate the bound excitons at the D/A interfaces.87–89 However, the large driving force produces an additional voltage loss (VOC,loss), which is harmful to achieve a trade-off between the VOC and JSC, thus limiting the improvement of the PCE in PSCs. Recent studies demonstrated that a very small driving force is sufficient for exciton dissociation to obtain high PCEs in NF-based PSCs.10,11,90,91 For instance, we designed three conjugated polymer donors, named PBQ-0F, PBQ-QF, and PBQ-4F, and fabricated PSCs by blending them with ITIC. These polymer donors have similar absorption spectra but gradually downshifted energy levels.10 Surprisingly, although the ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO in the blend of PBQ-4F:ITIC was only 0.04 and 0.24 eV, respectively, which were accurately measured using an ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer, the corresponding device still exhibited efficient hole transfer from ITIC to PBQ-4F, low germinate and bimolecular recombination, yielding a high PCE of 11.34%. To develop high-performance active materials, it is essential to understand the reason for efficient charge generation with negligible driving forces in NF PSCs.
Considering fitting the real charge generation in PSCs with physical modules, several typical fundamental parameters and procedures dominate the photovoltaic process, such as excess energy from the charge-transfer (CT) state,92 relaxed CT state93 energetic disorder,94 and charge delocalization.95 However, the above-mentioned models are not directly related to specific chemical structures. Thus, they cannot provide enough information to guide the design of photoactive materials. This situation improves since WBG donors showing outstanding properties and related investigations are being carried out. Considering the various polymer donors and NFAs, we proposed the combination of electrostatic potential (ESP) and intermolecular electric field (IEF) between the polymer donor and acceptor to study their charge separation.46,96 In conjugated materials, electrons and holes are delocalized on their π-orbits, and exciton dissociation at the interface of the donor/acceptor occurs via the overlap of their orbitals (Fig. 6a). IEF emerges at the interface between donors and acceptors with different ESPs. For instance, only a small driving force existed in the PTO2:IT-4F blend, while the EQE of the corresponding device was high. In contrast, the BHJ of PTO2:PC71BM possessed a larger driving force, but a low EQE. The reason for this exotic phenomenon is the different ESP and strong IEF formed between PTO2 and IT-4F, which assist the exciton or bipolaron dissociation. On the other hand, in the case of the PTQ2:PC71BM blend, an additional electric field is necessary to drive efficient exciton dissociation due to the relatively weak IEF between PTO2 and PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 6b. This finding demonstrated that fine-tuning the ESP in the polymer donor or acceptor will be an important molecular design strategy to boost the PCE of PSCs.qVOC,loss = Egap − qVOC= (Egap − qVSQOC) + (qVSQOC −qVradOC) + (qVradOC − qVOC)= (Egap − qVSQOC) + qVrad,belowgapOC + qVnon-radOC = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3(1)

Although the small driving force has already reduced VOC,loss in a given device, this value is still larger than its competitors, such as perovskite and silicon-based photovoltaic devices. Theoretically, the driving force for charge generation in BHJs can be divided into several physical modules. Recently, extensive studies focusing on the recombination mechanism argued that the energy loss can be classified into radiative and non-radiative routes. Quantitatively, the qVOC, loss can be separated into three parts, as shown in eqn (1), where q is the elementary charge. The first part (ΔE1) of qVOC,loss is the difference between the bandgap and the maximum free energy of the charge carriers (qVSQOC) under the Shockley–Queisser model, which is unavoidable for all solar cells (0.25–0.30 eV).97 The second part (ΔE2) of qVOC,loss accounts for additional radiative recombination from the absorption below the bandgap, which is directly related to the CT state. For instance, the classic PTB7:PCBM-based device gave a large qVrad,belowgapOC of 0.20 eV, while the small driving force active material of P3TEA:SF-PDI2 only showed a very small qVrad,belowgapOC of 0.07 eV.11 The last part (ΔE3) of qVOC,loss is due to non-radiative recombination, which can be calculated as qVnon-radOC = −kTln(EQEEL), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and EQEEL is the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the solar cell when charge carriers are injected into the device under dark conditions. Due to the low EQEEL (10−5–10−8) of BHJ blends, the ΔE3 of high-performance PSCs is usually located in the range of 0.30–0.48 eV, which is much higher than that of the highly efficient inorganic solar cells (0.04–0.21 eV).97 It should be noted that a small ΔE3 of 0.09 eV in an organic photovoltaic cell was also reported by carefully selecting the active materials, but this device gave an extremely low PCE of 0.085% with a VOC of 2.13 V, JSC of 0.2 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.20.98 This work showed that there is still big possibility to reduce ΔE3. Considering the limited modulation of ΔE1 and ΔE2 for small driving force PSCs, the reduction of ΔE3via molecular modification will be very important for the improvement of VOC in a given device.
Recently, some researchers have proven that the addition of a third component into the active layer to optimize the BHJ morphologies can reduce the VOC,loss in the resulting ternary PSCs.99–103 For instance, we reported a small molecule (NRM-1, see Fig. 3) with a large bandgap (2.74 eV), which was added to the active layer of PBDB-T and IT-4F.104 When the weight ratio of NRM-1 increased from 0 to 1.5, the EQEEL of the device improved from 2.0 × 10−7 to 5.0 × 10−6 (Table 2). The corresponding ΔE1 and ΔE2 had slight changes, while ΔE3 was remarkably reduced from 0.39 to 0.32 eV. The main reason for this is that the addition of NRM-1 to the active layer restrained the aggregation of IT-4F, thus enhancing the EQEEL of the PBDB-T:IT-4F:NRM-1 blend. Besides, we also modified the end group of the low band gap acceptor using Cl (BTP-4Cl) atoms to replace the F atoms (BTP-4F). The corresponding ΔE3 decreased from 0.230 to 0.206 eV as the EQEEL increased from 1.40 × 10−4 to 3.47 × 10−4.105 The PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl-based device gave a higher PCE of 16.5% than that of the PBDB-TF:BTP-4F-based device (15.6%) due to the enhanced VOC. It is worth mentioning that the highly efficient PSCs with a low ΔE3 are mainly attributed to the high EQEEL of the LWG acceptors, while WBG polymer donors have relatively low EQEEL. Thus, to further lower the ΔE3, it is essential to deeply understand the mechanism for the reduction in ΔE3 to develop novel WBG polymer donors with high EQEEL.

Conclusions and outlook
WBG polymer donors have been proven to be a type of BHJ material with great important for boosting the photovoltaic efficiencies of devices. In this feature article, we mainly discussed our recent efforts on the development of high-performance WBG polymer donors. Based on rational design and precise synthesis, the WBG polymer donors exhibited well-matched absorption spectra and molecular energy levels with LBG NFA. Moreover, their unique chemical structures gave the WBG polymer donors outstanding rheological and morphological properties, which depressed the energy loss during charge generation in the WBG donor-containing BHJs. Benefitting from the abovementioned advantages in the absorption spectra of the WBG polymer donors, the corresponding devices also exhibited great potential for other applications, such as ternary and tandem devices.99,106–109 Particularly, the potential of PSCs in indoor applications was exploited recently owing to their highly tunable absorption spectra, which well-matched the emission spectra (400–700 nm) of fluorescent lamps and light-emitting diodes. Theoretically, PSCs have a higher PCE than silicon-based solar cells under indoor light.110 We used PBDB-TF and IO-4Cl to fabricate a device, and achieved a record PCE of 26.1% and excellent stability under an intensity of 1000 lux. There is still potential for further improvement toward the predicted efficiency of over 40% based on the innovation of conjugated materials.111 Therefore, the development of novel WBG polymer donors is highly important for PSCs.
Although WBG polymer donors have exhibited remarkable achievements in improving device efficiency and great potential applications in tandem, ternary and indoor solar cells, there are still many challenges for the commercialization of PSCs. (1) Most high-performance WBG polymer donors include modified BDT units, which from the viewpoint of synthetic cost, are difficult to commercialize for large-scale production. Considering the highly desirable low-cost and high-performance WBG polymer donors, corresponding molecular design strategies should be developed. (2) Aggregated polymer donors can form a favourable BHJ morphology with NFAs, but the basic mechanisms of the material interactions between the polymer donor and NFA are still unclear. Thus, thorough understanding of the intermolecular interactions between the donor and acceptor is required to fine-tune the BHJ morphology for the further improvement of device performance and stability. (3) The mechanisms of charge generation between the polymer donor and NFA under a small driving force should be deeply studied. If possible, the relationship between chemical structure and ΔE3 should be established because the exploration of the minimized ΔE3 and Eloss without sacrificing JSC and FF in NF PSCs is of great importance to achieve the maximum PCE in PSCs. (4) The stability of NF PSCs needs to be systematically studied. Considering that the intrinsic difference in photovoltaic materials between NF PSCs and commercial silicon solar cells, the stability of the BHJ morphology due to the diffusion of adjacent molecules and the stability of photovoltaic materials due to UV light irradiation should be deeply investigated and clearly understood. Once these key challenges are addressed, NF PSCs will have a bright future for commercialization.
