    , Accepted 14th April 2015First published on 15th April 2015AbstractNew alternating copolymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and thieno[3,4-d]thiazole derivatives have been synthesized by using different combinations of side chains and spacers in order to study their effect on the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. Optical and electrochemical characterization were performed and the resulting copolymers exhibit optical bandgaps ranging from 1.66 to 1.80 eV, HOMO energy levels between −5.19 and −5.30 eV and LUMO energy levels between −3.60 and −3.72 eV. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated and characterized after a careful optimization of the active layer fabrication by using different solvents, additives and acceptors. Following this process, PCEs up to 4.4% were obtained.
Introduction
Although recent progress has been made into harvesting energy from the sun to efficiently produce electricity, there are still many challenges to overcome before having a reliable and cost-effective technology. In this regard, organic solar cells have attracted a lot of attention due to their easy processability, low cost of manufacturing and flexibility. Up to now, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in excess of 10%1–3 for single junction solar cells, up to 10.8%4–8 for tandem solar cells and up to 11.8%9,10 for triple junction solar cells have been reported. A major part of this progress has been accomplished by the synthesis of new p-type conjugated polymers. Push–pull alternating copolymers have shown to be a convenient method to tune the HOMO-LUMO energy levels. Moreover, it is also possible to tune the acceptor used in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer to optimise the power conversion efficiency. [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) has been one of the first acceptor to be utilized to obtain good efficiencies. [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) has also been used to improve the absorption in the low wavelength region. More recently, other derivatives of fullerenes have started to be utilized in high efficiency solar cells. For instance, indene-C61 bisadduct (IC61BA) and indene-C71 bisadduct (IC71BA) have shown to significantly increase the open-circuit current in the photovoltaic devices. While the use of ICBA enhances the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in comparison to PCBM, very few examples have been reported where the PCE has been higher with ICBA than with PCBM.11,12
Along these lines, thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (TTz), a new electron-deficient unit for organic photovoltaic, has been used to synthesize new π-conjugated push–pull polymers. Copolymers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and TTz have demonstrated interesting photovoltaic properties with power conversion efficiencies up to 2.5%.13,14 One may believe that these low PCEs were mainly due to the relatively high-lying HOMO energy level of the polymers which led to Voc of about 0.6 V for these BDT-TTz derivatives. To address this problem, new copolymers based on TTz in combination with different electron-poor or electron-rich monomers were first synthesized. It was found that the tuning of the HOMO levels of TTz polymers by using different electron-poor or electron-rich units was somewhat inefficient.15 In some cases, it has been possible to lower the HOMO energy levels but the physical properties (poor solubility and low molecular weights) of the resulting polymers were not compatible with photovoltaic applications. Since it was difficult to efficiently tune the HOMO energy levels of the TTz derivatives, new BDT-TTz derivatives with thiophene spacers and different alkyl chain combinations to optimize the solubility of the resulting polymers have been synthesized. This approach using thiophene spacers and different alkyl chains could vary the optical and electronic properties of the polymers and the morphology of the active layer.16,17 Along these lines, and in order to increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc), a BDT derivative bearing alkylthienyl side chains was used since there are known to decrease the HOMO energy level compared to the BDT with alkoxy side chains.18–20 Finally, to increase the Voc in the photovoltaic devices, a different acceptor (IC61BA) was also used in the fabrication of the BHJ active layer. Herein, we report the synthesis of six polymers based on BDT and TTz derivatives and their photovoltaic properties.
Synthesis of the monomers
Two new TTz derivatives were designed as illustrated in Fig. 1. One (compound 4) with the central TTz moiety with a straight alkyl chain and flanked with two thiophene units bearing alkyl side chains to ensure good solubility and another one (compound 6) with the central TTz moiety with a branched alkyl chain flanked with two unsubsituted thiophene units. The branched alkyl chain on the TTz moiety was placed to ensure good solubility of the resulting copolymer. The synthesis of 4,6-dibromo-2-octylthieno[3,4-d]thiazole (1) and 2-(pentadecan-7-yl)thieno[3,4-d]thiazole (2) was done accordingly to the existing literature.15,21 Stille couplings between compound 1 and 1-(trimethylstannyl)-2-octylthiophene gave compound 3 and was subsequently brominated with NBS to give the desired compound 4. Compound 6 was obtained by the same general procedure from a Stille coupling of compound 2 with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene to afford compound 5, which was also brominated with NBS. The detailed procedures are described in the ESI.† It should be noted that relatively low yields obtained for compounds 3–6 are mainly due to difficult purification processes.

Synthesis of the polymers
Six polymers have been synthesized by combining either 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(ethylhexyl-oxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (7) or 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2′-ethylhexylthiophene)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (8) with compound 1, 4 or 6. The polymerizations have been conducted under Stille coupling conditions. Equimolar ratio of both monomers, 2% of Pd2dba3 and 8% of triphenylarsine (AsPh3) were combined in dried and oxygen-free toluene. All polymers have been characterized by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) based on monodisperse polystyrene standards in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 110 °C. The number-average molecular weight values obtained by SEC measurements for P1 to P6 vary between 14 and 32 kg mol−1. Synthetic pathways are shown in Fig. 2 and detailed in the ESI† while all the molecular weights are available in Table 1.

Optical and electrochemical properties
Solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra and cyclic voltammograms of polymers P1 to P6 are shown in Fig. 3 and 4. Individual UV-vis spectra and voltammograms are reported in the ESI.† The solid-state UV-vis absorption spectrum of P1 shows two absorption peaks at 578 nm and 630 nm with an estimated bandgap of 1.83 eV while cyclic voltammetry exhibits HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.30 eV and −3.60 eV respectively. P2 exhibits absorption peaks at 564 nm and 610 nm with an estimated bandgap of 1.83 eV with HOMO and LUMO energy level of −5.22 eV and −3.65 eV. In the case of P3, the solid-state UV-vis spectrum shows also two absorption peaks at 568 nm and 612 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.80 eV. Cyclic voltammetry of P3 exhibits a HOMO energy level of −5.24 eV and a LUMO energy level of −3.72 eV.

 Fig. 4  Solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra and cyclic voltammograms of P4 to P6. 

P4 displays a solid-state UV-vis absorption spectrum with two absorption peaks at 605 nm and 655 nm with an estimated bandgap of 1.72 eV while cyclic voltammetry reveals HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.23 eV and −3.69 eV, respectively. P5 shows an absorption peak at 572 nm with an estimated bandgap of 1.77 eV with HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.19 eV and −3.66 eV. In the case of P6, the spectrum shows also two absorption peaks at 585 nm and 631 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.76 eV. Cyclic voltammetry of P6 shows a HOMO energy level of −5.24 eV and a LUMO energy level of −3.63 eV. Based on the solid-state UV-vis absorption spectrum, it seems that the addition of thiophene spacers on the TTz moiety has very little or no effect on the optical properties of the resulting polymers. In addition, based on the spectroscopic measurements, it seems that the utilization of two different BDT derivatives does not have a significant effect on the optical properties of the polymers. On the other hand, electrochemical characterizations seem to show that the utilization of a BDT unit with thiophene side chains increases the HOMO energy level of the resulting copolymer compared to the BDT with alkoxy side chains which is unexpected considering the existing literature.19 In fact, according to that literature, the utilization of the thiophene side chains instead of the alkoxy side chains should slightly decrease the HOMO energy level. In our case, these contradictory results could be explained by the difficulty to precisely determine the HOMO energy level by solid-state cyclic voltammetry. Optical bandgaps, electrochemical bandgaps and HOMO and LUMO energy levels are summarized in Table 1.
Photovoltaic properties
The six polymers have been studied in blends with PC71BM and IC61BA and used as photoactive layers in photovoltaic devices using a classical configuration consisting of an indium-tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) transparent electrode and an LiF/Al reflective electrode with the active layer sandwiched in between. Each polymer has been optimized by studying the donor–acceptor ratio, the processing solvent, the use of additive and the layer thickness. In this study, IC61BA has been used to increase the Voc of the device due to its higher LUMO energy level. However, the use of IC61BA has also been reported to have some drawbacks like the fact that the Voc increase is often accompanied by a decrease of the photocurrent. One factor for the photocurrent loss is the lower absorption of the IC61BA comparatively to the PC71BM, but it has also been shown that the use of fullerene multiadducts leads to a loss in charge generation efficiency and to a reduced charge carrier collection efficiency.22 In this study, in some cases, the Voc gain is enough to counterbalance the photocurrent losses but, in other cases, the photocurrent loss is too important to be compensated by the increased Voc. The optimized processing conditions and photovoltaic performance of the six polymers for each acceptor used (PC71BM or IC61BA) are shown in Table 2. J–V curves and EQE measurements of P1 and P4 are shown in Fig. 5. The other J–V curves and EQE measurements can be found in the ESI.† Generally, blends were made of a 1:2 ratio of polymer:acceptor mixed in chloroform unless otherwise indicated.

After optimization, P1 shows best results when blended with IC61BA and 2% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). Compared to the results obtained in the same conditions with PC71BM, we observed an increase of the Voc (0.54 V to 0.77 V) and FF (0.54 to 0.56) and a decrease of the JSC from 9.74 mA cm−2 to 7.27 mA cm−2, for an overall PCE of 3.1% instead of 2.7% with PC71BM. In the case of P2, the use of PC71BM or IC61BA led to very similar results after optimization. Even with the significant Voc gain of 0.58 V to 0.74 V when using IC61BA, the loss in photocurrent and fill factor led to optimized PCE of 1.8% with PC71BM and 1.8% with ICBA. For polymer P3, once again, the use of IC61BA led to a significant increase of the Voc from 0.47 V to 0.73 V but also an increase of the FF from 0.53 to 0.56. These two gains were sufficient to counterbalance the Jsc loss from the use of IC61BA (9.79 mA cm−2 to 6.84 mA cm−2) to obtain a PCE of 2.8% compared to 2.4% with PC71BM. For P4, the use of PC71BM has shown better results. After optimization, a Jsc of 10.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.66 V and a FF of 0.61 for an overall PCE of 4.4% were measured. While using IC61BA, better Voc of the order of 0.85 V accompanied by a very significant photocurrent loss to 6.28 mA cm−2 leading to a much lower PCE of 2.3% was obtained. It is also important to note that the results with PC71BM were obtained without the use of any additive. During the optimization, we observed that when the drying time of the active layer was increased by the use of an additive, the photocurrent and fill factor was significantly decreased leading to lower PCEs. The creation of non-optimal morphologies while using an additive is probably the cause of the poor photovoltaic performances. With 10% of o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) as an additive, the PCE dropped to 3.5% and then to 1.6% with the use of 2% DIO as an additive. In the case of P5, better results were also obtained while using PC71BM. Even with a low Voc of 0.49 V, a PCE of 2.6% was achieved. When blended with ICBA, P5 showed an increased Voc of 0.71 but, the photocurrent was almost reduced by 50% with a Jsc of 5.43 mA cm−2. For P6, the polymer also showed better results when blended with PC71BM with a PCE of 3.1%. Once again, IC61BA led to an increase in the Voc from 0.58 V to 0.74 V while the Jsc decreased from 9.90 mA cm−2 to 7.06 mA cm−2 for an overall lower PCE of 2.8%. While looking back to all these results, it is possible to observe that the addition of thiophene spacers did not have a positive effect on the performance. Effectively, in both polymer series, P1 to P3 and P4 to P6, the polymers without thiophene spacers, P1 and P4, showed the best results. These results also revealed that better performances are obtained with polymers based on the TTz unit having thiophene spacers without alkyl chains. In addition, when one compares polymers having the same TTz unit but copolymerized with the two different BDT, results shows that the BDT unit with thiophene side-chain exhibit, in all cases, a better performance. It is also interesting to point out that the use of the BDT with thiophene side-chain led to a significant increase of the Voc for P4vs. P1 and for P6vs. P3 and a significant decrease for P5vs. P2. While the polymer structures are very similar, it seems that a subtle change in their structure can lead to different electronic behaviors.
Conclusion
Six BDT-TTz polymers were synthesized and incorporated into solution-processed solar cells with PC71BM or IC61BA to give PCE up to 4.4%. The polymers possess fairly similar optical and electrochemical properties. The incorporation of thiophene spacers on the TTz moiety does not have a significant effect on the optical properties of the polymers. In contrary, the utilization of two different BDT derivatives seems to have some influence on the polymer properties. Two different acceptors, PC71BM and IC61BA, were also used in the fabrication of the blends. After a careful optimization of the processing solvent and additives with both acceptors, we have been able to obtain PCEs ranging between 1.7% and 4.4%. IC61BA has been a helpful candidate to increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device but, in some cases, this gain was not sufficient to counter the photocurrent loss generated by its utilisation instead of PC71BM. Finally, after reviewing the results, the incorporation of thiophene spacers into the polymer moiety does not improve the device performances.
