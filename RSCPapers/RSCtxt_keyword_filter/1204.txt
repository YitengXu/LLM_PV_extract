    , Accepted 1st May 2014First published on 2nd May 2014AbstractHere we report that organo-lead halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx solution can be used as a new liquid electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). We find that the presence of inorganic octahedra of [PbX6]4− (X = I or Cl, or a combination of them) in this perovskite solution can not only remarkably improve the device stability but also enhance the photo-response of DSCs.
Solid-state lead halide perovskite films, used as either sensitizers1–4 or hole collectors5–7 in solid-state solar cells (SSCs) or heterojunction solar cells, have attracted intensive attention. Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials combine the advantageous characteristics of crystalline inorganic solids with those of organic molecules within a molecular-scale composite. It endows the hybrid materials with structure flexibility, special magnetic, electrical and optical properties, and solution processability.8 It has been reported that thermal annealing conditions can largely affect the crystallization and morphology of the solution-processed perovskite thin films, and finally greatly influence the performance of SSCs based on perovskite as absorbers.9 However, properties of lead halide perovskites in solutions at room temperature have been much less studied, and how these perovskites exist and behave under liquid conditions is not clear.
In this work, we address this question by firstly studying their optical properties. CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx solution was prepared by mixing CH3NH3I and PbCl2 in a molar ratio of 3:1 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent according to ref. 2. The formation of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx perovskite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (see ESI†). It is known that PbI2 has different solubilities in water and DMF. In water, PbI2 salt is dissociated into Pb2+ and I− ions, while in DMF solvent, [PbI6]4− octahedra are formed and at the edges of these octahedra, two iodine atoms are replaced by oxygen atoms from DMF, which is denoted as solvated PbI2·DMF.10 Because PbI2 in water and DMF exhibit different absorbance spectra, therefore, to define the possible formation of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx in DMF, the absorbance spectra of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx–DMF solution were studied by UV-Vis characterization in comparison with CH3NH3I–DMF, PbI2–DMF and PbI2–water (Fig. 1). It can be seen that the UV-Vis spectrum of 3.3 mM PbI2–DMF resembles an absorbance spectrum of 10 mM CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx that contains a 3.3 mM lead halide precursor in DMF. In comparison, absorbance spectra of PbI2–water and CH3NH3I–DMF exhibit totally different properties from that of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx–DMF solution. Note that because of very strong absorbance of solutions of S1, S2, S4, and S5, the intensities of these samples have exceeded the up-limitation of the UV-Vis spectrometer. As discussed above, PbI2 salt is dissociated into Pb2+ and I− in water, and CH3NH3I is dissociated into CH3NH3+ and I− ions in DMF, thus, it can be concluded that lead and halide in CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx–DMF do not exist as free Pb2+ and I− ions but as inorganic octahedra, [PbX6]4− (X = I or Cl, or a combination of them).
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis spectra of 1 M CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx–DMF (S1), 100 mM CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx–DMF (S2), 100 mM CH3NH3I–DMF (S3), 10 mM CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx–DMF (S4), 3.3 mM PbI2–DMF (S5) and saturated PbI2–water (S6). 
By adjusting the solution concentration of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx–DMF, it is found that at low concentration, the solution is yellowish, transparent and stable (1 M in DMF), while increasing the concentration (2 M in DMF) leads to the formation of a gel-like structure (photos in Scheme 1). Based on the UV-Vis study and observation of the solutions, we speculate that the inorganic parts, [PbX6]4−, are mostly isolated and largely surrounded by organic parts and the DMF solvent at low concentration whereas the inorganic octahedra might get connected with each other by sharing the same halide to form larger clusters when the concentration goes higher; eventually the solution is transformed into a gel. Scheme 1 proposes the possible constitution changes of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx in DMF. To make things straightforward, the interactions between the inorganic parts and the DMF molecules are not expressed.

In the following, we try to determine the impact of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx–DMF on the electric properties of the solution. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were chosen for this test because of the relatively facile fabrication process and comparatively good understanding of their working mechanisms.11–14 DSCs based on the iodine electrolyte have been fully researched, and the redox mediators of I−/I3− have been identified as being responsible for the regeneration of the dye.15 Because of the iodide containing nature of the lead halide perovskite, it would be quite interesting to investigate how such perovskite behaves as an electrolyte in DSCs. We also use its precursor CH3NH3I in DMF under the same DSC assembly conditions for comparison. Photovoltaic studies given in the ESI† show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CH3NH3I-DSCs rapidly declines from 4.14% to below 1% merely in ten minutes due to the fast decrease of short-circuit current density (Jsc) under illumination. However, CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs exhibit considerably better stability. As shown in Fig. 2, in the first 100 hours, only a slight decrease in PCE of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs is observed. Our understanding on the CH3NH3I-based electrolyte is that free I− ions could be firstly oxidized to In−, and then to Im− (n < m).16 Thus during the working process of CH3NH3I-DSCs, Im− can be depleted instantly and cannot be generated quickly enough, as a result the excited dye cannot be effectively reduced to their ground states,17 which subsequently leads to diminished current density. In contrast, the stable PCE performance in the DSCs assembled with the CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx electrolyte highlights the unique roles of inorganic species of [PbX6]4− in CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx solution. It is observed that the stability of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs also is better than that of DSCs based on the conventional iodine electrolyte (I2-DSCs), which is mainly attributed to the less volatile property of the solvent used in the CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx electrolyte.

Another role of the inorganic part of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx is revealed by the photovoltaic (PV) features of the DSCs. Fig. 3 and Table 1 present the PV characteristics of optimized CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs and I2-DSCs. Influences of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx concentrations, additives and film thickness of photoanodes on the performance of DSCs are given in the ESI.† The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs and I2-DSCs shows that the typical IPCE peak of N719-sensitized solar cells in wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 350 nm is absent in CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs present enhanced IPCE in wavelengths ranging from 350 nm to 500 nm. It is uncertain whether the missed IPCE peak from 300 nm to 360 nm is due to back transfer of photo-generated electrons from the N719 dye to the CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx electrolyte or due to the reason that the excited states of N719 molecules by high energies cannot be effectively reduced to their ground states by the CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx electrolyte.

The enhancement of IPCE for CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs in certain wavelength ranges is of more interest to us. As detected by UV-Vis (Fig. 4), light absorbance reveals that for the mixture of N719 and CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx solution, absorbance features of N719 are retained, and more importantly, the absorbance is highly enhanced, even though 10 mM of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx solution barely exhibit any absorbance in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 700 nm. On the other hand, the absorbance of the mixtures of N719 and iodine electrolyte does not show noticeable interaction between them at all. This difference reiterates the obvious interplays between N719 dye and CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx solution. In fact, it has been reported that organic cations in dye molecules can be incorporated between the MX42− (M = Sn or Pb; X = Cl, Bri, or I) perovskite sheets.8 Nevertheless, the charge/energy transfer between TiO2 photoanodes, N719 and methylammonium lead halide perovskite is still not clear. It is possible that the light absorbance of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx that are adsorbed onto TiO2 photoanodes can transfer photo-induced electrons to TiO2 photoanodes directly or they could enhance the absorbance of the N719 sensitizer to contribute to photocurrent indirectly. IPCE of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs without any N719 dye loaded on TiO2 photoanodes is given in Fig. S7.† It can be seen that a small value (∼25%) is observed at wavelengths around 350 nm. Because TiO2 nanoparticles also exhibit absorbance in the wavelength below 400 nm,18 we cannot conclude that the IPCE value at 350 nm given in Fig. S7† is contributed to light absorbance of the methylammonium lead halide perovskite electrolyte. But the other peak, even though it has a smaller value, centred at 750 nm should be contributed to photo-induced electrons of the CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx electrolyte that inject into the conduction band of TiO2 photoanodes.

On the ground of above observations, we tend to conclude that the contribution to photocurrent in CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs by the CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx electrolyte should be majorly come from its interactions with the sensitizer. To better understand this issue, the possible interactions between N719 dye and other lead halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3) are also detected by UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S8†). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization reveals new absorbance peaks for CH3NH3PbICl2, CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 powders after mixing with N719 dye, indicating the formation of new bonds (Fig. S9†). Yet further investigation is still needed to determine the molecule forces between the sensitizer and methylammonium lead halide perovskites in the future work.
Conclusions
In summary, we found that the inorganic octahedra species of [PbX6]4− in methylammonium lead halide perovskite in a new role of an electrolyte can significantly improve the stability of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs, compared with DSCs using CH3NH3I as an electrolyte. Compared with DSCs based on the well-studied iodine electrolyte with I−/I3− as redox shuttles, charge/energy transfer between TiO2 photoanodes, the N719 sensitizer and the methylammonium lead halide perovskite electrolyte has resulted in enhanced IPCE of CH3NH3PbI(3−x)Clx-DSCs in some wavelengths. In addition to the established roles of organo-lead halide perovskites as either solid-state sensitizers or hole collector, the findings reported herein add new functionalities to the library of this class of perovskites. Further fundamental understanding of this new solution system in regard to interactions between the dye sensitizer and perovskites is a worthwhile investigation in the future.
