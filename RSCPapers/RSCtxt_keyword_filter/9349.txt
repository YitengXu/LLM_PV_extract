    , Accepted 27th September 2022First published on 27th September 2022AbstractWith the rapid development of materials applications, the limitation of a single layer material has become more apparent and its intrinsic properties can no longer satisfy the growing demand. The construction of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is an effective way to address this issue. Here, the heterostructure stability, excitation transfer mechanism, carrier mobility and multiple energy conversion performance of MoTe2/As stacking have been studied using first-principles calculations. Binding energy and AIMD simulation analyses show that the ductile, type-II indirect band gap MoTe2/As heterostructure acquires satisfactory thermal stability along with a small lattice mismatch of 1.5%, a high carrier mobility (up to 736.06 cm2 V−1 s−1), a high solar absorbance on the 105 cm−1 order across the infrared-ultraviolet region, a spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) exceeding 30% and a large built-in electric field at the interface, rendering this heterostructure suitable for nanoscale optoelectronics applications. Under optimal hole doping, the calculated electronic transport parameters reveal a combined moderate figure of merit (ZT > 0.6) and an impressive power factor (PF > 48.0 mW m−1 K−2) at a temperature of above 700 K. More remarkably, the heterostructure has band edge positions straddling the water redox potential for pH scale of 0–4 under a 4% biaxial compressive strain, which leads to commercially compliant solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy conversion efficiencies of 30%. These results provide a clear underlying description of the potential of a MoTe2/As heterojunction as a multifunctional energy material.
1. Introduction
When discussing some of the major challenges faced by global populations nowadays, matters associated with an ecosystem and energy are always at the top of the list. While leaders and scientists all over the world have demonstrated the inclination towards the use of environmentally friendly and renewable energy sources, through the establishment of various protocols,1 an effective and optimized energy supply scheme will be difficult to realize without improving the energy conversion efficiency of the existing technologies. Apart from generating electricity from clean sources, an efficient technology must also be one that can trap and salvage waste heat.2–5 However, the characterization of materials with multifunctional energy conversion ability while retaining their longstanding durability and low cost remains unresolved, as it is always a difficult task to rationally engineer the surface strain and electronic structure tuning via the sole experimental trial and error, which often involves high temperature sintering.6 The requirement for the highly specified materials characteristic and the emergence of complicated materials with enhanced technological potentialities make the sole empirical-driven approach even less efficient.
Fortunately, the rapid innovative development of computational methods and the groundwork set by the discoveries of Janus monolayers7–12 and graphene13,14 have facilitated enormous progression in the theoretical investigation of two-dimensional (2D) materials, which have over the years been earmarked as high performance energy materials owing to their numerous fascinating physical properties. Nevertheless, the 2D materials are not without their flaws. For instance, these materials usually possess a relatively large band gap due to their quantum confinement, inferior mechanical strength and fast carrier recombination caused by extensive overlapping of wave functions between holes and electrons. In this regard, the formation of the heterostructure through vertical stacking of two or more 2D materials provides an interesting way of regulating the electronic properties, thus reducing the negative impacts resulting from drawbacks within individual monolayers and leading to novel properties. The limelight of this approach is the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures involving various combinations of unary, binary and ternary transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),15–18 owing to their exceptional and tunable light absorbing properties.
In contrast, layered materials are viewed as a new generation energy converter such as highly efficient thermoelectric (TE) generators, photovoltaic cells and photocatalysts. In particular, TE technology has been widely investigated due to its promising nature for sustainable growth, where waste heat is being recovered and converted to electricity. The suitability of a material as a TE generator is measured by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = σS2T/(κl + κe) and power factor PF = σS2, where σ, S, T, κl and κe are the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, operating temperature, lattice thermal conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity, respectively. Optimizing the efficiency of TE materials is extremely challenging due to the strong inverse interconnections between σ, S and κe, in which σ and κe naturally increase when S decreases and vice versa. Therefore, electronic property modulation via heterostructure engineering is a desirable method for realizing TE materials with a balanced ZT and PF. To accomplish a high-efficiency energy converter source, a desirable bandgap is necessary. 2D molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) is a unique material that has an optical bandgap of around 1.1 eV19 which is bordering on the silicon bandgap, making it almost transparent for silicon. Arsenene (As) is also interesting due to its strain sensitive electronic behavior20 and characterization at room temperature.21 Hence, the formation of the heterostructure from these two materials is likely to produce ultrathin devices with improved performance.
Through first-principles calculations, Huang et al.22 have hypothetically realized the MoTe2/As design and demonstrated its electronic properties tunability by an electric field. However, other parameters crucial for describing its synthesizability and energy conversion capability, namely the thermal stability, absorption coefficient, carrier relaxation time, mobility, exciton energy and effect of strain, remain unexplored. Inspired by these points, within the density functional theory (DFT) framework, we revisited the structural and electronic properties of the MoTe2/As heterostructure, in addition to evaluating its hitherto unidentified thermodynamic stability, mechanical performance, solar cell power conversion efficiency, STH and thermoelectric properties. The studied structure is an indirect band gap material which exhibits an effective separation of electron–hole pairs through its type-II band alignment formation and high SLME, strengthening its position for photovoltaic applications. Upon strain-induced band gap broadening, MoTe2/As is able to oxidize H2O/O2 and reduce H+/H2 at various pH values.
While there have been a myriad of experimental and theoretical studies reporting the bifunctional potentials involving the MoTe2 heterostructure such as HfS2/MoTe2, PtS2/MoTe2 and ReS2/MoTe2,23–25 to name a few, none have demonstrated the combined photovoltaic, photocatalytic and thermoelectric trifunctionality. In contrast, findings obtained in this work indicate that MoTe2/As exhibits a superior optical absorption coefficient, SLME and STH conversion efficiency in the visible light region. The bifunctionality together with a combined moderate ZT and ultrahigh PF owing to its high carrier mobility make MoTe2/As a promising candidate as trifunctional materials for photovoltaic, photocatalytic and thermoelectric applications, highlighting its versatility. Thus, the theoretical findings herein could be useful for experimental researchers in designing specific applications of the MoTe2/As vdW heterostructure material.
2. Computational methods
In this work, the structural optimization, electronic properties and linear optical response calculations were performed using first principles within the context of DFT, based on a projector augmented wave (PAW)26 scheme, as provided by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).27,28 The plane wave basis cut-off energy and convergence criteria was set as 600 eV. The full relaxation of an atomic position was obtained when convergence of the Hellmann–Feynman force and energy reached below 10−3 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. Integration within the Brillouin zone was sampled with the Γ-centered 6 × 6 × 1 k-point grid and later increased to 12 × 12 × 1 for electronic and optical response calculations. To address the weak, interlayer vdW interaction, we implemented the DFT-D3 method of Grimme.29 A vacuum spacing of 30 Å was added along the vertical direction to prevent the periodically recurring images from interacting. Mo (4p64d55s1), Te (5s25p4) and As (3d104s24p3) were selected as the valence electron configurations. To address the underestimation of the band gap using the PBE functional, the band gap of MoTe2/As was recalculated using the HSE06 functional.30 The increment was added as a scissor shift for subsequent transport and optical calculations. To eliminate the possibility of an unintentional electrostatic field between the periodic structure, a dipole correction was performed. For the comparison of the band edge alignment, the vacuum level is set as the energy reference (0 eV).
The transport parameters were evaluated using the BoltzTrap code,31 based on the linearized Boltzmann transport equation within rigid band approximation, which assumes that only the Fermi energy is altered while the band structure of investigated compounds remains unperturbed during the change in the electron concentration. The optical properties of the heterostructure were investigated using blended DFT and Bethe–Salpeter (BSE)32 calculations, solving the Casida equation with a 16 × 16 × 1 grid, 10−8 eV electronic energy convergence, Gaussian smearing and scissor shift inclusion. The force constants were evaluated by applying density generalized perturbation theory (DFPT) on a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell, under strict convergence criteria of 10−8 eV. The phonon dispersion and phonon density of states were later obtained by processing the atomic forces using the PHONOPY33 code.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Stability and electronic structure of the MoTe2/As heterostructure
In the current work, the monolayer As was stacked on top of the monolayer MoTe2 to form the MoTe2/As heterostructure, as epitomized by the relaxed structure in Fig. 1. The optimized lattice constants for constituents As, MoTe2 and MoTe2/As heterostructure are a = b = 3.607, a = b = 3.512 and a = b = 3.552 Å,22 respectively, agreeing well with earlier studies and bringing about the small lattice mismatch of 1.5%, which is much smaller than the normally tolerable maximum epitaxial growth value of 5%.34 The calculated band gaps at the HSE06 level for monolayers As and MoTe2 are 2.29 and 2.28 eV, respectively, which show close agreement with the results from earlier work.35,36 To assess the stability of the proposed configuration, the binding energy Eb was calculated using the following formula: (1)where EMoTe2/As, EMoTe2, EAs and S are the energies of the MoTe2/As heterostructure, monolayer MoTe2, monolayer As and interface area, respectively. The obtained Eb of −23.74 meV Å−2 is negative and fairly small, indicating good stability. Moreover, its optimized interlayer distance of 3.18 Å, is larger than the 2.55 Å sum of the radii for As–Te pairing, exemplifying that the distance between constituent monolayers exceeds the chemical bonding length for the neighboring two atoms or highly possible absence of the As–Te covalent bond in the hybrid structures and confirming the presence of the weak vdW interaction at the interface.

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations were carried out to verify the thermal stability of the studied heterostructure, in which the NVT ensemble37 was adopted to stabilize the heterostructure at 300 K for 15 ps and a time step of 1 fs. It can be observed from Fig. 2(a) that the total energy displays a convergence state by time and fluctuates minimally within a small energy window, and structure that remains intact at the end of annealing, implying its robust thermal stability. Electrostatic potential analysis in Fig. 2(c) reveals huge potential decreases (ΔV) which can induce a large built-in electric field through the interface, pointing to MoTe2 from As driving the electron transfer in the opposite way, and subsequently promote the segregation of photogenerated carriers before achieving dynamic equilibrium. Charge density difference (Δρ) is another useful parameter for explaining the stability of the heterostructure and assessing the interfacial carrier generation efficiency in the vdW heterostructure. Fig. 2(d) signifies that Δρ, calculated using (ΔρMoTe2/As) − (ρMoTe2 + ρAs), is indicative of charge accumulation (yellow zone) near the monolayer As while the charge depletion (blue zone) is noted around MoTe2. This finding is consistent with the Bader analysis38 in Table 1, where 0.0011|e| is transferred to the monolayer As. The minimal charge distribution establishes the existence of the weak vdW force between the monolayers.

The contribution of different orbitals of Mo, Te and As atoms towards materials properties was further analyzed via the projected density of states (PDOS) profile, as shown in Fig. 2(b). It can be observed that the DOS increase from −5.0 to 5.0 eV is mainly contributed by Mo 4d, Te 5p and As 4p electronic states, with strong hybridization between these p and d orbitals moving the valence band (VB) closer to the conduction band (CB) and narrowing the forbidden gap. The π bonds in As are attributed to the overlapping of its 4p orbitals, which is weaker compared to the overlapping of 2p orbitals in the case of graphene. When exposed to the monolayer MoTe2, the weak π bonds undergo breaking and the loosened electrons interact with Mo and Te atoms to create sp3 like hybridization. The band structure plot was further calculated to provide clearer insight into the electronic properties of MoTe2/As. Phonon density of states in Fig. 2(e) clearly signifies that the acoustic branches are driven by the vibration of the As atom with lesser contribution from Te and Mo atoms, respectively. The low optical branches arise from the Te atom hybridizing with both Mo and As atoms while the lighter Mo atom dominates the high frequency region, with some As modes appearing conjointly. The absence of negative frequencies throughout the phonon dispersion indicates dynamical stability in the studied heterostructure.
As shown in Fig. 3(a), the bands near the VB maximum appear flatter than those observed for individual As, suggesting greater effective mass and lower holes mobility compared to the monolayer As. The HSE06 modified indirect electronic band gap (Eg) of 1.40 eV is located between the Γ and X points. To better comprehend the Bader charge transfer analysis, Fig. 3(b) reveals the band edge location for MoTe2/As. The measured conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) are 0.31 and 0.32 eV, respectively. The presence of CBO triggers the photogenerated electrons in MoTe2 to migrate to the CBM of the As layer, while the VBO presence causes the photogenerated holes in As to move to the VBM of the MoTe2 layer, thereby reducing the electron–hole recombination rate.

Along the way, the elastic coefficients (Cij) of MoTe2/As heterostructures were also investigated. For hexagonal geometry, only C11 = C22, C12 and C66 are applicable.39 The C11 = C22 = 169 N m−1 and C12 = 47 N m−1 meet the C11 > 0 and C11 > |C12| restrictions, hence deducing that the heterostructure is mechanically stable. Its Young's modulus (Y01 = Y10 = C11C22 − C122/C11) of 156 N m−1 exceeds those of As (53 N m−1) and most TMDs monolayers,40 but lower than that of graphene (340 N m−1),41 suggesting a synergistic enhancement of the mechanical strength and lattice flexibility in the MoTe2/As heterostructure. The intrinsic strength σint = Y/9, bending modulus for 2D sheet D = Yh2/12(1 − υ2)42 and buckling critical strain εc = −4π2D/YL2(ref. 43) were further estimated to assess the practicality of the heterostructure, where h, υ = C12/C11 and L are the heterostructure thickness, Poisson's ratio and heterostructure length in Å, respectively. The σint = 17.3 N m−1 of MoTe2/As is considerably larger than that of the isolated monolayers while its D of 58.59 eV leads to εc = −237.53/L2, which is nearly ninety times larger than the one reported for graphene εc = −2.64/L2 but smaller in comparison to BAs/WSe2, graphene/MoS2 and HfN2/WSe2,44–46 at an identical system length. These data show that MoTe2/As not only has a greater buckling resistance and is stiffer than graphene, but also remains more flexible compared to other vdW heterostructures.
Strain can lead to the modulation of an electronic state and thereupon vary the behavior of semiconductors. The following section focuses on the effect of strain on the electronic properties of the MoTe2/As heterostructure. Although various studies have reported that most 2D materials can withstand high stretchability up to 20% without collapsing, for rationality and simplicity, only biaxial strain defined as (a − a0)/a0 where a and a0 are the strained and unstrained lattice constants, respectively, between −10 and 10% was explored. As can be observed in Fig. 4, the total energy versus the strain curve from −10 to 4% remains a smooth quadratic parabola, manifesting the absence of phase transition and the applied biaxial strain is reversible within this range. The positive and negative x-axis labeling represents the tensile and compressive strains, respectively. The value of Eg decreases almost linearly with the increasing tensile strain. Conversely, the Eg increases with an increase in compressive strain till −4% mark, reaching the water splitting favorable 1.13 eV (1.68 eV) at the PBE (HSE06) level and then starts declining onwards and remains indirect throughout.

3.2 Optoelectronics, photocatalytic and thermoelectric properties
For the purpose of evaluating the optical absorption capacity of the MoTe2/As heterostructure, its real ε1(ω) and imaginary ε2(ω) parts of the dielectric constant were investigated using a combined DFT and BSE approach with scissor operator inclusion. The component of ε2(ω) was evaluated by the sum of matrix elements between the occupied and unoccupied bands while ε1(ω) was elicited from ε2(ω) via the Kramer–Kronig formula.47–49 To reduce the disparity in qualitative accuracy between DFT results and experiments, an appreciable empty conduction band states and frequency grid points of 240 and 10001, respectively, were assigned. The absorption coefficient α(ω) and refractive index n(ω) were then calculated to ascertain the absorption capacity and optical behavior of the heterostructure towards the solar spectrum via the following equation: (2) (3)
A standout feature of the MoTe2/As heterostructure is the high number of major imaginary part peaks condensed within the visible region (see Fig. 5), consequently leading to strong absorption that reaches 5.0 × 105 cm−1 and an impressive SLME of ∼33% at a relatively thin absorber thickness, as shown in Fig. 6. The SLME was calculated through the model introduced by Yu et al.,50 where a common standard solar spectra model known as the air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) spectrum and the often ignored light absorptivity α(E) were used as the reference and included via α(E) = 1 − exp[−2α(ω)L], respectively, in which L denotes the absorber thickness. These peaks are attributable to the photon induced electron transitions between the valence and conduction bands. Under a compressive strain of 4%, the dominant peaks of imaginary components undergo a large blue shift, causing the α(ω) value to increase significantly in ultraviolet zone. At this junction, the SLME reduces slightly to an acceptable 29% as a result of the diminished infrared proportion in the solar spectrum, given that 92% of the solar energy originates from the infrared-visible region, while ultraviolet only yields 7%.

The performance of photovoltaics as an efficient absorber is also strongly dependent on the energy loss, which arises from factors such as the carrier mobility μ and charge transfer. Being a type-II semiconductor, a high mobility will promote fast carrier migration to the heterostructure surface and facilitate the fast carrier separation, ensuring a high device efficiency. Herein, the electron and hole effective masses are mainly accorded by MoTe2 and As, respectively. Based on the formula introduced by Bardeen,51μ is influenced by the 2D elastic coefficient (C2D), deformation potential constant (ED) (see the ESI† file S1), direction dependent carrier effective mass (m) and mean effective mass (m*) through (4)where kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and operating temperature, respectively. The relaxation time τ can then be calculated following the τ = μm/e formula. The μ and τ values are listed in Table 2. From Table 2, in all directions, MoTe2/As exhibits a high μ of 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 order, with larger magnitude observed for holes. Its relatively low exciton binding energy of 0.178 eV means that the production of the current through knocked off electrons can occur efficiently. The high μ is beneficial towards the fast movement of photoinduced carriers to response sites, while the anisotropic character is favorable for the spatial separation, in which both enhance optoelectronics performance.

Photocatalytic water splitting is another phenomenon closely related to light absorbance. Given that MoTe2/As possesses good absorption ability within the visible light region, it is natural for one to examine its suitability as a semiconductor photocatalyst. To investigate the water splitting capacity, the valence and conduction band edge locations have been examined using Mulliken electronegativity χ (in eV),52 with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), as follows: ECBM = χ − 4.5 − 0.5Eg(5) EVBM = ECBM + Eg(6)
For satisfactory photocatalytic performance, the location of their potentials must straddle the reduction and oxidation potentials of water. The calculated χ and band edge potentials for the CBM and VBM of the MoTe2/As heterostructure at the HSE06 functional level are presented in Table 3 and Fig. 7, respectively. As can be seen, the VBM and CBM of pristine MoTe2/As sufficiently straddle the redox potential. In contrast, the VBM of the heterostructure when under 4% compressive strain is positioned well below the standard oxidation potential (1.23 eV), while its CBM is much lower than the reduction potential (0 eV), signifying that MoTe2/As when under the irradiation of sun light can perform both the oxidation evolution reaction (OER) and the H+ to H2 reduction reaction (HER) commendably for a widened pH scale of 0–4.

Clearly, the earlier discussed outstanding light absorption abilities of 105 cm−1 is indicative of a high solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency (ηSTH). To verify this, the prediction of STH for strained MoTe2/As was estimated using modified MATLAB coding based on the following: (7)where x, P(x) and E are the photon energy hω, AM1.5G solar energy flux at hω and actual photon energy used for water splitting, computed by (8)
In this work, χ(H2) and χ(O2) represent the HER and OER overpotential, forecasted by the HSE hybrid functional to be 0.15 (0.29) and 0.02 (0.16) eV for pristine MoTe2/As (compressed form), respectively. Even after applying a factor of 0.5 to account for situation when only half of the photogenerated carriers participate in catalytic processes, the calculated ηSTH of 29.27% (26.51%) for pristine MoTe2/As (compressed form) still surpasses the critical value of 10%, rendering the heterostructure a worthwhile photocatalyst from the economic viewpoint.
As illustrated in Fig. 8, lower hole doping level causes the S to increase before undergoing a sharp decrease with the increasing temperature, displaying an irregular profile. The bipolar effect induced reversal shape stabilizes when the concentration reaches an optimal doping of 1013 cm−2. The superior μ also leads to a significantly increased electrical conductivity up to 106 S m−1 and consequently an average ZT of > 0.6 with an intriguing PF of > 48.0 mW m−1 K−2 measured in the medium-high temperature are realized at a doping level of 8.0 × 1013 cm−2. The mild reduction in σ with temperature after the doping concentration increase indicates a modest carrier scattering behavior. Specifically, the gap between the optimal PF and ZT values becomes closer as the p-type doping increases from 2.0 × 1013 cm−2 to 8.0 × 1013 cm−2, owing to the steeper increase of κ. The improved ZT in MoTe2/As is attributed to the elevated S rather than the high electric conductivity since the latter reduces with the increasing temperature. The reciprocal connection between S and σ with respect to the carrier concentration (n) can be described using the following equations. (9) σ = neμ(10)where  is the density of states effective mass. Understandably, S and σ have contrasting effect on each other. Due to the intrinsic trade-off between S and σ, the combined moderate ZT and superior PF should serve as a reasonable compromise for efficient electronic and optoelectronic applications.

4. Conclusion
The structural, optoelectronics, thermoelectric and photocatalytic properties of the MoTe2/As vdW heterostructure have been systematically investigated based on first-principles calculations. The binding energy, AIMD simulation and mechanical stability criterion analyses confirm the stability of the MoTe2/As heterostructure. The VB maximum and CB minimum of this configuration are originated from MoTe2 and As, respectively, forming a type-II band alignment, which accelerates the segregation of carriers at the interface. The resultant potential decrease of 10.33 eV at the interface help the photo-generated charge lifecycle to be extended. An ultrahigh electron mobility of 102–103 cm2 V−1 s−1, attributed to the sharp band dispersion near the CBM in the monolayer As of the MoTe2/As heterostructure, and low exciton binding energy are beneficial for photocatalytic activity and could reduce the carrier recombination rate. Together with the apparent reduced band gap, multi-valley profile and relatively low κl, these features ensure a reachable combined moderate ZT and superior PF. The myriad imaginary part peaks with large amplitudes located within the infrared-visible region leads to high solar absorbance. In addition, under 4% compressive strain, the band edge position of the MoTe2/As heterostructure becomes favorable for the water splitting reaction, in which the energy range of its optical absorption maintains substantial overlaps with the solar spectrum, demonstrating enhanced photocatalysis sustained under strain and an economically viable solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of ∼30%. Apart from exploring the intrinsic electronic, mechanical, optical and transport properties of MoTe2/As, this theoretical work also demonstrates and deliberates strategies to improve the photocatalysis mechanism in MoTe2/As.
