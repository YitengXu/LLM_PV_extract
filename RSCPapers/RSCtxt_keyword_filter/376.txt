    , Accepted 8th June 2017First published on 12th June 2017AbstractDespite the previous reports on the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films via sequential deposition, the positioning and formation of PbI2 in MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films made from the seed layer containing PbI2 and PbCl2 in different ratios have not yet been addressed. In this study, the PbI2 content in a perovskite absorber layer is controlled by changing the PbCl2 ratio in a PbI2−xClx seed layer. The addition of PbCl2 in the seed layer facilitates PbI2 generation and affects the morphology of the perovskite film. By integrating a perovskite absorber via the PbI2−xClx seed-layer into a solar cell, we investigated the effects of the correlation between the chlorine and PbI2 contents on the device performance through intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. Elemental depth profiling analyses confirm that not only was the formed PbI2 preferentially located near the metal–oxide layer, but residual chlorine was adsorbed at the TiO2 layer. Our findings demonstrate that the geometric features of the formed PbI2 affected the perovskite solar cells according to the chlorine content, likely because of the elemental gradient induced by annealing. The PbI2−xClx-derived planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells exhibited maximum power-conversion efficiencies of 17.56% at reverse scan and 17.21% at forward scan, suppressed current density–voltage hysteresis, and good performance distributions.
Introduction
Since the first report on the photovoltaic behavior of CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX, where MA = CH3NH3 and X = I or Br),1 organometallic trihalide perovskites have become candidate photovoltaic materials because of their high power-conversion efficiency (PCE), natural abundance, and solution-processability. Studies on perovskite materials have revealed unique optoelectronic properties, such as ambipolar charge transport,2 tunable bandgaps,3 long charge-carrier diffusion lengths,4 and small exciton binding energies.5 Additionally, various fabrication techniques,6–8 including solution,6 vacuum,7 and anti-solvent processing,8 have been employed for producing high-quality perovskite films. Diverse innovations in processing have enabled unprecedented developments in the field of perovskite photovoltaic devices.9–12
Along with advanced fabrication methods, the phase transformations of perovskite materials have been investigated. Control of the transformation pathways and reaction intermediates is crucial for eliciting the full potential of these materials. In particular, systems containing chloride ions have exhibited idiosyncratic transformation pathways that differ from those in pure triiodide systems. The differences in the phase-transformation pathways during film formation may result from a transient phase bound to MAPbCl3,13 different chemical kinetics between the intercalating species (CH3NH3X, X = I or Cl) and the seed phase (PbCl2, PbI2),14 and the sublimation and/or decomposition of excess organic halide species during the thermal-annealing treatment.15,16 The colloidal properties of the mixed halide system provide heterogeneous nucleation sites, which suppress the formation of undesirable rod-like morphologies and diminish that of isolated cuboid structures.17 Hence, for nucleation framework management, it is necessary to understand the interaction of the chemical species involved in the perovskite film formation.
A few studies demonstrated the modification of the sequential deposition by introducing PbCl2 in a PbI2 precursor.18–20 The insertion of PbCl2 into the PbI2 precursor led to the tailored formation of a perovskite film exhibiting a different morphology, affecting the device performance. Although the films exhibited an increasing PbI2 content with the increasing PbCl2 ratio in the precursor, others attribute this phenomenon to the insufficient conversion of perovskite materials. Recently, the PbI2 content in perovskite films has emerged as a major concern because it has a beneficial effect on suppressing hysteresis in the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices, improving the device performance.21–27 Chen et al. observed the formation of a PbI2 phase on the periphery of perovskite grains. The formed PbI2 layer acted as an energy barrier, reducing the carrier recombination at the interfaces.25 Wang et al. examined the passivation effect of PbI2 caused by the structural environment in detail via femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. They determined that perovskite structures with grain boundaries containing lower levels of PbI2 were particularly vulnerable to charge-carrier recombination and that structures with more PbI2 had longer recombination times.26 Another set of studies indicated that PbI2 may passivate the TiO2 interface and thereby mitigate recombination, possibly because of the band-edge matching between the TiO2 and the perovskite layer.22,24,28 The presence of PbI2 in perovskite absorbers is clearly important for the photovoltaic performance. However, despite the documented evidence of the PbI2 passivation effect, our understanding of the generation of the PbI2 content in PbI2−xClx-derived perovskite films via sequential deposition remains insufficient. Furthermore, the correlation between the chlorine and the PbI2 passivation in perovskite photovoltaic devices has not been addressed.
In this study, a modified system for the fabrication of perovskite films was developed using an interdiffusion method29via the inclusion of PbCl2 salt in the PbI2 seed layer. We performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to obtain information regarding the composition and morphology with respect to the PbCl2 ratio in the PbI2−xClx seed layer. To compare the optical properties of the PbI2−xClx-derived perovskite films, UV–vis spectroscopy was performed. A time-correlated single-photon counting system was used to study the photoluminescence (PL) decay lifetime of the perovskite films. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiling was conducted to obtain layer-wise information about the atomic qualification. The diffusion coefficients (Dn) and recombination lifetime (τn) of the perovskite photovoltaics were analyzed using intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). The PbI2−xClx seed layer-derived planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells exhibited maximum PCEs of 17.56% at reverse scan and 17.21% at forward scan, with suppressed hysteresis under 1 sun of illumination.
Results & discussion
We examined the structural composition of the perovskite films to determine the effect of the Cl content on the film composition. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of PbI2−xClx seed-layer films with different PbCl2 ratios.30 When the mole portion of PbCl2 is higher than that of PbI2 in the precursor solution or the total concentration is greater than 1 M, retrograde solubility was observed (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). By incorporating PbCl2 in the PbI2 precursor, the peaks at 12.7° (PbI2) were reduced, and the PbICl peaks were increased. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of perovskite films fabricated with different PbCl2 ratios. Here, the perovskite film prepared using only iodide species exhibits a small peak corresponding to PbI2. In contrast, the peak corresponding to PbI2 increases in intensity as the ratio of PbCl2 in the PbI2−xClx seed layer increases (Fig. 1c). This implies a possible link between the increasing content of PbI2 and a transient phase caused by the chloride species. To investigate the evolution of the PbI2 phases, we performed XRD measurements on a perovskite film grown at a ratio of 1:0.75 (lead iodide to chloride) because this ratio yields a clear variation of the composition over time.

The inset illustrates the incident-light direction. The excitation wavelength was 520 nm. 
As shown in Fig. 1d, the XRD pattern (0 min) corresponding to tetragonal MAPbI331 without annealing indicates that MAPbI3 perovskite domains with a specific direction existed, not as intermediate compounds, unlike those obtained using the conventional one-step method (1:3 ratio of PbCl2:MAI).32 Slight shifts in the PbI2 phase (12.45°) and the precursor-complex phase were observed, which may have resulted from species that failed to react with MAI during the spin-coating process,33 as these phases disappeared with 30 min of annealing (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). This shift corroborates our understanding that the PbI2 was generated during the annealing process. This confirms that PbI2 was not the unreacted agent, as is often observed in the case of MAPbI3 perovskite films formed by typical two-step processes.6,34 Moreover, we observed prominent microchannels throughout the PbI2−xClx seed layer, which increased the infiltration capacity of MAI and thus accelerated the conversion of unreacted PbI2 into the perovskite materials (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†).35 Increasing the annealing time from 30 to 120 min gradually increased the intensity of the PbI2 peak, accompanied by the disappearance of the MAPbCl3 peak (see Fig. S2b and c in the ESI†). Previous studies demonstrated that the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 is one factor causing the occurrence of PbI2 in the annealing process.27,36 On the other hand, Song et al. reported that the PbI2 phase arises from the decomposition of the CH3NH3PbCl3 phase, as the intermediate phase experiences mass loss owing to the sublimation or decomposition of organic species because of its lack of thermal stability under moisture,33 which contributes to the generation of PbI2. Therefore, we infer that the formation of PbI2 was induced by an intermediate phase bound to MAPbCl3, rather than only by the decomposition of the MAPbI3 phase.
To verify the speculation that the generation of PbI2 in MAPbI3−xClx films was not the dominant driving force for MAPbI3 decomposition with extended annealing, UV–vis spectroscopy was performed on the perovskite films (Fig. 1e). The peak at 520 nm is closely linked to the decomposition of the perovskite film36 and indicates that the MAPbI3−xClx films had similar absorbance trends despite their different amounts of PbI2. With the exception of a small variation at 470 nm, the comparable absorbance of the MAPbI3−xClx films without a marked shoulder peak at 520 nm makes the aforementioned conjecture reasonable.36 The composition of the intermediate phase was not investigated, as this topic is beyond the scope of this study. However, it is the subject of ongoing research. According to the literature, this intermediate phase may be present in Cl-containing amorphous compounds37,38 or compounds having a complex stoichiometry.39
To compare the fluorescence-quenching properties of the PbI2−xClx-derived films, we performed TRPL measurements on the perovskite films (Fig. 1f). The PL decay of the samples was fitted with a bi-exponential function involving a fast-decay process and a slow-decay process. The fitted parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The fast-decay process refers to charge transport to electron-transport layers (ETLs), and the slow decay is associated with the radiative recombination of free carriers.40 The fast-decay lifetime of the perovskite films decreased from 15.70 to 1.39 ns as the PbCl2 ratio increased, indicating that the free carriers generated by illumination were rapidly transferred to ETLs.41 As PbI2 could have facilitated electron injection into the TiO2,26,27 we could not ignore the possibility that the reduced fast-decay lifetime partly originated from the PbI2. Consequently, the average PL decay lifetimes (τavg) for the perovskite films were 34.13, 4.87, 2.70, and 4.06 ns for the ratios of 1:0, 1:0.25, 1:0.5, and 1:0.75, respectively. To determine the effect of varied PbCl2 content in the seed layer on the perovskite crystallization,42 we compared the as-spun films with annealed films for each PbCl2 ratio to observe the initial and final film formation and morphology.
In the seed-layer system with no added PbCl2 (1:0), crater-like structures appeared sporadically in the non-annealed perovskite film (Fig. 2a). Upon annealing, these structures disappeared, indicating that they were agglomerated into the bulk perovskite via the interdiffusion of excess MAI (Fig. 2e). In contrast, as we incorporated increasing amounts of PbCl2 into the PbI2−xClx seed layer, we observed a gradual increase in the perovskite grain size and uniformity in morphology. Interestingly, even though long annealing times permitted complete conversion through interdiffusion, the primary crystal morphology played a pivotal role in the final perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 2a–h, when the crystal size of the as-spun perovskite film was small, the crystal size of the annealed film was likely to be small. The film growth depended strongly on the initial morphology, which was apparently determined by the ratio of chemical species in the PbI2−xClx seed-layer precursor solution. This implies that the complex ion equilibria in the seed-layer precursor solution are decisive in determining the crystal formation via solvation processes.43 Researchers have recognized that the addition of PbCl2 accelerates the formation of small, closely packed cubic structures18 induced by the precipitation of nucleation sites.44 However, having observed the crystal-size growth due to the gradual addition of PbCl2 to the seed layer, we propose that a threshold exists at which the PbCl2-induced precipitation process generating small crystals on the surface dominates over the Ostwald ripening process, yielding a large grain size.45 To validate this premise, we fabricated a perovskite film using a PbCl2:PbI2 ratio of 1:1 in the PbI2−xClx seed layer. Fig. S5 of the ESI† shows that the crystal sizes substantially decreased, as previously reported, resulting in the formation of pronounced voids in the final perovskite film.

Bottom row: SEM images of the corresponding perovskite films on TiO2 blocking layer/FTO glass, annealed under ambient conditions. The PbI2:PbCl2 ratios are as follows: (a), (e) 1:0; (b), (f) 1:0.25; (c), (g) 1:0.5; and (d), (h) 1:0.75. 

Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves of representative devices fabricated with different PbCl2 ratios. For a 1:0 perovskite film, hysteresis was observed, mainly owing to the differences in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Hypotheses concerning this process have been proposed, including (i) ferroelectric domains,46,47 (ii) ion/defect diffusion,48 and (iii) unbalanced carrier transport.49,50 In comparison, the hysteresis is suppressed with the addition of PbCl2; a device with a 1:0.25 perovskite film yields an inferior Jsc and FF. This may have resulted from the voids forming shunt pathways in the film (Fig. 2f). As the PbCl2 ratio increased to 1:0.5, Jsc and FF were enhanced. In the case of a 1:0.75 film, the device-performance parameters were decreased compared with those for a 1:0.5 film, which may be related to the chlorine and PbI2 contents in the films. In this field, the remaining chlorine content in MAPbI3−xClx perovskites is an interesting issue because it is too small for measuring the accurate amount of remaining chlorine. Although we did not quantitatively measure the chlorine existing in the final perovskite films, the perovskite films fabricated with different PbCl2 ratios may have had different amounts of remaining chlorine.

To further investigate the effects of the chlorine and PbI2 contents on the device performance, we investigated the charge-transport characteristics using IMPS and IMVS. Fig. 4a shows the diffusion coefficients (Dn) of the perovskite films, and Fig. 4b shows the carrier recombination lifetime (τr) with respect to the current density. Although the PbI2 contents for the films with ratios of 1:0.25 and 1:0.5 were comparable, the Dn values of these films differed significantly. The Dn for the 1:0.25 film was increased 1.9- and 3.9-fold for the 1:0.5 film compared with that of the MAPbI3 device (1:0). The τr values for both films were similar and were longer 1.67-fold for the 1:0.25 film and 1.27-fold for the 1:0.5 film compared with the 1:0 case. For a perovskite device with a ratio of 1:0.75, compared with the device with a ratio of 1:0, Dn increased 7.6-fold, and τr shortened 2.12-fold, indicating a higher susceptibility to recombination. Cl-containing films exhibit better charge-carrier transport characteristics than MAPbI3 films.4 On the other hand, considering that chlorine exists as extrinsic ions across interfaces rather than within the perovskite crystals,38,51,52 it is very plausible that the large amount of chlorine in the perovskite film negatively affected τr and positively affected Dn. The attribution of the increase in Dn to the effect of the PbI2 content at 1:0.75 appears to be inappropriate because PbI2 functioned as an intrinsic insulator, suppressing the recombination.22,25,27 Therefore, we assume that the suppression of τr was related to the passivation effect of PbI2 and the enhanced Dn due to the chlorine content.

The IMPS and IMVS results indicate that it is important to balance the chlorine and PbI2 contents for optimizing the PbI2−xClx-derived MAPbI3−xClx perovskite photovoltaics via the interdiffusion process. The charge-carrier dynamics is determined by the competing processes of recombination and carrier transport.52 The competing processes are conveniently described by the diffusion length (Ln = (Dnτr)0.5). The calculated Ln for the MAPbI3 film (1:0) was 620 nm, which is larger than previously reported values. However, this is by no means the most important issue; the carrier diffusion length in MAPbI3 perovskite films is highly correlated with the processing conditions.53 For PbI2−xClx seed layer-derived perovskite solar cells, the Ln values were reasonably matched with reported values ranging from 1000 to 1300 nm.4 These were 1120, 1390, and 1190 nm for the ratios of 1:0.25, 1:0.5, and 1:0.75, respectively. Improvements in Ln increase the charge-collection efficiency (ηcc), yielding higher EQE spectra. As shown in Fig. 4c, the integrated EQE values correspond well to the obtained Ln values, exhibiting a similar trend to the UV absorption spectrum, except for the MAPbI3 film (1:0), probably owing to the inferior carrier property.
Considering their high content of PbI2, which has a bandgap of 2.3 eV,27 the devices are not expected to exhibit high PCE values. To address this, we propose two discrete scenarios illustrating how the PbI2 can function as a passivator.
First, the origin of the PbI2 species is crucial. As previously discussed, as PbI2 is developed without damaging the MAPbI3 layer, it has a negligible effect on the generation of the photocurrent. Second, the geometric features of the formed PbI2 affect the perovskite film. If PbI2 is formed at the TiO2/absorber interfaces, it functions as a window, leading to the passivation25–27 of related defects and preventing intimate contact28 between the hole-transport material (HTM) and TiO2 surfaces. Experimental results have highlighted the importance of modifying the defects in TiO2,54 which enhances the device performance and suppresses hysteresis, because charge capture is more likely at TiO2/absorber interfaces owing to the imperfections in both the perovskite and TiO2 surfaces. As shown in the SEM images (Fig. 2), with the exception of peripheral areas of the grain boundaries, no species speculated to be PbI2 were present on the surface of the absorbers. Therefore, we hypothesize that the majority of PbI2 was, with grain boundaries, located at the interface between the TiO2 and the perovskite crystal caused by the ionic diffusion that occurred during the conversion of the perovskite materials.
The interdiffusion process heavily depends on the diffusion of atomic species, because excess MAI species become stacked onto the seed layer as sources for reconstructing the perovskite materials (see Table S2 in the ESI†).29,38 Therefore, it can be assumed that a sublimation process of the excess halide species, that is, the removal of the spectator ions, proceeds through the grain-boundary channel or on the top of the growing perovskite film in the interdiffusion process. Thus, elemental gradients are likely to be established over a cross-section of the evolving perovskite film during annealing (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†).

Fig. 5 illustrates the interdiffusion process, in which a perpendicular gradient of organic species is established towards the TiO2 surface, promoting the generation of PbI2 at the interfaces between the TiO2 and the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite. Song et al. reported the generation mechanism of PbI2 under MAI-deficient conditions and established possible transformation pathways of the MAPbI3−xClx film.33 For clarity, we propose a plausible major reaction associated with a separate region of the evolving perovskite film, as follows. The byproduct is representative of sublimable species such as MACl, HCl, HI, and CH3NH2, and its formation is accelerated by moisture in the air.15,46

Region I  
Region II  
In Region I, the unstable intermediate MAPbI3−xClx can smoothly transform into stoichiometric MAPbI3−xClx, and this transformation is supported by accessible and ample MAI species. Additionally, the byproduct easily escapes from the surface. However, in Region II, an environment discouraging the stoichiometric balance of MAPbI3−xClx is fostered by a deficit of MAI species that are consumed in the diffusion from Region I to Region II.33,43 As a result, the intermediate MAPbI3−xClx in Region II has a strong tendency to generate PbI2. The proposed film-formation mechanism is well-supported by the recent report of one-dimensional film growth involving a top-down reaction38 (see Fig. S8 in the ESI†).
To analyze the quality of the perovskite films (1:0, 1:0.75 ratio for clear comparison), ToF-SIMS depth profiling was performed. In Fig. 6a and b, the obvious differences between the PbI3− and Cl− signals are observed in the films. Homogeneous profiles of the PbI2 signal are observed for both samples, and there is a remarkable decrease in the PbI3− signal at the TiO2 interfaces for the 1:0.75 film (Fig. 6b). Considering that the 1:0 film exhibits a low PbI2 content according to the XRD measurement, it is reasonable to suppose that the PbI3− signal is related to perovskite crystals, as compositional changes in a perovskite film imply that the relative proportion of each component is qualitatively altered. Thus, the declining trend of the PbI3− signal at the perovskite/TiO2 interfaces in the 1:0.75 film provides compelling evidence for the preferred location of the generated PbI2 in the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films. These findings support the theory that the PbI2 secondary species are positioned at TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx interfaces with perovskite grain boundaries.

The Cl− signal detected in the underlying TiO2 blocking layer of the 1:0 film (Fig. 6a) is attributed to residues from the blocking-layer process.55 In contrast, for the 1:0.75 film (Fig. 6b), a Cl− signal was observed in the perovskite bulk phase with irregularity and was strong at the perovskite/TiO2 interfaces. The Cl− signal coming from the TiO2 blocking layer may have slightly contributed to this signal, but it was very weak given the Cl− intensity of the 1:0 film. The presence of chlorine, which acted as a dopant and facilitated charge transport, over the perovskite absorber conclusively supports an inhomogeneous chlorine distribution.56,57 Interestingly, the chlorine signal over the TiO2 interfaces remained constant. This indicates that chlorine was adsorbed at the TiO2 layer, which reduced the number of oxygen-vacancy defect states and charge trap sites.32,58,59 To demonstrate the reproducibility of the performance of the PbI2−xClx-derived perovskite photovoltaics, we fabricated 40 devices with a ratio of 1:0.5. As shown in the histograms (Fig. 6c), the overall hysteresis between the reverse and forward scans was negligible. The highest PCE was 17.56% at reverse scan and 17.21% at forward scan. The maximum EQE reached >91% at 500 nm, yielding an integrated Jsc value of 19.88 mA cm−2, which agrees well with the values of the J–V curves (Fig. 6d).
In summary, we explored variations in perovskite films according to the PbCl2 content in the PbI2−xClx seed layers. XRD observations indicated that increasing the PbCl2 content in the PbI2−xClx seed layer facilitated the formation of PbI2. Using SEM, we observed changes in the perovskite crystal morphologies and sizes with respect to the PbCl2 ratio in the PbI2−xClx seed layer. Effective charge separation was confirmed via TRPL measurements in the PbI2−xClx-derived perovskite films, indicating the enhancement of the carrier separation in the absorber materials. IMVS and IMPS provided insight into the interplay between the chlorine and PbI2 contents. Apparently, the largest diffusion length (Ln) was obtained for the perovskite film with a ratio of 1:0.5, which exhibited optimum photovoltaic performance. ToF-SIMS depth profiling revealed that both the chlorine and PbI2 contents were higher at the metal–oxide surface than anywhere else in the perovskite layer. Plausibly, the formation of PbI2 closer to the substrate, rather than at the interface with the HTM, permitted the developed PbI2 to act as a passivator. With the rapid progress in this field, the evidence of chloride loss is well-established; thus, persuasive phase-transformation pathways have been proposed.13,14,33 However, the generation and position of PbI2 in MAPbI3−xClx films fabricated via sequential deposition remains an open question. Although the exact composition of the intermediate phase was not investigated in this study, the present work accounts for the phenomena of an enhanced PbI2 peak without the significant reduction of the perovskite peaks, which was mentioned in recent reports concerning PbCl2-assisted films.18,19 In addition, the information about the chlorine distribution in the perovskite absorber deepens our understanding of the physical location of chlorine, which affects the device performance. These findings provide not only deep insight into the nature of the intermediate phase in the formation of MAPbI3−xClx films via sequential deposition but also a novel strategy for developing efficient MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells.
