Compared to PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 that comprise two-dimensional (2D) conjugated D units displayed lower bandgaps, more rigid backbones, higher self-organization ability and shorter π–π stacking distances (∼3.5 Å). As a result, the hole mobility of PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 (up to 0.42 cm2 (V s)−1) was one magnitude higher than that of PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 (up to 0.039 cm2 (V s)−1), as measured with organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Polymer solar cells (PSCs) of these polymers were prepared with PC71BM as an acceptor and o-xylene as a processing solvent, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 6.79%, 5.65%, 3.94% and 1.70% were achieved for PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, respectively. PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 exhibited photovoltaic properties superior to PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 owing to their high hole-mobility and the formation of ordered nano-fibrillar structures in which polymer backbones preferred face-on arrangement.
Introduction
Donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers (CPs) have attracted much interest as donor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs) on account of their low bandgap, tunability of energy levels and high charge carrier mobility.1–5 For improving the performance of PSCs, significant accomplishments have been achieved in the molecular engineering of D–A CPs,6–13 and most of these efforts have been focused on developing new D units or fine tuning the structures of D units.
Among the available D units, polycyclic aromatics are promising building blocks of photovoltaic D–A CPs because of their rigid and planar structures,14–38 which are beneficial for enhancing the intermolecular interaction and charge carrier mobility of the polymers. Most of these D units have terminal thiophene rings to release steric hindrance with neighbouring units, and contain solubilizing groups in central rings for improving the solubility of the resulting polymers. Particularly, those with two-dimensional (2D) conjugated structures are very attractive for the design and synthesis of D–A CPs with high photovoltaic performance since the 2D conjugated structures can not only enlarge the intermolecular overlap of π-electron orbitals or intermolecular π–π interaction, but also encourage the face-on alignment of conjugated backbones, allowing effective exciton diffusion and efficient charge carrier transport along the direction normal to the substrate.32,33 Besides, the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the polymers and the miscibility between the polymer and fullerene derivatives can be modulated by optimizing side chains.34,35 For example, Hou and coworkers found that the polymer with 2D extended 4,8-bis(5-alkylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-T, Chart 1) as a D unit had much more outstanding device performance than the polymer based on 4,8-dialkoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-OR, Chart 1) due to the broadened absorption spectrum and enhanced hole mobility.36 Sun et al. also proved that dithienyl-substituted dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) was a promising D unit for CPs with great photovoltaic properties.37

Considering the commercial applications of PSCs, inexpensive and accessible polymer donors are essential.39 Although significant efforts have been dedicated to the development of 2D polycyclic aromatic D units, most of them are rather complicated in terms of synthesis. Accordingly, the development of feasibly synthesized 2D planar and conjugated D units and D–A CPs based on them is very crucial. (E)-1,2-Di(thiophen-2-yl)ethene (TVT, Chart 1) is an accessible and planar aromatic unit and has been frequently-used in the synthesis of high mobility CPs.40–44 The presence of the vinyl linker allows reducing the steric hindrance when the solubilizing groups are introduced at the β-positions of thiophene rings near the vinyl group.45 Consequently, (E)-1,2-bis(5-alkyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-2′-yl)ethene (TVT-T, Chart 1) obtained by simply attaching an alkylthienyl group on the TVT framework should be an accessible 2D conjugated aromatic unit for D–A CPs. In the current paper, we synthesized a series of D–A CPs, i.e., PTVT-T6, PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 as shown in Chart 2, with TVT-T as a D unit and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DFBT)6–9,46–48 as an A unit, and their photophysical, semiconducting and photovoltaic properties were investigated in detail. For comparison, three polymers, i.e., PTVT-C6, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 (Chart 2), using alkyl instead of alkyl thiophene as solubilizing groups, were also synthesized and characterized.

Results and discussion
Structure of the TVT-T unit
Single crystal analysis is the best way to evaluate the three dimensional structure of organic molecules. Fortunately, single crystals of a TVT-T derivative, i.e., (E)-1,2-bis(5-hexyl-[2,3′-bithiophen]-2′-yl)ethene (Fig. 1a, for its synthesis please see the ESI†), qualified for single crystal analysis, were successfully grown by the slow evaporation of n-hexane solvent. As shown in Fig. 1b and S1,† the TVT core is almost planar while a diminutive dihedral angle (θ = 11.95°) can be found between the alkylthiophene side chains and the TVT plane, indicating that the introduction of alkylthiophene side chains has a negligible effect on the backbone planarity. Both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are delocalized over the entire aromatic skeleton including two thienyl substituents as revealed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 1c). These observations confirm the 2D conjugated feature of TVT-T derivatives.

Synthesis of the polymers

Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route to PTVT-T6, PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10. TVT-diBr and tributyl (5-alkylthiophen-2-yl) stannane (1) were synthesized according to ref. 49–52. Compound 2 was obtained in high yield via the Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling of TVT-diBr and 1. Then 2 was treated with n-BuLi at −78 °C followed by the reaction with Me3SnCl to afford monomer 3 almost quantitatively. Finally, the Stille polycondensation of 3 with 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole gave the polymers PTVT-T6, PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 in high yields. Note that only fast column chromatography elution and recrystallization were required to attain the pure product 2, allowing large quantity preparation of the monomer. The total yields of the polymers in three steps were all above 80%. For comparison, polymers PTVT-C6, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 which carry alkyl instead of alkylthienyl as side-chains were also synthesized as shown in the ESI (Scheme S1†). PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 are all soluble in common organic solvents such as o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), chloroform and o-xylene at room temperature. However, PTVT-T6 and PTVT-C6 are almost insoluble in any organic solvents, even in hot 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. Therefore, the following characterization was only carried out for PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to PTVT-T6, PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10. Reagents and conditions: (i) Pd(PPh3)4, DMF, 100 °C. (ii) (a) n-BuLi, THF, −78 °C; (b) SnMe3Cl, 0 °C ∼ room temperature. (iii) 4,7-Dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, Pd2(dba)3, P(o-tol)3, toluene, 110 °C. 
As shown in Table S1 and Fig. S2a,† the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the molar mass dispersity index (Đ) of the polymers are 38 kDa and 2.6 for PTVT-T8, 50 kDa and 2.9 for PTVT-T10, 30 kDa and 2.2 for PTVT-C8 and 39 kDa and 2.3 for PTVT-C10, respectively, as measured by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC). All four polymers have decomposition temperatures (Td) above 390 °C (5% weight loss), and no distinct thermal transitions were observed for them in the temperature range for testing (Fig. S2 and Table S1†).
Photophysical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 in o-xylene. All four polymers have absorption bands at 300–500 and 500–800 nm ascribed to π–π* transitions and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions, respectively. The low energy absorption maxima of PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 are located at 734 and 732 nm, respectively, ca. 30 nm red-shift compared to those of PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 (Table 1). This indicates that PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 have more extended conjugation, which can be ascribed to the 2D conjugated structure of the TVT-T unit. More obvious vibronic absorption peaks were observed for PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10, indicative of their more rigid conjugated backbones and enhanced intermolecular interaction while compared to PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10. For all four polymers, only a ca. 10 nm bathochromic shift of the ICT band was observed from solution to film states (Fig. 1b), implying that a pre-aggregation of polymer chains in solution may take place. The optical band gaps (EOPTg) of the polymers are 1.55, 1.54, 1.58 and 1.57 eV for PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, respectively. PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 have slightly lower EOPTg, consistent with the above discussion on the absorption spectra of the polymers.

Thin film cyclic voltammetry (CV) was adopted to study the electrochemical properties of PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10. All these polymers exhibited quasi-reversible p-doping and n-doping processes (Fig. S2d†). HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the redox onset potentials. As shown in Fig. 2c and Table 1, HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.29 and −3.23 eV for PTVT-T8, −5.30 and −3.22 eV for PTVT-T10, −5.32 and −3.11 eV for PTVT-C8 and −5.31 and −3.12 eV for PTVT-C10, respectively.
Film microstructures and hole transport properties of the polymers
Hole transport properties of the polymers were first studied by organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with a bottom gate and top contact configuration (for details see the ESI†). The devices were fabricated with o-xylene as the solvent. Hole mobility (OFET) was calculated from the saturation regime and the data are outlined in Table 2. Typical transfer and output curves of the polymers are displayed in Fig. S3 and S4.† All four polymers are typical p-type semiconductors. Hole mobilities of the devices based on pristine films were 0.20, 0.052, 0.018 and 0.0073 cm2 (V s)−1 for PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, respectively. After thermal annealing at 150 °C, the device performance of PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10 and PTVT-C8 was slightly improved while that of PTVT-C10 was almost unchanged. Mobilities of the devices based on thermally annealed films were 0.42, 0.064, 0.039 and 0.0070 cm2 (V s)−1 for PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, respectively. Note that the mobility of the polymers with alkylthienyl side chains (PTVT-T8 or PTVT-T10) is one magnitude higher than that of their counterparts with alkyl side chains in the same size (PTVT-C8 or PTVT-C10).

The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was also used to investigate the hole transport properties of the polymers along the direction normal to the substrate surface. A device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, 40 nm)/polymer (100 nm)/MoO3 (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) was employed for this study. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. S5,† pristine films of PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 showed hole mobilities (SCLC) of 1.5 × 10−4, 4.4 × 10−4, 1.3 × 10−4 and 3.1 × 10−5 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively. After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min, hole mobilities of PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 were significantly enhanced to 7.9 × 10−4 and 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively, while those of PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 only showed a small increase.
Compared to PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 exhibited higher hole mobility in both OFET and SCLC measurements as aforementioned. This means that the incorporation of the 2D conjugated D unit TVT-T into the polymers can improve hole transport properties along the direction either parallel or perpendicular to the substrate. Moreover, PTVT-T8 displayed higher μOFET but lower μSCLC compared to PTVT-T10. These phenomena may be related to the film microstructures of the polymers. Therefore, the neat films of the polymers were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).
Fig. S6† shows the film AFM height images of the polymers before and after thermal annealing. PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 presented an obvious fiber-like film morphology, and the domain sizes were slightly enlarged after thermal annealing. PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 showed an indistinct fiber-like film morphology, especially after thermal annealing. These observations are consistent with the above studies on the hole transport properties of the polymers, and indicate that PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 have a higher self-organization ability compared to PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10.
Film GIWAXS patterns of the polymers without and with thermal annealing are shown in Fig. S7† and Fig. 3, and the corresponding profiles are depicted in Fig. S8.† The diffraction intensities were enhanced upon thermal annealing. As shown in Fig. 3, a (100) diffraction peak along qxy as well as qz and a (010) diffraction peak along qz were observed for all four polymers, but no (010) peak was presented along qxy. This indicates that partial polymer backbones adopted face-on alignment on the substrate. PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 presented a much stronger (100) peak along qxy and a (010) peak along qz compared to their counterparts carrying alkyls with the same size (PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10), implying that more conjugated backbones of PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 packed in the face-on mode. Moreover, the π–π stacking distances of PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 are 3.48 and 3.51 Å, respectively, as calculated from the (010) diffractions, which are much shorter than those of PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 (3.72 and 3.75 Å, respectively).
 Fig. 3  Two-dimensional (2D) film GIWAXS patterns of PTVT-T8 (a), PTVT-T10 (b), PTVT-C8 (c) and PTVT-C10 (d). The films were prepared by spin-casting on the n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane (ODMS) modified Si/SiO2 substrate and thermally annealed at 150 °C for 15 minutes. 
According to AFM and GIWAXS characterization, compared to PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, 2D TVT-T based polymers PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 have a higher self-organization ability and can form well-ordered microstructures comprising close-packed and face-on arranged conjugated backbones, thereby delivering higher hole mobility along both directions parallel and perpendicular to the substrate. Compared to PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10 prefers forming highly ordered π–π stacking nanostructures along the direction normal to the substrate surface, as indicated by the presence of a much stronger (010) peak along qz and a (100) peak along qxy (Fig. 3). However, more bulky alkyl chains must be detrimental to the charge transport in the OFET geometry in this packing mode. Therefore, PTVT-T10 displayed higher μSCLC but lower μOFET.
Photovoltaic properties of the polymers
PSCs with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM (100 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated using o-xylene as the solvent. Diphenyl ether (DPE) and a commercially available nucleating agent Hyperform HPN-68L (simplified as HPN) were employed as additives. HPN is an effective additive for tuning the film morphology of polymer:PC71BM blends as reported by Bo et al.53 The amount of additives and the polymer:PC71BM ratio were optimized in order to obtain the best device performance (Tables S2 and S6–S8†). Fig. 4 displays the typical current density–voltage (J–V) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. All the polymers exhibited similar open-circuit voltages (VOC), consistent with their identical HOMO energy levels measured by the electrochemical method (Fig. 2c). They all showed inferior device performance when no additives were used. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices were 1.36%, 0.81%, 0.36% and 0.093% for PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, respectively, owing to a rather low short circuit current density (JSC). When DPE was added (3 vol% for PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 and 5 vol% for PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10), JSC was remarkably enhanced, leading to higher PCEs of 5.64%, 5.00%, 3.94% and 1.56% for PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, respectively. The addition of HPN resulted in a further enhancement of PCEs for PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 but only a small influence on those of PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10. Both JSC and fill factor (FF) were enhanced for PTVT-T8 while only the FF was improved for PTVT-T10. As a result, PTVT-T8 displayed the best device performance with a VOC of 0.73 V, a JSC of 13.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.68, leading to a PCE of 6.79%. In contrast, PTVT-C10 gave the poorest device performance with the highest PCE of 1.70%. PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 showed remarkably higher PSC performance compared to PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10, further confirming the advantage of the 2D TVT-T unit in the development of D–A CPs for photovoltaic application. Other solvents (o-dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene) and additive (methyl-naphthalene) were used to fabricate the devices of PTVT-T8, but lower PCEs were obtained (Tables S3 and S4†). Thermal annealing also resulted in a decrease of PCEs (Table S5†).

Note that the rather low PSC efficiency of the devices based on PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 is mainly ascribed to the noticeably lower JSC and relatively lower FF, especially for PTVT-C10. Meanwhile, compared to PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10 exhibited a higher μSCLC but a lower PCE. In order to understand the insights into these phenomena, the film morphology of polymer:PC71BM was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Without any additives, the blend films of all four polymers generated severe phase separation and drop-like domains with sizes of 200–900 nm were observed (Fig. 5a–d). The severe phase separation is detrimental to the charge separation between the polymer and PC71BM, leading to the poor device performance. Upon the addition of 3 vol% DPE, fiber-like networks with a domain size of 10–20 nm for PTVT-T8:PC71BM and 15–40 nm for PTVT-T10:PC71BM were observed (Fig. 5e and g). This favourable micro-phase separation and interpenetrating networks are beneficial to the efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface and the effective charge transport and collection as well, giving rise to a large improvement of JSC and device performance as mentioned above. The slightly larger domain sizes may be responsible for the relatively lower device performance of PTVT-T10. Similar interpenetrating networks also emerged for the polymers carrying alkyl groups, i.e., PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10. But lager domain sizes, which were 30–100 nm for PTVT-C8:PC71BM and 40–90 nm for PTVT-C10:PC71BM, were observed (Fig. 5f and h). This might result in their lower JSC and device performance. When HPN was added, more obvious phase separation was observed in the blend films of PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 along with slightly enlarged domain sizes (Fig. 5i and k), suggesting the formation of more pure domains as Bo et al. reported.53 This would lead to more efficient exciton dissociation and reduced bimolecular recombination, and then the device performance was improved. The addition of HPN in the blend films of PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 resulted in an excessive increase in domain sizes (Fig. 5j and l). Accordingly, almost no device performance improvement was observed. Film 2D-GIWAXS was also recorded for understanding the effect of additives on the microstructures of the blend films with PTVT-T8:PC71BM as an example. Fig. 6 shows the 2D-GIWAXS patterns of PTVT-T8:PC71BM films with and without additives, and the corresponding profiles are displayed in Fig. S9.† For the film prepared without any additives, an obvious (100) diffraction arc at q = 2.3 nm−1 and a rather weak (010) diffraction at qz = 18.0 nm−1, corresponding to d-spacings of 27.17 and 3.49 Å, respectively, were observed. No obvious changes were observed when DPE alone was used as an additive. These observations indicate that the addition of DPE mainly influences the phase separation between the polymer and PC71BM but not crystalline microstructures. When both DPE and HPN were added, the (100) diffraction peak became sharper and was more focused on qxy and qz directions, indicating more oriented arrangement of polymer chains. Meanwhile, a much stronger (010) diffraction peak at qz = 18.2 nm−1, corresponding to a slightly decreased π–π stacking distance (3.45 Å), was observed. This implies that the addition of HPN can promote the crystallization of the polymer, and ordered domains comprising face-on aligned conjugated backbones with close π–π stacking were formed. This type of film morphology is preferential for high performance PSCs.

Conclusions
D–A CPs PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 which can be processed with the non-chlorinated solvent o-xylene were synthesized by using an accessible TVT-T as a D unit and DFBT as an A unit. The 2D conjugated structure of TVT-T endows these polymers with lower bandgaps and more rigid backbones compared to PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 in which alkyls instead of alkylthienyl groups were used as solubilizing groups. This structural feature of TVT-T also encouraged the self-organization and close packing of the polymer chains. Consequently, PTVT-T8 and PTVT-T10 showed more ordered intermolecular stacking and smaller π–π stacking distances (∼3.5 Å) in the solid state, and thereby their charge carrier transport properties were superior to those of PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10. PSCs of PTVT-T8, PTVT-T10, PTVT-C8 and PTVT-C10 were prepared with PC71BM as the acceptor, o-xylene as the solvent and DPE and HPN as additives, and the polymers based on the TVT-T unit exhibited a much higher device performance. Blend films of PTVT-T8:PC71BM possessed the best film morphology and microstructures, i.e., 10–20 nm nanophase-separated domains where polymer backbones mainly aligned in a face-on fashion, therefore delivering the highest PCE (up to 6.79%). Our studies indicate that TVT-T derivatives are promising 2D conjugated D units of D–A CPs for photovoltaic application. Note that TVT-T derivatives can be easily synthesized in a large quantity, making the mass production of D–A CPs based on them accessible.
