    , Accepted 19th January 2015First published on 20th January 2015AbstractOn the basis of the N-annulated perylene electron donor and the ethynylbenzothiadiazole-benzoic acid electron acceptor, we herein report on synthesizing a structurally simple donor–acceptor (D–A) perylene dye C272. Without the use of any coadsorbate, we have achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency of 10.4% at air mass global (AM1.5G) conditions, which is comparable to that of the well-known zinc porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8.

Broader context
Conjugating electron-rich and electron-deficient organic blocks to form a donor–acceptor chromophoric core is a very versatile tactic to construct a metal-free photosensitizer for dye-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells. Another unnegligible theme in the dye design lies in the rational attachment of some photochemically inactive segments such as branched aliphatic chains to an organic electronic backbone, playing a central role in the control of a microstructure of self-assembled layer of dye molecules on the surface of titania and its closely related charge transfer dynamics and power output. These two points are well exemplified here by designing a simple perylene photosensitizer displaying an over 10% power conversion efficiency.

The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC)1 consisting of an interconnected network of titania nanocrystals has aroused tremendous research interest in material innovation, physical analysis, and device engineering, in the worldwide search for eco-friendly technologies to achieve low-cost solar-to-electricity conversion. In this nanostructured photovoltaic cell, a self-assembled monolayer of dye molecules on the surface of wide band-gap nanocrystals significantly determines light absorption and multi-channel charge-transfer dynamics, impacting cell efficiency to a high degree.2 Thus far certain zinc porphyrin3 and ruthenium polypyridine4 complexes have been demonstrated as the best performing sensitizers from the respective viewpoints of efficiency and stability. Meanwhile, considerable efforts have also been devoted to the design and synthesis of numerous metal-free organic D–A dyes, due primarily to the abundance of raw materials, flexibility of molecular design, and bright color.5
In consideration of high luminescence yields and large molar absorption coefficients, some small organic molecules characteristic of a coplanar perylene skeleton have been widely used as fluorescent lipid probes, light-emitting materials, automotive paints, and pigments for synthetic fibers and engineering resins.6 In addition, perylene has also been employed as a building block of certain metal-free organic dyes for DSCs;7 however, to the present the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) attained is only ∼9%.8 In this context, Luo et al.9 have employed a phenyl functionalized N-annulated perylene (PNP) as the electron donor of a zinc porphyrin dye WW-6 (Fig. S1†) and attained a PCE of 10.5%, which is quite comparable to the well-known YD2-o-C8 dye10 (Fig. S1†) under the same device fabrication and testing conditions. However, the synthetic yields of both zinc porphyrin dyes are low,9,10 which could to some extent limit their practical applications. In this contribution, we slightly tailor the PNP electron donor for improved self-assembling and combine it with the ethynylbenzothiadiazole-benzoic acid (EBTBA) electron acceptor3a,3b,7p to construct a metal-free perylene dye C272 (Fig. 1), achieving a PCE of 10.4% during a preliminary test. The merit of employing the EBTBA electron acceptor for C272 will also be examined by referring to the C271 reference with a conventional cyanoacrylic acid (CA) electron acceptor for a large portion of metal-free D–A dyes.5a–f

Scheme 1 illustrates our synthetic routes used for the dye construction. With the commercially available 4-iodophenol (1) as the starting material, we first used 2-hexyldecyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate11 as the alkylating regent to implement an almost quantitative alkylation reaction to afford 1-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)-4-iodobenzene (2). Compound 2 was subsequently converted to a bisarylamino functionalized phenylboronic acid pinacol ester (3) in excellent yield, via the palladium-catalyzed Miyaura borylation reaction at a mild condition.12 The Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of 3 characteristic of good shelf life and mono-brominated NP (4)13 produced the common intermediate 4 for the two new perylene dyes in good yield, by use of the highly active phosphine ligand 2-(2′,6′-dimethoxybiphenyl)dicyclohexylphosphine (Sphos).14 For the CA reference dye C271, we carried out the region-selective mono-formylation of 4 by virtue of the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction to generate 5.15 Compound 5 was then condensed with cyanoacetic acid by using the well-known Knoevenagel condensation to get the final product in excellent yield.16 For the EBTBA dye C272, we performed the region-selective mono-bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) at a relatively low temperature to yield the key intermediate 6. Further cross-coupling of 6 and butyl-4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoate via the Sonogashira reaction gave the dye precursor 7.17 Compound 7 was hydrolyzed with a strong base (KOH) as the catalyst, and the hydrolyzate was then acidified with a diluted phosphoric acid aqueous solution to afford the desired product.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for metal-free D–A dyes C271 and C272 characteristic of an N-annulated perylene electron donor. Reagents and conditions: (i) 2-hexyldecyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate, KOH, DMF, 100 °C, 5 h; (ii) 4,4,4′,4′,5,5,5′,5′-octamethyl-2,2′-bi(1,3,2-dioxaborolane), Pd(dppf)Cl2, KOAc, DMSO, 45 °C, 5 h; (iii) 3-bromo-1-(2-hexyldecyl)-1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole, Pd(OAc)2, Sphos, K3PO4, dioxane–H2O (v/v, 5/1), reflux, 3 h; (iv) DMF, POCl3, DCE, 0 to 40 °C, 12 h; (v) cyanoacetic acid, ammonium acetate, ACN–CHCl3 (v/v, 1/2), reflux, 48 h; (vi) NBS, THF, 0 °C, 0.5 h; (vii) butyl-4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoate, Pd2(dba)3, P(t-Bu)3, Cs2CO3, dioxane, reflux, 5 h; (viii) NaOH, THF–H2O (v/v, 3/1), reflux, 8 h; (ix) phosphoric acid. 
We then carried out electrochemical measurements for the two new NP dyes with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent, so as to roughly evaluate the impact of electron acceptor (EBTBA vs. CA) on the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) recorded under nitrogen with wide potential windows are presented in Fig. 2a and the derived energy levels are tabulated in Table S1.† For the herein studied NP electron donor, it is noted that the EBTBA electron acceptor slightly stabilizes the LUMO energy level (ECVL) by 30 meV, but remarkably destabilizes the HOMO energy level (ECVH) by 150 meV, thereby bringing forth a narrow LUMO/HOMO energy gap (ΔECVL/H) of 1.86 eV for C272 with respect to that of 2.04 eV for C271. Thus, it is reasonable to observe a 4 nm red shifting of maximum absorption wavelength (λMEASABS,MAX) in Fig. 2b, albeit somehow a very small value. Moreover, the electron acceptor alternation from CA to EBTBA also confers an improved maximum molar absorption coefficient (εMEASABS,MAX) from 34.7 to 36.1 mM−1 cm−1 (Table S1†). The relative alignments of LUMO and HOMO, the red-shifted λMEASABS,MAX, and the enhanced εMEASABS,MAX can be nicely reproduced by theoretical calculations as listed in Table S1.† In general, the S0 → S1 vertical electronic transitions to LUMO for both dyes mainly originated from HOMO, displaying a clear characteristic of intramolecular charge transfer as discerned from the contour plots of molecular orbitals in Fig. 2c.
 Fig. 2  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of C271 and C272 in THF. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide was used as supporting electrolyte and decamethylferrocene (DMFC) was added as internal reference. All potentials are further calibrated with ferrocene (Fc) as the reference. (b) Electronic absorption spectra of C271 and C272 in THF. (c) Optimized ground-state geometry of dye molecule in THF and topologies of its molecular orbitals relevant to S0 → S1 transition. The isodensity surface values are fixed at 0.03. (d) Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (value above color bar), highest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (value under color bar), and energy gap (EL/H) of dye molecule as well as its electron-releasing and electron-withdrawing segments. PNP, N-annulated perylene capped with 2-hexyldecyloxybenzyl; CA, cyanoacrylic acid; EBTBA, ethynylbenzothiadiazole-benzoic acid. To improve computational efficiency, the large aliphatic substituents were replaced with ethyl. 
Moreover, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PNP, CA, and EBTBA were also computed to unveil their intrinsic correlations with those of the two D–A dyes. It can be noted in Fig. 2d that the HOMO level of C272 is very much analogous to that of its PNP electron donor, while its LUMO level is manifestly inherited from that of its EBTBA electron acceptor. Thereby we presume that in future, predicting the energy levels of an EBTBA dye could be easier than its CA congener if the HOMO energy level of a certain electron-donor is already known.
Consistent with our previous studies on other D–A dyes with CA as the electron acceptor,18 there is a 30 nm blue shift of the low-energy absorption peak from 508 nm in THF (Fig. 2b) to 478 nm on titania (Fig. S2a†) upon chemical grafting of C271 onto titania. However, it is worthwhile noting that the C272 dye with EBTBA as electron acceptor displays less blue shifting (512 nm in THF; 507 nm on titania). This could be roughly explained by looking at the main LUMO location on the BT segment for C272 (see Fig. 2c); grafting of C272 onto titania via the carboxylate anchoring group possibly induced slight influence on LUMO. The loading amount (cm) of dye molecules on a mesoporous titania film was also surveyed, and a larger cm of 3.6 × 10−8 mol cm−2 mm−1 for C272 was found in comparison with that of 2.5 × 10−8 mol cm−2 mm−1 for C271. Overall, it can be seen in Fig. S2b† that the C272-grafted titania film has a smaller optical energy gap compared to the C271 counterpart. In addition, our ATR-FTIR measurements (Fig. S3†) showed that the cyano group for C271 and the triple bond for C272 are maintained during the dye-grating process, and that the presence of physically adsorbed dye molecules on the surface of titania is negligible for both dyes studied here.
We further examined the photovoltaic behaviour of DSCs made with the C271 and C272 dyes, in conjunction with a cobalt electrolyte composed of 0.25 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.05 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III) tris[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.7 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.05 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile. For details on cell fabrication, see ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 3a) were tested at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5G sunlight; extracted cell parameters are compiled in Table 1. The short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) of the C271 cell are 10.18 mA cm−2, 844 mV, and 0.776, respectively, generating a PCE of 6.7%. In good accord with the integrals of EQEs over the standard AM1.5G emission spectrum, the C272 dye evoked a notably improved JSC of 15.38 mA cm−2, which afforded an over 50% higher PCE of 10.4% along with an impressive VOC of 907 mV and a fairly good FF of 0.743. As seen in Table 1, the efficiency achieved with C272 without the use of any coadsorbate is comparable to that with the well-known zinc porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8,10 at the same conditions of cell fabrication and measurement in our lab. To take advantage of spectral complementation10 and similar photovoltage output of C272 and YD2-o-C8, we further used these two dyes to fabricate a co-sensitized cell exhibiting a JSC of 16.88 mA cm−2, VOC of 915 mV, FF of 0.754, and PCE of 11.6%. In contrast, the PCE of a co-sensitized cell with C271 and YD2-o-C8 is only 10.7%; more detail can be found in Fig. S6, ESI.† To examine the interfacial energetic and dynamic origins of VOC variation,19 we also carried out charge extraction (CE)20 and transient photovoltage decay (TPD)21 measurements. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, the dye alternation from C271 to C272 did not affect the conduction-band edge of titania with respect to the cobalt redox electrolyte. Actually, as seen in Fig. 3d, at a given density of photoinjected electrons in titania, the electron half-lifetime (tTPD1/2) for the C271 cell is much shorter than its C272 counterpart, accounting for the reduced VOC of this CA dye.

To sum up, we have demonstrated the merit of employing ethynylbenzothiadiazole-benzoic acid instead of cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor of organic donor–acceptor dyes by using a finely tailored N-annulated perylene electron donor. To the best of our knowledge,7,8 this is the first time that a metal-free perylene dye has achieved an over 10% power conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells, which is at the same level of the well-known zinc porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8. Our work has added a new member to the family of high-efficiency organic dyes, and also should encourage active explorations on selected exotic electron-rich and electron-deficient segments in future.

 	Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for metal-free D–A dyes C271 and C272 characteristic of an N-annulated perylene electron donor. Reagents and conditions: (i) 2-hexyldecyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate, KOH, DMF, 100 °C, 5 h; (ii) 4,4,4′,4′,5,5,5′,5′-octamethyl-2,2′-bi(1,3,2-dioxaborolane), Pd(dppf)Cl2, KOAc, DMSO, 45 °C, 5 h; (iii) 3-bromo-1-(2-hexyldecyl)-1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole, Pd(OAc)2, Sphos, K3PO4, dioxane–H2O (v/v, 5/1), reflux, 3 h; (iv) DMF, POCl3, DCE, 0 to 40 °C, 12 h; (v) cyanoacetic acid, ammonium acetate, ACN–CHCl3 (v/v, 1/2), reflux, 48 h; (vi) NBS, THF, 0 °C, 0.5 h; (vii) butyl-4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoate, Pd2(dba)3, P(t-Bu)3, Cs2CO3, dioxane, reflux, 5 h; (viii) NaOH, THF–H2O (v/v, 3/1), reflux, 8 h; (ix) phosphoric acid.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of C271 and C272 in THF. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide was used as supporting electrolyte and decamethylferrocene (DMFC) was added as internal reference. All potentials are further calibrated with ferrocene (Fc) as the reference. (b) Electronic absorption spectra of C271 and C272 in THF. (c) Optimized ground-state geometry of dye molecule in THF and topologies of its molecular orbitals relevant to S0 → S1 transition. The isodensity surface values are fixed at 0.03. (d) Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (value above color bar), highest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level (value under color bar), and energy gap (EL/H) of dye molecule as well as its electron-releasing and electron-withdrawing segments. PNP, N-annulated perylene capped with 2-hexyldecyloxybenzyl; CA, cyanoacrylic acid; EBTBA, ethynylbenzothiadiazole-benzoic acid. To improve computational efficiency, the large aliphatic substituents were replaced with ethyl.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of cells measured under irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5G sunlight. (b) External quantum efficiency (EQE) plotted against wavelength (λ) for cells made with a dye-grafted bilayer (4.2 + 5.0 μm thick) titania films in combination with cobalt electrolyte. (c) Plots of charge stored in a dye-grafted titania film (QCE) measured with charge extraction (CE) as a function of open-circuit photovoltage (VOC). (d) Comparison of electron half-lifetime (tTPD1/2) measured with the small-pulse transient photovoltage decay (TPD) method against QCE. An antireflection film is adhered to testing cell during measurements. Aperture area of employed metal mask is 0.160 cm2.
