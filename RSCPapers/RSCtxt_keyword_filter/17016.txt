    , Accepted 6th June 2018First published on 7th June 2018AbstractUtilizing high-energy beta particles emitted from radioisotopes for long-lifetime betavoltaic cells is a great challenge due to their low energy conversion efficiency (ECE). Here we report a betavoltaic cell fabricated using black titania nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) by electrochemical anodization and Ar-annealing techniques. The obtained samples show enhanced electrical conductivity as well as Vis-NIR light absorption by the introduction of oxygen vacancy (OV) and Ti3+ defects in reduced TiO2−x NTAs. A 20 mCi63 Ni source was assembled into TiO2 NTAs to form a sandwich-type betavoltaic cell. By I–V measurements, the Ar-annealed TiO2 NTAs at 650 °C exhibited a maximum ECE of 3.65% with Voc = 1.13 V, Jsc = 103.3 nA cm−2, and Pmax = 37 nW cm−2. In comparison with air-annealed TiO2 NTAs, the enhancement of the betavoltaic effect in reduced TiO2−x NTAs can be attributed to the suppression of e–h recombination induced by the generation of OV and Ti3+ defects, serving as electron donors as well as electron traps that not only contribute to the increase of electrical conductance, but also facilitate the charge carrier separation.
Introduction
Autonomous wireless sensing microsystems deployed in remote and inaccessible locations, such as deep sea, deep space, polar region, desert, and so on, have resulted in an ever-increasing demand for independent, sustainable, and maintenance-free power sources to meet the need of continuous operation for low-power electrical applications. A significant amount of research studies have been devoted to harvesting/converting energy from the environment, such as light energy, thermal energy, vibration energy, RF energy etc., but most of these approaches have to overcome the challenges with respect to the performance and reliability of energy harvesters and the limitation of application environments. The radioisotope-based energy conversion based on the betavoltaic effect is a promising strategy to meet the power demand of micro-systems due to their high energy-density, long life-time, safe operation, and insensitivity to the environment.1 The betavoltaic effect is the generation of voltage and electric current in a semiconductor p–n junction upon exposure to beta radiation. In this way, the electron–hole (e–h) pairs are produced by impact ionization of incident beta particles and are drawn off as current by the Volta effect when the beta particles emitted from a beta source traverse a semiconductor junction device.2,3
Si-Based betavoltaic devices using beta-emitting isotopes 90Sr–90Y were first prepared by Paul Rappaport's group in 1953, which converted 0.2% of the incident beta flux into electricity, but the device performance degraded quickly due to semiconductor radiation damage.4 From 1968 to 1974, Olsen's group developed a betavoltaic cell using stacked layers of Si cells coupled with a 147Pm source, which was able to achieve an energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 4% and 400 μW of power.5 While the betavoltaics were licensed for use in cardiac pacemakers, the products were not expanded further in the market due to the high cost and limited availability of 147Pm. From 1975 to 2008, studies on betavoltaics have been dedicated to improve ECE using different beta sources and semiconductors.6–9
According to Olsen's calculation model, the maximum theoretical ECE could achieve ∼30% for betavoltaics using wide band-gap semiconductors (WBGS). However, a large number of experiments have shown that the ECE was still less than 5% for the betavoltaics based on the planar diode structure fabricated using available WBGS, such as SiC, 4H-SiC, and GaN.8–11 It was considered that the planar diode structure has a lower specific surface area than the 3-dimensional (3D) one, which means a lower junction area and capture of incident beta flux. Sun's work demonstrated that the betavoltaic ECE of 3D porous silicon p–n diodes was around 10 times larger than that of the 2D planar one.6 3D porous diodes allow for a substantial increase of the junction area, and the porous channels can be used to store the radioisotope source, providing significant benefits for the improvement of betavoltaic ECE.
Titania nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) fabricated by direct electrochemical anodization of titanium (Ti) are suggested to be preferred candidates due to their wide bandgap (rutile: band gap 3.0 eV; anatase: 3.2 eV), high specific surface area, excellent chemical stability, environmental friendliness, and low-cost preparation.12 The vertically oriented TiO2 NTAs have shown highly photoconductive and photovoltaic performances in photocatalysis and solar cells as well as a high porosity and specific surface area in supercapacitors.13,14 In 2014, Kwon’ group reported a Pt/nanoporous TiO2 radiolytic cell for effective energy conversion from radioisotopes.15 However, the practical application of this cell would be limited due to the generation of H2 and O2 induced by electrochemical reactions. Generally, pristine TiO2 NTAs suffer from poor conductive behavior that is disadvantageous to charge carrier transport, thereby resulting in fast recombination of e–h pairs.
In this study we demonstrate an all solid-state betavoltaic cell fabricated using defect-engineered TiO2 NTAs. TiO2 NTAs were prepared by electrochemical anodization for the benefit of growing well-aligned TiO2 NTAs directly on the Ti substrate, which can be readily assembled as a betavoltaic cell with a radioisotope 63Ni source. A substantial improvement in the conductivity along with bandgap narrowing has been achieved by Ar-annealing TiO2 NTAs to introduce the defect states (e.g., oxygen vacancies (OVs) and Ti3+) into the energy gap of TiO2 NTAs.16 The mechanisms of defect-induced betavoltaic enhancement were also discussed.
Experimental
Preparation of TiO2 NTAs
TiO2 NTAs were fabricated using an electrochemical anodization method on Ti sheets (99.99% purity). Fig. 1 shows the schematic preparation processes of TiO2 NTAs. Before performing anodization, Ti sheets were cut into an appropriate size (22 mm × 30 mm × 0.1 mm) and then were degreased and cleaned using acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. After drying, Scotch tape was used to protect the backside of the Ti sheet. The electrolyte solution consisted of 0.5 wt% ammonium fluoride (NH4F, ≥99.99%), 97 vol% ethylene glycol (EG), and 3.0 vol% deionized water. The electrochemical anodization was performed in a double electrode cell (Pt as a counter electrode and Ti sheet as a working electrode) with magnetic stirring at a moderate rate under the constant potential of 50 V for 45 min at room temperature. After anodization, the samples were rinsed with absolute alcohol with low ultrasonic power to fully remove “grasslike” debris present on the surface of TiO2 NTAs. Next, the as-prepared TiO2 NTAs were annealed using different temperatures and atmospheres for performing a comparative study (see Fig. 1). The annealing conditions and the physical appearance of the samples are shown in Table S1.† In order to observe the intrinsic color of the TiO2 NTAs on Ti substrates, the TiO2 NTA films were peeled off from the Ti substrates and ground into powder.

Characterization of samples and devices
The surface morphologies and sizes of the TiO2 NTAs were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, ZEISS Sigma HD microscope). The crystal structures of TiO2 NTAs were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV) using Cu Kα radiation at 50 kV in a 2θ range from 20° to 80°. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals of TiO2 NTAs were recorded to confirm the presence of OV and Ti3+ defects by using an electron spin resonance spectrometer (BRUKER EMX-10/12). UV-Vis light absorbance spectra of TiO2 NTAs were recorded by using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary 5000 with integrating sphere attachment) with a fine BaSO4 powder as the reference in the wavelength range of 150–850 nm. The electron diffraction pattern of the TiO2 NTAs was obtained using transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100 TEM).
Package of betavoltaic cells and performance characterization
In order to investigate the performance of betavoltaics based on TiO2 NTAs annealed under different conditions, the radioisotope nickel-63 (63Ni) source with an average energy of 17.1 keV and a half-life of 100.1 years was used in tests as the pure beta-emitting source. The 63Ni beta source used is a solid planar source with a total activity of 20 mCi, which was prepared by electrodepositing 63Ni thin film on a 10 × 20 mm2 Ni sheet in an electrolyte of 63NiCl2. The betavoltaic cells were packaged as a sandwich structure (Ni/63Ni/TiO2 NTAs/Ti) (see Fig. 2) through a mechanical fixture to compress the 63Ni/Ni source plate on the top surface of the TiO2 NTAs on the Ti substrate. The performance of the betavoltaic cells was characterized in a Faraday cage by I–V measurements using a Keithley Model 2450 source meter.

Results and discussion
Pristine TiO2 presents a high resistivity, which results in a high internal resistance and a high possibility for electrons and holes to recombine when it is applied to solar cells.17 Betavoltaic cells similar to solar cells encounter the same issue when using TiO2 NTAs as energy collection and conversion materials. To address this limitation, extensive efforts have been devoted to modifying pristine TiO2. A common strategy is to dope pristine TiO2 with foreign impurity species (e.g., non-metallic N, F, C, and metallic Zn, Fe, Mn etc.).18–21 However, the introduction of dopants generally serves as carrier recombination centers and lead to the degradation of photocatalytic activity and the decrease of the ECE of solar cells.18,20,22 Another strategy is to self-dope TiO2 with the OV and Ti3+ defects by annealing TiO2 under a reductive/inert atmosphere (e.g., H2, He, N2 and Ar gas) or vacuum.13,20,23,24 In addition, plasma treatment was also used for self-doping TiO2.22 In order to avoid the use of hazardous and expensive gas, a simple and low cost Ar-annealing approach was used in our experiments to obtain the preferred samples. It was reported that OVs can be generated in pure TiO2 when the elevated temperature is larger than 400 °C by annealing pristine TiO2 in Ar gas,20 and pure anatase TiO2 is considered widely to begin to transform irreversibly to rutile in air at 600 °C.13,25 Therefore, the annealing temperatures used in our experiments were controlled at 450 °C and 650 °C, respectively. Air-annealing was also performed on TiO2 NTAs to prepare the contrastive sample with little OVs or no OVs. Distinct color changes are observed as shown in Fig. 1 and Table S1.† The samples annealed at 450 °C and 650 °C in air appear deep-gray and light-gray, respectively, while both samples annealed at 450 °C and 650 °C in Ar appear black, which stand in a sharp contrast with the light-brown color of the pristine sample. The color change in post-annealed samples indicates different extents of absorption in the visible-light region in comparison with the pristine sample, which could be ascribed to the increased defect density of OVs or Ti3+.20,26 After scraping the nanotubes from the Ti substrate by mechanical polishing and grinding them into powder, the TiO2 nanotube powders with regard to the unannealed sample and both air-annealed samples appear light-brown, while the powders corresponding to both Ar-annealed samples appear black. The color difference between the nanotube film and powder in air-annealed samples reveals the critical role of the porous array structure in influencing the light-absorption besides the defect density.

Fig. 3(a) shows the typical FESEM image of the top view of the TiO2 NTAs, and their partial enlarged image is shown in Fig. 3(b). TiO2 NTAs consist of compacted and highly ordered cylindrical nanotubes with a uniform pore diameter of around 100 nm and a wall thickness of around 10 nm. Comparing the FESEM images of TiO2 NTAs before and after thermal treatment using different temperatures and atmospheres (see Fig. S1†), it is confirmed that there are no obvious changes in the morphology and size.27Fig. 3(c) shows a typical 3D view of TiO2 NTAs. It can be seen that the TiO2 NTA film features self-aligned upright nanotubes standing vertically to the Ti substrate, with a grown nanotube-length of around 8 μm and a relatively flat top surface. The high-magnified FESEM image in the cross-sectional view of the TiO2 NTAs (see Fig. 3(d)) exhibits close-packed and aligned nanotubes with large amounts of tube-to-tube connecting lines that can be seen in the exterior surface of the nanotube wall. The nanotube arrays could provide a 3D conductive matrix through these vertically oriented thinner walls as well as the horizontal connecting lines between nanotubes.26 Furthermore, the close-packed nanotubes create the junction barriers between the neighboring nanotubes, which are beneficial to the separation of e–h pairs.28

Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 NTAs unannealed and annealed under different conditions. It can be seen that the phase of unannealed TiO2 NTAs is amorphous and all annealed TiO2 NTAs exhibit crystallization characteristics with strong diffraction peaks of the anatase phase (101) at 25.2°. In particular, TiO2 NTAs annealed at 650 °C include some weak diffraction peaks of the rutile phase (110) at 27.4°, which are as a result of anatase-to-rutile phase transformation when the annealing temperature is larger than 600 °C. The HRTEM measurements for the reduced TiO2−x sample annealed at 650 °C in Ar (see Fig. S2(a) and (b)†) also confirm the presence of anatase (101) with an interplanar spacing d = 0.351 nm and rutile (110) with d = 0.246 nm. At the same time, Ti3O5 (−411) with d = 0.235 nm and Ti8O15 (10−1) with d = 0.296 nm were also found (see Fig. S2(c) and (d)†). It was reported that the transformation rate of anatase-to-rutile would increase exponentially as the temperature increased.25 The peak intensity ratio of the anatase (101) peak at 25.2° to the rutile (110) peak at 27.4° (IA/IR) is used to assess the relative quantities of anatase-to-rutile phase transformation. The calculated ratios are IA/IR|650Air = 8.2 and IA/IR|650Ar = 3.58 for TiO2 NTAs annealed at 650 °C in Ar and air, respectively. It can be found that the anatase-to-rutile transformation can be promoted when the annealing atmosphere is changed from air to Ar. It is noticeable that the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation is not instantaneous when the elevated temperature reaches a transformation point. The transformation is time dependent because it is a reconstructive process, which involves the breaking and reforming of bonds. It has been perceived widely that OVs enhance anatase-to-rutile phase transformation.25 The rearrangement of Ti–O bonds due to the oxygen loss in reduced TiO2−x (lattice relaxation) results in the formation of the rutile phase during heating under reductive atmospheres. The crystallized TiO2 can improve not only the charge carrier transport by the increase of carrier mobility, but also the charge carrier separation by the trapping of electrons in rutile and the consequent reduction in e–h recombination.29,30 This has been confirmed that the mixed-phase photocatalysts with rutile/anatase compositions exhibited enhanced photoactivity relative to single-phase TiO2.25,31 It can be deduced that the synergy of both anatase and rutile phases can provide significant benefit to the enhancement of the betavoltaic effect through the suppression of e–h recombination.

To verify the presence of OV and Ti3+ defects in reduced TiO2 NTAs, room temperature EPR spectra are recorded in Fig. 5. It can be seen that TiO2 NTAs annealed in Ar show stronger and sharper EPR signals than those annealed in air, while no signal is seen for the unannealed sample. In the EPR spectra of reduced TiO2−x, the sharp signals at g = 2.003 are generally assigned to surface electron trapping OV defects, while the signals at g = 1.980, as shown in the magnified insets of Fig. 5, are assigned to the Ti3+ defects.13 The presence of OV and Ti3+ defects in reduced TiO2 NTAs can also be confirmed from XPS measurement as reported in ref. 17 and 32. Although the EPR signals of TiO2 NTAs annealed in air appear extremely weak, they still demonstrate the presence of a little OVs because of surface effects and size effects of TiO2 nanotubes,18 which can be verified from the slight change in sample color as compared to the unannealed sample. The thermal treatment under a reduced Ar atmosphere leads to the escape of oxygen molecules from TiO2 and thus the generation of a large amount of OVs. The formation of oxygen vacancies can be expressed in eqn (1): (1)where species are written in standard Kröger–Vink notation. Oxo denotes the lattice oxygen;  denotes the oxygen vacancy, which is an electron donor with two positive charges, and two quasi-free-electrons are trapped in this donor in order to maintain the local charge neutrality. These localized electrons will become free-electrons when an external electric or photoexcitation is used, resulting in the increase of conductivity. When the annealing temperature is further increased, i.e., from 450 °C to 650 °C, more energy is supplied and the trapped electrons in OVs are driven away and transferred to the nearest neighboring Ti4+ ions around the OV site, resulting in the decrease of OV defects and the increase of Ti3+ defects.

It is noted from Fig. 5 that the enhancement in the EPR signal of Ti3+ defects in TiO2 NTAs Ar-annealed at 650 °C accompanies with the increase of anatase-to-rutile phase transformation (see Fig. 4). Morgan and Watson found the same results and revealed that the formation of OVs is slightly more favorable in anatase than rutile, while Ti3+ defects form more easily in rutile than anatase.33 This also accounts for the fact that the EPR signal of Ti3+ defects is far weaker than that of OVs in reduced TiO2−x NTAs due to the small amount of rutile phase. Under oxygen-rich conditions (e.g. air-annealing), both OV and Ti3+ defects were difficult to generate due to the requirement of high formation energies. However, it was reported that by hydrogen annealing the density of Ti3+ defect states can reach a maximum value at 600 °C, while the OV density remains constant from 400 to 520 °C.34 OV and Ti3+ defects can form a shallow donor level (electron traps) just below the conduction band, which are considered to not only contribute to the enhanced carrier density beneficial to the charge carrier transport, but also largely affect the charge separation process by the trapping of electrons.35,36
Besides the significant enhancement of charge transport and separation, the presence of OV and Ti3+ defects can effectively expand the visible light absorption range of TiO2 NTAs. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the air-annealed TiO2 NTAs are only active under UV irradiation, while the photo-response of reduced TiO2 NTAs is effectively extended to the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions. This is in line with the visual impression of the darkness of the reduced TiO2 NTAs (see Table S1†). The visible and infrared absorption is positively related to the generation of OVs and Ti3+ in reduced TiO2. The bandgaps of TiO2 NTAs are estimated from the main absorption edge of the profile, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Both air-annealed TiO2 NTAs have the same bandgap (Eg) of about 3.11 eV, which are close to the 3.09 eV of pristine TiO2 NTAs reported by Kang et al.,35 while the bandgaps of TiO2 NTAs Ar-annealed at 450 °C and 650 °C are 3.00 and 3.05 eV, respectively. Both band-gap narrowing and enhanced absorbance in Vis-NIR are due to the formation of defect energy levels in the band gap.
 Fig. 6  (a) UV-Vis-NIR light absorbance spectra of annealed TiO2 NTAs and (b) the estimation of the band gap of annealed TiO2 NTAs. 
The energy levels of localized donor states originating from two dominant OV states, i.e. neutral OV  and positive OV , are located below the conduction band (CB) of the reduced TiO2. The  defect is a shallower donor state than  in both anatase and rutile TiO2, while the Ti3+ defect with the captured electron from the next-neighbor OV is also a shallow donor state in rutile TiO2.37 These donor state densities in both anatase and rutile TiO2 increase with the increase of OV density, and can even overlap the CB forming the CB tail in the case of highly deficient anatase titania.20 Therefore, electronic transitions from both OV and Ti3+ localized states to the CB, and from the valence band (VB) to both OV and Ti3+ localized states are responsible for Vis-NIR light absorption of reduced TiO2−x NTAs. Furthermore, electronic transitions from the VB to the tailed CB in the case of black TiO2 account for bandgap narrowing.
The electrical properties of TiO2 NTAs were determined in a Ni/TiO2 NTA/Ti structure, which was packaged by a mechanical fixture compressing a Ni plate on the top surface of the TiO2 NTAs on the Ti substrate for a fully physical contact between the TiO2 NTAs and Ni plate. The physical model of the Ni/TiO2 NTAs/Ti is considered as a back-to-back double Schottky barrier diode, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The asymmetrical barrier heights are formed on both metals/semiconductor interfaces of Ni/TiO2 and Ti/TiO2, resulting in asymmetrical I–V characteristics in forward and reverse bias regions. It is noticeable that the extreme surface curvature of the nanotube, resulting in enhanced surface activity, could lead to the formation of junction barriers between neighboring nanotubes (NT–NT junction barriers), as shown in the energy band diagram of Fig. 7(a).28 The NT–NT junction barriers enable orthogonal carrier separation (holes to the surface of the tube-wall, and electrons to the inner of the tube-wall) beneficial to the suppression of carrier recombination.

Fig. 7(b) shows the I–V characteristics of Ni/TiO2 NTA/Ti devices based on TiO2 NTAs annealed under different conditions in the dark and without beta irradiation. All of the Ni/TiO2 NTA/Ti devices exhibit standard diode I–V characteristics with different turn-on voltages and reverse dark currents, which arise from the bandgap of semiconductors and the work function of metals as well as the conductivity of TiO2 NTAs related to the density of OV and Ti3+ defect states in the TiO2 NTAs. The high turn-on voltages, i.e., 2.1 V and 2.7 V for TiO2 NTAs annealed at 450 °C and 650 °C in air, respectively, are typical of a high-resistivity wide band-gap semiconductor diode structure, while the relatively low turn-on voltages, i.e., 1.3 V and 1.8 V for TiO2 NTAs annealed at 450 °C and 650 °C in Ar, respectively, imply the reduction in the resistivity of reduced TiO2−x NTAs. This deduction is in line with the measured results of differential conductance (dI/dV) calculated from the forward I–V characteristics, as shown in Fig. 7(c). Ar-Annealed TiO2 NTAs at 450 °C have the maximum saturation conductance value of 0.01 S, which should be ascribed to the high donor density induced by OVs in reduced TiO2−x NTAs. By contrast, this value is decreased by two orders of magnitude, reaching ∼10−4 S when the Ar-annealed temperature is increased to 650 °C. As illustrated in the former part, the OV-assisted transformation of the anatase-to-rutile phase decreases the OV density, thereby resulting in the reduction of conductivity. The air-annealed TiO2 NTAs exhibit relatively lower conductance than reduced TiO2−x NTAs, which can be well understood that there are little OVs generated under TiO2 under rich-oxygen conditions.
The leakage currents of devices were determined by extrapolating the linear region of the semi-log forward-bias in I–V curves to zero applied voltage. As shown in Fig. 7(d), the typical values of the leakage current were ∼10−13 A cm−2 for all samples except for air-annealed TiO2 NTAs with a leakage current of ∼10−10 A cm−2. For betavoltaic cells, the leakage current is mainly associated with the recombination of the beta-induced e–h pairs, which is the main reason that results in the low ECE of the betavoltaic cells. It is believed that OVs and Ti3+ located on the thinner nanotube-walls of TiO2 NTAs are considered to be surface defects, which can serve as charge carrier traps to prevent the e–h recombination effectively.20,35,36

Fig. 8(a) shows the I–V characteristics of betavoltaic cells based on TiO2 NTAs annealed under different conditions. All of the betavoltaic cells exhibit the betavoltaic effect with stable short-circuit current (Isc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) in comparison with devices without the beta source. The J–V (see Fig. S3(a)†) and P–V (see Fig. 8(b)) characteristics are calculated from the results of I–V, and the electrical parameters of betavoltaic cells are extracted and presented in Table 1.

The conversion efficiency is calculated as follows: (2)where Pmax is the maximum output power of the betavoltaic device, Psource is the radiation power of the 63Ni source, Φ is the source activity (mCi), Eavg is the average beta energy of the isotope (eV), and e is the electron charge (C). FF is the filling factor, which can be expressed as FF = Pmax/Isc·Voc.
It can be found from Table 1 that the betavoltaic cell based on Ar-annealed TiO2 NTAs at 650 °C has a maximum ECE of 3.65% with Voc = 1.13 V, Jsc = 103.3 nA cm−2, and Pmax = 37 nW cm−2. The Pmax of betavoltaic cells based on reduced TiO2−x NTAs is about two times as high as that of the air-annealed TiO2 NTAs, which indicates the critical role of reduction-annealing-induced OV defects for the enhancement of the betavoltaic effect. Furthermore, an around 30% increase in Pmax is found when the Ar-annealed temperature is increased from 450 to 650 °C, which could be attributed to the introduction of Ti3+ defects in the rutile phase through the enhancement of charge carrier separation.
In terms of current betavoltaic cells, the unique advantage of black TiO2 NTAs in a large specific surface area was not fully utilized due to the use of the planar 63Ni source. A preferable strategy is to deposit the radioisotope source into nanotube channels to increase the radioactivity per unit area in TiO2 NTAs, thereby enhancing the total output power of betavoltaic cells. Another preferable strategy to increase the output power is the use of a multi-cell cascade system through a series–parallel connection of cells for trickle charging of lithium-ion batteries, as developed by NanoTritium betavoltaic cells from City Labs.38

Fig. 8(c), (d), and Fig. S3(b)† show the I–V, P–V and J–V characteristics of two betavoltaic cells and their connection in series/parallel, respectively. The measured results are extracted and presented in Table S2.† It is noted that both betavoltaic cells used were based on Ar-reduced TiO2 NTAs at 650 °C and were optimized to have similar output characteristics.
It can be seen from Table S2† that the open-circuit voltage in series is equal to the sum of two separate cells, while there is little change in the short-circuit current. In contrast, the short-circuit current in parallel is equal to the sum of two separate cells, while there is little change in the open-circuit voltage. That is to say that the electrical outputs of betavoltaic cells in series/parallel follow the Ohm's law, and thus the maximum output power in series/parallel is the sum total of all separate cells, as shown in Table S2.† This means that a highly cascaded betavoltaic system is able to achieve high output power for practical applications.
Conclusion
In summary, we have prepared well-aligned TiO2 NTAs using electrochemical anodization. By thermal treatment in Ar, black TiO2 NTAs (reduced TiO2−x NTAs) were obtained and exhibited enhanced electrical conductivity as well as Vis-NIR light absorption. The XRD measurements show the formation of a rutile/anatase mixed-phase through OV-assisted anatase-to-rutile phase transformation in Ar-annealing TiO2 NTAs at 650 °C. The presence of OV and Ti3+ defects in reduced TiO2−x NTAs was verified by EPR measurements. It is suggested that OV and Ti3+ defects serve as electron donors as well as electron traps, not only contributing to the enhanced carrier density beneficial to the charge carrier transport, but also facilitating the charge carrier separation. As a result, the carrier lifetime is prolonged and thus e–h recombination is suppressed. I–V measurements feature the high conductance and low leakage current of black TiO2 NTAs. A 20 mCi 63Ni source was packaged to post-annealing TiO2 NTAs to form a sandwich-type betavoltaic cell (Ni/63Ni/TiO2NTAs/Ti). By I–V measurements, the Ar-annealed TiO2 NTAs at 650 °C have a maximum ECE of 3.65% with Voc = 1.13 V, Jsc = 103.3 nA cm−2, and Pmax = 37 nW cm−2. It was also demonstrated that the electrical outputs of betavoltaic cells in series/parallel follow the Ohm's law, which means that a highly cascaded betavoltaic system is able to achieve high output power for practical applications.
