    , Accepted 23rd November 2011First published on 12th December 2011AbstractThree new fullerene derivatives with one, two, and three PCBM units, respectively, were synthesized and their photovoltaic properties were investigated. The dumb-belled PCBM derivative showed better photovoltaic performance than PCBM, suggesting that the covalently linked fullerene aggregates are promising acceptor materials in solar cells.

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)1 active layer in the structure have attracted great attention owing to their advantages of easy fabrication, low cost, lightness and flexibility.2–4 Typically, the BHJ layer is a blend film of conjugated polymer donor and soluble fullerene derivative acceptor. Numerous conjugated polymers have been synthesized for use as donor materials in the PSCs,5–8 among which poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is the most representative polymer donor and used widely in photovoltaic devices. In addition, various fullerene derivatives were also synthesized in order to improve the photovoltaic performance since [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was first introduced as PSC acceptor in 1995.1 Almost all of the [60]fullerene derivatives possess mono-substituted [6,6]-closed structures, including methano-[60]fullerene derivatives, pyrrolidino-[60]fullerene derivatives, and so on. Actually, these derivatives share the same parent [6,6]-closed [60]fullerene structure, indicating that they should have very similar electrochemical and spectroscopic properties. In these cases, such [60]fullerene derivatives should show very similar photovoltaic properties as PCBM. As a result, the modification of the PCBM's structure by changing the substituents aiming at more efficient acceptor materials seldom gave satisfactory achievements and only a few of them showed better performance than PCBM.9–14 It is notable that some amazing results were obtained by using non-PCBM-like derivatives.15–22 For example, Liet al. synthesized a kind of indene modified fullerene, which has exciting photovoltaic properties.18–20 The PSCs based on the indene-fullerene derivatives as acceptors with P3HT as donor gave power conversion efficiency (PCE) values more than 5% and the indene-C60 bisadduct based PSC even achieved a PCE value of 6.48%.18 Martin et al. studied the photovoltaic properties of diphenylmethanofullerenes (DMPs) and they found that PSCs based on such kind of fullerene derivatives possessed remarkable larger open circuit voltage values than PSCs based on PCBM, despite the DMPs' similar reduction potential values to PCBM. The DMPs even displayed superior photovoltaic performance to PCBM at low illumination.23–26
Since fullerene-based polymeric photovoltaic devices are in the solid state and phase separation of donor and acceptor is essential for the dissociation of excitons and the transport of charges, the aggregation of fullerene derivatives in the active layer plays an important role in the performance of the devices.27–31 Up to now, most of the fullerene derivatives contain one fullerene unit and only a few multifullerene derivatives were involved in the PSCs with unsatisfactory performance.32–35 However, multifullerene derivatives constructed with the PCBM unit have never been designed for photovoltaic devices. Considering the outstanding photovoltaic properties of PCBM, the PCBM-based multifullerenes are rationally expected to display excellent performance, even better than PCBM.
In this context, we designed and synthesized a series of fullerene derivatives based on PCBM, using covalent bonds to “bind” PCBMs together. The structures of the PCBM derivatives in this study are presented in Scheme 1. MP is a mono-PCBM derivative, BP is a bis-PCBM derivative with a dumb-belled structure, and TP has a trimer-PCBM structure. Although the tetramer-PCBM was also synthesized, its very poor solubility hindered further research into photovoltaic devices. We find that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of MP, BP and TP up-shift a little from that of PCBM. The PSCs based on P3HT as donor and the three derivatives as acceptors, respectively, demonstrate PCE values more than 2%. The dumb-belled PCBM derivative BP shows the best PCE value of 3.70%, even better than PCBM (3.22%) under the same experimental conditions. These results indicate that the appropriate covalent linkage of fullerenes could significantly influence the performance of the fullerene-based PSCs.

        MP, BP and TP were synthesized through the reactions of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA) with neopentyl alcohol, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol and 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol, respectively. PCBA and PCBM were prepared according to the literature.36
The absorption properties are very important for the photovoltaic materials, especially in the visible region. The absorption spectra of MP, BP, TP and PCBM in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 1. The absorption curves of the four derivatives have similar shape with a sharp peak at 430 nm, which reflects the partially broken symmetry (C2ν) of the fullerene in comparison with pristine C60 (Ih). In the visible region, BP and TP have obviously stronger absorption than MP and PCBM, which should be ascribed to their more C60 units in the molecules.

The electrochemical properties of the PCBM derivatives are studied by cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. 2, the cyclic voltammograms exhibit three well-defined, reversible reduction/reoxidation waves over a negative range. Table 1 lists the half-wave potentials of the reduction process of the fullerene derivatives. The reduction potentials of MP, BP and TP have a little shift compared with that of PCBM. The electronic energy levels (especially LUMO level) of the fullerene derivatives are crucial for their application in PSCs as acceptor, which can be estimated from the onset reduction potential (Eredon) according to the following equation: LUMO = −(Eredon + 4.71) (eV), where the unit of Eredon is volts versusAg/Ag+.37 The LUMO energy levels of MP, BP, TP and PCBM are also shown in Table 1. There is a little up-shift of the LUMO energy levels for the three new PCBM derivatives compared with that of PCBM, suggesting that the influence of the linkage of the C60 through chemical bonds on the LUMO energy level is very weak.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the new fullerene derivatives, the PSCs based on P3HT as donor and the three compounds as acceptors were examined. Devices were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:fullerene derivatives (1:1, w/w)/Ca/Al.18 Twenty cells were prepared for each study carried out with the fullerene derivatives. For comparison, the PSC device based on P3HT/PCBM was also made under the same experimental conditions.
The current density–voltage (I–V) curves of the PSCs under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3. The photovoltaic performance data of the PSCs, including the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Isc), fill factor (FF) and PCE values are collected in Table 2. It can be seen that all the PSC devices demonstrate satisfying performances with PCE values more than 2%. The Voc values of MP, BP, and TP based-PSCs are similar to that of PCBM based-PSC, consistent with their similarity in the LUMO values. The dumb-belled PCBM BP-based PSC demonstrates a high Isc value of 10.34 mA cm−2, increased by 22% in comparison with that of PCBM-based PSC. The significant improvement of the Isc results in a high PCE of 3.70% for BP-based PSC, which is 15% increased compared with the value (3.22%) of PCBM-based PSC. Although MP shows the best solubility among the four derivatives, its comprehensive properties are not excellent, which indicates the solubility could not determine the final performance.38 The low Isc and FF values of the PSC with MP as acceptor result in a low efficiency of the device. As for the TP-based PSC, its lowest Isc and PCE values among the samples are mainly due to the poor solubility of the trimer.

The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the PSCs based on P3HT with MP, BP, TP and PCBM are shown in Fig. 4. The EQE values in the range 450–650 nm are ascribed to the absorption of P3HT, suggesting the effect of photo-electron conversion. The devices based on three PCBM derivatives and PCBM display different EQE values, which are consistent with their tendencies in Isc and PCE values (BP > PCBM > MP > TP). The dramatically higher EQE value of P3HT/BP compared with those of P3HT/MP, P3HT/TP and P3HT/PCBM indicates an efficient photo-electron conversion process in the P3HT/BP device.

The BHJ layer is the crucial part of the PSC and its morphology is very important for the photovoltaic performance of the device. The efficient charge generation and transport are strongly dependent on the dispersion of polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors.39–41 As a powerful tool, the atomic force microscope (AFM) is widely used to study the nanomorphology of organic blends in thin films. The surface topography usually gives an insight into the film formation ability and the phase separation tendency of the components. The AFM topography and phase images of the P3HT/fullerene derivatives (1:1, w/w) blend films are shown in Fig. 5. It is obvious that phase separation in the three blend films has occurred and the fullerene derivative aggregates are confined within the P3HT phase (Fig. 5b, d, and f). Such an interpenetrating network in the active film could facilitate the formation of efficient exciton dissociation interfaces and bicontinuous charge transport channels.11 From the phase images, we can see the P3HT/MP blend film has the best phase separation (Fig. 5b), which should be attributed to the good solubility of MP. Accordingly, the surface rms (root-mean-square) roughness of the P3HT/MP is 13.7 nm, less than those of P3HT/BP (15.4 nm) and P3HT/TP (21.8 nm). The relatively smooth P3HT/MP film might suggest the deficient self-organization of P3HT, which is important for the ordered structure formation in the film. However, a too rough surface morphology of the blend film could induce poorer contact between the active layer and cathode.42 In this study, the too rough surface of the P3HT/TP film should partly account for its poor photovoltaic performance.

In conclusion, three PCBM derivatives with the PCBM-like substructure, including [60]fullerene dimer and trimer, are synthesized to investigate the effect of aggregation of [60]fullerene by chemical bonds on the photovoltaic properties. Although the PCBM derivatives have similar LUMO energy levels and the PSCs based on them as acceptor materials have similar Voc, the Isc and PCE values of the PSCs are quite different. The device using the dumb-belled PCBM derivative as acceptor shows the best Isc and PCE values among the new derivatives, even much better than PCBM-based PSC. These results indicate that the aggregation of fullerenes through covalent bonds has obvious influences on their photovoltaic properties. Appropriate linkages of the fullerenes on the molecular level could significantly improve the performance of the solar cells based on such multifullerene derivatives.
