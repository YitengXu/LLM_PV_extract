    , Accepted 5th January 2022First published on 6th January 2022AbstractMulti-component organic photovoltaics (OPVs), e.g., ternary blends, are effective for high performance, while the fundamental understanding from the molecular to device level is lacking. To address this issue, we here systematically study the working mechanism of ternary OPVs based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). With both molecular dynamics simulations and morphology characterization, we identify that when adding another larger band gap and highly miscible NFA, namely IT-4F or BTP-S2, into the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 blend, the NFAs undergo molecular intermixing selectively with BTP-eC9. This causes the composition-dependent band gap and charge recombination, and hence the composition-dependent VOC. While the charge recombination still dominantly occurs at the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 interface, BTP-S2 or IT-4F plays an auxiliary role in facilitating charge transfer and suppressing non-radiative decay. Interestingly, intermolecular end-group packing in the intermixed blend is improved compared to that in pristine films, leading to higher carrier mobility. These synergistic effects significantly improve the power conversion efficiency of the device to an outstanding value of 18.7% (certified value of 18.3%).

Broader context
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted great interest due to their advantages of low cost, light-weight, flexibility, transparency, etc. However, the disadvantage of relatively low efficiency needs to be overcome for further commercialization of OPVs. A multi-component (MC) strategy has been demonstrated to be effective to further improve the device performance over binary systems. However, the community of OPVs lacks the fundamental understanding on the working mechanism of a MC device. Particularly, previous models, i.e. charge transfer, energy transfer, parallel, and alloyed orbital models can hardly interpret the interesting optoelectronic phenomena associated with MC-OPVs, e.g. composition dependent open-circuit voltage (VOC), reduced non-radiative charge recombination, and improved charge transport. By viewing MC-OPVs from a novel perspective, this work provides a comprehensive understanding on the working mechanism of MC-OPVs from the molecule to device level. For the first time, the composition dependent VOC is interpreted from photovoltaic device physics, that is, the composition dependent bandgap and charge recombination properties, which get enlarged and suppressed, respectively. By molecular dynamics simulations, these are further unveiled to be tightly associated with the well intermixed and enhanced inter-molecular interactions, which also contributes to the improved charge transport. Finally, a certified PCE of 18.3%, ranking among the highest values in OPVs, has been demonstrated.

Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are emerging as a promising renewable energy source for the future, due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility, transparency, etc.1–3 Recently, the device performance of OPVs has progressed rapidly due to the synergistic efforts on molecular design, morphology control, interfacial engineering, and device architecture design.4–7 Particularly, the advent of Y6 based non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has successfully boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs to a record certified value of 18.2% due to their unique optoelectronic properties, such as three-dimensional packing induced low exciton binding energy, good charge transport, etc.8
Besides molecular design, composing multiple-component (MC) OPVs, e.g. ternary blends, where more components than the typical donor:acceptor (D:A) binary systems are blended, seems a panacea to further improve the device performance.8–11 In the pioneering work of Koppe et al., ternary OPVs have been demonstrated to possess a variety of advantages, such as improved photo-current generation, modulating morphology, etc.12 Particularly, constructing a molecular alloy-like ternary blend proves the most promising way toward record-high device performance.13–15 The recent advent of NFAs also triggered the general interest in constructing ternary blends, as summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).16–18 Recently, our group designed BTP-M or BTP-S2 as the third component to blend with PBDB-TF:Y6 or PBDB-TF:BO-4Cl, and achieved a certified efficiency of 17.03% and 18.16%, respectively.19,20 Besides improving the device performance, interesting composition-dependent optoelectronic properties have been generally observed in ternary OPVs, including composition-dependent VOC, reduced non-radiative decay, intact/improved charge transfer and charge transport, etc.21–24
However, the fundamental understanding is severely lacking or under debate; hence, there is no explicit explanation to the improved device performance and the inherent composition-dependent optoelectronic properties as mentioned above. Although the charge transfer, energy transfer, or parallel models are proposed to describe the possible carrier dynamics within the ternary OPVs, the composition-dependent VOC is still unclear.25–27 The molecular “alloy” model provides an intuitive understanding of the composition-dependent VOC in ternary blends, by considering the alloyed molecular orbitals.28–30 But a subsequent question rises regarding whether the two molecules are working as a whole or individually in the alloyed model. Particularly, two D:A interfaces or charge recombination centers will co-exist in a ternary blend, but less attention has been paid to identify the individual role of the two interfaces, although this is critical to understand the charge recombination behaviour in ternary OPVs. Moreover, the charge transport properties are largely intact or even increased in the intermixed molecular alloy, and this remains quite confusing considering the supposedly “interrupted” molecular packing.31–33
To clarify the mechanism of ternary OPVs, here we comprehensively investigate the nature of optoelectronic property variations in the molecular intermixing ternary OPVs (Fig. 1a) based on PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9, where IT-4F or BTP-S2 is added as the third component, and their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1b.34–36 We unveil the improved device performance as originating from the increased VOC and FF, and attribute it to the enlarged band gap, suppressed non-radiative decay and improved charge transport, which are results of good intermixing at the molecular level and enhanced intermolecular interaction. First, we identify that the incorporation of a miscible third component induces a significant composition-dependent blue-shift in optical spectroscopy or an enlarged band gap. Although there are two D:A interfaces or CT states, the charge recombination center is dominated by the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 interface in the ternary OPV, with the third component playing a role in facilitating the charge separation and suppressing the non-radiative decay. As a result, for the first time, the composition-dependent VOC in ternary OPVs is well interpreted via variation of the band gap and charge recombination properties with compositions. The variation of the band gap and charge recombination properties directly contribute to the composition-dependent VOC in ternary OPVs. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics and morphology characterization studies unveil good intermixing at the molecular level in the BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 blend and enhanced intermolecular interactions between the hetero-terminal groups in the BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 blend, which ultimately contributes to the improved carrier mobility, enlarged band gap, and reduced non-radiative decay. As a result, the device PCE is improved to 18.7%, and a certified PCE of 18.3% is achieved, ranking among the highest certified PCEs of OPVs reported thus far.

Results and discussion
Device performance
We have prepared ternary OPVs by adding different third components, BTP-S2 or IT-4F, to the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 system (Fig. 1a). Their energy levels are measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. 1c shows the characteristic J–V curves of the ternary OPVs of different compositions, with device parameters summarized in Table 1, and the corresponding EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 1d. As shown, the binary PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 device exhibits an optimal PCE of 17.79%, and the PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 device shows an optimal PCE of 15.27%. The latter exhibits a higher VOC due to the up-shifted LUMO level (Fig. S1, ESI†), but a lower JSC due to less coverage with the solar spectrum or the larger band gap (Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 1d). Ternary blend OPVs are fabricated by changing the BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 ratio, while keeping the D:A ratio constant. As shown in Fig. 1c, with increasing loading amount of BTP-S2, the VOC of ternary OPVs gradually increases and exhibits a very straightforward linear dependence (Fig. 1e). While, the JSC and FF remain high with the BTP-S2 content below 50%, keeping JSC about 26 mA cm−2 and FF above 78%, respectively. The improvement in VOC with intact JSC and FF yields an apparent enhancement in the device performance of ternary OPVs. The optimal performance was achieved using 25% BTP-S2, resulting in a PCE of 18.7%, with a certified PCE of 18.3%, thus far among the highest values of OPVs. The certification report is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The improvement in device efficiency is mainly attributed to the increased VOC and FF.

Fig. 1d shows the EQE spectra of the ternary OPVs with different weight ratios of BTP-S2. The EQE response tail is around 900 nm, which is consistent with the absorbing band tail of the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 film. With the addition of BTP-S2, it is clear that the EQE band tail response gradually becomes blue-shifted. The method developed by Rau is used to derive the photovoltaic band gap of the ternary OPVs.37 As summarized in Table S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 1e, the band gap of the ternary blend gets gradually enlarged with increasing BTP-S2 content. In addition, the integrated photocurrents from the EQE spectra agree well with the JSC measured from the J–V curves, which completes the internal check on the validity of the measured device performance in our lab.
Also, we select IT-4F as the third component in the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 system, and construct ternary OPVs with similar processing. The J–V characteristic curves with different amounts of IT-4F are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown, the VOC slightly increases in the ternary blend compared to the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 binary blend. However, the variation trends of other parameters are quite similar to those of ternary OPVs with BTP-S2 as the third component. This can be intuitively correlated with the relatively low VOC of the PBDB-TF:IT-4F binary PV, as comparable to that of the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 system, suggesting the importance of incorporating a component with a larger VOC (paring with the same donor). As a result, the ternary blend OPVs with IT-4F exhibit only a slight enhancement to 17.92% with 25% IT-4F content. Interestingly, increasing the IT-4F content also induces the gradual blue-shifting (or Eg enlargement) in the EQE spectra of ternary OPVs (Fig. S5, ESI†).
It should be noted that the variations in the above optoelectronic properties, e.g. composition-dependent VOC, reduced VOC loss, improved FF, etc., have been generally observed in alloyed ternary OPVs.38–41 Considering the record-high performance, the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 ternary blend stands as a good representative that delivers all the merits and the classic optoelectronic properties of alloyed ternary OPVs. Based on this system, the working principle of the alloyed ternary OPVs and the mechanism underlying their interesting optoelectronic properties, e.g., composition-dependent VOC, optoelectronic properties, carrier dynamics and carrier mobility are comprehensively studied and unveiled in the following sections.
Composition-dependent VOC
From the above analysis, composition-dependent VOC is the key for the enhanced device performance. In view of photovoltaic device physics, VOC is mainly determined by two factors, i.e., the band gap and charge recombination, conforming to the following equation: VOC = EPVg/q − Vloss = EPVg/q − (ΔV1 + ΔV2 + ΔV3)(1)where q is the elementary charge and EPVg is the bandgap of photovoltaic devices, as derived from the EQE spectra via the method proposed by Rau.42 ΔV1 is mainly due to the black-body radiation recombination above the band gap, which is inevitable; ΔV2 is caused by radiative recombination below the band gap; and ΔV3 is attributed to non-radiative recombination, which is the major limitation on VOC of OPV. ΔV3 can be further quantified by EQEELvia the mathematical formula: (2)
Therefore, in the following, the composition-dependent VOC in the ternary OPV is interpreted in view of the variation of band gap and charge recombination variations with different compositions. First, the origin of the gradually enlarged photovoltaic band gap with increasing third component is examined. Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of the ternary blends with different BTP-S2 contents. In the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 film, the donor and acceptor show distinct absorption peaks, and the addition of BTP-S2 seems to slightly affect the absorbing feature of PBDB-TF, but dramatically blue-shifts the absorption of BTP-eC9. These results demonstrate that BTP-S2 selectively interacts with BTP-eC9 by forming a molecular alloy, but renders the PBDB-TF phase largely intact, as illustrated in Fig. 1a (right), where BTP-S2 is selectively distributed in the BTP-eC9 phase to form the intermixed acceptor (-rich) phase. The intermixed acceptor (-rich) phase then forms an intimate interfacial contact with the PBDB-TF donor(-rich) phase, and thus, two D:A interfaces are formed, i.e. PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9. The band tail absorbing feature of the ternary blend film is gradually blue-shifted, and this accounts for the enlarged photovoltaic band gap of the ternary OPV. These results suggest that the interaction between BTP-eC9 and BTP-S2 is the key to the band gap variation.

(f) Composition-dependent VOC loss (derived from ΔV1, ΔV2, and ΔV3, presented in Table S1, ESI†), Eg, calculated VOC and measured VOC. 
To disentangle the effect of PBDB-TF, we studied the optoelectronic properties of BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 blend films as shown in Fig. 2b. As expected, the blend films exhibit gradual blue-shifting with increasing BTP-S2 content. To exclude the possible influence of mechanical “dilution” on absorption band tails with reduced BTP-eC9 content, we manually constructed the absorption spectra of the blend film by simply superposing the absorption of pristine BTP-eC9 and BTP-S2 with different ratios (termed “reconstructed” spectra), and compared them with the experimental results. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), it is clear that the absorption band tail becomes quite different, and the absorption spectra from experiments uniformly exhibit blue-shifting compared to these reconstructed results, validating the blue-shifting in absorption spectra. This will be unambiguously confirmed from transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) in the carrier dynamics section below. Furthermore, normalized PL spectra of BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 blend films are also measured and shown in Fig. 2c, which show a significant difference compared to the “reconstructed” spectra as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), and these results exclude the possibility of simple physical superposition induced band gap variation. The whole set of phenomena can also be observed when replacing IT-4F (Fig. S8 and S10, ESI†), suggesting the generality of the above observations.
Next, we turned our attention to the charge recombination properties of ternary OPVs. Considering that there are two D/A interfaces in the ternary blend, i.e. PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 and PBDB-TF:BTP-S2, the charge recombination center is first identified by comparing the EL spectra of ternary blends with different BTP-S2 contents, as shown in Fig. 2d. The experimental results show distinct differences compared to the constructed EL spectra (Fig. S8, ESI†), and there is almost no emission trace at the PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 interface as shown in Fig. 2d. These results suggest that PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 is the dominant interface rather than PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 for charge recombination, possibly due to the lower CT energy of the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 interface. This conclusion is further confirmed with the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:IT-4F ternary OPVs, where their EL shapes show significant difference compared to those of PBDB-TF:IT-4F binary OPVs, but are very close to those of PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 (Fig. S8, ESI†).
Furthermore, the VOC losses, caused by different charge recombination processes including the inevitable charge recombination from the black-body radiation or the S–Q limit (ΔV1), non-ideal radiative charge recombination due to non-step absorbing tails (ΔV2), and non-radiative charge recombination (ΔV3), are analyzed by the method developed in previous studies.43,44 Considering that the emission centers (or emissive species) are different for PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BPT-S2 systems, it is not reasonable to make a comparison between them. Instead, it would be more reasonable to compare PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BPT-S2 for the mechanism study. Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows the FTPS-EQE and EL/black body radiation (BB) according to the reciprocity relation, and the good overlap between them validates the interpretation of using FTPS spectra for analyzing the charge recombination properties. As shown in Fig. 2e, with different BTP-S2 contents, ΔV1 exhibits a slight difference due to the similar band gaps (from 0.262 to 0.271 V). From highly sensitive FTPS-EQE shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), ΔV2 is calculated to be 0.042 and 0.044 V for PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BTP-S2, respectively, and these results suggest a very small difference in ΔV2 when blending BTP-S2 into PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 OPVs, which is in the same trend with Urbach energy analysis as shown in Fig. S9b (ESI†). We find that the EQEEL of the ternary blend exhibits an increasing trend when blended with BTP-S2, corresponding to a decreasing trend of ΔV3 in ternary OPVs with increasing BTP-S2 content, as shown in Fig. 2e. Considering that PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 is the charge recombination center in the ternary blend, it is interesting to find that ΔV3 of ternary OPVs decreases with increasing BTP-S2 content. On the other hand, IT-4F does not seem effective in suppressing the non-radiative loss, possibly due to the intrinsically high non-radiative decay in the PBDB-TF:IT-4F film, which can be attributed to the formation of a lower energy CT state compared to the singlet state. Comparison between BTP-S2 and IT-4F as the third component suggests the importance of using a high luminescence system to reduce the VOC loss for high device performance. Fig. 2f summarizes the different trends of VOC, EPVg and VOC loss from the three different channels above. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that the calculated composition-dependent VOC (VOC = EPVg/q − (ΔV1 + ΔV2 + ΔV3)) can well reproduce the experimental values, unveiling that the composition-dependent Eg and charge recombination properties are the key mechanism underlying the composition-dependent VOC in a ternary blend.
Charge mobility
Besides the composition-dependent VOC, it is interesting to observe that FF exhibits little variation with a large volume of the third component. Therefore, the charge transport behaviors in the blend films are studied based on the SCLC model (see ESI†).45 Considering that the third component tends to selectively interact with the acceptor, i.e. BTP-eC9, we studied the carrier mobility of the A:A blend with electron-only device configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN–Br/Ag. As shown in Fig. 3a, the electron mobility of neat BTP-eC9 and BTP-S2 films is 1.2 × 10−4 and 0.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The blend films consisting of the BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 mixture furthermore exhibit improved electron mobility almost along the whole blending ratios, with a maximum electron mobility of 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 25% BTP-S2 content. Notably, the high carrier mobility is favorable for high photo-current collection efficiency, and contributes to high FF. By studying the effective bias (Veff = Vbi − Vbias) dependent Jph (as shown in Fig. 3b), we found that the ternary device can achieve 90% charge extraction with the smallest voltage of 0.21 V, while it increases to 0.56 and 0.34 V for PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 binary devices, respectively.

Carrier dynamics
The elimination of BTP-S2 emission in the BTP-S2:BTP-eC9 blend suggests the Förster energy transfer from BTP-S2 to BTP-eC9, considering their strong PL and absorption overlap, as shown in Fig. 3c. A rough estimation on the Förster energy transfer efficiency based on the PL lifetime of BTP-S2 in pristine and blend films (Fig. S11, ESI†) indicates a very high efficiency of up to 77.3%.46 This conclusion is further stressed in the BTP-eC9:IT-4F blend as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†) and by the transient PL spectrum of the BTP-S2 component in the BTP-S2:BTP-eC9 blend film, where the PL decay of the BTP-S2 component has been significantly reduced compared to that of pristine films (Fig. S11, ESI†).
Besides the exciton process, the charge dynamics within the active layers are studied via transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). The GSB signal attributions are illustrated in Fig. S12 (ESI†), where the TA spectra of pristine PBDB-TF, BTP-eC9, BTP-S2 and IT-4F films are presented. Fig. 3d and e show the 2D color plots of TA spectra of PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 after photoexcitation with a 750 nm laser. When the acceptors are selectively excited, the PBDB-TF GSB signal appears, suggesting the hole transfer process from photoexcited acceptors to PBDB-TF. Interestingly, it is observed that the rising time of PBDB-TF GSB signal in a ternary blend becomes faster compared to that of the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 binary blend, demonstrating the improved hole transfer with the addition of BTP-S2. By comparing the TAS spectra of a ternary blend with a binary PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 blend film (Fig. S13, ESI†), the charge transfer seems to be associated with the fast charge transfer between the PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 interfaces. To quantify the charge transfer process in blend films, the kinetics of 612, 604 and 606 nm were chosen to represent PBDB-TF GSB kinetics for PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9, PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:IT-4F and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 films, respectively, because the acceptor or acceptor:acceptor blend films show no signal at these wavelengths after 750 nm photoexcitation (Fig. S13, ESI†). Fig. 3f and Table S3 (ESI†) display the rising kinetics of PBDB-TF GSB in binary and ternary films, directly reflecting the hole transfer process with a biexponential function: i = a1exp(−t/τ1) + a2exp(−t/τ2). As demonstrated in previous reports,47–49a1 is related to the proportion of the ultrafast hole transfer process at the interface characterized by τ1, while a2 is attributed to a diffusion mediated process controlled by a pure domain and characterized by τ2. Clearly, the ternary blends show a higher proportion of the fast process, especially in PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 (a1 = 56.8%), which is larger than that of PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 (a1 = 51.6%), quantifying the higher hole transfer rate in ternary films compared to the binary blend. By comparing the GSB decay in pristine and blend BTP-eC9 films (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†), a charge transfer efficiency of 90.3%, 92.4% and 92.4% has been derived for PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9, PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BTP-S2, and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:IT-4F, respectively (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†).50–53
Also, a pump laser of 925 nm was used to only excite BTP-eC9 in the BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 and BTP-eC9:IT-4F blends. Interestingly we find a significantly enhanced GSB signal at a shorter wavelength (650–750 nm) shown in Fig. S14a–c (ESI†). The appearance of the GSB signal at a shorter wavelength corresponding to BTP-S2/IT-4F (Fig. S14g, ESI†) can be probably attributed to the charge transfer from BTP-eC9 to BTP-S2/IT-4F. In addition, compared to the excited state absorption (ESA) signal at 550–600 nm of pure BTP-eC9, the ESA signal is significantly quenched when blended with 25% BTP-S2 or IT-4F (Fig. S14h, ESI†), also identifying the charge transfer process from BTP-eC9 to BTP-S2 or IT-4F. Besides, considering the higher LUMO of BTP-S2 compared to that of BTP-eC9, it is also expected that a charge transfer from BTP-eC9 to BTP-S2 might occur. Moreover, it is observed that the GSB peak of BTP-eC9 gets blue-shifted with the addition of 25% BTP-S2 or IT-4F (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†), and this unambiguously confirms the blue-shifted absorption spectra or enlarged band gap. A schematic diagram to illustrate the possible charge transfer process has been shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), where the energy levels are estimated from the CV measurement and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S1, ESI†). However, more work is required to get a clearer and more reliable picture of the detailed carrier dynamics.
Morphology
To evaluate the molecular packing in the ternary blends, the grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)54 characterization was performed and the scattering patterns, as well as line profiles are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S16 (ESI†). The neat BTP-eC9, IT-4F, and BTP-S2 films all exhibit a face-on dominated orientation with prominent π–π scattering along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction. The in-plane (IP) scattering peak at ∼0.30 Å−1 belonging to BTP-S2 almost disappears in the BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 film, suggesting the well-mixed feature between BTP-eC9 and BTP-S2. Meanwhile, the full width at half maximum of the peak at ∼0.40 Å−1 along the IP direction is decreased in the BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 blend with respect to the two neat films, which indicates an increased coherence length of lamellar packing. However, for the BTP-eC9:IT-4F blend, the coherence length of the lamellar and π–π packing remains unchanged, indicating the limited effect of IT-4F on improving the BTP-eC9 molecular packing. In addition, the PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 film exhibits multiple scattering peaks in the whole detected region, but the PBDB-TF:IT-4F film shows a single peak at ∼0.30 Å−1. Nevertheless, both PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 and PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9:IT-4F ternary blends exhibit scattering features similar to those of the PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 film, rather than those of the binary blends of PBDB-TF:BTP-S2 and PBDB-TF:IT-4F. This further confirms the well-mixed features of the acceptors on the molecular level and offers the structural foundation for efficient carrier transport and optoelectronic property variations.
 Fig. 4  Molecular packing unveiled with GIWAXS. (a) Line curves along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions and (b) 2D scattering patterns of pristine, A:A blend, binary D:A blend and ternary D:A:A blend films. 
From the height map in the AFM characterization (Fig. S17, ESI†), it is found that after the third component is added, the roughness of the ternary system is nearly unchanged compared to that of the binary counterpart, and a similar trend occurs on the phase map. We conclude that the introduction of an extra component, either IT-4F or BTP-S2, can hardly disturb the morphology of the PBDB-TF:BTP-S9 host system, in agreement with the GIWAXS results. This would maintain sufficient exciton dissociation and charge generation and finally lead to better performance of the ternary OPVs than the binary devices. Interestingly, BTP-S2 based ternary blend solar cells exhibit decent stability when stored in a glove box, and show a little bit higher stability under the maximum power output tracking test in ambient air (Fig. S18, ESI†), suggesting that the morphology of the ternary blend is more thermodynamically stable.
MD simulations
Furthermore, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to shed light on the working mechanism of MC-OPVs, e.g., the enlarged Eg, reduced non-radiative decay, and improved carrier mobility at the molecular level. The MD simulation details are provided in the ESI.† According to the simulated molecular packing structures in Fig. 5a–c, BTP-S2 tends to form a homogenous thin-film with BTP-eC9, confirming the molecular intermixing of BTP-eC9 and BTP-S2, as illustrated in Fig. 1a (right). To make it clear, we have replotted the MD results by representing each molecule with different small balls to allow a direct observation of molecular distribution in space, as shown in Fig. S19a (ESI†). It is clear that both BTP-S2 and BTP-eC9 are randomly and evenly distributed in space, verifying a good intermixing between BTP-S2 and BTP-eC9 at the molecular level, and no aggregation occurs in the BTP-S2:BTP-eC9 blend. Based on the well-intermixed morphology, the composition-dependent Eg of the blend films can be probably attributed to the changes in polarization effect and/or the suppression of dimer formation.31,55,56

The radial distribution functions (RDFs) in Fig. 5d suggest that the pristine films of BTP-eC9 and BTP-S2 exhibit considerable π–π stacking between the end-groups of 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile (IC), as confirmed with GIWAXS measurement. The simulated IC–IC distance is 0.37 nm, which is the same as that derived from the GIWAXS patterns (0.37 nm, shown in Table S6, ESI†), and this validates the results of MD simulations. Interestingly, in the BTP-eC9:BTP-S2 intermixed blend, the RDF peak for the terminal IC–IC interaction gets significantly strengthened. That is, blending BTP-S2 in BTP-eC9 can enable more IC–IC stacking, which is in good agreement with the GIWAXS results in Fig. 4. Moreover, the π–π stacking in the blend is dominated by the hetero-molecular interaction between BTP-eC9 and BTP-S2, where the preferred π–π stacking distance is similar to that of the homo-molecular terminal IC–IC interaction. The well intermixed molecular interactions determine that no independent BTP-S2 or BTP-eC9 percolation path is likely to form, and the charge transport in the blend film will mostly rely on the charge transfer at the hetero-molecular interface between BTP-eC9 and BTP-S2. Finally, it is worth noting that the number of molecules in the largest connection network is appreciably enhanced upon the introduction of 25 wt% BTP-S2 in BTP-eC9 (Fig. S19b, ESI†), which is beneficial to the formation of a robust percolation network and facilitate charge transport. Therefore, the enhanced IC–IC end-group interactions in the intermixed blends will contribute to the improvement of electron mobility. Besides, the enhancement of intermolecular interactions might induce weaker electron–vibration couplings and hence reduce the non-radiative decay.57–60
Conclusions
In summary, we have comprehensively studied the working principle of alloyed ternary OPVs, and unveiled the mechanisms underlying the generally observed interesting optoelectronic properties from molecule to device. Based on the representative PBDB-TF:BTP-eC9 system, a ternary blend is constructed by adding BTP-S2 or IT-4F with different concentrations. A blue-shift is generally observed, possibly due to the changes of polarization environments in the molecular intermixing structures or suppression of dimer formation as unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and morphology characterization. Moreover, the charge recombination, particularly the non-radiative decay, is suppressed, possibly due to the enhanced intermolecular interactions, and this further leads to a reduction of VOC loss by ∼10 meV. Furthermore, despite increased disorder, the carrier mobility is retained or even slightly improved probably due to the enhancement of terminal IC–IC interactions in the blends. These synergistic effects eventually contribute to a certified PCE of 18.3%, which is among the highest values in OPVs.
In addition, we tentatively summarize the materials selection rules for multi-component OPVs, which include: (1) good miscibility to form intermixing at the molecular level; (2) a suitable packing moiety to form strong intermolecular interactions at the hetero-molecular interface; and (3) higher VOC when pairing with either the donor or acceptor in the original D:A system to form a new system, compared to the original D:A system. It seems that materials/systems with a larger band gap (or CT energy) and higher luminescence properties can well fulfill the 3rd criterion, which further requires suitable energy levels, e.g. when trying to blend an acceptor as the third component in the D:A blend, the third component should have a moderately higher LUMO level with the acceptor (of the original system) and a low HOMO offset with the donor (of the original system).

Broader context
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted great interest due to their advantages of low cost, light-weight, flexibility, transparency, etc. However, the disadvantage of relatively low efficiency needs to be overcome for further commercialization of OPVs. A multi-component (MC) strategy has been demonstrated to be effective to further improve the device performance over binary systems. However, the community of OPVs lacks the fundamental understanding on the working mechanism of a MC device. Particularly, previous models, i.e. charge transfer, energy transfer, parallel, and alloyed orbital models can hardly interpret the interesting optoelectronic phenomena associated with MC-OPVs, e.g. composition dependent open-circuit voltage (VOC), reduced non-radiative charge recombination, and improved charge transport. By viewing MC-OPVs from a novel perspective, this work provides a comprehensive understanding on the working mechanism of MC-OPVs from the molecule to device level. For the first time, the composition dependent VOC is interpreted from photovoltaic device physics, that is, the composition dependent bandgap and charge recombination properties, which get enlarged and suppressed, respectively. By molecular dynamics simulations, these are further unveiled to be tightly associated with the well intermixed and enhanced inter-molecular interactions, which also contributes to the improved charge transport. Finally, a certified PCE of 18.3%, ranking among the highest values in OPVs, has been demonstrated.
