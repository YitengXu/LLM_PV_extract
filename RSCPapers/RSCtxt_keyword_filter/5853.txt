    , Accepted 18th July 2017First published on 19th July 2017AbstractA series of D–A copolymers (P1–P3) based on a thiophene fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) unit and a 4,8-bis(4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTFT) unit have been designed and synthesized as electron-donating materials for non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) with ITIC as an electron-accepting material. The fusion of a thiophene ring with a BTAZ unit and introduction of a fluorine atom at the BDTT unit have been concurrently performed to regulate the absorption properties and energy levels, and two different alkyl side-chains have also been introduced to BTAZT and BDTFT units, respectively, to investigate the influence of side-chains on the properties of the polymers as well as the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs. The photovoltaic performance evaluation in combination with morphology characterization indicates that the introduction of a 2-ethylhexyl group simultaneously at BTAZT and BDTFT units is favourable for intermolecular π–π interaction that improves the morphologies and crystalline domain of P1:ITIC blend film, thus enhancing the charge mobility and the short-circuit current density (Jsc). But the large steric hindrance of the 2-butyloctyl group to replace the 2-ethylhexyl group at BDTFT (P2) or BTAZT (P3) deteriorates intermolecular interaction that leads to the decrease of charge mobility and poor Jsc. Thus, P1 based PSCs exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.14% with the best Jsc (14.11 ± 0.27 mA cm−2) and fill factor (63.41 ± 1.46%) among P1–P3 polymers.
Introduction
The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) that blended an electron-donating material with an electron-accepting material have attracted tremendous interest over the past few decades.1–4 The electron-accepting materials based on fullerene units such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) have been drawing much attention due to the high electron mobility and 3D electron transferring and transporting capability, which endowed the PSCs with an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10–11%.5–10 However, the fullerene electron-accepting materials have some drawbacks such as poor tenability of absorption, weak absorption for visible light, poor solubility and high production cost.11,12 Thus, non-fullerene organic electron-accepting materials have achieved rapid development in recent years due to the ease of structural modification and synthesis, good solubility, and perfect absorption complementary to the electron-donating material in the visible and near infrared regions.13–19 Recently, some high-performance fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs)20–28 have been developed by zhan's group, and several single-junction BHJ-PSCs exhibit very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 12% that has surpassed the fullerene based PSCs.17–19
At the same time, designing new electron-donating materials to match with non-fullerene electron-accepting materials in absorption and energy levels is also very important for high performance non-fullerene PSCs. As known, benzotriazole (BTAZ) as an electron acceptor has been widely used to build donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers for PSCs with excellent photovoltaic performances.29–32 However, due to its moderate electron-withdrawing ability, some BTAZ-based D–A conjugated copolymers only show a relatively narrow absorption range with a medium optical band gap. Recently, our group had developed a synthetic approach to fuse a thiophene ring with classic acceptors including benzotriazole (BTAZ)33 and benzothiadiazole (BT)34 to construct D–A conjugated copolymers, which has been proven to be an effective strategy to extend the absorption region and modulate the energy levels through stabilizing the quinoid structure of the conjugation backbone and strengthening the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).35,36 Also, the introduction of a strong electronegativity fluorine atom to the conjugated backbone is another effective strategy to regulate the HOMO–LUMO energy levels and strengthen the molecular coplanarity through intramolecular noncovalent interactions such as F⋯H and S⋯F. For example, Hou and coworkers37,38 introduced a fluorine atom at the β-position of the thiophene ring in the 4,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) unit to develop a new donor (4,8-bis(4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, BDTFT) and then constructed several BDTFT-based D–A copolymers, which showed deeper HOMO and LUMO levels thus to greatly enhance the open circuit voltage (Voc) and improve photovoltaic performances with very high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).
In this work, we developed a new simple route to synthesize the thiophene-fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) unit, and then selected it as an acceptor to build a kind of new D–A copolymer with a BDTFT donor (Fig. 1). We wish that the fusion of the thiophene ring with a BTAZ unit and introduction of a fluorine atom at a BDTT unit can co-regulate the absorption properties and HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the D–A conjugation backbone to improve their photovoltaic performance, and also wish to introduce different alkyl groups at BTAZT and BDTFT units, respectively, to explore the influence of side chains on the photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as the photovoltaic performance of PSCs through modifying the interchain interaction and aggregation morphologies. Herein, we present the synthesis of a BTAZT unit and a series of corresponding D–A copolymers containing 2-ethylhexyl and 2-butyloctyl groups at BTAZT and BDTFT units, and investigate the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the polymers. And then, the solar cell devices with polymers as electron-donating materials and ITIC (3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-teterakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indanone[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene) (Fig. 1) as the electron-accepting material have been fabricated and their corresponding photovoltaic performances have been assessed in detail.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As reported in our previous work,33 we had developed a synthetic route for the BTAZT unit. However, that synthetic route and the procedures were too lengthy and tedious. In addition, the purification for some intermediates was not easy that resulted in low yield. In order to simplify the synthetic procedure and increase the synthetic efficiency, we have designed another new synthetic route for the BTAZT unit and the corresponding monomer as shown in Scheme 1. In this route, 2,4-difluorobenzaldehyde was selected as a starting material and then its nitration yielded 2,4-difluoro-5-nitrobenzaldehyde (1). Owing to two strong electron-withdrawing groups (formacryl and nitryl groups) located at the ortho- and para-positions of a fluorine atom, its nucleophilic substitution with aqueous ammonia easily occurred to selectively produce 4-amino-2-fluoro-5-nitrobenzaldehyde (2).39 Afterwards, the fusion of a thiophene ring with a benzene group was easily performed to yield thiophene-fused benzene derivative (3) by the reaction of 2 with 2-ethylhexyl 2-mercaptoacetate. Lately, the reduction of the nitryl group in 3 by SnCl2 gave 4 that was not isolated to carry out the next-step reaction due to its vulnerable oxidation. The thiophene fused benzotriazole (BTAZT) unit with different alkyl groups at nitrogen (6) was obtained by the oxidation and cyclization of a thiophene fused benzene-1,2-diamine derivative (4) with NaNO2 and then by the alkylation of 5 according to the literature.40,41 After hydrolysis and then esterification with different long-chain alkyl alcohols, a BTAZT unit containing the same or different alkyl groups (8) at triazole and thiophene groups was obtained. The final monomers (M1 and M2) were obtained according to a procedure previously reported by our group.33 The detailed procedures were shown in the ESI† and all the compounds were characterized by NMR, MS and elemental analysis.

Scheme 2 shows the synthetic route for copolymers (P1–P3) based on BTAZT and BDTFT units, which were synthesized via Stille coupling reaction of M1 or M2 with M3 or M4, respectively, and the detailed procedure is described in the ESI.† All the polymers have good solubility in some common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene and THF. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was applied to determine the number average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity of index (PDI). The corresponding data are listed in Table 1. The thermal stability of the polymers was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). They showed much high thermal stability with 5% weight loss beyond 350 °C (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of P1–P3 in diluted chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. As can be seen, there are two main absorption bands observed in 300–400 nm and 500–750 nm, respectively. The absorption band in the 300–400 nm region can be assigned to the π–π* electron transition of the localized conjugated backbone. Another strong and broad absorption band occurring above 500 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient is contributed to the strong ICT, which is more red-shifted than that of the analogues based on the BTAZ unit,42 since the fusion of the thiophene ring with a BTAZ unit stabilizes the quinoid structure of the conjugation backbone and strengthens the ICT.33
 Fig. 2  The absorption spectra of polymers in chloroform. 
Although these three polymers (P1–P3) have the same conjugation backbone, they still show some difference for their maximum absorption (λmax). Compared with P2 (λmax = 580 nm) and P3 (λmax = 572 nm), an obvious red-shifted absorption maximum (λmax = 604 nm) is observed for P1. This phenomenon should be related to the different alkyl side chains at the conjugation backbone. As shown in Fig. 1, P1 has two same 2-ethylhexyl groups locating at BTAZT and BDTFT units, but one 2-ethylhexyl group is replaced by another bulky 2-butyloctyl group at the BDTFT unit in P2 and at the BTAZT unit in P3, respectively. Apparently, the 2-ethylhexyl group has less steric hindrance than the 2-butyloctyl group, so P1 has a more regular structure and less steric hindrance for interchain interaction than P2 and P3. This indicates that P1 is more likely to aggregate, thus exhibiting a more red-shifted absorption than P2 and P3 in solution. In addition, the bulky 2-butyloctyl group locating at the BTAZT unit with a coplanar structure seems to exert a larger steric hindrance effect on the interchain interaction than that at the BDTFT unit with a twisted structure, so the absorption of P3 shows a little blue-shifted absorption compared with P2.

Fig. 3 presents the absorption spectra of P1–P3 in the thin film state. Different from the solution, these polymers show obviously red-shifted absorption of about 30–40 nm in the solid state. Moreover, all of them exhibit almost the same absorption spectra in the film state, implying that a strong interchain interaction exists in the film state of P1–P3. Based on the absorption onset edge in the thin film, their optical band gaps are estimated to be about 1.69 eV, which is a little wider than that of a similar analogous polymer based on the BTAZT unit and the BDTT unit.33
 Fig. 3  The absorption spectra of polymers in thin films. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to evaluate the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the polymers. Fig. 4 shows the CV curves of P1–P3, and the corresponding electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, the HOMO energy level of P1–P3 is estimated to be −5.39 eV, −5.49 eV and −5.47 eV, respectively, from their onset oxidative potentials. The corresponding LUMO energy levels are obtained from the difference between the HOMO energy level and the optical band gap (shown in Table 2). Compared with the polymer containing the same conjugation backbone,33 the introduction of an F atom at the β-position of the thiophene ring of a BDTT unit effectively reduces the HOMO energy level. At the same time, the presence of a large branched alkyl chain at the BTAZ unit (P2) or the BDTT unit (P3) seems to lead to a deeper HOMO energy level, which stems from the large steric hindrance that is caused by bulky alkyl side chains to increase the torsion extent of the conjugated backbone, thus impeding π-electron delocalization. This phenomenon is much similar to that reported by Sun et al.43 Generally, the lower HOMO energy level is favourable for the enhancement of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs.

Photovoltaic properties
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated from P1–P3 as electron-donating materials (p-type semiconducting materials) and ITIC as the electron-accepting material (n-type semiconducting material) with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/Ca/Al, where the active layer was spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solution with different p/n weight ratios. Firstly, P1 was chosen as an example to optimize the p/n weight ratio as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the optimal p/n ratio was about 1:1 for it. Thus, the p/n ratio of 1:1 was applied to fabricate the PSC devices for all three polymers so as to compare the results under the same conditions. In order to further improve the photovoltaic performances, some additives were added to try to modify the morphologies of the active layer. It was found that the addition of 1% diphenyl ether (DPE) can improve the photovoltaic performances. Fig. 5 shows the relevant current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the polymer solar cells with a p/n ratio of 1:1 and 1% DPE and the corresponding photovoltaic performances are listed in Table 3. As can be seen, without a DPE additive, the best PCE of 6.33% (with Jsc = 12.44 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V and FF = 62.99%) was obtained for the P1 based device, but P2 and P3 based devices only give a best PCE of 4.09% (with Jsc = 8.75 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.83 V and FF = 56.14%) and 2.51% (with Jsc = 5.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.83 V and FF = 53.92%), respectively (see Fig. S3 and Table S3, ESI†). After adding 1% DPE additive, the Jsc and FF of the P1 based device is increased to be about 14.01 mA cm−2 and 64.58% with the best PCE of 7.14%, indicating that the additive has effectively modified the morphologies of the active layer to improve the Jsc and FF. Compared with P1, P2 and P3 based devices show poorer Jsc and FF. Even after adding the DPE additive, P2 and P3 based devices only show the best PCE of 4.17% (with Jsc = 9.34 ± 0.17 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 ± 0.008 V and FF = 52.92 ± 1.22%) and 3.66% (with Jsc = 7.58 ± 0.13 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.83 ± 0.008 V and FF = 56.85 ± 2.04%), respectively. Obviously, the P1 based device exhibits a much higher Jsc and FF than P2 and P3 based devices among these three polymers. This implies that the introduction of different alkyl side chains at the same conjugation backbone has a significant influence on the photovoltaic performances for this class of D–A copolymers based on BTAZT and BDTFT units.

As shown in Fig. 1, P1–P3 polymers have the same D–A conjugation skeleton, but the two alkyl side chains locating at BTAZT and BDTFT units are not identical. P1 has two same 2-ethylhexyl groups, but one 2-ethylhexyl group is replaced by a bulky 2-butyloctyl group at the BDTFT unit for P2 and at the BTAZT unit for P3. Because the 2-butyloctyl group has a larger steric hindrance effect than the 2-ethylhexyl group, the presence of the 2-butyloctyl group at the backbone is unfavourable for the well-ordered intermolecular stacking. Thus, the Jsc of P2 and P3 based PSC devices is much smaller than that of P1. It is worth noting that the PSC devices based on P2 and P3 show higher Voc than the P1 based device, which is also coming from a bulky 2-butyloctyl group that further reduces the HOMO energy level.

Fig. 6 shows the incident-photon-to-converted-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs based on P1–P3 devices with 1% DPE additive. The IPCE spectra of all the PSCs display a broad photoresponse from 300 to 800 nm. In particular, for the P1 based device, the IPCE exceeds 60% from 550 nm to 720 nm with a peak over 64% at around 660 nm. However, the maximum IPCE of 45% for the P2 based device and of 38% for the P3 based device are much lower than that of the P1 based device. These results are in good agreement with those values obtained from the J–V curves, in which the P1 based device exhibits the highest Jsc among P1–P3 based devices.

In order to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge transfer behaviour in the polymer (P1–P3):ITIC blend films, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were carried out. Fig. 7 shows the PL spectra of pure polymers P1–P3 (excited at 600 nm) and ITIC (excited at 700 nm) films as well as the polymer:ITIC blend films (1:1, w/w) (excited at 600 and 700 nm, respectively). As shown in Fig. 7a–c, when excited at a wavelength of 600 nm, the pure polymers, P1–P3, show similar broad PL emission bands in the range of 650–900 nm, but the emission are significantly quenched by about 88% for the corresponding polymer:ITIC blend films, indicating that electron transfer from the polymer to ITIC can efficiently occur. However, when excited at a wavelength of 700 nm, the PL emission intensity of pure ITIC is about 89%, 82% and 59% quenched in P1–P3:ITIC blend films, respectively (Fig. 7d–f). This suggests that the efficiency of hole transfer from ITIC to P1 is much better than that from ITIC to P2 or P3, and especially, the hole transfer efficiency from ITIC to P3 is much poor. The above results imply that the efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge transfer for polymer:ITIC blend films is in the order of P1 > P2 > P3, which is in good agreement with the experimental values of Jsc obtained from the corresponding polymer based devices (Table 3).
 Fig. 7  Photoluminescence spectra of polymers P1–P3 (excited at 600 nm) and ITIC (excited at 700 nm) films as well as the polymer:ITIC blend films of (1:1, w/w) (excited at 600 and 700 nm). 
To further understand the structural factors that impact the Jsc and FF of the PSCs, the hole and electron mobilities of the blend films were evaluated using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4, ESI†). The hole and electron mobilities of these polymers are summarized in Table 3. Compared to P2 and P3, the P1:ITIC blend film possesses a higher hole mobility (μh = 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron mobility (μe = 4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) as well as a more balanced ratio of hole mobility to electron mobility (μh/μe = 3.78). The higher and more balanced hole and electron-mobility also helps to explain the high Jsc and FF for P1:ITIC devices.
Morphologies and microstructures of polymer:ITIC blend films
The morphologies of polymer:ITIC blend active layer films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 8a–c, the blend films exhibit a rather different surface morphologies with the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 6.1 nm for P1:ITIC, 3.84 nm for P2:ITIC and 1.36 nm for P3:ITIC, respectively. The relatively higher RMS surface roughness of the P1:ITIC blend film indicates the increase of contact area between the active layer and the interfacial electrode, thus enhancing charge collection.44 The phase images also shows that the P1:ITIC blend film has more obvious phase separation and bigger crystalline domain size than P2 or P3:ITIC blend films (Fig. 8d–f). Moreover, bigger polymer crystallinity and pronounced aggregation domains are also confirmed by TEM images. As shown in Fig. 8a, the P1:ITIC blend film exhibits continuous nanofiber-like network phase separation and big domain size, which has not been observed in P2 or P3:ITIC blend films (Fig. 8h and i). The more nanofiber-like network phase separation with bigger domain size should be responsible for more efficient charge separation and transportation.45,46 Thus, P1 based PSCs show the best Jsc and highest PCE among the P1–P3 based PSCs.

Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements47 were carried out to characterize the molecular packing information of the polymer:ITIC blend films and to further understand the influence of different alkyl side chains at the conjugation backbone on the inter-chain packing in the active layer. Fig. 9 shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns, and in-plane and out-of-plane intensity integrals of GIWAXS patterns for P1–P3 polymer:ITIC blend films. For the P1:ITIC blend film, a strong and sharp ring-like scattering peak (q ≈ 0.30 Å−1, d-spacing ≈ 20.9 Å), which corresponds to the lamellar stacking of P1, was observed to be slightly concentrated along both qz (out-of-plane) and qxy (in-plane) directions, suggesting the coexistence of edge-on and face-on oriented P1 semi-crystalline domains. Another scattering peak was observed along the qz direction, corresponding to a stronger face-on oriented π–π stacking which is favourable for hole transport. For the P2:ITIC blend film, the lamellar peak of P2 was observed at the same position, however, weaker and even more concentrated along the qz orientation, suggesting lower crystallinity and more population of edge-on oriented domains consistent with the observed lower hole mobility. The scattering peak observed at qz ≈ 0.30 Å−1 implies the formation of ITIC semi-crystalline domains. For the P3:ITIC blend film, all the peaks appeared very weak and broad, showing the lowest crystallinity among the three films in agreement with the observed lowest mobility.

Conclusions
In this work, a series of new medium band-gap D–A copolymers based on BTAZT and BDTFT units with different alkyl side chains have been designed and synthesized as electron-donating materials for non-fullerene PSCs with ITIC as an electron-accepting material. The absorption properties and energy levels for the D–A conjugation backbone have been regulated by the fusion of thiophene with a BTAZ unit and the introduction of an F atom at the BDTT unit. Moreover, the introduction of a shorter branched alkyl group with a less steric effect at BTAZT and BDTFT units is favourable for strengthening the intermolecular π–π interaction and improving the morphologies and crystalline domain of the polymer:ITIC blend film, thus enhancing the charge mobility and transfer properties. As a consequence, the P1 based PSCs exhibit the best PCE of 7.14% with highest Jsc and FF values among P1–P3 polymers. These results imply that BTAZT based polymers through the rational structural design of the conjugation skeleton and modification of alkyl side chains will be promising electron-donating materials to be applied in non-fullerene PSCs.
