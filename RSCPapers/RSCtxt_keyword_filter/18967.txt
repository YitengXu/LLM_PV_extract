    , Accepted 24th September 2018First published on 11th October 2018AbstractDespite the impressive photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond 22%, intensive studies are still required to overcome ongoing issues such as cost, stability, and hysteresis. Here, for the first time, we report a cesium-containing triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cell (n–i–p structure) by using hydrothermally synthesized inorganic CuCrO2 (CCO) delafossite nanoparticles as a hole transporting material (HTM). After optimization of the concentration, a fully homogeneous and completely covered CCO layer that facilitates fast carrier extraction and collection was obtained on the surface of the perovskite. Our CCO-based cells achieved the best PCE of 16.7% (average 16.04 ± 0.40) with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, it was found that our cells showed a significant improvement in stability in ambient air compared with Spiro-OMeTAD HTM-based cells. After 60 days of storage in air without encapsulation, PCE remained at ∼83% of the initial value with the CCO-based cells, whereas it decreased to ∼24% of the initial value with devices based on the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM. Furthermore, cost estimation results indicated that the current prospect of CCO has an affordable cost/device ratio (∼180-fold cheaper than Spiro-OMeTAD). This work not only reveals the importance of air-stable inorganic HTMs, but also provides a low-cost HTM for highly efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn great attention over the past decade owing to their promising efficiency.1–7 There is no doubt that organic small molecules and polymeric materials such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) play a vital role in high efficiency of PSCs as hole transporting materials (HTMs). Nevertheless, they suffer from a number of obstacles such as complex synthetic approaches and crucial purification processes. This is one of the key challenges in the commercialization of PSCs. Secondly, both Spiro-OMeTAD (∼€ 365 per gram) and PTAA (∼€ 2275 per gram) are costly to purchase. Thirdly, they perform efficiently in PSCs only when doped with hygroscopic dopants such as a bis(trifluoromethane)|sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and additives such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBp).8–10 However, this kind of dopant/additive both raises the manufacturing cost and more importantly restricts the long-term device stability.7,10,11
A suitable HTM for viable commercial applications should (i) exhibit a favorable band alignment with the perovskite layer to guarantee effective transfer of the photoexcited holes from the perovskite to the HTM, (ii) exhibit superior carrier mobility to reduce the series resistance and improve the fill factor (FF), (iii) exhibit low electron affinity to restrict recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface, (iv) exhibit high transparency to minimize optical losses, (v) exhibit a wide optical bandgap so as not to contribute as a second absorber layer in the cell, (vi) exhibit low roughness for homogeneous and highly controlled deposition, (vii) exhibit sufficient hydrophobic nature to enhance the long-term tolerance to humidity, (viii) have exceedingly low production cost for rooftop applications, and (ix) be environmentally friendly so as not to harm the eco-system.12–15
Even though several approaches have been reported to overcome the above-mentioned challenges (complex synthesis, cost, stability etc.),16–19 employing an inorganic HTM layer is still one of the most efficient ways.4 Hitherto, quite a few inorganic HTMs such as CuSCN,4,20 CuI,21 CuInS2,22 CuS,23 CuO,24 Cu2O,24,25 NiO,26 TiS2,27 and FeS228 have been reported. In addition to these inorganic alternatives, delafossite metal oxides of the general formula ABO2 (A = monovalent ions and B = trivalent ions) recently paved the way for cheaper, sustainable, and efficient PSCs as novel inorganic HTMs. Although delafossite metal oxides have been extensively reported as favorable HTM candidates in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), there are only a few reports related to their integration into PSCs. In 2017, Jen and co-workers first reported CuGaO2 with an average diameter of 50–75 nm as an attractive inorganic HTM for highly efficient and stable PSCs in the planar n–i–p configuration.29 Though an encouraging efficiency of 18.51% for a 0.09 cm2 active area was obtained, the corresponding large crystal size and plate-like morphology presented difficulties in controlling their thickness and roughness. More recently, Mitzi and co-workers have investigated CCO as the HTL in the glass/ITO/CCO/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag device structure and reported a stabilized efficiency of >14% for a 0.10 cm2 active area.30 Similar work on ITO/c-CCO/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag was also published by Jen and co-workers in 2018.31 They achieved the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% with outstanding photo-stability. Consequently, these studies demonstrated that CCO, owing to its abundance, favorable band alignment (valence band onset of ∼−5.3 eV) with the perovskite layer, low electron affinity (∼2.1 eV),32 high carrier mobility,33,34 wide band gap,35 and small crystal size/roughness, is a very promising HTM for inverted PSC structures. Although inverted device architectures are frequently preferred for inorganic HTM deposition processes to avoid the decomposition of the perovskite film, the electron transporting layer (ETL) in the inverted architecture still has some limitations such as the requirement of efficient electron extraction abilities and hole-blocking properties.36 Additionally, the ETL should completely cover the perovskite layer to prevent moisture/oxygen damage and should not damage the perovskite layer due to the nature of the solvent.37 In particular, the efficiency of the inverted structure is still lower than that of mesoscopic and conventional planar PSCs because of the limitations given above.
There is no doubt that major bottlenecks delaying further commercialization of PSCs are the high cost and poor long-term stability. To address these issues, we first proposed depositing of CCO as an inorganic HTM onto the triple-cation mixed-halide Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 [FA = CH(NH2)2+ and MA = CH3NH3+] perovskite layer. On the basis of the optimized CCO, a promising efficiency of 16.7% was obtained. More importantly, the unsealed CCO HTM-based device showed a longer shelf life than those based on Spiro-OMeTAD under ambient conditions (relative humidity ∼40%) for 60 days. These results were crowned with the superior operational stability of the CCO-based device under continuous illumination for 500 h. As another important aspect, cost analysis of CCO and Spiro-OMeTAD indicated that CCO is ∼180 times cheaper than Spiro-OMeTAD. All these satisfying results indicate that CCO can be a favourable alternative to the commonly used commercial Spiro-OMeTAD and, therefore, it provides large-scale production potential to dominate the future of the global energy demand.
Experimental details
Materials
All materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless stated otherwise.
Preparation of CCO NPs
Hydrothermal synthesis conditions for CCO NPs were modified from previous studies.32,38 Briefly, 20 mmol copper(II) nitrate hemipentahydrate and 20 mmol chromium(III) nitrate nonahydrate were dissolved in deionized water (DIW). In the meantime, the required amount of sodium hydroxide was dissolved in DIW and poured into the above solution under vigorous stirring. The dark-green solution (70 mL total volume) was stirred for the next 10 min at room temperature (RT) for homogenization. Then, the precursor solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave reactor and kept at ∼220 °C and ∼2.15 MPa for 48 h. Thereafter, the hydrothermal vessel was naturally cooled down to RT. The obtained precipitate was collected after discarding the upper-liquid and washed with diluted hydrochloric acid and ethanol in sequence four times, and then filtered and dried in an oven for 12 h at 90 °C.
Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass with a sheet resistance of ∼10 ohm per square (TCO glass, NSG 10, Nippon sheet glass, Japan) was employed as a transparent conductive substrate. Prior to use, substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with Hellmanex (2% in deionized water) for 30 min, followed by sequential rinsing with de-ionized water, ethanol, and acetone. The substrates were treated with UV–O3 for 15 min to remove the last traces of organic residues. An ∼40 nm-thick compact layer of TiO2 (cl-TiO2) was subsequently deposited via aerosol spray pyrolysis at 450 °C from a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75% in 2-propanol) diluted in ethanol (1:9, volume ratio) with oxygen as a carrier gas. A diluted paste of (30NRD, Dyesol) a mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer was then deposited onto the cl-TiO2 by using spin coating at a spin speed of 4000 rpm, for 20 s (the weight ratio of TiO2:ethanol is 1:6). This was followed by sintering of the substrates at 450 °C for 30 min. The substrates were transferred into a dry air glove box after cooling down to 150 °C for perovskite deposition. The perovskite deposition was carried out in a dry air glove box under controlled atmospheric conditions with humidity <2% (dew point was about −30 °C). Perovskite films were deposited using a single-step deposition method from the precursor solution containing 0.05 M CsI, 0.85 M FAI, 0.15 M MABr, 0.85 M PbI2, and 0.15 M PbBr2 in dimethylformamide/dimethylsulphoxide (4:1/v/v). The spin-coating procedure was performed on the mp-TiO2 films in a two-step program at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured onto the spinning substrate 10 s prior to the end of the spinning. This was followed by annealing the films at 100 °C for 45 min. Subsequently, a Spiro-OMeTAD solution, prepared by dissolving 70 mM Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene and doped at a molar ratio of 0.5 and 3.3 with Li-TFSI (stock solution of 520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) and tBp, respectively, was deposited on the top of the perovskite layer by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Alternatively to obtain the CCO HTL, CCO NPs were dispersed in absolute isopropanol (1 to 20 mg mL−1 in concentration). The suspension was sonicated for 3 h and filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter to avoid the agglomeration. Right before spin coating, this suspension was re-sonicated for 15 min. The CCO suspension was deposited on top of the perovskite layer by spin coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 100 °C for 15 min. Finally, device fabrication was completed after thermal evaporation of an ∼80 nm thick gold layer (before evaporating the electrode, Li-TFSI and tBp-doped Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layers were allowed to oxidize in air overnight). The schematic illustration of device fabrication is given in Fig. S1.†
Characterization
Crystallographic information for CCO NPs, and pristine and HTM-containing perovskite films, was obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance). The elemental chemical states of all ionic species in CCO NPs were examined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific) with monochromatic Al-Kα radiation. The spectra were recorded with an energy step size of 0.1 eV. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed using a photoelectron spectrometer (UPS, Kratos AXIS Supra). The charge mobility of the CCO film was determined with a Hall Effect Measurement (Ecopia, HMS-3000) system at room temperature using the four-probe van der Pauw technique. For mobility measurements, the CCO film was deposited onto the FTO substrate with ∼0.5 μm thickness, and Au top contacts were evaporated on the edges of the sample. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss, Merlin) was used to characterize the morphology of pristine and HTM-containing films and thickness of various layers. The SEM images were obtained by using an in-lens detector at 3 kV accelerating voltage. Moreover, the roughness of the CCO surface was analyzed with an atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanomagnetics). The morphologies and sizes of CCO NPs were characterized by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, 2100F). The optical absorption spectra of pristine and HTM-containing films were recorded with a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (CARY-5). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra of pristine and HTM-containing samples were recorded with a spectrofluorometer (Fluorolog 322) by exciting the samples at a fixed wavelength of 460 nm and scanning the emission monochromator from 650 to 850 nm. The same spectrometer working in a time-correlated single-photon counting mode was used for the measurements of photoluminescence decay kinetics with a sub-nanosecond time resolution. For hole injection studies, the samples were excited from the top side. The hydrophilicity of pristine and HTM-containing surfaces as a function of time was assessed by the contact angle measurements with a drop shape analyzer (KRÜSS, DSA100) at ambient temperature. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the fabricated devices were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400) using a 450 W xenon lamp (Oriel) under AM 1.5 G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 as the light source. The shelf stability measurements were carried out both under dry box and atmospheric conditions with a relative humidity (RH) of >40%. Operational stability measurements were performed with a Biologic MPG2 potentiostat under AM 1.5. The devices with a metal aperture mask were mounted on the sample holder flushed with nitrogen. The devices were measured with maximum power point (MPP) tracking under constant illumination. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the devices were recorded using an EQE system with an LED light source (Ariadne EQE) in the DC mode without any voltage bias. The J–V and EQE curves of all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask having an area of 0.16 cm2. The Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed using a potentiostat (BioLogic MPG2) equipped with an LED light source (100 mW cm−2) over the frequency range of 1 Hz to 500 kHz at 0 mV DC bias voltage. A black aperture mask (0.16 cm2) was also used for the IS measurements under the light.
Results and discussion
The diffraction pattern of CCO NPs is depicted in Fig. 1a. For as-synthesized state, observable diffraction peaks in the pattern, corresponding to (006), (101), (012), (015), (018), and (110) planes, can be readily indexed to 3R–CCO (rhombohedral, R3m, JCPDS file card no: 39-0247). No peak corresponding to undesired secondary phases, i.e., CuO, Cr2O3, or CuCr2O4, was observed indicating that the as-synthesized NPs are phase pure. The resulting corollary is in accordance with other studies.39 A close observation reveals that each of the diffraction peaks exhibits a broad line width, which is expected from the small size of the NPs. The average crystallite size was calculated to be 10.3 nm by applying the Scherrer equation to the (006) plane. This was further confirmed by the corresponding BF TEM (Fig. 1b), HRTEM (Fig. 1c), and STEM (Fig. 1d) images. As clearly seen, the obtained NPs possess the hexagonal morphology with the statistically confirmed average diameter of ∼10.8 nm (Fig. 1e). These features match well with the XRD calculations. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image in the inset of Fig. 1 and HRTEM image in Fig. 1c revealed a clear crystalline structure with a lattice spacing of about 0.569 nm, which could be indexed to the (006) plane of the CCO delafossite structure.40 As evidenced by the AFM topography image in Fig. 1f, the dense CCO film presents a flat morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of only 2.04 nm which is better than that of reported inorganic HTMs.29,31 This can be ascribed to the hydrocarbon-free surface of CCO; therefore, it can produce a smoother CCO film.32

The chemical compositions and valence states of the constituent ions in CCO NPs were analyzed by XPS measurements. The survey, Cu-2p, Cr-2p and O-1s XPS spectra of the NPs are given in Fig. S2(a–d).† Two intense peaks at binding energies of 952.3 eV and 932.4 eV correspond to Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2, respectively. This observation reveals that Cu ions are in the 1+ oxidation state. Similarly, the binding energies of the Cr 2p1/2 and Cr 2p3/2 at 586.4 and 576.6 eV indicate that the oxidation state of Cr ions is 3+. The O 1s peak located at 530.0 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen O2− in the CCO lattice whereas the broad peak at 531.7 eV arises from the oxygen species chemisorbed at the oxygen vacancies. All these obtained binding energy values are consistent with those of the hexagonal CCO,41 confirming the pure phase of the as-prepared CCO NPs. From XPS surface analysis, the Cu:Cr:O ratio was also calculated to be 0.96:1.00:1.96, demonstrating the apparent Cu and O deficiency in the prepared material, which is nearly consistent with the designed stoichiometric composition. Cu vacancies induce the generation of holes in the lattice and thus endow CCO NPs with a p-type semiconducting nature and a high carrier mobility of 0.81 cm2 V−1 s−1 as confirmed by Hall-effect measurements. In addition to acceptable charge transport properties, a moisture-blocking behavior is important for an HTM to enhance the long-term tolerance humidity of the device by prohibiting the water ingression into the perovskite film. To explore the hydrophobic nature of CCO, the contact angle measurements as a function of water loading time were conducted for perovskite/CCO and perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD films (Fig. 2a and b). The perovskite/CCO film exhibited a prevailing hydrophobicity of 94.1° (90.5° after 10 min), while the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD film exhibited 70.4° (45.8° after 10 min) owing to the hygroscopic properties of the dopants inside. Although inorganic nanocrystals are known as hydrophilic materials, the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of inorganic nanocrystals in bulk is dominantly related to the surface topology of the material. The porous structures include both the internal pores of each particle and the void space between the individual particles that decreases the hydrophobicity of the material due to the liquid penetration. The admissible hydrophobicity of the CCO HTM can be attributed to its non-porous and dense nature. Taking all these parameters into consideration, it is obvious that the recommended CCO NPs can be used as a promising HTM on the triple-cation mixed-halide Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite film.

The horizontal coordinate refers to the loading time of water drops on film surfaces (1 s to 10 min). Although the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM-based perovskite film readily absorbs water, its wetting ability can be considerably suppressed when replaced with the inorganic CCO HTM.

The typical XRD patterns and UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite and perovskite/HTM films can be seen in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Moreover, the calculated bandgap of the pristine perovskite in Fig. 3c shows a satisfying formation of perovskite and perovskite/HTM layers. Besides above-mentioned superior properties of CCO, the consistency of this material in the device architecture is also important. To inspect this, energy levels of CCO NPs have been investigated by UPS measurements. As clearly seen in Fig. S3(a–e),† the valence band maximum of CCO was estimated to be ∼−5.3 eV whereas the conduction band minimum deduced from the optical bandgap (3.02 eV) is ∼−2.3 eV, in good agreement with previous reports.30,42 As clearly seen in the schematic cross-sectional view of the device architecture (Fig. 2c) and corresponding energy level diagram (Fig. 2d), a close alignment with the valence band of the perovskite (−5.4 eV)43,44 makes CCO a potential candidate for the efficient hole transfer at the corresponding interface, followed by the fast hole transport through CCO and Au.

(d) Steady-state and (e) time-resolved PL spectra of the perovskite films with and without HTM layers. PL measurements reported herein were conducted with the films deposited on FTO/cl-TiO2/mp-TiO2. 
To evaluate the hole extraction ability of CCO from the perovskite layer, we conducted steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements upon excitation at 560 nm (Fig. 3d). In this regard, samples were prepared in FTO/perovskite, FTO/perovskite/CCO, and FTO/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD structures. The PL emission of the pristine perovskite in the absence of a quenching layer appears at around 780 nm with a strong intensity. When CCO and Spiro-OMeTAD were inserted, PL intensities were pronouncedly suppressed, which can be ascribed to the carrier extraction across the interface.4,45 The PL quenching ratio for CCO is slightly better than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. This indicates a preferable charge transfer at the perovskite/CCO interface. Furthermore, to gain an insight into the dynamics of the photo-generated holes in the perovskite material, time-resolved single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements were carried out. The PL decay curves are displayed in Fig. 3e, and the corresponding parameters are tabulated in Table S1† for comparison. Solid lines in Fig. 3e represent the outcome of the biexponential fitting, y = A1exp(−x/τ1) + A2exp(−x/τ2) + y0. The initial fast PL decay indicates rapid injection of holes from the valence band of the perovskite into that of the HTM, whereas the long lasting component could be associated with the charges present in the absorber layer.46 As is known, a long decay time indicates a long exciton diffusion length and low defect density in the perovskite structure. For the pristine perovskite, τave was obtained as 78 ns, indicating a high excitonic quality. On the other hand, the introduction of HTM quenching layers on the surface of the pristine perovskite significantly accelerates the PL decay. The τave for Spiro-OMeTAD decreased to 28.68 ns, whereas only 16.42 ns was obtained for the CCO HTM. This feature indicates that hole transfer at the perovskite/CCO interface is faster than that at the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface. This behavior of the CCO HTM can be explained by the superior carrier mobility and homogeneous surface morphology.2,47
The dependence of device performance on the surface morphology was first investigated to identify the optimal concentration value for further device fabrication. To evaluate the surface morphology of the CCO film, CCO NPs in different concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg mL−1) were deposited over the perovskite surface and employed as the HTM layer in the n–i–p device architecture. As clearly seen in top-view FE-SEM images (Fig. S4†), photovoltaic performance (Table S2†) is closely related to the surface coverage of the HTM layer. As is well known, poor HTM coverage on the perovskite layer probably causes the direct contact between the top metal electrode and perovskite as well as limits preventing the moisture penetration. On the other hand, agglomeration of the HTM over the perovskite layer leads to poor inter-connection and adhesion of the HTM with the top electrode and perovskite, leading to deterioration in its electrical and optical properties. At a low CCO concentration (i.e., 1 mg mL−1), while the photovoltaic parameters of PSCs were very poor due to the non-homogeneous coating of the perovskite surface, all the parameters were improved at an appropriate concentration (i.e., 10 mg mL−1). This improvement is then caused by the lowering of the photovoltaic parameters due to the agglomeration on the surface at high concentration values. As a result, the photovoltaic performance of three independent devices in each case showed that 10 mg mL−1 is the best concentration for high-quality CCO HTM-based PSCs.
The top-view FE-SEM images of pristine and CCO NP (10 mg mL−1)-deposited perovskite films are given in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. As clearly seen in the inset of Fig. 4b, CCO NPs homogenously deposited on the high-quality perovskite surface (Fig. 4a). This homogenous deposition and distribution can be attributed to the relatively small crystal size (10 nm), roughness (2.04 nm) of the NPs, and appropriate concentration of the CCO solution. Representative cross-sectional FE-SEM views of completed photovoltaic devices with Spiro-OMeTAD and CCO HTM layers can be seen in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The images showed that all the layers are well inter-connected and have well-defined interfaces. From the bottom to the top of these images, layers of FTO (700 nm), cl-TiO2 (ca. 40 nm), mp-TiO2 (ca. 150 nm), the perovskite of Cs0.05(MA0.15FA0.85)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (ca. 500 nm), Spiro-OMeTAD/CCO (ca. 200/70 nm) and gold (ca. 80 nm) were clearly distinguished.

After the successful insertion of the thin and pinhole-free CCO HTM, we investigated the photovoltaic characteristics of the corresponding devices. Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of champion PSCs employing CCO and Spiro-OMeTAD HTMs under AM 1.5 G irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. A PCE histogram chart of CCO HTM-based devices is also given in the inset of Fig. 5a. The obtained photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs are listed in Table 1. The best CCO-based cell, among 20 devices, affords an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.04 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 23.20 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69, yielding a PCE of 16.7%. Owing to the higher hole mobility of CCO, CCO-based devices exhibited a comparable Jsc to the devices based on Spiro-OMeTAD (PCE of 19.4%). To further confirm this similarity in Jsc, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and integrated Jsc values of the PSCs were measured (Fig. 5b). The integrated Jsc values estimated from the EQE spectra (23.01 mA cm−2 and 23.26 mA cm−2 for CCO and Spiro-OMeTAD, respectively) are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. On the one hand, no contribution to the photocurrent as a result of absorption overlapping between the HTM and perovskite was observed. On the other hand, the lower Voc and FF of the CCO-HTM based device can be ascribed to the crystalline nature of CCO which forms a distinct inter-connection/adhesion, which may form charge traps at the interface, as compared to amorphous Spiro-OMeTAD. Even though the optimum inter-connection and adhesion of the HTM with the top electrode and perovskite have been obtained for the CCO concentration of 10 mg mL−1, this inter-connection/adhesion ability may be relatively lower than that of the Spiro-OMeTAD HTM. To further understand the recombination and hole diffusion kinetics at the HTM/perovskite interface, charge transport properties of the HTM within the devices have been investigated (Fig. S5†). As clearly seen in the Nyquist plot, obtained under 100 mW cm−2 light intensity at 0 mV bias, the high frequency arc can be ascribed to the diffusion of holes through the HTM (HTM resistance, RHTM). The CCO-based device presents a lower resistive voltage loss due to the efficient hole transport. On the other hand, the recombination resistance (Rrec) of CCO (1.84 kΩ) in the low frequency arc is lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (2.31 kΩ). This indicates that recombination in the CCO-based device is high compared to that in the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device, which limits the Voc of these devices.

The stabilized power outputs from devices based on CCO and Spiro-OMeTAD were measured to be 16.5% and 19.0%, respectively (Fig. 5c), consistent with the obtained PCE. The difference in PCEs can be ascribed to the ionic migration/accumulation (hysteresis effect) in the device structure. The scan direction measurements were then performed to evaluate the J–V hysteresis behaviors of CCO and Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. As seen in Fig. 5d, the measured PCE differences between the forward and reverse scans are 1.1% and 0.4% for Spiro-OMeTAD and CCO-based PSCs, respectively. These results showed a similar tendency to the maximum power point (MPP) outputs and further confirmed that the device based on CCO shows smaller hysteresis than that based on Spiro-OMeTAD. This behavior can be explained by its higher hole mobility than Spiro-OMeTAD (in the order of 10−3 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, upon doping with additives)7 which facilitates charge transportation and/or favorable interface between the perovskite and CCO which stores less/no charges.
Long-term stability is one of the most important factors in the commercialization of PSCs. Fig. 5e shows the shelf stability of the corresponding devices monitored under dry conditions (first 7 days) and the ambient environment of 40% relative humidity (next 53 days) at room temperature without encapsulation. Obviously, the devices based on CCO presented better stability under ambient conditions than those based on Spiro-OMeTAD while both presented quite a similar behavior under dry conditions. The PCE remained at 83% of the initial value in the devices based on CCO after 60 days, whereas it decreased to 24% of the initial value in Spiro-OMeTAD HTM-based devices. This substantial difference in the stability of devices based on different HTMs can be attributed to the dopant-free network and hydrophobic nature of the CCO NPs.9 As discussed above, inorganic CCO NPs present good coverage on the surface and are more hydrophobic than Spiro-OMeTAD. Additionally, owing to the inorganic nature of CCO, it behaves as a blocking layer at the perovskite/CCO interface against moisture-induced degradation (Fig. 2b). In addition to stability, reproducibility is another key factor for the commercialization of PSCs. To test the reproducibility of CCO-based devices, 20 devices were fabricated. The excellent reproducibility with a narrow statistical distribution of the photovoltaic metrics can be seen in Fig. 6 and Table 1. All these favorable properties indicate CCO as a promising HTM for stable and sustainable PSCs.

The voltage scan rate for all scans was 5 mV s−1, and no device preconditioning, i.e., light soaking or forward voltage bias applied for a long time, was applied before starting the measurement. 
To further investigate the operational stability, the devices were kept at the MPP under continuous one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) in an inert atmosphere at room temperature. Fig. 7 shows the absolute operational PCE with respect to the HTM. The device with CCO demonstrated outstanding photo-stability, retaining around 88% of its initial PCE after 500 h. In contrast, the PCE of the device with Spiro-OMeTAD showed two regimes with different degradation speeds: an initial quick degradation within the first ∼50 h, followed by a slower degradation. The PCE of the device with Spiro-OMeTAD gradually decreased by ∼70% over 500 h. The stability issue is mainly caused by the very mobile lithium ions in the Spiro-OMeTAD which are prone to penetrate into the perovskite and even the ETL layer, interfering with device operation.7 Moreover, the amorphous state of Spiro-OMeTAD can easily induce crystallization due to the elevated temperature under operating conditions, indicating a poor film quality.7 Based on these phenomena, the mechanism of the superior stability of CCO NPs can be explained by its non-additive nature, inorganic structure, and high thermal stability.

This work not only indicates a significant enhancement in the stability of PSCs under humid conditions but also strongly claims a reduction in production cost by employing an inorganic CCO HTM. The comparison of the calculated cost parameters when using CCO and Spiro-OMeTAD as HTLs can be seen in Table S3.† As clearly seen in this comparison, ∼34.60 € is needed to synthesise 1 mL of a Spiro-OMeTAD solution whereas ∼17.34 € is enough to obtain ∼1.8 g of CCO NPs. More importantly, 4500 CCO-based devices can be fabricated with 1.8 g of CCO NPs (0.004 € per device) while only 25 Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices can be fabricated with 1 mL of Spiro-OMeTAD (1.39 € per device). Considering the complex production systems and additional processing steps of Spiro-OMeTAD, this current prospect of CCO NPs presents ∼180 times lower cost, standing out over most of the reported HTM alternatives.
Conclusions
In this study, we examined an inorganic HTM, CCO, to address the cost and stability issues caused by the highly expensive Spiro-OMeTAD and highly mobile dopants, respectively. These dopants can penetrate into the perovskite and even TiO2 layers, interfering with device operation. CCO NPs were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal route and employed for the first time as a HTM layer in n–i–p structured PSCs. In addition to their hysteresis-free promising efficiency (16.7%), CCO-based devices exhibited remarkable stability under ambient conditions for 60 days. In the shelf life measurements, the CCO-based device exhibited a more resistive behavior against humidity compared to the one with Spiro-OMeTAD. The requirement of using dopant-free inorganic HTMs was further demonstrated by a cost estimation approach. Overall, this novel delafossite HTM strategy clearly provides a solution for stability enhancement and lowering the cost of PSC technology and paves the way for the use of other delafossite structures.
