    , Accepted 17th December 2019First published on 18th December 2019AbstractPerovskite crystals post-treated with methylammonium and formamidinium halide materials were compared. The bandgap energy of perovskites changed upon incorporation of CH5N2+, Br−, and Cl− ions. Perovskites treated with formamidinium iodide yielded the best efficiency of 20.06% due to an increase in photocurrent density by decreased bandgap energy.
Organometal halide perovskite materials are of interest because of their potential as light absorbers for solar cells.1,2 They are capable of strongly absorbing light in the visible range and their long carrier diffusion length (>μm)3 allows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.2%,4 which is similar to that of commercial silicon solar cells. In addition, they can be processed in solution at low temperatures, which enables their relatively inexpensive roll-to-roll mass production using flexible plastic substrates.5–8 For these reasons, the perovskite solar cells offer the possibility of cost-effective and highly efficient power production systems.
In the solar cell structure, charge carriers generated by light irradiation diffuse through perovskite layers toward electron (in most cases, TiO2) and hole transport layers. Therefore, to minimize recombination and resistance loss, perovskite layers of high coverage, uniformity, crystallinity, and purity are required.9–11 Usually, perovskites are formed by reaction of a methylammonium halide (CH3NH3X = MAX) or formamidinium halide (CH(NH2)2X = FAX) with an equivalent amount of a lead halide (MAX + PbX2 → MAPbX3). A recent report indicated that a precursor solution containing an excess amount of PbI2 produced a perovskite layer with a large crystal size, which increases the charge carrier lifetime of the layer.12,13 However, use of PbI2-rich precursors results in retaining resistive PbI2 in the perovskite layers, which impedes carrier diffusion.14,15
To address this issue, post-treatment of perovskites has been studied intensively. Treating perovskite layers with MAI16,17 (MA = CH3NH3) and FABr18 [FA = CH(NH2)2] converts the PbI2 on the perovskite surface into MAPbI3 and FAPbI2Br perovskite materials, respectively. Such perovskites, formed from PbI2 impurity by post-treatment should be doped in the pristine perovskite and affect composition and electronic property. However, a comparative study using different treatment reagents (e.g., MAI, MABr, and FAI) has not yet been investigated.
The present study investigated the ion composition effect of methylammonium and formamidinium halides for surface treatment of Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskites. Treating perovskites with MAI, MABr, and FAI improved the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of solar cells due to the improvement in carrier rectification. In addition, results showed that the wavelength range of the photocurrent response could be adjusted based on the ion incorporation changes induced by the post-treatment. The energy gap of the perovskites increased with MABr and MACl treatment due to the incorporation of Br− and Cl− ions, respectively, and the VOC improved, but the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) decreased. In contrast, FAI treatment narrowed the energy gap and increased JSC to give the best PCE of 20.06%.
Devices were fabricated as follows. On an F-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, a compact TiO2 layer (thickness ∼ 50 nm) was formed by spray pyrolysis at 400 °C. On the compact TiO2 layer, a mesoporous TiO2 layer (thickness ∼ 150 nm) was formed by spin-coating the TiO2 paste (18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd) followed by sintering at 500 °C. The Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite layer formed on the mesoporous TiO2, according to a previous report.19 A solution of 4:1 (v/v) N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide containing FAI (1.0 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), and PbBr2 (0.2 M) with a CsI additive was spin-coated on the substrate. During spin-coating, chlorobenzene was dropped on the substrate to induce perovskite crystallization. Then the substrate was annealed at 105 °C for 1 h to form a Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite. As post-treatment, 2-propanol solutions of MAI, MABr, MACl, and FAI were spin-coated on the Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite and annealed at 105 °C for 5 min. Further experimental details are provided in the ESI.†
First, the perovskite layers were characterized before and after post-treatment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data are shown in Fig. 1a, b and Fig. S1 (ESI†). A diffraction pattern for the Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite19 was observed for all perovskite substrates (Fig. S1, ESI†). The PbI2 diffraction peak at 2θ = 12.7° in the pristine perovskite substrate represented unreacted PbI2 in the perovskite layer. However, the PbI2 peak was not observed for perovskites treated with any reagent (MAI, MABr, MACl, or FAI) (Fig. 1a), which indicates that PbI2 impurities in the perovskite layers were removed successfully by post-treatment due to reaction with methylammonium halide or formamidinium iodide. The perovskite peak at 14.08° underwent a slight negative shift upon MAI and FAI post-treatment, whereas a positive peak shift occurred upon MABr and MACl treatment (Fig. 1b). These results were due to the incorporation of a large I− ion (radius = 220 pm21) by MAI and FAI treatment that increased the lattice constant of perovskites, and the incorporation of small Br− (radius = 196 pm21) and Cl− (radius = 181 pm21) ions by MABr and MACl treatment that decreased the lattice constant. This supports conversion of PbI2 to perovskites. The scanning electron microscopy images of the perovskite layers are shown in Fig. 1c–g. The morphology and crystal size (200–500 nm in diameter) of the perovskite did not undergo any significant change upon post-treatment. The amount of perovskite converted from PbI2 by post-treatment was too small to be observed. The absorption spectra of the perovskites are shown in Fig. 1h and i. When a perovskite was treated with FAI, the absorption onset shifted from 775 to 780 nm due to the incorporation of FA+ ions, which decreased the band gap energy of the perovskite.22 In contrast, perovskites treated with MABr and MACl exhibit an onset wavelength blue shift due to the incorporation of Br− and Cl− ions, which increased the band gap energy of perovskites.23,24 This result suggests that Br− and Cl− ions added by post-treatment were distributed throughout the whole perovskite layer and it is not the case when a thin perovskite layer converted from PbI2 (MAPbI2Br and MAPbI2Cl) was formed on the top of a pristine perovskite. If the thin perovskite layer (MAPbI2Br and MAPbI2Cl) was formed on top of the pristine perovskite by post-treatment, a decrease in photoabsorption in the 740–780 nm wavelength range could not be observed in MABr and MACl-treated perovskites.

The conduction band edge potential value for TiO2 was obtained from the literature.20 
In combination with photoelectron yield spectroscopy data, we confirmed the energy levels of perovskites (Fig. 1j).
To evaluate the solar cell performance, hole-transport layers were formed on perovskite layers by spin-coating a 2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) solution. The Au contacts were formed by vapor deposition (area = 3 mm × 3 mm). A cross-sectional SEM image of the solar cell is shown in Fig. 2a. The thicknesses of the mesoporous TiO2, perovskite layer, and spiro-OMeTAD layer were ∼150 nm, ∼450 nm, and ∼250 nm, respectively. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves measured under 1 sun illumination and photovoltaic parameters of solar cells with and without post-treatment of the perovskites are provided in Fig. 2b and c and Table 1. Since perovskite solar cells usually exhibit hysteresis in the J–V curves,25 we evaluated and compared parameters from both scan directions, separately. The VOC improved in both voltage scan directions by all post-treatments. In addition, the PCE of solar cells was improved by MAI, MABr, and FAI treatment due to an improved FF. The JSC value of FAI-treated perovskite solar cells was greater than those resulting from MAI and MABr treatments, due to the smaller band gap energy observed by EQE spectra (Fig. 2d and e), resulting in the greatest PCE value (up to 20.06%).

To clarify the origin of the improved FF and VOC values, the dark current behavior of the solar cells was compared (Fig. 3). The dark current onset voltages of solar cells with and without post-treatment were similar (∼0.6 V). At a bias voltage less than 0.6 V, MACl-treated perovskite solar cells exhibited greater leakage current than solar cells with other post-treatment or without treatment, which indicates that the MACl-treated perovskite has a large number of trap states compared to other perovskites. Incorporation of Cl− ions, which are smaller than Br− and I− in the pristine Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite, produced defects in the perovskite layer. The increased trap density decreased the FF and PCE loss for MACl-treated solar cells. In contrast, MAI-, MABr-, and FAI-treated perovskites had smaller leakage current than non-treated perovskites, which indicates that post-treatment decreased the number of traps. However, at a bias voltage greater than 0.6 V, MAI-, MABr-, and FAI-treated perovskites produced larger currents than untreated perovskites, which indicates improved perovskite conductivity by trap filling resulting from post-treatment.

A comparison of methylammonium and formamidinium halide materials for surface treatment of perovskite crystals showed that, as the ion component was adjusted by reaction with excess PbI2 in the perovskite layers, the perovskite energy gap changed. The FAI treatment resulted in a greater improvement in solar cell performance (up to 20.06%) than the MAI, MABr, and MACl treatment, due to increased JSC based on a narrowed perovskite energy gap upon FA+ incorporation. As reported in the literature,16–18 the post-treatment technique is a powerful tool to remove PbI2 in perovskites and enhance solar cell performance. Our study shows that by careful selection of post-treatment reagents, the electronic properties of perovskites can be tuned for further PCE improvement.
