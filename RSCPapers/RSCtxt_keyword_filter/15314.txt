    , Accepted 3rd June 2016First published on 6th June 2016AbstractThe synthesis and performance of a cost-effective mixed fullerene at the 100+ g scale with a reaction yield of 85% is demonstrated. The cost to convert a fullerene such as C60 into the mixed acceptor blend is less than $1 g−1. The photovoltaic performance of the mixed acceptor is demonstrated in both small scale and roll-to-roll printed devices.
Introduction
The successful commercialisation of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology will depend on a combination of three key parameters: device efficiency, lifetime and cost (Fig. 1). The OPV research community has so far focussed primarily on improving device efficiency with device lifetime becoming increasingly recognised as an equally important aspect of research. However, reducing the cost of OPV materials has thus far had much less attention, yet is an equally important scientific challenge that is crucial to the future development of OPV. Currently, the high cost of materials is holding back scientific research at the large scale, and it is increasingly recognised that advances in the cost and scalability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) active materials are urgently required for the rapid industrial development of printed solar technologies.1
 Fig. 1  The three key parameters for successful photovoltaic technology: efficiency, lifetime, and cost. 
Recent projections of commercial-scale roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing have revealed that the cost-of-materials (COM) forms the largest contribution to the total module costs.2 A further examination of this economic breakdown reveals that the cost of the commonly used electron acceptor, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), can constitute as much as 16% of the entire COM. Thus, there is considerable scope to improve the economics of OPV module production through the development of less expensive acceptor materials.
There are a number of reports of the fabrication of poly(3-hexylthiophene (P3HT)-based OPV devices with low-cost neat C60 fullerene as the acceptor material,3–6 however the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has not yet matched that of even the most common acceptor material, PCBM. Recent work using blends of C60:C70 with the donor polymer TQ1 have shown that efficiencies comparable with devices using PCBM as the acceptor are indeed possible with other polymer systems.7 Neat C70 fullerene, although significantly more expensive than C60, has been shown to give strong performance of up to 5.9% when blended with small molecule donors,8 while the donor polymer PTB7 when mixed with a blend of C60:C70 has shown performance of 6.0%.9 However, it is uncertain how well the use of C60 or C70 would translate to low cost R2R manufacture. R2R processed OPVs generally require thicker active layers10 to avoid shunting defects caused by coating onto non-planar printed electrodes such as Ag grid/PEDOT:PSS, so the limited solubility of C60 in even the better fullerene solvents such as chlorobenzene (7.0 mg mL−111) and xylenes (5.2 mg mL−111) make achieving active layers thicker than 100 nm whilst coating at high speed more difficult than for compounds of greater solubility such as PCBM. Work by Mendaza et al. showing enhanced fullerene solubility when using C60:C70 blends9 suggests that this solubility limitation could be overcome when combined with good fullerene solvents such as o-DCB and 1-chloronaphthalene, however the high boiling point and slow drying of these solvents ultimately limit the speed at which such inks could be coated at the R2R scale.
The $ kW h−1 figure of merit for an OPV module scales linearly with electron acceptor material cost and inversely with PCE.2 Realising the promise of a cost-effective OPV technology therefore requires a combination of low materials cost, high processability, and sufficient PCE.12 While there has been much effort in recent years towards the development of new acceptor molecules that deliver higher device efficiencies13,14 little attention has been paid to the cost and R2R processability of these new materials. For example, He et al. showed that using indene-C60 bis-adduct (ICBA) as the electron acceptor instead of PCBM resulted in a 40% increase in PCE when used in combination with P3HT.13 However, in the absence of detailed cost estimates for the material synthesis processes, it is not clear that these new materials will improve the $ kW h−1 module cost, which is key to the commercial success of R2R manufacturing. In addition, there is an urgent need for the synthesis of organic semiconductors on the kg scale to enable R2R organic solar cell production.
Motivated by these two drivers, we have developed a new low-cost acceptor material consisting of a mixture of indene-C60 adducts. The synthesis of this material is based on the conventional ICBA synthesis but, importantly, eliminates much of the costly purification process. Here, we demonstrate that this low-cost fullerene mixture produces comparable PCEs to PCBM in small-scale devices and can be used as a direct replacement for PCBM in low-cost R2R printed OPV.
Results and discussion
Indene-adducts of fullerenes are easily synthesised by the simple reflux of indene and a fullerene, such as C60 (Fig. 2).13,15,16 The ratio of mono-, bis- and tris-indene adducts is influenced by the starting ratio of indene:fullerene in the reaction mixture, with higher ratios favouring the formation of a greater fraction of the higher adduct products. The photovoltaic performance of each adduct with P3HT varies, with ICBA giving the highest performance of ∼6.5%,17 followed by the indene-C60 mono-adduct (ICMA), which is almost identical in performance to PCBM, at ∼4%.13 Although the indene-C60 tris-adduct (ICTA) exhibits the highest VOC (∼0.92 V), P3HT:ICTA blends deliver much lower photovoltaic performance (∼1.5%) compared to the P3HT:ICMA and P3HT:ICBA blends. This lower PCE is due to a combination of lower light absorption16 and lower electron mobility arising from the insulating effects of the indene units reducing inter-molecular coupling.18
 Fig. 2  Synthesis of indene-adducts of C60 fullerene. 
The synthesis of indene-adducts of fullerene is a simple one-pot procedure, which does not require an inert atmosphere or highly purified or anhydrous-grade solvents. This aspect is important given that the cost of organic electronic materials is known to increase linearly with the number of synthetic steps.19 With improved methods for generation of C60 and extraction from fullerene soot,20,21 the price of C60 has fallen dramatically in recent years and is now available for less than $20 g−1 on the 100 g scale. Furthermore, the reaction to synthesise indene-adducts is itself very low-cost (<$1 g−1 to functionalise C60) since the cost of the indene and solvent are almost negligible. By far the greatest contribution to the cost of an indene-adduct (such as ICBA) is the purification step. The very low polarity of C60 and its indene adducts means that there are very few solvent mixtures that can achieve chromatographic separation of the reaction products on simple silica supports. Moreover, for the few solvent systems in the eluotropic series that can achieve some separation (e.g. hexane:toluene 7:1), the solubility of the indene-fullerenes is so limited that only a small mass of ICBA can be purified at a time, even on reasonably sized chromatography columns. For example, as little as 500 mg of crude ICBA will exceed the solubility limit in hexanes:toluene 7:1 on a 125 mm diameter column, resulting in poor fullerene separation and recovery. By contrast, an identically sized column can successfully purify 13 g of crude PCBM reaction mixture due to the much greater solubility of PCBM in solvents (such as chlorobenzene and toluene) which achieve good separation. Furthermore, a single pass through a column is often insufficient to achieve a high purity fraction. Columns based on functionalised silica may give better separation, however their cost is much greater. A further complication is that different isomers of the multi-adducts possess similar retention properties and therefore may prevent the isolation of pure adducts due to the overlap of peaks during separation.18 Solvent and stationary phase costs therefore contribute the majority of the cost of ICBA production, and the slow and tedious purification procedure makes ICBA less desirable for large-scale R2R OPV than the more soluble, and thus more easily separated, PCBM adducts, despite the more complex synthesis (and hence higher cost) of the PCBM-based materials.
It would therefore be highly advantageous if the expensive purification step could be eliminated and the indene-C60 adduct mixture itself used as the acceptor material in OPV devices. However, to date there have been no studies of the effect of these indene-C60 adduct mixtures on device performance or whether they can be used in R2R coating systems. As a first step, the indene synthesis was altered to ensure that the mixture contained the greatest fraction of the more efficient bis-adduct. By limiting the indene:C60 ratio in the reaction mixture to 2:1, ICxA (where x = mono-, bis-, or tris-adducts) is formed, whereby the majority product is ICBA. The crude ICxA mixture was separated from unreacted C60 by dissolving in CHCl3 and performing a simple filtration to separate the soluble indene-adducts from the almost insoluble C60 (0.16 mg mL−1 in CHCl311). The reaction is readily scalable, with yields of 85% observed for reaction scales of up to 132 g. This yield corresponds to a mass yield of 110 g of ICxA for every 100 g of C60 used, plus 15 g of recovered C60. As a result of the effective utilization of all indene adducts in the reaction mixture the overall yield is much higher than e.g. reported ICBA yields in batch synthesis (41%16), flow synthesis (54%22) or in microwave synthesis (62%23), without the need for expensive laboratory equipment. Furthermore, we routinely collect the unreacted C60 for reuse in subsequent reactions thus ensuring essentially no loss of fullerene material.
While chlorinated and aromatic solvents are generally undesirable due to their toxicity, for reactions involving fullerenes they are difficult to avoid as there are few solvents available that will adequately solubilise C60. We chose to use synthesis-grade o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as it is relativity common, low cost ($17/L) and is an excellent solvent for C60. By deliberately avoiding chromatographic purification, solvent use is minimized (16 mL of o-DCB and 22 mL of chloroform per gram of ICxA produced) and waste is much less than for the synthesis and purification of other fullerene acceptors such as PCBM or ICBA. While we have made no attempt at recovering and reusing solvents due to the small amounts used, o-DCB could be easily separated from the other solvents via distillation and reused in subsequent reactions.
UV-vis spectroscopy was used to determine the relative ratios of the indene adducts in the ICxA mixture. UV-vis spectra of known dilute concentrations (2.5 × 10−4 g mL−1) of ICMA, ICBA, ICTA and ICxA were measured (ESI†) and the pure indene-adduct spectra used as the basis functions for the principal component analysis (PCA) of the UV-vis spectrum of the ICxA solution.
The UV-vis compositional analysis (Table 1) is in excellent agreement with the chromatographic separation of the ICxA mixture (see ESI†), which indicated that the mass ratio of ICMA:ICBA:ICTA is 36:53:11. UV-vis spectra of the P3HT:ICxA films were also measured and compared with the spectra for the P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA films (Fig. 3A). The UV-vis spectra of the three active layer blend films are quite similar, especially in the 400–700 nm wavelength region; indicating a similar extent of polymer crystallinity in all three blends.24–26 The major differences occur in the location and size of the fullerene peaks in the 200–400 nm wavelength region. However, overall there is very little difference in the absorption profile of the three blends and all have roughly equivalent light absorption characteristics.

Whilst Fig. 3B and the data in Table 2 show that the JSC of the ICxA device is lower than both the PCBM and ICBA devices, the VOC of the ICxA device (∼0.80 V) is comparable to that of the ICBA device (∼0.82 V). The PCE of the P3HT:ICxA blend is therefore similar to that of the P3HT:PCBM blend. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the blends (Fig. 3C) are in good agreement with the device JSC values. The EQE measurements reveal that the P3HT:ICxA device has a similar profile to that of the P3HT:ICBA but with a lower relative overall current output. By contrast, the P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA blend devices have approximately equivalent current output.
OPV devices were also fabricated by mixing pristine components (ICMA, ICBA, ICTA) in the same ratio as found in ICxA. The performance was in excellent agreement to the P3HT:ICxA device efficiency (within 4%), demonstrating the purity of the mono-, bis- and tris-adducts in the ICxA mixture and the absence of higher adducts.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of P3HT:PCBM, P3HT:ICBA and P3HT:ICxA active layer films are presented in Fig. 4. All films are remarkably uniform with an absence of large aggregates and other film defects. The root mean square roughness (Rq) of the P3HT:PCBM, P3HT:ICBA and P3HT:ICxA films are 1.37 nm, 1.91 nm and 1.82 nm, respectively, and show that for all blends the polymer and fullerene are well-mixed and form films of almost identical surface roughness.

Fig. 5A shows the fluorescence spectra for P3HT, PCBM, ICBA and ICxA for an excitation wavelength of 535 nm. At this wavelength, only P3HT emission was measured and was used to probe exciton dissociation in the BHJ blend films. Fig. 5B shows that appreciable fluorescence was measured for P3HT:PCBM, P3HT:ICBA and P3HT:ICxA BHJ films indicating that exciton dissociation is incomplete. The integrated fluorescence was divided by the absorption fraction at the excitation wavelength and gives a measure for the exciton dissociation efficiency. The fluorescence quenching results are summarised in Table 3 and indicate that P3HT:ICBA is almost 3 times more effective at quenching P3HT emission than P3HT:PCBM or P3HT:ICxA. Charge-transfer (CT) state generation (exciton dissociation) is assumed to linearly relate to fluorescence quenching allowing us to calculate the CT state generation yield. The CT state generation yield of P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICxA are very similar, while P3HT:ICBA is 25% more effective at generating CT states. Considering that ICBA remains miscible in P3HT after annealing while PCBM phase segregates,27,28 the average domain size in the P3HT:PCBM film is likely to be larger than that of the P3HT:ICBA film. Since fluorescence quenching in P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:PCBM is almost the same, P3HT:ICxA is expected to have a similar domain size to P3HT:PCBM.

To understand the charge transport behaviour in OPV devices prepared from the various fullerene acceptors, the charge mobility was determined using photo-CELIV. The illumination was provided by a high power white LED, with the intensity dependence of the CELIV transients controlled by varying the drive power to the LED. Current transients obtained for devices prepared with blends of P3HT and each of the fullerene acceptors are shown in Fig. 6A. The extracted photocurrent density peaks for the ICxA and ICBA devices are higher than the peak for the PCBM device, consistent with a higher density of photogenerated charges creating the elevated VOC values observed for the indene-adduct devices. The mobility values were determined using the peak current time, extracted photocurrent value and the capacitive current value as reported in previous literature.29 Mobility values computed at a range of light intensities, which were subsequently converted to a carrier density by integrating the area under the extracted photocurrent peak and subtracting the capacitive current values, are shown for each device in Fig. 6B. The mobility values exhibited a weak dependence on the carrier density and thus, for comparative purposes, the mobility at a carrier density equal to AM1.5 1 sun illumination was compared (Table 4). The P3HT:PCBM mobility was the highest, with a value of 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while both the P3HT:ICxA and P3HT:ICBA devices showed a lower charge carrier mobility of 0.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Since the photoCELIV technique typically measures the faster electron mobility, these values indicate that the indene-adduct acceptors experience slower charge transport. As the P3HT:ICxA device has some higher tris-adducts present, this result is consistent with previous reports suggesting that higher adducts of fullerene acceptors increase the energetic disorder and decrease the transport properties of devices.30

Lindqvist et al.31 have previously shown that the thermal stability of a polymer:fullerene film can be investigated by monitoring the degree of fullerene crystallisation with increasing temperature via an increase in light scattering at 900 nm, a region where the polymer and fullerene do not have significant light absorption. Fig. 7 shows that both P3HT:ICBA and P3HT:ICxA devices exhibit excellent thermal stability at temperatures up to 200 °C, whereas P3HT:PCBM is not thermally stable above 140 °C as the Tg of the blend is exceeded. The higher thermal stability of the indene-adduct fullerenes is likely due to their higher miscibility with P3HT, whereas for P3HT:PCBM blends aggregation is observed upon annealing due to expulsion of the less miscible PCBM from mixed P3HT:PCBM regions.28,32

These results demonstrate that the much lower cost ICxA material can be used as a direct substitute for PCBM in OPV devices. In addition, it has been demonstrated that P3HT:indene-C60 adduct blends exhibit stability against phase segregation,27 which is required for the long-term operation of R2R manufactured modules.
To demonstrate the utility of this new material in large scale device fabrication, fully roll-to-roll fabricated OPVs with a structure of PET/Aggrid/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ICxA/AZO/Al were manufactured. Each cell had an active area of 4.0 cm2. As shown in Fig. 8, the unoptimized device had a VOC of 0.60 V, JSC of 4.93 mA cm−2, FF of 0.39, and PCE of 1.14% under AM1.5 illumination.

For a C60 cost of $18 g−1, an indene cost of $0.15 g−1 and an average solvent cost of less than $6 L−1, the total materials cost of producing ICxA is ∼$17 g−1. The majority of this cost is C60, while the conversion and purification to ICxA is less than $1 g−1. The total cost can be further lowered to ∼$15 g−1 when unreacted C60 is recovered during the filtration step. Additional costs such as electricity and labor are very low, with the cost of power for the reflux at $0.07 g−1 of ICxA and the actual hands-on time input for reaction setup, purification and clean-up totals less than 1 minute per gram of ICxA produced. Since there is minimal solvent use and no chromatographic purification, ICxA is significantly cheaper than either commercially available PCBM or ICBA, and requires only basic laboratory glassware to produce commercial scale quantities of acceptor material. Previous work has shown that if current material costs can be reduced substantially then OPV is a viable alternative to conventional electricity generation.12 As such, the development of the low-cost indene-C60 acceptor material presented here represents a significant step towards the realisation of commercially viable OPV module production.
Conclusions
The ICxA acceptor provides a cost effective alternative to PCBM or ICBA, in both small scale and R2R printed devices, with similar power conversion efficiency. As such, this low-cost acceptor should encourage the commercialisation of OPV as well as significantly lowering the cost barrier for research groups wanting to make the transition to roll-to-roll printing.
Experimental
Synthesis of ICxA
C60 fullerene (99.5%) was purchased from BuckyUSA. Indene (96%) was purchased from Shandong Aoertong Chemical Co. Ltd., China. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (98% synthesis grade) was purchased from Merck Millipore, Australia. Chloroform (AR grade) and methanol (AR grade) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia. All reagents and solvents were used as received with no further purification.
C60 fullerene (120 g, 0.167 mol), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (2.088 L) and indene (38.80 g, 0.334 mol) were heated at reflux for 48 hours, cooled, and precipitated by addition to 10 L of MeOH. The crude reaction mixture was filtered through a porosity 3 fritted glass funnel and collected as a brown solid. The solid was then stirred for 1 hour in 1600 mL of CHCl3 to extract the soluble ICxA, and then filtered through a fritted glass funnel to separate insoluble material. The extraction was repeated on the collected solid a further four times using volumes of 800 mL, 250 mL, 150 mL and 100 mL, at which point the collected solid (C60 containing trace amounts of ICxA) was dried and saved for reuse in subsequent reactions. The pooled filtrate was precipitated in 5 L of MeOH and the ICxA was collected by filtration as a brown powder. The powder was air dried overnight, with a final drying step in an oven at 70 °C until stable mass was achieved (approx. 2 hours).
Yield of ICxA: 132 g (85.11%, the sum of the yields of each adduct based on an average ICMA:ICBA:ICTA ratio of 36:52:12). Recovered C60: 15 g.
Chromatography of ICxA
Column chromatography of the ICxA mixture for determination of the ratio of components was performed using a silica gel stationary phase with fractions eluted using hexanes:toluene 7:1. The first fraction to elute was ICMA with an Rf of 0.44 (silica plates, hexanes:toluene 7:1), the second fraction was ICBA with an Rf of 0.30 and the third fraction was ICTA with an Rf of 0.16. No adducts higher than the tris-adduct were observed. When large chromatography columns (125 mm diameter) where used to separate larger quantities of ICxA into pure fractions, there was a faint pink band observed as the first fraction to elute which was attributed to a small amount of C60, however the evaporated fraction was of insufficient mass to weigh and was calculated (based on the solubility of C60 and the volume of chloroform extraction solvent) to be no more than 0.5% of the total mass of ICxA.
Materials for OPV devices
Chloroform (Chromasolv for HPLC 99.8%), chlorobenzene (Chromasolv for HPLC 99.9%) and Zonyl FSO fluorosurfactant were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia, and used as supplied. 2-Propanol and DMSO were purchased from Thermo Fisher, Australia. PCBM (99.5%) and ICBA (99%) were purchased from Solenne BV, Netherlands, and stored under nitrogen. P3HT was synthesised at the Centre for Organic Electronics, University of Newcastle, Australia, with an Mn of 22.7 Kg mol−1, Mw of 32.6 kg mol−1, and PDI of 1.44. PEDOT:PSS was purchased from Heraeus, Germany, as Clevios P VP AI 4083 for lab-scale devices or Clevios PH 1000 for R2R devices. Patterned ITO slides (<15 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Xinyan Technology Ltd., China. PET substrate (75 μm thick × 300 mm wide × 500 m long) was purchased from Multapex, Australia. Silver ink was purchased from PChem Associates, United States, as PFI-722 and used as received.
Fabrication of lab-scale OPV devices
Patterned ITO (thickness ∼ 125 nm) slides were cleaned via sonication in detergent, hexane, acetone and finally isopropyl alcohol. A layer of PEDOT:PSS of approximately 35 nm thickness was deposited by spin coating and annealed for 30 min at 140 °C. Solutions of P3HT:fullerene (1:0.8 by weight) were prepared in chloroform solutions and spin coated in a nitrogen glovebox to give an active layer of 90–100 nm thickness which was dried at 60 °C for 5 min. The substrates were then transferred to a vacuum deposition chamber (base pressure ∼ 10−7 mbar) whereupon 30 nm of calcium and a 100 nm thick aluminium cathode was thermally deposited. The active area of each device was 5 mm2.
Fabrication of R2R devices
Devices were fabricated using a Grafisk Maskinfabrik Solar-1 Coater consisting of an unwinder, web guide, flexo/gravure station, slot die coating station, two inline ovens, and a rewinder. Silver ink was R2R printed on to untreated PET using a patterned photopolymer flexo plate and 1.5 cm3 m−2 anilox roller. The conductive silver grid pattern was printed at 20 m min−1 and annealed in an inline oven (2 m in length) at 140 °C at a speed of 2 m min−1 for a dry thickness of approximately 200 nm. PEDOT:PSS ink was prepared (by volume: 75% Heraeus Clevios PH 1000 PEDOT:PSS, 20% 2-propanol, 4.9% DMSO, and 0.1% Zonyl FSO) and coated over the patterned silver using slot-die with patterned deckling at 1 m min−1 and dried at 140 °C to a thickness of approximately 200 nm. Active layer ink (P3HT:ICxA) was prepared at a concentration of 10:12.5 mg mL−1 in 90:10 chlorobenzene:chloroform and coated using slot-die with patterned deckling at a speed of 1.5 m min−1 and dried at 140 °C to a thickness of approximately 200 nm. Aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) was prepared following a published procedure33 and coated onto the active layer using slot-die at a speed of 1.0 m min−1, and then further annealed at 140 °C for 10 min to a thickness of approximately 50 nm. Sputter coating of aluminum cathodes was performed using custom-built R2R equipment purchased from Semicore Equipment, Inc. The sputtering chamber was evacuated to a high vacuum base pressure (10−6 mTorr) and then sputtering was performed in an argon plasma created using a direct current (DC) magnetron with power supplied to the 35.6 × 10.1 cm aluminium target (Angstrom Sciences, Inc.) using 6 kW Pinnacle DC power sources (Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.). Sputtered cathodes were prepared using a web speed of 15.7 cm min−1 at a sputtering base pressure of 5 × 10−6 mTorr, a process pressure of 2 mTorr, and a target power of 1.5 kW (power density = 4.15 W cm−2) and sputtered to a thickness of 100 nm through a shadow mask which was laser-cut from PET. The OPV was then encapsulated between glass microscope slides using Dymax Ultra Light-Weld 3220-GEL-SC UV-cured adhesive and annealed on a hotplate at 140 °C for between 2 and 10 min until maximum efficiency was achieved.
Characterisation of OPV devices
Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using a Newport Class A solar simulator with an AM 1.5 spectrum filter. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a silicon reference solar cell (FHG-ISE). J–V data were recorded under illumination using a Keithley 2400 source meter. PCEaverage, VOC, JSC and FF are presented as the average of 6 devices and the errors calculated as ± one standard deviation. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were recorded by illuminating the OPV devices with a tungsten halogen lamp passed through an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator. An Ithaco Dynatrac 395 analogue lock-in amplifier and Thorlabs PDA55 silicon diode were employed to collect the reference signal, and a Stanford Research Systems SR830 DSP digitizing lock-in amplifier was employed to measure the device current.
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 6000i UV-vis spectrophotometer from thin films (∼100 nm) on quartz slides or from THF solutions in quartz cuvettes. Spectra were typically recorded from 200–800 nm.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of BHJ films annealed at 140 °C for 4 min were collected using an Asylum Research Cypher AFM in AC mode.
Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer on P3HT, PCBM, ICBA, ICxA, P3HT:PCBM, P3HT:ICBA and P3HT:ICxA films which were spin cast on quartz glass substrates and annealed for 4 min at 140 °C.
Photo-CELIV measurements were performed using the commercially available PAIOS 2 system (Fluxim AG). A light pulse from a white LED (Cree, xp-g) was used to generate charges whilst a compensating offset voltage held the device at open circuit. The end of the light pulse was simultaneous with the application of a linearly increasing voltage (0.13 V μs−1) to extract photogenerated charges. The current transients were recorded by the integrated PAIOS system. The time resolution of the LED pulse rise was 100 ns, and the calculated RC constant of the devices and measurement system was ≈200 ns.
The effect of temperature on the morphological stability of active layer films was studied using the method of Lindqvist et al.31 Active layer films were spin-coated from a chloroform solution on to quartz substrates at a thickness of approximately 100 nm and air-dried in darkness for 18 hours. UV-visible transmission measurements were conducted using a Varian Cary 6000i over a scan range of 200–1000 nm. Films were annealed for 5 min at 10 °C increments from 40 °C to 200 °C. Fullerene aggregation was monitored by measuring the amount of light scattering as a change in transmittance at 900 nm.
