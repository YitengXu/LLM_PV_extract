The photoanodes with such stacking structures exhibit enhanced photocurrent responses under simulated solar light irradiation. Compared with the photoanodes without graphene, the photoanodes integrated with graphene could greatly enhance the photocurrent generation. Though the thickness of the multilayer films in our experiment is on the nanometer scale, a considerable photoelectric conversion efficiency has been obtained by employing such a stacking structure for the photoelectrochemical solar cell. The stacking structure synchronously taking advantage of the conductive property of graphene and the visible light-harvesting ability of quantum dots will enlighten the fabrication of novel energy conversion devices.IntroductionAs a rising star in material science, graphene has spurred enormous research interest due to its excellent electron conductivity and mobility.1–3 More excitingly, graphene can be derived from the reduction of a kind of charge-bearing nanosheet, graphene oxide, which could be obtained by the exfoliation of natural graphite.4,5 Based on the graphene oxide as a basic building block, it is possible to tailor complicated structures with graphene for potential applications in diverse areas, such as energy conversion and storage,6–9 catalysis,10,11 biochemical sensing and drug delivery.12–14 For dye-sensitized solar cells and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells, graphene has been introduced into the photoanodes or the counter electrodes to improve the cell performance.8,15,16 As for the organic photovoltaic devices, graphene is usually used either as the transparent conducting film electrodes for replacement materials of ITO,17–20 or as the electron-accepter materials.18,21,22Titania nanosheets, another kind of charged two-dimensional nanosheets, could be obtained by the delamination of layered host materials.23,24 The exfoliated nanosheet exhibits intriguing physicochemical properties such as high 2D anisotropy, quantum confinement effect.25,26 The unique properties and advantages have triggered a tremendous interest in fabricating nanosheet multilayer films which hold great promise for applications in various aspects such as solar cells, photocatalysts.Based on the negatively charged graphene oxide and titania nanosheets, it is possible to design composite films synchronously fulfilling the unique physicochemical properties of the two building units. Loh and co-workers have demonstrated ultrafast photocatalytic electron transfer between the titania and graphene in the multilayer films of titania nanosheets and graphene and the multilayer films showed efficient photocurrent conversion.27 Yu et al. used multilayer films of titania nanosheets and graphene to fabricate photoconductive patterns, and the fabricated patterns exhibit a high photocurrent generation and good reversibility.28 Recently, our group fabricated the granum-like stacking structures with titania and graphene nanosheets by a LBL assembly technique.29 The stacked structure is analogous to the granum, the core organ in photosynthesis, which consists of a stack of 10–100 thylakoids containing pigments and electrons acceptors. In the stacked structure, titania nanosheets act as the antenna pigment to harvest light and excite the electrons, while graphene nanosheets perform as the electron accepter to capture electrons and transport them out of the circuit. However, titania nanosheets with a wide bandgap can only absorb UV light and no obvious photocurrent response could be observed under visible light irradiation. Moreover, due to the aqueous suspension used in the fabrication process, it is impossible to sensitize the titania nanosheets–graphene composite films with organic dyes which are easily desorbed from the substrate in the aqueous solution. These factors, as a result, greatly hinder practical applications of such stacking structures in photovoltaic devices. As another kind of visible sensitizers, quantum dots (QD) could be introduced into the composite films during the fabrication process through a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method in aqueous solution. Quantum dots, such as CdS, CdSe, PbS QDs, could efficiently harvest light in the visible region of the solar spectrum due to their unique features including size-dependent optical absorption spectra, large extinction coefficients, and extended photostability, which have been utilized as sensitizer for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs).30–36 In this case, we fabricated a CdS quantum dot-decorated stacking structure of titania and graphene nanosheets. The stacking structure synchronously takes advantage of the conductive property of graphene and the visible light-harvesting ability of quantum dots. As a result, such a stacking structure exhibits an improved electron separation efficiency for photocurrent generation. The evolution of the stacking structure from concept to application bestows a new strategy for developing novel photovoltaic devices with higher efficiency.Experimental sectionFabrication of multilayer filmsAll the reagents used were of analytical grade without further purification. Titania nanosheet suspension were prepared according to the reported method.15 Graphene oxide was synthesized from flake graphite by a modified Hummers method.4,5,37 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Fig. S1† indicates the two-dimensional morphology of the as-synthesized materials. The substrates, fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO, 1.5 cm × 3 cm in size), were cleaned by ultrasonication in water, acetone, ethanol for 15 min, respectively. Then the substrates were further treated in a mixture of H2SO4–H2O2 (7:3 in volume ratio) for 30 min and washed thoroughly with distilled water.The assembly of titania nanosheets (TNS) and graphene oxide (GO) were carried out according to the reported methods.21,38 The decoration of CdS QDs after one cycle deposition of titania nanosheets and graphene oxide was carried out by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.39,40 The nanosheet coated substrate was successively immersed into a 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 aqueous solution, distilled H2O, 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution, and H2O again, each for 1 minute, which is one SILAR cycle. Different SILAR cycles were applied to the samples before they were dried under N2 flow. In order to study the effect of CdS concentration on the photovoltaic performance of the anodes, we measured photocurrent response of the electrodes based on different deposition cycles for a single layer of CdS quantum dots and the results were shown in the ESI (Fig. S2†). The results indicate that the photocurrent is enhanced with increasing the deposition cycles for depositing CdS quantum dots when one quantum dot layer is assembled from no more than 5 deposition cycles. When the deposition cycles for one quantum dot layer is more than 5 (e.g., 7 cycles), the surface of the whole film would be not homogeneous due to the aggregation of the quantum dot and the deterioration of the whole film resulted from the desorption of the deposited quantum dots, which would make it difficult to obtain the stable photocurrent data under on–off illumination. So 5 cycles are selected for depositing one layer quantum dot in our experiment.Finally, GO in the fabricated multilayer films was transformed into graphene (G) by reduction with hydrazine evaporation and annealing at 400 °C under N2 atmosphere to obtained (TNS/G/QD)n multilayer films. For comparison, multilayer films without graphene (TNS/QD)n or CdS QDs (TNS/G)n were also fabricated by the similar methods.CharacterizationsUV-vis absorption spectra of multilayer films were recorded by a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out with a three-electrode configuration by an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660D, Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai) under a simulated solar light (a 300 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5 filter) at room temperature. The illumination area was 1 cm2 and the intensity near the electrode surface was adjusted to a 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2) with a standard Si solar cell. A polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S, 0.1 M S, and 0.1 M NaOH solution in Milli-Q water) was used for all the photochemical experiments. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) values were obtained from the short circuit photocurrents under monochromatic light controlled by a series of light filters with different wavelengths.30 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on the electrochemical analyzer in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with illumination of 100 mW cm−2.Results and discussionCdS quantum dot-decorated titania/graphene nanosheets stacking structures were assembled on FTO substrates via an electrostatic layer-by-layer technique. The consecutive build up of the multilayer films was monitored by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As can be seen from the spectra of (TNS/G/QD)n (n = 5, 10, 15, 20) (Fig. S3, see ESI†), the absorbance did not increased monotonously with the number of deposition cycles. Especially when the deposition cycles are more than 10, there is not any obvious increase of the absorbance in the visible range.We also carried out the measurement of the photocurrent responses for (TNS/G/QD)n (n = 5, 10, 15, 20) and the results are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† It can be seen that the photocurrent response behaviors exhibit the similar variation trend as that of the UV-vis absorption spectra. The 10-layer film electrode shows the best photocurrent performance under the simulated solar light. In order to get more information on photovoltaic performance of the multilayer films, the 10-layer film electrode was selected for the successive measurements.Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of (TNS/G)10, (TNS/QD)10, (TNS/G/QD)10 multilayer films on FTO substrates. The absorption band centred at 405 nm is assigned to CdS QDs. Compared with the absorption spectrum of (TNS/QD)10, the absorption intensity of CdS QDs decrease for the (TNS/G/QD)10 multilayer film. We also measured the UV-vis spectrum of (G/QD)10 film (Fig. S5, see the ESI†). It can be found that the absorption intensity of CdS QDs in both (G/QD)10 film and (TNS/G/QD)10 film is smaller than those in (TNS/QD)10 film. Our findings are consistent with the results reported by Li and co-workers showing that the absorption intensity of CdS QDs grown on TiOx-coated graphene is 20% bigger than those on graphene surface.41 The desorption of CdS QDs during the reduction of graphene oxide into graphene in hydrazine evaporation may account for the smaller absorption intensity of QDs in (G/QD)10 and (TNS/G/QD)10 films. Fig. 1  UV-vis spectra of (TNS/G/QD)10, (TNS/QD)10, (TNS/G)10 multilayer films on FTO-coated glass. All the measurements were carried out based on the blank FTO-coated glass as the reference. Photovoltaic behaviors of CdS QDs decorated graphene/titania nanosheets were carried out in a polysulfide electrolyte using a standard three-electrode configuration. The photoanode based on the quantum dot-decorated stacking structure was used as the working electrode, a platinum wire and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Fig. 2a gives the photocurrent response of (TNS/QD)10, (TNS/G/QD)10 electrodes upon on–off cycles of illumination. A fast and uniform photocurrent response is observed upon switch-on. It has been reported in our preceding work that TNS-based multilayer films exhibit weak photocurrent response with I2/I− as the electrolyte under UV light irradiation.29 Herein, for comparison, we also measured the photocurrent response of (TNS)10 and (TNS/G)10 with a polysulfide as the electrolyte. The photocurrent curves shown in Fig. S6 (see the ESI†) indicated that both the two electrode exhibit negligible response under simulated solar light, and the electrode containing graphene shows enhanced photocurrent response due to the electron-highway role of graphene, which is consistent with the results obtained with I2/I− as the electrolyte. However, the integration of QDs into the TNS multilayer films could greatly improve the photocurrent response under the simulated solar light. As can be seen from the photocurrent curves shown in Fig. 2a, (TNS/QD)10 anode generates a photocurrent 0.75 mA cm−2. When the multilayer films are further integrated with graphene, the photocurrent could be obviously enhanced. As shown in Fig. 2, the (TNS/G/QD)10 could produce a stable photocurrent of 0.9 mA cm−2. The enhanced photocurrent of the multilayer film with graphene is indicative of improved charge separation in the multilayer film. It has been reported by Sasaki et al. that the conduction band of TNS is −0.41 V vs. NHE, which is more positive than that of CdS (−0.52 V vs. NHE).42,43 As a result, the injection of electron from excited QDs into conduction band of TNS is facilitated, leading to an enhanced photocurrent response under visible light irradiation. Fig. 2  (a) Photocurrent response of (TNS/QD)10, (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanodes upon on–off cycles of illumination with a simulated solar light. (b) J–V characteristics of (TNS/QD)10, (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanodes under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2 Xe lamp) in a polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S, 0.1 M S, and 0.1 M NaOH solution in Milli-Q water). Fig. 2b presents J–V curves of (TNS/QD)10 and (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanodes under a xenon light illumination (100 mW cm−2). A current density of 0.92 mA cm−2 was obtained for (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanode, which is higher than that obtained with (TNS/QD)10 photoanode. The open circuit voltage for both electrodes (with and without graphene) were similar, 1.00 V and 1.03 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The associated fill-factor for (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanode (0.41) is greater than that for (TNS/QD)10 photoanode (0.36). As a result, the calculated photoelectric conversion efficiency for the two photoanodes are 0.29% and 0.38%, respectively. It is worthy to be noted that the thickness of the multilayer films in the photoanodes is within tens of nanometers, especially for the TiO2 layer, far less than that of TiO2 layer (∼10 μm) in the photoanodes for common quantum dot-sensitized solar cells. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to consider that a higher conversion efficiency could be obtained with this novel stacking structure if the TiO2 layer was designed with an optimum thickness.Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for (TNS/G/QD)10 and (TNS/QD)10 photoanodes are presented in Fig. 3. (TNS/QD)10 photoanode shows a relative lower IPCE in the full spectral range analyzed. With graphene incorporation, (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanode shows a substantially increased IPCE with a maximal value of 20% at a wavelength of 400 nm. IPCE is greatly depended on the charge collection at the collecting electrode. The conducting graphene could capture and shuttle electrons quickly. The incorporation of graphene into the multilayer films provides two pathways for the photogenerated electrons to be transported to the collecting electrode. One is the direct approach for the electrons from the QD excited state to the collecting electrode, which could greatly suppress the internal charge recombination within the QD. The other way is the 2D graphene bridge facilitating the electrons injected into the conduction band of TNS to be transferred to FTO substrate, thus greatly suppresses the recombination from TNS to the electrolyte. As a result, (TNS/G/QD)10 electrode exhibits an enhanced IPCE compared with (TNS/QD)10 electrode. Fig. 3  IPCE spectra for the multilayer films of (TNS/G/QD)10 and (TNS/QD)10 photoanodes. All IPCE values are calculated from the short circuit photocurrents under monochromatic light controlled by a series of light filters with different wavelengths. Short-circuit photocurrent densities of (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanode under different irradiation intensities were also measured to further demonstrate the photovoltaic behavior of the composite photoanode. As depicted in Fig. 4a, the short-circuit photocurrent density of (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanode increases monotonously with the incident light intensity. The linear relationship between Jsc and incident light intensity indicates that the photoelectron generation process is only controlled by the photon absorption and electron injection steps.44,45 As a result, the combination of titania oxide, graphene and CdS QDs would not only improve light harvesting but also accelerate the electron injection from QDs into TNS due to the graphene layer suppressing the recombination by the QD surface states. The photovoltaic parameters of (TNS/G/QD)10 under different incident light intensity are summarized in Table S1, see the ESI.† It can be seen from the table that both the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current increase with increasing irradiation intensity. As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency increases with enhancing light intensity (Fig. 4b). The conversion efficiency increases from 0.03% to 0.89% when the irradiation intensity changes from 10 mW cm−2 to 300 mW cm−2. It should be noted that our findings in intensity-dependent efficiency-values is different from the decreasing power conversion efficiency with increasing excitation intensity observed by Kuno and co-workers.46 We attribute this unique property to the conductive path of graphene inhibiting the shunt opening at high irradiation intensities. Fig. 4  Short-circuit photocurrent (a) and photoelectric conversion efficiency (b) as a function of incident light intensity for (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured under the illumination of one sun at open-circuit potential to scrutinize the electron transport in the multilayer films. Fig. 5 shows EIS spectra of (TNS/QD)10 and (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanodes. The impedance attributed to the electron transfer in the stacking structure is presented by the biggest semicircle at intermediate frequency regime.47–49 Obviously, the biggest semicircle at medium frequency for (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanode is smaller than that of (TNS/QD)10 photoanode, indicating the fast redox activity of the electrolyte at the collecting electrode interface. Z-View software has been used to fit the Nyquist plots to estimate the charge transfer resistance (R2) at the working electrode interface and the equivalent circuit of the devices is shown in inset of Fig. 5(a). The fitting results indicate that the photoanode without graphene exhibits a bigger R2 (392.4 ohm) than that of the photoanode integrated with graphene (296 ohm), denoting the much superior charge transport characteristics in the photoanode containing graphene. These results can also be further confirmed by the corresponding Bode phase plots of QDSCs in Fig. 5b. Compared with (TNS/QD)10 photoanode, the characteristic frequency for (TNS/G/QD)10 shown in Bode phase plots is shifted to a lower frequency, suggesting the electron lifetime is lengthened.47,50–52 EIS results indicate that graphene in the multilayer films is beneficial for the electron collecting at the working electrode, which is consistent with the IPCE analysis. Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra of different electrodes. Inset of (a) shows the equivalent circuit of the device. The spectra were measured under the illumination of one sun at open-circuit potential. Fig. 6a demonstrates the charge carrier generation and transfer processes occurring in the (TNS/QD)10 photoanode. As mentioned above, the conducting band energy of CdS (−0.52 V vs. NHE) is more negative than that of TNS (−0.41 V vs. NHE), facilitating the electron injection from the excited QD into TNS. Upon illumination, the electrons in the valence band of CdS QDs are excited into the conduction band. Then the excited electrons are directly injected into the conduction band of TNS or through the QD surface states with a much slower injection process, while holes are captured by the electrolyte. At the same time, recombination losses arise from three pathways: from the conduction band of TNS to the electrolyte, from the QD (CB or surface states) to the electrolyte, and internal recombination within the QD.53 In the (TNS/QD)10 electrode (Fig. 6a), the electrons in the excited QDs should be injected into TNS in order to be flowed into the external circuit. While the charge transported in TiO2 occurs via electron hopping between the trap-sites, so the electrons tend to be trapped by the trap states (bandgap and surface states).54,55 The trap state-assisted recombination as well as other three recombination pathways mentioned above might greatly restrain the charge separation, resulting in a poor photocurrent response. Fig. 6  Schematic diagram of electrode and the energy band diagram of a typical embodiment of the photoelectrochemical cell based on (TNS/QD)10 electrode (a) and (TNS/G/QD)10 electrode (b), showing the photogenerated electrons transportation in (TNS/QD)10 electrode. As for the (TNS/G/QD)10 electrode, two paths for photogenerated electrons to be collected by the electrode. One is the direct approach from exited QDs to the conducting substrate (Path I). The other is quickly injection from exited QDs into conduction band of TNS and is captured by FTO with the assistance of graphene bridge (Path II). As for (TNS/G/QD)10 electrode (Fig. 6b), there is a new path for electrons from excited QDs to be transported to FTO directly with the assistance of graphene bridge. Meanwhile, the electrons injected into the conduction band of TNS would be quickly collected by the graphene and transported into the external circuit. Meanwhile, the holes move toward the electrolyte and captured by the electrolyte. The introduction of graphene provides two different paths for photogenerated electrons to be collected by the electrode. One is the direct approach for electrons from excited QDs to be shuttled to the conducting substrate through graphene, greatly suppressing the back transport of electrons from the QD to the electrolyte and the recombination within the QD. The other path facilitates the injected electrons in the conducting band of TNS to be scavenged by FTO through the conducting bridge of graphene. The existence of graphene also provides a highway for hole transport to the electrolyte, facilitating the hole capture rate and greatly suppressing electron–hole recombination. As a result, the photoanode incorporated with graphene exhibits an improved charge separation and enhanced photocurrent response.ConclusionsIn summary, CdS quantum dot-decorated stacking structures of graphene and titania nanosheets have been fabricated through a layer-by-layer method combined with a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. CdS quantum dots serving as the light harvesting antenna could greatly enhance the photocurrent response within the visible light region. Compared with the multilayer film without graphene, (TNS/G/QD)10 multilayer film shows an enhanced photocurrent response due to the incorporation of graphene, which facilitates the charge separation and suppresses recombination losses in the multilayer films. Though the thickness of the multilayer films in our experiment is within nanometer scale, a considerable photoelectric conversion efficiency has been obtained by employing such a stacking structure for the photoelectrochemical solar cell. So it is reasonable to expect highly efficient solar cells based on such stacking structure if the thickness of the multilayer films could be optimized. Our strategy of constructing stacking structure by biomimicking the granum of the photosynthetic organism provides enlightenment and inspiration for further design of novel photoelectrochemical solar cells.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by NSFC (21073009), Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (30400002011127001) and National Basic Research Program (2011CB935704, 2012CB720904) continuing financial support.Notes and referencesY.

 	Fig. 1  UV-vis spectra of (TNS/G/QD)10, (TNS/QD)10, (TNS/G)10 multilayer films on FTO-coated glass. All the measurements were carried out based on the blank FTO-coated glass as the reference.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Photocurrent response of (TNS/QD)10, (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanodes upon on–off cycles of illumination with a simulated solar light. (b) J–V characteristics of (TNS/QD)10, (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanodes under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2 Xe lamp) in a polysulfide electrolyte (1 M Na2S, 0.1 M S, and 0.1 M NaOH solution in Milli-Q water).	 

 	Fig. 3  IPCE spectra for the multilayer films of (TNS/G/QD)10 and (TNS/QD)10 photoanodes. All IPCE values are calculated from the short circuit photocurrents under monochromatic light controlled by a series of light filters with different wavelengths.	 

 	Fig. 4  Short-circuit photocurrent (a) and photoelectric conversion efficiency (b) as a function of incident light intensity for (TNS/G/QD)10 photoanode.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra of different electrodes. Inset of (a) shows the equivalent circuit of the device. The spectra were measured under the illumination of one sun at open-circuit potential.	 

 	Fig. 6  Schematic diagram of electrode and the energy band diagram of a typical embodiment of the photoelectrochemical cell based on (TNS/QD)10 electrode (a) and (TNS/G/QD)10 electrode (b), showing the photogenerated electrons transportation in (TNS/QD)10 electrode. As for the (TNS/G/QD)10 electrode, two paths for photogenerated electrons to be collected by the electrode. One is the direct approach from exited QDs to the conducting substrate (Path I). The other is quickly injection from exited QDs into conduction band of TNS and is captured by FTO with the assistance of graphene bridge (Path II).
