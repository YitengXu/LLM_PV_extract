    , Accepted 3rd April 2018First published on 4th April 2018AbstractA room-temperature solution-processed pillar[5]arene-based small molecule material, termed C3, has been designed, synthesized, and incorporated between a conventional PCBM electron transport layer (ETL) and a metal electrode to function as a single-layer cathode buffer layer (CBL) for efficient planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). It has been found that C3 has a work function tunneling effect, which can decrease the work function of the Ag electrode; therefore, introduction of C3 successfully enhances the interface contact and reduces the interface barriers, which usually exist between fullerene derivatives and metal electrodes. It was also found that the C3 capping layer could improve the surface quality of PCBM, forming a smooth, dense and pinhole-free morphology with fewer surface defects. Thus, C3 can modify the interface between PCBM and Ag, enhance the diode properties of devices and facilitate electron transport through the devices; therefore, it is a very promising CBL material for PVSCs. A device with a hybrid PCBM ETL and a single cathode buffer layer of C3 exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.42% with negligible hysteresis, which was dramatically higher than that of a device based on a pure PCBM ETL. With the major advantages of a low-temperature solution process and interface modification, the excellent PCE of PVSCs on flexible substrates can exceed 13%. These results demonstrate that solution-processed pillar[5]arene-based small molecule materials can serve as high performance CBLs in PVSCs.
Introduction
Photovoltaic solar cells have attracted significant attention from researchers for decades because clean, abundant and renewable solar energy is one of the most promising energy sources to meet the increasing energy demand and address environmental problems caused by the traditional fossil fuels. For the past several years, perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have seen significant improvements in efficiency, increasing from 3.8% in 20091 to greater than 22% in 2017;2 thus, perovskite is the fastest developing technology in the history of photovoltaics.3–7 Perovskite materials have the advantages of facile fabrication, long exciton-diffusion lengths, excellent charge carrier transport, and high absorption coefficients as well as tunable compositions and structures; this enables their application in multidisciplinary areas such as in photovoltaics, photo detectors, lasers, and light-emitting diodes.7–14 In view of the long exciton diffusion lengths and weak exciton binding energies (50–76 meV) of perovskite materials, inverted planar p–i–n solar cells have achieved high performance.15–18 The elimination of high-temperature-sintered scaffolds enables the low-temperature manufacture of planar p–i–n PVSCs. Furthermore, suppressed hysteresis of p–i–n PVSCs has been demonstrated due to the wider selection of potential interface transport materials to achieve a balanced charge carrier transport across the devices and due to the passivation effects of fullerene derivatives. Therefore, highly efficient, hysteresis-free, inverted planar p–i–n PVSCs simply processed at low temperatures are attracting increasing attention from researchers. In general, the regular device architecture of planar p–i–n CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) PVSCs consists of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO), a HTL, a perovskite layer, an electron transport layer (ETL) and a top metal electrode. Interface engineering by introducing interlayers between the electrode and active layer can enable tuning of the electrode work function, optimize the contact, enhance the carrier separation and collection efficiency and minimize carrier trapping or accumulation, all of which are key to enhancing solar cell performance.19,20 Therefore, interface materials are highly essential for manipulating charge carrier transport behavior and achieving high-performing PVSCs. For planar p–i–n PVSCs, the polymer materials poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and phenyl-C61-butyricacid methyl ester (PCBM) are the most widely used HTL and ETL, respectively. However, the commercially available PEDOT:PSS has a negative effect on device stability due to its acidity and hygroscopic properties. Moreover, the work function of the commonly used PEDOT:PSS (5.1 eV) is lower than the ionization potential of perovskite (e.g., 5.4 eV for CH3NH3PbI3); therefore, the potential energy loss at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface decreases the built-in potential of PVSCs. Thus, devices based on PEDOT:PSS HTLs usually output a lower open circuit voltage (VOC) because the VOC of the PVSCs is directly correlated with the work functions of these hole-selective contact materials.21
With respect to ETLs for planar p–i–n PVSCs, the adoption of PCBM has been very successful due to its suitable Fermi energy level, conductivity and, particularly, its electron extraction capabilities. However, it should be noted that an interface contact barrier usually exists between the Fermi levels of various electrode metals (such as Ag, Al, Au) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the polymer material (PCBM).22 Additionally, because the ETL determines the electron transport from the perovskite layer to the metal cathode, it is highly desirable to improve the uniformity of the PCBM ETL film to mitigate film defects, increase the electron mobility, and, consequently, prohibit electron–hole recombination at the interfaces or in the films. Also, fullerene derivatives can readily absorb moisture or oxygen in the air, which is detrimental to the stabilities of these derivatives and of the entire device. To address the above concerns regarding PVSCs, researchers introduced a cathode buffer layer (CBL) between the ETL and cathode to reduce the interface barrier, improve the ohmic contact, cover the ETL surface, enhance the charge transfer properties and improve performance.
Various types of materials have been utilized to function as interfacial functional layers for PVSCs. In the first half of 2013, Jun-Yuan Jeng et al. reported the use of a bathocuproine (BCP) film as a CBL for a heterojunction PVSC.15 In 2014, Jangwon Seo and co-workers fabricated a planar perovskite heterojunction device with an efficiency of 14.1% using a thin layer of LiF as a buffer layer.16 LiF insertion decreased the energy barrier due to the generation of a dipole moment across the interfaces.23 Low work function metals such as Ca and Ba can lower the work function of the electrode, which is beneficial for better PCBM/cathode ohmic contact.24 The abovementioned CBL materials are generally fabricated by vacuum evaporation, which is not compatible with roll-to-roll production. Thus, low-temperature solution-processed CBLs were developed and intensively studied to realize the simple and flexible preparation of PVSCs. Jen et al. demonstrated a fullerene surfactant, C60-bis, as a CBL for planar PVSCs. Using an additive doping strategy to optimize the perovskite morphologies, a PCE of 11.8% was verified in 2014.25 Fullerene derivatives such as DMAPA-C60, PCBC, and F-C60 have also been synthesized and used as CBLs to modulate the photovoltaic performance of devices.26–28 Other organic materials, including PN4N, PDINO, Bphen, TIPD, MUTAB and F-R-COOK, have been developed and proved to be alternative CBLs for p–i–n PVSCs.29–35 The corresponding obtained PCEs varied from 12.95% to 16.5%. Inorganic metal oxides, such as zinc oxide, titanium oxide (TiOx) and zirconium oxide, have also been deposited on top of ETLs to function as buffer layers.10,18,36,37 In addition to those reports, some studies have reported attempts to take full advantage of different materials by combining several materials to fabricate double hybrid CBLs. Double CBLs, such as C60/LiF, C60/BCP and PCBDANI/LiF, have demonstrated better performance than single interlayers due to their efficient charge extraction or suppression of trap-assisted recombination.38–40 Although we have seen tremendous improvements in cathode interfacial materials, most CBLs still require high vacuum evaporation equipment and complicated processing procedures or suffer from unsatisfactory performance, which may hinder the utilization of PVSCs in the future. Thus, simple solution-processed, low-cost and highly-efficient CBLs are highly essential to the development of PVSCs.
As a new generation of supramolecular macrocyclic hosts after crown ethers, cyclodextrins, calixarenes and cucurbiturils, and pillar[n]arenes, specifically pillar[5]arenes, have been vigorously developed because they can be conveniently synthesized from inexpensive starting materials and can be easily functionalized to achieve a wide range of applications.41–43 Pillar[n]arenes are a new class of macrocyclic compounds composed of n hydroquinone units held together by methylene bridges (–CH2–); they possess unique pillar-shaped architectures with well-defined hollow spaces. Functional supramolecular polymer systems based on pillar[n]arene derivatives emerged in 2008.44 However, to our best knowledge, pillar[n]arene-based supramolecules for photoelectric device fabrication have not yet been reported. Here, we predicted that a well-designed, low-cost, solution-processed pillar[5]arene-based small molecule containing trimethylammonium groups and bromide anions would be an optimal cathode buffer layer for fabricating highly efficient PVSCs. Also, to minimize open circuit voltage losses, a self-synthesized cross-linked monomer X1 dense thin film was employed instead of PEDOT:PSS as the HTL in our planar p–i–n PVSCs. PVSCs with the structure FTO/X1/MAPbI3/PCBM/C3/Ag were fabricated to investigate the impact of the interfacial layers on the performance of PVSCs. The best photovoltaic performance was achieved with the newly developed single interfacial layer, which delivered a power conversion efficiency of 17.42% with a VOC of 1.05 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 21.57 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.90%. The remarkable performance enhancement in contrast with that of the control devices (only 13.19%) without CBLs is due to the minimum contact barriers at the PCBM/Ag interface and the distinct enhancement of the charge extraction efficiency. Moreover, with the main advantages of the low-temperature solution process and optimized interface through incorporation of C3, our PVSCs based on flexible substrates can achieve an excellent efficiency of 13.27%.
Results and discussion
The methanol-soluble pillar[5]arene-based small molecule C3 was designed and synthesized according to the route described in Fig. 1. C3 was prepared by a facile process; three steps were involved in the synthesis method. A detailed description of the stepwise preparation of C3 can be found in the experimental details. The obtained molecule with ten tertiary amine groups per unit showed excellent solubility in some polar solvents, such as methanol; however, it is insoluble in nonpolar solvents, such as chlorobenzene, chloroform and dichlorobenzene, which are usually used as host solvents to fabricate polymer layers. Thus, the molecule is favorable for solution-processed fabrication without destroying the PCBM ETL.

To gain deeper insight into the molecular geometry of C3, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(D,P) level using the Gaussian09 program. The optimized molecular geometry of the C3 cation is shown in Fig. 2(a). Note that Br− anions are not presented in the figure for convenience. It can be seen that C3 has a pillared structure composed of five monomers linked with each other, which may be beneficial for electron transport due to their vertically aligned geometry. To verify the energy level position of C3, the electrochemical properties of C3 were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in methanol solution. As shown in Fig. 2(b), C3 exhibits quasi-reversible redox processes in the negative potential range. The LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) of C3 can be calculated from the onset reduction potentials (φred) in the cyclic voltammograms according to the equation ELUMO = −(4.8 + φred) (eV), where the standard energy level for Fc/Fc+ was taken to be 4.8 eV. The reduction potential φred of C3 is −1.11 eV, suggesting a LUMO energy level of −3.69 eV for C3. The UV-vis absorption spectra of C3 in methanol solution and as a film are presented in Fig. 2(c). C3 exhibits similar absorption profiles in methanol solution and as a film, and no obvious maximum absorption peak shift was observed. The optical bandgap (Eg) of C3 was calculated from the absorption onset wavelength of the C3 film, suggesting a wide bandgap of 3.65 eV for C3. The highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) was derived according to the equation:EHOMO = ELUMO + Eg (eV).

(c) Normalized absorption spectra of C3 in methanol solution and as a film. (d) Transmittance spectra of FTO and FTO/X1 substrates. The inset shows the chemical structure of X1. 
Thus, the HOMO energy level of C3 was determined to be −7.34 eV, which is sufficiently high to block hole transport. The low LUMO level and high HOMO level of C3 indicate that it can serve as an alternative CBL for PVSC applications from an energy level point of view. As discussed above, devices based on PEDOT:PSS HTLs generally generate lower open-circuit voltages; we used a wider band-gap semiconductor, X1, to substitute traditional HTL PEDOT:PSS. The detailed synthesis route and properties of our self-synthesized X1 will be published elsewhere. The X1 film was spin-casted from a DMF precursor solution and then cross-linked at 150 °C, forming a conformal and compact hole transport layer. As shown in Fig. 2(d), FTO/X1 substrates present high transparency in the visible range. The corresponding schematic molecule structure of X1 is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(d).

C3 film can be readily prepared from solution without additional annealing and will not destroy the PCBM layer; also, it possesses a low LUMO energy level, which may modify the contact between PCBM and the Ag cathode. Inspired by these properties, we fabricated planar p–i–n PVSCs with the insertion of C3 as a CBL. A schematic of the device structure is shown in Fig. 3(a), and the relative energy band alignment is illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Our PVSCs consisted of FTO-coated glass as the substrate, a solution-processed thin and compact X1 layer as the HTL, CH3NH3PbI3 as the absorber, PCBM as the ETL, C3 as the CBL and Ag as the top electrode. Perovskite films were deposited via a one-step solution method with anti-solvent dripping; the typical XRD pattern, absorption spectrum and morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film on FTO substrate are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 3(b), the light-induced carriers in the perovskite layers separated at the interfaces between perovskite/HTL and perovskite/ETL. Holes at the valance band maximum of perovskite transport to the HOMO level of X1 and then to the FTO anodes by the force of energy offset and the work function difference between the electrodes. Electrons transfer from the conduction band minimum of perovskite to the LUMO level of PCBM. Although the LUMO level of C3 appears to hinder electron transfer, a thin layer can allow tunneling of electrons from PCBM to the top Ag cathode, as indicated by the curved arrow in the sketch.

Encouraging results were obtained when we used our newly developed C3 as a CBL. To study the effects of C3 on the device performance, we fabricated PVSCs based on C3 CBLs with various thicknesses. The C3 thickness was simply varied by controlling the precursor concentration or the spin-casting speed. The corresponding typical J–V curves of the planar perovskite photovoltaic devices are shown in Fig. S2,† and the parameters are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† We observed that as we increased the C3 thickness, the device performance increased initially and then decreased. Precise control of the C3 thickness is necessary because thicker C3 layers may increase the series resistance or have rough surfaces, which can hinder carrier transfer or cause slight carrier recombination. A thin layer of C3 may not fully cover the PCBM surface. The optimized thickness of C3 was 10 nm. Fig. 4(a) shows the best-performing J–V curves of the planar p–i–n perovskite photovoltaic devices with and without (w/o) CBLs. After optimization, the PVSCs based on C3 CBLs yielded a PCE of 17.42%, with a Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 21.57 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.90%, when measured under reverse voltage scanning at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. In sharp contrast, devices without a CBL presented a poor performance of 13.19%, with a Voc of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 18.35 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.10%, when measured under reverse voltage scanning; this reveals greatly improved Jsc and FF for the C3 devices. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Note that our planar PVSCs presented no hysteresis when we changed the scan direction, and no PCE changes were observed with a varied scan speed from 0.05 V s−1 to 0.5 V s−1, as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† Table S2 in the ESI† summarizes the performance of planar p–i–n PVSCs utilizing various CBLs reported in the literature; our efficiency is among the highest efficiencies, especially for single layer CBLs. In contrast with double or triple CBLs, we have avoided using high vacuum evaporation of alkali metal salts, fullerenes or derivatives; thus, C3 is an alternative and promising CBL for high efficiency rigid and flexible PVSCs. Note that we also fabricated devices based on conventional PEDOT:PSS HTL, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† As discussed above, the HOMO level of X1 is higher than the work function of PEDOT:PSS; therefore, devices based on the X1 HTL output more photo-voltage due to their larger built-in electric fields. In order to verify the universality of C3, we also applied it in mixed-perovskite CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solar cells. Similar enhancements in device performance were also demonstrated, suggesting that C3 is a versatile CBL for PVSCs. The corresponding CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite film absorbance, morphologies and device J–V curves are displayed in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† Therefore, we can draw a conclusion that employing C3 as a CBL can significantly improve the performance of a device, particularly its FF and Jsc. In order to verify the repeatability of the results, we fabricated and measured 30 solar cells; the statistics of the PCEs of devices with or w/o CBLs are illustrated in the inset of Fig. 4(a). The dispersions of the PCEs clearly indicate that C3 CBL leads to a remarkable improvement in performance compared with the control devices. The average PCE results with standard deviation for the devices with CBLs are 16.40 ± 0.63%, outperforming the control devices, which have PCEs of 11.90 ± 0.80%.

Furthermore, to examine the photocurrent enhancement, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured and are presented in Fig. 4(b). The integrated current densities of devices with and w/o CBLs were 20.83 and 17.96 mA cm−2, respectively. The errors between integrated values and the measured values of the J–V tests are less than 4%, revealing the reliability and accuracy of the photocurrent. Devices based on C3 CBLs present high light response in the whole visible range, with an average value of more than 85%; this suggests that the insertion of the CBL enhances the extraction of photo-generated carriers from the perovskite-PCBM contact. To further confirm the device reliability of the fabricated PVSCs, the stabilized photocurrents measured at constant biases of 0.89 V and 0.87 V near the maximum power point for devices with and w/o C3 CBLs were examined and are presented in Fig. 4(c) and (d), respectively, showing steady-state PCEs of 16.50% and 12.11%.
We then investigated the mechanisms of the performance improvement after insertion of a C3 CBL. For planar p–i–n PVSCs, a typical problem is the poor contact formed between fullerene derivatives when conjugated directly with the metal back contact. Thus, we developed C3 to improve this contact and improve the charge transfer efficiency. We believe that the main reason that a cathode buffer layer can function as an efficient interface modification layer lies in its ability to produce a large dipole moment, which can lead to a vacuum-level shift and modify the work function (WF) of the electrode. To validate the prediction that C3 will decrease the WF of the electrode, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was utilized to elucidate the electronic properties of the C3 interlayers. Fig. 5(a) presents the results of UPS measurements on an Ag electrode with and without C3 modification. Helium Iα was used as the ultraviolet source. The wavelength of the ultraviolet source was 58.13 nm, and the energy was 21.22 eV. Thus, the work function was calculated by the equationWF = 21.22 − EB,where EB is the high binding energy cutoff. We can conclude that the pure Ag electrode has a WF of 4.40 eV. After deposition of a thin layer of C3 (10 nm), Ag/C3 showed a lower WF of 3.93 eV, suggesting the formation of dipole moments and a shift of the energy level for the C3-treated Ag cathode. An electrode with a lower WF can form good ohmic contacts with fullerene ETLs.

(c) Steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films based on different electrode contacts.

The solid lines of the J–V curves represent the best fit from the SCLC model. The inset shows the J1/2–V characteristics of the SCLC single-carrier mobility. 
Then, we studied the contact properties of our devices. As is known, dark current measurement is an effective method to evaluate the contact properties, recombination of free carriers and charge carrier loss through leakage pathways during operating conditions. For our p–i–n hetrojunction PVSCs, a Shockley diode model can be used to analyze the dark J–V curves: (1)

J
0 is the reverse saturation current density, K is Boltzmann's constant, A is the ideality factor, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge. The dark J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 5(b); they demonstrate typical diode behavior, with a leakage contribution at low voltages and an exponential regime at intermediate voltages, along with a transition to the space-charge-limited regime at the built-in voltage (Vbi). The ideality factor A can be independently determined from the slope of the exponential regime of the dark J–V characteristics on a semi-logarithmic plot and can be determined by the equation: (2)
The ideal factor A approaches unity in the ideal diode, whereas carrier recombination can change the ideality factor up to a value of 2. By analyzing the dark J–V curves, devices w/o a C3 CBL denote an ideal factor value of 2.93, whereas devices with a C3 CBL denote an ideal factor value of 1.83. The ideal factor A significantly decreased after C3 CBL insertion, suggesting reduced carrier recombination in the PVSCs and enhanced ohmic contact between PCBM and the top Ag cathode. According to eqn (1), we can conclude that the J0 of the devices without CBLs shows a large reverse saturation leakage current density of 4.54 × 10–5 mA cm−2. In sharp contrast, devices with C3 CBLs presented a J0 of 1.82 × 10–8 mA cm−2, suggesting that charge recombination was obviously suppressed after insertion of C3; this accounts for the FF improvement of the solar cells. Thus, we can conclude from the dark J–V curves that the C3 CBL eliminates the contact barrier between PCBM and the Ag cathode, thus enhancing the contact properties of PCBM and Ag, improving the hetrojunction quality and suppressing carrier recombination in the PVSCs; therefore, C3 is a promising alternative CBL for PVSCs.
To further understand the charge transfer behavior in our devices, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements of perovskite films with different contact conditions. All the perovskite samples had the same thickness and were prepared on FTO substrates with various anode contacts or cathode contacts. PL spectra can demonstrate the hole or electron extraction abilities of the tested films. As presented in Fig. 5(c), the pristine perovskite film showed a strong luminescence peak at 760 nm, suggesting severe recombination in the perovskite film or at the interface between perovskite and the electrode. When we introduced PEDOT:PSS HTL underneath the perovskite layer, the PL peak intensity clearly decayed, indicating that carrier recombination was suppressed at the interface or in the perovskite film. Furthermore, a slight decrease of PL the intensity occurred when X1 was utilized to substitute PEDOT:PSS. After deposition of the PCBM ETL on the perovskite film, the PL peak intensity further decayed. Remarkably, the sample showed an obvious decrease of PL peak intensity in the visible range after incorporation of C3 CBL. These results proved for the first time that X1 is superior to PEDOT:PSS for extracting holes. Moreover, they further confirmed that the hybrid PCBM ETL/C3 CBL is more efficient at reducing charge recombination and extracting charge carriers to the metal contact than the pure PCBM ETL, which accounts for the Jsc improvement. By using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, as shown in Fig. 5(d), we obtained the electron mobilities of the devices based on pure PCBM ETL and hybrid PCBM ETL/C3 CBL films. The electron mobility was extracted by fitting the J–V curves according to the modified Mott-Gurney equation: (3)
In this equation, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the permittivity of the active layer, μe is the electron mobility, and L is the thickness of the active layer. The results revealed that incorporation of the C3 CBL increases the electron mobility to 5.51 × 10–3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost twice that of the device based on the pure PCBM ETL (2.98 × 10–3 cm2 V−1 s−1).
As discussed above, C3 can decrease the WF of an electrode, enhance its contact properties and improve its charge transfer efficiency; we also wished to determine how C3 affects the morphologies of our devices. It is known that one of the major challenges to achieving high PV parameters in PVSCs is eliminating undesirable interfacial recombination, particularly at the ETL-perovskite and ETL-metal interfaces, which primarily occurs due to surface defects and the low mobility of materials such as PCBM. Therefore, the interface morphology plays an important role in determining device performance. Considering that surface defects in PCBM films will inevitably form during spin-casting or post-annealing of PCBM, we believe that utilizing a thin layer of C3 CBL can cover, remove or passivate surface defects of PCBM to form a uniform and pinhole-free electrode contact layer. Fig. 6(a) presents a cross-section scanning electron microscopy (c-SEM) image of our fabricated device, where we can observe each layer in the PVSC. We then examined the PCBM morphologies before and after deposition of a thin layer of C3 CBL. Fig. 6(b) displays the surface morphology of PCBM, revealing that the spun PCBM layer can conformably cover the perovskite surface with intimate contact. However, PCBM clusters will inevitably permeate into the perovskite layer along the grain boundaries as thermal annealing proceeds; thus, the PCBM surface is not as smooth as desired. We can directly observe PCBM grains in the SEM images, suggesting slight peaks and valleys in the PCBM surface. Meanwhile, after spin-casting a thin layer of C3 CBL on PCBM, this situation changed, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Some pinholes and valleys in the PCBM film were further filled by the thin layer of C3, forming a dense and smooth surface with enhanced regularity and enlarged PCBM grains or clusters. This conclusion was further supported by atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies. Fig. 6(d) and (e) show surface topographical images comparing the PCBM surfaces before and after C3 deposition or modification. For the pristine PCBM surface, the surface roughness values of the arithmetic average (Ra) and the root mean square (RMS) Rq were 2.04 and 2.64 nm, respectively, for the whole scanned area (Fig. 6(d)). After deposition of the C3 CBL, the Ra and Rq of the areas were 1.05 and 1.28 nm (Fig. 6(e)), respectively, which are both smaller than those of the pristine PCBM film. A smoother and denser surface will have fewer defects, which can form undesirable recombination centers for photo-induced carriers. These results demonstrated that the C3 CBL modified the PCBM surface and improved the film quality, forming a better interface between perovskite and the metal electrode or a superior cathode contact for PVSCs.

Long-term stability studies of PVSCs with and without C3 CBLs have been performed. For this experiment, un-encapsulated devices were stored in ambient air (temperature: 20 °C, humidity: 45%) and tested for 30 days. The long-term monitored PCE results and water contact angles of C3 and PCBM are shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI,† suggesting the potential of C3 to improve the stability of PVSCs. Considering that the C3 CBL can be processed with a facile solution method and that no additional high-temperature annealing is needed, we fabricated flexible PVSCs on ITO/PEN substrates. Note that the flexible ITO substrate was treated in UV-ozone for 30 min in order to increase the work function of the ITO film due to oxidation of the surface and also to remove organic residues and enhance the surface wetting of ITO/PEN. Fig. 7 shows the J–V curve of the best-performing flexible PVSC based on a C3 CBL, which delivered a PCE of 13.27% with a Voc of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 18.46 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.10% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. The lower Jsc and FF were attributed to the lower transmittance and higher resistance of the flexible substrates compared to the rigid FTO substrate. With the main advantages of a solution process, low temperature and interface modification effects for the C3 CBL, we have demonstrated acceptable photo-electrical performance with flexible substrates. We believe that our planar p–i–n PVSCs based on C3 CBLs have enormous potential for large-area roll-to-roll fabrication.

Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, a novel pillar[5]arene-based small molecule, C3, has been easily synthesized and implemented as an efficient alternative CBL for planar PVSCs. The C3 buffer layer is incorporated between a conventional PCBM ETL and a metal electrode. On one hand, C3 can produce dipole moments which can cause vacuum-level shifts and lower the work function of the metal electrode. Therefore, incorporation of C3 improves the contact and decreases the interface barriers between PCBM and the Ag electrode. On the other hand, C3 can modify the PCBM surface, forming a smooth, dense and pinhole-free morphology with fewer recombination centers. Enhanced heterojunction diode properties and electron mobility through the devices have been demonstrated. Thus, the introduction of C3 successfully and greatly enhances the device performance. We achieved a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 17.42% without any significant hysteresis under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar illumination for rigid PVSCs based on a single C3 CBL, which is much higher than that of a device without the C3 CBL. Moreover, the excellent efficiency of the PVSCs on flexible substrates could also exceed 13% due to the positive effects of the C3 CBL. Higher PCEs can be expected in the future after further improvements. Our results demonstrate that the pillar[5]arene-based small molecule C3 constitutes a promising route to obtain highly efficient planar p–i–n PVSCs. Our results also provide a route to the low-cost fabrication of PVSCs with high efficiency, which has great significance for the commercial application of PVSCs in photovoltaics.
Experimental section
Material and device characterization
All reagents were commercially available and were used as supplied without further purification. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China). The transmittance of the films was measured by a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (CARY5000, Varian) at RT. The crystal structure of the perovskite film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Conventional XRD in the Bragg–Brentano configuration was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance diffraction meter with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Line traces were collected over 2θ values ranging from 10° to 60°. The work function was calculated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) using a UPS system (Thermo Scientific, ESCLAB 250Xi, USA). UPS was carried out using helium Iα radiation from a discharge lamp operated at 90 W, a pass energy of 10 eV, and a channel width of 25 meV. A −9 V bias was applied to the samples to separate the samples and analyze their low-kinetic-energy cutoffs. The surface morphologies were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI XL-30). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was carried out using a JEOL JEM 2010 TEM. The morphologies of the perovskites, ETLs and CBLs were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, SPM-9500J 3, Shimadzu, Japan). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out under a 488 nm laser at RT, and the emissions were collected via a HORIBA Jobin–Yvon monochromator. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were obtained using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit, and the device tests were carried out under AM 1.5G illumination, 100 mW cm−2 (the light intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode) at RT using a solar simulator. The corresponding incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured with a QE/IPCE measurement system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd). SCLC measurements were conducted by fabricating devices with structures of FTO/SnO2/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag or FTO/SnO2/MAPbI3/PCBM/C3/Ag and then measuring the J–V curves of the devices using the Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit.
Synthesis of C3

Step 1: Carbon tetrabromide (39.8 g) was slowly added to an as-prepared solution of 1,4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)benzene (10.0 g) and triphenylphosphine (31.5 g) in 300 mL of dry acetonitrile at 0 °C with stirring. The resulting clear solution was stirred for another 3 h at room temperature under N2 protection. Then, 200 mL of cold water was added to the reaction mixture, and a white solid precipitate was obtained. The product was thoroughly washed with methanol/water 3:2 and then recrystallized from methanol. The white flake-like crystals were dried.

Step 2: The product (3.4 g) obtained from step 1 was dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane (200 mL) and paraformaldehyde (0.35 g) under N2 atmosphere. Then, boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF3·O(C2H5)2, 1.7 g) was added to the solution, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, forming a green solution. Methanol (200 ml) was added to precipitate the product. The obtained solid was purified by column chromatography on aluminium trioxide with petroleum ether/dichloromethane (1:2 v/v) as the eluent to afford a white powder (1.6 g).

Step 3: The product obtained from step 2 (1.0 g) and trimethylamine (33% in ethanol, 6.43 mL) were dissolved in ethanol (50 mL). The solution was refluxed overnight. Acetone was added to precipitate the final product. After filtration, a colorless C3 solid (1.30 g) was obtained.
Device fabrication
FTO glasses were cleaned using an ultra-sonication bath in soap water, rinsed progressively with distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and finally treated with UV-ozone for 15 min prior to use. The PEDOT:PSS (Xi'an p-OLED Corp.) hole transport layer (HTL) was deposited by spin-casting of PEDOT:PSS solution followed by annealing at 140 °C for 20 min. For X1 HTL deposition, 1 mg ml−1 X1 was prepared, filtered and spin-casted to form a dense film. Then, the X1 was annealed at 150 °C for crosslinking. Organohalide lead perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) films were prepared on the HTL using the method described by Nam-Gyu Park et al. PbI2 (461 mg, TCI) and CH3NH3I (159 mg) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 723 μL) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 81 μL). A small amount of Pb(SCN)2 (Aldrich) was added to the precursor to enlarge the perovskite grain size. The mixed solution was stirred at room temperature for 10 h before use. Subsequently, the perovskite film was formed by spin-casting the solution on the FTO/HTL substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s. Note that diethyl ether (500 μL) was slowly dripped on the rotating substrate to aid the formation of a uniform, dense and crystalline perovskite film. Then, the film was thermally annealed at 60 °C for 2 min and 100 °C for 5 min. After deposition of the perovskite material, the hybrid electron transport layer (ETL) and cathode buffer layer (CBL) were deposited. PCBM solution (15 mg mL−1) was spin-casted at 2000 rpm for 40 s on the perovskite film, followed by facile annealing at 90 °C for 5 min. Afterwards, C3 CBL solution (1 mg mL−1) was spin-casted on the surface of the PCBM ETL film at a speed of 3000 rpm s−1. Finally, the Ag electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation of silver under a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Torr. The active area was 0.09 cm2, as defined by a shadow mask.
