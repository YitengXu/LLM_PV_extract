    , Accepted 4th February 2021First published on 5th February 2021AbstractRecently, mixed Sn–Ge perovskites have been proposed as promising lead-free candidates in the photovoltaic (PV) field. However, as an important component of mixed Sn–Ge perovskites, the all-inorganic Sn-based perovskites have a dominant defect, SnI (Sn replacing I, anti-site), which induces a deep level in the band structure and limits the power conversion efficiency. Therefore, it is interesting to discover whether SnI and GeI (Ge replacing I, anti-site) can still act as non-radiative recombination centers in mixed Sn–Ge perovskites. Using first-principles calculations, we explored the effects of SnI and GeI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) on the PV performances. It was shown that both SnI and GeI are benign only in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3, and we suggest that CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 is a promising light-absorbing material with benign defects (GeI and SnI), strong light absorption, and small carrier effective masses. Interestingly, the concerted action of alloying on both band edges and defect states was found to result in better defect properties in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3, and this is different from results of previous studies where the modulation of introducing alloys on defects is mainly caused by regulating the band edges alone. Our work not only provides theoretical guidance for the experimental synthesis of mixed Sn–Ge perovskites with superior PV performances, but it also shows the potential of alloy engineering in regulating defect levels in perovskites.
1. Introduction
Lead perovskite solar cells have reached a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% lately.1 However, the toxicity caused by Pb has prompted research into Pb-free perovskites, among which those containing Sn have proven to be effective and have thus attracted a lot of attention in photovoltaic (PV) applications.2–4 Recent studies have shown that mixed Sn–Ge perovskites are promising Pb-free candidates for light-absorber materials (LAM).5–10 Ju et al. theoretically predicted a series of mixed Sn–Ge halide perovskites for potential applications in PVs.10 Then, Chen et al. demonstrated that all-inorganic CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 bulk crystals showed very high stability and delivered a promising PCE of up to 7.11%.8 Very recently, Liu et al. synthesized all-inorganic mixed Sn–Ge perovskite nanocrystals and elucidated the important role of Ge2+ in stabilizing the Sn2+ cation and improving both the optical and photophysical properties.9
However, as an important component of mixed Sn–Ge perovskites, the all-inorganic Sn-based perovskite has a dominant defect, SnI, which creates a deep in-gap level and thus serves as a potential non-radiative recombination center for limiting the PCE.11 Therefore, it is interesting to know whether SnI and GeI (Ge replacing I, anti-site) are still harmful to the separation of electrons and holes in mixed Sn–Ge perovskites.
In this work, we explore the effect of SnI and GeI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) on the PV performances using first-principles calculations. Our results show that both SnI and GeI are benign in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3, while at least one of them has deep levels in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25 and 0.75). Furthermore, with benign defects (GeI and SnI), strong light absorption, and small carrier effective masses, CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 is expected to be a promising PV material. Moreover, previous studies have indicated that the modulation of introducing alloys on the defects is mainly caused by regulating the band edges, while the absolute energy positions of the defect states are less sensitive to alloy composition.12,13 Interestingly, we found that in the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys, not only could the band edges be regulated significantly with Sn concentration (x), but also the absolute energy positions of the defect states. As a result, the concerted action of alloying on both band edges and defect states leads to the most benign defect properties (SnI and GeI) in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3, compared to other components.
2. Methods
Our work was implemented based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).14 The projector augmented wave (PAW) method15 was employed to describe the electron–ion interactions, and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE),16 together with the screened Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid density functional17 were carried out to obtain the exchange-correlation energy. The kinetic energy cutoff was set to 450 eV for the plane wave basis. The PBE method and the HSE06 method were adopted for geometry optimization and the calculation of electronic properties, respectively. These methods have been proven to reliably balance the computational expense and the calculation accuracy.18–21 The calculations of the electronic and optical properties were based on the fully relaxed cells. In the calculation of the defect properties, the cell size and shape were fixed. For all the structural optimizations, the internal atomic positions were allowed to relax with the symmetry switched off. Fine absorption spectra were calculated using the PBE functional and were then corrected using a “scissor operation” to match the HSE06 calculated bandgaps. With a Gaussian smearing width of 0.05 eV, a Γ-centered 3 × 3 × 3 k-mesh was used in the bandgap calculations for the 40-atom conventional cells, and a Γ-centered 1 × 1 × 1 k-mesh sampled in the Brillouin zone was used in defects calculations for the 320 atom supercells. Geometry optimizations for the defective supercells were based on the conjugate gradient algorithm, with a total energy criterion of 10−5 eV in the electronic self-consistency loop and a force criteria of 0.03 eV Å−1 in the ionic relaxation loop. The Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) method,22,23 which was implemented using the LOBSTER package,24,25 was used for analyzing the chemical bonding. The VASPKIT package26 was employed to obtain the transition dipole moment. For computational details of the effective carrier masses, see Note 1 in the ESI.†
Theoretically, spin–orbital coupling (SOC) should be considered with the presence of the heavy elements, Sn and Ge. However, it is costly to associate HSE with SOC for all calculations, due to the large defective supercells. One of the important conclusions of our work can be drawn from analyzing defect levels, and thus we tested the influence of SOC on defect states, taking GeI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 as an example (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). It is shown that the main characteristic (deep or shallow) of the defect levels is insensitive when SOC is taken into account, although the energy positions of the defect states relative to the band edges change.
In the HSE method, the short-range part of the electron–electron interactions is described by mixing the non-local Hartree–Fock exchange functional and the PBE exchange functional in a ratio of α.27As mentioned earlier, our work was based on the HSE06 method (with default α = 0.25). The calculated bandgaps with the HSE06 (α = 0.25) method for CsGeI3 and CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 are 1.47 eV and 1.13 eV, respectively, and the corresponding experimental values are 1.60 eV28 and 1.50 eV,8 respectively. It is noted that the calculated values of the bandgaps may affect the positions of the defect states.29–31 Therefore, additional HSE calculations with adjusted α values to match the experimental bandgaps were carried out, in order to check whether our conclusions of the defect levels remained (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). With adjusted α (0.32 for CsGeI3, and 0.45 for CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3), the calculated bandgaps of CsGeI3 and CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 match well with the experimental values, and the absolute energy positions of the defect levels were found to be insensitive to α (Fig. S2†). Therefore, we proved that the reliability of our results related to the defect states in the HSE06 (α = 0.25) calculations, despite the fact that the calculated bandgaps of CsGeI3 and CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 with HSE06 (α = 0.25) were found to be inconsistent with the experimental values.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Ground-state structures for the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys
First, we explored the ground-state structures used for the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys. By indexing the X-ray diffraction pattern, Chen et al. confirmed that CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 belonged to a rhombohedral system with the space group of R3m, just like that of CsGeI3.8 Accordingly, a rhombohedral unit cell consisting of eight CsGeI3 units, namely a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell, was used to build the CsGe1−xSnxI3 systems. In addition, the convergence of the total energy with respect to supercell size was examined with 4 × 4 × 4 supercells for CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75). The difference in total energy between the 4 × 4 × 4 and 2 × 2 × 2 supercells was found to be less than 1 meV per atom, implying that the convergence of the total electronic energy was reached in the 2 × 2 × 2 supercells. Various types of arrangements of the GeI6 and SnI6 motifs were considered with x = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75, as shown in Fig. 1. At x = 0.5, the most stable configuration, I, showed the space group of R3m, which is consistent with experimental results.8 In addition, configuration I is a double perovskite-like structure, where the GeI6 and SnI6 motifs form the order of a rock-salt type. It should be noted that other metastable configurations have only slightly higher energy than the ground state. This indicates that the disordered effects may exist at finite temperatures, and this may provide an opportunity to further modulate the electro-optical properties of the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys. Hereafter, we have focused on the most energetically favorable configurations at each concentration, and these are configuration C for x = 0.25, configuration I for x = 0.50, and configuration L for x = 0.75.

3.2 Electronic properties
Next, we investigated the electronic properties of the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys. It is known that the HSE06 method shows remarkable accuracy in predicting the relative bandgaps of materials where elements are within the same main group,32,33 although the calculated absolute bandgaps of CsGeI3 and CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 with the HSE06 method (α = 0.25) were found to be inconsistent with the experimental values here. Therefore, we can still conclude from Fig. 2a that the bandgaps of CsGe1−xSnxI3 decrease monotonically as x increases. In general, decreasing the lattice constant results in an increase in the overlap between B-site and X-site atomic orbitals in ABX3 perovskites, and thus both the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are boosted in energy. Moreover, the VBM increases much more rapidly due to the stronger hybridization of the B-site and X-site atomic orbitals, leading to a decrease in the bandgap. This means that the bandgap usually decreases as the lattice volume (or lattice constant) decreases. However, in the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys, the trends of the bandgap are opposite (Fig. 2a and S3†), namely the bandgap decreases as the lattice volume (or lattice constant) increases. Therefore, it is clear that a volume change will not contribute to the observed trends of the bandgap (Fig. 2a).

To understand the trends of the bandgap (Fig. 2a), we started from the origin of evolution in the band edges (Fig. 2b) and considered the atomic energy level and their orbital hybridization (Fig. 2c). The projected density of states (DOS) and projected COHP for CsGe1−xSnxI3 are shown in Fig. S4.† The VBM of CsGeI3 is mainly derived from antibonding states of Ge 4s and I 5p orbitals and its CBM is mostly composed of antibonding states of Ge 4p and I 5p orbitals (Fig. 2c and S4a†). Since Sn 5s(5p) orbitals are of higher energy than Ge 4s(4p) orbitals, the band edges of CsGe1−xSnxI3 are pushed upwards with an increase of x. Moreover, the difference in energy between the s orbitals of Sn and Ge is larger than that between the p orbitals (Fig. 2c), causing VBM to increase much more rapidly than CBM (Fig. 2b). As a result, the bandgaps of CsGe1−xSnxI3 decrease monotonically as x increases (Fig. 2a).
3.3 Optical properties
We then investigated the optical properties of CsGe1−xSnxI3. It was found that CsGe1−xSnxI3 shows a sharp absorption onset and a strong optical absorption (averaged) in the visible range, and that Sn slightly enhances the optical absorption coefficient of CsGe1−xSnxI3 (Fig. 3a). The direct bandgaps and no parity-forbidden transitions result in good optical properties for CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys, comparable to those of MAPbI3 (a typical solar cell absorber), as shown in Fig. 3b and S6.† Importantly, the strong s–p (p–p) orbital hybridization of VBM (CBM) leads to small carrier effective masses (m) in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25 and 0.50), e.g., in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3, the electron m (hole m) values along the Γ → Z and Γ → X directions are 0.188 m0 (−0.109 m0) and 0.344 m0 (−0.117 m0), respectively. Therefore, CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25 and 0.50) are both potential candidates for LAM.

3.4 Defect properties
In addition to insights into strong light absorption, light carrier effective masses and direct bandgaps, insight into the defect properties of CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys is critical for improving their PV performances, such as the transport of charge carriers34–36 and open-circuit voltage.37–39 As an important component of CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys, CsSnI3 has a dominant defect, SnI, which creates a deep in-gap level and thus serves as a potential non-radiative recombination center for limiting the PCE.11 Therefore, it is of great importance to assess the impact of SnI on photogenerated electron–hole pairs in CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys. Furthermore, it was found that the defect formation energies of GeI are comparable to those of SnI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys, according to our calculations (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†), and thus GeI should also be studied. The defect levels (Kohn–Sham levels) of GeI and SnI in the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys are illustrated in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagrams of the defect levels (Kohn–Sham levels) of (a) GeI and (b) SnI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) based on 320-atom supercells. CsGeI3 and CsSnI3 (space group of Pnma) are also shown for comparison. The 1s core level of Cs is used for alignment and the VBM of CsGeI3 is set to 0. The solid circles in blue represent electrons, and the Fermi level (EF) is shown as a black dotted line. 
It should be noted that GeI and SnI for x = 0.25 and 0.75 show very different band edges in Fig. 4a and b, and this may be as a result of the differences in GeI6(SnI6) octahedral distortions introduced by GeI and SnI. It is known that the VBM of ABX3 perovskites is contributed by B-s and X-p orbitals, while the CBM is derived from the B-p and X-p orbitals. The different BX6 octahedral distortion modes alter the hybridization strength between the B and X atoms, resulting in different band edges and bandgap values. In addition, since the CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) systems were built based on CsGeI3 (with a space group of R3m), there are little structural differences between them. Therefore, it is expected that variations in atomic orbitals, rather than structural differences, mainly determine the band edges of CsGe1−xSnxI3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.75). In Fig. 4a, the increased value of x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) causes more high-energy Sn 5s(5p) orbitals to be incorporated into the band edges, and thus the band edges increase monotonically (see Section 3.2 for more details). However, the change in the band edges with respect to x (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 1) is not monotonic in Fig. 4b, which may be due to the large structural differences between the CsSnI3 (space group, Pnma) and CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys (Fig. S8†).
Obviously, GeI and SnI induce two defect states (Fig. 4). One defect state is occupied by a single electron (named occ1) and the other is occupied by two electrons (named occ2), and they are closer to the CBM and VBM values, respectively. Importantly, it was found that neither GeI nor SnI in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 (x = 0.5) have deep levels, while at least one of them introduces deep levels in CsGe0.75Sn0.25I3 (x = 0.25) and CsGe0.25Sn0.75I3 (x = 0.75). This is consistent with the corresponding transition energy levels (Fig. S9†).
Next, we attempted to understand why both GeI and SnI are benign only in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3. For GeI in CsGe1−xSnxI3, the Sn alloy passivates the defect state occ2 by regulating the band edges. Due to the increased contribution of high-energy Sn 5s orbitals to the VBM, the VBM of CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys is much higher than that of CsGeI3 (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the defect state occ2 of CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys is moved out of the bandgaps and thus does no harm to the separation of electrons and holes (Fig. 4a).
Alternatively, we also focused on the variation of the occ1 defect state with alloy composition. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, the defect state occ1 of GeI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25 and 0.75) is localized and is deep within the bandgap, which may facilitate the non-radiative recombination of electrons and holes. Interestingly, the defect state occ1 of GeI in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 is delocalized and shallow (Fig. 5b), and this may be explained from the viewpoint of orbital composition and orbital hybridization. In CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys containing GeI, there are two nearest divalent cations around the defective Ge atom (GeD), i.e., a Ge (named GeNN) atom and a Sn (named SnNN) atom for x = 0.50 and 0.75, while there are two GeNN atoms for x = 0.25 (Fig. 5d). Clearly, the deep-level occ1 defect states at x = 0.25 and 0.75 are mainly contributed by the bonding states of the GeD 4p orbitals and the p orbitals of two surrounding GeNN/SnNN atoms, according to the partial charge densities (Fig. 5d) and the COHP (Fig. 5a and c). In general, the stronger the orbital hybridization, the lower the energy of the bonding states (Fig. 5e). For CsGe1−xSnxI3, the average bond length of GeD and the neighboring GeNN/SnNN atoms is larger at x = 0.5 than for that at x = 0.25 and 0.75 (Fig. 5d), indicating weaker hybridization of the bonding states, and thus a higher energy of occ1 in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3. Therefore, the occ1 of GeI is only delocalized and shallow in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3. In conclusion, Sn alloying of CsGe1−xSnxI3 not only passivates the defect state occ2, by increasing the VBM value, but it also makes the defect state occ1 the shallowest at x = 0.5 by influencing the hybridization strength of the defect levels.

The Fermi level is set to zero. The insets in the upper right of the DOS show partial charge densities of the trap states. In the COHP, GeD represents the defective Ge atom, and GeNN denotes the Ge atom most adjacent to GeD. (d) Local structures and partial charge densities around GeD are shown in the circles (top panel). The bottom panel indicates the sum of the bond lengths of GeD and the two most adjacent GeNN/SnNN atoms. (e) Schematic diagram depicting the influence of orbital hybridization strength on the energy of the hybrid orbitals. 
For SnI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (Fig. 4b), it was found that defect states occ1 and occ2 in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 (x = 0.5) and CsGe0.25Sn0.75I3 (x = 0.75) are benign, while occ2 in CsGe0.75Sn0.25I3 (x = 0.25) results in a deep in-gap level. This may be attributed to the octahedral distortions introduced by SnI for x = 0.25, resulting in the VBM value not being increased high enough, and thus occ2 is left in the bandgap.
It should be noted that, in many previous studies, the modulation of introducing alloys on defects is mainly caused by regulating the band edges, while the defect states change only slightly as the alloy composition varies, for example those in Mo1−xWxSe2 and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3.12,13 Interestingly, we found that in CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys, not only the band edges, but also the absolute energy positions of the defect states can be regulated significantly by x, as shown in Fig. 4a. This discrepancy may be related to the extremely different ionic radii of Ge2+ and Sn2+. In previous studies, taking Mo1−xWxSe2 alloys as an example, the similarity in ionic radii of Mo4+ and W4+ (0.065 nm for Mo4+ and 0.066 nm for W4+) results in the end-point constituents of Mo1−xWxSe2 sharing the same crystalline structures and lattice constants (a = 3.315 Å for MoSe2 and a = 3.313 Å for WSe2), which leads to the unaltered lattice parameters of Mo1−xWxSe2 over the entire concentration range.12 On the one hand, because of the similar lattice parameters and first-neighbor motifs of the defects (as shown by Huang et al.12), atomic orbitals that make up the defect states are expected to be similar among the Mo1−xWxSe2 alloys. On the other hand, due to invariable lattice parameters, the orbital hybridization strength of the defect states is supposed to be insensitive to W concentration. Therefore, the similarity in atomic orbitals that make up the defect states and the orbital hybridization strength of defect states may be responsible for the fact that the defect states are less sensitive to W concentration among the Mo1−xWxSe2 alloys. However, for the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys, since the ionic radii of Ge2+ and Sn2+ are very different (0.073 nm for Ge2+ and 0.112 nm for Sn2+), CsGeI3 and CsSnI3 belong to the space groups of R3m and Pnma, respectively (Fig. S8a and b†). The structural differences between them alter the angles between the basis vectors of the CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys (Fig. S8c†). Due to the variable lattice distortions with Sn concentration, atomic orbitals composing the defect states and the orbital hybridization strength of the defect states are different among these mixed Sn–Ge perovskites, resulting in the defect states being more sensitive to Sn concentration.
4. Conclusions
In summary, using first-principles calculations, we have assessed the potential of CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) alloys for PV applications from the perspectives of electronic, optical, and defect properties. Surprisingly, GeI and SnI both play benign roles in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3, while at least one of them shows deep in-gap levels in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25 and 0.75) and may act as a non-radiative recombination center. We suggest that the most benign defect properties (SnI and GeI) in CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 can be attributed to the concerted action of alloying on both band edges and defect states. Consequently, with strong light absorption, small carrier effective masses, and benign defects (GeI and SnI), CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 is expected to be a promising lead-free candidate in the PV field. Moreover, previous studies showed that the absolute energy positions of the defect states are less sensitive to alloy composition, while we found that the defect levels of GeI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 alloys vary significantly with Sn concentration. Encouragingly, our findings indicate that the use of alloys plays an important role in eliminating deep level defects, providing new insights into the way that alloying modulates defect properties, and further providing valuable guidelines for the future design of mixed Sn–Ge perovskites.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Energies of CsGe1−xSnxI3 with different types of GeI6 (gray) and SnI6 (red) motif arrangements for (a) x = 0.25, (b) x = 0.50, and (c) x = 0.75. The energies of the lowest-energy configurations at each concentration are set to zero.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Calculated bandgaps using the HSE06 method, (b) band alignments and (c) a schematic diagram depicting the orbital compositions of VBM and CBM for CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75). 40-Atom supercells are employed here.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Optical absorption spectra (averaged for different directions) of CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75). A typical solar cell absorber, MAPbI3, is also shown for comparison. (b) HSE06 calculated band structures (top panel) and optical transition dipole moment (bottom panel) for CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 (x = 0.50). The corresponding unfolded band structure is shown in Fig. S5 of the ESI.†	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic diagrams of the defect levels (Kohn–Sham levels) of (a) GeI and (b) SnI in CsGe1−xSnxI3 (x = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) based on 320-atom supercells. CsGeI3 and CsSnI3 (space group of Pnma) are also shown for comparison. The 1s core level of Cs is used for alignment and the VBM of CsGeI3 is set to 0. The solid circles in blue represent electrons, and the Fermi level (EF) is shown as a black dotted line.	 

 	Fig. 5  Orbital-projected density of states (DOS) and projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) for GeI in (a) CsGe0.75Sn0.25I3 (x = 0.25), (b) CsGe0.5Sn0.5I3 (x = 0.50), and (c) CsGe0.25Sn0.75I3 (x = 0.75). The Fermi level is set to zero. The insets in the upper right of the DOS show partial charge densities of the trap states. In the COHP, GeD represents the defective Ge atom, and GeNN denotes the Ge atom most adjacent to GeD. (d) Local structures and partial charge densities around GeD are shown in the circles (top panel). The bottom panel indicates the sum of the bond lengths of GeD and the two most adjacent GeNN/SnNN atoms. (e) Schematic diagram depicting the influence of orbital hybridization strength on the energy of the hybrid orbitals.
