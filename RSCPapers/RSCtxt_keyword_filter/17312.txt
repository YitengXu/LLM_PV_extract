    , Accepted 12th January 2022First published on 12th January 2022AbstractIn-depth understanding of the structure–property relationship in organic solar cells (OSCs) is of great importance in the development of the OSC field. In this study, we designed and synthesized two new chlorinated small molecule donor materials, named SM1-α-Cl (with α-chlorinated thiophene as a conjugated side chain) and SM1-β-Cl (with β-chlorinated thiophene as a conjugated side chain), by a side chain isomerization strategy. The morphology results indicate that the two small molecules present different aggregation characteristics, and the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 blend film displays enhanced molecular stacking properties, benefiting the charge transport. Besides, the ultrafast spectroscopic study indicates a higher charge transfer (CT) state yield in the SM1-β-Cl based blend. Therefore, the devices based on SM1-β-Cl:Y6 demonstrate efficient exciton dissociation, balanced electron/hole mobility and a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.14%, while SM1-α-Cl:Y6 based devices give an inferior PCE of 8.93%. These results imply that side-chain isomerization of small molecule donors could be an effective method to fine-tune the morphological features and improve the photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
To deal with the rapidly growing demand for renewable energy sources, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous attention around the world, and have been recognized as one of the most promising candidate photovoltaic technologies, due to their specific advantages in fabricating flexible devices with low cost and light weight through simple solution processing methods.1–5 Benefitting mainly from the innovation of organic semiconductors (OSs) and the optimization of device engineering, the past several decades have witnessed amazing progress in the OSC field, highlighting the great potential of commercial application in the foreseeable future.6–12 To be specific, the development of novel p-type OSs (donor materials) and n-type OSs (acceptor materials) has led to sufficient light absorption with minimum energy loss.13–19 The strategies for device optimization, such as the use of ternary blends, layer-by-layer processing, and the use of solid additives, have also played an important role in fine-tuning the morphological characteristics of active layers, benefiting the charge separation and transport.20–25
Given the specific advantages of small-molecule OSs, such as well-defined chemical structures and easy purification, the progress of small molecule OSCs (SM-OSCs) is of great importance to further promote the advancement and future commercialization of OSCs.26–30 However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of SM-OSCs always lag behind those of polymer solar cells (PSCs) with conjugated polymers as donors, which is mainly limited by the challenging issue of film morphology control.31–34 Essentially, in order to obtain an ideal film morphology with suitable donor–acceptor interpenetrating networks, we should fine-tune the crystallinity properties of either donor or acceptor materials. Recent studies have demonstrated the great importance of material structures for realizing efficient exciton separation and charge transport.35–42 For example, Qin and co-workers designed a new small molecule donor, B1, by introducing a phenyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) block as the central core to regulate the crystalline properties of the donor material. The device based on B1:BO-4Cl realized a certified efficiency of 15.1%.43 Besides, our group also deeply investigated the structure–property relationship between the structure of the donor material and the photovoltaic performance of SM-OSCs.44–47
Considering the new OS design, lots of strategies have been proposed and applied in the development of photovoltaic materials, such as halogenation and two-dimensional (2D) conjugated side chain engineering.48–50 Among the various molecular building blocks, the BDT unit has been widely used in the construction of highly efficient donor and acceptor materials. In particular, fluorine or chlorine atom substituted 2D-BDT units have become the most widely used donor units in the construction of donor materials, benefiting from their superiority in adjusting the energy levels and strengthening intermolecular interactions. Besides, to deeply investigate the structure–property relationship in OSCs, one widely used strategy is to design a series of materials with the same chemical formula but different chemical structures, which is called the isomerization strategy.51–55 For example, Li and coworkers regulated the crystalline properties of polymer films by altering the substitution position of fluorine atoms on the benzene unit.56 Wu et al. showed that different substitution positions of chlorine atoms in conjugated polymers can make a great difference in affecting polymer aggregation, charge transport, as well as photovoltaic performance.57
In our previous study, we have reported a feasible strategy to prepare chlorinated donor molecules with deeper HOMO energy levels by introducing the chlorine atom onto the β-position of thiophene side chain.58 Therefore, it is interesting to study the influence of the substitution position of chlorine atoms on the photovoltaic performance. In this study, we designed and synthesized two new chlorinated small molecule donors, named SM1-α-Cl (with the chlorine atom substituted in the α-position of the thiophene unit) and SM1-β-Cl (with the chlorine atom substituted in the β-position of the thiophene unit), aiming to obtain an in-depth understanding of the chlorine substitution position on the photovoltaic properties of SM-OSCs. Compared with SM1-α-Cl, the absorption profile in the film state of SM1-β-Cl was slightly red-shifted. The photovoltaic performance of the two molecules was studied by using Y6 as the acceptor material. The device results show that the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 based devices gave a higher PCE of 12.14%, with a moderate fill factor (FF) of 0.654, while the SM1-α-Cl based devices gave a lower PCE of 8.93%.
As displayed in Scheme S1 in the ESI,† the two small molecules, SM1-α-Cl and SM1-β-Cl, with different chlorine substitution positions were synthesized with moderate yield, and their chemical structures are displayed in Fig. 1a.59 The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), conducted in an inert atmosphere, showed that both chlorinated molecules possess good thermal stability, with relatively high 5% weight loss temperatures (365 °C for SM1-α-Cl and 367 °C for SM1-β-Cl), as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). However, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profiles of the two small molecule donor materials are quite different, as shown in Fig. 2c. The SM1-α-Cl molecule displays a slightly higher melting point (Tm) of 194.5 °C, with a smaller melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of 24.4 J g−1. However, the SM1-β-Cl molecule presents two endothermic peaks, which might result from the liquid crystalline phase, a lower Tm of 178.8 °C with a larger ΔHm of 31.1 J g−1 and a higher Tm of 195.9 °C with a quite small ΔHm of 5.8 J g−1. As shown in DFT calculations (Fig. S3, ESI†), the substitution position of chlorine could influence the molecular torsion angle, resulting in the different molecular packing and crystalline characteristics (Fig. S10, ESI†). These results indicate the great influence of the substitution position of the chlorine substituent on molecular crystalline properties.

Fig. 2a and b present the normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra in dilute chloroform solution and in the thin film state, and the corresponding parameters of their optical properties are summarized in Table 1. In the solution state, the two small molecules display almost coincident absorption profiles, with the same maximum absorption peak at 495 nm. However, in the film state, the two molecules show different absorption features. Compared with the SM1-α-Cl film, the SM1-β-Cl film presents slightly red-shifted profiles, with a stronger shoulder peak. The maximum absorption peaks of SM1-α-Cl and SM1-β-Cl films are 546 and 554 nm, respectively. Besides, compared with SM1-α-Cl (7.19 × 104 cm−1), the SM1-β-Cl film presents a higher absorption coefficient of 8.17 × 104 cm−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. S1 (ESI†) displays the absorption profiles of the blend films of SM1-α-Cl:Y6 and SM1-β-Cl:Y6, with or without thermal annealing (TA) treatment. Before the TA treatment, the absorption characteristics of the two blend films are quite similar. While after the TA treatment, in the short wavelength range, the absorption profile of the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 blend film displays more enhancement when compared with the SM1-α-Cl:Y6 blend. In the long wavelength range, the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 blend film presents slightly lower absorption than the SM1-α-Cl:Y6 blend. The absorption variation induced by TA treatment should be ascribed to the enhanced molecular packing and molecular aggregation.

Fig. S4 (ESI†) presents the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the two small molecule donors. Then the HOMO (LUMO) energy levels, EHOMO (ELUMO), of the two small molecules were derived from the onset oxidation potential (φox) (onset reduction potential (φred)) according to the equation EHOMO/ELUMO = −e(φox/φred + 4.8 − φFc/Fc+) (eV), where the redox potential of φFc/Fc+ was 0.44 V in this study.60,61 As listed in Table 1, the calculated ELUMO/EHOMO values of SM1-α-Cl and SM1-β-Cl are −3.53 eV/−5.44 eV and −3.55 eV/−5.40 eV, respectively. Compared with SM1-β-Cl, the small molecule SM1-α-Cl possesses a slightly lower LUMO energy level and a deeper HOMO energy level. Similar results of the different frontier energy levels of the materials with the same backbone have also been reported in our recent study.47Fig. 2d presents the schematic energy diagram of the materials involved in this work. The ELUMO offsets and EHOMO offsets are 0.57/0.21 eV and 0.55/0.25 eV for SM1-α-Cl:Y6 and SM1-β-Cl:Y6, respectively, which are sufficient for charge separation in the SM-OSCs.15,62 Fig. S3 (ESI†) displays the DFT calculation results. In comparison with SM1-α-Cl, SM1-β-Cl presents slightly higher LUMO and HOMO energy levels, with a smaller torsion angle between the 2D-conjugated thiophene side chain and the BDT backbone. Besides, it should be noted that although the difference in molecular torsion of the two small molecule donors (Fig. S3, ESI†) is inconspicuous, which suggests the similar steric effects in this system, the β-Cl substituted (α-alkyl chain substituted) small molecule, SM1-β-Cl, possesses a decreased molecular torsion angle, indicating the possible role of α-alkyl chain substitution in improving the molecular planarity, benefiting the molecular packing.
SM-OSCs of the two small molecules were fabricated with the conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al, as depicted in Fig. 1b.63 And the post-treatment conditions used in this work are the same as that in a previous study for better comparison.44 Similar to previous studies, the photovoltaic performance of the as cast devices are rather inferior, with a PCE of 0.17% for SM1-α-Cl:Y6 and 0.07% for SM1-β-Cl:Y6 based devices, as shown in Fig. S9 and Table S1 (ESI†). After TA treatment (120 °C for 10 min), both devices exhibit improved photovoltaic properties. Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves of the optimized SM-OSCs, and Table 2 lists the detailed photovoltaic parameters. It can be seen that, the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 based device shows a better PCE of 12.14%, with a slightly higher VOC of 0.84 V, a FF of 65.4% and a JSC of 22.10 mA cm−2 while the SM1-α-Cl:Y6 based SM-OSC displays an inferior PCE of 8.93%, with a lower FF of 49.7% and a similar JSC of 21.81 mA cm−2. The great improvement in the photovoltaic performance should be ascribed to the improved molecular aggregation and fine-tuned blend film morphology.36 These results also demonstrate that subtle modification of the molecular structures of small molecule donors will result in significant differences in photovoltaic performance. Fig. 3b displays the IPCE profiles of the SM-OSCs. Both the devices exhibit a wide photo-response, ranging from 300 nm to ∼1000 nm, implying that both the small molecule donor and acceptor contribute to the light absorption. Compared with the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 based device, the SM1-α-Cl:Y6 based SM-OSC shows slightly red-shifted profiles. A similar phenomenon has been observed in this system with different alkyl side chain substituted small molecule donors, indicating the different morphological characteristics.47 The Jsc values calculated from the integration of the IPCE spectra are 21.289, and 21.340 mA cm−2, respectively, which is consistent with the J–V measurements (∼3% mismatch).

The hole (µh) and electron (µe) mobilities were measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method, as shown in Fig. S6–S8 (ESI†). Table S2 (ESI†) summarizes the detailed charge carrier mobilities. Compared with SM1-α-Cl (0.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), the SM1-β-Cl film presents a higher hole mobility of 2.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Similar to previous studies, when mixed with acceptor Y6, both blend films without TA treatment present rather low hole and electron mobilities. After TA treatment, both the small molecule blend films exhibit obviously improved hole/electron mobilities, 1.69 × 10−4/3.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for SM1-α-Cl:Y6 and 3.33 × 10−4/2.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 blend. The higher hole mobility and hole/electron mobility ratio of the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 blend account for the better photovoltaic properties. Besides, to get a more complete understanding of the charge transport ability of the two small molecule films, organic field effect transistor (OFET) devices were fabricated and investigated for comparison. Fig. 4 present the transfer and output curves of SM1-α-Cl and SM1-β-Cl films. The corresponding OFET data are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The OFET hole mobility of SM1-β-Cl (2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is about twice higher than that of SM1-α-Cl (6.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Combined with the SCLC results, the small molecule SM1-β-Cl possesses higher hole mobilities both in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, suggesting better charge transport properties.

Fig. 3c presents the exciton dissociation probability (P(E, T)) curves of the SM-OSCs.64 With the increase of Veff, the Jph values of both devices increase in the low Veff region. It should be noted that although both the SM-OSCs show similar Jsat values, the P(E, T) values of the two SM-OSCs are quite different, indicating the stronger dependence of the SM1-α-Cl:Y6 based device on the Veff. Compared with SM1-α-Cl:Y6 (0.61 and 0.87), the P(E, T) values of the device based on SM1-β-Cl:Y6 are 0.76 and 0.92, for maximal power output conditions and short circuit conditions, respectively. The corresponding higher P(E, T) values of the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 based SM-OSCs suggest more efficient charge collection. Besides, the charge recombination mechanism of the two SM-OSCs was further investigated by analyzing the dependence of Jsc on the illumination intensity (P). The relationship of Jsc and Plight can be described as Jsc ∝ Pαlight, where α is the exponential factor.65 As shown in Fig. 3d, the α values are 0.965 and 0.986 for SM1-α-Cl:Y6 and SM1-β-Cl:Y6 based SM-OSCs, respectively. The higher α value of the β-chlorinated small molecule-based device indicates a smaller bimolecular recombination.
As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†) and Fig. 5, the neat small molecule films and blend films were carefully analyzed by GIWAXS measurements to study the influence of different chlorine substitution positions on molecular packing properties, and the corresponding GIWAXS parameters are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). For the as-cast small molecule donor films, both of the small molecule films present strong multi-level (n00) lamellar diffractions in the out-of-plane direction and relatively weak (010) π–π stacking in the in-plane direction, indicating a predominant edge-on orientation. Compared with the SM1-α-Cl film, the SM1-β-Cl film exhibits slightly enhanced diffraction peaks. Besides, it should be noted that the SM1-α-Cl film possesses a diffraction at Q ∼ 0.16 Å−1, suggesting the different molecular stacking and aggregation behavior. The diffraction at Q ∼ 0.16 Å−1 represents a d spacing of ∼40 Å, which is close to the length of the small molecule donor backbone, indicating a stronger stacking along the molecular skeleton for the SM1-α-Cl film. Similar results could also be obtained in the blend films (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, both the TA treated small molecule donor:Y6 blend films display strong multi-level lamellar diffraction peaks and the (010) π–π stacking peak, and the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 film presents a slightly enhanced diffraction intensity.

To further understand the effect of the substitution position of chlorine atoms, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was applied to further investigate this SM-OSC system, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S11 (ESI†). Both small molecule films present distinct aggregation characteristics. The neat SM1-β-Cl film without TA treatment presents enhanced aggregation, while SM1-α-Cl without any post-treatment film displayed smaller aggregates, indicating the stronger molecular stacking and aggregation properties of SM1-β-Cl with a β-chlorinated 2D-conjugated side chain. After TA treatment, both of the small molecule films show obvious fiber like aggregates. However, their aggregate features are quite different. The TA treated SM1-β-Cl film displays similar aggregates to previous studies, while the SM1-α-Cl film seems to present longer aggregates, which might result in the additional diffraction peak of GIWAXS patterns. As displayed in Fig. 6a(i and ii), the two blend films without TA treatment exhibit a rather smooth morphological feature. Besides, for the blends with TA treatment, both TEM images present improved aggregation, demonstrating the great influence of TA treatment on improving the phase separation of the blend films. And their TEM images are quite similar, without obvious differences in aggregation features. Fig. 6(iii and iv) show the AFM height images of SM1-α-Cl:Y6 and SM1-β-Cl:Y6 blend films. Before TA treatment, the two blend films were quite smooth with rather small Root-Mean-Square (RMS) values of 0.73 nm and 0.80 nm, for SM1-α-Cl:Y6 and SM1-β-Cl:Y6 blend films, respectively. After TA treatment, both the small molecule blends display enhanced roughness with similar features, indicating the enhanced molecular aggregation.

To better understand the charge transfer (CT) and recombination processes, we perform an ultrafast spectroscopic study on both blend systems. Fig. 7a and b present the transient absorption (TA) spectra of SM-α-Cl:Y6 and SM1-β-Cl:Y6, respectively. The excitation wavelength for both systems was set to 850 nm to selectively match the lowest energy absorption band of acceptor Y6, and therefore only the hole transfer process would be studied without the interference of electron or energy transfer. As shown in Fig. 7a, ground state bleach (GSB) peaks at 680 nm and 850 nm were observed immediately after excitation, indicating the formation of Y6 excitons. Another GSB appeared at 560 nm and 616 nm almost simultaneously that matched the absorption of the SM1-α-Cl small molecule donor. This GSB of the donor manifests the ultrafast hole transfer from the Y6 exciton to SM1-α-Cl, which generates the charge transfer state. Then we compared the TA spectra of SM1-β-Cl:Y6 (Fig. 7b) with those of SM1-α-Cl:Y6 (Fig. 7a), the major difference being that the SM1-β-Cl based blend displays a more distinctive GSB at 560 nm and 616 nm, suggesting a higher CT state yield in the SM1-β-Cl based blend than in the SM1-α-Cl based blend. The relatively lower CT state yield of the SM1-α-Cl based blend film should be ascribed to the improper molecular packing characteristic and film morphology. The higher yield in the CT state would lead to better photocurrent generation, resulting in a better photovoltaic performance. The kinetic curves at 616 nm for the GSB of both small molecule donors were extracted from the transient spectra, and both blend systems exhibit similar CT and recombination dynamics (Fig. 7c).

In conclusion, we designed and synthesized two new wide band-gap small molecule donors with different substitution positions of chlorine atoms to study the structure–property relationship in SM-OSCs. As a result, the β-chlorinated small molecule, SM1-β-Cl, possesses red-shifted absorption spectra. Combined with the morphology analysis, SM1-β-Cl presents slightly enhanced molecular stacking and aggregation characteristics, implying that different substitution positions of chlorine atoms on the thiophene conjugated side chains of the BDT unit could make a great difference in the molecular stacking properties, leading to different morphological features and device performance. Besides, the results of SM-OSCs show that the SM1-β-Cl:Y6 based SM-OSCs exhibit a higher PCE of 12.14%, with a VOC of 0.840 V, a JSC of 22.10 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.4%, while the SM-OSCs based on SM1-α-Cl:Y6 gave an inferior PCE of 8.93%. Therefore, these results indicate that fine-tuning the substitution position of the halogen atom substituent in small molecule donors could be a feasible method to further promote the advancement of SM-OSCs.
