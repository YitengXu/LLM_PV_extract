    , Accepted 3rd April 2018First published on 3rd April 2018AbstractThe implementation of positive alternative electron transporting layers (ETLs) with excellent electronic properties is a most promising method to up-scale low-cost highly efficient perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology. The present work demonstrates the preparation of tin oxide (SnO2) nanofibers (NF) and nanobelts (NB) as an electron transporting layer (ETL) for PSCs. The smooth and uniform nanofibers and nanobelts have been prepared using an electrospinning technique followed by calcination at 600 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis performed on the as-spun polyvinylpyrrolidone-tin oxide (PVP-SnO2) composite suggests that a calcination temperature of 600 °C is required to obtain pure SnO2 and to ensure complete removal of PVP along with other organic solvents. The structural analysis confirmed the presence of the pure tetragonal rutile phase of SnO2 nanofibers and nanobelts. The prepared nanofibers and nanobelts were further used as ETLs for PSCs. Our optimized experimental parameters yielded a JSC of 22.46 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.081 V and FF of 66%, leading to >16% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for SnO2 nanobelts using an (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbI3)0.15 perovskite absorber layer with good stability. The obtained PCE is much higher than that of the SnO2 NF (12.893%) morphology. Nevertheless, the synthesis of SnO2 NF/NB ETLs provides a simple, low-cost and large-scale method for PSCs.
1. Introduction
Nanostructured materials provide a major focus in the field of various energy material based devices due to the dependence of their structural and electronic properties on their size and dimensions.1–6 Fewer grain boundaries and a reduction in the number of dead-ends in one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials could provide sufficient interconnecting pathways in nanoparticle thin films. Therefore, highly ordered nanostructures provide satisfactory charge collection efficiency.2 Up to now various SnO2 nanostructures have been used for applications, including dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).8–13 In addition, well-aligned SnO2 nano-arrays have been synthesized by hydrothermal,14–16 sol–gel and template-assisted fabrication methods.17,18 It is expected that the nanostructured 1D architecture strongly influences the charge-transport and recombination dynamics.3 Due to its wide band gap (3.6 eV), n-type semiconducting properties and higher electron mobility both in the single crystal (250 cm2 V−1 s−1)4 as well as in nanostructures (125 cm2 V−1 s−1),5 SnO2 can facilitate a faster transport of photo-injected electrons for collection. Furthermore, it has high chemical stability with excellent optical and electronic properties.6 It should also be noted that the deeper conduction band (CB) of SnO2 compared to conventional TiO2 could facilitate enhanced charge transfer from perovskite to the CB of SnO2. So far, many fabrication methods have been investigated for the synthesis of SnO2 nanostructures. However, due to its versatility in obtaining controlled nanofibers and its porosity, low-cost electrospinning is the best choice. There are various configurations of PSCs based on their electron transporting layer (ETL) and hole transporting layer (HTL) positions, such as regular (n-i-p) and inverted (p-i-n) types.7 So far, the breakthrough efficiency of PSCs has been demonstrated based on meso-superstructured ETLs. The basic requirement for ‘ideal ETLs’ is that they should facilitate excellent electronic mobility, high optical transmittance and well-matched energy levels.
As far as PSCs are concerned, various ETLs, such as TiO2,19,20 ZnO,21 ZnSnO4,22–24 Nb2O5,25 In2S3,26 BaSnO327 and Nb:SnO2,28 have been implemented successfully using different techniques. In general, the ETL and HTL layers were deposited on both sides of the perovskite absorber in order to extract electrons and holes respectively. In some cases, an HTM-free29 and carbon-based hole extraction layer30 (hereafter C-PSCs) has also been reported for PSCs. However, the efficiency of such devices is relatively low. Recently, hybrid perovskite absorbers, such as methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX) and formamidinium lead halide (FAPbX) (where X = Cl, Br or I) have attracted significant attention as promising materials for low-cost photovoltaic technology. Within the last five years PSCs have achieved 23.6%,31 an extraordinary power conversion efficiency (PCE) (for tandem cells) via low-temperature processes.32–35 As far as SnO2 ETL PSCs are concerned, Jiang et al.36 used a commercial SnO2 colloid precursor and synthesized uniform ETL at 150 °C using the spin coating technique. The fabricated PSCs using an (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 perovskite absorber revealed 19.9% PCE. On the other hand, Snaith et al. implemented a low-temperature (∼80 °C) chemical bath deposition technique (CBD) for the synthesis of an SnO2 ETL and achieved a high PCE of up to 17.1%.37 Zhu et al. synthesized nanocrystalline SnO2 using a hydrolysis sol–gel method and used it as the ETL for inverted-type PSCs with 18.8% efficiency, a VOC of 1.12 V, JSC of 21.8 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.77.38 Song et al. used a low-temperature method for the synthesis of SnO2-based electron-selective contact with 13% efficiency for planar-type PSCs.39 Rao et al. used an SnO2 nanocolloid sol of ∼3 nm in size synthesized at 60 °C and demonstrated 14.69% efficiency.40 Correa Baena et al. achieved hysteresis-free >18% efficiency by using an atomic layer deposited (ALD) SnO2 ETL.41 Moreover, Ke et al. used SnO2/fullerene ETLs with 19.12% efficiency.42 Anaraki et al. used spin coating (SC) and a chemical bath deposition technique (CBD) to synthesize a simple, fast and low-temperature processed SnO2 ETL for planar PSC and demonstrated 20.7% PCE with 1.214 V open circuit voltage (VOC).43 Therefore, due to these inherent properties of SnO2, it could be a suitable positive alternative to replace a mesoscopic TiO2 layer in PSCs. A detailed literature survey is given in Table 1. In this study, we have synthesized electrospun SnO2 NFs and NBs and employed them as ETLs for meso-superstructured architectures. Our results demonstrate that SnO2 NBs are one of the best alternatives for PSCs, with >16% PCE.

2. Results and discussion
First the electrospun PVP-SnO2 samples were subjected to thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine a suitable calcination temperature for removing PVP from the as-spun nanofibers. It can be observed from the TGA curve for weight loss shown in Fig. 1 that PVP starts to evaporate between the temperatures of 400 °C and 500 °C. Similarly, it can be seen from the observed weight loss in the as-spun SnO2 nanofibers that the PVP present in the as-spun SnO2 nanofibers also started to evaporate in the temperature range 300–500 °C. The semiconductor characteristics of SnO2 are retained only after 500 °C in as-spun SnO2 nanofibers, since above 500 °C the solvent and organic residues are completely removed. The phase transformation from amorphous PVP-SnO2 nanofibers to a crystalline pure phase SnO2 state occurred at a temperature above 500 °C.40 No change in weight loss above 500 °C was observed, which suggests that a calcination temperature up to 600 °C is suitable for the complete removal of organic solvents and polymers to obtain pure SnO2 nanofibers. Thus, based on TGA results, a temperature of 600 °C was optimal for calcination of the as-spun SnO2 samples.
 Fig. 1  Thermal profile obtained from TGA analysis for an as-spun SnO2 sample compared with PVP and SnO2. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of electrospun SnO2 NFs were acquired before and after calcination (Fig. 2). Both SnO2 NFs and NBs are quite long, up to several hundred μm. Fig. 2(a and b) represents the rougher morphology of the as-spun SnO2 NFs with diameters of about 450–500 nm. The calcined SnO2 NFs show a drastic decrease in diameter up to 80–200 nm. Small granules covering SnO2 nanofibers are observed, indicating incomplete crystallization of SnO2 fibers and the presence of PVP in the as-spun fibers. These granules are also interpreted as Sn-rich nanocomposite clusters formed due to optimum electrospinning parameters such as viscosity of the solution, tip-drum voltage and concentration of solution with increased Sn content.43 However, it is observed that after calcination at 600 °C, PVP is removed from the SnO2 nanofibers and crystallization of SnO2 proceeds. Fig. 2(c) presents the morphology of SnO2 nanofibers after calcination at 600 °C. The SnO2 fibers are long and uniform with diameters of about 50–150 nm. Fig. 2(b) and (d) show higher magnification images, revealing diameters of as-spun and SnO2 fibers after calcination. It can also be observed from Fig. 2(d) that the removal of PVP during the calcination process retains the long fibril structure of SnO2 and enhances the crystallization of SnO2, providing a highly smooth and well-defined texture to SnO2 fibers. Fig. 2(e and f) represents the SEM micrographs of the as-spun PVP-SnO2 composite at different magnifications. The length of the NBs is much longer than 500 μm. Fig. 2(g) represents the SnO2 NBs after calcination. It can be observed that the morphology of the NBs remains the same. However, the width of the NBs reduced to 1 μm (Fig. 2(h)). However, the thickness of the NBs is almost the same and is in the range 180–200 nm. From the above discussion we can conclude that the morphology of SnO2 can be controlled by the applied voltage and tip-to-drum distance. From the higher magnified SEM micrographs it can also be observed that the NBs are quite thin and uniform compared to the NFs.

XRD analysis was conducted in order to characterize the structural properties of SnO2 NFs and NBs. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of SnO2 NBs and NFs as deposited and thermally annealed at 600 °C. The diffraction peaks of the SnO2 NFs/NBs revealed a pure tetragonal rutile phase (space group P42/mnm, a = 4.738 and c = 3.187 Å) (JCPDS card no. 41-1445) and are ascribed to the reflection of (110), (101), (200), (210), (220), (002), (310), (301), (202), (321) planes of rutile SnO2.44 Both SnO2 samples annealed at 600 °C revealed highly intense peaks due to the decomposition of PVP and crystallization. While no additional phases are observed, indicating the high purity and crystallinity of SnO2. The lattice parameters ‘a’ and ‘c’ of the SnO2 NBs are determined from the XRD and are estimated from the formula for a tetragonal system. (1)
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of as-spun SnO2 NBs and NBs and respective samples annealed at 600 °C. 
The calculated values of ‘a’ and ‘c’ for SnO2 NFs are a = 4.737 Å and c = 3.186 Å while for NBs they are a = 4.738 Å, c = 3.186 Å. Both XRD patterns are well matched with the tetragonal rutile SnO2 (JCPDS: 41-1445) phase.
Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were obtained to elucidate the in-depth crystal structure and composition of electrospun SnO2 NBs. Fig. 4(a) shows the TEM images of the SnO2 structure, which reveal that SnO2 NBs result from the interconnection of small uniform agglomerated SnO2 nanoparticles in the long axial direction. In Fig. 4(a) small granules covering SnO2 nanoparticles are observed, while in Fig. 4(b), smooth and uniform SnO2 nanoparticles are observed due to the removal of PVP after calcination at high temperature. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 4(c)) with indexed rings demonstrates polycrystalline SnO2 with (110), (101), (220) and (310) planes.45,46 The HRTEM image of the SnO2 NBs, as shown in Fig. 4(e), demonstrates d101 = 0.268 nm along the (101) plane of rutile SnO2. Lattice planes with spacing d110 = 0.334 nm were also observed, corresponding to the (110) lattice planes of tetragonal rutile SnO2. The uniform distribution of lattice planes observed in each SnO2 nanoparticle reveals the highly crystalline nature of SnO2 NBs.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the chemical composition of the SnO2 NBs (Fig. 5). The binding energies of the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels were measured at 487.0 and 495.0 eV, respectively, for calcinated SnO2 nanobelts which agree very well with the values reported for SnO2.47 It should also be noted that both these 3d peaks show a single symmetric component without any satellite peak, which clearly reveals that the synthesized SnO2 nanobelts and nanofibers are in the Sn4+ chemical state.48,49Fig. 5(b) shows the O 1s core level spectrum of the SnO2 nanobelts. The main O 1s core level at 531.67 eV is assigned to the metallic oxides. However, it can also be observed that the O 1s peak is somewhat asymmetric in its shape, suggesting that there might be two kinds of oxygen species. The deconvoluted analysis of the main O 1s peak revealed that the satellite peak at 532.14 eV is due to metallic oxide Sn–O or surface oxygen.

Fig. 6(a and b) shows the SEM top view of the perovskite layer deposited on NFs and NBs respectively. The SnO2 NB ETL based perovskite film produced a high-quality textured, pinhole-free thin film with large grain sizes between 250 and 350 nm which are much larger than those of SnO2 NFs (50–90 nm). The smooth and uniform SnO2 NBs can facilitate the nucleation sites for the perovskite layer. It should also be noted that the uniform and smooth surface facilitates a high-quality perovskite thin film.50 The current voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs based on two different types of SnO2 ETLs are as shown in Fig. 6(c). The perovskite devices fabricated from SnO2 nanofiber ETLs yielded an average 12.893% PCE with a short circuit current (JSC) of 19.83 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.032 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.63. On the other hand, the devices fabricated using NBs show a drastic increment in JSC as well as VOC. The optimized device fabricated using SnO2 NBs ETL exhibited a JSC of 22.46 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.081 V and FF of 0.66, resulting in a PCE of 16.02%. The device energy band diagram is shown in the inset of Fig. 6(c) for an SnO2 ETL. The perovskite absorber absorbs the photon energy and the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the conduction band (CB) of SnO2 ETL, while the holes travel through the HTM to gold contacts. The excited electrons and holes are extracted from the SnO2 ETL and spiro-MeOTAD HTM, respectively, and flow from the external circuit. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) revealed that the NB ETL based sample achieved a much higher IPCE value than an NF based PSC (Fig. 6(d)). Integration of the IPCE spectra over the solar emission yielded 19.54 and 21.95 mA cm−2, respectively, indicating that the spectral mismatch is negligibly small.

Furthermore, we have studied the reproducibility of our developed SnO2 morphology. The reproducibility of the developed method was analyzed with the J–V curves of 25 independent perovskite solar cell devices fabricated using SnO2 nanofiber and nanobelt ETLs. It should be noted that the reproducibility of the SnO2 nanobelt based HEL is much higher, showing an average PCE >15.5 ± 0.5%. While SnO2 nanofiber ETL based devices show >12.5 ± 0.5% PCE. We observed an average JSC of 22.5 ± 0.5 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.01 ± 0.02 V, and FF of 63 ± 2%, yielding an average 12.5 ± 0.5% efficiency (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the SnO2 nanobelt ETL based devices revealed a JSC of 22.1 ± 0.5 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.080 ± 0.01 V, and FF of 65 ± 2%, yielding an average 15.5 ± 0.50% efficiency. In addition, we recorded the photocurrent under constant illumination for both types of devices to confirm the device stability and reliability of the PSCs. The steady-state photocurrent was measured at the maximum power point calculated from the J–V curves (Fig. S2†) and that comes to around −0.9 V.51–55 From the steady-state photocurrent output (Fig. 8) of our champion devices, a dramatic increment exhibited in the initial few seconds and reaches ∼19.8 and 22.4 mA cm−2, corresponding to a 12.8 and 16.01% PCE for SnO2 nanofiber and nanobelt ETL based devices, respectively. These results demonstrated the photocurrent output to be stable for as long as 50 s. It can also be observed that these values are close to the PCE obtained from the J–V measurement, which is in good agreement with the stability of our fabricated devices. The hysteresis analysis of the NF and NB ETL based PSC devices was examined by changing the scan direction in the J–V measurements. Fig. S1† shows the J–V curves of the optimized samples in the forward and reverse scan directions. The forward scan (for NF based PSCs) showed a JSC of 19.78 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.021 V and FF of 0.59, yielding 11.92 PCE, while the reverse scan showed 12.893% PCE (JSC = 19.83 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.032 V and FF of 0.63). In the case of NB based PSCs, the forward scan and reverse scan exhibited 14.86% and 16.02%, respectively, indicating ∼1% hysteresis. The hysteresis results are summarized in Table S1.†

The electron extraction properties from the perovskite layer in contact with different SnO2 NF and NB ETLs have been investigated by photoluminescence (PL) (Fig. 9(a)) and time resolved PL (TRPL) analysis (Fig. 9(b)). Fig. 9(a) shows the (PL) spectra of the perovskite layer deposited on FTO/SnO2 NF and FTO/SnO2 NB substrates. Both electrodes show a strong luminescence peak at ∼765 nm which is in good agreement with previous studies of a mixed halide perovskite absorber of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 composition. However, it can be observed that the peak intensity has decreased for an NB ETL, which indicates the excellent charge extraction from the perovskite absorbing layer. Further, the TRPL decay profile data (Fig. 9(b)) was fitted to a bi-exponential function of the form:50,56–58 (2)where, τ1 and τ2 are the first-order and second-order decay times, and A1 and A2 are the respective weight factors of each decay channel. The well-fitting lifetime measurements and weight fractions for the perovskite layer deposited on SnO2 NFs and NBs are summarized in Table 2. The average recombination lifetimes 〈τavg〉 for SnO2 NFs and NBs were calculated using the following equation:59,60 (3)

The calculated average lifetime 〈τavg〉 for the perovskite layer deposited on the NF and NB substrates decreased from 40.76 to 23.15 ns, respectively. The FTO/SnO2 NF/perovskite and FTO/SnO2 NB/perovskite thin film samples show fast decay lifetimes (τ1) of 11.467 and 10.526 ns, respectively. On the other hand, the slow decay lifetimes (τ2) of the respective samples are 67.453 and 56.284 ns. The A1 values for fast lifetime decay were 0.7146 and 0.7645 FTO/SnO2 NF/perovskite and FTO/SnO2 NB/perovskite samples, respectively. In addition, the calculated A2 values decreased slightly from 0.2854 to 0.2355. From the above discussion, it is clear that the NB sample provides more effective charge transport than the NF sample. The low grain boundaries provided by smooth and uniform SnO2 NBs are responsible for the large grain size of the perovskite layer. This means that the electron injection from perovskite into SnO2 NBs becomes faster than for NFs, revealing the effective charge transfer at the perovskite/SnO2 NB interfaces. In addition, we studied the long-term stability of fabricated devices based on SnO2 ETLs (Fig. S3†). For stability we stored these perovskite solar cell devices in a nitrogen-filled glove box in the dark. The obtained results are summarized in Fig. S3.† Interestingly, it was found that the NB ETL based PSC solar cells showed much higher stability than SnO2 NFs, which might be due to the large grain size of the perovskite absorber. These large grain size perovskites prevent the degradation of FAI cations. However, it should be noted that the decrease in PCE is mainly because of the fast decrease in FF for NF based PSCs. Using a stable hole transporting material such as PTAA or CuSCN and proper encapsulation, the stability of these PSCs could be improved further.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have prepared smooth and uniform SnO2 NFs and NBs which were synthesized by using a simple, low-cost and large-scale production technique, i.e. an electrospinning technique. Morphological studies, such as SEM and TEM, reveal that after calcination at 600 °C smooth and long SnO2 nanobelts with no trace of PVP are obtained. XRD and SAED patterns confirm the formation of pure tetragonal rutile phase of SnO2 nanobelts. The binding energy obtained for SnO2 nanofibers from XPS spectra is also in agreement with the reported data for SnO2 nanofibers. The synthesized long and uniform SnO2 NFs and NBs have been successfully applied as ETLs for regular n-i-p type PSCs. The interconnecting network of SnO2 NBs provides better pathways and low grain boundaries for charge transport in the perovskite solar cells. The NBs facilitate an ideal ETL for PSCs with >16% efficiency with a JSC of 22.46 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.081 V and FF of 0.66. Therefore, we strongly believe that this synthesis process will make a key contribution in PSCs toward mass scale production.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Synthesis of SnO2 by electrospinning
Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) (PVP K90) with a molecular weight of ∼130000, ethanol (Daejung), tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, Junsei) and acetic acid (Kanto Chemical) were used for the preparation of SnO2 nanofiber (NF) and nanobelt (NB) solutions. All these chemicals were used without any further purification. The electrospinning solution was prepared using the procedure described here. Initially, a viscous solution of PVP/ethanol (1:9 wt%) was prepared by vigorous stirring for 24 hours at room temperature. A separate solution from dissolving 6 ml of SnCl2·2H2O in acetic acid and ethanol (1:1 vol%) was prepared and stirred for 24 hours. Finally, the prepared cleared SnCl2·2H2O solution was slowly mixed with ethanolic PVP and simultaneously stirred for 5 hours to get a colloidal PVP-SnO2 viscous solution. The prepared viscous solution was electrospun using indigenous electrospinning equipment at 15 and 12 kV voltage for the synthesis of the SnO2 NFs and NBs, respectively. The drum rotating speed and feed rate were kept constant at 400 rpm and 1.0 ml h−1, respectively. The feed rate was controlled through a syringe pump (KDS-100, KD Scientific). The electrospun PVP-SnO2 composite was collected on Al foil. Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis was carried out to determine the calcination temperature to completely remove organic solvents i.e. PVP as well as the water content in as-spun SnO2 nanofibers. The as-spun PVP-SnO2 nanofibers were then further annealed at 600 °C for 30 min (heating rate: 4 °C min−1). Morphological and structural analysis was carried out in order to test and examine the obtained electrospun SnO2 samples.
4.2 Device fabrication
The patterned FTO-coated glass substrates (TEC15, Pilkington) were cleaned by a standard cleaning procedure and subjected to UV ozone treatment for 30 min. A compact hole blocking SnO2 (Bl-SnO2) electron transporting layer (ETL) was prepared by spin-coating of SnCl2·2H2O at 3000 rpm in ambient conditions. The prepared electrodes were further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min and used for SnO2 nanofiber deposition. The SnO2 nanofiber paste was prepared using the desired amount of ethyl cellulose and terpineol solution in ethanol solvent. The prepared ethanolic SnO2 NF, NB paste was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s on FTO/Bl-SnO2 substrate followed by gradual annealing at 500 °C for 30 min.
4.3 Preparation of perovskite precursor solutions
Methylammonium lead bromide (MABr) and formamidinium NH2CHNH2I (FAI) were synthesized by reacting methylamine solution (aqueous, 40 wt%) and formamidine acetate (Aldrich) with hydrobromic acid (HBr) (48 wt% in water) and hydroiodic acid (57% in water, Aldrich), respectively, in an ice bath followed by a recrystallization method. The desired composition of perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving FAI, PbI2, MABr and PbBr2 in a mixed solvent of DMF:DMSO (4:1 v/v) to make (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15. For a typical experiment, the molar ratios were 0.85:0.15 and 1:1 for PbI2/PbBr2 and MABr/PbBr2 precursors, respectively. This perovskite solution was deposited through a two-step spin coating program (10 s at 2000 rpm and 30 s at 6000 rpm) with dripping of chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent during the second step, 10 s before the end. All the perovskite layers were annealed at 100 °C for 90 min. The hole transport material (HTM) was prepared as per our previous report.19 80 mg of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD, Merck) was dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (99.8%, Aldrich) with the addition of 37.5 μL of bis(trifiuoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich) (170 mg ml−1) in acetonitrile and 17.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich). The prepared spiro-MeOTAD HTM solution was spin-coated on the FTO/SnO2/perovskite substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The devices were completed by depositing 80 nm thick Au contacts on the top of the HTM over layer by thermal evaporation (growth rate ∼0.5 Å s−1). The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.09 cm2. The active area was calculated as the area of gold and laser pattern per cross-sectional area. The exact illumination to the active area was fixed by using a metal shadow mask on the underside during the measurements.
4.4 Characterizations
The surface morphology of the SnO2 NB and NF samples was recorded by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; S-470 0, Hitachi). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using a D/MAX Ultima III XRD spectrometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a CuKα line of 1.5410 Å. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (TECNAI F20 Philips operated at 200 kV) technique were used in order to check the structural and morphological analysis in depth. The thermal analysis of as-synthesized SnO2 composite samples was carried out using a Shimadzu-TGA-50 TG-DTA thermal analyser in air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The elemental composition of SnO2 was analysed using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (VG Multilab 2000-Thermo Scientific, USA, K-Alpha) with a multi-channel detector, which can endure high photonic energies from 0.1 to 3 keV. The cells were illuminated using a solar simulator at AM 1.5 G for 10 s, where the light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter to 1 sun intensity (100 mW cm−2). The steady-state photocurrent stability was measured at the maximum power point biased at −0.9 V. The IPCE spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 1100 nm on the basis of a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay transients were measured at 750 ± 20 nm using excitation with a 470 nm light pulse at a frequency of 5 MHz from a Spectrophotometer F-7000.
