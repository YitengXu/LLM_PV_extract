    , Accepted 15th December 2020First published on 15th December 2020AbstractTwo benzotrithiophene-based two-dimensional non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), namely B3T-BT-6F with a fused-ring structure and B3T-TT-6F with an unfused-ring structure, were designed and synthesized to investigate the effects of a fused or unfused NFA molecular backbone on the performance of organic solar cells. Compared to the fused B3T-BT-6F, the unfused B3T-TT-6F shows a 34 nm red-shifted absorption with an optical bandgap reduced from 1.54 to 1.44 eV and it exhibits almost unchanged lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels. Importantly, the blended photoactive film based on the unfused B3T-TT-6F as an NFA and PBDB-T as a donor exhibits a higher and more balanced mobility in comparison with the fused B3T-BT-6F based film. As a result, the optimized photovoltaic device based on the unfused B3T-TT-6F acceptor shows a high efficiency of 9.94%, which is superior to that of the device using fused B3T-BT-6F (8.40%) and is among the highest efficiencies for 2D NFA based devices. The success of this molecular design strategy should have important implications for developing efficient NFAs for high performance organic solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention and have been intensively investigated due to the potential application in low-cost, lightweight and flexible devices.1–7 In the past few years, a lot of high performance non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), such as ITIC and its derivatives,8–10 and Y6 and its derivatives,11–13 have been developed for OSCs and superior power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 17% have been demonstrated.14–17 Compared to fullerene derivatives, NFAs exhibit excellent synthetic flexibility, facilitating a versatile synthesis strategy for central core units, easy fine-tuning of side chains and a wide choice of the terminal electron-withdrawing end-groups, leading to tunable energy levels and bandgaps.3,4 As a result, PSCs based on NFAs with low bandgaps show more possible applications, such as semitransparent solar cells,18 tandem solar cells16 and integrated perovskite–organic solar cells.19 More importantly, NFA-based OSCs have the potential to realize low voltage loss due to the low driving energies needed for the charge separation.5 To date, A–D–A (acceptor–donor–acceptor) type NFAs with a linear backbone have drawn extensive attention due to their great potential in making high performance OSCs. Though significant PCE has been realized, it is still necessary to develop new types of NFAs to further improve the efficiency.
Utilizing the A–D–A type structure is an efficient strategy to tune the energy levels and bandgap of conjugated small molecules,20 and it has been widely used to construct high performance donor and acceptor materials.1–3 So far, the most efficient small molecular donors and NFAs have shown a linear A–D–A type structure.1 Two-dimensional (2-D) conjugated acceptors have the potential to extend the intramolecular conjugation to increase light absorption, improve solar spectral coverage and enhance the intermolecular π–π stacking, leading to improved charge mobility and photocurrent density. Importantly, 2D NFAs have the advantage of a preferred face-on packing orientation with respect to the substrate due to their extended π-conjugation in two dimensions, which is beneficial for charge transport between the top and bottom electrodes in OSCs. So far, 2D NFAs have attracted particular interest due to their extended charge transport in 2D directions; however, efficient 2D NFAs are still very limited.21–26 Moreover, linear NFAs with a fused-ring structure have been widely studied, and utilizing them has proven to be an efficient strategy for high performance OSCs.3,4 However, the effects of a fused or unfused-ring conjugated structure on the performance of 2D NFAs have rarely been studied.
In this work, a class of 2D conjugated NFAs, including B3T-BT-6F with a fused structure and B3T-TT-6F with an unfused structure (Scheme 1) were successfully synthesized and the effects of a fused or unfused-ring structure on the photophysical properties of NFAs were comparatively studied. The benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene (BTT) based building block was used as a central core unit and electron-withdrawing 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2F-IC) was used as an end-group in the 2D NFAs. Compared to the fused B3T-BT-6F counterpart, unfused B3T-TT-6F is flexible in solution due to the C–C single bond between the thiophene spacer and the core unit, and it will remain flat in the solid state due to the conjugated structure, which is beneficial for the morphology control. It is found that the unfused B3T-TT-6F exhibits a broadened solar spectrum coverage, lower bandgap, and higher and more balanced mobility when it has been used as an acceptor in OSCs in comparison with fused B3T-BT-6F. As a result, unfused B3T-TT-6F based devices exhibited an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.82 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.28 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.4%, yielding a champion PCE of 9.94%, which is larger than that of fused B3T-BT-6F based devices (PCE = 8.4%). The results indicate that utilizing a 2D NFA with an unfused structure should be an efficient strategy to construct high performance NFA materials.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of B3T-TT-6F and B3T-BT-6F are shown in Scheme 1, and the detailed synthesis procedures are given in the ESI.† Esters 3 and 5 were synthesized through Stille coupling of a BTT stannyl derivative with the corresponding commercial bromo-esters 2 and 4, respectively. The alcohol intermediate was synthesized via double nucleophilic addition reaction. Using acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction, compound B3T-BT and 6 were achieved through the cyclization of the corresponding alcohol intermediates, which was achieved by using (4-hexylphenyl)lithium as a nucleophilic reagent with the classical double nucleophilic addition reaction.27 Through direct formylation of B3T-BT followed by Knoevenagel condensation with 2F-IC, B3T-BT-6F was obtained with a yield of 78%. B3T-TT was synthesized by Stille coupling of compound 7 with the thiophene based stannyl derivate. The unfused target molecule B3T-TT-6F was achieved through Knoevenagel condensation of the 2F-IC with the corresponding aldehydes in 79% yield. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements (Fig. S1, ESI†) show that both the two acceptors exhibit superior thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of 346 °C and 365 °C for B3T-BT-6F and B3T-TT-6F, respectively.
The electrochemical properties of the two NFAs were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). The detailed data are summarized in Table S1.† The calculated highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the two molecules are −5.62 and −4.03 eV for B3T-BT-6F, and −5.42 and −4.04 eV for B3T-TT-6F, respectively.27 The fused B3T-BT-6F exhibits a down-shifted HOMO level and an enlarged electrochemical band gap, consistent with the optical band gap. The almost unchanged LUMO level for the unfused B3T-TT-6F in comparison with the fused B3T-BT-6F indicates that the high VOC will be maintained in the photovoltaic devices since the maximum value of VOC is determined by the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor and LUMO level of the acceptor, consistent with the J–V results discussed below.28 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the CAMB3LYP/6-31G(d) level was carried out to study the optimized molecular geometries and the frontier molecular orbitals of the two NFAs (Fig. 1). Both B3T-TT-6F and B3T-BT-6F exhibit highly planar and C3h-symmetric π-conjugated backbones, which could facilitate intermolecular interaction and enhance the π–π stacking. The HOMO levels distributed on the central core and LUMO levels were equally delocalized over the whole conjugated backbones for both NFAs. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels were consistent with the trend of CV results discussed above.

Compared to fused B3T-BT-6F with a bandgap of 1.69 eV and a maximum absorption peak at 682 nm, the unfused B3T-TT-6F exhibits a lower bandgap of 1.59 eV with a maximum absorption peak at 712 nm in chloroform solution (Fig. S2, ESI†). Absorption spectra in the films (Fig. 2a) show the same trends as compared to the solution spectra, and largely red-shifted absorption bands are visible, indicating the strong π–π stacking of NFA molecules in the films. The maximum absorption peaks of the two NFAs in films are 721 nm for B3T-BT-6F and 755 nm for B3T-TT-6F. The corresponding optical band gaps of NFAs in thin films are 1.54 and 1.44 eV, respectively, which were estimated from the onset absorption of the film (Table S1, ESI†). The broadened absorption spectrum and lower bandgap for the unfused B3T-TT-6F compared to those of the fused B3T-BT-6F suggest its great potential to give higher photocurrent density when it was used as an acceptor in OSCs.

To investigate the effect of fused or unfused NFAs on the performance of OSCs, inverted devices were fabricated with the device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:NFA/MoOx/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3a. The detailed data are summarized in Table 1. Without any post-treatment, the device based on fused B3T-BT-6F exhibits a PCE of 6.48%, which is lower than that of the device based on unfused B3T-TT-6F (7.43%). Upon using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as an additive and thermal annealing of the photoactive film, the devices based on both NFAs showed increased JSC and FF, suggesting optimized morphology of donor/acceptor materials in films. The optimized fused B3T-BT-6F-based devices show an increased PCE of 8.40%, a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 16.53 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.48%. For the unfused B3T-TT-6F-based device, the JSC was increased to 18.28 mA cm−2, and FF was increased to 66.41%, combined with an unchanged VOC of 0.82 V, yielding a high PCE of 9.94%. Statistics based on 20 devices are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The higher JSC and FF of B3T-TT-6F-based devices could be ascribed to its relatively red-shifted absorption and more balanced charge carrier mobility as discussed below. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Fig. 3b) of the optimized devices shows a higher and broadened photocurrent response for the unfused B3T-TT-6F-based device, in good agreement with its absorption spectrum. The JSC values of B3T-TT-6F and B3T-BT-6F based devices calculated from EQE spectra are 18.04 and 15.85 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the values measured from J–V curves with a mismatch less than 5%.

To figure out the effects of fused and unfused NFAs on exciton dissociation and collection efficiency in OSCs, photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) curves (Fig. 3d) were measured. Jsat mainly relates to the absorbed incident photons at high Veff, where most of the photogenerated excitons could be dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the corresponding electrodes. Therefore, charge extraction and collection could be characterized by the ratio of Jph/Jsat. Under short circuit conditions, the Jph/Jsat of B3T-BT-6F and B3T-TT-6F based devices are 0.91 and 0.95, respectively. As for the maximum power output conditions, Jph/Jsat for B3T-BT-6F and B3T-TT-6F based devices are calculated to be 0.69 and 0.79, respectively, suggesting more efficient charge dissociation and collection for the B3T-TT-6F based device.29,30
The light intensity dependent J–V measurement was performed to study the effects of different NFAs on charge carrier recombination kinetics in the devices. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the power law dependence of the JSC with light intensity (J ∝ Iα) exhibits a linear relation on a double-logarithmic scale. The device based on unfused B3T-TT-6F shows similar fitted α values of 0.970 compared to 0.965 for the device based on fused B3T-BT-6F, suggesting weak bimolecular recombination in both devices. Note that the deviations of α values from unity could also be caused by imbalanced mobilities.31–33Fig. 3c shows the dependence of VOC on the seminatural logarithm of light intensity for the devices based on different NFAs. The slopes were derived from the fitting data to linear models according to the equation VOC ∝ n(KT/q)ln(I), where n is the ideality factor, q is the elementary charge, K is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. Generally, the n value approaching 1 means a negligible trap-assisted recombination in the device.34 Note that there are two types of trap-assisted recombination which will yield either n > 1 (mainly bulk traps) or n < 1 (mainly surface traps).35–37 The device based on unfused B3T-TT-6F shows a slope of 1.33 kT/q, which is smaller than that of the device based on fused B3T-BT-6F (1.42 kT/q), indicating suppressed trap-assisted recombination in the unfused-acceptor based device. These results further support the high performance of the unfused B3T-TT-6F based device discussed above. These slopes of 1.3 to 1.4 kT/q are still high values due to a strong influence of bulk traps, suggesting that there is still potential to remove these traps, pushing the potential PCE even higher. The charge transport properties of the photoactive layer based on different NFAs were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5, ESI†), and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities are 1.40 × 10−4 and 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the B3T-TT-6F based blend film, and 9.64 × 10−5 and 1.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the B3T-BT-6F-based blend film, respectively. Note that the mobility ratios (μe/μh) were reduced for both B3T-BT-6F and B3T-TT-6F based blend films after using DIO as an additive, suggesting the optimized morphology and balanced mobility. As shown in the table, the higher and more balanced mobility (μe/μh = 0.80) of the unfused B3T-TT-6F based blend film is consistent with the improved JSC and FF discussed above. Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) decay measurements were performed to investigate the charge carrier dynamics in the operating devices based on fused or unfused NFAs.38 As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the photocurrent decay lifetimes under short circuit conditions were 1.79 μs for PBDBT:B3T-BT-6F and 1.59 μs for PBDBT:B3T-TT-6F based devices. The relatively shortened charge extraction time of the PBDBT:B3T-TT-6F film could be ascribed to its increased carrier mobility and a more preferable morphology for efficient exciton dissociation discussed above.39 Under VOC conditions, the charge carriers that were excited by the pulsed laser will recombine and their lifetime could be extracted from the decay of the TPV. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the device based on unfused B3T-TT-6F exhibits a longer carrier lifetime in comparison with that based on fused B3T-BT-6F, indicative of the suppressed trap states in the bulk and at the interfaces of the corresponding BHJ film, consistent with the slightly increased VOC. The fiber-like nanostructure was clearly observed in the B3T-TT-6F based film from the TEM image (Fig. 4b), indicating suitable phase separation due to the polymer donor being well mixed with the B3T-TT-6F, which is beneficial for exciton separation and charge transport. In contrast, self-aggregation can be found in the B3T-BT-6F based film, which will result in large phase separation.

(e) Scattering profiles of the in-plane and out-of-plane line-cut profiles of neat NFA films and blend films. 
To further investigate the dimension and isomerization effect on the molecular packing behaviour, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed. As shown in Fig. 4e, for the pristine films of B3T-BT-6F and B3T-TT-6F, an obvious (010) diffraction peak was observed in the out-of-plane direction along with weaker in-plane (100) diffraction peaks, suggesting a more preferential face-on orientation of the two acceptors.40 Similar molecular stacking was observed in Fig. 4c–e after blending with the donor polymer PBDB-T. In going from B3T-TT-6F to B3T-BT-6F, the out-of-plane π–π stacking distance was increased from 3.39 Å to 3.41 Å, with the in-plane lamellar packing decreased from 19.21 Å to 19.03 Å, implying that a denser packing occurred in the unfused B3T-TT-6F. Typically, the crystal coherence length (CCL) calculated via the Scherrer equation was used to illustrate the change in crystallinity.27,41 Compared with the fused B3T-BT-6F with a CCL of 2.71 nm in the (010) direction, B3T-TT-6F exhibits a larger CCL of 3.63 nm, indicating that the unfused thiophene π-bridge strategy is beneficial for the intermolecular packing and the enhancement of crystallinity. However, the change of the CCL presents the opposite situation in the blend film. With regard to the blend film, the B3T-BT-6F:PBDB-T blend film exhibits a CCL of 2.63 nm, which is larger than that of the B3T-TT-6F:PBDB-T blend film (1.79 nm) in the out-of-plane direction, suggesting the over-self-aggregation of the B3T-BT-6F in the blend film,42 which is consistent with the TEM image, resulting in excessive phase separation and inferior device performance.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a class of 2D NFAs, including fused B3T-BT-6F and unfused B3T-TT-6F, were designed and synthesized to investigate the effects of fused or unfused backbones in NFAs on their photovoltaic performance. With thiophene as a π-spacer, unfused B3T-TT-6F exhibits a flexible backbone in solution and it remains flat in the solid state due to the conjugation interaction between the central core building block and the π-spacer, which is beneficial for the morphology control. It is found that the unfused B3T-TT-6F exhibits a broadened solar light coverage, lower bandgap, and higher and more balanced mobility when it is used as an acceptor in OSCs in comparison with fused B3T-BT-6F. As a result, the optimized device using the unfused acceptor shows a champion PCE of 9.94%, coupled with a VOC of 0.819 V, a high JSC of 18.28 mA cm−2, and an FF of 66.41%. In contrast, the device based on the fused acceptor exhibits a lower VOC of 0.807 V, a JSC of 16.53 mA cm−2, and an FF of 63.48%, leading to an inferior efficiency of 8.40%. The success of our molecular design strategy should have important implications for developing efficient NFAs for high performance OSCs.
