    , Accepted 6th January 2017First published on 9th January 2017AbstractNew methanofullerene derivatives have been synthesized and characterized for their electron transport properties. Two new methanofullerenes (PC61BP & HC61NP) have been synthesized by using our reported amine assisted cycloaddition reaction (AACA) method in good yield. PC61BM is also synthesized by using the AACA method for comparison of properties. PC61BP has phenyl group and butyric acid pentyl ester substituents on the C(61) bridging carbon of the cyclopropane ring on the fullerene. HC61NP has a completely different structure where the C(61) bridging carbon is bonded to a proton and a 2-nitro cinnamyl group. Both the products have been well characterized by FTIR, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and NMR for their structures. Their electrochemical properties have been evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Finally, the electron mobilities of the materials have been calculated at room temperature by preparing electron-only devices. PC61BP shows the highest mobility compared to HC61NP and PC61BM and proves to be a promising acceptor material for organic solar cells.
Introduction
Organic solar cells contribute immensely towards renewable energy generation at low cost.1 So far, intensive research efforts for the synthesis of new materials and device development have produced solar cells with high efficiency.2 However, the most concerning aspect of their application on a large scale, which is the impact on the environment due to disposal during material synthesis as well as the fabrication processes, has been neglected. Burke et al. reported unfavourable effects on the environment by the fabrication of organic solar cells.3 They also identified green chemical routes for the synthesis of semiconductor polymers which are helpful in extenuating the negative environmental externalities of manufacturing organic solar cells, especially on a large scale, to cover huge land areas. Several green or less environmentally detrimental methods have been reported for the synthesis of donor semiconductor polymers,4 but there had been no report on acceptors until we first reported the cost effective and eco-friendly triethylamine catalyzed synthesis of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, [6,6]PC61BM monoadducts, under total aerobic conditions.5 We also introduced a novel amine assisted cycloaddition reaction (AACA approach) for the synthesis of diazoalkane intermediates from aromatic and aliphatic hydrazones under very mild homogeneous conditions using amine as a catalyst and further cycloaddition reaction on the fullerene surface to synthesize novel methanofullerenes.6 There is a continuous need for new methanofullerenes with improved properties and cost-effective, less environmentally detrimental, high yielding synthesis processes for large scale applications.
Fullerenes exhibit outstanding electron acceptor properties due to their high electron affinity, low reorganization energy and triply degenerate LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals) to accept up to 6 electrons. This makes them the best materials to be used in organic solar cells with a variety of donor molecules. PCBM has to date been an irreplaceable material in high performance organic solar cells.7 As an alternative material to PCBM with better properties, we have come up with a process for synthesis of higher ester derivatives of PCBM, i.e., [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid pentyl ester (PC61BP) and a novel methanofullerene with completely different types of addends attached exohedrally on fullerenes. In the present paper, we introduce two methanofullerenes synthesized by our AACA approach. Molecule 1 is a higher ester derivative of PC61BM, i.e., PC61BP, and molecule 2 (HC61NP) is synthesized from 2-nitrocinnamaldehyde (Fig. 1). PC61BP has a similar structure to PC61BM with phenyl group and butyric acid pentyl ester substituents on the C(61) bridging carbon of the cyclopropane ring on the fullerene. On the other hand, HC61NP has a completely different structure where the C(61) bridging carbon of the cyclopropane ring on the fullerene is bonded to a proton and a 2-nitro cinnamyl group. As reported earlier, the substitution on fullerenes for the formation of methanofullerenes raises the LUMO levels, and by selecting the type of substituent (electron donating or withdrawing), we can finely tune the LUMO level.8 It will be interesting to study the effect of different types of groups attached to the cyclopropane ring (–H vs. –Ph) on electron transport properties and power conversion efficiency. Materials have been well characterized for their structure and electrochemical properties. The transport properties are also evaluated at room temperature by preparing electron-only devices and compared with PCBM synthesized by the AACA process. Both the materials show promising electron mobility; however, PC61BP shows the highest of them.

Experimental section
Materials and characterization techniques
Pentyl 4-benzoylbutyrate is prepared by reaction of 4-benzoyl butyric acid with 1-pentanol in acidic medium. Pentyl 4-benzoylbutyrate p-tosylhydrazone was prepared as reported previously from pentyl ester of 4-benzoyl butyric acid followed by reaction with p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide.9 4-Benzoyl butyric acid, p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide and all the amines were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. [60]Fullerene was purchased from 1-Material. All solvents were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used after purification and drying.
All the products were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using KBr pellets on Perkin Elmer FTIR Spectrum 2. FTIR spectra were collected over a range of 3500 to 500 cm−1. A background scan in air was performed before scanning the samples. UV-vis spectroscopy measurements were performed on a Shimadzu UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800) using 0.3 mM solution in chloroform. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Jeol 400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The molecular weights of the products were confirmed by MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry on an AB SCIEX using an α-cyano 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrix. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed using a three electrode standard configuration with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, a Ag wire as the reference electrode and a Pt-disc as the working electrode in a 0.1 M TBAPF6 (tetra-n-butylammoniumhexafluorophosphate) in o-dichlorobenzene solution as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The current vs. voltage characteristics were measured on an Autolab potentiostat. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed on a Veeco Nanoscope. Samples were prepared to a final concentration of 0.25 mg mL−1, filtered through 0.5 micron filters, and spin coated on glass substrates.
Synthesis

General method of ester synthesis (Scheme 1a). 
4-Benzoyl butyric acid (5.2 mM) is dissolved in 50 mL of 1-pentanol and ∼2 mL of acetic acid and a few drops of conc. sulfuric acid are added. The temperature of the reaction mixture is increased to refluxing and progress of the reaction is monitored by running TLC in dichloromethane. After ∼6 h, the reaction mixture is concentrated and the product is purified by column chromatography using dichloromethane as a solvent. Ester is obtained as the first fraction. Yield ∼90%.

General method of hydrazone synthesis (Scheme 1a and b). 
Ester (5.2 mM) and p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide (1.2 eq.) are dissolved in methanol (50 mL) and refluxed with stirring for ∼6 h followed by stirring at room temperature overnight. Crystals of hydrazone separate out upon cooling and are collected after washing with cold methanol. Yield ∼99%. FTIR (ν, cm−1): 3111, 1712, 1371, 1228, 1172 cm−1.


General method of synthesis of PC61BP and HC61NP (Scheme 1). 
Pentyl 4-benzoylbutyrate/2-nitrocinnamaldehyde (5.2 mM) and p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide (1.2 eq., 1.162 g, 6.24 mM) are dissolved in methanol (50 mL) and refluxed with stirring for ∼6 h followed by stirring at room temperature overnight. Crystals of hydrazone are formed upon cooling and are collected after washing with cold methanol. This p-tosylhydrazone (0.14 mM) is dissolved in ethyl acetate (10 mL) and cooled down to −10 °C. A catalytic amount of triethylamine (0.7 mL) is added and stirred for three hours at this temperature. A solution of C60 (0.3 eq., 33.6 mg, 0.046 mM) in toluene (10 mL) is added and the temperature is increased to 80 °C. Stirring at this temperature for 18 hours is followed by precipitation with methanol. Solids are collected by centrifugation and loaded onto a silica gel column (200 mm × 18 mm) for purification with toluene. Unreacted fullerene is collected as the first fraction followed by monoadducts ([5,6]PC61BP, 42% yield; [5,6]HC61NP 45% yield). [5,6]Isomers are converted to [6,6]isomers by refluxing in toluene (5 mg mL−1) for 5 hours (yield 100%).

Fabrication of devices

Preparation of zinc oxide (ZnO) precursor solution. 
ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g (4.5 mM) of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3CO2)2·2H2O) in 10 mL of methoxyethanol with addition of 0.254 mL of monoethanolamine (MEA) as a chelating agent (stabilizer). The mixture solution was then stirred on a hot plate at 60 °C for about 2 hours until the solution changed to a clear transparent solution. This solution was then left for a day before use in device fabrication.


Current–voltage characteristics. 
Devices with the ITO/ZnO/PC61BM/Al architecture were constructed and investigated under ambient conditions. Glass plates coated with patterned transparent ITO electrodes are ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, dried and used as anodes. ZnO precursor solution was coated onto the substrates by using a spin coater at 3000 rpm. The substrates were annealed at 250 °C for 30 minutes. Acceptor solution (40 mg mL−1) prepared in chlorobenzene was spin coated on top of the ZnO layer and then dried at 120 °C for 15 min. Finally, the substrates were loaded into a thermal evaporator for the deposition of the cathode material, i.e., a 100 nm Al layer was deposited on top of the acceptor material under high vacuum. The I–V characteristics were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 236 source measure unit.

Results and discussion
So far, the best approach for the cyclopropanation addition to C60 is through the 1,3 dipolar cycloaddition of diazo compounds generated from their tosylhydrazone precursors in pyridine in the presence of sodium methoxide under an inert atmosphere.9 In the present work, we have followed our more promising AACA approach for the cyclopropanation reaction, which is more eco-friendly and occurs under aerobic conditions with excellent yield and purity.5,6 The AACA approach is widely applicable for generation of different types of diazoalkane intermediates and further cycloaddition reaction on fullerene balls in the presence of amine under completely aerobic conditions.
The AACA approach opens up a new energy efficient and less hazardous synthesis process for methanofullerenes, which are irreplaceable materials in various applications and especially in organic solar cells, which is going to be a huge market in the near future requiring bulk synthesis of these materials at the lowest cost.10 Dichloromethane is the preferred solvent over any other chlorinated solvents and amines are green substitutes for pyridine, making this methodology much more eco-friendly with least environmental impact.11,12 To make it a completely green process, in the present study, we have performed the reactions in ethyl acetate in place of dichloromethane for diazoalkane generation.
Diazomethane intermediate 1b is generated from ester 1ain situ in the presence of tert-amine in ethyl acetate at 0 °C under aerobic conditions. A toluene solution of C60 is added and heated at 80 °C for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated and subjected to column chromatography to collect the second band after unreacted fullerene giving a single spot on the TLC. This is the kinetically favourable [5,6]fulleroid (in 13C NMR the bridgehead carbon peak appears at 64 ppm). Refluxing this fulleroid in toluene converts totally to [6,6]PC61BP by thermal isomerisation.
The structure of PC61BP is confirmed by spectroscopic techniques. The FTIR spectrum clearly shows the presence of alkyl C–H stretching at 2957, 2923, and 2855 cm−1, and CO bond stretching at 1727 cm−1. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra further confirm the formation and purity of [6,6]methanofullerene (1), where the peaks corresponding to the bridging carbon and bridgehead carbons appear at 64 and 89 ppm, respectively, in the 13C NMR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum clearly shows all the alkyl and aromatic proton peaks.
Similar to the above, tosylhydrazones 2b were prepared by refluxing 2-nitrocinnamldehyde with p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide in methanol. Upon cooling down the reaction mixture, the crystals of hydrazone separated out and were washed with cooled methanol, dried and used for the next step reaction with fullerene[60]. Similar to the phenyl-diazoenone reaction, aerobic reaction conditions were used for the reaction in the presence of triethyl amine base in cooled ethyl acetate. After 3 hours, a toluene solution of fullerene[60] was added and the temperature was increased to 80 °C. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The reaction mixture was evaporated in a rota-vapor and put on a silica gel column for purification. Product HC61NP was collected after removing a small amount of unreacted fullerene using toluene as an eluent. NMR data completely support the formation and high purity of the mono-adduct with a [6,6]methanofullerene geometry as observed by us in our previous report for such structures.6 The 1H NMR spectrum of HC61NP shows a typical chemical shift at 4.9 ppm for the bridging C(61) proton. Similarly, the 13C NMR chemical shift of the bridging and bridgehead carbons appeared at 67.7 and 86.0 and 86.2 ppm, respectively.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of PC61BP & HC61NP and compared with PCBM in chloroform solution (25 μM) and films. PC61BP and HC61NP show completely overlapping peaks at 328, 404, 435 and 697 nm, confirming the [6,6] addition on the fullerene core akin to [6,6]PC61BM (2a).13 The optical absorption spectra of PC61BP, HC61NP and PCBM were also recorded in thin films (2b). The absorption spectra show extended absorption in the whole visible region. A red shifted absorption band appears at 347 nm with broad absorption between 400 and 800 nm due to aggregation.14

Cyclic-voltammetry (CV) was performed to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the products and compare with PC61BM synthesized by the AACA approach (Fig. 3). CV was performed in dry o-dichlorobenzene using a 0.1 M supporting electrolyte (n-TBAPF6) and a three-electrode system where a platinum disc was used as the working electrode, and a silver-wire and a platinum-wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A ferrocene/ferricenium couple was an internal reference to calibrate the redox potentials. PC61BP and HC61NP show similar behaviour to PC61BM with the first reduction potential located at ∼−1.33 and −1.38 V respectively. Both the products show two reversible reduction potentials and the LUMO energy level, calculated from the onset reduction potential, was found to be ∼−3.6 eV.

The materials were then tested for their electron transport properties at room temperature by making electron-only devices. The electron mobilities of materials were investigated using the simplest and most versatile space charge limited current (SCLC) model for organic semiconductors with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/methanofullerene/Al.15 SCLC measures charge carrier mobility perpendicular to the film plane. The current shows quadratic dependency on voltage at room temperature, which is characteristic of space charge limited current. The energy band diagram of the device is shown in the Scheme 2 inset. The electron mobility can be calculated using the following Mott–Gurney equation16  Herein, JSCLC stands for current density, L is the thickness of the device, V is the applied potential, VBi is the built-in-potential, ε0 is vacuum permittivity and its value is 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1, εr is the permittivity of the active layer in the device and its value is taken as 3.9,17 and μ0 is the electron mobility of fullerene materials.
The charge carrier transport property is an important parameter for solar cell characterization. The cells are fabricated in such a way that the carriers of opposite sign are selectively blocked by choosing the relevant contacts of different work functions. For electron-only (EO) devices, suppression of hole injection can be done by using various metal oxide barriers, such as aluminum oxide (Al2O3), ZnO, TiO2, etc. The single carrier device structure is shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Schematic of hole-only and electron-only devices. 
The mechanism of injection of charge carriers depends on the band-edge mismatch due to which the potential barrier at the interface is created. The work function of ZnO (7.4 eV) does not match with ITO (4.7 eV), which blocks the injection of holes from ITO into the acceptor, so that only electrons are expected to flow. On the other hand, due to the mismatch between the work function of the cathode and acceptor materials, the holes are not allowed to flow. The dark I–V data are plotted as log(JSCLC) vs. log(V) for both PC61BP and HC61NP for 200 nm active layer thickness (see the ESI†). The calculated electron mobility is 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PC61BP, 0.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for HC61NP and 0.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for reference PC61BM. The calculated electron mobility of reference PC61BM is in accordance with the previously reported data for electron only devices.18PC61BP shows better electron mobility than PC61BM. HC61NP shows lower mobility, but it is still much higher or equivalent to previously reported novel fullerene acceptors.19,20
We also investigated the electron mobility of PC61BP and HC61NP at variable thicknesses via electron only device geometries (Scheme 2). The solution in chlorobenzene was prepared with different concentrations of 20, 30 and 40 mg mL−1 and spin coated on the top of the ITO/ZnO substrates, and the charge carrier mobility was determined from the SCLC model. Generally, the charge carrier mobility in organic materials is low due to the structural disorder in the films and decreases with decreasing film thickness. In our case also, the charge carrier mobility was found to decrease with decreasing active layer thickness.21 The calculated electron mobilities for PC61BP with film thicknesses of 200, 90, 75, and 60 nm were 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively (Fig. 4a). Similarly for HC61NP, the electron mobilities were calculated to be 0.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.6 × 10-6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.18 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.68 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 200, 90, 75, and 60 nm film thicknesses, respectively (Fig. 4b). Therefore, the thickness of the organic film is an essential parameter for determining the charge carrier mobility. The decreased film thickness mainly limits the charge carrier injection into the bulk of the material, which leads to a reduced carrier collection rate resulting in decreased charge carrier mobility.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized two new methanofullerenes, i.e., PC61BP and HC61NP, via our eco-friendly AACA methodology for cycloaddition reaction on fullerenes. Both the materials have been synthesized in good yield and purity. The materials have been characterized for their structure using different spectroscopic techniques and finally for their electron transport properties. HC61NP shows quite promising electron mobility but the high mobility of PC61BP makes it a better candidate to be used as an acceptor in organic solar cells in place of PC61BM. The high yielding, eco-friendly and cost effective AACA approach for high performance methanofullerene synthesis provides a low cost methodology which will eventually lower the ultimate organic solar cell cost.
