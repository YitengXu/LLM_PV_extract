    , Accepted 9th February 2020First published on 10th February 2020AbstractThe search for an inexpensive and effective way to improve the thermoelectric properties of organic materials could greatly expand the practical applications of a thermoelectric thin film generator. Here, we adopt a triple treatment of ethylene glycol ((CH2OH)2), ethanol (C2H5OH) doping and (CH2OH)2 dedoping to tune the micro stacking structure of PEDOT:PSS. The obtained PEDOT:PSS thermoelectric film material has a highest power factor (PF) of up to 330.597 μW m−1, which stems from the high Seebeck coefficient (S) and conductivity (σ). Furthermore, we fabricated a thermoelectric generator to explore the photothermal conversion process of the solar energy. The maximum power output of the home-made module device with solar energy as the heat source reached 9.8 nW. This work is a prospective experiment for the development of solar photothermal conversion based on such a thin film and device.
1. Introduction
Solar energy is a clean, efficient and abundant energy source, and one of the main approaches to utilize solar energy is conversion to electric energy.1 Basically, the utilization of solar energy is still very rare at present. Its utilization is mainly applied in photovoltaics through monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon solar cells which have a power conversion efficiency (PCE) close to 25.2%, but the utilization of solar energy in the thermoelectric field is very limited. Photovoltaic devices often use visible sunlight,2 while thermoelectric devices need a heat source from infrared sunlight. We know that visible light (380–760 nm) accounts for 45% of total solar energy, and infrared light (800–3000 nm) accounts for 42% of total solar energy.3 If the utilization of solar energy can be expanded from the visible light area to the infrared area through thermoelectric devices, the conversion efficiency of solar-to-electric energy will be greatly improved. In addition, in the process of photoelectric conversion, the efficiency of a solar cell is directly affected by the intensity of solar radiation or other environmental changes. Fortunately, the productivity of a thermoelectric generator would not be seriously affected by the weather, location or other conditions.4
Thermoelectric conversion of solar energy requires functional materials with a thermoelectric conversion effect. Generally, these thermoelectric materials are evaluated by the thermoelectric merit value ZT. ZT = S2σ/κ, where S, σ, and κ are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, respectively.5 Excellent thermoelectric materials require a high conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient, as well as low thermal conductivity. Nowadays, inorganic thermoelectric materials have high conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient but huge thermal conductivity; while organic thermoelectric materials have low thermal conductivity, but their electrical conductivity is depressed. In general, thermoelectric materials with simultaneous high electrical conductivity, high Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity are in great demand. Selecting conductive organic materials is an effective way to achieve a high power factor, PF (PF = S2σ).6,7 Organic conductive materials have attracted more and more attention in the field of thermoelectricity due to their printable, flexible characteristics.8 Among these, PEDOT:PSS,9 PPy,10 and MEH-PPV11 are organic thermoelectric materials with a high thermal power factor, and the thermal stability of PEDOT is the most widely studied. To be honest, the thermoelectric property of commercial PEDOT:PSS is not satisfactory due to its inherent low electronic conductivity. There are several ways to improve the thermoelectric properties of PEDOT:PSS (S and σ). For example: pretreatment of PEDOT:PSS by doping with (1) high boiling point organic solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide), or (2) high dielectric constant solvents (concentrated sulfuric acid, salt solution).12,13 These methods can increase the density of states of the organic molecules,14 promote the separation of PEDOT from PSS,15 or modify the carrier transport path to optimize the thermoelectric properties.16 However, approaches of this kind carry with them various well-known limitations, and films with a high ZT value (the maximum value is about 0.42) are usually prepared by spin coating, which is not suitable for large-scale fabrication.
Notably, aiming at solar energy photothermal utilization, countries around the world are conducting this kind of research, whose purpose is to collect more solar energy from artificial high-temperature parts, and to improve the thermal diffusion factor. Chen et al. reported that they had developed planar solar thermal devices which could generate 14.6% electricity,17 and they advocated that the use of solar spectral absorption devices and new concepts of nanostructural thermal elements could improve the efficiency of the devices. On the other hand, Baranowski and others suggested that a theoretical conversion efficiency of 30.6% can be achieved at 1500 °C by using the analytical heat of solar energy concentration and an element with a ZT value of 2.18 In this case, because the working environment is up to 1500 °C, it is necessary to design a solar collector that can form this high temperature and maintain high-temperature thermal working conditions. At the same time, it is necessary to develop thermoelectric components that can produce the best ZT value of power generation efficiency at high temperature.19 Lately, Olsen from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory explained the design and fabrication of efficient thermoelectric devices consisting of solar collectors and thermal elements, and explained the thermal power generation and life of thermoelectric devices when measuring the economic effect of power generation20 Han Shengyou of the Korea Institute of Machinery used solar energy collector thermal elements to test their performance, and concentrated on solar energy balloons to generate power for thermoelectric modules.21 He obtained about 0.74 Watts of power output at 50 °C.22 The above studies focus mainly on high-temperature research into solar energy concentration; there are few studies on the photothermal utilization of non-concentrated low-temperature and room-temperature solar energy.
Herein, we adopt PEDOT:PSS modified by a (CH2OH)2 doping, C2H5OH doping, and (CH2OH)2 immersion triple treatment process, which greatly enhances the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. In addition to the high integrated absorptivity (α) of the solar spectrum and low emissivity (ε) of the infrared, an excellent thermoelectric material can also be produced on a large scale at low cost. Theoretically, Ni is a promising n-type metallic thermoelectric material because of its high electrical conductivity and excellent Seebeck coefficient. With these aims in view, we have developed a process for the deposition of nickel (Ni) metal. Ni possesses a high electrical conductivity and an excellent Seebeck coefficient among metals. Because of thin film characteristics, the temperature difference is not large in a thin film device. There is less application and research into using photothermals for a thin film thermoelectric device. On the other hand, the films are characteristically flexible and bendable, and are easy to produce with large area. They are one of a class of materials that have great application prospects. We found that although the films have small temperature differences, they have a large temperature gradient field. The temperature gradient field can produce a large polarization field, so the temperature gradient polarization effect further enhances the performance of thermoelectric thin film devices. Therefore, a homemade organic–inorganic thermoelectric generator which is composed of optimized PEDOT:PSS as P-legs and Ni as N-legs, and which uses solar radiation as a heating source, exhibits a potential power output of 9.8 nW.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and materials
PEDOT:PSS (M122 PH1000, in the ratio 1.0–1.3%) was purchased from Clevios Company. (CH2OH)2 and C2H5OH (purity 99%) were purchased from China Pharmaceutical Company. Ni evaporator (purity 99.99%) was purchased from Beijing Zhongjin Research Corporation. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Sample preparation
(CH2OH)2 and C2H5OH are doped in PEDOT:PSS precursor solution in sequence to improve the thermoelectric properties of PEDOT:PSS films. In detail, (CH2OH)2 is first added into 1 ml of PH1000. Then, the mixture is stirred for 24 h. After that, 3 ml of C2H5OH and deionized water with a volume ratio of 1:2 are added to 1 ml of the mixture of the above solution obtained in the previous step. Then the mixture is sonicated for 2 h. Then, it is drop casted on a glass substrate which is pretreated by sonication in detergent, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. The film is then annealed on a hot plate at 65 °C for 30 min. In the following step, the annealed film is immersed in (CH2OH)2 for 100 min and washed with deionized water to remove any residual (CH2OH)2. The films are finally dried with an N2 flow before further measurements. PEDOT:PSS film of 1.45 μm thickness is obtained, and the PEDOT:PSS molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1(a).

2.3 Device preparation
Different volume fractions of (CH2OH)2 and C2H5OH are added into a milliliter of PEDOT:PSS, respectively. The solution is spread on a clean large area glass substrate, annealed in air at 65 °C for 3 h, then crystallized into a thin film. The thin film is treated with glycol to obtain a self-supporting flexible film. In order to explore the application of a thermoelectric generator in the field of photothermals, the above self-supporting thin film is transferred to the glass substrate. A p-leg with a specification of 2.5 cm × 0.3 cm × 1.5 μm is fabricated. The Ni equivalent to the p-leg is evaporated and plated with n-leg (2.5 cm × 0.3 cm × 150 nm), and silver paste is selected as the connecting agent in the circuit. The device structure is shown in Fig. 1(b).
2.4 Characterizations and measurements
In order to minimize the experimental uncertainties under direct sunlight, a solar simulator (Newport Co. Oriel Xenon Arc lamp) is used as the light source. The performance parameters of the solar simulator are based on the ASTM standard (ASTM G-173, 2011), including spectral match (fraction of ideal percentage) of 0.7–1.25, non-uniformity of irradiance up to 5% and temporal instability up to 5%. Seebeck coefficient measurement is carried out on a homemade set-up consisting of a ceramic wafer heating stage, and voltage and temperature controlling system. The conductivity, carrier density and mobility of the films are calculated by measuring the Hall effect on an ECOPIA HMS-5500 system. UV-visible spectra are recorded on a UV-3600 (Shimadzu, Japan). Film morphology is characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM Bruker Company). A paramagnetic signal is obtained through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, Bruker A300).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Thermoelectric properties of treated PEDOT:PSS

Fig. 2(a) shows the thermoelectric characteristics of different PEDOT:PSS films under ambient conditions. The electrical conductivities of original PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PSS mixed with (CH2OH)2 (PEDOT-EG), PEDOT:PSS mixed with alcohol and EG (PEDOT:PSS-EG and EtOH) are 4.27 S cm−1, 43.3 S cm−1 and 890.7 S cm−1, respectively. After treatment by immersing the PEDOT:PSS-EtOH and EG film into EG, the electrical conductivity is enhanced to 1478.577 S cm−1. Simultaneously, the Seebeck coefficient of the original thermoelectric films increases from 12.74 μV K−1 to 33.52 μV K−1, 40.29 μV K−1, and 47.16 μV K−1. Correspondingly, the PF are calculated to be 0.069, 61.037, 144.586, and 330.597 μW m−1, respectively. It is suggested that this is induced by phase separation between PEDOT chains and PSS after EG immersion. The acting force is substantially reduced between PEDOT and the PSS molecular chain, causing the non-conducting polyanion PSS molecular chain to partially dedope, thus increasing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, after EtOH addition and post-treatment with EG, which will be demonstrated in detail in the following sections. Fig. 2(b) shows that the Seebeck coefficient, conductivity and power factor change at different temperatures. It can be seen that the conductivity decreases with increasing temperature. The modified PEDOT:PSS film exhibits obvious semi-metallic properties. Interestingly, the EG, EtOH doping and EG post-treatment can simultaneously increase S and σ. Table 1 summarizes the carrier concentration (n) and mobility (μ) of PEDOT:PSS film and the films after three chemical treatments. The mobility and carrier concentration of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film are 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.169 × 1020 cm−3, respectively. Compared with the pristine PEDOT:PSS film, the mobility of the films treated with EG is significantly improved, at 1.59 cm2 V−1 s−1. After further treatment using EtOH, the Seebeck coefficient and conductivity of the EG-sample are both improved. The carrier concentration decreases and the mobility increases after the incorporation of EtOH: the specific values are 5.99 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.269 × 1020 cm−3, respectively. The change in the carrier concentration and mobility may be due to the energy filtering effect which can filter out a carrier with low energy and low mobility after doping with EtOH. Finally, the mobility and carrier concentration are 4.579 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.016 × 1020 cm−3, respectively, after immersion treatment. They have reached their maximum values. The concentrations of the four kinds of films are comparable, but the mobility is greatly improved. We believe that the enhancement in mobility of PEDOT:PSS film makes the main contribution to the improvement in electrical conductivity.

In order to unravel the mechanism of the improvement in thermoelectric properties of PEDOT:PSS film after these treatments, we obtained the vibrational spectra with Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The band at 1630 cm−1 is due to asymmetric stretching in the thiophene ring and the symmetric stretch vibration is found at 1385 cm−1.23 The peak at 1048 cm−1 is due to the C–O–C stretching vibration in ethylenedioxy. At the same time, C–S–C tensile deformation in the thiophene ring will cause peaks at 919 cm−1 and 829 cm−1. See Table 2 for the infrared band assignments for pristine and treated PEDOT:PSS samples. In addition, SO and S–O stretching vibrations in PSS will have characteristic peaks at 1193 cm−1 and 1164 cm−1.23 The weaker absorption bands may be related to the low concentration of PSS.24 In addition, we monitored the changes in peak position in the spectra of the thin films after three treatments compared with the pristine thin film. The results show that after adding EG, the hydroxyl peak at 3398 cm−1 blue shifts to 3436 cm−1, indicating that intermolecular hydrogen bonding has occurred,25 and CC–O and CC on the thiophene ring shift slightly after treatment, which indicates that PEDOT and EG intermolecular hydrogen may be generated. We believe this may be the reason why EG can promote the phase separation of PEDOT and PSS.

Fig. 3(b) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PEDOT:PSS films under different processing conditions. For the XRD pattern of the original sample, the diffraction peaks at low angles of 4.7° and 13.1° correspond to the lamellar stacking of PEDOT in the (100) plane, while the other two peaks at 17.5° and 25.0° are attributed to amorphous stacking of PSS in the (010) plane. The observed results are in good agreement with the reported results.26 After treatment with (CH2OH)2, the full width at half maxima (HWHM) of the diffraction peak at about 3.8° becomes narrower and shifts slightly to 4.2°, indicating that the crystallinity of the PEDOT molecule in the sample improves. After adding EtOH and EG post-treatment, it is found that the diffraction peak of PSS becomes lower. Block, et al. found that ethanol and ethylene glycol post-treatment can combine the PSS molecules well to remove PSS.27 Similarly, this effect causes the first two diffraction peaks to shift to lower angles, and the HWHMs to become narrower.
EPR measurements, shown in Fig. 3(c), are carried out to characterize the properties of polarons in different films.5,21 As the chemical doping process continues, the EPR signal of the film gradually decreases. There are conducting host molecules (PEDOT) and non-conducting PSS molecules in PEDOT:PSS solution. In the experiment, the doping of EG or et-OH and the de-doping by EG have different effects on each component of PEDOT:PSS solution. EG can form a hydrogen bond with different PEDOT chains, which can reduce the distance between PEDOT chain molecules, thus reducing the loss of carrier jumping transmission between chains. As a monohydroxy molecule, et-OH can combine with a sulfonic group in PSS to form a more hydrophilic salt than the PEDOT chain, which can be removed after EG post-treatment. Proper removal of PSS is beneficial to increasing the effective carrier concentration per unit volume. Briefly, these treatments adjust the thermoelectric properties of PEDOT:PSS at the molecular level. Whether reducing the distance between PEDOT chains or removing the non-conducting PSS, it is beneficial to increase the crystallinity of the organic polymers and promote the molecular transformation from a localized state to a delocalized state. In conclusion, the decrease in EPR signal is due to the decrease in ions and the increase in the delocalization state in the triple-treated PEDOT:PSS films.
In addition, in order to characterize whether PEDOT:PSS film is suitable as a light-to-heat conversion material, we performed a UV absorption test on it, as shown in Fig. 3(d). In addition to visible light, PEDOT:PSS also has very good absorption in the near infrared region, which means that PEDOT:PSS uses solar energy very efficiently.
The addition of dopants can also affect the morphology of the film, leading to an alteration in the film's thermoelectric properties. Fig. 4 shows the AFM images before and after film processing. In the phase diagram of the original film, there is no obvious phase separation before processing. However, after processing it is obvious that the PEDOT chain and the PSS chain are separated from each other, producing more fibrous interconnected conductive PEDOT chains. The degree of phase separation is related to the electrical conductivity. According to the literature,14,28 the bright region in Fig. 4 is conductive PEDOT, and the dark region is insulating PSS. Removing PSS results in the stacking of PEDOT molecules, which can promote carrier transport.

3.2 Thermoelectric properties of Ni
In order to achieve excellent thermoelectric performance based on PEDOT:PSS film, Ni is selected as n-type legs in the thermoelectric modules. Fig. 5 shows the thermoelectric properties of Ni in the horizontal direction under different film thicknesses. The overall data shows that the Ni film is relatively stable as an n-type material. The Seebeck coefficients of Ni films with different thicknesses of 50, 100 and 150 nm are −18.66 μV K−1, −17.61 μV K−1, and −18.42 μV K−1, while the corresponding conductivities are 13080 S cm−1, 14020 S cm−1 and 13640 S cm−1 at 50, 100 and 150 nm, respectively. To be economic and practicable, Ni with a thickness of 150 nm was selected.

3.3 Utilization of module devices under photothermal conditions
Motivated by the outstanding thermoelectric properties of both p-type and n-type materials, we proposed a thermoelectric module with 6 pairs of n–p legs on a glass substrate (Fig. 6(a)). For the organic–inorganic fully integrated module device, we have illustrated the effect of the module device on the photothermal conversion process.29,30 Before measuring the thermoelectric performance of the module device under light, we apply thermal insulation paint to the cold end of the module device to prevent heat diffusing from the hot end to the cold end, thereby forming a large temperature difference between the cold and hot ends. With an increase in illumination time, both the temperature gradient (ΔT) and the hot-side temperature (Thot) increase, and the highest ΔT can reach 11.8 K (see Table 3). In detail, Fig. 6(a) exhibits the open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the device using sunlight as the heat source. With the increase in Thot and ΔT, the Seebeck voltage and short circuit current increase gradually. A ΔT of 11.8 K is the maximum temperature gradient originating from solar thermal radiation when the temperature at the hot side is 328 K, and the Seebeck voltage attains 3.17 mV and the short circuit current reaches 8.4 μA. The connection of PEDOT:PSS and Ni shows an accumulation of output thermovoltage. If a better light absorption concentrator is used, the device temperature will continue to rise, and the ΔT will increase further. Therefore, a simulation experiment of the device's thermoelectric conversion effect using a heater as a heat source (Fig. 6(b)) was proposed. It can be seen that the temperature of the device increases with an increase in the heating temperature, and the device temperature can vary from 328 K to 348 K. With the increase in ΔT, the voltage and short-circuit current of the device continually increase. When the maximum temperature goes up to 348 K, the Seebeck voltage can reach 5.06 mV and the short-circuit current is 10.6 μA, and compared with Fig. 6(a), the Seebeck voltage and short-circuit current undergo greater fluctuations. This indicates that the photothermal conversion method can enhance the stability of the power output process of the module.

The power output of the module with different external resistances is measured at the above temperature (Fig. 6(c)). The power output is calculated through Pmax = U2/(4R), where U is the experimental voltage and R is the external resistance.31,32 It should be noted that the real part of the output power is the result of photothermal conversion, and the virtual part is the external heat source. The results show that the output power is magnified with the increase in Thot and ΔT. Specifically, when the high temperature terminal is at 328 K, the power output of the module device is 9.8 nW. However, a conventional power output test shows that the maximum power output of the module device is 23 nW under 348 K. These results also reveal the application prospects of the module device in photothermal utilization. Furthermore, we have measured the air stability of the thermoelectric modules. The module with the power output of 11 nW is stored in air with a humidity of 65%. After 100 hours, the module shows a power output of 11 nW, which is the same as the original value without degradation. This indicates the module shows good air stability.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a thermoelectric generator with p-legs of high-performance PEDOT:PSS and n-legs of Ni to improve the utilization of solar energy photothermal conversion. According to the order of (CH2OH)2, C2H5OH doping and (CH2OH)2 post-treatment, we modify pristine PEDOT:PSS material, and obtain a film with the highest PF of 330.597 μW m−1 at room temperature. At the molecular level, these treatments improve the crystalline properties of organic polymer molecules, optimize the carrier transport path, and finally obtain high-performance films. On the basis of the above work, we made a modular device to explore the photothermal conversion process of thermoelectric generators. Moreover, the maximum power output of the device is 9.8 nW in the process of photothermal conversion. The work in this paper provides experimental support for the development of solar energy photothermal conversion in the field of thermoelectric materials and devices.
