    , Accepted 20th April 2018First published on 21st April 2018AbstractThrough the coupling of central and terminal naphthalene diimide functionalities, a unique non-fullerene electron acceptor, coded as N10, was designed, synthesized, characterized and applied in solution-processable bulk-heterojunction devices. The target N10 displayed good solubility, excellent thermal stability and energy levels complementing those of the conventional donor polymer poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT). An excellent power conversion efficiency of 7.65% was obtained in simple BHJ devices (P3HT:N10 1:1.2), which is the highest observed so far for NDI core-based non-fullerene acceptors.
There is clearly a growing global demand for energy and this demand is driven by the increasing population and the increasing standards of living. The natural, renewable energy resources, such as water, wind and solar energy, are particularly attractive due to their low carbon emission nature. Of such natural resources, sun light is seen as the prime candidate given its abundance on our planet. The capturing of solar power through inorganic and organic photovoltaic devices is a phenomenon that has been extensively studied in the past three decades. The organic devices in particular are a promising next-generation green energy resource as they offer unique advantages, such as flexibility, low-cost, light weight and solution processability, over their former counterpart.1 The development of organic, otherwise termed bulk-heterojunction, solar cells in terms of either materials’ design or device fabrication strategies has attracted a large number of researchers from around the globe. Such bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices recently achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 11% with the conventional fullerene acceptors,2 thereby suggesting that fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and its C71 analogue (PC71BM), are currently the best possible electron acceptors for organic photovoltaic applications.
Not only are the fullerene derivatives compatible with a number of conventional and conjugated polymeric donors, such as poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT), they also exhibit high solubility and good electron mobility together with an ability to form a favourable nanoscale network with versatile donor components.3 Despite such merits, these fullerene derivatives are afflicted with a number of inherent disadvantages such as limited absorption in the visible region, restricted chemical and energetic tuning via structural modification, and greater electron affinity that can result in a low open-circuit voltage.4 These drawbacks encourage researchers to carry out research in finding new structures that can serve as non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) materials. However, such new compounds not only should retain the properties such as strong accepting strength, solubility and thermal stability, but must also address the limitations of fullerene acceptors, such as structure flexibility, electronic tunability and visible region absorption.
In regards to the design of NFAs, two types of materials, namely small molecules and polymers, can be developed. However, it is arguable that the development of small molecules provides a number of advantages over the development of their polymeric counterparts. Such benefits can be realised in terms of synthetic ease, purification strategies, and less end-group contamination. Moreover, given the ease of making changes to the structure of small molecules, the parameters such as the open circuit voltage can be tuned using a variety of building blocks, such as donors and acceptors. There are a number of structural types that have been reported in the recent literature where a variety of donor and acceptor units have been combined to generate NFAs.5 However, NFAs based on an acceptor–acceptor–acceptor (A–A–A) format, naphthalene diimide (NDI) core-based in particular, have not been explored to a significant extent, though they are highly promising targets given their strong electron accepting capacity.6 The inclusion of the NDI functionality in a given target is advantageous in terms of enhancing the solubility of that particular target together with the control of photo-physical properties. Taking into account the literature precedence, our success with the design and development of NDI core-based NFAs,7 and the advantages provided by the NDI moiety, herein we report the design, synthesis and characterisation of a novel NFA, 7,7′-(((2,7-dioctyl-1,3,6,8-tetraoxo-1,2,3,6,7,8-hexahydrobenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-4,9-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(2-octylbenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (N10), where we have used NDI functionalities at the central and peripheral positions (Scheme 1). The design of N10 gave us a highly conjugated molecule with the presence of a number of alkyl chains (all the chains were considered to be identical (-octyl) from a molecular symmetry point of view) in order to demonstrate the excellent film forming capacity without crystallization occurring in the film. Our idea of designing N10 was validated as the solution-processable BHJ devices based on the blend of P3HT:N10 (1:1.2 w/w) afforded PCE values as high as 7.65%, the highest result for NDI core-based NFAs. Moreover, the reported work is the first effort that has been carried out by placing three NDI functionalities in an A–A–A fashion. The present work is a continuation of our research interest in the design and development of small molecule NFAs for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications.8
 Scheme 1  Molecular structure of the newly designed and synthesized NFA N10 and its synthetic protocol. 
The newly designed N10 was synthesized via a Suzuki coupling reaction between 2-octyl-7-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone and 4,9-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone. The reaction was conducted in a dioxane:water solvent mixture and was run at 100 °C for 24 h using cesium fluoride (CsF) as the base and the [1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) complex with dichloromethane [Pd(dppf)Cl2·CH2Cl2] as the catalyst (Scheme 1). The target N10 was purified via simple column chromatography and its structure was confirmed using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies together with MALDI-TOF and elemental analysis (for synthetic details and experimental spectra, see the ESI†). N10 was found to be soluble in a range of common organic solvents, such as chloroform and dichlorobenzene, thus fulfilling one of the major requirements of organic semiconductors to be fabricated in solution-processable OPV devices.
The optical absorption spectra of N10 were measured in solution, and in pristine and blend films (see Fig. 1). In solution, N10 exhibited two absorption peaks (362 nm and 382 nm) in the high energy area together with a strong shoulder peak at 543 nm, with the latter being assigned as the absorption maximum (λmax). In the thin solid film state, the absorption peaks were slightly broader and λmax was red-shifted by ∼51 nm, suggesting that there exists an effective π–π stacking in the solid state. When N10 was blended with P3HT, the resultant film displayed strong absorption over most of the visible region, even tailing into the infrared region. This result indicates that there is an efficient charge transfer transition between the donor and acceptor components which is usually considered advantageous for improved device outcome.

In order to understand the distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) densities, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT calculations, which were carried out using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs9 and the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, indicated that the HOMO and the LUMO densities are well separated, with the former lying on the phenyl and thiophene units together with the central NDI functionality and the latter residing on the peripheral NDI units (Fig. S1, ESI†). Such separation of theoretical densities is considered ideal for intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition and ensures an efficient electron flow upon photo irradiation. Furthermore, the nature of ICT using the time-dependent DFT calculations (TD-DFT) was also elucidated. The TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the optimized ground state geometry of N10 at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The TD-DFT calculations provide excitation energies and oscillator strengths (denoted by f) of the lowest singlet states. The computed absorption spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†) shows the main transition peak at 660.95 nm, which is ascribed to the HOMO → LUMO transition (excited state 1: 1.8758 eV; 660.95; f = 0.6234). Experimentally, the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels were estimated and calculated, respectively, using a combination of photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) and UV-vis spectroscopy on pristine films. The PESA curve gave an estimated HOMO of −5.70 eV, whereas the LUMO level was calculated to be −4.15 eV, thus providing an optical band gap of 1.55 eV. The energy level diagram depicts these values and indicates that the energy levels well complement those of the conventional donor polymer P3HT (for the PESA curve and energy level diagram, see Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 2, respectively). We further believed that thermal stability is required of an organic semiconductor to allow a photovoltaic device to survive fabrication and operate under harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, we conducted thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. Both the analyses revealed that N10 is a thermally stable chromophore which can be processed at high temperature, for instance 100 °C, if required. For TGA and DSC curves, see Fig. S4, ESI.†

Because of its suitable optoelectronic properties, good film forming capability, solubility, and thermal and chemical stabilities, N10 was used as an n-type material with the standard donor polymer P3HT as the p-type semiconductor in BHJ devices. We chose a very simple device architecture to start with (ITO/PEDOT: PSS (38 nm)/active layer/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm)), where the active layer was a solution-processed blend of N10 and P3HT. The active layer was deposited by spin coating the blend solution of N10 and P3HT in o-dichlorobenzene (donor:acceptor 1:1.2 (w/w)). The optimum layer thickness was found to be in the range of ∼70 nm. The choice of a high boiling point solvent, e.g. o-dichlorobenzene, was primarily made due to a number of advantages, such as smooth and consistent films avoiding formation of large-scale crystals and easy device processing, it offers.
The annealed blend films that used an optimal ratio of 1:1.2 (P3HT:N10) gave excellent performance and the best photovoltaic cell parameters: the values of Voc, short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE reached 0.99 V, 12.08 mA cm−2, 0.64, and 7.65%, respectively. The as-cast, unannealed devices afforded reasonable and encouraging photovoltaic performance. A PCE of 4.78% was achieved for the unannealed devices. This result is among the highest PCE values attained using the NDI core-based NFAs. It is notable to mention that at this stage we did not use any barrier or electron transporting layer between the Ca electrode and the active layer that is typically used to remove any holes and enhance the device performance. The use of such strategies to fabricate devices using N10 is also underway and the results will be published soon. The standard P3HT:PC61BM device gave 3.03% efficiency when fabricated under similar conditions. The respective current–voltage (J–V) curves for the best devices are represented in Fig. 3, and Table S1 and Fig. S5 (ESI†) show the overall J–V characteristics and a histogram of the device characteristics, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Characteristic current–density vs. voltage (J–V) curves for the best BHJ devices based on N10 in blends with P3HT. Solid and dashed lines correspond to pre-annealing (unannealed blend (UB)) and post-annealing (annealed blend (AB)) conditions, respectively, under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G), [blend ratio = 1:1.2 w/w (D/A)]. Device structure was: ITO/PEDOT: PSS (38 nm)/active layer (∼70 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). 
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement of the active layer indicated a strong and broad response over the entire visible region (350–900 nm), with the maximum IPCE ∼60% at 618 nm. The broadness of the IPCE spectrum indicated a superior blending of the donor and acceptor domains, excellent light-harvesting, and that both the components made a considerable contribution to the IPCE and Jsc (for the IPCE curve, see Fig. S6, ESI†). Furthermore, the excellent properties of the well-knitted blend surface were confirmed via atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis which was conducted in the tapping mode. The AFM analysis revealed a smooth blend surface for the unannealed film (surface roughness = 1.2 nm), whereas some grains were observed for the annealed blend surface (surface roughness = 2.1 nm). Such granular surfaces are considered to be responsible for providing a better, and in fact more desirable, morphology when compared with amorphous and regular morphologies, and are often desirable for superior device performance. The superiority of the blend surface suggested that N10 possesses a great ability to be miscible with a variety of donor counterparts, for instance the conventional donor polymer P3HT.
We further carried out transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis where a well-interweaved blend surface was noticed, a result that corroborates the higher device outcome and AFM analysis (for AFM and TEM curves, see Fig. 4). It is notable to mention that the well intermixing of the donor and acceptor semiconducting components is one of the key factors to achieve reasonable device outcome as is the case of N10. The reported device performance is among the highest efficiency values reported in the current literature where a number of acceptor units have been conjoined to design a NFA target based on an A–A–A format. This further emphasizes the utility of the design concept used in N10 and suggests that other acceptor groups at the terminals will be worth examining.

For AFM images, unannealed (left) and annealed (right) surfaces are shown. For TEM images, two scale bars, 500 nm (left) and 200 nm (right), are represented for a better view. 
In summary, a NDI core-based NFA, N10, with terminal NDI functionalities was designed and synthesized. N10 possessed a planar format, good solubility, energy levels complementing those of the standard donor polymer P3HT, and excellent thermal stability. Owing to its excellent abilities, such as strong light-harvesting ability and well-interlaced blend morphology, N10 was applied in solution-processable BHJ devices as an n-type semiconducting component. The P3HT: N10 blended films provided a very encouraging PCE of 7.65%, a result that not only is among the leading numerals in the current literature but also advocates that the studied format is very promising for the futuristic engineering of NFAs.
