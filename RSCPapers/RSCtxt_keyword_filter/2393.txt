    , Accepted 12th February 2020First published on 28th February 2020AbstractMultiple absorbers that function in different absorption regions (near infra-red (NIR) and UV-Visible (UV-Vis)) have been widely used in solar cell applications to enhance the light-harvesting. Herein, two special co-sensitizing Models 1 and 2, which feature either saturated dye IQ21 or saturated co-sensitizer S2, have been added to a TiO2 surface to explore the effect of the altered sensitizing sequence, namely the co-sensitizing ratio of IQ21/S2 and S2/IQ21 on the electrostatic potential variation (ΔV), electron injection efficiency (ηinj′), and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), using density functional theory and first-principle molecular dynamics simulations. The ΔV related to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is insensitive in both Models 1 and 2. However, the absorption (λabs) and ηinj′ associated with the short-circuit density (Jsc) display a significant deviation (the λabs for 1 is red-shifted compared to that of 2, and the ηinj′ for 1 is improved by 56%). Meanwhile, Model 1 manifests a suppressed FRET and potentially favors co-sensitizer S2 functioning as the electron-injector and not the energy-donor. Another two possible Models 3 and 4 that feature a reduced adsorption of IQ21 and S2 relative to 1 and 2 were considered further, and the result mirrors the main trend in 1 and 2, except for the ηinj′. Overall, it implies that sensitizing a larger absorber with NIR features to saturate it first, then introducing a smaller absorber with UV-Vis features, can potentially improve the electron injection and diminish electron–hole recombination considerably. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of the active role of an optimized sensitizing sequence to improve the conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Since dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were proposed in 1991 by O’Regan and Grätzel,1 this technology has attracted much interest among both scientists and engineers around the world. Dye as one of the most critical components should harvest as much light as possible, both in the spectral response range and the intensity of absorption.2 Metal organic complexes have favorable near infra-red (NIR) light absorption and slow electron–hole recombination properties,3,4 whereas their counterparts, metal-free organic dyes, have strong absorption around the UV-Visible (UV-Vis) region and a structural diversity that has given rise to increasing attention.5 However, a single absorber does not achieve panchromatic absorption across the solar spectrum unless the device absorbs all incident light.6 To improve the conversion efficiency η (η = Jsc × Voc × FF/Pin, where Jsc is the short-circuit current density, Voc is the open-circuit photovoltage, FF is the fill factor, and Pin is the power of the incident light), co-sensitizing multiple kinds of absorbers has been proposed for improving light-harvesting and diminishing electron–hole recombination.7–10 Using this strategy, the record η of 14% was achieved in 2015.11
Generally, devices with different co-sensitizing absorbers are achieved by step12 and synergetic13 methods. The step approach involves first sensitizing the photoanode by one dye to saturation and then introducing the co-sensitizer to fill the remaining attachment sites. By contrast, the synergetic approach is completed by sensitizing a photoanode with various kinds of dyes and co-sensitizers in an optimized ratio simultaneously.
It has been verified that the co-sensitizing strategy manifests the advantages of filling more vacancies on the photoanode surface, suppressing the aggregation of molecules, improving the light-harvesting capability, impeding the electron–hole recombination,14 and preventing the approach of oxidized species in the electrolyte to the photoanode surface.15 Furthermore, it has been found that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs during the light radiation in the co-sensitizing system,16–21 where dye and co-sensitizer produce an energy cascade, and the UV-Vis absorber can transfer the fluorescence energy to the NIR absorber via dipole–dipole interactions.22,23
In previous theoretical calculations for the single dye sensitized system, the static electronic structure of the dye@substrate interface and the dynamics of electron transfer, which by time propagation of the wave function,24 survival probability,25 Tully's surface hopping and density matrix26 method, have been efficiently modeled to qualitatively/quantitatively resolve the interfacial coupling. For instance, Persson et al. investigated the static electron injection time by computing the mixing of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) on the sensitizer with the manifold virtue orbitals on TiO2.27 Troisi et al. proposed a model which quickly screens out prominent dyes via evaluating the orbital symmetry and a quality factor Q (representing the propensity of insulating the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) on the dye from the LUMO on the semiconductor).28 Prezhdo et al. proposed the procedure of separating the nonadiabatic and adiabatic electron transfer to study the detailed picture of the photoinduced process.29 On the other hand, the energy transfer,30 charge transfer,31 absorption property,30 and interfacial energy level alignment32 in co-sensitizing systems have been well described to provide a deep comprehension from the atomic scale. De Angelis et al. proposed a computational model to evaluate the FRET rate between metal–organic complexes,30,33 Tateyama et al. studied the adsorption energy of a dye and co-sensitizer located in varied binding positions on a TiO2 surface,34 and in our previous work, we explored the influence of an oligothiophene-functionalized co-sensitizer on the electron injection efficiency.31
In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), and first-principle molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the effect of the co-sensitizing ratio on the electronic properties of dyes@TiO2 heterogeneous interfaces. The considered prototype co-sensitizing system consists of a D–A–π–A architecture indoline dye IQ2135–37 (Fig. 1(a)) and D–π–A motif tribenzylamine co-sensitizer S236–39 (Fig. 1(b)), where the former is the NIR absorber and the latter is the UV-Vis absorber; both of them are well explored and representative as the dye and co-sensitizer. The motivation or inspiration for this theoretical study is the following: the different η is achieved by the step method, namely, the η depends on the sensitizing sequence of IQ21 and S2: (a) for first sensitizing IQ21 and then sensitizing S2, the η approaches 10.4% (denoted as IQ21/S2, Jsc = 19.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 731 mV, FF = 0.72); (b) as for first sensitizing S2 and then sensitizing IQ21, a decreased η of 8.3% is detected (denoted as S2/IQ21, Jsc = 16.0 mA cm−2, Voc = 733 mV, FF = 0.71).40 The interesting aspect behind this phenomenon is that the sensitizing sequence can lead to different adsorption coverage between the dye and co-sensitizer, and subsequently, vary the interfacial electronic structures.

Models and computational details
Models
The co-sensitizing models were constructed by simulating the two aforementioned stepwise sensitizing sequences. Before constructing the models, the binding mode of each dye on the TiO2 surface should be determined because different modes can affect the binding energy,41 electronic coupling,31 and the tilt angle42 between the axes of the dipole moment and the surface normal of the TiO2 film. It has been observed that bidentate bridging (B) and monodentate/hydrogen-bonding (M) binding modes exist in parallel (Fig. 1(c)), and the former type is dominant.43 Meanwhile, in our previous study, mode B is more stable than mode M from the point of adsorption energy.43 Thus, we only consider mode B unless otherwise specified. Moreover, it is assumed that both IQ21 in situation (a) and S2 in situation (b) are saturated because the sensitizing time is long enough (12 hours). The details of the co-sensitizing models are as follows: for situation (a), it first accommodates the maximum quantity of IQ21 on the (TiO2)124 surface (total three molecules), and then introduces S2 on the remaining binding sites. Accordingly, the IQ21/S2-3/1 (simplified as Model 1) is constructed. Notably, there are multiple arrangements between IQ21 and S2 on the surface (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†), and we only consider the closest interacting one which reflects the strongest intermolecular interaction (Fig. 2(a)). As for situation (b), the S2/IQ21-3/1 (simplified as Model 2, Fig. 2(b)) has been constructed following the same method as for in Model 1.

Computational details
For calculations of heterogeneous dye + co-sensitizer@TiO2 interfaces, a (TiO2)124 cluster was obtained by appropriately “cutting” an anatase slab, with the majority (101) surface exposed (Fig. 1(d)). The geometry optimization and first-principle molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out by the DFTB+ program package44,45 with the parameter sets mio-1-146/tiorg-0-147 for C, H, O, N, and S/Ti atoms, and the Lennard-Jones dispersion correction was taken into account for van der Waals interactions.48 For MD simulations, the 5.5 ps NVE trajectory was performed after initial 5 ps NVT equilibrium at the temperature of 298 K. For excited state calculations, the functionals CAM-B3LYP,49 MPW1K,50 and B3LYP51 as implemented in the Gaussian 09 package52 were tested with the aim of checking the effect of the chosen functional on the vertical excitation energies. In conjunction with a conductor-like polarizable continuum model C-PCM53 dichloromethane (CH2Cl2 solvent), it was found that the MPW1K/6-31+G(d) level can reproduce the experimental spectra best. Therefore, the excited states of all structures were calculated at the MPW1K/6-31+G(d) level for 100 lowest singlet–singlet excitations. For a molecule before adsorption on the TiO2 slab, the calculation was performed in the implicit dichloromethane solvent, and for a molecule after adsorption, it was performed in vacuum on the optimized structure of the adsorbed dye + co-sensitizer obtained by removing the (TiO2)124 cluster.54 To analyze the FRET process from the energy-donor to energy-acceptor, the emission spectra were calculated by assuming that the emission follows the Kasha rule.55,56 The electronic coupling between dye/co-sensitizer and (TiO2)124 substrate was analyzed by the Newns–Anderson model27,57 using the B3LYP functional combined with 6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ basis sets for C, H, O, N, and S/Ti atoms (details can be seen in the theoretical background in the ESI†).
Results and discussion
Adsorption density and binding energy
In the co-sensitizing system, different coverages for every kind of light-absorber can lead to a distinct short-circuit current density (Jsc) because the coverage quantity determines the absorption intensity and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE).58 Therefore, the adsorption density (ρ) for IQ21 and S2 in Models 1 and 2 is estimated according to the expression:59 ρ (mol m−2) = M (mol)/A (m2)(1)where M is the number of moles of the adsorbate and A is the area of the upmost surface. The calculated ρ(IQ21) and ρ(S2) are shown in Table 1.

The ρ(IQ21) and ρ(S2) in Model 1 are 9.12 × 10−7 and 3.04 × 10−7 mol m−2, respectively, which are smaller than the reported value of 1.7 × 10−6 mol m−2 (∼ one molecule per nm2) in a previous report for a small dye.59 For Model 2, the ρ(IQ21) and ρ(S2) are 3.04 × 10−7 and 9.12 × 10−7 mol m−2, respectively, which result in a similar small coverage compared to that of Model 1. This small coverage is ascribed to the branched alkyl chains and oxyalkyl chains attached on IQ21 and S2, producing a significant steric hindrance. To detect the effect of adsorption density on the stability of the two models, the binding energy (Eads) of IQ21 and S2 is further calculated:60 Eads = EAdsorber@TiO2 − ETiO2 − EAdsorber(2)where the first term denotes the total energy of adsorber@TiO2, the second is the energy of the TiO2 slab, and the third term stands for the energy of the adsorbent in the adsorber@TiO2 structure, respectively. Notably, in this multiple adsorbents@TiO2 system, the TiO2 slab is combined with the adsorbents, except for the molecule, which to calculate its adsorption energy is treated as an entity in considering the influence of other adsorbents on the molecule. A negative value of Eads indicates that the adsorption is energetically favored. All values are collected in Table 1.
In Model 1, the Eads(IQ21) of the three IQ21 molecules are −4.67, −5.22, and −5.18 eV, and the Eads(S2) is −4.44 eV, showing that all of them are stably attached. In the counterpart, the Eads(IQ21) manifests a decreased adsorption energy with respect to that of Model 1 obviously (−0.53 eV), and all of the S2 molecules display a pronounced tendency to detach, which is evidenced by the positive Eads(S2) of 0.37, 1.11, and 0.53 eV, respectively. These imply that the saturation of IQ21 stabilizes the adsorption of both IQ21 and S2, while the saturation of S2 is detrimental to the stable attachment for all adsorbers, which indirectly shows the role of the sensitizing sequence in the stabilization of all molecules. For Model 1, which entails sensitizing IQ21 prior to S2, the bulkier size of IQ21 over S2 leads to a larger separation between the IQ21 molecules, consequently allowing S2 to more easily cross the IQ21 monolayer and attach onto TiO2. In contrast, for Model 2, which mimics sensitizing S2 prior to IQ21, the smaller S2 forms a more compact monolayer compared to IQ21, thus creating a greater barrier to IQ21 across this dense monolayer.
Surface potential
After the adsorption of an absorber on TiO2, it would form an interfacial dipole,61,62 which can shift the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 positively or negatively, subsequently changing the potential at the interface and further disturbing the magnitude of the open-circuit voltage (Voc, limited mainly by the energy difference in the energy between the conduction band of TiO2 and the oxidation potential of the electrolyte).63 Therefore, the variation in Voc can be explained qualitatively by a dipole-related shift of the CB of TiO2 with respect to the oxidation potential of the electrolyte. More quantitatively, we can calculate the electrostatic potential variation (ΔV) across the co-sensitizing monolayer to detect the influence on Voc:64,65 (3)where Ns is the number of adsorbed molecules per surface area, μ is the molecular dipole moment, θ is the tilt angle between the axes of the dipole moment and the surface normal of the TiO2 film (Fig. S3, ESI†), and εr and ε0 are the dielectric constant for monolayer and vacuum, respectively. To estimate θ, we use the average value that is abstracted from the 5.5 ps MD simulations due to the dependence of the conformation on thermal fluctuations.
Based on the estimated adsorption density, the Ns(IQ21) and Ns(S2) can be deduced. In Model 1, the Ns(IQ21) and Ns(S2) are 0.6 × 1018 and 0.2 × 1018 m−2, respectively. While in Model 2, the Ns(IQ21) and Ns(S2) are 0.2 × 1018 and 0.6 × 1018 m−2, respectively. These quantities are smaller by one order of magnitude than that of benzoic acids adsorbed on a TiO2 surface,65 which arises from their bulky size. Combined with εr = 5.365 and the calculated μ(IQ21) = 8.48 D and μ(S2) = 10.60 D, the ΔV of IQ21 and S2 in Models 1 and 2 is evaluated. In Model 1, the ΔV(IQ21) and ΔV(S2) is 0.36 and 0.12 eV, respectively, and it is 0.17 and 0.34 eV In Model 2. Obviously, it implies that the interfacial dipole is less sensitive to the variation of the co-sensitizing ratio, and it is consistent with the observation from experiment that reversing the sensitizing sequence produces a subtle difference in Voc (731 mV for IQ21/S2, and 733 mV for S2/IQ21) (Table 2).

Absorption and light-harvesting efficiency
It has been observed that different co-sensitizing sequences yield a pronounced difference in Jsc (19.8 mA cm−2 for IQ21/S2 and 16.0 mA cm−2 for S2/IQ21). The Jsc is determined by the light-harvesting efficiency, electron injection efficiency, and electron collection efficiency. The former two items are closely associated with the properties of the absorber, whereas the latter is mainly connected with the properties of the photoanode (it is regarded as a constant in the same operation environment).
For isolated IQ21 and S2 in solution (Fig. 3(a)), the simulated maximum absorption peak λabs is around 553 and 522 nm, respectively. Clearly, the λabs(IQ21) not only red-shifts by 30 nm relative to λabs(S2), but also exhibits 1.2-times higher absorption strength, which is in line with the changed tendency in experiment (557 and 478 nm for IQ21 and S2, respectively).
 Fig. 3  The simulated absorption spectra for (a) isolated IQ21 and S2 in CH2Cl2 solution before adsorption on the slab, (b) Model 1 after adsorption on the TiO2 substrate, and (c) Model 2 after adsorption on the TiO2 substrate, respectively (the solid black and red lines in (b) and (c) represent the absorption spectra of isolated IQ21 and S2 in solution, the dashed black and red lines stand for the absorption spectra of isolated IQ21 and S2 adsorbed on the slab, and the dashed dotted lines are the spectra of the whole dye + co-sensitizer system, respectively). 
As for the situation of IQ21 and S2 co-sensitized on a substrate, significant differences in the absorption band and intensity are observed. For Model 1 (Fig. 3(b)), the λabs of the adsorbed IQ21 and S2 shows an obvious red-shift by 37 and 30 nm compared to that of the isolated IQ21 and S2 in CH2Cl2 solvent, respectively. Also, the λabs of the whole dye + co-sensitizer red-shifts by 37 and 68 nm compared to that of isolated IQ21 and S2 combined with an improvement in intensity by 1.6 and 2-times, respectively. As for Model 2 (Fig. 3(c)), it is identified that the λabs of the adsorbed IQ21 and S2 is similar to that in Model 1, and the λabs of the full adsorbents apparently blue-shifts to 530 nm combined with a 2-times enhancement in the absorption strength compared to that of Model 1. Based on the expression of light-harvesting efficiency LHE = 1–10−f (f is the oscillator strength at a given wavelength), the LHE of λabs for isolated IQ21 (f = 1.78) and S2 (f = 1.54) is 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. When IQ21 and S2 are co-adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, the f all display a larger value with respect to that of the isolated component, thus, the light harvesting of Model 1 and 2 at λabs is complete. It implies that variation of the sensitizing ratio between different absorbers can manipulate the light-harvesting in the absorption region and intensity, influencing Jsc distinctly, and this phenomenon is also observed in another squaraine and fluorine co-sensitizing systems.66
Electron injection efficiency
In principle, the electron injection efficiency (ηinj) of a single absorber material is mainly determined by the electron injection rate (kinj), electron–hole recombination rate (krec), and radiative decay rate (krad) of the excited state, and it can be evaluated by:67 (4)The kinj represents the electron injection from dye to TiO2, and the krec is the electron–hole recombination from the injected electron in TiO2 to the oxidized dye or species in the electrolyte. As for the radiative decay, it is a slow process (around the nanosecond scale), thus, it can be ignored to estimate ηinj qualitatively.68
For the kinj, it can be evaluated by the Fermi golden rule:69 (5)where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, Vdye–TiO2 is the electronic coupling between donor (dye) and acceptor states (TiO2), and ρ(εdye) is the density of states of the TiO2 substrate estimated at the donor energy.
As for the krec, we only consider the recombination from the injected electron in TiO2 to the oxidized dye, and it can be derived from the Marcus theory from the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of TiO2 to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the absorber qualitatively:70 (6)where χ is the reorganization energy (the details associated to the description of χ can be seen in the ESI†), kB is the Boltzmann constant, ΔGrec is the energy difference approximately between the LUMO of TiO2 and the HOMO of the dye, and VTiO2–dye is the electronic coupling between the LUMO of TiO2 and the HOMO of the dye, and EL–EF is the difference (1.6 eV) between the LUMO of TiO2 and the Fermi level for TiO2, respectively.
Furthermore, based on the calculated unoccupied molecular orbitals (L ∼ L + 3, see Fig. S4 in the ESI†), it can be found that the intermolecular electronic coupling71,72 is subtle because each of these orbitals is concentrated on one molecule, indicating that the lateral charge transfer in a monolayer can be ignored, therefore, eqn (4) can be generalized as:31 (7)where kinj′, krec′, and ηinj′ represent the total electron injection rate constant, total electron–hole recombination rate constant, and the total electron injection efficiency, respectively.
The calculated kinj and krec for isolated IQ21 and S2, as well as kinj′, krec′, and ηinj′ in Model 1 and 2, are summarized in Table 3. For Model 1, the kinj′ and krec′ are 86.2 × 1015 and 5.2 × 1015 s−1, respectively, yielding a ηinj′ around 0.94. As for Model 2, although the kinj′ is 1.1-times larger than that in Model 1, the magnitude of krec′ (63.4 × 1015 s−1) is 12-times larger than that of 1, therefore weakening the efficient electron injection and leading to a ηinj′ of only 0.60. This apparent difference in ηinj′ stems from the fact that the krec(S2) in Model 1 is 0.4 × 1015 s−1, while in Model 2, the magnitude of krec(S2) is obviously larger for the three adsorbed S2 molecules (39-, 43-, and 75-times larger) compared to the quantity in Model 1. Contrarily, the krec(IQ21) of 1 and 2 both present a smaller deviation. So, the larger ratio of IQ21 in 1 achieves more efficient electron injection. However, the larger ratio of S2 in 2 exacerbates the electron loss, suppressing efficient electron injection. Combining the varied absorption bands and intensity as well as the ηinj′, the results imply that the reason of significant difference in Jsc of IQ21/S2 (19.8 mA cm−1) and S2/IQ21 (16.0 mA cm−1) is closely dependent on the sensitizing ratio of IQ21 and S2 (reflecting the sensitizing sequence), and the large ratio of IQ21 favors the red-shifted absorption band and efficient electron injection.

FRET
Commonly, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is viewed as a critical factor in a co-sensitizing system, because it can enhance73,74 or impede17 the electron injection. Briefly, FRET is a nonradiative energy transfer occurring from the energy donor (D, UV-Vis absorber) to the energy acceptor (A, NIR absorber) because of an energy cascade effect.75–77 It is mediated by the D–A dipole–dipole interaction, where the energy transfer efficiency is mainly determined by the distance (rDA) and geometrical orientation (κ, details in the ESI†) between D and A.22,78 Therefore, FRET rate (kF) can be estimated according to the following equations:77 (8) (9)where τ0 is the lifetime of the excited state of D, R0 is the Förster radius when the FRET has 50% probability, QD is the luminescence efficiency of D, NA is Avogadro's constant, n is the refractive index of the medium, FD is the emission spectrum of D, and εA is the absorption spectrum of A, respectively. Clearly, large spectral overlap, small rDA (commonly 1–10 nm), and large κ2 (κ2 is 0, 1, 4, and 2/3 upon the transition dipole moment between D and A with vertical, parallel, end to end, and random orientation, respectively) favor efficient FRET.
Generally, the quantities of τ0, QD, and the spectral overlap are assumed to be less sensitive to the dynamical structural changes. Based on the calculated excited energy and emission energy during the time span (Fig. S5 in ESI†), it confirms again the insensitivity of the spectral overlap to the dynamical structural changes. Thus, the kF can be simplified in the scaled form kF′ proposed by De Angelis et al:33 kF = Cκ2rDA−6 = CkF′(10) kF′ = κ2rDA−6(11)where the scaled FRET rate kF′ has the unit of Å−6. Hence, unless otherwise specified, we will use eqn (11) to investigate FRET rate. The associated parameters are summarized in Table 4, and the MD simulated kF′ as the function of time span is plotted in Fig. 4, respectively.

 Fig. 4  The scaled FRET rate kF′ of varied D–A couples (a) for Model 1 and (b) for Model 2 (Cn defines the number of donor–acceptor couple, and the relative alignments between IQ21 and S2 are abstracted from Fig. 2). 
First, the overlap between photoluminescence and absorption spectra are investigated. As discussed above, the calculated vertical excitation energies of IQ21 and S2 are 2.24 and 2.37 eV, respectively, showing that the energy transfer occurs from S2 to IQ21. This can be also verified by the absorption of co-adsorbed IQ21 and S2 (1:1) on the TiO2 substrate (blue line in Fig. 3(a)) where the absorption around 550 nm is enhanced evidently, which benefits from the λems of S2 around this region (green line in Fig. 3(a)).
Then, the MD simulated κ2 and rDA are analyzed to understand the FRET in Model 1 and 2 with different sensitizing ratios. To distinguish the possible energy transfer between multiple D and A, the varied D–A couples are indicated as Cn (Fig. 4). For example in Model 1, every IQ21 molecule could accept the energy from S2 via fluorescence if it meets the FRET condition, thus three D–A couples can be defined (C1, C2, and C3, respectively). An identical quantity of D–A couples is also defined in Model 2. The thermal average values of κ2 and rDA have been collected in Table 4, and more details for these two items have been shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI.† In Model 1, the intermolecular orientation between IQ21 and S2 of C1, C2, and C3 are close to vertical, which is evidenced by the κ2 < 0.5 (0.41, 0.41, and 0.25, respectively). For rDA, it is 5.15, 7.12, and 8.37 Å, respectively.
As for Model 2, the opposite change is detected compared to the situation in Model 1. The intermolecular orientation between IQ21 and S2 tends to be parallel for C1, C2, and C3 (κ2 are 0.74, 0.63, and 0.55, respectively). Meanwhile, the rDA extends distinctly (15.24 and 12.10 Å of C2 and C3) compared to that in 1 except for the slight shortening of C1 (4.92 Å).
Combined with the simulated κ2 and rDA, the kF′ of different D–A couples in 1 and 2 can be obtained, and the results are plotted in Fig. 4. It can clearly be seen that in 1 (Fig. 4(a)), the kF′ of C1 and C2 fluctuates moderately, while remarkable oscillation is observed for C3, although it slows down apparently after the 2.5 ps simulations.
Differently from the situation in Model 1, Model 2 displays a larger FRET tendency. From Fig. 4(b), the kF′ of C1 shows a significant up-and-down, but for C2 and C3, it yields a negligible contribution. Considering the most pronounced contribution of kF′(C3) in 1 and kF′(C1) in 2, the FRET in 1 (the average kF′(C3) is 17.02 × 10−6 Å−6) is smaller than that in 2 (the average kF′(C1) is 58.45 × 10−6 Å−6), showing that the large ratio of IQ21 can suppress FRET apparently, while the large ratio of S2 potentially favors FRET distinctly. The previous observation in ref. 17 has verified that a large FRET suppresses the electron injection from the energy donor to the substrate, and this is mainly due to the parallel orientation between D and A. Although the FRET was unevaluated in experiment, the calculated intermolecular orientations and distances as well as the emission of S2 and absorption of IQ21 indicate that the FRET can occur. Thus, the simulated larger FRET in Model 2 with respect to Model 1 could be another reason for the lower Jsc in S2/IQ21 than that in IQ21/S2.
The possible reduced ratio
In the above sections, we have analyzed the special situation of saturated adsorption for one kind of absorber. To detect if the parameters of Eads, ΔV, ηinj′, and kF′ always depend on the sensitizing ratio, we have additionally constructed another two ratios, Models 3 (reducing one IQ21 molecule) and Model 4 (reducing one S2 molecule), which mimics the reduced ratio of IQ21 and S2 (models can be seen in Fig. S6 in the ESI†). The criterion of the model construction is identical to that of Models 1 and 2. All kinds of parameters have been characterized repeatedly, and more details can be seen in the ESI.† Overall, the Eads (Table S3, ESI†) of all molecules is negative in Model 3 and 4, indicative of a stable adsorption for all molecules. For ΔV (Table S4, ESI†), it is still less sensitive on the sensitizing ratio, which is similar to that in 1 and 2. As for ηinj′ (Table S5, ESI†), the magnitude in 3 (0.65) is smaller than that of 4 (0.83), showing an opposite trend compared to that in 1 and 2 (0.94 vs. 0.60). Moreover, the FRET in 3 tends to be more moderate than that in 4, which is reflected by the slight oscillation of kF′ in 3 compared to that in 4 (Fig. S10, ESI†), displaying a similar change with respect to 1 and 2.
The Models 3 and 4 catch the main change tendency in 1 and 2 except for the ηinj′, and qualitatively, the sensitizing ratio reflecting that the sensitizing sequence of varied absorbers plays a critical role in η. This can be directly reflected from the molecular structure, namely, sensitizing with a larger absorber preferentially to saturate and then sensitizing with a smaller absorber can achieve the ideal occupation for all kinds of absorbers. On the other hand, designing a co-sensitizing system containing a bulky dye with NIR absorption and relatively small co-sensitizer with UV-Vis absorption can potentially improve Jsc and diminish electron–hole recombination significantly. This work provides a comprehensive outlook of the co-sensitizing sequence in yielding varied η in the step method, and we hope this can help to screen out suitable absorber partners in the future.
Conclusions
In summary, the effect of the sensitizing ratio at multiple absorbers@inorganic heterogeneous interfaces on the surface potential, electron injection efficiency, and FRET have been investigated to analyze the dependence of the conversion efficiency on varied sensitizing sequences. For the special Models 1 and 2, the results show that the stable adsorption of both IQ21 and S2 is observed in 1, while the apparent desorption of all absorbers is detected in 2. The electrostatic potential variation ΔV, which is close to the value of Voc, is insensitive both in 1 and 2. However, the two critical items of absorption characterization and electron injection efficiencies ηinj′ associated to the Jsc in 1 and 2 display significant differences. In Model 1, the λabs is red-shifted to 590 nm compared to the isolated IQ21 and S2, while in Model 2, the λabs is blue-shifted pronouncedly to 530 nm, influencing the light-harvesting in the NIR region. As for ηinj′, it is estimated to be 0.94 in Model 1 and 0.60 in Model 2, and this stems from the faster electron–hole recombination of S2 in 2. On the other hand, the MD simulated intermolecular distance rDA and orientation κ imply that the FRET can occur in these systems, and the FRET rate kF′ reflects that the FRET in 2 is faster than that in 1, which is evidenced by the average kF′(C3) in 1 (17.02 × 10−6 Å−6) that is smaller than the kF′(C1) in 2 (58.45 × 10−6 Å−6). The insensitive ΔV explains the subtle difference in Voc from experiment upon changing the sensitizing sequence for IQ21 and S2, and the apparent difference in λabs, ηinj′, and kF′ account for the distinguishable Jsc. Furthermore, the possible reduced ratio of IQ21 in Model 3 and S2 in Model 4 have also been explored. It mirrors the main change tendency in 1 and 2 except for the ηinj′. Overall, the result implies that the sensitizing ratio, which reflects the sensitizing sequence for varied absorbers, plays a critical role in the conversion efficiency, and sensitizing a larger absorber with NIR features preferentially to saturation, and then introducing a smaller absorber with UV-Vis features can potentially improve Jsc and diminish the electron–hole recombination significantly. We hope that our results are helpful for designing cooperative absorbers in future experiments.
