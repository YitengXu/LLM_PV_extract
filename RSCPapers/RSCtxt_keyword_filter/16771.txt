    , Accepted 9th February 2022First published on 9th February 2022AbstractThe search for highly effective and environmentally safe photocatalysts for water splitting and photovoltaic solar cells is essential for renewable solar energy conversion and storage. Based on first-principle calculations, we show that novel 2D β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayer possesses excellent stability and great potential in solar energy conversion applications. Comprehensive studies show that the β-PdS2 monolayer exhibits semiconductor characteristics with an indirect gap, suitable band alignment, efficient carrier separation, and high solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency, supporting its good photoelectronic performance. The surface catalytic and adsorption/intercalation energy calculation reveals that the photogenerated electrons have adequate driving forces to render hydrogen reduction half-reactions to proceed spontaneously and the ability to cover and incorporate water molecules on the β-PdS2 monolayer. Besides, the β-PdTe2 monolayer is a promising donor material for excitonic solar cells with high photovoltaic performance. More importantly, due to suitable donor band gap and small conduction band offset in the proposed type-II heterostructure, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) were calculated up to ∼23% (β-PdTe2/WTe2), ∼21% (β-PdTe2/MoTe2) and ∼18% (β-PdTe2/β-PdS2), making it a promising candidate for solar energy conversion applications.
1. Introduction
Solar energy conversion technologies, such as photocatalytic water splitting and photovoltaic cells are demanding to produce clean energy and to reduce significant environmental and energy concerns. Since the realization of semiconductor photocatalyst TiO2 for solar water splitting,1 researchers have devoted significant efforts to explore effective photocatalysts capable of producing hydrogen energy.2–7 To achieve cost-effective hydrogen production, photocatalysts' solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency should be at least 10% for large-scale production.8 The favorable hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER), efficient separation with fast carrier migration and robust light-harvesting, leads to high STH efficiency. Also, the band gap must be equal or greater to 1.23 eV for a viable photocatalyst, and VBM and CBM appropriately straddling the redox potentials of the water. If these criteria are satisfied, water can be split without the need for any sacrificial agents.9 However, due to low quantum efficiency induced by charge recombination both on the surface and in the bulk of the catalysts, only a few show good photocatalytic activity for water splitting.10
In the last few decades, 2D materials have been suggested as promising solar energy harvesters due to high optical absorption, high carrier mobility and sufficient reactive sites.11–19 Unfortunately, many of them have poor long-term endurance and are effectively inactive for photocatalysis water splitting.9,20 Also, the significant energy loss produced by the high overpotential in HER and OER needs to be reduced. Therefore, novel 2D photocatalysts, particularly those with low overpotential, are of great interest for realizing the water-splitting reaction without the use of sacrificial reagents or co-catalysts.
Among 2D materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) research has sparked a lot of interest in the creation of few-layer or monolayer nanosheets.21,22 These advancements bring new life to photocatalytic water splitting due to the fact that TMDs possess a high optical absorption efficiency, high carrier mobility, high charge transfer ability and a large number of catalytic sites.23–25 Despite the potential advantages of 2D chalcogenides for photocatalysis, the hydrogen yield from water splitting remains low due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons.26 TMDs with abundant active sites can enhance the efficiency to trigger the overall water splitting reactions.
Besides photocatalyst, the solar cell is also an essential renewable energy conversion technology that converts solar radiation directly into electricity. Solar cell materials with enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) have been investigated continually since the invention of the first operational solar cell in 1954.27 For van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure solar cells with a high PCE should meet two main criteria.28 First, acceptor and donor materials should have type II band alignments in the heterostructure. Second, the donor material's band gap should be between 0.90–1.70 eV to ensure effective light-harvesting performance. The light-harvesting performance, the carrier mobility and the separation efficiency of excitons also play essential roles in determining the PCE.29
Thus, 2D materials also have been regarded as promising candidates for excitonic solar cells (XSCs) due to their adjustable bandgap and good light-harvesting performance with high carrier mobility.30–32 The electronic characteristics of individual monolayers can be tuned by linking their band edges using a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure generated by stacking distinct monolayer materials.33,34 Therefore, the fabrication of efficient type-II vdW heterostructures is considered promising for next-generation solar cell applications.
In this work, density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed to describe the photocatalytic water splitting and photovoltaic activity of β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers, respectively. We performed molecular dynamics calculations to investigate these monolayers' thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities. Remarkably, the β-PdS2 monolayer has an indirect band gap (2.10 eV) with suitable band edge positions, and the potential to meet the requirement for redox potentials of photocatalysis. The adsorption/intercalation energies are obtained to check whether the coverage and incorporation of water molecules are energetically feasible or not. Furthermore, the β-PdTe2 monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap of ∼1.29 eV with suitable type-II vdW heterostructure alignments, suggesting that it could serve as suitable donor material for constructing 2D heterostructure as an excitonic solar cell. Significantly, the estimated PCE of β-PdTe2/β-PdS2, β-PdTe2/MoTe2 and β-PdTe2/WTe2 heterojunctions, can be as high as 17.79%, 20.59% and 23.14%, respectively.
2. Computational method
The calculated results were obtained by employing density functional theory (DFT) as the Quantum-ESPRESSO package.35,36 We employed the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation of the exchange–correlation (XC) functional. The convergence criterion for the forces was set to 0.01 eV Å−1 and a norm-conserving pseudopotential with a 90 Ry energy cutoff. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) integration was performed with 24 × 24 × 1 k-point grid for Monkhorst–Pack mesh. To break unphysical interactions between periodic system images, we inserted a large vacuum of 20 Å perpendicular to the 2D structure. Moreover, the sophisticated HSE06 hybrid functional was also used for calculating the electronic structures.37,38 To include van der Waals interactions, we used Grimme's DFT-D2 approach for all heterostructure calculations.39 The AIMD simulations were performed using Nosé thermostat algorithm at different temperatures of 300 K, 500 K and 1000 K for a total of 5 ps with a time step of 3 fs using the SIESTA package.40
We used the G0W0 + BSE method as incorporated in the YAMBO code41 coupled with the Quantum-ESPRESSO package for optical absorbance. To achieve convergence, 200 bands were undertaken in the sum over the state for the correlation part of self-energy. To ensure the absorption spectrum converges, three valence and two conduction bands are used to solve the Bethe–Salpeter equation and dielectric function. Moreover, to account for solvent effects in simulations, we used the implicit solvent model within the Environ code42 of Quantum ESPRESSO using the 78.3 dielectric constants for liquid water. The details of free energy and thermodynamic oxidation and reduction potential calculations are summarized in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structure and stability
The bulk β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) exhibits trigonal symmetry with P3121 space group.43 As shown in Fig. 1(a), the layers of β-PdX2 are stacked together along the z-axis through interlayer vdW bonding. The atoms of each layer of bulk β-PdX2 are located in four, and six-membered ring structures parallel to the x-axis as a helical chain, where each Pd atom is covalently bound to the four neighboring X (X = S, Te) atoms within the chain, and the chains pile up in the y-direction.

(c) Cleavage energy as a function of the separation distance for β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayer and five-layer slab (inset). Black: Pd atom. Yellow: Se atom. 
Moreover, isolating an individual layer from the β-PdX2 bulk yields the structure of the β-PdX2 monolayer, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The optimized lattice parameters for both β-PdS2, β-PdTe2 monolayer are slightly smaller than the bulk phase. Detailed optimized geometric properties for β-PdX2 bulk and monolayer are summarized in Table S1.†
Experiments have shown that mechanical exfoliation can yield various 2D materials with weak interlayer interactions from their bulk counterparts.44,45 Here, to explore the possibility of fabricating the energetically favorable β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) from the surface of its layered bulk crystal, we compute their cleavage energy (Ecl) from a 5-layer slab model with the function of separation distance. Note that this method is highly accurate to calculate cleavage energy comparable to experiments. For example, calculated cleavage energy of graphene (0.33 J m−2)46 is in excellent agreement with the measured value of cleavage energy (0.32 ± 0.03 J m−2).47 Remarkably, the theoretical demonstration of the possibility of mechanical exfoliation of Ca2N monolayer with cleavage energy 1.09 J m−248 was recently confirmed in experiments with cleavage energy 1.11 J m−2.49 Recently, many 2D monolayers such as PdSeO3,12 BiFeO3,50 SnP3,51 and GeTe52 have been theoretically demonstrated to be potential candidates for experimental fabrications and have also been experimentally synthesized.53–56
As depicted in Fig. 1(c), the Ecl are 0.47 and 0.88 J m−2 for β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers, respectively. Remarkably, the calculated Ecl of β-PdS2 is quite comparable with 2D MoS2 (0.42 J m−2),57 PdSeO3 (0.42 J m−2)12 crystal that has been realized experimentally via exfoliation techniques. Also, the Ecl of β-PdTe2, is lower than that of α-BS (0.96 J m−2),58 Ca2N (1.08 J m−2),48 GeP3 (1.14 J m−2)59 and InP3 (1.32 J m−2).60 The cleavage energy calculations suggest the feasibility of the experimental fabrication of these monolayers.
Furthermore, to examine the energetic stability of the β-PdX2 monolayer, we calculated the cohesive energy (ECoh), which is defined as ECoh = (EPd + EX − EPdX2)/3, where EPd, EX and EPdX2 are the total energy of a single Pd, X (X = S, Te) atom and total energy of PdX2 unit cell, respectively. The obtained cohesive energy of 4.0 eV per atom for β-PdS2 is higher than that of other 2D materials, such as silicene (3.98 eV per atom), whereas the calculated ECoh of β-PdTe2 (3.3 eV per atom) is comparable to that of black phosphorene (BP) (3.4 eV per atom).61 Our investigation demonstrates the high feasibility of exfoliating β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayers from their bulk counterpart as free-standing monolayers.
Next, the dynamic stability of β-PdX2 monolayers was assessed by examining the phonon spectra along with the high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, as shown in Fig. S1(a) and S2(b) ESI.† No significant imaginary phonon modes are found in the spectrum, revealing the kinetic stability for both β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers. Moreover, the thermal stability of the β-PdX2 monolayer was also examined by performing AIMD simulations with a relatively larger 4 × 4 supercell at 300 K with a time step of 3 fs. The small total energy fluctuations with time suggest that both β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers are thermally stable up to 5000 fs in simulation (Fig. S1(b) and S2(b) ESI†). The AIMD simulations were also performed at higher temperatures of 500 and 1000 K (Fig. S1(c, d) and S2(c, d) ESI†), which revealed good thermodynamical stability of β-PdX2 monolayers, thereby, showing promises for the future synthesis of these monolayers.62
3.2. Optoelectronic properties
After investigating the intrinsic stability and the experimental feasibility, we then computed the optoelectronic properties for the β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayer. As depicted in Fig. 2(a and b), β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers are indirect band gap semiconductors of 2.10 eV (1.14 eV) and 1.29 eV (0.65 eV) at the HSE06 (GGA-PBE) level of theories. The VBM is located at near Y (0, 0.5, 0) point for both β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers, whereas the CBM lies between M and Y and Γ to X point in the Brillouin zone for β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers, respectively. The density of states (DOS) analysis reveals that the states near the Fermi levels are contributed by the mixture of p-orbitals of S/Te and d-orbitals of Pd (Fig. 2(a and b)). The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect on the electronic band structure was examined at the PBE + SOC level of theory. Our results reveal that the effect of SOC on β-PdS2 (Fig. S3 ESI†) is negligible, whereas a slight band gap reduction (ΔEg = 0.25 eV) was obtained for β-PdTe2 (Fig. S4 ESI†).

3.2.1. Carrier mobilities. 
In order to explore the separation and migration ability of the photoexcited carriers, we calculated the carrier mobilities for β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 using deformation potential (DP) theory according to the phonon-limited scattering model63 (see ESI†). According to our calculated results, the β-PdS2 monolayer has isotropic carrier mobility for electrons (1.04 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.06 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole (2.5 × 101 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.7 × 101 cm2 V−1 s−1) along x- and y-direction (Table S2†), while the β-PdTe2 monolayer has anisotropic values for electrons (1.25 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.6 × 101 cm2 V−1 s−1) and holes (1.0 × 101 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.4 × 101 cm2 V−1 s−1) along x and y-directions (Table S2†). This difference in the nature of carrier mobility of two monolayers can be quantified in terms of the difference in electronegative and orbital radii between S and Te atoms that results in different dispersion of valence and conduction bands near the Fermi level for these monolayers. Different dispersion of bands further leads to a change in effective masses and deformation potential along x- and y-direction. For example, effective mass (0.27 and 1.56) and deformation potential (Ei = 2.0 eV and 3.38 eV) of the electron along x- and y-direction leads to a highly anisotropic value of electron mobility in the β-PdTe2 monolayer. The electron mobility (μe) of β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayers are moderately large and much higher than that of MoS2 (72.16 cm2 V−1 S−1)64 and WS2 (130 cm2 V−1 S−1),65 demonstrating their fast carrier migration ability.


3.2.2. Optical absorption spectra. 
To investigate the light-harvesting ability of β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayer, we calculated the optical absorption spectra along the in-plane (XY) direction using the state-of-the-art GW + BSE method,66 which includes the exciton effects. β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayer structures exhibit strong optical absorption ability, as shown in Fig. 3. Note that the optical absorbance (α(ω)) is plotted from the imaginary part of the dielectric function ε2(ω) on the basis of the following equation:67,68 (1)where, Lz represents the length of the supercell along the z-direction. The β-PdTe2 monolayer exhibits relatively significant light absorption with prominent peaks in the visible region compared to β-PdS2, as seen in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  The absorbance of the β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayers computed using the GW + BSE method for the light incident in-plane (XY) direction. 
Also, the calculated excitons binding energies for β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers are 0.84 eV and 0.75 eV, respectively, which is comparable to that of monolayer Cu2ZnSnS4 (0.84 eV),69 Janus WSSe (0.83 eV)70 and smaller than BeN2 monolayer (1.07 eV).71 Hence, the β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayer has enough carriers to involve in the reaction with effectively separated electron–hole pairs.

3.3. Photocatalytic properties
To assess whether the potential of utilizing the β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayer for photocatalytic water splitting, we further aligned the band edge positions with respect to vacuum level relative to that redox potential for hydrogen reduction (EH+/H2) and water oxidation (EO2/H2O) at pH = 0. The potential of the CBM (VBM) should be higher (lower) than the reduction level of hydrogen (oxidation level of water) for an overall water splitting photocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the VBM and CBM of β-PdS2 monolayer surpass the standard oxidation (O2/H2O) and reduction (H+/H2) potential level, indicating sufficient activity of the β-PdS2 monolayer in both OER and HER processes. On the other hand, VBM of the β-PdTe2 monolayer is larger than the oxidation level of oxygen (−5.67 at pH = 0) (Fig. 4(b)), indicating that oxidation half-reaction is not possible in the β-PdTe2 monolayer.
 Fig. 4  Band edge positions with water redox potential for water splitting at pH = 0 for (a) β-PdS2 and (b) β-PdTe2 monolayers along the z-direction based on the HSE06 level of theory. 
The external potentials produced by photogenerated carriers directly impact photocatalytic water splitting.12,72 The calculated potential of the photogenerated electrons for hydrogen reduction (Ue = energy difference between reduction potential of H+/H2 and the CBM) is 0.46 V at pH = 0 (Ue = 0.46 + 0.059 × pH) for β-PdS2 monolayer. Whereas the potential of photogenerated holes of water oxidation (Uh = energy difference between reduction potential of H+/H2 and the VBM) was calculated to be 1.65 V at pH = 0 (Uh = 1.65–0.059 × pH). Therefore, at a neutral environment (pH = 7), Ue and Uh for the β-PdS2 monolayer are 0.87 and 1.23 V, respectively, which indicates the potential to have photocatalytic activity water splitting in the neutral environment.
To further assess the practical applications, the stability of photocatalysts in aqueous solution with illumination was also checked. Following Chen and Wang's method,73 we evaluated the thermodynamic oxidation (ϕox) (red line) and reduction potentials (ϕre) (blue line) for β-PdS2 monolayer (see the ESI†). As displayed in Fig. 4a, the ϕox are lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O; meanwhile, the ϕre are higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2, which reveals that water molecules will be reduced and oxidized by photogenerated carriers instead of photocatalysts itself.73 Hence, the β-PdS2 monolayer has good resistance to photoinduced corrosion.
3.4. β-PdS2 as photocatalyst for water splitting
The presence of a suitable bandgap, band edge position and optical absorbance are not sufficient to imply that the β-PdS2 monolayer will act as a promising photocatalyst for overall water splitting. Therefore, to investigate further the water splitting activity, we examined the feasibility of adsorption and intercalation of water molecules on the surface of the β-PdS2 monolayer, mechanisms and processes (Gibbs free energy) for both HER and OER and the solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency for judging a material's ability to split water by photocatalysis.

3.4.1. Surface and adsorption/intercalation energies. 
The adsorption and intercalation energies for the water molecules are calculated as Eads/int = E(*H2O) − E(*) − E(H2O), where E(*H2O) represents the energy of (001) β-PdS2 with adsorbed/intercalated H2O molecules, and E(*) is the energy of the pristine (001) β-PdS2. Before estimating the adsorption/intercalation energy, we first checked the stability of the (001) surface of β-PdS2 by calculating the surface energy in the solvent. The computed surface energy (−0.13 eV) revealed that the (001) surface of β-PdS2 is stable no matter in a vacuum or solution. The adsorbed/intercalated model was designed using a three-layer of β-PdS2 (001) surface with an area of 60.2 Å2 and adsorbed (Fig. 5(a)) or intercalated (Fig. 5(b)) with 1, 2, 3, 4 H2O molecules. The adsorption and intercalation energy were calculated to be nearly the same (−0.65 eV per molecule and −0.66 eV per molecule) for various H2O coverage's (Table S4†) reveal that β-PdS2 (001) surface can equally adsorb or intercalate H2O molecules. We also estimated the energy for adsorption (4H2O) with intercalation (4H2O) model, as shown in Fig. 5(c), which result in lower energy (−0.35 eV per H2O molecules) than pure adsorption and intercalation energy. These results reveal that the coverage and incorporation of water molecules are energetically feasible, and water molecules can enter spontaneously to the β-PdS2 layer.

3.4.2. Gibbs free energy profiles. 
Next, we consider the photocatalytic mechanism and Gibbs's free energy profile of the β-PdS2 monolayer for HER and OER processes. The details of computations can be found in ESI.† Note that we also include the solvation effect to describe the thermodynamics of chemical reactions at the solid/liquid interfaces. As displayed in Fig. 6(a), the hydrogen reduction only contains two steps.
 Fig. 6  (a) Proposed photocatalytic pathways along with the atomic configuration of hydrogen reduction. The white ball represents H atoms. The free-energy changes for HER at potential U = 0 and U = 1.23 V at (b) pH = 0, (c) pH = 3, and (d) pH = 7. 
First, the β-PdS2 monolayer combines with a proton and an electron to form an H* species with an unfavorable ΔG of 0.95 eV (HER barrier) at U = 0. Next, the H2 molecule is released after the H* bonds with a proton and an electron, which is exothermic by nature. However, when equilibrium potential of 1.23 V is considered at pH = 0–4, both the steps become downhill (Fig. 6 and S5 ESI†), which indicates that the HER could happen spontaneously on the surface of the β-PdS2 monolayer in an acid medium under illumination. At pH = 7, an additional external potential of 0.13 V is needed to be employed to drive the HER to occur spontaneously (Fig. 6(d)), which is similar to β-GeSe (0.13 V)74 and much lower than β-AuS (0.16 V),75 β-SnSe (0.16 V),74 RhTeCl (0.30 V),76 β-PdSe2 (0.31 V),77 C3S (0.33 V),78 SiP2 (0.83 V), PE-AgBiP2Se6 (1.06 V)72 and FE-AgBiP2Se6 (1.62 V).72
As illustrated in Fig. 7(a), the mechanism of water oxidation half-reaction following a four-electron reaction pathway accompanied by intermediate products. We compute the Gibbs free energy of intermediates (OH*, O*, OOH*) and ΔG of elementary steps to directly characterize the performance of the β-PdS2 monolayer (Table S5†). Initially, the adsorbed water molecule is oxidized into *OH species; second, the OH* species continues to be oxidized into O* intermediate after releasing another electron and a proton; third, combining with another water molecule, the *O species turns into an OOH* species; finally, the OOH* species is oxidized into free O2 molecule by releasing one electron–proton pair. The third reaction step, OOH* formation, is the highest free energy change (OER barrier) with a limiting potential of 3.62 V (Fig. 7(b)) in the water oxidation half-reaction. In the absence of any light irradiation (U = 0) at pH = 0–7 (brown line), the free energy change for step 3 (ΔGOOH*) is always uphill (endothermic), which means that the water oxidation half-reaction cannot proceed spontaneously (Fig. 7 and S6, ESI†). Whereas, at the equilibrium potential of U = 1.23 V (blue line), two reaction steps (first and third) were still endergonic at pH = 0–7.
 Fig. 7  (a) Proposed photocatalytic pathways and the atomic configuration of absorbed intermediate species (OH*, O*, and OOH*) for water oxidation. The free-energy changes of oxygen evolution at potential U = 0 and U = 1.23 V at (b) pH = 0, (c) pH = 3, and (d) pH = 7. Note: the white and red balls represent H and O atoms, respectively. 
At U = 3.63 V (green line), the free energy profile revealed that all reaction steps were downhill. Thus, the computed OER overpotential (ηOER) became 2.39 V (2.21 V) for the β-PdS2 monolayer at pH = 0 (pH = 3), as shown in Fig. 7(b and c). Remarkably, the value of overpotential (ηOER) is reduced to 1.97 V (pH = 7) from 2.39 V (pH = 0), as shown in Fig. 7(d). Consequently, applying an external potential of 1.97 V can trigger the OER in a neutral medium.


3.4.3. Solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. 
The ultimate goal in the research of solar energy utilization for photocatalytic water splitting is to enhance the energy conversion efficiency, which the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency could assess. Based on the band alignments, the energy conversion efficiencies of the β-PdS2 monolayer are estimated with 100% efficiency of the catalytic reaction.14 The calculated light absorption (ηabs), carrier utilization (ηcu), and STH (ηSTH) efficiencies are listed in Table S6.† The STH efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting for 2D material could be calculated as: ηSTH = ηabs × ηcu(2) (3)where P(ℏω) and E represents the AM1.5G solar energy flux at the photon energy ℏω and energy of photons, respectively. (See ESI†).
Here, the band gaps (Eg) and overpotentials of the hydrogen (χ(H2)), and oxygen (χ(O2)) are calculated using HSE06 hybrid functional (Table S6†) to estimate these efficiencies. The light absorption efficiency (ηabs) of the β-PdS2 monolayer is 32.35%, and it is highly dependent on the band gap value. Moreover, the energy conversion efficiencies of carrier utilization (ηcu) are higher than 35% due to appropriate levels of χ(H2) and χ(O2) for a broad range of pH (0–7). The high efficiencies of both ηabs and ηcu lead to high STH efficiency. According to the definition of STH, ηSTH of the β-PdS2 monolayer are larger than 10% for all pH from 0 to 7 with 15.39% highest for pH 3 and 4 (Fig. 8), which are much higher than those of pentagonal PdSe2 (12.59%),79 Ga2S3 (6.4%),14 Ga2SSe bilayer (7.42%)80 and Al2Se3 (8%). Therefore, we believe that the β-PdS2 monolayer meets the critical value for the economic production of hydrogen from photocatalysis (above 10%).8

3.5. β-PdTe2 as excitonic solar cell
The suitable band gap, high carrier mobility and good solar light-harvesting capability of β-PdTe2 monolayer may be utilized to construct next-generation heterojunction solar cells. We considered eight appropriate and lattice-matching 2D materials (MoTe2, WTe2, Ga2STe, InSe, InTe, RhTeCl, T–Te and β-PdS2 monolayers) to build heterostructures with the β-PdTe2 monolayer (Fig. S7 ESI†). The electronic band structure of individual monolayers at the level of HSE06 level of theory is illustrated in Fig. S8 ESI.† Moreover, the structural and electronic parameters such as the lattice constant, band gap, CBM, VBM, lattice mismatch, and interlayer distance with binding energies of these optimized configurations are summarized in Table S7.†Fig. 9a shows the CBM and VBM of these eight monolayers (acceptor) and β-PdTe2 (donor). Encouragingly, the conduction band offset of β-PdS2, MoTe2 and WTe2 are calculated as 0.23 eV, 0.11 eV and 1 meV, resulting in high power conversion efficiency (PCE).

The PCE of β-PdTe2 based heterojunction solar cells was estimated by following the method of Scharber et al.81 The upper limit of PCE at the 100% external quantum efficiency can be expressed as the following:  Here P(ℏω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux (expressed in W m2 eV−1) at the photon energy ℏω, Eg is the band gap of the donor obtained from HSE06 calculations, and 0.65 is the band-bill factor deduced from Shockley–Queisser limit.82 The Jsc is the short circuit current assuming an external quantum efficiency of 100% and ΔEc is CBO between the donor and acceptor.
The PCEs of β-PdTe2 based heterojunction solar cells are shown in Fig. 9(b) (Table S8†). As donor materials, β-PdTe2 has a band gap of 1.29 eV, which is suitable for absorbing the solar spectrum. Also, the combined effects of the matched donor–acceptor band alignments lead to lower conduction band offset, resulting in high efficiency. The PCEs of β-PdTe2/β-PdS2, β-PdTe2/MoTe2 and β-PdTe2/WTe2 heterojunctions are calculated as 17.79%, 20.59% and 23.14%, respectively.

Table 1 lists the PCEs of vdW heterostructures and other 2D heterostructure solar cells for a more intuitive comparison. Our proposed β-PdTe2/β-PdS2, β-PdTe2/MoTe2 and β-PdTe2/WTe2 heterojunctions have a competitive edge over existing 2D heterojunction solar cells.

4. Conclusions
In summary, using first-principles calculations, we propose the 2D β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayers for efficient solar energy conversion applications. We systematically explored the stability, optoelectronic, photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties of the newly emerging β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayers. The thermal and kinetic stability evaluated based on AIMD simulations and phonon dispersion, and the energetics based on cleavage and cohesive energy suggests their feasibility for experimental synthesis. The moderate carrier mobility and pronounced light absorption ability of the β-PdX2 monolayer make them a suitable candidate for energy conversion devices. The β-PdS2 monolayer shows a considerable band gap of 2.10 eV, and redox potential is within band edge position of VBM and CBM. Especially, the photogenerated electrons have adequate driving forces to render the hydrogen reduction half-reactions proceed spontaneously on the β-PdS2 monolayer at pH = 0 to 4. Besides, the additional external potential of 1.97 V for OER and 0.13 V for HER would be needed to trigger the whole sequence for β-PdS2 monolayer at pH = 7. Moreover, the adsorption/intercalation energies of β-PdS2 revealed the coverage and incorporation of water molecules are energetically feasible with high STH efficiency. In addition, the 2D β-PdTe2, as characterized by a moderate bandgap of 1.29 eV, is a suitable donor material for constructing the heterostructure as an excitonic solar cell. The proposed β-PdTe2/β-PdS2, β-PdTe2/MoTe2 and β-PdTe2/WTe2 heterojunctions can achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 17.79%, 20.59% and 23.14%, respectively. It is expected that these new 2D β-PdS2 and β-PdTe2 monolayers can be applied in photocatalysis and photovoltaic in the near future.
