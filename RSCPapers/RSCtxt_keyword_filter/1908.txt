    , Accepted 3rd May 2017First published on 8th May 2017AbstractPhotosensitizers play a crucial role in p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (p-DSSCs). In this study, we first introduced two Dawson-type transition metal-substituted polyoxometalate dyes to co-sensitize the NiO electrode and achieved an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.0464%, which is the highest value reported for inorganic photosensitizers in p-DSSCs.
Energy crisis, environmental pollution, and population explosion are the most challenging issues that we human beings face and have to be urgently settled. Especially, the fast growing energy consumption is forcing scientists to find a clean, inexhaustible, and stable energy source. Fortunately, sunlight coming from the sun can just right meet the demand. As photovoltaic devices that can efficiently convert sunlight into electricity, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), invented by Grätzel in 1991,1 are one of the most promising devices to solve the energy shortage. Compared with conventional Si-based solar cells, DSSCs are a type of cost-effective thin-film solar cells that can be easily fabricated and have attracted significant attention from the researchers.2 p-DSSCs consist of a thin semiconductor film (such as NiO) coated on FTO as the photocathode. The dyes that are absorbed onto the film can harvest sunlight and be excited from the ground-state to excited-state, thus injecting holes into the semiconductor. The electrolyte (such as I−/I3−) that helps to regenerate the dyes and the counter electrode (mainly Pt coated FTO) are shown in Fig. 1.3–5
 Fig. 1  Energy levels of the photocathode, dye, and electrolyte in the p-DSSCs. 
Among all the parts of the p-DSSCs, photosensitizers play a vital role and have attracted significant attention from the scientists in this field. In 1999, Lindquist et al. created the first p-DSSC and introduced erythrosine B as the photosensitizer.3 Hammarström et al. introduced coumarin 343(C343) in 2005,4 synthesized a Ru-based photosensitizer in 20126 and prepared three new cyclometalated Irdium complexes to sensitize nanocrystalline NiO cathode in 2014.7 Sun et al. reported the organic dyes P1 in 20088 and then improved it with P4 in 2009.9 Bach et al. synthesized three new triphenylamine dyes in 2010,10 one of which, named PMI-6T-TPA, achieved highest PCE of p-DSSCs with the help of Co2+/3+ electrolyte.11 Wu et al. synthesized three organic dyes O2, O6, and O7 in 2011,12 three Ru-based dyes O8, O11, and O12 in 2012,13 and three triphenylamine-bearing cyclometalated Ru sensitizers O3, O13, and O17 in 2013.14 In addition, Guldi et al. also synthesized a number of photosensitizers with excellent performance.15–19 However, these sensitizers were synthesized using noble metals such as Ru or precious organic chemical materials that may hinder the application of p-DSSCs in the future.
Polyoxometalates (POM) are a unique class of transitional metal oxygen molecular cluster that have attracted significant attention from the researchers due to their excellent structural diversity, remarkable thermal stability, and superior optoelectronic and catalytic properties. Owing to their abundant source, POM are low cost materials and also have huge potential to be widely used due to their rich topology and versatility.20–29 Most POM may not absorb visible light; however, when the Mo or W atoms of the POM are substituted with transition metals, the transition metal substituted POM (TMSPs) can easily broaden their absorbance range to the visible region.30,31 Some TMSPs may have proper energy levels of LUMO and HOMO,32–34 which meet the demand of p-type dyes. Thus, there is a huge potential that TMSPs can be used as low-cost, thermally stable, and pure inorganic photosensitizers in p-DSSCs. In addition, TMSPs are easily synthesized via just several procedures under mild conditions. In our previous study, we first explored the pure inorganic photosensitizers in p-DSSCs.35 We employed three Keggin-type TMSPs as the pure inorganic photosensitizers and obtained a PCE of 0.038%. Moreover, Su et al. have carried out a guided study by designing POM-based dyes for p-DSSCs in theory.36,37 We have been trying to replace the precious organic photosensitizers with POM and construct low-cost p-type POM-sensitized solar cells (p-PSSCs).
In this study, we introduced two low-cost Dawson-type TMSPs, α2-K8P2W17O61(Co2+·OH2)·16H2O(P2W17Co) and α2-K7P2W17O61(Mn3+·OH2)·12H2O(P2W17Mn), for the first time into the p-PSSCs as photosensitizers. We explored the thermal stability, UV-Vis absorbance, and LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the two inorganic photosensitizers. P2W17Co and P2W17Mn show overall power efficiencies of 0.0406% and 0.0315%, respectively, when they work alone. Inspired by Grätzel's work reported in 1991 stating that the co-sensitization of dye YD2-o-C8 and dye Y123 enhanced the DSSC's PCE, we achieved a power conversion efficiency of 0.0464% when P2W17Co and P2W17Mn were used as co-sensitizers, which is 22.1% higher than that reported in our previous work.1,35
In this study, two new inorganic dyes with transition metal (Co and Mn) mono-substituted Dawson-type polyoxometalates, P2W17Co and P2W17Mn, previously synthesized and characterized by the Finke et al., were considered.38 The IR spectrum of P2W17Co shows five peaks, 1082 cm−1, 1010 cm−1, 942 cm−1, 912 cm−1, and 796 cm−1 (see the ESI, Fig. S1a†), which are consistent with the reported spectrum in the literature.38 The IR spectrum of P2W17Mn also displays five peaks, 1085 cm−1, 1020 cm−1, 948 cm−1, 915 cm−1, and 780 cm−1 (Fig. S1b†), which are also the same as the reported values. We then tested the thermal stability of P2W17Co and P2W17Mn from 25 °C to 600 °C via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S2†). The analysis suggested that P2W17Co had a molecular weight loss of 6.4% from 25 °C to 240 °C, corresponding to the presence of 17 crystal H2O molecules per polyoxometalate, whereas P2W17Mn underwent a similar process from 25 °C to 240 °C and showed a molecular weight loss of 5.3%, corresponding to 13 crystal H2O molecules per polyoxometalate. TGA of P2W17Co and P2W17Mn confirmed that they exhibited good thermal stability below 240 °C.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy in the range from 350 nm to 800 nm (Fig. 3) shows that below 600 nm, 1 mM P2W17Co and 1 mM P2W17Mn DMSO solution have good absorbance, which then decreases. Despite having a peak at 484 nm and a stronger absorbance between 450 nm and 575 nm, P2W17Mn lacks absorption in the 400 to 450 nm range. However, P2W17Co has a stronger absorbance range between 387 nm and 450 nm. This suggests that P2W17Co and P2W17Mn have potential to be used as co-sensitizers because a stronger UV-vis absorption from 350 nm to 500 nm can be achieved as compared to that obtained using a single dye. The addition of the transition metal atom (Co or Mn, in the center of the red octahedron in Fig. 2a and Fig. S3†) enhances the UV-vis absorption of P2W17Co and P2W17Mn in the visible region with respect to the precursor.

The optical band gap of each dye was estimated using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Fig. S4† displays the diffuse reflectance spectra and plots of the Kubelka–Munk function F against the band gap energy Eg for P2W17Co and P2W17Mn. F = (1 − R)2/2R, where R is the reflectance of an infinitely thick layer at a given wavelength. From the plots for P2W17Co and P2W17Mn, Eg values were calculated to be 1.67 eV and 1.70 eV, respectively. The LUMO level of each dye was also estimated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 4). The LUMO redox potential level of P2W17Co is −0.397 V, whereas for P2W17Mn, it is −0.367 V, corresponding to the 1e− reduction of the Co (or Mn) center in the polyoxometalates. According to the equation: E(HOMO) = E(LUMO) + Eg, the HOMO energy level can be easily calculated, giving the HOMO energy levels of P2W17Co and P2W17Mn as +1.333 V and +1.297 V, respectively.

Element mapping was used to verify that the three dyes were absorbed onto the NiO photocathode. Elements including Ni, P, W, and Co are homogeneously distributed in the P2W17Co-sensitized NiO photocathode (Fig. S5†). Similarly, elements including Ni, P, W, and Mn are homogeneously distributed in the P2W17Mn-sensitized NiO photocathode (Fig. S6†). Fig. 5 also depicts the elemental distributions of Ni, O, P, W, Co, and Mn in the P2W17Co/P2W17Mn co-sensitized NiO photocathode.

Sandwich-type solar cells were assembled using P2W17Co–, P2W17Mn– and P2W17Co/P2W17Mn-sensitized NiO film as the photocathode, a Pt-coated FTO glass as the counter electrode, and 1.0 M LiI and 0.1 M I2 in anhydrous acetonitrile as the electrolyte. As a function of wavelength, the incident monochromatic photo-to-electric current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is presented in Fig. 6b. It can be seen from the figure that P2W17Co has an IPCE of about 24.6%, and P2W17Mn has a slightly smaller IPCE of about 23.4%. Under the same conditions, P2W17Co/P2W17Mn gives the highest IPCE value of 27.8%, which is a slight improvement compared with the former two IPCE values. Moreover, it can be easily concluded from Fig. 6b that P2W17Co/P2W17Mn will have the highest efficiency among the three dyes.

The current–voltage characteristics of the same P2W17Co–, P2W17Mn– and P2W17Co/P2W17Mn-sensitized solar cells were measured under the same conditions (AM1.5G sunlight irradiation, 100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent density versus voltage curves of the three p-DSSCs are shown in Fig. 6a. Table 1 presents the photovoltaic parameters for the three cells. A batch of 9 devices (3 cells for each dye) is shown in Table S2.† The P2W17Co/P2W17Mn-sensitized solar cell exhibits a Jsc of 1.49 mA cm−2, a Voc of 102 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.305; this indicates a power efficiency of 0.0464%. The corresponding values for the P2W17Co-sensitized solar cell are 1.285 mA cm−2, 101 mV, 0.313, and 0.0406%, and those for the P2W17Mn-sensitized solar cell are 1.268 mA cm−2, 84 mV, 0.296, and 0.0315%. The Voc is limited by the small difference (about 200 mV) between the quasi-Fermi level of the NiO electrode (+0.54 V) and the electrochemical potential of the electrolyte (+0.34 V).

To test the stability of the polyoxometalate-based photovoltaics prepared via the aforementioned procedure, three devices were stored in the dark at room temperature and periodically measured for 200 h under the same conditions (Fig. 7). We found that the P2W17Mn-sensitized solar cell has the most stable open-circuit voltage and its open-circuit voltage was maintained at 82 mV after 200 h with an initial value of 84 mV. This is possibly due to P2W17Mn; the P2W17Co/P2W17Mn-sensitized solar cell also has a more stable open-circuit voltage than the P2W17Mn-sensitized solar cell. Although the Voc and FF of the P2W17Co/P2W17Mn-sensitized solar cell obviously decayed in the first 50 hours, the cells maintained their parameters in the remaining 150 hours. However, decrease in all Jsc, FF, and PCE values can also be observed. Overall, the devices retained 69.8%, 75.1%, and 76.9% of their initial PCE for the P2W17Co/P2W17Mn–, P2W17Co–, and P2W17Mn-sensitized solar cells, respectively.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the first two low-cost Dawson-type transition metal monosubstituted polyoxometalates were introduced into p-PSSCs and played the role of photosensitizers. Moreover, when the two polyoxometalates dyes worked together, they achieved a conversion efficiency of 0.0464%. This is the highest efficiency for pure inorganic photosensitizers in p-PSSCs reported to date. Moreover, the three types of devices show a good stability over 200 h. This study demonstrates the strategy whereby employing some inorganic photosensitizers to construct a stronger inorganic co-sensitizer affords huge potential to help exploit green solar energy in the future.
