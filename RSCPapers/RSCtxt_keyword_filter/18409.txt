    , Accepted 10th September 2017First published on 11th September 2017AbstractConjugated block copolymers simultaneously control the mesoscale morphology and interfacial structure of the active layer in organic electronic devices. Fully conjugated block copolymers, where both backbones are conjugated, are commonly synthesized in two steps. First, poly(3-alkylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) is synthesized by Kumada catalyst transfer/Grignard metathesis polymerization. The second block, typically a push–pull alternating copolymer, is added on to the P3HT macroreagent in a chain-extension reaction using either a Suzuki or a Stille polycondensation. Consequently, products can be a mixture of homopolymers, diblock copolymers, and multi-block copolymers. We demonstrate the optimum reaction conditions for the two-step synthesis of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)-block-poly((9,9-bis-(2-octyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,7-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5′,5′′-diyl) (P3HT-b-PFTBT), a block copolymer that can be used as the sole active-layer material in organic photovoltaic devices. In the first reaction, preventing excess Grignard reagent to avert excess in the stoichiometry between Grignard reagent and monomer ensures end-group control of the P3HT macroreagent. In the second reaction, asymmetric monomer feed ratios with excess fluorene promotes coupling of PFTBT to P3HT. Using P3HT-b-PFTBT as an example, we demonstrate the synthetic parameters that are important to produce diblock copolymers with minimal impurities. This, in turn, promotes microphase separation in block copolymer films and leads to enhanced power conversion efficiencies in block copolymer solar cell devices.
1. Introduction
In fully conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers, an electron donor and acceptor are covalently linked such that conjugation is not broken. They can be used as the sole-component of the photoactive layers in organic solar cells. Importantly, when fully conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers are used in organic photovoltaic devices, mesoscale self-assembly facilitates the formation of donor and acceptor domains on the order of the exciton diffusion length in organic materials.1–15 Unlike polymer–fullerene and polymer–polymer blends, conjugated block copolymers provide an equilibrium microstructure that is not subject to coarsening with age as well as control of the molecular configuration at the donor–acceptor interface.16–18 In addition to their applications in organic electronics, conjugated block copolymers can offer a platform to examine fundamental questions regarding optoelectronic properties of conducting polymers.2–5
There are various approaches for the synthesis of fully conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers. One of the most widely used approaches, Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization (KCTP), also referred to as Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization or simply catalyst transfer polymerization (CTP), follows a controlled, chain-growth mechanism. CTP can be used to synthesize fully conjugated block copolymers by sequential injection of donor and acceptor monomers.19 Unfortunately, CTP is almost exclusively limited to the polymerization of electron-donating monomers including thiophene,20 selenophene,21–23 pyrrole,24 phenylene,25 fluorene,26 and cyclopentadithiophene.27 In an effort to enhance monomer versatility, it is common to use a two-step approach. The first block is synthesized via CTP which, in the absence of deleterious side reactions and after appropriately quenching the reaction, results in one end of each chain functionalized with bromine.22–32 This is followed by a chain-extension reaction using a metal-mediated cross-coupling polycondensation reaction, such as Yamamoto,6,16,33 Stille,7,34 Suzuki,1,14,35–38 or direct arylation polycondensation39 to grow the second block. This strategy relies on the end-group control of the first block. Nevertheless, the step-growth nature of the polycondensation inevitably leads to a mixture of products composed of homopolymers, diblock copolymers, and multi-block copolymers. Optimization of the synthetic parameters is critical in minimizing architectural heterogeneity and maximizing the yield of block copolymers.
Our previous work has demonstrated the synthesis of the fully conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymer poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)-block-poly((9,9-bis-(2-octyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,7-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5′,5′′-diyl) (P3HT-b-PFTBT) and its use as the single active layer material in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices having power conversion efficiencies of 3%.1–5,35 Although these results demonstrate the potential for the use of conjugated block copolymers in photovoltaic devices, the materials contained a significant amount of homopolymer impurities.
In this work, we highlight the synthetic parameters required to minimize homopolymer impurities in P3HT-b-PFTBT. Our synthetic method utilizes a common approach for the synthesis of fully conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers: P3HTs made by CTP with a high degree of Br chain end functionality, which we refer to as “P3HT-Br”, followed by a polycondensation chain extension reaction to add the PFTBT block. Our results identify two key parameters that establish the polymerization conditions: (1) precise quantification of the amount of Grignard reagent used to make the regiospecific monomers in order to maximize end-group control of the first block; and (2) the monomer feed ratio for the second step to control the relative number of chains of each block. Gel permeation chromatography traces obtained from a multi-wavelength detector shows that this optimized process produces P3HT-b-PFTBT with minimal homopolymer impurities. In turn, minimizing homopolymer impurities enhances microphase separation in block copolymer thin films and maximizes power conversion efficiencies when films are used as the active layer in organic solar cells.
2. Experimental section
Grignard reagent concentration measurements
Isopropylmagnesium chloride lithium chloride complex (iPrMgCl) solutions (∼1.3 M in THF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Accurate concentration of the Grignard reagent was determined using an acid-base titration. The iPrMgCl was diluted in THF and quenched with excess water, forming Mg(OH)Cl and isopropane. Dilute hydrochloric acid was carefully titrated into the solution and the concentration of the iPrMgCl solution was back-calculated from the equivalence point. The final concentration of the Grignard reagent was determined by averaging at least four trials.
Synthesis of P3HTs
Three batches of P3HT were synthesized using different molar ratios of iPrMgCl. Other than the molar ratio of iPrMgCl, all other synthetic parameters were kept consistent. The batches are referred to by the molar equivalents of iPrMgCl used: either P3HT(1.25), P3HT(1.0), or P3HT(0.75). First, a reactor was charged with 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (7.67 mmol, 2.50 g) and placed under vacuum for about two minutes and back-filled with nitrogen. Freshly dried THF (6 mL) was injected while purging with nitrogen. The iPrMgCl (either 1.25, 1.0, 0.75 eq. based on 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene) was injected dropwise at 0 °C and allowed to react for 3 h. The reaction mixture then was diluted with an additional 45 mL of THF. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mol% of [1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]dichloronickel(II) (Ni(dppp)Cl2). The mixture was allowed to react for 20 minutes at room temperature, at which point 3 mL of 5 M HCl was injected to quench the polymerization. The reaction mixture was precipitated into 500 mL of chilled methanol and subsequently purified by sequential Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone, and hexane.
Synthesis of P3HT-b-PFTBT
Using P3HT(1.0), three different batches of P3HT-b-PFTBT were synthesized in a chain extension reaction using different feed ratios of the monomers 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid bis(1,3-propanediol) (F) and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TBT). For clarity, the different batches will be referred to according to the molar ratio of F:TBT used: 0.91:1 for excess TBT, 1:1 for symmetric feed ratio, or 1:0.82 for excess F. A reactor was charged with P3HT macroreagent (120 mg), F and TBT monomers (134 mg/120 mg for excess TBT, 134 mg/108 mg for symmetric feed ratio, and 147 mg/98 mg for excess F), and toluene (16 mL). The reactor was purged with nitrogen for about 10 minutes at which time tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution (5 mL, 20 wt% in H2O), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (21 mg), and a few drops of Aliquat 336 were injected. The reaction mixture was degassed with three freeze–pump–thaw cycles and back-filled with nitrogen. The mixture was heated to 90 °C for 20 hours. The reaction was terminated by injecting bromobenzene (3 mL), which then end-caps chains with boronic acid ends groups (F terminal groups). The aqueous phase was discarded and the organic phase was precipitated into 500 mL of chilled methanol. The raw product was re-dissolved in toluene and heated to 90 °C for 12 hours at which point it was precipitated again in 500 mL of chilled methanol, and subsequently purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, and hexane.
Polymer characterization
Molar mass distributions of all polymers were determined using an Agilent Technologies gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) (ResiPore 300 × 7.5 mm column, Agilent 1260) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID), a viscometer (VS), a light scattering detector (LS) and a multiwavelength detector. Chlorobenzene was used as the mobile phase at 80 °C and 1 mL min−1. Molar mass distributions were determined relative to polystyrene standards.
End-group composition of P3HTs was measured by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Bruker Ultraflextreme MALDI TOF/TOF instrument equipped with 2 kHz Bruker smartbeam-II solid state laser. trans-2-[3-(4-tert-Butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB, >99%, Fluka) was used as the matrix. 20 mg mL−1 of DCTB and 10 mg mL−1 of P3HT in THF were prepared separately, and combined in a 5:1 DCTB:P3HT ratio. 1 μL was applied to the target and allowed to dry. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive-ion reflector mode using the factory default parameters file for the 700–3500 m/z detection range modified for 700–5000 m/z detection. The laser sampling rate was 0.2 ns, and 2000 to 6000 shots were acquired for each spectrum. Poly(propyleneglycol) 2700 (Sigma-Aldrich) [M + Na]+ monoisotopic masses were used for external calibration.
The molecular weight of P3HT and composition of P3HT-b-PFTBT was determined by 1H NMR analysis using deuterated chloroform as the solvent. Together, these were used to determine the number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) of the block copolymers. Weight-averaged molecular weights (Mw) were determined using the dispersity Đ obtained from GPC. NMR spectrometry was performed on a Bruker 500 MHz instrument (Avance III HD500).
Device fabrication
Photovoltaic devices were prepared using a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (70 nm)/active layer (80–100 nm)/Al electrode (75 nm).40 Film thickness was determined on a TENCOR P-10 surface profiler. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P, Heraeus) was spin-coated onto ITO coated glass substrates (20 ohm per sq, Xin Yan Technology, Hong Kong) at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes and subsequently dried at 165 °C for 10 min. The substrate was then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box for further processing. The active layer was cast by spin-coating a 7.0 g L−1 solution of P3HT-b-PFTBT in chloroform/chlorobenzene 80/20 (vol/vol) at 800 rpm for 60 seconds and immediately dried at 165 °C for 5 minutes. The top electrode was deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation of aluminum at 10−6 Torr on top of the active layer through a shadow mask (device area = 16.2 mm2). Integrated solar cells were further annealed at 165 °C for various times.
Photovoltaic measurements were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (97 mW cm−2) from a xenon lamp solar simulator (Newport Model SP92250A-1000). The illumination intensity was calibrated using an optical power meter and NREL certified Si reference photocell (Newport). A Keithley 2636A Sourcemeter was used to measure the current–voltage characteristics of devices in the light and dark.
Morphology characterization
Morphologies of P3HT-b-PFTBT thin films were investigated using resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) at beam line 11.0.1.2 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.41 Samples were prepared by spin-coating the active layer onto PEDOT:PSS/Si substrates, according to device processing conditions. Substrates were immersed in deionized water and as-cast films were floated-off onto 5 mm × 5 mm silicon frames supporting a 1 mm × 1 mm, 100 nm thick silicon nitride window. Samples were then dried for 24 hours at room temperature under vacuum and subsequently annealed at 165 °C in a nitrogen filled glovebox for 30 minutes. Scattering experiments were performed at the carbon K-edge (285.0 eV).
3. Results and discussion
CTP is a controlled chain-growth polymerization that enables control over the chain end-groups; the reaction proceeds in two steps.29–32,42–45 First, upon the addition of one equivalent of an organomagnesium chloride Grignard reagent, 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene undergoes a metal–halogen exchange, forming 2-bromo-5-chloromagnesio-3-hexylthiophene and 2-chloromagnesio-5-bromo-3-hexylthiophene in roughly a 3:1 ratio. Chain-growth polymerization is initiated by a nickel(II) catalyst and often terminated with a concentrated acid44,46 or a Grignard reagent (if an end-group is desired).28–30,47 Due to steric hindrance of the 3-hexyl chain, only the 2-bromo-5-magnesiochloride-3-hexylthiophene monomer is polymerized, facilitating regioregular P3HT. After reductive elimination, rather than diffusing away from the growing chain, the catalyst forms an associated complex with the π-electron system and undergoes intramolecular oxidative addition. This process affords the controlled chain-growth mechanism.
In principle, the population of P3HT chains produced from a well-controlled CTP should each contain one end having a bromine and the other end having a hydrogen, which we refer to as an H/Br chain. The Br end group originates from the first coupled dimer that is formed upon initiation and the “living end” of the chain is protonated when the polymerization is quenched with a strong acid. Unreacted Grignard reagent, as the result of adding an excess of the reagent, can react with the Br end of a growing chain by a metal–halogen exchange, though it has also been suggested that Ni(0) catalyst can “walk” and activate the other end of the chain.48,49 Both of these effects would lead to protonation of both chain ends upon quenching with an acid, resulting in H/H P3HT chains. Br/Br P3HT occurs when both P3HT chain ends are brominated as a result of metathesis or homocoupling reactions.50 In practice, P3HT synthesized by CTP will contain a mixture of H/Br, H/H, and Br/Br end-groups.
As shown in Fig. 1, H/Br P3HT is crucial for the synthesis of well-defined diblock copolymers. H/H P3HT is not able to participate in the chain-extension reaction, resulting in homopolymer impurities, and Br/Br P3HT chains are more likely to form multi-block copolymers.
 Fig. 1  Reaction scheme for the synthesis of P3HT-b-PFTBT. P3HT prepared by GRIM is used as a macroreagent in a Suzuki polycondensation with 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid bis(1,3-propanediol) ester and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole. Even with complete end group control of P3HT, a variety of products are possible after the Suzuki polymerization: unreacted P3HT homopolymer, PFTBT homopolymer, P3HT-b-PFTBT diblock, and multiblock copolymers such as P3HT-b-PFTBT-b-P3HT triblocks. 
In order to maximize the H/Br content, it is necessary to optimize reaction conditions, especially the molar equivalent of Grignard reagent used. In order to set the stoichiometric ratio, analogously to procedures reported by Kochemba et al.,28,29 it was essential to accurately quantify the concentration of iPrMgCl through titration. Three P3HT samples were prepared with either an excess (1.25 eq.), equimolar (1.0 eq.), or deficient (0.75 eq.) quantity of iPrMgCl relative to the 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene starting material. Molar mass data are shown in Table 1. P3HT(x) denotes P3HT prepared with x eq. of the Grignard reagent. P3HT(1.0) was used as the macroreagent in the chain extension reaction for P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymers.
P3HT end group composition was determined by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), as shown in Fig. 2. The fraction of each end group was calculated by the relative peak intensities of the distributions corresponding to H/H, H/Br, and Br/Br chains. P3HT with excess Grignard reagent, P3HT(1.25), was found to have 73% H/Br chains. P3HT with equimolar and deficient Grignard reagent, P3HT(1.0) and P3HT(0.75), were calculated to have >90% H/Br chains. As expected, excess Grignard leads to an increase in the relative abundance of H/H chains. P3HT(0.75) had a significantly lower yield than P3HT(1.0) (16% vs. 36%). We suspect this is because a deficit of iPrMgCl limits conversion of 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene to the active, regiospecific monomer.

 Fig. 2  MALDI-TOF mass spectra for P3HTs synthesized from regiospecific monomers made using different feed ratios of the Grignard reagent: (a) excess (1.25 eq.), (b) equivalent (1.0 eq.), and (c) less (0.75 eq.) relative to the monomer. P3HT synthesized with excess Grignard shows significant heterogeneity in end-group population. 
Having established the crucial parameters for synthesizing P3HTs with a high degree of end-group control, we now demonstrate efficient coupling to P3HT chain ends using a model reaction consisting of coupling P3HT-Br with a mono-functional fluorene monomer to make P3HT-F (Fig. 3a). To assess degree of conversion, we make use of the triplet signal present in 1H NMR at 2.55 ppm that corresponds to the α methylene (CH2) group of the hexyl side chain on the terminal 3-hexylthiophene repeat unit having a bromine at the 2 position.34 This signal is clearly evident in the P3HT macroreagent but not observed in the P3HT-F product (Fig. S2†). Based on the unique signals attributed to α methylenes at the H end (2.60 ppm) and Br end (2.55 ppm), we calculate 92% conversion for functionalization of fluorene at the end of P3HT macroreagents (Table S1†).
 Fig. 3  (a) Reaction scheme for synthesizing a fluorene-capped P3HT by Suzuki coupling and MALDI-TOF mass spectra of (b) the starting P3HT and (c) the end-functionalized product from the coupling reaction. H/Br and Br/Br end groups in the starting P3HT disappeared, while the H/H end group was not influenced. New peaks corresponding to fluorene end groups appeared in the product. 
MALDI-TOF MS analysis also was used to demonstrate the functionalization of the end group. In the starting material, there are three different molar mass distributions corresponding to H/Br, H/H, and Br/Br end group populations, although the Br/Br population is very small (Fig. 3b). In P3HT-F, peaks assigned to H/Br and Br/Br terminated chains were not observed; rather a new population corresponding to P3HT chains having H/F end groups is observed. The amount of chains with F/F end groups is likely too low to be observed due to the low abundance of Br/Br chains in the P3HT macroreagent.
The addition of F to P3HT leads to an increase in solubility, which results in some P3HT-F dissolution and loss during purification. The overall yield of this reaction was 60%, where the majority of the loss of product occurred during Soxhlet purification in hexanes. As a consequence, the concentration of chains with H/H ends was enhanced, as shown in the MALDI-TOF MS data in Fig. 3c. Nevertheless, this model reaction proves that terminal bromine groups on P3HT chains are synthetically accessible and able to participate in end-functionalization or chain-extension reactions, such as in the synthesis of the block copolymer P3HT-b-PFTBT.
Polycondensation reactions, such as those based on Stille or Suzuki coupling, follow an uncontrolled step-growth mechanism. In the limit of complete conversion, the Carothers equation predicts that: (1)where  is the number-average degree of polymerization and r is molar ratio of monomers.51,52 Thus, in an otherwise uncontrolled step-growth reaction, some control can be exerted over the molar mass distribution and total number of polymer chains by carefully tuning r. We use this concept to synthesize P3HT-b-PFTBT. There are two possible events that give rise to diblocks: diblocks result when a PFTBT block is grown from the end of the P3HT-Br chain by a Suzuki polycondensation, or P3HT-Br can end-cap a growing PFTBT chain. Balancing the relative number of P3HT-Br chains added to the reaction and PFTBT chains synthesized during the reaction should minimize homopolymer impurities. Therefore, the feed ratio of fluorene (F) and benzothiadiazole (TBT) monomers must be carefully optimized. We investigated the influence of the monomer feed ratio on the synthesis of P3HT-b-PFTBT using the same P3HT block. We also fabricated solar cell devices using the synthesized block copolymers and examined their performance and thin film morphology.
Three P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymer samples were prepared using a P3HT macroreagent, P3HT(1.0), with different feed ratio of monomers. We define y as the mole percent of F out of the total amount of monomer added (F and TBT monomers) and refer to the synthesized block copolymers as “P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(y)”. By varying y, we synthesized P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.48), P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.50), and P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55). GPC traces of the block copolymers overlaid with the P3HT macroreagent are presented in Fig. 4. We attribute peaks appearing at a retention time of ∼15 minutes to diblock copolymers, while peaks at ∼16 minutes are attributed to unreacted P3HT. We suspect that the periodic peaks between ∼16 and 18 minutes correspond to PFTBT homopolymers because the same periodic peaks appear in the GPC trace of PFTBT homopolymers (Fig. 5c). The peaks located at 16.6 min, 17 min, and 17.8 min correspond to polystyrene-relative molecular weights of 6 kg mol−1, 4 kg mol−1 and 2 kg mol−1, respectively. Because GPC is known to overestimate the molecular weight of conjugated polymers,50,53–55 we assign these peaks to three repeat units (2.1 kg mol−1), two repeat units (1.4 kg mol−1) and a single repeat unit (0.69 kg mol−1). As y used in the PFTBT synthesis increases, the peak attributed to diblock copolymer grows with a corresponding decrease in the peaks attributed to P3HT and PFTBT homopolymers.

Trace for P3HT is shown as a gray dashed curve.

The fractions of homopolymer impurities in block copolymers were quantified by deconvoluting GPC traces (Table 2) assuming Gaussian peak shapes. The molar mass distribution of each block copolymer were determined by GPC and the relative composition of each block was determined by analysis of the corresponding 1H NMR spectrum. In conjunction with the molecular weight of the P3HT block (5.0 kg mol−1) obtained from NMR, the composition then yields the total molecular weight of the block copolymers, where weight-average molecular weights are obtained from the dispersities using Ɖ = Mw/Mn. GPC traces reveal that homopolymer impurities indeed drop as expected from 57 to 19% as y increases from 0.48 to 0.55.

When y = 0.48, which indicates that TBT is present in excess, the molar mass of PFTBT should be limited by eqn (1). Although, in principle, most chains will be capped with TBT on both ends. Thus, we expect that the majority of PFTBT chains cannot react with the brominated P3HT macroreagent and therefore contribute to the homopolymer impurities in P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.48).
When y is increased to 0.55, F is in molar excess, and the molar mass of synthesized PFTBT is again controlled by eqn (1). Furthermore, in principle, there is a preference for PFTBT chains to be capped with an F repeat unit. The boronic acid ester on those terminal F repeats can undergo metal-catalyzed cross-coupling with the Br group on P3HT. This stoichiometry facilitates maximum formation of P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymers while minimizing homopolymer impurities within a given reaction. The block copolymer yield is calculated by multiplying the yield of total product by the fraction of block copolymer as shown in Table 2. P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55) has the highest yield of block copolymer.
GPC with UV-vis detection was used to distinguish P3HT and PFTBT homopolymer impurities versus diblock copolymers in P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55) (Fig. 5). Peak positions in terms of wavelength and retention time are 540 nm and ∼15 minutes, respectively. Compared to P3HT(1.0), P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55) displays a red shift in absorbance as well as a lower retention time. When compared to the GPC traces of PFTBT homopolymers (Fig. 5c), the red shift in absorbance suggests the incorporation of PFTBT. The decreased retention time indicates increased molar mass, suggesting a successful chain-extension and formation of diblock copolymer. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that the apparent chain extension is due to high molecular weight PFTBT homopolymers instead of block copolymers; as shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI,† blending PFTBT with P3HT also results in a broader absorption.
To demonstrate that a chain-extension of the P3HT chains took place, we use additional wavelength-dependent GPC analyses. Comparing the GPC traces for P3HT(1.0) and a PFTBT homopolymer in Fig. 5, it is apparent that the absorbance at 420 nm is mainly attributed to P3HT. Fig. 6 shows GPC traces at various wavelengths, where the peak retention time of P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55) at 420 nm is significantly lower than that of P3HT(1.0). The presence of P3HT (absorbance at 420 nm) at retention times larger than that for P3HT(1.0) confirms a chain-extension and therefore formation of block copolymers.

A gradual shift in the peak position as a function of wavelength can be attributed to changes in composition of block copolymers. We suspect that higher molar mass block copolymers have relatively more PFTBT, causing an effective red-shift in absorbance. We attribute the shoulder at longer retention times, which is increasingly enhanced at shorter wavelengths, to unreacted P3HT homopolymer. Furthermore, a peak at low retention times is significantly enhanced at increasingly higher wavelengths. We suspect this is due to the formation of triblock copolymers, likely PFTBT-b-P3HT-b-PFTBT from the 6% of P3HT with Br/Br end groups. This high molar mass peak could also be the result of aggregation of highly insoluble block copolymers with long PFTBT chains.
We use resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) to characterize block copolymer thin films. Scattering of processed block copolymer films was recorded at the carbon K-edge (285.0 eV); the Kratky plots (I(q)q2vs. q) are presented in Fig. 7 and intensity vs. q is shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55) yields a primary scattering peak at q* ∼ 0.034 Å−1, corresponding to a domain size of approximately 18 nm. A broad shoulder around q ∼ 0.034 Å−1 is observed in the 1D plot of P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.50). Relatively more-defined features in the RSoXS trace of P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55) suggest enhanced microphase separation, possibly due to the minimal homopolymer impurities present in this sample. A broad shoulder at q* ∼ 0.028 Å−1, corresponding to a domain size of approximately 22 nm, is observed in P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.48). In this sample, we suspect that large quantities of homopolymer impurities caused domains to swell, thus increasing the domain size from about 18 to about 22 nm.

Intensities of the plot are shifted vertically for comparison. 
Solar cell devices using synthesized P3HT-b-PFTBT as the sole-active layer material were fabricated using optimal processing conditions previously established.1,2J–V curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 8 and a summary of device parameters are listed in Table 3. All devices show a kink near the open-circuit voltage that is likely due to problems with charge extraction or charge recombination in P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymer and P3HT/PFTBT blend devices.1,2 On average, P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55) exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.2 ± 0.1%; the efficiency in P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55) was approximately two times greater than in devices made from either P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.48) or P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.50). Furthermore, the short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor are all maximized in the devices made from P3HT(1.0)-b-PFTBT(0.55). These results highlight the importance of minimizing homopolymer impurities to maximize power conversion efficiencies in block copolymer solar cells.

4. Summary and conclusions
This work demonstrates that controlling conversion of the first CTP block and monomer feed ratio when synthesizing the second block is critical to yield well-defined, fully conjugated block copolymers with minimal homopolymer impurities. We found that a crucial parameter to control conversion in the synthesis of P3HT is determining an accurate concentration of the Grignard reagent by a simple acid/base titration, leading to P3HT with >90% H/Br end-groups. We further demonstrated that P3HT-Br is able to undergo a chain-extension reaction to form a diblock copolymer. When synthesizing P3HT-b-PFTBT from a polycondensation with a P3HT-Br macroreagent, carefully adjusting the F/TBT monomer feed ratio ensures a chain extension from P3HT and facilitates control over the molar mass of PFTBT. Altogether, tuning the aforementioned parameters lead to P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymers with minimal homopolymer impurities, enhanced microphase separation, and higher power conversion solar cell efficiencies when used as the active layer in devices.

Even with complete end group control of P3HT, a variety of products are possible after the Suzuki polymerization: unreacted P3HT homopolymer, PFTBT homopolymer, P3HT-b-PFTBT diblock, and multiblock copolymers such as P3HT-b-PFTBT-b-P3HT triblocks.
