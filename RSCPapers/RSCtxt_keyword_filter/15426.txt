    , Accepted 8th April 2019First published on 17th April 2019AbstractSolar water splitting using photoelectrochemical cells (PEC's) is a promising pathway toward clean and sustainable storage of renewable energy. Practical realization of solar-driven synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen integrating light absorption and electrolysis of water has been challenging because of (1) the limited stability of good photovoltaic materials under the required electrochemical conditions, and (2) photovoltaic efficiency losses due to light absorption by catalysts, the electrolyte, and generated bubbles, or reflection at their various interfaces. Herein, we evaluate a novel integrated solar water splitting architecture using efficient silicon heterojunction photovoltaic cells that avoids such losses and exhibits a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency in excess of 10%. Series-connected silicon Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin layer (HIT) cells generate sufficient photovoltage for unassisted water splitting, with one of the cells acting as the photocathode. Platinum is deposited on the back (dark) junction of this HIT cell as the catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The photocathode is protected from corrosion by a TiO2 layer deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) interposed between the HIT cell and the Pt, enabling stable operation for >120 hours. Combined with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts deposited on a porous metal dark anode, these PEC's achieve stable water splitting with a record high STH efficiency for an integrated silicon photosynthesis device.
Introduction
The past decade has seen growing adoption of clean and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar as an alternative to fossils fuels for generation of electric power. Solar power has drawn great interest due to its abundance – approximately 120000 TW of solar energy is, in principle, accessible globally,1 dwarfing humanity's global power consumption. Photovoltaic cells can capture a portion of this vast energy source and convert it to electricity, with a long-term trend of increasing efficiency and decreasing cost.2 However, the intermittent nature of sunlight is an obstacle to large-scale grid implementation of solar energy, as it will eventually require some form of energy storage to act as a reservoir to allow constant and on-demand delivery of power.
One possible solution to this problem is solar-driven electrolysis of water, which collects and stores solar energy in the form of the chemical bonds in molecular fuels, such as hydrogen. Hydrogen is storable and transportable, and can either be combusted or recombined with oxygen in a fuel cell to generate electricity when it is needed. Hydrogen can also be used as feedstock for ammonia fertilizer production, essential to global food supply, and the protons and electrons produced by water oxidation are required ingredients for electrochemical synthesis of liquid fuels by CO2 reduction.3
There are two major paradigms for water splitting systems: (1) an integrated photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) in which a photoabsorber is electrically coupled to efficient catalysts for water oxidation and/or hydrogen evolution; and (2) separate photovoltaic and electrochemical cells (“PV + electrolyzer”) which are wired together. There is considerable debate about the relative merits of these two approaches. Analysis of the costs of solar-to-hydrogen systems have provided estimates ranging from ∼$3–10 per kg for integrated PEC's4,5 and ∼$5–8 per kg for PV + electrolyzer systems.6,7 These projected costs are similar and the ranges are overlapping. PV + electrolyzer systems have the practical advantage of utilizing off-the-shelf technologies such as commercial silicon solar cells and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. However, PEM electrolyzers operate at large current densities (1–2 A cm−2) and use large loadings of expensive noble metal catalysts.8 Advantages of PEC's are (1) the potential simplicity of an integrated design, (2) their compact foot-print in which a similar projected device area can be used for light absorption and electrochemistry, and (3) their ability to accommodate a wide range of catalysts because they operate at electrolysis current densities better matched to solar photocurrent densities.
PEC cells have been widely studied since 1972, when Fujishima and Honda reported the first demonstration of photoelectrochemical water splitting using a single crystal TiO2 photoanode and a Pt cathode.9 Since then, there have been significant technical advances in PEC cell technology. Due to the relatively high voltage (typically ≥ 1.8 V) that is required to drive the overall water splitting reaction, coupled with the requirements for stability in contact with aqueous solutions for the conduction and valence bands of the semiconductor to straddle the potentials for proton reduction and water oxidation, only materials with wide band gaps, such as TiO2, WO3, SrTiO3, and SiC are capable of unassisted water splitting in a single junction device.10–12 However, the band gap requirement means that such devices have low STH efficiencies as they can only absorb a small portion of the solar spectrum. To overcome this efficiency problem, solar-powered PEC water splitting devices can employ a multijunction architecture with two or three cells connected in series in order to provide the necessary operating voltage.13–15
For such a technology to be commercially viable, devices for water splitting must be efficient, stable, and have a path to low cost at large scale. Most of the top-performing devices for unassisted water splitting reported thus far, however, utilize expensive III–V materials such as InGaP and GaAs, which are unlikely to be economical without significant solar concentration.15–17 These absorber materials, along with others such as the perovskites, are also generally unstable under oxidizing potentials and, in some cases, under reducing potentials14 and are unlikely to be used for large scale applications in the near-term future.18,19
In order to be commercially viable, inexpensive materials such as silicon have to be used as the photoabsorber material. Other groups have previously investigated using tandem and triple-junction a-Si solar cells as photocathodes for water splitting, achieving as high as 2.93% (ref. 20) and 7.8% (ref. 21–24) STH efficiency conversion respectively. However, the stability of the photocathodes were mostly limited to a few hours in the concentrated acid and base electrolytes investigated. Reece et al. used a triple junction a-Si cell as a photoanode in 1 M potassium borate buffer, achieving a 4.7% STH efficiency and 3 hours of stable operation.25 Urbain et al. reported a STH efficiency of 9.5% using a monolithic a-Si: H/a-Si: H/lc-Si: H/lc-Si: H quadruple junction solar cell as the photocathode in 1 M KOH, however it was stable for less than 1000 s.26 More recently, groups have studied using silicon heterojunction solar cells to achieve greater STH efficiencies. Silicon Heterojunction with Intrinsic Thin layer (HIT) solar cells have demonstrated high open circuit voltages of over 740 mV, short circuit current densities over 40 mA cm−2, and photovoltaic efficiencies as high as 25.6% due to the excellent passivation of the c-Si by ultrathin intrinsic a-Si layers, making them an excellent candidate for water splitting with superior performance over the likes of a-Si solar cells.27,28 Song et al.29 demonstrated 9.54% STH efficiency in 1 M NaOH using four such cells connected in series, while Schüttauf et al.30 achieved 14.2% using three cells in series in 1 M KOH. While they reported operating stabilities of 25 h and 100 h respectively, this was achieved using a “PV + electrolyzer” configuration, where the silicon solar cells are not in contact in the electrolyte. This results in a bulkier and potentially more expensive device. In the latter case,30 the active area for electrolysis was over 10 times greater than that of the silicon cells.
We present an efficient, integrated solar water splitting device using silicon HIT cells. A corrosion-resistant ALD TiO2 protection layer imparts chemical stability while electrically coupling the HIT cell to an efficient HER catalysts, enabling the HIT cells to operate in contact with either highly-corrosive electrolytes such as 1 M H2SO4 or with pH 7 buffer solution without any loss of photovoltaic performance. This negates a common disadvantage of the integrated design over a PV + electrolyzer configuration – the poor stability of the absorber material under electrochemical reaction conditions. In the reported device design, light absorption and catalytic activity occur on different sides of the device, circumventing the parasitic losses caused by light scattering/absorption by the catalysts, electrolyte, protection layers, and generated bubbles,30,31 problems commonly suffered by other reported integrated devices.32 The cell design also avoids any possible instability of silicon under anodic potentials. By connecting three silicon HIT solar cells in series, using an atomic layer deposited (ALD) TiO2 protection layer, and contacting the silicon photocathode with a porous metal dark anode across a thin electrochemical flow cell, unassisted water splitting with >10% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency under one sun illumination is demonstrated. This is, to our knowledge, the highest reported efficiency for integrated devices using silicon absorbers only, exceeding that of other reports of water splitting devices using tandem or triple-junction amorphous silicon heterojunction solar cells arranged in series.21,22,24–26,33 The protected HIT cell photocathode was chemically unchanged after 120 hours of operation in concentrated acid, and suffered no loss in water splitting efficiency, showing it is possible to match, or even exceed, both the efficiency and stability of PV + electrolyzer configurations29,30,34,35 with a much more compact, integrated design.
Experimental
Preparation of silicon HIT cell
Bifacial silicon HIT cells were obtained from Sunpreme§, which use thin amorphous silicon films to produce a p–i–(Si substrate)–i–n junction. Each of the four amorphous Si films is ultra-thin at about 10 nm thick. The cell current is collected by blanket layers of transparent indium tin oxide on both faces, with metallized copper grids deposited on top to enhance electrical conduction. More details about the cells are included in S18 of the ESI.† For the purposes of testing, 6-inch by 6-inch Si HIT cells are laser cut into 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm pieces.
The HIT cells are cleaned using a Diener Pico oxygen plasma cleaner for 2 minutes to remove the impurities and contaminants on the surface. ALD TiO2 is deposited on the ITO coating on the n-type back side of the HIT cells by atomic layer deposition (ALD) in a custom-built load-locked ALD reactor, using tetrakisdimethylamido-titanium (TDMAT) and H2O as the titanium and oxygen precursors respectively at a substrate temperature of either 45 °C or 150 °C. The TDMAT bubbler temperature is kept at 80 °C and the ALD chamber base pressure is about 1.0 × 10−6 Torr. The TiO2 film thickness and growth rate are determined by ellipsometry on a Si (100) test wafer that is placed in the ALD reactor alongside the HIT cell during deposition, and also confirmed with X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging.
Metallization is done in a Kurt J. Lesker sputtering system. The sides of the HIT cells are masked by Kapton tape to avoid depositing along the cell sides which might cause shorting. Titanium and Pt films of 50 nm thickness are deposited via DC sputtering in an argon atmosphere with a pressure of 50 mTorr and a flow rate of 3 sccm. The deposition is done at a rate of 5 nm min−1 and 10 nm min−1 for Ti and Pt, respectively, at a sputtering power of 200 W and substrate temperature of 20 °C.
OER catalyst
Porous Ti sheet substrates are sawcut and then rounded on a lathe with a carbide lathe bit to make them into circles with 1.3 cm diameter. Before depositing the OER catalyst, they are cleaned by sonicating in acetone/IPA/DI water for 20 minutes each. IrOx OER catalyst, for device testing across a full range of solution pH, is deposited on the porous Ti substrate by dip-coating in 0.01 M iridium acetylacetonate dissolved in chloroform, and then calcined in air at 320 °C for 1 hour in a tube furnace to decompose and remove the acetylacetonate ligands and oxidize the Ir to IrOx.36,37
Solid state photovoltaic characterization
For solid state I–V testing, a 450 W Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator with an AM 1.5 filter was used. The intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by a standard Si reference diode. The current–voltage measurements were made using a Keithley 2420 Source meter. The HIT cells were illuminated from the unmodified p-type top side with a 1 cm2 aperture.
For chronoamperometry testing, we used a 300 W SF-300 A small collimated beam Class AAA solar simulator from ScienceTech.
Electrochemistry and PEC testing
Electrochemical characterization was carried out using a Biologic VSP potentiostat running EC-Lab on a PC. For 3-electrode experiments, a Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl and a Pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes respectively. The stability of the ALD protected Si HIT cell is measured in a three-electrode set up. The HIT cell is epoxied, with DP 460 NS epoxy from 3M, to a strip of copper tape on a microscope glass slide, with a 1 cm2 aperture cut in it for illumination. Testing is done in a 10 mm path length SR-101A visible range borosilicate glass spectrophotometer cell from Spectrocell Inc., with the unaltered top of the HIT cell exposed to illumination and the back side with the TiO2/Ti/Pt stack in contact with the electrolyte. OER catalyst testing is also conducted in a three-electrode set up in a Teflon cone cell that is pressure sealed as previously reported in our group.38 For triple-cell testing, a 2-electrode set up was used with the OER catalyst and the ALD protected HIT cell as the working and counter electrodes respectively. All the HIT cells had 0.95 cm2 round metal apertures (for a total area of 2.85 cm2) to define the active area of the device. A peristaltic pump was used to circulate the electrolyte in the flow cell. Linear sweep voltammetry is performed at a 10 mV s−1 sweep rate.
Materials characterization
X-ray reflectivity was conducted using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffraction system. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were collected using a FEI Helios NanoLab 600i DualBeam Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscope with 2 kV acceleration voltage and 43 pA beam current. A PHI 700 Scanning Auger Nanoprobe was used for Auger mapping of elemental surface compositions of the IrOx OER catalysts on porous Ti sheet anodes. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed using a FEI Titan ETEM at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV.
Results
ALD protected silicon HIT cell performance and stability
The silicon HIT photovoltaic cells on 6′′ wafers used in these experiments exhibit high fill factors of 0.80 to 0.82, Voc of 740–750 mV and an efficiency of over 23%.39 For assembly of multi-junction PEC's, these wafers were laser cut into 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm cells. The damage from the laser cutting, edge recombination effects of the smaller cells, absence of the copper bus bars (because they block a significant portion of incident light for the smaller cells), and some shadowing from the metal masks used during these measurements cause PV performance degradation, resulting in a diminished fill factor of about 70%, a Voc of 670 mV and a photovoltaic efficiency of about 18.0%. Employing full wafers rather than small test coupons used in our electrochemical measurements would recover the higher photovoltaic performance specified for these solar cells significantly, and thus boost the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency over the values reported here-in.
HIT cells fabricated either with or without metallized copper grids on the back (n+) amorphous silicon (a-Si) junction were investigated. Cells without metallized grids were used as the photocathode for the electrochemical reaction. To protect the photocathodes from corrosion during water splitting, TiO2 was deposited on the ITO coating by ALD. Subsequently, the TiO2-coated back side of the HIT cell was metallized by sputter deposition of 50 nm of Ti followed by 50 nm of Pt (see schematic in Fig. 1(a)). Fig. S1† in the supplementary show TEM cross-section images of such a device, while S2† shows some EDS line scans of the different layers in the device.
 Fig. 1  (a) – Schematic of silicon HIT cell with ALD TiO2 protection layer and sputter deposited Ti/Pt metal stack; (b) band diagram of Si HIT cell/ITO/TiO2/Ti/Pt shows a band alignment that facilitates the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the Si HIT cell through the ALD TiO2 layer to the Pt/electrolyte interface. We assume reported42,61,62 work functions and electron affinities for the various materials depicted in the stack, without interface dipoles that might shift band offsets. 
Titanium produces a favorable band alignment to the conduction bands of TiO2 and a-Si and also acts as a adhesion layer to improve the adhesion of metal catalysts.40 Because of the good band alignment between the conduction bands of the TiO2 and the n-doped amorphous silicon, addition of the TiO2 protection layer enhances the stability of the HIT cell without causing any significant degradation in the HIT cell performance. Electrons are transported across the TiO2 without encountering a significant energy barrier,41,42 as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). This lack of TiO2-thickness dependence of the series resistance of the HIT cells allows use of relatively thick TiO2 protection layers without suffering a loss in performance.
However, as the TDMAT/H2O ALD process is typically carried out at a temperature of 150 °C or higher, some degradation in solid state performance of the silicon HIT cells occurs during the process, possibly due to dehydrogenation of the amorphous silicon and poorer passivation of the c-Si device.43,44 As shown in Fig. 2(a), there is a decrease in the Voc of the HIT cell of 30 mV. Moreover, an increase in series resistance in the HIT cells results in the fill factor dropping from greater than 70% to approximately 65% for cells with ALD TiO2 relative to those without TiO2. The photovoltaic efficiency decreases to ∼15% as a result, for both 7.0 nm and 35 nm thick TiO2 films. This degradation is clearly related to the process temperature as it is observed even when the Si HIT cell is held at the usual ALD temperature without performing any deposition (see Fig. S3 of the ESI†).
 Fig. 2  (a) – Solid state I–V data for an as-received HIT cell (black) and HIT cells with a 7 nm (green) and 35 nm (blue) ALD TiO2 layer deposited at 150 °C, and one with a 9 nm (red) TiO2 layer deposited at 45 °C with 50 nm Ti/50 nm Pt metal coating deposited by sputter deposition; (b) cyclic voltammetry of a HIT cell and a n+Si sample (tested in the dark) protected by TiO2 deposited at 45 °C in 1 M H2SO4. A potential shift of 670 mV is measured between the two scans, representing the photovoltage generated by the HIT cell. 
This performance degradation can be avoided when the ALD TiO2 deposition is carried out at a lower substrate temperature of 45 °C, which results in a slightly higher growth rate of about 0.9 Å per cycle. The thickness and growth per cycle were verified using XRR (S4 in ESI†). This increase in ALD-TiO2 growth per cycle at lower deposition temperatures has also been observed by other groups.45 As shown in Fig. 2(a), when the ALD is carried out at this lower temperature, the overall photovoltaic performance of the HIT cell remains undiminished even after the deposition of 9 nm of TiO2 layers. As with the samples on which TiO2 was deposited at 150 °C, the thickness of the TiO2 layer has little effect on the I–V characteristics of the HIT cells (see S5†).
To further verify that the ALD TiO2 layer does not cause any increase in the series resistance, we deposited TiO2 of different thicknesses in the range of 2 to 15 nm on n+Si, which has a similar conduction band edge energy as amorphous Si,46 followed by metallization with 50 nm of Ti and Pt on top as in the HIT cells, along with 100 nm of Al on the back side to form an ohmic contact. We observed that the sample resistance does not change detectably with TiO2 thickness during cyclic voltammetry in 10 mM ferri/ferrocyanide standard redox couple (Fig. S6 in the ESI†).
To study the effect of the TiO2 protection layer on the stability of the HIT cell during HER, TiO2-protected and unprotected samples were bonded by epoxy to copper tape on a glass slide and tested in a 3-electrode configuration in a cuvette cell in 1 M H2SO4(aq) solution under simulated 1 sun illumination. Cyclic voltammetry sweeps in Fig. 2(b) show an onset voltage for hydrogen evolution exceeding 600 mV under illumination, and a photovoltage of 670 mV when compared with a n+Si sample measured in the dark, which matches the measured Voc from solid state photovoltaic I–V measurements. The saturated current density exceeded 38 mA cm−2. Because light absorption and HER occur on different sides of the photocathode, optical losses due to light attenuation through the catalyst layers is not an issue. The TiO2-protected silicon HIT photocathode showed similarly high photovoltages in neutral pH phosphate buffer and in 1 M NaOH electrolytes, showing that it can be applied to a wide range of pH electrolytes (see Fig. S7†).
In order to study the stability of the ALD TiO2-protected HIT cells, chronoamperometry was conducted with the applied potential held at 0.2 V vs. RHE, such that the current densities were above 30 mA cm−2, a desirable condition at which to operate the triple cell for unassisted water splitting. Without a TiO2 protection layer, the HIT cell degraded within minutes in 1 M H2SO4, as shown by the decrease in current density during chronoamperometry in Fig. 3(a). The main degradation mechanism observed was rapid etching of the ITO coating on the HIT cell in the strong acid electrolyte, which caused delamination of the overlying layers from the silicon. This coincided with an abrupt drop in current density due to loss of electrical contact to (and physical loss of) the Pt HER catalyst. This is confirmed by XPS and Auger mapping of a sample tested area after failure, which detects only silicon on the surface (see S8). The addition of a TiO2 protection layer greatly enhanced cell stability. The presence of 9 nm of TiO2 deposited at 45 °C allowed the HIT cell to operate at a stable current density for 4 hours; however, a 56 nm thick TiO2 layer could operate stably for over 24 hours. A cyclic voltammetry scan in Fig. 3(b) after 24 hours of chronoamperometry testing shows no performance degradation.
 Fig. 3  (a) – Chronoamperometry at 0.2 V vs. RHE of HIT cell with no TiO2, 9 nm TiO2 and 56 nm TiO2 (black, red and blue curves respectively) deposited at 45 °C in 1 M H2SO4; (b) cyclic voltammetry showing no degradation in device performance after 24 hours of continuous operation; (c) chronoamperometry at 0.2 V vs. RHE of a HIT cell with 7 nm TiO2 deposited at 150 °C in 1 M H2SO4. 
Meanwhile, TiO2 films deposited at 150 °C were found to impart much better stability than films of similar thicknesses deposited at 45 °C. A 7 nm thick film deposited at 150 °C exhibited the same >24 hours of stability (as shown in Fig. 3(c)) as the 56 nm thick film deposited at lower temperature. This is possibly due to the higher density of the film deposited at higher temperature (see S4 of the ESI†).
IrOx on porous Ti OER catalyst
In order to achieve the highest possible STH efficiency in the water splitting cell, a low OER catalyst overpotential < 300 mV is essential. We used 3D porous Ti substrates with 1 mm thickness and 50 μm pore sizes (Fig. 4(a)) to increase the contact area between the electrolyte and the catalyst, thus increasing the geometrical density of active sites for OER. We employed Auger mapping (Fig. 4(b)) to show uniform coverage of Ir over the Ti substrate. The dip-coated IrOx on a porous Ti substrate achieved an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4. This OER catalyst is of interest because it can be used to test PEC performance across a full range of solution pH due to its excellent stability. IrOx on porous Ti tested in 1 M NaOH exhibited a higher overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm−2, consistent with the reported reduction of catalytic activity of IrOx in base.47 Chronoamperometry was performed in acid to study the stability of the OER catalyst under operation (Fig. 4(d)), and a gradual current decay was observed, which is in agreement with other reports.36,48 The decay has been attributed to diminished activity as the surface of the Ir is increasingly oxidized at anodic potentials sufficient to split water.48 Others have also found evidence of the formation of a soluble Ir species of a higher oxidation state at anodic potentials and its subsequent removal due to dissolution.48,49 However, the original activity could be recovered by a potential sweep to less positive potentials.48 Our results agree with this proposal, as cyclic voltammetry scans after chronoamperometry showed no degradation in performance.

Triple cell STH efficiency and stability
To perform unassisted water splitting, three silicon HIT cells were mounted side by side on a titanium plate, each with a 0.95 cm2 aperture mask that controls the illumination area. The photocathode was connected with the electrolyte in a Teflon flow cell, through which the electrolyte flowed through two inlets and two outlets, and was sealed by mechanical pressure. Two additional HIT cells with metal grids on both sides were used to provide the additional external photovoltage (solid state data in S9) to drive the water splitting reaction. The external HIT cells were electrically connected to a titanium anode housing which holds the porous OER electrocatalyst on the opposite side of the flow cell. A schematic of the complete flow cell is shown in Fig. 5(a) with additional photographs in S10 of the ESI.†
 Fig. 5  (a) – Schematic of the flow cell design used to perform unassisted water splitting; (b) J–V curve for triple cell device in a two-electrode configuration. The current density is obtained by dividing the measured current over the total illuminated area of the three silicon HIT cells (2.85 cm2). The photocathode HIT cell is protected by TiO2 deposited at 45 °C. The current density at 0 V indicates a STH efficiency of 12.2% in 1 M H2SO4. With resistance correction, the STH efficiency is 14.5%; (c) cyclic voltammetry scans before and after each chronoamperometry testing of a single HIT cell in a two-electrode configuration; (d) cyclic voltammetry scans for a HIT cell with 35 nm of TiO2 deposited at 225 °C before and after 120 h of chronoamperometry testing of a single HIT cell in a two-electrode configuration. 
Current–voltage measurements were performed on these cells by providing a potential between the silicon HIT cells and the electroanode on both sides of the flow cell. In the absence of competing redox couples, the faradaic efficiency of the H2 and O2 evolution processes approach 100%.50,51 The STH efficiency of a water splitting cell is calculated according to eqn (1): (1)where P is the output power of the solar simulator (100 mW cm−2 to simulate 1 sun intensity), and Iph is the photocurrent at 0 V bias. Three series-connected HIT cells, one acting as the photocathode, and an IrOx OER catalyst-coated porous Ti exhibited an STH efficiency of 12.2% in concentrated acid (Fig. 5(b)). If we account for losses due to solution resistance (as explained in S11 of the ESI†), the STH efficiency increases to 14.5%.
Chronoamperometry was conducted at a constant applied potential of 1.23 V with just a single TiO2-protected HIT cell in contact with the flow cell in 1 M H2SO4. We performed two successive chronoamperometry measurements for 3 and 9 hours respectively for a HIT cell with TiO2 deposited at 45 °C, with cyclic voltammetry scans performed in between as shown in Fig. 5(c), and observed no deterioration in the performance as seen from the cyclic voltammetry scans afterwards, proving that the HIT cell was still well protected by the ALD TiO2 layer after a total of 12 hours of operation in the flow cell. With a 35 nm TiO2 film deposited at 150 °C, no deterioration in the cyclic voltammetry was observed even after 120 hours of chronoamperometry testing, confirming the superior protection afforded at HER potentials by the TiO2 deposited at the higher temperature. XPS and Auger mapping of this sample after 120 hours of testing showed no chemical change to the surface (see S12). Although the sample that showed 120 hours of stability had poorer CV performance than the 45 °C – deposited TiO2 HIT cell, the best performing HIT cell with TiO2 deposited under the same conditions had performance similar to the 45 °C – deposited TiO2 HIT cell (see S13). Therefore, >10% STH efficiency can also be achieved when the ALD-TiO2 protection layer is deposited at the higher temperature.
Discussion
The US Department of Energy has published a 2020 cost target of $2.30 per kg for the production of hydrogen from water electrolysis, including photoelectrochemical methods, with the ultimate goal being $2.00 per kg.52 Recent analysis suggests that a STH efficiency of 10% is the breakeven point for energy return on investment.53 These experiments demonstrate that the efficiency target is possible using silicon solar cells in a compact, integrated configuration compared to a side-by-side configuration of photoanode and photocathode, with stability exceeding 120 hours. Table 1 summarizes the reported efficiencies and stability information for silicon-based water splitting devices using both the integrated (PEC-anode or PEC cathode) and the PV + electrolyzer configurations. All the devices were measured in a two-electrode setup under 1 sun illumination. Comparing the results obtained in this study, none of the previously reported devices managed to achieve a similar combination of high efficiency and stability within a compact device architecture. Only the PV + electrolyzer configuration has been able to achieve a 10% STH efficiency target, of which only one has managed a higher efficiency than is reported herein, albeit by using an electrolyzer with 10× larger surface area than the photoabsorber. All other integrated devices had STH efficiencies less than 10%.

With optimization of the OER catalyst to further lower the overpotential, and use of large area silicon HIT cells to recover their full open circuit voltage and fill factors, a pathway exists to achieve an STH efficiency in excess of 15%. Currently the flow cell only has roughly the geometric area of a single Si HIT cell, we can further enhance the water splitting efficiency by extending the flow cell below the external Si HIT cells and increasing the surface area of the catalysts. This should further lower the overpotentials and also provide cooling for the external cells that will mitigate the heat-induced performance degradation (approximately −0.25% C−1 (ref. 54 and 55)). We also believe that far greater stability is possible. The main mode of failure in our experiments in 1 M H2SO4 is under-cutting of the catalyst, contact and protection layers by selective etching of the underlying ITO layer. Pinholes in the catalyst, metallic contact and protective films, possibly due to the roughness of the ITO layer on the HIT cell back side and to dust particles and contamination on the ITO surface after completion of solar cell fabrication and sample handling lead to eventual device failure. Coating of the wafer back side with the ALD-TiO2 protection layer and the sputtered metal contact and HER catalyst layers used in this work did not take place in a cleanroom. Therefore, dust particles are inevitable, and these can easily settle in the grooves of the highly-textured HIT cell surface (see S14 of the ESI†), causing incomplete film coverage. The superior stability displayed by the TiO2 deposited at 150 °C may be due to the higher density and better conformality of deposition over the rough ITO back-side contact of the HIT cells at this temperature, which lies within the window of true, surface-saturating ALD for TDMAT/H2O chemistry.56 The chemical stability of the TiO2 film is also likely to be greater for higher deposition temperatures.57 Eliminating the ITO layer in the as-received HIT cells, which is unnecessary in our design as we illuminate the cells from the front side, would be a simple route to improved endurance. An ALD-TiO2/Ti/Pt stack with 10 nm of TiO2 deposited at 45 °C on a polished n+Si substrate (no ITO layer) showed no degradation in performance after 120 hours of continuous operation in acid (Fig. S15†).
These experiments use Pt and IrOx catalysts for ease of demonstration as they are widely accepted as benchmark electrocatalysts for HER and OER, respectively. However, their scarcity prompts interest in alternative catalyst materials. It should be noted that our multi-junction HIT photoelectrochemical cell design can flexibly accommodate many different choices for HER and OER catalysts. For example, the Pt HER catalyst could be replaced by more inexpensive options that use more Earth-abundant materials, such as MoS2.58 Possible replacements for IrOx as the OER catalyst in acid are limited due to stability concerns; however, these cells also operate efficiently in basic as well as neutral pH electrolyte (see Fig. S16†), where alternative OER catalysts based on non-precious metals such as Ni, Fe, and Co have been shown to out-perform IrOx while exhibiting excellent stability.35,59,60 Operating the flow cell in neutral pH electrolytes is of particular interest due to safety concerns with extreme pH electrolytes. Despite higher HER and OER overpotentials and greater resistive losses in neutral phosphate buffer solution, by adding an extra Si HIT cell, it is possible to achieve over 10% STH efficiency (see S17). These results indicate the possibility of substituting more abundant alternatives for platinum and iridium metal catalysts without compromising the STH efficiency.
Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrate unassisted photoelectrochemical water splitting driven by the photovoltage of series-connected silicon HIT cells, in which ALD-grown TiO2 protection layers inhibit corrosion during the hydrogen evolution reaction and electronically couple the silicon photocathode to an efficient HER catalyst. Using IrOx on porous Ti as the OER catalyst, greater than 10% STH efficiency was achieved in both 1 M H2SO4 and 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The device design, in which the illumination occurs on the side of the solar cell opposite the electrochemical reaction, avoids both parasitic losses due to light absorption and reflection and any instability of silicon at anodic potentials. We have shown that it is possible to achieve high conversion efficiencies with good device stability by using a compact, all-silicon light absorber design in which integration with an electrochemical flow cell does not inherently reduce photovoltaic efficiency.
