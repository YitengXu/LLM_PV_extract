    , Accepted 30th November 2022First published on 1st December 2022AbstractIn the last two years, studies on SnO2 preparation and optimization have proved to be effective paths toward the Schottky limit of perovskite solar cells. Herein, we used an electrochemical deposition method to obtain polycrystalline SnO2 film at room temperature for the first time. The method has the advantage of simplicity and efficiency using electrochemistry to realize deposition, adsorption, and protection of the SnO2 film, avoiding a more complex regulation process than the chemical bath deposition method. Benefiting from the optimization process, the method could achieve adjustable work function of the SnO2 film by controlling the pH of the electrolyte, which is conducive for reducing mismatched energy levels between the SnO2 film and the perovskite layer. Besides, the obtained SnO2 film is densely and uniformly distributed along the substrate profile, leading to better light transmission. More importantly, this method can be applied to prepare SnO2 film on large area and flexible substrates. Finally, the device based on SnO2 film prepared with pH = 1 electrolyte achieves the highest performance of 22.85%, which is higher than that of the device based on the commercial colloidal dispersion SnO2 film (21.72%). These multi-advantages of the method make it competitive for future commercialization.
1. Introduction
In recent years, organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made great progress and achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7%, which is close to the efficiency of commercial silicon solar cells.1 This shows their great application potential in commercialization. Among the high-efficiency n–i–p devices, construction based on the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and α-FAPbI3 perovskite layer is widely used.2–4 In particular, research on the SnO2 ETL preparation process has become a key route to breaking the record efficiency in newly reported high-efficiency PSCs.4,5 Yoo et al. used chemical bath deposition (CBD) to deposit SnO2 films and achieved a then-record efficiency of 25.2%.4 Later, this record was broken at 25.5% by Min et al. by improving the SnO2 film preparation.3 It can be seen that the optimization of the SnO2 ETL preparation process is an important research direction for further improving the efficiency of PSCs.6,7 Thus, it is necessary to research the preparation process of SnO2 ETL.
SnO2 has a wide band gap (∼3.6 eV) with excellent light transmission. In addition, it also shows good charge mobility (∼250 cm2 V−1 s−1), suitable energy band structure, low-temperature processability, and good chemical stability.5,8,9 Thus, the SnO2 film does well in hole-blocking and electron-extraction as an excellent ETL material in devices. As a result, it can be used to produce long-lifetime and high-efficiency PSCs. Since 2015, various SnO2 deposition methods are used in PSCs, such as the sol–gel method based on SnCl2·2H2O solution,10 atomic layer deposition,11 commercial colloidal dispersion (CD),12 CBD,4,13 electrodeposition (ED),14 and SnO2 nanosheets deposition.15 Among them, the CD method is the most widely used in n–i–p devices because of its simple process. Also, the CBD method is the best for further exploration. This is because a dense and conformal SnO2 film with good carrier management can be obtained by the CBD method.4,13 These lead to excellent carrier transport and high light transmission for the prepared SnO2 film. Based on these advantages, the CBD method has achieved high-efficiency devices many times.3,4
However, the CD-based SnO2 films is coated on the uneven substrate by spin-coating, which causes non-uniform thickness. The non-uniform thickness causes slight poor light transmission and non-radiative recombination.4,7 The CBD method requires the continuous regulation of electrolyte pH by heating to induce the deposition of polycrystalline SnO2. Besides, it also needs to control the oxygen content in the vessel to obtain SnO2−x with good carrier management.4,13 This complex process with slightly poor repeatability limits the further applications of the CBD method. The process of the CBD method may be optimized by adding an electrochemical effect because it can promote the deposition of SnO2. The introduction of electrochemistry can avoid the complex process mentioned above, which is beneficial for simplifying the CBD method. Also, the electrochemical effect is also used in the ED method to deposit SnO2 films. However, in the ED method, the addition of HNO3 causes a very fast deposition of SnO2. Also, the reduction of HNO3 inhibits the formation of SnO2−x, which leads to high-crystalline poor-conductivity SnO2. Due to these, a poor PCE of 13.88% is obtained by the ED method.14 Thus, it is necessary to abandon the HNO3 electrolyte in the preparation process of the SnO2 film to realize excellent electrochemical effect, which can be used to optimize the CBD method.
In this work, we use the optimized electrochemical deposition (ECD) method to obtain polycrystalline SnO2 film at room temperature without HNO3 electrolyte for the first time. The electrochemical effect can be realized by applying a bias voltage to the substrate in a suitable electrolyte. The substrate with a bias voltage can absorb Sn4+ and transform it to SnO2. Thus, the deposition of SnO2 can be realized without continuous pH regulation. Notably, using this method, the SnO2 film can be obtained using electrolytes with different pH to control the SnO content of the film.16 Also, the oxygen vacancies/SnO in SnO2 are positively related to electron concentration, which will affect the work function (WF) of the film, so that the WF is adjustable in a range for the ECD-based SnO2 film by adjusting the electrolyte pH. The adjustable WF is beneficial for constructing a suitable energy level alignment in the device to reduce the non-radiative recombination and energy loss. However, it is difficult for the CBD method to realize adjustable WF because of the obligatory continuous pH regulation. Besides, in the ECD method, the bias voltage can also protect and lead to adsorption on the SnO2 film, which makes the obtained SnO2 film denser and uniform. Also, the obtained SnO2 film is uniformly distributed along the substrate profile, which leads to better light transmission and higher photocurrent. Based on these, the SnO2 film prepared with an electrolyte pH = 1 achieved a PCE of 22.85% in the PSCs, which is slightly higher than the 21.72% of CD. The preparation of SnO2 with such efficiency at room temperature benefits from the electrochemical regulation effect, which is not available in other works (Table S1†). More importantly, this method is also suitable for large-area devices and flexible devices. The optimized ECD method exhibits multi-advantages including simplicity, tuneability, and high efficiency, which contribute to further commercialization.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Characterization of SnO2

Fig. 1a shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of SnO2 prepared by the ECD method. For a small particle, the lattice fringes are clearly identified; thus, the crystallization of SnO2 is relatively good. The electron diffraction pattern of the obtained SnO2 film is shown in Fig. 1a, which shows that the obtained SnO2 has a polycrystalline morphology on a whole.4 Overall, the obtained SnO2 is a polycrystalline structure combined with many small crystallized particles. In the TEM pattern, the interplanar spacing of about 0.334 nm corresponds to the (110) planes of rutile SnO2, and the interplanar spacing of about 0.264 nm corresponds to the (101) planes of rutile SnO2. These can correspond to the electron diffraction patterns in the inset figure. Besides, the diffraction pattern also exhibits a clear (211) plane in the rutile SnO2 diffraction pattern, located on the outside. Based on these, it is known that the obtained SnO2 is a rutile-type (P42/mnm) phase with a tetragonal crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 1b.17 The rutile-type SnO2 has excellent chemical and thermal stability under normal conditions, which is suitable as an ETL.18 In addition, elemental mapping with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) study of Sn elements was carried out, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. The distribution of Sn elements is uniform and is in perfect agreement with the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) TEM image. This confirms that the thickness of the film we obtained is relatively uniform. Combined with the TEM image, we know that the film we obtained is a uniform rutile-type polycrystalline SnO2.

The atomic force micrographs (AFM) of the SnO2 (ECD) film are displayed in Fig. 1e. The SnO2 film presents a planar morphology with a root mean square roughness (RMS) of 3.17 nm. The flat SnO2 film often corresponds to fewer holes, which causes less leakage current at the interface.19 The optical transmittance of SnO2 (ECD) and SnO2 (CD) are characterized, as shown in Fig. 1f. Both SnO2 films show excellent optical transmittance and similar changing trends in 350–850 nm. In particular, the SnO2 (ECD) films have better optical transmittance in the range from 360 nm to 560 nm, as shown in the enlarged inset figure. This may be due to the more uniform distribution of the SnO2 (ECD) films along the ITO profile.7 Also, this better optical transmittance may allow higher short-circuit currents (Jsc) in the device.
2.2. Preparation principle and advantage
The process of preparing SnO2 by the ECD method is shown in Fig. 2a. SnCl2, H2O, HCl, and KCl are used as the electrolyte, and a bias voltage is applied on the ITO substrate to deposit the SnO2 film. The equivalent schematic diagrams are shown in Fig. S1a–c (ESI),† and the latter may avoid some post-pollution. Then, the substrates with SnO2 film were soaked in deionized water to remove the residues. After cleaning, they were dried in a vacuum to remove water, then the SnO2 films were treated with plasma for 15 min.

SEM images of (b) ITO, (c) deposition SnO2 without ECD, and (d) deposition SnO2 with ECD. (e) Schematic diagram of the relationship between CBD, ECD, and ED. 
In the process of depositing the SnO2 film, SnCl2 will undergo a hydrolysis reaction in the electrolyte as follows.4 Sn2+ + H2O ⇔ Sn(OH)+ + H+.(1)
Also, the product Sn(OH)+ can be easily oxidized to the tetravalent Sn4+ with an irreversible reaction equation.4,20 (2)
Tetravalent Sn4+ is also easy to hydrolyze or complex with Cl ions when Cl ions are existing in the acid solution. Then, they will likewise undergo hydrolysis reactions and produce α-stannic acid H2[Sn(OH)6] and H2[Sn(Cl)6] in HCl solution as follows.21 Sn4+ + 6H2O ⇔ H2[Sn(OH)6] + 4H+,(3) Sn4+ + 4Cl− + 2HCl ⇔ H2[Sn(Cl)6].(4)
The rate of the hydrolysis process here is slow, and the Sn4+ in solution is gradually reduced and converted to the complexes H2[Sn(OH)6] and H2[Sn(Cl)6] over several hours.21 These are the reactions that occur in the solution itself, and it is similar to the CBD method. Also, these reactions are easily affected by the change in the solution pH.
SnO2 can be deposited with the change in the solution pH, and the reaction equation is as follows.20,22 H2[Sn(OH)6] ⇔ SnO2 + 4H2O,(5) [Sn(Cl)6]2− + 2H2O ⇔ SnO2 + 4H+ + 6Cl−.(6)
If the bias voltage is applied to the substrate, two new reactions may be formed by the electrochemical effect, the reaction equation is as follows.23,24 Sn4+ + 2H2O ⇔ SnO2 + 4H+,(7) (8)
For the ECD method, besides reactions (5) and (6), SnO2 can also be directly deposited by reactions (7) because of the reduction effect of the bias voltage. The bias voltage can protect the generated SnO2 from being redissolved by the acid. The effect of the bias voltage will shift the reaction equilibrium to the right, which directly transforms Sn4+ to SnO2. Thus, the reaction does not require a continuous change in the pH. More importantly, SnO2−x can also be directly deposited by reactions (8) because of the electrochemical reduction effect. Thus, the highly conductive SnO2−x (SnO2 containing oxygen vacancies) can be directly obtained without controlling the oxygen content. Thus, the method is obviously simpler than the CBD method, and it has the advantage of further application and optimization. Moreover, the negative bias voltage can also adsorb Sn4+. This effect may allow the generated SnO2 to be more densely distributed on the substrate than the one without the bias voltage. In addition, the anode or iron perhaps also has the effect to accelerate the pH change. These can also promote the deposition of SnO2. In all, the electrochemical effect promotes the deposition of SnO2.
For experimental validation, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of ITO and deposited SnO2 films are shown in Fig. 2b–d. Compared to bare ITO, a few SnO2 molecules are only deposited on the substrate by the method without the electrochemical effect. However, the ECD method deposits significantly more SnO2 on the substrate. This also shows the auxiliary electrochemical effect on SnO2 deposition.
Compared with the CBD and ED methods, the ECD method shows multi-advantages of the simple process, fitting deposition rate, dense uniform film with high conductivity, and wider optimization and application. This is because it is an optimized intermediate method between the CBD and ED method, as shown in Fig. 2e. From CBD to ECD, the electrochemical effect is introduced using a similar electrolyte solution (①). This leads to the simple ECD method and avoids the complicated regulation problems of the CBD method.4 Based on the ECD method, the effect of promoting SnO2 deposition is further enhanced by adding HNO3 to the electrolyte (②). This is the ED method. But HNO3 causes some other problems including rough morphology and low conductivity.14,21 These show that the ECD method has a fitting deposition rate. On analyzing from another perspective, to suppress the problem of very fast deposition and rough morphology in the ED method, the promotion effect is weakened by replacing HNO3 (③). These lead to uniform morphology and high conductivity. However, if the electrochemical effect is further reduced for a more homogeneous morphology, or even if the effect is abandoned (④), the method is gradually changed to the CBD method. These cause a complicated control process again. It can be seen that the CBD method and the ED method are complementary in the deposit rate and film quality. The ECD method combines their complementary advantages, which has the opportunity to achieve wider application.
2.3. Different work functions at different pH
The high-resolution XPS of the Sn 3d5/2 peak of different SnO2 films are analyzed to study the chemical states of Sn, as shown in Fig. 3a–d. The Sn 3d5/2 peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 486.6 and 487.3 eV, which can be corresponded to Sn2+ and Sn4+, respectively.20 According to the fitting results, the content of Sn4+ gradually increases for SnO2 (pH = 3), SnO2 (pH = 2), SnO2 (pH = 1), and SnO2 (CD). The content of Sn4+ is 62.8%, 70.6%, 78.9%, and 81.9%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3e. This proves that the content of SnO in SnO2−x gradually decreases with decreasing pH. This is because the reactive metallic Sn and the unstable SnO tend to react in an acidic solution, while SnO2 is relatively stable.16 Thus, an SnO2 film with adjustable SnO can be obtained by this method. Such an SnO2 is conducive for obtaining high-efficiency devices.25 This is because too little or too much SnO2 is harmful to the device performance. The pure bulk SnO2 without SnO has poor conductivity. It is necessary to control the oxygen vacancies in SnO2 to increase its concentration of electron carriers.5 However, SnO itself is a p-type semiconductor with good hole mobility.26 The aggregation of excessive SnO leads to serious interfacial non-radiative recombination. Thus, an SnO2 film with adjustable SnO is needed.
 Fig. 3  (a–d) High-resolution XPS of the Sn 3d5/2 peak of different SnO2 films. (e) Sn4+ content parameter of the fitting result. (f) The PL spectra of different SnO2 films. 
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of SnO2 films based on different pH electrolytes are tested, as shown in Fig. 3f. The intensity of the peak located at 422 nm gradually decreases with the decrease in pH. This peak is considered to be due to oxygen vacancies.27 These also confirms that SnO in SnO2−x gradually decreases with decreasing pH. SnO2−x with different SnO contents may have different properties and can be applied to different fields, which reflects the wide application of this method.
Further, Fig. 4a shows the ultraviolet photo-electron spectra (UPS) of SnO2 films obtained by ECD with different pH and CD methods. Based on the secondary cutoff edge (Ecutoff) on the left, WF can be calculated using the formula EF = 21.22 − Ecutoff. The WF are 4.23, 4.36, 4.50, and 4.63 V for SnO2 prepared at pH = 3, pH = 2, pH = 1, and CD, respectively.28 In the ECD-prepared SnO2, the obtained SnO2 has a bigger WF when using an electrolyte with a lower pH. This is because SnO is not easily generated in an acidic solution,16 which results in a reduced content of SnO/oxygen vacancies in the SnO2 film. The concentration of oxygen vacancies is related to the concentration of electron carriers in the SnO2 film.5 Higher carrier concentrations are obtained with high pH electrolytes. Usually, the increase in electron carrier concentration leads to a smaller WF. Thus, the higher pH electrolyte causes a smaller WF. Further, we tested Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) for different SnO2, as shown in Table S2 (ESI)† and Fig. 4b, c, e and f. It can be seen that all the SnO2 films exhibit a uniform surface potential, which proves that the SnO2 films with excellent electrical properties are obtained. Their average surface potentials are 4.32, 4.46, 4.55, and 4.68 V for SnO2 (pH = 3), SnO2 (pH = 2), SnO2 (pH = 1), and SnO2 (CD), which are consistent with the UPS test results.29 Therefore, it proves once again that we obtained the SnO2 film with adjustable WF using electrolytes at different pH.

(g–j) The energy level schematic of devices based on different SnO2 after energy level drifting (the unit is V). 
According to Fig. 4a, the valence band (Ev) values of SnO2 (pH = 3), SnO2 (pH = 2), SnO2 (pH = 1), and SnO2 (CD) are 7.76, 7.86, 7.96, and 8.03 V, respectively. Combined with the Kubelka–Munk plot, their conduction band (Ec) values can be calculated to be 4.13, 4.20, 4.29, and 4.35, respectively. The specific energy level schematic is shown in Fig. 4d, and the energy band parameters are shown in Table S3 (ESI).† When the perovskite is prepared on the surface of different SnO2, the charge flows between SnO2 and the perovskite because of the difference in the WF.28 The flowed charge leads to a shift in the vacuum energy level (Evac) and the bending of the energy band at the interface.30,31 This will result in different effects on the interface.
After charge flow, the schematic diagrams of different SnO2 are shown in Fig. 4g–j. For SnO2 (pH = 3) in Fig. 4g, the WF discrepancy between it and perovskite is large. This leads to a significant Evac drift of 0.35 V, and it also makes the Ec of the perovskite significantly bent. Such a shifted interfacial Ec value of the perovskite is lower than that of SnO2 (pH = 3). This may cause carrier accumulation and non-radiative recombination at the interface, which will lead to S-shaped J–V curves and poor FF in the device. With decreasing electrolyte pH, the WF of the obtained SnO2 gradually increases. Thus, energy band bending of the perovskite and the misalignment of energy level at the interface are weakened, as shown in Fig. 4h. Until the SnO2 (pH = 1), the Ec of perovskite is 0.07 V higher than that of SnO2 at the interface, as shown in Fig. 4i. This is an excellent energy level alignment, which can avoid carrier accumulation and non-radiative recombination. This is a perfect condition for excellent device performance. With the continuous decline of WF, the energy level arrangement at the interface becomes worse in contrast, as shown in Fig. 4j. In detail, the discrepancy between the Ec of the perovskite and the WF of SnO2 is 0.28 and 0.41 V for SnO2 (pH = 1) and SnO2 (CD), respectively. The too-large discrepancy for SnO2 (CD) may lead to more energy loss. The discrepancy between the Ev of the perovskite and the WF of SnO2 are 1.20 and 1.07 V for SnO2 (pH = 1) and SnO2 (CD), respectively. A smaller discrepancy for SnO2 (CD) means a worse hole-blocking ability.30 In all, SnO2 (pH = 1) displays the best energy level arrangement, which is conducive for high device performance.
The morphologies of different SnO2 are shown in Fig. 5a–d. Compared to the ITO in Fig. 2b, it can be seen that the SnO2 obtained by ECD is densely distributed on the substrate and shows a clear ITO outline. In contrast, the SnO2 (CD) film is flatter and the ITO outline is masked. Moreover, the AFM images and corresponding cross-section profile curves of ITO, SnO2 (ECD), and SnO2 (CD) are tested, as shown in Fig. 5e–g. The ITO and SnO2 (ECD) show similar outlines and similar RMS of 2.67 and 3.17, respectively. On the other hand, SnO2 (CD) shows excessive smoothness with an RMS of 1.70. This is consistent with the SEM images. More intuitively, the cross-sectional profile curves of AFM are shown in the inset figures, which also show a different distribution of the SnO2 film.
 Fig. 5  (a–d) The SEM images of different SnO2. (e–g) The AFM images and corresponding cross-section profile curves of ITO, SnO2 (ECD), and SnO2 (CD) with a size of 5 μm × 5 μm. The schematic diagram of the distribution of (h) SnO2 (ECD) and (i) SnO2 (CD) on the substrate. 
The schematic diagrams of the two distributions are shown in Fig. 5h and i. Compared with the uniformly distributed SnO2 (ECD) film, the SnO2 (CD) film shows an uneven thickness. In the areas where the substrate is convex, the SnO2 film is too thin, which may lead to leakage current. The SnO2 film is too thick in the concave places of the substrate, which may cause poor light transmittance. For the SnO2 (ECD) film, the uniform films can obtain higher optical transmittance and less leakage current. These are suitable for high-efficiency devices.4,7 Notably, this is consistent with the result in light transmission curves. The uniform film may be the reason for the higher light transmission of the SnO2 (ECD) film (Fig. 1f).
In the films obtained by the ECD method, the particles of SnO2 (pH = 3) and SnO2 (pH = 2) seem to be smaller than those of SnO2 (pH = 1). Usually, the smaller particles tend to have more defects and oxygen vacancies because of higher specific surface area. The phenomenon is consistent with the previous conclusion that the high pH electrolyte deposits the SnO2 film with more SnO. From the perspective of SnO2 crystallization, the high pH electrolyte produces a large amount of SnO, which will prevent the further growth of the SnO2 particles. Thus, the smaller particles are deposited by the pH = 3 electrolyte. This phenomenon also shows the advantage of ECD such that it can be further optimized and regulated to obtain SnO2 with different properties.
In addition, the SEM images of the perovskite based on different SnO2 are shown in Fig. S2a–d (ESI).† All the perovskite films display good crystallization. In more detail, the perovskite films based on the SnO2 (CD) films exhibit smaller grains and some small grains on the surface, which means more grain boundaries and surface defects. These defects will cause non-radiative recombination and affect the device stability. The ECD method exhibits advantages in promoting perovskite crystallization, which shows larger and more uniform grain sizes compared to the CD method. Better crystallization usually means less defect and better device performance.32,33 Better crystallization may be due to the residual Cl on the surface of the SnO2 (ECD) film. It is generally believed that the small size of Cl retards the crystallization rate of perovskite to obtain larger grains.4
The XRD patterns of the perovskite based on different SnO2 are shown in Fig. S3a (ESI).† The peaks at 13.9° and 28.2° correspond to the characteristic peak of the α-FAPbI3 perovskite. The perovskite films based on SnO2 (ECD) show higher peak height than the film based on SnO2 (CD) films, which also proves that the SnO2 (ECD) films can promote the crystallization of the perovskite. In detail, the perovskite films based on SnO2 (pH = 3) show the highest peak intensity and the perovskite/SnO2 (pH = 1) show the lowest peak intensity in the perovskite/SnO2 (ECD) film. This may be because SnO2 (pH = 3) has more uncoordinated Sn and more Cl residual on it, which promotes perovskite crystallization. Besides, the absorption spectra of perovskites based on different SnO2 are shown in Fig. S3b (ESI).† Compared with the SnO2 (CD)/perovskite film, the SnO2 (ECD)/perovskite film exhibits higher absorption. This may be due to better perovskite crystallization for the SnO2 (ECD) substrate. This is consistent with the results of SEM and XRD, which all show that the SnO2 (ECD) substrate is conducive for better perovskite crystallization. These are conducive for obtaining high-efficiency devices.
On the other hand, the conductivity of SnO2 (pH = 3) is slightly better than the other films, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI).† This is because the electron carrier concentration caused by SnO gradually increases with the gradually increasing solution pH value. The PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) curves are based on the device structure of ITO/SnO2/PVK, and the test results are shown in Fig. S5a and b and Table S4 (ESI).† The device based on SnO2 (pH = 3) exhibits the lowest PL intensity. This may be due to its large amount of SnO, which leads to serious non-radiative recombination at the interface.6,34 The fitting results of the TRPL show similar regulations. The fast decay lifetimes of SnO2 (pH = 3), SnO2 (pH = 2), SnO2 (pH = 1), and SnO2 (CD) are 25.87, 27.64, 26.57, and 37.17 ns, respectively. Also, the total lifetimes are 98.06, 105.79, 115.29, and 135.73 ns for them, respectively.2 The fast decay lifetime corresponds to interface recombination and charge transfer. Better charge transfer is beneficial for device performance, while more recombination leads to poor device performance. The devices based on the ECD method show significantly shorter carrier lifetimes than the one of the CD method. Combined with the conductance data, it is believed that this is mainly due to better charge transfer, which may be related to higher short-circuit current. The fast decay lifetime is close for the SnO2 obtained by the ECD method, but SnO2 (pH = 1) shows the highest carrier lifetime and the lowest short lifetime component A1. Combined with the discussion of interface energy level arrangement, it is believed that the higher A1 of SnO2 (pH = 3) and SnO2 (pH = 2) may be related to device recombination. Excessive recombination will lead to a worse FF, which is consistent with the device parameters.35
Overall, SnO2 (pH = 1) films show the best energy level arrangement, excellent effect of promoting perovskite crystallization, suitable conductivity, excellent light transmission, and less non-radiative recombination. These make it an excellent ETL material for PSCs.
2.4. Photoelectric properties

Fig. 6a shows the J–V reverse scanning curves of devices based on different SnO2 under standard simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The device structure is glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI).† The detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. The best-performing PCE of the device based on SnO2 (pH = 3) is 18.33% with Voc of 1082 mV, Jsc of 24.77 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.39%. Combining Fig. 6a and b, it can be seen that the J–V curves of SnO2 (pH = 3) devices exhibit an obvious S-shape, which may be due to carrier accumulation caused by energy band mismatch at the interface. In addition, too much SnO in SnO2 (pH = 3) may act as a recombination site at the interface, resulting in poor FF.36,37 This is consistent with the previous analysis. With the decrease in the pH, the device performance gradually improves. The highest PCE of the device based on SnO2 (pH = 2) is 19.90% with Voc of 1127 mV, Jsc of 24.93 mA cm−2, and FF of 70.76%. Also, the device based on SnO2 (pH = 1) achieves the best performance with Voc of 1144 mV, Jsc of 24.83 mA cm−2, FF of 80.44%, and PCE of 22.85%. As the electrolyte pH gradually decreases, the S-shape of the J–V curve gradually weakens and the FF gradually increases. These are due to the decrease in the content of SnO, which is also consistent with our previous analysis.

The device based on SnO2 (CD) achieves a PCE of 21.72%, Voc of 1124 mV, Jsc of 23.92 mA cm−2, and FF of 80.09%. Obviously, the SnO2 (ECD) films exhibit higher Jsc, which may be due to uniform thickness and more Cl elements on its surface. As analyzed in Section 3, the SnO2 (ECD) film with thinner and homogeneous thickness exhibits better optical transmittance, which results in a higher Jsc. Also, the Cl also optimizes the crystallization of the perovskite, which also means higher device efficiency. Besides, a coherent layer may be formed at the interface between the ETL and the perovskite due to Cl elements, which reduces the non-radiative recombination at the interface.3 The SnO2 (pH = 1) films also display a larger Voc. This may be caused by better energy level alignment and less energy loss.
Further, these SnO2 films are used for devices with different perovskite layers. The test results for devices based on MAPbI3 perovskite are shown in Fig. S7a and d and Table S5 (ESI).† The device efficiency of the devices based on SnO2 (ECD) can reach that of the film from the CD method when the pH of the electrolyte drops to about 2. For the two-step methods (FAPbI3)0.93(MAPbI3)0.07 perovskite device, the pH needs to be reduced to about 1.5, which can achieve the close device efficiency for the ECD and CD method, as shown in Fig. S7b and e and Table S6 (ESI).† For the devices based on the FAPbI3 perovskite without excess PbI2 in the precursor, pH < 1 may be required to achieve the efficiency of the ECD device close to that of the CD device, as shown in Fig. S7c and f and Table S7 (ESI).† These show that different SnO2 films are needed for different perovskite films. The property of SnO2 is not the only factor affecting the performance of the device. The physicochemical properties of the perovskite are also important factors affecting the efficiency of devices. For the same SnO2 (pH = 2) film, the devices based on MAPbI3 perovskite do not have an obvious S-type, and the S-type appears in devices based on the FAPbI3 perovskite without excess PbI2 in the precursor. These also indicate that the generation of S-type is related to the perovskite. On the other hand, for the same perovskite, different SnO2 films will also lead to different J–V curves, which indicates that the SnO2 film is also an important factor affecting the curve. Therefore, the appearance of the S-type curve is related to the interface between SnO2 and the perovskite. This is consistent with our previous theory on the energy level structure.
In particular, Fig. S8 (ESI)† shows the effect of adding excessive PbI2 in the precursor. It is found that the device performance is close before and after adding excessive PbI2 for SnO2 (CD) films. However, for the films obtained by ECD, adding excessive PbI2 to the precursor will lead to a significantly better device performance. It is generally believed that the addition of excessive PbI2 will affect the WF of perovskite films. Thus, perovskite with different WF has a great impact on the device performance, which also confirms the previous energy level theory. In addition, this also shows that SnO2 with different WF has the advantage to be applied in different perovskites.

Fig. 6c displays external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and their integrated Jsc curves. Compared with devices based on SnO2 (CD), devices made by SnO2 (ECD) show a higher EQE value between 350 and 650 nm. This may be due to better optical transmittance and better charge transfer at the interface facilitated by the more matched energy band and the coherent layer. Thus, the integrated Jsc of the devices based on SnO2 (pH = 3), SnO2 (pH = 2), SnO2 (pH = 1), and SnO2 (CD) can be calculated to be 23.74, 23.89, 23.66, and 22.98 mA cm−2, respectively, according to the following formula. Jint = q∫EQE(λ)AM 1.5G(λ)dλ.(9)
This result can correspond well with the J–V measurement, with an error of less than 5%.

Fig. 6d shows the distribution statistical graph of PCE for the device based on different SnO2. The average PCE for 20 cells is 16.74%, 18.39%, 21.14%, and 20.25%, respectively, for devices based on SnO2 (pH = 3), SnO2 (pH = 2), SnO2 (pH = 1), and SnO2 (CD). A significant increase in device efficiency and a tighter efficiency distribution can be observed as the pH decreases. Better reproducibility for low pH SnO2 film is favorable to the commercialization process. The more detailed photovoltaic parameters statistics charts for devices based on different SnO2 films are shown in Fig. S9a–d (ESI).† The device based on SnO2 (ECD) all display a larger Jsc, which is consistent with the results of EQE and optical transmittance. Fig. 6e shows current density and PCE values at the maximum power output point (MPP). All devices display well continuous output stability for more than 2000 s. This confirms that the devices we have made work well.38 Fig. S10 (ESI)† displays a maximum power point tracking for devices with different SnO2 preparation methods measured under 1 Sun illumination without the ultraviolet filter. Both types of devices show good stability, indicating that the devices work well.
The lifetime of the devices based on different SnO2 films is shown in Fig. 6f. After 50 days of storage in a nitrogen atmosphere, the devices based on SnO2 (pH = 3), SnO2 (pH = 2), SnO2 (pH = 1), and SnO2 (CD) maintain their initial efficiencies of 65%, 71%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. For the device based on SnO2 (ECD), the device lifetime slightly improves with decreasing pH. This may be due to less SnO on the ETL film and a more acidic preparation environment for SnO2 (pH = 1), which allows fewer hydroxyl groups to be adsorbed on the surface of the film. The hydroxyl will combine with FAI or MAI to accelerate the decomposition of the perovskite. On the other hand, for devices with SnO2 (pH = 3) and SnO2 (pH = 2), the mismatch of the interface energy levels will lead to the accumulation of carriers, which will also accelerate the decomposition of the perovskite. Thus, the SnO2 (pH = 1) device ultimately shows better device lifetime among SnO2 (ECD) devices.39,40 The device lifetime based on SnO2 (ECD) is slightly lower than that of SnO2 (CD). This is probably because we do not take annealing measures but vacuum drying at room temperature. The latter method may lead to very few water molecules, causing a slightly decreased lifetime. But the process of vacuum drying at room temperature can be applied in wider scenarios.
The Mott–Schottky analysis was done in dark conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. S11a (ESI).† The built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices can be extracted from the χ-intercept of the straight line in the C−2–V curves. The Vbi of devices with SnO2 (pH = 3) is significantly smaller than others, which may be due to serious carrier recombination. The Vbi are 0.96, 1.02, and 0.99 V, respectively, for devices with SnO2 (pH = 2), SnO2 (pH = 1), and SnO2 (CD). This is generally consistent with the Voc of these devices. The SnO2 (pH = 1) device displays the highest Vbi, which may be because the more matched band gap generates a higher driving force. This is beneficial for increasing charge separation and collection efficiencies.41 Moreover, the Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were obtained to study the charge recombination behaviors of different devices, as shown in Fig. S11b (ESI).† The device based on SnO2 (pH = 1) shows a larger recombination resistance (Rrec), which suggests less charge recombination in it. This is consistent with the device efficiency.42
2.5. For commercialization
To verify the applicability of the ECD method in a large area,43 the SnO2 films of 10 × 10 cm were prepared using ECD, as shown in Fig. 7a. In detail, the applicability is verified by characterizing whether the films have similar performance in different regions.38 Before cleaning, pre-cutting needs be done on the back side of the substrate so that it can easily split into small pieces after SnO2 deposition. Then, the SnO2 film is deposited on a large-area substrate following the same ECD process. We later divide it into small pieces after the deposition. Then, they are used to fabricate the perovskite devices. The PCE test results for the manufactured devices are shown in Fig. 7b. Devices made from large-area deposited SnO2 (L-A) exhibit a slightly smaller average PCE than those based on small-area deposited SnO2 (S-A) devices (cell area: 0.15 cm2; total size: 1.5 × 1.5 cm), which may be due to minor inaccuracy caused by batch differences. The PCE distribution of the large-area devices is close to that of the small-area ones, which proves that the large-area SnO2 films we deposited are uniform. In addition, we also prepared a full device with a medium area of 0.99 cm2; the schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 7c. Ultimately, the best PCE of 19.21% is achieved based on such devices. Specifically, there is a significant decrease in the FF of the device compared with small-area devices. This may be because the export of current may be limited for medium area. In all, the ECD method is suitable for large-area preparation and performs well. This may be because the ECD method relies on the electrical potential. As long as the conductive substrates are uniform, a uniform SnO2 film may be obtained. These also show the advantages of the ECD method in the application.

To explore the applicability of the ECD method in the flexible field,44 a flexible device was prepared, as shown in Fig. 7d. In this device, FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 was used as the perovskite layer due to the limitation of the annealing temperature. The results show that the best PCE of 18.19% can be achieved for SnO2 (ECD). Moreover, the devices can still achieve a close efficiency after more than 100 bending experiments. This shows that the ECD method is suitable for flexible devices. These may be due to the advantages of compactness and uniformity of the SnO2 (ECD) film.
Besides, the ECD method does not need high-purity raw materials, which is conducive for cost saving. Interestingly, in this method, the SnO2 film with different SnO contents in the upper and lower may be achieved by adjusting the electrolyte pH at different stages of deposition. This can achieve less residual SnO at the interface to reduce interface recombination. In addition, SnO/Sn0 can be oxidized to SnO2 when the positive bias voltage is applied to the substrate. By applying the bias voltage with a specific waveform, the deposition rate of the suitable SnO2 may be further improved. By this, even SnO2 with a specific function may be realized. These also demonstrate that the ECD method has great potential for commercial applications.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have prepared polycrystalline SnO2 films by the ECD method at room temperature. This is an optimized method of the CBD and ED methods. Also, it shows the multi-advantages of the simple process, suitable deposition rate, and dense uniform deposition film. The method also shows a wider range in optimization and application. Thus, by regulating the pH of the electrolytes, the content of SnO can be controlled to achieve adjustable WF in the obtained SnO2 film. This is conducive for obtaining perfect energy level arrangements at the interface, which can reduce carrier accumulation and interface non-radiative recombination. Besides, the dense and uniform SnO2 film is deposited along the substrate profile, leading to excellent transmittance. This is conducive for obtaining a higher photocurrent. Based on these multi-advantages, the devices based on SnO2 (pH = 1) films have excellent energy level matching and achieve the best PCE of 22.85%. The performance is higher than that of 21.72% based on SnO2 (CD) films. More importantly, this ECD method is suitable for large-area commercial applications to obtain homogeneous SnO2 films. It can also be applied to flexible devices to obtain a PCE of more than 18%.

4.2. Deposition of SnO2

Electrochemical deposition. 
The electrolyte was prepared by mixing 225 mg of SnCl2·2H2O, 745.5 mg of KCl, and some HCl per 50 mL of DI water. 0, 22, or 242 μL of HCl (12 M) was added to obtain solutions with approximate pH = 3, 2, and 1. The cleaned ITO was treated with plasma for 5 min to increase its hydrophilicity. Then, the ITO was used as the working electrode to deposit SnO2.
Traditionally, ITO was connected to the negative electrode, and graphite rod was used as the counter-electrode. A voltage of −0.4 V was applied to ITO to deposit SnO2 on it. Equivalently, we used a cleaned and chemically activated iron sheet, which clings to the reserved electrode on the ITO. Then, it was placed in the electrolyte directly to deposit the SnO2 film in the unshaded area. This method has a similar electrochemical principle to the method that applied a bias voltage, and it may have the advantage of avoiding unnecessary contamination. The schematic of the manufacturing process is shown in Fig. 2a and S1a (ESI).†
Specifically, 24-well cell culture plates were used as the electrolytic container, and the whole deposition process was carried out at room temperature. The deposition rate is different for different pH electrolytes. Thus, the deposition durations were 10 min, 20 min, and 50 min for pH = 3, 2, and 1 electrolytes, respectively, with the electrolytes changed every 5 min. After the deposition of SnO2, the obtained films were immersed in DI water for more than 8 h and were cleaned using ultrasonication for 10 min. Last, the obtained films were dried under a vacuum and were treated with plasma for 10 min.


Spin-coated commercialized colloidal dispersions. 
The purchased SnO2 colloidal dispersion was diluted in DI water with a volume ratio of 1:4 to obtain 3 wt% H2O solutions. Then, it was spin-coated on ITO at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 1 h. After cooling, these films were treated with plasma for 10 min.

4.3. Device fabrication
The FA-based perovskite was used, and little MAPbBr3 was added to assist the crystallization of the perovskite. The precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.38 M PbI2, 1.35 M FAI, 0.43 M MACl, and 0.0114 M MAPbBr3 in DMF:DMSO = 17:3. In it, an excess of 2.5% PbI2 was added to change the work function of the perovskite. The perovskite precursor was dropped on the central ETL, rotated at 1000 rpm for 2 s and 4500 rpm for 20 s, and 100 μL THF anti-solvent was added at about 15th s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 20 min. The anti-solvent should be dropped on the place 1/4 from the center with a 30 mm height. Afterward, 0.25 mg mL−1 PEAI solution was rotated on it at 4000 rpm for 30 s.
For the two-step method device, 1.5 M PbI2 was dissolved in mixed solvent DMSO:DMF = 1:9. 90 mg FAI, 6.39 mg MAI, and 9 mg MACl were dissolved in 1 mL IPA. Firstly, PbI2 was rotated on ETL film at 1500 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 70 °C for 1 min. After cooling, the previous IPA solvent was dropped on the rotating substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Then, it was heated at 90 °C for 1 min in N2 and 150 °C for 30 min in air. FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 and MAPbI3 were prepared with the reported method.29,30
For the hole transport layer (HTL), 72 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 29 μL TBP, and 18 μL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 in CAN) were added to 1 mL CB solution to obtain the precursor. Then, HTL was obtained by spin-coating the spiro-OMeTAD precursor at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the obtained device was oxidized for 15 h in a desiccator. Finally, the Ag electrode was thermally evaporated on it for 90 nm under 1.2 × 10−6 torr vacuum.
