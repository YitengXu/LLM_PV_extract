    , Accepted 3rd January 2019First published on 12th January 2019AbstractSince inverted organic solar cells have shown great advantages in achieving good stability, developing effective methods to increase power conversion efficiency is very important for practical applications. The demand for improving the photovoltaic performance has promoted excellent modulations of all components in inverted devices including electron transporting layers. Here, we developed an effective method of achieving systematic tuning of surface free energy of ZnO electron transporting layers with continuous gradation from 51.23 mN m−1 to 76.62 mN m−1 by mixing ZnO nanoparticles with PFN-Br. Based on the highly efficient bulk heterojunction system PBDB-TF:IT-4F, we achieved enhanced open circuit voltage (0.87 V), fill factor (78.79%) and power conversion efficiency (13.82%) in inverted device which is benefitted from the optimized bulk heterojunction morphology on electron transporting layer with 63.89 mN m−1 surface free energy. Moreover, the optimized electron transporting layer showed much better stability than the control ZnO electron transporting layer due to the well-modified dispersity of nanoparticles. Our comprehensive analyses provide deep insights into the recombination/morphology control adjusted by the surface free energy of interfacial layers, which shall be the key factors affecting the device characteristics of inverted organic solar cells.
Owing to great potentials in solution processing, low cost of electricity and high flexibility, organic solar cells (OSCs) stand out as a competitive photovoltaic technology that has received tremendous attention in recent years.1,2 Many efforts have been devoted for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE)3–6 and stability since these are the two essential factors required for the practical applications of the state-of-the-art OSCs.7–9 Apart from excellent material design and interfacial optimization, the device architecture also plays an important role to fully reach the potential of OSCs toward outstanding photovoltaic performance.10,11 Since the first example reported in 2006,10 inverted OSCs have shown great advantages in achieving high short circuit current density (JSC)11–13 and stability7,8 due to well-organized light distribution, reasonable vertical component distribution and enhanced robustness of the charge transporting interlayers.14–16 These merits make the inverted architecture a promising solution to boost the throughput for OSCs.
In addition to the properties of BHJ materials that have received considerable improvement very recently,4,17 the demand for ameliorations of routine interfacial layers has become pronounced since the characteristics of traditional interfacial layers cannot match the development of versatile situations. For example, the open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of inverted devices are generally lower than those of conventional devices13,17 with only a few exceptions, e.g., PTB7-based BHJ OSCs.11 As has been pointed out, FF of an OSC significantly depends on the effectiveness of charge generation, which involves multi-processes of charge transport, recombination and extraction.18,19 Regarding VOC, it is governed by the splitting of quasi-Fermi levels of the donor and acceptor, following the general equation20 (1)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, Eg is the effective band gap of BHJ, Eε is the measure of VOC losses generally related to the energetic disorder, n(p) is the free electron(hole) carrier density, and N(P) is the total density of states for electrons (holes). In eqn (1), the last two terms Eε and kTln(np/NP) are subject to coulombic interactions in electron–hole pairs, driving force for exciton dissociation, and carrier mobility in BHJ. In a morphological standpoint, the losses in VOC and FF have been ascribed to unsatisfactory molecular orientation, aggregation behavior or domain properties, which are all governed by the inherent properties of BHJ films and solution processing methods. Given that lower VOCs and FFs are often observed for inverted devices compared to those observed for their conventional counterparts even with identical BHJ systems, it is important to establish in-depth correlations among interface surface conditions, BHJ film morphology and ultimate photovoltaic performance to further boost efficiencies of inverted OSCs.
In solution-processed optoelectronic devices, the surface free energy (γS) of underlying interlayers accounts for the film formation of top-coated active layers, e.g., in OSCs21–25 or organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).26 However, conceivable relationship between the morphology of the active layer and the resulting optoelectronic properties is ambiguous due to the difficulty in precisely matching γS of the interlayer to the large array of BHJ systems. Thus, developing an effective method of tuning γS of commonly used electron transporting layers (ETLs) with specific compounds is a pragmatic and economical guiding principle. If possible, advanced strategy for continuously modifying γS of underlying interlayer should be proposed to act according to the circumstances of various BHJ materials. However, there is still a lack of viable methodologies to attain continuous tuning of γS together with a clear correlation among γS of interfacial surfaces, BHJ layer morphology and device performance.
Among various ETL materials, zinc oxide (ZnO) shows outstanding properties due to the low absorbance, appropriate optoelectronic properties, and low cost.3,14,21,27,28 Although ZnO ETLs prepared by the sol–gel method exhibit effective electron withdrawing in OSCs, the high processing temperature required hinders their realistic applications.29 An alternative preparation route for ZnO ETLs without thermal annealing is afforded by ZnO nanoparticle (ZnO NP) emulsion, which allows applications in flexible devices with plastic substrates.28,30 Moreover, the large specific surface area of ZnO NPs facilitates surface modification, which can adjust γS of the resulting thin films. This enables us to control the formation of ETLs and optimize the BHJ morphology to obtain enhanced efficiency and stability for inverted OSCs. Given that fundamental investigations in these aspects are still lacking, in this study, we put forward an effective method of systematic tuning of γS of ZnO NP thin films for the first time. This was implemented by introducing relatively hydrophobic poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-Br)31 into ZnO NP emulsion. With the modified ETL ZnO:PFN-Br sample, γS of ETL could be continuously tuned with gradation from 51.23 mN m−1 to 76.62 mN m−1via tuning the ratio of ZnO NPs/PFN-Br. Based on a high-performance PBDB-TF:IT-4F binary blend, we achieved optimized BHJ morphology by coating the film on ZnO:PFN-Br ETL with γS = 63.89 mN m−1. Due to the finely tuned BHJ morphology, the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss), carrier mobility, carrier life time (τ) and energy level of charge transfer state (ECT) were effectively modified, leading to VOC of 0.87 V, FF of 78.79% and ultimate PCE of 13.82% for the PBDB-TF:IT-4F device. More importantly, we demonstrated that the introduction of PFN-Br decreased excessive γS of ZnO NP thin films and prevented ZnO NPs from aggregation, which considerably enhanced the stability of OSCs. The advantages of ZnO NPs ETLs in rendering γS modification and thus BHJ morphology optimization open a way for attaining high-performance and stable OSCs with inverted structures.
As preliminary experiments, we compared photovoltaic performances utilizing different architectures for devices containing identical BHJ active layers. The detailed results are plotted in Fig. S1,† in which all the tested BHJ devices yield lower VOC and FF using inverted configuration. To this end, it is imperative to develop an effective method to improve VOC and FF of inverted OSCs. We chose ZnO NPs for the test bed considering their outstanding electron-withdrawing property afforded by simple fabrication procedures.27,28,30 ZnO NPs were synthesized by following a widely used method described in the literature;27,30 they exhibited large tendency to aggregate due to the absence of surface ligands. To improve the stability and more importantly to tune γS of ETLs, we incorporated PFN-Bras, a hydrophobic component, into ZnO NPs given its lipophilicity and excellent electron-withdrawing ability. Different ratios (100:0, 97:3, 90:10, 70:30 and 0:100) of PFN-Br solution were added to the ZnO emulsion. To determine the structure of NPs and interaction between ZnO and PFN-Br, we performed powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br (90:10) (shown in Fig. 1a). The XRD patterns of both samples exhibited the same reflections as the standard pattern of wurtzite ZnO (PDF#36-1451). This demonstrated that the lattice structures of ZnO were maintained after the introduction of PFN-Br. The similar XRD patterns also eliminated the possibility of the penetration of bromide ions into ZnO lattice, due to which the optoelectronic properties of ZnO and PFN-Br were not disturbed in the ZnO:PFN-Br blend. This argument was further confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) shown in Fig. 1b. The calculated work functions (WFs) of different interlayers are summarized in Table 1. WFs of ZnO, ZnO:PFN-Br and PFN-Br layers were 4.11 eV, 4.11 eV and 4.17 eV, respectively. For ZnO:PFN-Br ETL, the small variation in WF indicated an effective energy level alignment with IT-4F acceptor.

Next, we examined how the introduction of PFN-Br impacted the properties of ZnO NP thin films. Based on the morphological studies with atomic force microscopy (AFM), we noted a comparable surface roughness in ZnO:PFN-Br- and ZnO-based ETLs, while the roughness slightly reduced in pure PFN-Br (Fig. 1c–e). Moreover, as shown in the phase images (Fig. 1f–h), ZnO:PFN-Br exhibited the maximum angular phase difference among the three studied samples, which indicated that the surface of ZnO:PFN-Br (90:10) ETL consisted of both ZnO and PFN-Br. Then, we employed contact angle characterization to determine γS of the studied surfaces; the results are shown in Fig. 1i and Table 1. The γS values of ITO/ZnO, ITO/ZnO:PFN-Br (90:10) and ITO/PFN-Br were 76.62 mN m−1, 63.89 mN m−1 and 51.23 mN m−1, respectively. The remarkable changes in γS of PFN-Br-induced ZnO validated the effectiveness of our method to tune γS of ETLs.
With the demonstrated modification of the surface properties of ZnO NP ETLs, we explored the impact of γS on the photovoltaic behaviors of inverted PBDB-TF:IT-4F solar cells (please see the device structure in Fig. 2a). BHJ was sandwiched between ETLs and MoO3 with ITO and aluminium electrodes. Detailed device fabrication procedures can be found in ESI.† The energy level diagram of individual components is shown in Fig. 2b based on reported values4,14,17 and our UPS data. Fig. 2c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characterization of inverted OSCs with various ETLs under light intensity of AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 and the extracted device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device based on ZnO:PFN-Br ETL showed improved VOC (from 0.85 V to 0.87 V), FF (from 73.42% to 78.79%) and PCE (from 12.56% to 13.82%) compared to the device based on ZnO. To the best of our knowledge, FF of 78.79% for the device with modified ETLs (ZnO:PFN-Br, 90:10) is the highest value reported to date among inverted fullerene-free OSCs. All the JSC values extracted from J–V curves were well verified using external quantum efficiency (EQE) characterization (Fig. 2d) with the low error, which proved the accuracy of our analysis.

(h) Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy together with fittings with Marcus equation of devices for different ETLs. Inset figures are zoomed-in spectra with energy ranging from 1.2 eV to 1.5 eV. 
Furthermore, we also used JSCs calculated from EQE data to make a comprehensive comparison between the devices with ZnO ETL and ZnO:PFN-Br ETL. Due to 13.83% PCE of the device with ZnO:PFN-Br ETL (using integral JSC for PCE calculation), 10.29% increase in PCE was observed compared to 12.54% PCE of device with ZnO ETL, which was similar to the increase in PCE in J–V characterization (10.03%). This information confirmed the effectiveness of our method. The improved VOC, FF and ultimate PCE indicated that the modified ETL based on ZnO:PFN-Br (90:10) provided satisfactory functionalities to realize high performance of PBDB-TF:IT-4F OSCs with an inverted structure.
It has been shown that FF of OCSs is subject to charge recombination occurring at BHJ and interfacial layers. To understand the increase in FF, we employed transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) to determine the carrier life times and electron extraction times in solar cells with different ETLs. In practice, both TPV and TPC characterizations were carried out under excitation at 2.54 eV by a pulsed laser without applying any white light bias. Since the TPV measurement was performed in an open circuit condition, the effects induced by charge extraction or transport processes were minimized, which facilitated our comparisons of the τ values of solar cells containing different ETLs. As shown in Fig. 2e, the normalized TPV curve of ZnO:PFN-Br device exhibits longer τ (230.22 μs) when compared to that of the other two devices. In the ZnO:PFN-Br-based device, the photocarriers having longer lifetimes can be understood by the retardation of charge recombination, at least at open-circuit condition,32 which may be linked to modified morphology. Next, we turned to the decay kinetics at short-circuit condition under the same laser excitation. In this condition, the recombination of photo carriers was suppressed due to the enlargement of electrical fields (compared to the scenario in TPV) and thus, the temporal profile mainly reflected the efficiency of charge extraction in the solar cell. As shown in Fig. 2f, the decay traces of the three devices nearly overlap with each other, suggesting that the charge extraction times of these devices are comparable. This result was in agreement with the similar WF of ETLs determined by UPS measurements. In a theoretical investigation of a variety of BHJ systems, it was found that FF of solar cells could be correlated to the ratio of charge extraction time to that of recombination defined by a dimensionless parameter θ. A higher FF is often associated with a smaller ratio of θ, indicating that the equilibrium between extraction and recombination shifts toward the former process.33 In our case, θ was indeed the smallest in the device with ZnO:PFN-Br, which proved the enhancement of FF. As the recombination at low electrical field was mitigated by using ZnO:PFN-Br, the resultant longer τ was expected to boost the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) in the optimized device. For this purpose, we plotted the photocurrent (Jph) versus effective bias (Veff), from which Pdiss can be assessed. In this case, Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2, and Vappl is the applied voltage of external circuit. As shown in Fig. 2g and Table 2, analogies in the saturated photocurrent (Jsat) were observed for the devices with ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br ETLs, while Jsat of the PFN-Br-based cell reduced, pointing to more severe exciton losses due to low exciton concentration at the donor/acceptor interface. The Pdiss value slightly increased from 91.71% (with ZnO) to 92.82% (with ZnO/PFN-Br), and this trend was consistent with the results of TPV analysis showing reduction in recombination with the modified ETL.

The longer-lived photocarriers in the device with ZnO:PFN-Br ETL could be attributed to the suppression of non-radiative recombination. Based on mobility measurements with a space charge limited current model (SCLC), the hole mobilities (μh) of the devices with ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br were 5.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; the electron mobilities (μe) were 4.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S2†). While the increased μh and μe values did not lead to visible enhancements in charge extraction at short-circuit condition, the suppression of non-radiative recombination in the ZnO:PFN-Br device at low electrical fields could be interpreted by the improved mobility, which could be partly responsible for increase in FF. We further resorted to Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) to explore charge transfer state (CTS) properties of these solar cells. Fig. 2h shows the CTS region of EQE spectra of devices with various ETLs. The ECT values from the fitting with Marcus equation were 1.46 eV and 1.48 eV for ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br devices, respectively. The difference between the ECT values of ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br devices was 0.02 eV, which was equal to the difference between the VOC values of the two devices. Despite the unchanged voltage losses governed by (ECT − qVOC), the utilization of ZnO:PFN-Br ETL benefitted the increase in ECT and eventually in VOC of the solar cell. Based on the fittings for the FTPS measurements, the parameter of λ can be extracted, which refers to the internal/environmental reorganization energy and/or energetic disorder. In our case, the value of λ may also be related to the morphological changes in the same BHJ films. We attained λ of 0.19 eV for BHJ on ZnO, 0.13 eV for BHJ on ZnO:PFN-Br and 0.19 eV for BHJ on PFN-Br. Smaller λ values are related to more efficient charge dissociations at the donor/acceptor interface within the BHJ film. To this end, lower λ of the ZnO:PFN-Br-based device was fully consistent with larger Pdiss, which translated to the enhancements in FF and ultimate PCE.
Based on the significantly improved optoelectronic properties, we tried to determine the reasons behind these observations. With this purpose, we performed grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) on the ETL-assisted BHJs. The 2D diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 3a–f, and the corresponding line-cut profile curves along in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) orientations are displayed in Fig. 3h and i. In the in-plane profiles, we observe evident peaks at 0.29 Å−1 (corresponding to d-spacing of 21.67 Å) for ZnO/PBDB-TF and ZnO:PFN-Br/PBDB-TF samples.13 Along the out-of-plane orientation, we observe additional peaks at 0.94 Å−1 (d-spacing of 6.68 Å), 1.25 Å−1 (d-spacing of 5.03 Å) and 1.73 Å−1 (π–π stacking of 3.63 Å) for PBDB-TF donor cast on both substrates (Fig. 3l). By comparing these peaks, we inferred that the PBDB-TF film possessed enhanced lamellar packing at all azimuthal angles when solution-casted on PFN-Br-modified ZnO ETL. Differently, the lamellar packing of ZnO/PBDB-TF only existed along the out-of-plane direction. This result may indicate enhanced molecular ordering in neat PBDB-TF films. The impact of ETL on stacking was also reflected in neat IT-4F acceptor films, i.e., we could not observe any OOP populations for ZnO/IT-4F, while the ZnO:PFN-Br/IT-4F sample displayed pronounced scattering peaks at 0.31 Å−1 (d-spacing of 20.27 Å) and 1.75 Å−1 (π–π stacking of 3.59 Å). Importantly, enhanced crystallinity with short-range order in amorphous IT-4F was promoted by ZnO:PFN-Br ETL through the tuning of γS. Such modulation of crystallinity by γS was also manifested by GIWAXS of BHJ films. In ZnO/BHJ, a broad diffraction halo was noted in the range from ∼1.30 Å−1 to ∼1.90 Å−1, which was in contrast to the sharper features observed in the GIWAXS of ZnO:PFN-Br/BHJ sample. The π–π stacking dominantly adapted to the OOP orientation with the optimized γS for the ETL. The results of GIWAXS unambiguously confirmed the enhanced crystallinity and molecular orientation in the BHJ film upon casting on ZnO:PFN-Br ETL, and they were consistent with the improved performance of the ZnO:PFN-Br devices.

(j) Light intensity-dependent FF of devices based on ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br ETLs. 
We further examined the surface morphology of BHJ films with AFM. As shown in Fig S3,† the surface of ZnO:PFN-Br/BHJ is more uniform than that of ZnO/BHJ, showing lower Rq (2.03 nm) and Rmax (17.03 nm) in the former. The fiber-like structures in ZnO:PFN-Br/BHJ could contribute to the enhanced charge transport with larger mobilities in the BHJ film.34 The smoother surface of BHJ was beneficial for hole collection through the top MoO3 interlayer toward the anode. Fig. 3g shows phase images of ZnO:PFN-Br/BHJ and ZnO/BHJ. We observe increased homogeneity of the domain distribution in ZnO:PFN-Br/BHJ, showing continuous transport networks. The results indicated well-controlled nanoscale phase segregation in PBDB-TH:IT-4F assisted by modified γS. On the contrary, larger domain sizes with less homogenous features were observed in the BHJ prepared on ZnO. To better link the morphological ameliorations with the recombination processes in solar cells, we compared light intensity (Plight)-dependent FF of devices with those of ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br ETLs. When FF is limited by recombination, one expects increased FF with decrease in Plight, according to the relation B = βnp (where B is the recombination rate, β is the recombination coefficient, and n and p are the electron and hole densities, respectively). Within a wide range of Plight from 7 to 100 mW cm−2, FFs of ZnO:PFN-Br-containing device all exceeded 75%, while the ZnO-based device displayed significant reduction in FF at lower Plight. In regimes where FF was inversely proportional to Plight, indicating recombination-limited FF, the overall larger FFs in the ZnO:PFN-Br device confirmed the less significant recombination losses, which were possibly due to stronger π–π intermolecular stacking along the out-of-plane direction. Based on these analyses, it can be inferred that the modified ETL (ZnO:PFN-Br) effectively improves the crystallinity and morphology of BHJ. The resulting nanoscale phase-segregated and inter-percolated transport networks boosted the carrier mobility and carrier life time of the optimized device.
To evaluate the effect on stability brought by the modified ETL, we investigated the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ZnO NPs and PFN-Br-treated ZnO NPs. As shown in Fig. 4a, the TEM images show that ZnO NPs aggregate significantly. With the addition of PFN-Br (90:10), the aggregation tendency was beneficially minimized. This indicated that the ZnO:PFN-Br film was more stable when fabricated from the emulsion with much better dispersity. The improved stability of ZnO:PFN-Br blend promoted the stability of surface morphology of prepared ETLs. As shown in Fig. 4c–f, the morphology of the aged ZnO NPs changes significantly, which is in contrast to the intact morphology of ZnO:PFN-Br after one-month storage in an N2 atmosphere. Using the aged ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br powders, we tested XRD of the studied ETLs to obtain lattice information. As shown in Fig. 4g, the diffraction profile of aged ZnO NPs demonstrates significant differences when compared to that of ZnO:PFN-Br. The diffraction intensity of pure ZnO decreased drastically, while the Bragg reflections of ZnO:PFN-Br remained almost unchanged when compared to the patterns of fresh ZnO:PFN-Br (Fig. 1a), which demonstrates that the stability of ZnO:PFN-Br increased. Moreover, by using the aged ETLs, we fabricated inverted OSCs; the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4h. The much higher FF and VOC demonstrated that the PFN-Br-mixed ZnO is a promising ETL with good stability. After gaining insights into the stability of ETLs, we examined the decays of PCE in devices with ZnO and ZnO:PFN-Br ETLs. In one month, 90% of the initial efficiency was maintained in the ZnO:PFN-Br device, which could be attributed to the stabilized ETL (Fig. 4i). The combination of these results evidenced that after mixing with PFN-Br, the ETL becomes more stabilized, retarding the degradation of PCEs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed an effective method of achieving systematic tuning of γS of ZnO ETLs with continuous gradation from 51.23 mN m−1 to 76.62 mN m−1. Based on the highly efficient BHJ system PBDB-TF:IT-4F, we achieved optimized BHJ morphology on ETL with γS = 63.89 mN m−1. Benefitting from the optimized BHJ morphology, effective modifications of the properties of exciton dissociation, charge transport, recombination and charge transfer states were enabled toward decrease in recombination losses. Based on finely tuned γS, we achieved enhanced VOC of 0.87 V and FF of 78.79%, boosting the PCE to 13.82% for inverted devices. In addition to the improvement in PCEs, our comprehensive analyses provided deep insights into recombination and morphology control adjusted by γS of interface layers, which are the key factors that affect the device characteristics of inverted OSCs. More importantly, through the introduction of PFN-Br into ZnO ETL, we showed that the stability of ETL increased, which was related to the suppressed aggregations of ZnO NPs. As a result, slower decays in the PCE of PBDB-TF:IT-4F devices could be realized, maintaining 90% of the initial performance. The demonstrated work of fine tuning γS of interface layers offers an efficient strategy to enhance the photovoltaic performance and stability of inverted OSCs for energy conversion devices.
