    , Accepted 7th August 2021First published on 25th August 2021AbstractA two-step sequential deposition has been a reliable method to synthesize large-area and high-quality perovskite films due to its better reproducibility. However, the long-term performance and stability of thin films are adversely affected by the slow and incomplete transformation of PbI2 to perovskites. Here, we propose a nanosecond laser shock annealing process to induce ultrafast organic salt diffusion into the PbI2 layer to modulate the crystalline structure, residual tensile strain, and electron transport kinetics in two-step fabricated halide perovskite films. We found that pulse-laser induced ultrafast diffusion reduces the thickness of the residual PbI2 layer at the bottom of the perovskite film fabricated by a two-step method, resulting in the reduction of residual tensile strain by over seven times. The shocking moment of the nanosecond laser promotes the diffusion of the organic salt to the PbI2 layer. Compared to traditional thermal annealing, ultrafast laser shock annealing enhances the molecular interaction, which significantly affects the orbital overlap resulting in band structure changes. Laser shock annealing induced modulation of band structures in perovskites leads to remarkable improvement in their carrier lifetime, producing a responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) of 2.45 A W−1 and 1.48 × 1012 Jones, respectively. Besides, the stability testing under various harsh thermal and humid thermal conditions shows that laser shock annealing improves the stability of perovskite thin films as a result of the reduced PbI2 layer and residual tensile strain. The presented technology that utilizes laser shock annealing to modulate the ultrafast diffusion in the PbI2 layer provides a guideline for future improvement in the device performance and stability of hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites have been a promising material for photoelectric devices due to their outstanding photoelectric properties,1 including high carrier mobility,2 low exciton binding energy,3 high optical absorption coefficient,4 and long carrier diffusion length.5 In 2009, Miyasaka's group reported that solar cells with perovskites as the light-absorbing layer achieved 3.8% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the first time.6 Consequently, the PCE of the perovskite rapidly improved from 3.8% to 25.2% in the last couple of years,7–10 comparable to those of silicon-based solar cells. Although a high PCE has been achieved in perovskite solar cells over the last decade, numerous problems still need to be eliminated to commercialize perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.11 In particular, the morphology, crystallinity, defects, chemical composition, and interfaces between layers in perovskite films play a crucial role in carrier transportation, long-term performance and stability of the device. So far, many methods have been used to prepare the perovskite layer. In the early pioneering studies, the mainstream method is the one-step method.12–14 However, the precursor solution produces some uncontrollable sediment in the process of the one-step method, resulting in uneven perovskite films and poor coverage,15,16 undesired morphology and crystallization,17 and poor reproducibility.18 Two-step sequential deposition has been proposed as a reliable method to fabricate high-quality perovskite films.15 Subsequently, there have been many studies based on the two-step method taking advantage of its superior morphological control and reproducibility.18–20 However, one of the most critical issues in the two-step sequential deposition method is the incomplete conversion of PbI221–23 during synthesis of the perovskite thin film. It is difficult for the precursor, methylamine hydroiodide (MAI), to come into contact with PbI2 crystals,21 leading to unconverted residual PbI2. Excess residual PbI2 suppresses the initial charge separation, hinders the carrier transportation, increases the trap states,24,25 and reduces the stability of perovskite films.26,27 Therefore, regulating the organic cation diffusion to the PbI2 layer in halide perovskite films is the key to enhance its performance and stability, and the post-annealing process such as thermal annealing (TA) has been applied to address the issues of incomplete diffusion of PbI2. Laser-assisted crystallization has been recently applied to the halide perovskite film due to its incomparable controllability and process efficiency, and in particular, the ultrafast thermal and cooling process to modulate the crystal structure, defects, and residual stress.28–30 Compared with continuous laser annealing, pulsed laser annealing can generate thermo-mechanical pressure to modulate the strain of perovskite films, reduce the porosity, and reduce the surface trap density in perovskite thin films.31,32 Recently, it has been discovered that the hydrophilicity of halide perovskite films has been improved by employing a nanosecond laser.33 Besides, ultrafast laser scanning can optimize the orientation by selective growth in perovskite crystals.34 And a nanosecond laser also can be used to form a new phase from the metastable phase.35 In order to produce halide perovskite films with superior stability, it is desirable to utilize pulsed laser processing to control the strain and electron transport kinetics in the halide perovskite thin film fabricated by two-step methods.
In this work, we demonstrate a facile process that combines two-step methods and nanosecond laser shock annealing, to facilitate organic salt diffusion to control the lead iodide (PbI2) layer during the fabrication of the halide perovskite thin films. The ultrafast shock momentum and rapid heating promote the diffusion of organic salts to the PbI2 layer and the thermochemical reaction to form perovskites. Meanwhile, the temperature gradient during pulse laser processing facilitates the Ostwald ripening of perovskites during nanosecond laser radiation and promotes grain growth. By adjusting the nanosecond laser scanning speed, the PbI2 layer below the perovskite thin-film gradually disappeared, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Besides, nanosecond laser shock momentum releases a residual tensile strain of perovskite thin films, resulting in enhancing the interaction between organic cations and inorganic framework. Subsequently, the band structure after the shock processing will be investigated by theory and experiments. To have an in-depth understanding of the impact of band structures on carrier transport kinetics of perovskite thin films, the changes in the carrier lifetime and mobility will be verified by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and Hall measurements. The carrier transport kinetics will be studied to show how the photocurrent in a perovskite thin-film photodetector is affected by laser shock annealing. The changes in the residual tensile strain and PbI2 layer after the laser shock annealing will be studied. This work will develop the mechanism of how organic salt diffusion into PbI2 induced by nanosecond laser shock processing benefits the stabilization of the perovskite thin films. This work provides a new route for the synthesis of ideal microstructures in halide perovskite films.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Nanosecond laser shock annealing promoting organic salt diffusion in perovskite films
We fabricated FA0.95MA0.05PbI3 perovskite thin films by a two-step deposition process,36 represented as FAMA, where FA = formamidinium, CH3(NH2)2+ and MA = methylammonium, CH3NH3+. Then, the mixed organic salts FAI and MAI were diffused into the PbI2 layer by thermal annealing and nanosecond laser shock annealing, respectively. During the traditional thermal annealing, the residual PbI2 layer is always found at the bottom of perovskite thin films, which weakens the inter-layer carrier transportation and reduces the stability of perovskite optoelectronic devices.37 We proposed a process that combines two-step perovskite synthesis and a nanosecond laser shock annealing process to promote the diffusion of organic salts into the PbI2 layer, as shown in Fig. 1a. During the laser shock annealing process, the plasma was generated by a high-energy-density laser beam focused on the wet perovskite thin film surface. The plasma is restricted by the transparent dielectric glass and generates a recoil momentum resulting in a shock pressure.38 The ultrafast shock pressure can be evaluated by:39 (1)where m is the target layer mass, I0 is the laser intensity, α = 0.1 and τ is the pulse duration. This section used a 1.5 GW cm−2 laser intensity for a pulse duration of 20 ns producing an ultrafast pressure of 0.39 GPa at 500 mm s−1, which drives the downward diffusion of organic salts. As the laser scanning speed decreased, the ablation of the target layer by nanosecond laser was intensified, bringing an ultrafast pressure of 0.48 GPa at 400 mm s−1 and 0.65 GPa at 300 mm s−1. Besides, the heat of plasma was transferred to the perovskite precursor, and the perovskite was formed by a thermochemical reaction at the interface between the organic salt and the PbI2 layer. Local rapid annealing will create a temperature gradient in the perovskite film, which will promote the selective growth of perovskites and optimize the orientation of the perovskite film.34 Accompanied by ultrafast heating and cooling, Ostwald ripening induces a small perovskite grain fusion, leading to an increase in the perovskite grain size. Furthermore, nanosecond shock-induced thermomechanical pressure releases a residual tensile strain of perovskite thin films, reduces the trap density, and modulates the residual PbI2 layer, resulting in enhanced performance and stability in the halide perovskite devices.

We investigate the morphology and crystallization of FAMA perovskite thin films by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The nanosecond laser scanning speed was set to be 500 mm s−1 (LS (500 mm s−1)), 400 mm s−1 (LS (400 mm s−1)) and 300 mm s−1 (LS (300 mm s−1)), respectively. Laser processing affected the surface morphology of the films, as shown in Fig. 1b–e. We found that laser shock annealing processed films have a more uniform morphology and larger grain size, increasing the carrier lifetime.40 The grain sizes of the films were counted in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the average grain size increased with the decrease of the laser scanning speed. Temperature gradient enables Ostwald ripening of the perovskite during nanosecond laser radiation and facilitates the crystal growth for large grains. However, holes appeared on the surface of the films when the laser scanning speed was reduced to 300 mm s−1 as a result of decomposition in the FAMA perovskite thin film. We also discovered a thick layer of PbI2 below the perovskite films after traditional thermal annealing (TA) in the two-step method. This PbI2 layer was found to be much thinner after laser processing. In addition, the thickness of the residual PbI2 layer in the film decreases gradually with a decrease in the laser scanning speed from 500 mm s−1, as shown in the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1f–i). The PbI2 layer disappeared at 400 mm s−1, indicating the ultrafast shock-induced diffusion of organic slats into the PbI2 layer.41Fig. 1j shows the XRD patterns of FAMA films prepared under different conditions. The diffraction peak at 2θ =12.64° is assigned to the (001) plane of PbI2.42 The intensity of the PbI2 peak was the greatest for thermal annealing, and the PbI2 peak intensity of laser processing (500 mm s−1) was less than that of thermal annealing. Furthermore, the PbI2 peak intensity decreased with the laser scanning speed. We can barely see the PbI2 peak as the laser scanning speed is reduced to 400 mm s−1. The intensity ratio between the PbI2 peak and the main peak (110) of the FAMA perovskite thin film is shown in Fig. 1k, which is consistent with the thickness of the residual PbI2 layer shown in the cross-sectional SEM image.
2.2 The mechanism for reduction of residual tensile strain
The remaining residual tensile strain in the perovskite film results in increased ion migration and defect density, which is known as the factor that decreases the performance and stability of perovskite devices. The mechanism of residual tensile strain reduction was also explored as a result of nanosecond laser shock annealing. The decrease of the thickness of the residual PbI2 layer can be related to the reduced stress in the films. The mismatch between PbI2 lattices and perovskite lattices brought an interface strain, which impairs the stability and performance of perovskite devices.43 We utilized the Williamson–Hall plot to evaluate the stress in films,44 as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Larger stress was found in thermally annealed films compared with laser processed samples, and the stress in the films decreased with the laser scanning speed, consistent with the variation trend of the residual PbI2 content in the films. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between the strain and molecule interactions, we compared the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of FAMA perovskite films prepared under different conditions. Fig. 2a shows the XPS spectrum of Pb 4f, which has two peaks associated with the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 orbitals of divalent Pb2+ located at 137.9 and 142.7 eV, respectively.45,46 Compared with the thermally annealed films, the laser annealed films shift all of these peaks to higher binding energies. As the laser scanning speed decreases, the binding energy becomes higher. Similarly, the I 3d, C 1s and N 1s spectra have the same change pattern (Fig. 2a and Fig. S4, ESI†). These are due to the perovskite lattice contraction caused by laser shock annealing, and the lattice contraction leads to shorter Pb–I bonds and higher bond energies.47 In Fig. 2a and b, we found the presence of Pb0 and I0 components in the thermally annealed films. There was too much residual PbI2 in the thermally annealed films, which is easy to decompose into Pb0 and I0 under heating or illumination.48 Excessive Pb0 accumulates at the interface between the perovskite and FTO, forming a large number of interfacial defects, which can reduce the lifetime and collection of photogenerated carriers. The thickness of the residual PbI2 layer also influences the molecular interaction in perovskite films, and we employed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy to reveal the molecular interactions in the films. Fig. 2c shows the Raman spectrum of the FAMA films fabricated under different conditions. The peaks at 400 m–500 cm−1, 950–1050 cm−1 and 1350–1450 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum correspond to NCN bending, CN stretching and NH2 rocking, respectively.49 Compared with thermal annealing, the organic molecular interaction is enhanced with laser shock annealing. Moreover, the molecular interaction is enhanced with the increasing shock pressure (Fig. S5, ESI†). This trend has been particularly prominent on NCN bending, which is specific to the FA molecule, suggesting that FA combines with inorganic frameworks more tightly as the laser scanning speed decreases. Due to the lattice mismatch between the residual PbI2 and perovskite, the molecular interaction weakens when the residual PbI2 layer is too thick. The high resolution FTIR spectra (Fig. 2d) show that N–H stretching at 3200–3400 cm−1 exhibits a prominent red-shift, indicating that the hydrogen bond interaction increases with the decreasing thickness of residual PbI2, which is consistent with the Raman shift. Thus, the residual tensile strain in perovskite thin films can be released by laser shock annealing to control the molecular interaction during the synthesis of perovskite films and the thickness of residual PbI2.

2.3 Band structure modulation via molecular interactions
Molecular interactions have a direct effect on the orbital overlap, which is extremely important for energy level splitting. The ideal photoelectric conversion efficiency depends on the band structure. We utilize ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) to study the band structure changes. Fig. 3a and Fig. S7 (ESI†) show the bandgap (Eg) of the FAMA perovskite thin film obtained from Tauc curves, in which the bandgap of samples after TA, LS (500 mm s−1), LS (400 mm s−1), and LS (300 mm s−1) is 1.535 eV, 1.533 eV, 1.527 eV, and 1.52 eV, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra. Compared with the thermally annealed thin films, the PL peak of laser scanned thin films was redshifted, indicating the reduced optical bandgap. Moreover, the absence of a significant Stokes shift indicates a small energy loss. Interestingly, this variation pattern is consistent with that of the residual PbI2 layer thickness. The valence band maximum (VBM) of the FAMA films revealed from UPS is shown in Fig. 3c and Fig. S9 (ESI†). The VBM of TA was the largest in contrast to that of LS (300 mm s−1), exhibiting a decreased residual PbI2 content. The VBM gradually shifts downward 390 meV with the laser scanning speed reduced from 500 mm s−1 to 300 mm s−1, which is also consistent with Pb4f peak shifts, as shown in Fig. 2. The conduction band minimum (CBM) can be obtained from the equation CBM = Eg − VBM. The position of the CBM also decreases with the decrease of the residual PbI2 content, as shown in Fig. 3d. These are due to the interaction enhancement between organic cations and inorganic frameworks. An illustrative band structure map is shown in Fig. 3e. The semiconductor type of FAMA perovskite films was determined by the Fermi level and the CBM position. The films change to an n-type semiconductor for a lower laser scanning speed, with enhanced conductivity in the perovskite thin-films. This transition between the p-type and n-type semiconductors results from the orbital overlap, in which molecular interactions and strain play an important role.

2.4 Laser shock annealing induced changes in carrier dynamics of perovskite thin films
The band structure can directly affect the carrier dynamics resulting from residual PbI2 and strain release in FAMA perovskite films. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectrum was used to obtain information about carrier lifetimes, as shown in Fig. 4a. A slower PL decay was observed in laser annealed films. The decay curves were fitted with a biexponential function:50. The fast decay lifetime (τ1) was attributed to the nonradiative recombination caused by the trap state, while the slow decay lifetime (τ2) was attributed to the radiative recombination. Compared with thermal annealing, the τ1 and τ2 of laser annealing increase significantly (Fig. 4b). As the laser scanning speed was decreased from 500 mm s−1 to 400 mm s−1, both τ1 and τ2 kept increasing. When the scanning speed was further reduced to 300 mm s−1, the carrier lifetimes turn to decrease. With an optimal laser scanning speed of 400 mm s−1, the carrier lifetimes reached the maximum due to the optimal crystal morphology and a minimal amount of residual PbI2 was obtained. Too much PbI2 at the bottom in the TA and LS (500 mm s−1) processed thin films cause interface defects, which leads to a decrease of carrier lifetimes. The discontinuous morphology of LS (300 mm s−1) films forms surface defects, thereby reducing the carrier lifetimes. To investigate the influence of the thickness of the residual PbI2 layer on the carrier transport dynamics, the electronic characteristics of the FAMA perovskite films were characterised by hall measurement, as shown in Fig. 4c. The carrier density of the LS (400 mm s−1) processed film was the lowest, indicating that the carrier extraction rate reached the maximum, which was due to the appropriate amount of residual PbI2 at the bottom of the LS (400 mm s−1) films resulting in trap reduction. The residual PbI2 at the bottom of the TA and LS (500 mm s−1) films is too thick, hindering the electron charge transfer.51 The discontinuous morphology of the LS (300 mm s−1) processed film is also unfavorable for carrier extraction. Since the carrier density is inversely proportional to the carrier mobility as defined by the formula μ = 1/neρ,41 the carrier mobility reaches the maximum as the laser scanning speed is 400 mm s−1. The residual PbI2 also dramatically affects the series resistance, and it has been reported in a previous study that the residual PbI2 causes the resistance to increase.52 The series resistance is shown in Fig. 4d. It can be seen that the resistance decreases with the decreasing PbI2 content, and the resistance of the LS film (400 mm s−1) reaches the minimum. Further decreasing the scanning speed can reduce the content of residual PbI2, but it will lead to holes in the film and increase the resistance, which is not favorable to the device performance.

2.5 Performance and stability of laser shock annealing enhanced photodetectors
The mobility-lifetime (μτi) is an essential parameter of the device, and a large μτi ensures a high photocurrent and responsivity of the perovskite device. The μτi values were derived from the fitting photocurrent using the modified Hecht equation (Fig. 5a):41 (2)where I0 is the saturated photocurrent, L is the channel width, and V is the applied bias. The μτi values are summarized in Table 1, and the μτi reached a maximum at a laser scanning speed of 400 mm s−1. For the TA and LS (500 mm s−1) processed films, the residual PbI2 layer at the bottom of perovskite films causes interface defects that are detrimental to carrier transmission and collection, leading to a poor device performance. However, at a laser scanning speed of 300 mm s−1, high pulse laser energy can damage FAMA perovskite thin-films, resulting in decomposition. We also fabricated FAMA perovskite photodetectors to explore the effect of residual PbI2 on the device performance. Fig. 5b and c show the photocurrent under 355 nm laser illumination, and the corresponding dark current is shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). All the devices can repeatedly produce a stable photocurrent and a dark current output. Interestingly, the photocurrent first increases with the decrease of the residual PbI2 layer below FA0.95MA0.05PbI3 films. The photocurrent reaches the maximum when the laser scanning speed reaches 400 mm s−1. However, as the scanning speed decreases to 300 mm s−1, the pinholes in the perovskite film led to a smaller photocurrent, although the residual PbI2 continues to decrease. To further evaluate the photoelectric performance of the device, the responsivity (R) of photodetectors was calculated using the following formula:53,54 (3)(where P = 5 mW cm−2 and S = 1.2 × 10−3 cm2), and the detectivity (D*) was calculated by the following formula (4)(where Idark is the dark current, and q is the elementary charge). Similarly, for a laser scanning speed of 400 mm s−1, the responsivity and detectivity reach the maximum value of 2.45 A W−1 and 1.48 × 1012 Jones (Table 1), respectively. The improvement of carrier transport kinetics boosts the photocurrent in a perovskite thin-film photodetector by more than two times.

Stability is a major problem in the commercialization of perovskite devices. Many researchers have reported that excessive PbI2 in perovskite films is likely to induce film decomposition under high humidity or high temperature.26,27 Therefore, the influence of PbI2 on the film stability was investigated. First, a humid-heat stability test was conducted. The XRD patterns of the perovskite films thermally annealed at 150 °C for four hours, with around 80% relative humidity, are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). Then the intensity ratio between the peak of PbI2 and the peak of the perovskite (110) was calculated, representing the decomposition degree of the perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 5a. In the humid and hot environment, all the perovskite films showed certain degrees of decomposition, and the decomposition rate was positively correlated with the initial content of residual PbI2. After heating at 150 °C for four hours, the content of PbI2 in thermally annealed films exceeded the perovskite by an astonishing 1.6 times. In contrast, the decomposition degree of the LS (400 mm s−1) and LS (300 mm s−1) processed films is small due to the absence of residual PbI2 in perovskite films, which is consistent with the morphology shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, we used thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to analyze the thermal stability of films prepared under various conditions, as shown in Fig. 5b. With the decrease of the residual PbI2 content under the nitrogen atmosphere, the perovskite decomposition temperature of the films increased from 311 °C to 339 °C. Compared to the traditional thermal annealing, the PbI2 decomposition temperature of the perovskite film fabricated by laser scanning at 400 mm s−1 increased by more than 40 °C. These indicated that reducing the residual PbI2 content in the film can improve the thermal stability of the perovskite film, which is favorable to the device working under extreme environments.
3. Conclusion
We demonstrate a new method, nanosecond laser shock annealing in a two-step perovskite thin-film fabrication, by introducing ultrafast pressure and annealing simultaneously, resulting in dramatically improved stability and performance. In traditional thermal annealing after two-step perovskite thin-film fabrication, excessive thick layers of PbI2 at the bottom of the films cause interface defects, which reduce the carrier lifetimes, hinder the carrier transport, and impairs the device stability. We found that laser shock annealing leads to a reduced thickness of the residual PbI2 layer below the perovskite film due to the enhanced ultrafast diffusion and released tensile residual stress in perovskite thin films. Meanwhile, ultrafast shock annealing induces the band structure change in the perovskite as a result of enhanced molecular interactions, which can be modulated by controlling the PbI2 content to make the bandgap close to the theoretical optimal value. Besides, the band structure change of the perovskite film after laser processing leads to a more than two times enhancement in the photocurrent. The stability test result shows that the reduction of residual PbI2 and release of residual tensile strain can significantly improve the humid-thermal stability of the perovskite film. As a result, the decomposition temperature of the perovskite and PbI2 increases by more than 20 °C and 40 °C, respectively, indicating that releasing lattice strain in the perovskite can enhance its thermal stability.
