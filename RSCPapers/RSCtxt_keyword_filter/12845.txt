    , Accepted 12th October 2011First published on 2nd November 2011AbstractUsing a range of realistic interface geometries obtained from a molecular dynamics simulation we study the effects of different microscopic atomic arrangements on the electronic structure and charge transfer rates of the prototypical photovoltaic interface between P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) and PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester). The electronic structures of charge-transfer (CT) states belong to two groups that can be denoted as “charge-separated” and “charge-bridging” states. For the former group of structures, which may lead to fully separated charges, the ranges and the average values of internal reorganization energy, the electronic coupling and the charge separated states energy are evaluated. A range and distribution of absolute charge separation (CS) and recombination (CR) rates are computed using the Marcus–Levich–Jortner rate equation. Due to the variety of P3HT/PCBM interface structures, a very broad range of CS (7.7 × 109–1.8 × 1012 s−1) and CR (2.5 × 105–1.1 × 1010 s−1) “instantaneous” rates are computed. However, the energetic parameters affecting the rate evolve in time due to the dynamic nature of the interface with a characteristic timescale of about 10 ns. For this reason the slowest CR instantaneous rates are not observed and the minimum CR rate observed is determined by the rate of conformational rearrangement at the interface. The combination of these observations provides a more general framework for the interpretation of experimental spectroscopic data, suggesting that the analysis based on simple first order rates may be insufficient to describe charge transfer in organic solar cell interfaces.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been studied extensively in the past two decades due to their advantages such as low-cost, flexibility, and large area fabrication compared to the commercially available silicon solar cells.1–4 The improvement of OSCs power conversion efficiency (PCE), now just over 7%,5 is the main goal of OSC research, which is pursued through the development of new materials, new device fabrication and processing strategies and computer modeling from the atomic to the device scale. The most widely studied structure is a bulk heterojunction composed of a p-type donor, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a n-type acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with PCE over 5.5%,4,6–15 which has become the standard donor/acceptor system for understanding the elementary processes in OSCs both experimentally and theoretically.
The mechanism for conversion of light into electric power involves several key processes.3,4,16–18 Absorption of a photon by the donor material leads to the formation of a mobile exciton, which can diffuse to the donor/acceptor interface. Here a charge transfer (CT) state, where a Coulombically bound hole and electron are found on the donor and acceptor sides of the interface, is formed very rapidly and with high quantum efficiency. The opposite charges can overcome their mutual attraction forming free charges in the donor and acceptor or recombine via a geminate charge recombination process. Free charges will migrate to the electrodes where they are collected generating a photocurrent. Understanding the relation between the microscopic structure of the material and the elementary processes taking place therein is one of the fundamental goals of current OSC research and, in this paper, we consider the process of formation of the CT state (which we will denote for simplicity as a charge separation (CS) process—not to be confused with the formation of free charges) and the process of charge recombination (CR) of hole and electron at the interface. In particular we wish to analyze how the variability of the interface geometric and electronic structure influences these elementary rates.
Many experimental studies investigate the photoinduced CR and CS processes of various polymer:fullerene blends by using different kinds of transient absorption and fluorescence detection technologies.6,7,19–25 The charge transfer rates (kCS or kCR) reported by experimental studies are pseudo-first-order rate constants that implicitly include a number of interfacial structures with similar properties dominating the time dependent spectroscopic signatures.26–28 When the individual rates are very similar to one another the experimentally observed “ensemble” rate can be considered a representative average rate of the process. On the other hand, if the rates are very broadly distributed it is not easy to define a meaningful average value.24,29,30 Indeed, the donor/acceptor interface is far from uniform with potentially different excitation energies, charge transfer state energies, electronic coupling, etc., so that charge transfer rates are not constant of the material but must be described by appropriate statistical distributions. For instance, Xie et al. concluded that a variable charge transfer rate is due to multiple charge injection states of P3HT.24 Being able to estimate the variability of these rates is therefore essential to both improve the interpretation of the spectroscopic data and to increase the general accuracy of the model.
Computational studies have been carried out on several donor–acceptor model systems with different interesting focuses. Brédas and Cornil studied the charge separation and recombination rates of the phthalocyanine/perylene-tetracarboxylic-diimide solar cell using non-adiabatic electron transfer rate theories.30,31 They also investigated Pentacene/C60 and poly(p-phenylenevinylene)/C60 solar cells, finding that the electronic coupling decreased along with increasing separation between the donor and the acceptor, and charge transfer rates are strongly sensitive to the relative positions of the donor and acceptor.17,32 The interfacial charge-transfer mechanism of the P3HT/C60 heterojunction was elucidated by Kanai and Grossman using density functional theory (DFT), who found evidence of a charge-bridging state, i.e. a hybridization between the LUMO of P3HT and fullerene leading to an interface state with partial charge transfer characteristics.33 Lee et al. examined the dissociation into free charge of the CS state before its thermal relaxation (hot exciton dissociation) in P3HT/PCBM solar cells by comparing CT states generated from either excitons or direct photoexcitation.12 In ref. 34, we found that an unrestricted DFT method of the lowest triplet state can be used to describe, with good accuracy, the equilibrium energy and geometry of the CT state. Moreover, we also discussed the inaccuracy intrinsic in the evaluation of all quantities entering into the rate expression and the sensitivity of the computed rate to these quantities. It is generally acknowledged that it is important to investigate the effect of the mutual donor–acceptor geometric arrangement to evaluate correctly key parameters such as the electronic coupling (V), the reorganization energy (λ) and CT energy (ECT) entering into the expression of the rate constant. However, all of the quantum chemical (QC) calculations listed above are based on arbitrary (albeit very plausible) initial structures and, so far, QC studies on realistic polymer OSC interfaces have not been carried out.
Combined studies of the morphology and electronic structure of bulk P3HT or PCBM have been carried out in the recent years, showing that it is possible to go beyond electronic structure calculations of “idealized” materials.35–39 A natural step forward is the classical modeling of the interface structure of P3HT/PCBM, which provides an ideal starting point to study the relation between the interface atomic structure (and its variability) on the charge transfer rates at the interface. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the range of absolute CR and CS rates in a realistic P3HT/PCBM interface model using initial configurations of the interface from classical simulation, a quantum chemical (QC) evaluation of the relevant parameters, and non-adiabatic charge transfer rate theory40–42 for the evaluation of the rate constant. This procedure will quantify the effect of structural variability of the P3HT/PCBM interface on the interface charge transfer rates and will help the interpretation of the relevant spectroscopic data.
2. Model and methods
The interface structure of P3HT/PCBM was taken from selected snapshots of the MD simulation containing 160 PCBM molecules forming a side-on interface with a crystalline phase of P3HT (Fig. 1). The P3HT component consisted of 24 polymer chains arranged in four layers of six chains each. Each chain consisted of 20 thiophene rings. The system was originally set up in the so-called Type-I polymorph, the most stable polymorph of the polyalkylthiophenes;43,44 the spacing between the chains was 3.82 Å (intralayer) and 16.2 Å (interlayer), corresponding to the experimental crystal structure. For the PCBM the initial configuration being a layered, monoclinic crystal, with parameters a = 13.76 Å, b = 16.63 Å, c = 19.08 Å, and β = 105.3°, the structure reported by Rispens et al.45 The force field parameters for P3HT and PCBM are the same as used in previous works.36,46,47 The P3HT and PCBM boxes are initially equilibrated separately (for 1 ns); the PCBM box is resized to have the same cross-sectional area and then the two boxes are merged, with a gap of 4 Å between them. The orientation of the PCBM layers is chosen so that these lie approximately parallel to the P3HT chains; while other configurations of the interface are possible (and indeed are likely to occur in experimental systems), this is the simplest and the one most likely to be amenable to charge transfer. The study of other interface configurations is of course possible and desirable. The details of the force field and the MD simulation are given in the ESI† while further analysis of the classical trajectory will be presented elsewhere.48
 Fig. 1  Schematics of the procedure used in this paper to study the variability of the electronic structure at the interface. MD snapshots are used to extract the dimer structure of hexa-methylthiophene/PCBM which are investigated with detailed QC calculations. 
A number of smaller models containing an oligomer with 6 consecutive hexyl-thiophene rings34 and a single PCBM molecule were built from the MD snapshots to perform a number of QC calculations. For each PCBM molecule in a given snapshot, the closest distance (DP–P) with a P3MT atom in the simulation was identified. For distances shorter than 7 Å, the closest 6 thiophene rings were selected and the QC calculations were carried out on this model. This procedure leads to approximately 70 geometries per snapshot.
The model system was simplified by replacing the hexyl groups with the methyl group, as it was shown to have very similar frontier orbital levels and optical properties by the studies on Polymer/Fullerene and Polymer/Polymer.49,50 The energy of the interface model was calculated by using the B3LYP/6–31G* method following a constrained optimization in the gas phase at the B3LYP/3–21G level51,52 described below. Unconstrained optimization led to geometries of the oligomer–PCBM pair incompatible with the structure of the infinite polymer and the presence of the other polymers. We devised a constrained optimization that retains the relative position of the polymer and PCBM and the orientation of the side chain while allowing a relaxation of the conjugated backbone that takes place upon electron transfer. It is expected that the orientation of the side-chains position will not change much in the timescale of interfacial electron transfer (they are stabilized by the surrounding molecules—an extended discussion on the timescale of these conformational changes is given in the results section). To mimic the packing constraint imposed by the surrounding molecules (and the infinitely long polymer) the optimization was constrained by freezing the positions of the carbon atoms on the methyl and the terminal hydrogen atoms of the oligomer. We shall stress that, as we are more interested in the variation of parameters derived from electronic structure calculations than in their absolute values, the conclusions of this paper are unlikely to be too sensitive to the computational details.
In ref. 34, we have reported that the singlet and triplet excitation energies of P3MT/PCBM are essentially identical because of the negligible exchange interaction, so the triplet state geometry is assumed to be same as the singlet excited state. The lowest triplet excited state geometry can then be optimized by a relatively cheap UDFT method instead of other expensive ab initio methods (in the results section we show few cases where this approximation is not valid). We also verified that spin contamination,53,54 which is a major source of error in unrestricted calculations, is rather small in this case: the expectation value of the squared spin angular momentum 〈S2〉 is generally less than 2.01 for the triplet state. The singlet excitation energy of P3MT (Eex) was calculated by the TDDFT method.34,55,56
The theoretical and computational approach, briefly summarized below, is similar to that descried in ref. 34 where a thorough validation of all computational choices and their impact on the final rate are given. The charge transfer rate is computed from the Marcus–Levich–Jorner expression as:40–42 (1)where V is the electronic coupling between the initial and final states, λext is the external reorganization energy, Seff is the effective Huang–Rhys factor, ωeff is the frequency of one effective mode that incorporates in an average way the effect of all quantum modes, ΔG is the Gibbs free energy difference between initial and final states, KBT is the thermal energy, and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant. We have previously shown that setting external reorganization energy within the physically plausible range would modify the rate only by one order of magnitude, which is not to be considered a very large error in this context.34 Thus, 0.11 eV is used as a constant value for λext in this paper, estimated for a similar model system in ref. 34. The same paper also provides estimates of the effective frequency ωeff as 1500 cm−1 (0.186 eV), which is the same value used here since it is not expected to change with the mutual conformation of the donor and acceptor.34 In this paper we are interested in the parameters that are more likely to change with the interface geometry namely the Gibbs free energies of charge separation and recombination (ΔGCS, ΔGCR), the electronic coupling for the same processes (VCS, VCR) and the internal component of the reorganization energy (λint).
The Gibbs free energy differences were calculated as follows ΔGCR = EP3MT0/PCBM0 − ECT(2) ΔGCS = ECT − EP3MT*/PCBM0(3)EP3MT0/PCBM0 and EP3MT*/PCBM0 are the energies of the neutral molecule model, calculated from the isolated P3MT and PCBM molecules, before and after the excitation of P3MT (computed with TDDFT).
The internal reorganization energy of a charge transfer reaction leading from a neutral to a CT state is defined as57 (4)where E0/CT is the energy of the neutral (CT) state computed in the equilibrium geometry of the neutral (CT) system;  is the energy of the neutral (CT) state computed in the equilibrium geometry of the CT (neutral) state. When a single effective mode is used, as in eqn (1), the internal reorganization energy is related to the effective Huang–Rhys factor simply as Seff = λint/ℏωeff. The computation of the terms appearing in eqn (4) is performed fully quantum mechanically using the same geometry constraints used for the calculation of the optimized geometry. The details of the calculation including the methods used for calculation are given in ref. 34.
The electronic coupling between the relevant states is approximated with the electronic coupling between the two orbitals which exchange an electron. The orbital coupling Vij between the orbitals ϕi and ϕj of the isolated fragments is defined as 〈ϕj|0|ϕi〉, where 0 is the Kohn–Sham–Fock operator of the total system evaluated by assuming the density matrix of the isolated fragments.58
The electronic coupling in the charge separation process (VCS) is the coupling between the LUMOs of P3MT and PCBM. When we calculated the individual charge separation rate for every single selected geometry, parameter VCS was taken to be the square root of the sum of the squared coupling between LUMOP3HT and LUMOPCBM and between LUMOP3HT and LUMO + 1PCBM, because the LUMO + 1 and LUMO of PCBM have almost the same orbital energy (their energy difference is less than 0.05 eV while LUMO + 2 is 0.22 eV higher than the LUMO and not included in the calculation). The electron on higher energy orbitals will relax to the LUMO of PCBM much faster than the charge recombination process, so that the electronic coupling in the charge recombination process (VCR) is the coupling between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. All of the quantum chemical calculations of this paper were completed by using Gaussian 03.59
3. Results and discussion
Electronic coupling
The electronic coupling was computed for 70 geometries per MD snapshot for three MD snapshots (at simulation time equal to 0.5, 5.5 and 9.5 ns after equilibration). Fig. 2a shows that the absolute values of VCR/CS expectedly decrease with the increase of DP–P (Yi32 also obtained the same conclusion by studying pentacene/C60), but the trend is very noisy due to the sensitivity of the coupling to small geometric changes with departures from the best exponential fit of more than an order of magnitude.60,61 Very importantly, we also found that there is very little correlation between the electronic coupling computed for the same donor–acceptor pair for the snapshots at 0.5 and 5.5 ns as illustrated in Fig. 2b. After 5 ns of simulation the coupling changes typically by one order of magnitude (note the log–log scale used). The residual correlation is due to the fact that the polymer chains that were closer to PCBM remain closer (with slightly larger coupling) and those more far apart remain far apart (with smaller couplings than average). The fact that the electronic coupling pattern is completely changed in few nanoseconds is largely expected as it is now well documented that also thermal vibrations around the equilibrium position in the molecular crystal cause very large fluctuation of the intermolecular coupling with much shorter timescales (picoseconds).60,61

(■) represents VCR points, () represents VCS points. 
In one of the analyses presented below we evaluated an “average rate” using an appropriate electronic coupling averaged over all the different considered structures (we will also present instantaneous rates without averaging). The average value of n different coupling Vn is defined as . As discussed more extensively in ref. 60 and 62 using averaged coupling in non-adiabatic rate formulas is correct as long as the nuclear motions that cause the fluctuation of the coupling have characteristic energies much smaller than the barrier for the charge transfer. Meaningful averages can be defined only if one also defines a maximum distance DP–P of the geometries to be included in the averaging procedure. For example the average VCS and VCR are 23.0 and 20.0 meV, if the geometries with DP–P less than 7.0 Å are considered, or 32.0 and 31.0 meV, respectively, if the geometries with DP–P smaller than 4.5 Å are considered. The distribution of the electronic coupling is shown by Fig. 2c.
Charge separated state and charge bridging state
The next step is to calculate λint and ΔG at the B3LYP/6–31G* level for a sufficiently representative set of structures. The structures selected with the criterion DP–P < 7.0 Å are simply too many for the QC calculations required. We considered preliminarily 9 random geometries from the snapshot at 9.5 ns (whose details are given in the ESI†) and we studied them in some details. This study provided a useful criterion for selecting additional structures to obtain a better statistics.
Depending on the starting geometries, we observed two different types of lowest energy triplet states (our model of the CS state), as illustrated in Fig. 3. The singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMO1) with lower energy are always localized on P3MT. However the SOMO2 with higher energy may have different characteristics. In a sub-set of systems, denoted as Group 1, the SOMO2 is almost fully localized on PCBM, i.e. the triplet state is a conventional CT state which may lead to fully separated charges. In another sub-set of systems, denoted as Group 2, the SOMO2 is mainly localized on P3MT with a small component on PCBM (this is illustrated graphically in Fig. 3 and is shown quantitatively from the orbital density population analysis). The Group 2 structures are essentially identical to the charge-bridging state described by Kanai and Grossman.33
 Fig. 3  The singly occupied orbitals of P3MT/PCBM models belonging to Groups 1 (top) and 2 (bottom) in the lowest energy triplet state obtained by the UB3LYP/6–31G* method. Left (right) orbitals represent the lower (higher) singly occupied orbital. The lowest energy triplet of models belonging to Group 1 has a clear charge separated character unlike models belonging to Group 2. 

Fig. 4 summarizes more quantitatively the differences between the electronic structure and properties of the two groups of molecules. Panel (a) shows for example that the spin density of PCBM of Group 1 is more than 1.8, while that of Group 2 is less than 0.2. By comparing the energy of the P3MT/PCBM triplet state (T1), we found that T1 of Group 1 is always larger than 1.66 eV, but T1 of Group 2 is always smaller than 1.33 eV, as shown in Fig. 4b. Additionally, we found that the energy gap between the ground and triplet states (ΔE) of P3MT of Group 1 is larger than 1.60 eV, while those of Group 2 are smaller than 1.50 eV (we show below that this is due to the greater planarity of molecules in Group 2). Fig. 4c shows that the geometries belonging to Group 1 have lower λint (lower than 0.28 eV) than Group 2 (larger than 0.32 eV). Incidentally, we note that the good agreement with the experimental excitation energy, considering the lack of environmental effects in our calculation, could have been helped by some cancellation of errors.

(d) The average dihedral angle between two neighboring thiophene rings of P3MT. 
This preliminary investigation has important consequences. First of all, the report of charge-bridging states33,63 not observed in all computational work32,34,49,64 can be due to geometric differences as both charge-bridging and charge-transfer states are likely present at the interface. Secondly, it would be incorrect to average out the parameters computed for two very different sets of systems. As we are interested mainly in the elementary processes that ultimately lead to charge separation we will continue this study by selecting only model structures belonging to Group 1, with the charge-transfer state, to calculate the charge transfer rate within our molecular models. It is possible that also the charge-bridging states of Group 2 evolve toward more charge separated states but that may only happen in the presence of additional molecules and polymer chains which we cannot include in the present modeling protocol. It should be also noted that the assumption that the exchange interaction is negligible, making the lowest triplet state isoenergetic with the CT state, is only valid for Group 1.
Graphical inspection of the P3MT structures considered above (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†) suggests that the geometries in Group 2 are more planar than those in Group 1. More quantitatively, we computed the average (absolute value) of five dihedral angles between neighboring thiophene rings and found that this is larger than 26° for Group 1 and smaller than 24° for Group 2 (Fig. 4d). This simple geometric criterion can be used to select a subset of structures that are very likely belonging to Group 1.
Energy parameters and rate distributions
To better evaluate the possible range of ΔGCS/CR and λint that can be found in a realistic interface, a total of 15 geometries of a P3MT hexamer and a PCBM, belonging to Group 1, have been extracted from a single snapshot (t = 9.5 ns) of the MD simulation. The geometric criterion that the average absolute values of the inter-dihedral angles have to be larger than 26° was used to select structures belonging to Group 1 (this was successively verified for each structure).

Fig. 5 shows the computed λint, Eex, ΔGCR/CS, VCR/CS, and kCR/CSversus the corresponding donor–acceptor distance DP–P. Although there is no obvious trend for these parameters as a function of DP–P, this representation provides at a glance the range and distribution of these quantities in realistic interfaces. The parameters entering into the rate expression can be discussed in terms of their average and standard deviation. A larger than expected variance of λint = 0.18 ± 0.08 eV was observed (it modulates substantially the computed rate as it enters in the rate eqn (1)via Seff = λint/ωeff). The variation of the free energy of charge recombination ΔGCR = −1.60 ± 0.12 eV and charge separation ΔGCS = −0.98 ± 0.32 eV is also large while falling within the values suggested in the experiment.18,65–67 The variation of these parameters is partially due to the different degrees of planarity of the oligomer (which causes the excitation energies of P3MT to vary between 2.30 and 2.80 eV), but also the different electrostatic interactions between the charged fragments in the charge transfer state.68 The average values of VCR (electronic coupling of HOMO–LUMO) and VCS (electronic coupling of LUMO–LUMO and LUMO–LUMO + 1), shown in Fig. 5, are 21.5 and 32.3 meV, i.e. of the expected order of magnitude and with the usual large distribution of values due to the extreme sensitivity of the coupling to the relative position of donor and acceptor.

(○) represents a CS process, (●) represents a CR process, (■) represents the excitation energy of P3MT. 
Considering that the relation between these parameters and the computed rates is not simple and that the variability of the computed rate cannot be ascribed to the variability of a single parameter, we also present the variation of kCS and kCR as functions of ΔGCS/CR and λint assuming that other parameters adopt their average values. Fig. 6 shows that kCR/CS increases as ΔGCR/CS becomes less negative, which is similar to the results presented in ref. 34 without averaging. Fig. 7 shows that the charge transfer rates will increase by about one order of magnitude when λint increases by about 0.1 eV. Fig. 6 and 7 show that the average values of charge separation and recombination rates are 2.6 × 1011 s−1 and 2.1 × 108 s−1, which indicate that the calculated ranges of kCR/CS obtained by the MD/QC procedure are consistent with and closer to the experimental values and ranges6,9,10,25,69 than those obtained just by the QC method on the model built manually by chemical intuition.34 The range of average calculated rates in Fig. 6 and 7 is evaluated by keeping all parameters fixed to their average except ΔGCR/CS and λint, respectively, for which the computed range of values was considered. For this reason these ranges are different in the two figures and it is possible to see (Fig. 7) that the large variation of computed values of λint is mainly responsible for the spread of the value of kCS.

(■) represents the average values of Log(kCS/kCR) calculated by the average value of λint. The experimental range of rates is also shown, while the calculated rate range used in this figure is defined in the text. 
Of course, the rates computed with average parameters are not the same as the average rate since the rate expression is highly non-linear. Moreover, as discussed in the next section, it is far from obvious that an “average rate” even has a specific physical meaning. Using the data for the 15 structures considered we can define instantaneous rates, i.e. the rate that would be measured if the structure of the interface did not change in time (more precisely if it changes more slowly than the charge transfer rate). These instantaneous rates are computed by substituting the parameters computed for each of these 15 geometries into the rate equation to calculate 15 pairs of charge separation and recombination rates (kCS and kCR), shown in Fig. 5d. The ranges of computed kCR and kCS are 2.5 × 105 s−1–1.1 × 1010 s−1 and 7.7 × 109 s−1–1.8 × 1012 s−1 respectively. Before examining the significance of this distribution for the experiments it is convenient to discuss an interesting correlation observed for these rates.

Fig. 8 represents the computed log of the CS and CR rate constants versus the corresponding λint. There is virtually no correlation for the CS rate (which also varies only within two orders of magnitude), while the decrease of the CR rate with the decrease of λint seems rather evident (and the rates span 5 orders of magnitude). The greater sensitivity of the CR rate to this parameter is already evident from Fig. 7 where the slope of Log(kCR) (16.3) is about two times larger than the slope of Log(kCS) (8.3) versus λint. The correlation between Log(kCS) and λint is further weakened by larger fluctuation of ΔGCS with respect to ΔGCR, due to the large fluctuations of the excitation in energy (Fig. 5b). Moreover, we have noticed some correlation between the larger value of λint and more negative values of ΔGCS (results not shown), two parameters having an opposite effect on the computed CS rates (see Fig. 6 and 7), which therefore appear to be almost constant when plotted versus λint. The results above may have an important experimental consequence: it is possible to decrease considerably the charge recombination rate while keeping the charge separation rate almost constant by decreasing the internal reorganization energy, for example by considering more rigid polymers.

Effect on the experimentally measured rate
When one measures the concentration decay C(t) of a species when the decay rate is not a constant k but it is distributed according to a probability P(k), the observed decay follows the non-exponential law70 (5)Alternatively, when there is a single time dependent rate k(t) the process is also non-exponential and follows the law (6)In general, a disordered system mainly contains a distribution of time dependent rates. When the fluctuation of the rate is very fast compared with the average lifetime, the “regular” exponential decay is recovered (7)where 〈k〉 denotes a time average of the time dependent rates.
To establish what is the effect of the rate distribution on the experimentally observable time decay we should then compute how rapidly the instantaneous charge transfer rates vary because of nuclear dynamics. The variability of the rates has two very different origins with different characteristic timescales. The large fluctuations of the intermolecular couplings are very fast, due to equilibrium oscillations of the nuclei occurring at a timescale of 10−12 s, as revealed by studies on many different systems.60,61 The characteristic time of the fluctuations of the energetic parameters (λint and ΔG) is expected to be slower, because of conformational changes at the interface, and more difficult to evaluate. A useful estimate can be obtained by recomputing λint, ΔGCR and kCR for the same systems starting from MD snapshots separated by a time interval. Fig. 9a shows kCRvs. λint for 5 systems analyzed before and after 9 ns (two example geometries at 0.5 ns and 9.5 ns are given in Fig. 9b and c). The data points move considerably on the graph in the timeframe suggesting that several nanoseconds is the time it takes for the system to explore new local conformations with different characteristic energy parameters entering into the rates. While this is only a rough estimate, it is sufficient to describe the effect of the interface variability on the measured rates.

The ultrafast CS process is not affected by conformational changes of the interface and the rate distribution will reflect the instantaneous conformation of the polymer at the interface. As these rates are among the fastest measurable, any non-exponential time decay will be more difficult to identify because of the possible role of fast fluctuations of the intermolecular electronic coupling. The CR process is typically much slower than the fluctuations of the intermolecular electronic coupling, which can be then averaged out, but it cannot be decoupled from the conformational variations of the interface. In fact, while the instantaneous CR rate spans a very broad range of values (from 105 to 1010 s−1) the timescale for conformational changes at the interface is about 108 s−1. If the system is in a conformation that allows a fast charge recombination rate (>109 s−1) the charge recombination with that rate is what will be observed. In contrast, if the system is in a conformation that allows only a slow recombination rate (<107 s−1) the system will explore sufficient conformations within ∼10−8 s to reach a conformation when the charge recombination is faster than the conformational change. The observed rate will be the rate of conformational changes not the electron transfer rate and this brings our computational results perfectly in line with the experimental data.6,9,69 The mechanism described above is very well studied in biological electron transfer and often referred to as conformationally gated electron transfer.71–73 The overall picture emerging from this study may also explain the unusually large range of experimental data found for this process.6,9
4. Conclusion
In this work, we have studied the effects of the structural variability on the electronic structures, charge separation and recombination rates, and the parameters related to the charge transfer rates by quantum chemical calculation. Because the interface of P3HT/PCBM is highly non-uniform we carried out the quantum chemical calculations based on the molecular dynamic simulation results of the P3HT/PCBM interface. We found, as we expected from the existing literature, large variation of the intermolecular coupling among the different structures considered but a number of additional findings are more surprising and may impact the interpretation of past and future experiments on this prototypical photovoltaic interface.
1. We are able to explain why some groups report the existence of charge bridging states at the interface33,63 and some others do not.32,34,49,64 We have found that all the interface geometries can be divided into two groups (we name them as Groups 1 and 2) with distinct energetic and geometric characteristics. The first group supports charge transfer states with complete charge separation while the second one supports charge bridging states. The photophysics in the two cases is expected to be different.
2. We have evaluated the range of free energy variations and internal reorganization energy for charge separation and recombination at the interface. They are somewhat larger than expected and lead to a very broad range of “instantaneous” rates for charge separation and recombination.
3. The analysis of the rate distribution with the system parameter indicates a significant correlation between λint and Log(kCR) which is not present for the charge separation process. Very importantly for the development of photovoltaic materials, we find that the reduction of the internal reorganization energy may help reducing the (unwanted) charge recombination while leaving the charge separation rate almost unchanged.
4. Generally speaking, in the presence of a large distribution of rates one expects to measure a non-exponential concentration decay. However, given the distribution and the timescale for the variation of the rate we expect this non-exponential behavior to be more difficult to identify for the ultrafast CS process. The situation for the CR rate is much more interesting. Instantaneous rates are computed to be in a very broad range (105–1010 s−1) but the interface conformation changes explore this range in a timescale of few nanoseconds. It is therefore not possible to measure rates lower than 108 s−1 which bring all rates computed in this work in line with the experimentally reported range of rates (108–1010 s−1).
One of the great advantages of using computational modeling to understand complicated systems is that it is possible to construct idealized models to study the different effects in isolation. Here a classical model of the interface and the quantum chemical calculation of a subsystem have been used to study the variability of several key parameters for the study of elementary processes but, of course, the full model of the photovoltaic interface is more complex than that. Elements that we have neglected and featured in several recent publications include the interface electrostatics,74,75 the possibility of long range electron transfer from an exciton far from the interface,48 the possible role of clusters of acceptor states,76 the coherence effect typical of ultrafast phenomena,44etc. We believe it is still not advisable, given our still limited level of understanding of these interfaces, to attempt an all-encompassing study incorporating all that is known. Fortunately, as most of the results of this paper are concerned just with the variation of the interface parameters they are unlikely to be affected by many of the improvements listed above or yet to be devised. For example, the electrostatic effect at the interface may shift the energy levels (changing the energetics of the electron transfer process) or cause further spread in the electron transfer parameters (increasing their standard deviation) but they are unlikely to reduce the structural variability of the interface as described in this paper.
It is hoped that, with a more precise idea of the variation expected for the interface charge transfer rates, a more detailed interpretation of the time dependent spectroscopic measurements can be sought, leading to a better understanding of the overall device functioning.
