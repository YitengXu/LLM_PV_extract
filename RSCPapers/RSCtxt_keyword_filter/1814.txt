    , Accepted 11th April 2022First published on 11th April 2022AbstractTo date, the most efficient PSCs use lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide/oxygen p-doped organic semiconductors as hole-transporting layers (HTL), which are often prone to unsatisfactory reproducibility and long-term instability. Herein, we report a new p-doping strategy for a wide range of small-molecular and polymeric organic semiconductors with free radicals that enable reproducible enhancement in the conductivity and tuning of the work function. We explored the doping mechanism and found that the free-radical initiator benzoyl peroxide promotes the generation of chlorine radicals from 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, which steadily oxidizes organic semiconductors. With a fine tuning of the counter ions, we achieved an efficiency of 21.1% for small-area (0.16 cm2) PSCs and 16.8% for larger-area (10 cm2) modules. Moreover, the solar cells showed significantly enhanced stability against thermal and humidity stress, which we attribute to the use of pure HTLs devoid of doping by-products and other impurities.
Introduction
With global energy demand projected to grow nearly 50% by 2040, it is imperative to divert from traditional fossil-fuel-based power production toward renewable energy sources such as solar. In the last decade, metal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been the front runner among emerging next-generation photovoltaic technologies to achieve better and cheaper alternative energy. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% has been achieved1 due to the uniquely favorable photoelectronic properties of the metal-halide perovskite materials, such as tunable bandgaps,2 high absorption coefficients,3 and long carrier diffusion lengths.4
Most high-performance PSCs have a sandwich n-i-p structure composed of a perovskite active absorber between an inorganic electron transporting layer (ETL) and an organic hole transporting layer (HTL).5 Because high-quality perovskite and ETLs can be obtained from various processing methodologies, HTLs are currently considered to be one of the critical components, which optimization will enable further improvements in the PSC performance and stability. At present, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), and polytriarylamine (PTAA) are dominant p-type organic semiconductors (OSCs) used as HTLs in high efficiency PSCs.6 However, the charge carrier mobility and intrinsic conductivity of these OSCs are quite low due to their triangular pyramid configuration, large intermolecular distance, or other factors.7–9 P-doping is indispensable for these OSCs to improve the electronic properties and obtain high device performance.
Depending on the mechanism of how host molecules are oxidized to produce free carriers, the chemical doping of OSCs can be classified into two major modes: (i) charge transfer and (ii) acid–base doping.10 Mode (i) can be further classified into the integer charge transfer and ground-state charge-transfer complex according to the degree of charge transfer between donor and acceptor.11 For example, polymer semiconductor poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) can be doped by molecular π-electron acceptors such as tetracyano-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) or strong Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane.12 An electron is fully transferred from the π-electron system of a P3HT onto the F4-TCNQ or tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane acceptor, resulting in positively charged P3HT and negatively charged F4-TCNQ or tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane. This typical case of integer charge transfer process leads to a strong increase of the mobile charge carrier density and the electrical conductivity in the P3HT layers. On the contrary, the number of charges transferred from the host to the guest is less than one in the charge-transfer complex mode. For pentacene doped with F4-TCNQ, a ground state charge transfer complex with a reduced energy gap between a doubly occupied bonding and an unoccupied antibonding hybrid orbital is formed due to a frontier molecular orbital hybridization between the pentacene highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lower unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of F4-TCNQ.13 A typical example of the acid–base doping mode is protonation of polyaniline upon reaction with a suitable acid; no charge transfer process happens between the host and guest in this case. The proton of the acid enters the main chain of the polyaniline, then the positive charge on the proton delocalizes in the conjugate main chain, while the corresponding anions enter the host materials to compensate for the excess positive charge.14
When OSCs are used as HTL in PSCs, an intense mixing process is performed to disperse the dopant molecules as uniformly as possible before thin film deposition. However, additives such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) have low solubility in non-polar solvents, which are commonly used for the preparation of HTL solutions. Additive with strong polarity such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) is used to improve the solubility of LiTFSI, preventing the phase separation of polar dopants and improving the interfacial contact.15,16 Taking spiro-OMeTAD as a prominent example of an OSC that dominates the highest efficiency (>24%) PSCs reports,17 the oxidation of the semiconductor molecule by O2 promoted by LiTFSI presents a two-step redox process, as shown in eqn (1) and (2).18,19 Spiro-OMeTAD + O2 → spiro-OMeTAD˙+O2˙−(1) Spiro-OMeTAD˙+O2˙− + LiTFSI → spiro-OMeTAD˙+TFSI− + LixOy(2)
However, this traditional doping method is subject to a range of problems leading to the PSC device instability. First, the highly hygroscopic lithium salt tends to absorb moisture from the atmosphere, which affects the morphology of the HTL and the interfacial adhesion between the HTL and perovskite, causing irreversible degradation of the latter.20,21 Second, Lamberti et al. found that tBP causes reorganization of the spiro-OMeTAD molecules, which is an irreversible de-doping process that detrimentally impacts the long-term conservation of spiro-OMeTAD structural and electrical properties.22 Third, tBP has a not very high boiling point of ∼200 °C and tends to evaporate over time, resulting in additional damage to the HTL.23 Forth, Zhen et al. reported that the Li ions initially present in the spiro-OMeTAD layer can migrate across the perovskite and accumulate in the ETL, which produces a pronounced hysteresis in the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves and accelerates the degradation of PSCs.24 Last, Li et al. found that tBP can corrode the perovskite layer via an interaction with PbI2 and form PbI2·x[tBP].25 All of these factors have adverse effect on the efficiency and stability of PSCs.
To tackle these issues, researchers have been actively looking for alternative ways to dope the HTLs for PSCs. Taylor and colleagues introduced a new doping technique for HTLs consisting of bubbling a solution of spiro-OMeTAD with carbon dioxide (CO2) under ultraviolet (UV) light.26 This approach was reported to greatly accelerate the p-doping process and allow for fast and reproducible fabrication of PSCs with high efficiency. More importantly, it reduced the lithium ion concentration in the HTL because the by-product of the doping reaction, Li2CO3 salts, precipitated readily from the solution and could be easily removed by filtration; thus, more stable performance was observed in comparison with the conventional HTL. Very recently, Sakai et al. proposed a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-adduct-based p-doping strategy for OSCs. They have shown that asymmetric p-doping is possible using solution processing routes using DMSO – HBr adducts.27 In our previous work, we found that the chorine radical released from pentachloroethane can p-dope the spiro-OMeTAD. Without using LiTFSI or tBP, the solar cells showed a stabilized PCE of 16.1% and greatly enhanced thermal stability in air.28 According to the principles of OSC doping that we described earlier, charge transfer complex is formed between electron acceptor and donor, such as spiro-OMeTAD˙+Cl− polaron. Therefore, we speculate that highly reactive electron-deficient radicals can obtain electron from OSC and carry out p-type doping of OSC.
In the present work, we report a new doping strategy using free radicals as p-dopants for a range of organic semiconductors to enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs. We found that the benzoyl peroxide (BPO) can promote the generation of chloride radical from 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TeCA) to efficiently p-dope OSCs. The doping process is extremely clean as there is no volatile by-products and unreacted doping agents left in the thin film. Furthermore, we found that an exchange of the counterion by introducing larger size organic ionic compounds can further promote the asymmetric p-doping of spiro-OMeTAD. Building upon this knowledge, we present the advantages of the radical doping process in fabricating highly efficient and stable PSCs and modules.
Results and discussion
To demonstrate the p-doping effect of the benzoyl peroxide (BPO) + 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TeCA) agents, several organic semiconductors commonly used to produce HTLs in high efficiency PSCs were examined, focusing on their solutions first. Chemical structures of the selected OSCs are shown in Fig. 1a, and the structures of TeCA and BPO are shown in Fig. S1.†Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra and photographs of the OSC solutions before and after the addition of the doping agent. We observed absorption features that correspond to the oxidized organic molecules after the addition of the BPO into the solutions of all examined compounds.18,29–31

Further, we focused on spiro-OMeTAD – a small molecular OSC dominating the efficiency records of PSCs17,26 – for deeper investigation of the doping process. Spiro-OMeTAD dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) produces a sole strong characteristic absorption peak at 390 nm (Fig. 1c). In contrast, when dissolved in TeCA, the intensity of the absorption peak at 390 nm decreased together with a rise of the absorption band at 528 nm corresponding to spiro-OMeTAD˙+ cation radical.18,32 This effect is further enhanced by the addition of BPO (Fig. 1c). This result demonstrates the p-doping capability of the proposed agents.33 To achieve significant levels of oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD, irradiation of the solution under 100 mW cm−2 simulated light was applied. After only 50 s, the oxidation efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD with TeCA only, reached 46% (calculated as a molar ratio between the oxidized fraction to the initial concentration) (Fig. 1c and S2†). In the presence of BPO, the oxidation efficiency increased to 56% after the same short period of stabilization. Importantly, adding BPO to CB solution also causes the emergence of the absorption peak at 528 nm, i.e. the oxidized spiro-OMeTAD signal, but the oxidation efficiency is very low (less than ca. 2%) even after 80 s of irradiation. These results demonstrate that TeCA and BPO act together as p-dopants, and the use of the former as a solvent is critically important.34 In addition, we tested the effect of irradiation intensity on the doping process. The evolution of the UV-Vis absorption spectra spiro-OMeTAD solutions under the ambient light (1.4 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S3.† We found that the oxidation saturation time was extended to 3 h under low intensity, and the oxidation efficiency was reduced to 28%.
Conductivity (σ) of different HTLs was measured using interdigitated gold microelectrodes arrays (IDAs), shown in Fig. 1d and S4†.35,36 The conductivity of a pristine spiro-OMeTAD film produced using CB as solvent (hereinafter, CB-S) was 8.6 × 10−8 S cm−1, and increased to 1.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 upon the conventional p-doping procedure, i.e. by adding LiTFSI, tBP, a cobalt complex and exposing to air (hereinafter, CB-doped-S). These values of conductivity for pristine and LiTFSI-doped spiro-OMeTAD are in good agreement with the literature.37,38 When using TeCA as a solvent and irradiating the spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution for 50 s under 1 sun (TeCA-S), the conductivity is improved by 2 orders of magnitude in comparison with the CB-S films, reaching a value to 8.7 × 10−6 S cm−1. Addition of 30 mol% (hereinafter, with respect to spiro-OMeTAD concentration) of BPO, results in σ = 9.2 × 10−5 S cm−1. As shown in Fig. 1d, the conductivity shows steady enhancement with the amount of BPO added until reaching the maximum of 1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 90 mol% (TeCA-BPO-S).
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to determine the ionization potential of the spiro-OMeTAD films doped using different approaches. Fig. 1e and S5† show the UPS data with corresponding cut-off binding energy (Ecut-off) and the Fermi edge (EF-edge).20,39,40 The EVB of the CB-S, TeCA-S and TeCA-BPO-S samples were calculated as −4.86, −4.92 and −4.96 eV, respectively. The EVB measured for the perovskite Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16PbBr0.51I2.49 (FA+ = CH(NH2)2+, MA+ = CH3NH3+) film used herein for the fabrication of PSCs (vide infra) was −5.38 eV, which thermodynamically allows an efficient hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTL. Overall, effective p-doping of spiro-OMeTAD using TeCA and BPO under 1 sun irradiation was collectively confirmed by changes to the UV-Vis spectra, significantly increased conductivity and corresponding shifts in the valence band edge levels.27
Mechanism of p-doping
To obtain deeper insights into the doping mechanism, we performed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis of the spiro-OMeTAD precursor solutions, as well as the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis of the corresponding HTLs. According to the data shown in Fig. 2a, solutions in pure chlorobenzene exhibit a negligible EPR signal, i.e. no radicals are present. In contrast, solutions in TeCA give rise to a weak but obvious symmetrical signal, which is obvious evidence of efficient charge transfer between spiro-OMeTAD and chlorine free radicals.22,41 Moreover, addition of BPO significantly enhances this signal, attesting to the important role of the latter in generating radical species. This result indicates more radicals were produced, which is consistent with the enhanced levels of oxidation induced by the presence of BPO (Fig. 1c).

(c) Comparison of the mechanisms of conventional oxidation p-doping and free radical doping process proposed herein. 
Previously, Sun et al. proposed that the TeCA is able to oxidize spiro-OMeTAD by forming a stable organic matrix spiro-OMeTAD˙+Cl− upon UV-light irradiation.42 As shown in Fig. 2b and S6,† XPS results confirm the existence of chlorine in both TeCA-S and TeCA-BPO-S films, though with a significantly more pronounced signal in the latter case. The increased concentration of chlorine species in TeCA-BPO-S demonstrates that the presence of BPO promotes the release of Cl˙ radicals from TeCA. Finally, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analysis was conducted to study the composition of the deposited spiro-OMeTAD films, which were digested in d6-DMSO together with the perovskite layer from the FTO|SnO2|perovskite|HTL samples (Fig. S7 and S8†). Apart from the signals from the FA+ and MA+ components of the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD,28,34 no signals associated with BPO or products of its decomposition were detected in the spectra of the solution derived from the TeCA-BPO-S sample films prepared with the addition of as much as 90 mol% BPO. No signals of TeCA were detected either. Thus, the employed fabrication procedure allows for complete elimination of BPO and products of its decomposition, leaving a pure spiro-OMeTAD film with undetectable amount of the dopant-related impurities.
Based on the results summarized above, we propose a mechanism of the photochemical doping of spiro-OMeTAD with TeCA and BPO and compare it to the conventional process in Fig. 2c. In the latter case, p-doping is initiated by exposing a pristine spiro-OMeTAD + LiTFSI: tBP film to air and light (eqn (1) and (2)). Oxygen oxidizes spiro-OMeTAD while LiTFSI mediates the reaction between O2 and the OSC under illumination, producing a TFSI-stabilized radical cation along with lithium oxides.43 The lithium oxides as well as the tBP are left in the film as by-products, which are detrimental to the stability of the solar cells.17 In the TeCA + BPO doping process, spiro-OMeTAD reacts with chlorine radical which is released from TeCA and converted into trichloroethyl radical (TCA˙).44 TCA˙ reacts with BPO by forming volatile by-products such as carbon dioxide, benzene and dichloroacetylene, which escape from the film and push the reaction forward. As a result, a clean HTM film forms from only pristine spiro-OMeTAD and spiro-OMeTAD˙+Cl− pair without any by-products (Fig. 2c).
Properties of the HTL films
The morphology of HTL film is important to the performance of solar cells. The top view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the spiro-OMeTAD films with different dopants are displayed in Fig. 3a. All samples exhibit uniform and complete coverage on the perovskite layer, demonstrating that the dopants have no direct effect on the morphology of the HTL. Atomic force microscopic (AFM) analysis (Fig. S9†) demonstrates a significantly reduced root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the TeCA-BPO-S film as compared to the perovskite film (2.6 vs. 17.8 nm). The reduction of the roughness of the surface indicates full coverage of the perovskite layer with HTL, consistent with the SEM analysis.

(d–f) Time-resolved confocal PL lifetime maps (d) as-deposited perovskite film, perovskite covered with (e) TeCA-S or (f) TeCA-BPO-S (90 mol% BPO). 
To study the charge transfer dynamics between differently doped HTLs and perovskite, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded. All examined films display qualitatively similar PL spectral profiles with a maximum at around 772 nm (Fig. 3b). The PL emission intensity of the Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16PbBr0.51I2.49 perovskite film is quenched by approximately 73%, 75% and 80% of the initial values by CB-S, TeCA-S and TeCA-BPO-S films, respectively (Fig. S10†). This significant quenching and slight blue-shift of the emission indicate an efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to the HTLs in all cases.28 Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra demonstrate that the perovskite layer has a long PL lifetime of 275 ns, indicating a good quality of the film (Fig. 3c and S10†).45 When coated with the TeCA-BPO-S HTL films, the PL lifetime sharply reduces to 10.3 ns, which is slightly shorter than 13.2 and 12.4 ns measured for the TeCA-S and CB-S samples, respectively (Table S1†). This result indicates that the additional doping provided by the presence of BPO improves the spiro-OMeTAD capability for the hole extraction and accelerates charge separation from the perovskite to the HTL.
Time-resolved confocal PL lifetime maps were collected to further characterize the charge transfer properties between the perovskite and HTL films (see Fig. 3d–f and S11†). A significant decrease of PL lifetime and smaller signal range were observed after coating TeCA-S, and these effects were even further enhanced for TeCA-BPO-S. Thus all PL measurements consistently attest to the improved charge-extraction capacity of the spiro-OMeTAD films doped using TeCA + BPO combination.
Photovoltaic performance
To assess the implications of the differences in the properties of spiro-OMeTAD films doped via different strategies summarized above on their performance as HTLs in photovoltaic devices, we fabricated solar cells with a standard n–i–p architecture (Fig. S12†) by sequential deposition of components onto glass covered with fluorine-doped tin(IV) oxide. Thoroughly optimized procedures adopted from the literature and established in our laboratory were employed.46,47 Cross-sectional SEM images of typical solar cells using different HTLs are presented in Fig. S12† and demonstrate that all HTLs with different dopants exhibit uniform and complete coverage on the perovskite layer. The X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of the target crystal structure of the perovskite and no negative effects of the HTL deposition (Fig. S13†). According to SEM, the perovskite film contains large grains with an average size of ∼350 nm, which is in accord with previous reports (Fig. 3a).47,48
First, we found that changing the molar ratio of BPO in the HTL precursor solution significantly affects the solar cell performance (Fig. S14†). For the devices based on TeCA-BPO-S HTMs, the PCEs increase with the BPO concentration until reaching the highest values at 90 mol%. Further increase in the BPO ratio does not improve the cell performance. The trend of PCE is highly correlated with the evolution of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill-factor (FF), which can be explained by the differences in the conductivity of the HTL (Fig. 1d). The effects of the concentration of spiro-OMeTAD in the HTL precursor solutions were also studied (Fig. S15†). The highest efficiencies were achieved with a spiro-OMeTAD concentration of 30 mM, which means a lower cost of the devices with new doping strategy as compared to the optimal concentration of 60–70 mM for the traditional LiTFSI + tBP + O2 doping.46,47 As shown in Fig. S4,† the conductivity of the HTL films increase gradually with the increase in the BPO content, and decrease when the molar ratio is more than 90 mol%. The dependence of the device performance on the content of BPO is very likely associated to conductivity of the films. The PCE increases as the concentration of spiro-OMeTAD decreases, maximized at 30 mM. This improvement is mainly attributed to the FF enhancement with concentration, which determines the thickness of the HTL.
As shown in Fig. 4a and Table S2,† the average PCE for the cells based on CB-doped-S was 19.4 ± 0.7%, with VOC of 1.11 ± 0.04 V, JSC of 22.7 ± 0.5 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.80 ± 0.02, which is consistent with previous reports.48 The TeCA-S cells showed an average PCE of 12 ± 2%, but the values significantly increased to 17.5 ± 0.8% after the addition of BPO for TeCA-BPO-S cells. The TeCA-BPO-S cells exhibited a champion efficiency of 18.3%, with a VOC of 1.11 V, a JSC of 22.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.73 (Fig. 4b). The increased VOC and FF indicates that BPO plays an important role in the photovoltaic performance of devices, which is consistent with the HTL conductivity (Fig. 1d). We note that the hysteresis of TeCA-BPO-S devices is greater than that of CB-doped-S devices (Fig. 4b). The relatively lower conductivity of the TeCA-BPO-S HTL should be the major reason, since it can lead to an inefficient charge transfer and charge accumulation at the interfaces.49–51 Therefore, to better evaluate device performance, steady-state power output values are measured and provided in Table S2.† The integrated JSC values derived from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were 22.1, 21.8, and 22.2 mA cm−2 for the CB-doped-S, TeCA-S and TeCA-BPO-S cells, respectively, which is in good agreement with the current density extracted from J–V curves (Fig. 4c). In other words, the key parameter that makes the difference in devices performance is FF. The fundamental factor limiting the FF of perovskite solar cells is charge transfer loss, which includes charge recombination loss and solar cells resistance.52

Analysis of the dark Jdark–V curves (Fig. 4d) according to the eqn (3) and (4) provides information on the series resistance (Rs) and ideality factor (m).53 (3) (4)where J0, q, kB, and T are the reverse saturation current, elementary charge, Boltzmann constant, and cell temperature, respectively. The Rs values for CB-doped-S, TeCA-S and TeCA-BPO-S cell were ca. 1.4, 12.5 and 7.5 Ω, respectively, which is consistent with the conductivities of these HTLs (Fig. S4†). The value of m calculated for the TeCA-BPO-S device (m = 1.86) is slightly lower than that determined for the CB-doped-S cell (m = 1.93) and TeCA-S cell (m = 1.95), indicating less pronounced nonradiative trap-assisted recombination in the devices based on TeCA-BPO-S.54
To study the carrier recombination in the PSCs with CB-doped-S or TeCA-BPO-S HTLs, light intensity (I) dependent J–V characteristics were recorded. Fig. 4e shows the linear relation of JSC ∝ Iα in a bilogarithmic scale. When the value of α is close to 1, the device shows weak space charge effects and almost all charge could be collected prior to recombination.52,55 The fitted α values were similar among the three devices, i.e. CB-doped-S (ca. 0.93), TeCA-BPO-S (ca. 0.94) or TeCA-S (ca. 0.93). At the same time, the dependence of VOC on I differed notably between different HTLs (Fig. 4f). Specifically, the TeCA-BPO-S based devices showed much lower slope of the close-to lienar VOCvs. logI plots (1.59kBT/q) as compared to those with CB-doped-S (1.91kBT/q) and TeCA-S (1.97kBT/q) as HTLs. In general, the trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination is at play when the slope of the VOCvs. logI dependencies deviates from kBT/q.56 Although the lower slope provided by the TeCA-BPO-S HTL is indicative of suppressed trap-assisted recombination loss, the Rs of TeCA-BPO-S is larger and its conductivity is slightly lower than that of CB-doped-S, resulting in lower charge transfer efficiency and thus reduces the device performance, especially the FF parameter.57
Thermal stability
To examine the long-term thermal stability of the PSCs based on radical-doped spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporter, non-encapsulated cells with either CB-doped-S or TeCA-BPO-S as HTLs were stored at 80 °C and 15 ± 5% relative humidity in air in the dark (Fig. 5). The CB-doped-S cells suffer from a sharp drop to <35% of the initial PCE within only 140 h due to the thermal sensitivity of the dopants left in the HTL, as reflected by significant deterioration in the JSC and FF parameters. In contrast, TeCA-BPO-S cells retain more than 75% of their initial PCE values during the 500 h ageing period with negligible changes to JSC and FF, and the major loss in the performance was due to the decrease of VOC, which was also observed for the control samples (Fig. 5a–d).

Data were extracted from the J–V curves recorded with an aperture of 0.16 cm2 under AM 1.5G 1-sun illumination and are presented as mean ± standard deviation calculated for n = 5 independent devices of each type. (e) Cross-sectional SEM images for the solar cells with CB-doped-S and TeCA-BPO-S before/after ageing. (f) Water contact angle images of CB-doped-S and TeCA-BPO-S samples before/after ageing. 
To illustrate the durability against thermal stress provided by the use of TeCA-BPO-S HTL, the morphology of the cells was analyzed by cross-sectional SEM (Fig. 5e). In the as-prepared devices, HTM layers are dense and uniform without any defects or voids. After ageing at 80 °C for 500 h, large voids emerge across the whole layer of the CB-doped-S HTL (Fig. 5e), which is confirmed by the surface morphology deformation (Fig. S16†). The H2O contact angle is also significantly reduced from 107° to 72° (Fig. 5f), which is indicative of the loss of the original hydrophobic properties due to severe damage of the HTL. In comparison, the contact angle of the TeCA-BPO-S HTL is reduced from 110 to 95°, which should be due to the increased hygroscopic spiro-OMeTAD˙+ in the TeCA-BPO-S HTL.58 Furthermore, the crystallinity of the perovskite along the (100) crystal plane significantly decreases (Fig. S17†). All these changes in the perovskite and HTL are detrimental to the solar cell performance, as reflected by the continuous deterioration of all key photovoltaic parameters (Fig. 5a–d).
In contrast, the cells with TeCA-BPO-S as HTL are much more thermally stable and suffer negligible morphology and grain size change after the heat treatment (Fig. 5e, f and S18†). In addition, the reduction of contact angle is much lower than that of the CB-doped-S sample (Fig. 5f). Given that apart from the HTL, all other components of these two types of cells are identical, we ascribe the significant variations in the stability performance to the different doping strategies employed, with the TeCA + BPO photochemical p-doping approach providing impressive improvements in the stability.
As shown in Fig. S18,† the performance of non-encapsulated devices based on TeCA-BPO-S HTL decreases when they are aged under ambient conditions (40 ± 5% RH, 25 ± 5 °C temperature in the dark). The efficiencies dropped to 70% of their initial values after 5 days, which is similar with CB-doped-S devices. As reported by Huang et al., the moisture attacks the perovskite active layer from the side instead of the top of the cells. Therefore, the degradation of the device performance under moisture is more related to the perovskite layer instead of the HTL.59 Thus, full encapsulation is recommended in the future application of PSCs.60,61
Effect of anion and larger scale module
As reported by Ho et al.,62,63 not only the properties of the host materials, but also the Madelung potential of the counter ions also strongly influence the electric properties of the p-doped OSCs. Hence, optimization of the chemical nature of the counter anion provides an opportunity to further improve the conductivity of the radical-doped HTLs and thus the solar cell performance. An organic salt, tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6), which is commonly used as a supporting electrolyte for the electrochemical studies was used herein to tune the Madelung potential of the counter anions.27,64 As shown in Fig. S19,† the conductivity of the HTL enhanced from ca. 1.6 × 10−4 to 2.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 upon introduction of 90 mol% nBu4NPF6 to the spiro-OMeTAD solution in TeCA with 90 mol% BPO. When applied as HTL in PSCs with the same configuration as presented above, this more conductive material (TeCA-BPO-PF6-S) provided the best power conversion efficiency of 21.1% (Fig. 6a). The improvement was majorly associated with the increase in the FF and VOC, which we ascribe to the increase in electrical conductivity facilitating fast charge transfer. The devices displayed excellent reproducibility as concluded from testing 32 solar cells in six independent batches with nBu4NPF6 introduced in the spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution (Fig. 6b and Table S2†).

The inset is the 120 s SPO tracked at 5.01 V. All measurements were under AM 1.5G 1-sun simulated irradiation. 
Moreover, we fabricated perovskite solar module with the TeCA-BPO-PF6-S HTL deposited on a larger-area perovskite film (mask area 10 cm2; Fig. 6c) to demonstrate the scalability of our method. A stabilized PCE of 16.8% was achieved for the modules comprising 6 series-connected sub-cells (Fig. 6d), which demonstrated a promising step forward in the development of large-scale perovskite photovoltaics.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of doping small-molecule and polymeric organic semiconductors with free radicals for the application as hole transporting layer in perovskite solar cells. The free-radical initiator BPO substantially promotes the generation of chlorine radical from TeCA, which steadily oxidizes the organic semiconductors. We show that this new doping strategy enhances the conductivity and tunes the work function of HTL, without the need for O2 exposure or any volatile additives. More importantly, the doping process avoids introducing impurities in the working films, which assure the stability of the films and thus the solar cells. Moreover, by tuning the Madelung potential of the counter ions, we achieved efficiency of 21.1% for small-area (0.16 cm2) PSCs and 16.8% for larger-area (10 cm2) PSMs. The p-doping method is not restricted to the BPO-TeCA system. In principle, it can be extended to other free-radical systems in which different free radical initiator in combination with counter-ions should be feasible, which highlights an unexplored avenue to pursue for controlled doping of organic semiconductors.
