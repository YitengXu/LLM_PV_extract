    , Accepted 13th February 2023First published on 14th February 2023AbstractHalide perovskites (HPs) have been considered next-generation solar energy conversion materials since they have outstanding properties such as a long carrier lifetime and high light absorption coefficient. Nevertheless, the stability against humidity is a major obstacle to the application of HPs for solar energy conversion devices, for example, photocatalysts for HI splitting operating in an aqueous solution. Two-dimensional halide perovskites (2D HPs) have been suggested to overcome the vulnerable properties to humidity, in which large organic cations (i.e., spacer) bonded at their surface delay the penetration of H2O into the octahedron layer of 2D HPs. However, they still lack thermodynamic stability against humidity. In this work, we show by first-principles calculation that an external electric field causes a 2D HP stable to humidity in both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects since the energy of surface-adsorbed H2O is significantly lowered relative to intercalated H2O in addition to the progressive increase of the migration energy barrier of H2O with the external electric field. Further, the calculated band edge positions become suitable for photocatalytic HI splitting under the electric field. We suggest that 2D HPs exposed to an electric field are promising photocatalysts for HI splitting with humidity resistance as well as appropriate band edge position.
Introduction
Halide perovskites (HPs) have outstanding optoelectronic properties such as long carrier lifetime, high carrier mobility, and light absorption coefficient, and have attracted intensive attention for the application to next-generation solar energy conversion devices such as photovoltaics1–9 and photocatalysts.10–14 Since Kojima reported the first photovoltaic cell using HPs with 3.8% power conversion efficiency (PCE) in 2009,1 the PCE has been improved to more than 25%.9 In addition, the applications of HPs as a photocatalyst, which converts solar energy into chemical energy such as hydrogen gas, have recently been suggested.15,16 HI splitting is a good candidate for generating H2 gas, in which HPs exhibited excellent performance as a photocatalyst when HPs are immersed in an HI aqueous solution with a high concentration of H+ and I− ions and exposed to sunlight.17–22 When a co-catalyst such as TiO2 is used, the generation of H2 gas amounts to 5960 μmol g−1 h−1,20 which is one of the most efficient photocatalysts.
However, HPs are degraded when exposed to humid conditions via the following process23–31 (see Fig. S1†): (i) intercalation: within a few minutes, H2O molecules migrate into the octahedron layer of HPs to form an H2O intercalated structure, since the energy of the H2O intercalated structure is lower than that of the surface-adsorbed structure.23–27 (ii) Hydration I: the intercalated H2O molecules change the connectivity of octahedra to form the monohydrate.27–29 (iii) Hydration II: after a few hours under humid conditions, a phase transformation from the monohydrate to a dihydrate occurs.27–31 (iv) Decomposition: HPs are decomposed to PbI2 and MAI in an irreversible way.27–31 The bandgap of HPs in the form of the monohydrate and dihydrate is more than 2.5 eV,28 which makes it hard to absorb visible light, and the performance of the HP devices dramatically decreases.29 Therefore, it is important to prevent the migration of H2O into the octahedron layer to fully utilize the superior light absorption properties of HPs.
In order to resolve the degradation under humid conditions, two-dimensional Ruddlesden–Popper halide perovskites (2D HPs) have been suggested.32,33 The degradation of 2D HPs under humid conditions is delayed compared to their 3D counterparts due to spacer cations, i.e., large organic molecules placed between octahedron layers in a 2D structure, which prevents the intercalation of H2O molecules.34–42 The chemical formula of 2D HPs is S2An−1BnX3n+1, where S is the large organic spacer (e.g., BA+), A is a small organic cation or monovalent metal cation (e.g., MA+), B is a divalent metal cation (e.g., Pb2+), X is a halide anion (e.g., I−), and n is the number of the octahedron layers separated by spacers.34–37 A large organic spacer, BA+, introduced in BA2MA2Pb3I10 (BMPI), increases the migration energy barrier more than five times compared to the 3D counterpart,39 MAPbI3, whereas the 3D counterpart has the H2O migration energy barrier from the surface into the octahedron layer of 0.13 eV.24 However, the efficiency of solar energy conversion devices using BMPI decreases to less than 1/10 of the initial value in 40 hours after exposure to humid conditions without encapsulation.33 This means the lack of thermodynamic stability, i.e., the energy of the H2O intercalated structure is still lower than that of the surface-adsorbed structure despite the increased H2O migration energy barrier in BMPI.39 Therefore, the thermodynamic stability of BMPI with surface-adsorbed H2O relative to the intercalated case is of primary importance for photocatalyst applications while the H2O migration energy barrier needs to be high as well. To improve the stability, one can consider effective ways of modulating the electronic structure of low-dimensional materials such as applying an external electric field (ext),43–45 chemical doping46–48 as well as encapsulation.49–53 Several studies have been reported such that the efficiency of catalysts is improved using the external field by modulating the chemical reactivity54,55 such as field-assisted catalysts56,57 and bipolar electrochemical cells.58 It is also reported that the external field modulates the electronic structure of a 2D HP and enhances the efficiency of the solar energy conversion devices with 2D HPs.41
In this work, we investigated the atomic and electronic structures of BMPI with H2O molecules adsorbed on the surface and intercalated in the octahedron layer under an external field. The stability of BMPI against humidity is quantitatively examined using first-principles calculation based on density functional theory (DFT). Calculation results show that the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the BMPI against humidity increase with the external field. As the external field is applied, the relative thermodynamic stability of the adsorbed H2O molecule compared to the intercalated one gradually increases, and the adsorbed state becomes more stable than the intercalated state when ext> 1.5 V nm−1. The migration barrier of the H2O molecule into the octahedron layer also increases as the external field is applied. We find that the interaction energy between the dipole moment of H2O and the induced local electric field is the primary factor in the field dependence of the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities. Calculated electronic structures indicate that BMPI is a promising catalyst because of the spatial separation of valence and conduction bands. Considering the calculated band energies and the reported reduction potentials, we suggest that BMPI can be used as a catalyst for HI splitting when exposed to a bias field.
Computational details
First-principles calculation was performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package59,60 employing the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof scheme.61 The projector-augmented wave62 method with 600 eV cutoff energy was used, and the van der Waals interaction was included with the DFT-D3 method.63,64 In atomic structure relaxation, the ionic and electronic step convergence threshold was set to 0.02 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively, and a 6 × 6 × 1 Γ-centered k-point grid was used. In the charge density calculation, the electronic step convergence threshold was set to be 10−7 eV and a 12 × 12 × 1 Γ-centered k-point grid was used. Using the converged charge density, electronic band structures were calculated along the symmetry lines, where Γ = 0, X = π/a·x, Y = π/b·y, and S = π/a·x + π/b·y with the unit vectors x and y in x- and y-directions, respectively. The eigenvalues of 74 k-points between Γ and S points were calculated while 51 k-points were used between other symmetry points. More than 20 Å vacuum was included in slab structures to avoid the artificial interaction between the slabs. The climbing image nudged elastic band method65,66 was used to calculate the migration barrier. During the migration barrier calculations, four images connecting the initial and final images are used, and the convergence thresholds were set to 10−5 eV and 0.05 eV Å−1 in electronic and ionic steps, respectively.
Results and discussion
Since BMPI is often utilized as a photocatalyst with various co-catalysts.18–22i.e., one surface exposed to light and the other surface in conjunction with the co-catalyst, the H2O molecule can penetrate through only one surface of the BMPI while the other surface is passivated by other materials physically preventing the penetration, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Therefore, one surface presumably exposed to light is considered in this work. The atomic and electronic structures of the BMPI with the H2O molecule adsorbed on the surface or intercalated in the octahedron layer below the surface were calculated under various electric fields along the −z-direction (ext = 0, …, 3 V nm−1) using DFT calculations. The structure of the pristine BMPI was constructed with MA+ ions oriented in a surface normal direction (−z-direction), as shown in Fig. 1(b), adopting experimental results by applying the electric field,41 and the constructed structure was optimized by minimizing the total energy. The optimized lattice constants are a = 8.91 Å and b = 8.75 Å, which agree with previous reports.34,39 The structures of the BMPI with H2O molecules were constructed by placing one H2O molecule on the surface (adsorption) or within the octahedron layer (intercalation) of the pristine BMPI using a √2 × √2 supercell, and the atomic positions of the constructed structures were relaxed by minimizing the DFT total energy.

(d) The binding energies, the adsorption (Ebindad), and the intercalation (Ebindint) energy, as functions of the external electric field (ext). In (d), the blue and orange regions respectively represent the thermodynamically stable (Ebindad < Ebindint) and unstable (Ebindad > Ebindint) regions against humidity. 
For the adsorption and intercalation sites, four different positions were considered such that the hydrogen bonds between the H2O molecule and BMPI can be maximized, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Among them, RF and RB sites (shown in Fig. 1(c)) were the lowest-energy sites for the adsorption and intercalation, respectively for all the investigated external electric fields (Fig. S2†). The adsorption (or intercalation) energy of the H2O molecule, Ebindad(int) was calculated as a function of ext. Ebindad(int) is defined as Ebindad(int) (ext) = ERP+H2O (ext) − [ERP (ext) + EH2O (ext)], where ERP+H2O, ERP, and EH2O are the DFT total energies of the BMPI with H2O adsorbed (or intercalated) at the RF (or RB) site, the pristine BMPI, and free H2O molecules in the vacuum with ext. The relaxed H2O molecule in a cubic unit cell composed of 10 × 10 × 10 Å vacuum under the external electric field was used in the calculation of EH2O (ext). Fig. 1(d) shows the calculated Ebindad and Ebindintvs. ext. Without the external field (ext = 0 V nm−1), the H2O molecule is more stable in the intercalated state than in the adsorbed state (Ebindad = −0.40 eV and Ebindint = −0.46 eV). This suggests that H2O molecules prefer migrating from the surface into the octahedron layer. When the external field is applied to the system, both Ebindint and Ebindad increase. Ebindint and Ebindad linearly increase with the external field and the increasing rate of Ebindint is larger than that of Ebindad, as shown in Fig. 1(d). When ext > 1.5 V nm−1, the adsorbed H2O becomes more stable than the intercalated one (Ebindad < Ebindint). In other words, H2O molecules thermodynamically prefer staying on the surface to migrating into the intercalation position at ext > 1.5 V nm−1.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the optimized atomic structure of BMPI with the H2O molecule adsorbed at RF and intercalated at RB, respectively, without the electric field. When the H2O molecule is adsorbed on the surface, two hydrogen bonds between H atoms of the H2O molecule and I− ions on the surface are formed and the dipole moment of the H2O molecule, Pad, is almost parallel to ext (−z-direction) to form the hydrogen bonds, as shown in Fig. 2(a). When the H2O molecule is intercalated into the octahedron layer, four hydrogen bonds are formed, i.e., two hydrogen bonds between H atoms of the H2O molecule (Hw) and I− ions of BMPI and the other two hydrogen bonds between the O atom of the H2O molecule (Ow) and the H atom of MA+ (HM). The H2O molecule under the hydrogen bonds is rotated by ∼130°, i.e., the angle between Pint and ext is ∼130°, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Since the intercalated H2O molecule forms more hydrogen bonds than the adsorbed one, Ebindad is larger than Ebindint when the external electric field is not applied.

(c) The dipole interaction energy (Edipad(int)) of H2O with the external field at the adsorbed (or intercalated) site. Edipad(int) is defined as Edipad(int) = −Pad(int) · ind, where Pad(int) and ind are the dipole moment of adsorbed (or intercalated) H2O and an induced local field near H2O. (d) The change of the difference (ΔE) in the binding, dipole interaction, and BMPI–H2O interaction energy between adsorbed and intercalated states with the external field. ΔE is defined as ΔE = Eint − Ead, where E is Ebind, Edip, and Einter. 
The different binding configurations of adsorbed and intercalated H2O cause different interactions between their dipole moments and the local field (ind) induced by the external electric field. To analyze the dipole interactions, we first calculated the additional local field induced by the external field at the adsorption and intercalation sites. The local field (ind) is defined as ind = ∇V(rH2O, ext) − ∇V(rH2O, 0), where rH2O is the center of mass position of the H2O molecule (adsorbed or intercalated) in the optimized structure of BMPI with H2O, and ∇V (rH2O, ext) is the gradient of the Hartree potential at rH2O under the external field. The local electric field at the adsorption site is much larger than that at the intercalation site. For example, the external electric field of 1.5 V nm−1 induces the local field of 1 and 0.2 V nm−1 near the adsorbed and intercalated H2O, respectively, as shown in Fig. S3.†
Then, the dipole interaction energy (Edipad(int)) was calculated, which is defined as Edipad(int) = −Pad(int) · ind, where Pad(int) is the dipole moment of the adsorbed (or intercalated) H2O. Pad(int) was calculated using a H2O-only structure in which its atomic structure is captured from the relaxed atomic structure of BMPI with a H2O molecule. Fig. 2(c) shows the calculated dipole interaction energy. When the external electric field increases from 0 to 3 V nm−1, Edipad decreases from 0 to −0.074 eV, while Edipint increases from 0 to 0.014 eV. The dipole interaction energy is represented as Edipad(int) = −Pad(int) · ind = −|PH2O‖ind|cosθ ≃ −(1/εr)|PH2O‖ext|cosθ. Here, εr is the relative permittivity defined as εr = |ext|/|ind| (Fig. S3†) and θ is the angle between the dipole moment of H2O and the electric field. As mentioned above, θ is almost 0° and 130° for adsorbed and intercalated H2O, respectively. Consequently, under the electric field, Edipad increases while Edipint decreases. Their difference mainly contributes to the different interaction energies between BMPI and adsorbed (or intercalated) H2O.
The binding energy is composed of two components, Ebind = Einter + Edist, where Einter, and Edist are interaction and distortion energies, respectively. (See ESI note 1 for details†). The interaction energy between BMPI and the adsorbed (or intercalated) H2O molecule (BMPI–H2O interaction energy) includes the hydrogen bond, van der Waals interactions, and the dipole interaction of H2O which is discussed above. The distortion energy (Edist) of BMPI and H2O is not sensitively influenced by the external field (Fig. S4†). Therefore, the change of the binding energy with the external field comes primarily from the change of the interaction energy between BMPI and H2O including the dipole interaction.
Note that the stability of BMPI is determined by the energy difference between adsorption and intercalation. Then, the energy difference between adsorption and intercalation is defined as ΔE = Eint − Ead, where energy E can represent the binding (Ebind), interaction (Einter), or dipole interaction (Edip) energy. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the difference between dipole interaction energies at the adsorption and intercalation sites mainly contributes to the interaction energy difference, and consequently the binding energy difference. This result indicates that the relative change of the binding energy between the adsorption and intercalation (Fig. 1(d)) is mainly caused by the different dipole interactions at the adsorption and intercalation sites, which is further attributed to the difference in the binding configuration of an adsorbed and intercalated H2O molecule in BMPI, i.e., 0° and 130° relative to the direction of the external (or local) field for the adsorbed and intercalated H2O molecule (Fig. 2(a) and (b)), respectively.
Following the analysis of the relative stability under the external field, the migration energy barrier (Ebarr) and the migration path of the H2O molecule from the surface to the octahedron layer under the external field were investigated by the climbing image nudged elastic band method. The migration path is one from the surface-adsorbed RF position (Φ1) through the intercalated RF position (Φ3) to the intercalated RB position (Φ5) for all the investigated ext, which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The field dependence of the migration path is negligible. Other migration paths such as through the adsorbed RB position (see Fig. S5†) have higher energy barriers than the preferred path. The lowest-energy path consists of two consecutive paths: (i) penetration [Φ1 − Φ2 − Φ3] and (ii) diffusion [Φ3 − Φ4 − Φ5], as illustrated in Fig. 3(a)–(d). (i) Penetration: the H2O molecule penetrates from the surface-adsorbed RF position (Φ1) to the intercalated RF position (Φ3). As mentioned above, the adsorbed H2O molecule initially forms hydrogen bonds with the surface I− ions (Φ1). During penetration, these hydrogen bonds are broken, and H2O passes through the PbI2 layer (Φ2) and moves to the intercalated RF position (Φ3). When H2O passes through the PbI2 layer (Φ2), large-sized spacers at the surface of the octahedron layer, BA+, are rotated, and the PbI2 layer is strongly distorted (Fig. 3(c)). This leads to a large migration energy barrier during the penetration. Epenbarr is defined as Epenbarr = E(Φ2) − E(Φ1), where E(Φi) is the DFT total energy of Φi. (ii) Diffusion: within the octahedron layer, the H2O molecule diffuses from the intercalated RF position (Φ3) to the intercalated RB position (Φ5). During the diffusion, H2O passes through the path between the MA+ ion and I− ion (Φ4), forcing the rotation of the MA+ ion and the displacement of the I− ions (Fig. 3(d)). In the diffusion, the migration energy barrier, Ediffbarr is also defined as Ediffbarr = E(Φ4) − E(Φ1), which is lower than the migration energy barrier for the penetration, since the rotation of MA+ is easier than BA+, and the octahedron distortion in the diffusion (Φ4) is smaller than that in the penetration (Φ2). Therefore, the migration energy barrier during the penetration is the highest along the whole migration path shown in Fig. 3(b), i.e., Ebarr = Epenbarr. The change in the migration barriers with the external field is displayed in Fig. 3(b). As the external field increases, Ebarr progressively increases (Fig. 3(c)). Ebarr is 0.69, 0.72, 0.75, and 0.79 eV when ext = 0, 1, 2, and 3 V nm−1, respectively. The result clearly shows that the external field improves the stability of BMPI against humidity in the kinetic aspects. The field dependence of Ebarr also mainly comes from the dipole interaction energy. The dipole interaction energy of the initial state (Φ1) is much lower than those of other transition states (Φ2–Φ5) due to the weaker screening on the surface than that in the octahedron layer.

The electronic structure of BMPI with H2O molecules adsorbed on the surface is further analyzed with the electric field. Fig. 4 shows the electronic band structures and the wavefunctions of the valence and conduction bands near the chemical potential (μ) at the center of the Brillouin zone (Γ), where both the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) occur. For all the investigated external fields, the highest (ψVBM) and the second highest (ψVBM-1) valence bands comprise Pb 6s and I 5p orbitals, while the lowest (ψCBM) and the second lowest (ψCBM+1) conduction bands comprise Pb 6p and I 5s orbitals. Without the external field, the valence bands, ψVBM-1 and ψVBM, are localized in the middle layer (L2) and the upper layer (L1), respectively, while the conduction bands, ψCBM and ψCBM+1, are localized in the lower layer (L3) (Fig. 4(b)). The spatial separation of the valence and conduction bands appears due to the aligned MA+ ions in the octahedron layer, which separates photoexcited holes (h+) and electrons (e−) into L1 and L3, respectively, delaying the charge recombination.31 When the external field is applied, the valence bands, ψVBM-1 and ψVBM, are mixed with each other so that the VBM state, ψVBM, has contribution from L2 as well as L1, whereas the conduction bands, ψCBM and ψCBM+1, remain localized in L3, as shown in Fig. 4. Under the external field, the valence and conduction bands remain spatially separated despite the delocalization of the valence bands.

In (a, c, e, and g), the electronic band structures along the symmetry lines are presented, where Γ = 0, X = π/a·x, Y = π/b·y, and S = π/a·x + π/b·y with the unit vectors x and y in x- and y-directions, respectively. In (b, d, f, and h), the squared wavefunctions are presented with the atomic structure of the BMPI with H2O adsorbed on the surface. The isosurface of the squared wavefunctions is shaded in yellow, and L1, L2, and L3 represent the upper layer, middle layer, and lower layer of the BMPI, respectively. 
The catalytic properties of BMPI and the suitable range of ext for HI splitting are investigated with the calculation results above. The spatial separation of the valence and conduction bands induces the spatial separation of oxidation (3I− + 2h+ → I3−) and reduction (2H+ + 2e− → H2) reactions of HI splitting. Fig. 5(a) displays a schematic diagram of the HI splitting, showing the oxidation reaction near L1 and the reduction reaction near L3. Note that it is expected that the spatial separation of the oxidation and reduction reactions, which respectively require photoexcited h+ and e− from photocatalysts, increases the efficiency of HI splitting due to delayed charge recombination.21,40,41 The necessary conditions for the HI splitting are (i) CBM should be higher in energy than the reduction potential of H (VH) for reduction and (ii) VBM should be lower in energy than the reduction potential of I (VI) for oxidation, as shown in Fig. 5(b)–(c). Considering the spatial separation of the reactions, we calculate the energy of the CBM referenced to the vacuum level of the surface near L3 (ECBM) and that of the VBM referenced to the vacuum level of the surface near L1 (EVBM) (see Fig. 5(b)–(c) and S6†). Fig. 5(d) shows the calculated ECBM and EVBM as a function of ext along with the reported reduction potentials referenced to the vacuum level (VH = −4.44 eV67 and VI = −4.77 eV17,68). As the external field increases, ECBM linearly decreases to −3.08, −3.46, −3.84, and −4.21 eV for ext = 0, 1, 2, and 3 V nm−1, respectively. On the other hand, EVBM linearly increases as the external field increases, EVBM = −5.71, −5.38, −5.07, and −4.77 eV for ext = 0, 1, 2, and 3 V nm−1, respectively. Note that the gap between the ECBM and EVBM does not mean the band gap of BMPI since they are referenced to different vacuum levels as explained above (See Fig. S6 and ESI note 2 for details†). By extrapolation, we obtain the suitable conditions, ext < 3.6 V nm−1 and ext < 3.0 V nm−1, for the reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. Consequently, the band edge positions are suitable for HI splitting when ext < 3.0 V nm−1. Combined with the result that BMPI has stability against humidity in thermodynamic aspects at ext > 1.5 V nm−1, the proper field is obtained in the range of 1.5 V nm−1 to 3.0 V nm−1, as illustrated in Fig. 5(d). Therefore, we show that BMPI under appropriate fields can be an efficient and stable photocatalyst for HI splitting. Although the proposed range of the external electric field is too strong to be applied experimentally, it should be noted that the stability of BMPI is influenced by the local electric field. The external electric field, for example 1.5 V nm−1, induces the local electric field of 1 and 0.2 V nm−1 near the H2O adsorption and intercalation sites, as shown in Fig. S3.† Such a local field can be achieved by spacer molecules in 2D perovskites. Consequently, nanostructure engineering of BMPI (e.g., spacer cation engineering and chemical doping) could be another viable way to achieve enhanced stability.

In (d), the blue region represents the range of the ext (1.5 V nm−1 < ext < 3 V nm−1), where BMPI is thermodynamically stable against humidity (ext > 1.5 V nm−1) and has a suitable band edge position for HI splitting (ext < 3 V nm−1). 
Conclusions
In summary, we investigate the stability against humidity and catalytic properties of BMPI by applying an external electric field. Both thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the BMPI against humidity gradually increase with the external field. Under strong fields, the H2O molecule prefers staying out of the octahedron layer (inside BMPI) and the migration barrier also increases with the external field. Therefore, degradation of BMPI is prevented under the external field in terms of thermodynamic as well as kinetic aspects. The interaction energy between the dipole moment of the H2O and the electric field plays a crucial role in stabilizing BMPI against humidity. Calculated electronic structures indicate that BMPI is an effective catalyst because of the spatial separation of valence and conduction bands, and it can be used as a stable photocatalyst of HI splitting with appropriate external fields.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) A schematic picture of a 2D HP as a photocatalyst used in HI splitting with a co-catalyst. (b) A schematic picture of the atomic structure of BA2MA2Pb3I10 (BMPI) with oriented MA+ ions. PMA represents the net dipole moment of MA+ ions in BMPI (c) Candidate sites for the surface adsorption (top) and intercalation (bottom) of H2O molecules, which are top views of the blue and red parts of BMPI in (b), respectively. (d) The binding energies, the adsorption (Ebindad), and the intercalation (Ebindint) energy, as functions of the external electric field (ext). In (d), the blue and orange regions respectively represent the thermodynamically stable (Ebindad < Ebindint) and unstable (Ebindad > Ebindint) regions against humidity.	 

 	Fig. 2  The optimized atomic structures of BMPI with (a) a surface adsorbed and (b) an intercalated H2O molecule. (c) The dipole interaction energy (Edipad(int)) of H2O with the external field at the adsorbed (or intercalated) site. Edipad(int) is defined as Edipad(int) = −Pad(int) · ind, where Pad(int) and ind are the dipole moment of adsorbed (or intercalated) H2O and an induced local field near H2O. (d) The change of the difference (ΔE) in the binding, dipole interaction, and BMPI–H2O interaction energy between adsorbed and intercalated states with the external field. ΔE is defined as ΔE = Eint − Ead, where E is Ebind, Edip, and Einter.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) A schematic figure for the migration path of H2O molecules from the surface RF site to the intercalated RB site, through the intercalated RF site. (b) The energy of the intermediate states during the migration depending on ext. The DFT total energy of the initial state is set to zero. (c and d) The atomic structures of the selected states (φ1, φ2, φ3, φ4, and φ5) during (c) the penetration and (d) the diffusion under ext = 0 V nm−1.	 

 	Fig. 4  The electronic band structure of BMPI with surface adsorbed H2O molecules, and the squared wavefunction of the selected band in real space under ext = (a and b) 0 V nm−1, (c and d) 1 V nm−1, (e and f) 2 V nm−1, and (g and h) and 3 V nm−1. In (a, c, e, and g), the electronic band structures along the symmetry lines are presented, where Γ = 0, X = π/a·x, Y = π/b·y, and S = π/a·x + π/b·y with the unit vectors x and y in x- and y-directions, respectively. In (b, d, f, and h), the squared wavefunctions are presented with the atomic structure of the BMPI with H2O adsorbed on the surface. The isosurface of the squared wavefunctions is shaded in yellow, and L1, L2, and L3 represent the upper layer, middle layer, and lower layer of the BMPI, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) A schematic figure for HI splitting reactions on BMPI with surface absorbed H2O molecules. (b and c) The necessary conditions for (b) oxidation and (c) reduction reactions of HI splitting. VI and VH are the reduction potentials of I− oxidation (3I− + 2h+ → I3−) and H+ reduction (2H+ + 2e− → H2) reactions, respectively. (d) The band edge positions referenced to the vacuum levels (ECBM and EVBM) depending on ext. In (d), the blue region represents the range of the ext (1.5 V nm−1 < ext < 3 V nm−1), where BMPI is thermodynamically stable against humidity (ext > 1.5 V nm−1) and has a suitable band edge position for HI splitting (ext < 3 V nm−1).
