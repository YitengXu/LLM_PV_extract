    , Accepted 30th June 2019First published on 1st July 2019AbstractFullerene-free organic solar cells (FF-OSCs) composed of a wide-bandgap polymer donor (PD) and a small-bandgap organic small-molecule acceptor (SMA) are currently showing promising power conversion efficiency with good long-term stability. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of electron deficient alkylthiazole-based PDs for FF-OSCs. The synthesized 2,5-bis(5-bromo-4-octylthiazol-2-yl)thiophene (OTz) monomer has a simple conjugated backbone structure composed of thiophene and thiazole rings and is easily synthesized from relatively cheap starting materials, thiophene and 2-decanone, with an overall yield of 48%. To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the OTz moiety, it is copolymerized with several benzodithiophene-based comonomers. All of the PDs are semicrystalline because of the highly planar backbone structure of OTz. Among them, the PTBOTz polymer exhibits superior absorption, hole mobility and charge separation properties, and thus the photovoltaic device based on PTBOTz and the SMA exhibited the best PCE of 8.32% with excellent thermal stability. Analyzing the nanomorphology and charge separation and transport properties of the PDs and SMA, we found that sizable crystallinity without severe molecular aggregation in blend films is critical to improving the PCE as well as the thermal stability of FF-OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have consistently developed and progressed owing to their unique advantages of semi-transparency, freedom of shape, multicolor modules, and compatibility with roll-to-roll processing.1–6 Recently, the development of fullerene-free OSCs (FF-OSCs) composed of polymer donors (PDs) and electron acceptors has reached a milestone with the replacement of fullerene acceptors with conjugated organic small-molecule acceptors (SMAs)7–10 such as 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC)11,12 and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IT-4F).13,14 SMAs have strong solar absorption in the long-wavelength visible region, and their frontier molecular orbitals are adjustable for efficient charge transport in devices.15,16 Notably, the π-conjugated planar structure of SMAs with a twisted pendant group improves the miscibility and intermolecular interaction with PDs, which increases the mechanical and thermal stability of OSCs.16–18 SMA-based OSCs have recently been demonstrated to exhibit superior photovoltaic performance compared with fullerene-based OSCs, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15% has been achieved through developing new types of SMAs.19–21 In the case of PDs, fundamental synthetic strategies have been well established over the past decade. The electron push–pull structure constructed by coupling an electron-sufficient conjugated backbone with an electron-deficient one is highly efficient for decreasing the bandgap of PDs and for increasing the polarizability of PDs.22–25 Weak electron-push moieties such as alkyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) in the polymer backbone have also led to high open-circuit voltages (VOCs) in devices and high solubility of PDs in processing solvents.26–28 As a result, many high-efficiency PDs in FF-OSCs utilize BDT moieties as an electron-push structure and electron-pull structures have been diversified in the polymer backbone by introducing several well-known electron-deficient moieties such as thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD),29,30 benzotriazole,31,32 and benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD).33–35
In this study, we developed three kinds of electron-deficient octylthiazole-based PDs for FF-OSCs. Notably, we utilized relatively simple conjugated building blocks with an easy synthetic procedure. The synthesized building block 2,5-bis(5-bromo-4-octylthiazol-2-yl)thiophene (OTz) is composed of thiophene and thiazole. To impose the solubility in the conjugated backbone, we synthesized 2-bromo-4-octylthiazole36–38 from 2-decanone with minimal purification steps. The overall reaction yield of OTz was 48% from the relatively inexpensive chemicals thiophene (500 g, 48.90 USD, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2-decanone (1000 g, 661 USD, Sigma-Aldrich), notably including only two short column chromatography purification steps. In addition, the lone-pair electrons of the nitrogen atom in the OTz moiety can form intra- or intermolecular interactions with adjacent hydrogen atoms, thereby reducing steric repulsion with the adjacent thiophene ring,39 which in turn forms the planar conjugated ring system of OTz.40
The final polymer donors, PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz, were successfully synthesized by Stille polycondensation of OTz with three BDT derivatives, (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane), (4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) and (4,8-bis(5-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane), respectively. FF-OSC devices were fabricated by blending the three polymer donors, PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz, with IDIC41 (as an SMA). All of the polymers showed strong visible absorption in the range 350–650 nm, which allows complementary absorption with IDIC for panchromatic solar absorption. Notably, the semicrystallinity of the polymers from the planar backbone structure of OTz resulted in controlled molecular ordering in the blend films, which substantially improved the thermal stability of the OSCs. Detailed analyses of the nanomorphology and charge generation and transport properties were conducted, and we speculate that our report on the OTz moiety will motivate further explorations of such simple conjugation systems for PDs in FF-OSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and materials characterization
2-Bromo-4-octylthiazole (1) was synthesized from 2-decanone via bromination, nucleophilic substitution, and aromatic-ring formation, as shown in Scheme S1.† Notably, the first two steps do not require any purification steps; after the third step (aromatic-ring formation), only one UV-active spot was detected during thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and this compound was easily separated by column chromatography. 2,5-Bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (2) was synthesized by stannylation via lithiation with n-BuLi and purified by reprecipitation. 2,5-Bis(4-octylthiazol-2-yl)thiophene (3) was obtained as a yellow solid via Stille coupling of compounds 1 and 2, and only a yellow-colored spot in TLC indicated the product. The final monomer OTz was obtained by bromination using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), and the pure product was obtained by recrystallization from dichloromethane and methanol. The overall yield of OTz from the starting materials was 48%, including only two short column chromatography separations.
To make push–pull-type alternating PDs, OTz was copolymerized with three different BDT-based comonomers. The synthesized polymers were poly[(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-alt-((5-bromo-4-octylthiazol-2-yl)thiophene-2,5-diyl)] (PTBOTz), poly[(4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-alt-((5-bromo-4-octylthiazol-2-yl)thiophene-2,5-diyl)] (POBOTz), and poly[(4,8-bis(5-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-alt-((5-bromo-4-octylthiazol-2-yl)thiophene-2,5-diyl)] (PSBOTz). The synthesis route of OTz and the polymerization are shown in Scheme 1. The material cost of PTBOTz on the lab scale was estimated as shown in Scheme S2.† OTz was approximately 27$ per g including the column purification process and the final polymer could be obtained as 138$ per g. The utilization of the OTz monomer in polymer synthesis is quite promising to reduce the cost of polymer donors, and the replacement of the counter co-monomer will lead to a further decrease in the price.42

The synthesized polymers were characterized by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz was 37600, 13000, and 15400, respectively, and the corresponding dispersity (Đ) was 2.59, 1.34, and 3.54, respectively. The thermal stability of the PDs was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The 5% weight-loss temperature of PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz was 435 °C, 324 °C, and 324 °C, respectively. PTBOTz showed excellent thermal stability compared with POBOTz and PSBOTz because PTBOTz does not contain weak chemical bonding, such as alkoxy or thiol functional groups (Fig. S7†). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the synthesized materials (Fig. S1–S6†) and the detailed synthetic procedure are provided in the ESI.†
The backbone structure of the synthesized OTz was simulated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set in Gaussian 16 (Fig. S8†). For comparison, the molecular structure of 4,4′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (OTT) was also simulated. In the case of OTT, the dihedral angle among the thiophene rings was ∼30° on average; this is attributed to the orbital–orbital repulsion between hydrogen and adjacent sulfur atoms. However, the OTz instead forms a planar structure with a negligible dihedral angle among the aromatic rings, which implies that the nitrogen atom effectively reduces the backbone repulsion. This planar backbone structure of OTz is beneficial for improving the polymer chain ordering and π–π intermolecular stacking in pristine and blend films.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz in solutions and films are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. Even though all of the polymers have identical conjugated backbone structures, they showed quite different absorption spectra in both solution and film, which indicates that the pendant groups on the BDT moiety affect intra- and intermolecular interactions and the π-conjugation of the polymer chains. In solution, POBOTz exhibited the most hypsochromically shifted absorption and its shoulder absorption was minimized. By contrast, the PSBOTz and PTBOTz containing thiophene-based pendant groups showed more red-shifted absorption maximum than POBOTz due to the additional thiophene ring. Interestingly, PTBOTz showed the widest absorption covering the absorption areas of both POBOTz and PSBOTz and showed a clear shoulder peak at 587 nm. Thus, PTBOTz is expected to enable a sizable intra- and/or intermolecular interaction via polymer chain folding.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of (a) the synthesized polymer donors in solution and (b) the active layer materials in the film state. (c) Cyclic voltammograms and (d) the energy diagram calculated from the oxidation potential and optical bandgap. 
The absorption maxima in the spectra of PTBOTz and POBOTz in the film state were red-shifted by 10 nm and 12 nm, respectively; in addition, the spectra showed improved shoulder absorption and a broader absorption region than the PTBOTz and POBOTz in solution. These differences imply that intermolecular ordering among the polymer chains was improved in the film state. However, in the case of PSBOTz, absorption was not changed in the film state, which means that intermolecular ordering is relatively weak compared with that of PTBOTz and POBOTz in the film state. The optical bandgap of PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz was calculated from the onset wavelength in film states43 to be 1.95, 2.01, and 1.99 eV, respectively. Because PTBOTz exhibits the smallest bandgap, widest absorption band, and most developed π–π stacking shoulder absorption among the three synthesized polymers, PTBOTz is expected to be the best candidate PD for FF-OSCs.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the synthesized polymers were estimated via the onset oxidation potential from cyclic voltammetry (CV)44 and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS); their cyclic voltammograms and UPS spectra at the onset (EF) and high binding energy cutoff (Ecut) region are presented in Fig. 1c and Fig. S9,† respectively. The onset potentials of PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz were 0.61, 0.55, and 0.73 V, respectively, and their corresponding HOMO levels were −5.31, −5.25, and −5.43 eV, respectively. UPS measurements also showed a similar trend to CV results; the HOMO energy levels of PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz were −6.26, −6.20, and −6.39 eV, respectively.
The pendant-group effect on BDT moieties for HOMO energy levels has already been well-studied,45 and our results also support the previous conclusion. The HOMO energy levels of the polymers were gradually decreased in the order of ethylhexyloxy, ethylhexylthiophenyl, and ethylhexylthiothiophenyl substituents. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz were estimated from the HOMO levels and the optical bandgaps to be −3.36, −3.24, and −3.44 eV, respectively. Comparisons of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of IDIC reported in the literature and calculated from our measurements with those of the synthesized polymers indicate that the driving force for charge separation at the interfaces of PDs and IDIC appears to be sufficient in FF-OSC devices (Fig. 1d).46 Optical and electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1.

Photovoltaic properties
FF-OSCs were developed by blending the synthesized polymer donors with IDIC. The device fabrication and characterization procedure are given in detail in the ESI.† The current density (J) vs. voltage (V) characteristics under 1.5G AM illumination are shown in Fig. 2a, and the photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 2. The average values of photovoltaic parameters, PCE, JSC, VOC and FF, are shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S12.† The PTBOTz:IDIC devices exhibited a superior PCE of 8.32%, whereas the POBOTz:IDIC and PSBOTz:IDIC devices showed PCEs of 3.67% and 5.39%, respectively. This difference in photovoltaic performance was easily confirmed from JSC measurements. The PTBOTz:IDIC, POBOTz:IDIC, and PSBOTz:IDIC devices showed JSC values of 16.40, 10.80, and 15.35 mA cm−2, respectively, and their detailed analysis was carried out on the basis of external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 2c). The calculated JSC values of PTBOTz:IDIC, POBOTz:IDIC, and PSBOTz:IDIC devices, as obtained from the EQE curves, were 16.43, 10.48, and 14.90 mA cm−2, respectively, which are within a 5% error boundary of the JSC values determined from the J–V curves (Fig. 2a).

As shown in Fig. 2c, all of the devices showed panchromatic absorption in the range 350–800 nm. This is attributed to the complementary absorption between OTz-based polymers and IDIC (Fig. 1b). However, the PTBOTz:IDIC devices showed the highest and most well-balanced EQE over the entire examined wavelength range. Given the similar absorption spectra of the synthesized PDs, the PTBOTz:IDIC devices clearly have better charge separation or/and charge transport properties than the other devices. In the case of the VOC, the PSBOTz:IDIC devices showed the highest VOC of 0.81 V, which was 0.03 V and 0.07 V higher than that of PTBOTz:IDIC and POBOTz:IDIC devices, respectively. This is primarily attributed to the low-lying HOMO energy level of PSBOTz.47,48
Charge separation and transport properties
The charge transport properties of the active layer were characterized on the basis of space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobility. The fabrication and device structure of hole-only and electron-only devices are shown in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 3a and b, we selected a steady-state SCLC trap-free regime from the J–V curves and calculated the hole (μh) and electron mobility (μe) with consideration of the active-layer thickness measured from SEM images (Fig. S14†).29,49 The μh values of PTBOTz, POBOTz and PSBOTz pristine films were 7.24 × 10−4, 2.83 × 10−5, and 1.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S13†). The JSC values of the devices were increased in the order of the hole mobility of the pristine polymer film, which indicates that the higher μh facilitates the charge transport in the devices. The μh values of the PTBOTz:IDIC, POBOTz:IDIC, and PSBOTz:IDIC blend films were 8.9 × 10−4, 1.0 × 10−4, and 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the corresponding μe values were 6.0 × 10−6, 1.6 × 10−6, and 2.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PTBOTz:IDIC blend films exhibited better hole and electron charge transport properties than the other blend films. The hole and electron mobilities of the PTBOTz:IDIC device were 8–9 times and 2–3 times higher, respectively, than those of the other films. The improved charge transport properties of the PTBOTz:IDIC blend film resulted in a superior EQE over the entire investigated wavelength range and in a higher JSC of the FF-OSCs.

As shown in Fig. 1b, more efficient backbone conjugation and intermolecular interaction of PTBOTz is expected to increase the charge mobility in the devices. In addition, the morphological superiority of the PTBOTz:IDIC devices can enhance the charge transport properties of FF-OSCs. The molecular ordering and orientation of the film were investigated by two-dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD). As pristine films, all of the polymer donors showed clear (n00) reflection peaks (n = 1, 2, and 3) and the (010) diffraction peak along the qz axis (Fig. 4a). These (n00) peaks indicate lamellar-like ordering in the vertical direction from the substrate, implying edge-on orientation; the (010) peak indicates π–π stacking among the conjugated backbones, implying face-on orientation. Along the qxy axis, the ordering pattern is similar to that along the qz axis; however, the PTBOTz film has clearer (n00) lamellar-like ordering peaks (face-on orientation) and a weaker (010) π–π stacking peak (edge-on orientation) compared with the POBOTz and PSBOTz films (Fig. 4b). As a result, all of the PDs have both face-on and edge-on orientation, but the PTBOTz film prefers the face-on orientation compared with the POBOTz and PSBOTz films. From the (100) peak corresponding to the qz axis, the lamellar ordering distances of PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz were calculated to be 21.7, 19.0, and 22.4 Å, respectively. The d-spacing of PTBOTz and PSBOTz is ∼4 Å longer than that of POBOTz, which is similar to the size of the thiophene ring. Thus, the addition of the thiophene ring at the pendant group of polymers effectively increased the d-spacing of the lamellar-like ordering. The π–π stacking distance of the polymer films was estimated from the (010) peak at qz and was almost identical at 3.69 Å for all of the PDs.

The ordering pattern of the PTBOTz:IDIC and POBOTz:IDIC blend films was well developed, whereas that of the PSBOTz:IDIC film was weak (Fig. 4c). We speculate that the highest solubility of PSBOTz among the polymer donors increased the miscibility with IDIC, but the excessively high solubility of PSBOTz deteriorated the inherent crystallinity of IDIC in the blend films. Thus, the charge separation and transport properties of devices would be negatively influenced by the worsened crystallinity of the PSBOTz:IDIC film. In the cases of the PTBOTz:IDIC and POBOTz:IDIC films, the ordering of each PD and IDIC is clearly observed. As shown in Fig. 4c, g, and h, the lamellar-like ordering of PTBOTz and POBOTz was observed with (n00) reflections (n = 1, 2, and 3), and the d-spacing was calculated to be 22.0 Å and 18.9 Å, respectively. These values are identical to those of pristine polymer films. However, the ordering patterns of IDIC differ substantially between pristine films and blend films. In the blend films, the ordering of IDIC was relatively diminished compared with that in the pristine films; however, the sizable ordering of the (100) and (001) peaks was still observable. Consequently, the PTBOTz:IDIC and POBOTz:IDIC films effectively mitigated the severe aggregation of IDIC but formed crystalline domains in both the PD and the IDIC in the blend films. Notably, the π–π stacking (010) distances of the IDIC and the PDs are almost identical in the blend films, which is beneficial for intermolecular stacking between the PD and IDIC. In addition, strong π–π stacking was observed in the face-on mode, which can facilitate vertical charge transport in the FF-OSCs.
However, only the PTBOTz:IDIC devices showed promising PCEs; the POBOTz:IDIC devices showed poor device performance. To understand this difference in photovoltaic performance, PL emission spectra of the blend films were recorded with excitation at the wavelengths of maximum absorption of the PDs (530 nm) and the IDIC (710 nm) (Fig. 3c and d). Because PDs and IDIC have complementary absorption, the excitation at 530 nm indicates exciton generation in the polymer domain and the excitation at 710 nm implies exciton generation in the IDIC domain. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, the PTBOTz:IDIC blend film exhibited the lowest PL emission intensity at both excitation wavelengths, which means that both the PTBOTz and IDIC domains have an optimum nanomorphology for efficient exciton diffusion and separation. However, in the case of the POBOTz:IDIC blend film, PL emission quenching at 710 nm excitation was the most inefficient, which implies that IDIC forms oversized domains in the blend films. As a result, we expected the PTBOTz:IDIC blend film to have an optimum nanomorphology with sizable crystallinity for efficient charge separation, but the POBOTz:IDIC blend film to possess some aggregated domains, preventing efficient charge separation.
The nanomorphology of the blend films composed of PDs and IDIC was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3e–g). In the case of the PSBOTz:IDIC film, a highly uniform film morphology was observed. Given the less developed ordering of the PSBOTz:IDIC blend films (Fig. 4c and i), this featureless domain indicates the formation of a less efficient charge transport pathway. In the case of the PTBOTz:IDIC film, the bicontinuous domain appears without severe aggregation, which can facilitate charge separation and transport in FF-OSCs. However, the POBOTz:IDIC film started to show aggregated large-sized domains, resulting in poor photovoltaic performance and supporting the results of the PL-emission experiments.
The thermal stability of the devices was evaluated at 85 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere without encapsulation (O2, 50–60 ppm) (Fig. S15†). Notably, the PTBOTz:IDIC and POBOTz:IDIC devices exhibited much greater thermal stability than the PSBOTz:IDIC devices. The semicrystalline morphology of the PTBOTz:IDIC and POBOTz:IDIC blend films prevented the loss of the optimum nanomorphology of the active layer even in the presence of thermal stress. As a result, the PTBOTz:IDIC devices with substantial crystallinity without oversized aggregates exhibited the highest PCEs and excellent thermal stability.
Conclusions
An electron-pull building block, OTz, was synthesized via a minimized column chromatography process that includes only two short column chromatography processes using relatively cheap chemical precursors such as thiophene and 2-decanone. To evaluate the photovoltaic properties, OTz moieties were copolymerized with several BDT derivatives and three different PDs—PTBOTz, POBOTz, and PSBOTz—were developed. The simple thiazole ring resulted in a highly planar backbone structure of OTz, and all of the polymers that included the OTz moiety were semicrystalline. Notably, the PTBOTz polymer had superior absorption, hole mobility and charge separation properties compared to the other polymers. FF-OSCs were fabricated using the synthesized semicrystalline PDs and IDIC, and the PTBOTz:IDIC devices showed the highest PCE (8.32%) among the fabricated devices, along with excellent thermal stability. We found that the sizable crystallinity without severe molecular aggregation of PTBOTz:IDIC blend films improves the thermal stability as well as PCE of the devices, whereas the weak ordering of PSBOTz:IDIC and the aggregation of POBOTz:IDIC blend films deteriorated the thermal stability and photovoltaic performances of the devices, respectively.
