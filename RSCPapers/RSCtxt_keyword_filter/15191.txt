    , Accepted 21st September 2021First published on 21st September 2021AbstractThe past decade has witnessed rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of which has been rapidly boosted from the initial 3.8% to a certified 25.5%, approaching the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit for single-junction solar cells. Tandem solar cells (TSCs) have gradually attracted more attention due to their great potential to break the SQ limit by reducing the thermalization losses. Among various kinds of perovskite-based tandems, all-perovskite TSCs offer great promise with the advantages of solution processability, low cost, and flexibility. As top cells for TSCs, the wide-bandgap (wide-Eg, >1.7 eV) PSCs play an essential role in harvesting the high-energy photons and providing high open-circuit voltage (Voc) for the multi-junction TSCs, which is helpful for maintaining the stability of the bottom cell by filtering harmful ultraviolet radiation. However, both organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites and all-inorganic perovskites encounter several problems, such as the phase instability and the large Voc deficits (Eg/q − Voc), which result in inferior performance of wide-Eg PSCs. Many efforts have been made to overcome the issues and researchers have already made encouraging progress. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on wide-Eg PSCs based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites and all-inorganic perovskites, as well as their application in all-perovskite TSCs. Finally, the main challenges and perspectives are discussed.

Broader context
With the highly demanded reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, solar energy has become one of the most promising renewable energies due to its abundance and cleanness. As the third-generation photovoltaics, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting extensive attention in recent years due to their rapidly boosted power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. However, as the PCE of single-junction solar cells is limited by the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit, tandem solar cells (TSCs) offer great promise to break the SQ limit by reducing the thermalization losses. Among various kinds of perovskite-based tandems, all-perovskite TSCs offer great promise with the advantages of solution processability, low cost, and flexibility. As top subcells for TSCs, wide-bandgap (wide-Eg, >1.7 eV) PSCs play an essential role in harvesting high-energy photons and providing high open-circuit voltage (Voc) for TSCs. Here, we comprehensively present an overview of the progress in wide-Eg PSCs, including organic–inorganic hybrid ones and all-inorganic ones. Key challenges, such as phase segregation and Voc loss, have been discussed, followed by effective strategies for improving the device performance and their applications in TSCs. We finally outline perspectives of making high-performance single-junction wide-Eg PSCs to help broaden the horizons of designing superior TSCs.

1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites with the chemical formula of ABX3 (A = monovalent cations, such as Cs+, [CH3NH3]+ (MA+), [CN(NH2)2]+ (FA+); B = divalent cations, such as Pb2+, Sn2+; X = halogen anions, such as I−, Br−, Cl−) have been attracting much attention as potential photovoltaic (PV) materials in the past decade due to high absorption coefficients,1 tunable bandgaps,2 long carrier diffusion length,3 low cost and flexibility.4 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained great development from the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% to a certified PCE of 25.5%,5 approaching the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) radiative efficiency limits of ∼33% for single-junction cells.6
The construction of multi-junction tandem solar cells (TSCs), which can theoretically yield higher efficiencies than single-junction cells via mainly reducing the thermalization losses, is a viable approach to overcome the single-junction SQ limit (Fig. 1(a)).7 A TSC typically consists of a wide-bandgap (wide-Eg, e.g., ∼1.7–2.3 eV) top cell absorbing high-energy photons and a low-Eg (e.g., ∼1.0–1.3 eV) bottom cell absorbing low-energy photons,8,9 including two-terminal (2-T) and four-terminal (4-T) TSCs as shown in Fig. 1(b). The two subcells of 2-T TSCs are connected optically and electrically with an interconnection layer (ICL), while the two subcells of 4-T TSCs are processed independently and mechanically stacked together with an air gap in between.10

(c) Theoretical efficiency limit for 2-T tandems. The short-circuit current was calculated by integrating the AM1.5G spectrum assuming 100% EQE above the bandgap. The reverse saturation current was calculated from detailed balance as proposed by Shockley Queisser in 1961 assuming 100% radiative emission.

A good ICL in 2-T TSCs generally requires electrically conductive materials with high transmittance, such as ITO or ultra-thin metal Au.11 The ICL should prevent the solution from permeating the underneath top subcell to avoid the damage when fabricating the bottom subcell. For 2-T TSCs, the overall output voltage is the sum of those of two subcells, while the current is limited by the lower value of two subcells.12,13 Therefore, there is a strict restriction in the bandgap selection for the top subcell to maximize the current density and thus PCE of 2-T TSCs (Fig. 1(c)). For 4-T TSCs, the overall power is the sum of PCEs of two subcells due to the respective independence of the two subcells, and hence a broader range of bandgaps can be selected for the top subcell (Fig. 1(d)).14 Nevertheless, the theoretical efficiency limits for both 2-T and 4-T TSCs can surpass 40% when choosing a typical low-Eg absorber as the bottom subcell such as crystalline Si (c-Si), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and low-Eg perovskites.
Compared with the low-Eg bottom cell, the wide-Eg top subcell usually contributes to higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), which plays an extremely important role in achieving a high Voc for a TSC. However, the growth of high-quality wide-Eg perovskites and the fabrication of the corresponding high-performance wide-Eg PSCs are challenging but of great interest and significance to obtain highly efficient perovskite-based tandems.15
Various perovskite-based TSCs such as perovskite/Si,5,16–20 perovskite/copper zinc tin sulfur–selenium (CZTSSe),7 perovskite/CIGS,21–24 perovskite/organic photovoltaic,25–28 and perovskite/perovskite (all-perovskite),29–34 have been widely developed in recent years. In particular, all-perovskite TSCs have been attracting much interest and showing great promise to achieve high efficiencies with the advantages of solution processability, potential low cost, and flexibility.35–37
High-performance wide-Eg PSCs are essential for fabricating efficient all-perovskite TSCs. Wide-Eg PSCs usually include organic–inorganic hybrid ones and all-inorganic ones, in which the former is the most predominantly used in all-perovskite TSCs. Theoretical maximum efficiencies for wide-Eg PSCs are estimated to be ∼25%, ∼23% and ∼22% when the bandgaps are located at 1.7 eV, 1.8 eV and 1.9 eV, respectively, according to the SQ limit.38 However, the key challenges to realize highly efficient wide-Eg PSCs are to keep the perovskite phase stable and lower unsatisfactory Voc deficits. Recently, studies have confirmed that the Voc deficits are dominated by the relatively low initial radiative efficiency which stems from the nonradiative recombination loss in the absorber layer and at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface in Br-rich wide-Eg PSCs.39,40 In fact, many efforts have been devoted to investigating these problems. Since a combination of mixed FA/Cs cation and I/Br anion wide-Eg perovskites (FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3) was first reported by the Snaith group, it has become a popular wide-Eg perovskite composition.41 Tan et al. achieved an efficiency of 19.1% with a high Voc of 1.25 V for a 1.74 eV Cs0.12MA0.05FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 PSC via compositional engineering in 2018,42 and then in 2020, his group reported the 25.6% efficiency of monolithic all-perovskite TSCs,33 where the 1.77 eV top subcell reached a high efficiency of 16.4%.
As for all-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs, they also exhibit promise in TSCs owing to the suitable bandgap and excellent thermal stability. Most attention has been paid to CsPbX3 perovskites, where X is I, Br or their mixture, leading to a tunable Eg of 1.73, 1.92, 2.05, and 2.36 eV for CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2, and CsPbBr3 perovskites,43–46 respectively. Although the CsPbI3 perovskite has an ideal Eg of 1.73 eV for tandems and has demonstrated superior thermal stability, its poor α-phase stability shows unsatisfactory potential in all-perovskite TSCs, since the black phase α-CsPbI3 can only exist at high temperature (>305 °C) and is easily transformed into non-optically active yellow phase δ-CsPbI3.47,48 In spite of rapid improvement of efficiency to 20.37% by the Seok group in 2021,49–51 the development of all-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs still lags behind that of organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts in order to be applied in all-perovskite TSCs.
In this review, we summarize the recent advances both in commonly used organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs in TSCs from the aspects of material synthesis, optoelectronic properties, and strategies for improving device performance, and on all-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs (CsPbIxBr1−x) which can be conducive to conceiving multi-junction TSCs toward ultra-high efficiency and stable devices. We also provide perspectives of preparing high-performance single-junction wide-Eg PSCs to help broaden the horizons of designing superior TSCs.
2. Organic–inorganic wide-Eg PSCs
2.1 Organic–inorganic wide-Eg perovskites and solar cells
The general route of synthesizing wide-Eg perovskites is to increase the Br/I ratio in organic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskites, and the Eg of perovskites can be tuned from 1.55 to 2.3 eV, as shown in Fig. 2(a).2 Although the PSCs with a larger Eg can theoretically produce a higher Voc, it remains a big challenge to decrease the Voc deficit, defined as Eg/q − Voc, where q is the elementary charge, when the Eg gradually increases. Many reasons have been given for the large Voc deficits of wide-Eg PSCs, such as interfacial non-radiative recombination,40 bulk defects in polycrystalline perovskites,52 and the energy level mismatch between the perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) or electron transport layer (ETL).53 In this section, we present the recent progress on organic–inorganic wide-Eg perovskites and solar cells as well as discuss the strategies for further performance improvement.

2.1.1 Halide compositional engineering. 
Noh and coworkers investigated the effect of Br on the bandgap of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3, and found a quadratic relationship between the bandgap and Br content (x), revealing a tunable bandgap from 1.57 to 2.3 eV (Fig. 2(b)).2 A PCE of 12.3% was obtained at x = 0.06 for the device with a structure of FTO/bl-TiO2/m-TiO2/MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/PTAA/Au, and a more stable device was obtained at x = 0.2 with a bandgap of 1.66 eV. However, a high Voc deficit of 0.75 V greatly limited the device performance, indicating the importance of lowering the Voc deficit. Bi and coworkers developed a low-temperature solution process to achieve an efficiency of 13.1% for 1.72 eV-Eg MAPbI2.4Br0.6 PSCs via tuning the thickness, morphology, and surface passivation of the perovskite layer (Fig. 2(c)).54 Further increases in efficiency of 1.75 eV MAPbBr0.8I2.2 PSCs to 14.9% and Voc to 1.21 V were obtained by employing poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as HTL,52 attributed to enlarged grains benefited from the non-wettability of the PTAA surface (Fig. 2(d)).


2.1.2 Cation compositional engineering. 
The bandgap of the perovskites can also be tuned by partly substituting A-site cations, which has been demonstrated by replacing methylammonium (MA) with formamidinium (FA) in 2014.56 The larger organic FA cation can form a more symmetric crystal structure and improved thermal stability.57–59 The Snaith group further studied the mixed cations and mixed halide FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I(1−x)Brx)3 perovskites to achieve both high efficiency and good phase stability at x = 0.4.41Fig. 2(e) illustrates the structure of Cs, FA and MA. As shown in Fig. 2(f) and (g), the bandgap of the perovskite film gradually varied with the increase of Br/I ratio to finally determine the 1.74 eV-Eg perovskite FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, which possessed better phase stability than MAPb(I0.6Br0.4)3, resulting in a PCE of 17.1% with a Voc of 1.2 V for the n–i–p device structure.
Incorporation of additional alkali-metal cations, such as cesium (Cs) and rubidium (Rb), and some additives, also helps crystallization and phase stability of wide-Eg perovskites. Yu et al. demonstrated the synergistic effects of lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) additive and solvent annealing on the grain growth of 1.75 eV wide-Eg FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.7Br0.3)3 perovskites.60 Evidently enlarged grains were observed (Fig. 3(a)), leading to fewer grain boundaries and increased crystallinity. Therefore, a stabilized PCE of 17.18% was delivered with a high Voc of 1.25 V due to the decreased defects in the perovskites. Meanwhile, Duong et al. reported a multi-cation method by incorporating RbI into a 1.73 eV-Eg FA0.75MA0.15Cs0.1PbI2Br perovskite, leading to a steady-state efficiency as high as 17.4% and a Voc of 1.15 V, which is ascribed to improved crystallinity and suppressed defect migration in the perovskite.61 The Wong group investigated the function of benzylamine (BA) molecules by depositing the BA film on the surface of 1.72 eV FA0.15Cs0.85Pb(I0.73Br0.27)3 perovskite, leading to reduced defects at grain boundaries due to the formation of 2D BA2PbI4 (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). The passivation effect of 2D BA2PbI4 could not only prevent the film surface or grain boundaries from decomposition, but also form a cascade energy level with the underneath 3D perovskite, contributing to a champion efficiency of 18.13%.62 Soon after, Huang et al. applied an isomer ICBA-tran3 as an ETL to alleviate the energy level mismatch between wide-Eg perovskites and indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA), which is highly desirable for wide-Eg PSCs due to its higher-lying lowest-unoccupied molecular-orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 3(d)).63 Eventually, the efficiency of 1.71 eV (FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Cs0.05Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 PSCs was increased from 14.6% to 18.5% with a Voc increase by 60 mV up to 1.21 V. These strategies indicate that controlling the grain growth of the perovskites, suppressing the nonradiative recombination derived from the bulk and interfacial defects, promoting energy level matching between the perovskite absorber and charge transport layer, are very important for reducing the Voc deficits of the wide-Eg PSCs.

Zhou et al. further proved the impact of Pb(SCN)2 and boosted the PCE to 18.6% by combining Pb(SCN)2 with an appropriate ratio of FAI/FABr in the 1.72 eV perovskite precursor.64 The 1.72 eV FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.73Br0.27)3 based devices generated a high Voc of 1.244 V with a relatively low Voc deficit of 476 mV owing to the passivated grain boundaries. Tan and coworkers incorporated a dipolar cation (MA) in FA/Cs-based wide-Eg perovskite to reduce the trap density of deep energy level in mixed cation perovskites, leading to an efficiency of 20.7% with a Voc of 1.22 V for 1.65 eV Cs0.05MA0.15FA0.8Pb(I0.75Br0.25)3-based PSCs.42 When the bandgap was broadened to 1.74 eV, the Cs0.12MA0.05FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3-based device delivered a stabilized PCE as high as 19.1% with a high Voc of 1.25 V. To date, the highest PCE of 19.8% for wide-Eg PSCs has been reported by the Paetzold group via depositing n-butylammonium bromide (BABr) on Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskites to create a 2D/3D heterostructure between the HTL and perovskite absorber, which could mitigate nonradiative recombination in the perovskite absorber layer (Fig. 3(e) and (f)).65 As a result, a high Voc of 1.31 V was obtained at the bandgap of 1.72 eV, indicating that the Voc deficits for wide-Eg devices are getting closer to those for low-Eg devices. Recently, a breakthrough in decreasing the Voc deficits based on inverted 1.72 eV MAPb(I0.8Br0.2)3 PSCs was achieved by Kirchartz and coworkers via using different fullerenes and fullerene blends, and Fig. 3(g) gives the structure of several electron transfer materials (ETM) [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) and C60-fused N-methylpyrrolidine-m-C12-phenyl (CMC). They finally delivered an incredible Voc of 1.35 V with a high FF of 81.2% by blending CMC and ICBA at a weight ratio of 1:1, successfully reducing the Voc deficits down to 0.375 V.66 The effective interfacial modification is indicative of enhanced charge transfer and extraction capability, benefiting achievements of high Voc's for wide-Eg PSCs.

Table 1 summarizes various wide-Eg PSCs based on organic–inorganic perovskites, and Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the Voc or PCE and the Eg of organic–inorganic wide-Eg perovskites. Obviously, as the bandgap increases, the theoretical Voc increases, but the gap between the theoretical Voc and the actual Voc we could practically obtain is getting larger, i.e., the Voc deficit is getting larger. In contrast, the theoretical PCEs show a downward tendency with the increase of the bandgap. The gap between the theoretical PCE and the actual PCE is getting larger as well. Therefore, much more efforts are needed to minimize these gaps.

2.2 Strategies for suppressing the Voc-deficit of organic–inorganic hybrid wide-Eg PSCs
Rapid progress has been made for organic–inorganic hybrid wide-Eg PSCs in recent years, however, larger Voc deficits are still open to be overcome, which is partially ascribed to photo-induced segregation in the mixed-halide I–Br perovskites. The phase segregation in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 perovskite was first reported by Hoke et al.55 They hypothesized that photoexcitation may cause halide segregation and lead to lower-Eg I-rich minority domains, which worked as the recombination center. Furthermore, Bischak et al.68 proposed that the interaction between the lattice and photogenerated carriers could yield localized strain, likely causing the nucleation of I-rich clusters and halide phase separation. Duong et al.69 investigated the quadruple cation wide-Eg perovskites and found that the phase segregation in devices was correlated with the operating condition, which became significant at open-circuit states while negligible under short-circuit conditions, and electrical excitation can result in phase segregation even in the dark.
To reduce the Voc deficit, mitigate the photo-induced phase segregation, and improve the device performance, various efforts have been made, including compositional engineering, additive engineering, interfacial engineering, etc.

2.2.1 Compositional engineering. 
Substitution of A-site cations is considered effective to develop efficient organic–inorganic wide-Eg PSCs as confirmed computationally and experimentally.70 Cs+ is the most commonly used upon excellent work by the Snaith group.41 Owing to its smaller size, the bond angles between halide anion and metal cation (X–B–X) in BX6 octahedra were reduced, leading to an increase in the bandgap (Fig. 5(a)),71 which helped decrease the proportion of Br and further mitigate the I–Br phase segregation (Fig. 5(b)).72 The McGehee group achieved significant photostability enhancement by raising the content of Cs and meanwhile reducing the content of Br.20 Ko et al. demonstrated an interesting work by incorporating a small amount of Cs in iodide-free FAPbBr3 for 2.24 eV Cs0.08FA0.92PbBr3 PSCs, realizing a high Voc of 1.516 V and excellent device stability.73 Additionally, alkali metal ions such as K+ and Rb+ were also incorporated into perovskites to passivate the defects at grain boundaries and suppress the nonradiative recombination, which could improve the Voc of the wide-Eg PSCs.61,74

Additional organic cations have also shown similar effects. Stoddard et al. employed alloyed guanidinium (GA) to achieve highly stable (FA,GA,Cs)Pb(I,Br)3 perovskite films by suppressing nonradiative recombination, delivering a large Voc of 1.24 V for p–i–n 1.75 eV (FA0.58GA0.10Cs0.32)Pb(I0.73Br0.27)3 devices.75 The large-size GA could compensate for small-size Cs to maintain a suitable tolerance factor in perovskites, which was beneficial for stabilizing the perovskite structure. Meanwhile, the alloying of GA could increase the bandgap, thus reducing the content of Br. More recently, Moore et al.36 incorporated dimethylammonium (DMA) to form DMA0.1FA0.6Cs0.3PbI2.4Br0.6 perovskites with a bandgap of 1.7 eV, achieving a high PCE of 19.2% with a Voc of 1.2 V and negligible phase segregation. Xie and coworkers doped 10% FA in MAPb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskites, in which FA effectively facilitated the I− coordination and thus improved the film quality.76 A-site cation doping can not only stabilize the perovskite phase but also regulate the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite, which facilitates device efficiency and stability improvement.
As for B-site substitution, Sn2+ is an alternative candidate due to its appropriate ionic radius and lower toxicity.77,78 Studies on MAPb0.75Sn0.25(I1−yBry)3-based PSCs showed that the introduction of Sn2+ changed the crystallite size and lattice microstrain, the so called internal bonding environment,79 which improved the resistance to photostriction under illumination and mitigated the phase segregation in 1.73 eV MAPb0.75Sn0.25(I1−yBry)3 perovskite. Enhanced phase stability was achieved, i.e., 95% of the initial PCE remained after 30 days’ storage in an inert atmosphere.


2.2.2 Interfacial engineering. 
Interfacial engineering between charge transport layers and perovskite absorber promotes the interface quality and energy band alignment.85 A systematic work on both anode and cathode interfacial modification for 2.3 eV MAPbBr3-based devices was conducted to achieve a high Voc of 1.653 V.80 This noteworthy work focused on gaining better band alignment by utilizing MoOx and ZrO2 to reduce the Voc deficit. High work-function (WF) MoOx obtained by e-beam deposition and vacuum annealing was employed to modify the interface between the MAPbBr3 and NiOx HTL, which decreased the valence band offset between MAPbBr3 and HTL, and reduced hole loss during the extraction from the perovskite to the anode buffer layer. For the cathode side, ZrO2 grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used as a hole blocking layer due to its extremely low HOMO to reduce the carrier recombination (Fig. 5(c)). Additionally, the devices realized good stability owing to stable chemical properties of interfacial modification layers. The Huang group investigated the passivation effect of quaternary ammonium halide such as choline chloride and choline iodide, which reduced both types of defects (positively charged I− vacancy and negatively charged MA+ vacancy) (Fig. 5(d)), leading to substantial decrease in the Voc deficit and improved performance.81 Chen and coworkers recently applied phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) to treat the surface of wide-Eg perovskite and demonstrated that the arylammonium surface could raise the activation energy barrier for ion diffusion and mitigate the accumulation of ionic defects on the perovskite surface and at grain boundaries. A high Voc of 1.25 V was finally delivered with a Voc deficit of 0.48 V.86 Besides, ALD-deposited Al2O3 was also used to modify the perovskite/HTL interface and simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination.87 These charge transport materials are promising to develop high-efficiency and stable wide-Eg PSCs.


2.2.3 Mixed-dimensional engineering. 
Mixed-dimensional engineering has become popular to fabricate efficient wide-Eg PSCs.88 PEA+ and butylammonium (BA+) were proved to be ideal candidates for preparing mixed-dimensional perovskites, which could enhance the device stability.89,90 Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites usually form on the surface and at the grain boundaries of three-dimensional (3D) perovskites when a large-size organic cation such as PEA+ or BA+, is added in the precursor, and the mixed 2D–3D structure shows a positive impact on passivating the surface and the grain boundaries of perovskites, and thus mitigating the nonradiative recombination loss. Kim et al. used the combination of PEAI and Pb(SCN)2 to passivate negatively or positively charged defects, and the Voc and Jsc were promoted simultaneously (Fig. 5(e)). The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images in Fig. 5(f) showed a distinct 2D perovskite structure at the grain boundaries of 3D perovskites, which verified the passivation effect of 2D perovskites.24 Rajagopal et al. incorporated PEA+ in MAPb(I0.6Br0.4)3 (Eg = 1.80–1.85 eV) (Fig. 4(g) and (h)) to achieve high Vocs of 1.30–1.35 V and the best PCE up to 12.2%.82
BA+ has also been used to form functional self-assembled capping layers on the grain surface of perovskites, effectively suppressing the halide redistribution.91 Gharibzadeh and coworkers deposited BABr on the surface of perovskites to achieve a 2D/3D heterostructure and reduced the Voc deficit to 0.41 V.65 GABr was also applied on the perovskite absorber to generate a graded perovskite homojunction and resulted in stabilized inverted wide-Eg PSCs with a high PCE of 18.19%.92 The application of a 2D–3D mixed-dimensional structure successfully reduced nonradiative recombination loss and thus improved the device performance.


2.2.4 Additive engineering. 
Pb(SCN)2 has been proved to be an effective additive employed in organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.93 Ke et al. added a small amount of Pb(SCN)2 in MAPbI3 perovskites and proposed that CH3NH3+ and SCN− reacted and generated HSCN and CH3NH2 gases that could enlarge the grains.94 Meanwhile, the residual Pb2+ and I− formed PbI2 located at grain boundaries and passivated the perovskite layer, resulting in prolonged carrier lifetime. A combination of Pb(SCN)2 with solvent annealing led to larger grains and improved film quality.60
Liquid additive as a solvent can also affect the film quality of wide-Eg perovskites and further the device performance. Formamide (CH3NO) was used to control the crystallization process and suppress the photoinduced phase segregation as well as hysteresis.83 The highly polar solvent increased the solubility of Cs salt and helped obtain black phase of FA/Cs based mixed-halide perovskites (Fig. 5(i)) with a flattened surface (Fig. 5(j)). Singh et al. employed 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in MAPbBr3 films to change the crystallization kinetics (Fig. 5(k)) and the band alignment (Fig. 5(l)), as well as the I-rich state with less Pb, which reduced the nonradiative recombination and improved the film quality.84


2.2.5 Other strategies. 
Other strategies have also been proposed to improve the performance of organic–inorganic wide-Eg PSCs, such as manipulating crystallization by antisolvent-assisted,95 or antisolvent bath process,96 using non-stoichiometric solution precursor,97 applying a well-matched charge transport layer (CTL),18,66etc. Antisolvent processing has been well known as a universal approach to accelerate crystallization, while stirring during antisolvent bath can further improve the perovskite quality. Non-stoichiometric solution engineering has been carried out to investigate the effect of excessive MA halides on the perovskite crystallographic performance. Miyano et al. applied C60-fused N-methylpyrrolidine-meta-dodecylphenyl (C60MC12) as the ETL and achieved an enhancement in PCE and Voc, attributed to the decreased recombination loss and high-quality crystallization of the ETL.98 Some other approaches, such as controlling the process of solvent annealing,60,99 introducing robot setup for automatic synthesis and characterization,100 have also been developed, however, these methods require further exploration.

2.3 Application in all-perovskite TSCs
In recent years, both 2-T and 4-T TSCs have been widely developed by successfully applying wide-Eg perovskites as top subcells. As we know, the ICL is of extreme significance for fabricating efficient 2-T TSCs, which provides an effective charge recombination center and full protection of the existing underneath layers, leading to monolithic connection of two subcells.
In early 2016, Zhou et al. reported the first 2-T all-perovskite TSC by employing an efficient ICL of spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/PEI/PCBM:PEI, making the Voc (1.89 V) of the tandem device closer to the sum of the Voc's of both the top subcell and bottom subcell.101 However, the identical MAPbI3 absorbers used in the two subcells severely limited the current density of the overall tandem device. In the same year, Heo and Im mechanically laminated a 2.25 eV MAPbBr3 device and 1.55 eV MAPbI3 device without any interconnection layer (ICL) to produce 2-T all-perovskite TSCs.102
Later on, Snaith and coworkers made a breakthrough on making a 2-T tandem device by combining wide-Eg FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.5Br0.5)3 (1.8 eV) as a top subcell with low-Eg mixed Sn-Pb FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 (1.2 eV) as a bottom cell, achieving a PCE of 17% for a 2-T tandem cell and a PCE of 9.8% for the wide-Eg top subcell with a Voc of 1.12 V.12,103 The ITO employed as part of ICL not only protected the underlying layers from any damage during subsequent processing but also provided electrical interconnection of two subcells, resulting in good performance. Meanwhile, 4-T TSCs were also demonstrated by using a 1.6 eV FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 instead of 1.8 eV FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.5Br0.5)3 as a top subcell, delivering a stabilized PCE of 20.3%. In 2017, Rajagopal et al. promoted the Voc of ∼1.8 eV MA0.9Cs0.1Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 top subcells up to 1.22 V by compositional engineering, enabling a PCE of 18.5% for the 2-T tandem device with a remarkable Voc of 1.98 V.104
Yan and Zhao and coworkers constructed 4-T all-perovskite TSCs by combining an optimized n–i–p 1.75 eV FA0.8Cs0.2Pb(I0.7Br0.3)3 wide-Eg top subcell and a p–i–n 1.25 eV low-Eg bottom subcell.105 The insertion of paraffin oil as an optical coupling spacer between two subcells minimized the optical loss for the low-Eg bottom subcell, which led to a high PCE of 23.1%. This was also the first demonstration of all-perovskite TSCs with an efficiency exceeding that of single-junction PSCs. In late 2018, they further developed a robust ICL of Ag/MoOx/ITO/PEDOT:PSS to connect the top subcell and an improved bottom subcell by Cl incorporation to build over 21%-efficiency 2-T all-perovskite TSCs.30 Tong et al.31 demonstrated a 23.1%-efficiency 2-T all-perovskite TSC by improving the low-Eg bottom subcell performance. The doping of GASCN dramatically improved the structural and optoelectronic properties of the low-Eg perovskites, which facilitated the achievement of high-efficiency all-perovskite TSCs. Meanwhile, a 25%-efficiency 4-T all-perovskite TSC by substituting the 1.75 eV wide-Eg top subcell with a 1.63 eV one was accomplished.
To date, the record efficiency of 2-T all-perovskite TSCs was achieved by the Tan group,33 with a boosted PCE to 25.6% for 0.049 cm2 with a Voc of 2.013 V. The superior performance was attributed to the enhanced quality of low-Eg perovskites by the addition of surface-anchoring zwitterionic molecules and highly efficient ICL C60/ALD-SnO2/Au/PEDOT:PSS. These results indicate the great potential of all-perovskite TSCs in the future. Table 2 summarizes the recent advances in 2-T all-perovskite TSCs and wide-Eg (>1.7 eV) PSCs.

3. All-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs
3.1 All-inorganic wide-Eg perovskites and solar cells
With the soaring development of organic–inorganic wide-Eg PSCs, extensive interests in CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, and Cl) all-inorganic PSCs have also been growing since the elimination of labile organic groups could potentially be beneficial for thermal stability of the devices, and CsPbX3 possesses suitable bandgaps for fabricating multi-junction TSCs. However, severe phase instability of CsPbX3 such as CsPbI3 and CsPbI2Br, is a big obstacle for the advance of all-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs, mainly ascribed to the non-ideal tolerance factor for the perovskite phase. Goldschmidt tolerance factor is defined as , where rA, rB, and rX represent the ionic radii of A and B cations, and X anions, respectively. The t value between 0.8 and 1.0 is ideal to form the cubic structure (α-phase),106–109 while the t value of 0.81 for CsPbI3 (Fig. 6(a)) originating from the small size of Cs suggests its tendency to transform into an orthorhombic non-perovskite structure (δ-phase, Pnma) due to its large stabilization energy and micro-strain.110 To form the α-CsPbI3, the annealing temperature should be up to over 310 °C. Slow cooling of α-CsPbI3 at moist ambient generally results in phase transition to “yellow” δ-CsPbI3, while fast cooling can also yield “black” orthorhombic γ-CsPbI3 (Pnam) (Fig. 6(b) and (c)).111 Besides, Tetragonal β-CsPbI3 has been reported via a low-temperature process.50,112 We can learn that the phase control of CsPbI3 is strongly associated with the annealing temperature, process, and environment. To further decrease the processing temperature, more stable all-inorganic perovskites, such as CsPbI3−xBrx and CsPbBr3, have been investigated since the smaller size of Br better matches with Cs.50,112 Beal et al. comprehensively investigated the effect of varied Br content on the perovskite lattice parameter (Fig. 6(d)), bandgap (Fig. 6(e)), and phase stability (Fig. 6(f)).113 The bandgap of CsPbI3−xBrx ranges from 1.73 eV (CsPbI3) to 1.91, 2.05, and 2.36 eV at x = 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and the phase stability should improve with increased Br content. Moreover, CsPbI3−xBrx usually suffers from poor crystallization and considerable defect density. While, the bandgap of CsPbBr3 is too large (Fig. 6(g) and (h)) to harvest sufficient photons and deliver satisfactory efficiency.114–116 In this part, we discuss recent progress in all-inorganic CsPbX3-based wide-Eg PSCs and strategies for developing efficient devices.

3.1.1 CsPbI3-based PSCs. 
α-CsPbI3 PSCs were first reported by the Snaith group in 2015.49 They incorporated hydroiodic acid (HI) into the precursor solution and demonstrated a PCE of 2.9% at low phase-transition temperature (about 100 °C) via a spin-coating process in an inert atmosphere. The addition of HI caused the smaller grains and thus created a slight lattice strain, which could account for the decreased temperature of phase transition. Since then, HI has been extensively used to grow high-quality CsPbI3 perovskites. Other strategies such as new annealing routes, thermal co-evaporation, and incorporation of low-dimensional phase as well as different terminal groups, have also been proposed to stabilize the α-CsPbI3 phase and enhance device efficiency. A combination of HI and isopropanol (IPA), together with a new low-temperature route, was adopted to increase the efficiency of α-CsPbI3 PSCs in an air atmosphere.118 Meanwhile, methyl acetate (MeOAc) was used to purify α-CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) and remarkably stabilize the α-CsPbI3 phase for months when kept in ambient air.119 Frolova et al. thermally co-evaporated CsI and PbI2 to realize high reproducibility and low hysteresis of the devices.47 In 2017, Zhao et al. proposed a lower-dimensional surface modification to stabilize α-CsPbI3 PSCs via incorporating the ethylenediamine (EDA) cation into the precursor. The terminal NH3+ groups of EDA2+ were supposed to enable a uniform surface (Fig. 7(a)) and cross-link the unit cells of CsPbI3.120 The formation of 2D EDAPbI3 not only lowered the phase-transition temperature from δ-phase to α-phase, but also enhanced the electron transfer. Furthermore, the same group discovered the similar function of PEA+ (Fig. 7(b)) and promoted the PCE up to 13.5%.121 The Han group controlled the steric hindrance by adding organic terminal groups (OTGs). The octahedral tilting of [PbI6]4− was subsequently suppressed, preventing the lattice distortion and stabilizing the black phase. Moreover, the organic capping layer effectively passivated the surface defects, leading to a PCE of 13.2% for inverted planar PSCs.122

B-site substitution has also been a good choice to enhance the device performance. A small amount of Bi3+ was doped to grow CsPb0.96Bi0.04I3 perovskites and effectively decrease the grain size (less than 100 nm),110 leading to stabilized α-CsPbI3 perovskites. Similar to the effect of HI,119 the incorporation of Bi3+ in the α-CsPbI3 lattice led to microstrains, causing slight distortion of the cubic structure, which was beneficial for the transition from δ-CsPbI3 to α-CsPbI3 and the stabilized cubic structure probably due to slightly increased tolerance factor. With an inorganic HTL CuI, the device achieved a high PCE of 13.21% and retained 68% of its initial efficiency after exposure to ambient conditions for 168 h. Another breakthrough was achieved in 2018 by the Zhao group, boosting the PCE of α-CsPbI3 up to 17.06% through the phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) post-deposition process.123 PTABr acted as a bifunctional surface modifier including gradient Br doping and surface passivation, i.e., the PTA+ passivated the surface of α-CsPbI3 and enhanced its thermal stability as well as moisture resistance, whereas the Br+ resulted in the Br/I exchange reaction helping to slightly increase the grain size presumably due to the induced Ostwald ripening,124 and changed the composition into CsPbI2.95Br0.05. The corresponding mechanism is schematically illustrated in Fig. 7(c). Fig. 7(d) shows that PTABr post-treatment improved the film stability. Soon after, a spectacular work was demonstrated by the same group to obtain efficient β-CsPbI3-based devices.112 An interface modifier of choline iodine (CHI) was utilized to not only fill the “cracks” and passivate the surface, but also make better band alignment between the perovskite and TiO2 layer (Fig. 8(a)). Ultimately, the device delivered an outstanding PCE of 18.4% with an improved Voc of 1.11 V (Fig. 8(b)). The state-of-the-art PCE of γ-CsPbI3-based PSCs was further realized by the same group in 2019, pushing the record efficiency up to 19.03% with a high Voc of 1.137 V in a n–i–p device structure.50 They comprehensively investigated the effects of dimethylammonium iodide (DMAI), which has been in debate in recent years.125 It has been recently confirmed that DMAI works as an additive to manipulate the crystallization by forming intermediate phase (Fig. 8(c)) and generate compact morphology with larger grains. It appears that the phase stability is independent of grain size. Moreover, the PTACl surface modifier increased the efficiency from 16.62% to 19.03% (Fig. 8(d)). Furthermore, a record PCE of 20.37% was reported by Seok and coworkers through a sequential dripping of methylammonium chloride (MACl) solution (SDMS) and octylammonium iodide (OAI) passivation along with a crystallization-regulation process (Fig. 8(e)).51 A dense surface morphology was obtained with enhanced crystallinity after SDMS treatment, leading to an improved Voc of 1.2 V. More importantly, the removal of volatile DMAI and MACl contributed to an all-inorganic composition of CsPbI3 without any organic components, evidenced by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results and absorption spectra.

3.1.2 CsPbI3−xBrx-based PSCs. 
CsPbI3 possesses an ideal bandgap of 1.73 eV for tandems, however, it is hard to stabilize the “black” phase at room temperature. Thus, the Br-substituted CsPbI3−xBrx perovskites with adjusted bandgap to ∼1.8 eV tend to be more attractive for all-perovskite TSCs due to their lower annealing temperature and better phase stability.
In 2016, Beal and coworkers first reported CsPbI2Br PSCs by incorporating 33% Br in the CsPbI3 lattice through a solution process and obtained a stabilized PCE of 6.5% with an inverted planar architecture.113 Soon after, the Snaith group adopted a one-step solution process with the addition of HI in the precursor, and further promoted the PCE up to 9.8% in a mesoporous architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbI2Br/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag.45 However, an unsatisfactory Voc of 1.11 V suggested a large Voc deficit. Besides the solution process, all-vacuum deposition was also employed to fabricate as-measured 1.82 eV CsPbI2Br PSCs with the advantages of high reproducibility and great uniformity. Precisely controlling the film thickness and stoichiometric ratios of the precursors enabled a promising stabilized PCE of 11.5%, close to their champion efficiency of 11.8%.126
Later on, several excellent works reported CsPbI2Br-based PSCs with efficiencies exceeding 12% in 2018 via low-dimensional engineering, interfacial engineering. The Liu group proposed dimensionally graded heterojunctions by sequentially depositing 3D bulk-2D nanosheet (NS)-0D QDs CsPbI2Br material on the substrate (Fig. 9(a) and (b)), to reduce the recombination loss during the hole extraction process and enhance the built-in electric field.127 A Voc of 1.19 V was thus obtained and the PCE reached 12.39%. The same group also demonstrated a halide-ion-profiled CsPbI2Br/CsPbI3 QD heterojunction with optimized thickness of CsPbI3 QDs to achieve suitable band alignment for improved carrier collection, obtaining a PCE of 14.45% (Fig. 9(c)).128 On the basis of that, this group further studied the relevance between crystallization and precursor solution temperature, and boosted the PCE to 14.81% at a fixed solution temperature of 100 °C.129 The idea of graded energy alignment was adopted to form a (CsPbI2Br)1−x(CsPbI3)x intermediate layer for better charge transport (Fig. 9(d)) in a device configuration of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/(CsPbI2Br)1−x(CsPbI3)x/spiro-OMeTAD/Au.130 A noticeable Voc of 1.32 V was obtained together with a high PCE of 15.5%. The concept of a gradient was even applied in the annealing process of CsPbI2Br films, in which IPA was utilized as a green antisolvent and gradient thermal annealing was adopted (i.e. 50 °C for 1 min, 100 °C for 1 min, and 160 °C for 10 min) to control the crystal growth of CsPbI2Br, achieving a PCE of 16.07%.114

Modification of the perovskite surface facilitates defect passivation and energy level alignment for good charge transport and extraction. In 2019, the Yang group took advantage of the soft nature of perovskites to develop a surface-induced secondary grain growth (SISG) technique.131 With this method, they deposited oleylammonium (OLA) on the CsPbI2Br surface to improve the perovskite film quality. A high PCE of 16.58% was achieved with a Voc of 1.23 V. You et al. used lithium fluoride (LiF) as an insulated shunt-blocking layer to passivate the SnO2/CsPbI3−xBrx interface (Fig. 10(a)) and applied lead chloride (PbCl2) as an additive to stabilize the black phase of CsPbI3−xBrx.132 As a result, the 1.77 eV-CsPbI3−xBrx device achieved a high PCE of 18.64% with a high Voc of 1.25 V, indicating a reduced Voc deficit of 0.52 V. The Zhu group employed GA+ on a similar composition of 1.74 eV-CsPbI3−xBrx perovskite to form a self-organized 2D/3D multidimensional perovskite top interface via reaction with unsaturated Pb,133 which suppressed the interfacial defects and protected the absorber against moisture. Compared with the two-step interfacial passivation (TIP), this spontaneous interfacial manipulation (SIM) method protected the underlying perovskite surface from potential damage (Fig. 10(b)). Finally, a high PCE of 18.06% was obtained with a Voc of 1.27 V, indicating a low Voc deficit (Fig. 10(c)).

To further stabilize the perovskite phase and pursue a lower phase transition temperature, increasing the ratio of Br− ions in CsPbI3 is one of the effective methods via a variety of deposition methods. In 2016, CsPbIBr2 based PSCs were initially investigated via a dual-thermal evaporation process and obtained a PCE of 4.7% without a HTL.44 Ho-Baillie et al. applied a spray-assisted deposition of CsPbIBr2 film and obtained a stabilized PCE of 6.3% after optimizing the substrate and annealing temperature.134 An ultra-thin MoOx layer also worked well as a cathode buffer layer to offer better energy level alignment and reduce the Schottky barrier,135 resulting in improved thermal stability at 160 °C. In terms of the wide-Eg CsPbIBr2 perovskites, Liang et al. utilized an organic-free device architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2/carbon, in which the CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2 film possessed a more suitable bandgap of 1.79 eV, realizing an efficiency of 11.33% with an impressive Voc of 1.25 V.136 The device also showed improved stability, retaining 85% of its initial PCE after exposure to ambient air for 50 h. A similar approach of fabricating 1.78 eV-CsPb0.75Sn0.25IBr2 devices was also demonstrated with a slight increase in PCE up to 11.53%.137
Large Voc deficits of wide-Eg all-inorganic PSCs originating from high intrinsic trap density and inherent nonradiative recombination losses impel researchers to exploit effective solutions. Yang et al. reported dye molecule-assisted engineering by depositing the dye of 5,15-[bis(2,6-dioctoxyphenyl)-10-(bis(4-hexylphenyl)-amino-20-4-carboxyphenylethynyl)porphyrinato]zinc(II) (YD2-o-C8) on the surface of hot (∼80 °C) CsPbIBr2 film.138 Thanks to the bifunctional effect (as a co-sensitization layer and interfacial passivator) of YD2-o-C8, the perovskite possessed a broadened absorption spectrum, and a reduced Voc deficit was obtained with a PCE of 10.13% and a record Voc of 1.37 V. More recently, the same group deposited an inorganic Sb2S3 layer acting as an interfacial modifier between the ETL (TiO2) and CsPbIBr2 to suppress the I− migration due to the S–Pb interaction of Sb2S3 and CsPbIBr2, resulting in a high Voc of 1.33 V.139 Toward the high-quality perovskites, Hao and coworkers presented a flux-mediated crystal growth strategy through incorporating MABr into the precursor film, serving as a flux agent to evidently enlarge the grain size and facilitate the crystallization of CsPbIBr2 at a relatively low temperature (200 °C), resulting in a record high PCE of 10.82% with a Voc of 1.32 V.140


3.1.3 CsPbBr3-based PSCs. 
An effective strategy to suppress phase segregation and yield stable perovskites even under ambient conditions is to develop all-Br inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites. In 2015, Hodes et al. compared n–i–p CsPbBr3 cells with their organic MAPbBr3 counterparts.43 The PCEs of the CsPbBr3 PSCs reached 5.95% and thermal stability was obviously improved. Soon after, they further increased the efficiency up to 6.2% for the devices of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/PTAA/Au.141 In order to retain the advantageous stability of CsPbBr3-based PSCs, unstable organic HTL and noble metal electrodes were replaced by a carbon electrode by Liang et al.,117 exhibiting that the 6.7%-efficiency device kept its initial efficiency without performance degradation for 3 months (2640 h) under dark conditions of 90–95% relative humidity at 25 °C without encapsulation.
The Tang group also carried out a series of excellent studies via interfacial engineering in the following years. Charge transport and extraction were enhanced by using carbon quantum dots (CQDs), phosphorus quantum dots (PQDs), CuInS2/ZnS QDs and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) to modify the interfaces of TiO2/CsPbBr3 or CsPbBr3/carbon in the device structure of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon, leading to the continuous improvement of PCE up to 9.72%.142–146 Tang et al. deposited a thin layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) composites to enhance charge separation and reduce energy loss at the CsPbBr3/Carbon interface, delivering a high PCE of 10.03% with a Voc of 1.578 V.147 Jiang et al.148 improved the PCE slightly to 10.17% by introducing CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6, two derivative phases corresponding to the CsPbBr3. The processes are depicted in Fig. 11(a) according to the following mechanism:CsBr + PbBr2 → CsPbBr3CsPbBr3 + PbBr2 → CsPb2Br5CsBr + 2PbBr2 → CsPb2Br5CsPbBr3 + 3CsBr → Cs4PbBr64CsBr + PbBr2 → Cs4PbBr6The concept of a gradient bandgap of CsPbBr3/CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5/CsPbBr3–Cs4PbBr6 was also adopted owing to the increase in bandgaps of CsPbBr3–CsPb2Br5 and CsPbBr3–Cs4PbBr6, leading to enhanced stability, i.e., the devices in a humid environment (RH ∼45%) and under thermal conditions (∼100 °C) could maintain 85% of their initial PCE for 3000 h and 83% of their initial PCE for 700 h, respectively (Fig. 11(b)). Furthermore, the same group conducted a follow-up work by utilizing phase-transition-induced recrystallization.149 CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 and CsPbBr3@Cs4PbBr6 were firstly deposited on the substrate via a sequential vapor process, followed by a thermal annealing process and thus induced phase transition (Fig. 12(a)), enabling the formation of highly crystalline CsPbBr3 film through crystal rearrangement, enlarged grain size, and passivated grain boundaries. The highest PCE of 10.91% (Fig. 12(b)) was obtained together with enhanced stability, i.e., the device kept 90% of its initial performance after exposure to 45% relative humidity for 2000 h in the dark without encapsulation (Fig. 12(c)).

In view of the unfavorable Voc deficit, some efforts have been made to overcome the problems. The Tang group have contributed to outstanding works in this aspect.150 They constructed a configuration of FTO/SnO2 (QDs)/CsPbBr3/CsSnBr3 (QDs)/carbon, yielding a high PCE of 10.6% with a remarkable Voc of 1.61 V. Ionic liquid of 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride ([BMMIm]Cl) was introduced to act as a modification layer between CsPbBr3 and the carbon electrode.151 The crystallization temperature of PbBr2 was precisely adjusted to remove the stress-induced grain boundaries along with the pinhole-induced shunts. A combination of high-quality CsPbBr3 perovskite and nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) enabled a high Voc of 1.622 V and a PCE of 10.7%.152 Inserting a 2D WS2 nanoflake at the ETL/perovskite interface further improved the Voc to a recorded 1.7 V due to the release of the interfacial strain.153

3.2 Strategies for improving the performance of inorganic wide-Eg PSCs

3.2.1 Compositional engineering. 
Partially substituting Pb2+ with metal ions with smaller size is a good way to better match with smaller Cs+ and improve the phase stability. Thus far, a number of metal ions such as Mn2+, Bi3+, Na+, Ca2+, In3+, Yb3+, and Sn2+ have been incorporated in CsPbI3 perovskites.110,154–159 Liang et al. synthesized a CsPbI3:Br:InI3 perovskite via introducing a two-step doping method.154 The incorporation of Br− and InI3 suppressed defects associated with I and Pb species, respectively, while the bandgap was kept the same as that of CsPbI3, and thus the device achieved a PCE of 12.04% with a remarkable Voc of 1.2 V. It is worth mentioning that the encapsulated device showed no deterioration under the ambient conditions for over two months. Xi et al. utilized H2PbI4 to facilitate the doping of Mn2+ into the lattice of CsPbI3 quasi-nanocrystals, because iodide ions from H2PbI4 may be coordinated with Pb2+ to avoid PbI2 precipitation. Consequently, the p–i–n structured device delivered a champion PCE of 13.4%, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 500 h of storage in air.157
Similar strategies have also been applied in mixed-I/Br (CsPbI1−xBrx) and all-Br (CsPbBr3) inorganic perovskites. Ge2+, Zn2+, Nb5+, Ni2+, Sr2+, Sn2+, and In3+ have been recently used to replace the part of Pb2+,136,137,160–169 while Cs+ is partially substituted with Li+, K+, and Rb+.170–172 Zn2+ was added to synthesize high-quality CsPb0.9Zn0.1I2Br perovskites, in which Zn2+ affected the crystal growth, enlarged the crystallite size, and passivated the grain boundaries.165 The Yang group directly incorporated CuBr2 into a perovskite precursor to retard the crystallization process, leading to a high-quality CsPbI2Br perovskite with decreased trap state density, enlarged grain size, and enhanced charge mobilities.115 A champion PCE of 16.15% was achieved and the device retained 95% of the initial efficiency after 1 month aging in ambient at room temperature without encapsulation. Partial substitution of Pb2+ with Sn2+ forming CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2 perovskite produced a more optimal bandgap of 1.79 eV and a significant enhancement in device stability.136
Recently, many efforts have been devoted to investigating the lattice doping of lanthanide ions (Ln3+), which effectively enlarges the grain size and reduces the charge recombination. The Tang group systematically studied the influence of Ln3+-doping, in which Ln3+ ions include La3+, Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Yb3+, and Lu3+. All-Br-inorganic devices with an FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Sm0.03Br3/carbon architecture exhibited a high efficiency of 10.14% with a Voc of 1.594 V.173 Tb3+ incorporation further improved the PCE to 10.26% by optimization.174 The mechanisms of divalent hard Lewis acids including Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ in CsPbBr3 perovskites were investigated.169 Suppressed point defects and larger crystal size were observed in CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 perovskite films, leading to a maximum PCE of 9.63% for the CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 device, and the unencapsulated CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 device maintained 95% of the initial efficiency after 800 h aging in the dark under 80% humidity conditions.


3.2.2 Additive engineering. 
Since the HI additive was first introduced, it has become indispensable for stabilizing the black-phase of CsPbI3 perovskites.49 Uddin et al.175 thoroughly optimized the concentration of HI at the best value of 36 μL mL−1, which significantly improved the crystallinity and optoelectronic properties of α-CsPbI3, leading to a PCE of 6.44%. It is found that the introduction of HI actually triggered the formation of HPbI3 or HPbIx, allowing lower-temperature phase transition for attaining black-phase CsPbI3.157,176 While, more recently, a further study claimed that the HI reacts with dimethylformamide (DMF) and then generated dimethylamine hydroiodide (DMAI), working as an additive.125 However, the roles of DMAI in all-inorganic perovskites are still under debate. Zhao and coworkers developed a systematic investigation to clarify that the DMAI acted as an additive instead of a dopant.50 They proposed that the DMAPbI3 intermediate perovskite was first formed and the DMAI would sublimate in the following annealing process. Meanwhile, the Cs+ had its place in the crystal lattice, leading to the black-phase CsPbI3. A high PCE of 19.03% was presented as aforementioned in Section 3.1.1. Besides, some ammonium salts (e.g., urea-ammonium thiocyanate (UAT), NH4I) are also beneficial for improving the device performance.177,178
Thiocyanates such as Pb(SCN)2 and NH4SCN exhibit positive impacts in all-inorganic perovskites, similar to that in organic–inorganic counterparts. It is reported that the pseudo halide SCN− acts as a dopant to be incorporated into the lattice and improve the device performance, whereas it is also presented that Pb(SCN)2 or NH4SCN works as an additive.179 Ye et al. found that the remaining Pb(SCN)2 located at the grain boundaries and pinhole sites, functioned on the deep trap states caused by I interstitial and Pb vacancies.180 Consequently, disordered crystal growth of CsPbI2Br would be effectively retarded, leading to uniform and homogeneous perovskite films. A champion PCE of 12.22% was achieved via a low-temperature process. A synergistic effect of NH4SCN as an additive on CsPbBr3 perovskite was proposed.181 In addition to the positive effect of SCN−, NH4PbI3 could be formed through the reaction of NH4+ and PbI2 at the early stage, which was considered beneficial for heterogeneous nucleation and suppression of defects. An enhanced PCE of 8.47% was yielded compared with that of the control group of 7.12%.
More recently, acetates such as Pb(Ac)2, CsAc, Eu(Ac)3, etc.,182–187 have been regarded as effective additives to improve the perovskite film quality. Wang et al. reported high-efficiency CsPbI2Br-based PSCs by using Co(Ac)2 to modulate the crystallization kinetics,186 resulting in the formation of uniform and defect-free perovskite films by significantly retarding the crystallization process. It was proposed that the Ac− would be extruded from the grain boundaries along with grains growing at an annealing temperature of 270 °C according to the Ostwald ripening mechanism. Finally, the device achieved a PCE of 15.04% with a high FF of 80.46%. CsAc could stabilize α-CsPbI2Br.183 Moreover, it was found that Ac− at the grain boundaries could passivate and reduce the defects. The Liu group adopted an Eu(Ac)3-doping strategy by partially substituting Pb2+ with Eu3+ to stabilize the α-phase, and the Ac− anions were expected to coordinate with CsPbI2Br, adjusting the crystal growth and surface morphology.182 As a result, high-quality perovskite films resulted in a superior efficiency of 15.25% as well as an improved Voc of 1.25 V, indicating mitigated energy losses.
Besides the aforementioned strategies, some soluble additives such as levulinic acid,188 4-aminobenzoic acid,189 and ascorbic acid have also been applied to fabricate high-performance PSCs.190 The Tang group introduced melamine into the PbBr2 precursor to retard the crystallization rate of CsPbBr3via a multistep solution process.191 Furthermore, the melamine could effectively passivate the defects and contribute to better energy level alignment between perovskite absorber and charge transport layers. A PCE of 9.65% with a remarkable Voc of 1.584 V was achieved. The Liu group developed a n-type doping method by adding CaCl2 to CsPbI2Br perovskite precursor.192 The addition of a very small amount of CaCl2 additive not only enabled a high-quality perovskite with prolonged carrier lifetime and reduced defect density, but also raised the Fermi level, providing a better energy level matching and increasing the built-in potential. A noticeable Voc of 1.32 V was consequently achieved, leading to a record PCE of 16.79%. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintained 90% of its initial efficiency after 1080 h storage in the dark under 25% relative humidity ambient. Recently, the same group proposed a facile additive strategy by incorporating sulfamic acid sodium salt (SAS) into CsPbIBr2 perovskite,193 leading to high-quality perovskites with optimized morphology and reduced defects were obtained. More importantly, additional inherent electric field was possibly introduced by the sulfamic acid ions located on the perovskite crystal surface and Na+ distributed at the TiO2/perovskite interface, enabling enhanced electron transport and injection as a result of heterogeneous ion distribution.


3.2.3 Interfacial engineering. 
Surface post-treatment and interfacial modulation are currently applied on both organic–inorganic and all-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs due to effective passivation on the surface trap state and aligned energy levels. Various organic and inorganic modifiers have been reported.132,194–199 For organics, some polymer materials are considered as promising candidates. Yin et al. applied a polymer poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) passivator on the CsPbI3 surface.194 As reported, the acylamino groups of PVP induced an enhancement of electron cloud density on the surface, and thus decreased the surface energy and enabled stable cubic CsPbI3, leading to a PCE of 10.74% with a Voc of 1.11 V. The Liu group adopted a new conjugated polymer poly(N-alkyldiketopyrrolopyrrole dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thio-phene) (DPP-DTT) to passivate the CsPbI2Br surface.198 High mobility and suitable HOMO (−5.31 eV) of DPP-DTT between the HOMO of perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD enabled more efficient hole extraction. Besides, coordination between the atoms with lone-pair electrons in DPP-DTT and Pb atoms suppressed the surface defects and reduced the nonradiative recombination. More importantly, DPP-DTT also worked as an ultra-hydrophobic agent to enhance the moisture resistance. A competitive PCE of 15.14% with a Voc of 1.29 V was achieved for CsPbI2Br PSCs with a normal structure. Cao et al. modified both the cathode and anode by applying an amino-functionalized polymer (PN4N) and poly[5,5′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylate-alt-5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene] (PDCBT) as an interlayer, respectively.197 In terms of energy level matching, PN4N induced the interfacial dipole at the cathode and thus decreased the work function (WF) of SnO2. On the other hand, PDCBT with a deeper-lying HOMO enabled a better energy level alignment at the anode and consequently increased the Voc. Passivated surface traps and mitigated halide segregation could be mainly ascribed to the strong interaction between PN4N, PDCBT, and the perovskite layer. Moreover, PN4N with a more hydrophobic surface contributed to larger grain size and improved crystallinity of the perovskite. Finally, a high PCE of 16.2% with a remarkable Voc of 1.3 V was obtained for CsPbI2Br PSCs. Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) polymer was employed to passivate the CsPbBr3/carbon interface and benefit the energy level alignment.195 Additionally, a graphene oxide (GO) layer was further inserted to promote the hole extraction efficiency and reduce the energy barrier, leading to a PCE of 9.53% with an appreciable Voc of 1.55 V.
In addition to organic polymers, other organic materials have also been used to realize the interfacial engineering. The Dai group employed p-phenylenediammonium iodide (PPDI) to post-treat the CsPbI3 film, so the interaction between NH3+ of PPD2+ and I− of [PbI6]4− could prevent the spontaneous octahedral tilting and passivate the surface defects.200 Cesium acetate (CsOAc) in methyl acetate (MeOAc) engineered the m-TiO2/QD interface and inhibited the incorporation of α-CsPbI3 QDs into mesoporous TiO2, resulting in a high PCE of 14.32% for QD-based CsPbI3 PSCs.201 Hayase et al. systematically investigated the effects of imidazolium iodide (IAI) and aminothiazolium iodide (ATI, sulfur-contained) with a delocalized π-electron system on the CsPbI2Br perovskite films.202 ATI reduced the surface trap states and suppressed trap-assisted recombination due to the direct coordination between the sulfur atoms in delocalized π-electron ATI molecules and the perovskite surface, which passivated the halide ions or Cs+-induced defects. The CsPbI2Br devices delivered a high efficiency of 13.91% with an unsatisfactory Voc of 1.185 V. We speculated that imperfect band alignment between the perovskite and the charge transport layer was one of the reasons for large Voc deficits. Recently, Wang et al. post-treated CsPbI2Br film by using 4-bromobenzylamine hydriodate (BrBeAI), which not only facilitated the hole extraction but also partially permeated into the perovskite bulk and passivated the defects on the grain boundaries.203 Thus, an enhanced PCE of 14.63% was achieved.
Various inorganic materials including 2D materials, 3D inorganic layers, inorganic perovskites with gradient energy band or derivative phases, and QDs have been widely employed in all-inorganic PSCs. 2D black phosphorous (phosphorene, BP) engineered the interface between CsPbI3 and CuSCN HTL.204 By tuning the number of layers, the multi-layer BP as efficient dielectric screening improved the exciton dissociation efficiency and the carrier density. A combination of 2D Nb2O5(001) nanosheets (c-Nb2O5 NS) with PCBM formed a bilayer ETL, benefiting the achieved PCE of 11.74% for inverted CsPbI2Br PSCs.205 The Jiang group inserted 2D Ti3C2-MXene NS into CsPbBr3 PSCs as an interlayer.206 The optimized devices delivered a PCE of 9.01% with a Voc of 1.444 V. In addition to 2D inorganic materials, inorganic layers such as ultra-thin MoOx,135 Sb2S3,139 ALD-TiO2,207 Cu(Cr,Ba)O2,208 KOH,209 SmBr3,210 CsBr,211 and CsBr clusters have been used to modify the interface of ETL/perovskite or perovskite/HTL,212 which contributed to a better energy band alignment and reduces the surface traps. Inspired by lanthanide-doping, the Liu group incorporated SmBr3 to modify the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface, in which SmBr3 permeated into the perovskite bulk and thus formed a gradient bandgap layer.210 Hence, the modification of SmBr3 restrained the interfacial recombination and meanwhile inhibited the nonradiative recombination in the CsPbIBr2 bulk, leading to a high PCE of 10.88% for CsPbIBr2 PSCs. KOH can also engineer the SnO2/CsPbI2Br interface in carbon-based CsPbI2Br devices,209 where K+ impeded the halide ion migration and suppressed the formation of vacancy defects, resulting in enhanced stability and a PCE of 11.78%.
Another promising strategy to engineer the interface is to form intermediate perovskites with gradient bandgap or derivative phase.127 The Tang group deposited CsPbBrxI3−x nanocrystals (NCs) on the CsPbBr3 for tuning the energy levels and facilitating charge extraction.213 For CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 perovskites, integrating the derivative phases such as CsPb2Br5, Cs4PbBr6,148,149,214–216 and Cs4PbI6 with CsPbBr3 or CsPbI3 to fabricate a gradient heterojunction has been proved to be beneficial for growing large grains and highly crystalline films,217 as well as reducing the interfacial recombination losses. It is worth noting that the 0D Cs4PbI6 could even act as a molecular lock to stabilize the 3D CsPbI3.217 Again, inorganic QDs such as carbon QDs, phosphorus QDs, and CuInS2/ZnS QDs play similar roles in interfacial passivation and energy alignment as discussed in Section 3.1.3.


3.2.4 Others. 
Promoting the quality of all-inorganic perovskite films is the key to delivering high-efficiency and stable PSCs. A variety of methods to control the growth process have been demonstrated.114,178,184,218–221 You et al. developed a solvent-controlled growth by slowing down the evaporation rate of DMSO and gained enhanced quality of a CsPbI3 perovskite.46 The Nazeeruddin group introduced (adamantan-1-yl)methanammonium to realize a soft template-controlled growth for highly crystalline and large-grain CsPbI3.220 A light-processing method enabled uniform and pure-phase CsPbIBr2 films.219 A preheated-substrate was prepared to accelerate the volatilization of a solvent molecule, leading to full coverage and improved crystallinity of CsPbIBr2 perovskite films.218 Carefully adjusting the precursor temperature also facilitated preparation of a thick CsPbI2Br with larger grains.129 Lewis base adducts PbI2(DMSO) and PbBr2(DMSO) were applied to retard the crystallization process of CsPbI2Br films,222 resulting in a smooth perovskite surface with low density of defects.
Engineering on charge transport materials is considered a promising way to promote the charge extraction in all-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs including exploring new ETM or hole transport materials (HTM), and ameliorating the electrical or optical properties by doping or using different preparation methods. For the ETM, ZnO and SnO2 become desirable substitutes for conventional TiO2 due to their high electron mobility and low-temperature process. Nevertheless, further modulations have been implemented to enhance their performance. A small amount of NH4Cl was introduced into the ZnO precursor derived from sol–gel solution, leading to decreased WF for better energy level matching and optimizing the surface morphology of CsPbIBr2 films with low trap state density.223 Cs2CO3 added into ZnO precursor induced favorable interface energetics between the ETL and CsPbI2Br layer and thus reduced the Ohmic loss.224 MgZnO ETM formed by incorporating Mg2+ into ZnO possessed a suitable bandgap and low interface recombination loss at the MgZnO/CsPbI2Br interface.225 The work function of SnO2 could be decreased by a short-period deep-ultraviolet (DUV) process to offer better energy alignment.226
In addition, some new ETMs such as In2S3227 and Nb2O5,228 have also been reported to deliver high-efficiency all-inorganic wide-Eg PSCs.229,230 Taking the negative effects of dopants into account,231 dopant-free HTMs become more attractive. Inspired by organic solar cells (OSCs), Ma et al. introduced PTB7 and PTB7-Th HTMs in α-CsPbI3 QD-based PSCs to achieve preferable band alignment,232 resulting in a high Voc of 1.28 V with a low Voc deficit of 0.45 eV. Li and coworkers polymerized squaraines (SQs) into pseudo 2D p–π conjugated polymers which significantly improved the hole mobility and showed well-matched energy levels as well as efficient passivation effects.233 A series of dopant-free organic HTMs were developed such as dopant-free D–A–D type HTM (YN3), 9,9-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-substituted fluorene-based HTMs comprising H (YT1), and methoxyphenyl-fluorene (YT3) for improved device performance,234,235 compared with that with spiro-OMeTAD. Additionally, inorganic materials, e.g., tailored NiOx nanocrystalline films and Co3O4, could also enhance the charge-extraction capability and long-term stability.236,237
2D/3D perovskite alloying using organic cations EDA+,120 PEA+,121,238,239 BA+,240 and GA+, have also been applied on CsPbI3 and CsPbIxBr3−x all-inorganic PSCs in which the mechanisms are similar to that in their organic–inorganic counterparts.

3.3 Applications in TSCs
Toward stable all-perovskite TSCs, adopting all-inorganic PSCs as top subcells appears to be promising to enhance the overall device stability and even efficiency owing to the excellent thermal stability and ultraviolet (UV)-light stability of all-inorganic perovskites. Thus far, no works have been reported on all-perovskite TSCs with all-inorganic top subcells. Instead, studies on combining OSCs with inorganic PSCs to construct TSCs have been carried out, which validates the potential as all-inorganic top subcells in tandem devices. The Ding group demonstrated a 2-T TSC by using CsPbI2Br perovskite as a top subcell and PTB7-Th:COi8DFIC:PC71BM organic absorber as a bottom subcell.241 A thin layer of Au was deposited to modify the ICL; however, the photocurrent of the tandem cell is still lower than those of both single-junction cells due to more photocurrent loss probably caused by the parasitic absorption of ICL. Meanwhile, wide-Eg CsPbI2Br PSCs (1.92 eV) delivered a relatively high Voc and excellent stability, resulting in a PCE of 15.04% with a Voc of 1.71 V for tandem cells. Moreover, the efficiency of the tandem device showed negligible degradation after being stored in a N2-filled glovebox for 30 days. Cao and coworkers further boosted the PCE of monolithic inorganic perovskite/organic TSCs to over 18% with an optimized device structure of ITO/ZnO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/poly 5,5′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylatealt5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene (PDCBT)/MoO3/Ag/ZnO/BHJ/MoO3/Ag. Benefiting from an outstanding HTM PDCBT, single-junction CsPbI2Br PSCs delivered a Voc of 1.27 V with a high FF of 84.79% and the 2-T device achieved a summated Voc of 1.95 V.242 Chen et al. devised a 4-T tandem configuration to overcome the UV-light instability of OSC by adopting a semitransparent CsPbBr3 PSC as a UV-light filter.27 Benefiting from its good stability against UV-light, the PCE of the resulting tandem cell remained more than 98% of the initial value after 120 h of UV irradiation (100 mW cm−2), indicating that such a facile approach can effectively address the issue of the UV-light instability of OSCs.
Although the development of single-junction all-inorganic PSCs grows rapidly, the investigation on wide-Eg all-inorganic PSC-based all-perovskite TSCs is still lacking, which might be imputed to the complex multilayer preparation process, especially stabilizing the black-phase CsPbI3 perovskites or suppressing the phase segregation of CsPbI3−xBrx perovskites. Besides, the relatively large Voc deficits of wide-Eg all-inorganic PSCs limit their competition against their organic–inorganic counterparts. In a word, it is highly desired to make more effort in promoting the performance of all-inorganic PSCs toward their application in TSCs.
4. Stability of wide-Eg perovskites and solar cells
Increasing the ratio of Br/I will broaden the bandgaps of organic–inorganic wide-Eg perovskites, but photo-induced phase segregation becomes an inevitable issue. As reported, the ion migration rate (rm) is related to activation energy EA, described as rm ∝ exp(−EA/kBT), where kB represents the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.243 Since the EA is sensitive to ionic radius, the lattice mismatch with different radii of Br and I possibly causes stronger ion migration observed in the mixed halide perovskites. Especially under illumination, the photoexcitation tends to trigger the halide segregation into lower-bandgap I-rich domains and Br-rich domains, while the former is supposed to be the recombination center, which could account for reduced Voc's.55,244
Aiming to alleviate the phase segregation, substituting the A-site organic cations with Cs+ to develop all-inorganic perovskites shows promise. It is confirmed that Cs substitution could stabilize the perovskite films with high Br content. Beal et al. revealed that, in contrast to MA-based perovskites with the Br/I ratio of 0.2 suffering from phase segregation,72 CsPb(BrxI1−x)3 perovskites maintain good photostability even at a Br/I ratio of up to 0.4. Owing to reduced polarizability and softness of Cs compared with MA and FA, the addition of Cs enables a more rigid lattice which is conducive to phase stability.68 However, α-CsPbI3 perovskites have a disposition to convert to inactive phase due to a small size of Cs+ as discussed earlier. Therefore, in terms of the composition of perovskite bulk, balancing the ratio of Br/I and doping elements with matched radii are of particular importance to enhance the moisture stability and thermal stability.
The stability of PSCs is correlated with many aspects including perovskites themselves, ETMs, HTMs, electrode, the interface quality between different layers, device configuration, and encapsulation. Many efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of ETMs/HTMs or seeking new materials as aforementioned. Research has also been focused on organic-free devices via using Nb2O5 as the ETM,230 NiOx as the HTM, or carbon as both the HTM and electrode. More recently, self-assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules have received extensive attention due to their stability properties.18,245 Additionally, appropriate encapsulation of the devices is another effective and reliable method against the moisture and the decomposition of perovskites. Table 7 summarizes the recent advances in stability of wide-Eg PSCs.

5. Conclusions and outlook
Rapid development of single-junction and multi-junction PSCs has been realized in the past few years. Further improvement in both device efficiency and stability is in high demand, which has been pushing the study on multi-junction solar cells to the research frontier since the tandem architecture has been regarded as an effective approach to break the SQ limit of single-junction solar cells. Among various perovskite-based tandems, all-perovskite TSCs exhibit advantages of flexibility, potential low cost, and low-temperature fabrication, in which wide-Eg PSCs are crucial for achieving ultra-high-efficiency all-perovskite TSCs. In this review, we have comprehensively summarized the progress of both organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic wide-Eg (>1.7 eV) perovskites and devices, offering great promise as top cells in all-perovskite TSCs.
Enhancing both the efficiency and stability of wide-Eg PSCs guarantees achievements of highly efficient all-perovskite TSCs. Therefore, considerations of reducing Voc deficits, suppressing phase segregation, constructing multiple-junction TSCs, etc, should be seriously taken. We illuminate the main points and perspectives in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Illumination of the main points and perspectives of wide-Eg perovskites and their applications. 
5.1 Improving the Voc and PCE (single-junction wide-Eg cells)
Large Voc deficits primarily originate from nonradiative recombination losses in the bulk of wide-Eg perovskite and at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface. (i) Growing high-quality light harvesters with high crystallinity and low intrinsic defects is effective to largely prolong the carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths via facile and universal fabrication processes. Positively or negatively charged defects such as ion vacancies, interstitials and surface dangling bonds or ligands, are often considered as recombination centers, and proper passivation treatments are indispensable for reducing intrinsic defects in the perovskite bulk and at interfaces. (ii) Doping CTLs can tune their energy levels to be suitable to better match with those of wide-Eg perovskites, leading to reduction of charge carrier losses at interfaces. (iii) Optical management such as light trapping and antireflection coating could obviously enhance the Jsc due to the usage of a relatively thin wide-Eg perovskite layer in TSC PSCs.
So far, research has only focused on one or partial issues, leaving other issues unsolved, thus it is preferred to take all aspects of optical, electrical and thermal factors into account to improve the efficiency of wide-Eg PSCs in the following study.
5.2 Building multiple-junction cells
A combined TSC of PSC and OPV has advantages in terms of flexibility and reduction of Pb usage.242 Organic–inorganic hybrid wide-Eg perovskites are more suitable as a top absorber for double-junction TSCs or as a middle absorber for triple-junction TSCs. Fabricating monolithic triple-junction TSCs toward higher PCEs is another attractive potential of all-inorganic perovskites, which could mainly be attributed to their suitable bandgaps, excellent thermal stability, and UV-resistance as a top absorber. McGehee and Snaith and coworkers conducted a simulation to discuss the feasible performance of monolithic multi-junction TSCs,246 as shown in Fig. 15. With a fixed 1.22 eV perovskite as a bottom absorber, it is indicated that a wide-Eg top perovskite ranging from 1.95 to 2.05 eV is possible to construct an ideal configuration of triple-junction TSCs with a PCE exceeding 33%. The bandgaps of CsPbI2Br (∼1.92 eV) and CsPbIBr2 (∼2.05 eV) exactly meet the requirement, implying a huge untapped potential toward multi-junction TSCs. In 2019, experimental work confirmed the feasibility of triple-junction TSCs.247

5.3 Enhancing stability
Attention should be paid more carefully to intrinsic factors that lead to perovskite decomposition or segregation, and charge losses during transport and collection, while the extrinsic sensitivities can be addressed by proper encapsulation and packing. (i) High-temperature instability can be mitigated by compositional substitution of organic cations with inorganic species. In order to eliminate the vulnerable organic parts in perovskites, all-inorganic perovskites with various components have attracted much interest. More importantly, abundant strategies such as controlling the crystalline process, ameliorating the annealing process, improving the quality of the interface and modulating the energy level alignment, etc. have been proposed and paved the way for further research. The concept of “all-inorganic” can be extended from the perovskite layer to the entire devices, denoted as organic-free devices. (ii) Charge accumulation could lead to phase segregation in high Br-containing perovskite bulk and interfaces, therefore, well-matched energy band alignments and efficient charge transfer are highly desired. ALD-deposited SnO2 and NiOx greatly show the potential of superior device stability over their organic counterparts. (iii) Post-treatments that simultaneously reduce surface defects and improve the hydrophobic properties are promising to enhance the device performance and moisture tolerance. Multi-dimensional tailoring with highly stable 2D perovskite shells or cover layers are necessary protocols currently in improving the stability of perovskite materials. For all-inorganic perovskites, phase transition related to lattice distortion is a detrimental factor that should be fixed with element substitution and lattice matching. (iv) As for the metal electrode, the combination of Cr/Au or Cr/Cr2O3/Au replacing typical Au, Ag, and Cu can eliminate the diffusion of metal ions that would severely affect the device stability. An alternative is to employ a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrode, likely leading to improved stability and realizing a bifacial tandem configuration.
5.4 Scaling up the module
A large-area fabrication process should be mastered, which is equally important to efficiency and stability for commercial applications.248 Thermal evaporation and sputtering techniques, used to prepare charge transport layers and electrodes, are compatible with large-area processes. The success of blade-coating and slot-die coating methods in the preparation of perovskite films in single-junction large-area PSCs and modules shows a direction to prepare large-area all-perovskite TSCs.249,250 However, achievement of 2-T all-perovskite TSC modules remains a big challenge, due to the existence of the conductive interconnection layers (usually TCO or a thin layer of metal), which easily cause shorts when interconnecting the subcells. The breakthrough of a simplified interconnection layer is highly demanded, enabling the ease of making all-perovskite TSC modules.
Currently, flexible and portable electronics, semitransparent or colorful building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), as well as concentrating photovoltaics (CPV) are considered new pathways.251 The successful large-scale fabrication process of single-junction PSCs moves a step forward for the future application in high-performance TSCs. Moreover, the CPV technique is also considered as one promising method for the future application of TSCs taking the benefits of high performance; however, the corresponding concentrating optical system and cooling system still require more effort.

Broader context
With the highly demanded reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, solar energy has become one of the most promising renewable energies due to its abundance and cleanness. As the third-generation photovoltaics, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting extensive attention in recent years due to their rapidly boosted power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. However, as the PCE of single-junction solar cells is limited by the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit, tandem solar cells (TSCs) offer great promise to break the SQ limit by reducing the thermalization losses. Among various kinds of perovskite-based tandems, all-perovskite TSCs offer great promise with the advantages of solution processability, low cost, and flexibility. As top subcells for TSCs, wide-bandgap (wide-Eg, >1.7 eV) PSCs play an essential role in harvesting high-energy photons and providing high open-circuit voltage (Voc) for TSCs. Here, we comprehensively present an overview of the progress in wide-Eg PSCs, including organic–inorganic hybrid ones and all-inorganic ones. Key challenges, such as phase segregation and Voc loss, have been discussed, followed by effective strategies for improving the device performance and their applications in TSCs. We finally outline perspectives of making high-performance single-junction wide-Eg PSCs to help broaden the horizons of designing superior TSCs.

(c) Theoretical efficiency limit for 2-T tandems. The short-circuit current was calculated by integrating the AM1.5G spectrum assuming 100% EQE above the bandgap. The reverse saturation current was calculated from detailed balance as proposed by Shockley Queisser in 1961 assuming 100% radiative emission. (d) Theoretical efficiency limit for 4-T tandems, calculated with different subcell thicknesses, each picked to optimize the performance for each bandgap combination. The red, blue and purple dash lines present the predicted PCE at their corresponding bandgaps of Si, CIGS, and low-Eg perovskites, respectively.
