    , Accepted 24th November 2010First published on 17th December 2010AbstractThe organic redox mediator tetramethylformaminium disulfide/tetramethylthiourea was evaluated in dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells, as an alternative to the conventional I3−/I− redox couple. Devices were optimized by judicious variation of electrolyte composition and selection of sensitizing dye. The best performance of the dye-sensitized solar cells incorporating this redox mediator was achieved by using a metal-free indoline-based sensitizer (D131). It was found that conventional ruthenium based sensitizers (e.g. Z907) exhibited inferior performance, possibly as a result of an insufficient driving force for sensitizer regeneration. A near unity incident photon-to-collected-electron conversion efficiency was achieved at low light intensity for optimized devices. The overall light-to-electric power conversion efficiency under AM 1.5 1 Sun illumination reached 3.88%. This represents an increase of ca. 25% compared with previously reported DSCs using this redox mediator. Factors limiting cell performance were further investigated using transient absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Broader context
The growing need for clean, sustainable, and secure energy sources is rapidly becoming a global concern. The total annual energy consumption by humankind in a year is comparable to the quantity of solar radiation falling upon the earths surface in one hour. Dye-sensitized solar cells are widely regarded as one of the most promising photovoltaic energy conversion devices being researched today. A key component of these solar cells is the redox shuttle in the electrolyte, which usually consists of the triiodide/iodide couple. Disadvantages associated with triiodide/iodide, such as large free energy loss of dye regeneration, visible light absorption and corrosiveness towards most metals, have prompted the search for alternative redox mediators. Here we report a detailed characterisation of a recently discovered iodine-free redox mediator: tetramethylthiourea and its disulfide dimer. Despite larger molecular sizes compared with triiodide/iodide, mass-transport limitations are unlikely to impact upon device performance under normal operating conditions. We also find that switching from a standard ruthenium-based sensitizing dye to an all-organic indoline-based dye results in a dramatic improvement of photocurrent generation efficiency, and consequently overall power conversion efficiency.

I. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 employing the I3−/I− redox couple have reached overall solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies in excess of 11%.2 Despite its successes, the I3−/I− couple has a number of disadvantages which limit both the practicality and the maximum efficiency of DSC using this redox mediator.3 The most obvious disadvantage is the substantially negative redox potential of the I3−/I− couple relative to the HOMO levels of commonly employed ruthenium-based sensitizing dyes. It has recently been found that a driving force of only 0.15 eV is sufficient for the fast regeneration of some organic sensitizers,4 making the energy difference of 0.6 eV between the HOMO levels of standard ruthenium sensitizers and the redox potential of I3−/I− seem excessive. Since the difference between the conduction band minimum of the TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte determines the maximum obtainable photovoltage for a DSC,5 using an alternative redox couple with a more positive redox potential (approaching that of the HOMO levels of the dye) to maximize photovoltage, while still ensuring fast dye regeneration to avoid geminate charge recombination, is highly desired. Another disadvantage of the I3−/I− couple is the significant absorption of light in the blue part of the spectrum by I3−, which leads to additional photocurrent losses. A practical issue relating to use of the I3−/I− couple is that it is corrosive to many metals, preventing the straightforward application of metal (e.g. stainless steel) substrates for the photoanode or cathode in DSCs.6
Due to these intrinsic problems, substantial efforts have been made to replace the I3−/I− couple with redox mediators possessing more desirable thermodynamic, optical and chemical properties. Several promising redox mediators have been reported; ferrocene/ferrocenium,7 CoIII/II polypyridyl complexes,8 copper complexes,9 pseudohalogens (i.e. (SeCN)2/SeCN−, (SCN)2/SCN−),10 co-mediators,11 TEMPO+/TEMPO,12 and NiIV/III complexes,13which have all shown varying degrees of success. However, problems still exist that limit the feasibility of these redox couples replacing the conventional I3−/I− couple, such as the inefficient dye regeneration of pseudohalogen redox couples, mass transport limitations of large metal complexes, and unacceptable carrier recombination with the fast outer-sphere redox systems such as ferrocene/ferrocinium, TEMPO+/TEMPO, and NiIV/III complexes.
One exception is the disulfide/thiolate couple reported by Grätzel and coworkers,14 with the performance rivalling that of I3−/I−. In common with the I3−/I− and pseudohalogen couples, the redox reaction requires the transfer of two electrons,15–17 which is expected to lead to slower recombination kinetics compared with outer sphere, one electron couples such as ferrocene/ferrocinium. More recently two new analogous redox couples have been discovered — tetramethyl formaminium disulfide/tetramethylthiourea (TMFDS2+/TMTU) and 2-mercapto-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole and its disulfide dimer (McMT/BMT).18,19 Compared with the disulfide/thiolate and the McMt/BMT couples, the TMFDS2+/TMTU couple possesses a more positive redox potential than I3−/I− and, at the concentrations and path lengths relevant to functioning DSC, almost negligible visible light absorption, which in theory should render better photovoltage and photocurrent in devices. Meng and coworkers report a reasonably high efficiency of 3.1% under AM 1.5 1 Sun illumination for DSCs employing this redox mediator and the N3 sensitizer. TMFDS2+/TMTU has also been shown to be non-corrosive towards metals which are of interest for use as substrate materials in DSC.18
In this paper, we further evaluate and characterize in detail TMFDS2+/TMTU for use as redox mediator in DSCs and report an increase in device efficiency. We find DSC performance using this redox mediator is significantly improved by switching from a conventional ruthenium bypyridyl sensitizer to an indoline-based organic sensitizer. We show that the performance difference may be due to an insufficient driving force for sensitizer regeneration for the case of conventional ruthenium bipyridyl sensitizers, while sensitizer regeneration does not appear to be so inefficient for the indoline-based sensitizer, which possesses a more positive HOMO level.
II. Experimental methods
A. Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received.
The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes used in this work were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO, Pilkington TEC-15) cut into 1.5 × 2.5 cm pieces and cleaned by sequential sonication in 5% Decon 90 solution, distilled water, propan-2-ol and absolute ethanol. Electrodes were then soaked in a 40 mM solution of TiCl4 in distilled water (prepared by dilution of a 2 M stock solution which was prepared at ca. 0 °C) for 30 min at 80 °C. After rinsing in distilled water and drying a 12 μm layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 was deposited by successive screen printing using a TiO2 paste prepared using P25 powder (Degussa) and a modification of a previously reported procedure.20 A 2 μm layer of larger (ca. 400 nm) TiO2 particles (WER-O paste, Dyesol) was then deposited on top of the P25 layer to increase light scattering in the TiO2 layer. The FTO/TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated to 450 °C where they were held for 15 min before being heated to 500 °C for a further 15 min. Electrodes were subjected to a second identical treatment in TiCl4 solution, rinsed, dried and heated to ca. 450 °C in a hot air stream for 30 min. Once the electrodes had cooled to ca. 100 °C they were immersed into a 0.15 mM solution of sensitizer (either Z907 or D131) in 1:1 acetonitrile:tert-butanol and left overnight before being removed and rinsed in acetonitrile immediately before cell assembly.
Platinized counter electrodes were fabricated on identical pieces of FTO with small holes drilled into one corner. After cleaning, a thin layer of Pt was deposited onto the FTO by thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid. Carbon black (CB)(VULCAN XC72, Cabot) coated counter electrodes were fabricated by screen printing using a mixed TiO2/CB paste which was ca. 6 wt% TiO2 (Degussa P25) and 10 wt% CB in α-terpinol.
Photoanodes and counter electrodes were sealed together in a sandwich configuration using a hot-melt polymer (Surlyn, DuPont). The inter-electrode space (ca. 25–50 μm) was filled with an electrolyte by vacuum back-filling. Holes were sealed using a small piece of hot-melt polymer and a microscope coverslip. Electrolytes were all 3 M TMTU, 0.3 NOBF4 (expected to oxidize TMTU to TMFDS2+), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.2 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile unless stated otherwise. Reference cells were fabricated with an electrolyte consisting of 1 M propylmethylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and 0.5 M N-methylbenzimidazole.
B. Characterisation techniques
Incident photon-to-collected-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with a spectral resolution of ca. 5 nm using a 300 W Xenon lamp and a grating monochromator equipped with order sorting filters (Newport/Oriel). The incident photon flux was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport/Oriel). Photocurrents were measured using an auto-ranging current amplifier (Newport/Oriel). Control of the monochromator and recording of photocurrent spectra were performed using a PC running the TRACQ Basic software (Newport).
Current–voltage characteristics under simulated AM 1.5 illumination were measured using a Keithly SourceMeter and the PVIV software package (Newport). Simulated AM 1.5 illumination was provided by a Newport class A solar simulator and light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si reference cell.
The thickness of nanocrystalline TiO2 layers was determined by profilometry measurements made using an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler. Absorption spectra of 100 fold dilute electrolyte solutions were measured using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer.
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using a three-electrode cell and either an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat controlled by the Nova 1.5 software package or an Ivium CompactStat. The working electrode was a nominal 10 μm diameter Pt ultramicroelectrode (UME), the auxiliary electrode was a platinum wire, and the reference electrode was Ag/Ag+. All electrolyte solutions contained 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte. Electrochemical redox potentials of electrolyte solutions were measured versus Ag/Ag+ by potentiometry using a Pt wire. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat and the Nova 1.5 software package. EIS experiments were performed under illumination provided by a green LED (λ = 530 nm) while the cell was biased at the open-circuit photovoltage induced by the illumination. Different illumination intensities were achieved using neutral density filters mounted in an automated filter wheel system (Newport) which was controlled by the Nova 1.5 software. The highest light intensity used was sufficient to produce an open-circuit photovoltage approximately equal to that obtained under simulated AM 1.5 1 Sun illumination. A 10 mV RMS voltage perturbation was used and the frequency range was 105–0.1 Hz.
III. Results and discussion
The electrochemical behavior of TMTU was investigated at a platinum disc electrode. Fig. 1a shows cyclic voltammograms recorded at scan rates in the range 2–0.05 V s−1, and the corresponding differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The first peak in the DPV provides an estimate of the potential where TMTU starts to become oxidized. A second sharp peak can also be observed, indicating a subsequent electron transfer process, probably resulting in the formation of TMFDS2+. The reduction peak in the cyclic voltammogram indicates the process where TMFDS2+ is reduced back to TMTU.

Bolzan et al. have studied the electrochemistry of aqueous TMTU solutions at Pt and Au electrodes. These authors propose the likely electrochemical reactions involved in the electroxidation of TMTU are15,17  
Since the solvent is not postulated to play any chemical role in the reactions in this aqueous system, it seems reasonable to assume the same reaction mechanism in the present acetonitrile solutions. According to their studies, the overall reaction rate is determined by diffusion of TMTU in the bulk solution towards TMTU+ adsorbates on the platinum electrode surface. Based upon this reaction mechanism we attribute the first peak in the DPV (which can be observed as a shoulder in the cyclic voltammogram) to the oxidation of TMTU to TMTU+, and the second peak to further oxidation to form TMFDS2+.
Based on the radius of the TMFDS2+ chloride salt estimated from crystallographic data,16 the diffusion coefficient of TMFDS2+ in acetonitrile calculated using the Stokes–Einstein relation is of the order of 6.74 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. The TMFDS2+ diffusion coefficient derived from fitting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data for symmetric Pt–Pt thin-layer cells containing a TMTU-based redox electrolyte was found to be 9.11 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 (ESI†). The diffusion coefficient of TMTU was determined to be 1.83 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 by steady-state voltammetry at a Pt ultramicroelectrode (ESI†).21 This value is more than the average value found for TMFDS2+, probably caused by the difference in hydrodynamic radius between TMTU and TMFDS2+ (which consists of two TMTU+ species linked by an S–S bond). These diffusion coefficients are of the order of those reported for I− and I3− ions in acetonitrile.22 The concentrations of TMTU and TMFDS2+ in our electrolytes are also similar to those of I− and I3− used in typical electrolytes. Therefore, for the electrolyte compositions discussed here, no limitation of DSC performance arising from slow mass transport is expected under normal operating conditions.
Since the redox couple is electrochemically irreversible (cf.Fig. 1a) it is not trivial to determine the standard potential, E0, from the cyclic voltammograms or DPV experiments. For this reason the redox potential, Eredox, of an actual electrolyte solution was measured vs. Ag/Ag+ by potentiometry using a Pt wire electrode. The redox potential of an electrolyte consisting of 1.35 M TMTU and 0.075 M TMFDS2+ in acetonitrile was found to be −0.10 V vs. Fc+/Fc (0.53 V vs. NHE assuming Fc+/Fc to be 0.63 V vs. NHE).23
A small difference between the redox potential of this solution and the standard potential for this redox couple is expected based on the ratio of oxidized to reduced species present in solution. Assuming activity coefficients of unity, the standard potential calculated from the Nernst equation is 0.57 V vs. NHE, which is 0.22 V more positive than that of the I3−/I− couple (0.35 V vs. NHE).3 Therefore, on purely thermodynamic grounds, an increase in open-circuit photovoltage would be expected for DSCs using the TMFDS2+/TMTU redox couple compared with DSCs using the I3−/I− redox couple. The calculated standard potential for TMFDS2+/TMTU (indicated in Fig. 1a by a dashed line) lies close to the common cathodic and anodic current onset potential which can be observed in the cyclic voltammograms at all scan rates, indicating that the current onset potential is a reasonable estimate of the standard potential in this case.
Poor photovoltaic performance was obtained for DSCs employing the TMFDS2+/TMTU redox couple in conjunction with the standard sensitizer Z907 (vide infra). This may be due to an insufficient driving force for regeneration of the oxidized sensitizer by TMTU as the oxidation potential of the electrolyte lies only ca. 0.36 V above the HOMO of the Z907 (determined to be ca. 0.3 V vs. Fc+/Fc by the cyclic voltammograms shown in Fig. 1b),24 compared to ca. 0.58 V for the conventional I3−/I− couple. However, the overall regeneration reaction requires the transfer of two electrons (for both I− and TMTU), and is likely to proceed via an inner-sphere mechanism. It is therefore possible that any difference in the kinetics of regeneration of Z907 by TMTU or I− is not solely caused by differences in the thermodynamic driving force for the reaction.25 To overcome the possible regeneration problem we have used an alternative sensitizer, D131. The HOMO level of this sensitizer, whilst adsorbed on TiO2, was determined to be ca. 0.57 V vs. Fc+/Fc (1.20 V vs. NHE) by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (Fig. 1b). The driving force for regeneration of D131 by TMTU is calculated to be 0.63 V, therefore it is thermodynamically likely that the regeneration process will be efficient. Indeed, it is found that device performance is significantly improved when using this sensitizer.

Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent density-voltage (j–V) characteristics of DSCs using a TMTU-based electrolyte with Z907 and D131 sensitizer. Both Pt and CB coated counter electrodes were used for DSCs employing TMTU-based electrolytes to evaluate the impact on device performance. The j–V characteristics of DSCs using the conventional I3−/I− electrolyte and Pt coated counter electrodes are also shown for comparison. The photovoltaic parameters for these DSCs measured under 1 and 0.1 Sun illumination are listed in Table 1. With the Z907 sensitizer, DSCs employing TMFDS2+/TMTU-based electrolytes show much worse performance than those using the I3−/I− electrolyte, regardless of the counter electrode used, which indicates that the low currents and poor fill factors for these DSCs are probably due to an insufficient driving force for dye regeneration as discussed earlier. For the D131 sensitizer, efficiency is significantly higher than for the Z907 sensitizer when using the TMFDS2+/TMTU-based electrolyte, this is probably due to the larger driving force for dye regeneration.

Interestingly, an average open-circuit photovoltage (based on 4 devices) of 815 mV with a standard deviation of 5 mV is achieved for the DSC with a TMTU-based electrolyte, D131 and a Pt counter electrode, yet for the DSC with a CB counter electrode an average VOC of only 771 mV, with standard deviation 16 mV, is achieved. The difference in VOC is even more pronounced under 0.1 Sun illumination (ca. 60 mV). This runs counter to the conventional understanding that VOC should be independent of the counter electrode material. VOC values for cells with CB counter electrodes are less reproducible, as shown by the slightly higher standard deviation in the mean. We assume the differences in VOC may be due to the mechanical instability of the CB layers, which were found to be less well adhered to the FTO substrate compared with our porous TiO2 layers. It seems reasonable that some carbon particles may contaminate the TiO2 layer during sealing or filling the cell with electrolyte. If so, this contamination may act as recombination sites which shunt the cell, lowering VOC, fill factor, and possibly jsc. It is speculated that if a superior counter electrode can be found, giving a reasonable fill factor while maintaining the same VOC and jsc achieved using Pt-coated cathodes, a substantial efficiency gain (based upon the data in Table 1 a maximum efficiency of >6.0% is predicted) is expected. Work to this effect is currently underway in our laboratory.
The transmission spectra for 25 μm thick layers of TMFDS2+/TMTU and I3−/I− electrolytes (calculated from absorption coefficient data) are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that at these concentrations and path lengths, light absorption by the TMFDS2+/TMTU is negligible for λ > 370 nm, whereas the I3−/I− electrolyte absorbs strongly for λ < 520 nm. The absorption coefficient spectra of the D131 and Z907 sensitizers adsorbed on TiO2 are also shown in Fig. 3.

It is clear that the absorbance of the TMFDS2+/TMTU electrolyte does not interfere with light absorption by either sensitizer. The negligible light absorption by TMTU is expected to bring about a modest improvement in photocurrent for the normal substrate–electrode illumination geometry (provided sensitizer regeneration and charge collection do not limit performance) and significant gains for electrolyte–electrode illumination, which is of importance for DSCs fabricated on, for example, opaque metal substrates.
The IPCE spectra for DSCs employing I3−/I− and TMFDS2+/TMTU electrolytes are shown in Fig. 4. The photocurrent onset wavelength for DSCs using the D131 sensitizer is found to be shorter than that of the reference DSCs employing the Z907 sensitizer. This leads to some photocurrent losses in the red part of the spectrum and can be attributed to insufficient light absorption by the sensitizing dye in this wavelength region (cf.Fig. 3). The peak IPCE for DSCs employing the Z907 sensitizer and TMTU-based electrolyte is significantly lower than that for DSCs using the I3−/I− electrolyte. As mentioned already, it is possible that this is due to insufficient driving force for regeneration of the oxidized dye molecule.

Also shown is a typical substrate transmission spectrum (dash–dot line). 
The shape of the IPCE spectra below 500 nm for DSCs using I3−/I− and TMFDS2+/TMTU electrolytes are quite different when using Z907 (Fig. 4a). As already mentioned, this is due to significant absorption of light by the I3−/I− electrolyte, while light absorption by the TMFDS2+/TMTU electrolyte is negligible (cf.Fig. 3). This shows that if other factors could be optimized, photocurrent gains relative to I3−/I−-based electrolytes could be expected using a sensitizer with a similar absorption spectrum to Z907. Light absorption by I3−/I− has a less pronounced effect on the IPCE spectrum for DSCs using D131 because this sensitizer has a much higher absorption coefficient than Z907 (cf.Fig. 3) so that absorption by I3−/I− is almost negligible over the path length required for D131 to absorb most of the incident light.
When using the TMFDS2+/TMTU electrolyte and D131 sensitizer, the IPCE saturates at ca. 80%, which is close to the limit imposed by the transmission of the substrate (a typical substrate transmission spectrum is shown in Fig. 4b), for λ < 520 nm. This near unity quantum yield indicates highly efficient charge separation and charge collection at the low light intensities used to make the IPCE measurements. The short-circuit photocurrent predicted by convolution of the IPCE spectrum (Fig. 4b) and the AM 1.5 spectrum for a DSC employing D131 and a TMTU-based electrolyte is 9.1 mA cm−2. This value is slightly lower than the experimental values which fall in the range 9.2 to 10.8 mA cm−2, although the difference is probably within the composite experimental errors of the IPCE measurement and the j–V measurement.
Since it has already been shown that the IPCE saturates at close to the substrate transmission for strongly absorbed wavelengths, it can be inferred that under AM 1.5 1 Sun illumination at short-circuit, charge separation and charge collection are highly efficient. If this were not the case the measured short-circuit photocurrent ought to be lower than that predicted from the IPCE measurement.
To gain further insight into the reason for the poor performance of DSCs employing Z907 and a TMTU-based electrolyte, sensitizer regeneration rate has been monitored by transient absorbance spectroscopy.

Fig. 5 shows absorbance decay traces for the oxidized form of Z907 (monitored at 650 nm following excitation at 532 nm) in the presence of the I3−/I− and TMTU-based electrolytes used for device fabrication. The time constant for the decay of the oxidized form of Z907 is 4.8 μs in the presence of an I− electrolyte, while it is about 3 times longer, 13.7 μs, in the presence of a TMTU electrolyte. This result shows that sensitizer regeneration by TMTU is slower than by I−. Similar experiments were performed for the D131 sensitizer but no transient absorbance could be detected in the wavelength range 560–750 nm using our experimental apparatus. The reason for this is unknown, although it may be due to the either too small an absorbance change being induced by the laser pulse (comparable to the noise level), or because regeneration occurs so rapidly it is beyond the time resolution of our measurement system (ca. 1 ns).

In order to investigate whether sensitizer regeneration may limit the performance of devices employing D131 and TMTU-based electrolytes under 1 Sun illumination, devices were fabricated with varying TMTU concentrations, while keeping the concentrations of other electrolyte components constant. The maximum TMTU concentration used was 2.7 M, which is very close to the saturation limit in acetonitrile (further material could not be dissolved and if a small amount of solvent was allowed to evaporate crystals of TMTU were observed to form in the solution). Fig. 6 shows a plot of short-circuit photocurrent under 1 Sun illumination versus TMTU concentration. jsc appears to be close to saturation for [TMTU] = 2.7 M, which is another indirect indication that sensitizer regeneration is efficient under short circuit conditions.

Fig. 7 shows representative EIS spectra for DSCs with a TMFDS2+/TMTU electrolyte and either a Pt or a CB counter electrode. EIS data obtained for cell voltages < 0.75 V were complicated and required at least 3 RC circuits to be adequately fitted. Interpretation of these spectra is deemed to be beyond the scope of the present paper. EIS data obtained at high cell voltages (≥0.75 V) can be adequately fitted by the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7. The first RC circuit represents the counter electrode/electrolyte interface and the second RC circuit represents the TiO2 electrode. The fitted values of counter electrode charge transfer resistance (RCE) for Pt electrodes are greater than 200 Ω, which is over ten times larger than typical values found for Pt electrodes used in conjunction with I3−/I− electrolytes.

Measurements were performed under open-circuit conditions with VOC = 785 mV. 
This large charge transfer resistance is at least partly responsible for the very low fill factors obtained for DSCs using TMFDS2+/TMTU electrolytes and Pt counter electrodes. The arc due to charge transfer at the counter electrode for CB electrodes is significantly smaller, with fitted values of RCE of the order of 2–4 Ω. Unsurprisingly, such a dramatic decrease in RCE results in greatly improved fill factors (cf.Table 1).
In both EIS spectra, no Warburg-like feature (associated with electron diffusion in the TiO2 layer)26 is observed. The spectra are rather semicircular and do not resemble a Gerischer impedance, which implies an electron diffusion length greater than the TiO2 layer thickness (ca. 16 μm). However, the exact magnitude of electron diffusion length cannot be determined from these data. For λ < 520 nm the absorption coefficient of D131-sensitized TiO2 (Fig. 3) is very high, and the absorption length, 1/α, is less than 2 μm. Therefore, given that the electron diffusion length is likely to be greater than the TiO2 layer thickness for these DSCs, charge collection is expected to be highly efficient, a conclusion which is consistent with the high IPCE obtained for λ < 520 nm (Fig. 4b).
Achieving significant kinetic asymmetry of interfacial charge transfer, with much faster dye regeneration compared to backward recombination (the geminate recombination with oxidized dye and backward reaction with oxidized redox species), for efficient charge separation and collection, is the key to have viable redox mediators for DSC. The success of I−/I3− has been found to be a result of the unique two-electron process and the sluggish interfacial charge transfer of the intermediates with electrons in TiO2. The intermediates involved in the rate-determining step have been detected to have a much more negative potential (approaching the conduction band edge of TiO2), which reduces the over-potential of the backward reaction. In addition, as I3− is negatively charged, the electrostatic repulsion between electrons in TiO2 and I3− in electrolyte further hinders the fast recombination process.3 While a more detailed study is required to investigate the kinetics of the rate-determining step, the kinetic asymmetry of the TMFDS2+/TMTU couple seems to be ascribable to the two-electron process, which plausibly results in a very slow interfacial charge transfer process despite the positively charged oxidized species TMFDS2+. Compared with the simple and rigid molecular structures of halogens and pseudohalogens, which constrains redox potential tuning by modifying their structures, the new disulfide and its analogues provide vast flexibility in attaching different substituents to achieve the desirable thermodynamic, optical and chemical properties for DSCs.
IV. Conclusions
DSCs employing the TMFDS2+/TMTU redox mediator exhibiting power conversion efficiencies of 3.88% under simulated sunlight were fabricated. It has been shown that charge separation and charge collection are highly efficient in these DSCs at short-circuit under AM 1.5 1 Sun illumination. When using the Z907 sensitizer with the TMTU electrolyte poor performance is obtained which may be a result of inefficient sensitizer regeneration. The superior performance of the DSCs employing TMTU and D131 may be due to faster dye regeneration kinetics, although our data cannot rule out the possibility that the improved performance is due to slower recombination of TiO2 electrons with oxidized D131, compared to Z907. Photocurrent in these devices is predominantly limited by the rather poor overlap of the sensitizing dye absorption spectrum with the solar emission spectrum. It is expected that use of a sensitizer with an absorption spectrum better matched to the solar spectrum would lead to significant photocurrent gains. However, it must be borne in mind that tuning sensitizer absorption to harvest more long-wavelength photons necessarily involves either raising the HOMO levels or lowering the excited state levels of the sensitizer. This may be accompanied by a decrease in sensitizer regeneration yield or electron injection yield as a result of decreasing thermodynamic driving forces for these processes. The fill factor of devices with Pt electrodes is limited by sluggish charge transfer to TMFDS2+. Using CB coated electrodes partly solves this problem, however fill factors are consistently lower than those obtained using I3−/I− electrolytes in conjunction with Pt counter electrodes. Analysis of EIS data suggests that the charge transfer resistance associated with CB electrodes should not limit fill factor. However, as the mechanical stability of the CB electrodes used in this work was sub-optimal, further gains in efficiency can reasonably be expected if higher quality CB electrodes can be developed.

Broader context
The growing need for clean, sustainable, and secure energy sources is rapidly becoming a global concern. The total annual energy consumption by humankind in a year is comparable to the quantity of solar radiation falling upon the earths surface in one hour. Dye-sensitized solar cells are widely regarded as one of the most promising photovoltaic energy conversion devices being researched today. A key component of these solar cells is the redox shuttle in the electrolyte, which usually consists of the triiodide/iodide couple. Disadvantages associated with triiodide/iodide, such as large free energy loss of dye regeneration, visible light absorption and corrosiveness towards most metals, have prompted the search for alternative redox mediators. Here we report a detailed characterisation of a recently discovered iodine-free redox mediator: tetramethylthiourea and its disulfide dimer. Despite larger molecular sizes compared with triiodide/iodide, mass-transport limitations are unlikely to impact upon device performance under normal operating conditions. We also find that switching from a standard ruthenium-based sensitizing dye to an all-organic indoline-based dye results in a dramatic improvement of photocurrent generation efficiency, and consequently overall power conversion efficiency.
