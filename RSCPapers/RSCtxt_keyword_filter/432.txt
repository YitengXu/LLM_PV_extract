PiITVT-based polymer solar cells exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 7.09%, which is higher than that of PiI2T (5.55%), because of the better coplanar structure of the TVT unit than the 2T unit.

Broader context
Low bandgap conjugated polymers based on a donor–acceptor (D–A) structure are an emerging class of donor materials for high performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Molecular design and synthesis of conjugated polymers and deep understanding of the relation between chemical structure and photophysical properties are crucial to develop high performance PSCs. One of the effective approaches to develop efficient conjugated polymers is to strengthen the intermolecular interaction between conjugated polymer chains by enhancing their molecular orbital overlap. For this purpose, we synthesized a π-extended low bandgap polymer composed of thienylvinylene and isoindigo, which exhibits high crystallinity, low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital level and favorable molecular orientation in a blend film with PCBM. The PSC device shows a promising power conversion efficiency of 7.1%. Hence, thienylvinylene is a promising building block for constructing high performance conjugated polymers.

The needs to develop high performance polymer solar cells (PSCs) as renewable and eco-friendly energy resources have caused significant progress in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs for the past decade.1 The most promising architecture of PSCs is the donor–acceptor bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure, typically consisting of a photoactive conjugated polymer and fullerene derivative.2 The advance in PSC performance has been contributed mainly by the evolution of new donor polymers which have low optical bandgap for harvesting a broad solar spectrum while they have the proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level to secure exciton dissociation at the donor–acceptor interface and a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to afford high open-circuit voltage (VOC), and high hole mobility for balanced charge collection at both electrodes.3 One of the best strategies to achieve the desired properties is to synthesize alternating copolymers, as electron donor material in BHJ, consisting of electron-rich and electron-deficient monomers.4
Isoindigo is a dye molecule, known as an isomer of indigo or a by-product of some biological reactions.5 However, since Reynolds and his co-workers introduced isoindigo as electron-deficient unit for organic photovoltaics,6a the molecule has been used as a building block of conjugated polymers for organic electronics.6b–i Isoindigo is a symmetrical molecule with two lactam rings pertaining strong electron-withdrawing characteristics and planar π-conjugated structure. Particularly, the planar molecular structure leads to high charge carrier mobility in field-effect transistors (FETs).6f–i Moreover, isoindigo-based organic materials show broad optical absorption, high extinction coefficients, and deep HOMO energy levels.7 Therefore, isoindigo is a promising building block for constructing low bandgap conjugated polymers to achieve high performance PSCs.
Thienylenevinylene (TVT) has not been fully studied as an electron-rich moiety of low bandgap conjugated polymers for organic photovoltaic application, although it has been used for high performance FETs.8 It has been known that the incorporation of a vinylene bridge unit in the polymer backbone induces coplanarity of polymer chains and thus affords strong π–π interaction with a large overlapping area between chain backbones due to the rotational freedom between consecutive aromatic units.9 Hence, conjugated polymers containing TVT units are expected to have superior charge transport properties compared to polymers without a vinyl linkage.
In this work, we report the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of a highly π-extended conjugated low bandgap polymer composed of isoindigo (iI) and TVT, poly[((E)-1,1′-di(2-decyltetradecyl)-[3,3′]biindolyl-2,2′-dione)-6,6′-diyl-alt-((E)-2-(2-(thiophene-2′-yl) vinyl)thiophene)-5,5′-diyl] (PiITVT) (Fig. 1) and compare the properties of PiITVT with those of PiI2T, which is an isoindigo-based polymer without a vinyl linkage,6f in order to examine the effect of the vinylene linkage on the photovoltaic properties of isoindigo-based polymers. When the solar cell device fabricated from the PiITVT:PC61BM blend was optimized by varying the mixing ratio of mixed solvent, the device exhibited a PCE of 7.09%, which is much higher than the best PCE of the PiI2T:PC71BM blend.10 To the best of our knowledge, the PCE value of 7.09% is the highest among PSCs fabricated from isoindigo-based polymers.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structure of PiI2T and PiITVT. 
The polymers were synthesized from iI and TVT (or 2T) via microwave-assisted Stille coupling polycondensation. The number average molecular weight of PiITVT is 106.4 kDa with a polydispersity index of 3.47 while PiI2T has the number average molecular weight of 78.2 kDa with a polydispersity index of 3.76, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Fig. S1†). Both polymers have sufficient molecular weights so as not to affect the power conversion efficiency. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that PiITVT starts to decompose at 390 °C under nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S2†).
When the optical properties of PiITVT were characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2a, PiITVT in the solid state exhibits a low optical band gap of 1.61 eV as determined by the onset of the absorption spectrum. The absorption spectrum of PiITVT shows the most intense 0–0 transition peak at 710 nm, the less intense 0–1 transition peak at 644 nm and a weak peak at 452 nm arising from a π–π* transition. In the low energy (long wavelength) region, the absorption wavelengths of two transition peaks of PiITVT are identical to those of PiI2T which is an alternating copolymer consisting of iT and bithiophene (2T) (i.e. PiI2T is a polymer without a vinylene linkage in PiITVT). However, the intensity of the 0–1 peak of PiITVT is relatively stronger than that of PiI2T, indicating that PiITVT chains are more strongly aggregated (H-type aggregation).11 The aggregation of PiITVT is further identified by observing the intensity change of the 0–1 peak with variation of solution concentration: the more concentrated solution shows the stronger 0–1 peak (Fig. S3†). In the high energy (short wavelength) region, the peak of PiITVT shows a slightly bathochromic shift compared to that of PiI2T. Furthermore, PiITVT in the solid state shows much stronger absorption below 620 nm. All of these optical properties lead us to conclude that PiITVT chains with a vinylene linkage are more readily aggregated in the solid state and thus exhibit a more ordered structure than PiI2T. The absorptivity of PiITVT is higher than that of PiI2T over the entire wavelength range (Fig. S4†).

When the frontier orbital energy levels of PiITVT were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 2b, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels were −3.61 eV and −5.64 eV, respectively. Since PiITVT has a deep HOMO energy level due to the strong electron deficient isoindigo unit in the alternating copolymer, it is expected that the PSC device from PiITVT exhibits high VOC. It should be noted here that the energy levels of PiITVT are similar to those of PiI2T, indicating that the vinylene linkage does not affect the frontier orbital energy levels.
To investigate the effect of the vinylene linkage in PiITVT on the photovoltaic properties, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices fabricated from PiI2T and PiITVT were measured with a conventional configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al under AM1.5G illumination. Photovoltaic properties of PiI2T and PiITVT-based devices are summarized in Table 1. When the device performance of both polymers was optimized by changing the acceptor type (PC61BM vs. PC71BM), the blend ratio of polymer to PCBM, the type of solvent with or without additive, and the active layer thickness, the PCE of PiITVT-based devices was higher than that of PiI2T-based devices. It should be noted here that the best performance of the PiTVT-based device was observed when PC61BM was used as acceptor while the PiI2T-based device exhibits the maximum PCE when PC71BM was used. In a previous report,7 it was demonstrated that using PC61BM as acceptor shows higher PCE than PC71BM in isoindigo-based polymer solar cells. The PiI2T-based device showed a maximum PCE of 5.55% when the device was prepared from PiT2T:PC71BM solution in chloroform (CF) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) mixture (CF:DIO = 96:4), which is very consistent with the maximum value previously reported.10 For PiITVT-based devices, the best performance was obtained when the device was fabricated from PiITVT:PC61BM solution in CF and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) mixture solvent (CF:DCB = 9:1). The detailed optimization processes are represented in the ESI.†Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves for the optimized devices fabricated from PiI2T:PC71BM and PiITVT:PC61BM. The short circuit current (JSC) of the optimized device fabricated from PiITVT is higher than that of optimized PiI2T-based device (13.2 mA cm−2vs. 10.7 mA cm−2) while the VOC and fill factor (FF) of both devices are almost the same (see also Table 1). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 3b) also identify that PiITVT has higher JSC than PiI2T. Furthermore, under optimized conditions, the space charge limited current (SCLC) hole mobility of PiITVT:PC61BM blend (5.14 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of PiI2T:PC71BM (1.06 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), as shown in Fig. S10.† This is probably because PiITVT has more favorable molecular and packing structure to transport free charge carriers.

To demonstrate the structural effect of incorporation of a vinylene group between the two thiophenes in PiITVT, geometry optimization of TVT and bithiophene was performed using density functional theory (DFT), and the molecular ordering of PiI2T and PiITVT was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 4). When the optimized structure of TVT is compared with that of the bithiophene unit, the dihedral angle in TVT is 0° while the angle of the bithiophene is of 16.5°, indicating that TVT has a better coplanar structure than bithiophene. When the XRD patterns of PiI2T and PiITVT films are compared, as shown in Fig. 4c, the XRD pattern of PiITVT exhibits a (010) peak corresponding to the π–π stacking with a distance of 3.73 Å while PiI2T does not show a discernible (010) peak, although both polymers exhibit clearly lamellar texture with strong (h00) peaks. This indicates that PiITVT chains with better coplanar TVT units, as also evidenced by the DFT calculation, are more readily ordered in the π–π stacking direction than PiI2T.

For further verification of enhanced JSC by introduction of a vinylene group, grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were performed to provide structural information on a blend film of BHJ PSCs such as inter-chain distance, crystal size and crystallite orientation (Fig. 5). Fig. 5c and d clearly show that the (100) and (200) peaks of PiITVT:PC61BM blend are sharper and more distinct than those of PiI2T:PC71BM blend, indicating that lamellar stacking of PiITVT chains in the blend was better developed. Furthermore, the π–π stacking peak (Q = 1.65 Å−1) was observed only from the out-of-plane GIWAXS profile of PiITVT:PC61BM blend film, indicating that PiITVT crystallites take a face-on orientation on the substrate, which is beneficial for charge transport in organic solar cells.12 When the crystal size of the polymer and PCBM in the blend film was calculated using the Scherrer formula, the crystal size of PiITVT was larger than that of PiI2T regardless of crystallite orientation (Table S1†), while the PCBM crystal size in PiITVT:PC61BM blend (ca. 1.4 nm) is nearly the same as the size of PiI2T in the PiI2T:PC71BM blend film (ca. 1.3 nm). Although the lamellar stacking distance (d100) of PiITVT in the blend film is longer than that of PiI2T due to the bulkier solubilizing group, the average number of chains in a PiITVT crystallite is larger than that in a PiI2T crystallite (Table S1†). These structural results explain clearly that PiITVT has much higher crystallinity and more desirable orientation for charge transport in blend films as compared to PiI2T.

When the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of PiITVT:PC61BM blend was compared with that of PiI2T:PC71BM blend (Fig. 6), it reveals that the PiI2T:PC71BM blend shows inter-connected fibrillar polymer domains with larger PC71BM clusters (ca. 100 nm in diameter), while the PiITVT:PC61BM blend exhibits a finer fibrillar polymer network with smaller fullerene domains, indicating that the morphology of the PiITVT:PC61BM blend is more effective for charge carrier transport than that of PiI2T:PC71BM blend.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a highly π-extended isoindigo-based low bandgap polymer (PiITVT), which is an alternating copolymer consisting of isoindigo and thienylvinylene, can be used as a promising donor material for high performance PSCs. The polymer has planar structure, a low optical band gap of 1.61 eV and a deep HOMO energy level of −5.64 eV, all of which are beneficial for achieving high photovoltaic performance. The PSCs based on PiITVT:PC61BM showed a PCE of 7.09% with a JSC of 13.2 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.91 V and FF of 59%. This performance is higher than that of PiI2T-based PSCs with a JSC of 10.7 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.91 V and FF of 57%. The improved performance of PiITVT-based devices was mainly derived from enhanced JSC. The higher JSC of PiITVT-based solar cells may be attributed to two facts: PiITVT absorbs more photons in the high energy region than PiI2T; PiITVT has a better coplanar structure and thus a more ordered structure in the π–π stacking direction as compared to PiI2T, which is beneficial for charge carrier transport. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE value of 7.09% is the best among PSCs fabricated from isoindigo-based polymers. In short, this work clearly shows that the π-extended thienylvinylene unit is a promising building block for constructing conjugated polymer to achieve high performance PSCs.

Broader context
Low bandgap conjugated polymers based on a donor–acceptor (D–A) structure are an emerging class of donor materials for high performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Molecular design and synthesis of conjugated polymers and deep understanding of the relation between chemical structure and photophysical properties are crucial to develop high performance PSCs. One of the effective approaches to develop efficient conjugated polymers is to strengthen the intermolecular interaction between conjugated polymer chains by enhancing their molecular orbital overlap. For this purpose, we synthesized a π-extended low bandgap polymer composed of thienylvinylene and isoindigo, which exhibits high crystallinity, low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital level and favorable molecular orientation in a blend film with PCBM. The PSC device shows a promising power conversion efficiency of 7.1%. Hence, thienylvinylene is a promising building block for constructing high performance conjugated polymers.
