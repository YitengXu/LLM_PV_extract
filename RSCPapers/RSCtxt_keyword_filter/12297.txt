    , Accepted 24th December 2020First published on 24th December 2020AbstractRecently, metal-halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for photodetector (PD) applications owing to their superior optoelectronic properties, such as ambipolar charge transport characteristics, high carrier mobility, and so on. In the past few years, rapid progress in lead-based perovskite PDs has been witnessed. However, the critical environmental instability and lead-toxicity seriously hinder their further applications and commercialization. Therefore, searching for environmentally stable and lead-free halide perovskites (LFHPs) to address the above hurdles is certainly a worthwhile subject. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of currently explored LFHPs with an emphasis on their crystal structures, optoelectronic properties, synthesis and modification methods, as well as the PD applications. LFHPs are classified into four categories according to the replacement strategies of Pb2+, including AB(II)X3, A3B(III)2X9, A2B(I)B(III)′X6, and newly-emerging perovskite derivatives. Then, we give a demonstration of the preliminary achievements and limitations in environment-friendly PDs based on such LFHPs and perovskite derivatives, and also discuss their applications in biological synapses, imaging, and X-ray detection. With the perspective of their properties and current challenges, we provide an outlook for future directions in this rapidly evolving field to achieve high-quality LFHPs and perovskite derivatives for a broader range of fundamental research and practical applications.

1. Introduction
Since Miyasaka and co-workers incorporated CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) as a sensitizer into dye-sensitized solar cells and achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% in 2009,1 metal-halide perovskite ABX3 (A = CH3NH3 (MA), NH2CHNH2 (FA), or Cs; B = Pb; X = Cl, Br, I, or mixed halides) solar cells have been widely studied and their PCE has exhibited a rapid rise within the past decade.2,3 The current certified PCE of perovskite solar cells has surpassed 25.5%,4 which could be compared to that of single crystal silicon-based solar cells. The reason for such remarkable photovoltaic behaviors of metal-halide perovskites can be attributed to their superior optoelectronic properties, including direct bandgap, large light absorption coefficient, suitable and adjustable bandgap, long carrier diffusion length, and high defect tolerance.5–7 Moreover, with the increase of the understanding on fundamental material characteristics and device operation principles, the rapid development also extends the applications of perovskite materials beyond photovoltaics to other fields, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs),8–10 photodetectors (PDs),11–16 lasers,17–21 image sensors,22–26 memory,27–30 and so on. These research areas offer a vast platform for perovskite materials, facilitating their applications in the cost-effective and large-scale manufacture of optoelectronics and suggesting new potential.
As a significant constituent of electronic circuits and optoelectronic devices, PDs are capable of transforming light signals (electromagnetic radiation carrying energy) into electric signals based on various principles, which are attracting increasing interest in both academic and industrial domains in a wide range of applications, including light communication, security surveillance, environmental monitoring, image sensing, and space exploration. By employing perovskite materials as the light absorbers, many breakthroughs in developing high-performance and low-cost perovskite PDs have been witnessed in recent years.31–35 At present, perovskite-based PDs with different geometries and working modes have been successfully demonstrated, such as photoconductors, photodiodes, and phototransistors, and the optimal photoresponsivity exceeds 109 A W−1, the specific detectivity (D*) is up to 1016 jones (1 jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1), and the response speed reaches the nanosecond level.12–16 It is worth noting that the obtained photodetection performances of perovskite-based PDs have already attained a level of competitiveness over those based on conventional photo-sensing materials and commercial silicon. Despite the great advances and extraordinary potential, the toxicity issue and intrinsic material instability against moisture, heat, and light irradiation of the commonly used lead-halide perovskites hinder their practical applications and future commercialization.36–38 To remedy the lead toxicity issue, researchers have made increasing efforts to screen appropriate perovskite alternatives both in theory and experiment. In order to retain the advantages of Pb-based perovskite materials, the electronic configuration of the typical lead-halide perovskites should be considered where the valence band is made up of p-orbitals of halide and s-orbitals of Pb, while the conduction band is only based on lead's p-orbitals.39,40 Thus, the elements following the order of Pb electronic configuration are preferred as potential alternatives. Therefore, some homovalent (such as Sn and Ge) or heterovalent elements (such as Bi, Sb, Cu, In, and Ag) have been employed as the replacements of Pb.41–47 By now, Sn(II), Sn(IV), Ge(II), Bi(III), Sb(III), In(III), Ag(I), Cu(I), and Cu(II) have been employed as the replacements of Pb, and some of the produced lead-free halide perovskites (LFHPs) or perovskite derivatives show remarkable optoelectronic properties, which are comparable to the lead-based perovskites or even better in some aspects. Moreover, these encouraging lead-free candidates have low toxicity and high stability. To the best of our knowledge, several reviews and perspectives about LFHP synthesis, particularly focused on their photovoltaic applications, have been published.48–50 However, no study has yet presented a comprehensive overview on LFHP-based photodetection applications.
In this review, we deliver a comprehensive overview on LFHPs and their applications in PDs. Firstly, we give a summary of the approaches and consequences of lead replacements reported in the literature, as shown in Scheme 1. Based on the different replacement strategies, the LFHPs were classified into four categories, including AB(II)X3, A3B(III)2X9, A2B(I)B(III)′X6, and the newly emerging perovskite derivatives. The crystal structure, synthesis method, optoelectronic properties, and environmental stability of each type of material were also analyzed and compared. Then, we give a demonstration of the recent advances in widely studied LFHPs and perovskite derivatives as light absorbers in PDs. Finally, we present current and existing limitations and future development opportunities in this important field.

2. Crystal structure and optoelectronic properties of LFHPs and perovskite derivatives
Typically, the APbX3 structure of perovskite is cubic, and it assembles into a three-dimensional (3D) network by sharing the [PbX6]4− octahedral corners, where Pb(II) cations are located at the center of the octahedra and the cavity among adjacent octahedra is occupied by A(I) cations. The study of LFHPs was firstly performed by homovalent substitution of Pb(II) with group IVA elements, Sn(II) and Ge(II), in the perovskite structures because of their same valence and comparable ionic radius. Subsequently, various types of LFHPs based on Bi(III), Sb(III), In(III), Ag(I), Cu(I), and Cu(II) replacements were intensively investigated and developed. Various substitutions offer a wide diversity of crystal structures, optical, electrical and other physicochemical properties for LFHPs or perovskite derivatives. The crystal structures of currently explored LFHPs or perovskite derivatives can be summarized as follows.
2.1. Lead replacements by homovalent Sn/Ge elements
Among commonly studied lead substitutions, only Sn and Ge can form the traditional perovskite structure because they both fulfill the coordination and charge balance pre-condition, thereby avoiding the significant lattice disturbance caused by the substitution.7 Because of the same lone-pair s orbitals, the Sn/Ge-based perovskites have comparable electronic and band structures, as well as remarkable optoelectronic properties and high defect tolerance to the lead analogues.38 As shown in Fig. 1a, ASn(II)X3 is composed of a 3D network of corner-sharing [SnX6]4− octahedra, with A cations occupying the cavity among adjacent octahedra. Umari et al. investigated the optoelectronic properties of MASnI3via the spin–orbit coupling-GW (SOC-GW) calculation, as shown in Fig. 1c. The band structure of MASnI3 exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.1 eV at the Γ point, which is consistent with the experimental bandgap of ∼1.3 eV.51 As a result, the absorption edge of MASnI3 locates at the near-infrared region that is unattainable with lead-based perovskites, which is expected to produce a broader spectral response than Pb-based PDs. Despite this, the applicaitions of ASn(II)X3 perovskites in optoelectronic devices remain highly unsatisfactory at present. On one hand, the Sn2+ and Ge2+ tend to be oxidized into Sn4+ and Ge4+ in the air because of the lack of inert pair effect as in Pb2+, resulting in great concern regarding their stability.37 On the other hand, the high-energy-lying Sn 5s2 states make the Sn–I bonds easy to break, forming high-density Sn vacancies. The relatively low formation energy of the Sn vacancy in ASn(II)X3 introduces deep carrier recombination centers, resulting in a substantial device degradation. Therefore, to facilitate their applications in optoelectronic devices, efforts must be made to mitigate the instability issue. It is possible to incorporate additives or donor elements to suppress the oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV). Of course, substitution of Sn(II) with more stable Sn(IV) is another attractive option, though the composition and crystal structure of the Sn(II)-based perovskites need to be modified to maintain the charge balance. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, one Sn(IV) ion and a vacancy replace two Sn(II) ions in ASn(II)X3 perovskites to form vacancy-ordered perovskites, which are composed of a face-centered lattice of SnX6 units with A cations occupying the cuboctahedral voids. It can be found that the close-packed anionic lattice similar to ASn(II)X3 perovskites is preserved, so the crystal structure is similar to ASn(II)X3.38 Taking Cs2SnBr6 as an example, Fig. 1d shows its band structures calculated by both the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) approaches. It can seen that the Cs2SnBr6 features a direct bandgap, and the calculated HSE/PBE bandgaps are 2.51/1.44 eV, respectively, consistent with the experimental results obtained by Zhou and co-workers.42

2.2. Lead replacements by heterovalent Bi/Sb elements
Trivalent B(III) cations, i.e., Bi3+ and Sb3+, with similar ns2 electronic configuration, electronegativity, and a comparable ionic radius with Pb, have attracted significant interest as potential candidates for LFHPs. First, their similar ns2 electronic configuration with Pb tends to establish an anti-bonding interaction at the valence band maximum (VBM); thus the defects were confined to the shallow states at energy band edges. Therefore, even with defective sites, the optoelectronic properties of B(III) cations may be retained. Second, Bi3+ and Sb3+ cations possess a large absorption coefficient of ∼105 cm−1 comparable to Pb-based materials, which is determined by the absorption between X-5p valence states and 6p absorption states.52 Moreover, the optical transition from 6s states (near the VBM) to 6p conduction states also contributes to the large absorption coefficient.53 Third, a long carrier diffusion lifetime for Bi/Sb-based perovskites is expected due to their octahedral coordinated structure. These impressive properties make Bi/Sb promising candidates to replace the toxic Pb. For such heterovalent substitutions, the chemical formula is A3B(III)2X9, which is equivalent to that obtained by removing 1/3 of the B-site cations from ABX3.7,37,50,54,55 The A3B2X9 compounds have two typical structures: one is the 0D dimer form composed of isolated face-sharing [B2X9]3− octahedra (Fig. 2a), and the other is the 2D layered perovskite (Fig. 2b). The preferential formation of two competing structures depends on the selection of A, B, and X ions. For example, Cs3Bi2I9,54 MA3Bi2I9,56 and MA3Sb2I957 show isolated face-sharing octahedra, whereas (NH4)3Sb2I9,58 MA3Sb2ClxI9−x,59 and Rb3Sb2I9,60 show a 2D layered perovskite structure. For 2D layered perovskite Cs3Bi2I9, Liu et al. reported their calculated electronic band structure (Fig. 2d), with a bandgap of 2.24 eV.61 Similar to the lead-based perovskites, the bandgap of Cs3Bi2X9 can also be adjusted from 2.11 to 3.15 eV after a simple halogen adjustment, which is advantageous for realizing detection in the visible light range.62 Moreover, theoretical and experimental studies indicated that Bi-based perovskites demonstrated better material stability than that of conventional lead-halide perovskites. Using first-principles calculations, Ma and co-workers observed that the decomposition energy of trigonal Cs3Bi2Br9 is much higher than that of cubic CsPbBr3 (Fig. 2e), which may be due to the shortened bond length and additional distortion of the [BiBr6]3− octahedron. Furthermore, they extended the theoretical investigation into the migration of native defects (i.e., Br vacancy, VBr+) in perovskites. As seen in Fig. 2f, the diffusion barrier of VBr+ in Cs3Bi2Br9 is much higher than that in CsPbBr3 indicating the chemical stability of Cs3Bi2Br9. Experimentally, the authors also systematically evaluated the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light, heat, and moisture/oxygen on the optical and structural performance of such materials. The result is consistent with the theoretical data discussed above. For Cs3Sb2X9 LFHPs, their stability study and related results are similar to those of Cs3Bi2X9,63 and the above theoretical analysis is also applicable.

A fact that should be recognized is that the replacement of Pb by Bi or Sb can reduce the dimensionality of the perovskite structure, leading to reduced band dispersion, increased effective masses of charge carriers, and decreased carrier mobility.7 To avoid the issues noted above, halide double perovskites with B-site substitution by mixed cations (B = B(I), B′ = B(III)) have been recently explored to form 3D LFHPs (A2BB′X6), as illustrated in Fig. 2c. The crystal unit of halide double perovskites is very similar to that of lead-based perovskites. The difference is that the B-site cations are alternately arranged by mixed cations (B = B(I), B′ = B(III)) to occupy the octahedral center. The crystal structure shows that it is a face-centered cubic structure with space group Fm3m and the 3D structure was maintained. The halide double perovskites offer tremendous options, since a wide range of different elements are available for B(I) and B(III) ions. Through the strategy of cation-transmutation and the density-functional-theory (DFT) method, Zhao et al. theoretically explored 64 members of the A2BB′X6 materials, where A is Cs+, B represents monovalent cations Na+, K+, Rb+, Cu+, Ag+, Au+, In+, and Tl+, B′ is trivalent cations of Bi3+or Sb3+, and X is a halogen (Cl−, Br−, and I−).64 Considering the excellent phase stability, small carrier effective masses, and low exciton binding energies, eleven of them were predicted as promising materials to replace lead-halide perovskites. Fig. 2g shows the calculated absorption spectra of selected A2BB′X6 perovskites. Fig. 2h displays the calculated electronic band structure of Cs2AgBiBr6, one of the most studied materials.65 The coupling between Ag(d) + Bi(s) and anionic X(p) states makes the VBM decenter at point X in the Brillouin zone, resulting in an indirect bandgap of 2.09 eV.66,67 In addition, Filip et al. calculated the thermodynamic stabilities of A2BB′X6 (B = Cu, Ag, and Au; B′ = Bi, and Sb; and X = Cl, Br, and I).68Fig. 2i shows the stability with their decomposition energies (ΔH), and one can observe that the compounds with decomposition values below zero are unstable. Further investigations showed that solid solutions such as Cs2BiAg1−xCuxCl6 are stable. Overall, the halide double perovskites have rich combinatorial chemistry and significantly enhanced thermodynamic stability, so they have great potential in a wide range of optoelectronic/electronic applications.
2.3. Perovskite derivatives
In addition to the vast study of the above metals, some other metal cations have also been investigated, such as Cu, and In, forming low-dimensional perovskite derivatives due to their smaller ion radii than that of Pb cations. Recently, such perovskite derivatives, which refer to metal halides without clear relation to the perovskite structure, have become a research hotspot. Also, these halide semiconductors exhibit superior stability and direct bandgap. Here, we take Cu+, Cu2+, and In3+ as examples, focusing on their crystal structures and electronic band structures. Fig. 3a shows the crystal structure of CsCu2I3. Each [CuI4]− tetrahedron is connected by three common edges to form a 1D chain structure. The Cs+ ions are located between every two chains, which are coordinated by eight I− ions in the form of double-capped trigonal prisms. The electronic band structure of CsCu2I3 was calculated using the PBE functional.69 As shown in Fig. 3b, CsCu2I3 is calculated to possess a direct bandgap (2.15 eV), with the VBM and CBM both being at the G point. In addition, such copper halides exhibit excellent carrier transport properties due to the highly dispersive bands near the valence and conduction edges.70Fig. 3c shows the 0D crystal structure of Cs3Cu2I5, in which a tetrahedral site and a trigonal site are formed. Both of them form [Cu2I5]3− and each [Cu2I5]3− is separated by surrounding Cs+ ions. The electronic band structure of Cs3Cu2I5 was calculated using the PBE functional,72 and it is characterized by a direct bandgap (Fig. 3d). In addition, the K2Cu2Cl6 (Cu2+) material was also synthesized by Zhou and co-workers,47 which is characterized by a monoclinic structure with the space group of P2(1)/C, and the [Cu2Cl6]2− dimers are located at the corners and center of the unit cell in the b–c plane. The band structure of K2Cu2Cl6 possesses a bandgap of about 0.26 eV along the highly symmetric points. Fig. 3e shows the crystal structure diagram of (C4H14N2)2In2Br10, in which the separated [InBr6]3− octahedrons and [InBr4]− tetrahedrons are surrounded by the cations respectively, forming a characteristic 0D structure at the molecular level.71 In addition, the hydrogen bond was not found between [C4H14N2]2+ cations with [InBr4]− tetrahedrons, but it was found in [InBr6]3− octahedrons, suggesting that the tetrahedrons are highly isolated in (C4H14N2)2In2Br10, further confirming its 0D structure. The DFT calculations (Fig. 3f) show that the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) for (C4H14N2)2In2Br10 are constituted by completely flat bands, reflecting that the electronic states are highly localized owing to the confined charge carriers. From the stability point of view, all-inorganic perovskite derivatives generally exhibit better stability compared to their lead-based counterparts. Taking Cs3Cu2I5 as an example, Wang et al. studied the dynamic stability and thermodynamic stability of Cs3Cu2I5 through first-principles calculations.72 First, no negative frequency was observed from the phonon band structure; thus the dynamic stability of Cs3Cu2I5 was proved, as shown in Fig. 3g. Then, the calculation of the decomposition enthalpy at 0 K and the first-principles molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K were performed (Fig. 3h), and the results show that Cs3Cu2I5 has a good thermodynamic stability. In addition, in order to understand the defect state in Cs3Cu2I5, they analyzed the relationship between the formation energy of inherent defects and the Fermi level under Cu-poor and Cu-rich chemical growth conditions (Fig. 3i). It can be seen that under two growth conditions, the formation energy of the Cu vacancy (VCu) is the lowest. Fortunately, the nondiffusion of VCu in the [Cu2I5]3− cluster may contribute to its robust stability.

3.1. PDs based on Sn-based perovskites
By using the remarkable optoelectronic properties of Sn-based perovskites, much interesting progress has been made. In 2017, Waleed et al. fabricated CH3NH3SnI3 (MASnI3) nanowire (NW) arrays for the first time in porous alumina templates by using a vapor phase chemical reaction method (Fig. 4a).73 With this method, the diameter and periodicity of the NWs were precisely controlled, which is highly attractive for photonic and optoelectronic applications. By using the NW arrays as the photoactive material, they fabricated a PD, with photoresponsivity of 0.47 A W−1 and D* of 8.80 × 1010 jones. For this approach, the alumina sidewalls effectively blocked the lateral diffusion path of oxygen and water molecules, so that the material stability was dramatically improved. However, the device performance in their case is still not satisfactory due to the lack of lateral transmission and the long transport distance between the two electrodes. Under these circumstances, Du et al. prepared CsPb1−xSnxI3 nanobelts (NBs) via a solvothermal route, as seen Fig. 4b.74 Note that the high-quality CsPb1−xSnxI3 NBs possess a low density of defects with limited recombination of charge carriers and a high light absorption coefficient. Therefore, the PDs based on a single CsPb0.922Sn0.078I3 NB show a remarkable performance with a photoresponsivity of up to 1.18 × 103 A W−1 (Fig. 4c). For PD applications, Sn can be deemed as a suitable Pb substitution mainly for two reasons; the first is the lower toxicity of Sn, and the other is the smaller ionic radius of Sn (Sn2+: 1.35 Å and Pb2+: 1.49 Å), which can broaden the response spectrum of the fabricated PDs.75–78 For example, Zhu et al. demonstrated an efficient low-bandgap Sn-rich binary PD,76 and the optimized Sn-rich binary PDs can achieve a broad spectral response from 300 to 1100 nm and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE), as shown in Fig. 4d. However, for Sn(II)-based perovskites, the easy oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV) represents a large concern for their stability. Therefore, various methods were conducted to improve the device stability, as shown in Fig. 4e. For example, in 2018, Qian et al. reported 2D perovskite (PEA)2SnI4 flexible film PDs via a one-step solution processing method.79 SnF2 was added to reduce the Sn vacancies by increasing their formation energy, and inhibit the transition from Sn2+ to Sn4+. The structure of the (PEA)2SnI4 flexible PD is shown in Fig. 4f, in which the flexible electrodes were prepared by patterning the spin-coated rGO (reduced graphene oxide)/(PEDOT:PSS) hybrid films on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. The conductance of rGO is significantly enhanced due to the introduction of PEDOT:PSS. The obtained device exhibited a photoresponsivity of ∼16 A W−1, and D* of 1.92 × 1011 jones. Moreover, the PD can maintain its initial performance after 1500 cycles of bending, as presented in Fig. 4g. In addition, Liu et al. demonstrated a high-performance flexible PD based on the FASnI3 films.80 By introducing hydroxyl benzene sulfonic acid additive along with excess SnCl2 to form a complex layer to encapsulate the perovskite grains in situ, air-stable FASnI3 films were successfully prepared. The device based on the dense FASnI3 layer displays high photoresponsivity in a broad wavelength region from 300 to 1000 nm with the maximum photoresponsivity and gain of over 105 A W−1 and 105, respectively, at a low working voltage. Replacing divalent Pb with Sn(IV) is also an effective method to form a salt structure with the formula of A2SnX6 (X = Cl, Br, and I), which is a 50% Sn-deficient perovskite derivative with a [SnX6]2− octahedron.42,81,82 This substitution can not only result in a long-term stability in air but also maintain the high-symmetry cubic structure with a different halogen X (X = Cl, Br, and I). Han et al. reported a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize Cs2SnX6 (X = I and Br) with high crystallinity and yield.81 To assess the potential applications of Cs2SnI6 for optoelectronic devices, they designed and fabricated two-terminal PDs with a simple structure of FTO/Cs2SnI6/FTO, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4h. The devices exhibit a fast response speed with rise time (tr) and decay time (td) both less than 100 ms. Except for the photoconductive type PDs, another heterojunction device was also prepared from Bi-doped Cs2SnCl6 nanoparticles (NPs) spin-coated on GaN substrate (Fig. 4i).82 Due to the construction of a type II heterojunction and the good crystallization of the NPs, the device exhibits a fast response speed (tr/td = 0.75/0.91 μs).

3.2. LFHP-based PDs through heterovalent element substitution

3.2.1. Bi-based halide perovskites. 
In 2017, Wessels et al. reported the synthesis of Cs3Bi2I9 and Rb3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs), and they pointed out that the large bandgap, high resistivity, and photoresponse are key characteristics for hard radiation PD materials.83 In the same year, Tong et al. synthesized the CsBi3I10 films by a simple solution process,84 in which chloroform was used to accelerate the evaporation of the solvent, and then dried under vacuum, as shown in Fig. 5a. The treated films show a highly smooth surface and a high crystalline quality; thus the as-assembled device has a high optoelectronic performance under light illumination (400–700 nm) (Fig. 5b). In addition to the photoconductive PDs, self-powered PDs have also been widely studied.43,85–87 For example, based on the MA3Bi2I9 microcrystalline films, Hussain and co-workers fabricated a self-powered PD with asymmetric contact electrodes (FTO/MA3Bi2I9/Ag), as illustrated in Fig. 5c.43 The PD exhibited a remarkable performance with high photosensitivity of 105 and D* of 1012 jones at low operating voltages, as seen in Fig. 5d. It was also revealed that the MA3Bi2I9 PD had a good stability after storage for two months at ambient conditions. Recently, Pious et al. reported a novel LFHP material, (1,3-propanediammonium)2Bi2I10·2H2O.87 As illustrated in Fig. 5e, the [Bi2I10]4− was formed by the edge sharing of [BiI6]3− octahedra, and the well-aligned inorganic units and the sandwiched organic cation layers on either side form a quantum-well structure. The optoelectronic applications were demonstrated, indicating the possibility of such a material as a promising candidate for photodetection.

However, there are many obstacles that impede the further improvement of the performance of film-based PDs; for example, there are a large amount of grain boundaries and defects in polycrystalline material forms, by which the photogenerated carriers would be rapidly trapped. Therefore, it is very important to enhance the integrity of the light absorbers. In this regard, Pan and co-workers synthesized highly stable and lead-free Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite NPs for photodetection applications through a solution-process method.88Fig. 5f shows the typical optical images of the obtained Cs3Bi2I9 NPs grown on Au film, sapphire, PDMS, glass, and SiO2/Si substrates. The corresponding atomic force microscope (AFM) image of the NPs on SiO2/Si substrate shows a low surface roughness of 1 nm, indicating a good crystal quality. The PDs constructed with these NPs display a maximum photoresponsivity of 33.1 mA W−1 under the illumination of a 450 nm laser. Due to the good crystallization and high defect tolerance of Cs3Bi2I9 NPs, the device exhibits high stability. Besides, a Cs3Bi2I9 SC thin film with a high quality was grown on the ITO glass by a space-limited solvent evaporation crystallization method by Kuang and co-workers.89 The optical image in Fig. 5g presents that a hexagonal shaped crystal with 4 mm in lateral size was obtained. The SC thin film possesses a very low trap density and a high carrier mobility, which are beneficial for their optoelectronic performance and stability. Experimentally, the minimum detection limit of Cs3Bi2I9 SC thin film PD is as low as 10−4 mW cm−2, a large LDR of 117 dB is obtained (Fig. 5h), and the device exhibits an excellent long-term stability, highlighting their potential applications operated under harsh conditions. In addition to NPs, bulk SCs are also one of the options for achieving high-quality PDs because of their low defect density,90–95 and different methods have been developed to prepare high-quality SCs. Sun and co-workers demonstrated the growth of Cs3Bi2I9 bulk crystals (15 × 60 mm3) using a modified vertical Bridgman method, as shown in Fig. 6a.91 They reported the observation of a resolved energy peak using α particles with a spectral resolution of 32% for the first time. Liu et al. developed a nucleation-controlled method to grow centimeter-sized Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite SCs, as shown in Fig. 6b.61 By using this technique, they harvested some large sized SCs with a low trap density and thus the device based on such SCs obtained good performance. Fig. 6c shows the dark current–voltage (I–V) curve of the Cs3Bi2I9 SC PD, which exhibits a low dark current of 6 pA at 10 V bias, and the photoresponsivity and D* are obtained as high as 1.1 A W−1 and 4.7 × 1012 jones, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6d and e. In addition, its outstanding thermal stability facilitates the development of a high temperature X-ray detector with stable response at 100 °C. Zhang et al. synthesized the (aminoguanidinium)3Bi2I9 (AG3Bi2I9) bulk SCs with dimensions of up to 24 × 12 × 5 mm3 by a low-cost evaporation method of the hydroiodic acid aqueous solution, which shows a direct bandgap of about 1.89 eV.92 As shown in the right panel of Fig. 6f, the bulk SCs can be peeled off through the Scotch tape into slices with an area of up to 0.6 cm2, which lays the foundation for realizing low-defect flexible optoelectronic applications. The schematic illustration of flexible exfoliated wafer-based planar detectors is shown in Fig. 6g, and excellent photodetection ability was realized. In addition to PDs based on the A3Bi2X9 structure, bulk SC PDs based on other structures have also been demonstrated. For example, by a facile solution process, Luo et al. reported a new (TMHD)BiBr5 (TMHD = N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediammonium) perovskite.93 The structural analysis reveals that it crystallizes in the monoclinic system with a space group of P21/c at room temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 6h. Emphatically, high-quality SCs with the dimensions of 2 × 24 × 12 mm3 are successfully grown (Fig. 6i). PDs based on bulk lead-free (TMHD)BiBr5 SCs were prepared, which show a rapid response speed of 8.9/10.2 ms. The results highlight that the (TMHD)BiBr5 bulk SCs can serve as promising candidates for photodetection.

3.2.2. Sb-based halide perovskites. 
Although antimony-containing films and anti-solvent vapor-assisted bulk crystals of MA3Sb2I9, (NH4)3Sb2IxBr9−x, and Cs3Sb2I9 perovskites have been prepared since 2015, Sb-based perovskite PDs were not intensively studied.96–98 In recent years, Sb-based perovskites with micro/nano-structures, such as NWs, nanoflakes (NFs), and SCs, have been employed for photodetection studies. Pradhan et al. first demonstrated the fabrication of PDs using the Cs3Sb2Cl9 perovskite NWs as the light absorber.44 By using the colloidal synthesis route, they synthesized micron-long Cs3Sb2Cl9 NWs and nanorods. The I–V characteristics of the fabricated device show the detection behavior under visible light, as shown in Fig. 7a, and the inset shows the corresponding optical image. The device performance of Cs3Sb2Cl9 NW PDs is remarkable in terms of a large photoresponsivity of ∼3616 A W−1. Even so, the ability of such PDs to detect weak light needs to be improved because of a relatively low D* of 1.25 × 106 jones. Then, an inverse temperature crystallization method was developed by Zheng and co-workers to grow a large size of ∼100 μm Cs3Sb2Br9 perovskite NFs, as seen in Fig. 7b.99 Different sizes of NFs can be synthesized by adjusting the evaporating temperature and solute concentration. In this case, the fabricated Cs3Sb2Br9 NF PDs demonstrated an excellent D* of 2.6 × 1012 jones, as displayed in Fig. 7c. In addition, by employing the MA3Sb2I9 micro-single crystals (MSCs) as the active material, which are characterized by a low trap state density of ∼1010 cm−3 and a long carrier diffusion length reaching 3.0 μm,100 Yang and co-workers developed a high-performance PD. As shown in Fig. 7d, the photoresponsivity and D* of MA3Sb2I9 MSC PD are as high as 40 A W−1 and ∼1012 jones, respectively. In particular, the PDs exhibit a fast response time (<1 ms) to monochromatic light (460 nm) illumination. Similarly, except for the A3Sb2X9 structure, PDs based on other structures have also been demonstrated. Very recently, Lei et al. synthesized (MV)[SbI3Cl2] SC (MV2+; N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-dipyridylium) by a solvothermal method, which has 1D inorganic frameworks of the I-sharing double octahedra. The (MV)[SbI3Cl2] possesses a direct bandgap of 1.5 eV (Fig. 7e), and shows an obvious photoresponse to visible light.101 Under 532 nm illumination with the power of 5 mW at a bias of 50 V, the photoresponsivity and EQE are 29.75 mA W−1 and 6.69%, respectively (Fig. 7f). The (MV)[SbI3Cl2] will provide an alternative material for photodetector applications.

3.2.3. Lead-free double perovskites. 
Lead-free double perovskites are considered to be promising alternatives for lead-based perovskites due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and significantly enhanced chemical and thermodynamic stability. Since 2017, many studies have been carried out to evaluate the photodetection performance of lead-free double perovskites targeted at visible light and X-rays.102–113 In this part, we mainly focus on the progress of PDs in visible light, and the X-ray detectors based on lead-free double perovskites will be discussed later. Greul et al. first demonstrated the preparation of Cs2AgBiBr6 films by a solution method. As shown in Fig. 8a, the surface coverage and film quality are improved by preheating the precursor and substrate to 75 °C before spin coating.114 By using the same synthesis method, Lei et al. firstly reported a photoconductive-type PD by using the Cs2AgBiBr6 films as the light absorber.103 Li and co-workers also reported a Cs2AgBiBr6-based self-powered PD based on the above methods.65 In their case, the Cs2AgBiBr6 light absorber is characterized by the high-density and low-size nanocrystallites, which are short of well-defined facets and irregularly stacked. As a result, the undesired trap states may exist at the interfacial areas among the nanocrystallites, and a poor photodetection ability can be expected. To overcome this problem, Yang et al. optimized the synthesis method, and high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 films with large grain sizes, long charge carrier lifetimes, and low trap densities were obtained.107 Correspondingly, an optimized multilayer heterojunction device (including optimized hole- and electron-transporting layers) was prepared, which shows a remarkable performance (Fig. 8b and c). More importantly, due to the low defect densities and multilayer heterojunction device structure, the Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite-based PDs exhibit a superior operational stability. For the non-encapsulated devices, there is almost no degradation in the PD performance under a high temperature of 150 °C, and ∼94% of the initial photoresponsivity can be retained after storage in ambient air for 2300 h. In addition, high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 films can also be prepared by modifying the substrate surface with an ultrathin metal oxide (MOx) layer.111Fig. 8d shows the schematic diagram of the formation of Bi–O bonds at the interface between the substrate and Cs2AgBiBr6 films. The Bi atoms in Cs2AgBiBr6 lattices would bond with the oxygen atoms on the substrate surface, leading to the improvement of the film quality and photoelectric performance. Fig. 8e shows the spectral response characteristic of the device, which exhibits a remarkable photoresponsivity ranging from 350 to 550 nm, and a large LDR of 165.2 dB (Fig. 8f). Although great efforts have been made to improve the performance of Cs2AgBiBr6-based PDs, their indirect bandgap characteristics reduce its potential for PD applications. That is, a much thicker absorbing layer is necessary for indirect bandgap materials due to the weak oscillator abilities for either light absorption or radiative recombination. To solve this problem, some studies have been performed to explore other lead-free double perovskites with a direct bandgap.46,115–120 For example, lead-free double perovskite Cs4CuSb2Cl12 microcrystallite with direct bandgap was fabricated and studied by Batabyal et al.46 Cs4CuSb2Cl12 is a triple layered perovskite formed by interlocking octahedrons of Sb3+ and Cu2+. It has a structure similar to Cs3Sb2Cl9, which can be thought of as having a CuCl6 octahedron sandwiched between layers of SnCl6 (Fig. 8g).115 Except for the film-based PDs, LFHP SCs were also synthesized and applied. Tang and co-workers prepared high-quality Cs2AgInCl6 SCs by the hydrothermal method.45 The inset of Fig. 8h shows the photograph of corresponding Cs2AgInCl6 SCs, which possesses truncated octahedral shape with an average size of 2.88 mm × 2.81 mm × 1.95 mm and smooth surfaces. Then, UV detectors with a photoconductive planar structure were fabricated, demonstrating a fast response time of ∼1 ms, and a high D* of 1012 jones. Moreover, the studied PD is very stable, and maintained 90% of the initial device performance after storage in ambient conditions (∼25 °C, and 55% relative humidity) for 60 days, as seen in Fig. 8i, indicating its advantages for optoelectronic applications.

3.3. Perovskite derivatives
Recently, another family of ternary perovskite derivatives has also been intensively studied for PDs. Currently, there are three main synthesis approaches for perovskite derivatives, including spin-coating,121–125 the modified anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization process,126 and vacuum-based deposition.127Fig. 9a shows the schematic illustrations of the spin-coating process for the preparation of copper halide Cs3Cu2I5 films,122 and the process can be described as dropping anti-solvent near the end of the spin-coating process to accelerate crystallization. By using this method, Li et al. reported a spectral-selective PD based on the Cs3Cu2I5 films. The surface-charge recombination can be controlled through the thickness of the absorber and the device responds only to photons with an energy in a narrow “window” of 300–370 nm.121 Also, by a modified anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization method, Zhang et al. realized a sensitive deep-UV PD with Cs3Cu2I5 crystalline films as the active layer,126 exhibiting remarkable sensitivity to deep UV light with the photoresponsivity of 64.9 mA W−1. In addition to the solution method, vacuum evaporation can also be used for thin film preparation, and the corresponding schematic preparation is shown in Fig. 9b. Lately, Tang et al. prepared CsCu2I3 films by the vacuum thermal evaporation method.127 Compared with the solution-phase method, the vacuum evaporation technique can achieve a high surface coverage for the CsCu2I3 films composed of small nano-grains, which are more advantageous in device construction.

Except for the film-based PDs, devices based on perovskite derivative SCs have also been studied. In 2018, Jun et al. synthesized Cs3Cu2I5 SCs by the anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization method.128 As seen in Fig. 9c, the Cs3Cu2I5 precursors were placed in a bottle and covered with a paraffin film with a small hole. The covered bottle was placed inside a beaker filled with methanol. Then, this beaker was sealed by a paraffin film. In their case, the paraffin film was used to balance the anti-solvent atmosphere and protect the condensing anti-solvent. Note that this method was widely used to synthesize Cu-based, In-based and other perovskite derivatives.128–130Fig. 9d shows the optical images of 1D CsCu2I3 SC synthesized by the above method.130 The SC is of high quality with a size of about 10 mm × 1.5 mm, and has a strong white-light emission under UV light excitation. Li et al. prepared 1D CsCu2I3 NWs using the same method,131 and further the NWs were used as the light absorber to fabricate a polarization-sensitive UV PD because of their electric and optical anisotropy of the asymmetric structure and external morphology anisotropy, and a high photocurrent anisotropy ratio of 3.16 was achieved, as shown in Fig. 9f. Due to the high crystallinity and low-dimensional structure of the CsCu2I3 NWs, the PDs exhibit an excellent photodetection ability. More recently, by a low-cost anti-solvent vapor assisted method, a highly crystalline and highly stable CsCu2I3 SC was synthesized, and further a high-speed PD with the response speed of tr/td = 0.19/14.7 ms was constructed, as shown in Fig. 9g and h.132 At the same time, Zhou et al. synthesized the Cs2InBr5·H2O SC by a low-temperature crystallization method, which is another common method for synthesizing perovskite SCs.133–135 As shown in Fig. 9e, the optical images of Cs2InBr5·H2O SC possess a large size of 2 mm. Similarly, Zhou et al. explored the synthesis of copper halide salt K2Cu2Cl6 for photodetection applications,47 and Tang et al. demonstrated the X-ray detector using 1D structured Rb2CuBr3 synthesized by low-temperature crystallization.133 The above results motivate the development of high-performance PDs based on nontoxic and stable low-dimensional metal halides in the future.
4. Applications of LFHPs and perovskite derivative PDs
4.1. Biological synapses
It is possible to store and process information at the same time by adjusting the connection between two adjacent neurons, that is, biological synapses. Recently, many artificial synaptic devices have been developed based on the above principles.143–146 In the light synapse devices, the light pulse is regarded as a presynaptic stimulus, and the current is the synaptic weight. Light pulses can be transmitted to the device by generating excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). Using the relatively long decay time (0.63/3.6 s) caused by Sn-cation vacancies and the concept of biological synapses, Qian et al. applied 2D lead-free perovskite (PEA)2SnI4 films in light controlled memory devices.79Fig. 10a shows the schematic diagram of a biological synapse. The EPSC increases from 0.8 to 7.0 μA as the light pulse duration time increases from 1 to 200 ms, as shown in Fig. 10b. Then, a series of light pulses with different light intensities and the same duration time of 10 ms was applied on the device, and ΔEPSC decreased from 3.7 to 1.7 μA with decreasing irradiance, as shown in Fig. 10c. The above results are quite similar to those in a biological excitatory synapse. The dynamic synaptic behaviors of the device were also studied. As seen in Fig. 10d, when the device was stimulated by multiple light pulses, the peak value of EPSC gradually increased. After turning off the light, the EPSC decreased to the original current. This is similar to the short-term plasticity of a biological excitatory synapse. This work suggests that Sn-based perovskites can be used in light controlled memory devices, which can simulate the short-term plasticity of biological synapses due to the existence of Sn vacancies.

4.2. Imaging applications
Image sensors are widely used in digital cameras, industry, and defense.147,148 In recent years, research on imaging capabilities based on perovskites has been extensively carried out, and image sensors based on different wavelengths have been successfully realized. For example, UV imaging applications were demonstrated by deploying the Cs3Cu2I5/GaN heterojunction PD as the sensing pixels.121Fig. 11a displays the high-resolution results of the hollow ‘‘UV’’ logo and a solid symbol of a deer under UV light illumination, indicating the high fidelity features of the imaging system and the reliable imaging function of the device. Zhu et al. realized the integration of a 6 × 6 pixel array based on the Sn-rich binary perovskite devices for visible imaging applications.76 They first tested the photocurrent uniformity of these pixels, which is important as the photocurrent difference of every pixel degrades the image quality. As shown in Fig. 11b and c, these 6 × 6 PD pixels show normalized photocurrent from 0.7 to 1.0, which indicates the remarkable photocurrent uniformity. Then, a hollow “+” sign was put between the device and the incident light. As shown in Fig. 11d, the image was recorded vividly, promoting their further development in practical application. Wang et al. also realized near-infrared imaging using Sn-rich perovskite PDs and an indium gallium zinc oxide film transistor-matrix backplane.77 The 12 × 12 array was illuminated with 850 nm infrared light at an intensity of 1374 mW cm−2 through an “11” shape shadow mask. The result is shown in Fig. 11e, with a clear shape of number “11” (red frame). Besides, X-ray imaging was also realized by Liu and co-workers.61 They demonstrated a nucleation-controlled method to grow large-size Cs3Bi2I9 SC, in which they reduced the number of crystal nuclei to ensure that each one independently grows. The Cs3Bi2I9 SC shows a low trap density, ultra-low dark current noise and high stability, and these characteristics suggested that the Cs3Bi2I9 SC would exhibit excellent imaging capability. Fig. 11f shows the schematic of the vertically structured X-ray detector (Au/Cs3Bi2I9 SC/Au), and the images of a metallic nut were reproduced by X-ray imaging (Fig. 11g). The clear color contrast demonstrates that these objects were clearly resolved.

4.3. X-Ray detection
The detection of X-ray photons is of utmost importance for a wide range of applications, from specific crystal structure determinations to radio astronomy. Lead-based perovskites have been proven to be suitable materials for X-ray detection, owing to the heavy Pb and halide atoms.149–151 Considering that Bi is the heaviest stable element, and the X-ray absorption of Bi-based LFHPs and Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, and I) double perovskites could be stronger than lead-based counterparts and commercial α-Se X-ray detectors. In 2017, Tang et al. first reported Cs2AgBiBr6 SC X-ray detectors with a low detection limit.102 They designed and fabricated a vertical device structure of Au/Cs2AgBiX6 SC/Au, with a 2 mm-thick Cs2AgBiBr6 SC as the active material. The optimized device exhibited a high sensitivity of 105 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and a low detection limit of 59.7 nGyair s−1 under an external bias of 5 V. Thereafter, a series of interesting works were conducted by Tang's group to improve the performance of the Cs2AgBiX6 X-ray detector.106,110 For instance, to inhibit the undesired ionic migration behavior in Cs2AgBiBr6 polycrystalline wafers, Tang and co-workers introduced bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) as the hetero-epitaxial passivation layer to passivate the surface defects of Cs2AgBiBr6, and thus the ionic migration was also effectively suppressed, as illustrated in Fig. 12a.106 Hence, the detector achieved outstanding balanced performance with a signal drifting by one order of magnitude lower than other studies, a high sensitivity of 250 μC Gyair−1 cm−2, and a spatial resolution of 4.9 lp mm−1 (Fig. 12b and c). Then, they proposed a solubility and supersolubility guidance scheme applied to Cs2AgBiBr6 SC growth. As shown in Fig. 12d, compared with the unoptimized ones, the promoted Cs2AgBiBr6 crystal exhibits a more smooth surface as well as high resistivity with a narrow distribution from 6.1 × 109 to 3.31 × 1010 Ω cm, leading to an excellently performing X-ray detector with enhanced sensitivity of 1974 μC Gyair−1 cm−2.

In 2018, Sun and co-workers reported the growth of Cs3Bi2I9 SC using a modified vertical Bridgman method.91 The Cs3Bi2I9 SCs were cut into appropriate sizes along different crystal orientations for optical and electrical anisotropic property studies. The X-ray response of a 2 mm Cs3Bi2I9 SC detector was explored using a tungsten X-ray source. According to the relationship S = (ION − IOFF)/dose rate, a high X-ray sensitivity of 111.9 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 was obtained, as shown in Fig. 12e. In addition, organic–inorganic hybrid MA3Bi2I9 SC was also synthesized by Liu and co-workers to achieve the X-ray detection.92,95 They first reported the inch-sized (26 × 26 × 8 mm3) 0D MA3Bi2I9 SC using a precursor refinement strategy to remove the superfluous nucleation seeds. These crystals have significantly lower ion migration, reduced dark current, and better environmental stability compared with other lead-halide perovskites. The resulting devices show a surprisingly high sensitivity of 1947 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 at a bias of 60 V mm−1, and a very low detection limit of 83 nGyair s−1, as shown in Fig. 12f and g. Furthermore, they designed an X-ray imaging system based on this 0D-structured MA3Bi2I9 SC. To demonstrate the capability of the imaging system to resolve small features, they scanned two metallic keys by a device (Fig. 12h). It should be noted that the metal parts inside the rubber can also be clearly shown by the obvious contrast in the X-ray imaging, indicating that the unique function of X-ray imaging is the ability to penetrate materials, which are opaque to visible light, as seen in Fig. 12i. Except for Bi-based LFHPs and Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, and I) double perovskites, Rb2CuBr3 was also a good candidate for sensitive X-ray detection.133 The high PL quantum yield of Rb2CuBr3 combined with strong X-ray absorption capability enables a record high light yield of ∼91056 photons per MeV among perovskites and relative scintillators, and the detection limit of Rb2CuBr3 is 121.5 nGyair s−1, as shown in Fig. 12j. The above results indicate the strong competitiveness of lead-free metal halides in the next generation of X-ray imaging, and the device performance parameters obtained from some representative literature are summarized in Table 2.

5. Conclusion and outlook
In summary, we have reviewed the currently explored LFHPs and perovskite derivatives, and discussed their structures, synthesis and modification methods, optoelectronic properties, and photodetection applications. As potential photo-active materials, their preliminary applications in PDs are encouraging, with potential for cost-effective and large-scale manufacturing from abundant materials.
Firstly, replacing Pb with Sn, Ge is an attractive option, and the resulting CsSnX3 and CsGeX3 are comparable with lead-based perovskites or even better in some aspects. However, the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ represents a large concern for their stability. Substitution of Sn2+ with more stable Sn4+ has been adopted as an attractive option, and A2SnX6 (X = Cl, Br, and I)-based PDs have been demonstrated. Secondly, Bi3+- and Sb3+-based perovskites are recognized as one of the most promising candidates among LFHPs and perovskite derivatives due to the similar ns2 electronic configuration with Pb. By now, a series of Bi3+- and Sb3+-based perovskites with structures of A3Bi2X9, ABi3X10, and A3Sb2X9 (A = MA+, FA+, Rb+, and Cs+; X = I−, Br−, and Cl−) have been developed experimentally, and photodetection applications were also demonstrated. However, the replacement of Pb by Sb or Bi would reduce the dimensions of the perovskite structures, leading to reduced band dispersion, increased effective masses of charge carriers, and decreased carrier mobility, which is not conductive to the photoresponse ability of the resulting PDs. Under these circumstances, double perovskites with B-site substitution by mixed cations (B = B(I), and B′ = B(III)) have recently been explored to form 3D LFHPs (A2BB′X6). Due to the distinguished stability and tunable optical properties, lead-free double perovskites have enormous potential for constructing high-performance, stable and environment-friendly optoelectronic devices for practical applications. Besides, another family of Cu-based perovskite derivatives has been reported recently, which refers to metal halides without clear relation to the perovskite structures. By now, many types of metal halides with different structures have been studied, such as K2Cu2Cl6, Rb2CuBr3, Cs3Cu2I5, and CsCu2I3, and their future applications in the manufacture of optoelectronics are worthy of expectation.
Through first-principles calculations, the LFHPs and perovskite derivatives show good dynamic stability and thermodynamic stability. Experimentally, the fabricated PDs demonstrate good stability operating in the air, which makes it less demanding on packaging in future applications. In addition, the emerging LFHPs and perovskite derivatives can extend the response range of Pb-based perovskite PDs, which is a good supplement for practical applications in some special situations. Generally, PDs based on lead-based perovskites can achieve a response range of 300–800 nm. While the Cu-based halides are always characterized by a relatively large bandgap and can realize a deep UV photodetection below 250 nm, Sn-based LFHPs have a smaller bandgap compared with the lead-halide perovskites, and their photoresponse range can extend to the near-infrared region (800–1000 nm).
Although these results are encouraging, the LFHPs and perovskite derivative-based PDs are still far from the requirements for practical applications. Perovskite materials have some inherent limitations on practical application and commercialization. For example, the localized defect states in perovskite lattices and the bulk are harmful for their applications. To solve these problems, detailed studies on the charge carrier dynamics are needed to provide thoughtful concepts for understanding the mechanism of defect traps in the structure. On this basis, more theoretical and empirical investigations are needed to promote the overall performance of LFHP PDs.
(1) Defects in perovskites are still a problem to be solved. Further research should focus on the defect passivation and the growth of high-quality LFHP crystals. Preparation methods, such as solvent engineering or various vapor deposition methods, should be further studied. On the basis of the existing methods, further improving the crystal growth process to obtain perfect lattice LFHPs or introduction of some effective dopants into LFHPs will be beneficial to reduce their trap states.
(2) Though great progress has been made in the synthesis of the LFHPs and perovskite derivatives, highly effective synthesis of crystals with precise shape and size control compared to that of conventional lead-halide semiconductors still urgently needs to be explored. Moreover, the applications of most LFHPs and perovskite derivatives (such as Cu(I)-based metal halides) have not been fully developed, and their unique photophysical properties have not yet been extensively studied, which are significant for various potential applications. Thus, more theoretical and empirical investigations are needed to promote the overall performance of the LFHPs and perovskite derivatives.
(3) The performance of the PDs needs to be further improved. On the basis of highly-crystalline LFHPs, many methods can be used to further improve the device performance. Firstly, the dark current of the PDs can be suppressed by doping or surface modification of LFHPs, which is conductive to obtain a high on/off current ratio. Secondly, to further improve the photoresponsivity of the PDs, the light absorption of the LFHPs should be enhanced, and introducing the plasmon effect into the device may be a good choice. Thirdly, optimizing the device structure is also an important option. For example, the use of photomultiplication mechanisms in PDs could achieve an EQE greater than 100%; thus the ability of the PDs to detect a weak light signal can be improved.
(4) The inevitable stability issue is still the focus of devices in the future. Although perovskite derivatives have been proved to have better stability than the lead-based perovskites in theory and experiment, they are still far from enough for practical applications. The construction of multi-layer heterostructures or the combination with inorganic materials may be a feasible method to improve the stability of the device.
(5) For further development, it is necessary to reduce the size of the devices and improve their integration to achieve practical applications. At the same time, new design strategies are urgently required to synthesize new LFHPs with intriguing physical and optoelectronic properties toward specified applications.
