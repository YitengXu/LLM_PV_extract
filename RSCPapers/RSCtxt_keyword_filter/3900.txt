    , Accepted 24th November 2014First published on 25th November 2014AbstractWe report the synthesis of a solution-processable, dodecyloxyphenyl-substituted azafullerene monoadduct (DPC59N) and its application as electron acceptor in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs). Due to its relatively strong absorption of visible light, DPC59N outperforms PC60BM in respect to short circuit current (JSC) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) in blends with donor P3HT.
The field of solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells has been widely dominated by fullerenes as electron acceptors.1 Among these fullerenes, derivatives based on the phenyl-butyric acid methyl ester motif (PC60BM and PC70BM) have been by far the most commonly used.2 Numerous alternatives have been published to date,3 however, only a few structures have led to higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than their methyl ester counterparts.3a,e,4
For achieving an improvement of PCE by chemical functionalization of fullerenes, chemists have mainly relied on two strategies. First, the HOMO–LUMO level position can be fine-tuned by (multiple) functionalization of C60, which in turn can result in an increase in open circuit voltage (VOC).3f Alternatively, the symmetry of the fullerene core can be decreased to enhance optical absorption in the visible range of the solar spectrum, thus inducing an increase in JSC.4c,5 While the first strategy has been widely adopted, the second strategy has been restricted to the use of C70, whose oval shape is responsible for an increase in JSC in comparison with C60 derivatives. However, the increase in absorption of C70 derivatives is most pronounced in the UV region, therefore limiting the increase in JSC that one can optimally achieve.
In light of these considerations, we wondered whether azafullerenes, a class of fullerenes in which one carbon atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom,6 could potentially outperform PC60BM and PC70BM in BHJ-OSCs by having their absorption further shifted toward the visible region of the spectrum.
Only very recently, Gan and Ding described the first BHJ-OSC based on an azafullerene electron acceptor.7 In this study, the authors transformed an azafullerene monoadduct into a bisadduct (as mixture of regioisomers) to enhance solubility, and the observed improvement in comparison to benchmark PC60BM (increased VOC) is a result of the bisadduct's LUMO position. Here we report the synthesis of a solution-processable azafullerene monoadduct, DPC59N, which in BHJ-OSCs exhibits the characteristics expected from an increased absorption of visible light (higher JSC and EQE in comparison with PC60BM). Based on the results presented herein, we believe that azafullerenes with optimum solubility and LUMO energy levels could be a viable alternative to PC60BM.
Our synthesis of DPC59N is shown in Scheme 1. Parent fullerene C60 was transformed into cage-opened ketolactam 1 in two steps following a protocol published previously by Wudl.8 From this stable intermediate, target compound DPC59N, which is dark green in solution, was prepared in one single step in 37% yield.9
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of azafullerene monoadduct DPC59N. Reaction conditions: (i) C60 (6.94 mmol, 2.0 equiv.), MEM-azide (3.52 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), ODCB, 150 °C, 60 min. (ii) hν, air, ODCB, 15 °C, 5–6 h, 13% (two steps). (iii) 1 (70 μmol, 1.0 equiv.), dodecyloxybenzene (700 μmol, 10 equiv.), p-TsOH (700 μmol, 10 equiv.), ODCB, 150 °C, 23 min, 37%. MEM: methoxyethoxymethyl; ODCB: 1,2-dichlorobenzene. 
In contrast to the azafullerene monoadduct prepared by Gan and Ding,5DPC59N is soluble in most organic solvents (e.g. >10 mg mL−1 in dichloromethane), alleviating the need for further derivatization. Notably, the high solubility of DPC59N allowed us to fabricate solar cells based on this discrete molecule, and not a mixture of regioisomeric bisadducts, which can be hard to rigorously purify and characterize.

Fig. 1 shows the UV-Vis spectra of PC60BM and DPC59N both in solution and in thin films. DPC59N clearly absorbs more light than PC60BM between 400 and 500 nm, with absorbance coefficients larger by up to a factor of six, a trend we also found in thin films. To obtain a complete picture of the suitability of DPC59N as acceptor in BHJ-OSCs, a cyclic voltammogram was recorded in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and a LUMO energy of −3.63 eV was calculated for DPC59N, which is identical within error with the LUMO energy of PC60BM (−3.59 eV obtained under identical experimental conditions; see ESI†).
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis spectra of DPC59N (solid line) and PC60BM (broken line) in solution (dichloromethane) and in thin films. For better comparison, the spectra of the thin films were normalized at the point of identical molar absorptivity of the two fullerenes in solution (372 nm). 
With these promising characterization data in hand, we turned our attention towards fabricating BHJ-OSCs based on azafullerene DPC59N. P3HT was chosen as the donor polymer, and solar cells were fabricated with both DPC59N and PC60BM for comparison purposes (see Fig. 2 for structure). Devices were fabricated with identical thickness and blend ratio so that any changes in the J–V characteristics could be attributed to the absorption difference of the fullerenes. Therefore, devices of P3HT:DPC59N were first optimized for donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio, active layer thickness and annealing temperature. The optimum parameters resulting from the optimization were then used for fabrication of the reference P3HT:PC60BM devices. The J–V characteristics of the best-performing devices are shown in Fig. 2, and the relevant parameters reported in Table 1.

Several solvent systems were assessed in the active layer processing optimisation, resulting in chlorobenzene (CB) offering the best solubility and film homogeneity properties. We noticed however that DPC59N has a tendency to form aggregates in the processed films,11 an issue that could be partially addressed by leaving the D/A blend stirring for several days at 50 °C before the deposition of the active layer (see ESI† for details). Nevertheless, this aggregation effect is likely responsible for the somewhat lower fill factor (FF), and consequently lower VOC and PCE,12 observed in DPC59N devices in respect to the PC60BM reference (Fig. 3).

Despite these losses, DPC59N devices show a highly promising increase of roughly 0.7 mA cm−2 in JSC in respect to the PC60BM reference. JSC values are in excellent agreement with those calculated by integrating external quantum efficiency (EQE) over the whole solar spectrum. As seen in the EQE spectrum (Fig. 4), the EQE value of the DPC59N devices show a significant increase in intensity from 360 nm up to 500 nm. This increase peaks at a wavelength of 400 nm, where the difference in EQE between the two devices is higher than 15%. The good match between the absorption spectra of DPC59N and the area of increased EQE suggests that the enhancement of JSC is due to the azafullerene's stronger absorption of light in the visible region in comparison with PC60BM.

In conclusion, we have described a concise synthesis of a discrete, solution-processable azafullerene derivative, DPC59N, for application in BHJ-OSCs. We demonstrated that the azafullerene core provides for enhanced light absorption in the visible region compared to PC60BM without affecting the frontier orbital energies. Our data suggests that the enhanced light absorption leads to an increase of ca. 10% in JSC in comparison with reference devices made from PC60BM. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of short circuit enhancement from an azafullerene derivative in respect to PC60BM in BHJ-OSCs. Studies on the synthesis of second-generation azafullerenes with improved JSC and VOC are underway in our laboratories.

The nitrogen atom in azafullerenes is not measurably basic, due to delocalisation of electron density into the fullerene framework (see ref. 6). As such, residual acid in PSS is not expected to have an impact on device efficiency.
