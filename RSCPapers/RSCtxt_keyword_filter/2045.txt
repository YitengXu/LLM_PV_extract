Introduction

        Electrodes made from one-dimensional nanostructures such as nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes have been proposed for improving the charge collection efficiencies of ordered-bulk-heterojunction and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).1–7 DSSCs based on polycrystalline2 and single-crystal ZnO nanowires,1,3,4 amorphous and polycrystalline TiO2nanotubes,8–10 polycrystalline11 and single-crystal TiO2nanowires,12–14 have been reported. In DSSCs a monolayer of photosensitive dye is adsorbed on the internal surfaces of a nanostructured porous film to form a photoanode. This film can be made of nanoparticles, nanotubes or nanowires. The pores are filled with a liquid electrolyte containing the I−/I3−redox couple or a solid-state electrolyte15–17 to create a semiconductor–dye–electrolyte interface with a high interfacial area. Upon illumination, excited electrons from the dye are injected into the semiconductor and the positively charged dye is reduced through an electrochemical reaction with I−. The electrons diffuse through the semiconductor, flow through the load and arrive at the cathode placed across from the photoanode to reduce the I3− back to I− and to complete the circuit.
Competition between electron diffusion through the photoanode and recombination with I3− in the electrolyte determines the electron collection efficiency in DSSCs. In nanoparticle-based DSSCs, three factors influence the electron transport rate across the nanoparticle films. These factors are the residence time of electrons in traps, the morphology of the nanoparticle network, characterized by a distribution of the number of nearest neighbours, and the contact area between the particles.18,19 Single-crystal nanowires are advantageous for DSSCs because they eliminate the latter two factors by providing a direct path for electrons from the point of injection to the collection electrode. Indeed, studies show that electron transport is faster in both single-crystalline ZnO nanowires20,21 and in polycrystalline ZnO nanotubes22 than in nanoparticle films. While these results are encouraging, TiO2-based photoelectrodes are preferred over ZnO because of their superior stability, ability to adsorb dyes without forming aggregates,23 and higher density of states in the conduction band. Record power conversion efficiencies obtained with TiO2nanoparticle photoelectrodes are much higher (∼11%) than those achieved with ZnO nanoparticles (∼5%). Surprisingly, recent studies showed that electron transport rates in polycrystalline TiO2nanowires24 and nanotubes9 were as slow as in TiO2nanoparticle electrodes. This was attributed to a similar transport mechanism in polycrystalline TiO2nanowires/nanotubes and TiO2nanoparticle films. The electrons in polycrystalline nanowires and nanotubes still have to cross grain boundaries, which are similar to the interparticle boundaries in nanoparticle films. Another possibility is that surface traps control the diffusion rate and these exist on TiO2nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanowires regardless of the morphology. If the grain boundaries are responsible for slow electron transport in polycrystalline nanowires then electron transport in DSSCs made from single crystalline TiO2nanowires should be faster. However, growth of TiO2nanowires on transparent conducting oxide films has been difficult and this hypothesis could not be checked until now. Growth of single crystalline TiO2nanowires on transparent conducting oxide films was achieved only recently.14 Herein, we report electron transport and recombination rates in these single-crystal rutile TiO2nanowires and compare them with TiO2nanoparticle films of similar thickness. Surprisingly, we find that the electron transport time constant is approximately the same and even slightly slower in single-crystal rutile TiO2nanowires than in TiO2nanoparticle films, suggesting that electron diffusion rate is still determined by the residence time in surface traps even in single-crystal TiO2nanowires.
Experimental
Vertically aligned single-crystal rutile TiO2nanowires were grown on transparent conductive fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) substrates using the hydrothermal method developed by Liu et al.14 Briefly, two pieces of ultrasonically cleaned FTO substrates were placed at an angle against the wall a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and immersed in 30 mL of deionized water, 30 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5–38% by weight), and 1 mL of titanium isopropoxide. The autoclave was placed and kept in an oven for 3 h at 200 °C. Then the autoclave was cooled rapidly to room temperature under flowing water. The substrates were removed from the autoclave, rinsed and dried. Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) of the nanowires are shown in Fig. 1a and c. The nanowire film thickness is 1.2 μm and this is approximately the average nanowire length. Nanoparticle films were deposited on FTO substrates by drop-casting from a dispersion of P25 nanoparticles (Degussa) in ethanol. The solution contained 100 mg of P25 particles in 20 mL ethanol and was sonicated for 1 h prior to deposition to disperse the nanoparticles. FTO substrates were cleaned by sonication in a 1 : 1 : 1 mixture of deionized water, acetone and isopropanol before 170 μL of the nanoparticle dispersion was drop-cast onto the FTO substrate to deposit a nanoparticle film with comparable thickness to the nanowire film. The thickness of the nanoparticle film used in the comparisons shown herein was 1.2 ± 0.02 μm (Fig. 1b and d); this value is an average of six different measurements across the substrate indicating that the film was very uniform. After drying, the nanoparticle covered substrates were annealed at 450 °C for 10 min. Both the nanowire and nanoparticle substrates were then immersed in an aqueous TiCl4 solution at 50 °C for 2 h. The TiCl4 solution was prepared by mixing 0.09 mL of TiCl4 with 0.4 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid followed by the addition of deionized water to reach a final volume of 100 mL. After TiCl4 treatment, the substrates were rinsed with deionized water, allowed to dry in ambient air and annealed at 450 °C for an additional 30 min. Both the nanowire and nanoparticle covered substrates were then immersed in a 0.2 mM solution of N719 dye (Solaronix) in ethanol for 24 h. After dyeing, the substrates were rinsed with pure ethanol and dried in ambient air for 30 min. Solar cells were assembled by pressing TCO substrates coated with 10 nm Pt against the nanowire or nanoparticle substrates. The electrodes were separated by 25 μm Teflon spacers (Pike Technologies) and liquid electrolyte Iodolyte MPN-100 (Solaronix) was infiltrated between the electrodes using capillary action. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter while the solar cells were illuminated with AM 1.5 light from a solar simulator described previously.25

Electron transport and recombination time constants were measured using intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS)26,27 and open-circuit photovoltage decay,28,29 (OCVD), respectively. In IMPS, the DSSCs were illuminated, at short-circuit, with a small sinusoidally modulated light intensity (6% of the mean value), superimposed on a constant monochromatic light intensity (658 nm from a Newport LQA series laser). The photocurrent modulation amplitude and the phase lag between illumination and photocurrent were measured using a low noise current-to-voltage amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR570) and a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR810). The amplitude and phase lag were converted to real and imaginary components of the photocurrent and plotted on the complex plane for a range of modulation frequencies. The electron transport time constant (τc) was evaluated using the frequency at the minimum of the imaginary part of the photocurrent (fc) using τc = (2πfc)−1. In OCVD, the DSSC is illuminated with AM 1.5 light and allowed to reach a steady-state VOC. The illumination is then turned off and the photovoltage decay is measured using an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 1000 series). Recombination times are obtained from the photovoltage decay using τr = −(kT/e)(dVOC/dt)−1, where kT/e is the potential of thermal energy and (dVOC/dt)−1 is the instantaneous open circuit voltage decay rate.
The crystal structure and morphology of the TiO2nanowires and nanoparticle films were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker-AXS Microdiffractometer D5005, λ = 1.5406 Å), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6700F), transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction (TEM/SAED, FEI Tecnai T12), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 30).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the XRD from nanowires and from a P25 nanoparticle film. The XRD from nanowires matches the tetragonal rutile phase with a = b = 0.4517 nm and c = 0.2940 nm. When compared to the powder diffraction pattern, the (002) diffraction peak appears significantly enhanced, indicating that the nanowires are oriented with respect to the substrate. The P25 nanoparticle film shows diffraction peaks of both anatase and rutile phases consistent with a mixture. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) and electron diffraction reveals that nanowires are single crystalline along their entire length (Fig. 3). Lattice spacing obtained from HRTEM images are consistent with atomic plane spacings in rutile. Fig. 3 is representative of all nanowires and additional information regarding the growth mechanism and structural characteristic of the nanowires can be found in ref. 14.

Fig. 4 shows the I–V characteristics of typical TiO2nanowire and nanoparticle DSSCs. The nanoparticle-based DSSC exhibits a short-circuit current (ISC) of 3.81 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.65 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70, resulting in an overall efficiency of 1.73% while the nanowire-based DSSC exhibit ISC of 3.54 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.68 V and FF of 0.68 resulting in an overall efficiency of 1.58%. Dye desorption experiments reveal that the roughness factor for nanoparticle films is ∼130, while the roughness factor of the nanowire film is ∼85 despite the fact that the nanowire and nanoparticle films have similar thicknesses. Given that the surface area of the nanoparticle film is more than 50% greater than that of the nanowire film and, at low film thicknesses, the collection efficiency is high in nanoparticle films, one would expect nanoparticle-based DSSCs to show substantially higher short-circuit current than the nanowire-based DSSCs. Instead, the nanoparticle-based DSSC short circuit current is only marginally higher than that of the nanowire-based DSSC. In fact, the close performance of the two devices, despite the significantly different roughness factors, is due to strong light scattering within the nanowire film compared to the nanoparticle film. This is illustrated in Fig. 5, which shows digital photographs of an uncoated FTO substrate (left), an FTO substrate coated with a 1 μm thick TiO2nanoparticle film (center) and an FTO substrate coated with 1 μm thick TiO2nanowires (right). While the nanoparticle coated substrate is nearly transparent, the nanowire substrate is opaque due to stronger light scattering by the nanowires as compared to nanoparticles. This strong light scattering by the nanowires enhances the light-harvesting efficiency of the nanowire cells. The stronger light scattering of the nanowires counteracts the lower surface area, resulting in similar short circuit currents and similar overall efficiencies for the nanowire- and nanoparticle-based DSSCs.

Fig. 6a and b show typical IMPS responses and OCVD curves for nanoparticle- and nanowire-based DSSCs. The IMPS response crosses the imaginary axis at high frequencies and spirals to the origin. This is characteristic of cells illuminated from the electrolyte side.26 While our cells are illuminated from the photoanode direction, the TiO2nanoparticle and nanowire layers are so thin that substantial fraction of the light goes through these layers (e.g., see center sample in Fig. 5) and reflect back to impinge on the photoanode from the electrolyte side. For nanowires, this crossing occurs at a somewhat lower value of the imaginary axis because nanowires scatter light and fewer photons reflect from the platinized cathode. Crossing also occurs at lower values for thicker films. Recombination in both nanowires and nanoparticles is very slow and the cells can sustain significant voltages many seconds after the light has been turned off. Initially, the nanoparticles decay faster than the nanowires but the rates appear to asymptote to similar values after the initial change.

How to compare electron transport times fairly in two photoanodes with dramatically different morphologies is a complicated issue. One can compare cells with equal roughness factor and porosity, equal photoanode thickness, equal photocurrents or equal efficiencies. We chose nanoparticle and nanowire films with similar thicknesses and similar photocurrents and efficiencies. We expected, as in studies by Martinson,21 the transport time constants in nanowires to be faster than those in nanoparticles by at least two orders of magnitude so that small differences in geometric characteristics, photocurrents and efficiencies between these two cells were less important. Fig. 7 shows transport and recombination time constants for both nanowire- and nanoparticle-based DSSCs as a function of light intensity. We find that transport time constant in single-crystalline rutile TiO2nanowires exhibit a power law dependence on light intensity similar to that observed with nanoparticle films. In addition, the electron transport rate is approximately a factor of two slower in rutile nanowires than in P25 nanoparticles (∼70% anatase, 30% rutile). Previous studies on nanoparticle-based DSSCs showed that the electron transport rate in rutile TiO2nanoparticle films is one order of magnitude slower than anatase TiO2nanoparticle films.30 This order of magnitude difference in transport times was attributed to a smaller number of interparticle connections in the rutile films30 as compared to the anatase films. Fig. 7 shows that the electron transport rate is only slightly slower in single crystal rutile nanowires than in nanoparticles, indicating that, while the effect of interparticle connections is eliminated, traps still dominate electron transport. Moreover, the fact that the TiO2nanowires are single crystalline along their entire length suggests that the traps reside on the surface of the nanowires though we can not completely discount the possibility of bulk traps. The scaling exponents for the transport and recombination time constants were −0.24 and −0.45 for nanoparticles and −0.35 and −0.55 for nanowires, respectively. Recombination rates were slightly slower in the nanowires than in the nanoparticles, possibly due to different surface trap distributions in nanowiresvs.nanoparticles. The ratios of the recombination time constant to the electron collection time constant at the highest light intensity (τr/τc), were ∼40 for nanowire films and ∼55 for nanoparticle films. Although these ratios are high enough to give nearly 100% electron collection efficiency for 1 μm thick films, the similarity between ratios of transport and recombination rates in rutile TiO2nanowires and P25 nanoparticles indicates that rutile nanowires, without passivation of traps, may have a limited potential for improving the overall efficiency of DSSCs. While the potential of single-crystalline rutile nanowires appears limited for DSSCs, the situation may be different for single crystal anatase nanowires. Assuming that the results obtained by Park et al.30 for anatase and rutile nanoparticle films also hold for nanowire films, an order of magnitude improvement in electron transport with respect to nanoparticle cells would be possible by fabricating single-crystalline anatase TiO2nanowires on FTO substrates. Such nanowires have already been fabricated on Ti foil but, to our knowledge, not on transparent conducting oxide substrates.13 Also, it may be possible to improve the transport rate in rutile nanowires through surface treatments or growth of semiconductor shell layers at the nanowire surface, provided that these modifications reduce the density of surface traps.

Error bars represent standard deviations and illustrate reproducibility for DSSCs from three different batches (nanowires) and four different batches (nanoparticles). 
Finally, the difference in electron transport rates in ZnO and TiO2nanowires is major and striking. Even 4.5 μm long ZnO nanowires exhibit much faster (τc∼ 0.1 ms)21 electron transport than 1.2 μm long rutile nanowires (τc > 1 ms). Moreover, the electron transport in ZnO has been shown to be independent of light intensity20,21 whereas rutile nanowires exhibit light-intensity-dependent electron transport rates, a signature of trap involvement in the electron transport mechanism; in rutile nanowire-based DSSCs electrons diffuse faster when the cell is illuminated and the number of filled traps increases. The differences between the ZnO and rutile TiO2nanowires may be due to the intrinsic differences in the surfaces of the two materials, trap concentrations, carrier densities or a combination of these differences. Whatever the reason, having single crystalline high quality nanowires of the acceptor material does not guarantee fast electron transport in dye sensitized solar cells and one still may have to worry about trapping and develop methods for trap passivation.
Conclusions
Electron transport and recombination rates have been measured in single crystal rutile nanowire-based DSSCs. Surprisingly, the electron transport rate is on the order of the electron transport rate in nanoparticle-based DSSCs and not as fast as would be expected from single crystal nanowires. The slow and light intensity dependent electron transport rate indicates that trapping and detrapping, most likely in surface traps, still play an important role in electron transport even when DSSC photoanodes are made from single crystalline one dimensional nanostructures.
