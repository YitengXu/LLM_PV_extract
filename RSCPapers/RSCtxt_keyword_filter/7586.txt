Broader context

Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) is a very promising photovoltaic device. In order to accelerate its practical application, solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes have to be developed to improve the long-term stability. In the present study, a novel freestanding polymer gel electrolyte was synthesized based on a hydrogel material poly (β-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) through simple optimization of the solution polymerization in binary organic solvent. The polymer gel electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity and good flexibility. The device fabricated with this quasi-solid-state electrolyte can present up to 7.5% of light-to-electricity conversion efficiency, which is very close to that of the liquid type cell. The polymer network could effectively fix the liquid electrolyte, as a result, the gel-based electrolyte showed superior thermal stability in comparison with its liquid counterpart. This polymer gel electrolyte is very attractive for DSCs, especially for those flexible DSCs. This organogel and its fabrication method can also be employed in other functional materials and devices within the field of energy and environmental science.
1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) is a promising alternative to traditional p-n junction photovoltaic devices due to its low cost and easy fabrication.1 Up to now, its highest efficiency has already reached over 11% based on liquid electrolytes.2 However, some problems arising from the use of liquid electrolytes, such as the leakage and volatilization of organic solvents, have been revealed to limit the outdoor practical application and the long-term stability of DSCs. To settle these problems, many solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, such as p-type semiconductors,3–5 organic hole transport mediums,6,7polymer electrolytes,8–14addition compounds,15,16 ionic liquids17–19 and so on, have been developed to substitute liquid electrolytes. As a kind of quasi-solid-state electrolyte, gel electrolytes have received wide attention because of their high ionic conductivity, perfect interfacial contact with the photoanode, good permeation in the porous film as well as relatively good stability.20,21 In addition, gel electrolytes can facilitate the sealing procedure of DSCs and may expectably be used in flexible devices in the future.
In general, gel electrolytes could be obtained from the gelation of the corresponding liquid electrolytes by using polymers,11,12,22 low molecular mass gelators23,24 and nano-particles.25–27 Among these, polymer gel electrolytes are especially interesting due to their diversity and easy modification. Most polymer gel electrolytes were prepared by incorporating liquid electrolyte directly into a polymer matrix, such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN),28methacrylate-based polymers,29,30 polyethylene glycol (PEG),31 polyvinyidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene (PVDF-HFP)32–34 and so on. Methacrylate-based polymer electrolytes are one of the most effective polymer matrixes, which range from simple polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)22 to various graft copolymers, such as polystyrene/PMMA,35 poly(1-oligo(ethylene glycol)methacrylate-3-methylimidazolium chloride (P(MOEMImCl)),36 polyvinyidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVDF-co-CTFE-g-POEM)37etc. These gels are physically crosslinked and the polymer chains are independent of each other, easily leading to unsatisfactory mechanical property.33 As a result, chemically crosslinked polymer gel electrolytes are more attractive because of their stronger tensile strength and thermal stability. In addition, ion transport in the gel electrolyte can be facilitated by controlling the proper amount of the polymer. It is generally expected that a small amount of chemically crosslinked polymer network can trap a large quantity of liquid electrolyte, and a better cell performance will be achieved; in the meantime, the trapped liquid is hard to leak and volatilize even under pressure or elevated temperature. Thus, the absorbent ability of the polymer matrix is a very important index to the highly conductive and highly stable gel electrolytes. Hydrogel materials are promising candidates for DSCs' polymer gel electrolytes since they have such a super absorbent ability. At present, they have been widely employed in biological chemistry and clinical medicine as freestanding gels, however, less work on DSCs has been reported since most of hydrogel materials, such as polyacrylamide (PAM) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA),38,39 are incompatible with the most common organic solvents in liquid electrolyte. Therefore, some modification, by introducing hydrophobic or amphiphilic fragments into the polymer, are necessary.40,41 Poly (β-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) is an excellent hydrogel material, which is nontoxic, biologically compatible and environmentally friendly. Especially, its good compatibility to some organic solvents on account of the amphiphilic groups (-OCH2CH2OH) makes it a suitable backbone for gel electrolytes. But to our knowledge, PHEMA-based electrolytes for DSCs are still lacking of investigation and the cell efficiencies were only 3.9%.42,43 Herein, a novel freestanding PHEMA-based organogel electrolyte is developed simply by optimization of the solution polymerization of HEMA in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN)/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) binary solvent followed by soaking into I3−/I−-based liquid electrolyte. When this gel electrolyte was used to assemble dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), a total light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 7.46% can be achieved. Preliminary investigation on stability of the polymer gel electrolyte-based DSC reveals that this quasi-solid-state electrolyte exhibits good stability after a 1000 h thermal test in comparison with the DSCs based on the corresponding liquid electrolyte.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials

β-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA, ≥98%, Tianjin Institute of Chemical Reagent), 1, 6-hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA, 99%, Alfa Aesar), 2, 2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN, CP, Shanghai No.4 Reagent & H.v Chemical Co., Ltd.), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, AR, Beijing Chemical Reagents Company), 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN, ≥99%, GC, Fluka), LiI (AR, Wako), I2 (AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltds), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, ≥98%, GC, Fluka), titaniumisopropoxide (97%, Aldrich) were commercially available and used without further purification. 1-Methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII) was synthesized similar as ref. 44.
2.2. Preparation of the electrolytes
0.1 mL of HEMA monomer was dissolved in the binary solvent of MPN/NMP (0.9 mL), and a drop of 1, 6-hexanediol diacrylate was added as the crosslinker. The above mixture was degassed under vacuum for a few minutes. Then, the AIBN as initiator (0.4% weight of the monomer) was introduced into the precursor solution and the solution polymerization was carried out at 70 °C to obtain the organogel. The polymer gel electrolyte for DSCs was obtained by immersing the as-prepared organogel into the I3−/I−-based liquid electrolyte for 12 h, which contained 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M PMII, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in MPN/NMP binary solvent. Herein, one thing needs to be addressed, the composition of binary solvent for the polymerization solution, liquid electrolyte and finally the gel electrolyte is the same. Indeed, when fabricating gel electrolytes, taking the volume of the organogel into account, the concentrations of I− and I3− in the gel electrolyte were also kept 0.65 M and 0.05 M, respectively.
2.3. Characterization
Infrared absorption spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Bruker Tensor 27). The liquid sample was dropped onto a KBr pellet and was transferred into the FTIR instrument. The ionic conductivities were determined by ac impedance technique on an Im6ex electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) from 3 MHz to 5 Hz. The conductivities of the liquid electrolytes were tested in a two platinum electrode conductivity cell at 25 °C while the conductivity of the gel electrolyte was determined between room temperature and 85 °C in a sealed cell with a sandwich structure of “stainless steel/electrolyte/stainless steel”. The sample was kept at each temperature for an hour before measurement. The steady-state voltammograms were conducted on an Im6ex electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) using a two-electrode system equipped with a Pt ultramicroelectrode (radius 5 μm) as a working electrode and Pt wire as a counter electrode at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1.
2.4. Fabrication of the DSCs and the photoelectrochemical measurement
The 10 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film was fabricated on a conducting glass substrate (F-doped SnO2, 15 Ω/□) by a doctor-blading technique according to the literature.45 The TiO2 film was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to 80 °C, it was immersed into a solution of the dye cis-dithiocyanate-N, N′′-bis (4, 4′-dicarboxylate-2, 2′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) (RuN3, Dyesol) with a concentration of 3 × 10−4 M in dry ethanol overnight. An open sandwich-type cell was fabricated in air by clamping a slice of polymer gel electrolyte between a dye adsorbed TiO2 photoanode and a platinized FTO counter electrode (sputtered Pt mirror) with two clips. The cell using the liquid electrolyte was also tested for comparison. A mask with a window of 0.150 cm2 was clipped on the TiO2 side to define the active area of the cell. A solar light simulator (Oriel, 91192) was used to give an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) on the surface of the solar cells. The incident light intensity was adjusted with a radiant power/energy meter (Oriel, 70260) before each experiment. The characteristics of the photocurrent density-photovoltage of the cell under these conditions were recorded by a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Model 263A). The dark currents were measured under the same conditions in dark. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on IM6ex electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER) with the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. The impedance measurements were carried out under forward bias of −0.75 V in the dark. EIS analysis was fitted using ZSimpWin software.
2.5. Preliminary study on the stability of the DSCs
To study the stability of PHEMA-based quasi-solid-state DSCs, the devices were sealed, and the detailed procedures are shown in Scheme 1. The liquid electrolyte-based cells (Scheme 1(a)) were sealed as in ref. 46 and the quasi-solid-state DSCs were sealed as Scheme 1(b). Typically, a piece of polymer gel electrolyte film was put on the surface of the TiO2 electrode around which a Surlyn 1702 ring was set. Then, a thermally decomposed Pt counter electrode47 (CE) was directly hot pressed onto the photoanode and the excess gel electrolyte would be extruded through the holes pre-drilled on the Pt CE. Finally, the holes were sealed by another Surlyn film and a cover glass. To test the stabilities of the devices, both the DSCs based on liquid electrolytes and gel electrolytes were divided into two groups. One group was kept under ambient condition in dark and the other was stored in an oven fixed at 50 °C in dark.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Formation of the organogel and the FTIR studies
It is well known that iodine is an inhibitor of radical polymerization, so the solution polymerization can not be carried out in the presence of I2 or I3−. As a result, in our experiment, the organogel containing only the polymer matrix and the solvents will be prepared first, and then the redox species and additives will be introduced by immersing this organogel into the corresponding liquid electrolyte solution. The HEMA monomers were connected together through radical polymerization and the polymer chains were chemically crosslinked by the 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate to form a large 3D network (as shown in Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Synthesis and the possible structure of the crosslinked PHEMA-based organogel. 
It was found that different solvents will strongly influence the HEMA polymerization although the amphiphilic group (-OCH2CH2OH) is on its side chain. Pure MPN (3-methoxypropionitrile), which is widely used in DSCs, can not help to form a homogeneous PHEMA organogel and white precipitate will thus emerge (Fig. 1(a)). On the contrary, the existence of NMP will lead to good HEMA polymerization.

Here, the FTIR spectra were used to investigate the interaction between the solvents and the HEMA monomer. Fig. 2(a) presents the spectra of pure HEMA, pure MPN and their mixture, respectively. No obvious interaction between HEMA and MPN was observed except for −OH stretching vibration νOH of HEMA shifted from 3430 to 3502 cm−1, indicating that intermolecular hydrogen bonding from the −OH groups turned weak after the addition of MPN into HEMA. As a result, once the polymerization process was initialized, the HEMA monomers will link each other and congregate, MPN will be subsequently separated from the formed polymers and finally the phase disengagement occurs (Fig. 1(a)).
 Fig. 2  The FTIR spectra of (a) pure HEMA, pure MPN and their mixture; (b) pure HEMA, pure NMP and their mixture. 
When MPN is replaced by NMP, the circumstance is rather different. As shown in Fig. 2(b), a typical stretching vibration frequency νCO of NMP is observed shifted from 1686 to 1671 cm−1 whereas the νOH stretching vibration of HEMA is shifted from 3430 to 3401 cm−1, indicating that a strong hydrogen bonding interaction occurs between −OH (HEMA) and CO (NMP). Therefore, homogeneous PHEMA-based organogel could be obtained in pure NMP without any phase disengagement. However, taking the cell performance into account, MPN/NMP mixed solvent is supposed to be more suitable for the preparation of gel electrolyte and the volume ratio of MPN/NMP is optimized to be 2:1 (details will be found in the following part). A homogeneous organogel can be formed as followed: the NMP molecules will be adsorbed onto the polymer chains by hydrogen bonding (like the nonfreezing bounded water in hydrogel) to stretch the 3D network of the polymer host to avoid the agglomeration. On the other hand, some MPN will be trapped in the polymer matrix through hydrophobic interaction between MPN and the NMP molecules hanging on the crosslinked PHEMA backbones (Scheme 2). Finally, a transparent and elastic organogel has been successfully obtained (Fig. 1(c)).
3.2. Ionic conductivities of the electrolytes
The ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is a very important parameter for DSCs, which will be largely influenced by the solvents. Here, the ionic conductivities of a series of liquid electrolytes in binary solvent systems with different volume ratios were investigated firstly. As shown in Table 1, the conductivity of the liquid electrolyte in pure NMP is 2.07 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. With increasing the volume ratio of MPN/NMP, the conductivity was gradually enhanced and the value reached 5.64 × 10−3 S cm−1 when the content of MPN was up to 66.7%.

As seen in Table 1, when the volume ratio of MPN/NMP continues increasing, better ionic conductivities will be achieved for the liquid electrolyte itself. It is suggested that MPN with large dielectric constant and low viscosity48 with respect to NMP, will facilitate better solubility of LiI and the faster diffusion of the electroactive species. On the other hand, in view of the different solvation ability (denoted as donor number (DN)47) between MPN and NMP toward the I−, I3− and Li+ ions, higher DNNMP = 27.320 will lead to relatively stronger solvation interaction and lower ionic conductivity as well. However, to the polymer gel electrolyte, its homogeneity has to be considered first, too much MPN (over 75%) in the mixture will result in the phase disengagement and appearance of white precipitates, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Hence, MPN/NMP mixed solvent (volume ratio = 2:1) is adopted for the following investigation and the weight ratio of the polymer to the organic cosolvent in the gels is about 0.124.
By immersing the organogel into the corresponding liquid electrolyte containing I3−/I− ions and additives, the polymer gel electrolyte was achieved. The temperature dependent ionic conductivities of the gel electrolyte (the composition of solvent is fixed at MPN:NMP (v/v) = 2:1) over a range from 25 °C to 85 °C have been investigated using blocking electrodes by an ac impedance technique and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  The conductivities of the gel electrolyte at different temperatures and the VTF fitting: (a) lnσ versus 1/T plots; (b) ln(σT1/2) versus 1/(T − T0) plots. 
A better fit to the empirical-phenomenological Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) eqn (1) and (2) is observed: σ = AT−1/2 exp[−Ea/R(T − T0)](1) ln(σT1/2) = −Ea/R(T − T0) + lnA(2)
In eqn (1), σ is the conductivity, A is a pre-exponential factor proportional to the number of carrier ions, Ea has the dimension of energy, R is the molar gas constant, T is the absolute temperature and T0 is a reference temperature usually associated with the ideal glass transition temperature at which “free” volume disappears, or the temperature at which the conformational entropy becomes zero.50Fig. 3(a) shows the conductivity-temperature relationship directly fitted with eqn (1). It is seen that the fitted curve matches the original experimental values very well. Therefore, according to the VTF equation, the conductivity of our gel electrolyte system is dominated by the relaxation of the host polymer and the mobility of the solvent molecules. That is to say, the conductivity of the electrolyte increases with the increasing temperature, indicating the larger free volume of the solvent at higher temperature. Moreover, the plots of ln(σT1/2) versus 1/(T − T0) are also presented in Fig. 3(b). Excellent linearity with the correlation coefficient of 0.9999 is observed and the activation energy Ea is calculated to be 1.376 kJ mol−1 through the slope of the fitted curve. Here T0 is the ideal glass transition temperature, and usually lies 35–50 K below the glass transition temperature (Tg), which could be measured by differential scanning calorimeter. In this work, the value of T0 = 209.4 K is estimated from the fitting procedure (Fig. 3(a)). The conductivity of the polymer gel electrolyte at room temperature is 4.54 × 10−3 S cm−1, which is slightly lower than the corresponding liquid electrolyte.
3.3. The ion diffusion in the electrolyte
Due to the large excess of iodide ions relative to triiodide ions in the electrolyte and the larger radius of the later ones, I3− ions are the current-limiting species in the electrolyte. So the apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of triiodide at 25 °C in both liquid electrolyte and the corresponding polymer gel electrolyte were determined by measuring the steady-state currents using an ultramicroelectrode technique. The voltammograms are shown in Fig. 4 and the cathodic current corresponds to the reduction of I3−. The apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of I3− are estimated according to eqn (3):51 Iss = 4nFDappC*r(3)
 Fig. 4  Steady-state voltammograms of the optimum liquid electrolyte and polymer gel electrolyte, T = 25 °C, scan rate of 5 mV s−1. 
in which Iss is the limiting current, n is the number of transferred electrons per molecule, F is the Faraday constant, Dapp is the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species, C* is the bulk concentration of the electroactive species in the electrolyte and r is the Pt ultramicroelectrode radius. From Fig. 4 and eqn (3), Dapp of I3− in the optimum liquid electrolyte is 2.2 × 10−6 cm2s−1. After the gelation of the liquid electrolyte by the polymer network, Dapp (I3−) decreases to 1.8 × 10−6 cm2s−1, which could be attributed to the retardation of the ion transport by the polymer chain backbones.
3.4. The performance of the DSC fabricated with the polymer gel electrolyte

J-V curves of the DSC fabricated with our polymer gel electrolyte under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) and in dark are illustrated in Fig. 5. The performance of the cell using the corresponding liquid electrolyte is also given for comparison. The parameters of the liquid DSC and quasi-solid-state DSC (QS-DSC) are Jsc = 14.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 733 mV, FF = 0.715 and Jsc = 14.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 747 mV, FF = 0.696, respectively. The total light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the QS-DSC is 7.46%, a little inferior to that of the liquid type cell (7.63%). The similarity of the cell performance is mainly assigned to the ionic conductivity and the diffusion coefficients of I3− in our polymer gel electrolyte are very close to those in the corresponding liquid electrolyte (e.g. 4.54 × 10−3 S cm−1vs. 5.64 × 10−3 S cm−1, 1.8 × 10−6 cm2 s−1vs. 2.2 × 10−6 cm2s−1). Here, we found that the open circuit voltage of the cell employing gel electrolyte was slightly higher (14 mV). This result is reproducible. We have tested more than 10 cells, and all the open circuit voltages of the gel electrolyte based DSCs are slightly higher than those of liquid type cells. A possible explanation is that the polymer host will cover the naked TiO2 surface to prevent the recombination between the conduction band electrons and the I3− ions in the electrolyte.
 Fig. 5  
J-V curves of the DSCs fabricated with polymer gel electrolyte as well as liquid electrolyte under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) and in dark. 
To further understand the interfacial recombination, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 6. In the dark under forward bias, electrons are injected into the TiO2 photoanode and transported through the mesoscopic TiO2 network. Meanwhile, I− is oxidized to I3− at the counter electrode and the triiodide diffuses to the TiO2 electrode to capture the electrons from the porous film at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface.52 The interfacial impedance caused by the electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 film to triiodide in the electrolyte could be described by the semicircle in intermediate-frequency region in the Nyquist plot. Larger diameter of the middle frequency semicircle means the larger recombination resistance.23,33,53Fig. 6(a) presents the Nyquist diagram of the DSCs fabricated with liquid electrolyte and polymer gel electrolyte measured in dark under forward bias. By fitting the experimental data with the equivalent circuits shown in the inset of Fig. 6(a), charge transfer resistances (RCT2) of 52.17 Ω and 92.31 Ω can be obtained for the liquid electrolyte and polymer gel electrolyte, respectively, which means the slower electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface for the gel electrolyte based device. The Bode phase plots are illustrated in Fig. 6(b). It can be seen that the corresponding characteristic frequency decreases when the liquid electrolyte is substituted by the polymer gel electrolyte, suggesting the longer electron lifetime49 in the cell fabricated with quasi-solid electrolyte. The slower recombination kinetics may be caused by the polymer matrix which is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface and suppresses the back electron transfer from the porous film to the I3−. As we know, to the recycling photoelectrochemical system, the Voc can be described as follows:45 (4) where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, e is the electronic elementary charge, Iinj is the flux of electron injection from the dye molecules, ncb is the concentration of electrons at the conduction band of TiO2, ket is the rate constant of I3− dark reaction at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, and the [I3−] is the concentration of I3− in the electrolyte. The adsorbed polymers act as an insulating barrier to reduce the interfacial electron transfer rate (ket) from the conduction band of TiO2 to I3− (dark current) and as a result, increase the Voc. This is consistent with the result provided by the measurement of dark current. As shown in Fig. 5, it can also be seen that the existence of polymer matrix could reduce the dark current, which indicates the slighter charge recombination at the dyed TiO2 electrode/gel electrolyte interface.23,33,53 Similar phenomenon was also reported by Han et al.11

3.5. Stability test of the DSC fabricated with the polymer gel electrolyte

Fig. 7 presents the normalized efficiencies of the devices stored in ambient condition versus conservation time, which were tested every two or three days during 1000 h. Preliminary results showed that the stability of the QS-DSC is better than the liquid one and the efficiency of the QS-DSC after 1000 h is almost the same as the initial value, indicating that the polymer gel electrolyte is encouraging to alleviate the sealing problem of DSCs. Furthermore, a thermal stability to accelerate aging test at 50 °C between the two kinds of cells with liquid electrolyte and polymer gel electrolyte was also investigated. The efficiency of the polymer gel electrolyte based device retained 85% of its initial value after 1000 h while that of the liquid one retained only 57% of the fresh cell. The relatively rapid fading of the liquid cell's performance was mainly caused by the unsatisfactory sealing technique of the device, especially under high temperature. If perfect sealing techniques will be developed in our laboratory, we believe that the stabilities of both liquid electrolyte-based DSCs and gel electrolyte-based DSCs can be well improved during long term storage. Even so, the result here reveals that the polymer network could effectively hinder the leakage of the organic solvent so that the gel electrolyte based DSC exhibits better stability than the corresponding device filled with liquid electrolyte, at least under our existing sealing conditions.

4. Conclusions
A simple optimization of poly (β-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) PHEMA-based organogel polymer electrolyte is developed, which is synthesized on a single solution polymerization in MPN/NMP binary solvent. The interaction between the polymer matrix and the solvent has been investigated. The electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity and its conduction behavior is revealed to be dominated by the relaxation of the polymer backbones and the solvent free volume, which well conforms to the VTF equation. The apparent diffusion coefficients of triiodide ions in liquid and polymer gel electrolytes have been calculated to be 2.2 × 10−6 cm2s−1 and 1.8 × 10−6 cm2s−1, respectively, by the measurement of the diffusion limited currents. Using this gel electrolyte to fabricate QS-DSC, an efficiency as high as 7.5% has been achieved. Besides, a preliminary long-term stability test revealed that this quasi-solid-state electrolyte exhibited good stability after a 1000 h thermal test in comparison with the DSCs based on corresponding liquid electrolyte. The polymer PHEMA is nontoxic, biologically compatible and environmentally friendly. The gel electrolyte prepared in this work is freestanding, could be made into any shape and exhibits the potential for application on flexible DSCs with different geometries in the future. By further improving the quality of the TiO2 porous film, higher energy conversion efficiency could be expected.
