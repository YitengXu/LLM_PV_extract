The thermal stability, and optical and electronic properties of these materials were investigated. In thin solid films of ISC 1–4, the electron mobility measured using the conventional CELIV technique was in the range of 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ISC 1–3 substances were found to be applicable as electron transport materials for perovskite solar cells. For the ISC 1 based PSC, the power conversion efficiency of 12.02% was demonstrated under AM 1.5 G irradiation.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention from researchers worldwide, since PSCs are promising photovoltaic materials due to their low cost of fabrication and high efficiencies.1,2 A typical device is based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, such as widely used methylammonium lead halides, CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3), where X = Cl, Br, or I, as a light absorber layer that is sandwiched in between hole and electron transport layers.3 It should be noted that PSCs are evolved from dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) technology,4 since Miyasaka and colleagues for the first time employed MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 as photosensitizers in DSSCs with liquid electrolytes and the formed devices demonstrated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.13% and 3.81%, respectively.5 In 2012, the first solid-state PSCs including MAPbI3 as a light-absorbing material and spiro-MeOTAD as a hole transport material (HTM) were described by Park and colleagues,6 which were able to reach a PCE of 9.7%, while Snaith and colleagues were able to reach a PCE of 10.9% for the same structure of the PSC device.7 Since that time, intensive research works started in the field of PSCs, where various modifications of PSC components were performed to obtain devices with better efficiency and stability2,8,9 In this context, the design of organic semiconductors based on π-extended molecules is one of the most promising ways to develop high-performance PSC devices. There are two main types of PSC devices with regular (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) architectures, depending on the placement of the electron transport layer (ETL) or hole transport layer (HTL) on the front electrode of the solar cell. In the regular n–i–p type devices, it is not only spiro-MeOTAD used as the HTM for PSCs,10 but also many other HTMs based on various heteroaromatic scaffolds were recently developed for the same purpose.11–14 Among them, the thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI) ring system was used as an electron-rich part of HTM structures, including TI derivatives and TI-cored compounds, for regular perovskite solar cells.15–17 Note that currently the record PSC efficiency of 25.6% is shown on n–i–p structures.18 Such n–i–p structure devices are mainly fabricated on a metal oxide-based ETL (TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2) whose deposition requires high energy consumption.
Significant progress has also been made in the development of PSCs with inverted p–i–n architecture, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.0%.19 Various electron transport materials (ETMs) based on π-conjugated organic molecules were used in such devices.20–22 Fullerene and its derivatives are the most common ETMs for inverted p–i–n PSCs23,24 due to their relatively high electron mobility and electron affinity, and the ability of some of them (PC60BM) to dissolve in organic solvents. At the same time, fullerenes have poor light absorption, limited modification of electronic properties, and morphological instability.25 Moreover, the synthesis and purification of fullerenes makes them cost ineffective materials. In contrast, organic semiconductors based on donor–π-linker–acceptor (D–π–A) molecules are attractive to be ETMs, since facile synthetic procedures are often used for the preparation of such molecules. This allows readily preparing the desired compounds in a gram scale. Finally, the optical, electrochemical and electronic properties of D–π–A molecules can be easily varied by modifying their donor, linker and acceptor moieties. Moreover, since D–π–A molecules are dipoles, incorporating a layer of D–π–A molecules into PSCs can improve device performance by properly arranging the dipole molecules in the layer.26
In this study, we present (a) the synthesis of four new D–π–A compounds ISC 1–4 based on the thieno[3,2-b]indole ring system as an electron donor part and the benzo[b]thieno[2,3-d]thiophen-3(2H)-one ring system as an acceptor part and (b) possible use of these compounds as an ETM in inverted architecture PSCs. It should be noted that the construction of these molecules is based on our original strategy that we used previously for the preparation of different thieno[3,2-b]indole-based D–π–A compounds.27–29
2. Experimental section
The preparation procedures for the target materials ISC 1–4 and common data on the analytical equipment and methods used are provided in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
In regard to the synthesis, new D–π–A materials ISC 1–4 were readily prepared by the Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes 3a–d with fused thiophen-3(2H)-one 430 in 83–96% yields (Scheme 1). In turn, aldehydes 3a–d were synthesized from 2-(thien-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]indole 1 by its subsequence alkylation with alkyl bromides (R = ethyl, n-butyl, 2-ethylhexyl, and n-pentadecyl) in the presence of NaH and formylation of the formed derivatives 2a–d with the POCl3–DMF complex in accordance with the Vilsmeier–Haack–Arnold protocol.27 Thus, the overall construction of the target molecules ISC 1–4 was performed without any transition-metal-catalyzed processes using easily available substrate 1, described in our previous work.31 It is important that, during this study, we have for the first time used modification of the benzo[b]thieno[2,3-d]thiophen ring-system as an electron acceptor moiety for the design of D–π–A structures. On the other hand, ISC 1–4 can be considered as π-extended analogs of thioaurones (2-arylidenebenzo[b]thiophen-3(2H)-ones) that are well known photoactive materials.32
 Scheme 1  The synthesis of compounds ISC 1–4. 
The isodensity surface plots of the electron-density distributions of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) for ISC 1–4 are shown in Fig. S1 (see in ESI,†). The HOMOs of ISC 1–4 were mainly concentrated in the thieno[3,2-b]indole core and thiophene unit π-linker, while the LUMOs of ISC 1–4 were largely located on the benzo[b]thieno[2,3-d]thiophen-3(2H)-one core and thiophene unit π-linker. This distribution of HOMO and LUMO levels in the molecules of ISC 1–4 indicates that transition from the HOMO to the LUMO can be considered as a charge-transfer transition.33
The thermogravimetric analysis curves of the synthesized D–π–A compounds ISC 1–4 under an air atmosphere are shown in Fig. S2 (see in ESI,†). All compounds ISC 1–4 showed two-stage decomposition processes and were stable up to 345 °C, corresponding to a 5% weight loss (Table 1). These data show that the thermal stability of the obtained molecules is an advantage for many applications, especially in optoelectronic devices.

The absorption and normalized emission spectra of D–π–A molecules ISC 1–4 in CHCl3 are shown in Fig. 1a, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The UV-vis absorption spectra of ISC 1–4 in solution exhibit two distinct absorption bands. The first maximum wavelength absorption at 300–400 nm could be assigned to the localized π–π* transitions, while the broad absorption band at 410–625 nm seems related to intramolecular charge transfer (πD–π*A) from the donor part of thieno[3,2-b]indole to the acceptor part of benzo[b]thieno[2,3-d]thiophen-3(2H)-one. The molar extinction coefficient at the maximum of the band is from 41400 to 42600 M−1 cm−1. The maximum fluorescence of the compounds ISC 1–4 is observed at 630 nm.

Advantages of new D–π–A molecules ISC 1–4 based on thieno[3,2-b]indole are capable of forming solid-phase layers (film coatings) of nanoscale thickness by pouring from a liquid solution. Fig. 1b shows the normalized absorption spectra of the D–π–A molecules ISC 1–4 in thin films, obtained by spin coating from CHCl3 solution. Based on these data, the band gap was calculated from the long-wavelength absorption edge (Table 1). ISC 1 shows a bathochromic shift of absorption bands compared to absorption in CHCl3 solution, whereas the absorption spectra of thin films ISC 2 and ISC 3 have a hypsochromic shift of 8 and 14 nm, respectively. The most plausible explanation for these facts is the intermolecular interaction that occurs in a thin film. In addition, for ISC 4, a shoulder appears at 620 nm in the main absorption band. As shown in Fig. 1b (the inset), in the micrographs of the ISC 4 thin film, there are multiple overlaps of ribbon-like stripes on top of each other. We believe that this is due to the formation of J-aggregates.
The HOMO levels of ISC 1–4 measured using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) are shown in Fig. 2. The D–π–A molecules ISC 1–3 have lower-lying levels of the HOMO and LUMO compared to ISC 4, which is favorable for obtaining highly efficient optoelectronic devices based on them (Table 1).

The surface topography of thin films ISC 1–4 studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) is shown in Fig. 3. Thin films ISC 2–4 were obtained by spin coating from CHCl3 solution, whereas ISC 1 thin films were prepared using a thermal vacuum evaporation technique because of the poor solubility of ISC 1 (<10 mg ml−1). The AFM images show an increase in the surface roughness of the film in the case of ISC 3 and ISC 4 as compared to ISC 1 and ISC 2.
 Fig. 3  The AFM topography images of the ISC 1–4 thin films. 
This is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for the ISC 1–4 thin films. As shown in Fig. 4, the ISC 1 and ISC 2 films have no peaks in the diffractograms indicating completely amorphous states of them. At the same time, domains of electron density ordering associated with the formation of crystallites are observed for ISC 3 and ISC 4 with crystallite sizes (coherent scattering regions) of 75 and 115 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 4  XRD data of thin films ISC 1–4. 
To reveal the relationship between the film structure and the charge carrier transport in the ISC 1–4 films, the charge carrier mobility was measured using the technique of charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV). The obtained results presented in Table 2 show that electrons are more mobile than holes in ISC 1–4 films. The electron mobility increases in sequence from ISC 1 to ISC 4, which is associated with the presence of crystallites formed from stacks of ISC 3 and ISC 4 molecules, respectively. Apparently, the length of the alkyl substituent at the nitrogen atom of the TI fragment reduces steric hindrance between molecules and promotes intermolecular interactions, increasing the crystallinity of the sample in a thin film. The increase in mobility in the case of ISC 2 compared to ISC 1 is associated with an increase in the film roughness from 0.720 to 1.834 nm.

Taking into account the position of the frontier molecular orbitals and the values of the electron mobility, the studied ISC compounds can be considered as an ETM for the electron transport layer (ETL) in PSCs, excluding ISC 4, since their HOMO and LUMO levels do not properly correspond to the valence band and conduction band of MAPbI3 (Fig. 5b).

To study the photovoltaic properties of PSCs with an ETL based on ISC 1–3, devices with inverted architecture ITO/NiO (10 nm)/MAPbI3 (400 nm)/ETL (20 nm)/BCP (7.5 nm)/Al (80 nm) were fabricated. A PSC with PC60BM ETL was used as a reference device. Thin films ISC 1–3 were obtained by spin coating from CHCl3 solution. In the case of ISC 1, a thin film was also deposited by the thermal vacuum evaporation technique.
The energy diagram of the functional layers and the J–V curves of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 3.

The perovskite solar cells with an ISC 1 ETL obtained using the thermal vacuum evaporation technique demonstrate the highest PCE of 12.02% (Jsc = 21.52 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.57) compared to the devices with ISC 2 and 3 ETLs. This is most likely due to the increased roughness and the inappropriate morphology of the ISC 2 and 3 ETLs compared to the ISC 1 ETL (Fig. 3 and 4) and is not related to the effect of the rear ETL on the optical properties of the devices. The same reasons are probably responsible for S-shaped J-V curves of the PSCs based on ISC 2 and ISC 3.
At the same time, the ISC 1 ETL-based devices exhibit a higher value of the short circuit current density compared to that of the reference sample with the PC60BM ETL. We assume that the non-spherical D–π–A structure may promote enhanced overlap of the LUMO between ISC 1 molecules in an appropriate direction and improve the transfer of electrons from the perovskite to the aluminum cathode. Moreover, ISC 1 ETL-based devices demonstrate no hysteresis in the J–V curves (Fig. S7, ESI†). The absence of the hysteresis may indicate the passivation of defects at the perovskite interface due to the formation of a coordination bond Pb–S as shown elsewhere.38,39
Devices with an ISC 1 ETL deposited by the spin-coating technique demonstrate lower performance parameters compared to those with the ETL obtained by thermal vacuum evaporation. Apparently, during the evaporation of the solvent (CHCl3), the molecules of ISC 1 do not have time to orient themselves in the required way, while during evaporation, due to the slow rate of this process, the orientation of the molecules occurs under the action of the dipole moment.
In addition, the PSC devices exposed to air degraded within a few hours. The degradation is believed to occur either in perovskite since the thermal and thermal-oxidative stability of the ISC 1-3 compounds was confirmed by thermogravimetry (Fig. S2, ESI†).
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized new D–π–A compounds ISC 1–4, bearing a thieno[3,2-b]indole core as an electron-donating part and benzo[b]thieno[2,3-d]thiophen-3(2H)-one as an electron–acceptor part and used these compounds as electron transport layers for PSCs. Thus, the synthesized compounds can be considered as non-fullerene materials for the charge-transport layer of solar cells and photodiodes, while the positions of their HOMO and LUMO levels should be taken into account. Besides, further modification of their structures by addition of the functional substituents bearing electron withdrawing groups, e.g., fluorine atoms, can be a promising way to obtain various new thieno[3,2-b]indole-containing D–π–A compounds with improved properties.
