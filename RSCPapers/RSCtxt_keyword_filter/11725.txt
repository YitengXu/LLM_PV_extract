    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 24th April 2023AbstractInverted CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells offer merits for tandem and indoor photovoltaics. Compared to the regular structure (n–i–p), realizing high-efficiency inverted devices is still challenging due to severe energy losses at the contact of the p-type perovskite and n-type electron transporting layer (ETL). Herein, we develop a surface n-type band bending strategy to mitigate such energy loss. It is discovered that the post-deposition of propylamine hydrochloride induces a p to n-type transition at the CsPbI3 surface to accelerate the separation and extraction of the electrons while passivating the surface defects. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted CsPbI3 devices reaches record-high values of 20.17% (19.67% on average) under 1-sun equivalent illumination and 38.93% under indoor LED light (1000 lux, 307 μW cm−2). Moreover, such inverted devices maintain ∼97% PCE after light soaking for 792 h at the open circuit condition while the control samples degrade to ∼11% in 552 h.

Broader context
All-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite materials have attracted increasing attention because of their unique advantages (e.g., wide band-gap (∼1.7 eV), simple components with organic-free and single-halide, and ideal thermal stability) for perovskite-based tandems (e.g., perovskite/Si). Inverted CsPbI3 PSCs are more compatible with commercial silicon bottom cells in view of the fabrication of monolithic perovskite-based tandems. However, realizing high-efficiency inverted CsPbI3 devices is a challenge. The CsPbI3 perovskite deposited on the hole transporting layer features a p-type semiconductor characteristic. When contacting the ETL, i.e., [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (i.e., PCBM), a large energy level mismatch between CsPbI3 and PCBM leads to the formation of a huge electron transfer barrier. In this work, we developed a surface n-type band bending strategy to mitigate the energy loss at the perovskite/ETL interface. Post-deposition treatment of CsPbI3 with propylamine hydrochloride not only caused a p to n-type transition at the CsPbI3 surface but also induced a favorable energy level alignment with the ETL to accelerate the separation and extraction of the electrons. An efficiency of 20.17% with a high FF of 0.84 was achieved for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported on inverted CsPbI3 PSCs.

Introduction
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become the most promising next-generation photovoltaics (PVs).1–3 Among the various components, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been intensively investigated with the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching 25.7% for single-junction devices and 31.3% for perovskite/Si tandem solar cells.4 However, the volatile organic components (such as MA and FA) in these hybrid perovskites are thermal instability channels of the devices. Outgassing of hybrid perovskites has been observed under external stresses such as heat (80 °C in the case of MAPbI3 and 95 °C in the case of FAPbI3).5–8 What's more, hybrid wide bandgap perovskites (i.e., ∼1.7 eV) are mainly composed of FA/MA cations and I/Br anions. Phase separation (halogens or cations) extremely hinders their long-term operation stability.9,10 All-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite exhibits a wide bandgap of 1.7 eV, which is ideal for tandem11 and indoor photovoltaic applications.12 Compared with hybrid wide bandgap perovskites, all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite is composed of a single halogen (I−) and cation (Cs+). Therefore, no phase separation occurs during the device operation. In addition, the complete substitution of volatile organic components with Cs+ eliminates the thermal instability channels of devices.13
In recent years, the black phases of γ- and β-CsPbI3 films were successfully obtained and developed towards stable and high-performance CsPbI3 PSCs.14–16 Most of these studies focused on the regular structure (i.e., n–i–p structure). Many strategies such as component management,17–22 molecular regulation (bulk)23–29 and surface engineering,30–35 have been developed to boost the PCE of regular structured CsPbI3 PSCs over 21%.29 However, a key limitation of the regular structured PSCs is that they are not compatible with commercial bottom cells (such as Si with a p–i–n structure and Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) with a p–n structure) in view of the fabrication of monolithic perovskite-based tandems,36–40 which are believed to be the next big thing in PVs. From this perspective, it is a necessity to develop inverted CsPbI3 PSCs. Moreover, the dopant-free hole transport layers (HTLs) in the inverted structure are more stable than the spiro-OMeTAD doped with hygroscopic dopants in the regular structure, resulting in enhanced operational stability.41,42 In addition, charge transporting layers in inverted CsPbI3 could be fabricated at a low temperature, which is a challenge in the regular structured CsPbI3 (i.e., the mostly employed TiO2 electron transporting layer (ETL) requires 500 °C annealing).
Inverted CsPbI3 PSCs with a PCE over 11% were reported by Huang et al. in 2017.43 Afterwards, a few methods (e.g., crystallization kinetics regulation44–46 and surface treatment47,48) have been developed by Fang and the PCE rose to 19.84% with enhanced stability. Nevertheless, the progress of inverted CsPbI3 PSCs has fallen behind the regular structured ones. Realizing high-efficiency inverted CsPbI3 devices is still a challenge due to the severe energy losses at the contact of the perovskite and ETL. (I) The CsPbI3 perovskite deposited on the HTL features a p-type semiconductor characteristic. When contacting the ETL, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (i.e., PCBM), a large energy level mismatch between CsPbI3 and PCBM leads to the formation of a huge energy-level gap. (II) The surface of the CsPbI3 film contains a large density of defects (such as under-coordinated Pb2+ defect),49–51 causing serious non-radiative recombination. As a consequence, state-of-the-art inverted CsPbI3 PSCs suffer from large Voc and FF losses.52–55
Herein, we developed a surface n-type band bending strategy to mitigate the energy loss at the perovskite/ETL interface. By post-deposition treatment of CsPbI3 with propylamine hydrochloride (PACl), a p to n-type transition at the CsPbI3 surface was achieved to present a favorable energy level alignment with the ETL for accelerating the separation and extraction of the electrons. The chloride ion also passivated the surface defects. As a result, the Voc and FF of inverted CsPbI3 devices increased significantly from 0.97 V to 1.13 V and 0.70 to 0.84, respectively. The PCE rose from 14.43% to 20.17% under 1-sun equivalent illumination, which is the highest value for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs so far. The device also exhibited a record-high PCE of 38.93% under indoor LED light (1000 lux, 307 μW cm−2). Importantly, such inverted devices maintained ∼96% of the original PCE after storing in a N2 environment for 1032 h and ∼97% of the original PCE after light soaking for 792 h while the control devices without treatment sharply degraded to ∼11% PCE in 552 h.
Results and discussion
The CsPbI3 films were deposited on the dopant-free poly [3-(4-carboxybutyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3CT) HTL by a one-step spin-coating process. A two-step annealing process was adopted to promote the decomposition of dimethylamine hydroiodide (DMAI) and enhance the crystallinity of CsPbI3. PCBM was spin-coated onto the CsPbI3 as the ETL. The deposition process is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The inverted devices could be obtained with the structure of FTO/P3CT/CsPbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag (labeled as “control”). Surface energy level structure has been shown to severely affect the carrier extraction and the efficiency of the inverted devices using hybrid perovskites.52–55 However, its impact on inverted CsPbI3 devices is barely understood. Herein, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted to reveal the energy position of the valence-band maximum (VBM) and Fermi level of the CsPbI3 and PCBM films (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). Besides, UV-vis spectra and the Tauc plot were employed to obtain the bandgap and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the CsPbI3 and PCBM films (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Based on these analyses, a schematic energy-level diagram at the perovskite/ETL interfaces was plotted in Fig. 1A. The Fermi level of the control CsPbI3 films was close to the VBM (0.74 eV), indicating the p-type nature.47 When contacting PCBM, the ΔECBM of the CsPbI3 and PCBM was 0.35 eV, and the large energy level mismatch may lead to the formation of a huge energy-level gap and serious non-radiative recombination at the interface.

To mitigate the energy loss at the CsPbI3/PCBM interface, a thin layer of PACl was deposited atop the CsPbI3 films (the films and devices were labeled as “w PACl”). The surface termination could be changed and an n-type surface may be obtained with the coverage of PACl.52 The schematic illustrations are exhibited in Fig. 1B. We proposed that the Cl− would substitute I− to form the Pb–Cl bond on the surface of CsPbI3, and the propylamine (PA+) would cap on the upper surface of CsPbI3 to passivate the surface defects (i.e., under-coordinated Pb2+ defect). The photo-generated electron extraction capability at the CsPbI3/PCBM interface was investigated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL). Indeed, the PL intensity was quenched significantly after PACl post-deposition treatment, suggesting enhanced carrier electron extraction capability (Fig. 1C). Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurement was performed to reveal the distribution of PACl. The intensities of Cl− and PA+ signals were significantly decreased after the first few seconds of sputtering, indicating that both the Cl− and PA+ ions were located on the surface of the CsPbI3 films (Fig. 1D). UPS measurements were carried out on the sample with PACl and the surface energy level structure was plotted in Fig. 1E. In contrast to the control sample, the surface of the sample with PACl converted to an n-type nature. This observation suggested a p to n-type transition from CsPbI3 bulk to the surface. The surface n-type band bending characteristic facilitated the transport of electrons from the bulk to the surface. More interestingly, the PACl induced a favorable n-type doping level, resulting in a negligible ΔECBM between CsPbI3 and PCBM, eliminating the electron extraction gap and allowing smooth electron transfer at the CsPbI3/PCBM interface.
The morphology of the control and w PACl films was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), both showing compact nature without a pinhole (Fig. 2A and B). In the case of the w PACl film, PACl adsorbed onto the surface of the CsPbI3 film uniformly. Moreover, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping indicated the uniform distribution of PACl (Fig. S6, ESI†). XRD measurements were carried out to verify the crystal structure of the control and w PACl perovskite films (Fig. 2C). Both of the CsPbI3 films were tetragonal γ-phase (Fig. S7, ESI†).15,56 Neither low dimensional nor secondary phase appeared between 3°–10° for the w PACl sample, indicating that the PA+ mainly capped onto the surface of the CsPbI3 film rather than being doped into the crystal lattice (Fig. S8, ESI†).57 We further conducted XPS measurements to analyze the surface chemical states of the control and w PACl films. The Pb 4f spectra were shifted from 142.95 eV and 138.10 eV to higher binding energies of 143.30 eV and 138.40 eV. This could be ascribed to the formation of a Pb–Cl bond (Fig. 2D).17,33 Besides, no N 1s signal was detected in the control film (Fig. 2E), indicating that the all-inorganic CsPbI3 was successfully prepared without residual DMAI. After PACl treatment, the N 1s and Cl 2p signals appeared (Fig. 2E and F), suggesting the presence of PACl on the surface of CsPbI3. The Cs 3d and I 3d spectra are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). A slight shift was observed in the I 3d spectra, which could be ascribed to the incorporation of Cl−.

Furthermore, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on the control and w PACl samples (Fig. 3A). The control CsPbI3 film presented a weak emission peak at 728 nm. In contrast, the w PACl film showed a substantially increased peak intensity, which is an indication of the reduced non-radiative recombination. A small blue shift of the PL peak to 726 nm was observed. This could be attributed to the incorporation of Cl− and the suppression of shallow defects.58 Carrier lifetimes were extracted from time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Fig. 3B and Table S2, ESI†). The w PACl films exhibited a longer lifetime (63.25 ns) than the control film (14.87 ns), which is another piece of evidence verifying the passivation effect of PACl.

Electrical characterizations were carried out to understand the defect density and carrier recombination kinetics. A hole-only device (FTO/P3CT/CsPbI3/PACl/Ag) was firstly established to evaluate the defect density through space-charge limit current (SCLC) measurement (Fig. 3C). The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) decreased from 0.343 V to 0.153 V. The defect density (Ntrap) could be obtained by the following equation:59 (1)where ε0, e, ε and L represent the vacuum permittivity, electron charge, relative dielectric constant and film thickness, respectively. Ntrap was significantly reduced from 1.66 × 1015 cm−3 to 7.39 × 1014 cm−3, agreeing with the XPS results. The defect passivation effect mainly originated from the formation of Pb–Cl in the perovskite crystal lattice.
Mott–Schottky curves were also used to evaluate the built-in potential (Vbi) according to ref. 60 (Fig. 3D). The Vbi of the w PACl device (1.08 V) was larger than that of the control device (0.95 V), implying that the driving force for carrier separation was enhanced and the electron–hole recombination was reduced after treatment of PACl.61 Furthermore, the w PACl sample demonstrated a smaller dark current than the control sample (Fig. 3E).33
The open-circuit voltage dependence on light intensity measurements were also conducted on the devices with a structure of FTO/P3CT/CsPbI3/PACl/PCBM/BCP/Ag (Fig. 3F). The relationship could be calculated according to the following equation:59 (2)where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature and q is the elementary charge. The ideality factor of the control device was calculated to be 1.54 kT/q, which was obviously larger than that of the w PACl device (1.31 kT/q), indicating the reduction of the defect-induced recombination or preferential recombination at the interface.62
Furthermore, we prepared inverted CsPbI3 PSCs based on the structure of FTO/P3CT/CsPbI3/PACl/PCBM/BCP/Ag to evaluate the photovoltaic performance. A cross-sectional SEM image of the CsPbI3 device with PACl is shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The concentration of PACl was first optimized (Fig. S11 and Table S3, ESI†). The device PCE increased from 14.43% for the control sample to 20.11% for the sample with 1 mg mL−1 PACl, which exhibited the highest Voc of 1.15 V. The champion PSC was further pushed to a PCE of 20.17% with a high FF of 0.84 via optimization of the fabrication process (Fig. 4A and Table S4, ESI†).

The devices were aged under LED irradiation in a N2 environment at the open circuit condition. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE among the reported inverted CsPbI3 PSCs (Fig. 4B and Table S5, ESI†). The hysteresis behavior was studied and the results are presented in Fig. S12 and Table S6 (ESI†). A severe J–V hysteresis could be detected for the control device because of the unfavorable interface conditions. In contrast, the w PACl device exhibited negligible hysteresis with a reverse PCE of 19.97% and a forward PCE of 19.31%. The EQE spectrum and integrated current density of the w PACl device are shown in Fig. 4C. The current density obtained from the EQE spectrum was 20.67 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V measurement (below 5% deviation).
The photovoltaic parameter distributions are provided in Fig. 4D and E and Fig. S13 and Table S7 (ESI†). The average PCE of the w PACl devices reached 19.67%, which is much higher than the control devices (13.23%). This is mainly attributed to the enhancement in FF and Voc, agreeing well with the improved energy level alignment and the defect passivation enabled by PACl. A steady-state PCE of 19.60% was also demonstrated with a w PACl device (Fig. 4F). To understand the universality of this method, we investigated other Cl−-contained organic ammonium salts (i.e., MACl, iPACl, and BACl). The devices treated with Cl−-containing ammonium salts all presented significantly increased Voc and PCE (Fig. S14 and Table S8, ESI†).
In addition, CsPbI3 perovskite materials are suitable for indoor photovoltaic applications because of the wide bandgap (∼1.7 eV). The CsPbI3/PACl devices were also evaluated under various indoor LED light intensities, exhibiting PCEs of 33.82% under 250 lux, 37.13% under 500 lux, and 38.93% under 1000 lux, respectively (Fig. 4G and Table S9, ESI†). These are also the highest values reported for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs.
The stability of the PSCs with PACl was further investigated. Firstly, the devices were stored in a N2 glove box without any encapsulation. As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), the device maintained ∼96% of the original PCE after 1032 h (43 days). Secondly, the devices were continuously aged under LED irradiation in a N2 environment at the open circuit conditions (Fig. 4H). The control device decayed fast with a T80 lifetime of ∼160 h and a ∼11% original PCE after aging of 552 h (23 days). In contrast, the PSC with PACl treatment maintained ∼97% of the original PCE after 792 h (33 days). Thirdly, the unencapsulated devices were aged under a N2 atmosphere and at 85 °C. The device with PACl maintained ∼85% of its initial PCE, while the control device decayed fast with only ∼25% of its initial PCE after 118 h aging (Fig. S16, ESI†). Fourthly, the unencapsulated devices were aged under ambient conditions (10-20% R.H.). The device with PACl maintained ∼95% of its initial PCE after 648 h, while the control device decayed fast with only ∼42% of its initial PCE after 408 h (Fig. S17, ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, a surface n-type band bending strategy was developed for the inverted CsPbI3 PSCs to mitigate the energy losses at the CsPbI3/ETL interface. UPS and IPES measurements suggested that the post-deposition treatment of the CsPbI3 with PACl caused a p to n-type transition at the CsPbI3 surface. Such transition favored the energy level alignment between CsPbI3 and the ETL and thus accelerated the separation and transportation of the electrons, as indicated by the PL spectra. Systematical characterization indicated that the surface defects were simultaneously passivated by the formation of the Pb–Cl bond during the PACl treatment. Benefitting from these improvements, the fabricated inverted CsPbI3 devices achieved the record-high PCE of 20.17% (19.67% on average) under 1-sun equivalent illumination and 38.93% under indoor LED light (1000 lux, 307 μW cm−2). Moreover, the inverted device with PACl treatment maintained ∼97% of the original PCE after light soaking for 33 days at the open circuit condition while the control device sharply decayed to ∼11% PCE in 23 days. These results suggested that the present surface N-type band bending strategy paved the way for the development of highly efficient inverted CsPbI3 devices.

Broader context
All-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite materials have attracted increasing attention because of their unique advantages (e.g., wide band-gap (∼1.7 eV), simple components with organic-free and single-halide, and ideal thermal stability) for perovskite-based tandems (e.g., perovskite/Si). Inverted CsPbI3 PSCs are more compatible with commercial silicon bottom cells in view of the fabrication of monolithic perovskite-based tandems. However, realizing high-efficiency inverted CsPbI3 devices is a challenge. The CsPbI3 perovskite deposited on the hole transporting layer features a p-type semiconductor characteristic. When contacting the ETL, i.e., [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (i.e., PCBM), a large energy level mismatch between CsPbI3 and PCBM leads to the formation of a huge electron transfer barrier. In this work, we developed a surface n-type band bending strategy to mitigate the energy loss at the perovskite/ETL interface. Post-deposition treatment of CsPbI3 with propylamine hydrochloride not only caused a p to n-type transition at the CsPbI3 surface but also induced a favorable energy level alignment with the ETL to accelerate the separation and extraction of the electrons. An efficiency of 20.17% with a high FF of 0.84 was achieved for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported on inverted CsPbI3 PSCs.
