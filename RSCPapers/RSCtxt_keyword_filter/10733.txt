    , Accepted 9th December 2014First published on 11th December 2014AbstractA solar-driven dual photoelectrode photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) based on n-type semiconductor photoanode and p-type semiconductor photocathode is reported for wastewater treatment with simultaneous hydrogen production. The PFC shows a superior performance for phenol degradation and hydrogen production with a maximum TOC removal rate of 84.2% and a total hydrogen production rate of 86.8 μmol cm−2 in 8 hours which is much higher than other similar researches. Compared to the system comprised of a photoanode (photocathode) and Pt for phenol degradation (hydrogen production), the results prove that there is a synergistic effect between the two photoelectrodes. This is because the electrons are preferentially stored on the photocathode for hydrogen production and holes on the photoanode for pollutant degradation. Several semiconductors are chosen as photoelectrodes to investigate the factors influencing the performance of the PFC system. The VOC value of the PFC increases with the difference of Fermi level between the two photoelectrodes. This PFC system provides a new approach for efficient energy recovery from wastewater.
Introduction
Energy and environment quality are two major issues faced by countries in modern society.1,2 Simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery by solar energy conversion is an attractive and promising technology. As a result of the rapid development of industrialization, environmental pollution, especially water pollution, is becoming more and more serious due to rapidly increasing effluent discharges. As we know, pollutant degradation is the main purpose of traditional wastewater treatment methods, but a huge amount of chemical energy is ignored at the same time.3 It is urgent for us to seek new and efficient methods for wastewater treatment to eliminate pollution and obtain energy.
A microbial fuel cell (MFC) realizes the concept of generating electricity during the degradation of organic matter by a microbial community.4–6 The MFC converts the energy of organic pollutants present in wastewater into electric current. However, because of the relatively low current efficiency, researchers have switched to produce hydrogen with MFCs combined with electrocatalysis or photocatalysis.7,8 As is known, hydrogen is a kind of green energy because of no secondary pollution. However, use of MFCs is not feasible to treat some persistent organics due to their biorefractory nature. The harsh working conditions, slow electron transfer and complicated bacteria cultivation also obstruct the large-scale commercial application of MFCs.
As we know, light is a kind of cost-free, clean and convenient energy. So the idea of using light as a substitute for microorganisms has come to the fore. So a novel photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) system for hydrogen production has been proposed. Previously, many researchers focused on hydrogen production by PEC water reduction on a single photocatalyst.9,10 A highly active Cu2O/(ZnO/Al2O3)/TiO2/Pt photocathode has been used for water reduction.11 CdS-cluster-decorated graphene nanosheets have been applied for highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen production.12 Also, a two-electrode PEC system composed of Cu/nanoCu2O/NiOx photocathode and FTO/nanoWO3 photoanode has been used for PEC hydrogen production.13 However, the PEC system for hydrogen production needs external electric energy input. The cost and energy consumption are both high. As a result, this type of system is insufficient from the point of view of energy recovery.
At the same time, the PEC system has been used for organic waste degradation.14 A solar-driven biomass fuel cell has been used for electricity generation from wastewater.15 A single photoelectrode photocatalytic fuel cell (PFC) under light illumination has been applied for refractory organic pollutant degradation and simultaneous electricity generation.16–18 A visible light-driven PFC composed of BiOCl/Ti photoanode and Pt cathode has been used for organic pollutant degradation and electricity generation.19 A dual photoelectrode of WO3/W or TiO2/Ti as photoanode and Cu2O/Cu as photocathode under visible light illumination has been applied for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation.20,21 In conclusion, these works focus on the degradation of pollutants on the photoanode and the electricity generation performance. However, there are many factors affecting the performance of PFCs. No further research about specific mechanisms of PFCs is discussed. So it is meaningful to discover theoretical guidance for the selection of photoelectrodes in the PFC. Meanwhile, a PFC cannot only be used for simultaneous wastewater treatment in the anode area and energy recovery, but it is also considered that specific attention should be paid to the cathode reaction.
Therefore, a solar-driven dual photoelectrode PFC for simultaneous organic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production has come to the fore. This approach combines the advantages of the two systems mentioned above. As we know, the electrons and holes of a semiconductor will be separated under light illumination and there will be a photovoltage. For n-type semiconductor under light illumination photo-generated holes are the majority for oxidation. In contrast, for p-type semiconductor under light illumination photo-generated electrons are the majority for reduction.22,23 So we consider whether the photovoltage difference between two different semiconductors can be used for pollutant oxidation on photoanode and simultaneous hydrogen production on photocathode. If possible, the photoanode of the PFC should be an n-type semiconductor and have a good photocatalytic property for pollutant oxidation, such as TiO2, CdS and so on.24–30 The photocathode of the PFC should be a p-type semiconductor whose Ecb (vs. NHE) should be more negative than EH+/H2 of 0 V for the purpose of hydrogen production, such as Cu2O.31–34
To investigate simultaneous pollutant treatment and hydrogen production, a sealed quartz reactor is used for hydrogen collection which is shown in Fig. S1.† Phenol was selected as a representative organic pollutant to study the degradation performance of the PFC.35,36
Furthermore, the most important thing for the PFC is the operation mechanism. So for the study of the operation mechanism of the PFC, several n-type and p-type semiconductors have been chosen to verify its feasibility. Here, n-TiO2, n-CdS, n-CdSe and p-Cu2O have been chosen as the photoelectrode. Also, the same semiconductor with different microstructure has also been chosen. This work provides an effective and low energy consumption approach for simultaneous environmental pollutant disposal and energy recovery by using a photocatalytic system.
Experimental section
Electrode preparation

Photoanode. 
TiO2 NRs/FTO. 
Titanium butoxide (0.35 mL) (Aladdin, AR, 99.0%) was added dropwise into a HCl (SCRC, AR, 36.0–38.0%) aqueous solution (6 mol L−1, 15 mL) under continuous stirring for 30 min at room temperature. Then the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and a piece of FTO sample was immersed in the solution with the conductive surface facing down. The autoclave was sealed and placed in an oven at 150 °C for 4 h with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, the TiO2 NRs/FTO was rinsed several times with deionized water and dried in air.37 The SEM image of TiO2 NRs/FTO is shown in Fig. S2A.†
TiO2 NTs/Ti. 
Firstly, TiO2 NTs were prepared by a two-step electrochemical anodic oxidation method according to the literature. After that, they were annealed in air atmosphere for 3 h with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1. The detailed preparation procedure is shown is ESI.†38
CdSe NPs/FTO. 
The applied potential of electrodeposition was −1.1 V vs. SCE and the deposition time was 2 h. Then the CdSe NPs/FTO were rinsed thoroughly and annealed at 300 °C in N2 atmosphere for 3 h in a tube furnace (SOM, SGL-1200Z). The detailed preparation procedure is shown is ESI.†39
CdS NPs/FTO. 
The applied potential of electrodeposition was −0.65 V vs. SCE and the deposition time was 1000 s. The thermostatic bath temperature was 70 °C. Then the CdS NPs/FTO were rinsed and annealed at 500 °C in N2 atmosphere for 6 h. The detailed preparation procedure is shown is ESI.†40


Photocathode. 
C/Cu NWAs/Cu mesh. 
A Cu mesh (Alfa Aesar, 100 mesh, 0.11 mm as wire diameter) was anodized in an NaOH (Aladdin, AR, 96.0%) solution (3 mol L−1) for 20 min under 10 mA cm−2 to form Cu(OH)2 NWAs/Cu mesh at 25 °C. The Cu(OH)2 NWAs/Cu mesh was immersed into 3 mg mL−1 glucose solution, which was prepared using deionized water, for glucose coating. Then the Cu(OH)2 NWAs/Cu mesh with glucose coating was annealed at 550 °C in N2 atmosphere for 4 h with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1.41 The SEM images of Cu NWAs/Cu mesh with or without carbon layer are shown in Fig. S2B and C.†
Cu2O NPs/FTO. 
The electrochemical deposition was performed potentiostatically with a potential of −0.3 V (versus Ag/AgCl) for 30 min and the temperature of the electrolyte was kept at 60 °C using a water bath. The detailed preparation procedure is shown is ESI.†42

Characterization methods
The morphology of the sample photoelectrodes was identified by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Detailed microstructural features of the sample electrodes were investigated by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM2100, JEOL, Japan), using a JEM-2000EX electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The crystalline structures of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer, Bruker, Germany), using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540598 Å). UV-visible diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded by AvalightDHS UV-vis absorbance measurements (Avantes, Netherlands).
Photoelectrochemical measurement
The photoelectrochemical characterizations of the photoelectrodes were carried out by using a three-electrode configuration with the samples, platinum foil and Ag/AgCl2 as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode parameters were controlled by an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, USA). The PFC was set up using two-electrode configurations. The photoanode and photocathode were immersed in the solution in a quartz reactor and illuminated with one light source. Herein, a 300 W PSL-SXF300 Xe lamp (Changtuo, China) was used as simulated solar light source. Without further description, all experiments were carried out under AM 1.5 (light intensity, 100 mW cm−2) solar light irradiation by using an AM 1.5 filter supplied by PerfectLight (Beijing, China). All the experiments were carried out in a rectangular quartz reactor (V = 435 mL) with the working area of the photoanode and photocathode both of 2 cm2, moderate stirring, without applying external potential (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). Linear sweep voltammetry was used to obtain the I–V characteristics curve for one typical cycle at a scan rate of 0.02 V s−1.20 The I–V characteristic curves of the PFCs were measured in a two-electrode system, where the anode served as the working electrode and the cathode as the counter and reference electrodes. The voltage and power were obtained as a function of current density, and normalized to the photocathode area. The power density (P) was calculated from P = I × V.
Organic compound degradation was carried out in a quartz reactor under AM 1.5 (light intensity of 100 mW cm−2) solar light irradiation, too. The target organic compound was phenol (20 mg L−1) and 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. The TOC removal rate of phenol was monitored by a multi N/C 3100 TOC/TNb analyzer (Analytikjena, Germany).
The total hydrogen amount produced was calculated by multiplying the hydrogen content in a 1 mL gas sample by the headspace volume of the PFC reactor (200 mL).43 The hydrogen was measured by gas chromatography (GC 7900, Techcomp, Shanghai, China).
Results and discussion
PEC performance, TOC removal and hydrogen production of PFC

Fig. 1A presents the photocurrent of TiO2 NRs/FTO, C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu, and TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC. SEM images and UV-vis absorption spectra of them are shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† There is almost no photoresponse for the TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode. This may be because TiO2 is a broadband semiconductor and it only has a response to ultraviolet (UV) light. However, the light source we used is a solar light source in which the UV light constitutes only about 5%. So under the solar light illumination, there is almost no photoresponse for the TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode. Because Cu2O is a narrowband semiconductor which has a response to visible light and there is a large proportion of visible light in solar light, the C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu photocathode has a strong photoresponse to the simulated solar light whose photocurrent reaches as much as 0.4 mA cm−2. The short circuit current (JSC) of the PFC composed of TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu photocathode reaches 0.50 mA cm−2 which is more than two times higher than the reported JSC of TiO2/Ti-Cu2O/Cu system (0.23 mA cm−2).21 This value is higher than the sum of the photocurrents of the photoanode and photocathode. This means that the PFC system has a synergistic facilitating effect on the photoresponse of the photoanode and photocathode.
 Fig. 1  (A) The photocurrent of TiO2 NRs/FTO, C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu and PFC system, where the substrate is 0.05 mol L−1 phenol and support electrolyte is 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 under AM 1.5 illumination (light density of 100 mW cm−2), and the areas of both photoelectrodes are 2 cm2. (B) The TOC removal rates of phenol (20 mg L−1) for TiO2 NRs/Pt and TiO2 NRs, C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC under light illumination and in the dark. 

Fig. 1B shows the performance of phenol degradation by photocatalysis with TiO2 photoelectrode and TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC with or without light illumination. As we can see from the TOC removal rate of phenol, the degradation efficiency of the PFC system is improved significantly with a high TOC removal rate compared with that photocatalyzed by TiO2 photoanode and Pt system. There is no TOC removal of phenol when no light is incident on the TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu photocathode. Because TiO2 is a UV-light-response semiconductor, there is a weak response to the simulated solar light. So the degradation rate of phenol is very poor, only 6.4%. However, the PFC has a strong response to solar light due to the presence of the C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu photocathode and the synergistic effect of the two photoelectrodes. So its degradation rate of phenol reaches as much as 84.2%. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the PFC can be calculated by the equation: (1)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Jlight is the incident irradiance (mW cm−2) and λ is the incident light wavelength. The IPCE curve is shown in Fig. S5.†
At the same time, the photocurrent and degradation rate of phenol for different PFCs have been studied. Herein, eight kinds of PFCs mentioned above were chosen to study the photocurrent. Table 1 shows that JSC of TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC reaches as much as 0.50 mA cm−2. JSC (TiO2 NRs/FTO PFC) is higher than JSC (TiO2 NTs/Ti PFC) with the same photocathode. This is because the photoresponse of photoanodes determines the relationship of the two JSC values when the photocathode is fixed. This could be attributed to the single crystal structure of the TiO2 NRs/FTO (see Fig. S2 A3†). The performance of the TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC is the best of all. For the PFC with the same photoanode, JSC of C/Cu2O/Cu is larger than that of Cu2O/FTO. The reason speculated is not only the photoresponse of the photocatalyst to solar light but also the conductivity of the substrates.

These TOC removal rates for phenol by the 8 PFCs have been studied. Here the concentration of the phenol is 20 mg L−1, and the support electrolyte is 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4. In Fig. 2, the TOC removal rate of phenol on TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC is the highest, which reaches 84.2%. The result is consistent with that of JSC comparison. However, there is an exception. With the same photocathode, the TOC removal rate of phenol of the PFC with CdS/FTO photoanode is lower than that of TiO2 NRs/FTO and TiO2 NTs/Ti, but JSC of CdS/FTO photoanode PFC is higher. This is because JSC of the PFC will continuously decay with light illumination (see Fig. S4†) and JSC in Table 1 is only measured at the initial 10 minutes. JSC of CdS/FTO PFC decays more rapidly due to the serious photocorrosion of CdS. The opposite trend is observed for JSC of CdS/FTO photoanode which is higher than that of TiO2 NTs/Ti. JSC of CdS/FTO photoanode decays obviously with increasing time. After 6 hours, JSC is only a tenth of the initial photocurrent density. So we can see that there is little effect in the last 2 hours on phenol degradation. In these 8 PFCs, the CdSe/FTO-Cu2O/FTO PFC has the lowest TOC removal rate of phenol of 42%.19,20
 Fig. 2  The TOC removal rate of phenol (20 mg L−1) of 8 PFCs using two-electrode configuration under AM 1.5 illumination, with 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 as support electrolyte. Here, C1 to C8 are the numbers of the PFCs as in Table 1. 
In the hydrogen production experiments, the closed reactor was purged with N2 to ensure air-proof conditions, and the gas composition was monitored in the whole cycles. The standard H2 peak of the GC spectra appears when the retention time is 1.2 min (Fig. S6†) and the hydrogen-producing rates in 8 h of the 8 PFCs are shown in Fig. 3. The average hydrogen-producing rate of the TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC reaches about 11 μmol h−1 cm−2 (normalized to the cathode area) and for 8 h the total rate is 86.8 μmol cm−2 which is the best of all. This result is higher than the hydrogen production by BPEC.43 For comparison, the hydrogen-producing rate of Pt-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu reaches only 1.4 μmol h−1 cm−2 and the total is 10.6 μmol cm−2. The result of hydrogen-producing rate of different PFCs is consistent with that of JSC, too. As with the TOC removal rates, for the CdS/FTO photoanode PFC, the hydrogen-producing rate decreases much in the last 4 h due to the serious photocorrosion of CdS. So its hydrogen-producing rate is not the highest. However, when the semiconductor anode is replaced by Pt, the hydrogen-producing rate is greatly decreased. These results also prove that there is a synergistic facilitating effect between the two photoelectrodes of the PFC which is confirmed by the results of TOC removal rates of phenol. In Fig. 4, when the current density is 0.32 mA cm−2 the power density reaches a maximum (Pmax) of 0.073 mW cm−2. Table 2 lists the current–voltage characteristics of the 8 PFC systems using phenol (0.05 mol L−1) as substrate and Na2SO4 (0.1 mol L−1) as electrolyte. The fill factor (FF) which is an important indicator of output characteristics of a PFC can be calculated based on these parameters by the following equation: (2)where Pmax and JSCVOC represent the real maximum power density and theoretical maximum power density yielded from the PFC system, respectively. JSC and VOC are short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage of the PFC system.

Table 2 also summarizes the cell parameter such as VOC, JSC, Pmax and FF, TOC removal rates and hydrogen-producing rates of all PFCs. The results also prove the hydrogen-producing rate and TOC removal rate of phenol increases with JSC of PFCs. Here we can see the TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC is the best one with its JSC of 0.50 mA cm−2, TOC removal rate of 84.2%, and hydrogen-producing rate of 86.84 μmol cm−2 which are much higher than those of other parallel studies.20,21
Operation mechanism of dual photoelectrode PFC
The dual photoelectrode PFC is composed of a configuration of two photocatalytic semiconductor electrodes including n-type semiconductor photoanode and p-type photocathode. Under light illumination, both of the photoelectrodes can generate electron–hole pairs. The driving force of the PFC is the Fermi level difference between the two photoelectrodes. The Fermi level of the photoanode should be more negative than that of the photocathode, so that a bias will be produced. Then the electrons on the photoanode will transfer through the external circuit to combine with the holes on the photocathode.20 Holes will be accumulated at the photoanode and electrons at the photocathode. So it is a Z-scheme, and there is a cooperative synergistic facilitating effect.44–46 This is why there is a great enhancement of TOC removal rate of phenol and hydrogen-producing rate of the PFC compared to the single photoanode (or photocathode) and Pt system. So the PFC can be used for simultaneous pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.
For example, TiO2 NRs/FTO and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh are chosen as the photoanode and photocathode, respectively. The Fermi level of the TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode is more negative than that of the C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode, so in this case a self-driven PFC can be operated under solar light illumination. The remaining holes on TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode and electrons on C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode can be used for simultaneous organic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.

Fig. 5 shows the working mode of the PFC. In this PFC, two half-reactions are involved: the organics oxidized by solar light illumination at the anode and water reduction to hydrogen at the cathode. The overall reaction process can be described as in eqn (3)–(7): TiO2 + hν → hvb1+ + ecb1−(3) C6H5OH + 5H2O + 16hvb1+ → 6CO2 + 16H+(4) Cu2O + hν → hvb2+ + ecb2−(5) ecb1− + hvb2+ → hν′(6) 2H+ + 2ecb2− → H2(7)
 Fig. 5  The working mode diagram of the PFC system. 
The photovoltages of TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode, C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode and the PFC combining them are measured to confirm this operation mechanism. As shown in Table 3, the photovoltages of TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode were measured with and without AM 1.5 illumination in an electrolyte of 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4. The TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode have a quick photoresponse and the voltage value changes from −0.08 V to −0.33 V and from 0.02 V to 0.18 V instantaneously when the light source is turned on. So the photovoltages of TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode were 0.25 V and 0.16 V, respectively. Then the theoretical photovoltage of the PFC could be calculated to be 0.41 V which is the sum of the photovoltage values of the TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu mesh photocathode. The experimental photovoltage (VOC) of the PFC system is about 0.41 V which matches that obtained by theoretical calculation. This result indicates that the photovoltage of the PFC authentically originated from the difference between the Fermi levels of the two photoelectrodes. Such a PFC system can work under solar light illumination without other forms of additional energy as a result of the mismatch of the Fermi levels of the photoelectrodes.

In order to further study the influence of Fermi level of the semiconductor photoelectrodes in the PFC, several other semiconductors, n-CdS NPS/FTO, n-CdSe NPs/FTO and n-TiO2 NTs/Ti, have been chosen as photoanode. As we know, the Fermi level of an n-type semiconductor is close to the conduction band and that of a p-type semiconductor is close to the valence band. So the position of the Fermi level can be determined through the position of the conduction band (Ecb) and valence band (Evb). Here, ΔV which is the difference between Ecb of n-type semiconductor and Evb of p-type semiconductor stands for the difference of Fermi level between two photoelectrodes. Table 4 shows the energy band parameters of several semiconductors. Theoretically, the greater the difference between Ecb of photoanode and Evb of photocathode, the greater the VOC of the PFC will be. Table 4 lists the difference between Ecb of photoanode and Evb of photocathode of the PFCs. Therefore VOC of CdS NPS/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC, TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC and CdSe NPS/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu PFC would be in the descending order: VOC (CdS NPS/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu) > VOC (TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu) > VOC (CdSe NPS/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu).

Here we can see that when the photoanode of the PFC is CdSe/FTO, VOC of the PFC is lower than the sum of photovoltages of photoanode and photocathode while for other PFCs it is equal to the sum. The main reason speculated is that the difference of Fermi level between CdSe and Cu2O is the smallest of all, so that the small difference of Fermi level would not maximize VOC of the PFC.
As shown in Table 3, VOC of CdS NPS/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu has a maximum value of 0.50 V among the three PFCs. And the VOC values of TiO2 NRs/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu and CdS NPS/FTO-C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu are 0.41 V and 0.20 V, respectively. They also range in the same descending sequence as theoretical speculation. Therefore, it is reasonable that VOC of the PFC is determined by the difference of Fermi level between the two photoelectrodes. What is more, the VOC value of PFC increases with the difference of Fermi level between the two photoelectrodes.
As we know, the VOC values of the PFC are also influenced by many other factors. These factors can be divided into two categories: (1) environmental factors such as temperature, pH value and electrolyte and (2) material factors such as crystal facet and microstructure. While the environmental factors have been studied commonly by many researchers, the study of material factors is fully discussed here. Therefore, Cu2O NPs/FTO and TiO2 NTs/Ti were chosen as the reference photoelectrodes. Table 3 also shows that the VOC value of the PFCs with Cu2O NPs/FTO photocathode is higher than that of PFCs with C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu photocathode when their photoanodes are the same. Herein, the key factor that influences VOC of PFCs is the crystal facet structure of Cu2O.
In Fig. 6A, the XRD pattern of Cu2O/FTO shows the dominant crystal facet of Cu2O is (220) which is the high index crystal facet while the dominant crystal facet of C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu is (111). The (111) facet has the best photocatalytic ability. This is because the high index crystal facet (220) has a higher surface energy than the low index crystal facet (111). In a similar way, for the TiO2 photoanodes with different structure, when the PFCs are composed of the same photocathode, VOC of the PFC with TiO2 NRs/FTO is higher than that with TiO2 NTs/Ti as photoanode. In Fig. 6B, the dominant crystal facet of TiO2 NTs/Ti is (101) while that of TiO2 NRs/FTO is high index crystal facets (002) and (112). Therefore, VOC of TiO2 NRs/FTO photoanode PFC is higher than that of TiO2 NTs/Ti photoanode PFC. Here we can see that in addition to the difference of Fermi level, the microstructure such as crystal facet structure of the photoelectrodes also influences VOC of PFCs. VOC of PFCs increases with the ratio of high index crystal facet of the photoelectrodes.

Conclusions
In this work, a dual PFC has been fabricated, which can work without an external energy input except for light illumination. Several n-type and p-type semiconductors have been chosen as the photoanode and photocathode, respectively. The PFC has a superior VOC of 0.41 V and a JSC of 0.50 mA cm−2 with TiO2 NRs/FTO as photoanode and C/Cu2O NWAs/Cu as photocathode. The best TOC removal rate of phenol and hydrogen production rate in 8 hours reaches 84.2% and 86.8 μmol cm−2, which is much higher than reported by other similar studies. For the investigation of mechanism, the VOC value of PFC is mainly influenced by the difference of Fermi level between the two photoelectrodes. For the same semiconductors with different microstructure, the crystal facet properties also influence VOC of the PFC. And the VOC value of the PFC increases with the ratio of high index crystal facet of photoelectrodes. However, JSC of the PFC is not only influenced by the difference of Fermi level between the two photoelectrodes but also by the photoresponse of the photocatalyst and electrical conductivity of the substrate of the photocathode. The higher the photocurrent and the better the electrical conductivity, the higher the JSC achieved for the PFC. The trends of degradation for phenol and hydrogen production are the same as those of JSC. So this work provides a novel and clear theoretical guidance for photoelectrode selection and exploits a new application of PFCs for hydrogen production.
