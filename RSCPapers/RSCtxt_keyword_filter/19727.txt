    , Accepted 21st June 2016First published on 22nd June 2016AbstractA low-cost, light-weight and flexible power supply is highly desirable for portable electronic devices. All-plastic solar cells in which all the layers are fabricated sequentially from organic synthetic inks could meet these requirements. Here, we report that fully solution-processed all-plastic multijunction solar cells can be easily fabricated layer by layer without the need for sophisticated patterning. The key for the high-yield fully solution-processed multijunction cells is the control and tuning of the conductivity of the charge-recombination layer of PEDOT:PSS/PEI. The all-plastic multijunction solar cells achieve a PCE of 6.1 ± 0.4% and a high open-circuit voltage of 5.37 V. These all-plastic multijunction solar cells are successfully used to drive liquid-crystal displays, full-color light-emitting diodes and for water splitting under different light illumination conditions.

Conceptual insights
We demonstrate the first all-plastic multijunction solar cells in which all the layers are solution processed sequentially from organic synthetic inks, including the electrodes, charge-collecting layers, the active layers, and the charge-recombination layers connecting the multiple junctions. Additionally, to our knowledge, this is the first report on organic tandem solar cells that can simultaneously have the advantages of vacuum-free, metal-free, highly flexible and high output voltage. The realization of the all-plastic multijunction solar cells is based on the fine tuning of the conductivity of the charge-recombination layer (CRL) via modifying the PEDOT:PSS formulation and selecting the processing solvent of the polyethylenimine to avoid the patterning and shorts. These cells with high photovoltage have been shown to meet the requirements to power liquid-crystal displays and full-color light-emitting diodes under low-intensity light conditions. They could become very low-cost solutions for powering various portable and wearable electronic devices, including wireless sensors for the internet of things applications.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been attracting great attention due to their promising properties of low cost, excellent mechanical flexibility, light weight, tunable transparency and large-area roll-to-roll manufacturing compatibility.1–12 The combination of these merits renders OSCs suitable as low-cost power sources for portable electronic devices, like displays and other wearable electronic devices. Progress in the development of novel high-efficiency materials, optimization of processing conditions and the study of the device physics have enabled a steady increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs over the past few years.13–21 Recently, laboratory-scale bulk-heterojunction solar cells with PCE larger than 10% have been reported.22–28 Today, the majority of OSCs reported are fabricated on rigid glass substrates with indium-tin oxide (ITO) as the bottom electrodes and vacuum-deposited metal as the top electrodes.14,22,23,27,29 However, the ITO bottom electrode is costly and brittle, and the use of a vacuum-evaporated top metal electrode (typically Ag or Al) is expensive and highly energy-consuming.30 To fully realize the potential of OSCs, geometries without ITO electrodes and expensive-metal electrodes should be implemented. All-solution-processed all-plastic solar cells, in which all layers are plastic, including the substrate, electrodes and active layers, are expected to be critical for reducing the cost-of-electricity of OSC devices.1
To evaluate the real potential of the all-plastic approach, cells with sufficiently high photovoltage and power are required. In order to achieve these characteristics, a generally employed strategy is to connect in series single-junction cells to form modules typically having a stripe geometry.3,31,32 In such modules, uniform light illumination on each sub-cell is required to maximize the efficiency of the solar module since the current of the module is limited by the cell with smallest current. Furthermore, the spatial separation between each sub-cell in the modules could result in performance loss because the area of separation called the “dead zone” does not contribute to the current.31,33 Another important strategy to increase photovoltage is to build a tandem structure in which two or more active layers are vertically stacked on top of another with a charge recombination layer (CRL) or an interconnecting layer in between. A cell in the tandem structure is possible to produce output photovoltage of several volts by increasing the junction numbers. The tandem strategy is particularly attractive to construct highly flexible all-solution-processed all-plastic solar cells to power portable or wearable electronics.
Previously, we demonstrated the realization of all-solution-processed all-plastic single-junction solar cells using layers of the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the top and bottom electrodes and polyethylenimine (PEI) as a modification layer.1 Single-junction all-plastic solar cells yielded a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 3.0% and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) value of about 0.8 V that is insufficient to power portable devices. In addition, we and other groups have also shown that a PEDOT:PSS/PEI bilayer acts as an efficient charge recombination layer (CRL) for efficient tandem OSCs, because of its high transparency, robust mechanical properties and large work function contrast displayed between the top and bottom surfaces.34–37
Despite these advances, the realization of all-solution-processed all-plastic tandem solar cells is still challenging. This is because the PEDOT:PSS/PEI CRL used in those tandem cells requires to be patterned (due to its high conductivity) in order to avoid shorts or large leakage between the CRL and the electrodes.34,35 The patterning of the CRL is not an ideal solution since the patterned CRL layer protects only partially the bottom active layer underneath during the fabrication of the top active layer, leading to a reduced device yield. Similar challenges have also been reported in recent papers.26,36,38–42 For instance, Gupta et al.41 reported that their tandem solar cells exhibited electrical shorts between two PEDOT:PSS layers because of their lateral conductivity. To solve this problem, they proposed the use of thermally deposited low-conductivity MoO3 replacing high conductivity PEDOT:PSS in the CRL. Kim et al.38 reported the requirement of patterning of the PEDOT:PSS/TiOx CRL in their tandem cells. Yusoff et al.26,39 reported the patterning of ZnO/PEDOT:PSS and pH-neutral PEDOT:PSS/LZO/C60-SAM in their tandem cells. Guo et al.42 also reported the precise patterning of the electrodes in their tandem cells to avoid shorts when they used conductive ZnO/N-PEDOT/AgNWs as the CRL. It should be noted that although patterning is not required for those CRLs with high lateral resistance, for example, MoOx/Ag (<10 nm)/PEIE, where Ag does not form a continuous layer,43 the conductivity of the CRL must be sufficiently high to minimize power losses and ensure good tandem cell performance. These results highlight the need for developing a route to control the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS in order to avoid patterning while at the same time enabling scalable all-solution processed CRLs.
Here, we report on the highly flexible all-solution-processed all-plastic multijunction solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency and high photovoltage via fine-tuning of the CRL conductivity. The tuned conductivity of the CRL allows the easy fabrication of the all-plastic multijunction cells from the solutions via layer-by-layer coating without sophisticated patterning. To illustrate the all-plastic multijunction cells, following this approach, produce useful amounts of power, we demonstrate its application as power sources for light-emitting diodes (LEDs), liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), and water splitting under different illumination conditions.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Conductivity tuning of the charge-recombination layer (CRL)

Fig. 1a shows the device architecture of the multijunction all-plastic solar cells. Flexible polymer polyethersulfone (PES) is used as the substrate. Highly conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS (PH1000), hereinafter referred to as PH1000, films are used as both the bottom and the top electrodes. The top finger-shaped PH1000 electrodes are prepared by film-transfer lamination. Bottom PH1000 electrodes are modified by PEI to reduce the work function and turn the electrode into an efficient electron-collecting electrode.1 The chemical structures of PEDOT:PSS and PEI are shown in Fig. 1b. A bilayer of PEDOT:PSS/PEI is used as the CRL.
 Fig. 1  (a) Device structure of the multijunction all-plastic solar cells. (b) The chemical structure of PEDOT:PSS and PEI used to construct the charge-recombination layer (CRL). (c) The conductivity tuning of the CRL by mixing the two different PEDOT:PSS formulations (AI 4083 and PH1000) with different ratios and using different processing solvents for PEI (MEA: 2-methoxyethanol, IPA: 2-propanol). 
To enable the fabrication of multijunction tandem OSC devices, the conductivity of the CRL is finely tailored to avoid patterning and shorts. By comparing the shunt resistance and lateral resistance of the solar cells, we found that the lateral electrical leakage in the cells is negligible when the conductivity of the CRL is less than 0.1 S cm−1 (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Typically, PH1000 films, processed without additives, yield an average conductivity of about 1 S cm−1. However, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is very sensitive to post-treatment conditions such as the use of polar solvents, acid solutions, or reduction agents when processing subsequent layers.44–47 In the present case, it was found that the solvent used to process PEI and/or PEI itself can effectively change the conductivity of PH1000 films. For example, the solvent of 2-methoxyethanol (MEA) that is generally used to process PEI is found to enhance the conductivity of the PH1000 film from about 1 to 500 S cm−1 as shown in Fig. 1c.
To tune the conductivity of the CRL to a target value, we investigated two aspects: (1) changing the PEDOT:PSS formulation and (2) changing the PEI processing solvent. To tune the conductivity in a broad range of values, we first mixed two commercially available formulations of PEDOT:PSS PH1000 and PEDOT:PSS AI 4083. The surface of the films fabricated from blends of AI 4083 and PH1000 is smooth as measured by atomic force microscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†), which is also critical for the CRL since it is placed between the thin active layers (about 100 nm). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the three PEDOT:PSS films are 1.2 nm for AI 4083, 1.6 nm for PH1000 and 2.8 nm for PH1000:AI 4083 (1:3) blend, respectively. Mixing of the two PEDOT:PSS formulations does not yield precipitation. Fig. 1c shows that the conductivity of the mixture increases with increasing concentration of PH1000. Note that the increase in conductivity is not linear with respect to the concentration of PH1000 (Fig. S4, ESI†). Films of pure AI 4083 yield an average electrical conductivity of 3 × 10−4 S cm−1, while those with neat PH1000 yield values of 0.67 S cm−1.

Fig. 1c also includes the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films (PH1000:AI 4083 mixture) after PEI treatment processed from different solvents (2-propanol, IPA and 2-methoxyethanol, MEA). Before PEI coating, the conductivity of the films fabricated from mixture varies between 3 × 10−4 and 0.67 S cm−1. The PEI solution with different solvents significantly changes the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film. The spin coating of PEI in the MEA solvent enhances the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films by over two orders of magnitude. When IPA is used as the processing solvent instead, the coating of PEI solution only slightly changes the conductivity. The conductivity enhancement observed with MEA is probably associated with the high polarity of the solvent (high polarity index of 5.5 for MEA, while 3.9 for IPA) that leads to re-organization of the PEDOT aggregate domains.48 Therefore, combining the approaches of tuning the PEDOT:PSS formulation and changing the processing solvent of PEI allows the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS CRL to be tuned between 3 × 10−4 and 500 S cm−1.
2.2 Two-junction solar cells with different conductivities of the CRL
We tested PEDOT:PSS/PEI CRL layers with different conductivities to illustrate the critical role that it plays on the performance of tandem solar cells. The device structure is shown in Fig. 2a. Three kinds of CRL with different conductivities were used in the tandem cells (having an ITO-bottom electrode): PH1000/PEI (MEA, σ = 500 S cm−1), AI 4083/PEI (IPA, σ = 3 × 10−4 S cm−1) and PH1000:AI 4083 (1:3) by weight, hereafter referred to as PEDOT:PSS-m13/PEI (IPA, σ = 3 × 10−2 S cm−1). In contrast with the previous work,5,34 the CRL here is not patterned and fully covers the bottom active layer. High conductivity PH1000 with ethylene glycol (EG) was used as the top electrode via transfer lamination (denoted as PEDOT-T).49 The thickness of the PEDOT-T is about 150 nm and the conductivity is about 686 S cm−1. Fig. S5 (ESI†) includes the transmittance of the PEDOT-T film. The transmittance is 75–85% in the spectral range of 300–800 nm and almost unchanged before and after the lamination.
 Fig. 2  (a) The 2-junction structure of the solar cells with PEDOT:PSS/PEI as the charge-recombination layer (CRL) having different conductivity values. Note that the CRL cover the whole area of the bottom active layers. (b–d) The I–V curves of the tandem solar cells with unpatterned CRLs having different conductivities displayed in the inset of each figure. 

Fig. 2b–d show the I–V characteristics of tandem cells with the three different CRLs. When PH1000/PEI(MEA) is used as the CRL (σ = 500 S cm−1), the resulting tandem cell displays very high leakage as can be seen from the I–V curve in the dark. Under illumination, these tandem solar cells display a VOC value of 1.08 V, which is lower than the sum of the two P3HT:ICBA sub-cells, about 1.6 V. The ISC (rather than JSC) is high because a very conductive CRL increases the effective area of the device. When AI 4083/PEI(IPA) is used as the CRL (σ = 3 × 10−4 S cm−1), the cell exhibits a very large rectification ratio in the I–V curve in the dark. However, the cell shows an s-shaped I–V characteristic under illumination, which might be associated with the conductivity of the CRL being too low or with the chemical composition of AI 4083 (1:6, PEDOT:PSS ratio by weight). In contrast, when the mixture of PEDOT:PSS-m13/PEI(IPA) (σ = 3 × 10−2 S cm−1) was used as the CRL, the tandem cells displayed a VOC = 1.61 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.62; note that the VOC is close to the sum of the two P3HT:ICBA sub-cells. Furthermore, Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the distribution of photovoltaic parameters of 20 fabricated cells with the PEDOT:PSS-m13/PEI(IPA) as the CRL. It can be seen that 19 out of 20 two-junction cells display the VOC values in the range of 1.6 ± 0.1 V that is close to the sum of the two sub-cells, and 18 out of the 20 devices display the PCE values in the range of 3.6 ± 0.3% (Fig. S6a–d, ESI†). For comparison, 20 two-junction tandem cells were also fabricated using previously published CRLs comprising of patterned PH1000/PEI.5 As shown in Fig. S6e–h (ESI†), only 8 out of 20 devices display the VOC in the range of 1.6 ± 0.1 V and 4 out of 20 display the PCE in the range of 3.6 ± 0.3%. These results indicate that PEDOT:PSS-m13/PEI(IPA) acts as an efficient CRL without the need of patterning, simplifying the fabrication of the tandem solar cells and significantly enhancing the device yield.
2.3 All-plastic multijunction solar cells
The realization of the PEDOT:PSS-m13/PEI(IPA) CRL enables the all-additive fabrication of all-solution-processed all-plastic tandem solar cells because unpatterned CRL layers are effective in protecting the bottom active layer. First, 2-junction all-solution-processed all-plastic tandem solar cells were fabricated with P3HT:ICBA as both the bottom and the top active layers (device structure as shown in Fig. 1a). The all-plastic cells yield VOC = 1.61 V, JSC = 3.0 mA cm−2, FF = 0.64 and PCE = 3.5% (Fig. 3a and b). Note that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on all-plastic tandem solar cells. The high VOC and FF values achieved in these cells illustrate the effectiveness of the optimized CRL layer in the fabrication of high-quality all-solution-processed all-plastic tandem solar cells.

(b) Photovoltaic parameters as a function of the number of junction.

(e) Normalized VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of a 6-junction all-plastic solar cell as a function of bending cycles with a radius of 4 mm. 
To further enhance the PCE of the tandem all-plastic solar cells, we employed spectrally complementary P3HT:ICBA and PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the bottom and top active layers, respectively (Fig. 3c). The tandem solar cells yield average values (over 5 devices) of VOC = 1.55 ± 0.01 V, JSC = 7.0 ± 1.0 mA cm−2, FF = 0.59 ± 0.02 and PCE = 6.1 ± 0.4% under 1 sun illumination. As the reference, we also fabricated tandem cells with the same active layers and CRL but with ITO/glass and MoO3/Ag electrodes (Fig. S7, ESI†). The tandem solar cells exhibit average values (over 5 devices) of VOC = 1.53 ± 0.02 V, JSC = 9.0 ± 1.0 mA cm−2, FF = 0.69 ± 0.01 and PCE = 9.0 ± 0.5%. Compared with the reference cells, the lower PCE of the all-plastic cells arises from lower JSC and FF. The lower FF value is attributed to a higher series resistance in the all-plastic solar cells, due to the lower conductivity of the polymer electrodes compared to the conductivity of ITO and the top-metal electrode. The lower JSC and EQE (Fig. 3d and Fig. S7c, ESI†) values are attributed primarily to the absence of a reflective top-electrode in the all-plastic solar cells. The EQE spectra of the tandem cells are measured by designing a three-terminal device (Fig. S8, ESI†) where a bilayer PEDOT:PSS [20 nm PH1000 (EG)/20 nm PEDOT:PSS-m13] was introduced to replace the initial CRL (40 nm PEDOT:PSS-m13) as the third electrode to access the top and the bottom cells independently as previously reported.50,51 More details are shown in the ESI.† The absence of the reflective electrode makes light propagation within the all-plastic two-junction cell different from that within the reference cell. We note that we did not systematically optimize the thickness of P3HT:ICBA and PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers in the all-plastic cells but used the thickness values of optimized single-junction cell devices reported in the literature.14,28 That is, the thickness of the front P3HT:ICBA sub-cell is about 200 nm and the back PTB7-Th:PC71BM is about 110 nm. Further optimization of the active-layer thickness values might be able to further enhance the solar cell performance. Even so, the PCE demonstrated here of 6.1 ± 0.4% is still among the highest reported for all solution-processed solar cells found in the literature (Table S1, ESI†).
The ease of processing of the CRLs allows the fabrication of all-solution-processed all-plastic multijunction solar cells with high photovoltage. To demonstrate this, we fabricated multijunction all-plastic solar cells with up to 7 junctions. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we used exclusively P3HT:ICBA as the active material. Fig. 3a shows the J–V characteristics of 1- to 7-junction all-plastic solar cells under 1 sun illumination. The photovoltaic parameters of the cells are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†) and plotted in Fig. 3b as a function of the number of junctions. As expected, the VOC of the multijunction devices increases almost linearly with the number of junctions. The inset of Fig. 3a shows a bended 7-junction cell displaying a VOC of 5.37 V under 1 sun illumination. The JSC decreases (Fig. 3b) as the junction number increases because the total light absorbed is divided among an increasing number of sub-cells since all the active layers (P3HT:ICBA) absorb photons in the same spectral region, and the current of the whole tandem cell is limited by the sub-cell generating the smallest current. For the FF, a maximum FF of 0.67 is obtained for the 4-junction cells, which is higher than the single-junction of 0.53. The higher FF of 2-, 3- and 4-junction solar cells than that of the single-junction devices is mainly due to the higher VOC that has been illustrated in our previous study.34 A significant decrease in FF is observed in the 5- and 6-junction cells. That is associated with the poor current balancing and increased series resistance as the number of junction further increases. As a result, the PCE increases gradually as the number of junction increases, reaching a maximum value of 5.1% for a 4-junction cell because of the high VOC, FF and moderate JSC. But increasing the number of cells further leads to decreasing PCE values. Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows the VOC distribution of ten 7-junction tandem solar cells (22 all-solution-processed layers in each device) where all devices display VOC values in the range of 5.1–5.4 V, confirming the high device yield obtained with the use of PEDOT:PSS-m13/PEI(IPA) CRL.
Because the solar cells are all-plastic in nature, good mechanical flexibility is expected with exclusively organic–organic interfaces. In order to verify the mechanical flexibility of the all-plastic multijunction solar cells, bending test was performed on a 6-junction all-polymer solar cell. The VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of the cell was measured after bending as shown in Fig. 3e. After 5000 consecutive bending cycles with a radius of 4 mm, the device was still stable with an efficiency of 96% of the initial value. This indicates that these cells have good mechanical stability after multiple bending cycles.
2.4 Applications of the all-plastic multijunction solar cells
As mentioned, all-plastic solar cells have the advantage of light weight, excellent flexibility and easy processing. The high VOC values of 4.7 V for a 6-junction cell and 5.37 V for a 7-junction cell offer the potential of powering mobile electronic devices. In this context, it is also important to test how the all-plastic multijunction cells work under low light-intensity illumination for powering portable electronics because people's activities nowadays mainly take place indoors under low light intensity. Fig. 4a shows J–V characteristics of a 6-junction cell under different light intensities from 1 to 100 mW cm−2. The J–V curves under illumination from a commonly used flashlight and room light are also shown. As can be seen from the J–V curve, the VOC has a value of 3.5 V under room light illumination conditions, and a value of 4.3 V when illuminated with a flash light. That level of photovoltage is sufficient to power some common electronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes and liquid-crystal displays. To demonstrate this, we first selected an LED with a turn-on voltage in the range of 1.5–3 V (Fig. S10, ESI†), by varying the voltage depending on the emission colors. In the supporting video (ESI†), different emission colored (blue, green and red) LEDs and an LCD are shown powered by a 6-junction solar cell under bending. The LCD is driven by the cell under room light illumination. The LEDs are driven by the cell under the flash light to provide sufficient current. In addition, the high photovoltage achieved by a 4-junction solar cell can be used for water splitting. The demonstration of the water splitting is included in the video provided in the ESI.† Device stability is important for practical applications. The PEDOT:PSS layers might be affected by the moisture in air. In this work, we have not systematically studied the device stability in air (under illumination or in the dark, encapsulated or without encapsulation). However, we found the cells kept in the N2-filled glovebox for about seven months in the dark and illuminated for 20 hours did not show efficiency degradation. These indicate the cells can be potentially stable when they are appropriately encapsulated. The operational stability of the all-plastic cells will be comprehensively studied in future work.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the first all-plastic all-solution-processed multijunction solar cells, from plastic substrates to electrodes, and their highly mechanical flexibility. The realization of the all-plastic cells is based on the precise tuning of the conductivity of the charge recombination layer (CRL) from the two aspects of tuning the PEDOT:PSS formulation (blending PH1000 and AI 4083) and changing the processing solvent of PEI. The developed CRL, herein named PEDOT:PSS-m13/PEI(IPA), has a conductivity of 10−2 S cm−1 and allows the easy fabrication of the multijunction solar cells prepared from solutions via layer-by-layer coating without patterning. Multijunction solar cells (up to 7 junctions) with all-solution-processed layers (up to 22 layers) have been fabricated. The all-solution-processed all-plastic flexible multijunction cell displays a VOC of up to 5.37 V under 1 sun illumination. An all-solution-processed all-plastic 6-junction solar cell was shown to produce enough power to turn on electronic devices including LEDs and LCDs and a 4-junction solar cell produced enough power to split water. The all-additive and easy fabrication of these all-plastic multijunction solar cells is expected to provide a very low-cost solution for powering various portable and wearable electronic devices, including wireless sensors for the internet of things applications, an area with enormous commercial potential. The PEI (or PEIE) modification layer is also compatible with the large-area fabrication techniques,6,7,52–54 which indicates the potential of the CRL for large-area tandem solar cells.

Conceptual insights
We demonstrate the first all-plastic multijunction solar cells in which all the layers are solution processed sequentially from organic synthetic inks, including the electrodes, charge-collecting layers, the active layers, and the charge-recombination layers connecting the multiple junctions. Additionally, to our knowledge, this is the first report on organic tandem solar cells that can simultaneously have the advantages of vacuum-free, metal-free, highly flexible and high output voltage. The realization of the all-plastic multijunction solar cells is based on the fine tuning of the conductivity of the charge-recombination layer (CRL) via modifying the PEDOT:PSS formulation and selecting the processing solvent of the polyethylenimine to avoid the patterning and shorts. These cells with high photovoltage have been shown to meet the requirements to power liquid-crystal displays and full-color light-emitting diodes under low-intensity light conditions. They could become very low-cost solutions for powering various portable and wearable electronic devices, including wireless sensors for the internet of things applications.
