    , Accepted 29th August 2018First published on 31st August 2018AbstractDegradation of perovskite halide materials under humid conditions is one of the major hurdles in the commercialization of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells. Herein, we studied the interface between highly hydrophobic fluorographene (FGr) and cubic methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3, MA: CH3–NH3) by employing density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations. We demonstrate that the adsorption of FGr on MAPbI3 results in the formation of a stable interface with appreciable binding energy (∼0.4 eV per Pb atom). Thorough assessment of energy-level alignment indicates that the FGr/MAPbI3 interface has desirable properties with regard to the electron transfer (hole blockage) process. These results underscore the potential of using FGr as an interlayer for electron transport between a perovskite layer and an electron transfer medium (such as TiO2) as well as a moisture blocker for achieving high perovskite stability by perfect waterproofing. The future research study towards the integration of hydrophobic FGr or electronically optimized partially fluorinated graphene-based systems within perovskite halide photovoltaic devices may pave the way for stable and efficient solar cell technologies.
Introduction
Solar cells based on perovskite halide materials are amongst the most promising candidates for the development of efficient photovoltaic technologies.1–5 The remarkable photovoltaic performance of these materials is associated with desirable properties such as high absorption cross-section, ambipolar transport, high charge motilities, intriguing electronic properties and flexible structure.6–9 Moreover, owing to the recent progress in the fabrication techniques, the power conversion efficiency has surpassed 22%.10
Despite tremendous potential, the commercial usage of perovskite halide-based solar cells has been hindered, particularly due to stability-related issues.11–13 For example, I–V measurements of these devices exhibit anomalous hysteresis, possibly due to movement of ions towards the contacts.14 Another serious concern regarding the long-term stability is the degradation of perovskite materials under humid conditions.15 For example, it is well known that the decomposition of MAPbI3 into different products (CH3NH2, HI and PbI2) is caused by the deprotonation of CH3NH3 by H2O.16 This leads to an increase in band gap and a change in surface morphology of MAPbI3, resulting in overall reduction of photovoltaic performance. Various theoretical studies have further elucidated the moisture-related degradation mechanisms in perovskite materials.17–19 Recently, different approaches have been employed to improve the stability: for example, mixing different halides and cations within the perovskite layer.3,20 Nevertheless, the moisture-related degradation of perovskite halide devices still remains a critical problem.
Recently, edged-selectively fluorine functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (EFGnPs-F) have been employed within perovskite solar cells.21 Such cells provided considerably higher stability under humid conditions as compared with the cells composed of pure graphene-based nanoplatelets without compromising the initial power conversion efficiency. The enhanced stability was attributed to the presence of strongly hydrophobic fluoro-carbon bond in EFGnPs-F. Ideally, the issue of stability can be resolved by the insertion of a hydrophobic material within solar cells as an interlayer, i.e., charge carrier-filtering layer between perovskite and charge transport medium, which facilitates charge extraction such as electron/hole transfer (hole/electron blockage) and vice versa.13 Such configuration will improve the stability of the device without adversely affecting the efficiency. Herein, we studied the interface between fully fluorinated graphene (FGr) and MAPbI3 using DFT-based simulations. FGr has similar structure (hexagonal) to graphene, but each carbon atom is covalently bonded to a fluorine atom (Fig. 1).22 FGr is a chemically highly inert (in the absence of very strong reductants), hydrophobic, tensile, and flexible material due to the high content of strong C–F single bonds.23,24 It should be noted that edged fluorinated graphene (EFGr) can easily have defects and grain boundaries, which will allow moisture to get inside the perovskite layer, spoiling the perovskite. In fact, a layer of graphene covering Cu is known to block the rusting of Cu,25 but only partially because graphene can also easily deteriorate through grain boundaries and defects due to oxidation as well as upon mechanical and chemical damage.26,27 Moreover, FGr is not only more hydrophobic than graphene, but also more effective even in the presence of defects/imperfections as defect sites can be more easily fluorinated; as a result, the penetration of moisture will be blocked. Therefore, for practical use of perovskite materials in solar cells, FGr is much safer as a moisture blocker in comparison with currently employed materials, such as EFGr. In addition, FGr shows high thermal and chemical stability with remarkable stiffness; also it is stretchable since it is inherited from graphene. Moreover, due to tunable electronic and transport properties, FGr-based materials are promising candidates for energy harvesting and optoelectronics applications.28–30 We show that FGr makes a stable interface with MAPbI3. Moreover, energy-level alignment at FGr/MAPbI3 interface facilitates the electron transfer process, underscoring the potential of FGr as an interlayer between electron transport medium (e.g., TiO2, PCBM) and perovskite layers.

Results and discussions

Table 1 summarizes the adsorption properties of the FGr/MAPbI3 interface. For PbI termination, the adsorption distance between FGr and MAPbI3 is ∼3.45 Å, whereas it is reduced to 3.25 Å for MAI termination. Moreover, the binding energy of the FGr/MAPbI3 interface for PbI termination is higher (>0.35 eV) than that of MAI. These results suggest that PbI termination is more stable as compared with the MAI termination. Consequently, the results presented subsequently will be based on PbI termination unless stated otherwise.

Fig. 1 highlights the optimized interface geometry for the FGr/MAPbI3 system for energetically optimum PbI termination. For pristine MAPbI3 slab, I atoms at the top PbI surface are present at ∼0.1 Å above the Pb atoms. As a result of the interaction with FGr, iodine atoms within the perovskite interface layer move away from the interface and Pb atoms move towards it, while no significant change is observed for FGr interface atoms. As a consequence, Pb–FGr and I–FGr distances are similar (Fig. 1b and Table 1). This suggests that F− atoms within FGr interact more strongly with Pb2+ atoms as compared with I−. In particular, due to the favourable electrostatic interaction between F− and Pb2+, the Pb–F distance is reduced, while the converse is true for the I–F distance. This also helps explain why MAI termination is energetically unfavorable as compared with PbI. In addition to the Pb–F interaction, the interface is further stabilized due to charge transfer. Bader analysis31 shows that there is charge transfer of 0.24 electrons from the perovskite layer to FGr. It is interesting to compare the adsorption characteristics of FGr/MAPbI3 interface with that of graphene/MAPbI3. For example, charge transfer also takes place at the graphene/MAPbI3 interface; however, the direction of charge transfer is from graphene to perovskite, i.e., opposite to that found for FGr in the current study.32,33 This can be explained by the fact that F atoms are strongly electronegative and FGr has a much lower work function than graphene.34 Furthermore, the PbI2 sublattice is strongly distorted for the interface PbI layer on graphene, thus breaking the centro-symmetry and leading to ‘interface polarization’.32 Moreover, optimum interface geometry for PbI interface layer on FGr preserves the centro-symmetry (i.e., similar Pb–F and Pb–I distances), thus curtailing the possibility of interface polarization.
Finally, we would like to point out that the magnitude of the binding energy found for the FGr/MAPbI3 interface for energetically optimum PbI termination is relatively high (∼0.4 eV per Pb atom) and comparable with that of graphene/MAPbI3 interface.32 This suggests that the FGr/MAPbI3 interface is stable, thus paving the way for actual utilization in the solar cell devices.
In order to study the impact of interfacial interactions on the charge transfer process, it is necessary to thoroughly assess the interface electronic structure. Fig. 2a depicts the density of states (DOS) of FGr/MAPbI3 interface calculated after inclusion of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). The corresponding results from generalized gradient approach (GGA) are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†). The results for MAI termination are also shown in ESI, Fig. S2.† The valence band maximum (VBM) of the FGr/MAPbI3 system is dominated by perovskite bands, while the main contribution from FGr comes at much lower energy (<2 eV). Moreover, the conduction band offset is much smaller and the states from FGr and MAPbI3 lie close to each other. Fig. 2b shows the band structure of FGr/MAPbI3 interface calculated along the high symmetry points. For clarity, contributions from different components of FGr/MAPbI3 interface are also shown. The band maxima are present around Γ-point, which is also the case for individual slabs. Similar to the bulk MAPbI3, the states around the valence band maximum are dominated by iodine atoms and contribution from FGr are present deep inside the valence band. However, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of FGr/MAPbI3 system comprises states from FGr, while the lowest lying unoccupied states of MAPbI3 are present at ∼0.15 eV above the CBM and mainly arise from Pb atoms.
 Fig. 2  DOS (a) and band structure (b) for FGr/MAPbI3 interface calculated using GGA+SOC functional. In the band structural plot, the contributions from interface atoms are indicated: Pb (red), I (purple), FGr (green). 
While Fig. 2 may provide qualitatively consistent picture of band-level alignment at the FGr/MAPbI3 interface, it cannot be relied on since GGA+SOC drastically underestimates the MAPbI3 band gap (∼1 eV).35 Indeed, a quantitatively correct picture of the MAPbI3 band structure can only be achieved by employing beyond-DFT methods (hybrid functionals, GW approximation) along with SOC correction.36,37 However, such calculations are not feasible for our system (<250 atoms with sizeable vacuum) due to prohibitive computational cost. Therefore, to provide a more realistic estimate of interface band-level alignment and charge transfer process, we calculated the shifts in VBM and CBM of MAPbI3 resulting from the change of functional from GGA+SOC to hybrid (PBE0)+SOC (see ESI, Section S3 for more details†). Such ‘scissor correction’ is justified since bonding between MAPbI3 and FGr is rather weak due to large interface separation (∼3.50 Å). Indeed, application of this method to a similar system (graphene/MAPbI3) yielded an accurate description of the interface energy level diagram, which is in good agreement with experimental results.32,38

Fig. 3 depicts the energy level diagram for FGr/MAPbI3 interface calculated with PBE0+SOC method as outlined above. The CBM of MAPbI3 lies above that of FGr and the band offset is sizable (0.45 eV). This suggests that electron transfer from MAPbI3 conduction band to that of FGr is energetically favored once electron is excited from the valence band to the conduction band of MAPbI3 due to light absorption. Moreover, the VBM of FGr is at much lower energy as compared with that of MAPbI3, which indicates that a hole present at the valence band of MAPbI3 due to photo-excitation cannot be transferred to the valence band of FGr due to the presence of sizeable energy barrier (∼1.85 eV) between VBMs. These results clearly indicate that the energy level diagram of FGr/MAPbI3 interface promotes the electron transfer (hole blockage) process.

This study highlights two important aspects of FGr/MAPbI3 systems. First, FGr forms a stable interface with MAPbI3 with binding energy comparable to that of its graphene counterpart. Moreover, the FGr/MAPbI3 interface is suitable for the electron transfer process. This suggests that strongly hydrophobic FGr can be integrated into perovskite halide-based solar cells, which will improve the moisture-related stability of devices without diminishing the performance. In particular, similar to other graphene-based systems,38–40 FGr can be used as an interlayer between a perovskite layer and an electron transfer medium (ETH) such as TiO2, leading to increased stability. We note that even though FGr is an insulator, a FGr layer is ultra-thin (3.25 Å thick); hence, charge transport through FGr can happen by tunnelling. More importantly, at the interface, the photo-excited electron carrier from MAPbI3 has kinetic energy higher than the conduction band edge of FGr (Fig. 3), thus it can go through FGr via the hopping process. Moreover, the conduction band offset calculated between FGr and MAPbI3 (∼0.45 eV) is close to the corresponding offset between TiO2 and MAPbI3 (∼0.5 eV).40 This suggests that there will be effectively no barrier between FGr and TiO2 for electron transfer. To confirm this result, we also studied the band-level alignment directly between FGr and TiO2 (ESI, Section S4†). These results (Fig. S4†) clearly indicate that CBM offset at the FGr/TiO2 interface facilitates charge transfer from FGr to TiO2. We would also like to point out that FGr is a very flexible material and its electronic and transport properties can be tuned, for example, by changing fluorine content.41 Furthermore, FGr can be employed in different conformations, such as quantum dots, to further tune the interfacial properties. Thus, future experimental research towards integrating FGr or electronically optimized partially fluorinated graphene-based systems within perovskite solar cells may solve the long-standing stability-related issues.
Computational method
All calculations have been performed using plane wave pseudo potential approach using VASP code.42 A kinetic energy cutoff of 520 eV has been used for the expansion of the plane waves, while 2 × 4 × 1 k-mesh is used to sample Brillouin zone. GGA in its PBE parameterization has been used as an exchange correlation functional,43 while van der Waals (vdW) interactions are taken into account by adding Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) dispersion correction.44
The hydrophobic property of FGr is well known. To further highlight the advantage of FGr, which is widely used as the inter/hydrophobic layer (e.g., EFGr), over graphene-like materials, we performed both first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These results (ESI, Section S5†) clearly indicate that FGr is considerably superior as a moisture-resistant material as compared with graphene.
The lattice parameter of cubic MAPbI3 is 6.34 Å, whereas FGr has hexagonal structure with a lattice parameter of 2.60 Å.23,35 To resolve the issue of the lattice mismatch, 7 × 2 rectangular layer was used for FGr, whereas  unit cells of cubic MAPbI3 perovskite were employed (Fig. 1), which reduced the lattice mismatch to ∼2%. Specifically, 3 stoichiometric layers of MAPbI3 (001) surface, which was the preferred orientation of growth, were employed.6 We would like to point out that while cubic phase is relevant with regard to cell's actual operating conditions (∼70 °C),45 the supercell employed herein is also commensurate with the tetragonal unit cell. We studied both PbI and MAI terminations for MAPbI3 (001) surface, though PbI was found to be energetically more favorable (Table 1). Moreover, a vacuum layer of ∼15 Å was provided to avoid interactions between periodic replicas of the FGr/MAPbI3 system. Finally, calculations were also performed with dipole correction, which essentially gave similar results.
In general, cubic MAPbI3 exhibits considerable rotational freedom, with (011) and (111) being the most probable orientations of MA.46 For the FGr/MAPbI3 interface, both orientations provided a quantitatively similar electronic structure. Thus, the results discussed in the main text are for the MAPbI3 slab with MA orientation of (111) (Fig. 1). Finally, to study the impact of MAPbI3 polarization, we also performed calculations for a non-polar cubic MAPbI3 slab. These results (see ESI, Section S6†) are qualitatively consistent with those discussed here.
Convergence criteria for total energy and forces (during structural optimization) were set to 10−5 eV and 0.025 eV Å−1. The band gap of FGr is ∼3 eV,24 which is correctly predicted by GGA.47 While structural properties of MAPbI3 are adequately described by the GGA+vdW approach, inclusion of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is necessary for the correct estimation of electronic properties. Therefore, electronic properties presented herein are calculated at the GGA+SOC and PBE0+SOC levels.
To highlight the effectiveness of FGr as an electron transfer interlayer, energy-level alignment between FGr and TiO2 is also provided in Fig. 3. We note that the DFT calculations of FGr/TiO2 are not feasible due to prohibitive computational cost (>400 atoms with sizeable vacuum; electronic properties at hybrid + SOC level). To assess the energy-level alignment at the TiO2/FGr interface, we adopted two different methods. (1) Energy-level alignment between TiO2 and FGr is estimated indirectly by comparing the energy-level alignment between FGr–MAPbI3 and TiO2–MAPbI3 (Fig. 3). (2) Energy-level alignment is calculated directly by comparing the ionization potentials of individual FGr and TiO2 slabs (see ESI Section S4 for more details†). From these methods, a similar value of CBM offset (∼0.1 eV) is obtained that supports charge transfer from FGr to TiO2.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we studied the interface between MAPbI3 and highly hydrophobic FGr. The results indicate that FGr forms a stable interface with MAPbI3 with appreciable binding energy (0.4 eV per Pb atom). Moreover, the alignments of CBM and VBM indicate that the FGr/MAPbI3 interface promotes electron transfer (hole blockage) process from MAPbI3 to FGr. These findings highlight the possibility of using FGr-based systems within perovskite halide solar cells, which will resolve the moisture-related degradation issues.
