    , Accepted 27th March 2013First published on 28th March 2013AbstractIn this paper, mixed-solvent vapor annealing (M-SVA) was proposed to improve polymer crystallinity and inhibit fullerene intercalation into polymer side chains in a poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) blend system. Experiments showed the optimal volume ratio of a mixed solvent, i.e., for tetrahydrofuran (THF) and carbon disulfide (CS2) vapor it is 1:1, and the appropriate annealing time is 5 min. After the M-SVA process, out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) data show that PCDTBT crystals with larger size and higher crystallinity were formed due to enhanced π–π interaction of polymer chains; the aggregation of PC70BM was promoted as well, which inhibited the intercalation behavior, resulting in a continuous electron path and improved phase purity. The morphology transition improved the carrier mobility, in particular electron mobility. Also, the recombination of a charge transfer (CT) state was reduced and the lifetime of mobile carriers was increased, which could be verified by transient-absorption (TA) spectra. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the BHJ reached 6.60%, an increase of more than 40% compared with the reference device (PCE = 4.54%), even though the thickness of the active layer is up to 220 nm and the PC70BM content is as low as 71.4 wt% by weight.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) materials comprising π-conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have demonstrated promising performance.1 A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4–5% has been reached for the PSCs based on the polythiophene and fullerene system by device optimization.2,3 However, the efficiency of this system is limited by a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). The quest for higher solar cell efficiencies has therefore focused on the use of alternative donor materials which have a reduced energy gap and an increased ionization potential.4,5
One promising new donor polymer for PSC applications is poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), which shows an absorption onset at 660 nm and a deep low energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). These features provide devices based on the PCDTBT:fullerene system with a high Jsc and Voc, and a remarkable ability to withstand exposure to high temperatures.6 When PCDTBT is blended with the fullerene acceptor [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM), the device exhibits a certified PCE value of 6% under AM1.5G irradiance of 100 mW cm−2.7,8 In recent studies concerned with the PCDTBT:PC70BM system, most research focused on a novel electron-transfer layer and hole-transfer layer, which could improve charge-transport properties and reduce recombination loss due to the existence of an interface dipole and/or regulation of the band edge energy offset at the interface.9–13 As we know, the performance of PSCs is also heavily dependent on the morphology of the photoactive layer.5,14 Unfortunately, the morphology of PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films is scarcely affected due to the low crystallinity of PCDTBT. Owing to a weak intermolecular interaction of PCDTBT, the thickness of the active layer is only 70–80 nm to ensure sweep-out of carriers prior to recombination,14,15 and the devices with a thick active layer (≥200 nm) obtain a poor performance, of lower than 5.5%.16 Nevertheless, a thick active layer is adequate for a commercial yield of BHJ solar cells fabricated by large-area and solution-based coating techniques. Moreover, there is sufficient space between the side-chains along the polymer backbone in PCDTBT, so that fullerene molecules can intercalate into the spaces to form an intercalated structure.1,17,18 This intercalated structure would inhibit phase separation, limit the transport of carriers and is not suitable for the separation of a charge transfer state.17–20 In order to fabricate a continuous carrier pathway, an excess of PC70BM is necessary, usually PC70BM:PCDTBT ratios of up to 4:1 by weight,14,15 which is not suitable for harvesting photons.14,19 In recent studies, only a few methods have inhibited intercalation behavior successfully, including adjusting fullerene size and increasing the crystallization rate of the polymer.17,21 However, adjusting fullerene size is tedious and may destruct the electrical properties of the fullerene. Besides, PCDTBT has a poor self-organization ability, and it is hard to realize the inhibition of fullerene intercalation into polymer side chains through regulating the polymer crystallization rate. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel methods to improve the crystallinity of PCDTBT and inhibit the intercalation behavior to lower the fullerene content.
Herein, we demonstrate a simple technique, mixed-solvent vapor annealing (M-SVA), to improve the crystallinity of PCDTBT and inhibit intercalation in a PCDTBT:PC70BM blend system. The mixed-solvent vapor is constituted by tetrahydrofuran (THF) and carbon disulfide (CS2) vapor, and the optimized volume ratio of THF to CS2 is 1:1. After M-SVA treatment, the intercalation behavior was restrained due to the aggregation of PC70BM, which facilitated the formation of a continuous electron path, even with a low fullerene content (φPC70BM = 71.4 wt%). Furthermore, the self-organization ability of PCDTBT was also improved, resulting in a larger size and higher crystallinity of PCDTBT nanofibrils. As a consequence, a nanoscale interpenetrating network structure with highly ordered stacking and pure domains was obtained (Scheme 1). This structure increased the mobility of carriers and the probability of CT state dissociation and prolonged the lifetime of the carrier. Compared with the device without any treatment, a higher fill factor (FF) and an increased short-circuit current density (Jsc) were obtained. Consequently, the BHJ yielded solar cells with a PCE of 6.60%, even though the thickness of the active layer was up to 220 nm and the PC70BM:PCDTBT ratios were low, 5:2 by weight, which was an increase of more than 40% compared with the reference device (PCE = 4.54%).

Experimental section
Materials
PCDTBT (molecular weight, Mw = 24000; polydispersity index, PDI = 1.8) was synthesized in our laboratory. 1H NMR information and energy level information on PCDTBT can be found in the ESI.† PC70BM was purchased from American Dye Source. THF and CS2 were purchased from Beijing Chemical Factory, China. The materials were used as received.
The mixed-solvent vapor annealing
During the mixed-solvent vapor annealing (M-SVA) process, the film was placed into a glass tube which contained THF and CS2 at the bottom, and its volume ratio was 1:1. A stable vapor gradient along the tube could be obtained after 6–10 h when the liquid solvent location was fixed. The vapor pressure of the sample was P = 0.81 (25 °C). (The length of the tube was 42.5 cm and the liquid height was 2.5 cm. The solvent vapor pressure is given by P = L/L0, where L is the distance from the upper edge of the setup to the specimen position and L0 is the distance from the upper edge of the setup to the surface of the solvent at the bottom of the tube.) The sample was treated under this vapor pressure for 5 min.
PSC fabrication
The solar cells were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates. The ITO-coated glass substrates were first cleaned with detergent, then ultrasonicated in water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, respectively, then dried by nitrogen flow. After treating the ITO substrate with UV ozone for 15 min, a 25 nm thick poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P4083) layer was spin-coated on this well-cleaned ITO glass and dried at 140 °C in a vacuum for 10 min. A solution containing a mixture of PCDTBT:PC70BM (2:5) in dichlorobenzene with a total concentration of 21 mg ml−1 was spin-cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer to produce a 220 nm thick active layer. Finally, a bilayer structure of Ca (30 nm)/Al (90 nm) was deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa to complete device fabrication. The cell active area was 12 mm2, which was defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Al electrodes.
Characterization
The morphology of the PCDTBT:PC70BM film was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). AFM was utilized to study the surface topography of the films. Images were obtained using a SPI3800N AFM (Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan) with a Si tip with a spring constant of 3 N m−1. The cantilevers were operated slightly below their resonance frequency of around 72 kHz. Image acquisition was performed in ambient conditions. AFM was performed in tapping mode to reduce tip-induced surface degradation and sample damage. TEM was applied to probe the vertical direction information of the PCDTBT:PC70BM film. Images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Thin films were first floated on deionized water and then transferred onto a copper grid. The samples were dried at room temperature for 12 h before TEM experiments.
The crystallinity of the PCDTBT:PC70BM film was analyzed using out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The GIXD profiles were obtained using a Bruker D8 Discover reflector with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. The measurements were obtained in a scanning interval of 2θ between 5 and 30°. To increase the GIXD peak intensity for investigating the crystallinity and orientation throughout the film, we employed an incident angle (α = 0.2°) slightly above the critical angle (αc = 0.18°). Spectroscopic ellipsometry (Horiba Jobin Yvon) was adopted to characterise Tg of the PCDTBT:PC70BM film. For measurements, the films deposited on a substrate (the substrate is Si with a 25 nm thick PEDOT:PSS) were placed on a Linkam heating/cooling stage within a cell containing a N2 atmosphere. The cell possesses two transparent windows to allow transmission of the polarized incident and reflected ellipsometry beams. The films were heated from 20 to 180 °C under a N2 atmosphere and then cooled to 20 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1. During the heating and cooling cycles, Ψ (the ratio of the amplitude of the incident to the reflected light beam) was recorded, employing a Cauchy model to fit Ψ, with a change in slope of Ψ vs. temperature being used to identify Tg.
To assess the extent of phase separation, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained with a LabRam HR800 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with an Olympus BX41 microscope in the backscattering geometry. Both the confocal hole and the slit width were fixed at 200 μm. A 632.8 nm He–Ne laser was focused on the sample with a 10× objective lens (0.75 NA).
Nanosecond fluorescence lifetime experiments were performed using the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system under right-angle sample geometry. A 379 nm picosecond diode laser (Edinburgh Instruments EPL375, repetition rate 20 MHz) was used to excite the samples. The fluorescence was collected by a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu H5783p) connected to a TCSPC board (Becker & Hickl SPC-130). The time constant of the instrument response function (IRF) is about 220 ps.
Subpicosecond time-resolved emission was measured using the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion method. A Nd:YVO laser (Millennia, Spectra Physics) was used to pump a Ti:sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics). Its output seeds a regenerative amplifier (RGA, Spitfire, Spectra Physics). The output of the amplifier of 1.5 mJ pulse energy, 100 fs pulse width, at 800 nm wavelength is split into two equal parts; the second harmonic of one beam was focused in the sample as the excitation source. The resulting fluorescence was collected and focused onto a 1 mm thick BBO crystal with a cutting angle of 35°. The other part of the RGA output was sent into an optical delay line and served as the optical gate for the upconversion of the fluorescence. The generated sum frequency light was then collimated and focused into the entrance slit of a 300 mm monochromator. A UV-sensitive photomultiplier tube 1P28 (Hamamatsu) was used to detect the signal. The electrical signal from the photomultiplier tube was summed by a digital oscilloscope. The relative polarization of the excitation and the gating beams was set to the magic angle. The FWHM of the instrument response function was about 500 fs. All the measurements were conducted at room temperature. All the fluorescence transients were fitted to multiexponential functions and were convoluted with the system response function by fixing the long lifetime obtained from TCSPC measurements. The fitting program is ASUFIT.
Current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the PV cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 236 source meter under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
In our work, we explored a novel method named M-SVA to construct the interpenetrating network structure of a PCDTBT:PC70BM system (the chemical structures of PCDTBT and PC70BM are shown in Fig. 1). To optimize the components of the mixed solvent vapor, THF and CS2 were selected, as THF could induce the aggregation of fullerene, and CS2 is a good solvent for PCDTBT. The ratio of THF to CS2 in the mixed solvent also has a significant impact on the morphology of the blend film. We used a series of mixed solvents with different ratios of THF to CS2, including 7:3, 1:1 and 7:3, to treat the active layers of devices and test the device performances. The results showed that the device treated by M-SVA with THF:CS2 = 1:1 shows the best performance, as shown in Fig. S1.† The annealing time is also an important parameter: the devices were treated with different annealing times, including 3 min, 5 min and 7 min, at the same vapor pressure. As shown in Fig. S2,† the device treated for 5 min showed the best performance. As a result, the ratio of THF to CS2 in the mixed solvent is selected as 1:1, and the annealing time is 5 min in the following experiments. At the same time, the vapor pressure for the annealing treatment is also examined, as shown in Fig. S3.† The appropriate vapor pressure is P = 0.81 when the annealing time is 5 min and the ratio of THF to CS2 is 1:1. As we know, the ratio of the donor to the acceptor has a profound influence on the morphology of the active layer as well as the device performance. Here, three ratios of PCDTBT to PC70BM were tested, 1:1 (φPC70BM = 50 wt%), 2:5 (φPC70BM = 71.4 wt%) and 1:4 (φPC70BM = 80 wt%). As revealed by Fig. S4,† the PCDTBT could self-organize into nanofibrils regardless of the fullerene content after the M-SVA treatment. However, the extent of phase separation is more homogeneous when the content of PC70BM is 71.4 wt% and 80 wt%. After the device performance test, the device with 71.4 wt% PC70BM content clearly shows the best performance (Fig. S5†), which may result from the enhanced photon absorption as shown in Fig. S6.† Thus, we discuss the morphology and device performance of films containing 71.4 wt% fullerene in detail in the following text.

Enhanced crystallinity and phase separation extent of blend films via M-SVA
PCDTBT has a weak intermolecular interaction and it is difficult to realize the interpenetrating network structure through the polymer crystallization process. To construct the interpenetrating network structure of the PCDTBT:PC70BM system, an M-SVA method was employed. After the M-SVA process, PC70BM molecules would aggregate into microcrystals, which inhibit intercalation behavior and induce phase separation. Meanwhile, the self-organization ability of PCDTBT is enhanced, resulting in lots of nanofibrils connected with each other. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of M-SVA, two control experiments, including treating the blend films in THF vapor and in CS2 vapor respectively, were also conducted.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to explore the surface morphologies of these films exposed to different vapor annealing processes. For the pristine film (without any treatment), no obvious textured surface can be observed either in the height image or in the phase image as displayed in Fig. 2(A). After the M-SVA treatment, significant variations occur: coarse fibril-like features run across the surface; the long fibrils are tightly packed and form an interpenetrating network structure as shown in Fig. 2(B). These features are assigned to the domains of PCDTBT crystallites, which could be attributed to the enhanced self-organization ability of PCDTBT during the vapor annealing process. However, if the film was treated in CS2 vapor, fibrils could only be found in the phase image, and there are no obvious fibril-like features in the height image as shown in Fig. 2(C). When THF is used to replace the mixed vapor, only big aggregates are observed as shown in Fig. 2(D).
 Fig. 2  Tapping mode AFM images and TEM images of PCDTBT:PC70BM blend films without and with different vapor annealing treatments, the ratio of THF to CS2 in the mixed solvent is 1:1, and the annealing time is 5 min: (A and a) without annealing treatment; (B and b) with M-SVA treatment; (C and c) with CS2 annealing treatment; (D and d) with THF annealing treatment. 
A comparison of different vapor annealed films using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also made. In the TEM images, the dark areas are attributed to PC70BM-rich domains because the electron scattering density of PC70BM is much higher than that of PCDTBT.22 As shown in Fig. 2(a), the interpenetrating networks were not well developed in the pristine film, and the donor–acceptor domains are difficult to distinguish. After the M-SVA treatment, the extent of phase separation was enhanced and the interpenetrating networks became clearer and easily visible as shown in Fig. 2(b), which is similar to the thermal annealing treatment in the P3HT:PC60BM system.23 Moreover, the contrast between polymer regions and fullerene regions is more obvious, which maybe results from the inhibition of fullerene intercalation into polymer side chains. In the films that were annealed in CS2 vapor, some PCDTBT nanofibrils could be observed, but there are no distinct domains of PC70BM formed and phase separation is not prominent as shown in Fig. 2(c). When the THF vapor was applied, the situation of film morphology is almost opposite to that using the CS2 vapor. As shown in Fig. 2(d), PC70BM molecules formed large aggregates and PCDTBT nanofibrils could be found scarcely. From the AFM and TEM data, it could be conjectured that the CS2 vapor treatment mainly promoted the self-organization ability of PCDTBT and the THF vapor treatment primarily induced PC70BM to aggregate into large domains. The M-SVA treatment promoted not only the crystallinity of PCDTBT but also the phase separation of blend films, which perhaps is a benefit to device performance.
In order to confirm the crystallinity of films with different annealing treatments, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was employed to characterize the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the PCDTBT component in blend films. This technique has already been used to study phase-transitions in PCDTBT and other polymers.24,25 As shown in Fig. 3, the ellipsometric parameter Ψ was recorded during the initial heating of blend films. Thermal transitions are identified by the intersection of straight-line fits to the linear sections of a Ψ vs. T plot, and the possible thermal transitions can be manifested by an increase or a decrease of dΨ/dt. In all of these SE curves, there are two significant different transitions. The first reduction in dΨ/dt of the blend films occurred when the films were heated to around 60–70 °C, and the second one appeared around 140–155 °C. Lidzey et al. also observed a thermal transition at 65 °C when the film was cast from chloroform, and they attributed this transition to evaporation of the residual solvent. In our work, the solvent is o-DCB, the boiling point of which is 179 °C.24 Moreover, the film was put in a vacuum pumping system for about 24 h to remove the residual solvent before the thermal transition experiment. Therefore, we deduced that in our experiment the thermal transition around 60–70 °C should be due to the dense packing of the side chains upon thermal annealing, which has already been confirmed by McGehee et al.14 The thermal transitions observed around 140–155 °C must be ascribed to the transition from a rubbery to a glassy state of PCDTBT. As a consequence, we can use this identification to rationalize the Tg of the films treated by different processes. As shown in Fig. 3(A), a thermal transition is apparent at 141 °C for the pristine film, while after the M-SVA treatment, the Tg of the film increases to 153 °C as shown in Fig. 3(B). We speculate, therefore, that the M-SVA treatment enhanced the average degree of intermolecular interaction in the blend films which resulted in an elevation of Tg. After the CS2 and THF vapor treatment, the Tg of the blend films increases to 149 °C and 146 °C (as shown in Fig. 3(C) and (D)), respectively. Comparing these data, it is prominent that the intermolecular π–π stacking degree of the film treated by M-SVA is higher than the one treated by CS2 or THF vapor annealing. That is to say, the crystallinity of PCDTBT can be improved effectively by the M-SVA treatment.
 Fig. 3  The Tg of the films without and with different annealing treatments was determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry, the ratio of THF to CS2 in the mixed solvent is 1:1, and the annealing time is 5 min. The ellipsometric parameter Ψ vs. temperature recorded during the first heating cycle of PCDTBT:PC70BM films (A) without annealing treatment, (B) with M-SVA treatment, (C) with CS2 annealing treatment, and (D) with THF annealing treatment. 
The crystallinity and intermolecular interaction can also be confirmed by out-of-plane GIXD. In the blend films, PCDTBT gives rise to peaks at 2θ = 18.3° for the (010) planes, corresponding to a d spacing of 4.8 Å, as illustrated in Fig. 4. These peaks have previously been ascribed to the distance between coplanar π-stacked polymer backbones,5,7 and their intensities can be used for deducing the crystallinity of PCDTBT in the films.26 Judging from the intensities of these peaks with and without a vapor treatment process, it is obvious that the crystallinity of PCDTBT was enhanced after the vapor treatment. Among the different vapor treatment processes, M-SVA is the most effective method to enhance the ordered packing of PCDTBT. Moreover, the mean size of the polymer crystals can be estimated using Scherrer's relation:27,28  where Δ2θ is the full width at half maximum of the peak.27 Using this equation, the sizes of crystals are about 16.4 Å, 24.7 Å, 23.1 Å and 22.8 Å for the films without an annealing treatment, with M-SVA treatment, CS2 vapor treatment and THF vapor treatment, respectively. The increased size of PCDTBT crystals indicates an enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking degree of the film. As a consequence, the increased extent of intermolecular π–π interaction is at a maximum when the film was subjected to mixed vapor annealing, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn from the SE data.
 Fig. 4  (A) The out of plane GIXD profile shows the crystallinity of PCDTBT:PC70BM films without and with different annealing treatments. (B) The PL spectra measured by Raman spectra shows the extent of phase separation of the PCDTBT:PC70BM films without and with different annealing treatments. The ratio of THF to CS2 in the mixed solvent is 1:1, and the annealing time is 5 min. 
In order to assess the extent of phase separation, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (see Fig. 4(B)) has been performed. For the pristine film, PL appears to be significantly quenched, which confirms that no excitons are lost. This is evidence that the fullerene is mixed with PCDTBT at a molecular level and forms an intercalated structure.19,29 When the films experienced vapor annealing, the observed PL quenching is not as significant. This phenomenon indicated that fullerene molecules diffused out of polymer side chains and the intercalated structure in the blend system was damaged,17 resulting in an enhanced phase separation, which is consistent with the morphology coarsening supported by AFM and TEM images. From the intensity of the PL peaks, it is obvious that the coarsening extent was at a maximum when THF vapor was employed; if we adopted CS2 vapor, the corresponding coarsening extent is at a minimum. If the mixed vapor was employed, an intermediate coarsening extent can be obtained. As we know, morphology coarsening was absent when the film was treated by thermal annealing owing to its intercalated structure and its thermodynamic stability.14 Therefore, the M-SVA treatment we proposed here is an effective method to restrict the intercalation behavior and enhance the phase separation extent in PCDTBT:PC70BM blend films.
The aggregation of fullerenes induced phase separation and enhanced π–π interaction of PCDTBT
After the M-SVA treatment, a distinct interpenetrating network structure was formed due to the inhibition of fullerene intercalation into PCDTBT side chains and the enhanced crystallinity of PCDTBT. The morphology transition of the blend film could be mainly attributed to the following factors. Firstly, the aggregation of fullerene promoted PC70BM molecules to diffuse out of the spaces between polymer sidechains, and then induced phase separation. Secondly, the migration ability and intermolecular π–π interaction of PCDTBT chains were enhanced, which facilitated the formation of nanofibrils.
PCDTBT is a low crystallinity polymer, it has sufficient space between the side chains to allow the fullerene molecules to intercalate into it and forms an intercalated structure.15,18,19,29 However, the intercalated behavior decreases the intermolecular π–π interaction,30 and inhibits phase separation. As a result, it is not facile for PCDTBT to form nanofibrils and the fullerenes are also difficult to aggregate into a continuous pathway, which results in a low mobility of carriers. Therefore, the optimum thickness of the active layer in a PCDTBT:PC70BM system is usually less than 100 nm, and the ratio of the acceptor to the donor reaches 4:1.14,17,31 To solve these issues, it is necessary to improve the crystallinity of PCDTBT and enhance the extent of aggregation of PC70BM. During the M-SVA treatment, the film was swollen, contributing to a better migration ability of donor and acceptor molecules. As is known to all, THF vapor induces fullerene molecules to form aggregates,32 which can be proved by the film morphology treated by THF annealing as shown in Fig. 2(d). As a consequence, under the mixed vapor atmosphere the aggregation behavior would promote the PC70BM molecules to diffuse out of PCDTBT side chains and form large aggregates, which inhibit the intercalation behavior and induce phase separation in blend films. Even with a low fullerene content (φPC70BM = 71.4 wt%) phase separation could also occur, which has been revealed by Fig. 2(B) and (b). Furthermore, CS2 is a good solvent for PC70BM, so excessive aggregation was inhibited.32
On the other hand, the self-organization ability of PCDTBT in a blend can be enhanced after the M-SVA treatment as we proved by SE and GIXD. PCDTBT shows a poor self-organization ability, which results from a serious entanglement between molecules and weak intermolecular interactions. CS2 is a good solvent for PCDTBT; as a result, polymer chains are more likely to adopt an extended conformation and the migration ability of polymer chains can also be improved due to the increased free volume of the molecule.14,33 In addition, the intermolecular π–π interaction of PCDTBT is enhanced, which is due to PC70BM molecules diffusing out of the polymer side chains.30 Consequently, polymer chains with a rod-like conformation could easily migrate to realize the π–π stacking, resulting in a greater crystallinity.
Reduced charge transfer state recombination, increased lifetime and mobility of carriers
The morphology of the active layer has a profound influence on device performance. The device treated with M-SVA showed a PCE of 6.60 ± 0.03% under AM1.5G illumination, 40% higher than that without an annealing treatment. The better device performance results from reduced charge transfer (CT) state recombination, an increased lifetime of the mobile carrier and carrier mobility, which could be attributed to the improved crystallinity of PCDTBT and inhibited intercalation in the blend system.
Photovoltaic devices based on PCDTBT:PC70BM blend films with different annealing treatments were made according to the standard ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC70BM/Ca/Al architecture. The performances of these devices are outlined in Table 1 and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5(A). From the J–V curves, it is obvious that the Voc of devices reached up to 0.87 eV. As we know, the Voc of a conjugated polymer–PCBM solar cell can be estimated by Voc = (1/e)(|EDonorHOMO| − |EPCBMLUMO|) − 0.3 V. We also know that the HOMO level of PCDTBT is −5.4 eV and the LUMO level of PC70BM is −3.9 eV. As a result, the Voc of the PCDTBT–PC70BM system should reach up to 1.2 eV according to the above formula. Energy losses that occur in the PCDTBT–PC70BM system during electron transfer can reach as high as 0.81 eV, much bigger than 0.3 eV,33 due to the energy distribution of the charge-transfer (CT) state. Subsequently, the Voc of the device in a PCDTBT–fullerene system is usually up to 0.85–0.89 V.11,34,35 For the device based on a pristine PCDTBT:PC70BM film, the low Jsc and FF of 10.88 mA cm−2 and 48%, respectively, contribute to a PCE of only 4.54%. After the CS2 or THF annealing treatment, a substantial increase in Jsc and FF eventually contributes to an improved PCE of 6.14% and 5.36%, respectively. Exhilaratingly, a more promising device performance could be obtained after the M-SVA treatment, showing Voc = 0.86 V, Jsc = 12.78 mA cm−2, FF = 60%, and PCE = 6.60%, which is more than 40% higher than the device without an annealing treatment. The parameters of device performance without and with different vapor annealing treatment are summarized in Table 1 and the obvious changing trend of PCE can be found in Fig. 5(B).

The ratio of THF to CS2 in the mixed solvent is 1:1, and the annealing time is 5 min. 
In order to illustrate the improvement of device performance after M-SVA treatment, some physical characterizations were performed. Fig. 6 shows the transient-absorption (TA) spectra for PCDTBT:PC70BM without and with M-SVA treatment over the spectral range 450 nm to 850 nm measured at five different time delay times following excitation at 601 nm. For a pristine PCDTBT:PC70BM film, two spectral features are evident as shown in Fig. 6(A): one is a negative signal with a maximum at around 590 nm, resulting from photobleaching (PB) of the absorption band; the other is a broad photoinduced absorption (PIA) band after about 640 nm.31 As the delay time increases, the PB signal shifts from 590 nm to 598 nm (red shift), the red shift originates from the energy transfer via interchains or intrachains from the high energy region to the low energy region. After the M-SVA treatment, the red shift extent of the PB signal was enhanced (from 600 nm to 620 nm) as shown in Fig. 6(B). The enhanced red shift implied a decreased energy of the system after the M-SVA treatment, which may be induced by a more ordered packing of polymer chains, as already proved by SE and GIXD.

(B) The transient decay dynamics of PCDTBT:PC70BM films without and with M-SVA annealing treatment, the pump wavelength is 610 nm, the ratio of THF to CS2 in the mixed solvent is 1:1, and the annealing time is 5 min. 
The broad PIA band after 640 nm is similar to the PIA bands commonly appearing in semiconducting polymers:fullerene composite films.32,36 We attribute the PIA band to CT formation (generated via an ultrafast electron transfer from PCDTBT to PC70BM and hole transfer from PC70BM to PCDTBT) and polaron formation (generated as the bound state dissociates) following photoexcitation.31,36 As shown in Fig. 6(A), the PIA signal corresponding to the pristine film decays almost completely within 6 ps after photoexcitation. However, the decay rate is slowed down after the M-SVA treatment and the amplitude of the PIA band remains 40% after 1330 ps as shown in Fig. 6(B). This observation verifies reduced CT recombination losses and a larger fraction of the CT state dissociating into long-lived mobile carriers after the M-SVA treatment.36 This phenomenon can be explained by the enhanced crystallinity of the blend film and forming PCDTBT and PC70BM connective pathways, relatively, after the M-SVA treatment. Such a morphology change would enhance carrier mobility in each of the subphases, which we prove in the following text. In the Onsager–Braun model for charge generation, the higher mobility allows geminate charge carriers to escape from their mutual attraction more efficiently.37 Moreover, the intercalation behavior was inhibited after the M-SVA treatment, resulting in a pure polymer phase. The morphology transition reduces ionisation of the polymer, which would provide enough energetic driving force for spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.19

Fig. 6(C) displays the photoexcitation signal decay in PCDTBT:PC70BM without and with M-SVA treatment when probed at 601 nm. Both of the TA signals exhibit an initial fast decay followed by a slow decay that extends into the nanosecond time regime. However, the TA signals obtained from the film with the M-SVA treatment exhibit a substantially slower decay rate compared to the one obtained from the pristine film. The slower decay rate could be attributed to the inhibited intercalation behavior in PCDTBT:PC70BM blend films, which enhanced the degree of phase separation and the phase purity. As a result, the density of traps that would capture a long-lived mobile carrier and thereby limit the lifetime of the carriers was reduced.21
The so-called single carrier devices were also fabricated to investigate the effect of an annealing treatment on carrier transport. Fig. 7(A) reveals the dark I–V characteristics of the hole-only devices, having a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC70BM/MoO3/Al with the PCDTBT:PC70BM films without and with an annealing treatment, respectively. The applied voltage was corrected for the built-in voltage (VBI). After the M-SVA treatment, the hole mobility of the device was increased, which was attributed to the increase of PCDTBT crystallinity and the good connectivity of crystalline nanofibers.38 In addition, the electron-only devices involving a structure of Al/PCDTBT:PC70BM/Ca/Al were also fabricated. As shown in Fig. 7(B), the electron mobility is relatively low when the device does not undergo treatment. The low mobility must result from the intercalation behavior of the PCDTBT:PC70BM system, which would suppress the aggregation of fullerene, so it is hard to form a continuous electron pathway. However, after M-SVA treatment, electron transport was significantly improved. We ascribe this rise to the aggregation of PC70BM, which induced phase separation and formed a continuous electron pathway.39 The improved electron and hole mobility would enhance charge separation and retard charge recombination, and are common features of high photovoltaic performance blend films.

Conclusions
In this contribution, a novel method named M-SVA treatment was employed to control the morphology of PCDTBT:PC70BM blend films. The components of the mixed solvent are THF and CS2, and their appropriate ratio is 1:1. After treating the films with mixed solvent vapor for 5 min, an optimized morphology was obtained: an interpenetrating network structure with a nanoscale phase separation, a high phase purity and large-sized PCDTBT crystals with high crystallinity. During the M-SVA process, the PC70BM molecules diffused out of PCDTBT sidechains and formed large aggregates due to the THF component, which induced phase separation. Moreover, owing to the existence of the CS2 vapor component, the migration ability of PCDTBT chains was improved, which enhanced its self-organization ability and facilitated the formation of nanofibrils. The morphology change increased the probability of CT state dissociation, the lifetime of the carriers and also the mobility of carriers. Therefore, a substantial increase in Jsc and FF contributes to an improved PCE of 6.60%, even though the thickness of the active layer is up to 220 nm and the PC70BM content is as low as 71.4 wt% by weight.
