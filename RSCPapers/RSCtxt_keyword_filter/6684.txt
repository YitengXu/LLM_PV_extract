    , Accepted 20th February 2017First published on 21st February 2017AbstractHerein, we successfully prepared dithiocarbamate-based Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) precursor solutions using various amino groups such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, amylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, and ethanolamine. These solutions exhibited a distinguishing wetting behavior, viscosity, and stability and could be used to fabricate CZTS thin films by a simple spin-coating and annealing process. We compared the thermogravimetric analysis of the precursor solutions and the XRD patterns of the as-prepared CZTS films and clear differences between the samples were observed. Furthermore, we fabricated high-quality CZTS films using the ethanoldithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solution, and the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cell with the best power conversion efficiency (7.66%) under 1.5 AM illumination was achieved.
1. Introduction
The molecular precursor solution deposition strategy shows outstanding advantages for cutting costs in non-vacuum-based processes; moreover, with this method, highly uniform compositions can be achieved and it is based on a continuous roll-to-roll process, which is particularly attractive for the fabrication of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells.1–5 Various molecular solution deposition strategies such as hydrazine-based,6,7 thiourea-based,8,9 thioacetamide-based,10,11 thioglycollic acid-based,12,13 amine–thiol-based,14–16 and dithiocarbamate-based solution processes have been successfully employed for fabricating CZTSSe absorber layers.17,18 The most successful solution deposition strategy is hydrazine-based solution process, which exhibits the record efficiency of 12.6% for CZTSSe solar cells.19 However, the toxicity and flammability of hydrazine makes this method unsuitable for large-scale industrial production. The thiourea-based, thioacetamide-based, thioglycollic acid-based, amine–thiol-based solution processes utilize the coordination between metals and ligands.8–16 However, it is hard to change the ligands for a limited coordination mode. Interestingly, the dithiocarbamate-based solution process relies on the coordination between a metal and dithiocarbamate, but the amine groups could be replaced with various groups. Therefore, this process provides diversified choices to prepare CZTS precursor solutions.20
Dithiocarbamate-based ligands have demonstrated excellent advantages in the synthesis of nanocrystals,21,22 ligand exchange of quantum dots23 or nanocrystals,24 and preparation of molecular precursor solutions.17,25 The dithiocarbamate-based ligands display a strong coordination capacity, excellent thermal degradation performance, and outstanding solubility;17,23–25 therefore, they have become one of the most successful precursors for preparing CZTS precursor solutions. In previously reported studies, we used butyldithiocarbamic acid-based metal–organic molecular solutions to fabricate Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)225 and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells17 and studied the enhanced grain growth in the CZTSSe absorber layers by inserting Sb-based thin films.18 Moreover, Wu's group used the butyldithiocarbamic acid-based solution approach to prepare Cd-doped CZTSSe solar cells.26 The butyl group in butyldithiocarbamic acid could be replaced with various amine-based groups to form substituted dithiocarbamic acid,23 which could then be used as a ligand for preparing CZTS precursor solutions. Polar amines could change the solubility of the metal precursor, and the molecular weight of the amine group could affect the thermal-decomposition process of the CZTS precursor solution. Thus, it is meaningful to study dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions prepared with various amine groups. Herein, we systematically studied the fabrication of dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions using various amino groups such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, amylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, and ethanolamine. The dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions prepared using methylamine and ethylamine showed a poor wetting behavior on the Mo substrate and could not fabricate the continuous films. Moreover, the stability of the dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions prepared by amylamine, hexylamine and octylamine is poor and easily formed a gel for the long-chain ligands. Interestingly, the propyl-, butyl-, and ethanol-dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions demonstrated the excellent wetting behavior and stability for the suitable length and polarity of ligands. Therefore, we chose the ethanoldithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solution to prepare the CZTS films. By fabricating high-quality CZTSSe thin films after the selenization process, a power conversion efficiency of 7.66% under 1.5 AM illumination was achieved.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
Carbon disulfide (CS2, 99.9%), methylamine (CH3NH2, 30–33 wt% alcohol solution), ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2, 99%), propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2, 99%), 1-butylamine (CH3(CH2)2CH2NH2, 99%), amylamine (CH3(CH2)3CH2NH2, 98%), hexylamine (CH3(CH2)4CH2NH2, 99%), octylamine (CH3(CH2)6CH2NH2, 99%), ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 99%), dimethyl sulfoxide ((CH3)2SO, 99.9%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, AR), 2-methoxyethanol (HOCH2CH2OCH3, 99%), selenium (Se, 99.9%), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25%), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4·8/3H2O, 99%), and thiourea (NH2CSNH2, 99%) were obtained from Aladdin. Copper(II) acetate monohydrate (Cu(Ac)2·H2O, 99.9%), zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 99.9%), and tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2 Preparation of the precursor solutions
CZTS precursor solutions were prepared according to a modified literature method, which was previously reported by our group.17 First, 4 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide, 3 mL of CS2 (∼50 mmol), and 6.25 mL of methylamine were slowly mixed under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Subsequently, 0.764 g of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (∼3.83 mmol), 0.341 g of ZnCl2 (∼2.5 mmol), and 0.451 g of SnCl2·2H2O (∼2 mmol) were dissolved in the solutions under magnetic stirring at 50 °C. Other CZTS precursor solution preparations are similar to the typical process except for the volume of amine (3.3 mL) ethylamine (∼50 mmol), 4.2 mL propylamine (∼50 mmol), 5 mL 1-butylamine (∼50 mmol), 5.8 mL amylamine (∼50 mmol), 6.7 mL hexylamine (∼50 mmol), 8.3 mL octylamine (∼50 mmol), and 3.3 mL ethanolamine (∼50 mmol). Moreover, DMSO was replaced with 2-methoxyethanol for 1-butylamine, amylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, and ethanolamine. Finally, the eight CZTS precursor solutions were diluted to a total metal concentration of 0.70 M with DMSO or 2-methoxyethanol, following centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 min prior to spin-coating. All the procedures were conducted in the air.
2.3 Preparation of the CZTS thin films
The CZTS precursor solutions, prepared using methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, amylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, and ethanolamine as raw materials, were spun-coated onto soda-lime glasses and Mo-coated glasses (20 × 20 × 1.1 mm) at 2500 rpm for 20 s, annealing at 320 °C on a hot plate for 2 min to form the CZTS nanocrystal thin films. For the methyl-, ethyl-, and propyl-dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions, deposition was repeated 20 times and for the other CZTS precursor solutions, deposition was repeated 9 times to achieve a film with a suitable thickness.
2.4 Preparation of the selenized-CZTS thin films
We placed four as-prepared CZTS thin films, which used methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, amylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, and ethanolamine as raw materials, and 100 mg of selenium powder into a sealed graphite box (∼60 mm in diameter and ∼50 mL in volume). Then, the thin films were selenized at 540 °C for 10 min in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace (MTI, OTF-1200X-4-RTP) under a nitrogen flow (∼80 mL min−1). In total, we selenized sixteen as-prepared thin films.
2.5 Preparation of the CZTSSe photovoltaic devices
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated by chemical-bath deposition of 60 nm of a CdS thin film (200 mL of deionized H2O, 12.5 mL of NH4OH, 76.8 mg of cadmium sulfate, and 110 mg of thiourea in a 65 °C water bath for 12 min), RF-sputtering ∼60 nm of intrinsic ZnO, DC-sputtering ∼250 nm of indium tin oxide (ITO), and thermal evaporation of the Al grid electrode. Four devices (with an active area of 0.37 cm2 for each cell, ∼95% of the total device area) were isolated by mechanical scribing with a pen-knife.
2.6 Characterization
The XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analyzer (Bruker AXS XFlash detector 4010). J–V curves were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (Abet Sun 2000; AM 1.5) by a home-made probe station. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport optical power meter (model 842-PE) certified by Newport. The external quantum efficiency was measured using a Zolix SCS100 QE system equipped with a 150 W xenon light source, a lock-in amplifier, and an integrating sphere.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the simplified preparation process of the eight types of CZTS precursor solutions. Many primary and secondary amines could react with carbon disulfide and metal cations to form dithiocarbamate salts,23 and the dithiocarbamate salts could easily dissolve in polar organic solvents. We chose short-chain amines as the raw materials for reacting with carbon disulfide to form dithiocarbamic acid. The dithiocarbamic acid, as a bidentate ligand, showed a strong coordination ability towards Cu2+, Zn2+, and Sn2+ and could be easily dissolved in polar organic solvents. The eight types of CZTS precursor solutions showed different colors from light yellow to sepia, which can be explained by the partial oxidation of Cu in the precursor solutions. The solvents and ligands also affect the color of the Cu-based precursor solutions (Fig. S1, ESI†). Furthermore, when the sepia CZTS precursor solution was stored in an oxygen-free environment, the color would slowly become lighter. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of eight types of CZTS precursors are presented in Fig. 2. The TGA samples were prepared from the CZTS precursor solutions by removing the low-boiling-point solvents under vacuum at 60 °C, followed by heating at 60 °C for 48 h. It was found that three types of CZTS precursors fabricated by ethylamine, octylamine, and ethanolamine started to lose weight at 30 °C, which suggested that some solvents were still present in the CZTS precursors. Other types of CZTS precursor started to decompose at ∼150 °C, with weight loss occurring relatively fast between 150 and 250 °C, which could be attributed to the decomposition of the dithiocarbamate salt. The TGA profile shows that the CZTS precursors are almost completely decomposed between 250 and 320 °C. When the temperature is higher than the decomposition temperature, CZTS nanocrystals are formed. The decomposition temperature mainly depends on the interactions of metals and ligands and on the decomposition temperature of the ligands. The amount of weight loss is related to the molecular weight of the ligands, whereas the decomposition temperature depends on the ligand structures, which in turn is related to the coordination ability between metal and ligands, thus determining the temperature at which bonds are broken. Therefore, based on the TGA data, we chose 320 °C as the annealing temperature to fabricate the CZTS nanocrystal thin films.17

The eight types of CZTS precursor solutions were used to deposit CZTS nanocrystal thin films on soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates by a standard spin-coating and annealing process in a nitrogen-filled glove-box.17,18 The goal of our study was to obtain pure-phase CZTS films without organic ligands by heating. For this approach to be successful, the ligands must be removed before the nanocrystals sinter. As is known, the CZTS films fabricated from organic solutions always contain some impurities such as carbon and chloridion. This is an inherent characteristic of the solution deposition process and cannot be completely solved. Therefore, the phase purity of the as-prepared CZTS film becomes important, which can avoid unexpected impurities in the phases of selenized films. We acquired X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the eight types of CZTS nanocrystal thin films (Fig. 3), which reveal that the CZTS films have a zinc-blende structure. The as-fabricated CZTS thin films exhibit very broad and weak diffraction peaks, which correspond to the (111), (220), and (311) planes of the zinc-blende structure, indicating that the CZTS thin films are composed of small-size nanocrystals.27–29 The eight types of CZTS films show slightly different crystallinity, which is attributed to the different molecular weight of the ligands. This can be explained by the longer annealing time needed for CZTS with higher molecular weight ligands, which displayed a slower weight loss.

The dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions prepared with methylamine and ethylamine showed a poor wetting behavior on the Mo substrate (see Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). Therefore, we chose the ethanoldithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solution to prepare CZTS films. The CZTSSe films were fabricated by a standard selenization process, which could significantly enhance the crystal growth and adjust the composition of the absorber layers. We examined the crystal structure of the CZTSSe thin film by XRD. As shown in Fig. 4a, the peaks in the XRD pattern of the selenized CZTSSe thin films are significantly stronger and sharper than those of the as-prepared CZTS films, indicating an improvement of the crystallinity and an increased grain size, which is desirable for highly-efficient CZTSSe solar cells.19 Moreover, due to S being replaced with Se, the peaks in the CZTSSe pattern shifted to low angles. Moreover, the CZTSSe thin film displays a typical kesterite structure. To avoid the overlapping of the XRD signals from the binary and ternary impurity phases due to their similar crystal structures, we utilized the Raman spectrum to examine the phase purity, as seen in Fig. 4b. The four remarkable peaks corresponding to 172, 196, 238, and 326 cm−1 were consistent with the kesterite structure of the CZTSSe thin film.17,30 Thus, based on the XRD and Raman spectroscopy results, we confirmed the selenized CZTSSe thin film with the kesterite structure and without any possible impurity phases.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 5a) showed the as-prepared CZTS thin film fabricated by ethanoldithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solution on Mo-coated SLG. The CZTS nanocrystal thin film is uniform, crack-free, and pinhole-free, with the thickness of ∼1.5 μm. The plane views of the selenized CZTSSe thin film at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 5b and c. The CZTSSe thin film displays a grain size ranging from 1 to 4 μm after the selenization process. The compact and smooth surface morphology is desired for fabricating highly efficient CZTSSe solar cells, which are beneficial to decrease the bulk and interface recombination, thus enhancing the efficiency.19Fig. 5d shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a fabricated CZTSSe solar cell with the glass/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al structure.17,18 The buffer layer, absorber layer and Mo can be easily identified. The selenized CZTSSe thin film exhibits an obvious bilayer morphology consisting of a dense large-grained top layer (∼1 μm) and a carbon-rich small-grained bottom layer (∼1 μm). The thickness of the MoSe2 layer is ∼400 nm. The carbon-rich small-grained layer has been reported for various solution processes and can be attributed to a poor thermal decomposition process.12–18 The sintering temperature of semiconductor nanocrystals is far below their bulk melting temperatures. Therefore, the sintered nanocrystals could restrict the escape of the decomposition products, forming a small number of carbon impurities within the CZTS film.

We fabricated a CZTSSe solar cell device from the ethanoldithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solution. The device had the conventional structure of glass/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al, and its power conversion efficiency (PCE) was measured under AM 1.5 illumination.
The best device performance is shown in Fig. 6a, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.44 V, a current density (Jsc) of 34.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 50.0%, yielding a PCE of 7.66%. Moreover, Fig. 6b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the CZTSSe solar cell device with the best value of 7.66%. The quantum efficiency in the range from 450 nm to 1100 nm is above 80% and especially the maximum value is 90%, indicating that the majority of visible-range photons are absorbed by the photovoltaic device. The calculated Jsc from the EQE spectrum is 34.6 mA cm−2, which is slightly lower than the measured Jsc under AM 1.5 illumination. Furthermore, the band gap of the CZTSSe thin film was calculated by plotting [hv × ln(1 − EQE)2] versus hv, and a value of 1.08 eV was obtained, which is slightly lower than that of the record highly efficient CZTSSe solar cells (1.1–1.2 eV).19

For evaluating the applicability of other precursor solutions, we fabricated the selenized films and the corresponding solar cells. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of selenized CZTS films, and they display a typical kesterite structure. However, some binary and ternary impurity phases have similar XRD patterns to that of the CZTSSe compounds; therefore, XRD was insufficient to determine the phase purity of the CZTSSe thin films. Therefore, the selenized CZTSSe thin films were examined by SEM and EDS to determine the phase purity.

Fig. 7 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the selenized films on Mo-coated solid glasses using the other precursor solutions. The SEM image of the CZTSSe thin film, fabricated from the methyldithiocarbamate-based precursor solution, shows obvious cracks on the surface (Fig. 7a). Moreover, some large grains are present in the cross-sectional SEM image, with the particle size of about 10 μm, which is obviously higher than that of the surface particles. In addition, the top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the CZTSSe thin films fabricated from the ethyl- (Fig. 7c and d), propyl- (Fig. 7e and f), butyl- (Fig. 7g and h), and amyl- (Fig. 7i and j) dithiocarbamate-based precursor solutions all show clear phase impurities. The size of the large grains is about 10 μm on the surfaces, and the particle size of continuous absorber layers is 2–4 μm. Furthermore, we could find a thin impurity layer on the continuous absorber layers, which is not reported in previous works. A thin carbon-rich impurity layer is always present in the bottom of the absorber layers fabricated by a solution process. Moreover, the surfaces of the CZTSSe thin films fabricated by the hexyl- (Fig. 7k) and octyl- (Fig. 7m) dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions show visible cracks and some small particles stacked on the large grains.
 Fig. 7  Top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the selenized films fabricated from methyldithiocarbamate (a and b), ethyldithiocarbamate (c and d), propyldithiocarbamate (e and f), butyldithiocarbamate (g and h), amyldithiocarbamate (i and j), hexyldithiocarbamate (k and l), and octyldithiocarbamate (m and n) precursor solutions. 
In addition, we fabricated the solar cells using the abovementioned selenized films, but could not obtain efficient photovoltaic devices. For the selenized films fabricated with the methyl-, hexyl-, and octyl-dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions, the penetrating cracks led to a short circuit in the solar cell. Moreover, the impurity phase and thin impurity layer on the surface of absorber layers prevented the formation of a p–n junction, and the photogenerated charge carriers could not be effectively separated. Thus, we could not fabricate efficient photovoltaic devices by the ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, and amyl-dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions either. The microstructure of the selenized films fabricated with the methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, amyl-, hexyl-, and octyl-dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions showed different surface characteristics compared with the selenized film prepared with the ethanol-dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solution.
We fabricated the pure phase CZTSSe absorber layers using metal oxides as the metal sources or ethanoldithiocarbamate as the ligands, which has been demonstrated in this study. Thus, we concluded that the metal source and the ligands determine the phase purity of the selenized films. Metal oxides showed clear advantages in the fabrication of pure-phase CZTSSe films, but were unfavorable in the dissolution process, as it needed heat treatment and a long dissolution time. Metal salts could be quickly dissolved, but they led to the formation of impurity phases when the raw material is a primary amine.
To determine the phase purity, we examined the selenized films by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping and line scan. Fig. 8a shows the elemental mapping images of the selenized film fabricated with the methyldithiocarbamate-based precursor solution. The large grains are filled with a high concentration of Sn, S, and Se, and thus these large grains in the selenized films were assigned as the Sn(S,Se)2 impurity phase. As shown in Fig. 8b, the elemental mapping of the selenized CZTS thin film fabricated with the amyldithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions show that the grains with a sheet shape are filled with a high concentration of Cu, S, and Se; thus, these large grains were assigned as the Cux(S,Se) impurity phase. Moreover, the surface shows an uneven distribution of carbon, which demonstrated a carbon impurity film on the absorber layer. For the selenized film fabricated with the octyldithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solution, the EDS line scan along the axial direction showed an uneven distribution of Zn (Fig. 8c and d); thus, we concluded that the small particles stacked on the large grains are of the Zn(S,Se) impurity phase.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we developed a versatile strategy to fabricate various CZTS precursor solutions using metal salts, CS2, and short chain amines as the raw materials. These solutions showed a distinct wetting behavior, viscosity, and stability and could be used to easily fabricate CZTS thin films by a simple spin-coating and annealing process. The CZTS precursor solutions prepared by methylamine and ethylamine showed a poor wetting behavior on the Mo substrate and cannot fabricate the thick and high-quality CZTS films. Moreover, the solutions prepared from amylamine, hexylamine, and octylamine are unstable and easily formed a gel after a few days. The selenized thin films, fabricated with the methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, amyl-, hexyl-, and octyl-dithiocarbamate-based CZTS precursor solutions, showed phase separation and a poor microstructure; thus, we could not achieve the CZTSSe solar cells with good power conversion efficiencies. Therefore, we chose the ethanoldithiocarbamate-based precursor solution to prepare CZTS films. A power conversion efficiency of 7.66% under 1.5 AM illumination was achieved using the high-quality CZTSSe thin film as the absorber layer. With this study, we have opened a broad avenue for the fabrication of CZTS precursor solutions and nanocrystal thin films via a simple, versatile, and green solution-processing route. Moreover, these various precursor solutions can be widely used for the fabrication of other types of metal sulfide precursor solutions and films.
