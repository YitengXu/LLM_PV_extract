    AbstractPerylene dyes not only feature high chemical and photochemical stability, high molar absorptivities and fluorescence quantum yields but also offer wide possibilities for chemical functionalisation via the introduction of hydrophobic or hydrophilic substituents, electron donors or acceptors, and functional groups for attachment to polymers or biomolecules. In the past decade, novel homologues of perylene (containing additional naphthalene units and bearing additional aromatic rings) have been reported. In this article, we summarise synthetic routes to core-enlarged perylene dyes as well as their practical applications.
1. Introduction
Perylene dyes are key chromophores in dye chemistry. Their solubility, absorption, and emission behaviour can be efficiently tuned by functionalisation with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups.1 Moreover, introducing additional naphthalene units into the perylene core leads to higher perylene homologues (terrylene,2 quaterrylene3 and higher rylene dyes4). Such dyes can be used for laser welding or laser marking of polymers and as efficient heat blockers.5 Due to their outstanding chemical and photochemical stabilities as well as their high fluorescence quantum yields,6 perylene and terrylene dyes have been established as key chromophores for single molecule spectroscopy (SMS).7 This provides photophysical processes, such as energy and electron transfer, to be studied on the single molecule level over extended periods of time.8 Water-soluble rylene dyes now allow for single molecule measurements in biological problems, such as enzyme tracking.9,10 The same set of favourable properties also qualifies the rylene dyes as excellent candidates for applications in organic electronic devices.11 Using an additional enlargement of a perylene core in the bay-region,12 coronene13 and dibenzocoronene14 dyes can be easily prepared. With these various light-absorbing dyes, the rylene series can cover the broad region of visible (400–760) and NIR (760–1200 nm) absorption. Basically, the chemistry of rylene imides starts with perylene diimide (PDI) 1, first prepared in 1912.15 Commercially available perylene tetracarboxdianhydride (PDA) 2 is prepared from 1 by its saponification16 and can be halogenated either two17 or four times18 (Scheme 1). The anhydrides 2, 3 and 5 can be converted to corresponding imides (PDIs) 1, 4 and 6, which represent useful building blocks for the synthesis of water-soluble, push-pull and core-expanded dyes.

Alternatively, one-pot imidisation-decarboxylation of 2 affords perylene momoimide (PMI) 719 which has a hypsochromically shifted absorption when compared to PDI. It can be functionalised via bromination3 to give basic building blocks 8 and 9 for the extension of the perylene core. There are two main positions for the modification of the perylene core: position 3 of the naphthalene subunit is known as peri- and position 1 as bay- (Fig. 1). Enlargement of the perylene molecule at peri-positions (along the long axis) is referred to here as core-extension, and at bay-positions as core-expansion.
 Fig. 1  Ways of enlarging the perylene core. 
2. Core-extended perylene dyes
2.1. Rylene monoimides
Rylene monoimides, especially perylene monoimides (PMIs) are the key building block for synthesizing higher rylene homologues. PMI 7 is achieved by a mixed imidisation-decarboxylation route (Scheme 2).19 Subsequently, PMI 7 can be brominated either once to give PMI 8, or three times to give PMI 9 (Scheme 1).3
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of perylene monoimides. 
Furthermore, selective phenoxylation of 9 affords diphenoxyPMI 10, which can be coupled with 1-dioxaborolane-5-nitronaphthalene (Scheme 3). The resulting PMI-naphthalene dyad 11 has electron-withdrawing groups on both ends of the molecule. These groups enable cyclodehydrogenation under basic conditions to give the second PMI homologue—terrylene monoimide 12 (TMI, Scheme 3). TMI has a bright blue colour in solution with λmax at 644 nm (Fig. 2) and a molar absorptivity of 83000 M−1 cm−1 compared to the orange PMI 7 (510 nm, ε = 41500 M−1 cm−1). After reduction and subsequent Sandmeyer reaction, TMI 12 can be converted to iodoTMI 13, which has an additional naphthalene unit compared to starting PMI 10, and is useful as a building block for further extension of the rylene core.4
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of terrylene monoimides. 
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of rylene momoimides in toluene: PMI (solid), TMI (dash), QMI (dot). 
The next homologue, quaterrylene monoimide (QMI) 17, is synthesised by another method.20 The Suzuki coupling of PMI-boronic ester 14 either with monobromo- or with dibromoperylene 15 affords dyad 16, which is cyclodehydrogenated to the corresponding QMI derivative 17 (Scheme 4). Compared to TMIs, the absorption of QMIs is shifted bathochromically by 90 nm (735 nm, ε = 143000 M−1 cm−1) and accompanied only by negligible fluorescence. Such a low emission can be explained by a strong aggregation of QMI in solution, which is also supported by 1H-NMR data.20
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of quaterrylene monoimides. 
Additional substitution (of hydrogens) in the peri- and bay-positions allows for a significant change in the absorption properties of rylene monoimides. Metal-catalysed substitution (Buchwald–Hartwig cross coupling reaction) of peri-bromide 8 followed by deprotection affords the blue amino-PMI 19. The latter, after acylation with di-tert-butyldicarbonate (Boc2O), produces the red thermotropic dye 20 (Scheme 5), which easily releases Boc groups upon heating to give the starting blue dye 19.21
 Scheme 5  Synthesis of red thermotropic dyes. 
Another possibility for using amino-groups at peri-positions is the quinoidal charge delocalisation of amino-substituted dyes in the presence of a strong base. Naphthalene, perylene, terrylene and quaterrylene monoimides 21 are reacted with 4-cyanoaniline to give the homologue series 22 (Scheme 6). The value of the bathochromic shift, caused by the electron-donating effect of the amino group, is lowered by extending the π-system of the molecule (Table 1). Upon addition of a base and subsequent removal of the amino proton, the negative charge is delocalized on imide oxygen to give a quinoidal structure.22 With this type of conjugation the value of the bathochromic shift increases with the molecular size, giving a giant bathochromic shift of 435 nm for the quaterrylene derivative 23d (compared to 22d, Table 1).

The reaction of 9-bromoperylene monoimide 8 with 2-bromophenylboronic acid under Suzuki conditions affords product 24 in 85% yield (Scheme 7). Treatment of this mixture with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and a palladium catalyst (Pd(PPh3)2Cl2) promotes cyclisation to a five-membered ring, resulting in the indenoperylene monoimide 25 with a yield of 30%.14 Indenoperylene 25 has an absorption band with a maximum at 542 nm (a bathochromic shift of the absorbance maximum by 15 nm compared to 8, ε = 65000 M−1cm−1). This also shows the typical perylene vibronic structure, causing a violet appearance of the powder and a reddish-blue hue in solution. The fluorescence maximum of 25 is at 565 nm with ϕ = 11%.

2.2. Rylene diimides
Compared to rylene monoimides, rylene dimides have another imide group, which provides an additional electron-withdrawing effect and shifts absorption bathochromically. The synthesis of perylene diimides is shown in Scheme 1. The next two homologues, terrylene and quaterrylene diimides, are synthesised from monoimides, either by their coupling and subsequent dehydrogenation or by a “one-pot” process. Thus, PMI 14 is coupled with 4-bromonaphthalene monoimide via a Suzuki reaction to give dyad 26, which is cyclodehydrogenated with a base to give TDI 27 (Scheme 8). Alternatively, 27 can be obtained by direct fusion of PMI 7 and naphthalene monoimide (NMI) 28 under drastic conditions.2 The use of an excess of NMI avoids the formation of QDI; the TDI formed is separated from PDI by rinsing with ethanol using the difference in their solubilities.
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of terrylene diimides. 
Similarly, QDI 30 was prepared either by a two-step process via homocoupling of bromide 8 to bis-PMI 29 followed by cyclodehydrogenation under basic conditions, or by a one-pot direct fusion of two PMIs 7 under harsh basic conditions (Scheme 9).3
 Scheme 9  Synthesis of quaterrylene diimides. 
Two different construction concepts are used for the synthesis of the next two members of the rylene family, penta- and hexarylenediimides 32 and 33.4 The first one utilises the “nitronaphthalene method”: one nitronaphthalene unit is attached to a perylene monoimide, the bisaryl product is subsequently fused, and the nitro group is replaced by a halide to provide a halogen-substituted TMI 13 as a precursor (Scheme 3). This is then coupled with PMI-boronic ester to give PMI-TMI dyad 31 or dimerised with the formation of bis(terrylene monoimide) 32 (Scheme 10). These two precursors undergo cyclodehydrogenation to give the target dyes 33 and 34.
 Scheme 10  Synthesis of pentarylene and hexarylene diimides (nitronaphthalene method). 
The “dibromorylene method” (Scheme 11) is also used for the synthesis of 33 and 34. Two PMI 14 are coupled to a dibromonaphthalene or -perylene and fused in a two-step sequence (Scheme 10). Thus, triads 35–36 are oxidised to dyads 31 and 37 using iron(III) chloride as a mild oxidiser. Subsequently, the basic cyclodehydrogenation of these dyads affords the target penta- and hexarylene diimides 33–34.
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of pentarylene and hexarylene diimides (dibromorylene method). 
All rylene diimides possess excellent thermal, chemical and photochemical stabilities. Their absorption maxima are shifted bathochromically by ca. 100 nm per naphthalene unit, giving a bright orange, blue and green appearance for perylene 1, terrylene 27, and quaterrylene 30 diimides in solution, respectively. Interestingly, this phenomenon can also be found in acenes and polymethines. An almost identical bathochromic shift of the absorption maxima (about 100 nm) can be observed for each additional ring of homologues acenes or each additional vinylene of the homologues cyanine dyes.23 The higher rylenes, 33 and 34, are light green and light yellow in colour due to a weak residual absorption in the visible region. The absorption maximum of 33 lies at 877 nm and for 34 at 953 nm. When the entire rylenediimide series (perylenediimide 1 to hexarylenediimide 34) is examined, it is apparent that the energy of the absorption maximum decreases as the length of the π-system increases. Semi-empirical calculations show that in this series the LUMO level is affected only slightly, whereas the HOMO level rises.24 As a result of the extension of the aromatic π system along the molecular long axis, not only does a bathochromic shift become apparent but the molar absorptivities are also increased, with such high values as ε = 235000 M−1 cm−1 for the pentarylenediimide 33 and 293000 M−1 cm−1 for the hexarylenediimide 34. When these values are analysed for the whole series (Fig. 3a), a linear fit with the formula: ε = 60784n + 45674 can be made. Fig. 3b shows good agreement between the experimental values (squares) and the formula (line). Such a linear dependence makes it possible to predict approximate ε values for even higher homologues. Besides their strong absorptivities, some of the rylene diimides have extraordinary fluorescence. The fluorescence quantum yield of PDI 1 is quantitative, and going from PDI to TDI the fluorescence quantum yield remains almost unchanged (90% for 27). The emission maxima of TDI derivatives lie in the range from 670 to 710 nm depending on the substitution pattern in the bay-regions. However, QDI and its higher homologues rylene diimides lose their fluorescence dramatically. In the case of the tetraphenoxylated QDI the quantum yield drops to only 5% (em. max. 800 nm).

2.3. Perylene diamidine dyes
Extension of the aromatic π-system is achieved not only by homologous enlargement of the perylene core, but also via formation of additional heterocycles in the imide structure. Aromatic diamines with adjacent amino groups are reacted with perylene dianhydride 38 bearing four bulky phenoxy groups for better solubility (Scheme 12). As a result, perylene diamidine dyes 39a–c are isolated in high yields (72–88%) after column chromatography.25 Compared to the red starting compound 38, an extension of the aromatic system induces a dramatic bathochromic shift: the new dyes 39a–c have absorption maxima in the range of 629–659 nm, resulting in a blue appearance in solution. Compounds 39 are generated as a mixture of syn and anti isomers.
 Scheme 12  Synthesis of perylene diamidine dyes. 
Halogenation of aromatic chromophores is a known method of inducing a bathochromic shift of absorption.24 Bromination of 39b with an excess of NBS affords tetrabromide 39d (mixture of regioisomers), where bromination takes place only at the naphthalene subunits. The absorption maximum of 39d is at 712 nm, which is shifted to the red by 70 nm compared to parent 39b. Dyes 39 show high thermal and photochemical stability, which enable their blending with thermoplastics and, due to their emission, they are considered promising candidates for laser dyes.
2.4. Aminoanthraquinone-rylene dyes
A rylene-like π-system that includes heteroatoms is utilised in the well-known CI Vat Green dye 40, which can be synthesised from benzanthrone and aminoanthraquinone.26 To obtain more extended π-systems, two equivalents of the rylene monoimides 10a–b (bromo-substituted in the peri-position) are each coupled with 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone under Pd(PPh3)4 catalysed reaction (Scheme 13). After purification via crystallisation with the solvent mixture of dichloromethane and methanol, products 41a–b can be obtained in yields >75%. In the second step of the synthesis, the title compounds are formed by mild base-promoted cyclisation. This method provides the NIR absorbers 42a–b in high purities with yields >70%.5
 Scheme 13  Synthesis of aminoanthraquinone-rylene dyes. 
The absorption spectrum of the deep green dye 42a shows two absorption bands ((λmax (ε) = 440 nm (15800 M−1 cm−1) and 778 nm (15900 M−1 cm−1)). Compound 42b has a similar absorption profile (λmax (ε) = 618 nm (49500 M−1 cm−1) and 1106 nm (37500 M−1 cm−1) with the exception that the sharp band at λmax = 618 nm absorbs in the visible range of the spectrum and gives rise to a blue colour. The high wavelength bands of 42a–b are broad and almost structureless, as expected for charge-transfer transition. The photostability of 42a–b appears to be very high, as evidenced by the absorption spectra of their solutions which remain unchanged in sunlight after 4 weeks.
3. Core-expanded rylenes
3.1. Coronene diimides
Core-expansion in the perylene series includes annulation of carbo- and heterocycles in the bay-region of the perylene core.27 Coronene 43 can be regarded as a perylene with two additional ethylene units. Due to its limited accessibility, there have been few attempts to modify coronene dyes chemically.28 A simple two-step approach to coronene diimides 45 from dibromoperylene diimides 4 has been described only recently.29
 Scheme 14  Synthesis of coronene diimides. 
The palladium(0)-catalysed reactions of 4 with 1-alkynes in the presence of a base (triethylamine) afford the expected bis(alkynyl)-substituted perylene diimides 44 in high yields (85–95%; Scheme 14). Treatment of 44 with strong non-nucleophilic bases (such as DBU) triggers a cyclisation reaction to yield almost quantitatively the yellow title compounds 45 with various R′ substituents. Coronene diimides (CDI) 45 fluoresce with an intense green-yellow colour (the absorption maximum is 517 nm in CHCl3).The absorption bands of 45 show a hypsochromic shift with respect to those of 4 and a bathochromic shift with respect to those of 43. The calculated frontier orbitals of coronene diimides already show that CDI cannot be regarded as a simple analogue of rylene diimides.23 The formal fusion of a perylene diimide with two ethylenes in the bay-region leads to a totally different appearance of the HOMO orbital coefficients of CDI compared to PDI, whereas the LUMO of the CDI matches that of the PDI. Regarding the orbitals of the pure hydrocarbon coronene, it becomes obvious that the HOMO of the CDI is comparable to the HOMO of the hydrocarbon coronene. The absorption behaviour of CDI is thus a result of a mixture of perylene diimide- and coronene-like orbitals: the band at 511 nm, corresponding to the HOMO–LUMO transition according to the calculation, is therefore caused by a transition from a coronene-like HOMO to a perylene-like LUMO. The second band at 429 nm shows the typical vibronic fine structure of perylene diimides, as this band is related to the transition between the perylene-like next HOMO (NHOMO) and the perylene-like LUMO.26 The theoretical calculations clearly reproduce the hypsochromically shifted absorption, as the energy value of the HOMO of the CDI is lower compared to PDI, whereas the LUMO-energy is increased, thus leading to a larger HOMO–LUMO gap.
3.2. Dibenzocoronene diimides
Further expansion of a perylene core from coronene to dibenzocoronene dyes is achieved as follows. The reaction of 1,7-dibromoperylene diimide 4 with 2-bromophenylboronic acid under Suzuki conditions affords 46 in 53% yield (Scheme 15). Intramolecular reaction of 2-bromophenylboronic acid is not known under these conditions.30 Mono- or di-debrominated products of 46 are observed in minor amounts (ca. 10%), but this mixture is directly used successfully for the next step, in which palladium-catalysed dehydrohalogenation31 with DBU in dimethyl acetamide (DMA) furnishes dibenzocoronene diimide 47 in 46% yield.
 Scheme 15  Synthesis of dibenzocoronene diimide. 
The appeal of these new yellow chromophores is slightly diminished by the moderate yields during their syntheses. The procedure is simplified by the core-extension of the bay-region of PDI via a one-step Diels–Alder cycloaddition.32 An effective route for the benzannulation of 2-halobiaryls, using an in situ generation of arynes, has recently been described.33 This reaction is successfully applied to the synthesis of carbo- and heterocyclic aromatic molecules in good yields. The bay-region of PDI 4 is synthetically equivalent to the 2-halobiaryls. The reaction of the commercially available 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and N,N′-dioctyl-1,7-dibromoperylene diimide 8b26 under the conditions described above29 affords dibenzocoronene diimide 47b in high yield (80%) as a light-brown solid. Product 47c is precipitated almost quantitatively from the reaction mixture upon cooling to room temperature, which opens the possibility for industrial production of dye 47, since the precursor 4 is readily accessible.17,26
Both coronene derivatives 45 and 47 are soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, or toluene. In the region of shorter wavelengths (up to 400 nm) the spectrum of the dibenzocoronene dye 47 shows a sharp band at 349 nm, whereas the band in the spectrum of 45 is broad with a maximum absorbance of 338 nm (Fig. 4). Only one band with the typical perylene vibronic structure is seen at longer wavelengths with an absorbance maximum at 494 nm (ε = 66000 M−1 cm−1), giving rise to a yellow colour. The yellow solution of dibenzo CDI 47a appears brighter and greener than that of the CDI 45, owing to the lack of absorbance above 515 nm for 47. The value of ε for 47 at 494 nm is similar to that of 45 at 428 nm (ε = 62000 M−1 cm−1).26 Dibenzocoronene diimides 47a-b have a bright fluorescence with a quantum yield of 80%, a high value compared to other yellow fluorophores, e.g. acridine yellow, which has a fluorescence quantum yield of 47%.
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of coronene diimides 45 (dashed line), dibenzocoronene diimides 47 (solid line) and PDI 1 (dotted line). 
3.3. Dinaphthoquaterrylene diimides
Quaterrylene diimides (QDIs) are known as green NIR dyes with high thermal and photochemical stabilities as well as high molar absorptivities.3 However, both their fluorescence quantum yields and solubilities are quite low. An increase of solubility is achieved by bromination in the bay-region and subsequent phenoxylation of the bromides.2 Bromination of QDI 30 with an excess of molecular bromine affords the six-fold brominated product 48 (Scheme 16). Hexabromide 48 possesses an enhanced solubility compared to 30 but a lower photochemical stability. Only bromides closest to the imide positions are substituted with the phenoxy groups upon phenoxylation. The two “inner” bromides do not react even after long reaction times and drastic conditions. Quaterrylene dye 49 is synthetically analogous to the PDIs 4; therefore, the bromides are suitable for the palladium-promoted benzannulation. The core expansion of 49 under the same conditions as 4 affords core-modified QDI 50 in a 46% yield.31
 Scheme 16  Synthesis of dinaphthoquaterrylene diimides. 
A comparison of the absorption spectra of the newly synthesised dinaphthoQDI 50 and its precursor 49 (Fig. 5) shows a significant hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum (from 758 to 700 nm). This phenomenon is accompanied by a blue-green appearance in solution (chloroform, toluene). The value of the extinction coefficient is lower than that of the precursor but still remains high (ε = 143000 M−1 cm−1). The calculated orbitals of the new dibenzocoronene and dinaphthoquaterrylene derivatives are similar to those of the corresponding rylenes, showing a similar UV absorption behaviour with only one main band.30 The determined HOMO–LUMO band gaps of 47 and 50 are slightly increased compared to the perylene and quaterrylene diimides, respectively, causing a hypsochromic shift in absorption, in good agreement with the experimental data. Dinaphthoquaterrylene diimides 50 display a strong emission with a maximum at 726 nm and a quantum yield of 40%.

3.4. Dibenzopentarylene diimides
By enlargement of perylene diimides along the short molecular axis, two types of molecules can be obtained. Whereas the absorption of coronene- and dibenzocoronene diimides, reported above, is hypsochromically shifted compared to that for parent perylene dyes,31 the introduction of an acene structure into the rylene moiety causes a significant bathochromic shift. Thus, the absorption of dibenzoterrylene 51 and 1,2:7,8-dibenzoPDI 52 is shifted bathochromically by 180 nm,34,35 in comparison to terrylene (λmax = 560 nm) and PDI 1, respectively.  
Novel NIR dyes dibenzopentarylene diimides (54) possess a similar topology to 51. The synthetic strategy towards 54 utilises a 2 + 1 + 2 principle:4 this includes the synthesis of a perylene—tetracene—perylene triad followed by a two-step cyclodehydrogenation. The reaction of 5,11-dibromotetracene with PMI boronic esters 14 under Suzuki conditions affords bis-PMI-tetracene triads 53 (Scheme 17). The cyclisation of 53 to 54 is achieved under mild conditions in a two-step process. The first cyclisation is performed with FeCl3/nitromethane in CH2Cl2 at room temperature; the second one is a base-promoted reaction with K2CO3/ethanolamine. This method provides 54 in an overall yield of 54–58%.36
 Scheme 17  Synthesis of dibenzopentarylene diimides. 
The optimisation of the geometry using semi-empirical calculations23 shows that 54 is strongly twisted due to the steric repulsion of hydrogen atoms (Fig. 6a).35 The deviation from the molecular planarity increases the HOMO level and lowers the LUMO level.37 Narrowing the HOMO–LUMO gap leads to a bathochromically shifted absorption maximum. The optical spectrum of 54 (Fig. 6b) shows two absorption bands at 560 and 1018 nm. A comparison of the NIR absorbance of dye 54 (λmax = 1037 nm) and pentarylene diimides (33, λmax = 877 nm)4 reveals a bathochromic shift of 160 nm. Only the band at 560 nm absorbs in the visible range that causes the violet colour of the dye in solution. These wavelengths are in the range of the emission spectrum of Nd-YAG laser, which enables the use of 54 as NIR dye for the laser welding of thermoplastics. According to thermogravimetric analysis, NIR dye 54 is thermally stable up to 330 °C. This is important for using it as an NIR absorber and blending with thermoplastics during processing.

4. Multichromophoric systems based on rylene dyes
Because of the significant overlap of the PDI emission spectrum with the TDI absorption spectrum, these dyes are chosen for the creation of bi- and multichromophoric systems to study the energy and electron transfer between two chromophores. The distance between chromophores is varied by the nature of the spacer.38  
Another approach for the multichromophore design involves polyphenylene dendrimers, where highly twisted pentaphenyl units form a photochemically inert and shape-persistent dendritic scaffold around the energy acceptor molecule, which is decorated by donor molecules on the surface. Dendritic multichromophores like 56, which have four PMI units, are able to collect energy from the absorption range of PMI and transfer it to the central TDI chromophore. This method indicates a useful way to enlarge the spectral range of the dyes for photovoltaic applications.39  
In the more complex system 57, naphthalene and perylene chromophores decorate a polyphenylene shell around the central TDI core. This multichromophore absorbs over the whole range of the visible spectrum but shows an emission only from the central TDI chromophore due to efficient energy transfer.40
5. Single molecule spectroscopy (SMS) and biolabelling with rylene dyes
In contrast to ensemble measurements studying average properties, an investigation of single molecules provides information on individual units, such as distributions and time trajectories, that would otherwise be hidden.41 In this way, static disorder or dynamic disorder of individual molecules can be detected, which is not possible by averaging the observable in a bulk system. A good fluorophore for such experiments combines a high absorption coefficient, a high fluorescence quantum yield and good chemical and photochemical stabilities. Photobleaching severely limits the observation time and thus the amount of collected information during the experiment. Since PDI and TDI dyes do not undergo photobleaching, they have been established as key chromophores for SMS. Investigation of the amino-functionalised PMI 18 in a polystyrene matrix reveals different conformations of the amine group relative to the chromophore. Furthermore, transitions between these spectrally defined conformers can be detected in real time.42 For tetraphenoxy-substituted PDI, SMS shows conformational changes of the bay substituents which are related to twisting of the single molecule around the central PDI long axis.43 Besides detecting intrinsic changes within the perylene chromophores, these dyes can also be used to probe their polymeric environment, e.g. in measuring the free volume of polymers.44 In addition to single chromophores, multichromophoric systems are also investigated on the single molecule level.45
Single molecule spectroscopy is becoming a powerful tool for the study of biomolecules in an aqueous environment.46 The use of common commercial dyes for this purpose is often accompanied by their fast photobleaching. Since perylene and terrylene imides possess extraordinary photostability,6 they attract increasing attention for SMS study. Monofunctional rylene dyes are used for non-selective labeling of amino groups in proteins using isothiocyanate or N-hydroxysuccinimide esters.47 Any free amine in the protein chain can be labelled by these monofunctional rylenes. For site-specific labeling, a maleimide group is used.42–48 It can react with any thiol unit of cystein, either terminal or internal. In contrast, native chemical ligation can bind only terminal cystein groups.43 Water-soluble PDI dyes are functionalised with a nitrilotriacetic acid moiety, which can bind to an HIS-tagged protein.49 An important feature of this label is the unchanged emission of the dye upon complexation with nickel ions. Rylene dyes are also used as energy acceptors for a natural light-harvesting complex. Thus, maleimide-functionalised benzoylterrylene imide 58 is bound to LHCII (light-harvesting complex II) via a thiol and serves as an efficient acceptor of energy from chlorophyll.50  
6. NIR-absorbing rylene dyes as heat blockers
Heat-protection glazing with higher rylene additives consists of two glass panes mechanically joined together by a thin plastic film containing the NIR absorber.51 While visible light is able to pass almost unhindered through the sandwich structure of the glazing, most of the NIR radiation from the incoming sunlight is absorbed by the film and converted into heat. The heat is transported to the external surface via conventional heat conduction and carried away by the flowing air. Since the speed of the air flow outside is much higher than inside, only small amounts of heat reach the interior and contribute to unwanted warming52 with applications in car windscreens, architectural glasses, and agricultural films. QDI 30 and its tetraphenoxy derivatives represent useful dyes for this purpose due to their high thermal and photostability, as well as their high molar absorptivity.53
7. Laser welding and laser marking using rylene dyes
Laser marking is a thermographic process which uses a laser as a heat source for the inscription of polymeric matrices.54 The thermochromic dye 20 and the NIR absorber 42b are incorporated into a polystyrene matrix. Heating with a Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) leads to the decomposition of 45 accompanied by the expected colour change. Laser welding was first demonstrated on thermoplastics in the 1970s but has only recently found a place in industrial scale applications.47 This technique, suitable for joining sheets, films and moulded thermoplastics, uses a laser beam to melt the plastic in the joint region. The degree of energy absorption at the Nd:YAG laser wavelength (1064 nm, 1.2eV photon energy) depends largely on the presence of additives in the plastics, e.g. pigments absorbing at this wavelength. Another requirement for the use of NIR dyes in laser welding is high thermal stability during thermal formation of plastic details and their welding. Dyes 34, 42b, and 54 are suitable for this application since they fit all these requirements.21
8. Rylene dyes in organic photovoltaics
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs), which utilise organic semiconductors to harvest energy directly from sunlight, have gained tremendous academic and industrial interest due to the significant cost reduction via the processing ability of organic materials.55 There are three main kinds of organic photovoltaics: molecule,56 polymer,57 and hybrid58 solar cells. Molecule solar cells are normally fabricated from small molecules in a bi-layer structure, for example, C60 as acceptor and phthalocyanine as donor. The active layers in the polymer cells are typically spin-coated from a mixed solution of conjugated polymers with acceptor molecules, such as polythiophene as donor with fullerene as acceptor. In hybrid photovoltaic devices, however, both organic and inorganic materials are used as active materials. Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs), where the electrons are injected from excited dyes to the inorganic semiconductors (such as TiO2) and the oxidised dyes can later be reduced by electrolyte or hole-transport materials, are considered the most representative hybrid solar cells in terms of their high power conversion efficiency of up to 11%.59
The use of perylene dyes for organic solar cells can be traced back to the organic photovoltaic cell fabricated by Tang, where phthalocyanine and perylene bisamidine derivatives (59) are used as active materials with a reasonable power conversion efficiency of up to 1%.60 Their tunable solubility and the controlled optical and electrochemical properties upon functionalisation make perylene dyes useful for all kinds of organic solar cells.61
  
Very many studies62 have been devoted to improving photovoltaic performance by using different derivatives of perylenes (59–61) and metal phthalocyanines. However, the highest efficiency reported so far for this kind of cell is 2%, which is too low for practical applications.
Perylene dyes can also be used in solution-processable molecular OPVs, where the soluble perylene compound 62 is used as the acceptor63 and discotic liquid crystalline hexaphenyl-substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC) as the donor. Compound 62 and HBC are self-organisable and can form a bulk heterojunction with superior morphology. This provides a high degree of ordering and a donor–acceptor phase separation necessary for increasing the transfer integral between adjacent molecules relative to that in an amorphous material. Additionally, perylene 62-based devices give a much higher efficiency of 0.6% (in polycarbazole polymer solar cells) compared to fullerene/polycarbazole-based solar cells. Because of the high absorptivities, the light-harvesting ability in the perylene-containing devices is improved by perylene 62 compared to that in the fullerene cells.64
Containing anhydrides or carboxy-substituted imides, perylene dyes can be easily attached to inorganic semiconductors, such as TiO2 or ZnO. With these anchoring groups, perylene dyes are utilised as sensitisers in dye-sensitised solar cells.65 By varying the bay and peri groups, a series of perylene dyes with a rainbow of colours is synthesised. Their absorption overlaps the whole visible region up to the infrared at 1100 nm.66 Additionally, anhydride-functionalised perylenes 68 and 69 are produced. With two additional thiophenyl groups in the bay, the DSCs of 69 show 87% incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and 6.8% power conversion efficiency under the standard AM 1.5 solar conditions. Up to now, these perylene photovoltaic devices have shown the best efficiencies among perylene-sensitised solar cells.67  
9. Rylene dyes in organic field-effect transistors
Due to the large π-electron system and strong electron affinity, perylene dyes are one of the most important n-type materials in the organic field-effect transistor (OFET) field. The first PDI OFET device (PDI 70) was built by Horowitz in 1996.68 When the imide substitutions are varied, PDIs give varying OFET performance. Remarkable electron mobilities (up to 2.1 cm2V−1s−1) are achieved with PDI 71.69 There is another pathway to change the OFET behaviour of PDIs due to the simple functionalisation of PDIs in the bay-position. PDI 72 and PDI 73 have lower LUMO energies than normal PDI without bay groups.70 Devices based on these two PDIs show outstanding air stability. The favourable LUMO energies help these dyes to avoid oxidation of the negative charge carriers by oxygen. In order to investigate the π-size effect, solution-processable OFETs based on swallow-tailed QDI 74 are fabricated.71 An interesting ambipolarity is demonstrated. Surprisingly, the hole conduction is lost after thermal treatment, which affects the morphology and improves the ordering of dye molecules. In this case, the absence of n-type behaviour is not due to the increase of hole injection barrier or the interface trapping, but mainly determined by the morphology.  
10. Conclusions and outlook
During the last few years, perylene dyes and their derivatives have found a broad range of applications due to not only their various simple syntheses and their tunable solubility, but also to their optical and electrochemical properties, which allow perylenes to be used as colourants and as functional dyes for many other purposes.
In this article, we have presented a summary of our recent results based on the core-enlarged perylene dyes. Perylene dyes can be functionalised: 1) by different imides to produce solubility and self-assembling ability. An ambipolar behaviour has been observed in OFET devices made from swallow-tailed QDI, which has two more naphthalene units than perylene; 2) by donor/acceptor substituents in bay/peri-positions to produce different colours and also various energy levels. With these aspects, D/A-substituted perylenes are useful in organic photovoltaics, and outstanding power efficiencies have been achieved; 3) by core-extension to give large π-systems at peri-positions (along the long axis). A homologous series of the rylene diimides up to the hexarylene consisting of six naphthalene units connected via their peri-positions has been synthesised, presenting strong absorption in the NIR region; 4) by core-expansion to form large π-systems at bay-positions (along the short axis). For example, dinaphthoQDI 50 shows a much higher fluorescence quantum yield than QDI. The outstanding stability of dinaphthoQDIs makes them reliable candidates for red-absorbing fluorophores, bio-applications, and SMS.
In the future, core-enlarged perylene dyes will be further investigated in biological systems, OPVs, OFETs and in the NIR field. In order to improve OPV and OFET performances based on the structure design principle described in this paper, the synthesis of new core-enlarged perylene dyes remains our challenge.
