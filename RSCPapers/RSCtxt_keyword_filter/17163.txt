The ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites displayed clear shifts in the plasmonic absorption band and in the binding energy of the gold relative to the pure gold NWs. A bulk heterojunction solar cell using the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites displayed a good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.12%, and a short circuit current density and fill factor that were significantly better than those of a reference cell prepared using ThCBM without Au NWs (with a PCE of 2.67%). The electron mobility in an electron-only device prepared using the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites was significantly higher (by 35% or more) than the electron mobility in a device prepared with pure ThCBM. In conclusion, the hybrid composites proposed here, i.e., ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites, provide a promising approach to improving the performance of bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells via improved electron transfer through the metallic nanowires as well as by enhanced ordering among the fullerenes assembled along the longitudinal axes of the gold nanowires.
Introduction
There is a critical need in the field of photovoltaics to improve charge transfer in high-performance bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, which are photovoltaic devices that efficiently separate excitons using optimized interfaces between an electron donor (e.g., poly(3-hexylthiophene); P3HT) and an electron acceptor (e.g., phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester; PCBM).1–4 The rate of charge transfer is generally limited in organic semiconductors because of a low charge mobility and the formation of randomly interpenetrating networks of organic materials in the BHJ solar cells.5–9 Charge transfer in this type of photovoltaics may be enhanced by improving the crystallinity of the organic semiconductors which can be achieved by controlling the growth rate in the active layer,10,11 by using various inorganic nanostructures for inorganic–organic hybrid-type solar cells,12 or by synthesizing conjugated P3HT polymers to form one-dimensional anisotropic morphologies that provide optimal charge transport pathways.13
Inorganic–organic hybrid nanocomposites have been constructed recently as a strategy for overcoming the limitations associated with organic semiconductors by taking advantage of certain synergistic effects that result from incorporating inorganic nanostructures into the organic semiconductor networks. For example, nanocrystals have been connected to the functionalized end-groups of polymers,14 the oligothiophene dendrons are hybridized with CdSe and Au nanoparticles by ligand exchange or direct synthesis,15 and CdS or Ag nanoparticles have been coated with polymers using evaporative assembly or electrodeposition.16 A hybrid nanocomposite comprising poly(N-vinylcarbazole) and CdS quantum dots was developed to obtain high charge carrier transport,17 and several methods were reported for forming quantum dot or rod-P3HT nanocomposites by using ligand exchange, direct grafting like Heck coupling, or click chemistry.18–22 These studies were primarily concerned with hybrid nanocomposites composed of n-type semiconductor nanostructures connected to p-type conjugated polymers.
In this paper, we report a novel hybrid nanocomposite assembly composed of metallic gold nanowires (Au NWs) and thienyl-derivative fullerenes of thienyl-C61-butyric acid methyl esters (abbreviated ThCBM). One-dimensional nanostructures such as the gold nanowires used in this study are outstanding charge transporters because of their anisotropic morphologies.23–31 These nanostructures can form inorganic–organic nanocomposites with fullerenes that can display ordering along the longitudinal axes of the metallic nanowires. Since thiols readily adsorb onto Au(111) surfaces,32 the ThCBM is one of the best candidates for making the hybrid nanocomposite. We used this property to attach n-type ThCBM semiconductors to the Au(111) surfaces of our gold nanowires. The ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposite assembly was used in the preparation of a BHJ solar cell that yielded a photovoltaic performance at least 17% higher than that of a reference cell prepared using pure ThCBM. The improved performance resulted from a more than 35% enhancement in the electron mobility. Few previous studies have utilized hybrid nanocomposites containing thienyl-derivative fullerenes adsorbed and assembled along the metallic nanowires for enhancing the photovoltaic performance.
Experimental
Synthesis and characterization of Au NWs
The metallic gold nanowires were synthesized using the electrodeposition method with a track-etched polycarbonate nanotemplate (GE Water & Progress Tech.). A three-electrode system was established using a copper foil attached to the nanotemplates as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and a Pt wire as a counter electrode. An electrolyte containing Au ions was obtained from the OROMERSE SO Part B Gold Replenisher. A reduction potential of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied to the working electrode, and the gold nanowires were synthesized within the nanotemplate attached to the copper foil. The organic nanotemplates that filled in the gold nanowires were repeatedly removed using a dichloromethane solvent. The microstructural properties of the metallic gold nanowires were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL-JSN7500F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100), and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Rotalflex RU-200B) with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5405 Å).
Formation and characterization of ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites
Hybrid nanocomposites composed of the Au NWs and n-type ThCBM were prepared by producing a well-dispersed Au NW solution via sonication in 1,2-dichlorobenzene for 3 h. ThCBM was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The dispersed gold nanowires were added to the ThCBM solution by pipetting, and the mixed solution was then stirred for more than 24 h to allow the ThCBM to adsorb onto the Au(111) surfaces of the gold nanowires. The absorption spectra of the pure Au NWs, ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs, and pure ThCBM were obtained from dilute solutions, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Multilab 2000) was used to observe the Au 4f binding energy for the pure Au NWs and the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs.
Measurements of the photovoltaic performance and electron mobility of the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites
During the preparation of the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW solution mentioned above, the P3HT dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was added to the solution to form a P3HT:ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW photoactive layer. The weight ratio was 1:0.5 P3HT:ThCBM, and the BHJ solar cells were fabricated as follows: PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P, AI 4083) was spin-cast to a thickness of approximately 30 nm onto a clean ITO substrate treated with O2 plasma, and the ITO substrate was then annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes. A P3HT:ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW layer was spin-cast onto the ITO/PEDOT substrate at 700 rpm for 60 s, and the growth rate of the layer was controlled using a small capped jar to prevent rapid solvent evaporation and to assist with the N2 gas penetration. The post-annealing process was performed at 150 °C for 10 min. Prior to deposition of a metal electrode (Al, 100 nm thickness) by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<10−6 Torr), Ca (20 nm thickness) was evaporated as a buffer layer. The J–V characteristics of the BHJ solar cells with an electrode area of 0.0475 cm2 were determined using a Keithley 2611 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in a N2-filled glovebox. The light intensity was calibrated using reference silicon solar cells certificated by the National Institute of Science and Technology. The electron-only devices were fabricated using ITO/PEDOT/ThCBM/LiF/Al and ITO/PEDOT/ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW/LiF/Al structures, and the J–V characteristics were evaluated under dark conditions to calculate the electron mobilities using the Mott–Gurney equation.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 describes the process utilized in this work to prepare a photoactive solution of P3HT:ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs. The gold nanowires were synthesized using an electrodeposition method that preferentially yielded Au(111) surfaces. ThCBM with thiol functional groups, which could facilitate adsorption onto the Au(111) surfaces of metallic gold nanowires through the Au–S coordinative interaction,32 was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene to form a hybrid nanocomposite assembly of ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs. P3HT polymers were then added to the solution containing the nanocomposites to yield a photoactive solution of P3HT:ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs for use in preparing the BHJ solar cells.

The metallic gold nanowires were synthesized by electrodeposition using track-etched polycarbonate nanotemplates, as described in detail in the Experimental section. The nanowires, therefore, were characterized by uniform dimensions with an average diameter of approximately 50 nm, and the length of the gold nanowires was approximately 1 μm, as shown in the scanning electron microscopy image of Fig. 2a. The transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 2b shows the anisotropic morphology of a single Au NW, and the high-resolution TEM image of Fig. 2c reveals that the Au(111) facets had a d-spacing value of 2.35 Å. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shown in Fig. 2d reveals that Au(111) facets were preferentially formed on the gold nanowires, which were highly crystalline and had a face-centered cubic structure.

The gold nanowires used in this work exhibited a sole transverse surface plasmon absorption band at 542 nm in the absorption spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3a and b, caused by the (111)-directed growth and the high aspect ratio of the gold nanowires.33 This spectrum differed from the results of earlier studies of anisotropic gold nanowires, which reported both longitudinal and transverse plasmon absorption bands.34 In this work, the gold nanowires were dispersed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene by sonication for more than 3 h, followed by mixing with ThCBM at room temperature for more than 24 h to allow the sulfur functionalities of the ThCBM to adsorb onto the Au(111) surfaces of the gold nanowires. Adsorption to the nanocomposite assembly via Au–S interactions was confirmed by comparing the absorption spectra and the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs and a control sample of pure Au NWs, as shown in Fig. 3. The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 3a revealed a shift in the plasmon absorption band of the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs toward a lower wavelength, 532 nm, compared with the absorption band at 542 nm for the pure Au NWs, and absorption in the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs was dampened. This redshift and the reduced absorption coefficient were associated with the ThCBM surface modification of the gold nanowires, similar to the effects observed due to the formation of self-assembled thiols on Au(111) films.35–37 Note that Au NWs blended with PCBM did not exhibit such a shift in the surface plasmon absorption band, as shown in Fig. 3b, suggesting that the PCBMs could not interact with the Au NWs. The Au–S bonds in the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs were examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 3c. The Au 4f7/2 binding energy (BE) values for the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs and the pure Au NWs are summarized in Table S1 of ESI.† Whereas the Au 4f7/2 BE value of the pure Au NWs was 83.77 eV, similar to the value reported previously for Au films,38,39 the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs in the nanocomposites yielded a Au 4f7/2 BE of 83.94 eV. This positive shift in the BE indicated that the Au NWs in the nanocomposites were slightly oxidized relative to the pure Au NWs. We therefore concluded that the sulfur functionalities of the ThCBM groups were adsorbed onto the Au(111) surfaces of the metallic gold nanowires, and the Au–S interactions resulted in a change in the electronic states of the gold nanowires.

The photovoltaic performances of our ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites were investigated in BHJ solar cells, fabricated using the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Ca/Al, as described in the Experimental section and illustrated in the schematic diagram of Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b presents the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) profiles of the BHJ solar cells prepared from photoactive layers consisting of P3HT:ThCBM, P3HT:ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs, or P3HT:ThCBM:Au NWs and characterized under an AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The reference device prepared with P3HT:ThCBM displayed a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.86 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 63.9% with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.67%. The solar cell fabricated using P3HT:ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs displayed higher photovoltaic parameters, including a Jsc of 7.66 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.2%. These increases were attributed to reduced recombination among the charge carriers.40,41 The higher Jsc and FF values improved the PCE to 3.12%. The solar cell based on P3HT:ThCBM:Au NWs was prepared by immediately blending a solution containing P3HT, ThCBM, and the Au NWs to avoid adsorption between the ThCBM groups and the gold nanowires. In this controlled experiment, we did not observe any noticeable improvement in the PCE, and the fill factor decreased slightly. In summary, Au NWs without ThCBM surface functionalization did not yield improved photovoltaic properties in BHJ solar cells. The photovoltaic parameters of the BHJ solar cell prepared using P3HT:ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs were further examined as a function of the concentration of gold nanowires, which varied the concentration of the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites in the active layer (see Table S2†). Interestingly, the solar cell fabricated with Au NWs at a concentration of approximately 1 × 108 mL−1 exhibited the highest PCE under these conditions. The presence of metallic gold nanowires did not change the electrical properties of the BHJ solar cell, as shown in the dark J–V characteristics of Fig. S2.† The characteristics of these BHJ solar cells demonstrated that the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites improved the photovoltaic performances of BHJ solar cells if their surfaces were functionalized with adsorbed ThCBM. The TEM and SEM images in Fig. S3† show the presence of gold nanowires in the photoactive layers of the BHJ solar cells. Also, the Au NWs having 200 nm length showed much lower photovoltaic parameters of Jsc (6.63 mA cm−2) and FF (54.9%) than those with 1 μm length in the BHJ solar cells, as shown in Fig. S2.† It means that the longer Au NWs are more effective in enhancing the charge transport feature and improving the photovoltaic parameters.

The enhancement in electron transfer from the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites was demonstrated by calculating the electron mobilities in the electron-only devices fabricated in either of two configurations: (1) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ThCBM/LiF/Al or (2) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW/LiF/Al. The J–V characteristics of the electron-only devices were measured under dark conditions. The J–V curves of both electron-only devices were consistent with space-charge-limited current behavior, as shown in Fig. 5, because the current density was quadratically dependent on the effective voltage (V − Vbi − VRs).5–8,13,42 Accordingly, the electron mobilities of the electron-only devices could be calculated according to the Mott–Gurney law: (1)where εr is the permittivity of the ThCBM, which is known to be 3.9 and is similar to that of PCBM,37 and L is the thickness of the layers. These parameters, along with eqn (1), permitted the electron mobilities (μe) to be calculated from the slopes of the J–V curves. The electron mobility of the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites was significantly enhanced, by 35%, to 6.6 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1, compared with 4.9 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1 for the electron-only device prepared using ThCBM. The enhancement in the electron mobility in the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs was attributed to the presence of metallic gold nanowires and the possible arrangement of fullerenes along the longitudinal axes of the nanowires. The substantial increase in the electron mobility of the hybrid nanocomposites was responsible for the significant improvements in the photovoltaic performances of the BHJ solar cells. Fig. S4 in the ESI† presents an energy band diagram for the BHJ solar cell prepared using the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW nanocomposites, showing the facilitated electron transfer by the hybrid nanocomposite assembly in the photoactive layer of the BHJ solar cells. This work suggests that an inorganic–organic nanomaterial assembly can be formed from our strategy presented here, which could improve the performance of electronic or energy devices.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel hybrid nanocomposite assembly composed of metallic gold nanowires and thienyl-derivative fullerenes was successfully constructed for use in photovoltaic applications. The gold nanowires within the hybrid nanocomposites displayed shifts in the absorption band and binding energy due to the coordinate bonds between the sulfur functionalities of the ThCBM groups and the Au(111) surfaces of the gold nanowires. The PCE of a BHJ solar cell prepared using the ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs was 3.12% and displayed high Jsc and FF values. The improved photovoltaic performance was attributed to the enhanced electron transfer, with an approximately 35% increase in the electron mobility. The ThCBM-adsorbed Au NW hybrid nanocomposites facilitated electron transfer from the metallic gold nanowires due to the presence of the ordered fullerene moieties assembled along the longitudinal axes of the metallic nanowires. In this study, we demonstrated that a hybrid nanocomposite assembly of ThCBM-adsorbed Au NWs provided a promising approach to overcoming certain limitations on BHJ solar cell photovoltaic performance via (1) easy and reliable formation of inorganic–organic hybrid nanocomposites, and (2) facilitation of charge transfer in the solar cells.
