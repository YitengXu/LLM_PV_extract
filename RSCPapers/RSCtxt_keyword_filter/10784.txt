    , Accepted 26th July 2020First published on 27th July 2020AbstractIn a short period of time, the rapid development of perovskite solar cells attracted a lot of attention in the science community with the record for power conversion efficiency being broken every year. Despite the fast progress in power conversion efficiency there are still many issues that need to be solved before starting large scale commercial applications, such as, among others, the difficult and costly synthesis and usage of toxic solvents for the deposition of hole transport materials (HTMs). We herein report new enamine-based charge transport materials obtained via a simple one step synthesis procedure, from commercially available precursors and without the use of expensive organometallic catalysts. The developed materials demonstrated rapid loss of mass during thermogravimetry analysis suggesting that they could be processed not only using solution processing but also via vacuum deposition. Furthermore, all HTMs demonstrated high charge carrier mobility with H2 possessing the highest mobility of 2.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 under strong electric fields. The investigated materials were employed in vacuum-deposited p–i–n perovskite solar cells and champion devices with enamine H2 demonstrate a PCE of 18.4%.
Introduction
The growth of human population and the technological progress in the last hundred years have dramatically increased global energy consumption.1 With limited fossil fuel resources and the overall rise in pollution, renewable energy sources have become an attractive alternative. One of the most promising alternatives is photovoltaic devices. In recent years the field of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has attracted large attention mostly due to the easily tuneable band gap of the perovskite,2 relatively simple device fabrication3,4 and the continuously increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE) with the current record being 25.2%.5 PSCs can be fabricated in two configurations, n–i–p or p–i–n, identified depending on the type of charge selective layer which is deposited onto the front transparent contact (in n–i–p and p–i–n, n- and p-type layers are used as the front contact, respectively). n–i–p devices usually use compact or mesoporous TiO2 or SnO2 (ref. 6–9) as the electron transport layer (ETL), deposited on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates. On top of the ETL, the perovskite, a hole transport layer (HTL) and a metal cathode are subsequently deposited.10 The main architectural differences between p–i–n and n–i–p PSCs are the materials used as the ETL and HTL as well as the order in which they are deposited.11
p–i–n PSCs have several advantages compared to n–i–p devices: (i) the high temperature needed for TiO2 annealing is avoided; (ii) low-cost copper can be used as the cathode instead of silver or gold;12 (iii) the p–i–n architecture enables higher PCE potential in tandem cells due to lower parasitic absorption in the front contact.13,14
Currently some of the most widely used hole transport materials (HTMs) for p–i–n PSCs are (semi)conducting polymers such as poly-TPDs,15,16 PTAA,17,18 PEDOT:PSS15,19 and metal oxides such as CuOx20,21 and NiOx.20,22 The aforementioned organic compounds are often deposited using the spin-coating technique, which is costwise quite inefficient and not suitable for large-scale fabrication. As an alternative, perovskite solar cells can be fabricated by vacuum deposition, which is widely used in the industry and hence suitable to scale up the device preparation. Moreover, it avoids use of toxic solvents which are usually employed in the fabrication of PSCs23 and allows more accurate control of the processing of multilayer stacks.24 However, its application is limited to relatively small molecules as they need to be sublimed.25 Herein new enamine-based HTMs were synthesized in a simple single step reaction from commercially available materials without the use of expensive transition metal catalysts. The compounds were synthesized in order to have a relatively large ionization energy, which should match that of the perovskite absorber to ensure efficient hole extraction. The HTMs exhibited high thermal stability and large carrier drift mobility, reaching 2.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (H2) at strong electric fields. All materials were tested in fully vacuum-processed p–i–n PSCs, showing performance comparable to state-of-the-art evaporated devices.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Synthesis of enamines H1, H2, H3 and H4 was conducted using a single-step acid catalysed condensation reaction. Carbazole was condensed with diphenylacetaldehyde using camphor-10-sulfonic acid (β) (CSA) as a catalyst in toluene to give enamine H1 (Scheme 1). The same reaction conditions were applied in the case of m-tolidine to obtain H3 as the desired product.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of enamines H1, H2, H3 and H4. 
Enamines H2 and H4 were synthesized by the same type of one step condensation reaction of aniline or 1,1-bis(4-aminophenyl)cyclohexane with diphenylacetaldehyde utilizing CSA, although in this case THF was used as the solvent instead of toluene (Scheme 1). The mechanisms for the above-mentioned reactions were reported in earlier publications.26,27
After performing the extraction, H1 and H2 are purified by column chromatography, while H4 follows the same pattern except that extraction is replaced by precipitation by pouring the cooled reaction mixture into methanol. HTM H3 requires the simplest purification: the cooled reaction mixture is poured into ethyl acetate and the formed crystals are filtered and washed with methanol and ethyl acetate.
Thermal properties
The thermal stability of the materials was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the results can be seen in Fig. 1 and Table 1. All tested HTMs showed 5% weight loss at temperatures higher than 300 °C, proving that they are sufficiently thermally stable for application in PSCs. Furthermore, the rapid weight loss seen in Fig. 1 indicates that the investigated materials can sublime and could be vacuum deposited.

Analysis of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data showed that materials H1, H2 and H4 have relatively high glass transition temperatures (Tg), above 100 °C (Table 1). This might be beneficial for the stability of PSCs under working conditions, when the temperature can exceed 65 °C.28 The aforementioned compounds can be both amorphous and crystalline with melting temperatures (Tm) higher than 200 °C for H1 and H2. H4 undergoes crystallization at 202 °C and subsequent melting of the crystals at 315 °C during first heating.
Interestingly m-tolidine derivative H3 is a crystalline material with Tm observed at 339 °C. The lack of Tg could be explained by the spatial configuration of diphenylacetaldehyde substituents and the two methyl groups in the meta-position of the m-tolidine fragment. Introduction of structural symmetry in H3, compared with H2, leads to a higher melting temperature and increased tendency to crystallize. It is verified by the absence of glass transition during the first and second heating runs, presence of an exothermic crystallization peak at 239 °C during rapid cooling and endothermic melting peak at 330 °C during the second heating run in the DSC curves for H3 (Fig. S1†).
Optical and photoelectrical properties
Light absorption and emission characteristics of HTMs H1, H2, H3 and H4 were measured in toluene solutions and on a glass substrate. Compounds H1 and H2 contain three phenylethenyl substituents and differ only by the central core (carbazole in H1 and aniline in H2), however that is sufficient to influence the optical properties. Differences in absorption spectra between these two materials are noticeable both in solution and on a glass substrate.
The observed redshift (∼25 nm) in the UV-vis absorption spectra for the aniline derivative H2, compared with carbazole HTM H1 (Fig. 2a and b), could be explained by the structural difference of the central core of H1 and H2.29,30 The same tendencies can be seen for the emission spectra: after excitation, H1 emits shorter wavelength light than H2 (Fig. S2 and S3†).
 Fig. 2  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra of H1, H2, H3, and H4 in toluene and (b) thin-films on glass. 

H3 and H4 are structurally similar molecules both containing four phenylethenyl substituents connected via two aniline derivatives with the biggest difference being interruption of the conjugation in H4 by a cyclohexane fragment. The aforementioned separation has little effect on the absorption and emission properties when comparing H3 with H4 (Table 2). The most notable difference can be seen in the intensity of absorption in the solution: H3 demonstrates more intense absorption than H4 (Fig. 2a).29 This could be explained by the slightly lower π-conjugation of H4 due to somewhat larger steric hindrances in the molecule compared to H3.

Ionization energies (Ip) of the investigated p-type semiconductors were measured by photoemission spectroscopy in air (Fig. 3a). Materials H2, H3 and H4 have Ip values in the 5.30–5.40 eV range, while H1 has a higher Ip of 5.57 eV (Table 3). The large difference of Ip between H2–H4 and H1 is most likely due to the fact that H1 contains a carbazole fragment, while other tested HTMs can be viewed as aniline derivatives.29,30

The charge carrier mobility of HTMs was measured from films by the xerographic time-of-flight (XTOF) method (Fig. 3b). All materials displayed excellent charge transport properties, well above 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 3), rivalling some of the best organic HTMs used in PSCs.31 The good drift carrier mobility of the tested materials could be explained by more efficient charge hopping due to more favourable arrangement of molecules.32
Device performance
Perovskite solar cells with the p–i–n configuration (Fig. 4a) were prepared by vacuum deposition following previously published protocols (details in the ESI†).33 Briefly, glass slides with indium tin oxide (ITO) patterned electrodes were coated with MoO3 (5 nm), the hole transport layer (HTL, 10 nm), a 500 nm thick methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) absorber, C60 (25 nm), bathocuproine (BCP, 8 nm) and silver (100 nm). MoO3 was used to increase the work function at the front electrode and enhance charge extraction from the HTL to the ITO.34 All four HTLs were tested in devices, and at least 8 pixels were measured for each material.

The solar cells were characterized by measuring the current density as a function of the applied voltage (J–V curves, Fig. 4b), under simulated solar illumination, in forward (from short to open circuit) and reverse (from open to short circuit) bias. J–V curves showed only small hysteresis between the forward and reverse bias, which might indicate the presence of interfacial recombination.35 The characteristic photovoltaic parameters (extracted from the forward J–V scans) as a function of the HTL used are reported in Table 4. The short-circuit current Jsc was found to vary only in the 20.5–21 mA cm−2 range among the series of devices with different HTLs, due to their high transparency in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is confirmed by the spectral response of the solar cells (external quantum efficiency, Fig. 4c), which is similar for the entire series, fluctuating between EQE values of 0.8 and 0.9. More striking are the differences in fill factor (FF), which reflects the efficiency of the charge transport and extraction processes. Solar cells with H3 and H4 showed a pronounced kink in the J–V curve under illumination, which results in an average FF limited to 56.8% and 53.8%, respectively.

The FF was slightly higher for cells with H1, reaching 67.6% on average, and the maximum value was obtained when employing H2 as the HTL, with an average FF of 71.8% and as high as 74.9% for the best pixels. The origin of this trend is not clear, as we did not observe a correlation with the charge carrier drift mobility (Table 3) or with the ionization energy of the materials. A more apparent trend was observed for the open-circuit voltage (Voc), which was found to scale inversely with the ionization energy of the HTLs (Fig. 4d). This observation is likely related to the alignment of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the HTL (estimated from the ionization energy) and the maximum of the valence band (VBM) of the perovskite. While the Voc of perovskite solar cells is rather insensitive to the HOMO of the HTLs,36,37 there is a consensus towards the need to minimize the energy barriers for charge extraction to maximize voltage and FF.38 In this case, the higher photovoltage (1105 mV on average, with the highest at 1130 mV) measured for H2 agrees with recent measurements of the VBM for MAPI, estimated at 5.2 eV from the vacuum level.39 On the other extreme, solar cells employing H1 as the transport material (ionization energy > 5.5 eV) delivered a Voc of approximately 1080 mV. The overall efficiency of the devices with H2 was found to be the highest in the series, with PCE of 16.3% on average and the best pixel at 17.6%. In view of the promising performance of H2 in our vacuum deposited perovskite solar cells, we have fabricated additional cells with a thinner HTL (5 nm instead of 10 nm), as this might alleviate transport losses within the organic semiconductor and increase the built-in potential.36
Solar cells with 5 nm thick H2 show very good rectification, fully suppressed hysteresis and FF as high as 80%, maintaining the other photovoltaic parameters essentially unvaried (Fig. 5a). The improvement in FF led to PCE as high as 18.4%, which is close to the highest reported for vacuum-processed p–i–n devices33,40 (about 19%). We further tested the solar cells over time, under continuous simulated solar illumination. The devices were encapsulated with UV-curable resin and a glass slide and kept at 25 °C under a nitrogen flow (max relative humidity 10%), to minimize the effect of the environment. The maximum power point was continuously tracked and the evolution of the PCE over time is depicted in Fig. 3b. The solar cell showed an initial rise in efficiency (to about 19%) followed by a slow but continuous decay for the 7 days of characterization. After one week of continuous operation, the device with H2 contact delivered a PCE of 12.5%, which was found to be mainly determined by the decrease in FF (see inset in Fig. 5b) and to a lesser extent by a lower current density. While the latter points towards degradation of the MAPI perovskite film, we cannot exclude other degradation pathways related to interfacial effects at the front contact.

(b) Evolution of the efficiency measured under continuous illumination with maximum power point tracking over a week. The inset shows the J–V curves of the device before and after 200 hours of continuous illumination. 
Cost estimation
To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the best performing material H2, we calculated the estimated cost of its synthesis based on the procedure established by Osedach et al. (Table S1†).41 Moreover, the cost of spiro-TTB, an often used p-type semiconductor in vacuum deposited PSCs,37 was calculated based on articles by M. L. Petrus et al. and Yin et al. (Table S2†).42,43 It was estimated that the cost of our HTM is about 19$ per gram which is less than 1/3 of spiro-TTB (about 67$ per gram). Furthermore, synthesis of H2 is done in a single step reaction and does not require expensive palladium catalysis, avoiding traces of organic impurities and catalyst residue that could act as photoquenchers or charge traps.44,45
Conclusions
We have synthesized new enamine-based compounds using a single step reaction without the use of expensive transition metal catalysts. Despite structural differences, all HTMs displayed excellent charge transport properties with H2 reaching a hole mobility of 2.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 under strong electric fields. Furthermore, all materials exhibited relatively high Tg and Tm, great thermal stability and rapid weight loss during TGA, which allowed processing of these HTMs in p–i–n architecture PSCs via vacuum deposition. H2 demonstrated the highest performance with the champion cell reaching 18.4% power conversion efficiency. The above-mentioned results and properties designate these compounds as attractive materials for large scale PSC applications.
