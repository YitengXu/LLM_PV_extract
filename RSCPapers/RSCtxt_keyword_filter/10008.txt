    , Accepted 23rd July 2016First published on 25th July 2016AbstractVapor-assisted deposition of organometal trihalide perovskite films shows particular advantages in high-quality film preparation and mass-production because of the precisely controlled vapor–solid reaction. However, a high-vacuum environment is required for the deposition process, which is not suitable for the production of low-cost next-generation solar cells. Here, a modified vapor-assisted deposition method for high-quality perovskite films fully under the ambient atmosphere has been developed that exhibits superior ambient tolerance, even at high relative humidity of over 60%. The crystallization behaviors of the perovskite films were investigated in detail, and were highly dependent on the vapor diffusion and reaction at the interface and film recrystallization induced by the proposed in situ annealing process. The uniform, high-quality perovskite films produced efficient perovskite photovoltaics with power conversion efficiency of over 18% (highest value of 18.90%).
Introduction
Recently, organometal trihalide perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have been developed intensively owing to their potential application in next-generation solar cells that are low cost and have high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–3 The simple fabrication processes set this new type of solar cells apart from conventional thin-film solar cells, such as amorphous silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS).4 Currently, solution based spin coating is the most common deposition method for preparing perovskite films, and it is often performed with one-step or two-step procedures.4,5 However, unsatisfactory surface coverage6 or film uniformity7 have been persistent problems owing to the fast crystal growth and low nucleation speed in this solution-based process,8,9 and these problems severely limit the PCE, light stability, and J–V hysteresis of as-produced perovskite photovoltaics. Generally, balancing the nucleation and crystallization is crucial to obtain smooth, uniform perovskite films by solution-based fabrication.10–12
Similar to other thin-film solar cells, vapor deposition is also attractive for fabricating perovskite-based solar cells, because the crystallization process can be precisely controlled during the inorganic vapor transport, diffusion and reaction, resulting in higher film quality and interface uniformity.9,13,14 The vapor deposition of a high-quality planar perovskite film with superior photovoltaic (PV) performance was first reported by Snaith and co-workers in 2012.15 Co-evaporation of PbI2 and CH3NH3I (MAI) sources was used to prepare uniform perovskite films, which produced devices with the best PCE reported that year, demonstrating the advantages of vapor deposition for preparing perovskite films.15 To lower the cost and improve mass production, the vapor-assisted solution process (VASP) was reported by Chen et al. to prepare high quality planar perovskite films.16 Recently, to improve the film quality and device PV performance, various vapor-assisted deposition routes with different growth technologies have been developed, including hybrid chemical vapor deposition (HCVD),17 hybrid physical chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD),18 low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD),19in situ tubular chemical vapor deposition (ITCVD),20 and modified chemical vapor transport (mCVT).21 However, high-vacuum conditions or inert ambient are required in most of the vapor-assisted film deposition methods, as well the sequential or co-evaporation processes.9,22 These conditions are not suitable for fabricating low-cost photovoltaics. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new vapor deposition method that is robust to ambient conditions and produces satisfactory film quality and device performance. In addition, the PCE should be improved to be competitive with those produced by currently used solution methods.23,24
Here, we report a facile vapor-assisted route for fabricating efficient perovskite solar cells under ambient atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, and a wide humidity range (RH of 35 to 60%). By optimizing the crystallization kinetics, particularly in situ annealing under organic vapor conditions, high-quality perovskite films with large crystal domains and uniform surface morphology were obtained, resulting in a satisfactory PCE of over 18% in the corresponding devices. Furthermore, by introducing a mesoporous PbI2 interface to facilitate the crystallization process during the vapor–solid reaction, a further improvement in PCE (∼6%) with a maximum value of 18.90% in the fabricated PSCs was accomplished. Additionally, due to the improved crystallinity of the prepared perovskite films, better light stability and less hysteresis were realized.
Results and discussion
A schematic of the vapor-assisted deposition system is shown in Fig. 1a and the corresponding equipment is shown in Fig. S1a.† To realize the effective fabrication of high-quality perovskite films in the ambient atmosphere, the heating source was modified to use a hot air flow through the outer tube instead of the commonly used electrothermal method. The air-flow was generated by a commercial heat gun (HG-2310, Steinel) with a program controlled temperature and flow rate. The carrier gas used for MAI vapor transport was also injected as hot air through the hole in the head of inner glass tube (vapor reaction chamber). The humidity in the vapor reaction region of the inner tube could be controlled and was maintained at a typical RH of about 10% when the ambient RH was about 40%. Additionally, the temperature distribution along the inner reaction tube could be controlled by adjusting the heating temperature, which is important for maintaining suitable conditions for organic vapor generation, reaction with PbI2, and condensation in different regions of the inner chamber.

With the optimized heating temperature and air flow speed, a uniform perovskite film with dense surface morphology was obtained with this system under the ambient atmosphere (Fig. 1b–d and S2†). Large crystal domains and uniform film thickness were observed from the surface and cross-sectional SEM images. The photoluminescence (PL) mapping indicated uniform crystallinity on a large scale in the perovskite films (Fig. S3†). Volume expansion occurred after the vapor–solid reaction,9,25 as seen in the morphology evolution in Fig. S4.†
In the vapor-assisted deposition process, the MAI organic vapor is transported along the chamber driven by the carrier gas, and then migrates from the PbI2 film surface into the film to produce MAPbI3 crystals gradually, as shown schematically in Fig. 2a. Thus, the growth temperature should mainly determine the diffusion kinetic energy of MAI vapor molecules entering the PbI2 layer, as well as the diffusion distance and reaction rate.26 In this work, the heating temperature was optimized at 150 °C to produce high-crystallinity perovskite films with large crystal domains (Fig. S5†), and the temperature distribution in the reaction chamber was measured as shown in Fig. S1b.† The suitable growth region in the reaction chamber was optimized by evaluating the substrate position-dependent film quality and device performance (Fig. S6†). Additionally, as demonstrated by Lin and co-workers,27 the vapor partial pressure is also a critical parameter for preparing high-quality films in the vapor-assisted deposition process, which strongly affects the perovskite's crystallization. Therefore, the air-flow speed was optimized further to obtain the suitable vapor concentration and mass transport rate for the vapor–solid reaction (Fig. S7†).28

(c) Summarized diffraction peak intensity evolution of perovskite (110) and PbI2 (100) planes and (d) the corresponding absorption spectra of the perovskite films in (b). 
The vapor-assisted perovskite crystallization evolution was evaluated by XRD (Fig. 2b and c). Two crystal growth stages were observed from the X-ray diffraction intensity of the perovskite and PbI2 as seen in Fig. 2c: (I) the perovskite crystallization process through the vapor–solid reaction; and (II) the recrystallization process through the in situ annealing under a vapor atmosphere. In the first growth stage (0–90 min), the perovskite diffraction peaks increased gradually while the PbI2 peaks decreased in intensity. In the second stage, as the growth duration increased to 150 min, the diffraction intensity of perovskite increased further, whereas that of PbI2 did not change. At this stage, the simultaneous annealing effect on the perovskite film was the dominant process rather than the vapor–solid reaction, which could promote the recrystallization of the perovskite film further. In contrast to the traditional post-annealing process,16,29 this in situ annealing process promotes the further recrystallization of the perovskite layer and prevents the degradation of the as-formed perovskite layer under the MAI-rich atmosphere. The XRD spectra (Fig. S8†) showed that compared with the perovskite films treated by the post-annealing process, a stronger perovskite diffraction peak intensity was observed for the in situ annealed perovskite film.
The long heating time would also cause perovskite decomposition owing to the high temperature,30 resulting in decreased crystal quality. The 180 min sample with decreased perovskite diffraction intensity demonstrated that the degradation process gradually dominated in this stage (stage III), accompanied by the slightly increased PbI2 diffraction intensity. The absorption characteristics of the perovskite film with the increase in heating time also revealed the crystal evolution process (Fig. 2d), which agreed well with the XRD characterizations. The morphological evolution from the PbI2 film to the perovskite film via the vapor-assisted crystallization process can be visually identified from the SEM images of the samples prepared with different growth durations (Fig. S9†).
As demonstrated by the J–V parameters of the PSCs fabricated using different vapor deposition durations (Fig. S10 and Table S2†), the in situ annealing based recrystallization strongly affected the PV performances of the devices based on the perovskite films. Fig. 3a shows the typical J–V curves of the devices based on films with different growth durations, and the corresponding PV parameters are shown in Table 1. Compared with the 90 min sample, the improved Jsc, Voc, and FF values for the 150 min samples indicates that the more crystalline perovskite film obtained through the in situ annealing process increased the light absorption and carrier transport considerably.29,31 The decreased crystal quality caused by the prolonged heating also decreased PV performance, as for the 180 min sample with PCE of 12.68% (average of 12.79 ± 1.24%). By using the optimized crystallization processes, a cell with the highest PCE of 18.14% (Voc 1.05 V, Jsc 22.04 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.78) was obtained under the ambient atmosphere at an RH of about ∼40% (Fig. 3b). Additionally, the fabrication processes demonstrated an outstanding environmental tolerance. As the RH increased from 35% to 60%, only a small decrease in average PCE occurred: average PCE of 16.43 ± 0.98% at RH of 35%; 16.40 ± 0.99% at RH of 45%; and 16.14 ± 0.89% at RH of 60% (Fig. S11†).

The crystallization of the perovskite film occurs through the MAI diffusion and reaction with the PbI2 film layer. Thus, it is reasonable to predict that the reaction can be improved by manipulating the morphology of the PbI2 layer: a porous structure with smaller PbI2 grains should promote the diffusion and reaction of the organic source. As shown in Fig. 4a, by the conventional method, a dense PbI2 film with large crystal grains would be obtained, so that a long diffusion length is needed for MAI molecules to react with PbI2 in the inner layer. In this situation, there would always be residual PbI2 after the vapor–solid reaction, which could act as recombination defects in perovskite films and limit the subsequent PV performance.32,33 In contrast, the artificially designed mesoporous PbI2 structure with smaller grains would favour the MAI vapor migration and reaction within the PbI2 layer (Fig. 4b).

The polar solvent DMSO was used to produce a mesoporous structure in the PbI2 layer.34 An intermediate PbI2 (DMSO) film phase was obtained after spin-coating the precursor (PbI2:DMSO = 1:1, 1 M in DMF solution)35 (Fig. S12b†). After the heat treatment (60 and 100 °C for 10 min, successively), the DMSO was completely removed (Fig. S13†) and a mesoporous structure consisting of small PbI2 grains was obtained.12 Compared with the morphologies of the traditionally prepared PbI2 layer (Fig. 4c), a flat surface with much smaller crystal domains and a mesoporous inner structure was observed in the DMSO-treated film (Fig. 4d). After the vapor–solid reaction, much larger crystal domains were produced on the mesoporous PbI2 based perovskite film (Fig. 4f), compared with the conventional PbI2 samples (Fig. 4e). Most importantly, the absence of the PbI2 diffraction peak (Fig. 4g) for the mesoporous PbI2 based perovskite film demonstrated the advantage of the mesoporous structure for perovskite crystallization through the modified reaction interface. Fig. 5a shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a complete PSC device fabricated using the mesoporous PbI2 substrate. Because of the improved crystallization from the mesostructured PbI2 layer, the PV performance was further improved with the best cell achieving a PCE value of 18.90% (Fig. 5b and c). The average PCE was also substantially improved to 17.25% compared with the value of 16.29% for the cells fabricated with the conventional PbI2 substrate. The integrated Jsc from the IPCE data (Fig. 5d) for the cell in Fig. 5c was 21.1 mA cm−2, which matched the value in J–V curve well.

Moreover, compared with the conventional PbI2 film device (Fig. S14†), the solar cell prepared on mesoporous PbI2 showed much lower hysteresis, as seen from the J–V curves in Fig. 6a and PV parameters in Table 2. A 9% difference in PCE (forward scan: 16.58%, reverse scan: 18.16%) was obtained in the mesoporous PbI2 device for forward and reverse scans at a constant scan rate of 75 mV s−1, whereas a difference of about 30% was observed in the conventional PbI2 substrate device. The stable J–V performance under different scan rates also indicated lower J–V hysteresis (Fig. S15†).36 Generally, hysteresis is caused by ions or charges accumulating at different kinds of defects or interfaces in a device.37,38 A pure crystal phase with large crystal domains improves charge transport and reduces scan rate-dependent hysteresis.29,39 In this work, the improved crystallinity of perovskite film achieved via mesostructure-engineering of the PbI2 layer suppressed the charge trapping and accumulation substantially, resulting in better PV performance with lower hysteresis.

Furthermore, stable PV performance was maintained over 20 min in the same device prepared on mesoporous PbI2 (Fig. 6b). In particular, the stabilized power output under load exhibited extremely stable performance over 1 h without sealing the device and measured under the ambient atmosphere at RH of ∼60% (Fig. 6c). The pinhole-free perovskite films with well-controlled crystallinity may be the main reason for the light stability of the devices. Additionally, the highly uniform, dense perovskite crystalline films also conferred the devices with exceptional long-term air-stability40,41 compared with the conventional full solution-based PSC devices (Fig. S16†).42
Conclusions
In summary, a perovskite film deposition method was developed to fabricate efficient organometal halide perovskite solar cells under the ambient atmosphere. We demonstrated that the facile and controllable vapor-assisted growth strategy is suitable for producing high-quality perovskite films in the ambient atmosphere, even at high relative humidity (RH) of about 60%. By using the systematically optimized growth temperature, reaction durations, and artificially prepared mesoporous PbI2 substrate, the perovskite crystallization process via the vapor–solid reaction was greatly improved, leading to an efficient photovoltaic performance with a highest power conversion efficiency of 18.90% (average of 17.25%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE achieved in perovskite solar cells fabricated by the vapor deposition method. Moreover, the devices showed long-term air stability and lower hysteresis.
This work demonstrated a simple, effective vapor-assisted perovskite-film fabrication method performed under the ambient atmosphere with good environmental tolerance. Considering the low-cost homemade equipment setup and the compatibility with mass-production, this technology may be a promising route for bringing perovskite solar cells much closer to commercialization.
Experimental
Device fabrication
A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrates by spin-coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Alfa Aesar) in ethanol twice at 3000 rpm for 30 s, drying at 125 °C for 5 min, and annealing at 550 °C in air for 30 min. The substrates were treated with TiCl4 aqueous solution (0.04 M) for 30 min at 70 °C and washed with DI water, followed by deposition of a mesostructure TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer by spin coating a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NRT) diluted in ethanol (1:6, weight ratio) at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and annealing at 550 °C for 30 min. To prepare the perovskite layer, 1 M PbI2 (99.9985%, Alfa Aesar) solution in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 99%, Alfa Aesar) was spin-cast on the substrate and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. For the mesoporous PbI2 substrate, the precursor containing PbI2:DMSO = 1:1 in DMF solution (1 M) was spin-cast on the substrate, followed by heating at 60 °C for 10 min and then at 100 °C for another 10 min. The PbI2 substrates were transferred to the homemade vapor-assisted deposition chamber. MAI powder (0.6–1.0 g, typically 0.7 g, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology, 99.9%) was placed in the front of the chamber and was used as an organic source. Different heating temperatures and reaction durations were used to prepare the vapor-assisted perovskite film. The hole-transporting material (HTM) layer was deposited on the perovskite film by spin coating a solution of spiro-MeOTAD (72.3 mg, Lumtech) mixed with 4-tert-butyl pyridine (28.8 μL) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution (17.5 μL, Li-TFSI, 520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile, Alfa Aesar) in chlorobenzene (1 mL) at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm-thick gold electrodes were deposited by electron beam evaporation through a shadow mask. The active area of the complete device was 0.11 cm2. All of the devices were fabricated under the ambient atmosphere with RH from 35% to 60%.
Characterization
The morphologies were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (S-4800, Hitachi), and the crystallinity of the perovskite films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Ultima IV, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation in a 2θ range of 5–50°. The absorption spectra of the samples were recorded using a spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu). Photoluminescence (PL) mapping measurements were taken on a laser Raman microscope (RAMAN-11, Nanophoton) excited by a 532 nm laser. Photovoltaic J–V measurements were performed with a xenon-based solar simulator (94022A, Newport, Class ABA, AM 1.5G illumination, 100 mW cm−2) equipped with a source meter (2400, Keithley), and a calibrated standard Si reference cell (91150V) certified by the NREL. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured with a power source (66920, Newport, 300 W xenon lamp) with a monochromator (Cornerstone 260, Newport) and an optical power meter (2936-R, Newport).
