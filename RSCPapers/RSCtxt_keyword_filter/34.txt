    , Accepted 27th March 2009First published on 6th May 2009AbstractWe have studied the utilization of PCDTBT, an alternating poly(2,7-carbazole) derivative, in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. The effect of polymer molecular weight, PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio, and active layer thickness on the device performance is reported. The best performance was obtained when the number-average molecular weights (Mn) are around 20 kDa with a polydispersity index around 2.2. Both PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio and active layer thickness affect the light absorption and the charge transport properties. By optimizing these two parameters, power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 4.35% was reached under calibrated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. When blended with [70]PCBM, PCDTBT exhibited a PCE up to 4.6%.
1 Introduction
The sun provides a clean, abundant and renewable energy source that can be harvested to produce electricity which is a convenient strategy to address the growing global energy needs. The high manufacturing cost of the current inorganic solar cells limits this technology for large scale applications. Solar cells based on conjugated polymeric materials have recently received much attention due to their numerous advantages such as their production on flexible and large-area substrates by solution processing which dramatically reduces their manufacturing costs.1,2 In polymer based solar cells, the absorption of photons leads to the formation of excitons that will dissociate into free charge carriers at an interface between two components with different electron affinities and ionization potentials. As the exciton diffusion length for most organic solar cell materials is below 20 nm, only excitons generated in a small region within ≤ 20 nm from the interface contribute to the photocurrent.3–5 To overcome this problem and maximize the light absorption in the active layer, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures6 are widely used in polymer based solar cells. In BHJ structures, the two components (electron donor and electron acceptor) of the active layer form an interpenetrating network which creates a large donor/acceptor interface. For efficient exciton dissociation a charge separation interface should be at the vicinity of exciton generation site. Moreover, each component should form a continuous pathway to the respective electrode. Therefore, appropriate control of the nanoscale morphology in the blend is necessary for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.
Up to now the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of BHJ solar cells are obtained from devices using regioregular poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT) as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) as the electron acceptor.7–9 Despite a considerable amount of research, the PCEs of P3HT:[60]PCBM based solar cells are limited to approximately 5% owing to the relatively large band gap (Eg) of P3HT which is not optimal for harvesting the maximum photon flux of the solar spectrum around 1.6–1.8 eV and to a low open circuit voltage (Voc) of about 0.6 V. To further improve the device performance, new electron acceptor materials10–12 and device architectures13 have been developed by different research groups. For example, tandem solar cells, where two BHJ solar cells with different absorption characteristics are stacked in series to harvest a wider range of the solar spectrum, have been fabricated and PCEs higher than 6% have been achieved.13 Solution-based titanium oxide has also been used as an optical spacer and electron transport layer in order to adjust the optical field distribution inside a device so that the active layer is at the maximum of the optical field.14 On the other hand, much higher PCE is expected for new polymers with reduced optical band gap and optimized electronic properties.15 However, it is hard to find a polymer with a low band gap that efficiently absorbs light in the visible spectral region of the solar spectrum while maintaining a sufficiently low HOMO energy level (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) to insure good air stability16 and high Voc that is decided by the difference between the LUMO energy level (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the donor in a BHJ solar cell.15 Therefore, it is crucial to design and synthesize new low band gap polymers with a LUMO level only 0.2–0.3 eV higher than that of the electron acceptor material to minimize the energy loss while providing enough driving force for exciton dissociation to assure a maximized photovoltage in the BHJ solar cells. According to the calculation by Scharber and co-workers, the ideal polymer for [60]PCBM, should have a LUMO energy level between −3.7 and −4.0 eV and a band gap between 1.5 and 1.8 eV.15

        Poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives are excellent candidates for BHJ solar cells because of their air stability and tunable optical and electrochemical properties.17,18 Recently, we have reported new soluble alternating poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives for photovoltaic applications (Fig. 1).19,20 According to the preliminary results, PCDTBT shows the best performance with a PCE of 3.6% when [60]PCBM is used as an electron-acceptor. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PCDTBT estimated by cyclic voltammetry are −5.45 and −3.60 eV respectively with an electrochemical band gap of 1.85 eV. The thin film optical band gap estimated from the onset of the absorption band is also about 1.88 eV. Its analog PCDTPT (Fig 1.) has a lower band gap (1.73 eV) and more ideal energy levels (HOMO = −5.53; LUMO = −3.80) for use with [60]PCBM. However its PCE is below 1% mainly because of its lower hole mobility.20 Indeed, the field-effect hole mobility of PCDTPT is almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the PCDTBT (1.0 × 10−3 cm−2V−1 s−1) on OTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates. Therefore, energy levels and band gaps as well as charge transport properties should be considered when designing and synthesizing new polymers. The charge transport properties of conjugated polymers are usually related to the solid state packing and the polymer molecular weight. Indeed, recent studies have shown that these two parameters have significant impact on the performance of P3HT based BHJ solar cells.21–23

Along these lines, we report the potential of PCDTBT in polymeric BHJ solar cells by investigating the effect of PCDTBT molecular weight on the device performance. PCDTBT with optimal molecular weight was used to study the effect of the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio and the active layer thickness on the device performance. We also used the [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) as an electron acceptor and the performances of BHJ solar cells are compared with those obtained using [60]PCBM.
2 Results and discussion
As mentioned in the introduction, the performance of P3HT based solar cells depends on the polymer molecular weight. In the case of PCDTBT, we have also noted some variation in device performance from batch to batch depending on the PCDTBT molecular weight. Therefore, it is crucial to elaborate synthetic procedures that will give polymers with the desired molecular weight and processability for optimal device performance. Starting from this point, the experimental procedures of the previously reported20 synthesis of PCDTBT by Suzuki coupling (Scheme 1) have been modified in such a way that fine control of the polymer molecular weight can be obtained through a simple control of reaction time. The new experimental procedure (see experimental section) leads to reproducible material with targeted molecular weights with excellent yields of ≥90%.24Table 1 summarizes the reaction times, the number-average molecular weights (Mn), the weight-average molecular weights (Mw), and the polydispersity indexes (PDI) of the different PCDTBT batches prepared for this study.

The performance of these different PCDTBT batches in BHJ solar cells with [60]PCBM in a weight ratio of 1:2 was tested under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated using a KG5 filter covered silicon photovoltaic solar cell traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The current density-voltage characteristics (J-V) are shown in Fig. 2. The open circuit voltages (Voc), the short circuit densities (Jsc), the fill factors (FF) and the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) derived from the J-V characteristic curves of the BHJ solar cells made from PCDTBT of different molecular weight are listed in Table 1.

The low molecular weight PCDTBT (Mn = 10 kDa) shows a PCE of 2.26%, while all the other PCDTBT batches with higher molecular weight (Mn = 17–22 kDa) exhibit improved PCE. For example, when Mn and Mw are around 19 and 40 kDa, respectively the PCE is as high as 4.15%. This molecular weight range seems to be optimal as PCDTBT with Mw higher than 60 kDa is not completely soluble in chloroform. For devices (1–4), the thickness of the active layer ranges from 72 to 85 nm. We will show later that the thickness variation in this range has very limited effect on the performance of PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (1:2) based solar cells. The series (Rs) and shunt (Rsh) resistances of devices (1–4) were calculated from the slope of the J-V characteristic curves under dark condition close to 1.1 and 0 V, respectively (Table 1).25 Interestingly, the Rsh exhibits a clear correlation with the molecular weight of PCDTBT. Device 1 produced from low-molecular weight PCDTBT has very low Rsh indicating insufficient film quality most likely due to the presence of pinholes. Therefore, the reductions in Voc and FF in device 1 are probably caused by a reduced shunt resistance.1 The Rs is also dependent on the polymer molecular weight except for device 4. For example, the Rs of the low molecular weight PCDTBT (device 1) is about 2 Ω cm2 higher than that of the high molecular weight PCDTBT (device 3). The higher Rs of device 1 is probably related to a lower charge mobility of the low molecular weight PCDTBT. This could also contribute to the reduction in FF as observed for device 1.1 These results show that the molecular weight of PCDTBT has an important effect on the device performance. Solar cells using low molecular weight PCDTBT (around Mn = 10 and Mw = 20) have unfavourable Rsh, Voc, FF and PCE.
To study the effect of the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio and active layer thickness on the device performance, BHJ solar cells using PCDTBT:[60]PCBM active layers with different weight ratios (stoichiometries) (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4) and thicknesses (from 50 to 145 nm) were fabricated and characterized. The performance parameters of these solar cells are summarized in Table 2. To avoid any molecular weight effect, all devices for this study were fabricated using the same PCDTBT batch with Mn around 20 kDa.

The UV-visible absorption spectra of pure PCDTBT, [60]PCBM and PCDTBT:[60]PCBM composites with different weight ratios are shown in Fig. 3a. The absorption spectrum of PCDTBT displays two bands with maxima at 398 and 578 nm. As the absorption of [60]PCBM is very low around 570 nm, one can see that the long wavelength absorption band is mostly from PCDTBT, which decreases with increasing [60]PCBM amount in the blend despite of some small differences in film thickness. On the other hand, the increase of the [60]PCBM absorption is also visible around 335 nm.

(b) The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of BHJ solar cells with different weight ratios of PCDTBT:[60]PCBM composites under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. 
The effect of the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio on the device performance could be observed by comparing devices 7, 11, 15 and 16 (see Table 2). These devices have an active layer thickness around 80 nm except for device 7 where the active layer is only 65 nm. The J-V characteristic curves of these devices in the dark and under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3b. As we can see in Table 2, the blend with the ratio of 1:2 (device 11) has the highest Jsc about −9.0 mA cm−2. This value is about 1 mA cm−2 higher than the one obtained with the ratio of 1:1 (device 7) that exhibits the best absorption in the visible region due to its high PCDTBT amount. Interestingly, the Jsc of the blend with the ratio of 1:4 (device 16) is only 0.4 mA cm−2 lower than that obtained with the ratio of 1:2 (device 11) despite of its much lower UV-visible absorption. We have also observed that the FF increases with increasing amount of [60]PCBM in the blend. The FFs of devices 7, 11, 15 and 16 are 0.40, 0.51, 0.52 and 0.56, respectively. According to these Jsc and FF values, we can deduce that the exciton dissociation and charge transport become efficient when the [60]PCBM amount in the blend is increased. In fact, several research groups have reported that hole and electron mobilities of different polymer:[60]PCBM blends are enhanced when the [60]PCBM amount in the blend increases.26–28 The Voc measured for devices 11, 15 and 16 with the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratios of 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 respectively, are around 0.88 V. Scharber and co-workers have estimated the Voc of polymer:[60]PCBM based BHJ solar cells to be about 0.3 eV less than the built in potential (the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor).15 Therefore, the measured Voc of our devices fit perfectly with the estimated theoretical value of 0.85 V. However, device 7 with the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio of 1:1 has slightly higher Voc (0.94 V). The overall PV performance depends on the product of Voc, Jsc and FF of a solar cell. The best results were obtained from devices prepared using PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratios of 1:2 and 1:4, showing PCE over 4.2% what point out a good combination of efficient light absorption characteristics, excitons dissociation and charge transport properties. The Rs and Rsh show a good correlation with the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio. Both Rs and Rsh decrease with increasing amount of [60]PCBM in the blend. For example, the Rsh for devices 11, 15 and 16 are much lower than the one of device 7 (18 kΩ cm2). As mentioned previously, this could be related to the presence of larger number of pinholes in the active layer when [60]PCBM amount in the blend increases. The Rs for device 7 (12 Ω cm2) is about twice of those for devices 11, 15 and 16 which explains partially it lower FF.
We note here that the thermal annealing of the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM blends with the ratios of 1:2 and 1:4 is not effective for improving the device performance. When the annealing temperature is below 100 °C, the UV-visible absorption spectra of these blends show no change as compared to the non-annealed. On the other hand, when these blends are annealed at 120 °C, the PCDTBT absorption decreases and the long wavelength absorption maxima (around 572 nm) are blue-shifted by several nm. This could be attributed to some changes in molecular packing of the blends as the PCDTBT has a glass transition temperature (Tg) around 130 °C.20
The effect of the active layer thickness on the devices performance could be studied in detail by comparing devices 8 to 14 with PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio of 1:2 and active layer thicknesses ranging from 52 to 132 nm (see Table 2). Fig. 4a shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (1:2) blends with different thicknesses. It is evident that the absorption is enhanced by increasing the thickness of the active layer. Surprisingly, the long wavelength absorption maximum of PCDTBT is red-shifted when the blend thickness decreases. For example, the blends with thicknesses of 132, 80 and 52 nm have maxima at 567, 572 and 580 nm, respectively. Similar red-shifts also exist in the blends having PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratios of 1:1 and 1:4. The origin of this red-shift is not well understood but it could be related to a higher polymer ordering in the blend. This phenomenon was observed with some poly(3-alkylthiophene) films, after thermal annealing or by changing the processing solvent.29–32

(b) The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of BHJ solar cells with different thicknesses of PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (1:2) composites under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. 
The J-V characteristics of devices 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14 with active layer thicknesses of 52, 60, 80, 100 and 132 nm, respectively are shown in Fig. 4b. Device 8 with an active layer thickness of 52 nm has Jsc and FF of −6.73 mA cm−2 and 0.45, respectively. Increasing the film thickness to 60 nm (device 9) improves the light absorption, leading to an excellent Jsc of −9.42 mA cm−2. The FF also increases to 0.51. In this case, the Rsh increases from 1.7 to 5 kΩ cm2, probably due to a better film quality with less pinholes between electrodes.1 The Jsc and FF remain nearly unchanged between 60 and 80 nm. Further increase in the film thickness has a negative effect on these two parameters despite the higher film optical absorption observed by UV-visible. For example, device 14 with an active layer thickness of 132 nm shows Jsc and FF of −8.0 mA cm−2 and 0.45, respectively. This could be attributed to the increased charge recombination in a thicker active layer8,33 and to the increase in the series resistance34,35 (see Table 2). The Voc is relatively stable around 0.90 V for all devices except for device 8 (52 nm) probably due to its extremely low Rsh. According to these results, we conclude that an active layer thickness between 60 and 80 nm provides the best combination of good light absorption and efficient charge transport. In this thickness range, the PCE of the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (1:2) blend is between 4.10 to 4.35% (see Table 2). We note here that the thin film optical interference could have also some effect on the light absorption characteristics and consequently on the performance of our devices.14 This effect is presently under investigation.
As mentioned earlier, the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM blend with the ratio of 1:1 and the thickness of 65 nm, shows high optical density absorption, very impressive Voc but the FF is low. Thus, we fabricated two devices with a thinner active layer in an attempt to improve the charge transport properties and the FF. Indeed, devices 5 and 6 with film thicknesses of 55 and 60 nm respectively, have higher FFs than that of device 7 (65 nm). As expected, the Voc remains high around 0.94 V. However, due to their thinner active layer, their Jsc is lower, cancelling out the improvement by a better FF. Therefore, the PCE remains relatively unchanged between 3 and 3.2%. One can see in Table 2 that the Rs and Rsh also decrease with decreasing film thickness. We note that for this particular PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio, a small change in layer thickness induces large variation in Rs and in FF. For the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM blend with the ratio of 1:4 the situation is completely different. As we have seen with device 16, the FF is relatively high indicating good exciton dissociation and charge transport properties, but the light absorption is low due to the high amount of [60]PCBM in the blend. Therefore, two devices (17 and 18) with thicker active layers were prepared in an attempt to increase the light absorption. Unfortunately, all Voc, Jsc and FF decrease with the increase of active layer thickness and therefore the PCE drops dramatically. Once again, the Rs and Rsh increase with increasing film thickness. Similar reductions in Jsc and FF were also observed with the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (1:2) blend, indicating that increasing the film thickness higher than 80–90 nm for these PCDTBT:[60]PCBM blends has a negative effect on the charge transport properties and consequently on the device performance. The results presented in this work indicate that for polymer:[60]PCBM based BHJ solar cells, both the ratio and film thickness should be optimized in order to reach the best balance between good excitons generation, dissociation and charge transport properties.
As the absorption of [60]PCBM is inefficient in the visible region, [70]PCBM has been used as electron acceptor to improve the light absorption of the active layer in this region, and consequently the current density.36 Thus, BHJ solar cells (devices 19–22) based on PCDTBT:[70]PCBM composites with weight ratios of 1:2 and 1:4 and different active layer thicknesses (70 to 90 nm) were fabricated and characterized under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 5b). The performance parameters of these BHJ solar cells are summarized in Table 3.

The UV-visible absorption spectra of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM composites with weight ratios of 1:2 and 1:4 are shown in Fig. 5a. The spectra of pure PCDTBT, [60]PCBM, [70]PCBM and PCDTBT:[60]PCBM composites with weight ratios of 1:2 and 1:4 are also presented for comparison. As we can see, the optical density of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM composites from 400 to 700 nm is much higher than that of the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM composites indicating that the [70]PCBM absorb much more efficiently in this region. In the case of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (1:4) composite, the absorption of [70]PCBM complement perfectly the valley in the absorption spectrum of PCDTBT.
Device 19 based on PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (1:2) composite with an active layer thickness of 70 nm exhibits Jsc of −10.22 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.89 V, FF of 0.51 and PCE of 4.57%. With the same active layer thickness, device 20 based on PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (1:4) composites shows slightly lower Jsc (−10.06 mA cm−2), Voc (0.88 V) and FF (0.49), and consequently a reduced PCE of 4.32%. As we can see in Table 3, increasing the thickness of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (1:4) layer has a negative effect on the Jsc indicating that the charge transport of the composite is the bottleneck and not its light absorption. The FF for device 21 (75 nm) is slightly improved as compared to that of device 20 (69 nm), probably due to the increased Rsh of the 75 nm film. This FF improvement compensates the loss in current density, therefore the PCE remains nearly constant in this thickness range.
Indeed, the comparison of the results obtained with [70]PCBM and [60]PCBM is highly interesting. For the same composite weight ratio and similar active layer thickness, the Jsc of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM device is higher than that of PCDTBT:[60]PCBM device (see Tables 2 and 3). This is certainly attributed to the higher absorption of [70]PCBM in the visible spectral region (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, the FF of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (1:4) composites (devices 20 and 21), shows significant decrease as compared to that of PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (1:4) composite (device 16), although the FFs of composites with weight ratio of 1:2 (devices 9 and 19) are nearly the same. According to these results, we suppose that the FF decrease in the case of the PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (1:4) composites is related to the less favorable nanoscale morphology instead of the intrinsic mobility of [70]PCBM. In fact, a recent study shows that [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM exhibit comparable electron mobilities in organic field-effect transistors.37 It will be interesting to work on the film processing conditions to improve the nanoscale morphology and consequently the Jsc, FF and PCE. We note that the Voc is similar for PCDTBT based devices using [60]PCBM or [70]PCBM as the electron transport material since the difference in their LUMO levels is just a few meV.
3 Conclusion
The use of PCDTBT, an alternating poly(2,7-carbazole) derivative, in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells has been investigated. The relationship between the device performance and PCDTBT molecular weight, PCDTBT:[60]PCBM ratio, and active layer thickness has been studied. To start, we developed an improved synthetic procedure that provides precise control of the PCDTBT molecular weight through a simple control of the reaction time. The best performance was obtained when the Mn is around 20 kDa and the PDI is around 2.2. Active layers made of lower molecular weight PCDTBT tend to have lower Rsh and low FF while higher molecular weight PCDTBT suffers from low solubility in chloroform. In this work, we demonstrated that both the ratio of PCDTBT:[60]PCBM composite and the thickness of the active layer have significant impact on the device performance. PCDTBT:[60]PCBM composites with weight ratios of 1:2 and 1:4 have the best combination of light absorption, exciton dissociation and charge transport. In the case of the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM (1:2) composites, active layers with thicknesses between 60 and 80 nm offer the best combination between good light absorption and efficient charge transport, therefore a PCE up to 4.35% has been obtained. The use of [70]PCBM as an electron acceptor improves the light absorption of the active layer in the visible region as compared to [60]PCBM. Therefore the Jsc values of the PCDTBT:[70]PCBM composites are about 10–15% higher than those of the PCDTBT:[60]PCBM composites. In the case of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (1:2) composite a PCE up to 4.6% has been reached. We believe that the performance of PCDTBT based BHJ solar cells can be further improved through employing new device architectures and optimizing process conditions.

            2,7-Bis(4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′,2′-dioxaborolan-2′-yl)-N-9″-heptadecanyl-carbazole
            20 was purified by recrystallization twice from methanol/acetone 10:1 ratio. 4,7-di(2′-bromothien-5′-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole20 was purified by recrystallization from o-dichlorobenzene.

          . 
In a 50 mL oven dried flask (115 °C; 12 h), 657.6 mg (1.000 mmol) of 2,7-bis(4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′,2′-dioxaborolan-2′-yl)-N-9″-heptadecanyl-carbazole, 458.2 mg (1.000 mmol) of 4,7-di(2′-bromothien-5′-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, 4.6 mg (0.0050 mmol) of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) and 6.1 mg (0.020 mmol) of tri(o-tolyl)phosphine were added. The flask was then purged 3 times with argon. 10.0 mL of degassed toluene and 3.4 mL of degassed 20% (w/w) aqueous tetraethylammonium hydroxide were added at room temperature. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred from room temperature to 95 °C at an heating rate of 1.8 °C/min using an oil bath. After 3 h of reaction time, bromobenzene (110 µL, 1.0 mmol) was added to the reaction and the reaction was kept at 95 °C for an additional hour. Phenylboronic acid (120 mg, 1.0 mmol) in hot toluene (3 mL) was then added and reacted for another hour to complete the end-capping reaction. The reaction mixture was poured in methanol/water (10:1) mixture and the polymer was filtered through 0.45 µm nylon filter. The crude material was washed with acetone and hexanes using a soxhlet. The remaining solid was extracted with chloroform (400 mL) for 5 hours. Then the solvent was reduced under reduced pressure to about 50 mL and the polymer solution was poured in cold methanol (500 mL). The polymer was recovered by filtration and dried under vacuum (24 hours) without heating. In average, 630 mg (Y ≥90%) of PCDTBT with Mn = 20 kDa and Mw = 40 kDa is obtained.

Instrumentation
Number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights of different PCDTBT batches were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a high temperature Varian Polymer Laboratories GPC220 equipped with an RI detector and a PL BV400 HT Bridge Viscometer. The column set consists of 2 PLgel Mixed C (300 × 7.5 mm) columns and a PLgel Mixed C guard column. The flow rate was fixed at 1.0 mL/min using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) (with 0.0125% BHT w/v) as eluent. The temperature of the system was set to 140 °C. All the samples were prepared at concentrations of nominally 1.0 mg/mL in hot TCB. Dissolution was performed using a Varian Polymer Laboratories PL-SP 260VC sample preparation system. The sample vials were held at 160 °C with shaking for 1 h for complete dissolution. The solutions were filtered through a 2 µm porous stainless steel filter used with the SP260 pipettor into a 2 mL chromatography vial. The calibration method used to generate the reported data was the classical polystyrene method using polystyrene narrow standards Easi-Vials PS-M from Varian Polymer Laboratories which were dissolved in TCB. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 50 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The samples for absorption measurements were prepared by spin-coating on quartz substrates under the same conditions as their corresponding devices. The thickness of the active layers was measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profilometer.
Device fabrication and characterization
The BHJ solar cells were prepared on commercial ITO-coated (120 nm) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω/square. The substrates (5 × 5 cm) were patterned by conventional wet-etching process using a mixture of HCl (6 N) and HNO3 (0.6 N) as the etchant. After patterning, the substrates were rinsed in de-ionized water, and then ultrasonicated sequentially in acetone (20 °C) and isopropanol (65 °C). Each substrate contains 8 devices with an active area of 5 × 8 mm each. The substrates were treated in a UV-ozone cleaner for 15 min immediately prior to spin-coating of organic layers. First, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) thin film (50 nm) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 60 s and then baked at 120 °C under nitrogen for 1 h. Secondly, an the active layer was spin-coated for 60 s on top of the PEDOT-PSS from chloroform solutions, which consisted of a mixture of the PCDTBT and fullerene derivative ([60]PCBM form American Dye Source or [70]PCBM from Nano-C) with required weight ratio. Depending on the desired thickness, a spin rate of 2000, 1500 or 1000 rpm was applied (see table for the polymer concentration in chloroform solutions). Finally, 1 nm of LiF and 120 nm of Al were deposited on the top of the active layer in a vacuum of 2 × 10−7 Torr to form the top electrode. The solar cells (with no protective encapsulation) were then tested in air under AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 which was calibrated using a KG5 filter covered silicon photovoltaic solar cell traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter.

The experimental procedures reported in ref. 19 and ref. 20 give low yields (23 and 53%, respectively) because an important part of the polymer has a very high molecular weight which renders it insoluble in hot chloroform.
