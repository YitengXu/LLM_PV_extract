Successfully, a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 8.03% for pure ZnO-based DSSCs has been achieved, which is the highest one up to now.
With increasing concern on how to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), researchers have been making great efforts since 1991 when the pioneer M. Grätzel used TiO2 as a photoanode for preparing dye-sensitized solar cells.1 What's more, in 2001, he improved the efficiency of TiO2-based DSSCs to 10.4%, laying an important foundation for their practical application.2 But further development has been limited due to the fact that the efficiency can be greatly affected by dark current because of the surface defects in TiO2.3 Compared with TiO2, the rate of electron transport in ZnO is faster than that in TiO2 and besides it has other advantages of easy preparation, controllable conditions and so on.4 Up to now, the photovoltaic conversion efficiencies of DSSCs using pure ZnO have improved significantly from 0.4% in 19945 to 7.5% in 2011,6 so it is of high importance to study the application of pure ZnO in DSSCs.
But as far as we know, hydrogen-related defect-donors (H+)7 in ZnO limits the improvement of its efficiency to a great extent by accelerating the internal electron recombination,8 which would lead to the decay of charge carriers. Thus reducing the hydrogen-related defects to reduce the decay of charge carriers is one of the key factors to improve the PCE. Until now, few research studies in this area have been reported.
According to the report by Park,9 the water-induced acceptor-like trap, that is a hydrogen-related defect, is closely related to the adsorption of water molecules and more over, hydrogen-related defects will be formed during the annealing process of Zn(OH)2 to form ZnO. Herein, reducing the adsorption of water molecules in the precursor Zn(OH)2 is of high importance to increase the PCE of DSSCs.
A plasma instrument is a simple but efficient instrument which differentiates itself from other approaches by its low energy consumption, convenience, and high speed.10 By using it, Yang removed the water from a material and thus got a good result in the food industry in 2013.11 In the field of DSSCs, however, researchers historically have rarely been interested in this approach. Therefore, we introduced the plasma instrument to treat the precursor Zn(OH)2. Successfully, we got an efficiency of 8.03% which is up to now the highest demonstrated PCE with ZnO-based DSSCs.
The precursor Zn(OH)2 films were prepared by a simple, cheap, and large-area-scalable solid-state method, after using the low temperature and low pressure air plasma to deal with the precursor which was then annealed at 200 °C for 100 min, the sponge-like photoanodes with high porosity and optical density were successfully fabricated. As a further benefit, our method is extremely fast (3 min for the complete processing of a photoanode), enabling its technological implementation.
Under AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, using air plasma treatments of 1, 3, 5 and 10 min (marked as ZnO-x, with x as the respective time of treatment), the materials were then thermally treated at 200 °C. High PCEs of 7.76%, 8.03%, 7.39% and 6.96% were yielded by the DSSCs compared to 5.31% from using the same method except for the air plasma. More importantly, the PCEs are larger than those of other DSSCs with ZnO photoanodes.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the treated ZnO showed no difference to those that were not treated by air plasma both in the size distribution and in the peak shape, which shows that the plasma treatment does not affect the morphology or crystal type (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  SEM images of ZnO samples with (a) and without (b) plasma treatment and their XRD patterns (c). 
One of our most startling recent findings is that, the FTIR spectra of the treated samples all showed well regulated changes in line with the time of the air plasma treatment, both before and after annealing, as shown in Fig. 2. The peak at 1546 cm−1 clearly represents the bending vibration peak of H–O bonding in H2O in the precursor Zn(OH)2.12,13 It obviously decreases gradually until completely disappearing with the prolonging of treatment time, which means that the absorbed water can be removed by air plasma treatment. While after the annealing treatment, the bending vibration peak of H–O bonding at 1630 cm−1 shows that there exists hydroxyl groups on the surface of ZnO.14 And the peak at 1385 cm−1 representing the bending vibration peak of H–O− resulted from the absorption of hydrogen-related defects.15,16 The ratio of these two peak areas represents the relative content of hydrogen-related defects. When the treatment time was 0, 1, 3, 5 and 10 min, the corresponding ratios of I1630/I1385 were 0.34, 0.47, 0.59, 0.68 and 0.71 respectively, which means that the content of hydrogen-related defects decreased as the treatment time went by. Thus the results of the experimental test fully meet the expected purpose.

In the initial stages of our investigation, we applied a conventional strategy by controlling the variables to keep the power at 150 watts and used the plasma instrument to treat the precursor for 1 min. Subsequently, the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs was encouraging since an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.63 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.39 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.61, and a high PCE of 7.76% were obtained, which corresponded to the desired purpose of our experiment. Inspired by the result, we further increased the treatment time (3 min, 5 min, and 10 min), hoping to get a higher PCE through decreasing the hydrogen-related defects. Moreover, under the optimum time, we also compared the performance under different processing powers (100, 150 and 200 watts) and found that under 150 watts the performance of the photoanode was better than the other two (for details, see Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). Fig. 3 illustrates the J–V curves of the corresponding devices, which were obtained under the same conditions (e.g. sintering time and temperature, processing power, and sensitization temperature and time). In the processing time of 1–10 min, there was an optimal value of efficiency (see Table 1), which also could be well explained by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) below.

Using the useful technique EIS, we carried out measurements to characterize, analyze, and compare the electric behavior of the five samples under an applied bias of 0.80 V (shown in Fig. 4) from the consideration that the electrons could not be injected from the conductive substrate (FTO in our case) into the conduction band of the oxide semiconductor upon an open circuit voltage.17 After carefully analyzing and fitting the EIS results by Zview modeling software, we got the results as shown below in Table 2, and the detailed fitting process is shown in the ESI.†

The rrec values in Table 2 clearly show that the charge recombination resistance changed little when plasma treated for a short period of time, with only a slow decrease as time went by, which could be attributed to the increase of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the ZnO film caused by the air plasma.22,23 In addition, the current caused by the recombination of electrons and the redox electrolyte could usually be ignored.24 Moreover, the electron transfer resistance in the ZnO film was found to be a key factor for Jsc, as the electron transport resistance rtr in the film after plasma treatment had decreased sharply compared to that without treatment. When dealing with a relatively short time period, the oxygen vacancies on the surface of ZnO increased with increasing treatment time, leading to the boost in the surface charge carriers, thus making the contact resistance Rs decline. Moreover, the value of Jsc grew with the prolonging of treatment time due to the reduced loss of charge carriers in the ZnO film and reached the optimal value when treating for 3 min. In the meantime, the increase in the series resistances also limited the further growth of Jsc. Because when overtreated by air plasma, ZnO with relatively poor crystallinity was generated by the rapidly increasing temperature in the reaction chamber, leading to poor conductivity, and thus the contact resistance on the interface of ZnO/FTO was increased. In order to detect these changes, we characterised the products ZnO, ZnO-1, ZnO-3, ZnO-5 and ZnO-10 by XRD, and the data were fitted by the analysis software Jade, see Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†). The crystallinities of the samples were 16.56%, 15.27%, 13.85%, 12.08% and 7.59%, respectively. In this regard, it was reasonable that the electronic transmission efficiency would reach an optimal value only when treated with air plasma for an appropriate time.
In addition, we have carried out an analysis of the dye loading by desorbing dye molecules in a 0.1 M NaOH ethanol–water (molar ratio 1:1) solution and then measuring the adsorption using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. As shown in Fig. 5, the amount of dye loading was regularly improved a little by the air plasma treatment and reached the highest amount when treating for 3 min. In order to further explain the change in the specific surface area, we carried out an N2 adsorption–desorption test (see Fig. S8, ESI†), and the variation trend was consistent with the variation trend of dye adsorption. The plasma treatment could to some extent help to increase the surface area of zinc oxide. Yet it was not that significant compared with the sample obtained without treatment.

Therefore, the appropriate processing time plays a large role in improving the photovoltaic performance of the treated photoanodes in DSSCs. In this work, we also tested the long-term light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of the sample ZnO-3 every 12 hours for 72 hours. The results showed that the effect of the air plasma treatment on the photoanode was relatively enduring, as shown in Fig. 6.

We discussed the influence of hydrogen-related defects in ZnO on the efficiency of DSSCs. Furthermore, by using the simple but effective method—low temperature plasma to treat the precursor Zn(OH)2, we successfully reduced the hydrogen-related defects in ZnO, thus reducing the charge carrier recombination to improve the Jsc. Finally, we achieved an enhanced PCE of 8.03% for the pure ZnO-based DSSCs photoelectrode, which is the highest one up to now. Furthermore, the performance of our ZnO-based DSSCs were compared with other zinc oxide based dye sensitized cells, as shown in Fig. 7.18–21 Compared with other methods to treat ZnO, our approach is undoubtedly novel, facile, simple, faster and economical. Therefore, regarding the way of processing the precursor of ZnO nanostructures, we believe our work has great potential for photovoltaic promotions in DSSCs especially other ZnO-based DSSCs.
