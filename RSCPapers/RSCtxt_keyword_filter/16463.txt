    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 25th April 2023AbstractPerovskite solar cell (PSC) commercialization faces intrinsic stability and efficiency challenges. N1-phenylethane-1,2-diamine hydrohalides (PNEAX) based on a new design strategy featuring cation and anion optimization have been developed for efficient interfacial passivation. Among them, PNEACl-treated devices achieved a champion efficiency of 21.01% with good stability.
Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rocketed from 3.9% to a certified 25.7% in the past decade, making PSCs a promising new-generation photovoltaic technology.1,2 Compared with regular (n-i-p) type PSCs, inverted (p-i-n) PSCs show some unique advantages including low temperature and solution fabrication, negligible hysteresis, cheap copper electrodes, and enhanced stabilities.3 However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted PSCs still lag behind regular PSCs. Considering the polycrystalline nature of solution-processed perovskite films, unavoidable defects may be the main reason for the energy loss of PSCs. Since most bulk defects are shallow-level one-dimensional point defects, the deep-level defects located at the interface are more critical for device performance.4 These defects and resulting trap states play a major role in carrier recombination, leading to a limited open-circuit voltage (VOC) as well as a deteriorated photovoltaic performance. Therefore, interfacial passivation is necessary.
Among different kinds of passivating materials, ammonium halide salts featuring both negative and positive groups are supposed to simultaneously passivate positive and negative ionic defects through ionic bonds, coordinate bonds, and hydrogen bonds.5 Phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) is a widely-used ammonium halide with good interfacial passivation properties. You et al. reported the use of PEAI for surface passivation by reducing the defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination.6 An impressive certified PCE of 23.32% with a VOC as high as 1.18 V was obtained, which reached 94.4% of the Shockley–Queisser limit (1.25 V). Although PEAI delivered good passivation properties, there is still much room for further improvement. It is generally acknowledged that full passivation of various defects with more than one functional unit is beneficial for device performance.4 As for PEA+ cations, the insertion of a Lewis base with a lone pair electrons from N, S, and O atoms helps the formation of a Lewis adduct, which can passivate undercoordinated Pb2+. As for halogen ions, I− ions are the most widely used anions, which are expected to fill the iodine vacancies. Other halogen anions such as Br− and Cl− may also have some unique passivating properties. Compared with I−, the Br− containing ammonium halide salts were proven to be able to improve the photovoltage of PSCs by energy band bending at the interfaces due to a reduced orbital overlap between Br− and Pb2+.7 Cl− ions can not only influence the crystallization rate to form larger grains with better morphology but also alter the electronic properties of films by doping perovskite or passivating defect-induced traps at the interfaces and/or grain boundaries.8 Compared with intensely investigated cationic passivating agents, few publications focus on systematic research of anionic alternatives.
In this work, we report a series of novel passivation molecules PNEAX (X for I, Br, Cl) with N1-phenylethane-1,2-diamine (PNEA) as the cation and I−, Br−, or Cl− as the counter anion. The insertion of an N atom into the backbone of PEA+ is expected to passivate undercoordinated Pb2+ by forming a Lewis acid–base adduct. Moreover, after systematic research on altering halogen anions from I− to Br− and Cl−, the effect of halides of passivators on the passivation mechanism is investigated. As evidenced by comprehensive characterizations, all PNEA-based passivators show good passivation results. Benefiting from Cl− passivation, PSCs with PNEACl passivation delivered reduced trap density and prolonged carrier lifetime. As a result, the PNEACl-treated inverted PSCs showed a champion PCE of 21% with a VOC of 1.152 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 23.25 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 78.25% with negligible hysteresis, which is higher than that of the control device (19.7%), the PNEAI-treated PSCs (20.27%), and PNEABr-treated PSCs (20.39%). More importantly, the strong hydrophobic nature of PNEAX in favor of protecting the unencapsulated PSCs results in superior long-term stability with over 90% of the initial efficiencies maintained after storage for 1000 h in N2; meanwhile, the control PSCs lost almost 23% of the initial PCE values under the same conditions.

Fig. 1a shows the molecular design strategy and chemical structures of PNEAI, PNEABr, and PNEACl. Compared with commonly used PEAI, two major optimizations have been made for better interfacial passivation. Considering the beneficial effects of the Lewis base for passivating uncoordinated Pb2+, an extra N atom has been introduced to the backbone of the bulk cation. Another optimization is focused on the substitution of halogen counter anions. It has been proven in previous reports that different halogens besides iodine have some unique properties, including improving the morphology, tuning the electronic properties and passivating surface defects. Unfortunately, few research studies have been carried out to systematically investigate the impact of different halogen anions on passivation properties. Therefore, we synthesized a series of PNEAX-based passivators to find out the underneath mechanism. The detailed synthesis procedures and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) characterizations are available in the supporting information (ESI,† Fig. S1–S3). Generally, a simple acid–base neutralization reaction was conducted between PEA and hydriodic acid, hydrobromic acid, or hydrochloric acid. It is also worth noting that acid reacts with the primary amine (R-NH2) rather than the secondary amine (R2-NH) group due to a stronger reaction activity, which is clearly evidenced by 1H NMR peaks.

The calculated electrostatic surface potential and dipole moment of PEA+ and PNEA+ using the Gaussian 16 program are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Compared with PEA+, PNEA+ shows stronger electron polarization and a bigger dipole moment (17.65 Debye versus 13.64 Debye), which is beneficial for better interfacial passivation.9 The photophysical properties of the films after surface treatment were investigated. No significant changes were observed in the absorption spectra, indicating that post-processing did not affect the bulk structure of the perovskite (Fig. 1b). Compared with the reference perovskite film, PNEACl, PNEABr, and PNEAI passivated perovskite films have no obvious peak shift or additional peaks in XRD characterization, indicating that the PNEAX passivation strategy did not affect the perovskite structure (Fig. 1d). The larger and flatter crystals of the PNEACl passivated perovskite films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (ESI,† Fig. S5).
To investigate the interactions between the passivators and perovskite films, and to find out the chemical reasons for the passivation effect, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed (shown in Fig. 2). The C 1s XPS spectrum showed a distinct CO peak (288.3 eV) in the reference perovskite film, which indicated a chemical reaction between the organic components and adsorbed oxygen/water molecules.10 Compared with the reference, the intensity of the signal from films treated was significantly decreased, indicating that PNEAX can significantly insulate active components in the environment.11 In Fig. 2b, the strong C–N peak (400.45 eV) is attributed to FA+ ions in perovskite.12 New peaks of CN (402.42 eV) and C–NH–C (399.8 eV) appeared in the films treated with ammonium halide salts, which were related to the PNEA+ cation in the passivators. For the Pb 4f results, Pb0 peaks at 141.6 eV and 136.9 eV can be found in the pristine perovskite films, confirming the existence of undercoordinated Pb2+ ions. These undercoordinated ions may act as non-radiative recombination centers and reduce device performance. In order to achieve defect-free perovskite films, Pb0 must be removed. The perovskite films treated with PNEAX show significantly weakened Pb0 peaks. As illustrated in Fig. 2c, the films passivated by PNEACl showed a higher binding energy (138.5 eV) for Pb2+ than the reference (138.3 eV). The improvement in binding energy was due to the stronger binding energy between Pb2+ and Cl−. The electronegativity of Cl− is stronger than that of I− and Br−, making PNEACl easier to interact with Pb2+.13 Therefore, the passivation effect of PNEACl is expected to be stronger than that of PNEAI and PNEABr.

Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were conducted to investigate the carrier dynamics. As depicted in Fig. 3b, a marked PL quenching effect was observed after post-treatment with PNEAX, resulting in a decrease of about two orders of magnitude in photoluminescence intensity. In Fig. 3c, the fitted average lifetimes of the perovskite films passivated with PNEACl, PNEABr, and PNEAI are 1.99 ns, 2.36 ns, and 2.25 ns, respectively, while that of the control perovskite film is 4.6 ns. Since the perovskite layer was deposited on PTAA, the quenched PL intensities as well as shortened TRPL lifetime highlight the good passivation of PNEAX. Generally, the passivated perovskite with much fewer traps and defects at the interface and grain boundary will favor carrier extraction and transfer.

(e) Stabilized power outputs for control and PNEACl-treated devices. (f) EQE profiles for control, PNEACl-, PNEABr-, and PNEAI-treated devices. 
The planar inverted PSCs were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/perovskite/PNEAX/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag. The best performing J-V curves of the PSCs with passivators and control devices under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The optimized concentration of PNEACl was found to be 1 mg mL−1. The control device showed a PCE of 19.70%, with a VOC of 1.08 V, a JSC of 23.32 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.70%. The PNEAI-treated devices exhibited a PCE of 20.27%, with a VOC of 1.12 V, a JSC of 23.07 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.46%. The PNEABr-treated devices exhibited a marginally increased PCE of 20.39%, with a VOC of 1.12 V, a JSC of 22.64 mA cm−2, and a FF of 80.60%. For comparison, the device based on PNEACl exhibited a significantly enhanced PCE of 21.01%, with an obviously improved VOC of 1.15 V, JSC of 23.31 mA cm−2, and FF of 78.10%. As shown in external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 3f), the devices treated with PNEAX showed significant improvement in the entire absorption range from 300 to 800 nm. The integrated JSC was calculated to be 23 mA cm−2, matching well with the J–V experimental data and thus further verifying the reliability of the J–V curves. In addition, we tested the steady-state power output of the standard and PNEACl devices at fixed voltages of 0.90 V and 0.96 V at the maximum power point (MPP), respectively. The PCE outputs were 18.68% and 20.03%, while the results for the PNEAI and PNEABr devices were 19.08% and 19.18%, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). Furthermore, space-charge-confined current (SCLC) measurements were performed to gain insight into the mobility and trap state density. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the J–V curves of the hole-only devices. The calculated trap state densities are 5.2 × 1015 cm−3, 3.58 × 1015 cm−3, 4.7 × 1015 cm−3, and 5.01 × 1015 cm−3 for the control, PNEACl-treated, PNEABr-treated, and PNEAI-treated films, respectively. The results for the electron-only devices (Fig. S9, ESI†) also showed the same trend, demonstrating that ammonium halides can effectively reduce the trap density of perovskites by passivating both types of ionic defects.14

Fig. 4a illustrates the dependence of Jsc on light intensity, where the device treated with PNEAX demonstrates a higher slope of 0.960–0.988 when compared to the control device (0.928), indicating that the non-radiative trap-assisted recombination is restrained by the addition of PNEAX.15 To better understand the characteristics of charge recombination, light-dependent (1–100 mW cm−2) VOC tests were performed (Fig. 4b). According to Langevin's theorem, the ideality factor (n) reveals the main types of device recombination behavior, where n = 1 represents dominant bimolecular recombination and n = 2 represents trap-assisted recombination.16 The results show that the device treated with PNEACl significantly suppresses trap-assisted recombination in the device, owing to the reduced trap density in the perovskite film compared to the control device.

The water contact angles of the control, PNEAI-, PNEABr-, and PNEACl-treated perovskite films are 42°, 63°, 65°, and 74°, respectively. The increase in the water contact angle from PNEAI to PNEABr and PNEACl suggests that the PNEACl passivator can effectively protect perovskite films from moisture permeation, thus improving the stability of perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices. To evaluate the storage stability of PSC devices, the devices were continuously stored under nitrogen (N2) conditions for 1000 hours (Fig. 4d). The PCE of the PNEAX-treated PSCs remained above 92–95% of the original values after 1000 h, while the efficiency of the control devices decreased to 76%. The PCE decrease in a N2 atmosphere may be attributed to ion immigration, element diffusion, and the unstable interface of the devices.14
In summary, a simple surface post-treatment approach using passivators PNEAX, consisting of N1-phenylethane-1,2-diamine and different halogen anions, was developed to regulate the grain boundaries of the perovskite. The role of halide on the passivation mechanism and device performance was systematically studied through spectroscopic, electronic, and device characterization. The results showed that the PNEAX post-treatment reduced the defect state density and improved the film-formation of the perovskite by reducing non-radiative recombination, resulting in enhanced efficiency and stability of PSCs. In particular, PNEACl-treated PSCs delivered a champion PCE of 21.01% with a VOC of 1.152 V, a JSC of 23.25 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.25%, which is not only higher than that of the control device (19.7%) but also higher than that of the PNEAI-treated device (20.27%) or PNEABr-treated device (20.39%). Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of PNEAX, the PNEACl-treated devices can maintain over 90% of the initial value after storage for 1000 h in a N2 atmosphere without any encapsulation, while the control device lost almost 23% of its initial PCE under the same exposure conditions. This work presents an effective surface post-treatment strategy to achieve interface regulation and produce high-performance and stable inverted PSCs.
