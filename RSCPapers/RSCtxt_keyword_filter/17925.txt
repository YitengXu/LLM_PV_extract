    , Accepted 25th May 2018First published on 28th May 2018AbstractIn this paper, we report a new class of triphenylamine-based sensitizers with different anchoring groups to rationalize the effects of the anchoring group on the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of these sensitizers in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The photophysical properties of the TPACA, TPARN and TPASA sensitizers were recorded in acetonitrile solvent. DSSCs based on TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated using these dyes. A TPACA chromophore-based DSSC containing triphenylamine as a donor group and cyanoacetic acid as an anchoring group connected by a π-linkage produced a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.8%, a short circuit current Jsc = 11.92 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage Voc = 0.702 V and a fill factor FF = 0.716. This enhanced efficiency of the TPACA chromophore-based DSSC is attributed to the presence of a strong electron withdrawing cyanoacetic acid anchoring group. The electron transfer kinetics was investigated by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). All three chromophores, TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA, were extensively studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to correlate the effects of the anchoring modifications with their absorptions and photoconversion efficiencies.
Introduction
In the past two and half decades, attention has been paid to clean renewable energy sources to address the scarcity of energy resources and the issue of environmental pollution.1 In 1991, Grätzel and O’Regan first reported ruthenium-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.9%,2 which increased the momentum of solar cell research.3–6 Researchers have synthesized ruthenium-based sensitizers with remarkable PCEs;7–10 however, dyes incorporated in DSSCs still face various issues, such as heavy metal toxicity,11 environmental impact,12 high cost,13 low molar extinction coefficients13 and difficult purification processes.14
To overcome the limitations of ruthenium-based sensitizers, metal-free organic sensitizers have been recently developed.15–18 These have the benefits of being inexpensive19 and eco-friendly,20 with high molar absorption coefficients,21,22 tuneable spectral electrochemical properties23 and facile synthetic approaches.24 Generally, DSSCs are constructed with a photoanode, a dye as the light absorber, and a counter electrode. Dyes constructed with sensitizers play a crucial role in obtaining high PCEs.25 An ideal sensitizer should contain a typical donor–π–acceptor chromophore with an anchoring group with a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level above the conduction band of TiO2, with efficient electron injection, and a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level below the redox potential of the electrolyte, with effective dye regeneration.26–28 Some efficient donor moieties in DSSCs have been constructed with coumarins,29,30 merocyanines,31,32 cyanines,33 indoles,23,34 triphenylamines,12,35–38 triarylamines,39 thiophenes,40 carbazoles,41,42 phenothiazines,43,44 julolidine45 and phenoxazines.46 Among these donors, triphenylamine (TPA) is extensively used in DSSCs due to their favourable electronic structures and exceptional light capturing capabilities.47,48 TPA attached to cyanoacetic acid to form TPA-1 shows 3.3% efficiency, which is lower than those of TPACA and TPARN.47,48 Zeng W. et al. reported the best TPA-based sensitizer, with an efficiency of 8.9%.49
Along with the electron donor moiety, the anchoring group plays a significant role in DSSC performance.50–53 The sensitizer covalently bonded on the TiO2 surface with the aid of anchoring groups shows strong coupling and good device stability.54,55 Usually, a functionalized carboxylic acid conjugated with an electron withdrawing group is used as the standard accepting group.56–60 Cyanoacetic acid is the preferred acceptor and has been used in many sensitizers.40,61,62 Other successful reported anchoring groups are rhodanine-3-acetic acid, sulfonic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid, phosphoric acid, acid chloride, ester, and salicylic acid.63,64 The anchoring group rhodanine-3-acetic acid has extended π-conjugation and hence shows a red shift; however, cyanoacetic acid favours better properties in DSSCs because of its co-planarity with respect to the spacer unit and its good electron combination with TiO2.65 In 2015, Adhikari et al. demonstrated that Schiff bases are superior anchoring groups to cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine-3-acetic acid.34 The importance of the hydroxy group as a lateral anchoring group along with the carboxylic group was demonstrated by Faliang Gou et al.66 This lateral anchoring group enhances the adsorption of dye on TiO2, which results in a better charge transfer rate.67
In this paper, we utilized the Schiff base 4-aminosalicylic acid as an anchoring group for the first time to explore the superiority of Schiff bases over conventional anchoring groups along with utilization of a hydroxy group as a lateral anchoring group. To elucidate the structural correlations and photovoltaic performance of the different anchoring groups, we have synthesized three novel sensitizers containing triphenylamine-based modified donors with a chloro group suitably placed on the π-linker and cyanoacetic acid, rhodanine-3-acetic acid or 4-amino salicylic acid as the acceptor, as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). These moieties show better photovoltaic performance compared to the reported TPAC1 containing a triphenyl amine donor group and cyanoacetic acid as the anchoring group.68 The newly synthesized molecules have been characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as elemental analyses. The electronic and photophysical properties of these novel sensitizers have been studied. Their HOMO and LUMO energy level diagrams have been obtained by theoretical calculation. These TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA dyes have been used for DSSC fabrication, and their photovoltaic performance has been investigated. TPACA (5.8%) and TPARN (5.8%) were compared with their reported analogue 2a (without the Cl group on the π-bridge) to establish the impact of π-linker modification on their photophysical and photovoltaic properties.69 It is important to note that in our study, a more complex conjugated structure was not essential to obtain higher PCE; TPACA and TPARN are excellent examples. Additionally, the strategy of inserting a Cl group on the π-bridge was quite successful for the development of highly efficient D–π–A organic TPA-based sensitizers for improving Jsc, Voc, and η.
Results and discussion
Design and synthesis of sensitizers
Scheme S1 (ESI†) shows our synthetic work starting from commercially available triphenylamine and the synthetic approaches for the three sensitizers: TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA. Compound 2 was synthesized by Friedel–Crafts acylation of triphenylamine, followed by Vilsmeier–Haack formylation. Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine 3-acetic acid in the presence of piperidine or ammonium acetate afforded the sensitizers TPACA (71% yield) and TPARN (79% yield). The sensitizer TPASA was obtained in 65% yield (after silica gel column chromatography) after condensation with 4-aminosalicylic acid in ethanol. The detailed experimental procedure is given in the Experimental section.
Photophysical properties

Fig. 1 shows the absorption and emission spectra of TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA in acetonitrile (2 × 10−6 M). TPACA and TPARN show broad absorption peaks in the range of 451 to 500 nm, and TPASA shows a weak blue shifted peak in the region of 350 to 400 nm. A bathochromic shift was observed from TPASA to TPACA to TPARN, with λmax values of 369 nm, λ 462 nm, and 488 nm, respectively. The bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum of TPARN is due to the extension of the π-conjugated system and rhodanine-3-acetic acid. A sensitizer with a high molar extinction coefficient usually shows good light harvesting capability. The values of the molar extinction coefficients for TPACA, TPARN and TPASA are 23.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1, 11.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 7.03 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The high molar extinction coefficient of TPACA is due to the presence of the cyanoacrylic unit in the sensitizer. The emission spectra of the sensitizers were recorded by using their λmax wavelengths as excitation wavelengths.

Table 1 shows the absorption and emission data. The results clearly indicate that the sensitizers exhibit strong fluorescence maxima in the region of 484 to 637 nm. The sensitizer TPACA shows a fluorescence λmax value of 621 nm; this is lower than that of TPARN, which has a fluorescence λmax value of 637 nm. The lowest fluorescence λmax value of 484 nm is shown by TPASA dye. The sensitizer TPACA shows the highest Stokes shift value of 159 nm, whereas TPASA has the lowest Stokes shift value of 115 nm (Table S1, ESI†). TPACA shows a higher absorption maximum (462 nm) than its reported analogue (without a chloro group on the π-bridge).69 It was noted that among the studied three sensitizers, TPACA showed the highest Stokes shift (Table S1, ESI†).

The absorption spectra of the dyes TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA on TiO2 electrode are shown in Fig. 2. All three sensitizers show broad absorptions in the 300 to 650 nm region in the visible spectrum (Fig. 2). All three sensitizers show red shifted absorption on TiO2 films in comparison to the results obtained for their acetonitrile solutions, which is due to interaction of the anchoring groups with titanium ions on the electrode surfaces. Upon anchoring onto the TiO2 surface, the energy absorption onsets of TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA are red shifted by 48 nm, 62 nm, and 42 nm, respectively, enabling light harvesting in an extended region. The band gaps of the TPACA, TPARN and TPASA dyes were calculated from the absorption spectra to be 2.29, 2.14 and 2.99, respectively. These spectral results motivated us to determine the electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical properties of the TPACA, TPARN and TPASA sensitizers.

Electrochemical properties
We have measured the feasibility of thermodynamically allowed electron transfer from the excited state dye to the conduction band of TiO2 by photoemission yield spectrometry (Riken Keiki, AC-3E). The measured ground state and excited state oxidation potentials of the sensitizers TPACA, TPARN and TPASA are summarized in Table 1, and pictorial representations of their energy diagrams based on the absorption and electrochemical data are shown in Fig. 3. The ground-state oxidation potential, S+/0, values for TPACA, TPARN and TPASA were observed to be −5.78 eV, −6.10 eV, and −6.18 eV, respectively (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†). These Ionization potentials are sufficiently lower than the I3−/I− a couple, indicating the thermodynamic electron accepting capability of the oxidized dyes from I− ions in the electrolyte. The band gap energies E0–0 of the three sensitizers are 1.99 eV (TPACA), 1.91 eV (TPARN) and 2.25 eV (TPASA). The levels of excited state oxidation potential, S+/*, were calculated from the expression S+/* = IP − E0–0. The S+/* values of TPACA, TPARN and TPASA were calculated to be −3.79 eV, −4.19 eV and −3.93 eV, respectively. The S+/* values for all three dyes are sufficiently higher than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 film, which indicates that the excited states of these dyes are thermodynamically driven to inject electrons into the conduction band edge of TiO2.

Computational study
The optimization of the three TPA-based sensitizers in acetonitrile solvent was carried out using density functional theory, using the well-known B3LYP method70 with the 6-31G(d) basis set. B3LYP is a combination of Becke's three parameter exchange functionals (B3)71 with the nonlocal correlation functional by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP).72 The vibration frequencies of each compound in all the solvents were computed using TD-DFT calculations with the 6-31G (d) basis set. TD-DFT calculations with the B3LYP/6-31G (d) basis set were used to optimize the structure of each sensitizer in the first singlet excited state (S1) with its minimum energy geometry. Frequency computations were also carried out on the optimized geometries of the low-lying vibronically relaxed first excited states of the molecules. The polarizable continuum model (PCM)73,74 as implemented in Gaussian 09 was used for solvent optimization. The Gaussian 0975 program was used for DFT computations.
The electronic distributions in the HOMO and LUMO levels of all the sensitizers at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level and their corresponding energy gaps are shown in Fig. 4. The electron density is uniformly distributed on the TPA donor group and the π-bridge in the HOMO upon excitation in the LUMO level electron cloud, which shifts towards the anchoring groups; this results in more effective intra-molecular charge separations in TPACA and TPASA compared with TPARN (Fig. 4). The variations in the band gaps of the electrochemical data and DFT calculations are due to the energy values, which were calculated by employing the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. These states encompass a complex orbital contribution beyond that of the crude HOMO–LUMO; therefore, considering these two frontier orbitals will not provide an accurate energy gap.76,77 The delocalization of electron density from the HOMO to the LUMO levels favours the effective injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 through the carboxyl anchoring group. The optimized geometries of all the sensitizers with selected bond lengths and bond angles at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The bond angles between the nitrogen and the three phenyl rings in all the molecules are close to 120°. The bond lengths between the carbon atoms and chlorine atoms in all the sensitizers are about 1.7 Å, and the bond lengths between the spacer carbon atom and the acceptor group carbon atom are about 1.3 Å, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

The DFT-calculated electronic vertical transition energies, oscillator strengths (f), maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax) and natures of the transitions are collected in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the strongest absorption peaks for all the sensitizers are mainly related to the transition from the HOMO to the LUMO. Moreover, the maximum absorption wavelength of TPARN was remarkably red-shifted compared to those of the other TPA sensitizers; the increasing order of λmax is TPASA < TPACA < TPARN. Computationally, TPARN shows a higher absorption value than the other TPA sensitizers. This red shift in the absorption spectra of the sensitizers is desirable for harvesting the solar spectrum.

As summarized in Table 2, a moderate short-circuit current (Jsc) of 8.92 mA cm−2 was recorded for the TPACA-based DSSC in the presence of TBP; however, in the absence of TBP, Jsc increased to 11.62 mA cm−2. The Voc value for the TPACA-based DSSC decreased from 0.70 V to 0.73 V upon addition of TBP. A similar trend in the Jsc values was observed for the DSSC fabricated with TPARN dye. Without the addition of TBP, a Jsc of 12.24 mA cm−2 was observed, whereas a lower Jsc of 9.11 mA cm−2 was observed for the TPARN DSSC with the addition of 0.5% TBP. In comparison to TPACA, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the TPARN DSSC showed the lowest values with and without TBP. The addition of 0.5 mM TBP enhanced Voc for all the dyes. All the dyes showed high fill factors (FF) between 71% and 73.5%. The TPASA-based DSSCs showed the lowest photovoltaic performance regardless of TBP addition. The TPASA-based DSSC showed a Jsc of 5.19 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.62 V with a fill factor of 72%. Addition of TBP decreased Jsc to 4.77 mA cm−2 but increased Voc from 0.62 to 0.63 V. The TPACA-based DSSC showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 5.84%, the TPARN-based DSSC showed a maximum PCE of 5.86% and the TPASA-based DSSC showed a maximum PCE of 2.34% without the addition of TBP. With the addition of 0.5 mM TBP, the TPACA, TPARN and TPASA-based DSSCs showed decreased PCE values of 4.65%, 4.57%, and 2.20%, respectively. TPACA and TPARN showed greater efficiency than their reported analogue (5.30%).69
The IPCE spectra of the fabricated DSSCs with TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA are shown in Fig. 5b. All the fabricated DSSCs showed IPCE >60% in the 400 to 700 nm region. The IPCE of the TPACA DSSCs peaks at 80% within the 400 to 800 nm region. Further addition of 0.05 mM TBP decreased the IPCE to 70% in the same region. The TPARN-based DSSC showed 70% IPCE in the 450 to 700 nm region. A high onset of up to 760 nm was observed for the TPARN DSSC. Further addition of 0.05 mM TBP decreased the IPCE to 65% in the same region and reduced the onset wavelength to 680 nm. Among the fabricated DSSCs, the TPASA DSSC showed the lowest IPCE of 70% in a narrower range (400 to 580 nm). The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs based on TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA are in accord with the decreasing order of the photovoltaic performance. TBP (4-tert-butyl-pyridine) is well recognized for its influence in inhibiting the recombination of injected electrons with I3− in the electrolyte. Due to the basicity of TBP, its addition causes a decrease in the conduction band edge of TiO2. The purpose of using TBP is to cover the TiO2 surface between the dye molecules. Previously, TBP has been used to improve the performance of solar cells based on ruthenium dyes.27 According to these results, both the Joc values and FFs increased significantly upon addition of TBP, while the Jsc values slightly decreased; therefore, the efficiencies of the TPACA-T0 and TPARN-T0 dyes were greater than those of the TPACA-T0.5 and TPARN-T0.5 dyes. The IPCE spectra in Fig. 5b show the differences in IPCE between the three dyes, which indicate that the photocurrent action spectrum for TPACA is higher than that of the other sensitizers.
CEM and IMVS characterization
In order to understand the differences between the Voc observed for the DSSCs based on TPACA, TPARN and TPASA, the relative conduction band positions of TiO2 were investigated by means of the charge extraction method (CEM). As shown in Fig. 6, the DSSCs sensitized with TPACA, TPARN and TPASA showed similar linear increases in electron density as a function of Voc, which indicates that the respective cells, regardless of their different molecular dye structures, have the same conduction band edge of TiO2. The electron lifetime (τ) in DSSCs is an essential factor to determine the charge recombination rate of injected electrons in TiO2 with I3− in the electrolyte; it is ideally correlated with the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the overall device. We measured the electron lifetimes by intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). Fig. 7 plots the electron lifetimes (τ) of the DSSCs as a function of Voc. It is clear that at a fixed Voc, the lifetime increases in the order of TPASA < TPARN < TPACA, which is in accord with the order of increasing Voc observed in the fabricated DSSCs. The longer lifetime observed for the TPACA-based DSSC compared to those based on TPARN and TPASA clearly reveals that the TPACA sensitizer sufficiently surpassed the recombination of the electrons in the TiO2 film with I3− in the electrolyte. In the TPACA-based DSSC, the sensitizer most likely arrayed regularly and formed blocking layers on the TiO2 surface to suppress the electron recombination. The close packing of the TPACA dye is in good accord with the broader absorbance on the TiO2 film compared to the TPARN and TPASA dyes (Fig. 2).

Transient absorption study
In order to obtain efficient charge injection from the π*-orbitals in the anchoring groups of the TPACA, TPARN and TPASA dyes to the titanium 3d-orbitals, good overlap of these orbitals is required. This overlap also has great effects on the charge transfer kinetics and electrical performance of a DSSC. Investigating these kinetics will indicate the strength of the anchoring system. For this, we used nanosecond laser flash photolysis (Eidenburg LP920) to investigate and collaborate the transient kinetics of waste recombination routes and dye regeneration by electrolyte among the dyes with their respective DSSC performance parameters and electronic levels. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis is an ideal tool for investigating DSSC interfacial kinetics and is considered to be a crucial step for investigating DSSC performance.9,78–80
The transient absorption signals, ΔOD, shown in Fig. 8 represent either the concentration of oxidized dye sensitizer (positive ΔOD) or the concentration of the bleached ground state of the dye sensitizer (negative ΔOD; both have the same decay lifetime) following electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. To fit the transient decay graphs, a good approach involves a quantitative comparison of the data for the different dyes with and without electrolytes.81 Instead, we used the weighted average of logarithmic lifetimes from a biexponential fit to the data:log〈τ〉 = ∑Ailog(τi)where Ai is the fractional amplitude for each component related to the excited state relaxation, recombination or dye regeneration.
 Fig. 8  Transient absorbance decay profiles obtained upon nanosecond pulsed laser excitations (bandwidth 6 ns) on mesoporous TiO2 (7 μm) films sensitized with TPACA, TPARN and TPASA dyes at a laser excitation of 470 nm and monitored at 550 to 680 nm in the presence and in the absence of LiI/I2 electrolyte (Dyesol high performance electrolyte, ELHP; no TBP added). 
The absorption decays of the inert electrolyte (Fig. 8) in acetonitrile show half-times (τ1/2) of 8.8, 13.6 and 39.7 μs, indicating the waste recombination kinetics of the charges injected into the TiO2 conduction band with the oxidative dyes TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA, respectively. After addition of redox electrolyte, the fitting of the decays clearly led to faster dye regeneration half-times (τ1/2) of 2.3, 3.6 and 9.7 μs. This proves efficient dye regeneration by the electrolyte redox system of the above organic dyes, respectively; thus, good prevention of electron recombination with the oxidized dyes can be achieved, allowing good collection of photoinjected electrons into the external circuit, as shown by the PV performance (Table 2).
In addition, Daeneke et al.82 have established that quantitative dye regeneration (theoretical regeneration yield of 99.9%) can be achieved with a driving force of 20 to 25 kJ mol−1 (ΔE ≈ 0.20 to 0.25 V). Based on the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) shown in Fig. 3, all the respective dyes present driving forces higher than 0.25 V with respect to the redox potential of I−/I3− (around −5.20 V vs. vacuum). Thus, a much higher driving force (more than 0.25 V vs. vacuum), even for a lower performing DSSC such as that based on TPASA dye, would not necessarily have an effect because above 0.25 V, the dye regeneration process is diffusion controlled.82 Thus, the lower performance measured for the TPASA dye compared to the others does not originate from the lower anchoring of 4-amino salicylic acid with TiO2 but from the lower absorbance overlap through the visible light spectrum. In light of this fact, dye regeneration times recorded in presence of electrolyte do corroborate with the driving forces and with measured respective Jsc.
Experimental
Materials and methods
All commercial reagents and solvents were purchased from S. D. Fine Chemicals Pvt. Ltd Mumbai and were used without purification. The reactions were monitored by TLC using 0.25 mm silica gel 60 F254 percolated plates which were visualized with UV light. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a VARIAN 500 MHz instrument (USA; TMS was used as an internal standard). The UV visible absorption spectra of the compounds were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 25 spectrometer, and the emission spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. Transient absorption spectra were recorded using an LP920 laser flash photolysis spectrometer (Edinburg) associated with a Continuum Nd:YAG laser (Surelite; 10 Hz repetition rate; fwhm 5 ns). The dye absorption amounts on TiO2 films with 15 μm thickness were estimated to be 1.04 × 10−7, 1.03 × 10−7 and 1.02 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA, respectively; the three values are almost equal.
Synthesis

Fabrication and measurement of DSSCs
A double-layer TiO2-based semiconductor photoelectrode with a thickness of 15 μm and an area of 0.25 cm2 was used to prepare the DSSCs. A 10 μm main transparent layer and a 5 μm scattering layer of titania (particle size ∼400 nm) were screen-printed on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrate. A Surfcom 1400A surface profiler from Tokyo Seimitsu Co. Ltd was used to determine the thicknesses of the TiO2 films. These films were further sintered at 500 °C for 1 h and treated with 0.1 M HCl solution before usage. A dye solution in acetonitrile was used to coat the TiO2 film with the respective dye. A deoxycholic acid solution with a concentration of 20 mM was added to the dye solution as a co-adsorbent; this helped to reduce aggregation of the dye molecules on to the TiO2 surface. The adsorption of dye was carried out by immersing the electrodes in the dye solutions for 15 h at 25 °C. The sandwich-type sealed cell configuration was prepared by using two electrodes for photovoltaic measurements. The TiO2 electrode containing a monolayer of sensitizer adsorbed on the surface acted as the working electrode, while a platinum-coated conductive glass was used as the counter electrode. A 40 μm thick Surlyn spacer was used to separate the two electrodes and was sealed by heating the polymer frame. The photovoltaic performance of TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA was determined using the following electrolyte composition. Electrolyte 1 contained a mixture of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine in the acetonitrile used for the fabrication. The current–voltage spectra were measured under standard AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-155S 10: Wacom Denso Co. Japan). The photovoltaic characteristics were measured using incident light of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 in direct current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki).
Conclusions
Herein, we have employed novel metal-free organic sensitizers TPACA, TPARN and TPASA with the TPA group as an electron donor unit and a π-conjugation system, but with different designed and synthesized electron anchoring groups: 2-cyanoacrylic acid, rhodanine-3-acetic acid, and 4-amino salicylic acid. Their electrochemical and optical properties were determined, structural characterizations were performed, and device fabrication studies were carried out. It is important to note that the absorption maxima were red shifted in the order of TPASA < TPACA < TPARN due to the longer π-conjugation in TPARN due to the presence of rhodamine-3-acetic acid. A significant trend in the molar extinction coefficients was observed in the order of TPASA < TPARN < TPACA; the sensitizer TPACA had a higher molar extinction coefficient than the other sensitizers. The photovoltaic characteristics showed that TPACA and TPARN exhibit higher short circuit current densities of about 11.69 mA cm−2 and 12.23 mA cm−2, respectively, compared with TPASA. Higher power conversion efficiencies at 0% TBP of 5.84%, 5.86%, and 2.33% were obtained for TPACA, TPARN, and TPASA, respectively. IMVS studies show that the electron lifetime increases in the order TPASA < TPARN < TPACA, which is in accord with the order of increasing Voc observed in the fabricated DSSCs. Transient absorption studies show that the sensitizer regeneration times recorded in the presence of electrolyte correlate well with the driving forces. These results show that TPACA and TPARN are promising candidates in the development of DSSCs.
