    , Accepted 7th September 2021First published on 7th September 2021AbstractA conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), is often used as a counter electrode in low-cost dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). However, its low electrocatalytic activity causes a low fill factor, leading to a decrease in photoconversion efficiency. Here, a PEDOT:PSS solution and silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) were mixed uniformly to form a PEDOT:PSS/Si NP electrocatalyst. In order to attain higher electrocatalytic activity, both the particle size and amount of Si NPs were controlled, and their effect on the electrocatalytic activity was investigated. Their electrocatalytic characteristics were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Finally, a DSSC based on the PEDOT:PSS/Si NP electrocatalyst containing 120 mg of Si NPs achieved an efficiency of 6.645% under standard solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. The performance was comparable to that of a conventional DSSC based on a Pt electrocatalyst.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been studied since Grätzel and O’Regan first reported a dye-sensitized colloidal TiO2 film in 1991.1,2 Their low cost, simple fabrication, polychrome nature and transparency are very advantageous for a wide array of applications, including building integrated photovoltaics.3–9 The principal steps of the conversion from photons to electricity are: (1) photoexcitation of dye by photon absorption; (2) injection and transportation of electrons in the TiO2 network; (3) electrocatalytic reaction between the counter electrode and electrolyte; (4) dye regeneration by electron supply from the electrolyte.3,5,6,10 The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs is determined mainly by light utilization and the electron-transport capability of the dye-sensitized photo electrode. Thus, many studies have concentrated on photo electrodes. However, the counter electrode also has a primary role in overall performance because the fill factor (FF) of DSSCs has a close relationship with the electrocatalytic reaction from I− to I3−.6,11–13 In addition, inexpensive materials can contribute to cost-competitive solar cells because the most used electrocatalyst, platinum (Pt), is rare and expensive.14,15 Therefore, there is a significant need to develop Pt-free DSSCs. Some researchers have studied alternative materials to Pt and promising candidates, such as transition-metal compounds (TMCs), carbon, and polymers, have been derived.16–20 Some materials exhibited good electrocatalytic characteristics and photovoltaic performance, but most of the reported materials were inferior to Pt. Hence, some scholars tried to derive a synergetic effect of binary or ternary combinations, such as carbon–polymer, polymer–TMC, and TMC–carbon,21–27 because combined materials could compensate for the limitations or disadvantages of each material. Among them, a combination of polymer and particles (carbon or TMCs) elicited a good performance relatively easily because liquid polymers have smooth interconnections between particles. This combination aims to increase the electrocatalytic interface and electrocatalytic characteristics of both materials. Therefore, most related studies, in general, have used TMC particles due to their electrocatalytic properties, but studies based on other materials (except for TMCs) are lacking. Here, we had an interest in metalloids, not TMCs. If a polymer has good electrocatalytic properties, the main role of particles is an increase in the electrocatalytic interface rather than its own electrocatalytic properties. Therefore, non- or less electrocatalytic materials could also be applied in a binary combination, and we need to expand the range up to metalloids or non-metals. We introduced silicon (Si) as a composite material of a polymer-based electrocatalyst. Si is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust and its photovoltaic application is very familiar. An electrocatalytic nanocomposite was prepared by a combination of polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and Si nanoparticles (NPs). PEDOT:PSS is one of the most reported polymeric materials for the counter electrode of DSSCs, but the strong acid PSS can cause problems with some materials. However, the proposed composite would not be troublesome because Si has good tolerance to acids. In the present study, the particle size and amount of Si NPs were controlled to analyze the effect of addition of Si NPs on the electrocatalytic properties of PEDOT:PSS and photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. To investigate the electrocatalytic and photovoltaic properties of DSSCs, current–voltage (I–V) characteristics, incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were evaluated.
2. Experimental
DSSCs were fabricated by a standard procedure.6,28 Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (TEC7, Sigma-Aldrich) with surface resistance of 7 Ω sq−1. Were used for the counter electrode and photo electrode. They were cut into size 16 × 13 mm2 and washed successively by acetone, ethanol and distilled water in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP, Solaronix) was coated on the cleaned FTO substrates using the doctor-blade method and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Coating and sintering processes were repeated, and the nanoporous TiO2 layer had a thickness of ∼10 μm. Afterwards, the FTO/TiO2 electrode was soaked in a N719 dye solution (0.2 mM) for 18 h. The dye-sensitized photo electrode of FTO/TiO2/dye was prepared after extra dye molecules were removed by rinsing with ethanol. To fabricate counter electrodes, we arranged Si NPs with diameters of 25, 40, 60 and 100 nm. They were mixed with 1 ml of PEDOT:PSS dispersion (PH-1000, Heraeus), 20 wt% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Yoneyama), and one drop of 2-[4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl)phenoxy]ethanol (Amersham Biosciences) by a conditioning mixer (AR-100, Thinky). The mixing condition was revolution at 400 rpm with rotation at 1000 rpm for 180 s. Mixtures of PEDOT:PSS and Si NPs were spin-coated on the cleaned FTO substrate at a spinning speed of 4000 rpm for 60 s (ACT-220D, Active Co. Ltd.) Then, they were heated at 220 °C for 10 min. Pt counter electrodes were fabricated by spin-coating a chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) solution (10 mM) in isopropanol on the FTO substrate with a rotating speed of 3000 rpm for 60 s and annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. The photo electrode and counter electrode were sealed by a thermoplastic sealing film (Meltonix 1170-60, Solaronix). Finally, the iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte (which consisted of 0.5 M LiI, 50 mM I2, and 0.5 M 4-tertbutylpyridine in acetonitrile) was injected through pre-drilled hole of the counter electrode.
Before the evaluation of photovoltaic properties, electrolyte penetrated into nanopores while complete DSSCs were kept under dark and open-circuit conditions for 24 h. I–V characteristics were measured under irradiation of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) by a potentiostat (SP-150, Bio-Logic Science Instruments). Electrocatalytic activity was evaluated by CV in a potential range from −1 V to 1 V. Scanning started from 0 V and returned through 1 V and −1 V a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. EIS was measured in the frequency range 5 × 105 Hz to 10−1 Hz. IPCE (SM-250-P1, Bunkoukeiki) was characterized in the wavelength range 250 nm to 800 nm. Surface morphology and the cross-section of PEDOT:PSS/Si NP films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a SU6600 system (Hitachi) with an operating voltage of 10 kV. The I–V characteristic data of DSSCs were used to draw the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), FF, and overall efficiency.6
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the J–V characteristic curves of DSSCs based on the counter electrodes of Pt and PEDOT:PSS with and without DMSO. As described in the Experimental section, 20 wt% of DMSO was added to the PEDOT:PSS solution. DMSO addition is very effective for electrical improvement of PEDOT:PSS films.13,29 The DMSO-modified PEDOT:PSS electrocatalyst exhibited an increase in the photocurrent and FF of DSSCs. Its performance, which was defined by VOC = 0.714 V, JSC = 12.491 mA cm−2, FF = 0.546, and efficiency = 4.872%, was higher than that of the pristine PEDOT:PSS electrocatalyst, for which VOC = 0.714 V, JSC = 11.817 mA cm−2, FF = 0.471, and efficiency = 3.974%. However, it was inferior to the performance of DSSC with a Pt electrocatalyst, which revealed VOC = 0.724 V, JSC = 12.598 mA cm−2, FF = 0.732, and efficiency = 6.678%. The power potentials of the Pt and PEDOT:PSS electrocatalysts were not significantly different (1.825 and 1.784 mVA, respectively). However, the FF showed a very distinct difference. TiO2, dye, and electrolyte were identical regardless of electrocatalysts, so they had same absorptive characteristics and redox potential, which resulted in similar values for JSC and VOC. That, their different values for FF obviously arose from different electrocatalysts.
 Fig. 1  
J–V characteristic curves of DSSCs based on the counter electrode of Pt and PEDOT:PSS with and without DMSO. 
Electrocatalytic analyses verified the difference clearly. Fig. 2 shows CV of DSSCs based on Pt and PEDOT:PSS electrocatalysts. In the CVs of the DSSCs, the positive and negative domains characterize dye regeneration between the dye and electrolyte, and the electrocatalytic reaction between the counter electrode and electrolyte, respectively. The peak values in both domains indicate the redox and electrocatalytic activities. In the negative domain of the CV, the peak of PEDOT:PSS is much lower than that of Pt, clearly indicating that PEDOT:PSS has relatively low electrocatalytic properties and slow electrocatalytic reaction. Slow injection of charge from the counter electrode to the electrolyte slowed the entire charge circulation. It also affected the reduction in the positive peak and, consequently, resulted in a decrease in FF.

A flat PEDOT:PSS film brings about a very narrow electrocatalytic interface, and this is one of the important reasons for a low electrocatalytic property. To achieve an increase in the electrocatalytic interface, Si NPs were introduced into the PEDOT:PSS layer. We prepared Si NPs of diameter size 25, 40, 60, and 100 nm to study the effect of particle size. Each 20 mg of Si NPs was mixed with 1 ml of DMSO-modified PEDOT:PSS. Fig. 3 and Table 1 show the J–V characteristics and photovoltaic properties of DSSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS/Si NP counter electrode depending on different sizes of Si NPs. VOC (which is not affected by the counter electrode) was similar irrespective of the size of Si NPs. FF fluctuated according to the size of Si NPs. Their different electrocatalytic properties were verified from the CV and EIS results shown in Fig. 4(a and b). A negative CV peak was increased with a particle size up to 60 nm but it decreased with a size of Si NPs of 100 nm. According to EIS, Z1 impedance (which is closely related to the electrocatalytic property of the counter electrode) was similar regardless of the particle size. The resistive elements were 5.59, 6.03, 5.96, and 6.82 Ω with sizes of Si NPs of 25, 40, 60, and 100 nm, respectively. We concluded that different particle sizes led to different pore sizes and electrocatalytic interfaces, which resulted in a change in the electrocatalytic characteristics and photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.

Although we achieved an enhanced performance of 5.455% efficiency with optimum-sized Si NPs, it was lower than that of conventional DSSCs based on the Pt electrocatalyst. To achieve higher efficiency, the amount of 60 nm-sized Si NPs was varied from 20 mg to 140 mg in 1 ml of DMSO-modified PEDOT:PSS solution. Here, Si NPs >140 mg were not prepared because an extremely viscous mixture could not be deposited uniformly. The J–V characteristic curves are shown in Fig. 5. Different amounts of Si NPs were sufficient to affect the electrocatalytic interface and property, and photovoltaic performance. VOC was almost constant in the range 0.721 V to 0.725 V. However, the photocurrent and FF were quite different according to the amount of Si NPs. The photocurrent changed in the range 12.480 mA cm−2 to 13.667 mA cm−2 and FF varied from 0.603 to 0.692. This change in performance was verified from their CV and EIS results (Fig. 6a and b). In the CVs, their negative peaks increased clearly with the amount of Si NPs. The electrocatalytic interface between the counter electrode and electrolyte was increased significantly, which result in an enhancement of electrocatalytic properties. The increase in the electrocatalytic interface was also verified from SEM images. Fig. 7 shows SEM images and the thickness of PEDOT:PSS/Si NP films according to the amount of Si NPs. Addition of Si NPs of 20 and 40 mg was not enough to cover the FTO substrate fully, which led to an insufficient electrocatalytic interface. Si NPs >60 mg exhibited good coverage, a porous structure, and uniform distribution of Si NPs in the whole area of the counter electrode was noted. EIS also helped to explain the electrocatalytic enhancement. A low electrocatalytic property led to late electron injection from the counter electrode to the electrolyte and enlarged the first semicircle (impedance Z1). Also, this charge stagnation consequently slowed down dye regeneration and enlarged the second semicircle because there were insufficient I− in the electrolyte. Addition of Si NPs was very effective for electrocatalytic enhancement. The electrochemical impedance of DSSCs decreased continuously with an increasing amount of Si NPs. In particular, the second semicircle was decreased significantly and, finally, became similar to that of conventional DSSCs. These electrocatalytic and electrochemical enhancements were well-matched to the photovoltaic performance Table 2.

Finally, conventional DSSCs and proposed DSSCs were compared using IPCE (Fig. 8). Overall, IPCE was increased in DSSCs based on the polymer electrocatalyst with >120 mg of Si NPs. It was higher than that of conventional DSSCs. There are two main factors in which Si NPs may affect IPCE: (i) excitation of Si NPs; (ii) light scattering on the counter electrode. If excitation occurs, IPCE should be observed at >800 nm because the bandgap energy of 60 nm-sized Si NPs is almost identical to that of bulk Si (1.17 eV).30,31 However, IPCE data in the wavelength region >800 nm are lacking. Therefore, we concluded that the increase in IPCE was due to light scattering by the PEDOT:PSS/Si NP counter electrode.

4. Conclusions
Application of PEDOT:PSS as a counter electrode contributes to creation of low-cost DSSCs using a simple procedure. However, its low electrocatalytic activity reduces the FF, thereby resulting in lowered efficiency. To enhance the electrocatalytic properties, we introduced Si NPs of various particle sizes and amounts to the PEDOT:PSS counter electrode. Si NPs of size 60 nm and amount 120 mg improved the performance of DSSCs considerably (especially FF) by enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of the PEDOT:PSS counter electrode and better light scattering. Consequently, DSSCs based on the best PEDOT:PSS/Si NP composite exhibited a VOC of 0.721 V, JSC of 13.667 mA cm−2, FF of 0.674 and overall efficiency of 6.645%. This performance is comparable to that of a conventional DSSC based on a Pt counter electrode. These results demonstrate that PEDOT:PSS/Si NP composite can be used as a good alternative to expensive Pt electrocatalysts.
