    , Accepted 31st March 2011First published on 28th April 2011AbstractSynthetic fuels produced from CO2/H2O are an attractive alternative energy carrier. Here we demonstrate a novel strategy to electrochemically convert CO2/H2O into hydrocarbon in a single step in an oxygen-ion conducting solid oxide electrolyser. Methane was directly synthesized in an efficient electrolyser with configuration of (anode) (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3−δ/YSZ/La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ (cathode) by combining coelectrolysis of CO2/H2O and in situ Fischer–Tropsch-type synthesis. We demonstrate a high Faradaic yield of CO/H2 and lower methane yield, which shows that the limit on conversion efficiency comes from the heterogeneous catalysis process. Electrochemical results also show that the electrochemical reduction of La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ cathode is the main process at low electrical voltages while the coelectrolysis is the main process at high voltages.

Broader context
Growing concerns over the consequences of the global climate change are forcing a major shift in the energy portfolio from the current dominance of fossil fuels towards a rich and diverse mix of energy supply based upon renewable and environmentally benign sources. Emerging technologies e.g. solar photovoltaics and fuel cells represent the recent technical breakthroughs in harnessing renewable energy while enabling a decreasing/zero level of carbon emission. However, the progressive move to the decarbonized forms of fuels, hydrogen as the most important example, is seriously impeded by the economic challenge from the unbalanced costs in all aspects of the hydrogen cycle including production, storage, transmission and distribution. In the short and medium terms, hydrocarbon fuels appear to be the ideal energy carriers in adapting the world to sustainable synthetic fuels. Direct synthesis of methane, the major component of natural gas, through an electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is demonstrated in the present work by utilizing a solid oxide electrolyser. This new strategy in producing synthetic hydrocarbon fuels can deliver a carbon neutral renewable energy cycle.

Introduction
There are growing concerns over the acceleration of global warming and the serious consequences of climate change due to the massive carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere arising from the production and consumption of fossil fuels.1,2 A diversified energy system with wider access to renewable energies as well as highly efficient clean technologies for the use of petrochemical resources must be developed to incrementally reduce our heavy reliance on fossil fuels. So far, significant efforts have been devoted to the developments of sustainable energy harvesting technologies, such as solid oxide fuel cells,3–5 direct carbon fuel cells,6,7 wind energy,8 solar panels9etc. At present, hydrogen is the only renewable energy carrier that can be synthesized efficiently; however, technical barriers related to its storage and distribution have contributed to the resistance that hydrogen has encountered in becoming practically viable despite a high energy density and zero carbon emission. Synthetic hydrocarbon fuels have therefore been proposed as an alternative form of energy carrier taking into account that they would be compatible with the existing energy infrastructures in addition to their inherent advantages, such as high H/C ratio and the flexibility found in hydrocarbon-based power.10 Traditional large-scale production of hydrocarbon resources is via the well established Fischer–Tropsch process while the precursor gases (CO + H2) are mainly derived from coal gasifications.11 Synthesis of hydrocarbon fuels or their precursor syngas from CO2/H2O would be an effective approach in accessing a new form of energy carrier and enabling a carbon neutron cycle.
Solid oxide electrolysers have been attracting great interest due to their high efficiency in converting electrical energy into chemical energy.12,13 They can exploit available heat streams to maximize electrical efficiency and operate at higher temperatures offering both thermodymic and kinetic advantages. We have recently demonstrated the successful electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CH4 and CO in a solid oxide electrolyser based on proton conducting electrolyte BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3−δ.14 Steam was oxidized in the anode and simultaneously split into oxygen and protons under external electrical voltages. Generated protons then diffuse across the electrolyte membrane to the cathode where the hydrocarbon CH4 was directly generated at the three-phase boundary. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CO was found to be the dominant process in the presence of protons. Direct synthesis of CH4 from CO2/H2O in a single reaction step is a significant step towards a potential renewable energy supply with net zero carbon dioxide emission, however, the Faraday yield of CH4 was still quite low.

        Oxygen-ion conducting solid oxide electrolysers are able to electrolyze steam into hydrogen and oxygen and carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen using external electricity.12,15 At the cathode, CO2 and H2O molecules are reduced to CO and hydrogen, respectively, and O2− ions which are transported through the oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte to the anode where O2 is released. Hydrogen species produced can react with produced CO directly giving rise to synthetic hydrocarbon fuels in the presence of appropriate metal catalysts. On the other hand, most reported high temperature electrolysis has been done based on currently preferred Ni/YSZ cathode, however, Ni cermet requires an operating atmosphere with a significantly high concentration of H2, to prevent itself from being oxidized to NiO.16–21 Not only would this cause a loss of electronic conductivity but is also likely to lead to mechanical failure of the electrode.22,23 We have recently demonstrated the efficient H2O and CO2 electrolysis based on pervoskite (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3−δ (LSCM)24 cathode without flowing reducing gases, however, the p-type conduction mechanism of LSCM is not ideally adapted to the strong reducing potential which leads to large electrode polarization resistance.12,15 The perovskite LaxSr1-xTiO3+δ (LST) is an active and redox stable material and has attracted considerable attention in the high temperature solid oxide fuel cell field.25–27 The n-type conduction mechanism of LST upon reduction would therefore well fit the strongly reducing conditions in cathode and results in better electrode performances.
Here we attempt to directly synthesize hydrocarbons, such as methane, in an oxygen-ion conducting solid oxide electrolyser by combining coelectrolysis of CO2/H2O and in situ Fischer–Tropsch process. As shown in Fig. 1, the single electrochemical cell utilizes a 0.7 mm-thick 8YSZ disc as electrolyte. A 20-μm-thick composite cathode based on La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ (LST) (50 wt%) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2−δ (CGO) (50 wt%), where LST mainly offers electronic conduction while CGO is to provide oxygen-ion conduction. This porous mixed conducting electro-catalyst would work well in the electrolysis conditions without flowing hydrogen as in a traditional nickel-based cathode.16–21 Porous iron catalysts were placed above the composite cathode surface to perform heterogeneous catalysis for the synthesis of hydrocarbons. A composite layer (20 μm in thickness) consisting of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3−δ (LSM) (50 wt%) and CGO (50 wt%) was used as anode.

Experimental
The 0.7 mm-thick 8YSZ disc was prepared by dry-pressing288YSZ powder (Pi-Chem powder) into green disk with diameter of ∼30 mm followed by a sintering at 1350 °C for 10 h in air. The two surfaces of obtained YSZ electrolyte support were polished with sandpaper (1000 mesh), cleaned with ethanol and distilled water for several times, dried in air overnight. La0.2Sr0.8TiO3 + δ (LST) powders were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method.26,27 Briefly, La2O3, SrCO3 and TiO2 were ball-milled in acetone and then dried in air. The resulting powders were pelletized followed by a heat treatment at 1300 °C for 10 h. X-ray Diffraction was performed to check the phase purity of LST powders. The cathode slurry was prepared by mixing fine commercial Ce0.9Gd0.1O2−δ (CGO) (Pi-Chem powder) powder and LST powder with the weight ratio of 50:50 in alpha-terpineol with cellulose additive in a mortar. An anode slurry consisting of 50 wt% (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3−δ (LSM) (Pi-Chem powder) and 50 wt% CGO powders was prepared by the same method. The cathode was then screen-printed with an area of 1 cm2 followed by a heat treatment at 1050 °C for 3 h in air. The anode slurry was screen-printed onto electrolyte in symmetric position with area of 1 cm2 and sintered at 1050 °C for 3 h.29 All the temperature ramps were 2 °C min−1. Silver paste (silver conductive ink, Alfa Aesar) was printed onto both electrode surfaces and fired at 550 °C (3 °C min−1) for 30 min in air for current collections. Silver electrical wire (0.1 mm in diameter) was then connected to both current collectors using silver paste followed by firing at 550 °C (3 °C min−1) for 30 min in air.
The single solid oxide electrolyser was sealed to a home-made testing jig using ceramic paste (Aremco, Ceramabond 552). Porous iron, which was prepared by mixing iron powder (∼2 g, ∼200 mesh) and glass fibers, was directly placed onto the cathode surface to make a composite cathode catalyst straddling an appropriate temperature gradient (650–300 °C) to facilitate the heterogeneous catalysis of hydrocarbon formation and reduce the decomposition of hydrocarbon products. The LSM-based anode was exposed to static air while H2O and CO2 were supplied to the cathode. The CO2 and H2O gas flows were controlled via a mass flow meter and a syringe pump, respectively for electrochemical reduction at 650 °C under external electrical voltages. Electrochemical measurements including AC Impedance, Current–voltage (I–V) and open circuit voltage (OCV) were made using a Schlumberger Solartron 1255 Frequency Response Analyzer coupled with a 1287 Electrochemical Interface controlled by Zplot electrochemical impedance software. The output gas of cathode was connected with a U-type cooling tube in dry ice to eliminate any steam in mixed gases before being supplied into an online Prolab 300 (Thermoscientific) Mass Spectroscometer (MS). The microstructure of the as-prepared electrolyser was characterized in a scanning electron microscope (JEOL 5600) after testing.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the microstructure of cell after testing. The YSZ electrolyte support (700 μm in thickness) is quite uniform and dense. The porous cathode and anode layers with thickness of 20 μm adhere to the electrolyte very well. The porous silver current collector layer is around 5 μm in thickness. The OCVs with different input gases into cathode are shown in Table 1. The OCV with pure CO2 in cathode reaches 0.94 V in this work which is already beyond the OCVs (0.16–0.60 V) for a CO2/air concentration cell.30 Actually, we tested around ∼10 electrolysers before electrolysis to check the OCVs and found that the OCVs with CO2 in cathode were not consistent (ranging from around 0.5 to 1 V) but were stable (∼0.14 V) with H2O or H2O/CO2 in cathode. The OCVs with CO2 could be an artefact as LST cathode is not conductive enough in pure CO2 before applying electrical voltages for reduction. It should also be noted that the composite cathode contains fine iron metal powder, hence there will be a chemical potential as the absence of oxygen in the gas stream means that Fe will be long enough lived in CO2 to result in high OCVs. In contrast, the OCVs reached around 0.14 V with H2O and CO2/H2O (2:1) in this work indicating higher oxygen concentration in cathode caused by the thermal splitting of steam at high temperatures. At this point, the electrochemical cell is indeed a oxygen-concentration cell; and the OCV mainly comes from the oxygen concentration potential across two electrodes.

Fig. 3 shows the measurement of current density versus applied voltages for coelectrolysis at 650 °C. The OCV is around 0.14 V coming from the oxygen concentration gradient across both electrodes. The I–V curve (current - voltage) is non-linear with a clear change in slope at around 1.4 V, where the onset of H2/CO production can be anticipated. The calculated cell resistance from I–V curve above 1.4 V is around ∼9–10 Ω·cm2 while the cell resistance is much larger and reaches around 20–30 Ω·cm2 at low voltages. The expected ionic resistance of such a YSZ pellet is around 6 Ω·cm2 at 650 °C.31 Therefore, the I–V slope below 1.4 V demonstrates the large contribution of electrode polarization resistances, while ionic resistance of YSZ electrolyte contributes largely to the total cell resistance at higher potentials. The final current density reaches 85 mA cm−2 with applied voltage of 2 V. In order to investigate the cell process at different potentials, in situ AC impedance spectroscopy was carried out at applied dc voltages ranging from 0 to 2 V shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 shows the in situ A.C. impedance spectra of solid oxide electrolyser under different external electrical voltages. The impedance curve was modeled with Zplot electrochemical impedance software to determine the first and second intercepts with real parts. The first intercept represents the series resistance of the cell (Rs) and the difference between the two intercepts was considered to be electrode polarization resistance (Rp). It is clear that the Rs is changing in a small degree (6.5–7.5 Ω·cm2) while Rp drastically changes versus applied electrical voltages. The slight variation of Rs might be related to changes in the Rp element affecting the intercept and particularly for lower Rp values, enhancement of lateral conductivity in cathode at high potentials. As shown in Fig. 5, Rp is ploted versusi.R corrected voltage to further analyze its changes under different voltages where the voltage of i.R drop is subtracted. In Fig. 5, the Rp from electrode polarizations increases from 8.5 Ω·cm2 at open circuit condition to the highest value of 14.9 Ω·cm2 at 0.375 V, which may be due to the high overpotential caused by the insufficient electrode activity. However, Rp significantly decreases to 2.2 Ω·cm2 when the i.R corrected voltage increases to ∼1.2 V and then keeps stable above this voltage where the onset of electrolysis can be anticipated. The increased voltage would gradually reduce the LST-based cathode (Ti4+ → Ti3+) up to 1.2 V, resulting in desirable mixed conductivities and improved cathode performances.32 This is the reason why reduced LST materials with n-type conduction well suit the strongly reducing atmospheres in electrolyser cathode. At this stage, the most important electrochemical process shifts from reduction of LST electrode to coelectrolysis. The stable Rp above 1.2 V demonstrates the sufficient electrochemical reduction of LST cathode and excellent electrode polarizations. On the other hand, the high electrical voltages would further reduce Rp because of favorable kinetics and thermodynamics for electrode reactions. The Rp values measured by A.C. methods are slightly lower than the value obtained from the gradients of I–V curves at lower potentials, but show a consistent trend with the results from D.C. measurements.

It is therefore possible to conclude that there are two main regions from 0 to 2 V (applied electrical voltage) in the coelectrolysis process of CO2/H2O. The electrochemical reduction of LST as discussed above is the main process below applied electrical voltage of 1.4 V, while the coelectrolysis of CO2/H2O should be the dominating process above 1.4 V. It is also reasonable to believe that the transport of oxygen-ion in YSZ electrolyte is the controlling step at high electrical voltages during coelectrolysis because the corresponding Rp is just about 25% of Rs under the same conditions. Although such a cell requires some development, upon further improvements, it shows considerable potential.

Fig. 6 demonstrates the stable coelectrolysis process at 650 °C, where the current density reaches 85 mA cm−2 with applied electrical voltage of 2 V. The undulation in current may be caused by the step advance of syringe pump for water input. The stable current density shows the steady production of synthesis gas from the coelectrolysis process. The porous iron catalyst placed in the temperature gradient region (ranging from 650 to 300 °C) as shown in Fig. 1 matches Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis conditions and simultaneously catalyzes the produced synthesis gas into hydrocarbonsvia a heterogeneous catalysis process. As shown in Table 2, methane is produced at the rate of 0.0047 ml min−1 with Faradaic yield of 2.8%. In this process, methane is directly produced in a single step by combining coelectrolysis and Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis in a synchronous process. The byproducts of CO and H2 are produced as well at the rate of 0.23 and 0.25 ml min−1 with the corresponding Faradaic yield of 36.2% and 39.0%, respectively. Steam electrolysis is also confirmed to be easier than CO2 electrolysis by the conversion of CO2 (11.5%) and H2O (25%). The byproducts are also highly useful and could be further cycled to improve methane yield. It is also demonstrated that the heterogeneous catalysis is the rate controlling step in the whole process as the conversion of CO to hydrocarbon (1.8%) in this work is much lower than reported values in Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis from CO/H2, which might be attributed to the high temperature and low pressure for the hydrocarbon synthesis process.33,34 Higher hydrocarbon yield could be obtained by further improving Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis conditions, such as performing coelectrolysis and catalysis in a pressurized system at lower temperatures. For comparison, no methane output was confirmed without the assistance of iron catalyst under the same conditions. When the electrolysis process was finished, the OCV reached 1.05 V as at this point the electrolyser was in a fuel cell mode.

Conclusions
In this work, methane was synthesized from CO2/H2O in a single step at the rate of 0.0047 ml min−1 with Faradaic yield of 2.8% in a solid oxide electrolyser. Efficient synthesis of CO/H2 with Faraday yield of 74.2% was also achieved. The higher conversion of H2O (25%) than CO2 (11.5%), from a CO2 excess mix, demonstrated that steam electrolysis is easier than CO2 electrolysis. In the whole process, heterogeneous catalysis is the rate limitation. Electrochemical results also show that the electrochemical reduction of LST cathode is the main process at low electrical voltages while the coelectrolysis is the major process at higher applied voltages. The present results open an alternative way to enable a carbon-neutral way for the renewable energy cycle. Higher methane yield and other hydrocarbon generation would require some further developments and effective improvements could be implemented by lowering operation temperature, developing thin-film solid oxide electrolysers, composite cathode with impregnated proper metal cocatalyst.

Broader context
Growing concerns over the consequences of the global climate change are forcing a major shift in the energy portfolio from the current dominance of fossil fuels towards a rich and diverse mix of energy supply based upon renewable and environmentally benign sources. Emerging technologies e.g. solar photovoltaics and fuel cells represent the recent technical breakthroughs in harnessing renewable energy while enabling a decreasing/zero level of carbon emission. However, the progressive move to the decarbonized forms of fuels, hydrogen as the most important example, is seriously impeded by the economic challenge from the unbalanced costs in all aspects of the hydrogen cycle including production, storage, transmission and distribution. In the short and medium terms, hydrocarbon fuels appear to be the ideal energy carriers in adapting the world to sustainable synthetic fuels. Direct synthesis of methane, the major component of natural gas, through an electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is demonstrated in the present work by utilizing a solid oxide electrolyser. This new strategy in producing synthetic hydrocarbon fuels can deliver a carbon neutral renewable energy cycle.
