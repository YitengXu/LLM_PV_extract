E-mail: lioz.etgar@mail.huji.ac.ilReceived 7th July 2013, Accepted 4th September 2013First published on 4th September 2013AbstractLead halide perovskite is an excellent candidate for use as a light harvester in solar cells. Our work presents a depleted hole conductor free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell using a thick CH3NH3PbI3 film. The CH3NH3PbI3 formed large crystals which function simultaneously as light harvesters and as hole transport materials. We performed capacitance voltage measurements, which show a depletion region which extends to both n and p sides. The built-in field of the depletion region assists in the charge separation and suppresses the back reaction of electrons from the TiO2 film to the CH3NH3PbI3 film. This depleted hole conductor free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell provides a power conversion efficiency of 8% with a current density of 18.8 mA cm−2, the highest efficiency achieved to date for perovskite based solar cells without a hole conductor.Broader contextFinding solutions for alternative energy is currently a leading research area and will remain so for the foreseeable future, when photovoltaic (PV) is one of the key technologies towards a sustainable energy supply. Recent discoveries revealed a breakthrough in the field using inorganic–organic hybrid layers named perovskites. The organic–inorganic arrangement is self-assembled as alternate layers, being a simple low cost procedure. These organic–inorganic hybrids promise a few benefits that cannot be encountered by the separate constituents. Latest reports showed high efficiencies for the perovskite based solar cells when using various hole transport materials (HTM). However, the HTM can cause oxidation and infiltration problems into the porous metal oxide in addition to the increase in the solar cell cost. In this work, we present a high efficiency CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction solar cell, which can function simultaneously as a light harvester and as a hole transport material. We performed capacitance voltage measurements and observed the doping density of the CH3NH3PbI3 and the depletion layer which extends to both sides, the mesoporous TiO2 film and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. This depleted hole conductor free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell gives a PCE of 8%, the highest efficiency achieved so far for perovskite based solar cells without a hole conductor.IntroductionLayered perovskites are attracting increased attention due to their technological importance in solar energy conversion. Latest reports show promising photovoltaic performance when using perovskites as sensitizers in solar cells.The basic layered perovskite structures1 are (R–NH3)2MX4 and (NH–R–NH)MX (X = Cl−1, Br−1, or I−1). The M cation is generally a divalent metal that satisfies charge balancing and adopts an octahedral anion coordination. The inorganic layers consist of sheets of corner-sharing metal halide octahedra.The layered perovskite has a large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, direct band gap and high stability.2–4 These properties make it attractive for use in optoelectronic applications. The electronic coupling between the inorganic sheets and their distance from each other control the electronic properties of these layered materials.Several reports used CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite nanocrystals as sensitizers with a liquid electrolyte.5–7 The performance of these systems rapidly declined due to the dissolution of the perovskite. CsSnI3 was used as a solid hole conductor in solid state solar cells, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.5%.8 Further progress was achieved by Kim et al. who reported on a PCE of 9.7%9 and Heo et al. who reported on a PCE of 12%.10 In these reports, the authors used the Spiro-MeOTAD and a poly-triarylamine (PTAA) polymer as the hole conductor, respectively; their device architecture was more like a pillar structure with small CH3NH3PbI3 crystalline domains. In addition to these achievements, Lee et al. have reported on a PCE of 10.9% using the spiro as a hole conductor.11 In this work, an open circuit voltage of more than 1 V was presented, even though the energy band gap is around 1.5 eV. The same authors reported on a low-temperature processed meso-superstructure of thin-film perovskite solar cells achieving a PCE of 12.3%, when they reduced the temperature processing of the Al2O3 from 500 °C to 150 °C.12 The use of CH3NH3PbI3 as both a light harvester and a hole conductor was recently reported achieving a PCE of 5.5%.13 In addition, a high open circuit voltage of 1.15 V was achieved using a CH3NH3PBr3 sensitized hybrid device with poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis-(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-di hydropyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPP) as the hole transport material.14 The deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 on rutile TiO2 nanorods was demonstrated having a PCE of 9.4%.15 More recently, a two-step deposition technique of the CH3NH3PbI3 on the mesoporous TiO2 showed an impressive PCE of 15%.16Here, we report on a depleted hole conductor free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell. A thick CH3NH3PbI3 film was deposited on top of the mesoporous TiO2, the CH3NH3PbI3 has large crystals which function as light harvesters and hole transport materials at the same time. We performed capacitance voltage measurements and observed the doping density of the CH3NH3PbI3 and the depletion layer which extends to both sides, the mesoporous TiO2 film and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. This depleted hole conductor free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell gives a PCE of 8% with a current density of 18.8 mA cm−2, the highest efficiency achieved so far for perovskite based solar cells without hole conductors.ExperimentalMethod and device fabricationCH3NH3I was synthesized by reacting 30 mL of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) and 32.3 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 mL round bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitate was recovered by putting the solution on a rotavap and carefully removing the solvents at 50 °C. The yellowish raw product of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was washed with diethyl ether by stirring the solution for 30 min, a step which was repeated three times, and then the CH3NH3I was finally recrystallized from a mixed solvent of diethyl ether and ethanol. After filtration, the solid was collected and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.Device fabrication. A SnO2:F conducting glass substrate (15 Ω cm−1, Pilkington) was immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C and washed with distilled water and ethanol, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min in air.22 nm TiO2 nanoparticle films of ∼0.3 μm thickness were spin coated onto this substrate. The TiO2 layer was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in air. The substrate was then immersed again in 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C and washed with distilled water and ethanol, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min in air.The synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3 on the TiO2 surface was carried out by dropping a 40 wt% precursor solution of equimolar CH3NH3I and PbI2 in γ-butyrolactone onto the TiO2 film.7 Film formation was induced by spin coating (2000 rpm, 30 s) the CH3NH3PbI3 twice under glove box conditions. In the first spin, the CH3NH3PbI3 was dissolved in γ-butyrolactone, while in the second spin, it was dissolved in dimethylformamide. The film coated onto the TiO2 changed color on drying at room temperature, indicating the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 in the solid state. The CH3NH3PbI3 film was annealed under argon for 15 min at 100 °C.Finally, the counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation of gold under a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Torr. The active area was 0.09 cm2. After the preparation, the cells were exposed to air.Extra high resolution scanning electron microscopy. Magellan XHR SEM was performed with FEI (Field Emission Instruments), The Netherlands. The measurement conditions were 5 kV at a magnification of 100000.X-ray diffraction. X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed in grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) mode on the D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) with a goniometer radius of 217.5 mm, a secondary graphite monochromator, 2° Soller slits and a 0.2 mm receiving slit. XRD patterns within the range 5° to 60° 2θ were recorded at room temperature using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with the following measurement conditions: tube voltage of 40 kV, tube current of 40 mA, step-scan mode with a step size of 0.02° 2θ and counting time of 1–3 s per step. The value of the grazing incidence angle was 2.5°.Photovoltaic characterizationPhotovoltaic measurements employed on a New Port system, an Oriel I–V test station using an Oriel Sol3A simulator. The solar simulator is class AAA for spectral performance, uniformity of irradiance, and temporal stability.The solar simulator is equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp. The output power is adjusted to match AM 1.5 global sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The spectral match classifications are IEC 60904-9 2007, JIC C 8912, and ASTM E927-05. I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively.Oriel IQE-200 was used to determine the monochromatic incident photon-to-electric current conversion efficiency. Under full computer control, light from a 150 W xenon arc lamp was focused through a monochromator in the 300–1800 nm wavelength range onto the photovoltaic cell under test. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined by IPCE (λ) = 12400 (Jsc/λφ), where λ is the wavelength, Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2), and φ is the incident radiative flux (mW cm−2). Photovoltaic performance was measured by using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm2.Capacitance voltage measurements. The measurements were performed using a Metrohm Autolab system, equipped with a PGTSTAT302N potentiostat instrument. The frequency was 1 kHz at bias potentials between 0 and 0.8 V.Results and discussionThe synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3 and the deposition on the mesoporous TiO2 film were carried out by twice spin coating a 40 wt% precursor solution of CH3NH3I and PbI2 in γ-butyrolactone and dimethylformamide. After drying at room temperature, the film coated onto the TiO2 darkened in color, indicating the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 in the solid state. The ionic and covalent interactions between the metal cations and the halogen anions create inorganic octahedra, while the cationic alkylammonium head groups provide charge balance to the structure.A scheme of the depleted CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell on a 300 nm mesoporous TiO2 film is shown in Fig. 1A. The mesoporous TiO2 was coated with the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, while gold was evaporated as the back contact of the device. Fig. 1B shows a schematic energy level diagram of the depleted CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell. Fig. 1  (A) Schematic illustration of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell. (B) Energy level diagram of the discussed solar cell which shows the charge separation process. The positions of the energy levels are according to ref. 13. The CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell shows a depletion layer due to the charge transfer from the electron accepting contact to the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. On illumination, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite should absorb the light, and as a result electrons are transferred from the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite to the TiO2 and holes are transported to the gold contact.Fig. 2B shows a high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) top view image of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film on the TiO2 film where the crystal domains of the CH3NH3PbI3 can be observed. The cross section of the photovoltaic device is shown in Fig. 2A. The mesoporous TiO2 film is 300 nm thick while the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is clearly seen on top of the TiO2 film with a wide range of crystal sizes between 50 and 300 nm. The thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is about 300 nm. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of the CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on top of the mesoporous TiO2 is shown in Fig. 2C; all elements can be observed.

(C) EDS spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer which is shown in the HR-SEM image, presented in (B). (D) XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbI3 on the mesoporous TiO2 film. Fig. 2D shows the XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbI3 on the mesoporous TiO2 film. The peaks of the CH3NH3PbI3 on the TiO2 show the crystalline form of the CH3NH3PbI3 and they match closely with the peaks reported in ref. 7 and 10.Fig. 3A shows the J–V spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells. The cell gives a Jsc of 18.8 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.6 and a Voc of 0.712 V reaching an impressive power conversion efficiency of 8% under 1 sun illumination.

(C) Histogram of the efficiencies for 40 cells of the lead iodide/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra specifies the ratio of extracted electrons to incident photons at a given wavelength. The IPCE spectrum (Fig. 3B) is plotted as a function of wavelength of the light. The CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell has a good response from the visible region until 800 nm, achieving around 80% in the 400–600 nm range. Integration over the IPCE spectra gives 18 mA cm2, which is in good agreement with the current density calculated from the current–voltage measurements.Fig. 3C shows the reproducibility of performance for the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells. More than 50% of the cells show efficiencies above 7.5%, while more than 10% show efficiencies above 7.8%. The average power conversion efficiency is 7.15%.To further understand the operation mechanism of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell, capacitance voltage measurements were performed. The capacitance arises from the depletion layer due to the charge transfer from TiO2 to the CH3NH3PbI3 layer.To estimate the depletion layer and the doping density, we preformed Mott–Schottky analysis17 on the lead iodide/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell. The results are presented in Fig. 4A. Fig. 4  (A) Mott–Schottky analysis at 1 kHz for the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell. A linear fit (shown as the black line) shows that the built-in potential is 0.67 V, and the approximate value for the doping density in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is 2.14 × 1017 cm−3. (B) Schematic band bending diagram. The depletion width on the n-side (Wn) was calculated to be 162 nm and on the p-side (Wp) was calculated to be 75 nm. The junction capacitance (eqn (1)) is calculated from the depletion approximation,18 which implies that there are no free carriers in the space charge region at the junction under investigation. (1)where C is the measured capacitance, A is the active area, V is the applied bias, ε is the static permittivity, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, q is the elementary charge and N is the doping density of the donor.The static permittivity of CH3NH3PbI3 was measured and calculated to be 30 according to ref. 19 and 20. The slope of 1/C2vs. V in the linear regime was 2.71 × 1015 F−2 V−1, from which the net doping density in the CH3NH3PbI3 film is found to be 2.14 × 1017 cm−3.In addition, the built-in potential can be calculated using the intercept of the linear regime with the x-axis of the Mott–Schottky plot, which is equal to 0.67 V, which is in good agreement with the Voc of the device.This is a direct signature of the presence of a built-in field that efficiently drives the separation of photo-generated carriers. Moreover, this built-in field of the depletion region suppressed the back reaction of electrons from the TiO2 film to the CH3NH3PbI3 film.The depletion width is calculated according to:21 (2)where Na and Nd are the doping densities of the acceptor and the donor, respectively. Literature values for doping density in nanoporous TiO2 start at Na = 1 × 1016 cm−3.22–24 Using eqn (2), the depletion width on the n-side and on the p-side was calculated. The depletion width on the n-side was calculated to be 162 nm and on the p-side 75 nm. The schematic bend banding diagram is shown in Fig. 4B. According to Fig. 2A, the thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and the thickness of the TiO2 film are ca. 350 nm and ca. 300 nm, respectively. This suggests that half of the mesoporous TiO2 film is depleted, while more than a fifth of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is depleted. Importantly, the built-in field in the depletion region assists in the charge separation of the photo-generated carriers. Consequently, some of the photo-generated carriers in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer have to transport through the film to the depletion layer, while some of them have to transport to the counter electrode.Future work will concentrate on extending the depletion region in the CH3NH3PbI3 film, in order to minimize the transport distance for the photo-generated carriers.ConclusionsThis paper presents high efficiency CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells; the CH3NH3PbI3 simultaneously functions as a light harvester and a hole conductor. The photovoltaic performance showed a power conversion efficiency of 8% under 1 sun illumination. Mott–Schottky analysis shows a depletion region which extends to both n and p sides. The built-in field of the depletion region assists in the charge separation and suppresses the back reaction of electrons from the TiO2 film to the CH3NH3PbI3 film. The research sheds more light on the operation mechanism in this hole conductor free CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Dr Vladimir Uvarov and Ms Evgenia Blayvas from the Harvey M.
