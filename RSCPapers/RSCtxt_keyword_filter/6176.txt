    , Accepted 7th April 2016First published on 7th April 2016AbstractA series of non-conjugated water/alcohol soluble copolymers containing diphenyl sulfide, diphenyl sulfoxide or diphenyl sulfone in the main chain were synthesized. The surfactant-like functionalities in side chains endow the polymers with outstanding solubility in highly polar solvents and excellent electron extraction abilities, while the limited conjugation length of main chains renders the polymers weak optical absorption. These unique characteristics make the polymers excellent cathode interfacial layers, which contribute to highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies of 8–9%. More importantly, some of them can yield highly efficient PSCs in a relative large interlayer thickness range of 2–20 nm. The results suggest that these polymers are promising candidates for use as cathode interfacial layers in single-junction PSCs and as recombination layers in multi-junction PSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their great potential of producing light-weight and flexible photovoltaic modules via low-cost large-scale fabrication.1–5 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs in both single-junction devices and multi-junction devices have exceeded 10%6–8 owing to combined efforts including the development of new photoactive polymers,9–15 morphology control,16–20 device engineering,6,21–24 interlayer modification25–31 and so on. Now it is well recognized that the control of an active layer/electrode interface to form an Ohmic contact is pivotal to maximize the performance of PSCs. Hence, a lots of effort has been devoted to the development of novel interfacial materials for electrode modification, especially for cathode modification.8,32–39 Several kinds of materials have been widely used as cathode interfacial layers (CILs) in PSCs, which are based on different lines, spanning from inorganic compounds such as LiF,40 TiOx,41 CsCO3,42 and ZnO43–45 to organic small molecules38,39,46–49 and conjugated/non-conjugated polymers.37,50–54 Among various CIL materials, conjugated water/alcohol soluble polymers (CWSPs) that consist of a conjugated main chain and a polar/ionic side chain have received growing attention because of their outstanding intrinsic optoelectronic properties, good stability and unique solubility.25,26,28–31,55
For example, amino-group-functionalized conjugated polymers based on fluorene and their ionic derivatives have been successfully applied as CILs in PSCs.27,32,34,50,51,56–59 These polymers have good solubility in polar solvents such as alcohol and water, which make them attractive for the fabrication of multilayer PSC devices through orthogonal solvent processing. Moreover, these polymers can significantly enhance the performance of PSCs via boosting one or multiple device parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF)). For example, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)60 set several PCE records of PSCs in the past few years.27,56
Herein, we report a series of nonconjugated water/alcohol soluble polymers (NWSPs) derived from fluorene and diphenyl sulfide with different oxidation states (Scheme 1) for use as CILs to achieve highly efficient PSCs. These novel NWSPs (PF6NPS, PF6NPSO, PF6NPSO2, PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr, and PF6NPSO2Br) comprise a rigid nonconjugated main chain and surfactant-like side chains. The neutral amino groups or ionic ammonium groups render the polymers good solubility in polar solvents (such as methanol) for multilayer solution processing and good electron collection ability in metal cathodes. The conjugation of the main chains of these polymers was interrupted by the sulfur atoms, which can be further oxidized to different states, sulfoxide and sulfone. This design renders the new interfacial materials several unique advantages. First, the limited conjugation will endow the polymers with weak optical absorption and high transparency in the visible region. Second, the introduction of sulfoxide and sulfone units can deepen the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the polymers, and hence improve the electron collection ability and the hole blocking ability of the resulting PSCs. Benefiting from these novel CILs, highly efficient PSCs with PCEs of 8–9% were fabricated on the basis of the photovoltaic active layer of poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-uorothithieno-[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7)61 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (see Scheme 1 for chemical structures and device architecture). More importantly, some of these new interfacial materials can yield highly efficient PSCs in a relatively large interlayer thickness range of 2–20 nm. The excellent cathode modification abilities combined with weak optical absorption render these polymers promising candidates as cathode interfacial layers in single-junction PSCs and recombination layers in multi-junction PSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Design, synthesis, and characterization

Scheme 2 shows the chemical structures and synthetic routes of the relevant monomers and polymers. Monomer 4,4′-dibromo-diphenylsulfide (1) was obtained by treating diphenylsulfide with bromine and 30% hydrogen peroxide in a mixed solution of dichloromethane and water under argon.62 Monomer 4,4′-dibromo-diphenylsulfoxide (2) and monomer 4,4′-dibromo-diphenylsulfone (3) were obtained by treating 1 with 30% hydrogen peroxide in glacial acetic acid at 80 °C under argon for different durations, and the products were purified using silica gel column chromatography. The diboronic ester monomer 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane-2-yl)-9,9-bis(6-(N,N-diethylamino)-hexyl)fluorene (4) was synthesized according to a previous work.63 The three neutral amino-group containing polymers (PF6NPS, PF6NPSO and PF6NPSO2) were synthesized by the standard Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling polymerization with equivalent molar ratios of dibromide monomers (1, 2 or 3) and diboronic ester monomer 4. The polymers were characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent are 17.1 kg mol−1 (with a polydispersity (PDI) of 1.9) for PF6NPS, 14.7 kg mol−1 (with a PDI of 1.9) for PF6NPSO, and 16.8 kg mol−1 (with a PDI of 2.1) for PF6NPSO2, respectively.
 Scheme 2  Chemical structures and synthetic routes of the monomers and polymers. Reagents and conditions: (i) Br2, hydrogen peroxide 30% aq., H2O, CH2Cl2, ambient temperature, 8 h, argon; (ii) hydrogen peroxide 30% aq., CH3COOH, 80 °C, 6 h, argon; (iii) Pd(PPh3)4, tetraethylammonium hydroxide 20% aq., toluene, THF, 90 °C, 24 h, argon; and (iv) bromoethane, THF/MeOH, 40 °C, 3 d, argon. 
The three ammonium polymers (PF6NPSBr, PF6NSOBr and PF6NPSO2Br) were obtained by treating the corresponding neutral amino-group polymers with excess bromoethane in a THF–methanol solvent mixture at 40 °C for 3 days in an argon atmosphere. The conversions of chemical structures from neutral polymers to ammonium polymers were verified using 1H NMR spectroscopy.60 The ionic side chains endow the ammonium polymers with excellent solubility in high polarity solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The three amino-containing neutral polymers are soluble in common non-polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform and toluene, but cannot be dissolved in highly polar solvents. Interestingly, these neutral polymers are soluble in methanol by adding a trace amount of acetic acid because of the weak interaction between the basic nitrogen atoms and protons.64 The excellent solubility in highly polar solvents make these polymers good candidates for multilayer organic photovoltaic device fabrication from orthogonal solvents. The thermal stability of the polymers was investigated by thermal gravity analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the results are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). PF6NPS, PF6NPSO and PF6NPSO2 showed good thermal stability with 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) of 367, 365 and 387 °C, respectively. In contrast, PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr and PF6NPSO2Br showed much lower Td of 223, 214 and 233 °C, respectively.
2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1 shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) transmission spectra of the polymers in the solid state for PF6NPS, PF6NPSO, PF6NPSO2, PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr, and PF6NPSO2Br. The film thicknesses are around 50 nm. For comparison, the transparency of PFN thin films was studied as well. The transmittances of the newly synthesized NWSPs reach 90–100% over 400 nm, while the PFN lost its transparency under 430 nm. The high transparency of these CIL materials indicates that the active layer of the resulting PSCs, especially for the PSCs with inverted device structures, will have more efficient photon-harvesting and higher quantum efficiencies in the high energy region.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis transmission spectra of the polymers and PFN in the solid state. The films of PFN, PF6NPS, PF6NPSO and PF6NPSO2 were spin-coated from CHCl3 solutions, and the films of PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBBr and PF6NPSO2Br were spin-coated from MeOH solutions. 
Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymers in solutions (chloroform for PF6NPS, PF6NPSO, and PF6NPSO2; methanol for PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr, and PF6NPSO2Br) at a concentration of 1 × 10−5 g mL−1 and in thin films. The results are summarized in Table 1. In chloroform, PF6NPS shows an absorption peak (λabsmax) at 344 nm, while both PF6NPSO and PF6NPSO2 show absorption peaks at 350 nm. In the solid state, PF6NPS, PF6NPSO, and PF6NPSO2 show the absorption peak at 346, 350, and 354 nm, respectively. The ammonium polymers PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr, and PF6NPSO2Br exhibit the absorption peak in methanol at 350, 354 and 367 nm, respectively. In thin films, PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr and PF6NPSO2Br show the absorption peak at 353, 357 and 375 nm, respectively, which are slightly red-shifted to their absorption in solutions. The absorption onsets of PF6NPS, PF6NPSO, PF6NPSO2, PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr, and PF6NPSO2Br in thin films are 388, 393, 400, 392, 402 and 414 nm, respectively, which correspond to an optical band gap (Eg) of 3.19, 3.15, 3.10, 3.16, 3.08 and 2.99 eV, respectively.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution under a nitrogen atmosphere at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature. The polymer thin films coated on a platinum electrode were used as working electrodes. A Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode was used as the reference electrode. The CV curves of the polymers are presented in Fig. 2. The onset oxidation potential (Eox) for PF6NPS, PF6NPSO and PF6NPSO2 are 1.14, 1.45 and 1.55 V, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PF6NPS, PF6NPSO, and PF6NPSO2 are calculated to be −5.52, −5.83, and −5.93 eV, respectively, with a ferrocene value of 4.8 eV below the vacuum energy level as the internal standard.65 The onset reduction potential (Ered) for PF6NPS, PF6NPSO and PF6NPSO2 are −2.06, −1.91 and −1.83 V, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PF6NPS, PF6NPSO, and PF6NPSO2 are calculated to be −2.32, −2.47, and −2.55 eV, respectively. The (Ered) for PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr and PF6NPSO2Br are 1.29, 1.50 and 1.64 V, respectively. The oxidation process at around 0.70 V can be attributed to the oxidation of the quaternary ammonium bromide in the polymer side chain, which is confirmed by the oxidation process of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB). The HOMO energy levels of PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr and PF6NPSO2Br are calculated to be −5.70, −5.91, and −6.05 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr, and PF6NPSO2Br are calculated to be −2.54, −2.83, and −3.06 eV from their HOMO energy levels and optical band gaps. The values of HOMO and LUMO energy levels are summarized in Table 1. Based on these data, we depicted the energy level diagram of the PSCs in Fig. 3. For comparison, the energy level of PFN is also shown. It is clear that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the NWSP polymers decreased simultaneously along with the increase of oxidation degree from diphenylsulfide to diphenylsulfoxide and further to diphenylsulfone. Moreover, all of these NWSPs show deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels than those of PFN, suggesting that these new CIL materials potentially have a better hole blocking ability and electron transport ability.

The work functions of the ITO electrode, Al electrode and PEDOT:PSS, as well as the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PTB7,61 PCBM30 and PFN60 adopted the values reported in the literature. The HOMO energy levels of NWSPs were calculated from CV measurements, and the LUMO energy levels of NWSPs were calculated from their HOMO levels and Eg. 
2.3. Interface modification abilities
To investigate the interface modification abilities of these NWSPs in PSCs, bulk-heterojunction PSCs with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/NWSPs/Al that use a PTB7:PC71BM blend as the active layer were fabricated and tested. The chemical structures of the active layer materials PTB7 and PC71BM, as well as the device structure are shown in Scheme 1. A thin layer (approximately 5 nm) was spin-coated on top of the active layer from MeOH solution to form a CIL. For comparison, a control device without any interlayer was also fabricated and tested. To exclude the possible influence caused by methanol, the MeOH rinsed control devices were also fabricated and tested.

Fig. 4a shows the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs under AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The photovoltaic properties of the PSCs including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE are listed in Table 2. The bare Al solar cells exhibited an average PCE of 5.2%, with a Jsc of 16.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.57 V and an FF of 0.55. After inserting a thin layer of NWSPs between the active layer and Al as the CIL, all of the PSC devices exhibit significant performance enhancement. The devices with PF6NPS, PF6NPSO, PF6NPSO2, PF6NPSBr, PF6NPSOBr and PF6NPSO2Br as interlayers offered a PCE of 8.7%, 8.5%, 7.9%, 8.8%, 9.2% and 7.9%, respectively. The Voc of the corresponding PSCs increased from 0.57 V for the bare Al devices to approximately 0.75 V for CIL/Al devices. The Voc enhancements upon inserting the CIL between the active layer and electrode may originate from the lowered work function of an Al electrode due to the formation of dipoles in the active layer/Al interface, which consequently result in enhanced built-in potential and attainable Voc in PSCs.19 The FF of the corresponding PSCs enhanced from 0.55 for the bare Al devices to approximately 0.70 for the sulfide- and sulfoxide-containing polymer incorporated devices, and to approximately 0.65 for the sulfone polymer inserted devices. The Jsc of the CIL/Al devices are similar to that of the bare Al device. No considerable “MeOH effect”66,67 was observed. Hence, the performance enhancement of the PSCs with the resulting NWSPs as CILs originates mainly from interfacial polymers themselves.

To obtain an in-depth understanding of the performance enhancement of PSCs upon inserting the resulting NWSPs as CILs, the J–V characteristics (Fig. 4b) of the PSCs were measured in the dark. The devices with NWSPs as CILs show a turn-on voltage of approximately 0.90 V, which is much higher than those (0.69 V) of the bare Al device and the MeOH-treated device. In the range from 0.30 to 0.90 V, the leakage currents of the bare Al device and the MeOH-treated device are much higher than those of the NWSP/Al devices, in agreement with the FF of the corresponding devices. The series resistance (Rs) acquired from the best NWSP/Al devices (Table 2) is about 4–5 Ω cm2, which is significantly lower than those of the bare Al device and the MeOH-treated device (approximately 8 Ω cm2). Although the Voc and FF of the PSC devices with the resulting NWSPs as CILs increase significantly compared to the control devices, no apparent change in the Jsc of all these devices is observed, which is further confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices. As shown in Fig. 5, the EQE curves of the NWSP/Al devices overlap almost completely with the control devices.
 Fig. 5  The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSC devices with different interlayers. 
To further understand the improvement of solar cell performances upon insertion of the synthesized polymers as CILs, the work function (WF) of the Al cathode with different treatments were measured using a Kelvin probe, which is a useful tool to study the energy level at a metal/organic interface.68,69 The results are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The WF values of neat Al and MeOH-treated Al are 4.28 eV and 4.26 eV, respectively. Upon deposition of a thin layer of the synthesized polymer, the resulting Al/polymer surfaces show around 0.3 eV work function reduction with the value of 3.95 eV for PF6NPS/Al, 3.96 eV for PF6NPSO/Al, 3.99 eV for PF6NPSO2/Al, 3.96 eV for PF6NPSBr/Al, 3.99 eV for PF6NPSOBr/Al and 4.03 eV for PF6NPSO2Br/Al, respectively. The reduced work function of the Al cathode can reduce the barrier for electron collection and can achieve an Ohmic contact at the organic/metal interface, which thereby contributes to the enhancement of Voc and FF of the PSCs.
Although all the resulting NWSPs can improve the performance of PSCs, considerable PCE differences in PSCs exist among these polymers, which are mainly due to the fluctuation in the FF. The electron mobilities of PSCs with these polymers were thus measured in electron-only devices with a device structure of ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/CIL/Al by fitting the data with a space-charge-limited-current model. The J1/2–V plots of the devices are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the mobility values are listed in Table 2. The electron mobility of the MeOH-treated device (2.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is similar to the Al-only device (1.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Upon insertion of the NWSPs as CILs, the electron mobilities of all devices are enhanced by one order of magnitude. Moreover, the difference in electron mobilities among the devices with different NWSPs as CILs are clearly observed (5.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PF6NPS, 5.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PF6NPSO, 4.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PF6NPSO2, 5.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PF6NPSBr, 5.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PF6NPSOBr, 3.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PF6NPSO2Br), which are in agreement with the trend of the FF as listed in Table 2.
To date, most solution processable organic/polymeric interfacial materials can yield efficient PSCs only with very thin interlayer films because of their low electric conductivities.27,34 Clearly, this delicate thickness dependence renders the production of PSCs via large-scale roll-to-roll processing highly challenging.70,71 Interestingly, some of our new interfacial materials allow for the fabrication of efficient PSCs in a relatively wide range of CIL thickness. The results are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 6. For example, the PCEs exceeding 7% were maintained for the PF6NPSBr/Al devices in the interlayer thickness range of 3–20 nm. High PCEs of 7.8–8.9% are also observed for the PF6NPSO2Br/Al devices in the CIL thickness range of 3–14 nm. The excellent performances of PSCs operated in such a large thickness range of CILs indicate the high electric conductivities of CILs. Previously, Jen's group have proved that several kinds of anions such as bromide anions and iodide anions can n-dope fullerene and thereby produce enhanced electric conductivities for the resulting films.72 Very recently, our group also disclosed the n-doping effects and conductivity-enhancing properties in naphthalene diimide-based conjugated polymers due to the electron transfer from the electron-rich species to the naphthalene diimide-based polymer main chain.73,74 We thus speculate that similar n-doping effects may also exist in PF6NPSBr and PF6NPSO2Br when considering the high electron affinities of the polymers due to their strong electron-withdrawing sulfone unit.

3. Conclusions
To summarize, a series of neutral amino-containing nonconjugated polymers with different sulfide oxidation states in the main chain were synthesized by Suzuki polymerization, and their ammonium products were prepared through post-treatment with bromoethane. All of these polymers have a good solubility in methanol, making them attractive candidates for fabricating multilayer PSCs via orthogonal solution processing. The PSCs employing the new interfacial polymers exhibit PCEs of 8–9%. Moreover, some of these polymers (PF6NPSBr and PF6NPSO2Br) allow for the fabrication of efficient PSCs in a wide range of CIL thickness. The outstanding interface modification abilities, good solubility in polar solvents, high transparency in both near-infrared region and visible region, and low thickness sensitivity make these new polymers promising candidates for use as CILs in single-junction PSCs and as recombination layers in multi-junction devices.
