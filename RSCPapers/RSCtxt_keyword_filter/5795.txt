    , Accepted 22nd December 2021First published on 27th December 2021AbstractTin (Sn)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention because they are more environmentally friendly than lead-based PSCs. However, the fast crystallization of Sn-based perovskite films and the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ hinder the improvement of their efficiency and stability. In this work, ethylammonium bromide (EABr) was added to methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) perovskite precursor solution to regulate the crystallization dynamics and improve the film morphology. The results show that the large EA+ ions slow down the crystallization process of Sn-based perovskites and form a smooth perovskite film with high crystallinity, while the added Br− anions further improved the crystallinity and orientation of the perovskite film. Under the combined action of EA+ and Br− ions, the as-produced PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.59%. The EABr additive also retarded the oxidation of Sn2+, and the solar cell device maintained 93% of its initial efficiency after 30 days in a nitrogen-filled glove box without being encapsulated. This work provides a new strategy for the realization of high-efficiency Sn-based PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress in the last ten years as the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3.8% to 25.5%.1–8 However, the toxicity of lead (Pb) severely limits the further commercialization of lead-based PSCs. Thus, seeking alternative metals with lower toxicity than Pb has become an urgent and important research direction. Sn-based PSCs exhibited the most promising performance among the various alternatives because of the suitable band gap, low exciton binding energy, and high carrier mobility.9–17 However, the easy oxidation and fast crystallization of Sn-based perovskites have led to poor film quality and low photovoltaic device performance.18–22
Many strategies have been attempted to alleviate this deficiency, such as introducing additives into the perovskite precursor to improve device performance. SnF2,18 SnCl2,23,24 ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2),16,25–27 3-phenyl-2-propen-1-amine (PPA),28 poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA),29 phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl),30 and more have been successfully introduced into the Sn-based perovskite precursor to hinder the oxidation of Sn2+. Two-dimensional (2D) organic cations, such as phenylethylammonium (PEA+),31 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP),32 and butylammonium (BA+),33 have been used to decelerate the crystallization of the perovskite and enhance the quality of Sn-based perovskite film. However, the introduction of large-size 2D organic cations impeded the carrier transport and eventually limited the PCE of the Sn-based PSCs approaching their theoretical efficiency. Shao et al.36 found that introducing EAI into Sn-based perovskite films could promote the out-of-plane orientation of the film. Previous works also demonstrated that the halide anions could hinder the oxidation of Sn2+ and achieve the crystal orientated growth. For instance, Lee et al. introduced Br− anions into formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3), which significantly restrained the Sn vacancies of the perovskite absorption layer.34 This allowed a PCE of 5.5% and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.414 V to be obtained. Similarly, Yu et al.35 introduced methylammonium bromide (MABr) into FASnI3 to promote the orientation crystallization of FASnI3 perovskite film and achieved a Voc of 0.60 V and a PCE of 9.31%. These reports indicated that both Br− and EA+ could improve the photovoltaic performance of Sn-based perovskite.
This work reports a simple and effective method to fabricate Sn-based perovskite with high Voc and PCE by introducing 30% EABr into MASnI3. The EABr additive promoted the oriented crystal growth of the film. Consequently, the perovskite film with EABr additive showed better crystal orientation than the perovskite film without EABr additive. The strong crystal orientation can be verified by the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement. The EABr additive also slowed down the crystallization rate, modified the grain boundaries, and adjusted the band gap of tin-based perovskite, making it more aligned with the electron and hole transport layers. These features accorded the final device with a PCE of 9.59% and an open-circuit voltage of 0.72 V.
Results and discussion
The detailed preparation processes of MASnI3 precursor solutions with various concentrations of EABr additives (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%) are presented in the ESI.† The fabrication process of the perovskite layer is illustrated in Fig. 1a. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to investigate the influence of EABr additive on perovskite crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 1b, the characteristic diffraction peaks observed at 2θ values of 14.04° and 28.10° are assigned to (100) and (200) crystal planes of the perovskite. With the EABr additive, the intensity of the characteristic peaks increases significantly and reaches the maximum when the molar ratio of EABr is 30%. Therefore, a small amount of EABr promotes perovskite crystallization and crystal growth, but too much EABr deteriorates the perovskite crystallization. Fig. S1a† shows the (100) diffraction peak shifting to a low diffraction angle, which indicates that the introduction of EABr leads to a slight expansion of the perovskite lattice.

(b) XRD patterns of MASnI3-x EABr (x = 0 mol%, 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%, 40 mol%, or 60 mol%) perovskite films with different EABr additives.

(d) Magnified XRD patterns of MASnI3 perovskite with 0 mol% EABr, 30 mol% EABr, and 30 mol% EAI. (e)–(g) SEM images of MASnI3-x EABr (x = 0 mol%, 30 mol%, or 60 mol%) perovskite films. 
To unravel the increased crystallinity caused by the EABr additive, different amounts of EAI were added to the MASnI3 perovskite. As shown in Fig. 1c, the peak intensities of the (100) and (200) increase significantly with the increase of EAI additive, indicating that the large EA+ cations are beneficial to the crystal growth and orientation of perovskite. However, the intensity of the (100) peak decreased significantly as the EAI content is further increased to 60%, indicating that excessive EAI degenerates the crystallinity of the film. Similarly, as shown in Fig. S1b,† the (100) diffraction peaks of perovskite with EAI shift to lower diffraction angles. We also calculated the changes of lattice constants under different EABr and EAI additives through the XRD data, and listed them in the Table S1.† The result indicates that EABr and EAI additives lead to a slight expansion of the lattice parameters.
To further verify whether Br− contributed to the improved film crystallinity as demonstrated in Introduction Section, the (100) XRD patterns of perovskite films with 0% EABr, 30% EABr, and 30% EAI additives were compared. According to Fig. 1d, the perovskite film with 30% EABr additive has the highest (100) peak intensities, along with the smallest full width at half maximum (FWHM). The results indicate that both EA+ and Br− improve the crystallization and orientation of the MASnI3 perovskite film.

Fig. 1e–g and S2a–S2c† show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the MASnI3 perovskite films with different amounts of EABr additives. With 0% EABr additive, the film exhibits a lot of bright regions on the surface (Fig. 1e) due to the phase-segregated SnI2 after anti-solvent dropping.38 With 10% or 20% EABr additives added into the precursor solution the uneven film surfaces (Fig. S2a and S2b†) became smooth, and the number of bright regions decreased. As the concentration of EABr additives increased to 30% and 40%, highly uniform and compact films with even surfaces were obtained (Fig. 1f and Fig. S2c†). The results indicate that 30% and 40% EABr additives can greatly slow down the crystallization rate. However, the uneven morphology (Fig. 1g) and bright regions reappeared as the EABr concentration was further increased to 60%, indicating that excessive EABr additive leads to an unimproved film morphology. The morphology evolvement mechanism has been explained in previous work.27
GIWAXS measurements were performed to investigate the crystal orientation of the perovskite film with different EABr additives. Fig. 2a–c and Fig. S3a–S3e† show the GIWAXS patterns of the perovskite films at an incident angle of 2°. The GIWAXS pattern of the perovskite film with 0% EABr additive showed only Debye-Scherrer rings, indicating the random orientation of the polycrystalline structure in the 3D MASnI3 perovskite. In contrast, the perovskite films with EABr additives (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or 70%) exhibited sharp and discrete Bragg spots with decreasing diffraction rings. The bright (100) and (200) diffraction peaks were located in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the crystal grew vertically to the substrate. Fig. 2d and e show the crystal structure and orientation are random without EABr additive and perpendicular to the substrate with EABr additives. The vertical orientation provides a channel for carrier transport, which is conducive to the device's efficiency.

(e) Schematic diagram of the vertically oriented crystal structure in the MASnI3 film with the 30 mol% EABr additive. 
As shown in Fig. S4a,† the UV-Vis absorption spectra of MASnI3 with different EABr additives were measured to investigate the impact of EABr additives on the optical properties of MASnI3 films. It is seen that the absorption onsets blueshift when increasing the concentration of EABr. The absorption intensity in the range of 400–550 nm is highest with 30% EABr added into the MASnI3 perovskite, indicating that the 30% EABr additive significantly improves the absorption of the film which is beneficial for achieving high device performance. The blueshift trend is consistent with the photoluminescence (PL) spectra shown in Fig. S5,† which will be discussed later.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed to investigate the impact of EABr additive on the band gap alignment of perovskite film. The onset (Ei) and cut-off (Ecut-off) energy regions in the UPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3a. The valence band maximum (VBM) can be calculated according to the following equation:37 EVBM = 21.22 − (Ecut-off − Ei).(1)

The conduction band minimum (CBM) can be calculated based on the optical band gap (Fig. S4b†) and VBM. The band gap alignment diagram is shown in Fig. 3b. Without EABr additive, the CBM of MASnI3 perovskite film is −3.69 eV, and VBM is −4.91 eV. With 10% EABr additive, CBM increases from −3.69 eV to −3.64 eV and VBM increases from −4.91 eV to −4.9 eV. However, CBM decreases from −3.64 eV to −3.77 eV and VBM decreases from −4.9 eV to −5.07 eV when further increasing EABr concentration to 30%. It can be seen that the VBM of perovskite with 30% EABr additive well matches the energy level of the hole-transport layer (PEDOT:PSS). Good band gap alignment is significant for achieving high efficiency. Further increasing the concentration of EABr additive to 60%, CBM upshifts significantly from −3.77 eV to −2.94 eV and VBM from −5.07 eV to −4.58 eV. The mismatched band gap alignment leads to poor device performance.
According to the steady-state PL spectra of MASnI3-x EABr perovskite films shown in Fig. 4a, the steady-state PL intensities increase significantly with the 30% EABr additive, implying lower trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses. The normalized PL spectra in Fig. S5† show a systematical blueshift with the increasing concentration of EABr additives, as confirmed in the absorption spectrum shown in Fig. S4a.†Fig. 4b shows the Time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films fabricated on the glass substrates. The average PL lifetime (Table S2†) of MASnI3-30% EABr film is 1.43 ns, which is longer than the film without EABr additive (0.74 ns), indicating a lower defect density and the suppressed charge recombination in the MASnI3-30% EABr film.

Hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PTAA/Ag were fabricated, and the dark current was measured to evaluate the trap density in the MASnI3-x EABr perovskite film (Fig. 4c). The trap-state density was calculated with the trap-filled limit voltage using the following equation: (2)where Nt is the trap-state density, q is the elementary charge of the electron, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, εo is the vacuum permittivity, and εr is the relative dielectric constant. According to Fig. 4c, the trap density of the MASnI3-30% EABr perovskite film is 3.00 × 1016 cm−3 and is 3.97 × 1016 cm−3 for the MASnI3 film without EABr. For comparison, electron-only devices with an ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag architecture were also fabricated (Fig. 4d). The results show that with the 30 mol% EABr additive, the electron trap density decreased significantly from 7.74 × 1016 cm−3 to 1.65 × 1016 cm−3. The reduced trap-state density could be attributed to the enhanced film crystallinity and the effective defect passivation in the MASnI3-30% EABr perovskite film.
XPS measurements were employed to further understand the effect of the EABr additive on the stability of the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The Sn2+ to Sn4+ area ratio of the perovskite films without EABr additive is 73.5:26.5. A high proportion of Sn4+ is often the reason for low Voc and hence low efficiency. With the 30 mol% EABr additive the Sn2+ to Sn4+ area ratio increases to 90.1:9.9 showing that the 30% EABr additive effectively retards the oxidation of Sn2+.
Photovoltaic devices with a p–i–n structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/MASnI3-xEABr/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/bahocuproine (BCP)/Ag were fabricated to estimate the effect of the EABr additive on the MASnI3 PSC performance. The device structure is shown in Fig. 5a. The J–V parameters including Voc, Jsc, PCE, and FF of MASnI3-x EABr PSCs with different molar concentrations of EABr additive are listed in Table S3,† and the statistics for different EABr components are shown in Fig. S6.† The optimum EABr additive concentration is 30%, and the best performance J–V curves of the MASnI3-30 mol% EABr and MASnI3-0% EABr devices are displayed in Fig. 5b. The MASnI3 device with the 30% EABr additive showed a PCE of 9.59% with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 19.08 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69.62% measured in the forward scan direction. The EQE spectrum of the final device with the 30% EABr additive is shown in Fig. 5c. The integrated current density in the EQE curve is 18.63 mA cm−2 which matches well with the Jsc measured under the J–V scan. The steady-state photocurrent and PCE of the final device with the 30 mol% EABr additive under 250 s standard light irradiation are shown in Fig. 5d. The device showed a very stable output for 250 s irradiation, indicating good device stability.

(e) Voc light-intensity dependence of MASnI3 PSCs without EABr and with the 30 mol% EABr additive. (f) Mott–Schottky analysis of the PSCs. 

Fig. 5e shows the Vocversus illumination intensity curves. The ideality factor is calculated with the following equation: (3)
According to the linear fitting and calculation, the ideality factor n of the MASnI3-30% EABr device is 1.21 and 1.37 for the MASnI3-0% EABr device. The decreased ideality factor indicates the reduced non-radiative recombination losses of the MASnI3-30% EABr film. Fig. 5f shows the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of the device without and with EABr additives. The M–S equation can be expressed as: (4)where C is capacitance, A is the active area, q is the unit charge, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the dielectric constant of perovskite, N is the charge density, Vbi is the built-in potential, and V is the applied potential. In Fig. 5f, the slope of the M–S curve and the interception with the x-axis is the built-in potential. With 30% EABr additive, the built-in potential of perovskite is 0.41 V, which is higher than the perovskite without EABr additive. A higher built-in potential facilitates the separation of carriers and expands the width of the depletion region to suppress charge recombination.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to understand the charge carrier recombination mechanism. The EIS spectra of all devices were measured at a voltage bias of 0.3 V under dark. As shown in Fig. S7,† the Nyquist plots of the device with the 30% EABr additive and without EABr additive display a semicircle in the low frequency, indicating that recombination occurs at the interface or inside the absorber layer. Furthermore, the semicircle of the device with the 30% EABr additive is larger than the device without EABr additive. The device with the 30% EABr additive showed higher recombination resistance, indicating the lower charge recombination rate and more effective charge extraction capability than the device without EABr additive. The stability of the unencapsulated device with 30% EABr additive was tested for 30 days in a nitrogen-filled glovebox (Fig. S8†). It is worth noting that the device's efficiency was 93% of its initial efficiency after 30 days. The excellent stability of the device proved that the EABr additive is a good strategy for improving the stability of tin-based perovskite devices.
In summary, EABr was successfully introduced into MASnI3, and the results showed that EABr had versatile effects. EABr promoted the oriented crystallization of MASnI3 and induced the MASnI3 perovskite film to grow perpendicularly to the substrate, which is beneficial for carrier transport. EABr also reduced the crystallization rate of tin-based perovskite and improved the morphology of the film. Moreover, EABr adjusted the band gap of the tin-based perovskite and increased its alignment with the electron and hole transport layers. In addition, EABr restrained the oxidation rate of Sn2+ and improved the stability of the Sn-based perovskite film. Finally, the inverted planar PSCs exhibited an optimal PCE of 9.59% with the 30% EABr additive. Overall, this work provides a new strategy for high-efficiency tin-based perovskites.
