    , Accepted 13th July 2017First published on 13th July 2017AbstractA hybrid TiO2–CdTe multi-layer matrix was fabricated for validation in a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) operating with N3 dye as the sensitizer. The composite matrix was subjected to studies of structural and morphological information, and optical and spectral characterizations before sensitizing with dye. A CdTe–N3 dye conjugate sensitizer over the base TiO2 matrix improves the functional behavior of the anode by accelerating the charge transport and reducing the recombination within the DSSC framework. The photovoltaic measurements reveal that a moderate loading of CdTe NPs at the anode exhibits a solar conversion efficiency of 11.1% under an optimal illumination of 50 mW cm−2.
1. Introduction
A typical dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC)1–8 is composed of a nanometer sized mesoporous oxide layer of TiO2 as the photo anode matrix, embedded with a layer of sensitizer dye molecules, a counter electrode consisting of Pt coated FTO and iodine–iodide as the electrolyte.9–11 Photo excitation of dye molecules results in injection of an electron into the conduction band (CB) of the wide band gap TiO2 semiconductor. The injected electron in the CB of TiO2 passes through the external circuit to the cathode, reducing the oxidised redox mediator I−/I3− in the electrolyte, so the dye is restored back to its original state by accepting an electron from I− which gets oxidised to I3−, thereby completing the cycle.12,13 Several attempts have been made to fabricate the anode component using different techniques: namely electrochemical anodization, sol–gel, electrospinning, hydrothermal/solvothermal, atomic layer deposition and spray pyrolysis.14–19 Rigorous efforts are being made to improve the functional properties of DSSC by modifying the ceramic oxide (TiO2) layer with plasmonic particles of Ag/Au,20–22 by electrochemical insertion of cations,23 using quantum dot (QD) sensitizers, dendrimers and also by formulating core shell structures.24–28 Combinatorial approaches using multiple sensitizers are also becoming a popular way to enrich the kinetic input in the DSSC system. The primary motive of co-sensitization in DSSC is to increase the light harvesting efficiency by engineering the DSSC anode with new sensitizers possessing broad absorption in the UV and NIR region. The co-sensitizer molecules preferably have selective matching of HOMO−LUMO energy levels with the sensitizer dye molecules at the anode. Co-sensitization using multiple dyes has also been reported with increased light harvesting properties.29,30 Another approach towards co-sensitization in DSSC is by using quantum dots along with the dye.31 The introduction of additional sensitizers in the matrix with suitable energy levels can improve solar absorption and increase electron extraction to the CB of TiO2, enabling faster reaction kinetics. The photo sensitizer dye molecules which have been commercialized for DSSC include Ru based organometallic complexes which have attained a global bench mark efficiency of ∼12–13%.32,33
In the present investigation a novel approach has been taken towards formulating a hybrid structure of low and high energy semiconductor (SC) materials for use in DSSC. The titania matrix (3.3 eV) was decorated with an additional coating of CdTe NPs (1.49 eV) by voltammetric deposition at room temperature and the TiO2–CdTe conjugate system was sensitized with N3 dye to fabricate the photo anode. The Cd-chalcogenide films are reported to have excellent photo sensitivity in photovoltaic cells and when metal doped or combined with other chalcogenides can provide tunable band energy, a larger extinction coefficient and wider spectral coverage.34–36 Solar cells have also been reported using photo anodes consisting of CdTe quantum dots as well as a core shell (CdS) CdTe structure, which, however, involve critical synthetic procedures.37,38 The photo anode in our case consists of sensitizer dye molecules which remain embedded in closely packed arrays of CdTe covered TiO2 layers and it is found to exhibit highly improved photon absorption and accelerated electron transport within the DSSC framework. In the course of designing the heterogeneous layered structure (CdTe over TiO2), the reason for selecting low band gap CdTe is the band energy matching of the CdTe conduction band with that of the excited N3 dye (LUMO). This investigation is also focussed on functionalizing the DSSC with regard to the photo assisted charge transfer and the energy conversion in a low light environment using an LED light source. Further, the CdTe loading at the photo anode was optimized to achieve the best performance efficiency in the modified DSSC and the durability of the device was also examined using both bare and modified TiO2 surfaces.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of photo anode

2.1.1 Synthesis of TiO2 matrix. 
For the preparation of TiO2 nanoparticles, the precursor solution consisted of an aqueous solution of 1.5 M ammonium sulfate and 0.75 M titanium(IV) chloride. A total volume of 50 ml of aqueous solution (acidic) was heated and the temperature was maintained at 75 °C for 90 minutes. Ammonium hydroxide solution (2.5 M) was then added dropwise to the acidic solution under high speed stirring until the pH reached 7.0 and the precipitate obtained was collected, repeatedly washed with distilled water and dried at 120 °C.39 The laboratory prepared TiO2 NPs were mixed with commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich) containing both the anatase and rutile phases in 2:3 proportions, finely ground, followed by addition of glacial acetic acid, ethyl cellulose, and terpineol in aqueous ethanol to form a slurry. The mixture was ultra-sonicated for 5 hours and ethanol and water were removed by heating at 80 °C.39 The nano-crystalline TiO2 paste was applied as a uniform thin (∼10 μm) film onto the conducting glass substrate FTO (Dyesol, Australia), by using the Doctor Blade technique.40 The TiO2 coating was further sintered at 500 °C for 30 minutes to obtain the maximum percentage of anatase phase of TiO2 NPs. A working area of 0.5 cm2 of the photo anode was maintained for the DSSC studies.38


2.1.2. Electrodeposition of CdTe overlayer. 
CdTe thin films were electrodeposited onto the TiO2 matrix at room temperature from a solution of 0.2 M CdCl2 and 1.0 mM TeO2 (pH 2) by periodic voltammetry using AUTOLAB 302N Eco-chemie BV (The Netherlands). The cyclic voltammetry was carried out at a scan rate of 0.5 V s−1 within the potential range 0.5 to −1 V in a three electrode assembly cell consisting of a TiO2 coated FTO as the working electrode, an aqueous saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode. The CdTe loading on TiO2 was controlled by periodic scans over 10, 30, 50, 70, 100 120 cycles. The number of cycles was optimized by performance screening of the DSSC through various electrochemical measurements.


2.1.3. Sensitization with N3 dye. 
Each of the CdTe coated TiO2 electrodes as well as the bare TiO2 were immersed in an ethanolic solution containing 1 mM N3 dye at room temperature for 20 hours for complete sensitization. After the sensitizer uptake, the TiO2–CdTe–dye electrodes were washed with ethanol, air dried and made ready for the DSSC fabrication.

2.2. DSSC fabrication
The dye absorbed FTO–TiO2–CdTe electrode and Pt coated FTO counter electrode were assembled together to form a ‘sandwich’ type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of ionomer Bynel (SX1170-60, 50 μm thickness) as the spacer. The electrolyte, consisting of 0.05 M triphenyl methyl phosphonium iodide (TPMPI), 0.5 M sodium iodide (NaI, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05 M iodine (I2, Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile, was injected into the cell from a pre-drilled hole on the counter electrode.39
2.3. Structure, morphology and optical characterization of the photo anode
The morphology of the TiO2–CdTe film regime was determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) using JEOL JSM-6700F (Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using JEOL 2010F (Japan). Structural information was obtained from X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) using a Philips PW 1710 X-ray diffractometer under CuKα radiation of wavelength 1.542 Å. The X-ray machine was operated at 25 kV, 20 mA within a 2θ value between 2° and 90° with an increment of 0.02°. The optical characterization included absorbance spectral measurements of all the anode matrices, carried out with the help of a JASCO V-530 UV-VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer (Japan), in the range 300–1100 nm. The semiconductor nature of the individual matrices (TiO2, CdTe and TiO2–CdTe) was determined with the help of capacitance–voltage measurements and the corresponding records have been included in the ESI,† Fig. S2.
2.4. Photovoltaic measurements
Photo current-density vs. voltage (J–V) plots were recorded in a cell configuration FTO-TiO2(bare/modified)–dye/electrolyte/Pt–FTO with light intensity modulation within the range 10–100 mW cm−2 in an AAA modular solar simulator using an LED light soaker along with a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The transient photo responses of the bare TiO2 and TiO2–CdTe (50 cycles) fabricated cells were recorded in terms of the rise and fall of short circuit current density (Jsc) at 20 second intervals in dark and illuminated conditions using a similar photo-electrochemical set-up. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out with the fabricated DSSC to reveal the interfacial characteristics in terms of electrical and electrochemical parameters. Measurements were recorded by applying sinusoidal perturbation of 5 mV amplitude over a frequency range of 100 KHz to 10 mHz at the respective bias open circuit potential (Voc). The incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the bare TiO2 and TiO2–CdTe were derived as a function of wavelength, using an action spectrum measurement system PEC S20.
2.5. Durability study
The durability of the DSSC system was studied using several techniques: (i) chronoamperometric analysis with the help of an electrochemical work station, as mentioned above, along with an AUTOLAB 302N Eco-chemie BV (The Netherlands) with respect to zero potential at short circuit current density (Jsc) for 3 hours, (ii) J–V measurements for an extended period of 3 hours with 15 minute time intervals,39 and (iii) potentiodynamic polarization of the electrode–electrolyte interface over 3 hours, followed by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) to estimate the amount of Cd2+ dissolved from the over layer.
Tafel plots were derived from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) recorded in aqueous solution containing 0.1 M NaClO4 as supporting electrolyte, within the potential window −1.0 to +1.0 V vs. SCE (W) at a slow scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The Tafel analyses yielded corrosion parameters like corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current (Icorr) and corrosion rate (Rcorr) for each of the TiO2–CdTe films. Voltammetric–amperometric (VA) measurements were carried out by a standard addition procedure with the help of a 663 VA Trace Analyzer (Metrohm Ltd, Switzerland) combined with an AUTOLAB 30 PG-stat using hanging mercury drop (drop size 0.20 mm2) electrode (HMDE) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl [3 M KCl] as reference electrode and a large area glassy carbon electrode as the counter electrode.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Voltammetric deposition of CdTe
The voltammograms recorded for the deposition of a CdTe layer over the TiO2 matrix at various periodic scans are shown in Fig. 1. The formation of CdTe NPs on the TiO2 matrix follows the reduction process, Cd2+ + 2e → Cd and TeO2 + 4H+ + 4e → Te + 2H2O.41 A cathodic hump is observed at around −0.15 V vs. SCE (as shown in the magnified view in the inset of Fig. 1), signifying elemental Te formation immediately followed by CdTe formation on the TiO2 matrix. It may be noted that on the TiO2 surface the deposition potential is positively shifted compared to that on a typical FTO substrate, reflecting changes in surface properties. The increase in the cathodic current at a further negative potential is indicative of H2 evolution in acidic pH conditions. The Cd stripping from the matrix during the anodic sweep is evidenced by the distinct oxidation peak at around −0.2 V vs. SCE(W) in the voltammogram.

3.2. Morphological analysis
The XRD patterns reveal the highly polycrystalline nature of both the bare TiO2 and TiO2–CdTe matrices. The observed Bragg's d value for the TiO2 film is indexed with the help of JCPDS file no. 21-1272 and the corresponding h, k, l values for each of the peaks are presented in Fig. 2a. In the XRD pattern of the bare TiO2 matrix (Fig. 2a), peaks appear at 2θ values 25.2°, 36.9°, 37.8° etc. and the d value corresponding to the [101] plane of anatase TiO2 is found to be 0.35 nm, with a tetragonal geometry. However, small intensity peaks corresponding to the [110], [111], and [220] planes of the rutile phases also arise at 2θ values 27.2°, 41.0°, and 56.5° [JCPDS file no. 21-1276]. The overall impression is of the existence of a major amount of the anatase TiO2 phase with a small amount of the rutile phase in the ceramic oxide matrix. The additional peaks appearing at 2θ values 29.4°, 34.2°, 61.2° and 80.3° [JCPDS file no. 41-0941] correspond to the presence of CdTe. The first three 2θ values show orthorhombic geometry, while the last corresponds to hexagonal geometry. There has been a considerable shift in the peak position of TiO2 A(101) in the TiO2–CdTe XRD pattern from that of the bare TiO2, indicating possible interaction between CdTe and the base matrix (Fig. 2b). Besides CdTe, some of the intermediate products were also identified in the XRD plots, like TeO2, Te, CdO and CdO2 at 2θ values 26.1° [JCPDS file no. 42-1365], 51.2° [JCPDS file no. 18-1324], 65.9° [JCPDS file no. 05-0640] and 78.4° [JCPDS file no. 39-1221], respectively. The crystallite sizes are estimated using Debye Scherrer's equation and found to be within 14–25 nm for TiO2 NPs and 28–29 nm for CdTe NPs. Fig. 3 includes the outline of the fabrication of the TiO2–CdTe matrix and the FESEM images of (a) the TiO2 layer on FTO glass, (b) CdTe deposited on TiO2 over 50 cycles and (c) a cross sectional view of FTO-TiO2–CdTe. Fig. 3d shows the photographs of TiO2 and TiO2–CdTe electrodes fabricated at variable (0–120) periodic cycles prior to sensitization with N3 dye. The SEM images show compact, crystalline and spherical grains of both the semiconductor layers. A typical TEM image shown in Fig. 4a confirms the presence of both TiO2 and CdTe NPs with respective particle sizes in the range 18–22 nm and 28–29 nm, which are almost in agreement with the dimensions obtained from the XRD analyses. Fig. 4b depicts the lattice fringe pattern for the anatase TiO2 plane A(101) and CdTe(001) plane. The inset images represent the FFT pattern showing the TiO2 planes A(101), A(200), A(105), CdTe(001), CdTe(031) and an SADP pattern indicating the polycrystalline nature of TiO2 and CdTe layers, as identified in the lattice planes A(101), A(004), A(105), CdTe(031), A(220). These are consistent with their respective d spacing (JCPDS file no. 21-1272 and 41-0941) and are consistent with those obtained from the XRD analysis.

3.3. Optical characterization
Fig. S1 in the ESI† shows the absorption spectra recorded for pure TiO2, pure CdTe and TiO2–CdTe matrices, and their corresponding derivative plots are shown in Fig. 5. The band gap energy is found to be 3.5 and 1.43 eV for TiO2 and CdTe, respectively, as calculated from the derivative plots. For the pure TiO2 matrix, an absorption peak appears at 354 nm (3.50 eV), while for pure CdTe film, a peak is observed at 865 nm (1.43 eV). Eventually for the composite matrix of TiO2–CdTe the respective peaks appear at 355 nm and 860 nm, showing the existence of both TiO2 and CdTe in the matrix. The band gaps of the individual components CdTe–TiO2 are only feebly shifted to the respective low and high energy bands, attributable to the interaction between the two low and high energy materials.

3.4. Optimizing illumination intensity
Intensity modulation was carried out in the range 10 to 100 mW cm−2 using bare TiO2 in the DSSC configuration FTO–TiO2–dye/electrolyte/Pt–FTO, as represented by the J–V plots in Fig. S3 of the ESI.†Fig. 6 demonstrates that Jsc increases gradually, while PCE (η%), after a steady increase, becomes constant in the range 40–70 mW cm−2, but declines beyond this intensity level. Thus it is implied that energy harvesting in a moderate intensity range 40–70 mW cm−2 becomes fruitful and the rest of the investigations were conducted under an illumination of 50 mW cm−2.

3.5. Optimization of CdTe loading over TiO2 surface
The J–V plots for the fabricated DSSC using TiO2–CdTe at various loadings of CdTe (variable number of cycles in periodic voltammetry) are shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† The evaluated DSSC parameters Jsc, FF% and PCE for each of the loadings are plotted in Fig. 7 and summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† A distinct crest is observed for each of the functional parameters, Jsc at 12.3 mA cm−2, PCE at 11.10% and FF% at 55.7. Tuning of the CdTe layer over TiO2 anode over 50 cycles, therefore, appears to be critical for obtaining the best performance of the fabricated DSSC. Considering the potential output of the J–V records, the CdTe level on TiO2 was fixed at 50 deposition cycles for the rest of the investigations.

Fig. 7(b–d) demonstrates the error bars for the respective profiles of the photo conversion efficiency (η%), fill factor (FF%) and current density (mA cm−2) of the DSSCs with respect to the voltammetric cycles used for the deposition of the CdTe layer over TiO2. For a better understanding, various plots are shown separately here and also included in the ESI† and the mean deviation for each of the records was obtained from four repeated experimental results. Average mean deviations derived were ±0.009 for efficiency, ±0.024 for the fill factor and ±0.033 for the short circuit current density.
3.6. Electrochemical performances of bare TiO2 and CdTe modified TiO2 photo anodes
The EIS records for the bare TiO2 and TiO2–CdTe (50 cycles) elucidate the electronic and ionic features at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces. Fig. S5 in the ESI† shows the Nyquist plots with the equivalent circuit diagram (EC) and the inset represents the magnified view in the high frequency region. The respective EIS parameters like solution resistance (RS), charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode (RCE) and electron transport resistance at the anode (RCT) as derived from the Nyquist plots are summarized in Table S2 in the ESI.†42 The charge transfer resistances at both the electrode–electrolyte interfaces are significantly reduced for the modified cell system. The bare TiO2 surface shows an RCT value of 61.1 Ω, which is reduced to 8.30 Ω for TiO2–CdTe, indicating rapid transfer of the photo generated electrons at the TiO2/CdTe–N3/electrolyte junction, improving the DSSC kinetics. The other derivative Bode plot (phase shift plot, θ vs. logf) in the inset of Fig. S5(c) (ESI†) reveals the effect of impedance on frequency.43 At low and high frequency limits, the EC behaves primarily as a resistor and the phase shift is close to zero. At an intermediate frequency, the capacitance impedance increases and the cell shows a capacitive nature.
The photovoltaic performances for bare and modified TiO2 are compared in the J–V plots (Fig. 8a) and the derived parameters are summarized in Table S1 as ESI.† A considerable increase from 8.63 mA cm−2 to 12.3 mA cm−2 for Jsc and from 6.7% to 11.1% for the conversion efficiency η% are observed with the modified matrix. Thus deposition of an additional film of CdTe brings an effective improvement in Jsc of 42.52%, in FF of 14.7% and in efficiency of 67% with respect to bare TiO2. The inset of Fig. 8a shows the transient photoresponse of the fabricated DSSC in terms of the rise and decay curves of photo-current density (Jsc) during alternate exposure of the films to illuminated (50 mW cm−2) and dark conditions. The higher output current of the multilayered TiO2–CdTe structure is indicative of much improved functional behaviour compared to the bare TiO2. The power characteristic of the device with bare TiO2 and CdTe coated TiO2 anode is demonstrated in Fig. S6 in the ESI,† where the maximum power obtained for the modified matrix is raised by almost 66% compared to the bare TiO2 matrix. The IPCE spectrum demonstrates the quantum yield for the photon to electron energy conversion process within the DSSC framework. Fig. 8b represents the IPCE patterns of the DSSC using the bare and modified TiO2 matrices. The maxima in both cases correspond to the dye absorption region. The % IPCE is remarkably raised throughout the visible range for the CdTe coated TiO2 matrix and exhibits an almost 51% increase from the 34% of the bare TiO2 matrix to 69% for the TiO2–CdTe matrix. In fact, the junction area at the electrode–electrolyte heterogeneous interface increases due to the (TiO2/CdTe multilayer) structure and promotes the uni-directional electron flux of the charge carriers. At the same time, the strong spectral coupling of the concurrent band levels of the CdTe (CB) and the dye (LUMO) elongate the optical path contribution to faster electron injection to the TiO2 conduction band.

3.7. Reaction sequences in the modified DSSC

Fig. 9 shows a schematic of the photocurrent generation at the dye–electrode of the modified DSSC with relative band energy displays for each of the photo-components of the multilayered structure of the anode, coupled with a Pt cathode and I3−/I− used as the redox electrolyte. Photo excitation of the dye(S) to dye*(S*), (HOMO → LUMO), occurs in harmony with the absorption of photon by the semiconductor CdTe NPs (valence band → conduction band) providing an extended optical path length towards enriching the carrier density at the TiO2 conduction band. It may be understood that the similar energy levels of the excited dye and the semiconductor NPs may be attributed to the delocalization of electrons that are favourably donated to the TiO2 energy bands, leaving behind the oxidised dye S+ (S* → S+ + e) and significantly arresting the reductive quenching of the excited dye. The simple and easy fabrication of CdTe NPs on the TiO2 layer increases the dimension of the reaction zone at the hetero-junction multilayered anode structure and induces rapid charge transfer across the TiO2/CdTe/dye interface. On the other hand, at the enhanced junction area of the CdTe/electrolyte interface, more hole consumption is achieved by the redox mediator [reaction (1)]. At the same time, the cathodic reaction of I3− is accelerated [reaction (2)] and dye is regenerated by the reduced form of the redox mediator [reaction (3)], suppressing the back reaction rate of the photo injected electrons to the electrolyte. (1) (2) (3)

3.8. Durability studies
The chronoamperometric measurements were continued for 3 hours in the TiO2 and TiO2–CdTe configured DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 10a. The current density (Jsc) decay with time was evaluated from the expression,36  where, δ is the decay of current density with time, i0 is the initial current density back extrapolated from the linear part of the chronoamperogram, t is the time in minutes. There is a 10 times diminution of current with the incorporation of CdTe into the titania matrix. In order to shed light on the stability of the DSSC system, J–V records were continued for 3 hours at 15 minute intervals taking the bare TiO2 matrices, as shown in Fig. S7 of the ESI.† As expected, impressive results were obtained with the TiO2–CdTe system (Fig. 10b), where the changes in photovoltaic parameters after 3 hours were found to be 11.10% to 10.60% for PCE (η%) and 12.30 to 12.0 mA cm−2 for Jsc. These values appear to be quite insignificant for a prototype DSSC fabricated in the laboratory.

The CdTe coated TiO2 matrices were subjected to potentiodynamic polarization in aqueous medium. The LSV derived the Tafel plots, as shown in Fig. 11a. Electrochemical corrosion parameters were evaluated for the CdTe deposited TiO2 by the voltammetric cycles (30, 50 and 70) with the help of a procedure similar to that described in our earlier studies and summarized in Table 1.44 The corrosion rates were recorded in terms of extent of mass loss, kg cm−2 s−1 with the help of Faraday's laws and using the expression:  where, EW is the equivalent weight of the semiconductor material.

The overall stability of the CdTe coated TiO2 matrices is particularly good, showing feeble corrosion current in the range (1–2.5) × 10−7 A cm−2. 50 voltammetric cycles appears to be the optimal level for CdTe deposition, showing minimum corrosion current and corrosion rate. The current–potential plots derived from the ASV records were further analysed to evaluate the Cd2+ leached out from the matrix during polarization. Fig. 11b and c represent the typical ASV plot for the optimal CdTe loading (50 cycles) and the corresponding current–concentration [Cd+2] plot, respectively. The amount of Cd2+ dissolved during polarization was estimated by using the equation:44ip = 2.69 × 105 × A × D½ × C0 × n × v½where, ip is the peak current, A is the surface area of the mercury drop (mm2), D is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), C0 is the bulk concentration of the measurand (mol L−1), n the number of electron transfers during the charge transfer process and v is the scan rate (V s−1). The set of current–potential as well as current–concentration (Cd+2) profiles for TiO2–CdTe matrices after 30 and 70 cycles of deposition are shown in Fig. S8 and S9 of the ESI.† The evaluated ASV parameters are summarized in Table 1 where the Cd2+ concentrations were found to be of the ppm order (∼1.5 ppm), and appear to be insignificant even under strongly polarized conditions for an extended period of 3 hours.
In summary, the series of performance and durability studies show that the concerted effect of CdTe and dye conjugation is no doubt beneficial for a system demanding rapid electron transport and longevity of the device with minimal loss of energy efficiency.
4. Conclusion
A strong partnership is built between the dye and co-sensitizer CdTe overlayer at an optimal level on a TiO2 matrix which becomes highly effective at panchromatic light harvesting through the DSSC phenomenon. A modified heterojunction DSSC with a high-low band gap semiconductor matrix induces an additional 42% short circuit current density and produces a high level of photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE 69%) in the visible range compared to a bare TiO2 (IPCE 34%) system. The current output decay can be reduced by 10 times with CdTe coverage on a TiO2 matrix and the J–V records demonstrate much improved stability of the modified system during prolonged operation of the DSSC. The present study therefore seems to open a new approach towards rapid electron extraction in a DSSC framework.
