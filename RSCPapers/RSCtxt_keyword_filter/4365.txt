    , Accepted 4th June 2013First published on 5th June 2013AbstractIon exchange using aerosol OT (AOT) offers dye adsorption twice as fast as known methods. Moreover, it suppresses the dye-agglomeration that may cause insufficient dye-coverage on the photoelectrode surface. Consequently, its dual function of fast dye-loading and higher dye-coverage significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), consisting of a wide band-gap semiconductor film, a dye and an electrolyte, are regarded as a promising alternative to commonly used silicon-based photovoltaic cells.1 The most commonly used dye in high-performance DSCs is bis(tetrabutylammonium)cis-dithiocyanatobis(2,2′-bipyridine-4-COOH,4′-COO−)ruthenium(II) (known as N719).2 Instead of the dicarboxylic acid groups of the N3 dye,3 N719 has dicarboxylate anionic groups with bulky TBA+ (tetrabutylammonium) counter-ions, which requires a longer adsorption time onto the TiO2 electrode: ∼3 h for N3 versus ∼24 h for N719 (Fig. S1a and b†).4 Despite the prolonged process, N719 has been more widely used because of its higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) than N3. It is known that Voc of DSCs is determined by the proton concentration at the electrode/electrolyte interface.5 Since each N719 dye molecule provides fewer protons than N3, a smaller amount of protons are adsorbed on the basic sites of the TiO2 surface, leading to the shift of the Ecb (the energy level of the conduction-band edge) to negative, thereby improving Voc. Up to now, fast dye-adsorption has been achieved mainly through thermal and electrical methods.6–10 However, these processes may cause severe aggregation of dye molecules.
In view of the kinetic problem associated with the adsorption of the N719 dye, it is of scientific and technological importance to develop a new scheme for efficient dye-loading. Herein, we propose a convenient chemical method for efficient dye-loading of N719 by exploiting the ion exchanger, aerosol OT (AOT; sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate).11 This treatment offers fast dye-adsorption and reduced dye-agglomeration (Scheme 1). The AOT consists of a small ionic head group (SO3−) with a Na+ counter-ion and hydrocarbon tails, as shown in Fig. S1c.†12
 Scheme 1  Comparison of two dye-adsorption processes: a slower adsorption of N719 (a) versus a faster adsorption of N719 with AOT (b). The ion exchanger, AOT, is composed of (i) a small ionic head group (SO3−) with a Na+ counter-ion and (ii) hydrocarbon tails. 
About 12 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes were prepared to investigate the effect of AOT ion exchangers on the dye-adsorption. For this, two distinct dye solutions were first prepared: (i) 0.5 mM N719 dissolved in absolute ethanol (for film A) and (ii) 0.5 mM N719 and 0.3 mM AOT in absolute ethanol (for film B). The amount of the adsorbed N719 dye was measured using UV-Vis spectroscopy (see Fig. S2† for details). Fig. 1 presents representative UV-Vis spectra of two films. It is observed that the adsorption rate for film B is markedly faster than that of film A. (In contrast, AOT did not affect the adsorption rate for the TBA+-free N3 system, as shown in Fig. S3.†)
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of detached dye solutions obtained from film A (a) and film B (b) processed at various sensitization times with 0.5 mM N719 ethanolic solution. Molar quantities (c) and Arrhenius plots (d) of adsorbed N719 on the TiO2 surface as a function of temperature. 
The surface coverage of N719 was strongly influenced by the immersion temperature (at a fixed immersion time of 19 h). It is shown that the dye-coverage is linearly increased until a plateau is observed at ∼49 °C (Fig. 1c). It is notable that the number of the adsorbed N719 molecules is higher in film B as compared with that of film A. Thus, it can be thought that the binding mode of N719 on the TiO2 surface is determined not only by the process temperature but also by the ion exchanger, AOT. An Arrhenius plot was constructed to determine the effect of AOT on the dye-loading kinetics (Fig. 1d).13,14 The activation energy of film B is estimated to be ΔEB = 5.3 kJ mol−1. This is 32% lower than the value obtained for film A (ΔEA = 7.8 kJ mol−1), which supports a faster dye-loading process of film B.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to obtain the binding energies of N719 with and without AOT (Fig. S4†). Three characteristic peaks in the N 1s spectra correspond to the nitrogen in the NCS groups, the terpyridine/bipyridine ligands, and the nitrogen in TBA+ (the counter-ions to the carboxylate groups of N719), respectively.15 Upon addition of AOT, the TBA+ peak was shifted by 0.2 eV towards a higher binding energy (Fig. S4a†). On the other hand, the doubly bonded O 1s peak, corresponding to the COO− group of N719, was shifted by 0.2 eV towards a lower binding energy (Fig. S4b†). XPS results, thus, indicate that the chemical environments surrounding the TBA+ counter-ion and the COO− group in N719 vary significantly upon addition of the AOT ion exchanger.
It has been reported that the sulfonate group (in AOT) is a strong cation exchanger while the carboxylate group (in N719) is a weak cation exchanger.16,17 In general, ion exchangers are bound to the ions with higher polarizability. Since TBA+ ions possess higher polarizability than Na+ ions, the SO3− groups of AOT molecules tend to bind to TBA+ ions rather than to Na+ ions. On the other hand, the COO− groups of N719 are likely to interact with Na+ ions for the charge compensation.18 On the basis of this argument and the previous UV-Vis/XPS results, we present an ion-paring mechanism in Scheme 1 that is relevant to the observed faster dye-loading of film B, where AOT molecules play an essential role in the enhanced dye-loading.
Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were recorded to analyze the bonding structure between N719 molecules and the TiO2 surface (Fig. 2). The ratio of weakly adsorbed dye molecules was estimated by comparing the two characteristic peak intensities (Fig. 2a): the 1375 cm−1 stretching mode (from COOH groups chemically bonded to the TiO2 surface), and the 1715 cm−1 CO band (from COOH groups of the weakly physisorbed dye molecules).5,19,20 The resulting values show the degree of dye-aggregation. It was calculated that ∼23.1% of the N719 dye molecules are weakly adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface in film A. In contrast, only ∼17.9% of the dye molecules are weakly adsorbed in film B. Thus, it can be deduced that the ion exchanger, AOT, promotes the adsorption density of the chemically bonded dye molecules (Fig. 1c) and, thus, can effectively reduce the dye aggregation (Scheme 1). As the symmetric SO (vsSO3) stretching band (1055 cm−1) was not observed in the ATR-FTIR spectrum of film B, it can be ascertained that most of the AOT molecules were removed after sufficient rinsing.

In the longer wavenumber region (2800–3000 cm−1), v(C–H) intensity of TBA+ ions is noticeably decreased in film B, as compared with the value obtained for film A (Fig. 2b). This indicates that N719 molecules prefer to make the ion pairing with Na+ ions, instead of TBA+ ions, as a result of the ion exchange in film B (Scheme 1b).5 The overall device stability can be qualitatively assessed by detaching N719 molecules from the TiO2 surface using a basic solution. Fig. 2c compares the top view images of two samples before and after soaking in 1 mM KOH aqueous solution for 10 min. It is obvious that film B is more resistant to the decoloration than film A. Indeed, the addition of AOT influenced the bonding nature of N719 molecules, which reduces the number of weakly adsorbed dyes.13
As a next step, two distinct photoelectrodes were prepared to investigate the effect of AOT on the photovoltaic performance. For this, an ∼12 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film was deposited on the transparent F-doped SnO2 substrate. In order to improve red-light harvesting, an ∼6 μm-thick film composed of TiO2 scattering particles (the average diameter of ∼400 nm) was used as an over-layer on an ∼12 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film to construct a bi-layer structure. DSCs were fabricated according to the detailed procedure described in the ESI.† The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of two distinct devices are shown in Fig. 3, where * denotes the photovoltaic cell composed of a scattering over-layer. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1.† The employment of the ion exchanger, AOT, markedly improves the overall conversion efficiency by virtue of an enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) and a short-circuit current density (Jsc): maximum 9.2% with Voc of 817 mV and Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2 (device B*) versus 8.4% with Voc of 796 mV and Jsc of 15.8 mA cm−2 (device A*); maximum 8.1% with Voc of 820 mV and Jsc of 15.2 mA cm−2 (device B) versus 7.3% with Voc of 802 mV and Jsc of 13.7 mA cm−2 (device A) (see Fig. S5 and S6† for details).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiment was performed to understand the observed efficiency improvement in terms of the enhanced recombination lifetime. It is widely known that the second semi-arc at a low-frequency region represents the recombination resistance (Rct) between the electrode and the electrolyte in Nyquist plots (Fig. 4a). Rct was estimated to be 15.2 Ω and 18.5 Ω for devices A and B, respectively. The recombination life time (τr) of each device was evaluated from the characteristic peak frequency (fr) in the low frequency region (<102 Hz) of the Bode-phase plots in Fig. 4b, which clearly shows the enhanced τr of device B (τr = 1/2πfr). This result implies that the charge recombination is greatly suppressed at the electrode/electrolyte interface of device B, which reduces the dark current–density, and eventually promotes Voc.

Here, Rs is the series resistance of the cell including the TCO sheet resistance, RPt is the charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode (platinized FTO), and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance of the charge recombination between the electrons in the TiO2 and the oxidized form of the redox couples in the solution. 
The enhanced Jsc value of device B can be explained in terms of the charge-injection kinetics. It has been reported that the charge-injection rate from the non-aggregated dyes to the TiO2 conduction band is three orders of magnitude faster than that from the dye aggregates,21 which is widely considered as a crucial parameter for the photocurrent generation.22–25 Accordingly, it can be inferred that the presence of AOT improves Jsc of DSCs by virtue of suppressed dye-aggregation and efficient charge-injection.
In summary, we have utilized the ion-exchange mechanism between N719 and AOT molecules in order to facilitate faster dye-loading and higher dye-coverage. Indeed, the presence of AOT molecules reduced the activation-energy barrier by 32% in the dye-adsorption process. Moreover, the ion exchanger played an important role in reducing the number of the weakly adsorbed dyes. Consequently, AOT-based DSCs exhibited a noticeable improvement in the overall conversion efficiency: maximum 9.2% with Voc of 817 mV and Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2versus 8.4% with Voc of 796 mV and Jsc of 15.8 mA cm−2 for the reference device. Therefore, the AOT-assisted ion-exchange mechanism can be exploited as a versatile method for fast dye-adsorption.
