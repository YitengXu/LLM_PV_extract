    , Accepted 9th January 2018First published on 10th January 2018AbstractNon-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their good optical absorption and convenient structure modification. Some small molecular acceptors such as ITIC have exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance. Based on these acceptors, it is very important to screen donor materials to further improve the performance. The benzotriazole-based polymer is an important type of donor material, especially for non-fullerene PSCs. We have designed and synthesized a type of benzotriazole-based conjugated polymer with a 2D expanded side chain. These polymers exhibit good crystallinity in films. Non-fullerene PSC devices based on polymer:ITIC show a PCE of 8.03% with a high JSC of over 17 mA cm−2, which might be attributed to its good crystallinity. This result indicates the advancement of the 2D extended structure in the design of a high performance polymer.
Introduction
Solution processable polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their potential in the fabrication of flexible, light-weight and cost-effective devices.1 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture has been proven to be an effective approach for high-efficiency solar cells. The active layer is a blend film of p- and n-type semiconductors as electron donor and acceptor materials, respectively. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BHJ solar cells have increased from 1% to ∼10% with fullerene derivatives as the acceptor in the past decade,2–5 which is achieved by the efforts on donor material design and device optimization. PSC efficiency is influenced by many factors, such as optical absorption, carrier mobility, film morphology, etc. So a systematic optimization of the chemical structure and device engineering is important to obtain a high performance solar cell.
Fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), are excellent electron acceptors for solar cells due to their properties of high electron mobility, low lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and distinct isotropic charge transport.6 However, the drawbacks are also obvious, such as high cost in preparation, low absorption in the visible light range, difficulty in chemical structure modification, instability of blend film, etc.7 Due to the above reasons, non-fullerene acceptors have attracted wide attention in recent years, and PCEs of over 10% have been achieved, which show wide prospects for high performance solar cells.8 These non-fullerene acceptors include polymers based on naphthalene diimides (NDIs), small molecules based on perylene diimides (PDIs), A–D–A type small molecules and so on. These acceptors usually exhibit a wide absorption range and high coefficient for visible light, which is the main disadvantage of fullerene acceptors.
The A–D–A type small molecular acceptor, such as ITIC or IEIC, exhibits good photovoltaic performance, which is ascribed to its good absorption, electron mobility and phase separation.9 These molecules can be easily constructed by selecting different donor and acceptor units. So the absorption and energy levels can be modulated according to different donor materials applied in the active layer. Various types of donor materials achieved good results coupled with this type of acceptor. Except for the well-known narrow and medium band gap materials applied in fullerene solar cells,10 some wide band gap materials come back to the spotlight, which was grossly underemphasized in the fullerene solar cells.2,11 Triazole-based conjugated polymers usually show moderate efficiencies with PCBM as an acceptor.12 However, the PCE of this kind of polymer increased greatly to about 10% with ITIC as an acceptor, which is one of the state-of-the-art efficiencies.13 In our previous work, 2D conjugation extended structures have been anchored to the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit and the corresponding polymers show good performance especially in short circuit density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) with PCBM as an acceptor.14 In order to further investigate the effect of this π-extended conjugation structure,15 we have developed two benzodithiophene (BDT)–benzotriazole alternative copolymers PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N, as shown in Scheme 1. Biphenyl and naphthalenyl groups are appended to the BDT unit to extend the conjugation length, respectively. These polymers exhibit similar wide optical band gaps of about 1.8 eV. Good efficiencies of 8.03% and 6.61% were realized for the device with PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N as a donor material, respectively. This research indicates that the introduction of a more extended 2D conjugated side chain would be an important approach for further modulation of conjugated polymers for PSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Polymers PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N were synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction as shown in Scheme 1; the detailed synthetic procedure is provided in the ESI.† Two polymers show limited solubility at room temperature, but they are readily soluble at 80 °C in chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), which enable the polymers can be fabricated into device through the solution processed method. Molecular weight was measured by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C with polystyrene as the reference. The number-averaged molecular weights were 35k and 27k for PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N, respectively. The thermal properties were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen. The decomposition temperatures were 370 °C and 389 °C for PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N, respectively, which indicate that both polymers are stable for photovoltaic device fabrication.
Optical and electronic properties
The absorption spectra of polymers PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N in solid films and in solution are displayed in Fig. 1. Two polymers show a similar absorption profile in solution and films due to their same conjugated backbone. Strong shoulder peaks are observed in the solution and films for both polymers, which indicate an ordered aggregation and an intense π–π stacking interaction.1c Polymer PBDTTz-BP is slightly red-shifted compared to PBDTTz-N with absorption maxima of 591 nm to 588 nm. Comparatively, PBDTTz-BP exhibits a wider peak width than PBDTTz-N in the film, which is in favor of optical absorption. The optical band gaps are calculated to be 1.93 eV (PBDTTz-BP) and 1.95 eV (PBDTTz-N) from the absorption onset, which is complementary to the absorption of ITIC.

(c) Normalized UV-vis absorption spectrum of PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N in chlorobenzene solution (sol.) and in neat films (f.). (d) Cyclic voltammogram for PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N. 
The molecular energy levels of PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from the onset of oxidation and reduction potential, assuming that the Fc/Fc+ had an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV in vacuum.16 The HOMO level of PBDTTz-BP was determined to be −5.25 eV, which is slightly lower than the HOMO level of PBDTTz-N (−5.23 eV). A lower HOMO level of PBDTTz-BP is in favor of achieving a higher VOC of the PSC's device. The LUMO levels are also calculated to be −3.49 eV and −3.52 eV for PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N, respectively. The HOMO levels of PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N are 0.23 and 0.25 eV higher than that of ITIC,9a which is smaller than the suggested empirical offset of 0.3 eV for efficient charge dissociation.17 Despite this, some reports show that this offset is not absolutely necessary for non-fullerene PSCs.18 Since CV measurement usually suffers from film delamination and low response issues, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted to determine the HOMO energy levels (Fig. S3, ESI†). According to the UPS results, the HOMO energy levels of PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N were −5.11 eV and −5.01 eV, respectively (Table 1). Comparatively, the HOMO energy levels show a larger difference in UPS than in CV measurement.

Theoretic calculations were also carried out to investigate the molecular structure and energy levels by using density functional theory (DFT). It is observed that there is only a small difference in the HOMO energy levels due to the same backbone for these two polymers. Comparatively, PBDTTz-BP exhibits a slightly lower HOMO level than PBDTTz-N (−4.92 eV vs. −4.90 eV), which is consistent with the CV and UPS experimental results.
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PBDTTz-BP and PBDTTz-N, fullerene-free polymer solar cell devices were fabricated with the conventional architecture of indium–tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:ITIC/Ca/Al. All the active layers are spin-coated from a hot chlorobenzene solution. Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best PSC devices under illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. As an optimization of photovoltaic performance, the polymer:ITIC ratio was varied from 1.5:1, 1:1 to 1:1.5 (w/w) and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† For PBDTTz-BP, a maximum PCE of 8.03% was achieved with a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 17.74 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.56. As CN was used as processing additive, the PCE is reduced to 6.99%. In spite of a slightly higher VOC obtained, JSC is reduced to 15.0 mA cm−2. Comparatively, the device of PBDTTz-N exhibits a lower optimized PCE of 6.61% than PBDTTz-BP with a VOC of 0.75 V, a JSC of 18.0 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.49. It is observed that both polymers show high JSC values as they have a similar molecular structure and absorption profile. These results also indicate that the polymers with an 2D expanded conjugated structure are in favour of achieving a high JSC. A moderate FF value is a critical factor for the device performance. In order to further investigate this phenomenon, series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) are calculated from the J–V curves (Table 2). It is observed that the addition of CN can induce the increase of Rs and reduction of Rsh in spite of retention of the FF value, which would reduce the JSC of the device. As a result, the pristine-based active layers show a higher JSC for both devices.

An external quantum efficiency (EQE) test is performed to confirm the high JSC value from the J–V test. As is shown in Fig. 2, the EQE spectra covered a broad spectral range from 300 to 800 nm, indicating that both donor and acceptor in the active layer contribute to the photovoltaic performance. The devices fabricated without additives show a higher photo response, which is well consistent with the result from the J–V test.
In order to further investigate the effect of additive on the photovoltaic performance, the electron and hole mobilities of the polymer:ITIC blend films were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, as summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities of PBDTTz-BP:ITIC are 1.32 × 10−4/0.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a pristine blend film and 1.57 × 10−4/8.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the blend film processed with CN. As for the blend film of PBDTTz-N:ITIC, the μh/μe are 1.25 × 10−5/3.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the pristine film and 3.66 × 10−5/4.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 processed with CN. It is observed that PBDTTz-BP:ITIC shows more balanced hole/electron mobilities than PBDTTz-N:ITIC, which would benefit from the favorable blend film morphology. As a result, the PBDTTz-BP:ITIC blend exhibits a higher FF value in photovoltaic performance.
Morphology
To explain the photovoltaic performance of two polymers in PSC devices, we have investigated the blend film morphology of polymer:ITIC by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Fig. 3). The AFM image of the PBDTTz-BP blend film exhibits a smooth morphology with a root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.56 nm for the as-cast film and 1.54 nm with CN as an additive. Comparatively, the PBDTTz-N blend film shows a slightly higher RMS of 2.65 nm and 1.56 nm, respectively, processed without and with CN. It is observed that both blend films become smoother with the addition of CN. Nanoscale phase separation morphologies were investigated by TEM measurement. The TEM images show a similar tendency to AFM studies. Both blend films show a weak phase separation and nanoscale phase separation is not well formed, which are not favorable for charge transport. As a result, these two blend films just exhibit moderate mobilities and FF values.19

Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) was also carried out to investigate molecular orientation and packing.20 The GIWAXS profiles of the neat and blend films of polymers are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and Fig. 4. PBDTTz-BP shows an obvious (010) diffraction peak located at qz ≈ 1.63 Å−1, indicating a strong preference for the face-on orientation relative to the substrate that is beneficial to charge transport in the vertical direction.21 Similarly, PBDTTz-N exhibits a (010) peak at qz ≈ 1.61 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction. The diffraction peaks for ITIC are detected for π–π stacking and lamellar stacking in both blend films. Two (010) peaks are well-separated in the out-of-plane direction, which indicate that the donor and acceptor materials can maintain their crystallinity in the BHJ blend film. Comparatively, PBDTTz-BP shows a more intense (010) peak than PBDTTz-N, which indicates more ordered molecular packing for PBDTTz-BP. Well-ordered molecular packing is beneficial for keeping their charge mobility in the blend films.

Conclusions
In conclusion, two 2D conjugated benzodithiophene-alt-fluorobenzotriazole copolymers with biphenyl and naphthalenyl groups as the side chains were designed and synthesized as the donor material for non-fullerene PSCs. Due to the incorporation of the more extended 2D conjugated side chain, the polymers exhibit a high JSC of over 17 mA cm−2 in PSC devices. The film morphology was investigated by 2D GIWAXS, and it shows that both the polymers and ITIC maintain their crystallinity in their blend films, which is beneficial for high JSC values. This result indicates that incorporation of a more extended 2D conjugated polymer is of great potential for exploring high-performance PSCs.
Experimental
Materials
All reactions were carried out under Ar. Common solvents were dried and purified by standard procedures. All column chromatography was performed with the use of silica gel of 200–300 mesh. Monomer and polymers were synthesized according to reported procedures.13 Other reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used directly unless otherwise noted.
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
Conventional PSC devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/Ca/Al. The ITO-coated glasses with a nominal sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, ultrapure water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol subsequently. After a 10 min oxygen plasma treatment, a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (30 nm) was spin-coated onto the ITO anode and then dried at 160 °C for 20 min. The polymer and ITIC were dissolved in chlorobenzene with a total concentration of 14 mg mL−1. The solution was stirred overnight and spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the active layer was ∼100 nm. Finally, 10 nm Ca and 100 nm Al layers were successively thermal evaporated onto the active layer at a pressure of 4.0 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the device in this work was 0.1 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2420 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) from a Newport solar simulator. A standard silicon solar cell was used to calibrate the light intensity. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the PSCs were measured using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.
