    , Accepted 2nd April 2018First published on 3rd April 2018AbstractFour heterocyclic spiro-type hole transporting materials (HTMs) carrying a spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) (SFX-TPAM and SFX-TPA) or spiro[fluorene-9,9′-thioxanthene] (SFT) unit (SFT-TPAM and SFT-TPA) were synthesized through a low-cost facile route with high yields for perovskite solar cell (PSC) applications. In terms of absorption, these four compounds in the film state are all transparent at wavelengths longer than 430 nm, which is beneficial for allowing visible light to reach the perovskite active layer without being absorbed by the hole transporting layer (HTL). The photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs based on these small molecular HTMs with the device architecture of glass/ITO/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag was tested. Only SFX-TPAM had its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level matched with the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3. The inverted PSC based on a dopant-free SFX-TPAM HTL achieves a power conversion efficiency of 10.23% under the illumination of standard one sun lighting, which is better than that (8.17%) of the cell based on dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD. The better photovoltaic performance of SFX-TPAM compared to spiro-OMeTAD may be due to the MAPbI3 film deposited on it having better quality. These results indicate that the facilely synthesized, low-cost SFX based small molecules can be used as the HTMs for PSCs.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention in the past 5 years.1–3 To date, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has reached more than 22%.4 The inverted (p-i-n) PSCs exhibiting a PCE of 20% have drawn increasing attention in recent years.8–10 Inverted PSCs are attractive, due to the advantages of low temperature processing, hysteresis-free performance and simple architecture. The charge transporting materials play an important role in PSCs as they match the frontier orbital energy levels of the absorber and transport the free carriers to the corresponding electrodes.5–7 Several polymer based hole transporting materials (HTMs), such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS),9–13 poly-(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA),14,15 and poly(N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine) (poly-TPD),5,16 have been used in PSCs to achieve high PCE. On the other hand, small molecule based HTMs are also very attractive due to their easy purification, high purity, and no batch-to-batch variations. Spiro-OMeTAD is the most commonly used small molecular HTM but it needs a multistep synthesis, as a result of which, its high price hinders further progress. Moreover, spiro-OMeTAD has low hole mobility, which makes it necessary to be doped with lithium salt and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP). These additives are hydrophilic, which causes the instability of the devices. Furthermore, the doping of the hole-transporting layer (HTL) may lower the device reproducibility due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant. Therefore, new small molecule based HTMs used in PSCs have been developed.17–21 Among them, spirobifluorene, having a spiro structure with an sp3 carbon connecting two orthogonal π systems together, is a good choice because the rigid spiro-conjugation can enhance the hole transporting ability by a hopping process.22,23 The spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) core has received increasing attention due to its competitive facile synthesis by a one-pot method.24 The perpendicular spiro structure in the SFX-based building units can effectively inhibit intermolecular π–π stacking and thus improve the solubility while retaining good hole mobility. SFX based small molecules have thus been widely used in high performance organic electronics25 and organic light emitting devices.26–28 SFX-based HTMs functionalized with an electron-donating bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline or bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine group have been used in regular type PSCs, showing impressive PCEs of over 20%.29–32 Thus, the high performance and low-cost synthesis of SFX based HTMs render them a promising alternative HTM for use in PSCs. Spiro[fluorene-9,9′-thioxanthene] (SFT) is another interesting building block with a structure similar to SFX, in which the bridge atom is sulfur instead of oxygen. SFT is widely used as an HTM in organic photovoltaics (OPVs)33 and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).34,35
In this work, we report the synthesis and photovoltaic performance of two SFX and two SFT based small molecules in which the SFX or SFT unit was functionalized with 4-methyl-N-phenyl-N-(p-tolyl)aniline (TPAM) or triphenylamine (TPA), respectively. The chemical structures of these four new small molecular HTMs: 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-di-p-tolylaniline) (SFX-TPAM), 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-diphenylaniline) (SFX-TPA), 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(spiro[fluorene-9,9′-thio-xanthene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-di-p-tolylaniline) (SFT-TPAM) and 4,4′,4′′,4′′′-(spiro-[fluorene-9,9′-thioxanthene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetrayl)tetrakis(N,N-diphenylaniline) (SFT-TPA) are displayed in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The chemical structures of four new spiro-based HTMs. 
These four new spiro-based HTMs were designed to exhibit increased mobility to avoid the side-effect of the dopants used in spiro-OMeTAD and to tune the surface properties for depositing high quality perovskite film. The propeller-like TPA serves as a building block to construct molecules with high hole mobility.36 The electron donating TPAM and TPA on the central core unit were used to promote π–π stacking for efficient charge transport and increase the surface hydrophobicity. The non-planar spiro-based architecture makes the molecules soluble in common organic solvents, which is conducive to the fabrication of devices using wet chemical processes such as spin-coating. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness and ease of synthesis are merits for these spiro-based small molecules to be used as the HTM in PSCs to achieve low-cost devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and physicochemical studies
All chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. PbI2 (99.999% from Aldrich), CH3NH2(aq) (40% from TCI), HI(aq) (57% from Aldrich), Bathocuproine (BCP) (Aldrich) and C60 (Solenne B. V., Netherlands) were used in this study. CH3NH3I was synthesized from CH3NH2(aq) and HI(aq) with a method similar to that reported in the literature.371H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker 300 MHz NMR spectrometer using CDCl3 as a solvent. FAB-MS spectra were obtained using a JMS-700 HR-MS. UV/Vis absorption spectra were measured using a Cary 300 Bio spectrometer. Emission spectra were measured using a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA JOBIN YVON) at an excitation wavelength of 500 nm. HPLC grade CH2Cl2 was purchased from ACROS Co. and was distilled over CaH2 under an argon (Ar) atmosphere for electrochemical study. Tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was recrystallized from ethanol twice and then stored in a desiccator to be used as an electrolyte. The glassy carbon working electrode was polished with 0.05 mm alumina on Buehler felt pads and was ultrasonicated for 2 min to remove the residual contamination. A platinum wire was used as the auxiliary electrode and a home-made Ag/AgCl, KCl (sat’d) electrode as the reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M TBAPF6 dissolved in CH2Cl2 and the amount of HTMs was ca. 5 mg. The cyclic and square-wave voltammograms (frequency: 25 Hz; step potential: 0.0051 V; amplitude: 0.01995 V) were recorded using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands) and ferrocene was used as a calibration standard (0.54 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained from a Hitachi S-800 microscope at 10 kV. Samples for SEM imaging were mounted on a metal stub with a piece of conducting tape and then coated with a thin layer of platinum film to avoid charging. The thickness of the films was measured from the cross section SEM images. Hole mobility was measured according to a method based on the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model described in the literature,38,39 using a diode configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/Au. The I–V curves were measured under dark conditions using a Keithley Model 2400 unit. The slope of the logJ vs. logV curve was used to evaluate the SCLC region and the mobility of the HTLs was calculated according to the Mott–Gurney law. The detailed analysis method can be found in the (ESI†).

2.3 Device fabrication and characterization
Prior to the fabrication, ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with DI water, followed by acetone and isopropanol. Subsequently the substrates were dried and UV-ozone treated for 10 min. The substrates were then transferred into a glove box. The HTM solution (5 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin coated onto the ITO and annealed at different temperatures for 5 min. The perovskite precursor solution (1.25 M) was prepared by mixing CH3NH3I and PbI2 (molar ratio 1:1) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/γ-butyrolactone (GBL) mixed solvent (volume ratio 3:7). The perovskite precursor solution was then spin-coated on the HTL using one-step spin-coating combined with the anti-solvent washing method (1000 rpm for 35 s, 5000 rpm for 15 s and toluene was dropped on the film in the last 5 s of spinning) to form a full coverage perovskite film. The substrate was thermally annealed at 100 °C for 5 min and subsequently the electron transporting layer (50 nm of C60), buffer layer (5 nm of BCP) and Ag electrode (100 nm) were deposited by high-vacuum thermal evaporation. The current density–voltage (I–V) curves of the cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit under AM1.5G solar simulator light (Oriel 91, 150 V, using a xenon lamp) calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a KG-5 silicon reference cell. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) or incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air immediately after sealing the device with a silica sealant. A chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for phase sensitive detection with the QE-R3011 measurement system designed by Enlitech Inc., Taiwan.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The SFX core was prepared by a one-pot, non-solvent synthetic method40 using readily available starting materials such as phenol and methane sulfonic acid, with the yield of 75%. Brominated SFX (SFX-Br4) was prepared by reacting SFX with Br2 at room temperature to obtain a yield of 78%. The SFX-TPAM and SFX-TPA were synthesized by Stille coupling using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst and toluene as the solvent as illustrated in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  The synthetic scheme of the four new spiro-based HTMs. 
Stille coupling between SFX-Br4 and stannated TPAM afforded SFX-TPAM with the yield of 85%. A similar method was used for reacting SFX-Br4 with stannated TPA to obtain SFX-TPA with a yield of 78%. The SFT core was synthesized in one step from dibenzo-[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide and 9H-thioxanthene in the presence of KHMDS with the yield of 76% using the method reported in the literature.41 SFT was brominated with Br2 at room temperature to form SFT-Br4 (73% yield). Stille coupling reactions similar to that used for preparing SFX-TPAM and SFX-TPA mentioned above were used to obtain the final products SFT-TPAM and SFT-TPA with the yields of 71% and 73%, respectively. All new compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HR-MS as described in ESI.† These four compounds have good solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, toluene, chloroform and chlorobenzene.
3.2 Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of these new spiro-based molecules in dichloromethane and solid film form are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The absorption peaks at 350–420 nm were assigned to the π–π* transition of the entire molecules. Substitution of a sulfur atom by an oxygen atom on the spiro-core caused no significant change in the absorption profile. In dichloromethane, the λmax values of SFT-TPAM (399 nm) and SFT-TPA (395 nm) are slightly longer than those of SFX-TPAM (385 nm) and SFX-TPA (391 nm), respectively. The absorption spectra of the films are quite similar to those of the corresponding solutions, except the bands are broader due to the molecular aggregation in the solid state films. All the new HTMs show very low absorption at wavelengths longer than 430 nm in the film state, which is beneficial for use as an HTL in an inverted PSC. The optical band gaps of the HTMs were calculated from the onset of the absorption spectra (in CH2Cl2) and the optical properties of the new HTMs as well as spiro-OMeTAD are summarized in Table 1.

The emission of the HTMs in dichloromethane at room temperature is shown in Fig. 3(c). All the HTMs have a broad photoluminescence band in the range of 400–600 nm, which comes from the π*–π transition. The λEm values lie in the following order: SFX-TPA (441 nm) ≈ SFT-TPA (442 nm) < SFX-TPAM (452 nm) ≈ SFT-TPAM (456 nm). SFX-TPAM and SFT-TPAM have a red-shift in the PL peaks compared to SFX-TPA and SFT-TPA, respectively. This could be attributed to the fact that TPAM has a stronger electron-donating ability than TPA, and a similar tendency was observed in the absorption spectra. The Stokes shifts (the difference between the λmax of the absorption and emission peaks) of SFX-TPA and SFT-TPA (2900 and 2690 cm−1 respectively) are smaller than those of SFX-TPAM and SFT-TPAM (3850 and 3130 cm−1 respectively), which is due to the latter couple having larger geometry differences between the ground and excited states, arising from the increased number of nonhindered inter-ring torsional angles.22
3.3 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical behaviors of the HTMs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). All four molecules show quasi-reversibility in the first oxidation/reduction couple at the potential of 0.5–1.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Similar potentials were observed in the SWV curves as in the CV curves. The CV and SWV diagrams are displayed in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  The cyclic voltammograms (CV) and square wave voltammograms of the four new HTMs. 
SFX-TPAM, containing the electron rich 4-methyl-N-phenyl-N-(p-tolyl)aniline, shows the lowest first oxidation potential of 0.51 eV. In contrast, the triphenylamine-containing SFX-TPA is oxidized at a more positive potential of 0.87 eV. The spiro[fluorene-9,9′-thioxanthene] based SFT-TPAM and SFT-TPA are oxidized at even more positive potentials of 0.99 and 1.01 eV, respectively. The presence of a sulfur atom (instead of an oxygen atom) on the heterocyclic spiro core makes a significant change in the oxidation potentials, but only a small change to the absorption profiles. This is because the interaction between the 3p orbital of S and the π orbitals of the phenyl ring is weaker than that between the 2p orbital of O and the π orbitals of carbons. The same characteristic has been observed in other SFT core based small molecules.26
The HOMO energy levels of SFX-TPAM and SFX-TPA calculated from the oxidation potentials are −5.21 and −5.57 eV, respectively, whereas SFT-TPAM and SFT-TPA have the HOMO energy levels of −5.69 and −5.71 eV, respectively. The optical band gaps estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra (in CH2Cl2 solution) are 2.29 eV (SFX-TPAM), 2.94 eV (SFX-TPA), 2.88 eV (SFT-TPAM) and 2.93 eV (SFT-TPA). The LUMO energy levels were calculated from the optical band gap and HOMO levels, and all the data are also summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 5. Fig. 5 reveals clearly that only SFX-TPAM has a HOMO energy level that matches with the HOMO of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.4 eV), which was used in this paper to provide sufficient hole extraction capabilities, although all the new HTMs can block electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer to the ITO electrode within the PSC.

3.4 Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of all four new HTMs used in inverted PSCs was investigated, even though the HOMO levels of three of them do not match the HOMO energy of MAPbI3. The structure of the cell is ITO/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag (see Fig. S1, ESI†) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The data clearly reveal that the cell based on a dopant-free SFX-TPAM HTL has much higher PCE compared to those using the other three HTMs. For comparison, cells without an HTL or using a dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD HTL were also tested and the best PCEs of 5.87% and 8.17%, respectively, were achieved (see Table 2). The frontier orbital energy levels of the new HTMs and MAPbI3 illustrated in Fig. 5 reveal that besides spiro-OMeTAD, only SFX-TPAM has a suitable HOMO (−5.21 eV) level for MAPbI3 (HOMO: −5.4 eV) to transport its photoexcited holes. That is the reason that SFX-TPAM has the best photovoltaic performance. After optimizing the spin rate for depositing perovskite film and the film post-thermal annealing temperature, the highest PCE of 10.23% was achieved for the cell based on an SFX-TPAM HTL. Cells based on SFX-TPA, SFT-TPAM and SFT-TPA HTLs, which have HOMO levels lower than that of MAPbI3, show PCEs even lower than the cell without an HTL, due to the hole blocking HOMO level and insulating nature of the organic molecules. Moreover, the inverted PSC based on an SFX-TPAM HTL exhibits higher efficiency compared to that using a dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD HTL under the same device fabrication processes.

The I–V and IPCE curves of the cells based on dopant-free SFX-TPAM and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs displayed in Fig. 6 clearly disclose that the inverted PSC based on the former HTL has larger Jsc (the Jsc integrated from the IPCE spectra is consistent with that obtained from the I–V measurements). Interestingly, Fig. 6(b) reveals that the PSC based on an SFX-TPAM HTL has a lower IPCE value at short wavelengths, but at higher wavelengths longer than 635 nm its IPCE is comparable to the cell based on a spiro-OMeTAD HTL. This may be due to the difference in perovskite film quality which will be discussed in more detail later. SFX-TPAM and spiro-OMeTAD have the right HOMO level to transport holes from MAPbI3 to the electrode but show different photovoltaic performances. It is useful to know various properties, such as the surface hydrophobicity, hole mobility and charge extraction ability, of these two HTMs to learn how to design small-molecule HTMs for inverted PSCs.

3.5 Surface hydrophilicity, hole mobility and charge extraction ability of SFX-TPAM and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs and the quality of the perovskite films deposited on the two HTLs
The surface wetting capability of HTLs is an important factor that affects the morphology of the perovskite films deposited on them and therefore the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding PSC. The water contact angles of SFX-TPAM and spiro-OMeTAD are 97° and 85°, respectively (pictures of the H2O wetting are shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). SFX-TPAM has a slightly hydrophobic surface42 while the surface of spiro-OMeTAD is weakly hydrophilic according to the definition by Quere42 although the hydrophobicities do not differ significantly. A recent study43 suggests that a highly hydrophobic surface will facilitate the formation of perovskite films with larger grains although it was found that an inverted PSC based on the very hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS HTL exhibited the highest efficiency of 20%.9 We found that the perovskite films deposited on the more hydrophobic SFX-TPAM HTL have much larger grains compared to those coated on the spiro-OMeTAD surface as shown in the SEM images displayed in Fig. 7. Therefore the superior photovoltaic performance of the SFX-TPAM HTL may due to the MAPbI3 film deposited on SFX-TPAM having larger grains. However, there are numerous holes on the large perovskite grains. As a result the PSC based on an SFX-TPAM HTL exhibits only 10% efficiency. The UV/Vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films on both HTLs are illustrated in Fig. S3, ESI.† It can be seen that MAPbI3 deposited on SFX-TPAM has weaker absorption at short wavelengths but stronger at long wavelengths compared to that coated on a spiro-OMeTAD HTL. This is due to the difference in the light scattering of the perovskite films, which have different morphology. Nevertheless, the absorption spectra are consistent with the IPCE curves displayed in Fig. 6(b).

The SCLC model is widely used to estimate the carrier mobility of thin semiconductor films without knowing the conductivity (or carrier intensity)44 of the sample. The hole mobilities of these new HTMs were also investigated by SCLC according to the Mott–Gurney law.45 A hole-only device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/Au was fabricated and its I–V curve in the dark was measured. The intercept of the logV vs. logJ curve (with a slope of 2) was used to calculate the hole mobility as reported previously.46 The I–V curves of the hole-only devices based on SFX-TPAM and spiro-OMeTAD are displayed in Fig. S4, ESI† and the corresponding hole mobility data are also displayed in the insert of the figure (the principle of SCLC theory used to calculate the charge mobility is also described under Fig. S4, ESI†). The SFX-TPAM film has the hole mobility of 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is lower than that (5.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the spiro-OMeTAD film. Therefore the difference in the photovoltaic performance is not due to the hole mobility of the HTLs, but instead mainly due to the quality of the perovskite films coated on them. PL spectra can provide information regarding the quality of the perovskite films and the charge extraction capability at the CH3NH3PbI3/HTL interface. The PL intensity (shown in Fig. 8) of CH3NH3PbI3/SFX-TPAM is weaker than that of CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD, and both are lower than CH3NH3PbI3/ITO which has no HTL, indicating that both SFX-TPAM and spiro-OMeTAD HTLs can extract holes from the perovskite absorber. CH3NH3PbI3/SFX-TPAM has a weaker PL peak but lower hole mobility than CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting that the hole extraction is not totally determined by the hole mobility, as the two HTLs have the same order of magnitude of mobility. The PSC based on an SFX-TPAM HTL has a higher Jsc value (19.12 mA cm−2) than that using a spiro-OMeTAD HTL (17.02 mA cm−2), which is because an MAPbI3 film with bigger grains was formed on the SFX-TPAM HTL as revealed by the SEM images displayed in Fig. 7.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, four heterocyclic spiro-type HTMs, namely SFX-TPAM, SFX-TPA, SFT-TPAM and SFT-TPA, were synthesized by a few synthetic steps with cost-effective upscaling. The structure-physicochemical property relationships of these four molecules were well-studied and their application as HTLs in inverted PSCs was investigated. It was found that when sulfur was introduced onto the spiro-core (replacing oxygen) this lowered the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the molecules due to the weak interaction between the 3p orbital of the sulfur atom and π-orbital of the phenyl ring. On the other hand, adding electron-donating alkyl groups would presumably raise the HOMO level (such as the SFX-TPAM/SFT-TPAM pair). As a result only SFX-TPAM has a HOMO level sufficiently compatible with that of MAPbI3 perovskite to achieve good photovoltaic performance. The inverted PSC based on a dopant-free SFX-TPAM HTL achieves a high PCE of 10.23% which is higher than that (8.17%) of the cell using dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD as an HTL. The better performance of the SFX-TPAM HTL is due to its high mobility, which enables it to extract holes more efficiently compared to dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD.
