    , Accepted 7th March 2019First published on 8th March 2019AbstractIn this work, we assess the possible reasons for the differences observed in open circuit voltage (VOC) in mixed cation perovskite solar cells when comparing four different hole transport materials (HTMs), namely TAE-1, TAE-3, TAE-4 and spiro-OMeTAD. All these HTMs present close chemical and physical properties, however, once they are finally deposited onto the perovskite layer, the HTMs provide different performance characteristics. Additional to the evaluation of the HTM influence on recombination, we find that, upon deposition of the organic HTM on top of the perovskite, there is an important change in the energy level position, and the impact on the device VOC is discussed. We consider that this experimental observation could be general for other organic HTMs and would justify the difficulties in finding molecules and materials that could improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells overcoming the solar-to-energy conversion efficiency of solar cells made using spiro-OMeTAD as a hole selective contact.

Broader context
Hybrid perovskite-based solar cells have thrilled researchers in photovoltaics because of their ease of fabrication, high efficiencies, and versatility. The possibility of synthesizing hybrid perovskite semiconductors with completely different stoichiometries and the variety of electron and hole selective contacts that can be employed in the solar cell stack have allowed the scientific community to fine-tune photovoltaic device properties spanning from tandem to flexible solar cells. Yet, such a wide range of possibilities implies a laborious optimization of each of the many parameters. This exploratory work is complicated by the gaps in the perovskite solar cell internal mechanisms picture. In this study, we focus on the interface between the hybrid perovskite absorber and the selective hole transport layer, scrutinizing the influence of the latter on the achievable open circuit voltage and its relation with carrier losses (recombination). We study the band energy alignment at the interface, the surface recombination and their complex interplay by comparing four similar-but-different hole transport materials: spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1 and the novel TAE-3 and TAE-4 in combination with cesium-containing triple cation perovskite. Our study illustrates the importance of measuring the band alignment of the organic semiconductor when deposited onto a perovskite thin film and its correlation with the interfacial carrier recombination kinetics and the solar cell open circuit voltage.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have become the focus of intense research due to their outstanding performance in hybrid photovoltaic devices.1 Perovskite solar cells without the use of a HTM have achieved efficiencies of 16%,2 way below the efficiencies of standard perovskite solar cells using HTMs.1spiro-OMeTAD is the material of choice for most reported examples of triple cation (formamidinium, methylammonium, cesium) mixed halide (bromide, iodide) lead perovskite solar cells3 with the FTO/d-TiO2/CsFAMAPbIBr/HTM/Au structure, where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide, d-TiO2 is a dense layer of titania, and Au is the gold anode. In spite of the tremendous interest in developing novel HTMs for replacing the expensive spiro-OMeTAD, improving power conversion efficiency and cell stability, it is still unclear how to rationalize HTM design. Although one significant design parameter for maximizing the VOC is the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, a clear correlation is not always found among the published results.4–9 A complication in determining the role of the HTM in device performance is that changing the HTM often affects other photophysical properties of the solar cell with a significant impact on the photovoltaic behaviour.
In a previous communication, aiming to match or improve the performance of the spiro-OMeTAD based devices, we reported the easy synthesis of a new organic HTM: TAE-1 (Fig. 1).10,11 However, despite its promising properties, with a slightly deeper oxidation potential in comparison with spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 2), the solar cells fabricated with TAE-1 were unable to overcome the VOC values of the perovskite solar cell obtained using spiro-OMeTAD (Table 1).

The oxidation potential values approximating the HOMO of TAE-1, TAE-3, TAE-4 and spiro-OMeTAD have been estimated from cyclic voltammetry in solution (see Fig. S11, ESI†). The direct optical band gap has been determined by the Tauc plot in solution (see Fig. S19 and S20, ESI†).

In this work, not only we replicate our observation on more HTMs, namely TAE-3 (3,3′,6,6′-tetrakis[N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-bifluorenylidene) and TAE-4 (3,3′,6,6′-tetrakis(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)-9,9′-bifluorenylidene, see Fig. 1), but we also move one step further and get insight into the origin of the observed differences in VOC. Unlike our previous communication,10 where a 400 nm layer of mesoporous titanium oxide (m-TiO2) was used as a scaffold for the perovskite, herein, we investigate the VOC differences in planar junctions fabricated without this m-TiO2 and deposit the perovskite layer directly over the dense titanium oxide layer (d-TiO2), forming an n-type selective contact. This architecture reduces the device complexity as one of the interfaces is suppressed, the interfacial area between the electron transport material (ETM) and perovskite is further defined, and ensures complete coverage of the titanium oxide by the perovskite layer avoiding possible contacts between ETM and HTM that could create non-desired charge transfer pathways.12
We evaluate in this study the influence of the molecular energetics, in other words, the different driving forces for the charge transfer process between the HTM and the perovskite (Fig. 2), and the charge recombination between electrons at the perovskite and holes at the HTM on the VOC observed in devices employing TAEs or spiro-OMeTAD. As the stack underlying the HTM is identical for all the studied devices, the relationship between the VOC and the ETM or the perovskite characteristics13 will not be considered.
The usage of advanced time-resolved techniques, such as photo-induced charge extraction (CE) and photo-induced transient photo-voltage (TPV),4,14 allows us to determine the impact of the HTM on the energetics distribution and charge recombination kinetics under different light intensity working conditions.15–18 Further insight on the role of the interface energetics is provided by analysing the work function (WF), determined from contact potential difference (CPD) measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) in order to contrast the results obtained by CE and validate that method.19,20
Results and discussion
In a previous communication,10 we compared the novel TAE-1 molecule with the reference spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM for methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cells with mesoporous TiO2 as the ETM. Here, we investigate, in depth, the influence of the HTM on the VOC of a triple cation perovskite solar cell with planar TiO2 as ETM and we introduce two novel HTMs from the same family of TAE-1, which are TAE-3 and TAE-4.
These new derivatives were prepared following a straightforward two-step synthetic procedure. The synthetic route illustrated in Scheme S1 (see ESI† for more details) allowed us to obtain TAE-3 and TAE-4. Firstly, 3,3′,6,6′-tetrabromo-9,9′-bifluorenylidene was obtained from a one-pot reaction by treating 3,6-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-one, synthesised by reported procedures,10,21 in the presence of Lawesson's reagent in refluxing toluene. Finally, p-methoxydiphenylamine or 3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazole was covalently linked to the central unit by a four-fold Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reaction to obtain TAE-3 and TAE-4, respectively, in good yields. The complete structural characterization of the final compounds TAE-3 and TAE-4 and the corresponding intermediates was accomplished using standard spectroscopic techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FTIR, and UV-visible spectroscopies (see ESI†). The 1H NMR spectra of the final molecules reveal the characteristic signals of the bifluorenylidene core (two doublets and one double doublet corresponding to 4 protons each) and the representative signals of the donor units. In addition, the mass spectrometry HRMS [MALDI-TOF] (Fig. S3 and S8, ESI†) confirmed the presence of TAE-3 with a molecular ion peak [M]+ at 1236.5029 m/z and TAE-4 at 1228.4446 m/z. The hole mobility of the novel HTMs is not dissimilar to the spiro-OMeTAD one, being 5.9 × 10−5, 8 × 10−4, 7 × 10−4 and 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TAE-1,10TAE-3, TAE-4 and spiro-OMeTAD,10 respectively (see Fig. S12, ESI†). Additional to the experimental measurement of the oxidation potential of TAE-3 and TAE-4 (see Fig. 2 and Fig. S11, ESI†), theoretical calculations were used for predicting the HOMO and LUMO energies of all the novel HTMs (see Table S1 and Fig. S13–S15, ESI†). The oxidation potential of the HTMs follows the relation TAE-3 < spiro-OMeTAD < TAE-1 < TAE-4, with the HOMO of TAE-4 the closest to the valence band (VB) of the perovskite. We note that the values of the HOMO derived from the cyclic voltammetry oxidation potential, using a reported linear relation,22 can differ from those obtained in the solid state, for example, by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Nonetheless, as a first approximation, we use these values with the complementarity of DFT theoretical results. Fig. 2 illustrates the trend for the HOMO values as a result of our experimental and theoretical approach.22 However, it is possible to undergo both a shift in the HOMO and LUMO energy or a change in the oxidative doping density upon deposition of the HTMs onto the perovskite thin film, as will be explained further in this paper.
The perovskite solar cells using as HTM either one of the TAEs or spiro-OMeTAD were fabricated using the procedure described in detail in the ESI.† All comparisons were carried out within the same set of solar cells and confirmed on at least two independent sets of devices. Every HTM was deposited by spin-coating obtaining similar thicknesses of ∼50 nm (see Fig. S29, ESI†). The average and champion device performance parameters are listed in Table 1; and Fig. 3 shows the reverse current–voltage scans. The complete statistics, including forward scan data, scans at different velocities and at different illumination intensities, can be found in Fig. S30–S39 (ESI†). The most interesting observation extracted from Table 1, and focused on the subject matter, is the larger VOC in devices with spiro-OMeTAD, which is contrary to the predicted dependence23–25 on the ionization potential, i.e., a larger VOC would be expected for TAE-1 and TAE-4 than for spiro-OMeTAD. The average VOC of the spiro-OMeTAD devices differs from those of the TAE-1 and TAE-4 devices by 90 and 170 mV, respectively.
 Fig. 3  The current–voltage curves of the most representative perovskite devices using spiro-OMeTAD (green round points), TAE-1 (orange square points), TAE-3 (purple diamond points) and TAE-4 (magenta triangle points) as HTM under 1 sun conditions (1000 W m−2) and in reverse scan (forward curves are shown in Fig. S31, ESI†). 
On performing the current–voltage scans at various light intensities, we obtained an ideality factor (see Fig. S36–S39, ESI†) of 1.57 for spiro-OMeTAD, 1.44 for TAE-1, 1.79 for TAE-3 and 1.83 for TAE-4, respectively. From this, we can state that the TAE-3 and TAE-4 trap states contributing to the interfacial Shockley Read Hall (SRH) recombination are deeper in energy than those in spiro-OMeTAD and TAE-1.26 We carried out time-resolved electrical measurements to assess how the HTM influences the free charge distribution and recombination lifetime in the complete devices. These time-resolved techniques allowed us to determine the different origin of recombination in other types of solar cells such as organic solar cells18,27 and dye-sensitized solar cells.28,29 On the one hand, CE has been used previously to obtain the free carrier density in a device at different light bias (device VOC at different light intensities), the charge distribution versus voltage, which is known to be very sensitive to the presence of additives,30–32 and differences in the HOMO energy level,33,34 leading to sensible shifts of the measured charge distribution. The charge extraction of devices was measured using the same system as described in depth elsewhere by our group.35 Due to the short measurement time window (10 μs, see Fig. S40, ESI†), we did not observe any contribution from ionic migration,36 which would give a small and long lasting displacement current at larger time scales.35,37 The charge distributions of all devices were obtained and are shown in Fig. 4, and each experimental curve can be fitted to a linear plus exponential dependence law. The linear component is caused by the geometric capacitance of free charges accumulating in the selective contacts.14,18 Since this capacitance follows the parallel-plate capacitor model (C = εA/d), with the main parameters being the thickness of the perovskite layer (d), its static permittivity (ε) and the active area of the device (A), no significant difference in thickness was observed for the different devices (see linear region in Fig. 4), considering that the active area and the materials (perovskite and organic layer) are alike. Once the photo-induced quasi-Fermi splitting in the perovskite layer approaches the built-in potential (HTM HOMO and ETM LUMO energy difference), the depletion layers in the contacts start to saturate20,38 and the photo-generated charges will be stored in the perovskite layer,39 increasing their chemical potential. This regime is commonly known as chemical capacitance or quantum capacitance and is revealed by an exponential increase in the charge versus light bias voltage plot. As can be observed in Fig. 4, the voltage at which the chemical capacitance becomes relevant for each cell follows the trend TAE-4 < TAE-3 < TAE-1 < spiro-OMeTAD. From such shifts, we can infer that there is a difference in the energy offsets with respect to the perovskite valence band (VB), with the most favourable alignment for spiro-OMeTAD. This is in correlation with the built-in voltage, and, as the ETM is the same for all the samples, also with the HTM HOMO energies, spiro-OMeTAD being the deepest. Interestingly, this order does not relate to the HOMO level as measured by solution cyclic voltammetry as shown in Fig. 2. This discrepancy can arise from differences between the solution and solid state,19,40–42 due to chemical reactivity43 or intermixing with the perovskite layer components.20,44

The dark solid lines are the data fits using a linear plus exponential model y = Ax + BeCx. The light colour solid lines at the graph bottom represent only the exponential part of the fits: y = BeCx. 
When using different HTMs for fabricating a perovskite solar cell, the resulting VOC will mainly relate to the respective HOMO energy level,45,46 as well as the recombination constant17 and density of states disorder.47 In our case, we will not consider the density of states disorder as we presume that it will not differ significantly for molecules with such similar chemical structures as the ones studied here. A deeper HOMO level, which is a bigger built-in voltage, allows the solar cell to reach a higher VOC.45,46,48 This intuitive relation can be rationalized as follows, considering the ETM/perovskite/HTM interfacial recombination:26,49,50 (a) the VOC is the applied voltage where the amount of recombination equals the amount of photo-generation; (b) the interfacial SRH recombination is proportional to the electron or hole concentration in the perovskite at the interface with the HTM or ETM, respectively;51 (c) these concentrations increase after the filling of the contacts’ depletion layers, which happens when the quasi-Fermi level splitting in the perovskite (that is the origin of the VOC)49,50 approaches the built-in potential. Coherently, the aforementioned order of HOMO energies as obtained by the exponential onset in charge extraction (Fig. 4) is reflected by the order of average VOC in Table 1: spiro-OMeTAD > TAE-1 > TAE-4 ≈ TAE-3.
In order to analyse first the influence of the recombination, we carried out TPV measurements on the devices under open circuit conditions. For all HTMs, the device's TPV transient decays (see Fig. 5, Fig. S41 and S42, ESI†) lead, through exponential decay fitting, to lifetimes at 1 sun illumination of the same order of magnitude, from 0.4 to 1.1 μs (see for each device the rightmost point in Fig. 5 and Fig. S41, ESI†). We can safely state that the bulk radiative recombination is negligible compared to the interfacial recombination, as in cesium containing triple cation mixed halide perovskite, the charges’ diffusion length has been reported in the micrometre when isolated,52 and it gets notably reduced when sandwiched between the HTM and ETM extracting layers.4 From the observation of the cross-sectional SEM (Fig. S29, ESI†) and top-view AFM (Fig. S21 and S24–S26, ESI†) and ESEM (Fig. S22, ESI†), we can also exclude the significant presence of pinholes in the perovskite layer. More interestingly, referring to the transient decay lifetimes at different light intensities from TPV (see Fig. S42, ESI†) to the obtained chemical charge, subtracting the charge accumulated in the geometric capacitance, from CE (see Fig. 4) we obtain a direct relationship between free charge lifetime and charge density in the perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. 5. The choice of subtracting the charges accumulated in the contacts comes from the consideration that the interfacial SRH recombination is mainly influenced by changes in the low concentration of carriers in the perovskite layer rather than by the high concentration of majority carriers in the doped contacts.35,51
 Fig. 5  Charge carrier lifetime (obtained via TPV) at different chemical charges (as opposed to charges assigned to geometric capacitance, obtained from the exponential part of CE in Fig. 4) of spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1, TAE-3 and TAE-4 devices. The solid lines correspond to the respective fittings to a power law equation (y = y0 + Ax−λ).33 
As can be seen in Fig. 5, the slopes for all the devices are similar, indicating a common main carrier recombination pathway. In fact, the recombination order Φ obtained from the exponent λ of the power law fit (see caption of Fig. 5, Φ = 1 + λ) is 1.5 for TAE-1 cell, 2.0 for TAE-3 cell, 1.8 for TAE-4 cell, and 1.8 for spiro-OMeTAD cell (values compatible with reports on surface recombination via deep-traps), indicating that the recombination between electrons from the perovskite and holes from the HTM is the key loss mechanism in these devices and other recombination processes (at the contacts or due to the transport of the charges) can be neglected.26,53
Further inspection of Fig. 5 shows that the recombination lifetime at the same chemical charge density, for example at 10−9 C cm−2, though shorter for TAE-4 and longer for the other HTMs, does not drastically differ. However, the perceived tendency does not correspond to the trend observed in VOC (Table 1).
Once demonstrated that the carrier recombination between the electrons in the perovskite and the holes in the distinct HTMs is not the key factor that determines the experimental VOC, we examine next the impact on the vacuum level misalignment at the different heterojunctions.
To evaluate any possible deviation in the relative alignment of the HTMs’ HOMO on the FTO/d-TiO2/CsFAMAPbIBr layer, as is suspected from the CE results, the WF was experimentally determined for the different layer stacks from the CPD measurements via KPFM (see ESI†). As can be seen in Fig. 6, the obtained WF of the FTO/d-TiO2/CsFAMAPbIBr surface is 4.04 ± 0.04 eV, which is comparable with the reported value for MAPbI3 perovskite on n-type substrates.54,55 When the HTMs are deposited on top of the perovskite, vacuum level (VL) alignment is basically fulfilled for spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1 and TAE-4, while the relative work function of TAE-3 with respect to that of the perovskite leads to an upward shift of the VL as large as ∼200 mV. This implies an upward shift of the HOMO of TAE-3 from the VB of the perovskite, within the rigid band model.
 Fig. 6  (left) CPD measurements between the KPFM tip and the surfaces of pristine CsFAMAPbIBr and the different HTM devices (spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1, TAE-3 and TAE-4). The corresponding WF values obtained from the parabolic fit of the data (see ESI†) are given in the schematics (right) of the proposed energy diagram. The corresponding vacuum level (VL) shifts are obtained from the WF values. 
It has been demonstrated that noticeable alterations in the electronic distribution can occur upon contacting the molecules designed as a HTM with the perovskite layer induced by the generation of interfacial dipoles, enhancing or disfavouring the electric field that facilitates the charge separation and the extraction. This confirmed a new parameter to take into account in the design of new molecules as hole transport materials in perovskite solar cells, which is not as easy to predict.
In agreement with previous works,6,9 our results show that the design of new HTMs, for optimizing the solar cell performance and obtaining a higher VOC in the heterojunction, does not only consist of lowering the HOMO energy level. Notwithstanding that the lower VOC for TAE-3 can be correlated with its less favourable energy alignment with the perovskite and its larger interfacial recombination with respect to the other HTMs, the fact is that for TAE-1, TAE-4 and spiro-OMeTAD, the VOC shows no correlation with the corresponding HOMO level position.
The whole experimental data and analysis presented here suggest that for the design of novel HTMs that aim to overcome the solar to energy conversion of spiro-OMeTAD, careful analysis of the energetics at the interface between the organic semiconductor material and the perovskite must be taken into account in conjunction with carrier mobility properties and interfacial carrier recombination processes.
Conclusions
We present a thorough investigation with the aim of shedding light on the underlying reason for the changes of the open-circuit voltage in mixed cation perovskite solar cells using two already known and two unpublished hole transporting materials: spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1, TAE-3 and TAE-4, all with quite similar chemical structures. The choice of these HTMs is not arbitrary as they contain the most common moieties used in the myriad of novel HTMs described in the scientific literature focussed on perovskite solar cells. We observe how the energy levels as obtained by the cyclic voltammograms are a valid starting point when trying to predict the device characteristics. However, as we have demonstrated, it is possible that the HOMO energy values differ importantly when the organic semiconductor molecule is deposited on top of the perovskite semiconductor material.
By means of photo-induced charge extraction, we have been able to obtain a better indication of the HOMO level position of the HTM when layered in a solar cell stack. Kelvin probe force microscopy has been employed as a local probe for confirming the work function actually in place in a complete and functional device. Complementing this experimental information with the study of the interfacial recombination processes occurring under solar cell operando conditions – via the photo-induced transient photovoltage – has allowed us to disentangle the complex influence of the HTM on the device photovoltaic performances. The shift of the energy levels of the TAE molecules upon contact with the perovskite layer, together with changes in recombination rate, influences the measured VOC values, which are notably different from the expected ones related to the HOMO energy values inferred from the cyclic voltammetry experiments further supported by the advanced DFT calculations.
We have shown that the design of a HTM that can reach the expected maximum theoretical efficiency in perovskite solar cells will require fine-tuning of the energetics at the interface between the HTM and the perovskite, for instance the use of a self-assembled monolayer of molecular dipoles, etc., without increasing the interfacial carrier recombination processes between the HTM and the semiconductor perovskite.

Broader context
Hybrid perovskite-based solar cells have thrilled researchers in photovoltaics because of their ease of fabrication, high efficiencies, and versatility. The possibility of synthesizing hybrid perovskite semiconductors with completely different stoichiometries and the variety of electron and hole selective contacts that can be employed in the solar cell stack have allowed the scientific community to fine-tune photovoltaic device properties spanning from tandem to flexible solar cells. Yet, such a wide range of possibilities implies a laborious optimization of each of the many parameters. This exploratory work is complicated by the gaps in the perovskite solar cell internal mechanisms picture. In this study, we focus on the interface between the hybrid perovskite absorber and the selective hole transport layer, scrutinizing the influence of the latter on the achievable open circuit voltage and its relation with carrier losses (recombination). We study the band energy alignment at the interface, the surface recombination and their complex interplay by comparing four similar-but-different hole transport materials: spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1 and the novel TAE-3 and TAE-4 in combination with cesium-containing triple cation perovskite. Our study illustrates the importance of measuring the band alignment of the organic semiconductor when deposited onto a perovskite thin film and its correlation with the interfacial carrier recombination kinetics and the solar cell open circuit voltage.


 	Fig. 1  Molecular structures of spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1, TAE-3 and TAE-4.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematics of the energy diagram for the materials in the perovskite solar cells studied in this work. The oxidation potential values approximating the HOMO of TAE-1, TAE-3, TAE-4 and spiro-OMeTAD have been estimated from cyclic voltammetry in solution (see Fig. S11, ESI†). The direct optical band gap has been determined by the Tauc plot in solution (see Fig. S19 and S20, ESI†).	 



Spiro-OMeTAD
	23.0 (21.4 ± 1.6)a	1.13 (1.07 ± 0.06)	0.75 (0.68 ± 0.11)	18.4 (15.6 ± 3.1)

TAE-1
	20.2 (20.2 ± 0.9)	1.02 (0.98 ± 0.03)	0.69 (0.60 ± 0.10)	14.3 (11.8 ± 2.1)

TAE-3
	22.5 (22.5 ± 1.9)	0.93 (0.89 ± 0.04)	0.74 (0.71 ± 0.06)	15.3 (14.1 ± 1.4)

TAE-4
	24.2 (21.0 ± 1.8)	0.97 (0.90 ± 0.06)	0.71 (0.61 ± 0.09)	16.5 (11.6 ± 2.8)

 	Fig. 3  The current–voltage curves of the most representative perovskite devices using spiro-OMeTAD (green round points), TAE-1 (orange square points), TAE-3 (purple diamond points) and TAE-4 (magenta triangle points) as HTM under 1 sun conditions (1000 W m−2) and in reverse scan (forward curves are shown in Fig. S31, ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 4  Charge from CE at different light bias voltages for solar cells with TAE-1, TAE-3, TAE-4 and spiro-OMeTAD. The dark solid lines are the data fits using a linear plus exponential model y = Ax + BeCx. The light colour solid lines at the graph bottom represent only the exponential part of the fits: y = BeCx.	 

 	Fig. 5  Charge carrier lifetime (obtained via TPV) at different chemical charges (as opposed to charges assigned to geometric capacitance, obtained from the exponential part of CE in Fig. 4) of spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1, TAE-3 and TAE-4 devices. The solid lines correspond to the respective fittings to a power law equation (y = y0 + Ax−λ).33	 

 	Fig. 6  (left) CPD measurements between the KPFM tip and the surfaces of pristine CsFAMAPbIBr and the different HTM devices (spiro-OMeTAD, TAE-1, TAE-3 and TAE-4). The corresponding WF values obtained from the parabolic fit of the data (see ESI†) are given in the schematics (right) of the proposed energy diagram. The corresponding vacuum level (VL) shifts are obtained from the WF values.
