    , Accepted 26th April 2018First published on 26th April 2018AbstractInterface engineering is a crucial strategy to improve the performance of the perovskite solar cells. The introduction of excess PbI2 with simple mixing method is widely used, but unfortunately its underlying mechanism is still unclear. The main reason is the lack of direct evidence with precise control of the PbI2 distribution. Herein, a program-controlled pulsed H2O vapor exposure/purge method was developed to evenly generate thin PbI2 layer on the film surface. Based on this method, it was found that different PbI2 locations play a different effects on the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells. In the normal device structure, the performance improvement is owing to the passivation effect, while in the inverted device structure, the energy level alignment plays a more dominant role. The discoveries based on the PbI2 location controllable method are conducive to our new understanding of the traditional PbI2-rich system and thus can be a direction towards highly efficient perovskite solar cells.
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) act as potential candidates to meet future energy requirements and have become pioneering with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 22%.1 One effective approach for PCE improvement is to minimize the energy losses of photo-generated carriers transported through the active layer,2–9 buffer layer and electrodes. For a given perovskite active material, the conventional view is that the precise stoichiometry is of great concern to reduce the vacancy defect states. However, it is notable that an appropriate PbI2-rich perovskite film has proved to be beneficial for high performance PSCs with improved open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).10–20
The first set of evidences for the beneficial effects of the excess PbI2 phase are the unreacted PbI2 remnants in the sequential deposition method and the thermally decomposed PbI2 from pure phase perovskite film.13,15 The sequentially deposited PbI2 is, to a great extent, found close to the back contact TiO2,11 while the thermally decomposed PbI2 was found to be distributed at both the top and back contacts, as well as grain boundaries.15 The one-step mixing method, with excess PbI2 in the precursor solution, provides precise control on the stoichiometry and provides more substantial evidence on the positive effects of the PbI2 phase.10 However, the detailed mechanism is still unclear and the reason arising from PbI2 itself or its secondary effect remains to be further confirmed. Despite the lack of direct support from the experimental results, several hypotheses have already been put forward. One hypothesis is the passivation effect on the grain boundaries.21–24 The grain boundaries are relatively sensitive to overall composition variety, and the excess PbI2 penetrated among grain boundaries could reduce the intra band gap state, which serve as possible recombination centers. Another hypothesis is the energy-level alignment with the electron transporting layer (ETL) TiO2.10,15,25,26 The PbI2 phase between the perovskite and TiO2 could facilitate the electron injection and also block the reverse recombination. The third hypothesis is that PbI2 is not beneficial by itself, but induces the increase in grain size10,19 and the enhancement of crystallinity.17,27 The essential reason of the abovementioned observation lies in the uncontrollable distribution of the PbI2 phase in the film and the corresponding experimental results are not sufficient to reach a plausible conclusion. Therefore, the accurate control of PbI2 distribution in the perovskite film is extremely important for understanding the mechanism and further enhancing the performance of PSCs.
Herein, a pulsed surface decomposition method was developed to construct the perovskite film covered with a thin PbI2 layer. The program-controlled pulsed exposure to H2O vapor and purge process can effectively restrict the long-range penetration of H2O molecules into the perovskite film and therefore, only the surface atomic layer can be decomposed. The amount of excess PbI2 can be easily manipulated by adjusting the cycle numbers. Based on such technology, both the normal and inverted perovskite solar cells were fabricated with improved performance. It is noteworthy that Voc significantly increased in the inverted device, while for the normal structure, the FF value improved. The different PbI2 locations have different effects on the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells, providing us with more direct evidence to understand the excess PbI2 related interface engineering. We believe that the direct evidence obtained in this study is a big step forward and it will be a valuable guideline on how to further reduce the interface energy loss in the PSCs.
The post pulsed-exposure to H2O environment process was carried out using atomic layer deposition equipment (ALD, D100-4882, China) equipped with a gas-flow system. In this experiment, the deionized H2O source was employed to provide H2O vapor. High-purity nitrogen (N2, 99.999%) was used as both the carrier gas and purge gas. A steady flow of N2 at a rate of 50 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute) was set in the ALD cycling process. After placing the pre-prepared perovskite films into the ALD reactor, H2O vapor was pulsed into the chamber by N2 carrier gas for 8 s, followed by purging of N2 gas for 25 s to finish one cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). During the treatment, the chamber temperature was maintained at 100 °C and the H2O source was maintained at room temperature. With this program-controlled pulsed H2O vapor exposure/purge (PHEP) process, the non-reacted H2O molecules and the produced volatile organic components were quickly purged away before proceeding to the next cycle. It is proposed that the decomposition of perovskite films is limited only at the surface, rather than infiltrating into the films interior to cause non-uniform decomposition.28,29

Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films before and after the 10-cycle PHEP process. The SEM images after 20-cycle and 40-cycle PHEP treatment are shown in Fig. S1.† After the 10-cycle PHEP treatment, the grain size is almost the same as that of the origin sample. The main change is that the surface morphology evolved from smooth to step-like, indicating the formation of PbI2. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image shown in Fig. S2† indicates that such PHEP treatment has no visible effect on the grain boundaries. Once the PHEP treatment exceeds 20 cycles, the initial grain morphology cannot be identified, and is replaced by a homogenous step-like cross-linked structure (Fig. S1†). Such a surface decomposition process is very different from the reported post-treating methods in a constant-humidity environment that is normally associated with grain size evolution.19
To investigate the dependence of the decomposition degree on the PHEP cycles, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on the perovskite films treated with 0, 10, 20, and 40 PHEP cycles, as shown in Fig. 2(a). An increase in intensity of PbI2 peaks along with the increase in cycle number indicates the continuous generation of PbI2. Fig. 2(b) illustrates the change in the XRD intensities of (110) peak of MAPbI3 and (001) peak of PbI2 after different PHEP cycles. In the initial stage, there is a linear relationship between PbI2 (001) peak intensity and PHEP cycle number. The decomposition rate under increased cycles (40) significantly increases. During the PHEP cycles, the intensity of the MAPbI3 (001) peak gradually decreases with the progressive decomposition of the perovskite phase.

As proposed above, the novelty of the PHEP method is to produce thin PbI2 layer only on the surface of the perovskite film. In order to prove this, Raman spectroscopy using a 532 nm wavelength laser was carried out on the films before and after PHEP treatment as, shown in Fig. 2(c). In this study, unless otherwise specified, MAPbI3/PbI2 represents the film treated with 10-cycle PHEP process, which is an optimized process, and it will be used for the subsequent characterization. The observed peaks at 73, 95, 111, and 167 cm−1 are ascribed to PbI2, which is in good agreement with the previous report.30 In contrast, when we peeled off the top layer of the MAPbI3/PbI2 film to expose the interior part, the corresponding Raman spectrum indicates that there is no PbI2 formed. The signal inside the film also coincides with that of the untreated film surface as shown in Fig. 2(c). Thus, it can be evidenced that the in situ decomposed PbI2via the program-controlled PHEP method indeed exists only on the surface of the as-fabricated perovskite films.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption, steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved PL traces of the perovskite films before and after 10-cycle PHEP treatment. For comparison, the reference PbI2-rich MAPbI3 film (named as MAPbI3-exPbI2), prepared by the one-step solution method with excess PbI2 in the precursor solution, was also measured, as shown in Fig. S3–S5.† As presented in Fig. 3(a), the slight reduction in the absorption intensity is due to the decomposition of the perovskite phase. The absorption enhancement at around 460 nm is attributed to the formation of the PbI2 phase. It is also evident that the PL intensity of the MAPbI3/PbI2 film (Fig. 3(a)) is much lower than that of the MAPbI3-exPbI2 film (Fig. S4†), which indicates that the passivation behavior of the capping thin PbI2 layer is not as efficient as the PbI2 distributed in the entire film.

Another observation is the abnormal reduction of the PL lifetime of the film after PHEP treatment, as shown in Fig. 3(b), with τave reduced from 11.0 ns to 2.6 ns. The same PHEP treatment was also implemented on the traditional MAPbI3-exPbI2 film and its results are presented in Fig. S5.† The untreated MAPbI3-exPbI2 film exhibits longer PL lifetime than the pure MAPbI3 film, which is in agreement with the reported results.10,11 Similarly, the PL lifetime τave after PHEP treatment also reduces significantly from 12.5 ns to 4.2 ns. The PHEP treatment of the perovskite films could induce some “quenching” phenomenon, whose mechanism still needs further exploration. However, we can determined the distribution of PbI2 phase in the perovskite film, which is extremely important for its photoelectric properties.
In literature, PbI2 has been reported more often as a passivator.14–16,18,31 Hence, we also analyzed the passivation effect of PbI2 through the defect state density. The defect density of the perovskite films was obtained according to the space-charge limited current (SCLC) theory.25,32 Current–voltage (J–V) curves of electron-/hole-only devices were measured in the dark as illustrated in Fig. 4(a) and (b). In the electron-only devices, the trap density in MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/PbI2 are calculated to be 1.06 × 1016 cm−3 and 6.28 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. In the hole-only devices, the calculated hole trap density in MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/PbI2 are 1.23 × 1016 cm−3 and 8.76 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The reduction of both the electron and hole defect density indicates that the PbI2 capping layer indeed functions as a passivator, but it is not as efficient as the PbI2 layer in the traditional MAPbI3-exPbI2 perovskite film with the electron and hole trap densities of 5.04 × 1015 cm−3 and 6.10 × 1015 cm−3, respectively (Fig. S6†).

Based on the MAPbI3/PbI2 and pure MAPbI3 films, both the normal and inverted perovskite solar cells were fabricated. The device performances are presented in Fig. 5(a)–(d) and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) results of the typical normal and inverted MAPbI3/PbI2 solar cells are shown in Fig. S7.† In the normal structured solar cells with PbI2 lying between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer in spiro-OMeTAD, the PCE is improved from 19.47% to 20.38% in the FTO/SnOx/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au solar cells (Fig. 5(a)). The short circuit current density (Jsc) and Voc show no significant change compared to those of the reference MAPbI3 device. The main improvement is in the FF value, which increased from 0.75 to 0.78.

In the inverted devices, the PbI2 layer, located between perovskite and ETL, enables the PCE of the solar cells to increase from 17.27% to 18.76%. The main improvement is attributed to the improved Voc, enhanced from 1.05 V to 1.13 V (Fig. 5(c), Table 1). It is worth noting that 10-cycle PHEP is the optimized condition for the device performance (Fig. S8†) and 1.13 V is the highest value for the inverted solar cells based on the same device structure and perovskite material (Table S1†). According to the reported results, PCBM based inverted solar cells normally have reduced hysteresis and this reason has been considered for its passivating effect on removing the trap states at the grain boundaries and mitigating anomalous hysteresis effect.33 It is interesting to note that after the PHEP treatment, the output performance is still very stable (Fig. S9†) and the hysteresis is negligible with the h-index of only 1.1%. Moreover, with the introduced PbI2 capping layer, the long-term stability of the devices is also highly improved due to the restraint of the ion migration12 as compared to that in other devices (Fig. S10†).
By comparing the performances of MAPbI3, MAPbI3/PbI2 and MAPbI3-exPbI2 solar cells (Fig. 5, S11 and S12†), we can conclude that the role of PbI2 capping layer may only be to passivate the interface defects and decrease the defect density at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Differently, the striking improvement in the Voc in the inverted devices, besides the passivation effect, may mainly be attributed to the modified energy-level structure, which corresponds to the quenching behavior illustrated in the Fig. 3(b). It is also confirmed that the PbI2 interlayer could facilitate the electron injection to PCBM, which is reported for the first time, since the MAPbI3-exPbI2 films were mainly employed in the TiO2-based normal devices reported previously. Such a mechanism could be well understood by the corresponding energy level structure, as shown in the inset in Fig. 5(b) and (d).
Due to the drastic effect of the PHEP treatment on the Voc of the inverted solar cells, the corresponding transient photovoltage (TPV, Fig. 5(e)) and the light intensity dependence of Voc (Fig. 5(f)) were measured to estimate the recombination kinetics. Calculated from the voltage decay curves, the device after the PHEP process showed longer lifetime (τ1 = 29.3 μs, τ2 = 167.7 μs) than that of the reference cell (τ1 = 25.3 μs, τ2 = 131.6 μs). Fig. 5(f) shows the variation of Voc as a function of the illumination intensity. The light intensity dependence of Voc was studied according to the following relation:  where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, J0 is the reverse saturation current density, and n is the ideality factor, which is an indicator of the dominant recombination mechanism occurring within a working device.34 The values of the ideality factor n are determined to be 1.66 for the control and 1.39 for the device with the thin PbI2 layer. The lower n value of the device with the introduction of the thin PbI2 suggests lower monomolecular recombination.34 According to the above equation, the value of J0 for the PHEP post-treated device is calculated to be 5.67 × 10−13 mA cm−2, which is three orders of magnitude lower than that of the control device (6.17 × 10−10 mA cm−2). Hence, the improved Voc for the device with the thin PbI2 layer can be explained by the smaller reverse saturation current density J0 due to the optimized energy level alignment (inset in Fig. 5(d)), which is a direct outcome of the enhanced electron selection effect of this thin PbI2 layer.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we innovatively report herein a pulsed surface decomposition method to construct the MAPbI3/PbI2 bi-layer structure. The precise control of the PbI2 location and the comparison of its effect on both the normal and inverted solar cells have been proved and analyzed. In the normal structure, the performance improvement is owing to the passivation effect of the PbI2, with the efficiency improved from 19.47% to 20.38%. More meaningfully, in the inverted device structure, the energy level alignment plays a more dominant role in facilitating the electron injection and also blocking reverse recombination, thus boosting Voc from 1.05 V to 1.13 V, which is the highest value for the inverted MAPbI3/PCBM solar cells. This discovery is conducive to our in-depth understanding of the PbI2-rich system and thus would considerably be a suitable method to further reduce the interface energy loss in the perovskite solar cells.
