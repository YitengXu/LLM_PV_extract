All-small-molecule planar-heterojunction organic solar cells show promising power conversion efficiencies and impressive fill factor (>73%) correlated with the high hole-mobility induced by the BPA moiety.
Introduction
Triarylamine derivatives (TAAs) represent a major class of building blocks for the synthesis of hole-transporting materials (HTMs) used in various optoelectronic applications such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1 organic2 and hybrid3 solar cells or even in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).4–7 During the past decade, the chemistry of active materials embedded in organic solar cells (OSCs) has aroused increasing interest, particularly for the preparation of molecular electron-donor materials since they present several advantages compared to macromolecular systems.4,8–10 Among others, a better reproducibility of the synthesis, purification and properties, a more reliable analysis of the structure–properties relationships and, usually, lower synthetic complexity indexes stand out.
In this context, taking advantage of the strong electron-donating properties and high hole-mobility of TAA derivatives, active materials based on push–pull compounds have attracted considerable attention in organic photovoltaics (OPVs).2,4,11–13 Thus, in these recent years, various classes of molecular donors that include TAA units have been developed resulting in the preparation of star-shaped architectures,14,15 D–A–D compounds16,17 and simple D–A systems.18–20 As shown in a recent work, when implemented in optimized vacuum-deposited OSCs, small push–pull molecules can lead to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 10%.13 Although these values are still lower than those recorded with polymer-based bulk-heterojunction cells (ca. 18%),6 it should be underlined that these performances are usually obtained with active compounds of considerably simpler chemical structures.4,21
In our continuing interest for active materials based on simple and accessible structures, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the structure–properties relationships induced by subtle modifications on a reference compound comprised of a triphenylamine (TPA) donor block, connected to a dicyanovinyl acceptor unit through a π-conjugating spacer (TPA-T-DCV),18 which structure is illustrated in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Structure of push–pull-based molecular donors studied in the group. 
Over the years, our group has shown that the structural manipulation of the TAA block can exert a considerable impact on the properties of the resulting material with little or no influence on the electronic properties of the molecule. For instance, while the replacement of one phenyl ring of the TPA by a polyether chain leads to the emergence of unusual and unexpected mechano-fluoro-NLO-chromic properties (PE-T-DCV),22 the same substitution by an anthryl (Ant-T-DCV),23 a naphthyl (Na-T-DCV)24 or even a simple methyl group (Me-T-DCV)25 results in a three-, five- and fifty-fold increase of the hole mobility, respectively.
In the context of improving the charge transport properties, the substitution of the outer phenyl rings of TPA by biphenyl (BP) blocks has proven effective for the synthesis of efficient HTMs.26–28 On this basis, we report herein the synthesis, characterization and early evaluation in bilayer OSCs of two push–pull molecular donors, namely BPA-T-DCV and BPA-BT-DCV (Fig. 2), with mono- (T) or bithienyl (BT) π-conjugated spacers respectively in which the TPA is replaced by N,N-bis(4-biphenylyl)aniline (BPA).

Results and discussion
The synthetic route considered herein for the preparation of both target push–pull derivatives, in only two steps, is depicted in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the target compounds, namely BPA-T-DCV and BPA-BT-DCV. 
First, the N,N-bis(4-phenylyl)-N-(4-bromophenyl)amine 1 and its boronic acid pinacol ester analogue 2 were engaged in Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling reactions with (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid 3 and 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde 4 respectively, under mild conditions,29,30 to afford in good yields the corresponding aldehyde derivatives, namely BPA-T-A and BPA-BT-A. Hence, the latter were finally converted into the target compounds by reaction with malononitrile under base-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation conditions. While correct yields were obtained after simple column purification (83% and 70% for BPA-T-A and BPA-BT-A respectively), the latter were significantly impacted by the meticulous additional procedure to reach high purity compounds consisting of an injection in a recycling size-exclusion HPLC followed by a final recrystallization (64% and 30% for BPA-T-A and BPA-BT-A respectively).
Once characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry, the optical properties of BPA-T-DCV and its bithienyl analogue (BPA-BT-DCV) were investigated (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  UV-Vis absorption spectra of BPA-T-DCV (red) and BPA-BT-DCV (green) in dichloromethane (a) and as evaporated thin films on quartz (b). 
Solubilized in dichloromethane (DCM), both compounds show a UV-Vis absorption spectrum exhibiting a first band with a maximum at ca. 350 nm assigned to the π–π* transition of the BPA-connector block, followed by a broad band in the 400–600 nm region attributed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-rich BPA block to the dicyanovinyl (DCV) acceptor moiety. Comparison of both spectra revealed that lengthening the π-conjugating spacer, from one to two thiophenes, induced a bathochromic shift of ca. 8 nm and a broadening of the ICT band of ca. 40 nm. Moreover, this structural extension also induces an increase in the absorbance in the 370–430 nm region reflecting a higher contribution of the oligothiophene segment.
As generally observed for π-conjugated systems, the spectra in thin films present a broadening of the absorption band and a red-shift of the maxima due to intermolecular interactions in the solid state. Compared to solution spectra, the larger red-shift of the absorption maxima observed for BPA-BT-DCV suggests a planarization of the bithiophene spacer due to the molecular packing in the film.
Thereafter, the electrochemical properties of both push–pull molecules have been analyzed by cyclic voltammetry in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6), used as the supporting electrolyte, in DCM (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of BPA-T-DCV (red) and BPA-BT-DCV (green) recorded at a concentration of 0.5 mM in 0.10 M Bu4NPF6/CH2Cl2, 100 mV s−1, Pt working electrode. 
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of BPA-T-DCV shows a one-electron reversible oxidation wave with anodic peak potential (Epa) at +0.56 V corresponding to the formation of a stable radical cation. The CV of its bithienyl counterpart, namely BPA-BT-DCV, exhibits two reversible anodic waves at E1pa = +0.46 V and E2pa = +0.95 V respectively, attributed to the successive formation of a stable radical cation and dication, thus demonstrating the impact of the π-connector on the ionization potential. On the other hand, the latter seems to have a limited effect on the electronic affinity since both CVs show, in the negative region, an irreversible reduction peak with very close Epc, thus underlining a process that predominantly involves the dicyanovinyl group and its vicinal thienyl moiety. Optical and electrochemical data are gathered in Table 1.

To further investigate these differences, and more precisely the impact of the π-connectors on the frontier energy levels, ground-state density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out with Gaussian 09 using Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with the 6-311G* basis set (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  HOMO and LUMO energy levels and their representations for BPA-T-DCV (left) and BPA-BT-DCV (right) after optimization with Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-311G* level of theory. 
Hence, optimized geometries and computed electronic structures at the observed minima revealed that the HOMO levels are distributed all over the backbone with a major density found on the electron-rich blocks (BPA-connector) while the LUMO levels are mostly localized on the π-spacer-dicyanovinyl moieties. In addition, calculations showed that lengthening the π-conjugated thienyl connector reduced the overlapping of the two frontier orbitals resulting in a narrower gap, in accordance with the optical and electrochemical data.
Prior to investigating the photovoltaic performances of these two new molecular donors, evaporation tests under high vacuum (10−6 mbar) were first carried out. As expected, BPA-T-DCV showed a lower evaporation temperature than its lengthened counterpart BPA-BT-DCV, of ca. 155 °C vs. 255 °C respectively, as well as a significantly lower percentage of residue found in the crucible after evaporation (3% vs. 13% of the mass respectively). Both push–pull derivatives therefore show good evaporability/compatibility with vacuum processing and can be used for the preparation of all-vacuum-processed planar-heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells. Consequently, their photovoltaic properties were investigated via a collaborative effort with the German company Heliatek GmbH through the fabrication and characterization of devices whose architecture is depicted in Fig. 6. In the latter, 9,9-bis[N,N-(bis-biphenyl-4-yl-amino)phenyl]-9H-fluorene (BPAPF) acts as a wide-gap hole transport layer, with a suitable deep HOMO level while the commercial NDP9 is used as a p-dopant (Novaled GmbH). Absorption is maximized in the active layers by using a thick p-doped HTL (45 nm). Doping of this layer ensures a low series resistance, while the neat dopant layer improves the contact.

BPAPF: 9,9-bis[N,N-(bis-biphenyl-4-yl-amino)phenyl]-9H-fluorene; NDP9: commercial p-dopant from Novaled AG, Dresden. 
Comparison of the current density–voltage (J–V) curves first revealed high open-circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.98 V and 0.94 V for BPA-T-DCV and BPA-BT-DCV respectively, consistent with the low-lying HOMO levels of both donors, resulting in a large offset with the LUMO level of the fullerene acceptor. In addition, the slight difference in Voc of ca. 40 mV, in favor of BPA-T-DCV, is correlated to its deeper HOMO level and higher absorption onset energy. On the other hand, the broader absorbing properties of the bithienyl derivative (BPA-BT-DCV) likely contribute to the ca. 1 mA cm−2 short-circuit current density (Jsc) difference recorded between the two devices since 4.0 mA cm−2 were measured for BPA-T-DCVvs. 4.9 mA cm−2 for BPA-BT-DCV (Fig. S18, ESI†). Finally, it is noteworthy that impressive fill-factors (FF), above 73% were reached for both molecules (75% and 73% for BPA-T-DCV and BPA-BT-DCV respectively). While it is indeed well established that the use of additional hole transporting layers (BPAPF) and extraction/injection barriers (BPAPF doped with NDP9/NDP9) has a beneficial effect on the FF, such values, amongst the highest reported so far,19,31 have been barely achieved in all-small molecule OSCs.32–36 and contribute to the interesting power conversion efficiencies of 3.0 and 3.3% obtained with BPA-T-DCV and BPA-BT-DCV respectively in spite of relatively modest Jsc values. Consequently, to gain further insight, the charge transport properties of both push–pull derivatives were evaluated through the use of the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method on hole only devices of architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BPA-T-DCV or BPA-BT-DCV/Au. From the recorded J–V characteristics, plotted in Fig. 7, hole mobilities of ca. 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were measured for both push–pull derivatives. Interestingly these values are two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured for the reference compound TPA-T-DCV, highlighting the interest of using π-extended TAA blocks for improving hole transport.

These values, amongst the highest reported for such arylamine based push–pull derivatives,25,37,38 revealed a better balanced charge carrier mobility with C60 that might contribute to the impressive fill-factors measured in the corresponding OSCs.
Conclusion
Two push–pull derivatives based on the N,N-bis(4-biphenylyl)aniline donor connected to a DCV acceptor by mono- and bithienyl π-conjugated spacers have been synthesized in two steps from commercially available materials. Optical and electrochemical data show that the extension of the spacer leads to a moderate decrease of the oxidation potential and to a small bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum.
The characterization of PHJ cells fabricated by thermal evaporation has revealed very high FF values consistent with the high hole mobilities measured for the donor materials. These preliminary results thus provide a strong incitement to continue to investigate structure–properties relationships on active OPV materials derived from small TAA-based molecules.

Device fabrication
Thin films and planar-heterojunction solar cell devices were prepared by thermal vapour deposition onto room temperature substrates in an ultra-high vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10−7 mbar. Thin films for absorption and emission measurements were prepared on quartz substrates; solar cells on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) coated glass (Thin Film Devices, USA, sheet resistance of 30 Ω sq−1). Layer thicknesses were determined during evaporation by using quartz crystal monitors calibrated for the respective material. The thin films prepared for absorption and emission measurements were approximately 30 nm thick. Solar cells were prepared layer by layer without breaking the vacuum as follows: ITO; 6 nm BPA-T-DCV or BPA-BT-DCV; 10 nm BPAPF; 45 nm BPAPF doped with NDP9 (purchased from Novaled AG Germany, 10 wt%); 1 nm NDP9; 100 nm Al.

J–V and EQE measurements were carried out in a solvent-free N2 filled glovebox (O2 and H2O levels <1 ppm). J–V characteristics were measured using a source-measure unit (Keithley SMU 2400) and an AM 1.5G sun simulator (KHS Technical Lighting SC1200). The intensity was monitored with a silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1337), which was calibrated at Fraunhofer ISE. The mismatch between the spectrum of the sun simulator and the solar AM 1.5G spectrum was taken into account for the calculation of current density. Aperture masks (2.76 mm2) were used to obtain well-defined active solar cell areas.
SCLC measurements
Hole mobilities have been determined by the space-charge current limited method using the Mott–Gurney law on hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor/gold using spun-cast films of donors BPA-T-DCV and BPA-BT-DCV of 120–150 nm thickness.
Computational methods
The gas-phase ground-state equilibrium geometry of representative molecules was obtained by performing DFT optimization at energy functional B3LYP using the 6-311G(d) split-valence Pople's basis set for all the atomic species. Polarizable continuum model (PCM) was resorted to take into account the electrostatic effects of the polarizable environment using a dielectric constant. Ultimately, as for the optical properties, TD-DFT calculations were carried out. All DFT and TD-DFT simulations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package suite.
