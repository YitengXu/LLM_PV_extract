    , Accepted 20th November 2014First published on 27th November 2014AbstractLithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) is one of the most suitable cathode materials for widespread large-scale applications of lithium ion batteries due to its advantages of high thermal stability, guaranteed safety, low cost, environmental friendliness, relatively good power density and acceptable energy density. However, LiMn2O4-based batteries with LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes always suffer from severe capacity deterioration and poor thermostability, especially at elevated temperatures. Hence, it is necessary to systematically and comprehensively summarize the progress in understanding and modifying LiMn2O4-based batteries from various aspects. In this review, different reported possible fading mechanisms of LiMn2O4-based batteries are first discussed in detail. Then, the various proposed strategies to improve the cyclability and thermostability of LiMn2O4-based batteries at elevated temperatures, including electrolyte optimization, element doping, surface coating, development of functional separators/gel electrolytes and binders, control of special morphologies etc., are covered. Finally, several perspectives are summarized based on the elaborated progress and our own experimental evaluations, aiming to provide some possible attractive strategies and research directions for future upgrading of LiMn2O4-based batteries with improved high temperature performances.
1. Introduction
To overcome the growing global energy shortage while preserving the environment, it is necessary to drastically reduce the world's dependence on non-renewable energy sources. Great efforts should be made to efficiently convert, store, transport and access renewable energy, such as wind, solar, and tidal power. Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are considered one of the most attractive energy storage systems due to their high energy density and relatively simple reaction mechanism.1–5 Nowadays, rechargeable LIBs have been widely applied in various fields, from small consumer electronics, such as E-cigarettes, cell phones, digital cameras and laptop computers, to stationary energy storage systems and transportation tools including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicles (EVs).
Generally, choosing cathode materials in terms of energy density, power density, cycle life, safety and cost is one of the core issues in the development of lithium ion technology for large-scale applications. The characteristics of various mainstream cathode materials for LIBs in the present market are summarized in Table 1.1,5 Obviously, lithium manganese oxide with a spinel structure (LiMn2O4 spinel) and lithium iron phosphate with an olivine structure (LiFePO4 olivine) are competitive cathode materials for widespread large-scale applications of lithium ion batteries due to their advantages of high thermal stability, guaranteed safety, low cost, environmental friendliness, relatively good power density and acceptable energy density, however, the cyclability and thermostability of both LiMn2O4-based and LiFePO4-based batteries at elevated temperatures should be enhanced.1 In this review, we mainly focus on various strategies for improving the cyclability and thermostability of LiMn2O4-based batteries at elevated temperatures. The capacity deterioration and poor thermostability of LiMn2O4-based batteries with LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes at elevated temperatures has been ascribed to the synergistic effect of the following possible mechanisms:1,6–14 (1) the thermal decomposition of LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes, (2) manganese dissolution via the disproportion reaction of 2Mn3+ → Mn2+ + Mn4+ on the electrode surface, (3) irreversible crystal phase transition due to Jahn–Teller distortion in the discharged state, and (4) oxygen deficiency.

It is well known that large amounts of hydrofluoric acid (HF) are produced at elevated temperatures due to the thermal decomposition of LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes initiated by trace impurities of water (Fig. 1).1,11,14 Therefore, HF-containing acidic electrolytes can partially erode the LiMn2O4 electrode at different states of charge (SOC) according to the following reactions:12 2LiMn2O4(s) + 4H+(aq.) → 3MnO2(s) + Mn2+(aq.) + 2Li+(aq.) + 2H2O(aq.)(1) 2Li1−xMn2O4(s) + 4H+(aq.) → 3MnO2(s) + Mn2+(aq.) + 2(1 − x)Li+(aq.) + 2H2O(aq.)(2) 2Li1+xMn2−xO4(s) + 4(1 − x)H+(aq.) → (3 + x)MnO2(s) + (1 − 3x)Mn2+(aq.) + 2(1 + x)Li+(aq.) + 2(1 − x)H2O(aq.)(3) 2LiMn2O4(s) + 4H+(aq.) + 4F−(aq.) → 3MnO2(s) + MnF2(s) + 2LiF(s) + 2H2O(aq.)(4)
 Fig. 1  The auto-catalytic thermal decomposition of LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes. 
As a result of the above mentioned HF attack reactions, defective spinels with Mn4+ (such as Li2MnO3 and Li4Mn5O12) inevitably appear, together with the deposition of MnF2, which will increase the resistance on the cathode surface, affecting the diffusion of Li+ into the bulk LiMn2O4 spinel and consequently causing capacity loss during cycling at elevated temperature.1,7,11,13 It is also reported that Mn4+ ions are more apt to be reduced to Mn3+ in charged states at elevated temperatures with the help of PF6−.1 Meanwhile, parts of the dissolved Mn2+ ions diffuse through the electrolyte and can be deposited as MnO or Mn metal on the graphite anode surface, catalyzing the decomposition of organic compounds, destabilizing the SEI (Solid-Electrolyte-Interface) film and resulting in capacity fading.1,11
The cyclability of rechargeable LIBs also greatly depends on the structural integrity of the host materials during charging and discharging processes.8 LiMn2O4 has a cubic spinel structure with space group symmetry Fd3m. Normally, lithium ions are extracted from the 8a tetrahedral sites, and the 8a tetrahedral sites together with 16c octahedral sites form a three-dimensional pathway for lithium diffusion (Fig. 2).1 However, under dynamic and nonequilibrium conditions during discharging, a Mn3+-rich region is generated on the LiMn2O4 spinel surface, inducing a Jahn–Teller distortion. Furthermore, lithium ions are inserted into the empty 16c octahedral sites of LiMn2O4 spinel in the discharged state, resulting in the transition of crystal structure from cubic LiMn2O4 into tetragonal Li2Mn2O4 accompanied by the Jahn–Teller distortion. Unfortunately, the phase transition causes a large and anisotropic volume change in the structure and damages the integrity of the LiMn2O4 spinel framework. Meanwhile, the Jahn–Teller distortion as well as the mismatch between the tetragonal lattice and cubic lattice will completely block the lithium diffusion pathway, causing the capacity deterioration during cycling, especially at elevated temperatures.6,8–10

On the basis of the above mentioned deterioration mechanisms, different strategies for improving the cyclability and thermostability of LiMn2O4-based batteries at elevated temperatures have been proposed in the past decades (Fig. 3), including electrolyte optimization, element doping, surface coating, development of functional separators/gel electrolytes and binders, control of special morphologies etc., which will be discussed in this review.

2. Electrolyte optimization
The auto-catalytic thermal decomposition of LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes is illustrated in Fig. 1. Beside the attacks on the LiMn2O4 spinel surface, the resultant PF5 and HF can deteriorate the stability of the SEI film on the graphite anode surface.15 Therefore, great efforts have been paid to optimize LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes in LiMn2O4-based batteries, such as developing functional electrolyte additives for stabilization of the LiPF6 salt,15–22 elimination of HF and H2O,23–31 modification of the SEI layer on the anode and cathode surface,32–50 and investigating alternatives to LiPF6.36,51–59
2.1. Development of LiPF6 salt stabilizers
In order to improve the thermostability of LiPF6-based electrolytes, it is necessary to weaken the reactivity and acidity of electron-deficient PF5 by addition of a small amount of a weak or mild Lewis base with an electron-rich property. Lewis base additives are capable of stabilizing LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes by forming a weak complex with PF5.15 The investigated LiPF6 thermal stabilizers mainly include tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphite (TTFP), pyridine, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), hexamethoxycyclotriphosphazene (HMOPA), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), etc. (Table 2).15–22 A boron-based anion receptor, TPFPB, has been investigated by X. Sun et al.19 for suppressing the thermal decomposition of a LiPF6-based carbonate electrolyte. Li/LiMn2O4 cells with a commercial electrolyte containing 0.1 M TPFPB additive exhibit better storage performance, much higher capacity retention and cycling efficiency at 55 °C than cells with a commercial electrolyte without the TPFPB additive, which is ascribed to the enhancement of Li+PF6− ion-pair dissociation by the TPFPB additive. It has been reported by W. T. Li et al.20 that, with the addition of 3% DMAc to the standard ternary electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in 1:1:1 EC/DEC/DMC by volume), the formation of surface films and corrosion on the LiMn2O4 spinel after storage at 60 °C are greatly inhibited. Unfortunately, there are still only a few systematic and comprehensive studies about the application of LiPF6 thermal stabilizers in LiMn2O4-based batteries, especially at elevated temperatures. Therefore, more experimental and theoretical investigations on LiPF6-based electrolyte thermal stabilizers are needed for a thorough evaluation of their action mechanism.

2.2. Developments in the removal of HF and H2O
Since HF is the main cause of corrosion of the LiMn2O4 spinel, great efforts have been devoted to select functional additives capable of inhibiting acid generation or scavenging both water and acids. K. Takechi et al.23 use carbodiimide-based compounds, such as N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, to prevent acid generation by reacting with water. A series of “N–Si”-based additives have also been reported (Fig. 4), including N,N′-diethyl-amino trimethyl-silane (DEATMS),24 hexa-methyldisilazane (HMDS),24,25 and heptamethyl-disilazane (HEMDS).26–30 H. Yamane et al.25 investigated HMDS as a bifunctional additive for both removing H2O and neutralizing HF. The addition of 500–1000 ppm HMDS to the LiPF6-based carbonate electrolyte gave rise to less capacity fading of the Li1.01Mn1.99O4 cathode after high temperature storage and resulted in a drastic decrease of Mn dissolution even at the elevated temperature of 80 °C. The application of HEMDS-containing LiPF6-based carbonate electrolyte in LiMn2O4/graphite full cells was initially proposed by Y. K. Li et al.,26 where the HEMDS showed great stability and could not be reduced or oxidized on the electrode surface. With the addition of 0.1 wt% HEMDS to the electrolyte, the HF content in the electrolyte after room temperature storage for a week was greatly alleviated due to the stable salt compound formed by the reaction between HEMDS and HF (Fig. 4), and the cycling performance of the LiMn2O4/graphite batteries could be moderately improved at room temperature. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of LiMn2O4/graphite batteries could be improved after storage at 60 °C for 7 days. It was also demonstrated by X. W. Wu et al.28 that the conductivity of the electrolyte is not affected by the addition of 2 vol% HEMDS. Subsequently, the authors evaluated the cycling performance of the LiMn2O4/Li cells with different concentrations of HEMDS in LiPF6-based carbonate electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in 1:1:1 EC/DMC/EMC by volume) at the elevated temperature of 60 °C. The capacity retention at 1 C rate after 100 cycles was 87.7% and 93% for 6 vol% and 2 vol% HEMDS containing electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, by adding 3 vol% HEMDS into the LiPF6-based carbonate electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in 1:1:1 EC/PC/EMC by volume), an improved thermostability of LiMn2O4/Li cells was also observed.29 The LiMn2O4/Li cells with HEMDS containing electrolyte after 60 °C storage for a week showed better discharge performance and cyclability at 30 °C than those with no HEMDS in the electrolyte. Based on the XRD analysis of LiMn2O4 electrode after storage at 60 °C for a week, it is reasonably inferred that the addition of HEMDS stabilizes the spinel structure and preserves the crystallinity of the spinel.
 Fig. 4  Reactions for removing H2O and HF by “N–Si”-based compounds.24,25,28 
Theoretical calculations by Z. Zhang et al.31 prove that both H2O and HF can possibly be stabilized by ethanolamine (MEA) through N⋯H–F(O) and F(O)⋯H–N bonds. X. W. Wu et al.27,30 suggest that the high temperature storage performance of LiMn2O4 can be improved by the combined addition of MEA and HEMDS to TC commercial electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in 1:1:1 EC/DMC/EMC by volume). It has been experimentally confirmed that Mn dissolution is suppressed and the contents of λ-MnO2 and LiF on the LiMn2O4 surface are decreased by adding 1 vol% MEA and 3 vol% HEMDS.30 As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the diffraction peaks of LiMn2O4 stored in TC commercial electrolyte shift to higher angles, and the peak intensity is depressed after storage, which can be clearly seen from the magnified (400) peak. At the same time, the cell parameter decreases from 8.2161 to 8.2119, indicating the shrinkage of the crystal lattice due to the erosion of the TC commercial electrolyte. Conversely, the crystal properties of LiMn2O4 after storing in 1 vol% MEA + 3 vol% HEMDS containing TC commercial electrolyte remain almost the same as those of the material that has not been stored in the electrolyte. These results clearly confirm that the addition of MEA and HEMDS into TC commercial electrolyte can stabilize the spinel structure and preserve the crystallinity of LiMn2O4 during storage at elevated temperatures. The development of HF and H2O removing additives is regarded as the remedy to undesirable HF and H2O generation at elevated temperatures, which inevitably causes some deleterious side effects. Future detailed clarification of the close interactions between HF/H2O with newly developed HF/H2O removers, electrolytes, and the entire battery system at elevated temperatures may greatly facilitate not only the evolution of LiMn2O4-based batteries, but also LIBs.

2.3. Development of SEI forming additives

2.3.1. The selection principles of SEI forming additives. 
SEI films deposited on the surface of electrode materials are derived from the chemical and electrochemical decomposition of electrolytes including the organic carbonate solvents and lithium salts. The performances of rechargeable LIBs are greatly affected by the quality of SEI films, which originates from the fact that the transport behavior of Li+ ions across the interface between electrode materials and electrolytes is largely dependent on the properties of the SEI film in terms of Li+ ion conductivity, transfer number, stability against electrolytes, etc.32,33 Consequently, SEI forming or modifying additives are widely used for the enhancement of rechargeable LIBs' performances.15 For the selection of additives, molecular orbital (MO) calculations are used as a first screening method. It has been proved that the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy corresponds to the potential of reductive decomposition and the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy correlates to the potential of oxidative decomposition.32,34 In other words, additives with a lower LUMO energy than those of the other solvents will be reduced first on the anode surface to form or modify the SEI passivation film, while additives with higher HOMO energy will be oxidized on the cathode surface prior to other solvents to form or modify the SEI passivation film.34,35 Hence, in the light of MO calculations, a variety of new SEI forming additives may appear and be evaluated in the near future.


2.3.2. Anode SEI forming additives. 
At elevated temperatures, compared with the cyclability of LiMn2O4/Li or LiMn2O4/Li4Ti5O12 cells, an obvious decay in capacity is always observed in LiMn2O4/graphite cells.6,36 Thus, the SEI layer deposited on the surface of carbonaceous negative electrodes, together with dissolved Mn2+ in the electrolyte, plays an important role in the high temperature capacity fading of LiMn2O4-based full batteries, and several different failure mechanisms have been proposed.6,36–43 It was reported by H. Tsunekawa et al.37 that higher storage temperatures and longer storage periods give larger capacity deterioration and increased Mn deposition on the graphite electrode. Subsequently, it was declared that the capacity losses appear to be closely related to the amount of deposited Mn in the storage process, but definite evidence that Mn deposition is the direct cause of capacity fading has not been found. Furthermore, it has been concluded that the Mn deposition on the graphite electrode accelerates the formation of inactive materials, such as LiF. T. Tsujikwa et al.40 investigated the deterioration mechanism of float-charged LiMn2O4/graphite cells at 50 °C and they discovered that the capacity fading originated not only from the reduction of mobile lithium ions caused by Mn deposition during charging, but also side reactions related to the deposited Mn that accompany the loss of electric charge at the graphite anode. Also, it has been shown that the capacity deterioration of graphite/Li half cells is greater than that of the LiMn2O4/Li half cells at 50 °C. Recently, through model experiments, C. Delacourt et al.41 shed light on the effect of Mn contamination on the passivating properties of the SEI at the anode of full cells in LiClO4-based carbonate electrolytes (Fig. 6). It was demonstrated that the deposited Mn trapped at the anode undergoes a multiphase conversion reaction with severe structural changes between the oxidized and reduced states: MnCO3 + 2Li+ +2e− → LiCO3 + Mn0(5)
 Fig. 6  Schematics of the mechanisms proposed for SEI growth on a copper electrode (a) during formation in a Mn-free electrolyte (b) during formation in a Mn-contaminated electrolyte, and (c) during cycling of a Mn-contaminated SEI in a Mn-free electrolyte. “S” stands for a solvent molecule. Reproduced from ref. 41 by permission of ECS-The Electrochemical Society. 
As a consequence, the SEI film suffers from morphological changes during cycling, which create cracks and pores that favour electrolyte decomposition and subsequent film growth. Mn contamination of the SEI layer therefore promotes a larger reversible lithium loss at the anode as compared to a Mn-free SEI, which leads to a larger capacity loss of the LiMn2O4/graphite cell, especially at elevated temperatures. On the contrary, in LiMn2O4/MCMB cells with LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes, it has been definitely confirmed by XANES and XPS technology that there are no MnF2 and MnCO3 in the anode’s SEI film.42 It was also suggested that a metathesis reaction between Mn(II) and some species (e.g. ROCO2Li) on the anode SEI film takes place during the deposition of Mn(II) on the anode, rather than a reduction reaction that leads to the formation of metallic Mn. Furthermore, the concentration of Mn deposited on the anode gradually increases with cycling, which correlates well with the rising impedance of anodes and capacity fading of the full cells. Very recently, through HRTEM and XPS characterization, it was clarified by X. C. Xiao et al.43 that Mn is reduced to metallic particles on the graphite electrode surface, resulting in a thick SEI formation (Fig. 7) that is responsible for the increased cell polarization and capacity deterioration.

Metallic α-Mn (in red) is the first layer deposited on the surface of the graphite anode, followed by the SEI containing nanocrystalline LiF, and the top-most layer containing LiF and MnF2. Adapted from ref. 43 by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
In order to improve the performance of rechargeable LIBs, various organic/inorganic additives for modifying or protecting the SEI film on the surface of carbonaceous negative electrodes have been developed.15,32,33,44 With the aim of suppressing the performance deterioration of the graphite anode of LiMn2O4/graphite cells, various additives have been evaluated for modifying or protecting the SEI film against the dissolved Mn(II) at elevated temperatures. For LiMn2O4/graphite cells in LiClO4-based electrolytes, it was confirmed that the anode SEI modified by 2-vinylpyridine (VP) can effectively suppress the electro-reduction of the dissolved Mn(II) on the graphite electrode, resulting in enhanced battery performances, especially at elevated temperatures.45 It has been declared by M. Ochida et al.39 that even superior SEI films modified by vinylene carbonate (VC), vinylethylene carbonate (VEC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) cannot suppress the penetration of Mn-ions and the subsequent deposition of Mn on the edge planes of graphite. Recent studies by M. Ochida et al.46 show that the addition of a certain type of cyclic ether, such as 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (C222), can interact strongly with dissolved Mn(II) in the electrolyte, consequently effectively suppressing the significant decrease in redox currents due to the intercalation and de-intercalation reactions of Li+ at edge planes of the graphite electrode, and remarkably decrease the interfacial resistance consisting of surface film resistance and charge transfer resistance. With 2 wt% FEC addition into the LiPF6-based electrolyte, the capacity retention of LiMn2O4/graphite cells at 60 °C after 130 cycles is significantly improved by about 20%, which mainly originates from the thin and stable graphite SEI layer that resists Mn2+ attack.47 Obviously, the development of a stable and Mn2+/HF resistant anode SEI layer by effective additives is the main challenge here.


2.3.3. Bifunctional additives for both cathode and anode SEI formation. 
Based on molecular orbital (MO) calculations, several typical bifunctional additives with lower LUMO energy and higher HOMO energy have been investigated in LiMn2O4-based batteries (Table 3). D. Aurbach et al.48 described that VC can act as a bifunctional additive in LiMn2O4/graphite cells. On the one hand, by forming passive polymeric surface species on the graphite surface during the course of VC reduction, the cycling behavior of the anode can be improved at elevated temperatures. On the other hand, the formation of polyvinyl carbonate species on the cathode’s surface can suppress acid-based reactions between LiMn2O4 spinel and trace HF. Recently, B. Li et al.49 determined that the HOMO and LUMO energies of VC are −7.3718 eV and −0.5627 eV, respectively. At the same time, a novel bifunctional electrolyte, prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone (PES), with higher HOMO (−8.2075 eV) and lower LUMO energies (−1.6403 eV) than the main solvents (EC and EMC) was developed, which provides simultaneous protection for both anode and cathode of a LiMn2O4/graphite battery at 60 °C. As expected, the discharge capacity retention of the LiMn2O4/graphite battery using PES was 91% after 150 cycles at 1 C rate at 60 °C, better than that with VC (82%) or in the absence of additives (68%) (Fig. 8a and b). Compared with the VC-modified SEI, the PES-modified sulfur containing SEI is more effective for the inhibition of electrolyte decomposition (lower swell value (Fig. 8b inset) and reduced organic component in the SEI layer (Fig. 8c)) and the suppression of manganese deposition at elevated temperatures after 150 cycles. It was also confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. 8d) that the dissolution of manganese from LiMn2O4 spinel is inhibited by the SEI film modified by VC or PES. 2-(Triphenylphosphoranylidene) succinic anhydride (TPSA) with higher HOMO (−10.1 eV) and lower LUMO energies (−1.32 eV) than the main solvents (EC and DEC) was evaluated as a bifunctional additive by M. H. Ryou et al.35 It was confirmed that TPSA can modify both surfaces of LiMn2O4 spinel and graphite, restricting the severe electrolyte decomposition. As a consequence, the SEI layers derived from TPSA possess lower impedance values and are much thinner than those of a bare electrolyte. Therein, with the addition of 0.1 wt% TPSA into a bare electrolyte, an improved capacity retention (100 cycles, 75.5% retention) was achieved at 1 C rate at 55 °C. Y. B. Liu et al.50 reported that the cyclability of the LiMn2O4 cathode in LiMn2O4/Li half cells at 55 °C can be improved by using 0.5 wt% tris(trimethylsilyl) borate (TMSB) as an electrolyte additive, which was ascribed to lower interfacial impedance (dissolving LiF out of the SEI layer by the coordination of the TMSB-F− compound), and the participation of TMSB in the formation process of the SEI layer on the cathode surface, etc. On the basis of MO calculations, the design and evaluation of bifunctional additives for the effective formation of both anode and cathode SEI layers may play a key role in optimizing LiMn2O4-based batteries.

2.4. Development of new lithium salts
Conventional lithium salts, such as LiPF6 and LiClO4, cannot fully satisfy the requirements of high temperature operation due to their thermal instability. Thus, various new lithium salts, such as LiBOB, LiDFOB, LiFAP, Li2B12F12, LiFNFSI, LiBETI and LiTFSI with some properties superior to LiPF6 have been evaluated for LiMn2O4-based batteries in recent years.36,51–60 LiB(C2O4)2 (LiBOB) has been explored as an alternative lithium salt to LiPF6 in LiMn2O4/graphite batteries,36,51–54 as it possesses much better thermal stability (up to 300 °C) than LiPF6. Also, Mn dissolution in LiBOB-based electrolytes from spinels is extremely low at 55 °C (Fig. 9a and b), indicating that the SEI layer will be better stabilized by reducing the amount of Mn deposition on the anode surface. As a result, the LiMn2O4/graphite batteries using LiBOB-based electrolyte showed superior capacity retention (83%, 100 cycles) at 55 °C compared with those using LiPF6-based electrolyte (Fig. 9c). However, due to its own disadvantages, such as low salt solubility, high interface resistance on the electrode surface, poor thermal compatibility with LiMn2O4 in the electrolyte, LiBOB has always been developed as an electrolyte additive for stabilizing the anode SEI layer rather than as the main lithium salt.52–54 D. T. Shieh et al.53 reported the application of mixed LiBOB and LiPF6 salts in 18650-type LiMn2O4/MCMB cells, and better high temperature cycling performance was obtained with a lower concentration of LiBOB (from 0.8 M to 0.1 M) in the electrolyte. Subsequently, lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) with some superior properties to LiBOB, was investigated as another alternative lithium salt to LiPF6 in LiMn2O4/Li cells by M. H. Fu et al.55 It was demonstrated that the DFOB anion can capture the dissolved manganese in the electrolyte, form a denser and more compact SEI layer on the cathode surface, and consequently, suppress continued Mn2+ dissolution, especially at elevated temperatures. Hence, LiMn2O4/Li cells with LiDFOB-based electrolytes exhibit superior capacity retention (87.5%) than those using LiPF6-based electrolytes (79.2%) after 100 cycles at the 0.5 C rate at 60 °C. Actually, LiDFOB has also been investigated as an additive for both cathode and anode SEI layer modification in full cells without LiMn2O4.61,62 Recently, Li(FSO2)(C4F9SO2)N (LiFNFSI) was investigated as a single electrolyte lithium salt to improve the high temperature cycling and storage performance of LiMn2O4-based batteries.58 It was concluded that LiFNFSI-based electrolytes can prevent the dissolution of Mn2+ ions from LiMn2O4 spinel very effectively, and generate a more stable Li+ conducting SEI film on the electrode surfaces at 60 °C. However, the newly developed lithium salts with some of their own drawbacks cannot fully replace the conventional lithium salts currently. Consequently, much research effort is therefore still needed for the assessment of possible alternative new salts with high thermostability in LIBs, especially for LiMn2O4-based batteries.

Recently, we preliminarily investigated the addition of 1.0 wt% LiDFOB and 1.0 wt% DMAc to commercial electrolyte (CE, mainly composed of EC, EMC, DEC, VC and PES), and subsequently the optimized electrolyte was tested in coin-type full cells (the cathode was composed of 65 wt% LiMn2O4 and 35 wt% LiMn1/3Ni1/3Co1/3O2; the anode was graphite; the separator was polypropylene). Compared with full cells using commercial electrolyte, full cells with the optimized electrolyte showed a slope voltage plateau around 2.2 V in the first charge at 0.05 C rate (Fig. 10a), which can be ascribed to the SEI modification by LiDFOB additive.61,62 Despite the fact that full cells with the optimized electrolyte exhibited lower discharge capacity in the initial cycles compared to cells using commercial electrolyte, full cells with the optimized electrolyte demonstrated superior cyclability at 0.5 C rate at both room temperature (86%, 135 cycles) (Fig. 10b) and 55 °C (72%, 135 cycles) (Fig. 10c). From the analysis of AC impedance after 135 cycles at 0.5 C rate at 55 °C, full cells using optimized electrolyte deliver a relatively lower charge transfer resistance, indicating that a more stable SEI film is formed by the further assistance of both LiDFOB and DMAc to VC and PES. Therefore, it is preliminarily concluded that the synergetic effects generated by the combination of different electrolyte additives can help to enhance the cyclability of LiMn2O4-based full cells at elevated temperatures.

In summary, the electrolyte is one of the main factors for the severe deterioration of LiMn2O4-based batteries at elevated temperatures. Hence, electrolyte optimization is necessary for the enhancements of cyclability and thermostability of LiMn2O4-based batteries at elevated temperatures. Actually, the fundamental instability of electrolytes at elevated temperatures cannot be totally overcome, but it can be greatly alleviated by functional additives and new lithium salts.
3. Element doping
As described in the Introduction, the capacity deterioration of LiMn2O4 spinel is greatly associated with Mn dissolution caused by Mn3+ disproportion reaction and Jahn-Teller distortion, which can be restrained by doping appropriate amounts of ions into the bulk or surface spinel for cation or anion substitution. The investigated doping ions can be divided into two categories, cations and anions. To the best of our knowledge, the cationic doping elements mainly include Al,6,36,63–79 Cr,72,80–85 Co,72,73,84–95 Ga,73,96–102 Gd,92,103 La,104–108 Ce,106,107,109,110 Pr,106 Nd,107,111–113 Sm,107,114,115 Tb,116 Er,117 Sc,118 Y,90,119,120 B,121 Fe,122–124 Mg,125–127 Ni,72,85,128–131 Zn,91,108,109,132–134 Cu,78 Ti,78,125,134–136 Ru,137 Si,102,138 Sn,139 Li,72,79,93,140–144 Na,145etc., while the reported anions mainly consist of F−,6,73,130,146–153 Cl−,144,154 Br−,155–157 S2−,73,158–162 PO32−,133,163etc. Sometimes, single ion doping cannot effectively improve the cyclability of LiMn2O4 spinel, especially at elevated temperatures. Therefore, dual or multiple ion-doped LiMn2O4 spinels have also been developed for enhanced electrochemical performances. In the following sections, we mainly focus on examples of minimally ion-doped LiMn2O4 spinels for the improvement of high temperature cycling performances in half cells (Table 4).

3.1. Cation doping

3.1.1. Trivalent cation doping. 
Among the various trivalent ion doped LiMn2O4 spinels, Al3+-substituted LiMn2O4 is expected to be the most promising cathode material since Al is abundant, nontoxic, less expensive and lighter than other transition metal dopants. Therefore, great efforts have been paid to verify the enhancement of high temperature performances by Al doping on the 16d Mn sites of LiMn2O4 spinel. S. T. Myung et al.63 synthesized a series of LiAlxMn2−xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) powders by calcination of the homogeneous emulsion-dried precursor. It was calculated that the Al–O bonding is much stronger than that of Mn–O, which means that the expansion or contraction of the spinel during insertion or extraction of Li+ may be suppressed by the Al substitution. Unfortunately, the lithium diffusion through the 8a–16c–8a pathway is affected by the limited crystal lattice contraction, although the crystal structure is stabilized by Al doping. As a result, the capacity retention of Al-doped LiMn2O4 spinels (especially LiAl0.3Mn1.7O4) in half cells is better than that of pristine LiMn2O4 spinel at both 25 °C and 45 °C for 50 cycles, despite the specific capacity of Al-doped LiMn2O4 spinels being lower than that of pristine LiMn2O4 spinel (Fig. 11). Y. K. Sun et al.64 investigated the structural degradation mechanism associated with capacity loss of the LiAl0.2Mn1.8O4 electrode at elevated temperatures. They found that the Al-doped LiMn2O4 spinel with smaller lattice parameter (decreased Mn3+ concentration) reduces the dissolution of Mn from the electrode surface and stabilizes the structural integrity. It was clarified that the relatively higher capacity loss (50 cycles, 5%) of Li/LiAl0.2Mn1.8O4 cell at 80 °C is caused by the formation of tetragonal Li2Mn2O4 and rocksalt Li2MnO3 on the surface of the discharged electrode. From the observation of in situ XRD patterns at different SOC, it was concluded by K. Y. Chung et al.65 that the Al-doped spinels show better structural stability against oxygen loss and less distinctive structural changes during cycling at elevated temperatures.

Oxygen deficiency is supposed to be another key factor in controlling the cycle performance of Mn-spinel cathodes, especially at elevated temperatures. There is a great possibility that oxygen deficiency is often present in overheated LiMn2O4 spinels. The “fingerprint” of 3.2 V discharge plateau is suggested to be used as a “qualitative indicator for detecting oxygen deficiency”. It is observed from ex situ XRD patterns by Y. G. Xia et al.68 that Al-doped spinels with stoichiometric oxygen shrink uniformly from 8.17 to 8.06 Å during de-lithiation, which can be regarded as a one-phase reaction, whereas the oxygen deficient spinels exhibit a two-phase reaction. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the capacity retention was inversely linear to the oxygen defect degree δ in Al-doped spinels at 60 °C. When δ was extrapolated to 0, the capacity retention of Al-doped spinels was surprisingly found to achieve about 100% at 60 °C. Consequently, a new kind of oxygen-stoichiometric Li1.039Al0.146Mn1.815O4.017 spinel (average Mn valence 3.613) was prepared by a two-step method, and the capacity retention was about 99.34% at 60 °C in the half-cells after 50 cycles.
Various preparation methods have been developed to enhance high temperature performances of Al-doped LiMn2O4 spinels. T. Kakuda et al.69 synthesized Li1.10Mn1.90Al0.10O4 spinel with decreased specific surface area by a newly developed wet-milling method. And the improved cyclability at 55 °C (99%, 30 cycles) over the conventional dry process can be attributed to the use of finely ground precursors and the crystalline nature of the particles of the spinel products. A series of highly crystalline and structural homogenous LiAlxMn2−xO4 (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.08) spinels with well-developed octahedral morphology, were prepared via the pyrolysis of polyacrylate precursors in situ polymerized by the reaction of metal salts and acrylic acid.70 As expected, the Al-doped LiAlxMn2−xO4 spinels could be well cycled at 55 °C without severe capacity deterioration for 50 cycles. Y. Yang et al.71 synthesized pristine LiMn2O4 and Al-doped LiMn2O4 nanorods by another kind of two-step method combining the hydrothermal synthesis of β-MnO2 nanorods and a solid state reaction to convert β-MnO2 nanorods into spinel nanorods. By both SEM and single-nanorod transport measurements, it was concluded that Al dopants reduce the dissolution of Mn3+ ions significantly and make the LiAl0.1Mn1.9O4 nanorods much more stable than pristine LiMn2O4 against electrolyte etching. Hence, LiAl0.1Mn1.9O4 nanorods can achieve 80% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C rate at 60 °C, whereas LiMn2O4 nanorods show worse capacity retention of 69%. Al-doped single-crystalline LiMn2O4 nanotubes (LAMO-NT) have been synthesized via a template-based reaction using β-MnO2 nanotubes as a sacrificial template.75 After being cycled 200 times at 5 C rate at 55 °C, LAMO-NT electrodes in half cells maintained a capacity retention of about 80%, whereas LMO-NT electrodes showed only 26%. The enhanced cycling performance of LAMO-NT at elevated temperatures can be ascribed to the effect of Al doping. Additionally, from the TEM observation, the tubular structure, single-crystalline nature and high crystallinity of the LAMO-NT were found to be well maintained after aging tests in LiPF6-based electrolyte for 30 days at 55 °C, indicating the superior structural and dimensional stability of LAMO-NT (Fig. 12). J. L. Wang et al.76 prepared a three-dimensional (3D) porous Al-doped spinel (LiAl0.1Mn1.9O4) with small uniform particle morphology by the phase-inversion methodology using PMMA as a template. It has also been declared that the partial substitution of Al3+ ions for Mn3+ ions can reduce the lattice constant and increase the Mn oxidation state in the spinel. Therefore, the 3D porous Al-doped spinel electrodes exhibited an obviously improved cycling stability at 1 C rate at 55 °C compared with the undoped spinel electrodes despite the former having a larger specific surface area. Microsized single-crystal Li1.08Mn1.89Al0.03O4 (LAMO) spinels were synthesized via a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) combustion method.77 Through the analysis of the XRD, SEM, and HRTEM characterizations, it was confirmed that the as-prepared LAMO spinel has good crystallinity, uniform and smooth-surface morphology, and very low specific surface area. Consequently, it was demonstrated that the capacity retention of LAMO after 200 cycles at 1 C rate at 30 °C and 55 °C were 98.8% and 93.3%, respectively.

D. Zhang et al.80 introduced a chemically-modified-CrO2.65 doped spinel (LiCr0.1Mn1.9O4), which exhibits improved cyclability due to the overall stabilization of the octahedral sites by the stronger Cr–O bond and stability of the spinel structure by the decreased volume shrinkage of LiCr0.1Mn1.9O4. Furthermore, LiCr0.1Mn1.9O4 increases the exchange current density and facilitates the charge transfer reaction of the active material. By means of molecular dynamics simulation and EXAFS analysis, M. Kaneko et al.81 investigated the local crystal structure of LiCryMn2−yO4, and demonstrated that the local distortion of the lattice (MO6 octahedra) was suppressed and the M16d–O bond strengthened by substituting Cr3+ ions for Mn3+ ions. Subsequently, the dissolution behavior of LiCrxMn2−xO4 in LiPF6-based electrolyte at various temperatures was studied by H. C. Wang et al.82 The amount of dissolved Mn ions was obviously alleviated with the increased doping amount of Cr-ions in LiCrxMn2−xO4 at both ambient and elevated temperatures, leading to the superior capacity retention of LiCrxMn2−xO4 than that of pristine LiMn2O4. However, the increasing amount of Cr-ion doping in LiCrxMn2−xO4 spinel can also increase the amount of dissolved Cr-ions in the electrolytes.
C. H. Shen et al.86 reported the synthesis of a series of LiMn2−xCoxO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) spinels, wherein the 16d site of the octahedral Mn3+ ion (0.645 Å) has been partially replaced with Co3+ ions (0.545 Å), and the lattice constant together with the cell volume decrease with the addition of Co. Thus, the average Mn valence is increased and the Jahn–Teller distortion is suppressed in Co-doped spinels, resulting in a better capacity retention than undoped spinels. B. V. R. Chowdari et al.87,94,95 focused on the evaluation of LiM1/6Mn11/6O4 (M = Co, CoAl, CoCr, CrAl) spinel phases, and Li(Co1/6Mn11/6)O4 was found to have the best long-term electrochemical cycling stability at high rates at ambient temperature. The Li(Co1/6Mn11/6)O4 spinel also exhibited superior cyclability at 0.5 C at 50 °C (98%, 80 cycles).87 It was reported by X. M. He et al.90 that cobalt doping can restrain the initial specific capacity loss of spinels at 55 °C. Furthermore, Co surface doping was found to be better than Co bulk doping at the same doping level, especially at elevated temperatures, which can be ascribed to the effectively restrained contact of Mn with the electrolyte and the decreased lattice parameter cause by Co surface doping.
By Rietveld refinement fitting of the doped Li1.02Mn1.95Ga0.05O4 spinel, it was concluded that the introduction of Ga3+ ions to the 16d Mn positions can stabilize a network composed of [Mn1.95Ga0.05]O4 octahedra over many cycles of charging and discharging, resulting in enhanced cycling performance.98 D. Capsoni et al.99 proved that Jahn–Teller cooperative distortion in the LiMn2O4 spinel can be inhibited by Ga3+ doping. A series of LiGaxMn2−xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.05) spinels were synthesized by a triethanolamine-assisted sol–gel method,101 wherein LiGa0.05Mn1.95O4 exhibited the best high temperature performance at 0.5 C rate at 55 °C (91%, 50 cycles), which can be attributed to high strength of Ga–O bonding and the suppression of Jahn–Teller distortion.
The doping effects of trivalent lanthanide elements on LiMn2O4 spinel have also been intensively investigated. S. C. Han et al.103 first reported a series of Gd-doped LiMn2O4 spinels (LiGdxMn2−xO4, x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08) prepared by a citric acid-assisted sol–gel method. The unit cell dimension of LiGdxMn2−xO4 decreases with an increase of Gd content, accompanied by the expansion of LiO4 tetrahedra and contraction of MnO6 octahedra (Fig. 13a), finally resulting in an improvement in the high-rate performance and reduced capacity fading, respectively. The stabilized structural integrity of LiGdxMn2−xO4 suppresses the dimensional changes during charge–discharge cycles with no two phase region, also resulting in the reduced capacity fading, particularly at elevated temperatures. It was shown that the severe capacity fading of pristine LiMn2O4 at 1 C rate at 60 °C (45% fading after 70 cycles) was significantly suppressed by Gd-doping, resulting in capacity deteriorations of 21, 17, and 15% for x = 0.02, 0.04, and 0.08, respectively (Fig. 13b). The peak separations (ΔEp) after 70 cycles can also be significantly decreased by Gd doping (Fig. 13b insets). It was then demonstrated that the difference in impedance behavior between LiMn2O4 and LiGd0.02Mn1.98O4 after 70 cycles at 60 °C mainly results from Rct (141 Ω and 73.4 Ω, respectively), in accordance with the ΔEp variations (Fig. 13c). Furthermore, the cell contraction in LiGdxMn2−xO4 after 70 cycles at 60 °C was much smaller and gradually diminished with increasing x (Fig. 13d), confirming the structure-stabilizing effect of Gd again. It has been shown by J. Tu et al.104 that La3+ doping of only 1% can effectively inhibit the destruction of the LiMn2O4 spinel microstructure and thus slow down the increase of charge transfer resistance, resulting in superior capacity retention than pristine LiMn2O4 during cycling. The enhanced structural stability caused by 1% La3+ doping (LiLa0.01Mn1.99O4) can be ascribed to the shrinkage of lattice parameters. H. B. Sun et al.107 investigated a series of light rare-earth element doped LiMn2−xRExO4 (RE = La, Ce, Nd, Sm; 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) spinels synthesized by solid-state phase reaction. Although the ionic radii of a RE is larger than that of Mn (normally leading to a slight increase of the lattice parameter), the bonding energies of RE–O are much stronger than those of Mn3+–O2−, resulting in the reduction of the lattice parameter. The decreased lattice parameters of doped spinels can improve the structural stability, and the doped RE can reduce the charge transfer resistance of the electrodes. Consequently, the cyclability and rate capability of LiMn2−xRExO4 electrodes at both room and elevated temperatures are significantly improved with increasing RE addition, compared to the pristine LiMn2O4 electrode. Phase pure Tb (3+/4+ mixed valence)-doped LiTbxMn2−xO4 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04) spinels have been synthesized via a citric acid-assisted sol–gel method by D. K. Lee et al.116 wherein LiTb0.01Mn1.99O4 showed excellent rate capability with a higher specific capacity and less overpotential, relative to undoped LiMn2O4 spinels. It was disclosed that, while the concerted contraction of a LiO4 tetrahedron and the expansion of neighboring MnO6 octahedra contribute to fast electrochemical kinetics, a decrease in the unit cell dimensions by Tb doping results in the enhanced structural integrity of LiTb0.01Mn1.99O4. The capacity deterioration was obviously alleviated at 1 C rate at both RT and 60 °C (Fig. 14a), which can be directly attributed to the suppression of phase transition to two-cubic phases in the delithiated state and to a tetragonal phase in the over-lithiated state during the charge–discharge process (Fig. 14b).

3.1.2. Divalent and tetravalent cation doping. 
M. Takahashi et al.125 found that Mg2+-doping is more effective at reducing the oxygen deficiency in spinels calcined at 1000 °C, and the oxygen defect content obviously decreased with around a 0.03 Mg2+-doping amount. Annealing at 800 °C after calcination at 1000 °C further reduced the oxygen defect content in the Mg2+-doped spinels, and the crystallinity of the Mg2+-doped spinels could also be improved by doping with a small amount of Ti4+. As a result, the 60 °C storage performance of the Ti4+ and Mg2+-doped spinels was greatly improved by about 1.6 times. A novel concentration-gradient LiMn1.87Ni0.13O4 spinel with a homogeneous LiMn2O4 core and continuously Ni-increasing shell was synthesized and characterized by Q. L. Wei et al. (Fig. 15a).131 They calculated a decreased lattice parameter for the concentration-gradient LiMn1.87Ni0.13O4, possibly resulting in the stabilization of the spinel and the increased concentration of inactive Mn4+ in the outmost shell layer. As illustrated in Fig. 15b, despite the fact that the concentration-gradient LiMn1.87Ni0.13O4 electrode exhibited a slightly lower initial discharge specific capacity (108.2 mA h g−1) than that of the LiMn2O4 electrode (119.7 mA h g−1) at 0.5 C rate at 55 °C, the oxygen deficiency effect was suppressed well in the concentration-gradient LiMn1.87Ni0.13O4 (without the “fingerprint” 3.2 V discharge plateau).68 As expected, the concentration-gradient LiMn1.87Ni0.13O4 electrode showed obviously improved cycling behavior (90.2%, 200 cycles) compared with the pristine LiMn2O4 electrode (57.8%, 200 cycles) at 0.5 C rate at 55 °C (Fig. 15c). It was also confirmed that the original cubic structure of the concentration-gradient LiMn1.87Ni0.13O4 was maintained over 100 cycles at 0.5 C rate at 55 °C, while LiMn2O4 revealed the coexistence of both original cubic phase and new tetragonal derived phase because of structural degradation (Fig. 15d). Furthermore, EDXS line mapping comparison before and after 100 cycles inferred that concentration-gradient LiMn1.87Ni0.13O4 can effectively inhibit the dissolution of Mn. Sn4+-doped LiMn2O4 spinels were primarily investigated by S. H. Guo et al.,139 and they claimed that the dissolution of Mn in Sn-doped spinels was accelerated because of the increased Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio after Sn4+ doping. However, the crystal structure of Sn-doped spinels was stabilized due to the decrease of the lattice parameter. Hence, the LiSn0.04Mn1.96O4 electrode exhibited enhanced cyclability (86.4%, 50 cycles) than pristine LiMn2O4 electrode (67.8%, 50 cycles) at 55 °C.

3.1.3. Monovalent cation doping. 
The most intensively investigated monovalent doping ion is Li+. M. Saitoh et al.140 reported that the Li-rich Li1.1Mn1.9O4 spinel showed less capacity loss and Mn dissolution in cycling and storage processes at elevated temperatures (Fig. 16). Through the analysis of electron density and IR spectra of the Mn–O bond, it was concluded that Mn–O bonds in Li1.1Mn1.9O4 are stronger than those in pristine LiMn2O4, resulting in the stabilization of the Li1.1Mn1.9O4 spinel with a tightened framework. Additionally, it was pointed out that the capacity loss from the conduction loss of the active spinel to the collector was much larger than that from the deterioration of the active spinel itself. A new oxygen stoichiometric spinel (Li1.094Mn1.906O4.025) with Li-doping and metal vacancies on the 16d sites was investigated by B. H. Deng et al.141 The new spinel exhibited enhanced structural stability, superior capacity retention and less Mn dissolution in both spinel/Li and spinel/MCMB cells at elevated temperatures.

3.1.4. Dual and multi-cation doping. 
Dual and multi-cation doped LiMn2O4 spinels have been developed for enhanced electrochemical performances, especially at elevated temperatures. Doubly doped stoichiometric single-phase LiMn1.99−yLiyM0.01O4 (M = Al3+, Ni2+, Cr3+, Co3+; y = 0.01 and 0.06) spinels have been synthesized by the sucrose-aided combustion method.72 It was proved that the simultaneous increase of particle size and Li-excess had a synergetic effect that improves the cycling performances of spinels at 55 °C. Among the various spinels synthesized, LiMn1.93Li0.06M0.01O4 (M = Al3+, Ni2+) electrodes exhibit superior cyclability (>99.9% per cycle) at 55 °C. M. Prabu et al.79 synthesized (Li, Al)-co-doped spinel, [Li]8a[Li0.10Mn(III)0.60Mn(IV)1.20Al(III)0.10]16dO4, by the polymer precursor method using polyvinyl pyrrolidone as the complexing agent. It was concluded that (Li, Al)-co-doping had synergetic effects (such as improved structural stability, suppressed Jahn–Teller distortion, increased mean Mn valence, etc.) that led to not only larger initial discharge capacities but also much higher capacity retention at 0.5 C rate at 55 °C (92%, 50 cycles). C. Y. Wang et al.93 reported that the Mn dissolution of Li1.05Co0.10Mn1.85O4 spinel at 55 °C could be effectively suppressed due to a lower specific surface area and stabilized crystal structure. As a result, the capacity retention of graphite/doped spinel full cells achieved 85% after 100 cycles at 1 C rate at 55 °C. In order to take advantage of the synergetic effects, other dual cation (such as Y–Co,90 Zn–Ti134) and multi cation (such as Cu–Al–Ti,78 Li–Co–Gd,92 Li–Mg–Ca and Li–Mg–Ca–Ti125) doped spinels have also been evaluated for the improvement of high temperature performance.

3.2. Anion and cation doping
Oxy-(fluoride, chloride, sulfide, etc.) spinels substituted by cations are typically investigated for enhanced cyclability at elevated temperatures. X. M. He et al.147 prepared various kinds of fluorine-doped spherical LiMn2O4 spinels by controlled crystallization from carbonates. They found that substitution of O2− ions by F− ions could cause an increase in Mn3+ ion amount, which enhances the Jahn–Teller effect and worsens the cyclability of LiMn2O4 spinels. However, compared to other samples, the 5% fluorine surface-doped spherical LiMn2O4 spinel with a Li:Mn ratio of 1.15:2 and significantly decreased lattice parameter exhibited the best cyclability at 55 °C (87.5%, 50 cycles), the smallest capacity difference during cycling, and the highest tap density of 2.1 g cm−3. A series of LiMn2−y−zLiyMzO4−ηFη (M = Ti, Ni, Cu) oxy-fluoride spinels have been prepared by firing LiMn2−y−zLiyMzO4 with NH4HF2 at a moderate temperature, wherein LiMn1.8Li0.1Ni0.1O3.8F0.2 exhibits superior capacity retention (98.1%) at 60 °C without sacrificing the capacity significantly (still over 100 mA h g−1) for 50 cycles, which is ascribed to the smaller lattice parameter difference between the two cubic phases formed during the charge–discharge process and the sufficiently suppressed manganese dissolution.148 Subsequently, it was pointed out by W. Choi et al.149 that the superior cyclability of LiMn1.8Li0.1Ni0.1O3.8F0.2 at elevated temperatures can also be attributed to the relatively high initial Mn valence (>3.6+) and maintenance of good crystallinity during cycling. Furthermore, LiMn1.8Li0.1Ni0.1O3.8F0.2/C full cells also showed better cyclability than LiMn2O4/C full cells at C/5 rate at 60 °C. Similarly, LiMn1.85Li0.075Zn0.075O3.85F0.15 (ref. 150) and LiMn1.7Li0.15Co0.15O3.76F0.24 (ref. 151) spinels were also reported to possess excellent cyclability at elevated temperatures with capacities over 100 mA h g−1 at C/5 rate for 50 cycles. Recently, D. W. Han et al.144 investigated the effects of Li and Cl co-doping on the electrochemical performances and structural stability of LiMn2O4 spinels. They demonstrated that the high temperature cycling performance of Li1.05Mn1.95O3.95Cl0.05 electrode was better than those of pristine LiMn2O4 and Li1.05Mn1.95O4 electrodes in both half and full cells, which was ascribed to the efficiently suppressed Mn dissolution and the reduced electrode resistance caused by the reinforcement of MnO6 octahedra in the Li1.05Mn1.95O3.95Cl0.05 framework by the strong ionic Mn–Cl bonds formed by the co-doping of Li and Cl (Fig. 17). An oxy-sulfide spinel, LiAl0.24Mn1.76O3.98S0.02, was initially evaluated by Y. K. Sun et al.160 and found to exhibit excellent cyclability at C/3 rate for 50 cycles at elevated temperatures (97%, 50 °C; 95%, 80 °C) due to its small structural degradation. They also clarified that the minor accelerated capacity loss at the elevated temperature of 80 °C may originate from Li2MnO3 detected at the surface of the discharged electrode by HRTEM imaging and digital diffractograms. Subsequently, another oxysulfide spinel (LiAl0.18Mn1.82O3.97S0.03) with superior cyclability at high temperatures was also investigated by Y. K. Sun et al.161 and they concluded that the small accelerated capacity loss after 50 cycles at 80 °C was associated with the formation of both Li2Mn2O4 and Li2MnO3 phases at the surface of the discharged electrode.

In summary, at the cost of minor and acceptable initial specific capacity loss, the optimized element doping strategy can efficiently improve structural stability, suppress Jahn–Teller distortion, and increase mean Mn valence in most instances. Hence, the severe capacity deterioration of LiMn2O4 spinels at elevated temperatures can be greatly alleviated. Obviously, to take advantage of the synergetic effects by different doping modes, more fundamental and theoretical research is needed in designing oxygen-stoichiometric doped spinels, surface doped spinels, concentration-gradient doped spinels, and dual or multi element doped spinels.
4. Surface coatings
Surface coating is one effective and controllable approach that can be taken to stabilize the LiMn2O4/electrolyte interface, and yields an artificial protective layer that inhibits the Mn dissolution of LiMn2O4 spinel.164–167 The coating materials mainly include various oxides,168–206 fluorides,207–212 phosphates,213–219 lithium compounds,168,180,219–236 along with other coating compounds (such as carbon materials,237 carbonate,238 and polymers239,240). In this part, we mainly concentrate on examples of surface coated/modified LiMn2O4 spinels for the improvement of cycling performance at elevated temperatures (Table 5).

4.1. Oxide coatings

4.1.1. Al2O3 coatings. 
Initially, it was reported by A. M. Kannan168 and A. Eftekhari169 that Al2O3-coated LiMn2O4 spinel can significantly reduce the capacity fading of uncoated LiMn2O4 spinel at elevated temperatures. J. Tu et al.170 successfully obtained nano-Al2O3 surface-coated LiMn2O4 by melting impregnation method, and it was confirmed by XAFS that Al atoms were doped onto the surface of LiMn2O4 particles. It was demonstrated that the Al2O3 surface-modified LiMn2O4 electrode showed superior capacity retention than unmodified LiMn2O4 and LiAl0.04Mn1.96O4 electrodes at C/2 rate at 55 °C, which was attributed to the suppression of surface Jahn–Teller distortion and a retardation of manganese dissolution by the co-existence of an Al-diffusion surface layer and oxide coating on the surface, hence maintaining good structural stability and good electrical contact. The use of a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) functionalized Al2O3 coating on LiMn2O4 surfaces can lead to a uniform coating layer with controllable coating thickness.171 The Al2O3 coating layer was demonstrated to be amorphous, and the formed amorphous Li–Mn–Al–O solid solution is believed to provide the Li-ion conduction pathways. Subsequently, uniform Al2O3-coated LiMn2O4 spinels functionalized with PVP were proved to exhibit significantly improved cycling performance at 1 C rate at 65 °C (90%, 95 cycles) compared to the uncoated counterpart, which was ascribed to the greatly reduced reactivity at the spinel surface and electrolyte interface (the obviously suppressed Mn dissolution). Based on the density functional theory, C. Y. Ouyang et al.172 concluded that the oxidation state of surface Mn atoms changes from +3 to +4 by covering the LiMn2O4 (001) surface with Al2O3, explaining the improved performances of Al2O3-coated LiMn2O4 cathodes in Li-ion batteries. W. K. Kim et al.173 synthesized 2 wt% amorphous Al2O3-coated LiMn2O4 by using electrostatic attraction forces. The enhanced high temperature cyclability of Al2O3-coated LiMn2O4 was attributed to the reduced charge transfer resistance and inhibited Mn dissolution by coating with Al2O3.
Recently, spinel LiMn1.97Ti0.03O4 (LMT) coated with aluminum nitrate was heat-treated at 700 °C for 3 h by L. L. Xiong et al.174 It was revealed by XRD and FTIR analyses that Al ions partially diffused into the spinel surface to form a crystal LiAlxMn1.97−xTi0.03O4 solid solution layer. It was also shown by HRTEM that the thin Al2O3 layer compactly coats on the particle surface and exhibits a high degree of crystallinity (Fig. 18a). As demonstrated in Fig. 18b–d, the Al2O3-modified LMT spinel (MLMT, heat-treated at mid-temperature, 700 °C) exhibited significantly enhanced capacity retention and consistent discharge curves even after 50 cycles at 55 °C compared to pristine LiMn2O4 (LM) and LMT. The improved cyclability of MLMT was ascribed to the double layers, i.e., LiAlxMn1.97−xTi0.03O4 solid solution layer and thin Al2O3 layer coated on the surface. The compact Al2O3 thin layer could effectively suppress HF damage by scavenging HF and blocking the direct contact between the electrolyte and spinel particles, which was confirmed by Mn dissolution analysis. Meanwhile, the LiAlxMn1.97−xTi0.03O4 solid solution layer could enhance the stability of the spinel structure due to the stronger Al–O bond (Fig. 18e). And the stability-enhanced spinel was favorable for the migration of Li+ and delivered lower internal resistance (Fig. 18f).

4.1.2. ZnO coatings. 
The improved cyclability of ZnO-coated LiMn2O4 spinels than uncoated spinels at elevated temperatures has been ascribed to the reduced HF in the electrolyte and the suppression of Mn dissolution by ZnO coating.175–177 J. Q. Zhao et al.178 used the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method to deposit ultrathin and highly conformal ZnO coatings onto LiMn2O4 cathodes with precise thickness-control at the atomic scale. The electrode composed of LiMn2O4 particles coated with 6 ZnO ALD layers (1.02 nm thick) delivered the highest final specific capacity and the best cyclability among the various ZnO ALD modified samples after 100 cycles at 1 C rate at 55 °C. Subsequently, it was proved that the 6 ZnO ALD modified LiMn2O4 spinel exhibited superior high temperature cycling performances than 6 ZrO2 and 6 Al2O3 ALD modified LiMn2O4 spinels.179 ZnO, Al2O3, CoO and LiCoO2 surface modified LiMn2O4 spinels have been successfully prepared by J. Tu et al.180via melting impregnation method. In general, the surface modified samples showed better capacity retention than the unmodified LiMn2O4 spinel at C/2 rate at 55 °C. Among these samples, the ZnO-modified LiMn2O4 spinel exhibited the best combination of a high capacity and a low capacity deterioration rate of 0.064% per cycle at C/2 rate at 55 °C. J. Tu et al.181 investigated ZnO-coated LiAl0.04Mn1.96O4 spinel, which showed no significant structural destruction after being aged in an electrolyte at 60 °C for 20 days. As expected, ZnO-coated LiAl0.04Mn1.96O4 electrode exhibited better cyclability (0.041% fading per cycle) than LiAl0.04Mn1.96O4 electrode (0.178% fading per cycle) at 55 °C, which was attributed to the suppression of HF-induced Mn dissolution and the maintained structural integrity during cycling. The effects of ZnO coating on the Li1.05Al0.1Mn1.85O3.95F0.05 spinel at the elevated temperature were investigated by J. M. Han et al.182 The 2 wt% ZnO-coated Li1.05Al0.1Mn1.85O3.95F0.05 spinel showed excellent capacity retention of about 98.5% after 50 cycles at 55 °C in half-cells. Furthermore, the MCMB/2 wt% ZnO-coated Li1.05Al0.1Mn1.85O3.95F0.05 full cell maintained about 80% of its initial capacity after 300 cycles at 55 °C (Fig. 19a). It was confirmed that Mn dissolution from 2 wt% ZnO-coated Li1.05Al0.1Mn1.85O3.95F0.05 cathode and Mn deposition onto the carbon anode were greatly alleviated (Fig. 19b and c) and this can be ascribed to the suppression of HF propagation into the electrolyte during cycling by scavenging the acid species with amphoteric ZnO nanoparticles (Fig. 19d).

4.1.3. ZrO2 coatings. 
It was reported by M. M. Thackeray et al.183,184 that ZrO2 particles with pH values greater than 7 can counter the acid attack by scavenging the unwanted HF. Consequently, surface treatment of LiMn2O4 with porous amorphous ZrO2 can dramatically improve the cyclability of the spinel electrode at 50 °C. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that LiMn2O4 and substituted Li1.05M0.05Mn1.9O4 (M = Al and Ni) spinel electrodes, coated with colloidal ZrO2 particles, provided better cyclability at 50 °C in half cells compared to Al2O3- and SiO2-coated electrodes, which was attributed to the lack of a chemical reaction between porous ZrO2 and spinel particles during the coating process, and the ability of the high specific surface area ZrO2 particles to remove both HF and H2O effectively from the electrolyte. Furthermore, ZrO2-coated Li1.05Ni0.05Mn1.9O4 spinel exhibited superior cyclability at 50 °C than ZrO2-coated LiMn2O4, which was ascribed to the electronic interaction between Ni and Mn ions on the octahedral B-site sub-array in suppressing the disproportionation reaction.184 ZrO2-coated LiMn2O4 spinel nanoparticles have been prepared by MnO2 nanowire templates with the assistance of PVP.185 The thickness of the amorphous ZrO2 coating layers were controllable and layers containing the Zr–Li–Mn–O solid solution were uniformly distributed on the particle surfaces. 1 wt% ZrO2-coated LiMn2O4 spinel with a 6 nm thick layer demonstrated significantly improved specific capacity, rate capability and cyclability (1 C, 55 cycles, 95%) at 65 °C than uncoated spinels, which was associated with the fact that the ZrO2 coating layer minimizes Mn dissolution from the spinel lattice. Except the neutralization of HF, K. A. Walz et al.186 proposed that the stabilizing effect of nanoporous ZrO2 coatings on LiMn2O4 electrodes also appeared to result from a more uniform current distribution provided by the complex nanoporous ZrO2 network. D. W. Shin et al.187 prepared amorphous ZrO2-modified LiMn2O4 thin-film cathodes by pulsed laser deposition. They identified that the ZrO2 modification decreased the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and unwanted phase transition (the disappearance of plateaus in the 3.9 V and 4.1 V regions) of the LiMn2O4 cathode film. Ultrathin crystalline ZrO2 nanofilms have been facilely deposited on LiMn2O4 particles at 120 °C using atomic layer deposition (ALD) by J. Q. Zhao et al.188 The ZrO2 coating shows high crystallinity, conformality and homogeneity, which contribute to the considerably improved electro-chemical performance of LiMn2O4 at elevated temperatures in lithium-ion batteries. However, the specific capacity delivered by ZrO2-coated and uncoated LiMn2O4 electrodes is relatively low. Recently, J. Q. Zhao et al.189 reported that an epitaxial ZrO2 ALD coating on LiMn2O4 nanoparticles showed high conformality, uniformity (Fig. 20a and b) and precise thickness control at the atomic scale (2 Å per ALD cycle). Two distinct ZrO2 layers on the underlying LiMn2O4 illustrate the evolution of ZrO2 ALD coating from amorphous to crystalline phase (Fig. 20b). The effect of tuning ZrO2 ALD coating thickness on improving capacity retention of LiMn2O4 was phenomenal at 1 C and 5 C rates at 55 °C (Fig. 20c and d). The remarkable cyclability of 6 ZrO2 ALD LMO (the optimal thickness of the ZrO2 coating was 1.2 nm) after the 50th cycle indicates that the residual ZrO2 protective film after consumption of HF acid is beneficial to lithium ion diffusion and can effectively alleviate decomposition of the electrolyte and reduce electrochemical polarization on the surface of the LiMn2O4 particles.

4.1.4. Other oxide coatings. 
Many other coating oxides or mixed oxides, such as MgO,171,190 Cr2O3,191 Mn2O3,192 La2O3,193–195 Co3O4,196 CeO2,197,198 TiO2,186,199 SiO2,184,200–202 VOx,203,204 Co–Al mixed oxide,205 indium tin oxide (ITO),206etc., have also been investigated for the improvement of cycling or storage performances at elevated temperatures. For example, porous MgO-coated LiMn2O4 spinels prepared via a sonochemical method were preliminarily investigated by J. S. Gnanaraj et al.190 The capacity fading of MgO-coated LiMn2O4 electrodes at 60 °C was much smaller compared to the uncoated LiMn2O4 electrodes, which was attributed to the much lower impedance and faster kinetics of MgO-coated LiMn2O4 electrodes than the uncoated LiMn2O4 electrodes. Recently, a PVP functionalized amorphous MgO coating on LiMn2O4 spinel nanoparticles (Fig. 21a) was synthesized by S. Lim et al.171 The formation of a Li–Mn–Mg–O solid solution (Fig. 21b) is believed to provide Li-ion conduction pathways. It was demonstrated that PVP functionalized MgO-coated LiMn2O4 spinels exhibited a superior cycling performance at 1 C rate at 65 °C (95%, 95 cycles) compared to the other counterparts, which was ascribed to the suppression of Mn dissolution from the spinel lattice by a uniform and dense MgO coating layer (Fig. 21c). H. Şahan et al.191 described how a uniform Cr2O3 particle coating increases the Mn4+ concentration at the surface of LiMn2O4 and suppresses Mn3+ disproportionation by stabilizing the spinel.

4.2. Fluoride and oxyfluoride coatings
Recently, some coating fluorides and an oxyfluoride, such as SrF2,207 MgF2,208 LaF3,209 AlF3,210 FeF3,211 and BiOF,212 have been evaluated for the improvement of high temperature performances of LiMn2O4-based batteries. J. G. Li et al.207 first prepared uniform SrF2-coated LiMn2O4 spinels by using chemical deposition, and the electrochemical performances of the SrF2-coated samples were obviously improved. In view of discharge specific capacity and cyclability, the 2.0% (molar fraction) SrF2-coated LiMn2O4 spinel showed the optimum capacity retention of 97% after 20 cycles at 55 °C, whereas the uncoated sample only retained 79% of the initial specific capacity. It was speculated that the improved cyclability of SrF2-coated spinels at elevated temperatures could be ascribed to the suppression of Mn dissolution and the reduced formation of LiF films by the inactive SrF2. MgF2 is also inactive in the electrolyte, and the capacity retention of 3.0 wt% MgF2-coated LiMn2O4 was found to be 76.7% at 1 C rate at 55 °C after 100 cycles, which was significantly higher than that of the uncoated LiMn2O4 (61.9%).208 The improved cyclability of MgF2-coated LiMn2O4 at the elevated temperature was associated with the reduction of Mn3+ dissolution and the suppressed oxidation of the electrolyte. Q. Q. Chen et al.209 prepared LaF3-modified LiMn2O4 spinels by a chemical deposition method. Despite the fact that the LaF3 was not uniformly coated on the surface of the LiMn2O4 spinels (Fig. 22a), the LaF3-coated LiMn2O4 spinels still exhibited superior cyclability than pristine LiMn2O4 at 1 C rate at 25 °C, wherein the 3 wt% LaF3-coated LiMn2O4 (LaF3-3-LMO) showed the best cycling performance (Fig. 22b). Furthermore, the specific capacity retention of the LaF3-3-LMO after 100 cycles at 1 C rate at 55 °C was 84.2%, while that of pristine LiMn2O4 was only 54.8% (Fig. 22c). The excellent cyclability may result from the suppression of Mn dissolution and the reduction of charge transfer resistance (Rct) during cycling with the help of the LaF3 coating (Fig. 22d). FeF3-coated LiMn2O4 spinels were also synthesized via a chemical deposition method by S. Zhao et al.211 It was demonstrated that 5 wt% FeF3-coated LiMn2O4 cathode exhibited the optimal cyclability (61.5%, 100 cycles) at 0.2 C rate at 55 °C, much better than that of the pristine LiMn2O4 (40.2%, 100 cycles). Except for the suppression of Mn dissolution and the alleviated increasing of the impedance, the improved cyclability of FeF3-coated LiMn2O4 at 55 °C was also ascribed to the superior thermal stability to the pristine LiMn2O4.

Adapted from ref. 209 by permission of Elsevier. 
The electrochemical performances of nanocrystalline bismuth oxyfluoride (BiOF) coated Li[Li0.1Al0.05Mn1.85]O4 spinel (Fig. 23a) at 55 °C were investigated by K. S. Lee et al.212 The capacity retention of the uniform BiOF-coated Li[Li0.1Al0.05Mn1.85]O4 electrode was 96.1% after 100 cycles at 1 C rate at 55 °C, while that of the Li[Li0.1Al0.05Mn1.85]O4 electrode was only 84.4% (even though the spinel was sufficiently stabilized by substitution of Mn for Al) of its initial discharge capacity (Fig. 23b and c). Upon extensive cycling at 1 C rate at 55 °C, the lattice fringes of Li[Li0.1Al0.05Mn1.85]O4 became increasingly discontinuous towards the particle edge, and the particle surface became amorphous and extremely rough due to the HF attack (Fig. 23d). In contrast, for the BiOF-coated Li[Li0.1Al0.05Mn1.85]O4, the protective BiOF coating layer remains on the particle surface after extensive cycling, and the crystallinity of the BiOF-coated Li[Li0.1Al0.05Mn1.85]O4 was well maintained on the particle surface (Fig. 23e). The beneficial effects of the BiOF coating layer in maintaining the structure of the Li[Li0.1Al0.05Mn1.85]O4 were ascribed to the scavenging of HF in the electrolyte (confirmed by the formation of BiF3) and the suppression of the HF attack.

4.3. Phosphate coatings
Phosphates, such as AlPO4,213,214 FePO4,215,216 YPO4,217 LaPO4 (ref. 218) and Li3PO4,219 have also been investigated as coating materials on the surface of LiMn2O4 spinels for the improvement of cyclability or thermostability at elevated temperatures. The AlPO4-coated LiMn2O4 spinel was preliminarily reported by D. Q. Liu et al.213 The 1 wt% AlPO4-coated LiMn2O4 exhibited a capacity retention of 92.4% after 50 cycles at C/2 rate at 55 °C, much better than that of uncoated LiMn2O4 (67.1%). The improved cyclability was ascribed to the AlPO4 coating layer minimizing the contact area of the LiMn2O4/electrolyte interface, thus suppressing the dissolution of Mn and stabilizing the spinel structure effectively. S. Lee et al.214 synthesized 0.3 wt% AlPO4-coated Li1.09Mn1.83Al0.08O4 (APLMO) cathode material and it was inferred that a portion of the P ions diffuse into the spinel structure (Fig. 24a). It was demonstrated (see Fig. 24b) that the capacity retention of Li1.09Mn1.83Al0.08O4 (BLMO) and APLMO electrodes in half cells after 200 cycles at 60 °C was 83% and 88%, respectively, significantly better than that of the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 (STLMO) electrode (54%). Furthermore, after 200 cycles at 0.5 C rate at 60 °C, the pouch-type full cell with APLMO as cathode exhibited a capacity retention of 78%, which was higher than that with BLMO (71% retention) (Fig. 24c). It is well known that, in the full cells, dissolved Mn ions cause deterioration of the graphite anode materials, and therefore the AlPO4 coating layer can decrease the Mn dissolution effectively. More importantly, a Li-ion cell containing the AlPO4-coated cathode did not exhibit a swelling problem after 200 cycles at 60 °C, whereas BLMO showed undesirable swelling (Fig. 24d). This was ascribed to the formation of a protecting solid solution and the suppressed formation of insulating impurities or defective phases by the AlPO4 coating. Accordingly, it was concluded that a combination of doping and surface coating is required to ensure the cycling stability of the spinel materials at elevated temperatures. Similarly, the improved cyclability of FePO4, YPO4, LaPO4 and Li3PO4-coated LiMn2O4 spinels at elevated temperatures could be ascribed to the following reasons: (1) the separation of electrolytes and active materials, thus preventing the dissolution of Mn ions and ensuring structural stability; (2) reducing charge transfer resistance between cathode and electrolytes; (3) increasing the conductivity of the SEI layer and facilitating the diffusion of lithium ions through the coating layer.

4.4. Lithium compound coatings
The lithium coating compounds that have been investigated for the enhancement of electrochemical performances of spinels at elevated temperatures, mainly include electrode materials (such as LixCoO2,168,180,220–222 LiNixCo1−xO2,168,222 LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2,223 Li4Ti5O12,224,225etc.), solid electrolytes (such as Li–Al–Si–O,226 Li–La–Ti–O,227–229 Li–B–Si–O,230 Li–La–Zr–O,231 Li–B–O,232–234etc.), and others (such as LiAlO2,235 Li2MnO3,236 Li3PO4,219etc.).

4.4.1. Electrode material coatings. 
LiCoO2-coated LiMn2O4 spinel was synthesized by a micro-emulsion process.220 The cyclability of spinels at 55 °C in half cells was improved by the LiCoO2 coating, which was mainly attributed to the suppressed Mn dissolution upon cycling. It was also demonstrated that the rate of self-discharge of 4 wt% LiCoO2-coated LiMn2O4/graphite full cell in fully charged state at 55 °C for 4 weeks was significantly reduced compared to that of the pristine LiMn2O4/graphite full cell. It has been reported by D. Shu et al.221 that a LiCoO2-layer can be coated on the surface of LiMn2O4 by an electrostatic spray deposition technique, and the improved cyclability at 55 °C compared to the pristine LiMn2O4 was further ascribed to the homogeneous Li+ insertion/extraction (reduced charge transfer resistance) and enhanced structural stability upon cycling. A. M. Kannan et al.168 reported that, among the various coating materials investigated, the Li0.75CoO2-modified spinel showed the best combination of high initial capacity (124.4 mA h g−1) and excellent cyclability at C/2 rate at 60 °C (92%, 100 cycles). Furthermore, the LiNi0.5Co0.5O2-modified spinel showed superior capacity retention with a fade rate of <0.03% per cycle over 100 cycles at C/2 rate at 60 °C. Subsequently, the superior performance of the surface modified cathodes at elevated temperatures was determined to be due to the maintenance of low micro-strain and better structural integrity and crystallinity during cycling. In order to minimize the use of expensive cobalt, LiNi0.8Co0.2O2-coated LiMn2O4 was explored and it was confirmed that the LiNi0.8Co0.2O2 coating was also very effective in obtaining excellent cyclability of LiMn2O4 at elevated temperatures.222 Similarly, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2-coated LiMn2O4 has also been investigated.223 An appropriate amount of Li4Ti5O12 coating on the surface of LiMn2O4 spinel can reduce the capacity fading of LiMn2O4 at elevated temperatures, which has been attributed to the suppression of electrolyte decomposition on the surface of LiMn2O4.224 Using a Li deficient Li3.5Ti5O12 layer coated LiMn2O4 as precursor, a spinel Li–Ti–O phase coated LiMn2O4 with high surface Mn valence (resulting in a stabilized surface structure) was prepared by annealing at 750 °C.225 The uniform Li–Ti–O-coated LiMn2O4 exhibited lower SEI resistance than counterparts after 50 cycles at 1 C rate at 55 °C, indicating that the reaction between the cathode surface and electrolyte was greatly suppressed by the Li–Ti–O layer. Hence, the cyclability of the Li–Ti–O-coated LiMn2O4 spinel was enhanced at 1 C rate at 55 °C compared to the Li4Ti5O12-coated LiMn2O4 spinel.


4.4.2. Solid electrolyte coatings. 
A solid electrolyte is ideal as a coating material for high ion conductivity. Li–Al–Si–O (LASO) glassy solid electrolyte coated Li1.05Co0.1Mn1.9O3.95F0.05 (LCMOF) spinel rods (Fig. 25a inset) were reported by D. H. Hu et al.226 It is believed that the Li+ cation is the only mobile species in the LASO glassy solid electrolyte and there is no lattice matching problem between the amorphous solid electrolyte and the spinel. It was shown that LASO-coated LCMOF rods exhibited superior rate capability (15 C, 87 mA h g−1) than that of LCMOF rods (15 C, 70.5 mA h g−1) at 55 °C (Fig. 25a). The capacity retention of LCMOF rods and LASO-coated LCMOF rods after 200 cycles at 10 C rate at 55 °C was 94.2% (the initial capacity was 80.1 mA h g−1) and 96.3% (initial capacity of 93.9 mA h g−1), respectively (Fig. 25b). The good cyclability of LCMOF rods can be attributed to the restrained volume distortion by the rod nanostructure and the stabilized crystal structure by Co–F doping. The superior rate capability and cyclability of the LASO-coated LCMOF rods was ascribed to the enhanced kinetics of lithium-ion diffusion through the surface layer and charge transfer reaction by the LASO coating (Fig. 25c and d). It is known that lithium lanthanum titanate (LLTO) is one of the fastest lithium-ion conductors to date.227–229 [Li,La]TiO3 was introduced as a novel coating material on LiMn2O4 by K. H. Jung et al.227 After a storage test at 65 °C, the [Li,La]TiO3 modified LiMn2O4 electrode showed a more stable structure and surface morphology against contact with electrolytes than the pristine LiMn2O4 electrode. In addition, Mn dissolution was also significantly suppressed by the [Li,La]TiO3 coating. As a result, the [Li,La]TiO3 modified LiMn2O4 electrode exhibited enhanced electrochemical properties and decreased interfacial resistance after storage at elevated temperatures, compared with those of the pristine LiMn2O4 electrode. It has been pointed out by H. Şahan et al.230 that lithium-based superionic conducting glasses exhibit higher ionic conductivity than their crystalline counterparts due to their more open structure for ionic transport. Subsequently, a lithium borosilicate (LBS) glass coated LiMn2O4 spinel was investigated, and it was demonstrated that LBS-coated LiMn2O4 showed better capacity retention (71.6%) than pristine LiMn2O4 (53%) for 70 cycles at elevated temperatures. Yu-Feng Deng et al.231 synthesized solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (Li–La–Zr–O, LLZO)-coated LiMn1.95Ni0.05O3.98F0.02 (LMNO) spinels, and the capacity of LLZO-coated LMNO electrode retained 91.4% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles at 0.5 C rate at 55 °C, while that of the pristine LMNO electrode retained 78.2%. This significant improvement was mainly due to the presence of the LLZO coating layer that can suppress Mn dissolution without blocking Li+ migration. It has been reported by G. G. Amatucci et al.232 that lithium borate (LBO) glass coated Li1+xMn2−xO4 spinel shows improved storage characteristics in full cells at elevated temperatures, which was attributed to the inhibited electrolyte catalytic activity of the spinel by LBO.

4.4.3. Other lithium compound coatings. 
It was demonstrated by Y. C. Sun et al.235 that the capacity retention of the inorganic salt LiAlO2-modified LiMn2O4 spinel was about 90% after 200 cycles at 1 C rate at 55 °C. It was confirmed that Al3+ diffuses into the lattice of the surface LiMn2O4 spinel and a 12 nm surface solid solution LiAlxMn2−xO4 was formed. The replacement of disproportional Mn3+ by Al3+ in the LiAlxMn2−xO4 layer greatly hindered the structural degradation of the spinel at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the LiAlO2-modified spinel surface could prevent the dissolution of Mn3+ and enhance the transportation of Li+. Recently, L. L. Xiong et al.236 synthesized Li2MnO3 coated Li[LiyMn2−y]O4−zFz spinel via a one-step solid-state reaction. It was inferred that the ionic co-doping could eliminate the problems induced by cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion and suppress the Li+-ion order at 0.5 Li. Furthermore, the inactive Li2MnO3 coating with only Mn4+ ions could prevent the disproportionation of Mn3+ on the surface. Consequently, the modified samples exhibited greatly enhanced cyclability at elevated temperatures.

4.5. Other coating materials
Tremendous efforts have been paid to synthesize carbon-coated LiMn2O4 spinels to enhance their rate capability.237 J. X. Wang et al.237 first reported the introduction of sputtering a graphite layer covering on the surface of an LiMn2O4 electrode to form a protective layer as a solution to solve the rapid capacity fading of the LiMn2O4-based lithium ion battery at elevated temperatures. As illustrated in Fig. 26a–c, the graphite layer covered LiMn2O4 electrode (G–LMO) and electrode containing graphite layer-coated LiMn2O4 particles (LMO/G) exhibited superior cyclability at 1 C rate at 55 °C than untreated LiMn2O4 (LMO). Compared with the cycled LMO electrode, the cycled G–LMO electrode could retain a good spinel structure (without MnO2 impurity) and withstand HF attack (less Mn dissolution into the electrolyte, 0.024 wt%) due to the protection of the graphite layer, after 200 cycles at 1 C rate at 55 °C (Fig. 26d and e). Carbonate (CaCO3)238 and polymers (such as PDDA,239 p(MA–AM)240) have also been investigated as coating materials on LiMn2O4, but the cyclability at elevated temperatures was not greatly improved.

In most cases, a surface coating layer can suppress HF attack, inhibit Mn dissolution, and reduce charge transfer resistance by scavenging HF and blocking the direct contact of electrolytes and spinels. As for the oxide coatings, the formation of a solid solution layer can improve the structural stability of the spinels (acting as a kind of surface element doping). A single optimized surface coating is capable of delivering comparable or even higher initial specific capacity than pristine LiMn2O4 in some cases.171,189,237 Also, at almost no cost to the initial specific capacity (perhaps even improving it), further surface coating can significantly enhance the cyclability and rate capability of the element doped spinels at elevated temperatures.174,212,226 Therefore the combination of element doping and surface coating modes may be a reasonable and wise choice and consequently urgently requires further investigation.
5. Newly developed strategies
5.1. Functional separator/gel electrolyte developments
Recently, T. Yim et al.241 first proposed a facile method for construction of a functionalized multi-layered separator to enhance the cyclability of graphite/LiMn2O4 full cells at elevated temperatures. As shown in Fig. 27a, the functionalized multi-layered separator (PE–SiO2–TEOS) consists of an interlayer with polar hydroxyl groups to promote the chemical reactivity between the hydrophobic separator (PE) and the HF scavenging surface layer (TEOS derived). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the graphite/LiMn2O4 full cell with PE–SiO2–TEOS separator exhibited the best cyclability (80.7%) at 0.5 C rate at 60 °C for 50 cycles (Fig. 27b). A reduced Mn content in the anode cycled with the PE–SiO2–TEOS separator was confirmed by ICP-MS analysis. Furthermore, the formation of Si–F bonds due to the chemical reaction between TEOS groups and HF was clearly indicated by FT-IR analysis (Fig. 27c). Finally, a plausible mechanism for HF scavenging by the PE–SiO2–TEOS separator was proposed (Fig. 27d). It has also been reported by J. J. Chen et al.242 that a porous SiO2 separator can alleviate LiMn2O4/Li capacity deterioration at 55 °C, which was ascribed to the excellent electrolyte infiltration and retention performance of hydrophilic SiO2, and the good ability of SiO2 to capture trace amounts of moisture and acidic impurities in the electrolyte. An ion-exchangeable separator with sodium carboxylate functional groups was firstly synthesized (Fig. 28a) by S. H. Woo et al.243 and preliminarily investigated for the high temperature cyclability of Li1.1Mn1.86Mg0.04O4/graphite full cells. It was declared that the ion exchange between Na+ ions of the functional groups and the dissolved Mn2+ ions from the LiMn2O4 electrode could possibly account for the trapping of Mn2+ (Fig. 28b) to inhibit the reduction of Mn2+ on the surface of the lithiated graphite anode, resulting in an enhanced cyclability at elevated temperatures than the untreated separators.

Y. B. Liu et al.244 reported a novel simple method to solve the issue of Mn2+ dissolution by using lithiated ion-exchange membranes (lithiated perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA-Li) polymer) swollen with an organic non-aqueous solvent as the gel electrolyte in LiMn2O4/Li half cells. The potential advantages of using ion-exchange membranes mainly include fast cation transport, anion exclusion, and the absence of added lithium salts (especially LiPF6). As expected, the LiMn2O4/Li half cells using EC-PC swollen PFSA-Li as both electrolyte and separator showed very high capacity retention at 60 °C compared to cells using conventional LiPF6-EC-DMC liquid electrolyte. Recently, our group reported a novel PLTB (polymeric lithium tartaric acid borate) lithium salt (Fig. 29a) and fabricated a single-ion gel polymer electrolyte of PLTB@PVDF-HFP (PLTB@poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene)).245,246 The PLTB lithium salt was verified to possess superior thermal stability compared to both LiPF6 and LiBOB salt. The PC or EC/DMC swollen PLTB@PVDF-HFP membrane exhibited not only considerable ionic conductivity and a high lithium ion transference number, but also good interfacial compatibility with the lithium metal anode as well as the Al substrate and high anodic electrochemical stability. As a result, it was demonstrated that the cells comprising Li/LiFePO4 (ref. 245) and Li4Ti5O12/LiFePO4 (ref. 246) using organic solvent (PC245 and EC/DMC246) swollen PLTB@PVDF-HFP as both electrolyte and separator exhibited excellent performances at elevated temperatures. Subsequently, the highly thermally stable PLTB@PVDF-HFP membrane (Fig. 29b) swollen by EC/DMC was used in Li/LiMn2O4 half cells.247 As expected, the Li/LiMn2O4 cells using PLTB@PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte showed better capacity retention (76.9%, 100 cycles) than cells using LiFP6-based electrolyte (45.4%, 100 cycles) at 0.5 C at 55 °C (Fig. 29 c). As shown in Fig. 29d, the impedance growth of cells with PLTB@PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte was significantly retarded after 100 cycles at 55 °C, which may be associated with the alleviated decomposition of gel electrolyte and the suppressed formation of LiF on the surface of the LiMn2O4 spinel. Furthermore, ICP-MS analysis showed that the Mn dissolution in cells with PLTB@PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte was greatly suppressed (8.4 ppm) compared to those with LiPF6-based electrolyte (39.8 ppm) after 50 cycles at 55 °C. Generally, the superior performances of organic solvent swollen PLTB@PVDF-HFP gel electrolyte endow this class of gel polymer electrolyte as a very promising alternative to LiPF6-based liquid electrolytes in lithium ion batteries.

5.2. Functional binder developments
S. H. Woo et al.243 also reported a series of ion-exchangeable binders with sodium carboxylate or sulfonate functional groups (Fig. 30a). They demonstrated that full cells comprised of a Li1.1Mn1.86Mg0.04O2 cathode prepared with PVdF and a graphite anode prepared with ion-exchangeable binders (CMC, PSS, Alginate) exhibited superior cyclability at 60 °C (Fig. 30b). After soaking the various binders in the manganese-dissolved electrolyte at 60 °C for 1 week, the Mn and Na concentrations in the electrolyte were obviously decreased and increased, respectively, which was attributed to the ion-exchange effect (Fig. 30c and f). In the lithiated graphite electrode prepared with the PVdF binder, a mixture of LiC12 and LiC24 phases was observed after 60 min soaking in the manganese-dissolved electrolyte, accompanying the entire disappearance of the LiC6 phase (Fig. 30d). This was attributed to the reduction of dissolved Mn2+ ions into Mn metal through oxidation of the lithiated graphite. However, in the fully lithiated graphite electrodes prepared with CMC binder, a negligible amount of LiC12 phase was observed even after 60 min soaking, which was ascribed to the ion-exchange effect between Mn2+ and Na+ ions of the binders. Similarly, M. H. Ryou et al.248 reported water-soluble and fluorine-free alginate extracted from brown seaweed as a polymeric binder for the spinel LiMn2O4 electrode. It was verified that the Mn2+ chelation ability of the alginate was more than three orders of magnitude higher than that of PVDF, and more importantly, the Li+ diffusion was not affected by the alginate. Consequently, LiMn2O4/Li half cells and LiMn2O4/graphite full cells with spinel LiMn2O4 electrodes prepared with alginate binder exhibited excellent cyclability at 1 C rate at 55 °C in both LiPF6-based electrolyte and LiBOB-based electrolyte (Fig. 31). Under the same conditions, the full cells exhibited more severe capacity deterioration, indicating that the graphite–electrolyte interface was much more vulnerable to attack by dissolved Mn2+ ions. Very recently, LiMn2O4 cathodes with four different binder/solvent systems (PAA/NMP, PVDF/NMP, PAA/H2O, CMC/H2O) were investigated by Z. A. Zhang et al.249 It was proved that the LiMn2O4 cathode with the PAA/H2O system displayed the best cyclability at both 25 °C and 55 °C, which was related to strong binding ability, appropriate swelling properties and homogeneous distribution of particles in the electrode.

5.3. Control of special morphologies
Normally, the rate capability of LiMn2O4 can be improved by scaling-down the size of the particles. However, the maximization of rate capability is always accompanied by a deterioration in the cycle life of LiMn2O4, especially at elevated temperatures. Hence, efforts have sought to achieve the optimization of rate capability and cyclability.250–252 K. M. Shaju et al.250 reported a stoichiometric nano-LiMn2O4 spinel prepared by a one-pot resorcinol–formaldehyde route. The nano-LiMn2O4 showed superior rate capability (retaining 85% of its capacity at 60 C) and capacity retention at both 30 °C and 55 °C (99.92% per cycle at C/2 rate) than its sol–gel LiMn2O4 counterpart, which was attributed to superior structural stability, lower Mn dissolution, and the relatively invariant AC impedance of nano-LiMn2O4 compared with sol–gel LiMn2O4. The Mn dissolution was declared to be largely dependent on the lattice orientation of the surface interfacing with the electrolytes.251 Unfortunately, the {110} surfaces whose orientations were aligned to the Li diffusion channels were found to be significantly vulnerable to Mn dissolution. In order to address the two incompatible aspects of LiMn2O4, J. S. Kim et al.251 developed a truncated octahedral crystal structure (Fig. 32a and d), where most of the surfaces are aligned to the crystal orientations experiencing minimal Mn dissolution, while a small portion of surfaces are truncated along the directions that support Li diffusion and therefore its intrinsic rate capability. As expected, the truncated octahedral spinel (OhT) electrode exhibited remarkable rate performance at room temperature such that when the C rate increased from 0.1 to 100 C, the half-cell still retained 81.1% of the original capacity (116 mA h g−1), better than those of its counterparts (bare octahedron (Oh) and platelet (PL) structured electrodes) (Fig. 32e). Subsequently, it was shown that at 55 °C, OhT and Oh electrodes retained 71.3% and 71.2% of the initial capacities (113.6 and 102.4 mA h g−1) after 400 cycles when cycled at 1 C for charge and 10 C for discharge, whereas the PL electrode lost its capacity very rapidly as it showed only 39.1 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles. This was ascribed to the stabilized SEI and the atomic arrangement of Mn by the truncated octahedral crystal structure. Recently, S. Jayaraman et al.252 investigated the lithium storage performance of porous LiMn2O4 hollow nanofibers synthesized by electrospinning technique. The obtained sample could retain 87% of its initial reversible capacity after 1250 cycles in half cells at 1 C at room temperature. Furthermore, half cells with the obtained samples also maintained 80.2% capacity retention at elevated temperatures (55 °C). The superior lithium storage performances were mainly attributed to the one dimensional robust hollow structure (facilitating faster Li+ diffusion and maintaining its morphology) and excellent stoichiometry. In summary, these new strategies can act as possible supplements or remedies to the aforementioned strategies for optimizing high temperature performances of LiMn2O4-based batteries.

6. Conclusions and perspectives
In this review, the different proposed possible deterioration mechanisms of LiMn2O4-based batteries are described in detail. Despite the fact that some of the fading mechanisms are controversial, the various strategies reported, including electrolyte optimization, element doping, surface coating, development of functional separators/gel electrolytes and binders, control of special morphologies, etc. are universally accepted to result in the enhancement of cyclability and thermostability of LiMn2O4-based batteries at elevated temperatures. In the following paragraphs, several conclusions and perspectives are made based on the progress described and our own experimental evaluations, aiming to provide some possible attractive strategies and research directions for the future enhancement of LiMn2O4-based batteries with improved high temperature performance:
(1) Much effort has been directed at remedying a series of problems (such as HF attack on both anode and cathode surfaces, Mn dissolution/migration/deposition, etc.) initially induced by thermal decomposition of LiPF6-based carbonate electrolytes. Often, the remedy is effective, but it is not the ideal solution. Therefore, the development of new lithium salts with high thermostability (such as LiBOB, PLTB, etc.), new gel electrolytes (such as solvent swollen PFSA-Li and PLTB@PVDF-HFP, etc.), and organic/inorganic solid electrolytes may become attractive directions in the future.
(2) In view of spinel materials, the core issue should be the close combination of doping and coating. Clarification of the interrelated effects due to efficient doping, fine coating, and controllable morphology tuning technology is required to further improve the high temperature performance of LiMn2O4-based batteries. Therefore, the combination of element doping and surface coating may be a reasonable and wise choice for solving the dilemma between improving both specific energy density and cycle performance.
(3) It is noted that, sometimes, a single strategy cannot efficiently solve the problem of fast capacity fading of LiMn2O4-based batteries, especially at elevated temperatures. Obviously, the elaborated strategies are not independent of each other, and accordingly, it is concluded that the combination of several different strategies with synergetic effects is required to ensure the cyclability and thermostability of LiMn2O4-based batteries at elevated temperatures. In other words, the combination of more thorough basic and applied research, and the establishment of the influencing factors of all the battery component materials (not just focusing on the LiMn2O4 material) may greatly facilitate not only the evolution of LiMn2O4-based batteries, but also LIBs in general.
(4) While most of the proposed and optimized strategies can be effective in small-scale (coin-type) half cells or full cells, they also need to be evaluated in large-scale commercial full cells for long-term consideration.
