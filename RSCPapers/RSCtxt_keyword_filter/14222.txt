    , Accepted 3rd February 2016First published on 4th February 2016AbstractHighly efficient and air-stable inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs) were fabricated from solution-processed non-conjugated polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) as the polyelectrolyte, a zinc oxide (ZnO) bilayer as the electron transport layer, and an active layer of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). When compared to conventional ZnO thin film devices, the incorporation of ZnO with nano-ridge structures (ZnO-R) and large interfacial areas, in addition to low leakage currents, led to an enhancement in power conversion efficiency from 7.41% to 8.38%. Furthermore, the presence of a thin PEIE layer between ITO and ZnO-R not only suppressed the formation of an oxygen deficient state at the ZnO-R surface, but also improved charge carrier mobilities and prevented leakage currents. Consequently, a maximum (average) efficiency of 8.91% (8.86%) and superior air stability with approximately 65% of the initial efficiency being retained after 326 days of storage under ambient atmosphere were achieved.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have been extensively studied over the past several years due to their beneficial properties, including low cost, large area, solution processability, semi-transparency, and mechanical flexibility. Recently, efforts have been made to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs through the use of low bandgap polymers, with PCEs greater than 10% being achieved as a result of an increased absorption of the solar spectrum.1,2 Inverted-type OSCs (IOSCs) have attracted significant attention since the utilization of metal oxides3–6 (ZnO, TiOx, Cs2CO3, and ZrAcac) and high work function metals (Ag or Au) as anodes has led to an improvement in air stability over conventionally structured devices. Most common metal oxides, particularly sol–gel-derived ZnO, have been used as the electron transporting layer (ETL) in IOSCs due to their high transparency, high electron affinity, and tunable electrical/optical properties.3
Despite the advantages of IOSCs using ZnO thin films (ZnO-TF) as the ETL, these devices suffer from low PCEs due to limitations with regard to their interfacial area,4 the presence of traps/defects due to adsorbed oxygen, and large energy barriers in contact with the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor.5 In prior studies, ZnO with nano-ridged structures (ZnO-R) was annealed at 275 °C and utilized in IOSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). The resulting devices exhibited higher PCEs due to the large interfacial area of ZnO-R compared to that of ZnO-TF.4 Furthermore, slower heating processes provided sufficient time for the gel film to relax prior to crystallization, promoting the formation of dense ZnO films with fewer structural defects. In another study, Richardson et al. reported that dynamically baked ZnO-R films based on the BHJ structure of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) under slow drying conditions could result in more densely packed ZnO films, further supported by higher refractive index values over those of TF.6
Recently, organic non-conjugated and conjugated polyelectrolyte-containing simple aliphatic amine groups such as polyethylenimine (PEI),7 polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE),8,9 and [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)10,11 have been employed to interfacially engineer ZnO layers. The incorporation of such materials not only led to an energy barrier reduction due to the formation of a thin interfacial dipole between the ETL and LUMO of the acceptor, but also facilitated efficient electron transport, suppressing trap-assisted recombination. When compared to PFN, PEIE was more cost-effective and was easily spin-cast under ambient atmosphere at low temperatures.8,12,13 While the use of PEIE-modified ZnO layers yielded significant enhancement to device performance, the exact role of PEIE as the ETL has not yet been determined. In this study, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photo-induced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurements were utilized to investigate both surface chemical states of the ETL layer and charge recombination processes.
Herein, highly efficient and air-stable IOSCs consisting of low-temperature solution-processed bilayers of PEIE/ZnO-R as the ETL and a low bandgap polymer blend of PTB7 and PC71BM as the active layer were fabricated. IOSCs with a PEIE/ZnO-R layer exhibited short-circuit current densities (Jsc) of 16.98 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 70.78%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.86%, all of which were higher than the values obtained for ZnO-TF (Jsc = 16.26 mA cm−2, FF = 63.31%, and PCE = 7.41%) and PEIE films (Jsc = 16.88 mA cm−2, FF = 63.86% and PCE = 7.99%). Moreover, devices with PEIE/ZnO-R layers exhibited superior air stability under ambient atmosphere when compared to PEIE-based cells, with approximately 64% retention of their original efficiency after 326 days (PEIE device: ∼10% retention of original PCE).
Experimental
ZnO-TF and ZnO-R film fabrication
A ZnO precursor was first prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Aldrich, 99.9%, 1.64 g) and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99.5%, 0.5 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, Aldrich, 99.8%, 10 g)14 while vigorously stirring for 30 min without heat to yield a homogeneously transparent solution. This solution was stable for more than 2 weeks. Indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω square−1 were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone and ethanol, boiled in isopropanol, and subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min. The ZnO precursor was then filtered with a 0.25 μm polypropylene (PP) filter and spin-coated onto substrates at a speed of 5000 rpm for 40 s. For the ZnO-TF layer in the reference device, the annealing temperature was held constant at 200 °C.6,7 In contrast, the ZnO-R layer was dynamically heated to 150 °C with a ramp rate of about 50 °C min−1 for 20 min under ambient air. The average ZnO-TF and ZnO-R layer thicknesses, as measured with a surface profiler (KLA Tencor, P-10 model), were approximately 14 nm and 20 nm, respectively.
PEIE interlayer fabrication
Polyethylenimine, 80% ethoxylated (PEIE, Mw = ∼70000 g mol−1, Aldrich) was dissolved in H2O to a concentration of 35–40 wt%. 2-Methoxyethanol was then added such that the concentration of PEIE was reduced to 0.2 wt%. The solution was spin coated onto substrates at a speed of 5000 rpm and annealed at 110 °C for 10 min on a hotplate in ambient air. The PEIE layer thickness on ITO or ZnO-R was 5 nm, while the ZnO-R layer deposited onto PEIE at a speed of 5000 rpm had a thickness of 30 nm.
Solar cell fabrication
IOSCs were fabricated using PTB7 (1-material) as an electron donor and PC71BM (Nano-C) as an electron acceptor. Mixed solutions of PTB7 and PC71BM (1:1.5) in chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (97:3 by volume) were stirred at 60 °C overnight. The active layer was deposited onto the ETL-coated ITO electrode via spin-coating at 1000 rpm after being filtered through a 0.20 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter; the active layer thickness was approximately 90 nm. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) diluted with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) at a PEDOT-PSS:IPA ratio of 1:10, was deposited onto the active layer at 5000 rpm to obtain an approximately 10 nm thick film. Devices were subsequently transferred to a vacuum chamber without further annealing. Finally, Ag as a top electrode was deposited through a shadow mask at a rate of 0.2 nm s−1via thermal evaporation under vacuum with a pressure of about 10−6 Torr. The device area, as defined by the shadow mask, was 11.25 mm2.
Characterization of materials and photovoltaic devices
In order to determine the chemical state, empirical formula, and elemental composition of the intrinsic impurities in the samples, XPS spectra were acquired with a Thermo Scientific (ESCALAB 250Xi) system using monochromatic Al Kα X-ray excitation (72 W); the base pressure within the XPS chamber was 1 × 10−9 Torr. The binding energy value for all spectra was calibrated using the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) as a reference. An analysis of the obtained XPS data was performed via the CasaXPS software. The surface morphology of the samples was characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM topography images (10 × 10 μm2) were obtained using a Park systems NX-10 microscope in semi-contact mode. The sheet resistance and absorption spectra of the samples were measured with a four-point probe apparatus (Mitsubishi Chemical Analytech, MCP-T610) and UV-vis spectrophotometer (Jasco, V-670), respectively. Reflectance spectra were measured via UV-visible spectrophotometry (Varian, Cary 5000), while the photoluminescence (PL) was evaluated using a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 580 nm. The IOSC performance was measured under simulated AM 1.5 illumination with an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel Sol 1A, Newport); the irradiance was calibrated using a standard Si photodiode detector fitted with a KG5 filter. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. In order to accurately define the active area, a shadow mask with an exposed area of 11.25 mm2 was employed for the J–V measurements. A quantum efficiency measurement system (Oriel IQE-200) was used to determine the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra consisting of a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) lamp as the light source, a monochromator, an optical chopper, a lock-in amplifier, and a calibrated silicon photodetector. To determine the charge carrier mobility and photo-generated carrier concentration, the photo-CELIV technique was utilized.15 The experimental photo-CELIV setup consisted of a diode-pumped solid-state laser (CNI laser, MBL-FN-473), a function generator (Tektronix, AFG3022C), and an oscilloscope (Budget, 300 MHz with 50 Ω input). The laser, which featured a 473 nm wavelength, was used as the excitation source with a pulse energy of less than 0.05 μJ cm−2 and a pulse width of about 20 μs. Adjustments to the laser pulse were carried out with the function generator (the so-called microsecond photo-CELIV method). Laser power was measured using an optical power meter (Newport model 1835C), and both the voltage ramp (triangular voltage) and delay time (tdelay) between the laser off state and voltage ramp were easily synchronized to the CH1 and CH2 outputs, respectively, using a trigger-delay within the function generator. The input waveform for the photo-CELIV measurements can be seen in Fig. S5.† Photo-CELIV signals were recorded with a storage oscilloscope (50 Ω load resistance); the delay time was fixed to be approximately 1 μs for all devices. An offset voltage of 0.65 V was applied to all measurements to compensate for an internal electric field close to the Voc value of each device.16 This allowed for open circuit conditions to be maintained and ensured minimal charge extraction or injection. The voltage slope was varied from 70 to 120 V ms−1 (pulse width of 20 μs) for all devices.
Results and discussion
Surface analysis
The surface elemental composition for different device configurations was investigated via XPS. Fig. 1a–c depicts the narrow scan of Zn 2p, O 1s, and N 1s core level spectra, respectively; the corresponding survey scans are displayed in Fig. S1.† The Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 peaks of the ZnO-TF and ZnO-R layers were located at binding energies of about 1021 and 1044 eV, respectively; which were attributed to Zn–O bonding with Zn in the 2+ oxidation state.17 A positive shift in the binding energy by about 0.25 eV was observed for the Zn 2p3/2 peak when PEIE was introduced between the ITO and the ZnO-R layer. Such finding could be attributed to the surface band bending of ZnO-R and could be related to the incorporation or doping of N ions into ZnO.18 In contrast, the Zn 2p3/2 peak of ZnO-R/PEIE exhibited a 0.5 eV shift toward a lower binding energy when compared to those of the ZnO-TF and ZnO-R samples, indicating a loss of Zn metal due to the greater bonding of Zn to O and changes in the electronic structure of ZnO.19

The asymmetric O 1s peak detected from the surface of the samples was coherently fitted with two Gaussian components centered at around 529.7 eV (OL) and 531.4 eV (OH), as shown in Fig. 1b. The peak with a lower binding energy (OL) corresponded to O2− ions in the wurtzite structure of a hexagonal Zn2+ ion array,12 while the higher binding energy (OH) component of the O 1s peak was associated with both O2− ions situated within the oxygen-deficient regions of the ZnO matrix and due to the presence of OH (hydroxyl) bonds.20,21 Similar to the Zn 2p results, the binding energy of the O 1s peak for PEIE/ZnO-R increased slightly. In order to determine the stoichiometry of O:Zn from the XPS spectra, the integrated peak areas and elemental sensitivity factors for each O and Zn peak were calculated based on a previously reported procedure.22 Overall, the O:Zn ratio for all samples was less than 1 due to the presence of oxygen vacancies and interstitial Zn within ZnO.22 The ratio of oxygen defects to the total area of the OL and OH peaks was calculated, the results of which can be seen in Fig. S2.† The ZnO-TF exhibited a lower OH/Ototal ratio when compared to ZnO-R films. However, the OH/Ototal ratio for the PEIE/ZnO-R film was similar to that of ZnO-TF, indicating that the PEIE layer between ITO and ZnO-R could suppress oxygen deficiencies or oxygen vacancy formation at the surface of ZnO-R. During the formation of ZnO-R films by slow heating, in which films were structurally relaxed prior to crystallization, thereby, providing sufficient time for PEIE to interact with the upper layer of ZnO. Since the atomic radius and electronegativity of N were almost similar to O,23 there was a probability that N atoms of PEIE could occupy the vacancy sites within the ZnO host matrix, thus leading to a decreasing OH and OL ratio (Fig. S2†). However, the reason why elemental N was not detected within PEIE/ZnO-R films could be due to the detection limits of the XPS measurement, suggesting that only a relatively low quantity of N was incorporated into ZnO-R. On the other hand, the spin-coated PEIE layer on top of ZnO-R displayed the highest OH/Ototal ratio. The origin of the increase in OH was likely due to the presence of OH groups from the side-chains of PEIE.
For the film composed solely of PEIE, the asymmetric N 1s peak was deconvoluted into two different regions through Gaussian fitting, as shown in Fig. 1c. The results suggested the presence of a PEIE layer on the surface of the ITO and ZnO-R layer. The low and high binding energies centered at around 398.35 eV and 399.7 eV, respectively, were associated with protonated and non-protonated amines.24 Furthermore, the low and high binding energy components of the N 1s peak for the PEIE film could be assigned to N–Zn and N–C bonds, respectively.25 In contrast, there were no observable N 1s peaks at the surface of the ZnO-R and PEIE/ZnO-R films, as shown in Fig. 1c. These results suggested that the amine groups from ethanolamine might decompose completely during dynamic annealing of the ZnO-R films. Interestingly, no additional peaks from protonated amines were observed for the ZnO-R/PEIE sample, as the N 1s signal was symmetrical. From prior research, it was known that PEIE could reduce the work function of ZnO due to the presence of interfacial dipoles caused by protonated amines (N+).26 The obtained results implied that changes in the electrostatic dipoles at the ZnO-R surface were negligible when compared to those reported in prior studies.26 Moreover, the reduction in the binding energy of the Zn 2p peak (by ∼0.5 eV) and increase in the binding energy of the N 1s peak (by ∼0.32 eV) could indicate stronger interactions for N–Zn bonds.30
Optical analysis
The absorption spectra of PTB7:PC71BM spin-cast onto ZnO-TF, ZnO-R, and different PEIE interlayer configurations can be seen in Fig. 2a. PTB7 exhibited the strongest absorption between the range of 550 and 750 nm,27 whereas PCBM, PEIE, and ZnO contributed to absorptions below 550 nm. When compared to ZnO-TF, the absorption of other samples increased slightly within the visible region. PL measurements were conducted in order to investigate the charge transfer dynamics and determine whether changes in PL intensity could provide additional evidence for exciton recombination. PL quenching could originate from two different processes in which photogenerated excitons would be separated at the PTB7 and PC71BM interface, in addition to the ZnO/PTB7 interfaces. Fig. 2b presents the PL spectra of PTB7:PC71BM with an excitation wavelength of about 580 nm. When the active layer was spin-coated onto the ZnO-TF and PEIE layers, the intensity of the PL peak decreased due to charge separation at the interface between the active and ETL layers. Further PL quenching was observed for the ZnO-R, PEIE/ZnO-R, and ZnO-R/PEIE samples due to more efficient exciton dissociation. The higher RMS roughness of ZnO-R when compared to those of the ZnO-TF and PEIE layers also provided a larger interfacial area for exciton dissociation as shown in Fig. S3.† However, the insertion of an additional PEIE layer onto ZnO-R did not change the PL intensity since the RMS roughness was similar to that of the ZnO-R film. Similarly, the PEIE layer underneath ZnO-TF and on top of ZnO-TF did not affect the PL intensity as observed in Fig. S4.†

Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic properties were investigated with a device structure of ITO/ETL/PTB7:PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. The J–V characteristics and corresponding IPCE curves of the IOSCs under AM 1.5G illumination with an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 are displayed in Fig. 3, while the extracted photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table 1. For the reference devices with ZnO-TF as the ETL, the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE values were 0.72 V, 16.26 mA cm−2, 63.31%, and 7.41%, respectively. Solar cell performance improved considerably for devices with ZnO-R due to enhancements in the Voc, Jsc, and FF. When compared to the reference device, an increase of over 13% was observed for the PCE (∼8.38%), for cells with a ZnO-R layer. Interestingly, the device efficiency with only PEIE (PCE ∼ 7.99%) was higher than that of the cell with ZnO-TF, which was in good agreement with previously reported results.13 Remarkably, a significant and positive effect of the PEIE/ZnO-R-based device is that the FF was simultaneously enhanced relative to cells based on ZnO-R, leading to maximum and average PCE values of 8.91 and 8.86%, respectively. Based on the data presented in Table 1, the Jsc value of both devices A (with ZnO-TF) and B (with ZnO-R) were essentially the same. However, it is important to note that ZnO-R demonstrated a greater quantity of oxygen deficiencies compared to ZnO-TF (shown in Fig. S2†), which may act as charge trapping sites at the ZnO surface, potentially leading to a smaller Jsc value for the ZnO-R device. Interestingly, we found that PL emission of ZnO-R/PTB7:PC71BM was significantly quenched, which may be attributed to efficient exciton dissociation due to the large interfacial areas of the nanoridges. Therefore, large interfacial areas play a dominant role toward compensating for the effect of oxygen defects within ZnO-R films, which may reduce the Jsc. Additionally, significant increases to the shunt resistance, which indicate low leakage currents within ZnO-R layer devices, also play a key role toward improving the FF and subsequently improving the PCE. To the best of our knowledge, the maximum efficiency reported in this study is one of the highest values reported for inverted IOSCs based on PTB7 with low-temperature processed ZnO layers (<150 °C) and an additional non-conjugated polyelectrolyte layer. Conversely, ZnO-R/PEIE-based devices exhibited low device performance with PCEs of 7.06%. Such low efficiencies are primarily due to a reduction in Jsc and FF values, contrasting with prior studies in which PEIE spin-coated onto ZnO enhanced PCEs.8,9,28

Estimated series (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) values were extracted from dark J–V curves (Fig. S5†); the results of which can be seen in Table 1. Similar FF values of devices A (with ZnO-TF) and C (with PEIE) may be attributed to a decrease in Rsh and an increase in Rs when compared to that of device B (with ZnO-R). The higher Jsc and FF of device D (with a PEIE/ZnO-R layer) could be correlated with improved charge transport properties and thick PEIE/ZnO-R layers (total thickness of ∼36 nm), as indicated by the significantly reduced Rs and improved Rsh values. These results suggested that an additional PEIE layer between ITO and ZnO could minimize direct contact with PTB7, which generated leakage currents due to incomplete coverage.29 Furthermore, the higher Rs and lower Rsh of device E (with a ZnO-R/PEIE layer) may be due to the PEIE layer hindering electron transport from the active layer to ITO (insulating effect), leading to a reduction in the Jsc and FF. A comparison of the IPCE spectra of inverted IOSCs with various ETL configurations is presented in Fig. 3b. Similar to the observed Jsc trend, device D (with PEIE/ZnO-R) exhibited a substantially enhanced response from 475 nm to 700 nm when compared to device E (with PEIE). The Jsc increase in device B (with ZnO-R) with respect to device A (with ZnO-TF) may be attributed to a greater interfacial area, playing an important role in obtaining high photocurrents.
Reflectance analysis
In order to further examine the effect of an additional PEIE layer toward improving the Jsc, reflectance measurements were performed with total absorption for devices with an active layer; the results of which are presented in Fig. 4a. A device with an active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) was used as a reference; the geometry of this cell can be found in the inset of Fig. 4a. While the reflectance spectra of the reference sample and the device with PEIE were indistinguishable (Fig. S6†), those obtained for devices with an ETL of ZnO-TF, ZnO-R, PEIE/ZnO-R, or ZnO-R/PEIE films were different. To investigate the variation in light absorption for different ETLs, absorption changes (Δα) from the reflectance measurements were calculated based on an equation expressed in a prior report;30 the results of which can be seen in Fig. 4b. The Δα demonstrates significant decreases at the range of the UV-region (360–450 nm) for the device with ZnO and a bilayer structure as compared with device C (PEIE-only). This finding indicates that device C exhibits better light absorption particularly in the UV-region, as a result, it is expected that IPCE (Fig. 3b) could achieve a higher value at the UV range than the other devices. In addition, the PEIE-only device exhibited negligible changes in light absorption when compared to the reference device without an ETL. From the marginally different or identical changes in the absorption spectra for ZnO-R, PEIE/ZnO-R, and ZnO-R/PEIE in Fig. 4b, it could be concluded that absorption, attenuation effects, and PL quenching had a negligible impact toward enhancing the Jsc in device D (with a PEIE/ZnO-R layer). Consequently, a photo-CELIV technique was employed to elucidate the intrinsic mechanism behind the performance improvement.

Photo-CELIV analysis
Photo-CELIV measurements were used to simultaneously determine the charge carrier mobility (μ) and photo-generated carrier concentration (n) within the devices. Fig. 5a and b show semi-log plots of the extracted μ and n values, respectively, as a function of electric field from Fig. S7.† Variations in the values of μ with an increase in the electric field could be attributed to two possible causes: disordered organic semiconductor behavior15 and negative field dependence reportedly based on the material characteristics of a low bandgap polymer blend system with a high degree of spatial disorder.31 The extracted μ values of devices B (with ZnO-R) and C (with PEIE) were slightly higher than those of device A (with ZnO-TF), while a greater than two-fold enhancement in μ was observed for device D (with PEIE/ZnO-R). For devices B (with ZnO-R) and D (with PEIE/ZnO-R), the μ values were 4.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, at E1/2 of 146 and 128 V1/2 cm−1/2. Furthermore, devices E (with PEIE) and B exhibited similar μ values. As shown in Table 1, the trends in μ were consistent with those observed for Jsc (i.e., devices with a higher μ exhibited a larger Jsc). The μ value of device B (with ZnO-R) was close to the reported mobility value of 5.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a PTB7:PC71BM device.32 A comparison of n for all devices can be seen within the semi-log plot of Fig. 5b; all n values were in the range of 1015 to 1017 cm−3 and highly dependent on the electric field. The range of the n values in this study was similar to those obtained experimentally for a PTB7:PC71BM device.33 Despite the similarities in the mobilities of devices B (with ZnO-R) and E (with PEIE), the n value of device E was slightly less than that of device B. This result may be related to the hydroxyl groups of PEIE facilitating charge trapping at the ZnO surface (as previously described in the XPS analysis), thereby leading to interfacial recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, the transport of photogenerated charge carriers to their corresponding electrodes is inhibited. Overall, device D (with PEIE/ZnO-R) exhibited high values of n and μ when compared to devices A, B, and C. The enhancement in Jsc and μ with an additional PEIE layer between ITO and ZnO-R appeared to be due to a mechanism that was different from that associated with device E (with ZnO-R/PEIE), in which the formation of hydroxyl groups on PEIE may be suppressed by dynamically annealing ZnO at 150 °C.

Stability performance
In order to gain more insight into device stability, solar cell tests were performed under continuous illumination with an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 for up to 1000 s and storage lifetimes up to 326 days without encapsulation under dark ambient atmosphere (RH ∼ 50%). Fig. 6a–d displays the individual Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE parameters, respectively, as a function of light soaking. As shown in Fig. 6a, the Voc rates of decrease for all devices were similar, approximately 6% based on the initial values. Interestingly, the Jsc and FF for devices B (with ZnO-R) and D (with PEIE/ZnO-R) were stable up to 1000 s, as displayed in Fig. 6b and c.

While the Jsc values of devices C (with PEIE) and E (with ZnO-R/PEIE) were stable as a function of exposure time, the FF decreased. Photo-CELIV measurements were also investigated as a function of light soaking time; the extracted μ values based on Fig. S8† can be seen in Fig. 6e. The trends in μ further supported the Jsc findings, indicating that surface defects did not play an important role toward affecting the dependence toward light soaking. As demonstrated in Fig. 6f, about 80% of the initial device efficiency was retained after around 30 days storage, which was in good agreement with a prior report for a PEIE/P3HT:PCBM device.28 However, after 326 days, the performance of device C (with PEIE) was very poor, with efficiencies falling to around 9% of its initially reported values. On the other hand, device D (with PEIE/ZnO-R) featured much greater stability than devices B (with ZnO-R) and E (with ZnO-R/PEIE), retaining approximately 65% of its initial efficiency after 326 days. When compared with all the other tested solar cells, these results suggested that devices with PEIE/ZnO-R featured superior long-term air-stability without encapsulation, due to the suppression of oxygen-deficient states. Conversely, the rapid degradation observed in devices B (with ZnO-R) and E (with ZnO-R/PEIE) correlated with the presence of OH groups on the surface of ZnO-R and PEIE, respectively. Similarly, the rapid performance degradation of device C (with PEIE) under ambient air could be attributed to the polymer side-chains consisting of –OH groups, which may induce oxygen-trapping states and hinder electron extraction to the corresponding electrodes. This in turn induced the formation of trapping sites for recombination, which was supported by the XPS data and low carrier mobility values. These results contrasted with the findings of a prior report, where longer stability lifetimes were attributed to surface passivation of ZnO.28
Conclusions
In summary, a PEIE/ZnO-R bilayer was successfully utilized as an efficient ETL for enhancing the PCE of IOSCs prepared from low-temperature (≤150 °C) solution-based processes. The improvement in the photovoltaic performance of ZnO-R-based devices when compared to that of ZnO-TF-based devices was mainly due to larger interfacial areas, efficient exciton dissociation, and low leakage currents. Furthermore, by inserting a PEIE layer between ITO and ZnO-R, the Jsc and FF values of the IOSCs improved significantly. This performance enhancement was attributed to the suppression of oxygen deficient states within ZnO-R, high charge carrier mobilities, and higher photo-generated charge carrier concentrations, as supported by XPS and photo-CELIV measurements. As a result, the maximum (average) efficiency of the IOSCs with a PEIE/ZnO-R bilayer increased to 8.91% (8.86%) from a value of 7.57% (7.41%) obtained for devices with ZnO-TF. In addition, the photovoltaic performance behavior in this study is different compared with previously reported bilayer PEIE and ZnO,9,28 which can be attributed to the different fabrication conditions. The IOSC with PEIE/ZnO-R was nearly stable up to a light soaking duration of 1000 seconds under continuous illumination, with 65% of the initial PCE being retained for the device after ambient storage for 326 days.
