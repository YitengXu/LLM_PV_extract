    , Accepted 14th March 2023First published on 15th March 2023AbstractA photovoltaic–hydrovoltaic-coupled carbon-based, all-inorganic Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 perovskite solar cell achieved a peak power conversion efficiency of 9.40% under one sun illumination and a maximum voltage of 0.39 V and current of 1.40 μA in a flowing vapor atmosphere.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable interest owing to their advantages including high absorption coefficients, low binding energy levels, long carrier diffusion lengths,1,2 and therefore a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 25.7%. However, their intrinsic instability in high humidity, oxygen, thermal, or ultraviolet light conditions is an burden for their future commercialization.3 Their durability is significantly improved by substituting the organic counterparts with inorganic Cs+ ions to make all-inorganic PSCs, especially for inorganic CsPbBr3 solar cells.4 Unfortunately, the PCEs of the state-of-the-art inorganic PSCs are still very low, due to the large optical band gap of CsPbBr3 halide (2.32 eV). To meet the specific application demands, it is necessary to carry out the challenging development of high-efficiency CsPbBr3 PSCs and enhancement of the total power generation.
Water evaporation is a persistent phenomenon in nature, and large amounts of energy are released in this process. Steam energy had never been considered as a form of renewable energy—until the development of advanced materials and techniques.5 Since the 1960s, the flowing potential phenomenon has been developed based on electrical double-layer (EDL) effects at fluid-micro/nanochannel interfaces.6 Using this mechanism, many types of energy devices operating under an external pressure or concentration gradient for driving fluids have been developed.7,8 A recent report from the Guo group described the demonstration of a streaming potential achieved by immersing a layer of flame-deposited carbon black (CB) into water and then withdrawing it from the water.9 The water evaporation from the CB channels under ambient conditions produced the streaming potential, and the final voltage output was as high as 1 V. However, three problems remain using this otherwise engaging technique: the fragile behavior of a flaming CB film and its weak adhesion to substrates,10 leading to destruction of the film during vapor flow processes; the inapplicability of this method to forming films on a large scale; and the ongoing inability to harvest steam energy from water evaporation due to the absence of immersion and withdrawal processes in real-world conditions.
When solar panels in a power station are aligned, the inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC on the front side absorbs solar energy, and the water evaporates on the back side. A remaining issue involves figuring out how to combine the solar energy and steam energy in a single solar cell. To address this issue, we developed here a carbon-based, all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSC by coupling photovoltaic with hydrovoltaic effects,11 where a nanochannelled carbon layer was made as a back electrode in the PSC with an FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3/carbon device architecture. Apart from photovoltaic performances, the levels of dependence of voltage and current outputs on plasma-processing time, relative humidity, and vapor velocity were systematically investigated by humidifying the carbon electrode. The obtained optimal device achieved a PCE as high as 9.40% under one sun irradiation, and a maximum voltage of 0.39 V and a current of 1.40 μA by flowing vapor and showed excellent long-term stability. This physical proof-of-concept of making perovskite and moisture “friends” has provided new opportunities for maximizing overall power output.
One of the superiorities of all-inorganic PSCs with a nanochannelled carbon electrode is their ability to simultaneously convert solar energy and vapor energy into electricity for maximizing power generation. All-inorganic PSCs with a preferred architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPbBr3/carbon have been reported to present high PCEs and excellent stability in high-humidity environments, even up to 90% RH.4 In comparison with state-of-the-art hybrid PSCs or inorganic solar cells with CsPbI3−xBrx halide as light harvesters, the efficiencies of pristine CsPbBr3 PSCs are still sluggish owing to limitations imposed by their structure. In our current work, we conducted compositional engineering by doping rubidium ions (Rb+) into CsPbBr3 halide perovskite (Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3) to optimize the crystal lattice; moreover, the carbon electrode was also optimized to increase the electrical outputs in the flowing steam.
As shown in Fig. 1a, the developed carbon-based, all-inorganic Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 solar cell showed a significantly enhanced overall PCE, with a peak value of 9.40% under one sun illumination with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.34 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.496 V and a fill factor (FF) of 85.6%. Note the much higher value of this PCE than that (7.46%) of the control device. The dramatically improved photovoltaic performance was due to lattice contraction and significantly reduced non-radiative losses12 (Fig. S1, ESI†), discussed below. Noting the smaller ionic radius of Rb+ than of Cs+, the incorporation of the smaller ion has been previously demonstrated to increase the interaction of the A-site with Br− ions and to lead to a decrease in the BX6 octahedral volume as well as the formation energy.13 An IPCE spectroscopy analysis, shown in Fig. 1b, demonstrated a narrow range of wavelengths of light absorbed, from 300 to 540 nm, for both devices; it also demonstrated the maximum IPCE value having increased from 83% when using CsPbBr3 to 92% when using Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 halide, attributed to a modulation of the lattice upon introducing Rb+ ions into the CsPbBr3 perovskite film.13 The integrated Jsc values were determined from the IPCE spectra to be 6.78 and 7.30 mA cm−2 for the pristine and doped devices, respectively, in accordance with the J–V results. As shown in Fig. 1c, a steady power output was observed, consistent with the performance enhancement realized by doping the foreign ions to tune perovskite crystals. More importantly, while the incompatibility of moisture and perovskite is a great challenge for the currently available state-of-the-art PSCs, a feature in the design of the carbon-electrode, all-inorganic Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 PSCs was to make them “friends” instead of “enemies”. Upon persistent “attack” by 80% RH in air at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 1d, the optimal solar cell still retained 90% of its initial efficiency over 60 days, mainly arising from a stable all-brominated inorganic perovskite crystal phase and the protection from hydrophobic carbon surfaces. This method, however, may not be applicable to organic–inorganic hybrids or other all-iodide PSCs, which require an advanced encapsulation technology for long-term stability.

Solar energy was converted into electricity under sunlight according to the photoelectric conversion principle, while steam energy was harvested by this bifunctional CsPbBr3 PSC according to the hydrovoltaic effect. Therefore, the coupling of photovoltaic and hydrovoltaic effects for a physical proof-of-concept hybrid solar cell was expected to be a promising way to maximize energy conversion.14Fig. 2a illustrates the photovoltaic “plants” made by setting an array of aligned CsPbBr3 PSCs.

The all-inorganic PSC was fabricated with the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3/carbon architecture by deploying a method involving successive spin-coatings. The hydrovoltaic and photovoltaic components shared the carbon electrode but functioned independently of each other. In theory, the perovskite absorbed photons and excited electrons to the conduction band from the valence band under solar irradiation. Subsequently, the electrons and holes were collected by the TiO2 layer and carbon electrode for producing a charge separation. Upon evaporation of water, the resulting vapor passed through a nanochannelled carbon electrode (Fig. 2a). Meanwhile, the negative zeta potential of the carbon layer repelled hydroxyl ions (OH−) and adsorbed protons (H+) to form electron (carbon)/proton (stream) EDL layers at the carbon (solid)/water (gas) interfaces.15 The streaming potential driven by flowing vapor under a pressure gradient contributed to voltage and current signals. The high concentration of charges at the top electrode and the low concentration of charges at the bottom electrode together produced the streaming potential for generating electricity.16 Therefore, the CB electrode was responsible for both extracting holes from the CsPbBr3 layer and converting steam energy into electricity.

Fig. 2b shows a top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the deployed nanochanelled carbon electrode. Inspection of this image indicated that the carbon film was made of particles with average dimensions of about 50 nm and interconnected channels for flowing vapor (Fig. S2, ESI†). The good uniformity of nanopore size (100 nm) and Debye length was indicated, a feature facilitating the gradient charge distribution and electricity generation.17
Upon persistent humidification with 80% RH at room temperature, horizontal baselines were produced for both voltage and current outputs when using an untreated electrode, as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The lack of electricity generation when flowing the water steam onto the pristine carbon was attributed to an absence of functional groups in the carbon layer. The plasma treatment, however, introduced many hydrophilic sites for increased vapor flow driven by water capillary action. Plasma-processing times from 1 to 3 minutes were tested, and a processing time of 2 minutes yielded the maximum voltage of 0.37 V, and a current of 1.24 μA. The initial electrical voltage was zero for anhydrous electrodes and increased to nearly the maximum level within tens of seconds, while the current required more time to reach equilibrium. This pre-wetting stage was for reaching capillary saturation and subsequently driving vapor uphill through the interconnected nanochannels. Hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups such as –COOH, CO, C–O–C, etc. were produced during the plasma treatment and enhanced electron depletion in the EDL (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†), while excessive oxidation of carbon for plasma processing carried out for more than 2 minutes destroyed the conjugated structure and electron migration.18 Based on the power generation principle in chemistry, the reduced electron concentration brought about a weak EDL, which decreased the electrical signal strength. The much higher current from this nanochannelled CB film was attributed to its superior conductivity compared to our previous result.11
The water vapor in a high-humidity environment has been demonstrated by Guo et al. to produce a high concentration of protons to form a high-capacitance EDL, stemming from enhanced voltage and current generation.8 Due to streaming water evaporation producing both voltage and current, humidity and vapor velocity would inevitably be expected to have significant impacts. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, both voltage and current were zero when the converter was placed in an environment with <40% RH, and interestingly, the voltage increased stepwise to 0.052, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.39 V by tuning the humidity to 51% RH, 64% RH, 75% RH and 82% RH, respectively. The current increased to 0.73, 1.13, 1.25 and 1.40 μA at an RH value of 53%, 61%, 73% and 80%, respectively. These results suggested that electrical signals originated from the vapor flow at equilibrium, and this state can be changed by adjusting the level of moisture in the vapor. Similarly, the carbon electrode yielded a voltage of 0.074 V and a current of 0.16 μA at a low vapor velocity of 4.0 m s−1, and the electrical outputs were further increased to 0.13 and 0.33 V along with 0.91 and 1.14 μA at vapor velocities of 5.5 and 7.0 m s−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. The results indicated that the vapor steam in conditions of high humidity and high flow velocity created high pressure and caused a large charge gradient.

(c) Voltage and (d) current evolutions of the tailored carbon-electrode, all-inorganic PSC for the indicated vapor velocities (ranging from 4.0 to 7.0 m s−1). The nanochannelled carbon electrode was plasma-treated for 2 minutes. 
By reversing the top and bottom electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4a, the voltage output became negative but the shape and intensity at the equilibrium state were nearly unchanged. This phenomenon has also been previously reported by other groups.10 When applied as fixed or portable sources in real conditions, bifunctional CsPbBr3 PSCs are always characterized by their cost-effectiveness, rapid start-up, and operational stability. In the current work, the flowing vapor had a streaming potential that was expected to be zero upon drying the device to 0% RH. Fig. 4b shows the results of using on–off switches made by alternating humidification and drying of the solar cell. An abrupt increase in voltage output was observed when humidifying the cell to 80% RH, which suggested a rapid start-up for the energy harvesting, and this point was considered the “on” state.19 In contrast, the observed rapid decrease in the voltage to zero by drying the cell to 0% RH meant that the device became closed, and it was in the “off” point. The multiple on–off switches refer to the good stability achieved when repeatedly performing multiple cycles of humidifying and drying. In our study, neither voltage nor current showed any obvious change, even over hundreds of cycles.

The experimental realization of a physical proof-of-concept of harvesting water steam energy by all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs has provided new opportunities for the use of waste energy.11 Converting vapor energy into electricity was estimated to cost about 0.1 $ per kW per h using the optimized device reported here, and ∼0.186, ∼0.152, 0.131–0.219, 0.075–0.175 and ∼0.5 $ per kW per h−1 using the state-of-the-art photovoltaic, solar thermal, bioenergy, nuclear20 and wave energy21 devices, respectively. Therefore, the incorporation of this nanochannelled CB layer into a perovskite solar cell can significantly reduce the production costs and enhance the total power output, demonstrating the great potential for applying it in electricity-generation devices.
Upon persistent humidification at 80% RH over several hours, the optimized CsPbBr3 PSC achieved a constant voltage of 0.4 V (Fig. 4c) and a current of 0.4–0.6 μA (Fig. 4d), realizing the ability of the CsPbBr3 perovskite to co-exist with humidity.22 In this work, we chose the inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite as a photo-absorber, with this perovskite regarded as the most stable halide perovskite.11,13 The inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite prepared using the muti-step spin-coating method was previously found to be relatively stable even in conditions of high humidity.11 Moreover, the solarcell can be well encapsulated by the hydrophobicity and compactness of the carbon electrode. In this fashion, the physical proof-of-concept multi-energy integrated solar cell with the above-mentioned functional carbon back-electrode and all-inorganic Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 PSC has been fabricated to simultaneously harvest solar energy and water steam energy.
In summary, a physical proof-of-concept carbon-based, all-inorganic Cs0.91Rb0.09PbBr3 PSC has been successfully fabricated by coupling photovoltaic and hydrovoltaic effects. Because of the increase in perovskite film quality accomplished by doping Rb+ into a CsPbBr3 perovskite film, the best inorganic PSC achieved a peak PCE of 9.40% under one sun illumination and remained 90% efficient after 60 days in 80% RH storage. When stimulated by flowing vapor, both voltage and current outputs were found to have a positive dependence on humidity and vapor velocity, giving a maximum voltage of 0.39 V and a maximum current of 1.40 μA. This design was shown to make moisture and perovskite “friends” in a single PSC and can extend applications for harvesting solar energy and water steam energy to meet application-specific demands.
