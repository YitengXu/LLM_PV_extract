    , Accepted 19th September 2016First published on 19th September 2016AbstractHybrid solar cells, based on combinations of organic and inorganic semiconductors, constitute a promising avenue to harness solar energy by taking advantage of the strengths of both organic and inorganic materials. In this work, we report the first high-efficiency hybrid solar cell of its type comprising p-type silicon with an organic n-type C60 layer. High efficiencies based on the Si/C60 heterojunction were realized by utilizing an ultra-thin, doped and highly conductive C60 layer. Fabrication parameters were thoroughly investigated and critical factors for the efficient operation of this type of device were found to include the C60 thickness, doping of the C60 layer (using tetrabutyl ammonium iodide, TBAI), age-induced surface passivation and the incorporation of anti-reflection coatings (ARCs). From current density–voltage (J–V) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics, we have characterized the influence of C60 doping and device aging on the depletion region width and electrical parameters. An optimal power conversion efficiency of 8.43% was realized after 4 days of aging and TBAI treatment, with the application of a quarter-wave Sb2O3 ARC.
Introduction
In recent years, hybrid solar cells consisting of organic and inorganic semiconductors have attracted significant research interest,1–7 as they promise to merge the advantages of organic and inorganic materials. For instance, inorganic materials have good charge carrier mobilities and low exciton binding energies, while organic materials are low cost and easy to process. A number of innovative solar technologies have been introduced over the past several decades including inorganic materials such as GaAs, CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and hybrid materials such as PbS quantum dots, dye-sensitized TiO2 and methylammonium lead halide perovskites, as well as a wide range of organic semiconductors.8–11 Despite a tremendous amount of research effort and an impressive increase in the efficiencies of all of these new technologies, the vast majority of commercially produced solar cells are still based on the same material that was used to produce the first commercially manufactured solar cells, silicon (Si). Despite the disadvantages of Si, such as an indirect band gap with weak light absorption, a non-optimal band gap energy, extreme processing temperature of over 1400 °C and a high sensitivity to impurities, it is nonetheless used in over 90% of solar cells produced globally. Thus, hybrid Si/organic device structures which are able to reduce the cost or complexity of Si solar cell manufacture are of considerable interest.
The processing of Si solar cell devices can be significantly simplified by creating a hybrid junction between a Si film and an easily processed organic semiconductor layer to create a p–n heterojunction, thus avoiding the need for the high-temperature, inert-atmosphere process of diffusing reactive dopants into the Si crystal structure to create a p–n homojunction. Various promising hybrid solar cells have been studied based on this type of architecture, including devices which utilize Si in conjunction with conjugated polymers. In particular, the conductive polymers poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), and other polymers have been extensively studied as junctions with n-type Si.12–18 Over the past few years, multiple studies such as Si texturing4,19 and interface passivation20,21 have led to notable improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 15.5%.22
Although most reports on hybrid Si heterojunctions have used n-type Si, the alternative model, consisting of p-type Si topped with easily processed n-type organic materials, offers a key advantage. The minority carrier (electron) diffusion length is larger in p-type Si than the minority carrier (hole) diffusion length in n-type Si, meaning that photo-generated electrons can be collected further from the p–n junction when p-type Si is used rather than n-type Si. This effect allows for lower carrier recombination rates, increased photocurrent collection and better device performance if p-type Si is used. Si homojunction solar cells almost exclusively use p-type Si for this reason. Additionally, p-type Si is a preferable option due to its low cost compared to n-type Si. Thus, p-type Si should ultimately allow for higher efficiencies than n-type Si in hybrid devices. However, to date, suitable n-type, organic window layers have not been reported in conjunction with p-type Si.
C60 and its derivatives are good candidates as n-type acceptors for use in hybrid solar cells with p-type Si, because C60 is known to exhibit n-type semiconductor behavior while possessing a high electron affinity; several studies have investigated this type of architecture.23–26 These studies have investigated various aspects of the C60/Si system including its interfaces, electrical properties and photovoltaic properties. Such Si/fullerene devices have displayed a remarkable rectifying effect in the dark and a significant photo-response under illumination. However, these initial efforts to fabricate hybrid solar cells composed of p-type Si and an n-type organic material have not yet yielded the high power conversion efficiencies that one might expect.27 For example, Karaagac has published a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.41% from a hybrid solar cell with PCBM and p-Si,28 and E. A. Katz has reported hybrid solar cells consisting of C60 with Si, which yielded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 0.023%.25 Notably, these previous studies have utilized relatively thick organic n-type layers.
In this work, a hybrid solar cell system based on p-Si coated with C60 is presented. p-Si/C60 hybrid solar cells were fabricated using a thin layer of C60 deposited by thermal evaporation on top of p-type Si. Device fabrication parameters were explored and optimized including an investigation of photovoltaic properties by current–voltage and capacitance–voltage methods. The effect of the C60 thickness was investigated, as well as treatment of the C60 layer with an n-doping agent (tetrabutylammonium iodide, TBAI) and aging in an N2 environment. TBAI is an effective n-doping agent which has been used to n-dope solution processed PCBM films.29 Here, we have utilized TBAI as a thin interfacial layer on top of C60 by spin coating. Devices subjected to a 4 day aging treatment in N2 and with an interfacial TBAI layer between C60 and the top electrode yielded the best performance. The structure of the devices was characterized using cross-high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) to verify the interfacial characteristics and thickness of each layer. Additionally, electrical characteristics including current density–voltage (J–V) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) behavior were investigated in order to develop an understanding of the junction formation and carrier depletion in the devices. Improvements in device performance were realized by applying anti-reflection coatings to optimized devices in order to reduce reflective losses. The open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of optimized devices prepared in this manner were measured to be 0.50 V, 25.1 mA cm−2, 67%, and 8.43%, respectively. These values are by far the highest reported PCEs reported for hybrid solar cells comprising p-type Si and n-type organic compounds to date.
Results and discussion
The solar cell architecture that we have investigated comprises a typical p–n heterojunction stack using an absorbing, lightly p-doped (2.56 × 1015 cm−3) Si layer with an ultra-thin (10–40 nm), n-type C60 layer and an aluminum grid top cathode, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. A thin TBAI layer was also employed atop the C60 layer in some devices. A cross-sectional specimen of the device, prepared by focused ion beam milling, was examined by HR-TEM, as shown in Fig. 1b, confirming the thickness and uniformity of each layer. Additionally, a cross-section SEM image of the Si/C60/TBAI stack is included in the ESI (Fig. S1†).

A simplified energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 1c. Here, we have taken the conduction and LUMO band energies of Si to be 5.1 and 4.0 eV relative to vacuum, respectively.30 The LUMO of C60 has been shown to be pinned at 4.2 eV when in contact with a low work function metal such as Al,31 and the HOMO was calculated by adding the observed optical bandgap (1.5 eV) to the LUMO. A bottom, aluminum anode contact was used, creating back-surface-field contact via diffusion of Al3+ ions into the bottom interface of the Si layer, which effectively causes pinning of the anode Fermi level near the valence band energy of Si.32 The LUMO level of C60 lies ∼200–300 meV below the conduction band of Si, providing a suitable driving potential for electron transfer across the Si/C60 interface. Additionally, the relatively deep HOMO level of C60 effectively blocks holes in the Si phase from reaching the cathode. Incident photons pass through the grid electrode and thin C60/TBAI layers and are absorbed in the Si layer.
The absorption of light in the Si layer was modeled based on the optical properties of Si;33 these data are presented as a two dimensional schematic diagram in Fig. 1d, showing a bright region of charge generation only very near the top surface. It is noteworthy that the generation rate exceeds 1 × 1021 cm−3 s−1 at this top interface, and over 70% of the charge carriers are generated within 10 μm of the top of the Si layer. Although the generation rate drops off rapidly away from the top interface, a significant carrier generation rate is found throughout the thickness of the device, and the carrier generation rate remains above 1 × 1017 cm−3 s−1 even at the back interface. A plot of the logarithm of charge carrier generation rates vs. thickness can be found in the ESI (Fig. S2†).
Photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the Si layer have a weak binding energy of ∼15 meV, and freely move about the Si layer at room temperature under the influence of drift and diffusion processes. The high generation rate of both electrons and holes at the top interface creates a sharp concentration gradient, causing a strong diffusion current of both carrier types and away from this interface. Although the band diagram in Fig. 1c implies that the electric field across the device is 1-dimensional, this is not the case, as the Fermi level is pinned to the LUMO band of the C60 layer only where it is in contact with the Al cathode. Thus, the electric field through the device varies in 3 dimensions according to the geometry of the electrodes, and the electrons and holes generated in the Si layer drift under the influence of this field. The static electric potential distribution in this device architecture was modeled using the drift–diffusion model solved via a partial differential equation solver; this static potential distribution is shown in Fig. 1e. It is noteworthy that there is a significant horizontal gradient in electrical potential near the Al grids, which would draw electrons towards the grid and drive holes away, even prior to charge separation.
The distance between the grid lines in these devices is close to 1000 μm, which is typical for solar cells which employ semi-transparent grid electrodes. Most inorganic heterojunction solar cells which use grid electrodes employ a top window layer with a high electron mobility layer underneath the grid; this allows electrons which have crossed the p–n junction and reached the top interface to quickly travel across the top surface of the device and reach the grid electrodes without recombination. The situation in this device is somewhat different. The electron mobility of the C60 layer is on the order of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is about 5 orders of magnitude less than that of the Si layer (∼103 cm2 V−1 s−1). The very thin nature of the C60 layer additionally leads to high resistivity to electron transport in the horizontal direction. Thus, electrons which reach the top C60 layer in between the grid electrodes are immobilized, and it must be presumed that electron transport towards the grid electrodes occurs primarily within the Si layer, before charge separation occurs across the C60 interface. Because electrons are only able to exit the device at the grid contacts, this results in a lower concentration of electrons in the Si layer near the grid contacts. Thus, electrons are driven towards the grids via diffusion caused by this concentration gradient in addition to the electric field produced by the grid. Meanwhile, the high concentration of carriers at the top interface, as well as the electrical field in the device, cause photogenerated holes to move towards the bottom anode contact.
To evaluate the hybrid solar cell performance dependence on the thickness of C60, we fabricated hybrid devices with different thicknesses of C60 (from 10 nm to 40 nm). Each device was additionally aged for 4 days. J–V characteristics and a summary of device parameters are shown in Fig. 2 and Table S1,† respectively. A thin layer of C60 was chosen because the charge mobility of C60 is some 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of the Si layer and thus the current through the device is limited by electron transport through the C60 layer. Devices with a C60 layer thicker than 20 nm show significantly decreased performance. Notably, the fill factor decreased dramatically as the C60 layer thickness increased. This decrease in the FF indicates increased electron–hole recombination, which is consistent with decreased electron extraction through the thicker C60 film; the thicker C60 layer retards electron extraction and a relative buildup of electrons near the grid electrodes occurs which promotes charge recombination.

A thickness of 10 nm in the C60 layers was used in subsequent device optimization. In this study, we observed that aging devices in a nitrogen atmosphere after deposition of C60 had a positive effect on device characteristics for devices aged up to 4 days, including a significant improvement of the JSC and VOC. Further aging beyond 4 days resulted in a gradual decrease in JSC, VOC and FF. J–V characteristics of devices aged for different amounts of time are reported in the ESI (Fig. S3†) and the results are summarized in Table 1.

Devices aged for 4 days yielded the highest PCEs, which indicates the sensitivity to the aging time with respect to the performance of the solar cells. Devices aged for 4 days yielded a PCE of 4.52% with a JSC, VOC and FF of 16.64 mA cm−2, 0.46 V and 0.59, respectively, indicating an over 100% efficiency enhancement compared to the device without aging. Compared to previous studies which have used much thicker C60 films in Si/C60 junctions, this relatively high PCE can primarily be attributed to a reduction in series resistance of the C60 layer by using an ultra-thin (10 nm thick) film. For example, a 400 nm thick C60 layer was previously used by Katz et al. to achieve a PCE of 0.023%; the low JSC and FF observed in this architecture were attributed to the high resistivity of the C60 layer.25
We assume that the aging effect arises from passivation of dangling bonds and trap states on the Si substrate by a trace amount of oxygen or H2O contained in the N2 glovebox.34 Furthermore, we infer that the observed peak in performance after 4 days of aging likely corresponds to optimal passivation of the Si surface, whereas direct exposure to air or prolonged aging leads to the formation of a native SiOx layer, which inhibits electron transfer across the Si/C60 interface, disrupting the p–n junction and leading to the observed decrease in device performance.
Efficiencies of up to 15.5% have been realized using highly p-doped PEDOT:PSS in conjunction with n-Si,22 thus, we sought to improve the device characteristics by exploring the possibility of n-doping the C60 layer. TBAI has previously been demonstrated as an effective material to achieve n-doping in PCBM films; Jen and co-workers showed conclusively via electron spin resonance spectroscopy and polaron absorption spectra that TBAI results in mobile electrons and n-doping in PCBM films.29 Successful n-doping can be accomplished using TBAI without the need for harsh reagents (such as alkali metals) which have historically been used to n-dope C60.29 We observed that the introduction of a thin TBAI layer on top of the C60 layer as an electron extracting interfacial layer significantly improved the performance of the devices. This TBAI layer likely functions by two important mechanisms; first, n-doping of the C60 layer is expected to benefit the device by extending the depletion width deeper into the Si layer, while improving conductivity and electron extraction rates through the C60 layer by increasing the number of free electrons. Secondly, this type of ionic layer is known to form interfacial dipoles, which act to shift the vacuum level at the cathode, thereby reducing the effective work function of the top electrode and increasing the VOC.35,36
Devices with TBAI treatment exhibited improved performance compared to devices without TBAI treatment, as shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2. All of the aged devices with TBAI showed better performance than devices without a TBAI layer. Optimal results were obtained in devices with a TBAI layer (∼20 nm) in addition to 4 days of aging. These devices yielded a PCE of 5.67% including a JSC, VOC and FF of 19.10 mA cm−2, 0.50 V and 0.60, respectively. In order to characterize the spectral photocurrent response of the devices, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured for high performance cells as well as a reference cell (Fig. 3b). A clear enhancement of the JSC is evidenced by the higher EQE values for aged devices with TBAI.

In order to investigate these phenomena in more detail, we have calculated the series and shunt resistances (RS and RSH, respectively) for devices aged for various amounts of time, with and without TBAI interfacial layers, using J–V curves collected in the dark. These data are shown in Fig. S4† while RS and RSH values for these devices are summarized in Table S2.† The RS for the 4 day aged hybrid solar cells with and without a TBAI interfacial layer is 1.09 and 2.63 Ω cm2, respectively.
In order to obtain further insight into the device properties, the J–V characteristics (Fig. S3†) were further modeled using the Shockley diode equation. The VOC depends on the saturation current density (J0) and JSC according to eqn (1):30 (1)where J0 is the lower saturation current density of the device (also called the pre-exponential constant), q is the charge of an electron, n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. It is clear from eqn (1) that VOC strongly depends on the J0 of the solar cell. The JSC typically exhibits a relatively small variation compared to J0, which may vary by orders of magnitude. J0 is strongly dependent on recombination rates in the solar cell, so the VOC is likewise significantly influenced by recombination in the device. In other words, to attain high VOC, the J0 must be as low as possible. J–V curves collected for devices with the different aging times were analyzed in relation to J0 and VOC. We observed that the currents in the dark vary significantly with different aging times. The diode saturation current density, extracted from the intercept on the vertical axis from the logcurrent–voltage graph, falls from a high value of 10−4 to 10−5 mA cm−2 for the diode with 4 days of aging. This allows us to further conclude that the shift in curves is related to the aging time. The devices that were aged for 4 days have the lowest J0 value and the highest VOC value, consistent with trap site passivation and reduced carrier recombination in aged devices.
To study the effect of aging treatment, we have fabricated transistor devices with C60 and 4 day aged C60. In the native unaged device, the C60 layer is n-type in nature, and this n-type character slightly increased over time with aging. The highest mobility was found to be 4.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1 V−1 from 4 day aged C60; these results are presented in Fig. S5 and Table S3.†
To obtain insight into junction properties and to determine the density of the depletion layer in p-Si/C60 p–n junctions, we have studied Mott–Schottky-voltage (MS) and capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of the heterostructures. C–V characteristics are a powerful method to study the parameters of p–n junctions. The C–V and MS characteristics of the hybrid p-Si/C60 devices (both the 4 day aged devices with and without TBAI treatment under dark conditions) are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Capacitance–voltage (left) and Mott–Schottky-voltage (right) characteristic of the p-Si/C60 hybrid device with 4 days of N2 aging and insertion of TBAI. 
Other data taken from devices fabricated under different conditions are presented in Fig. S6.† From the C–V characteristics of the p-Si/C60 hybrid devices, we have calculated the width of the depletion layer (W) in these devices. W of different devices at 0 V can be derived from the equation, C = ε0εrA/W(2)where C and A are junction capacitance and area of the device, respectively, ε0 is the free space permittivity, and εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer. εr of Si is 11.7 (ref. 37) and that of C60 is 4.4.38
To calculate the W of the p-Si/C60 heterojunction device, we first determined εr (p-Si/C60) following the Lichtenecker logarithmic law of mixing for a composite of two components:39,40 logε =v1logε1 + v2logε2(3)where ε, ε1, and ε2 are the relative dielectric constant of the p-Si/C60 heterolayer, p-Si, and C60, respectively; here, v1 and v2 are volume fractions of the respective components. The values of the width of the depletion region in different devices are listed in Table S3.† With ε of the heterolayer being 11.48, the WSi/C60 was calculated to be 10.03 μm and 11.59 μm for the 4 day aged devices and the 4 day aged TBAI treatment devices, respectively. The wider depletion region in the device with TBAI is consistent with a higher doping in the C60 layer. The larger depletion width indicates that the electric field created by the p–n junction extends further into the Si layer when C60 is doped with TBAI than then when no TBAI is used. This enhanced electric field results in faster extraction of minority carriers (electrons) near the grid electrodes, which is consistent with the improved FF, as well as electrostatic attraction of electrons from deeper within the Si layer, which is consistent with a higher short-circuit current density in the devices using a TBAI layer. This explains that the relatively higher PCE of p-Si/C60-based devices is due to a wider depletion layer formed at the p–n junction that provided a larger volume for dissociation of photo-generated excitons.
Carrier density (N) of the depletion layer of devices can be calculated from the following equation:41 (4)
Using eqn (4), we have calculated acceptor carrier density Na of the p-Si/C60 devices. We have obtained Na = 2.3 × 1015 cm−3 from the devices with both 4 days of aging and TBAI treatment. In Table S3,† the results show that aging and TBAI treatment of the p-Si/C60 devices result in a wider W and an increased activated carrier density Na of 2.3 × 1015 cm−3 (in good agreement with the starting wafer specification, ∼5 × 1015 cm−3).
It is widely known that the refractive index (n) of Si is greater than 3.5 throughout the visible spectrum and causes at least 30–40% of the incident light to be reflected as it reaches the air/Si interface. Thus, all high efficiency Si-based solar cells incorporate some kind of ARC to improve the transmission of light through this interface. Although 10 nm of C60 and 20 nm of TBAI exist on top of the Si in the present devices, these layers are so thin that they are expected to have a small effect on the optical properties of these devices. Thus, we have briefly investigated the use of anti-reflection coatings to improve light transmission through the top interface of the devices.
The simplest type of ARC is the quarter-wave ARC, in which the refractive index of the coating (nARC) is equal to the square root of the refractive index of the substrate material, and the optical path length (film thickness × nARC) is equal to 1/4 the wavelength of the light which is desired to be transmitted (λ). This type of ARC allows a broad increase in the transmission of light with wavelengths centered around λ, with a maximum of 100% transmission possible at wavelength λ. The photovoltaics in this work generate photocurrent in the spectral range of 300–1100 nm and an increase in transmission would be most effective if centered in the middle of this range (∼700 nm). The refractive index of Si at 700 nm is 3.78, thus the ideal nARC and thickness of a quarter-wave ARC for these devices are 1.94 and 90 nm, respectively. We chose Sb2O3 as a material which can be easily thermally evaporated and which has a refractive index close to 1.94 at 700 nm when deposited at ambient temperature.42
The reflectance of Si was modeled using Fresnel's equations and compared to the reflectance of Si with a 90 nm layer of Sb2O3, these plots can be found in the ESI (Fig. S7†). These plots show that the reflectance should be reduced from 35% to less than 5% in the range of 600–900 nm. Devices were fabricated using optimal conditions including a TBAI layer and aging for 4 days, and completed with a 90 nm Sb2O3 ARC layer after grid electrodes were deposited. Although the modeled decrease in reflective losses suggests that the JSC may be increased by as much as 45% to ∼28 mA cm−2, the observed increase in JSC was somewhat lower, possibly due to a slight anti-reflection effect in the control devices, caused by the C60 and TBAI layers. Although the increase in JSC caused by the ARC was somewhat lower than the theoretically predicted value, the devices nonetheless showed a dramatically improved JSC of 25 mA cm−2. Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristic, and this improved JSC, with a VOC and FF of 0.50 V and 67%, respectively yielded a PCE of 8.43%, which is currently by far the highest PCE reported for any hybrid device based on a p-type Si layer and n-type organic layer.

All devices were fabricated on 350 μm thick, single-side polished, p-type (100)-oriented single crystal Si wafers with a resistivity of 1–5 Ω cm. The Si substrates were consecutively ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min each, followed by immersing into a solution of H2 SO4/H2O2 to ensure that surfaces were free of any residual material. The native oxide was removed by soaking the samples in a 2% HF solution for 2 min. Samples were then transferred immediately into a glovebox. Using thermal evaporation, a 100 nm thick Al layer was deposited onto the back side of the Si wafer serving as the back contact for the fabricated device. C60 was then thermally evaporated, and devices were aged in an N2 filled glovebox with less than 20 ppm of oxygen or H2O. A tetrabutylammonium iodide layer was deposited by spin-coating from a solution in chloroform (1 mg ml−1) at 3000 rpm for 30 s on top of the C60 layer. Devices were completed by thermal evaporation of an Al grid top electrode. An aperture was used to define the device area as 0.13 cm2, while the grid electrodes had an area of 0.027 cm2. Measurements were carried out with the solar cells inside a glovebox using high quality optical fiber guide simulated AM 1.5G light produced by a xenon arc lamp to solar cell samples with a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Calibration was carried out using a reference silicon photodiode certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit. For each condition, average PCEs and standard deviations were calculated from at least 4 functioning solar cells. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured in the spectral range of 300 to 1100 nm using a Model QEX7 system (PV Measurements Inc.). The C–V measurements were carried out using an (VSP classic, Bio-Logic) impedance analyzer.
Conclusions
We have conducted a detailed investigation of hybrid solar cells based on the Si/C60 heterojunction. This type of device is attractive as it offers a route to simplify the processing of Si solar cells by taking advantage of the simple and economical deposition of the organic C60 layer and eliminating the need for the sensitive, high-temperature diffusion of toxic gases into the Si crystal lattice. In this work, we have identified that the conductance of the organic n-type layer constitutes a bottle-neck which limits photocurrent extraction from this type of hybrid device. We found that this issue could be overcome by using an ultra-thin, highly doped C60 layer. The use of an ultra-thin (∼10 nm) C60 layer was critical to allow rapid electron extraction and prevent the build-up of electrons near the grid electrodes. Additionally, aging in an N2 environment and the introduction of a TBAI layer were both found to increase the depletion width in the Si layer, while reducing carrier recombination rates and improving the diode characteristics of the devices. Optimization of the TBAI layer and aging parameters led to PCEs of ∼5.67%. A further increase in the PCE of these devices was realized by the introduction of an Sb2O3 ARC which led to devices with a PCE of 8.43%. This value is currently the highest reported for any hybrid, heterojunction device composed of a p-type Si layer with an n-type organic layer by a large margin and serves to establish the Si/C60 heterojunction as a viable and attractive platform for future research. We envision that further optimization of the fabrication process, geometry, and electrical contacts and management of charge-recombination issues can lead to highly competitive hybrid solar cells.
