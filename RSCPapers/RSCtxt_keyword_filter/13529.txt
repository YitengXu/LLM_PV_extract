    , Accepted 9th August 2018First published on 11th August 2018AbstractEfficiency and transparency are the most essential issues for semi-transparent polymer solar cells (ST-PSCs), and must be compatible to facilitate and advance commercial applications such as photovoltaic integration in windows, roofs and other aesthetic buildings. Herein, an optical adjusting layer (OAL) is intentionally introduced to poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA)-based ST-PSCs to effectively enhance light absorption by adjusting the incident light phase. The shoulder field of the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra was greatly broadened, especially at long wavelengths, resulting in a 22.6% improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) while maintaining a 26.1% average visible transmittance (AVT). Furthermore, transfer matrix modeling (TMM) was used to analyze the function of the OAL by calculating the optical field distribution and absorption in the device. The reflection phase shift induced optical field redistribution results in dramatically enhanced absorption in the active layer, which agrees well with experimental results. We believe these findings offer a promising path to develop high-performance ST-PSCs with practical applications.
Introduction
In the past decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been attracting great attention and have been systematically investigated owing to their unique advantages of excellent mechanical flexibility and low-temperature solution processing.1–4 Combined with constantly developing suitable band gap polymer materials, engineering interface modification and optimizing device structures, the excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of both single-junction and tandem PSCs has recently exceeded 12%.5–7 In addition to pursuing excellent device efficiency, it is desirable to develop high-performance PSCs with versatile properties such as semi-transparent polymer solar cells (ST-PSCs) to seek the possibility of commercialized application.8–11 Benefiting from an adjustable active layer thickness and transparent substrates/electrodes, ST-PSCs have become the most popular candidates for transparent photovoltaics, which can be integrated with building windows, awnings, wearable clothes, etc.12–14 Recently, Zhan et al. reported a high performance ST-PSC with 10.2% efficiency with a fused-undecacyclic electron acceptor IUIC.15 Meanwhile, non-toxicity is another appealing feature of PSCs that makes them more suitable for use in semi-transparent devices than lead-based perovskite solar cells, even though the performance of the latter is greater.16,17 In practical application, an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 25% or higher is required for aesthetic and practical windows.15,18,19 However, the conflict between the efficiency and transmission of ST-PSCs is irreconcilable.20,21 Consequently, ST-PSCs with thinner active layers and hyaline electrodes inevitably appear to have lower efficiency compared to their opaque counterparts. Therefore, the dilemma of the trade-off between transparency and light absorption has severely limited the further improvement of ST-PSCs.22
Recently, a variety of photovoltaic materials (including polymer donors, fullerene-free acceptors, transparent buffer layers and top electrodes) have been investigated to look into the above situation and pursue high-performance ST-PSCs.21,23–25 It is worth noting that transparent electrode character plays a critical role in influencing device performance parameters and the final PCE as well as the total transmittance.26,27 Firstly, Yang’s group reported poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C60 butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) based ST-PSCs with a 12 nm Au electrode, which demonstrated PCEs of 0.52% and 0.85% from Au and ITO side illumination, respectively.28 In 2013, Silva et al. reported a flexible device showing a considerable PCE of 6.87% with an AVT of 36% which employed 18 nm of polyaniline (PANI) as a hole transport layer (HTL) and a thin Ag transparent electrode.29 In addition, silver nanowire was also employed in top transparent electrodes due to its advantages of solution processability, high conductivity, flexibility and high transparency.30–32 Graphene, widely explored as the thinnest two-dimensional carbon material, has been extensively applied in semi-transparent devices.33 In 2015, Yan’s group obtained an excellent 3.4% PCE and ∼40% transmittance with PTB7/PC71BM as an active layer by using a graphene electrode.34 However, the unabsorbed light cannot be reflected into the active layer again, with the above electrodes possessing infusive conductivity and transmittance, leading to low photocurrent density and efficiency. To overcome this problem, other approaches such as exploiting microcavities,35,36 dielectric mirrors37–40 and plasmonic metal nanostructures41,42 have been reported to partially recover such lost light. One-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs), which coat the top of the transparent electrode, are known as an excellent light management strategy since Shen’s group first reported this work in 2012.37 In this device structure, the selected reflection wavelength that is used for re-absorption can be adjusted to any desired position, and other wavelength regions of visible light can be preserved for high transparency. In 2013, Tang et al. reported on the introduction of six pairs of MoO3/LiF dielectric mirrors to the P3HT:PCBM based device, which led to a 30% enhancement of the PCE.39 Recently, Li et al. fabricated inverted PTB7-Th:PC71BM based ST-PSCs with the same dielectric mirrors, demonstrating a PCE of 7.0% with an AVT of 12.2%.40 However, the fabrication process of photonic crystals is relatively complicated due to the need for multiple evaporations. Meanwhile, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) gets narrower along with the increment of the photonic crystal period, which results in more PCE loss compared to the control device.
In this contribution, an optical adjusting layer (OAL) made of WO3 was proposed and inserted into photonic crystal based ST-PSCs. The IPCE curve broadened with the increasing thickness of the OAL, leading to a notable PCE enhancement from 3.98 ± 0.14% to 4.88 ± 0.15% compared to the one without the OAL. Additionally, an excellent AVT of 26.1% was obtained simultaneously, which meets the requirements for building window applications well. Furthermore, the theory simulation using transfer matrix modeling (TMM) reveals that the OAL can effectively adjust the reflection phase and enable a redistribution of the optical electric field. This dramatically enhanced light absorption in the active layer is in accordance with the experimental results. We believe the performance improvement caused by this new light management method for the OAL can pave the way towards further ST-PSCs.
Experimental section
The investigated ST-PSCs have an inverted structure of ITO/PEI/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA)/MoO3/Ag/WO3(x)/[WO3/LiF]5. The pre-printed ITO with a sheet resistance of ∼15 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 86% was pre-cleaned successively with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, soap and deionized water, and dried with N2. Before spin coating with 5 nm polyethyleneimine (PEI), the ITO conducting glasses need to be treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (UVCOS Company) for 10 min. Then, the PEI film was annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 20 min. The blend solution was prepared by dissolving a 1:1 weight ratio of P3HT (Lumtec Corp., used as received) and ICBA43,44 (Lumtec Corp, used as received) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), with a total concentration that was controlled at 40 mg ml−1. It was then spin coated on the PEI film at 1500 rpm for 40 s and thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in a glove box. Finally, the devices were finished by evaporating the MoO3 layer (∼5 nm) and ultrathin Ag electrode (∼15 nm) in a high vacuum (∼10−5 Pa). The opaque devices were covered with a 100 nm Ag electrode. For well designed devices, x nm WO3 (x = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100) as the OAL and cyclical 1DPCs of [WO3 (61.3 nm)/LiF (97.3 nm)]5 were evaporated in the same vacuum on the top of the Ag electrode, the shape of which was determined by a cover module. The active area of the devices was about 6.4 mm2. For the characteristic current density (J)–voltage (V) curves, air mass 1.5G simulated irradiation with an Oriel 300W solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was employed with a computer-programmed Keithley 2601 source meter. The IPCE spectra were obtained with a Pharos Technology QEM1000. The transmittance and absorption results for the cells were obtained using an ultraviolet/visible spectrometer (UV-1700, Shimadzu). The thickness of each layer was measured using a step profiler (ET 150, KOSAKA).
Experimental and simulation results and discussion

Fig. 1 displays the device architecture based on WO3 as the OAL. For the part of the 1DPCs made of WO3/LiF units, the working principle is on the basis of , where n represents the refractive index of the materials, d represents the film thickness and λ0 is the centre wavelength of the reflected region. According to the location of the main absorption peak of the active layer, 510 nm is used for λ0. In the range of visible light, the average low refractive index of LiF and high refractive index of WO3 are 1.31 and 2.08, respectively, thus the thickness of each layer can be calculated accordingly. Here, 5 pairs of 1DPCs were chosen instead of 8 pairs as previously reported in order to reduce the relatively tedious fabrication process. A thickness-tunable WO3 layer was inserted between the electrode and the 1DPCs.
 Fig. 1  Device architecture of OAL induced ST-PSCs with 5 pairs of 1DPCs. 
The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of devices based on OALs of different thicknesses with or without 1DPCs are illustrated in Fig. 2a, and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that all devices exhibit the same open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 ± 0.01 V and a similar fill factor (FF), suggesting that the built-in potential has not been exchanged by outer optical components. In order to better understand the difference between the opaque device and the ST-PSCs, the opaque one was also tested with a 100 nm Ag electrode, showing a Jsc of 8.66 ± 0.08 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.34 ± 0.14%. An obvious increase in both Jsc and PCE to 6.43 ± 0.14 mA cm−2 and 3.98 ± 0.14%, respectively, is obtained with only 1DPC devices, as compared to 5.42 ± 0.12 mA cm−2 and 3.35 ± 0.12% for the control device without 1DPCs. The performance improvement can be attributed to the light reflectance enhancement of the active layer range caused by the 1DPCs, which has been demonstrated in detail in our previous papers. It can be emphasized again that selective reflection from 1DPCs can dramatically enhance the photocurrent. Surprisingly, when the WO3 layer as the OAL was inserted into the device structure, the device photocurrent showed thickness-dependent characteristics. The variation tendency can be summarized as the performance of ST-PSCs gradually becoming optimal with a WO3 layer thickness of 80 nm, which achieved the best performance with a Jsc of 7.88 ± 0.13 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 4.88 ± 0.15%.

To achieve a further understanding of how the OAL affects the improvement of Jsc for ST-PSCs, the IPCE spectra of all devices are depicted in Fig. 2b. The IPCE of the opaque device was also checked to compare the well designed ST-PSCs. It is obvious that the peak for devices with 0 nm OAL was at 510 nm, which is consistent with the design requirements of 1DPCs. It is important to highlight that the peak value of IPCE increases remarkably and appears to red-shift to the region of red light with increasing OAL thickness. This wavelength range occupies more photons and has an important effect on the improvement of Jsc, which has been reported in detail in previous reports. Surprisingly, the IPCE curve with an 80 nm OAL shows an excellent extended enhancement in the regions of 320–460 nm and 520–640 nm in comparison with that of the device with 0 nm. The red-shift phenomenon can be attributed to the redistribution of the optical electrical field caused by the OAL, as is shown in the simulation section below. Herein, the integrated current density (Jint) from the IPCE curves was calculated to confirm the accuracy of the measured Jsc and the detailed parameters are shown in Table 1. The Jint results are comparable with the corresponding Jsc values, which verifies that the photovoltaic parameters from the J–V curves are reliable.
The transmission is another important parameter for ST-PSCs. In order to satisfy the demand of integrated building windows, the transmittance of the designed ST-PSCs was investigated and is shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding AVT values in the visible region (390–780 nm) are also listed in Table 1. There is a typical trough from 440 nm to 560 nm for the 0 nm device, which is determined by the forbidden band of the 1DPCs. As the thickness of the OAL increases, the troughs broaden and move toward longer wavelengths, which indicates that more incident light is trapped in the devices to support the opportunity of second absorption for PCE improvement. Considering that 20 nm WO3 acts as an anti-reflective film and improves the overall device transparency, the AVT of 35.59% is higher than that of 31.84% for devices without OALs. It is gratifying that the excellent efficiency of devices with 80 nm OALs still retain an AVT of 26.1%, which meets the application requirements well. Overall, the variation trend of the transmittance spectrum is consistent with the observation from IPCE, which provides direct evidence that OALs can effectively adjust the optical spectrum.
 Fig. 3  Transmission spectra of devices w/o 1DPCs and with different thicknesses of OAL in the wavelength range from 350 to 900 nm. The AVT of the devices are calculated from 390 to 780 nm. 
To further explore the effect of the OAL in ST-PSCs, the normalized absorption spectra of devices with or without OALs were recorded using TMM and are shown in Fig. 4. It is clearly observed that the absorption of devices with an 80 nm OAL is much higher in the range of 400–460 nm and 530–650 nm compared to that of those without, which is consistent with the measured transmittance and IPCE results. The absorption enhancement could be attributed to the double effect of the OAL. First, when an OAL is inserted, the reflection of the Ag/OAL/1DPCs multilayer is enhanced within the long wavelength range (see Fig. 5a). This results in an absorption enhancement in the red wavelength range. Second, insertion of the OAL can lead to a big change in the reflection phase shift of the Ag/OAL/1DPCs multilayer, which is shown in Fig. 5b. Correspondingly, the optical electric field in the active layer is redistributed and the electric field maximum is located within the active layer, as shown in Fig. 5c. The optical electric field of |E|/|E0| at a wavelength of 600 nm was accurately calculated. Herein, the |E| in 1DPCs is set as zero. It was observed that, although there is a wave crest inside the active layer, the maximum of the optical electric field exists outside of the devices. Surprisingly, the desired maximum value of the optical electric field is located within the active layer by inserting 80 nm OAL between the Ag electrode and 1DPCs, which is much higher than that of devices without an OAL. It can be observed that the OAL produces an obvious reflection phase shift and spatial redistribution of the optical electric field in the device, leading to an enhancement of the absorption of incident light and increased Jsc and PCE.

It should be pointed out that the absorption in the active layer shows a valley at a wavelength of around 490 nm. This possibly happens because a microcavity resonance occurs between the transparent Ag electrode and the 1DPCs. As is shown in Fig. 6, a microcavity-resonance-enhanced electric maximum occurs between the transparent Ag electrode and the 1DPCs. Interestingly, around the cavity resonance wavelength, the transmission of the device peaks, indicating that the cavity resonance of the Ag/OAL/1DPCs can improve the transmission within the forbidden gap of the 1DPCs. Moreover, the transmission peak can be red-shifted by increasing the thickness of the OAL.

In addition to enhancing the electrical properties of the ST-PSCs by incorporating the OAL/1DPCs, the color features have also been checked to ensure they meet the aesthetic requirements of building-integrated photovoltaics. In order to investigate the color variation degree after irradiating devices with the light source, the color rendering index (CRI) and the chromaticity difference (DC) of typical devices were calculated and listed in Table 2. Here, a CRI of 86 with a DC of 0.0281 was achieved for the device without 1DPCs. It is obvious that the CRI values decline to 66 with a DC of 0.0338 and 27 with a DC of 0.0696 for the 0 nm and 80 nm OAL devices, respectively. The lower CRI and relatively high DC (above 0.0054) indicate that the color character has been changed remarkably after combining with the OAL and 1DPCs. To further verify the above conclusion, the color coordinates (x, y) of the ST-PSCs were stamped on the CIE 1931 color space (Fig. 7a) using an AM 1.5G illumination light source. The color coordinates of (0.3929, 0.3267) of the device without 1DPCs are little changed compared to those of (0.3307, 0.3415) of AM 1.5G. However, the devices with an 80 nm OAL show the farthest coordinates of (0.3966, 0.2517), indicating that the optical unit of the OAL/1DPCs can remarkably change their color features. Fig. 7b shows a photograph of an excellently designed device with an 80 nm OAL and 1DPCs in front of a building and trees. A photograph of the structure with glass/OAL (80 nm)/1DPCs is also shown in Fig. 7c, in which the color change is in accordance with the color coordinates.

In summary, we have demonstrated a novel approach for both high efficiency and high transmittance ST-PSCs by embedding an OAL. The extension of the IPCE curves to both short and long wavelengths contributes a notable enhancement in the PCE, which is firstly reported in our 1DPC based ST-PSCs. TMM simulation results show the photoelectric field intensity redistribution caused by adjusting the reflectance phase of the incident light, enabling a notable absorption enhancement in the active layer, which is consistent with the experimental results. We believe that this new light management method with an OAL can provide a new way for future investigations of ST-PSCs.
