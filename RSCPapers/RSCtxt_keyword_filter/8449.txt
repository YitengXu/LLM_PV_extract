    , Accepted 23rd January 2018First published on 24th January 2018AbstractPhotochemical electron donor–acceptor dyads having a penta(hexyloxy)triphenylene donor attached to the imide nitrogen atom of a perylene monoimide dihexyl ester acceptor by an ethynylphenyl bridge were prepared to give TP-n-PIE (n = 1, 2 and 3). Their molecular structures were characterized by 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (IR), mass spectroscopy (MS) and elemental analysis (EA). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces, polarizing optical microscopy (POM) textures and X-ray diffractograms confirmed that shorter ethynylphenyl bridges facilitated the formation of a columnar hexagonal liquid crystal phase. The intensity of light absorption of the perylene units was independent of the bridge lengths, while that of the triphenylene units was red-shifted with the increase of the bridge lengths. 2D and 3D photoluminescence emission showed that the fluorescence quenching degree of perylene units increased as the rigid bridges became shorter. According to the energy level structures of the dyads, fluorescence quenching was attributed to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer processes. And in these processes the charge-separated state of the molecule, TP+˙-1-PIE−˙, further confirmed by the photocurrent response curve, was obtained. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that although the ethynylphenyl bridges were conjugatedly connected to the triphenylene units, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and the band gaps of these dyads were nearly constant when the bridge lengths varied. And these results were in agreement with those of theoretical modelling. The formation of a columnar liquid crystal phase, the large molar extinction coefficient and efficient formation of charge-separated molecules when excited give these dyads the prospect of being used as a novel type of single-component photovoltaic active materials.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs), featuring low cost, lightweight and flexibility, have attracted great attention in the past decades.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs has surpassed 13% so far.2 In spite of this remarkable performance, the realization of solution-processed BHJ solar cells still poses a number of problems related to both the nature of the active materials and the fabrication process.3 Wasielewski proposed that the ideal functional organic materials used in solar cells should have electron donor and acceptor building blocks covalently attached in one molecule, as well as the orderly arrangement of the building blocks in the solid state.4 Thus, the drawbacks of poor stability in bi-component cells3 and the low charge-carrier mobility can be greatly improved.5
To deal with the stability issue in bi-component solar cells, single-component OSCs using only one photoactive material, which possesses multi-functions like light absorption, exciton dissociation, and electron and hole transport, were proposed.3 The strategy is to covalently link the electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) units to obtain dyad or triad molecules. And in this field great progress has been made in the past decades.6 On the other hand, the realization of the orderly arrangement, especially at the macro level, of moieties of the single-component materials is still a challenge. However, the use of self-assembly strategies offers the possibility of increasing the degree of order and the charge-carrier mobility in the solid state.7
The dyads, triads and multiads containing electron donor and acceptor units and having columnar liquid crystal phases are preferred candidate materials to achieve these goals. The conventional discotic liquid crystal (DLC) molecules usually consist of two parts. One is a planar rigid core, and the other is three to eight flexible side chains, usually connected through ester, ether, or thioether bonds to the core.8 Most of the DLCs are thermotropic liquid crystals and show strong tendency to columnar mesophase formation. Since there are strong π–π interactions between the adjacent cores in the molecular columns, the carrier mobility is up to 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the molecular column.9 For the peripheral side chains of the columns acting as insulating layers, the charge-carrier mobility is low in the direction perpendicular to the molecular column. For example, when 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexa(hexyloxy)triphenylene (HAT6) is in the columnar hexagonal liquid crystal phase and doped with the Lewis acid AlCl3, the conductivity along the column axes is approximately 1000 times greater than that in the perpendicular direction. Thus, the molecular columns of discotic liquid crystals are known as quasi-one-dimensional conductors.10
When the electron donor and/or acceptor units of the DLC molecule are excited, a rapid intramolecular charge transfer occurs between the two units, forming the charge-separated states of the molecules.11 In the columnar liquid crystal phase, the electrons will migrate along the molecular columns formed by the acceptor units, and the holes will migrate along those formed by the donor units.11a,12 If the molecules have been arranged on the surface of an electrode in the face-on alignment (in which the molecular columns are perpendicular to the electrode surfaces), electrons and holes can migrate respectively to the electrodes at high speed, to achieve the purpose of efficient disassociation of excitons and high charge-carrier mobility. However, to turn the ideal functional organic materials into reality, there is still a long way to go.
A few DLC materials with columnar phases containing D and A units have been reported so far. In 2004, Kumar's group reported the first triphenylene (TP)–alkoxy bridge–anthraquinone dyads, which contained two discogens and displayed a columnar mesophase.13 In 2010, Varshney et al. reported mesogenic TP–alkoxy bridge–anthraquinone-alkoxy bridge–TP triads.14 In 2011, we synthesized a TP–alkoxy bridge–perylene diimide–alkoxy bridge–TP triad having a stable columnar mesophase.15 Since then, liquid crystal properties,12a,16 energy level structures,11b,12b,17 and photoinduced electron transfer processes11d,18 of DLC dyads, triads and multiads have been investigated by a number of research groups.
However, these reported DLC materials containing two or more different discogens are all connected by flexible spacers. And the lengths of bridges have a low limit to guarantee the D and A units to possess partial freedoms of intracolumnar rotation and fluctuation, or else the columnar mesophase will be lost.14,15,16d,17,19 On the other hand, the photoinduced electron transfer theory shows that the rate constants of electron transfer decay exponentially with the distance between the D and A units.20 The shorter the spacers, the higher the rate constants of electron transfer are. From this point of view, the formation of the columnar mesophase of molecules containing D and A units is in conflict with the large rate constants of intramolecular electron transfer.
In this work, the tricky problem was solved by synthesis of a novel kind of dyads, consisting of a penta(hexyloxy)TP unit, a perylene monoimide diester (PIE) unit and a rigid ethynylphenyl bridge. The molecular structures of the D–A dyads are shown in Fig. 1, denoted as TP-n-PIE (n = 1, 2 and 3). Molecular structures in relation to the mesophase transitions, electrochemical behaviours, theoretical modelling of the frontier molecular orbitals, UV/Vis absorption spectra, fluorescence emission/quenching, and intramolecular electron transfer processes, as well as the photocurrent response phenomena, were studied in the following sections. The experimental results showed that the shorter ethynylphenyl bridges facilitated the electron transfer between the D and A units, and, at the same time, maintained the columnar liquid crystal phase of the dyads.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The D–A dyads were synthesized according to Scheme 1. The mono-(hydroxyl)penta(hexyloxy)TP (compound 1)21 and perylene mono-anhydride diesters (compound 14)11b,17 were readily obtained according to the procedures reported previously. Compounds 2,225,23824 and 925 were prepared according to the reported procedures (with slight modifications), and their spectral data were matched with the literature values.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of D–A dyads based on TP and perylene cores. Reagents and conditions: (i) pyridine, (CF3SO2)2O, r.t., overnight, 88%; (ii) CuI, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, THF, Et3N, refluxing, 5 h or overnight; (iii) KOH, toluene, refluxing, 2 h; (iv) CuI, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Et3N, r.t., 10 h; and (v) 4-iodoaniline, anhydrous zinc acetate, imidazole, 150 °C, overnight, 98%. 
β-ethynylpenta(hexyloxy)TP (5) was a key intermediate for synthesis of the target D–A dyads. Varshney's group reported that 5 was prepared by hydrolysis of protective acetylene (4), which was obtained by the Sonogashira coupling of β-bromopenta(hexyloxy)TP with 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (3).23 However, the preparation of β-bromopenta(hexyloxy)TP was a multistep synthesis.26 Here we reported a straightforward procedure. 1 reacted with trifluoro-methanesulfonic anhydride at room temperature, using pyridine as a deacid reagent, to give the esterification product (2) in 88% yield. Using the Sonogashira reaction, 4 was prepared by coupling of 2 with 3 in the presence of cuprous iodide and bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) dichloride,27 and a 92% yield was obtained. In the presence of potassium hydroxide, 4 was refluxed in toluene for 2 hours to give 5 smoothly by removing an acetone molecule. 8 was synthesized by monoheterocoupling between 3 and 1,4-diiodo-benzene (6) in the mixture of Et3N and THF, catalysed by the copper–palladium system, as a white solid in 56% yield. 9 was synthesized accordingly from the starting material 4,4′-diiodo-1,1′-biphenyl (7) in 48% yield. 8 or 9 further coupled with 5 under similar conditions to afford the TP derivatives 10 (86% yield) or 11 (81% yield), respectively. In the presence of potassium hydroxide, 10 or 11 was refluxed in toluene for 2 hours to give 12 or 13 almost quantitatively, respectively. The experiments showed these two terminal alkyne compounds in solution were sensitive to air, so they were used to couple with 15 without further purification. Compound 15 was prepared by the imide reaction between 14 and 4-iodoaniline in imidazole at 150 °C, catalysed by anhydrous zinc acetate, as a red solid in 98% yield. Then 15 further coupled with 5, 12 or 13, catalysed by the copper–palladium system, to afford the target D–A dyads respectively, in good to excellent yields. Since 12 and 13 in solution were sensitive to air and the dyads contaminated by 15 were difficult for purification, these two terminal alkyne compounds were used in two equivalents in the reactions.
Phase behaviours and potential in self-organization
Before the phase behaviours were studied in detail, the degradation temperatures of the D–A dyads were evaluated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) under a N2 atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†). The overall degradation process indicated that for these dyads, a main degradation event occurred with a mass loss of approximately 40% at an initial decomposition temperature higher than 350 °C. Based on these results, these dyads are stable at the temperatures of phase transition.
Phase behaviors of the D–A dyads were investigated by POM (optical textures see Fig. 2) and DSC (see Fig. 3). Peak transition temperatures along with the associated enthalpy changes (ΔH) are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3, TP-1-PIE showed two endothermic transitions and peaked at 213 and 221 °C in the first heating cycle, and exothermic peaks at 200 and 191 °C during the first cooling circle. Under microscopic observation, upon heating, the dark red crystal melted at 210 °C, and the birefringent fluid was maintained up to 226 °C, where the birefringent phenomenon disappeared. The birefringent fluid resorted at 215 °C during cooling and then solidified at 190 °C. It can be seen that TP-1-PIE has an enantiotropic mesophase in heating and cooling processes, and the temperature ranges of the mesophase are less than 30 °C.

During heating run, TP-2-PIE showed two endothermic transitions which peaked at 225 and 242 °C, respectively. During the cooling circle, two sharp exothermic peaks occurred at 235 and 188 °C, respectively. Under microscopic observation, when heating up the dark red crystal started to flow at 211 °C with birefringence, which was maintained to 251 °C and then disappeared. Upon cooling, the birefringence returned around 247 °C. Maintaining cooling, the birefringence fluid solidified at 187 °C. Based on these results, TP-2-PIE has an enantiotropic liquid crystal phase in heating and cooling processes, and the temperature range of the liquid crystal phase in the cooling scan is about 60 °C. Compared with TP-1-PIE, it was attributed to the longer bridge of TP-2-PIE.
DSC curves showed only one endothermic peak at 244 °C in a heating circle for TP-3-PIE and one exothermic peak at 239 °C during cooling. Under microscopic observation, the dark red crystal melted completely at 253 °C, without the birefringent phenomenon. When cooled, the isotropic liquid recovered from birefringent at 245 °C, but solidified immediately. This revealed that TP-3-PIE did not have a thermotropic mesophase. The reason may be that the length of the bridge mismatched the volumes of the discotic cores.
The liquid crystal optical textures of dyads TP-1-PIE and TP-2-PIE, bearing shorter bridges, are shown in Fig. 2. These textures are similar to the focal conic textures and straight linear defects for the hexagonal columnar phase, respectively.9b,16c
To probe the precise phase structure, TP-1-PIE was studied using XRD. The X-ray diffractogram of the supercooled mesophase of TP-1-PIE at room temperature is shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the data are summarized in Table 2. In the large-angle range it exhibits a broad peak at about 2θ = 20°, which is typical for diffraction from disordered alkyl chains. It also shows a somewhat narrower peak at 2θ = 25.72° which is assigned to diffraction from the stacking periodicity of the molecules within the columns.28 In a general way, these two peaks are characteristic of discotic liquid crystal mesophases.29 In the low-angle region, three diffraction peaks are observed at 5.32, 9.43 and 10.67°.12b The d-spacings of the three peaks show a ratio of 1:1/√3:1/√4, and it is the fundamental reflection of a columnar hexagonal mesophase.29 These results match with those of the DSC and POM experiments.

Electrochemical behavior and theoretical modelling
The electrochemical behaviours of HAT6, PIE3, and TP-n-PIE (n = 1, 2 and 3) were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dry acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The measurements were carried out using a standard three-electrode cell with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and a glass carbon electrode as the working electrode, with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature. The samples were drop-cast directly onto the working electrode. The cyclic voltammograms of these compounds are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), and all potentials were recorded versus Ag/AgCl reference. The HOMO energy values of these compounds can be derived from the potential values corresponding to the onset of the first oxidation waves (denoted as Eox(1)). The Eox(1) of HAT6 and PIE3 were 1.08 and 1.75 V, respectively (see Table 3). The Eox(1) of TP-n-PIE (n = 1, 2 and 3) were 1.20, 1.15 and 1.18 V, respectively. The potential values of these dyads corresponding to the onset of the second oxidation waves (denoted by Eox(2)) were 1.75, 1.74 and 1.69 V. Analysis of these data showed that the first oxidation waves of the dyads can be assigned to the oxidation reaction of the TP unit, and the second oxidation waves were correlated to the oxidation reaction of the PIE unit.

Calibrated with an internal standard, the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox system,30 the HOMO energy value of a compound was calculated by the equation HOMO (eV) = −[e(Eox − E(Fc/Fc+)) + 4.8], where e is the unit charge, 4.8 eV is the HOMO energy value of Fc/Fc+ with respect to the zero vacuum level, E(Fc/Fc+) is the potential value of Fc/Fc+ under the same experimental conditions. The HOMO energy values of HAT6, PIE3, the TP and PIE units of the dyads are summarized in Table 3. It can been seen that the HOMO energy values of the TP units of the dyads were between −5.36 and −5.39 eV, which were about 0.1 eV lower than that of HAT6. This decrease was attributed to the extended system of delocalised π electrons on the TP units and the ethynylphenyl bridges. The HOMO energy values of the PIE units of the dyads were between −5.89 and −5.94 eV, which were nearly identical to that of PIE3.
The LUMO energy values can be estimated from the optical band gaps (denoted as Eg) and the HOMO energy values by the equation LUMO = HOMO + Eg. The Eg values were inferred from the onset of the longest wavelength absorption bands (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The LUMO energy values of HAT6, PIE3, the TP units and the PIE units of the dyads are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that the TP units of the dyads have narrower optical band gaps and lower LUMO energy values than those of HAT6. The LUMO energy values of PIE units of the dyads were almost the same as that of PIE3 and were nearly not affected by the rigid ethynylphenyl bridges connected to the N-atoms.
As one molecule, the HOMO energy value of a dyad corresponds to that of the TP unit, which is higher than that of the PIE unit; the LUMO energy value of the dyad equals that of the PIE unit, which is lower than that of the TP unit. And the energy difference between these two molecular orbitals is the Eg of the dyad. It is smaller than that of the TP and PIE units (see Table 3), and the illustration is shown in Fig. 10.
The electronic structures of the cores of the dyads were modelled. Despite the fact that side chains play an important role in the formation of the mesophase, they have little effect on the HOMO and LUMO energy values of DLCs.31 Thus, the hexyl chains were replaced by methyl groups in the computer simulations to reduce the computational load. All theoretical calculations were carried out using the Gaussian16 (revision A.03) suite of programs. Full geometry optimization of the D–A dyads was performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level using Becke's three-parameter B3LYP exchange functional and the 3-21G basis set. The geometries of the dyads, fully optimized in the gas phase, were nonplanar structures. The isosurfaces of the frontier molecular orbital are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). It can be seen that the HOMO frontier molecular orbitals located on the TP unit and the partial rigid bridges, and the LUMO orbitals only located on the PIE units. The HOMO and LUMO energy values of TP-1-PIE were predicated to be −4.99 and −3.20 eV, respectively. And the optical band gap was about 1.79 eV. These calculated results matched the experimentally measured values of −5.39, −3.60 and 1.79 eV, respectively (see Table 3).

Steady-state spectroscopy

UV/Vis absorption spectra. 
UV/Vis absorption spectra of HAT6, PIE3, the mixture of HAT6 and PIE3 (in the molar ratio of 1:1) and the D–A dyads in chloroform solutions (concn = 5 × 10−6 mol dm−3) were measured (see Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  UV/Vis absorption spectra of HAT6, PIE3, the mixture of HAT6 and PIE3 (in the molar ratio of 1:1), and TP-n-PIE (n = 1, 2 and 3) in chloroform, concn = 5 × 10−6 mol dm−3. 
The absorption range of the reference compound HAT6 is in the ultraviolet region, between 230 and 365 nm. Its absorption maximum is at 280 nm, and the peak optical density corresponds to an extinction coefficient (ε) of 1.01 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1, belonging to the π–π* electron transition. The PIE3 has its absorption maximum at 507 nm (ε = 6.04 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1), accompanied by a vibronic progression peaking at 475 nm and 450 nm, correlated to the π–π* electron transition. Between 230 and 450 nm the absorption of PIE3 reduced but remained a finite level (2.40 × 103 L mol−1 cm−1 at 390 nm). The absorption peak of PIE3 in the range of 230 to about 390 nm belongs to the transition of n–π* of CO groups. The absorption spectrum of the mixture of HAT6 and PIE3 (in the molar ratio of 1:1) is the sum spectra of the two isolated compounds, and no new absorption peaks appear. This indicates that there is no charge transfer between the HAT6 and PIE3 molecules in the ground state in dilute chloroform solution. In the visible range, the absorption spectra of the D–A dyads, caused by the absorption of PIE units, are very similar to that of PIE3. This is because that there are nodes or very low atomic coefficients at the N-atoms, so the PIE units are decoupled from the rigid ethynylphenyl bridges, and the π electrons on the PIE units are located on themselves. Thus the light absorption of the PIE cores was nearly not affected by the rigid ethynylphenyl bridges. In the ultraviolet range, the absorption spectra of the dyads were red-shifted compared with that of HAT6. This was because of the extended system of delocalised π electrons on the TP units and the ethynylphenyl bridges. These are consistent with the calculated HOMO frontier molecular orbitals of the dyad molecule in the ground states (see Fig. 6 and Fig. S4, ESI†).


Photoluminescence emission spectra. 
Photoluminescence emission of the D–A dyads, excited at 479 nm, was measured in chloroform solutions (see Fig. 8). As references, the emission spectra of HAT6 and PIE3 were also measured and plotted alongside. The emission intensity of HAT6 was actually negligible, for its absorption band was in the ultraviolet region and the corresponding emission wavelength was less than 470 nm.11b Compared with PIE3, the spectra profiles of TP-n-PIE (n = 1, 2 and 3) were very similar, peaking at 540 nm and had a shoulder at 566 nm.
 Fig. 8  Photoluminescence emission spectra of HAT6, PIE3, TP-n-PIE (n = 1, 2 and 3), λex = 479 nm. Inset: An enlarged section of the emission spectra of HAT6 and the dyads (all in chloroform solutions at concn = 5 × 10−6 mol dm−3). 
This revealed that when excited at 479 nm the fluorescence emissions of these dyads were mainly from the PIE units. However, the emission intensities of the dyads significantly weakened as compared with that of PIE3. In the inset, further decreases were observed as the bridges became shorter. In fact, TP-1-PIE was almost nonluminous. It was obvious that the general reduction of emission showed the presence of fluorescence quenching processes in the excitation of D–A dyads at 479 nm.
In order to study the fluorescence emission in more detail, the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of the reference compounds and the D–A dyads were obtained (see Fig. 9 and Fig. S5, ESI†), and the data are provided in Table 4. There are five peaks in the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra. Peak a (λex = λem) and peak b (2λex = λem) are the first- and second-ordered Rayleigh scattering peaks, respectively.32 Peak I (λex = 265 nm and λem = 540 nm) and peak II (λex = 505 nm and λem = 540 nm) dominantly display fluorescence behaviours of the perylene backbone. The different λex of the two peaks are derived from the absorption of the perylene backbone in the ultraviolet and visible regions, respectively. Peak III (λex = 280 nm and λem = 390 nm) expressed the fluorescence characteristics of the TP backbone. Compared with Fig. 9A, the fluorescence intensities of peak I and peak II in Fig. 9B both have been quenched by about 99%. The mechanism of fluorescence quenching is discussed in the following section. It also can be seen that the intensity of peak III decreases severely, quenched by about 97%. This implies that there are energy transfer processes33 and photoinduced electron transfer processes34 between the two units of the D–A dyads when the TP unit is excited.

The mechanism of fluorescence quenching of the PIE units was further discussed by using the photoinduced electron transfer theory.20 Firstly, we treat the D and A units as entities that can be studied separately. This approximation is reasonable because the absorption spectra of the dyads correspond to the sum spectra of the individual molecular units.33 Secondly, to simplify these processes, we further assume that the HOMO and LUMO energy values of both A and D units do not vary during the electron transfer processes. In the case of TP-1-PIE, the energetic positions of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are shown schematically in Fig. 10. When the A unit was excited at 479 nm, the electron transfer processes of the dyad are shown in Fig. 10. In the absence of irradiation, the molecule was in the ground state (indicated by D–A). When excited (Ex) by light at 479 nm, only A unit was excited, for D unit did not absorb in the visible light region. An electron on the HOMO of the A unit transitioned to its LUMO to give a molecule with the A unit in the excited state (denoted by D–A*). Since the HOMO level of the D unit was higher than that of the A unit, an electron was transferred from the D unit to the A unit, generating a molecule in the charge-separated state (denoted by D+˙–A−˙). This process was an intra-molecular photoinduced electron transfer process (represented by PET). Finally, the electron on the LUMO level of A transitioned to the HOMO level of D, and then two units resumed to the original ground state (indicated by D–A). This process was a charge recombination process (expressed by CR). In all processes shown in Fig. 10, the PET was a critical step leading to fluorescence quenching. According to the theory of photoinduced electron transfer, the electron transfer rate constant decays exponentially with the distance between the donor and acceptor units.20 Thus, the shorter the bridges, the stronger the fluorescence quenching degrees of the A units are.
 Fig. 10  Schematic representation of the electron transfer processes of TP-1-PIE excited at 479 nm (a dashed arrow indicates the two energy levels involving the transition or transfer of an electron, and Eg represents the band gap of the dyad). 
Furthermore, in the processes shown in Fig. 10, CR represents the transition of an electron from the LUMO energy level to the HOMO energy level of the dyad molecule. The energy difference between these two levels was the Eg of the dyad. However, the corresponding absorption peaks in UV/Vis spectra or emitting peaks in photoluminescence emission spectra were not observed in dilute chloroform solutions.

Photocurrent phenomena
The photocurrent generation of the TP-1-PIE film deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode was tested using a standard three-electrode cell. The toluene solution of TP-1-PIE was prepared at a concentration of 1 mg cm−3. Then the films on the working electrode were fabricated using the drop-casting method. Using 63.2 mW cm−2 white light irradiation and applying a voltage of +0.1 V to the working electrode, a rapid anodic photocurrent response was observed (Fig. 11).
 Fig. 11  Photocurrent curve of the TP-1-PIE film polarized at +0.10 V and irradiated with intermittent white light (counter electrode: platinum wire; reference electrode: Ag/AgCl electrode; working electrode: ITO glass coated with TP-1-PIE; supporting electrolyte: KCl aqueous solution, concn = 0.1 mol dm−3). 
When the TP-1-PIE film was irradiated with white light, the molecule in the charge-separated state, TP+˙-1-PIE−˙, was yielded due to the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (see Fig. 10). The PIE units negatively charged gave electrons to the conduction band of ITO, which resulted in the anodic photocurrent.
Conclusions
Three novel dyads, consisting of a TP unit, a PIE unit and an ethynylphenyl bridge, have been designed and synthesized. In the visible region, the absorption spectra of the D–A dyads were consistent with those of the PIE unit, retained the high extinction coefficient of the perylene backbone. In the ultraviolet region, the absorption of the D–A dyads is red-shifted compared with that of the reference compound HAT6, since the system of delocalised π electrons extended from triphenylene units to alkynylphenyl bridges. And these were in agreement with the HOMO frontier molecular orbital in the computer simulation experiments. The DSC traces, POM textures and the XRD patterns of the D–A dyads showed that the shorter ethynylphenyl bridges facilitated the formation of a columnar hexagonal liquid crystal phase. The 2D and 3D fluorescence spectra confirmed that the shorter the ethynylphenyl bridges, the greater the rate constants of intramolecular photoinduced electronic transfer between the D and A units are. Thus, in these dicogen-based dyads connected by rigid bridges, the columnar liquid crystal phase is compatible with the high rate constants of intramolecular electronic transfer. The intramolecular electronic transfer process always results in molecules in the charge-separated states. These properties were also confirmed by the photocurrent response curves. In conclusion, the generation of charge-separated molecules and the formation of a columnar liquid crystal phase make these dyads have the prospect of being used as a novel type of single-component photovoltaic active materials.
