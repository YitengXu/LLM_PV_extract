    , Accepted 17th August 2017First published on 18th August 2017AbstractLayered transition metal sulfides (TMS) are emerging as advanced materials for energy storage and conversion applications. In this work, we report a facile and cost-effective anion exchange technique to fabricate a layered, multifaceted, free standing, ultra-thin ternary cobalt molybdenum sulfide nanosheet (Co–Mo–S NS) architecture grown on a 3D porous Ni foam substrate. The unique Co–Mo layered double hydroxides are first synthesized as precursors and consequently transformed into ultra-thin Co–Mo–S NS. When employed as an electrode for supercapacitors, the Co–Mo–S NS delivered an ultra-high specific capacitance of 2343 F g−1 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 with tremendous rate capability and extraordinary cycling performance (96.6% capacitance retention after 20000 cycles). Furthermore, assembled Co–Mo–S/nitrogen doped graphene nanosheets (NGNS) in an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device delivered an excellent energy density of 89.6 Wh kg−1, an amazing power density of 20.07 kW kg−1, and superior cycling performance (86.8% capacitance retention after 50000 cycles). Such exceptional electrochemical performance of Co–Mo–S NS is ascribed to the good electrical contact with the 3D Ni foam, ultra-high contact area with the electrolyte, and enhanced architectural softening during the charging/discharging process. It is expected that the fabricated, unique, ultra-thin Co–Mo–S NS have great potential for future energy storage devices.
Introduction
The demands for sustainable and green energy have motivated research into the development of novel, cost-effective and environmentally friendly materials for electric energy storage and conversion technologies.1 Supercapacitors have fascinated researchers in the past few decades due to their fast charge–discharge characteristics, ultra-high power density, and extraordinary cycling performance.2,3 So far, they have been inadequate for broader applications due to their poor energy density, which is lower than that of lithium ion batteries.4–7 The targeted energy density for supercapacitors is E = 0.5CV2 and it can be reached by improving the cell potential window (V) and the specific capacitance (C) of the system.8 Both V and C strongly depend on electrodes/electrode materials characteristics, such as particle size, morphology, structure, configuration, and porosity.6 Hence, investigations into novel electrodes/electrode materials to enhance the energy density of supercapacitors have been a research focus when fabricating novel nanoarchitectures, in order to efficiently utilize active electrodes/electrode materials.
Carbon based materials were considered as suitable electrode materials, especially for electrical double layer capacitors (EDLC) whose deliverable specific capacitances were ∼200 F g−1.9,10 In recent years, transition metal hydroxides, oxides, and sulfides have been validated as substitute electrode materials with improved specific capacities due to the nature of their pseudocapacitive characteristics, such as the faradaic reaction.11–13 Thus, these electrode materials are discussed as exterior pseudocapacitive electrodes. In particular, transition metal sulfides have evolved as a novel class of active electrode materials due to their high catalytic activity, ultra-high electrical conductivity, excellent redox reversibility, and low electronegativity, which make transition metal sulfides superior to their corresponding hydroxides and oxides.14 For example, NiS, CoS, CuS, SnS, MoS2, etc., have been extensively studied as novel electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their unique structural and admirable catalytic behaviours.
In particular, ternary transition metal sulfides such as Co–M–S (M = Ni, Cu, and Fe) hold excellent capacity and electrocatalytic activity with richer redox properties than binary metal sulfides because of their multiple oxidation states.15–17 Co–M–S exhibits higher electric conductivity than its oxide counterparts due to its smaller band gap for electron transfer.18 Replacing oxygen with sulfur might generate flexibility for the material's organization due to the lower electronegativity of sulfur compared to oxygen.19 For instance, Co–Ni–S has excellent capacitive performance, greater than that of Co–Ni-oxides. Co–Ni–S is considered as an electrode material in supercapacitors because of its high theoretical capacitance and higher catalytic activity; however it suffers from poor cycling life.20 Replacing Ni with Mo should be a better choice, as Mo6+ is more active than Ni2+ due to adjustable valences for redox reactions.21 In addition, its layered architecture could additionally enhance the specific capacity and cycling performance compared to materials based on Ni. To the best of our knowledge, a study on Co–Mo–S as an electrode material for supercapacitors has not been performed in the past.
Many researchers have reported the synthesis of transition metal sulfides with nanoarchitectures, such as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanosheets, which have been proposed to have excellent energy storage characteristics when compared to bulk transition metal sulfides. However, the enormous amount of volumetric change during the charge/discharge process leads to decreased specific capacitance and the shortened cycling life of such devices. Added binders and conductive additives while fabricating the electrodes minimized energy storage behaviour, and impeded the electron transport from the electrode to the current collector, limiting its practical application in supercapacitors.22,23 The use of binder-free electrodes/electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors with ultra-long cycle life has also been studied. To further increase the usage of metal sulfide-based electrodes/electrode materials, various unique architectures have been grown directly on 3D conductive porous substrates to generate increased specific surface area, enhanced ion or electron transport kinetics, enhanced rate capability and better cycling performance.13,24–26
Recently, chemical transformations of nanomaterials have been developed as promising techniques for nanostructure fabrication. Among those, ion exchange has been demonstrated to be an effective and cost-effective technique for the structural and chemical transformation of nanomaterials.27–29 The ion-exchange reaction technique avoids the problems of toxic H2S gas, high pressures, and high temperatures, and significantly decreases the synthesis cost while preserving reproducibility. For example, CoS and NiS with different nanostructures can be simply fabricated from metal oxide or hydroxide precursors through an effective ion exchange reaction technique via the nanoscale Kirkendall effect.30 The ion exchange reaction technique could therefore be an innovative approach to generate ultra-thin nanoarchitectures via chemical transformation of the nanomaterials. So far, only a little attention has been paid to the anion exchange reaction technique for the fabrication of transition metal sulfide nanosheets with different nanostructures on 3D conductive porous substrates, and their usage in supercapacitor applications.
In this manuscript, we establish a successive ion exchange reaction strategy to fabricate an ultra-thin ternary metal sulfide nanosheet (Co–Mo–S NS) with hierarchical architecture by employing a ternary metal hydroxide as a precursor. The consecutive ion exchange reactions used in this work help us to establish control over the structure of the final materials. We transformed Co–Mo LDH into ultra-thin Co–Mo–S NS with a porous architecture via an anion exchange reaction between Co–Mo LDH and S2− ions (Fig. 1). The resulting ultra-thin Co–Mo–S NS possesses enhanced electrochemical properties as a pseudocapacitive electrode with ultra-high specific capacitance and exceptional cycling performance. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is then constructed by using hierarchical Co–Mo–S NS as the cathode and N-doped graphene nanosheet (NGNS) as the anode, which exhibits tremendous cycling life with enhanced energy density as well as power density.

Experimental
Synthesis of hierarchical Co–Mo–S NS
The Co–Mo–S NS electrode was fabricated via a simple and cost-effective two-step process as follows: Ni foam (20 mm × 50 mm × 11 mm) was pre-treated with 2 M HCl, acetone, deionized H2O, and ultra-pure ethanol, each for 10 min to remove the oxidized layer and other unwanted impurities from the surface of the Ni. The cleaned Ni foam was placed on a glass slide and then immersed in a 100 mL Teflon lined autoclave with a mixture solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol), (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (0.14 mmol), and C6H12N4 (4 mmol), in H2O (50 mL), followed by a hydrothermal reaction at 160 °C for 10 h to allow the Co–Mo LDH precursor to grow on the 3D Ni foam. After completion of the reaction, the Co–Mo LDH precursor grown over the 3D Ni foam substrate was washed with deionized H2O and ethanol to remove impurities and other molecules with the help of a mild ultrasonic bath, followed by drying at 60 °C for 12 h to remove adsorbed H2O and ethanol. In order to study the electrochemical performance of the Co–Mo–O NS, the Co–Mo LDH precursor was annealed at ∼350 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of ∼1 °C min−1 in an air atmosphere. Next, the Co–Mo–S NS was fabricated by placing the Co–Mo LDH precursor/3D Ni foam into an 80 mL autoclave together with a solution containing 50 mg thioacetamide (TAA). The autoclave was heated in an oven at 120 °C for 3 h. The as-synthesized Co–Mo–S NS was then washed with deionized H2O and ultra-pure ethanol to remove the residue of sulfur ions, followed by drying at 60 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. The loading densities of the electrode materials Co–Mo LDH, Co–Mo–O, and Co–Mo–S NS were about ∼1.7, ∼1.5, and ∼2.3 mg cm−2, respectively.
Synthesis of NGNS
Graphene oxide (GO) was first synthesized by our previous method.16 50 mg of GO and 5 mL of 50% cyanamide were dispersed in 50 mL of deionized H2O and then sonicated for 1 hour. The resulting homogeneous mixture was transferred into a 100 mL beaker and heated at 80 °C under constant stirring for 12 h to remove H2O. Finally, the as-obtained material was ground well and calcined at ∼900 °C for 3 h in an argon atmosphere to obtain the NGNS product. In order to remove residual impurities, the obtained powder was stirred with 0.5 M H2SO4 for 12 h followed by washing with deionized H2O and pure ethanol. The NGNS electrode was fabricated employing the following procedure: a mixture of NGNS (85 wt%), acetylene black (10 wt%, as a conductor), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; 5 wt%, as a binder) was ground well and a small amount of anhydrous ethanol was added to make homogeneous slurry. The paste was coated onto the Ni foam current collector, followed by pressing at 10–12 MPa to produce the NGNS electrode.
Material characterizations
The morphologies of the as-synthesized materials were examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM; SUPRA 40 VP; Carl Zeiss, Germany) at the Center for University-Wide Research Facilities, Chonbuk National University, South Korea. The elemental composition and quantity of the as-synthesized materials were studied by ICP-AES (J-A1100; Jarrell-Ash Company, Japan) and EDAX (SUPRA 40 VP; Carl Zeiss, Germany). The TEM, HR-TEM and SAED patterns of the as-synthesized materials were obtained on a JEM-2200 FS system (JEOL Ltd, Japan, 200 kV) at KIST, South Korea. XPS (Theta Probe; Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) and STEM/EDX (JEOL Ltd, Japan, 200 kV) measurements were used to study the elemental compositions of the as-synthesized materials. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) were used to determine the BET surface area and pore size distribution of the as-synthesized materials.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized materials and the NGNS based electrodes were examined via a three-electrode cell configuration under ambient conditions (∼25 °C). Prior to the performing the electrochemical investigation, the direct 3D Ni foam grown nanosheets, (S ≈ 10 mm × 10 mm) were soaked in a 3 M KOH electrolyte and degassed under vacuum for 6 h. Pt foil and saturated Ag/AgCl were employed as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively. The electrochemical performance of the ASC device was examined under a two-electrode cell configuration with Co–Mo–S NS grown 3D Ni foam as the cathode and NGNS as an anode in KOH-PVA with a thickness of about 0.1 mm as the solid electrolyte. The KOH-PVA gel electrolyte was synthesized by the following method: 2 g of KOH, 3 g of PVA, and 36 mL of DI water were mixed and stirred at ∼90 °C until a clear solution was obtained, followed by stirring at room temperature to remove the bubbles from the gel electrolyte. The mixture was shifted into a mold to achieve a ∼0.1 mm thickness KOH-PVA membrane. The CV, GCD, and EIS studies were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT 30, Autolab). To design the ASC device employing two-electrodes with enhanced energy storage performance, it was essential to match the charges of the two electrodes (cathode and anode). In order to achieve the mass ratio of Co–Mo–S to NGNS, we utilized the charge balance equation (q+ = q−). The masses of the Co–Mo–S and NGNS electrodes were altered according to eqn (1): (1)where m is the mass, Cg is the specific capacitance, and ΔV is the voltage range for the cathode (+) and anode (−), respectively. In order to calculate the charge balance between the Co–Mo–S and NGNS electrodes in the ASC device, the mass ratio was set to ∼0.23. The solid-state Co–Mo–S//NGNS device was investigated by CV as well as GCD to confirm the energy storage properties for real time electronic industry application. The specific energy density and power density were calculated according to eqn (2) and (3): (2) (3)where E (Wh kg−1) is the energy density, Ccell is the specific capacitance, P (kW kg−1) is the power density of the ASC device, ΔV (V) is the cell voltage eliminating IR drop, and Δt (s) is the discharge time. Further, the practical applicability of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS ASC device was tested using a green LED (∼1.2 V, 20 mA, Model: L-7113F3C, Kingbright).
Results and discussion
The approach for the fabrication of hierarchical Co–Mo–S NS on porous 3D Ni foam is illustrated in Fig. 1. The Co–Mo layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor with a nanosheet structure is first grown on porous 3D Ni foam via a simple and cost-effective hydrothermal technique. Next, the Co–Mo LDH precursor is transformed into Co–Mo–S NS in the presence of a sulfur source (TAA). During the thermal decomposition process, TAA produces S2− ions in the solution, which anion-exchange with OH− ions of the Co–Mo LDH precursor, while the Kirkendall effect leads to the formation of Co–Mo–S NS. The structural morphology of these Co–Mo–S NS materials is different from those obtained via high-temperature synthesis or single-step sulfurization processes; at the same time the structural morphology slightly changes after the sulfurization process when compared to the Co–Mo LDH precursor.31 In the present work, TAA was used as an effective sulfur source, which is crucial for the establishment of enriched sulfur active sites in the nanoparticles.32 This study also confirms that TAA is one of the best sulfur precursors to synthesize metal sulfides with attractive nanoarchitecture without morphology defects, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance in supercapacitors. When compared with previous reports on the synthesis of transition metal sulfides with different nanoarchitectures,24,33,34 the current synthesis of Co–Mo–S NS grown on porous 3D Ni foam delivers a unique porous structure with a hierarchical 3D nanoarchitecture, and therefore provides highly efficient utilization of the electroactive materials and pseudocapacitive performance.
SEM images of Co–Mo–S NS were recorded from the top. The SEM image shows that Co–Mo–S NS are uniformly grown over the porous 3D Ni foam, forming high density Co–Mo–S NS with a hierarchical 3D nanoarchitecture (Fig. 2a). The high magnification SEM image of Co–Mo–S NS shows an inter-crossed nanosheet network perpendicular to the porous 3D conducting support, which are connected with each other, establishing well-ordered nanosheets with an open and porous nanoarchitecture (Fig. 2b and c). Therefore, these Co–Mo–S NS with maximized surface area are easily accessible to the electrolyte when employed as electrodes in supercapacitors. The calculated thickness of the Co–Mo–S NS was found to be ∼12–14 nm (Fig. 2c). After the sulfurization process, the Co–Mo–S NS preserves its original shape without any damage. The EDAX (the inset in Fig. 2b) results reveal that there were no other impurities in the Co–Mo–S NS, confirming the high purity of nanosheets synthesized by the current fabrication technique.

The atomic weight percentages of cobalt, molybdenum, and sulfur in the nanosheets measured using EDAX analysis are shown in the inset of Fig. 2b. The comparable atomic weight percentages of the Co–Mo LDH, Co–Mo–O NS and Co–Mo–S NS are analysed by ICP-AES, as shown in Table S1.†
SEM-EDS elemental mapping analysis of the Co–Mo–S NS shows that cobalt, molybdenum, and sulfur are consistently distributed in the Co–Mo–S NS (Fig. S1c−f†). In the case of Co-Mo LDH, the SEM images show interconnected nanosheets with unique porous architectures grown over the 3D Ni foam (Fig. S2a†). The thickness of the Co–Mo LDH precursor is calculated to be ∼8–10 nm. In the case of Co–Mo–O NS, it is observed that the morphology is not affected even after annealing at a temperature of ∼350 °C (Fig. S2c†). This study confirms that the nanosheets are thermally stable at ∼350 °C in an air atmosphere. EDAX analyses of Co–Mo LDH and Co–Mo–O NS are shown in Fig. S2b and S2d,† respectively. These data show that Co–Mo–O NS have higher oxygen content than Co–Mo LDH, indicating that oxidation successfully happened during the annealing treatment at ∼350 °C. The surface morphology and thickness of the Co–Mo–S NS were examined via AFM. The AFM and its analogous line scan profile picture are shown in Fig. S3.† The AFM study confirms that the calculated thickness of the Co–Mo–S NS is ∼3.5 nm, which is consistent with SEM results. The transparency of Co–Mo–S NS resembles that found in a previous research report.35 The high-resolution AFM image of the Co–Mo–S NS shows that the surface was accurately smoothed with an rms roughness of only ∼0.8 nm (Fig. 2d).
The intrinsic morphology of Co–Mo–S NS was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM. The TEM images show an ultra-thin wrinkled structural morphology of nanosheets (Fig. 3a). The morphology of the Co–Mo–S NS was not affected by the sulfurization process but showed a higher structural order. As anticipated, the sulfur source of TAA plays an imperative role in retaining the structure of the Co–Mo–S NS. The HR-TEM image (Fig. 3b) shows that each ultra-thin Co–Mo–S NS comprises several nanoparticles, creating the unique mesoporous network architecture via interconnections between the particles, which is caused by ion-exchange processes during the sulfurization process. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows distinct rings, demonstrating the polycrystalline nature of the Co–Mo–S NS (the inset of Fig. 3b).

The HR-TEM image (Fig. 3b) further confirms the presence of highly crystalline Co–Mo–S nanoparticles with an average size of ∼4 nm and the presence of a mesoporous network with an average pore diameter of ∼3 to 5 nm. The Co–Mo–S NS possess well-ordered lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of ∼0.573 nm, which corresponds to the (200) plane of the crystalline CoMo2S4. Fig. 3c−g shows the scanning TEM (STEM) image of the Co–Mo–S NS and analogous EDS colour mapping of the elements Co, Mo, and S. This study confirms that the elements are uniformly distributed over the Co–Mo–S NS. Altogether, this work demonstrates that Co–Mo–S NS can be fabricated effectively via anion-exchange with sulfur successfully replacing oxygen.
The crystalline nature of the Co–Mo–S NS material was investigated by using its XRD pattern, as shown in Fig. 4a. The diffraction peaks at 2θ ∼ 15.2°, 18.4°, 35.3°, 43.2°, 47.6°, 53.5° and 64.2° corresponds to the (200), (001), (111), (401), (600), (003) and (211) planes of the monoclinic CoMo2S4 (JCPDS card no. 74-0537). The broad diffraction peaks reveal that the nanoscale sizes of ultra-thin Co–Mo–S NS are successfully fabricated. This result is well-consistent with a previous report.37 The interlayer spacing between Co–Mo–S NS was calculated using Bragg's law to be ∼0.571 to 0.574 nm. This result is consistent with our HR-TEM observations (∼0.573 nm), as shown in Fig. 3b. In addition, the XRD patterns of as-synthesized Co–Mo LDH and Co–Mo–O NS are shown in Fig. S4.† The XRD patterns of the corresponding materials revealed a highly crystalline nature with different diffraction patterns. The detailed discussions are included in the ESI.†

Next, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to obtain information about the surface electronic states of the Co–Mo–S NS, as shown in Fig. 4b−e. The XPS survey spectrum of the Co–Mo–S NS (Fig. 4b) exhibits the elemental composition of cobalt (∼787.3 eV), molybdenum (∼233.7 eV), and sulfur (∼165.86 eV). The survey XPS spectrum shows a negligible amount of impurities such as carbon (∼284.76 eV) and oxygen (∼530.9 eV), which confirms that the prepared Co–Mo–S NS are highly pure in form. The emission spectra of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 are fitted with two spin–orbit peak features of Co2+ and Co3+ (Fig. 4c). In particular, the high-resolution Co 2p3/2 spectrum indicates a peak located at ∼775.6 eV which is assigned to Co3+ and a peak located at ∼780.1 eV which is assigned to Co2+.36 The high-resolution Co 2p1/2 spectrum indicates a peak located at ∼793.1 eV which is assigned to Co3+ and a peak located at ∼797.3 eV which is assigned to Co2+. The Mo 3d high-resolution XPS spectrum (Fig. 4d) of the Co–Mo–S NS shows Mo 3d3/2 deconvoluted spin–orbit peaks at ∼235.2 eV, which correspond to Mo5+ 3d5/2, and a peak at ∼232.5 eV, which corresponds to Mo4+ 3d3/2.38 This result suggests the presence of Co–Mo–S NS. Additional peaks were observed at ∼227.2 eV and ∼225.6 eV, which are assigned to the S species with two chemical states of Mo and Co ions, respectively. Further, the high-resolution S 2p spectrum (Fig. 4e) of the Co–Mo–S NS shows two chief peaks at ∼163.89 and ∼162.16 eV, which correspond to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 of Mo–S bonds, and two other prominent peaks at ∼163.06 and ∼161.44 eV, which are ascribed to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 of the Co–S bonds. This result is well consistent with a previous report.37 This present work confirms that the Co–Mo–S NS contains Co2+, Co3+, Mo4+, Mo5+, and Mo6+, which are expected to play a significant role as high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials.39 These results are consistent with the STEM-EDS colour mapping analysis. Thus, the XPS spectra further confirm the successful fabrication of the Co–Mo–S NS, which suggests the highly synergistic interaction between Co, Mo and S. The survey XPS spectra of the Co–Mo LDH, and Co–Mo–O NS are illustrated in Fig. S5.† High-resolution XPS spectra of Co–Mo LDH and Co–Mo–O NS are shown in Fig. S6.† Based on the XPS results, the near surface of Co–Mo–S NS has an elemental composition of Co2+, Co3+, Mo4+, Mo5+, and Mo6+, and S2−, which is in agreement with Co–Mo–S NS. The atomic weight percentages with respect to Co, Mo and S were determined to be Co 2p (32.56 at%), Mo 3d (31.09 at%), and S 2p peaks (23.21 at%). Therefore, a Co:Mo ratio of 1:1 is retained.
An N2 sorption isotherm study is used to investigate the textural properties and mesoporosity of the materials. The N2 sorption isotherms of Co–Mo LDH, Co–Mo–O, and Co–Mo–S NS are shown in Fig. 4f. All the materials show a distinct hysteresis loop with typical IV sorption characteristics, confirming the presence of the mesoporous architecture. It is worth noting that Co–Mo LDH has a high specific surface area of ∼426.6 m2 g−1, which is significantly higher than that of Co–Mo–O NS (∼186.7 m2 g−1). The high specific surface area is ascribed to the hierarchical nanostructure with a unique mesoporous interconnected network of Co–Mo LDH, which collapses a little during the annealing at ∼350 °C, due to dehydration and the formation of Co–Mo–O NS. Co–Mo–S NS also possesses an ultra-high specific surface area of ∼368 m2 g−1. These results demonstrate that Co–Mo–S NS has an ultra-high surface area, which is much higher than that of previously reported ternary metal sulfides.17,40 The pore size distributions of Co–Mo LDH, Co–Mo–O, and Co–Mo–S NS are shown in Fig. S7, ESI.† The average pore size distributions of Co–Mo LDH, Co–Mo–O, and Co–Mo–S NS are calculated to be ∼3.56 nm, ∼4.67 nm, and ∼8.44 nm, respectively. The porous architecture with uniform pore size is expected to improve ion transport kinetics during charge–discharge processes and to enhance the cycling performance of electrodes in supercapacitor applications.
To investigate the electrochemical performance of Co–Mo–S NS, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) studies were performed. The electrochemical characteristics of Co–Mo–S NS are examined in a three-electrode system using an aqueous 3 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 5a shows CV curves of Co–Mo–S NS in the potential window of −0.2 to 0.85 V with different scan rates. All CV curves show strong redox peaks, indicating the typical electrochemical behaviour of transition metal sulfide based electrodes.24,41 The establishment of the redox peaks is attributed to the reactions between the electrolyte and the electrode materials, conforming to the following eqn (4) and (5):37 CoS + OH− ↔ CoSOH + e−(4) CoSOH + OH− ↔ CoSO + H2O + e−(5)

In this redox reaction, Mo is not involved in the pseudocapacitive behaviour. Specifically, the capacitance measurement of Co–Mo–S NS confirms the quasi-reversible electron transfer kinetics, which is due to reversible Co3+/Co2+ redox reactions in aqueous KOH electrolyte.12,42 As the scan rate increases from 5 to 50 mV s−1, the anodic peak shifts towards the positive direction, whereas the cathodic peak shifts towards the negative direction, demonstrating that richer redox reactions occurred in Co–Mo–S NS during the electrochemical performance. Even at a high scan rate of 50 mV s−1, the CV curve displays redox peaks, which reveals that the electrode has an excellent rate capability.
To further examine the potential application of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode for supercapacitors, GCD measurements were performed in different current density ranges from 1 to 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5b). The areal and specific capacitance of the Co–Mo–S NS electrodes are calculated according to the discharge curves using the following eqn (6): (6)where I is the current during the discharge process,  is the integral area under the discharge curve, V is the potential with respect to initial and final value of Vi and Vf, and m is the mass of the active electrode materials. The distinct plateau regions in the GCD features of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode suggest pseudocapacitive characteristics. These GCD results are in good agreement with CV studies. The specific capacitance of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode from the GCD curves were calculated and found to be ∼2343, 2252, 2170, 2096, 2017, 1935, 1887, 1831, 1770, 1735 and 1717 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. At a high current density of 50 mA cm−2, 73.3% of the capacitance was retained, which demonstrates the superior rate capability of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode. Even at high current density, the GCD curves maintain the symmetric charge–discharge behaviour, demonstrating excellent electrochemical features of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode as pseudocapacitor behaviour with an outstanding rate performance.
Remarkably, the Co–Mo–S NS electrode showed a higher rate capability than that of other electrodes (Co–Mo LDH and Co–Mo–O NS) at fixed current density values (Fig. S8†). The enhanced specific capacitance and rate capability of the Co–Mo–S NS may be due to their complex nanoarchitecture consisting of a hierarchical porous structure with ultra-high specific surface area. For comparison, the GCD was conducted for Co-Mo LDH and Co–Mo–O NS electrodes, for which it was measured at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. S9a.† The Co–Mo–S NS exhibited a higher specific capacitance than Co–Mo LDH (∼1212 F g−1) and Co–Mo–O NS (∼1113 F g−1). Such excellent electrochemical performance of the Co–Mo–S NS can be ascribed to the ultra-thin nanosheet morphology, involving a highly porous architecture that contributes to the enhanced ion transport kinetics during the charge–discharge process. The porous 3D Ni foam acts as a framework to offer more ion/electron paths for insertion and extraction, enhancing the electrical conductivity of the electrode materials. Synergistic interactions between Co, Mo and S may increase the number of electroactive sites for the charge–discharge process, and also the S intermediate atoms directly bonded to Co–Mo–S NS enhance the electron transport kinetics, leading to further improvement of the electrocatalytic performance.
The electrochemical performances of Co–Mo LDH, Co–Mo–O, and Co–Mo–S NS were all examined as pseudocapacitor materials in aqueous KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 (shown in Fig. 5c). This study confirms that the current density and CV curve area of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode is several times larger than that of Co–Mo LDH and of Co–Mo–O NS. Well-resolved redox peaks are observed for Co–Mo–S NS, which is due to the existence of pseudocapacitive behaviour in aqueous KOH electrolyte. The Co–Mo–S NS holds ultra-high current density, which is superior to recently reported transition metal sulfides.43–46Fig. 5d shows the specific capacitance vs. current densities of Co–Mo–S NS electrode. The specific capacitance of 2343 F g−1 and areal capacitance of 5.39 F cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 are approximately three times higher than those of Co–Mo LDH (Cs = 1212 F g−1; CA = 2.06 F cm−2) and Co–Mo–O NS (Cs = 1113 F g−1; CA = 1.67 F cm−2) electrodes (Fig. S9b†). The specific/areal capacitance of the as-prepared Co–Mo–S NS electrodes is also higher than that of reported transition metal sulfide based electrode materials (Table S2†). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were performed to investigate electrolyte diffusion and charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte boundary. The EIS plots of the Co–Mo LDH, Co–Mo–O, and Co–Mo–S NG electrodes showed straight lines at lower frequency and semicircles in a higher frequency region (Fig. S10†). The charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrode was calculated from the high-frequency semicircles. The Rct value of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode is ∼0.76 Ω, which is significantly lower than those of the Co–Mo LDH (Rct = 1.21 Ω) and Co–Mo–O NS (Rct = 1.93 Ω) electrodes.
According to the steep slope of the straight line, the Co–Mo–S NS electrode exhibits lower diffusive resistance than the Co–Mo LDH and Co–Mo–O NS electrodes at a lower frequency region, which may contribute to enhancing ion diffusion and transport kinetics in the electrode materials.47
A crucial aspect of energy storage devices for real time applications is their long-term cycling performance. This was established for Co–Mo–S NS in a supercapacitor electrode. Fig. 5e shows that the cycling performance of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode was examined via a GCD test for 20000 consecutive cycles at a current density of 12 mA cm−2. The Co–Mo–S NS electrode retains 98.4% and 96.6% of the initial capacitive retention after 10000 and 20000 successive GCD tests, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cycling performance of such a material that showed such outstanding performance, which is suitable for commercial applications as a supercapacitor electrode in a supercapacitive device. The inset of Fig. 5e shows the initial and the last 10 cycles of the test, showing a very systematic cycling GCD with pseudocapacitive behaviour. The coulombic efficiency of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode is calculated from the following eqn (7): (7)where tc is the charging time and td is the discharging time. The coulombic efficiency is ∼98.7%, determined after 20000 cycles. This result demonstrates that the Co–Mo–S NS electrode shows superior cycling performance compared to other ternary metal sulfide nanostructures.12,17 In order to confirm the electrochemical stability of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode, EIS measurements were carried out before and after the 20000 cycling stability test. There was no obvious change in the typical impedance curve before and after the cycling performance test (Fig. 5f). Even after the 20000 cycling test, a well maintained semicircle at the high-frequency region shows the exceptional electrochemical stability and ultra-fast charge/discharge kinetics of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode.48
This exceptional electrochemical stability is further confirmed by the morphological and structural properties of Co–Mo–S NS before and after the stability test. Morphological investigation of the Co–Mo–S NS electrodes tested after 20000 cycles give valuable insights into structural and electrochemical properties. SEM analysis of the Co–Mo–S NS after 20000 continuous charge–discharge cycles shows a lack of structural distortion, i.e., the nanosheets look intact (Fig. S11a and b†). Additional TEM studies confirm no structural change of the intrinsic morphology of the Co–Mo–S NS electrodes (Fig. S11c and d†). The HR-TEM images show that the crystalline features have not altered during repetitive charge/discharge processes. To further understand the change of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode after the cycling performance, CV and EIS studies were carried out. CV was performed for the Co–Mo–S NS electrode before and after 20000 cycles (Fig. S12†), and the oxidation and reduction peak potential of the CV did not change significantly. EIS measurements after the 20000 cycling test show that the Rct value of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode slightly increased from ∼0.76 to ∼0.82 Ω, further demonstrating its exceptional electrochemical stability and ultra-fast charge/discharge kinetics.48 These consequences are due to the strong coupling between the porous 3D Ni foam and Co–Mo–S NS and further demonstrate the great potential of Co–Mo–S NS as supercapacitor electrode materials.
The exceptional supercapacitor performance of the Co–Mo–S NS profit from the following: (1) the conductive Co–Mo–S NS connect directly to the porous 3D Ni foam to act as an assimilated electrode with excellent freeways for ultra-fast ion diffusion and electron transport kinetics, which significantly enhances the charge transfer kinetics of the electrode and electrolyte interface; (2) Co–Mo–S NS possesses interconnected mesoporous architecture, straight grown on 3D Ni foam, which is a perfect platform for the growth of Co–Mo–S NS by effectively eliminating “dead volume” caused by using a polymer binder; the highly porous 3D electrode permits superficial electrolyte ion access for ultra-fast and highly reversible redox reaction processes, showing an improved supercapacitor performance suitable for real time applications; and (3) the unique porous architecture of Co–Mo–S NS is crucial for the outstanding cycling stability of supercapacitor application. In summary, the effective fabrication of a 3D electrode provides multiple advantages that benefit supercapacitive applications.
To further test the Co–Mo–S NS electrode for practical energy storage devices, we assembled an ASC device using the Co–Mo–S NS as the cathode and NGNS as the anode in KOH-PVA electrolyte. It is well known that NGNS is an exceptional energy storage material, which acts as an excellent anode electrode in KOH electrolyte because of its exceptional electrical conductivity, high specific surface area, and outstanding electrochemical stability.49 The NGNS employed in this work was synthesized by a simple and cost-effective technique reported in our previous work.50 As shown in Fig. S13a,† the NGNS possesses a foam-like surface morphology consisting of flake-like features, making it suitable to serve as an anode in the ASC device, in which the NGNS accelerates the transportation of electrolyte ions during charge–discharge processes.51 The TEM image of NGNS show that it consists of highly transparent, continuous, and crumpled layered GNS (Fig. S13b†). Typical XPS spectra of NGNS and detailed explanations are given in Fig. S14.† To investigate the electrochemical performance of the NGNS electrode, tests were carried out in a three-electrode system with 3 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. S15†). The CV curves with different scan rates ranging from 20 to 200 mV s−1 of the NGNS electrode are shown in Fig. S15a.† All CV curves well maintained the rectangular shape without any distortion, suggesting that the ideal capacitive behaviour and fast ion transport takes place in the NGNS. The NGNS electrode showed symmetric charge–discharge performances with ultra-high specific capacitance. As shown in Fig. S15b† are GCD curves with different current densities (1 to 50 A g−1) of NGNS to the prolonged potential window of −1.0 to 0 V, in which hydrogen formation was avoided. The achieved specific capacitance of the NGNS electrode is as high as ∼383 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. At a current density of 50 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the NGNS is ∼287 F g−1, which further demonstrates the superior rate capability. The specific capacitance vs. current density plot of the NGNS is illustrated in Fig. S15c.† The long-term cycling stability of the NGNS exhibits negligible deterioration of the initial capacitance after 20000 consecutive GCD tests at a current density of 12 A g−1 (Fig. S15d†). The consecutive GCD curves of the NGNS from 19991th to the 20 000th cycles are illustrated in the inset of Fig. S15d,† resulting in negligible changes being attained. Moreover, the EIS of the NGNS electrode was investigated before and after the stability test, as shown in Fig. S16.† The EIS study reveals that there is negligible change in an ideal vertical line along the imaginary axis in the low frequency region. This result further confirms that the NGNS electrode is a superior and a highly stable electrode for supercapacitors. Therefore, the NGNS anode material possesses ultra-high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycling life when compared to recently reported nitrogen doped graphene-based anode materials, which is credited to the unique porous architecture and ultra-high surface area of NGNS.52,53 The superior electrochemical performance of the NGNS makes it the best material for the anode in this present research work.
The ASC device was fabricated with Co–Mo–S NS as a cathode, NGNS coated Ni foam as an anode, and KOH-PVA as a solid-state electrolyte (Fig. S17, ESI†). The CVs of NGNS were evaluated at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 with an operating voltage window of −1.0 to 0.0 V. The Co–Mo–S NS were evaluated with an operating voltage window of −0.2 to 0.85 V, as illustrated in Fig. S18.† The selection of the operating potential window (OPW) plays an important role in enhancing the supercapacitive performance of the ASC device. As shown in Fig. S19a,† the CVs of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device are evaluated in different voltage windows in KOH-PVA electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The operating potential window is varied between 0.8 and 1.2 V, and all the curves present triangular features representing the imperfect pseudocapacitive characteristics. However, when the OPW increased to >1.2 V, well-resolved redox behaviour appears in the CV curve, indicating perfect pseudocapacitive performance. When the OPW is further increased from 1.4 V to 1.6 V, the complete redox behaviour with well-resolved oxidation/reduction peaks appeared, indicating that richer redox reactions happen on the electrode surface. To confirm the optimum OPW, the device was tested in GCD with different voltage windows from 0.8 and 1.6 V (Fig. S19b†). When the OPW increased from 0.8 to 1.6 V, the capacitive performance dramatically increased from 65 to 226 F g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1. The overall cell voltage is analogous to the sum of the voltage range of asymmetric supercapacitors; the electrodes during long-term cycling operate safely at up to ∼1.6 V. At an OPW above 1.6 V, an obvious oxygen evolution reaction (OER) may occur. Thus, we chose the OPW of ∼1.6 V to further evaluate the electrochemical performance of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device.
The electrochemical performance of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device was examined by CV and GCD tests. The CVs of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device at various scan rates from 10 to 100 mV s−1 in the optimized potential window of 0 to 1.6 V are shown in Fig. 6a. All CV curves exhibit well-distinct redox peaks, which maintain their characteristics even at a higher scan rate of 100 mV s−1, therefore showing desired pseudocapacitive behaviour. The OPW of ∼1.6 V for the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device is significantly higher than that of the conventional activated carbon based asymmetric supercapacitors (∼1.0 V). This is a significant factor to enhance the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device energy density, bearing in mind that the energy density of the cell is specified by E = 1/2CV2 (where C = specific capacitance; V = cell voltage). The GCD plots at different current densities are shown in Fig. 6b. All GCD curves exhibit almost symmetric charge/discharge curves with negligible voltage drop at different current densities (1 to 25 A g−1), demonstrating exceptional energy storage performance. The calculated specific capacitance (Fig. 6c) of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device based on the total masses of the two electrodes is very high (196 to 252 F g−1). The Co–Mo–S//NGNS device delivers the highest specific capacitance of 252 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Even at a high current density of 25 A g−1, the specific capacitance was maintained at 196 F g−1, indicating that the device holds an excellent rate capability (77.8%). The specific capacitance and rate capability of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device are superior to those of recently reported ternary metal sulfide based ASC devices.12,17,54–56

Fig. 6d shows the validation of the ultra-long cycle life of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS ASC device up to 10000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1, which has not often been established for PVA-KOH solid state electrolyte based ASC devices. The GCD curves of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS ASC device from the 1st to the 10th cycle are shown in Fig. S20† and from the 9991th to the 10000th cycle are illustrated in the inset of Fig. 6d. The data confirm that our device shows minor changes in GCD characteristics. The Co–Mo–S//NGNS device is capable of holding 98.2% and 95.3% of the initial capacitance after 5000 and 10000 successive GCD cycles, respectively. The capacitance value of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device decreased very slowly with cycling performance; however it still retained 86.8% of the initial capacitance even after 50000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles (Fig. S21†). The cycling performance of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device is outstanding when compared to ternary metal sulfide based ASC devices reported recently by Yang et al. (85% retention after 10000 cycles for Ni–Co–S/G//PCNS), Shen et al. (70.4% retention after 10000 cycles for NiCo2S4/NCF//OMC/NCF), Tang et al. (82% retention after 10000 cycles for FeCo2S4//3D PNG), Peng et al. (85.7% retention after 10000 cycles for NiMoO4//AC), (99% retention after 3000 cycles for CoMoO4@NiMoO4//AC), and Wang et al. (98.5% retention after 3000 cycles for Co3O4@CoMoO4//CNTs).12,17,54–57 Results of the cycling performance of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device are superior to those of other metal sulfide based ASC devices. The capacity decline after long continuous charge–discharge cycling testing for the current ASC device is not well understood, but is likely caused by one of the following: (1) the cathodic Co–Mo–S NS electrode may endure material evolution and change to metal hydroxide or oxide because of the severe conditions in the PVA-KOH solid electrolyte, (2) the ultra-fast and ultra-long consecutive charge–discharge tests may lead to delamination of the Co–Mo–S NS electrode from the 3D Ni foam, and (3) the structural morphology of the Co–Mo–S NS with its interconnected architecture may be damaged or altered by the ultra-fast and ultra-long consecutive charge–discharge tests. The electrical conductivity and stability of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device was evaluated by a Nyquist plot, which is shown in Fig. S22.† This Nyquist plot reveals superb electrical conductivity with a very small Rct value of ∼1.61 Ω exposed at a higher frequency region. After 50000 cycling tests, the Rct value of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device is ∼1.98 Ω, which confirms that the device with Co–Mo–S//NGNS maintains its excellent electrical conductivity and ultra-high stability. Such excellent electrical conductivity is due to the unique porous 3D nanostructures that reduce the contact resistance between the electrolyte and electrodes.
The advanced Ragone plots for the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device (energy density vs. power density vs. charge time) are illustrated in Fig. S23.† The Co–Mo–S//NGNS device exhibits an exceptional energy density of ∼89.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.79 kW kg−1, and the reliable charge time is ∼405 s. Even at a high-power density of 20.07 kW kg−1, our device still maintains an energy density as high as ∼69.7 Wh kg−1 within the charging time of ∼12.5 s. As shown in Fig. 6e, the energy density of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device was compared to other stated ternary metal sulfide based ASC devices. The achieved extraordinary energy and power densities of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS device are superior to those of other reported transition metal sulfide based ASC devices (Table S3†). This demonstrates that our ASC device is a potential energy storage device for modern electronics. For example, Yang et al. described a Ni–Co–S/G//PCNS ASC device, accomplishing an energy density of ∼43.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. Shen et al. reported a NiCo2S4/NCF//OMC/NCF asymmetric device with an energy density of ∼45.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 512 W kg−1. Tang et al. reported an FeCo2S4//3D PNG device with an energy density of ∼76.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 755 W kg−1. Peng et al. reported a NiMoO4//AC ASC device with an energy density of ∼60.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 850 W kg−1. Wang et al. presented a Co3O4@CoMoO4//CNT device with an energy density of ∼45.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1.12,17,54–56 The ultra-high energy and power densities of our Co–Mo–S//NGNS device with very little charging time are promising for electronics devices in industrial applications.
The stability and long term charge storage capacity of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS ASC device were investigated by the self-discharge technique. This was performed by charging the ASC device to 1.6 V and then holding the device at open-circuit voltage for 22 h. As shown in Fig. 6f, the voltage decays faster during the initial time period; however it stabilizes over time, reaching a constant value. The output voltage of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS ASC device reached ∼1.35 V after 14 h. This result confirms that the Co–Mo–S//NGNS ASC device displays low self-discharge processes, which is a crucial requirement for a practical energy storage device in industrial sectors. The practical applicability of Co–Mo–S//NGNS is also demonstrated by making a green LED glow (∼1.2 V, 20 mA) as shown in the inset of Fig. 6f. The ASC device fabricated with Co–Mo–S//NGNS holds a high voltage when compared to other reported devices. Therefore, we believe that the Co–Mo–S ultra-thin NS fabricated with this simple and cost-effective technique has great potential for real time supercapacitive applications.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed porous nanoarchitectures consisting of ultra-thin Co–Mo–S NS, which are supported on porous 3D Ni foam. The material has been successfully fabricated via a simple and cost-effective hydrothermal synthesis combined with sulfurization techniques. Co–Mo–S NS possesses ultra-high electronic conductivity, and the Co–Mo–S NS/3D Ni foam can be directly used as a high-performance electrode for supercapacitors without any binder or conducting additives. Due to the unique porous architecture of the ultra-thin Co–Mo–S NS, the electrode based on the as-prepared Co–Mo–S NS showed ultrahigh specific capacitance (2343 F g−1 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2) with an exceptional rate capability (1717 F g−1 at a current density of 50 mA cm−2), as well as an outstanding cycling performance (96.61% capacitance retention after a 20000 cycle test). The electrochemical performance of the Co–Mo–S NS is significantly higher than those of recently reported ternary metal sulfide based electrodes for supercapacitor applications. The fabricated Co–Mo–S//NGNS ASC device showed an ultra-high energy density (∼89.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.79 kW kg−1), and excellent power density (20.07 kW kg−1) with short charge time, and an ultra-long cycling life. The electrochemical performance of the Co–Mo–S//NGNS ASC device has exceeded those of previously reported ternary metal sulfide-based ASC devices and those of other ASC devices. This leads us to propose that the Co–Mo–S NS are suitable electrodes to design high-performance supercapacitors. This current technique can be extended to fabricate other ternary metal sulfides with ultra-high electrochemical performance for energy storage and conversion devices such as supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells.
