    , Accepted 13th December 2021First published on 14th December 2021AbstractWe used dual nonfullerene acceptors Y6:FINIC with 3D charge transport features and polymer donor PM6 to fabricate sequential-process heterojunction (SHJ) and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). FINIC has good compatibility with PM6 and Y6, facilitating efficient charge transport. It enhances photon absorption and electron transport, and reduces non-radiative recombination loss, contributing to increased VOC, JSC and FFs in both SHJ and BHJ OSCs. Moreover, the SHJ film has a more uniform FINIC vertical distribution and more PM6 at the bottom part of the films relative to the BHJ film, warranting better charge transport and collection. Finally, the SHJ OSCs based on Y6:FINIC yield power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 17.8%, higher than that of the BHJ counterpart (16.9%). Both SHJ and BHJ devices based on Y6:FINIC dual acceptors show higher PCEs than Y6-based binary OSCs (16.3% for the SHJ and 16.0% for the BHJ) and FINIC-based binary OSCs (13.4% for SHJ and 13.1% for BHJ).
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising clean and renewable energy technology to convert solar radiation into electricity, since they have several advantages, such as low production cost, flexibility, semitransparency and light weight and have potential applications in wearable devices, power-generating windows and the internet of things.1–3 The advent of fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs),4 such as ITIC5 and Y6,6 has led to the re-birth of this field; power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of fullerene-based OSCs were previously limited to ∼11–12%, and now based on FREAs PCEs of >18% have been achieved.7–29 Aside from materials invention, the innovation of device fabrication methods, such as bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)30,31 and sequential-process heterojunction (SHJ)32–36 technologies, also made great contribution to the development of OSCs. For instance, FREA-based SHJ structures show long-range energy transfer and long exciton diffusion lengths.37
Introducing a third component into a binary blend can improve the PCEs of OSCs. The third component can enhance the absorption of the binary blend to increase short-circuit current density (JSC), tune the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of the donor or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of the acceptor to guarantee efficient exciton splitting, reduce energy loss and improve the open-circuit voltage (VOC), and optimize the film morphology to increase the fill factor (FF).38,39 For instance, some groups introduced ITIC and its analogs (ITICs) into the PM6:Y6 blend to enhance photovoltaic performance;40–43 the highest PCE of BHJ ternary devices based on PM6:Y6:ITICs is 17.52%,40 while the highest PCE of SHJ ternary devices based on PM6:Y6:ITICs is 16.4%.43
The advantages of SHJs over BHJs include the following: donor/acceptor layers can be independently controlled and optimal vertical phase separation for charge extraction can be realized through changing the donor/acceptor deposition sequence. However, the SHJ structure has a larger domain size than the BHJ blend, which is unfavorable for exciton dissociation.37 Moreover, separated free charges need to diffuse a longer distance before reaching the buffer layers to be collected by the electrodes. Therefore, it is vital to introduce components with long exciton diffusion lengths and high charge mobility into SHJ cells.
Here, we use our previously reported nonfullerene acceptor FINIC44 with a high exciton diffusion constant and electron mobility as a third component to construct SHJ and BHJ OSCs using PM6:Y6:FINIC (Fig. 1a) as an active layer based on the following considerations: (1) FINIC has strong absorption complemented with those of PM6 and Y6 (Fig. 1b), which is beneficial for higher JSC; (2) FINIC has a suitable HOMO/LUMO well aligned with those of PM6 and Y6 (Fig. 1c and S1†), which is beneficial for reduced energy loss and higher VOC; (3) FINIC has a high 3D exciton diffusion coefficient (3 × 10−2 cm2 s−1), which is beneficial for efficient exciton splitting; (4) FINIC has high electron mobilities both in vertical (8.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and horizontal (2.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) directions, which is beneficial for a higher FF; (5) both FINIC and Y6 (ref. 45) have 3D stacking, ensuring good compatibility with Y6 and a homogeneous vertical distribution of FINIC. Finally, SHJ OSCs based on PM6:Y6:FINIC with 25% content of FINIC in acceptors yield a champion PCE of 17.8%, higher than that of their BHJ counterpart (16.9%). The PCE of 17.8% is higher than that of the reported best SHJ ternary devices based on PM6:Y6:ITICs (16.4%).43

Results and discussion
Both SHJ and BHJ devices with a normal structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al were fabricated. The fabrication details are provided in the ESI.† The optimal FINIC content in the acceptor component is 25% (w/w) (Table S1†), and the optimal additive 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) content is 0.15% (v/v) (Table S2†). The VOC of SHJ OSCs increases from 0.858 V to 0.925 V as the FINIC weight ratio increases from 0 to 100%. JSC first increases then decreases as the FINIC weight ratio increases from 0 to 100%, and JSC reaches the highest value when the FINIC weight ratio is 25%. All FF values of the SHJ devices exceed 70% (Table S1†). When the FINIC weight ratio is 25%, the SHJ ternary devices yield the best PCE of 17.8%, with a VOC of 0.887 V, JSC of 26.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.7% (Fig. 2a, Table 1). Additionally, BHJ OSCs were also fabricated under the optimized conditions (Fig. S2a†). The VOC, JSC and FF show a trend similar to those in SHJ devices (Table S3†), and the BHJ ternary devices yield the best PCE of 16.9% (Table 1). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2b and S2b.† The JSC values of Y6-, Y6:FINIC- and FINIC-based SHJ/BHJ cells calculated by integrating the EQE spectra are 24.7/24.5, 25.5/25.1 and 19.2/19.0 mA cm−2, respectively, similar to those obtained from the J–V measurements (mismatch < 5%).

The exciton generation, dissociation and charge extraction properties of the solar cells were studied via measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the solar cells (Fig. S3a†). The JSC/Jsat ratio (where Jsat is the saturation Jph) characterizes the charge extraction efficiency under a short-circuit condition. The JSC/Jsat values of the optimized SHJ/BHJ OSCs based on Y6, Y6:FINIC and FINIC acceptors are 0.97/0.95, 0.97/0.95 and 0.98/0.97, respectively. Both the SHJ and the BHJ devices show highly efficient charge generation, dissociation and collection efficiencies. The charge recombination mechanism in the solar cells was studied via measuring the dependence of JSC on the illumination density (P) (Fig. S3b†). The relationship between JSC and P can be described as JSC ∝ Pα.46 The α values of the Y6-, Y6:FINIC- and FINIC-based SHJ/BHJ devices are 0.96/0.94, 0.98/0.95 and 0.96/0.94, respectively, suggesting negligible bimolecular charge recombination in both the ternary and the binary devices under a short-circuit condition.
The charge mobilities were estimated using a space charge limited current (SCLC)47 method. For the acceptor films, the electron mobilities of Y6, FINIC and Y6:FINIC are 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 8.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S4†). The electron mobility of FINIC is 3 times higher than that of Y6, and the electron mobility of the Y6:FINIC film is 1.7 times higher than that of Y6, indicating that the use of FINIC leads to increased electron mobility in the blend film of Y6:FINIC. For the binary and the ternary films, the SHJ films exhibit higher hole and electron mobilities as compared with the corresponding BHJ blends, and the μh/μe ratios of the SHJ blends are closer to 1, which can be interpreted as the reason for the higher FF in the SHJ devices. The electron mobilities of the SHJ and BHJ ternary blends are both higher than those of their Y6-based binary blends (Table S4†), manifesting that FINIC enhances the electron transport properties in the ternary blends.
We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the surface morphology of the SHJ and BHJ blends (Fig. S5†). Both the SHJ and BHJ show a smooth surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 0.99 to 1.57 nm. To obatin the molecular packing information, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to study the pristine (Fig. S6†), binary and ternary films (Fig. 3). For the pristine films, PM6 shows a lamellar stacking peak at 0.29 Å−1 and a π–π stacking peak at 1.68 Å−1. FINIC shows a strong lamellar stacking peak at 0.29 Å−1 and a π–π stacking peak at 1.78 Å−1. The Y6 film shows lamellar and backbone stacking peaks at 0.28 and 0.42 Å−1, respectively, and a strong π–π stacking peak at 1.74 Å−1.48 The Y6:FINIC (0.75:0.25, w/w) film shows lamellar and backbone stacking peaks at 0.28 and 0.40 Å−1, respectively, and a strong π–π stacking peak at 1.75 Å−1, similar to that of Y6. These results verify that FINIC has good compatibility with Y6. Furthermore, contact angle (Fig. S7†) and surface tension (γ) measurements were also performed to investigate the miscibility of the two acceptors. γ values of FINIC and Y6 are 36.3 and 33.7 mN m−1, respectively. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) can be calculated from γ;49 a smaller χ implies better miscibility of the two components. The χ value between FINIC and Y6 is 0.0483, indicating good miscibility of the two acceptors, which shows good agreement with GIWAXS data. The d-spacing value and the coherence length (CL)50 of the pristine films are summarized in Table S5.† The d-spacing value of Y6:FINIC (3.59 Å) is smaller than that of Y6 (3.61 Å), indicating tighter molecular packing, which enhances the charge transport, as evidenced by SCLC results (Table S4†). Both Y6 and Y6:FINIC pristine films show similar CL (2.5 nm).

For the binary blends, both the Y6- and the FINIC-based binary films present a strong out-of-plane π–π stacking (q ≈ 1.73 Å−1), originating from the Y6 and the FINIC pristine phases. The ternary blends show lamellar stacking and π–π stacking similar to the Y6-based binary blend (Table S5†), which suggests that FINIC has good compatibility with PM6 and Y6. All the binary and ternary films exhibit a preferential face-on orientation (Fig. 3). The d-spacing values of the Y6-based ternary blends (3.61 Å for SHJ and 3.60 Å for BHJ) are smaller than those of the corresponding binary blends (3.63 Å for the SHJ and 3.65 Å for the BHJ), indicating that the introduction of FINIC leads to more compact molecular packing, contributing to an improved charge transport property, which was confirmed by the higher SCLC electron mobility (Table S4†). The CL of the ternary blends is the same as that of the Y6-based binary blends (Table S5†).
To investigate the composition and exciton distributions within photovoltaic devices, we use film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy to study the vertical phase separation in the BHJ and the SHJ films. The in situ film-depth-dependent light absorption spectra (FLAS) were measured through a method described in our previous report.51 From FLAS, the film-depth-dependent composition distribution can be numerically extracted. According to Fig. 4a, e and i, the FLAS of Y6-based binary SHJ, ternary SHJ and ternary BHJ films show that FINIC is homogenously distributed within the ternary films along the vertical direction, meaning that FINIC has good compatibility with PM6 and Y6, as also evidenced by GIWAXS (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4b and f, Y6 is mainly distributed at the middle part of the binary and ternary SHJ films, and more PM6 was found at the top and less PM6 at the bottom part of the binary film relative to its ternary counterpart, manifesting that FINIC plays an important role in controlling the PM6 vertical phase distribution. It is found that the SHJ film has more PM6 at the bottom part of the film relative to the BHJ film (Fig. 4f and j), warranting good hole transport properties, which is evidenced by the SCLC results (Table S4†). Interestingly, from 10 to 90 nm depth along the vertical direction within the film, FINIC shows a uniform distribution with a weight ratio around 0.12–0.15 (w/w) in the SHJ film (Fig. 4f). However, the FINIC weight ratio firstly decreases from 0.18 (10 nm depth) to 0.10 (60 nm depth), and then increases to 0.13 at 90 nm depth in the BHJ film (Fig. 4j), indicating that FINIC is more controllable in the SHJ film relative to the BHJ film.

The noise-like features in the contours are due to the solar AM 1.5 G real spectrum. 

Fig. 4c, g and k show the distribution of excitons within the photovoltaic devices which is numerically simulated from the FLAS in combination with a modified transfer-matrix optical model.51 The excitons are mainly generated at the center and the bottom of the blend films, and Y6 with an absorption edge around 800 nm contributes more to the exciton generation relative to PM6 with an absorption edge around 600 nm, which agrees well with the composition distribution extracted from FLAS. According to Fig. 4d, h and l, the maximum exciton generation rates are found at ca. 50, 50 and 60 nm depths for the SHJ binary, the SHJ ternary and the BHJ ternary films, respectively. This means that after exciton dissociation, the electrons need to travel across a long distance from the bottom part of the active layer toward the PDINO/cathode, which therefore largely risks the charge recombination, and require high mobility to avoid recombination. The higher charge mobilities synchronically induced by FINIC in combination with Y6 are favorable for such long-length electron transport, leading to decreased recombination (vide infra), higher JSC and FFs in the ternary solar cells (Table 1). Apparently, the higher FINIC distribution in the middle of the SHJ ternary film relative to the BHJ ternary film is more favorable for charge transport, which shows good agreement with the higher JSC and FF (Table 1).
To gain more insight into the effect of FINIC on the VOC of the ternary devices, we measured the energy loss values (Eloss = qΔV = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3) for both the SHJ and the BHJ devices (Table S6†).52,53 The Eg values of Y6-, Y6:FINIC- and FINIC-based cells are 1.351, 1.356 and 1.532 eV, respectively, which are calculated from the absorption edge of the acceptors, because the acceptors have a lower bandgap compared to the polymer donor PM6 (Fig. S8†).54 The VOC,sq of the Y6-, the Y6:FINIC- and the FINIC-based cells are 1.099, 1.101 and 1.266 V, respectively, which are obtained using Shockley–Queisser theory.55 In the SHJ cells, the ΔE1 values of the Y6- and the Y6:FINIC-based devices are 0.252 eV and 0.255 eV, respectively, which are calculated from the equation: ΔE1 = Eg − qVOC,sq.53 ΔE2 is evaluated by measuring the electroluminescence (EL) (Fig. 5a) and sensitive EQE spectra (Fig. 5b) of the solar cells. The ΔE2 values of the Y6- and the Y6:FINIC-based devices are 0.017 eV and 0.002 eV, respectively. The ΔE3 is quantified by measuring the EQEEL of the solar cells, using the equation ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL).52 According to Fig. 5c and Table S6,† the EQEEL values for the Y6- and the Y6:FINIC-based devices are 1.3 × 10−4 and 2.1 × 10−4, respectively, yielding ΔE3 values of 0.224 eV and 0.212 eV, respectively. Finally, the Y6:FINIC-based ternary devices show lower energy loss (0.469 eV) than the Y6-based binary devices (0.493 eV) (Table S6†). The introduction of FINIC effectively reduces the energy loss of the solar cells, especially the radiative and non-radiative recombination loss, leading to a higher VOC for the ternary devices. Furthermore, the same trend is found for the BHJ devices (Table S6†). From the energy loss analysis, we found that ΔE1 and ΔE3 are the major sources for the energy loss in both the SHJ and the BHJ systems, and the use of FINIC effectively reduces ΔE3, contributing to higher VOC in ternary OSC systems.

Conclusions
In summary, we used dual nonfullerene acceptors Y6:FINIC with 3D charge transport features to fabricate SHJ and BHJ OSCs based on a polymer donor PM6. FINIC has good compatibility with PM6 and Y6, guaranteeing efficient spatial charge transport. The introduction of FINIC leads to tighter molecular packing and increased electron mobilities. When the FINIC weight ratio is 25% in the acceptor component, the SHJ and BHJ OSCs yield the best PCEs of 17.8% and 16.9%, respectively, higher than those of the corresponding Y6-based binary cells (16.3%/SHJ and 16.0%/BHJ). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 17.8% is the highest for OSCs based on PM6:Y6:ITICs ternary systems. The introduction of FINIC simultaneously increases VOC, JSC and the FF in both the SHJ and the BHJ OSCs, because (i) the higher LUMO energy level of FINIC than Y6 and reduced non-radiative recombination loss contribute to a higher VOC; (ii) the introduction of FINIC leads to enhanced photon absorption and electron transport, contributing to a higher JSC; (iii) increased electron mobility and more balanced hole/electron transport contribute to a higher FF. Furthermore, SHJ films have more uniform vertical distribution of FINIC and more PM6 at the bottom part of the films relative to BHJ films, warranting better hole transport and collection. As a result, the SHJ OSCs yield higher PCEs than the BHJ devices.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Chemical structures (a), thin-film absorption spectra (b), and energy levels (c) of PM6, FINIC and Y6.	 

 	Fig. 2  
J–V characteristics (a) and EQE spectra (b) of the best SHJ OSCs under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2.	 


SHJ	Y6	0.858 (0.857 ± 0.003)	25.8 (26.0 ± 0.3)	73.5 (72.4 ± 1.5)	16.3 (16.1 ± 0.2)
SHJ	0.75Y6:0.25FINIC	0.887 (0.881 ± 0.006)	26.8 (26.7 ± 0.5)	74.7 (74.0 ± 1.6)	17.8 (17.4 ± 0.4)
SHJ	FINIC	0.925 (0.927 ± 0.004)	19.5 (19.9 ± 0.4)	74.4 (72.3 ± 2.0)	13.4 (13.3 ± 0.3)
BHJ	0.75Y6:0.25FINIC	0.886 (0.884 ± 0.009)	26.2 (26.5 ± 0.6)	72.8 (71.3 ± 1.7)	16.9 (16.7 ± 0.3)

 	Fig. 3  2D GIWAXS patterns for (a) PM6/Y6 SHJ, (b) PM6/Y6:FINIC SHJ, (c) PM6/FINIC SHJ, (d) PM6:Y6 BHJ, (e) PM6:Y6:FINIC BHJ, and (f) PM6:FINIC BHJ films, and (g) 1D line-cuts for the above blended films.	 

 	Fig. 4  Film-depth-dependent profiling of Y6-based binary SHJ (a–d), ternary SHJ (e–h) and ternary BHJ films (i–l). (a, e and i) Film-dependent light absorption spectra. The spectra are vertically re-aligned for clarity. The light absorption peak at around wavelength 450 nm at the film top surface is due to PDINO. (b, f and j) Composition distribution as a function of film depth. (c, g and k) Exciton generation contours as numerically simulated from (a), (e) and (i), respectively. (d, h and l) Film-depth-dependent exciton generation rates as obtained by integration of (c), (g) and (k) along the wavelength direction. 0 nm represents the interface between the active layer and PDINO, while 100 nm represents the interface between PEDOT:PSS and the active layer. The noise-like features in the contours are due to the solar AM 1.5 G real spectrum.	 

 	Fig. 5  Normalized EL, sEQE, and EQEEL spectra of SHJ devices (a–c) and BHJ devices (d–f).
