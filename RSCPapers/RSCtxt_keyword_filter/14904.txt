Herein, we report a flexible perovskite solar cell based on a metal substrate. It showed a power conversion efficiency of over 6% for the first time using a silver thin film as a semi-transparent top electrode on a Ti substrate.
Organo-metal halide perovskite solar cells, a new generation of all-solid-state solar cells, have received a great deal of attention owing to their superior power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 19% with simple fabrication processes.1–5 One of the most prevalent structures of perovskite solar cells comprises TiO2 layers with a perovskite layer for the sensitizer, a hole transfer layer (HTL), and a metal layer, such as gold (Au) or silver (Ag), for the top electrode.6,7 However, such a structure requires high-temperature conditions, above 450 °C, in order to prepare the TiO2 films, and this restricts their compatibility with a wide range of applications, where such films are embedded in polymer-based flexible substrates,8,9 which is an issue that dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have faced. To overcome this issue in DSSCs, various methods have been attempted such as low-temperature sintering,10,11 pressure-assisted working electrode preparation,12,13 or hydrothermal crystallization.14 Although the abovementioned methods could facilitate the fabrication of a flexible substrate, low efficiencies are the main obstacles for various further applications because of the charge recombination at imperfect interfaces between the TiO2 nanoparticles and the conductive substrate, as well as between TiO2 nanoparticles.15,16 Moreover, there are many disadvantages for applying indium tin oxide (ITO) in solar cells such as brittleness, chemical instability under acidic or basic conditions, and the high cost of indium. Therefore, devices with ITO electrodes are unsuitable for commercialization in terms of providing a cost-effective and flexible system.17–19
Metal substrates can be a viable alternative to ITO-PET substrates, offering advantages such as high-temperature control without the use of expensive ITO.20 In order to adopt metal substrates for perovskite solar cells, a transparent top electrode with high lateral conductivity to collect charge carriers is required. Recently, some results using an ultra-thin metal film (UTMF) as a semi-transparent electrode have been reported for solar cells21,22 and tandem devices.23
Herein, we demonstrate organo-metal halide perovskite solar cells on Ti substrates, for the first time, using a semi-transparent UTMF. Flexible and ITO-free hybrid perovskite solar cells on metallic supporting substrates have reached a high power conversion efficiency of 6.15%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.889 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.5 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.728 under standard AM1.5 conditions, which is the first report for solid-state perovskite solar cells on metal substrates. Moreover, remarkable efficiency was maintained when the devices were bent 100 times. This novel approach, in combination with high-efficiency hybrid perovskite solar cells, represents an important milestone for low-cost fabrication on a large scale with a roll-to-roll process. The flexible perovskite solar cells were prepared on 127 μm thick Ti foil with UTMF as a semi-transparent top electrode. A dense TiO2 layer was deposited on a Ti substrate by spray pyrolysis, followed by TiCl4 treatment and annealing in a furnace. A mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) film was deposited on the abovementioned film by spin-coating, and annealed in a furnace. A CH3NH3PbI3 solution was spin coated with toluene dripping during spin-coating to produce a highly uniform thin film, which was subsequently maintained on a hot plate. Following the CH3NH3PbI3 film deposition, spiro-MeOTAD as the HTL was applied by spin-coating. The device was completed by the thermal evaporation of various thicknesses of thin Ag films as the top electrode. The full device fabrication procedure and characterization are provided in the ESI.†
A few reports of perovskite photovoltaics using UTMF on glass substrates were recently reported for constructing semi-transparent solar cells. The authors designed semi-transparent perovskite photovoltaics with relatively high efficiencies through the use of islands or a thinner light-absorbing layer and a thin metal film as the top electrode, which facilitated the extension of this new technology to the other areas of solar cell research. The schematic illustration for our experiment, integrating perovskite solar cells into a metal substrate using a UTMF for cathode-side illumination, is shown in Fig. 1(a). To utilize perovskite materials on a metal substrate, the UTMF was introduced as the top semi-transparent electrode by a simple thermal evaporation procedure. The regular fabrication procedure for a conventional structure24 was applied for layers other than the bottom substrate and the thickness of the top electrode. The prototype of a metal-based flexible perovskite solar cell with a UTMF and its cross-sectional image are provided in Fig. S1† and 1(b), respectively. In order to see a cross-sectional view of the structure, a focused ion beam with Ga ions was applied with 30 kV. Since the Ti substrate was not cut as a glass substrate, the Ga ion beam etched the structure until a cross-sectional view could be obtained at a tilted angle. While milling the thin film, the Ag layer was damaged by the highly kinetic Ga ion source. Therefore, the thin Ag layer does not look continuous, and thickened islands appeared, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The top view of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the TiO2/Ti substrate is shown in Fig. S2.† The highly uniform perovskite film was observed using fast crystallization-deposition method recently reported.24,25 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the TiO2/FTO substrate is shown in Fig. S3.† Intense diffraction peaks at 14.10, 28.43, and 31.86 are assigned to the (110), (220), and (310) diffractions, respectively, of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 phase treated at 100 °C.26 In order to measure the amount of light that penetrated through the UTMF, the transmittance was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 2(b), with a schematic image of the UTMF/spiro-MeOTAD layer on bare glass [Fig. 2(a)]. In the case of the spiro-MeOTAD-only film on glass, no noticeable decrease in transmittance was observed. When an 8 nm-thick silver layer was added, there was a 24–45% decrease in transmittance at wavelengths of 450–750 nm [Fig. 2(c)]. Note that effective absorption occurs in this region [Fig. 2(d)]. Fig. 3 shows the cell performance statistics of devices with different thicknesses of the Ag layer from 8 to 20 nm. As seen in the transmittance data, an Ag layer more than 16 nm thick significantly lowered the transmitted light. From the transmittance, a thicker Ag layer may reduce the Jsc value. The 8 nm-thick film shows a very low efficiency of less than 1%, which could be due to the conducting film quality such as non-continuity over the area observed and the corresponding high resistance.23 When a 12 nm thick Ag film was used as the collecting electrode, it showed the highest efficiency of 6.15%.

Although the highest efficiency was obtained from the device with an Ag thickness of 12 nm, the cell performance still showed high variance. The variance decreased when a thicker Ag film was prepared. Evidently, the thickness of the Ag layer controls the number of photons penetrating into the active layer and the collecting ability. The Ag film thickness clearly affects the Jsc values. When a thicker film was applied, lower Jsc values were observed. The highest cell performance and corresponding IPCE are shown in Fig. 4. In contrast to metal substrate cells, FTO-glass-based perovskite solar cells with the same UTMF top electrodes were investigated for reference. The I–V curves and the photovoltaic parameters of perovskite solar cells using a UTMF on glass substrates with illumination from the FTO glass side (front) and the UTMF side (back) are represented in Fig. 5(a) and Table S1,† respectively. The results show a higher efficiency of 8.32% in the case of front illumination as compared to 5.54% when illuminated through the back side. A main reason for this difference in performance might be due to an inequality in the amount of photon flux. We also checked the effect of reflection for perovskite photovoltaics on glass substrates by adding a Ti substrate at the back of the FTO-glass side. First, the I–V curve for a conventional structure on FTO-glass-based cells was obtained with back illumination, and the same cells with a Ti substrate for back scattering were investigated, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The photovoltaic performance was characterized by Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE obtained from the I–V curves, and these parameters are summarized in Table 1. No significant differences for Voc and FF were observed with the change in the incident light direction. However, the Jsc of 9.8 mA cm−2 for perovskite solar cells with Ti substrate at the back was slightly higher than that of the device without the substrate (9.2 mA cm−2). The enhancement of the Jsc value might be due to the increased light harvesting from reflection by the Ti substrate. Furthermore, extended bending tests in batches of sixteen devices were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The average performances of the devices did not significantly deteriorate over 100 bending cycles at a bending radius of ∼6 mm. Approximately 98.5% of the efficiency from the beginning value was retained, which demonstrates considerable stability,27 compared with ITO based flexible photovoltaic cells, for roll-to-roll processing for mass production.

Conclusions
We have prepared perovskite solar cells on Ti substrates with a thin layer of Ag as a semi-transparent top electrode. The simplicity of the fabrication procedure can lower manufacturing costs and widen the applications of the procedure to flexible devices without the use of ITO/FTO. The metal-based perovskite solar cells exhibited a remarkably high performance of 6.15%, with impressive bending stability.
