    , Accepted 21st March 2022First published on 23rd March 2022AbstractRing-opening metathesis polymerization is employed to copolymerize a C60-functionalized norbornene monomer and its alkyl substituted analog, yielding a range of fullerene-grafted polynorbornene copolymers with varying fullerene-contents. High control over the comonomer built-in ratio is demonstrated and subsequently used to correlate thermal and electronical properties to the fullerene content of the copolymers. While previous works on fullerene-grafted polymers reported high glass transition temperatures and low electron mobilities, we show relatively low and controllable glass transition temperatures between Tg = 16.8 °C and Tg = 145.9 °C. Full suppression of fullerene crystallization is confirmed, while achieving outstanding bulk electron mobilities up to μe = 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Introduction
The carbon allotrope fullerene C60 and its derivatives are known for their capability to accept and subsequently transport electrons.1,2 Those compounds were thus the focus of attention in vast research fields, including organic photovoltaics,3 field-effect transistors,4 thermoelectrics,5 as well as bioelectronics.6 In this context, fullerenes fill an important gap in the minute portfolio of high-performing stable acceptor materials.7
Blends of the C60-derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and donor polymers are feasible and are established active layer materials in OPV applications. The resulting devices are capable of absorbing light and generating charges with a power conversion efficiency of up to 9.2% for binary PCBM containing blends.8,9 Recently, OPV research experienced a shift from binary PCBM containing systems towards blends, utilizing highly efficient non-fullerene acceptor materials, as well as low bandgap donor–acceptor-polymers. Often, derivatives of C60 and C70 still are added, which elucidates the persistent relevance of fullerene compounds for electron transport in OPV research.10
Further, functionalized fullerene compounds, doped with the hydride donor n-DMBI, were shown to exhibit a high electron conductivity, making them viable for organic thermoelectric applications, as well as electron transporting layers in perovskite solar cells.11,12 By tuning the hydrophilicity of the substituent, the host–dopant interaction and thus, the thermoelectric power factor and figure of merit can be influenced.13 One drawback of fullerenes in respect to the beforementioned applications is their low solubility, combined with a high affinity towards diffusion and crystallization, often leading to challenging processing and the formation of nanocrystals in operando.14 This subsequently can alter the optimized device morphology, especially in blends, and reduce long-time stability.15–17 Those problems were partially addressed in the past by various chemical modifications of fullerenes: To increase the solubility of C60, a variety of substituted fullerene-based materials were designed.18–21 The benefit of these modifications is apparent, considering that for most applications functionalized compounds are preferred over unfunctionalized C60, even though substitution of the fullerene using alkyl or solubilising groups can be considered to be a dilution of the electronically active structural unit. The significance of this trade-off is noticeable, if reported maximum OFET electron mobilities of unsubstituted C60 (μe-max = 5–11 cm2 V−1 s−1)22–24 and a common substituted derivative, PCBM (μe-max = 0.05–0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1)4,25 are compared. The increased solubility of derivatives in organic solvents facilitates solution processing and eases incorporation in blend systems. However, in these functionalized fullerenes, diffusion and crystallization are not fully suppressed, thus still making them not optimal for long-time operation stability.26,27
To increase morphological stability and hence device lifetime, fullerenes were attached to various polymer backbones in the past. Based on AFM and XRD investigations, Bao et al., as well as our group demonstrated suppression of crystallization, caused by a substantially reduced C60 diffusion.28,29 Further, attachment to a polymer backbone gives access to block copolymer approaches to control microphase morphology, domain size, and phase stability in donor–acceptor block copolymers.30–32 Polymer solubility, among other properties, was either controlled by incorporation of different spacers into the monomer, or by the copolymerization of two differently functionalized comonomers. Similar to the beforementioned molecular fullerene derivatives, grafting of fullerenes to a polymer backbone is associated with a dilution of the electrochemically active chromophore. Consequently, Bao et al. reported a relatively low OFET electron mobility of μe-max = 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for fullerene-grafted polymers.33 Our group determined a bulk SCLC mobility of μe-max = 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for C60-grafted poly(methoxy styrene) copolymers.29
In previous works, we investigated the relations between fullerene content and material properties, for C60 and C70 grafted poly(methoxy styrene) copolymers synthesized via a grafting-to approach.30,34 A correlation between the fullerene content and electrochemical, as well as thermal properties of the polymers was elucidated. However, the glass transition temperature Tg of these fullerene-grafted poly(methoxy styrene) copolymers increased drastically with fullerene content. E.g., for a polymer even with a relatively low C60 content of 30 wt%, a high Tg of about 144 °C was observed. The Tg value increases to 200 °C for 51 wt% fullerene content. Even though these high Tg values may help to prevent the segmental motion of the polymer (at temperatures below Tg) and therefore the diffusion of fullerenes to one another, there are many processing issues associated with high Tg polymers. For example, annealing block copolymers consisting of these fullerene polymers above these high Tg values (to crystallize the second block), can lead to dewetting and thus processing difficulties of thin-film devices. It is also a fundamental scientific question of interest, if the Tg and therefore the backbone segmental motion of a fullerene grafted polymer can be tuned to well below 150 °C without triggering fullerene diffusion and crystallization. Moreover, the dependence of overall bulk electron mobility (μe) on Tg values of low Tg copolymers is unknown. The μe in high Tg copolymers poly(methoxy styrene) copolymers were low, ranging from 10−5 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for fullerene content between 30 and 51 wt%. For thin-film electronic applications requiring thermal treatment (annealing, drying step in printing, etc.), tuneable Tg and high bulk μe values are required. Additionally, control in material design is desirable, e.g., to influence the sequence of solidification upon cooling a blend or block copolymer. Therefore, we aim to reach low range Tg systems, in which we can study the influence of the nature of the backbone moiety as well as comonomer on both glass transition temperatures and bulk electron mobility.
For this, the relatively high Tg (100–120 °C) poly(methoxy styrene)-backbone in earlier reports is replaced in this work with a lower Tg (40–50 °C) polynorbornene backbone and amorphous comonomers with branched alkyl substituents were employed. It has been reported that norbornene-functionalized fullerenes can be used to prepare C60-grafted polymers via living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP).31,33,35 However, detailed investigations of thermal and electronical properties were rarely conducted in previous studies focussing on synthesis. Such a detailed study is required to elucidate structure–property relation and for material design principles required for a specific application. In ROMP, fullerenes are unaffected by the state-of-the-art ruthenium catalysts used for norbornene polymerization. Further, this controlled and direct grafting-through copolymerization approach of norbornene monomers carrying fullerene moieties or alkyl substituents excludes uncertainties regarding the efficacy of polymer analogous reaction reported earlier. Here we report four fullerene-carrying copolymers and the precise control over the C60 content is shown, based on complementary analytical methods, followed by correlation of the material properties to the fullerene content. By comparison with the reported poly(methoxy styrene)-based fullerene-grafted copolymers, the strong influence of the polymer backbone on the thermal properties is demonstrated. Moreover, record high bulk electron mobilities were achieved in these amorphous copolymers which are not prone to crystallization on annealing. These factors favour morphological stability in thin-film devices.
Discussion
Synthesis strategy
In this work, a grafting-through copolymerization of two functionalized norbornene-monomers, (5-norbornenyl)methyl phenyl-C61-butanecarboxylate PCB-Nb and (5-norbornenyl)methyl 2-hexyldecanoate Alk-Nb is employed, to introduce differently functionalized side chains of distinct desired concentrations. In contrast to polymer analogous grafting-to strategies, quantitative functionalization of the polymer repeating units can be ensured here. The direct chemical environment of the polymerizable monomer site plays a decisive role for the polymerization kinetics, as was shown by the group of Grubbs, as well as Troya and Matson et al.36,37 This structural influence was considered to design monomers with similar polymerization rates to obtain polymers with statistical built-in sequence. As depicted in Fig. 1(a), both comonomers are based on 5-norbornene-2-methanol, covalently connected through ester linkages to the respective functional group, which are a fullerene for the monomer PCB-Nb and a branched alkyl chain for the monomer Alk-Nb. For PCB-Nb, a short alkyl spacer, as well as a terminal phenyl group are selected to enhance the fullerene segment mobility, have comparability with PCBM, and sufficient solubility in organic solvents. The C15-alkyl substituent of the second monomer Alk-Nb is ought to enhance the solubility of the copolymer as well as effect a low Tg. A branched motif was chosen to prevent crystallization of the alkyl chain.

Monomer synthesis
The branched alkyl monomer Alk-Nb was synthesized via consecutive conversion of 2-hexyldecanoic acid to the respective carboxylic acid chloride, followed by a Schotten Baumann type acylation with 5-norbornene-2-methanol. Successful conversion can be shown by complementary methods. Via FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†), the consumption of educt hydroxy and carboxyl functionalities, as well as a change of carbonyl oscillator strength caused by the changed chemical environment can be observed. In the product DIP mass spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†), the [M]+ signal, as well as expected fragments can be observed. 1H and 13C-NMR spectra (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†) show educt consumption, as well as a quantitative shift of methylene proton signals at the formed ester site, proofing successful synthesis, and purification. To functionalize the fullerene-grafted norbornene monomer PCB-Nb, 5-norbornene-2-methanol was deprotonated to the respective alcoholate, followed by basic transesterification. Analogous to the previous characterization, FT-IR, 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S5–S7, ESI†) were employed to prove successful synthesis and characterization. Additionally, MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry shows a single signal at the expected molecular mass, with fragmentation at high laser intensity (Fig. S8, ESI†).
Copolymer synthesis
By copolymerization of the two monomers in different feed-in ratios, a series of four copolymers with fullerene contents ranging from 30 wt% to 60 wt% (P(PCB-Nb)30–P(PCB-Nb)60, with the appending number indicating the target fullerene mass content) was prepared, as depicted in Fig. 1. The fullerene content discussed here is the real amount of pure C60 content without considering any substituent or norbornene weights (Table 1). The system intrinsically exhibits a limit at a maximum fullerene content of approx. 72 wt%, if pure PCB-Nb is homopolymerized without addition of Alk-Nb. This limit, however, was found to be unreachable, due to the immediate precipitation of insoluble oligomers shortly after initiation of the homopolymerization. This further demonstrates the importance of the addition of the solubilizing comonomer and the strength of a copolymerization strategy to find a compromise between sufficient fullerene content, solubility, and electron transport. To obtain a series of comparable materials, the grafting density of PCB-Nb was fixed at an average number of n = 16.67 fullerene units or a fullerene mass of M = 12 kg mol−1 per polymer chain. Hence, the comonomer Alk-Nb content has to be decreased to increase the fullerene content. In other words, the average molar mass of the polymers decreased with increasing C60 content, due to the smaller number of alkyl comonomer units (cf.Fig. 1(c)). For comparative reasons, the homopolymer, P(Alk-Nb) was synthesized without fullerene-carrying repeating units and denoted as P(PCB-Nb)0.

Polymerizations were carried out in anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Prior to the polymerization, monomers were dissolved, purged with argon, and cooled to 6 °C. Polymerization was initiated by fast injection of a solution of third generation Grubbs catalyst in o-DCB under vigorous stirring. After three hours, complete monomer conversion was verified based on 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2(a)). The sharp monomer signals experienced a significant signal broadening, due to the decreased isotropic movability. Additionally, a change in chemical shift of e.g., the norbornene double bond proton signals hinted successful polymerizations, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The absence of sharp monomer signals, e.g., at a chemical shift of δ = 5.8–6.3 ppm in the polymer 1H-NMR spectra proves quantitative monomer conversion. Further, the formation of polymers was confirmed based on SEC and MALDI-ToF measurements (Fig. 1(d and e)). The predicted trend of decreasing molecular weight upon fullerene content increase is reflected unambiguously. The molecular mass of the polymers, determined via MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry is in good accordance with the theoretical molecular mass, calculated from the comonomer/initiator ratio (Table S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Investigation of the copolymerization of PCB-Nb and Alk-Nb. (a) 1H-NMR analysis confirms quantitative conversion of the monomer PCB-Nb, as well as polymer formation, as can be seen on the characteristic signal broadening. (b) Kinetic plot of the copolymerization yielding P(PCB-Nb)30, which shows an approximate linear relationship between the polymer mass and molar conversion. (c) SEC samples of the copolymerization of P(PCB-Nb)30, recorded at a detector wavelength predominantly sensitive to fullerenes. This selectivity allows the conclusion that fullerenes are incorporated into the polymer chain in a continuous matter, which leads to the observable steady increase in polymer absorption and molecular mass. 
The polymers with high fullerene contents of 50 wt% and 60 wt% display narrow molecular weight distributions with a dispersity of Đ = 1.3, as determined by SEC (CHCl3, PS calibration). The polymers with lower fullerene contents of 30 wt% and 40 wt% show pronounced coupling or aggregation effects, leading to increased dispersity of Đ = 2.2 and Đ = 2.0. Polymerization kinetic measurements of P(PCB-Nb)30 (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S7, ESI†) show an approximate linear correlation between the molecular mass and molar conversion. This hints towards living polymerization characteristics. However, deviations from this ideal characteristic can be observed, which leads to the conclusion that side reactions and chain termination cannot be excluded entirely.
By using a specific wavelength detector in SEC, corresponding to the absorption for fullerene (λ = 254 nm, cf. Fig. S10, ESI†), the progress of fullerene incorporation was monitored as shown in Fig. 2(c). Here, a simultaneous increase of molecular mass and absorption at the detector wavelength reveals that the fullerene-carrying monomer was incorporated into the polymer continuously throughout the polymerization.
Determination of fullerene content
For a conclusive correlation between the grafting density and material properties, the exact fullerene contents of the copolymers must be known. Full monomer conversion, as well as continuous incorporation of fullerene as shown in Fig. 2, is expected to result in a built-in ratio close to the feed-in monomer ratio. To verify this, the fullerene weight content was independently investigated based on congruent characterization methods and summarized in Table 1.
The molar content of fullerene moieties can be determined via1H-NMR spectroscopy derived from the phenyl protons of the PCB-Nb moieties and the norbornene backbone CC double bond protons, as depicted in Fig. 3(a). The reason for this is, that these aromatic proton signals are solely caused by the fullerene-carrying repeating units, if the phenyl group at the polymer chain end is neglected. The molar fullerene contents, in turn, can be used for the determination of the C60 weight content, when the known molar masses of Alk-Nb (M = 362.6 g mol−1), PCB-Nb (M = 1003.0 g mol−1), and C60 (M = 720 g mol−1) are considered.
 Fig. 3  Data of the series of C60-grafted copolymers for the fullerene content determination via different methods: (a) general P(PCB-Nb) structure with extracts of the copolymer 1H-NMR spectra: phenyl signals (δ = 8.0–7.3 ppm) arise from built-in PCB-Nb while double bond signals (δ = 5.5–5.0 ppm) unselectively from all repeating units and methyl end group proton signals. Spectra were recorded in CHCl3 at room temperature. (b) Concentration dependent optical densities of diluted chloroform solutions of copolymers and PCBM as reference for fullerene content determination according to the law of Lambert and Beer. Extinction coefficients were extracted from the slope of the depicted linear fits. (c) TGA weight loss curves (heating under N2-atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 K min−1) of the polymers with fullerene contents between 0 wt% and 60 wt% and PCBM. The copolymers show a decomposition step at an onset temperature of approx. T = 250 °C. The residual char mass qualitatively scales with the fullerene weight content. 
To determine the average number of fullerene units per repeating unit n, it is adequate to divide the integrated area of the o-phenyl protons by the integrated area of norbornene double bond protons (eqn (1)). Due to overlap with o-DCB solvent residue signals with the m-phenyl and p-phenyl proton peaks were not considered, but only o-phenyl protons at 7.9 ppm were used for the integration. The transformation of the molar contents to weight contents is conducted based on eqn (2). The calculations were done for the four fullerene-grafted polymers, which yielded the fullerene weight contents as listed in Table 1. (1) (2)Fullerene contents, determined via this method are in good agreement with the feed-in ratios.
Under the assumption, that the optical properties of the single C60 chromophore units do not change upon incorporation into the copolymers, fullerene contents can additionally be determined based on the extinction coefficients of the materials, which in turn are possible to determine via the law of Lambert and Beer.38,39 In this context, the UV-Vis absorption of the different copolymers, as well as PCBM, was investigated. Dilute chloroform solutions of several defined concentrations of c = 10, 7.5, 5.0, and 2.5 mg L−1 were prepared. The respective spectra (Fig. S11, ESI†) show the intuitive trend, that the optical density, normalized on the polymer mass concentration, increases with increasing C60 content. At a constant cuvette diameter of d = 1 cm, a linear correlation between concentration and optical density at a certain wavelength (λ = 329 nm) is observed. The slope of the linear fit between the data points in Fig. 3 corresponds to the extinction coefficients ε for the different samples.40 (3) (4)From the ratio of the extinction coefficients, the weight fraction of PCBM in the polymers can be determined according to eqn (3). This, however, is not equivalent to the fullerene weight content. To avoid overestimation of the chromophore fraction, the factor MC60/MPCBM = 720/911 must therefore be used to get correct values of fullerene content (eqn (4)). The determined C60 contents are listed in Table 1 and show close resemblances with those obtained from NMR studies with only slight deviations from the feed-in values. Previously, it was concluded that the determination of fullerene contents through the ratio of extinction coefficients does not fully represent the real values, but rather underestimates them.29
An additional method for the quantification of the C60 content of fullerene-containing polymers is thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere.29,41 Prerequisite for this method is the complete decomposition of the non-fullerene segments under nitrogen flow. The remaining char will originate solely from C60 and thus will be proportional to the polymer fullerene content.29 The materials were heated under nitrogen atmosphere to a temperature of T = 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 K min−1. Prior to copolymer characterization, the degradation behaviour of PCBM was assessed (Fig. 3(c), dashed line). A single degradation step with an onset of T = 398 °C was observable, which corresponded to the splitting of the butyric acid methyl ester leaving behind the rest including the fullerene cage. If the remaining char was only attributed to C60 (Mcarbon(fullerene) = 720.0 g mol−1), a relative mass of 79% would be theoretically expected, which is not in agreement with the measured value of 90.0 wt%. This discrepancy was as well observed and studied by Strauss et al.42 It was shown that the phenyl substituent, as well as the neighbouring quaternary carbon atom, contribute to the mass of the coal residues. This adds up to a total of 67 carbon atoms with a mass of M = 804.0 g mol−1 or 88.3 wt%. This explains the relative mass of char residues (90.0 wt%) satisfactorily. Next, the degradation of the homopolymer P(PCB-Nb)0 and a fullerene content of 0 wt% was investigated. As the blue curve in Fig. 3(c) shows, no weight loss was detected at temperatures below T = 350 °C. After a rapid decay, a relative mass of m = 3.2% remained as residue that has to be taken into account for all the copolymers as estimation of the mass arising from polymer backbone residues. It thus was included as correction in the TGA-based fullerene content calculations. (5)Taking all the beforementioned factors and processes into account, the fullerene content can be determined with eqn (5). As listed in Table 1, the calculated fullerene contents of all copolymers from TGA analysis are considerably higher than those from the other two methods. Similar observations were repeatedly reported for other fullerene-grafted polymers by the groups of Wudl,43 Hadziioannou,41 and our group.29 The difference was attributed to crosslinking of the polymers.41 Even though the absolute values of the fullerene contents determined with TGA do not match the expectations, the difference between the individual copolymers was approx. 10 wt%. This is, in turn, congruent with the feed-in difference. Thus, it can be confirmed that the different feed-in ratios were incorporated resulting in a wide variety of fullerene contents.
Dependence of Tg on fullerene content
For investigation of the C60-content dependent thermal properties, the materials were examined with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Glass transition temperatures were extracted from the loss tangent maxima of the heating and cooling curves (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S10, ESI†). The weak peaks and shoulders observed in addition to the discussed glass transition peaks do not pertain to Tg.

(b) Fullerene content dependent glass transition temperatures, extracted from (a) for poly(norbornene) based polymers (red), in comparison to the poly(methoxy styrene) based system previously investigated in our group with DSC.29 
Compared to unfunctionalized poly(norbornene) (Tg = 47 °C), the poly(norbornene) with branched alkyl ester substituents shows a substantial decrease in glass transition temperature to −2.0 °C. This change can be attributed to the plasticizing effect of the branched alkyl chain resulting in disturbed chain packing. Incorporation of fullerene side chain moieties causes an increase in side-group interaction and a decrease in chain segment mobility of the copolymer, causing a considerable increase of the glass transition temperature, as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3(b). The apparent linear correlation of the glass transition temperature and the fullerene content enable targeted synthesis of materials with any Tg in the given range via a fitting fullerene content or monomer ratio, respectively. It is to be mentioned that the Tg values, obtained from heating (Fig. 4(a)) are lower than for cooling curves (Fig. S12, ESI†) except for P(PCB-Nb)30. Moreover, this difference increases with increasing fullerene content, which may be attributed to possible fullerene-fullerene interaction once the sample is heated above its Tg (cf. Fig. S13 and Table S2, ESI†).

Dependence of Tg on the polymer backbone
Initially, it was assumed, that a polymer backbone with a decreased glass transition temperature will result in a graft polymer with a similarly decreased glass transition. With available data of a poly(methoxy styrene) based fullerene-grafted polymer synthesized in our group, this assumption can be verified.29 In Fig. 3(b), the Tg dependent on the fullerene-grafting density is shown for the poly(methoxy styrene) based copolymers indicated with blue data points. When compared to the herein investigated poly(norbornene) based copolymers for the similar fullerene contents, a similar linear dependence is evident. As predicted, the difference of the backbone glass transition temperature is reflected in the graft copolymers with an offset of roughly 100 °C, independent of the fullerene grafting density. The unfunctionalized homopolymers with 0 wt% fullerene content deviate slightly from the linear trend. The reason for this was demonstrated by Alberola et al. Only with a minimum fullerene content of approx. 10–14 vol%, interfullerene interaction can occur, which leads to a changing dependence of the thermal transition on the C60 content.44
Suppression of thermally induced crystallization
The absence of sharp melting signals in DMTA measurements hints towards suppression of fullerene crystallization, caused by the restricted movability of the grafted materials. For the long term thermal stability of organic technologies involving fullerenes, a stable amorphous morphology is highly desirable. Hufnagel et al. demonstrated that fixation of C60 to a poly(methoxy styrene)backbone indeed suppresses fullerene crystallization entirely.29 In this work, however, a functionalized polynorbornene backbone with significantly lower glass transition temperature of Tg = −2.0 °C compared to Tg = 98 °C of poly(methoxy styrene) was used for immobilization. The glass transition temperature is strongly correlated to the polymer segment mobility, which means in turn, that decreasing the Tg of the polymer backbone can lead to increased softness and segmental motion. Hence, the assumption of suppressed crystallization needs to be verified separately for our low Tg systems. For that, we conducted bulk XRD measurements. The polymers were treated at a temperature of T = 200 °C for 15 minutes and cooled slowly to allow potential crystallization of the samples. With reference to the benchmark material PCBM, XRD diffractograms were recorded of the materials P(PCB-Nb)60 and P(PCB-Nb)30, to represent the two boundary cases of high and low fullerene loading of 60 wt% or 30 wt%, as well as high and low glass transition temperatures.
The small molecule PCBM shows sharp refraction peaks, focused on the scattering angle around 20° 2θ, indicating pronounced crystallinity. In contrast, the absence of such sharp signals is noticeable in the polymer diffraction patterns. Instead, broad signals are recognizable in both samples. Such broad scattering signals are characteristic for glassy polymers, which means, that despite the relatively low Tg of poly(norbornene), the investigated copolymer systems were able to suppress crystallization due to the covalent attachment to a polymer backbone which hinders diffusion necessary for crystallization.
Complementary, the topology of films of P(PCB-Nb)30 and P(PCB-Nb)60 was investigated via AFM before and after thermal treatment for 15 min at T = 200 °C. As visualized in the image pairs Fig. 5(b–e), only minute topological changes occur in both materials during annealing. For P(PCB-Nb)30, slightly coarser grains seem to be visible, which is also represented in the more focused FFT image inlet. The structure in P(PCB-Nb)60 seems to experience an opposite change. However, in neither of the images, nanocrystals or large aggregates are observable. This shows, in addition to the scattering data, that the synthesized polymers indeed exhibit a stable amorphous morphology.

The sharp signals, observable for PCBM show pronounced crystallinity, while the absence of such sharp peaks proves the amorphous nature of the fullerene-grafted polymers, independent on the C60 content. The AFM image pairs (b) + (c) and (d) + (e) further provide real-space evidence for the absence of crystal formation during the same annealing protocol for the two copolymers P(PCB-Nb)30 and P(PCB-Nb)60. FFT insets of AFM images show no preferential radial distance. 
Dependence of the electron mobility on fullerene content
The bulk electron mobility (μe) of the synthesized copolymers was determined via space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Devices (glass/FTO/ZnO/C60-derivative/Ca/Al) were fabricated with electrode areas of 4 mm2. A ZnO bottom layer and Ca/Al top electrodes were established to prevent hole injection and ensure efficient electron injection. Thus, the detected current can be assumed to be solely caused by electron conduction without any hole contribution. When direct bias was applied, the J–V characteristics, depicted in Fig. 6 were obtained. Data was interpreted, based on the Murgatroyd law (6) with the current density J/A, the vacuum permittivity ε0, an estimated polymer permittivity of ε = 3, as well as the measured voltage V and film thickness L. The factor exp(γ√F) with the empirical factor γ and the electric field F compensates for inhomogeneities of the electric field in the measured material.45 (6)The transition from the ohmic regime (V ∝ J) to the here relevant SCLC regime is visualized in a double logarithmic plot in Fig. S14 (ESI†). Data in the interval with a slope of d(log(J))/d(log(V)) = 2 was used for evaluation, because the square dependence that emerges from the law is fulfilled there. Further, the V ∝ L−3 dependence is shown exemplarily for P(PCB-Nb)50 in Fig. S15 (ESI†) using the same electrode configuration. It is important to note, that it is unlikely that the fitted regime corresponds to trap-free electron transport. Instead, it is possible, that the trap-SCLC regime was used for evaluating. The obtained mobilities, therefore, are effective zero-field electron mobilities, rather than absolute values. However, comparison of the polymers is valid, as the same conditions were used for all materials.

Solid lines were fitted according to the Murgatroyd equation and show good accordance to the theoretically expected behaviour in the fitting range above V = 1 V. The respective double-logarithmic plot is included in the ESI.† (b) Fullerene-content dependent effective zero-field electron mobilities before and after annealing 50 °C above the respective Tg for the fullerene-grafted polymers and the reference material PCBM. 

Fig. 6(a) shows the log-linear J–V characteristics of the different pristine materials and Murgatroyd fits. In addition to the synthesized polymers, PCBM was analysed as benchmark material. A clear increase in electron mobility is observable in Fig. 6(b), upon increase of the C60 content of the copolymers. Pristine P(PCB-Nb)60 exhibits a charge carrier mobility (5.41 ± 1.11) × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 on par with PCBM, despite a 19% lower fullerene content by mass. After annealing for 15 min at 50 °C above the respective glass transition temperatures, the polymers exhibit a substantially increased electron mobility. This can be attributed to a closer interfullerene distance that was established in the soft state without any adverse effect of macroscopic fullerene crystallization (cf.Fig. 5). The material P(PCB-Nb)30 has relatively high electron mobility, that does not change upon annealing, because in this copolymer with a glass transition temperature of Tg = 16.8 °C, the fullerenes were already sufficiently mobile during storage at room temperature. Thus, an additional annealing step has no further advantage. Further, the electron mobility of PCBM decreased upon annealing at T = 190 °C for 15 min, likely due to increased electrode resistance, caused by interfacial effects. All annealed polymers with a fullerene content of at least 40 wt% exhibited effective zero-field electron mobilities similar to PCBM or higher, which marks a considerable improvement by two to three orders of magnitude to previously reported fullerene-grafted polymers.29,33,43 These high values can be explained based on previous investigations. The group of Bao observed an increase in electron mobility of fullerene-grafted polymers, compared to the respective monomer, caused by the formation of percolated fullerene pathways, able to conduct charges more efficiently than in the unpolymerized units.33 Moreover, a comparatively more flexible polynorbornene backbone compared to polystyrene favours the percolation of charges considerably without any crystallization of the fullerene moieties.
In our polymers, this effect and the dilution with electrochemically inactive backbone and alkyl functionalities influence the electron mobility in competing ways. For the polymers with high fullerene contents, however, the formation of conductive pathways effects a significant mobility increase, resulting in the observed electron mobility, exceeding even the benchmark material PCBM. This explanation is supported by the increased performance upon annealing. This indicates that the softened polynorbornene backbone enables rearrangement of the grafted fullerene units without crystallization, resulting in efficient conductive pathways.
Conclusions
By employing ring opening metathesis copolymerization of a fullerene-functionalized norbornene monomer with a solubilizing comonomer, a series of C60-grafted copolymers was synthesized. Grafting-through polymerization enabled high control over the built-in ratio of the repeating units, as demonstrated via complementary characterization methods. Material properties of the resulting copolymer series were correlated to the variable C60 content. It was possible to observe an approximate linear dependency of the glass transition on the fullerene weight content, in a range between Tg = 16.8 °C for 30 wt% incorporated C60 and Tg = 145.9 °C for 60 wt% C60. We compared our copolymers to a similar poly(methoxy styrene) based system,29 and observe that a decreasing backbone glass transition temperature along with the use of a soft comonomer facilitated a considerable decrease of the glass transition temperature of the graft polymers. Despite the increased backbone flexibility, however, full suppression of fullerene crystallization was demonstrated for our poly(norbornene) copolymers, even after drastic thermal treatment. The effective zero-field bulk electron μe was determined via SCLC measurements and compared to the benchmark methanofullerene PCBM. Again, a significant dependence of μe on the fullerene weight content was observed, showing an increase of more than two orders of magnitude when the relative fullerene content is doubled from 30 wt% to 60 wt%. After annealing, most of our polymers exhibited effective zero-field electron mobilities in the range of pristine PCBM, up to μe = 0.334 cm2 V−1 s−1. Achieving such high values is a big step in the field of fullerene-grafted polymers, where insufficient electron mobilities were restricting most applications up to now. Together with the various possibilities of polymer functionalization and the suppression of crystallization, the presented copolymer system is a promising candidate for various applications. The materials, exhibiting high electron mobilities, in conjunction with only weakly ordered morphology may for example combine the properties of an electronic crystal and a thermal glass, which is highly desired in the field of organic thermoelectrics.
