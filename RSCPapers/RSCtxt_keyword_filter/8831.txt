    , Accepted 31st May 2021First published on 1st June 2021AbstractThe search for photocatalysts is crucial for the production of renewable hydrogen from water. The loading of semiconductors in a junction architecture is a promising strategy to improve charge separation. Using first-principles calculations with the HSE06 functional, we propose the type-II semiconductor heterojunction SIn2Te/TeIn2Se as a promising solar-driven water-splitting photocatalyst with a high utilization rate for solar power. Its band edges straddle the redox potential of the water-splitting reaction, satisfying the requirements for water-splitting photocatalysts. Its type-II band alignment promotes the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. The high optical absorption coefficient (5 × 104 cm−1), high absorbance (20.6%) in the visible region, high solar power conversion efficiency (18.5%) and significant excitonic effects indicate that SIn2Te/TeIn2Se can efficiently utilize solar power. Because of its weak interlayer coupling, its electronic, optical and photocatalytic properties remain outstanding under an external force field, guaranteeing its applicability under the actual experimental environment. Furthermore, its stability in liquid water and low reaction barrier for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) also support the promise of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se as a photocatalyst for the water-splitting reaction.
1. Introduction
The first report of water splitting under solar irradiation on an n-type TiO2 electrode demonstrated that hydrogen production through semiconductor-based photocatalysts was a viable method.1–4 Unfortunately, due to their large band gaps, most three-dimensional (3D) photocatalysts can only utilize ultraviolet light, which accounts for <5% of solar energy.5–8 Furthermore, in 3D photocatalysts the photo-generated electrons and holes cannot efficiently migrate and separate at the solid/water interface, and the lower surface-to-volume ratio results in insufficient active sites on the surface for water splitting.
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently drawn great attention for enhancing solar-driven catalytic activity and solar energy utilization.9–11 2D photocatalysts have two main intrinsic advantages, i.e., their higher specific surface area, which provides sufficient reactive sites, and their short migration distances, which reduce the possibility of electron–hole recombination.12–14 In particular, 2D type-II semiconductor heterojunctions promote the efficient separation of electron–hole pairs because the top of the valence band (VBM) and the bottom of the conduction band (CBM) are spatially distributed at different layers.15 Additionally, improved solar energy harvesting (e.g. photovoltaic devices) can promote solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. To improve solar energy harvesting, the 2D semiconductors should exhibit significant optical absorption, high carrier mobility and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).14,16–19 It has been reported that high PCE can be obtained in some type-II heterojunctions consisting of 2D materials with high optical absorption.18,19 Consequently, the strategy of constructing 2D type-II vdW heterojunctions is predicted to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting.
The group III–VI monolayers (MX, M = Ga and In, X = S, Se, and Te) are intriguing 2D optoelectronic materials due to their excellent stability, tunable bandgaps, high carrier mobility and high absorption for visible light.20–24 Many Janus-structure MXs are promising photocatalysts for water splitting with suitable bandgaps and band edge positions.25,26 The out-of-plane mirror symmetry is broken in a Janus MX, resulting in the separated distribution of the band edges (CBM and VBM) on the upper and lower atomic surfaces, respectively, which improves the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.26–29 However, the separation ability of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in such Janus materials is still highly insufficient because both the CBM and VBM are distributed in the same 2D structure. Additionally, the PCEs of Janus MXs are too low, which limits their capacity to utilize solar energy. Constructing van der Waals (vdW) semiconductor heterojunctions with type-II band alignment is an effective route to reduce the recombination of charge carriers and enhance the PCE due to the natural spatial separation of the VBM and CBM.30–36 To date, many 2D vdW heterojunctions with type-II band alignment have been reported experimentally and theoretically.17,18,37–39 In vdW heterojunctions, the coupling between carrier layers, long lifetime of interlayer excitons, and ultra-fast charge transfer between layers will be beneficial to their application as light-excited carriers.37–39
In this work, we construct vdW heterojunctions based on 1T Janus-M2XTe (M = Ga/In, X = S/Se) to explore their application as photocatalysts for water-splitting reactions using first-principles calculations.
2. Computational methods
All the calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) with projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).40,41 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was employed for the structural relaxation and self-consistent calculations.42 Due to the vdW interactions between the heterojunction layers, the DFT-D2 method was taken into consideration to obtain more accurate band structures.43,44 The cut-off energy was set to 500 eV, and an 11 × 11 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid was adopted for the first Brillouin zone sampling. The convergence force received by each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1, and the total convergence rate was 10−5 eV. Due to the different chalcogen atoms in the top and bottom layers, the dipole correction was taken in consideration. The vacuum region was larger than 20 Å to avoid the interaction of adjacent units in the z direction. In order to avoid underestimation of the band gap in the GGA-PBE calculation, all the band structure and optical properties were also calculated based on the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional, which includes 25% exact nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange and 75% semi-local PBE exchange.45 An external electrostatic field can be used in the slab, or molecular calculations based on manipulating the dipole moment.46,47 In order to simulate the influence of the in-plane electric field, an artificial dipole layer in the middle of the vacuum in the z direction was added.
To study the dynamic stability in air, the PHONOPY code was employed to calculate the phonon dispersion based on force constants obtained using density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT).48,49 Born–Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were employed to evaluate the stability in liquid water. In this case, the simulations were carried out by placing the vdW heterojunction in liquid water with a fixed density of 1 g cm−3 (320 atoms are used in the canonical ensemble). The algorithm of Nosé50 was used to control the temperature. 4 × 4 × 1 supercells were used in the calculation of both the phonon dispersion and AIMD. The dielectric matrix including plane-wave components of 500 eV was obtained by the random phase approximation (RPA),51 and the electron–hole (e–h) interaction was considered by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE).52
The absorption coefficient determines the absorption range of the spectrum. The optical absorption coefficient α(ω) can be calculated based on the complex dielectric function using the formula: (1)
Here, ε1 and ε2 are the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function, respectively. Thus, the optical absorption spectrum of the heterostructure and the isolated monolayers can be obtained by calculating the dielectric function.
The light absorption of the material is also illustrated by the absorbance A(E), which is defined as the fraction of photons with energy E = ℏω absorbed by the heterojunction:53–56 (2)where α is the absorption coefficient, ε2 is the imaginary part of the dielectric function, and ΔZ is the vertical thickness of the heterojunction. The flux of absorbed photons Jabs is then determined based on the A(E) as follows: (3)where Eg is the HSE bandgap of the absorber material and Jph(E) is the incident photon flux.53
According to previous research,35,57 the solar energy conversion is quantitatively described by the PCE. The PCE of a type-II alignment is determined using the following equation: (4)where 0.65 is the band fill factor (FF), Jph(ℏω) is the photon energy ℏω of AM1.5 solar flux, and Edg is the donor bandgap of the heterojunction.
The binding energy (Eb) was used to determine the stability of the heterojunction in different stackings. Taking SIn2Te/SeIn2Te as an example, it is defined as: Eb = ESIn2Te/SeIn2Te − ESIn2Te − ESeIn2Te,(5)Here, ESIn2Te/SeIn2Te, ESIn2Te, and ESeIn2Te represent the total energy of the SIn2Te/SeIn2Te vdW heterojunction and single-layer SIn2Te and SeIn2Te, respectively.
ΔG is defined as: ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS,(6)where ΔE is defined as ΔE = Epristine+H − (Epristine + EH), where EH, Epristine and Epristine+H are directly obtained from the DFT total energy. ΔEZPE is the change in the zero-point energy, T is the temperature (298.1 K, in our work), and ΔS is the change in entropy.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometry, electronic and optical properties of isolated M2XTe monolayers
Before studying the heterojunctions, we first investigated the M2XTe monolayers. Taking SeIn2Te as an example, a schematic diagram of the atomic structure of M2XTe is shown in Fig. 1a. The M2XTe is superimposed on the X–M–M–Te sequence. Their structural parameters and bandgap calculated based on the PBE function are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The results are consistent with the previously reported results.26

To obtain more accurate results, the HSE06 hybrid functional was used to calculate the band structures, which are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We found that the single-layer SIn2Te, SeGa2Te, SeIn2Te, and SGa2Te are all direct band-gap semiconductors with both the CBM and VBM at the Γ point. The bandgaps of the M2XTe monolayers range from 1.54 to 1.92 eV, which is located in the visible range and exceeds the free energy of water splitting (1.23 eV). The band edges (CBM and VBM) of SeGa2Te, SeIn2Te, and SGa2Te straddle the redox potentials of water, satisfying this requirement for the overall photocatalytic water splitting process. Optical absorption is another important requirement for photocatalytic materials. The absorbance A(E) is defined as the fraction of photons with energy E = ℏω absorbed by the 2D system with a thickness Δz. The absorbance A(E) is independent of the size of the vacuum layer because ε2 ∝ 1/Δz when a vacuum is included to simulate 2D systems. The A(E) was calculated according to eqn (2) as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). One can see that the A(E) values of SIn2Te and SeIn2Te reach 25.7% and 32.1%, while the A(E) values of SGa2Te and SeGa2Te are less than 5% in the visible light range.
3.2. Stability, electronic and optical properties of the heterojunction
The vdW heterojunction was constructed based on M2XTe (M = Ga/In, X = Se/S), and were denoted as XM2Te/XM2Te, XM2Te/TeM2X or TeM2X/XM2Te depending on the atomic species at the interface. We also took the influence of the stacking on the stability and electronic properties into account. The structures of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se with AA and AB stacking are represented in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. Other structures are shown in detail in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The binding energies were calculated according to eqn (5) to determine their relative stability. From the Eb values in Table S2 (ESI†), we find that for a given interface, AB stacking is more favorable than AA stacking, while for a given stacking the Te–Te interface is the most favorable in terms of energy. The particular atom species at the interface also influence the stability.
The band structures of all the heterojunctions with the Te–Te interface in their most stable stacking were calculated using the HSE06 method, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Five heterojunctions (SeIn2Te/TeGa2Se, SGa2Te/TeIn2Se, SIn2Te/TeGa2Se, SIn2Te/TeGa2S, and SIn2Te/TeIn2Se) were found to be direct bandgap semiconductors with type-II band alignment. A direct bandgap is greatly favorable for optical absorption, and a type-II band alignment is favorable for the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The type-II band alignment was identified from the orbital-solved projected band structures in Fig. 2 and band decomposed charge density in Fig. S5 (ESI†). We found that the CBM derives from the Janus layer with the metallic element Ga while the VBM derives from the Janus layer with the metallic element In. This is because the Janus with In has a smaller work function than that with Ga as shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†). In detail, the VBM is mainly contributed by the in-plane states of Te coupled with In, while the CBM is from the Ga_s and Ga_pz as shown in Fig. 2. For SIn2Te/TeIn2Se with the same metallic element In, the VBM is mainly from the Te2_px of SeIn2Te and the CBM from the In1_s and In1_pz of SIn2Te. The band decomposed charge density in Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows that the VBM and CBM are distribute at different Janus layers, supporting the type-II band alignment.

(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) depict the band structures of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se, SeIn2Te/TeGa2Se, SIn2Te/TeGa2Se, SGa2Te/TeIn2Se and SIn2Te/TeGa2S, respectively. The superscript ‘1’ (‘2’) stands for the atoms belonging to the upper (lower) Janus layer. 
The band gaps of these heterojunctions obtained using the HSE06 method range from 1.08 eV to 1.50 eV as shown in Table 1, which indicates that they are outstanding p–n semiconductors to collect power from solar energy based on the Shockley–Queisser limit.58 SeIn2Te/TeGa2Se, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se and SIn2Te/TeGa2Se have direct bandgaps of 1.43 eV, 1.50 eV and 1.32 eV, which exceed the free energy of water splitting (1.23 eV). The oxidation/reduction ability can be evaluated by comparing the CBM and VBM with the redox potential of the water-splitting reaction. The positions of the VBM (CBM) relative to vacuum can be straightforwardly obtained by taking the energy difference of the electrostatic potential in vacuum and the energy level of the VBM (CBM) from the band structure calculations.25,59,60 The positions of the VBM and CBM of these vdW heterojunctions relative to the vacuum level are shown in Fig. 3a. For water-splitting reactions at pH = 0, the reduction potential for H+/H2 and the oxidation potential for O2/H2O are −4.44 and −5.67 eV, respectively. We found that VBM of the SeIn2Te/TeGa2Se and SIn2Te/TeGa2Se heterojunctions were higher than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O. The band edges of the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction straddle the redox potential of water, indicating that it is suitable for the overall photocatalytic water-splitting process. Subsequently, we focused on the application of the semiconductor vdW heterojunction SIn2Te/TeIn2Se in the photocatalytic water-splitting process. One thing that must be mentioned is that two vacuum levels are obtained for the top and bottom layers due to the different chalcogen atoms, which indicates the existence of an intrinsic electric field. Intrinsic electric fields have been reported to enhance the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers and alter the band alignment.61 The differences between the vacuum levels are less than 35 meV in our systems, which hardly change the band alignment in our systems, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Thus, we do not discuss the effects of the intrinsic electric field, and we chose the high vacuum level as the reference for the CBM and VBM.

Stability in both air and aqueous solution is a very important property for a water-splitting photocatalyst. In addition to the binding energy, we also calculated the phonon dispersion bands for SIn2Te, SeIn2Te and SIn2Te/TeIn2Se as shown in Fig. 4. All the phonon modes have no negative eigenfrequencies, indicating the dynamical stability of the materials (SIn2Te, SeIn2Te and the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction) in air. An ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation was carried out for SIn2Te/TeIn2Se in aqueous solution based on a previous work62 as shown in Fig. 4. We found that the atoms in SIn2Te/TeIn2Se vibrate only slightly around the equilibrium positions at 300 K for 6 ps, indicating its stability in liquid water. The stability of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se in liquid water was also checked using AIMD at 500 K for 6 ps (shown in Fig. S8, ESI†).

(d)–(f) Snapshots of the structure of the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction in liquid water after stabilization at 300 K for 2, 4 and 6 ps, respectively. (The simulation was carried out by placing the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction in liquid water with a density of 1 g cm−3.) 
To further explore the solar energy utilization of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se as a solar-driven catalyst, we investigated its optical absorption and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In comparison with the monolayers SIn2Te and TeIn2Se, the light absorption coefficient of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se is significantly enhanced in both the visible light and ultraviolet light ranges, as shown in Fig. 5a. The light absorption coefficient is as high as 5 × 104 cm−1 in the visible light region. As shown in Fig. 5e, the absorbance A(E) of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se is up to 20.6% in the visible light region, which is better than that of silylene and hydrogenated bilayer silylene.55 Compared to those of both the SIn2Te and TeIn2Se monolayers, the A(E) of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se slightly decreases, but still maintains a high level. A significant absorption peak is found at an incident photon energy of 1.50 eV, indicating enhancement of the absorption capacity for near-infrared light. The incident photon energy of 1.50 eV is consistent with the bandgap of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se, indicating that this absorption peak is mainly related to the interlayer coupling. Based on the A(E), the flux of absorbed photons Jabs was calculated using eqn (3). The Jabs can be expressed as the equivalent short-circuit electrical current density in the ideal case when all photons are converted to carriers and extracted during the photovoltaic process. The Jabs of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se is 5.88 mA cm−2. The Jabs of 1 nm thick Si is only 0.10 mA cm−2,55 which means that Si with a thickness of approximately 60 nm would be necessary to absorb the same fraction of sunlight as this sub-nanometer thickness heterojunction.

(b)–(d) Absorption coefficients and (f)–(h) optical absorbance A(E) under specific d, ε and E-field values, respectively. The reference air-mass 1.5-solar-spectral irradiance is plotted in yellow. 
The excitonic effect is important in the optical absorption process, in which the electron–hole pairs are generated. Based on the Bethe–Salpeter equation eigenstates, the excitonic effect was considered to evaluate the optical absorption of the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction. Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows the values for the imaginary part of the dielectric function obtained using the G0W0 and G0W0 + BSE method along the lattice vector a (seen in Fig. 1a). Based on previous works,63–65 the excitonic binding energy of the bright bound exciton is defined as the difference between the energy of the first absorption peak using the G0W0 + BSE and G0W0 approaches. The excitonic binding energy was estimated to be 0.38 eV. This value is similar to the values of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).66,67 These significant excitonic effects indicate that the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction is favorable for generating electron–hole pairs in the water-splitting reaction. The PCE, which determines the maximum theoretical efficiency of the p–n junction to collect solar power, was studied using eqn (4). In SIn2Te/TeIn2Se, SIn2Te can be viewed as the acceptor and SeIn2Te as the donor, as shown in Fig. S6b (ESI†); thus, the photogenerated electrons can diffuse from SeIn2Te to SIn2Te. The PCE calculated based on the HSE06 method was as high as 18.5%, which is comparable to previously reported 2D p–n heterojunctions with excellent optoelectronic performance.34–36,68 Consequently, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se possesses high solar energy harvesting ability.
3.3. Effect of vertical strain on the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction
The interfacial distance of vertically stacked heterojunctions connected by weak vdW forces will be affected by different experimental conditions, such as the degree of vacuum and annealing temperature/time.69,70 We simulated vertical strain by changing the distance between layers. The interlayer distance (d) was varied from 2.40 Å to 4.00 Å, and the spacing was 0.2 Å. The equilibrium d was 3.22 Å in SIn2Te/TeIn2Se. When d was greater than 2.80 Å, the heterojunction maintained a direct bandgap and type-II band alignment, as shown in the projected band structure in Fig. S10 (ESI†).
The band structures near the Fermi level are insensitive to the vertical strain. As shown in Fig. 6a, the bandgap is almost unchanged (about 1.5 eV); the valence band offset (ΔEv) increases slightly from 0.46 eV to 0.69 eV while the conductance band offset (ΔEc) decreases from 0.66 eV to 0.43 eV. The positions of CBM and VBM relative to vacuum remain almost unchanged and straddle the redox potential of water splitting as shown in Fig. 3b, which indicates that the heterojunction is still suitable for the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. The positions of the band edges are robust under vertical strain because the vertical strain mainly modifies the interlayer coupling, but the positions of CBM and VBM are related to intralayer bonding. The interlayer coupling is weak in SIn2Te/TeIn2Se. In SIn2Te/TeIn2Se, an almost equilibrium electrostatic potential is formed at the interface because of the same interfacial atomic layers (Te layers) of two Janus layers, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Little electrostatic potential difference is formed to pump the electrons for transfer in the interlayer, resulting in the weak interlayer coupling. From Fig. S13 (ESI†), it can be seen that the vertical strain hardly influences the intralayer electrostatic potential distribution of each Janus layer, indicating that the intralayer bonding of each Janus layer is insensitive to vertical strain. As a result, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se exhibits robust band edge positions.
 Fig. 6  (a)–(c) Evolution of the bandgap and band offsets of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se depending on d, ε and the E-field. (d)–(f) Evolution of the PCE depending on d, ε and the E-field, respectively. 
The optical absorption and PCE were also calculated to investigate the utilization of solar power under vertical strain. The PCE increases from 18.5% to 21.0% as d is increased from 2.80 Å to 4.00 Å, as shown in Fig. 6d. According to eqn (4), the PCE is directly proportional to the maximum open-circuit voltage (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3). The donor band gap (TeIn2Se) remains almost unchanged because the band structure of each Janus layer is insensitive to vertical strain, while the ΔEc decreases from 0.66 eV to 0.43 eV, resulting in an increase in the maximum open-circuit voltage and then the PCE under the vertical strain. The A(E) of the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se in the visible light region remains above 17.0% as d is increased from 2.80 Å to 4.00 Å, as shown in Fig. 5f. The absorption coefficient shown in Fig. 5b remains above 104 cm−1 in the visible light region. Consequently, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se still exhibits high optical absorption under vertical strain. This phenomenon is due to the fact that the optical absorption mainly derives from the electronic excitation in each layer, but the vertical strain mainly affects the interlayer coupling rather than intralayer interaction. Thus, along with robust band edge positions, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se exhibits improved solar power harvesting with d increasing from 2.80 Å to 4.00 Å.
3.4. Effect of in-plane strain on the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction
Different 2D materials can be stacked vertically to form heterojunctions via interlayer vdW interactions. However, the lattice mismatch generates a slight in-plane strain, which might affect the electronic and optical properties. We studied the effects of in-plane biaxial strain on the photocatalytic performance and solar power harvesting of the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction. The elongation ε of the biaxial strain was calculated as ε = |(a − a0)/a0|, where a0 and a represent the lattice constant in the equilibrium and strained systems, respectively. Since the lattice mismatch between SIn2Te and SeIn2Te is only 1.88%, we focused on the in-plane biaxial strain from −2.00% to +2.00%. A negative (positive) value indicates a compressive (tensile) strain. We found that the heterojunction always maintained a direct bandgap and type-II band alignment under in-plane biaxial strain as shown in the projected band structure in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The bandgap slowly increases from 1.43 eV to 1.54 eV. The ΔEc changes slightly from 0.55 eV to 0.60 eV, and the ΔEv decreases from 0.83 eV to 0.23 eV, as shown in Fig. 5b. The CBM and VBM still straddle the redox potential of the water-splitting reaction in the biaxial strain range from −1.0% to 1.5%, as shown in Fig. 3c, indicating that SIn2Te/TeIn2Se still satisfies the requirement for a photocatalyst in the water-splitting reaction with pH = 0 in this strain range. The effects of in-plane strain on the band edges, in particular, the positions of the VBM and CBM, are attributed to the influence of the strain on the bonding (intralayer interactions) in each Janus layer. As the electrostatic potentials in Fig. S14 (ESI†) show, the potential difference between the Se–In layer and In–Te layer of SeIn2Te decreases from 5.66 eV to 4.26 eV, while the potential difference between the Te–In and In–S layers of SIn2Te decreases from 3.60 eV to 2.23 eV, indicating variation in the intralayer bonding. As a result, the band edges are modulated by the in-plane strain.
The effect on the absorbance A(E) and PCE were also investigated and are shown in Fig. 5g and Fig. 6e. The PCE decreases slightly but still maintains a high level (greater than 17.8%) as the biaxial strain is increased from −2.00% to 2.00%, because both the Eg (equal to the difference between the donor band gap and ΔEc) and ΔEc shown in Fig. 6b are changed only slightly by the biaxial strain. As shown in Fig. 5c, the A(E) and optical absorption coefficients are also insensitive to the in-plane biaxial strain and are above 16.3% and 104 cm−1 in the visible light region, respectively. Therefore, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se maintains suitable band edge positions and high solar power harvesting under biaxial strain in the range from −1.00% to 1.50%.
3.5. Effect of external electric field on the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se heterojunction
An external electric field (E-field) can be generated in electrostatic gating experiments, and is a commonly used method to adjust electronic behaviors.71,72 Although the effects of the external electric field (E-field) can be negative in the photocatalytic water splitting process, they are non-negligible for applications in solar cells. As mentioned above, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se is not only a promising photocatalyst for water splitting but also a promising structure for excitonic solar cells. Therefore, the effects of an applied E-field were also studied here. The E-field was applied perpendicular to the layers. The positive direction was defined as the direction from SIn2Te to TeIn2Se. The E-fields used here ranged from −0.08 V Å−1 to +0.08 V Å−1 with an interval of 0.02 V Å−1.
The projected band structures under the specific E-fields are given in Fig. S12 (ESI†). SIn2Te/TeIn2Se maintains a direct bandgap and the type-II band alignment. The evolution of the band offset and bandgap with the E-field is shown in Fig. 6c. We found that the band offset and band gap are robust under an E-field. The bandgap decreases only slightly from 1.50 eV to 1.47 eV and the ΔEc only increases slightly from 0.53 eV to 0.59 eV, while the ΔEv fluctuates around 0.51 eV. The effects of the E-field are mainly due to the fact that the E-field acts on polarized charge, which can be induced by the redistribution of the charge density at the interface in the layered systems. However, since layers of the same atom are located at the interface of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se, the electrostatic potential is almost equilibrium, and the charge density can scarcely be redistributed at the interface, as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). As a result, only a small electric dipole and polarized charge can be formed at the interface, and SIn2Te/TeIn2Se is insensitive to the E-field. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the almost unchanged interlayer distance of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se under the E-field also confirms the insensitivity of SIn2Te/TeIn2Se to the E-field. The PCE, which is related to the bandgap and conduction band offset, is almost unchanged and remains above 17% under an E-field, as shown in Fig. 6f. At the same time, A(E) is also insensitive to the E-field and remains above 18% as the E-field is increased from −0.08 V Å−1 to +0.08 V Å−1, as shown in Fig. 5h. The light absorption coefficient is also almost unchanged and remains above 104 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 5d. Consequently, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se exhibits excellent optical absorption and PCE under an E-field.
3.6. Reaction barrier for the HER
The above results indicate that SIn2Te/TeIn2Se possesses outstanding properties for generating and separating electron–hole pairs. For a photocatalyst to be effective, the photoexcited electrons and holes should provide an adequate driving force to trigger both the HER and OER processes. The potential of the photogenerated electrons for the HER (Ue) is defined as the energy difference between the hydrogen reduction potential and the CBM, while the potential of photogenerated holes for the OER (Uh) is defined as the energy difference between the VBM and the hydrogen reduction potential.61,73,74
Both Ue and Uh are defined relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). For the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se vdW heterostructure, we obtained values of Ue = 0.19 V and Uh = 1.30 V at pH 0, respectively. To investigate the driving force to trigger the HER, we calculated the free energy of an H atom adsorbed on the SIn2Te layer, because the SIn2Te layer, which contributes to the CBM, provides the photogenerated electron e for the HER. The H adatom is preferentially located on the top of the outermost S site of SIn2Te. In our system, the ΔEZPE and TΔS values were calculated to be 0.21 eV and 0.022 eV, respectively. The free energy (ΔG) obtained using eqn (6) was −0.11 eV. Based on the ΔG, the reaction coordinates for the HER are shown in Fig. 7, and the reaction barrier (overpotential) for the HER is −0.11 eV. This value is smaller than the potential of the photogenerated electrons (Ue = 0.19 V), suggesting that the HER could be triggered solely by the photogenerated electrons in the SIn2Te/TeIn2Se vdW heterostructures. The lower overpotential also indicates high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. However, the Uh for the OER is relatively small compared to those of reported photocatalysts in previous works.75,76 The OER is a complicated four-electron reaction. Thus, sacrificial reagents, co-catalysts and promotors should be added to ensure that the OER can proceed.77

4. Conclusions
In summary, we propose the semiconductor heterojunction SIn2Te/TeIn2Se as an excellent solar-driven water-splitting photocatalyst with high solar energy harvesting based on first principles calculations. SIn2Te/TeIn2Se possesses a direct bandgap of 1.50 eV and a type-II band alignment. The type-II band alignment promotes the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The band edges straddle the redox potential of water, satisfying the basic band structure requirements for water-splitting photocatalysts. At the same time, SIn2Te/TeIn2Se exhibits high solar power harvesting, which is favorable for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. In detail, the heterojunction has an optical absorption coefficient of up to 5 × 104 cm−1, a high absorbance of up to 20.6% and a high solar power conversion efficiency of up to 18.5% in the visible light region. The electronic, optical and photocatalytic properties remain outstanding under an external stress field, which guarantees outstanding performance in an actual experimental environment. Furthermore, its stability in liquid water and low reaction barrier for the HER also show SIn2Te/TeIn2Se to be a promising photocatalyst for the water-splitting reaction.
