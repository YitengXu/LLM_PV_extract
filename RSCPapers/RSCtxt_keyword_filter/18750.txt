    , Accepted 13th May 2020First published on 20th May 2020AbstractWe report the synthesis and characterization of a dithienogermole (DTGe) based small molecule, named Ge-PO-2CN, as a donor material for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) and as a hole transport material (HTM) for dopant-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This molecule consists with a high planar and electron rich DTGe core as a central core unit and covalently linked with an electron rich phenoxazine group. Finally, it is end-capped with electron-deficient malononitrile group. This molecule was synthesized by a facile synthetic protocol, without using costly and complicated purification techniques. The Ge-PO-2CN compound has a suitable HOMO level with respect to the valence band of the perovskite absorber and the BHJ OSCs. The BHJ OSC device made with Ge-PO-2CN as the donor and PC71BM as an acceptor results in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.4%. Subsequently, the PSC with an active area of 1.02 cm2 constructed with dopant-free Ge-PO-2CN as an HTM achieved a PCE of up to 11.63%.
Introduction
In the solar cell community, hybrid halide perovskites (e.g. methylammonium lead halides, CH3NH3PbX3, where X = any halogen) are fascinating and have attracted much attention over the past decade because of drastic increases in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) values, their cost effective raw materials and easy device fabrication.1–3 Recently the PCE of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been reported to be remarkably as high as ∼24.2%.4 The reasons behind the rapid increase in PCE values are their excellent light absorbing abilities, suitable band gaps, high molar extension coefficients and good carrier transport properties. Generally, PSCs are constructed with mesoporous (mp) TiO2 as the electron transport material, a perovskite compound as the light absorber or active layer and hole transporting materials (HTMs).2,5 The working principle of PSCs can be defined as, upon incident light, the photo-excited carriers generated within the perovskite absorber are collected by respective electron transporting materials and hole transporting molecules via corresponding electrodes. Depending on the molecular framework, the perovskite material itself can also act as an electron or hole transporter.2,6,7 Among many other influential factors, the collection of holes in the hole transport material (HTMs) plays a vital role. At present, two organic hole transporting materials, such as poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), have led to state-of-the-art performance in PSCs.8,9 However, these materials also suffer from some drawbacks such as low hole mobility, poor conductivity, high cost, hygroscopic dopants that activate degradation of the active layer and limitations in the deposition process.4,10 Therefore, finding alternative HTMs is under constant investigation. However, certain HTMs have shown numerous disadvantages, such as inducing degradation of the active layer, increasing the overall cost of the device, non-uniform coverage over a large surface area and following the standard doping conditions such as the solvents and doping concentrations.2 Across the globe, several research groups have been working on the development of dopant-free HTM molecules and have reported different types of HTMs, such as small molecule HTMs,11–16 polymer-based HTMs,4,17 and inorganic-based HTMs.18,19 Jun Hong Noh and Jangwon Seo et al. reported a high PCE of ∼23% using poly(3-hexylthiophene) as a HTM molecule.4 Licheng Sun et al. reported a PCE of over 20% using a spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] end capped with a triphenylamine moiety.8 Although such PCE values are often reported in millimetre-sized solar cells, it is important to fabricate at least centimetre-sized PSCs to compare with other existing solar cell technologies, as recommended by public test centres.
The HTMs are analogous to the donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs).20–22,23a Our group has shown successful incorporation of various active layer materials by designing diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),23b boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY),24b squaraine (SQ),25b dithienogermole (DTGe)22a and dithienosilole (DTSi)22b based molecules for BHJ OSCs. In an effort to boost the power conversion efficiency of both the BHJ OSCs and PSCs, numerous small molecule materials have been reported.22a–e However, concerning the scalability of PSCs (1.02 cm2) and the versatile application of BHJ OSCs, we have reported on a small molecule, Si-PO-2CN, based on dithienosilole (DTS) as a building block flanked by electron-rich phenoxazine (POZ) units, which are terminated with dicyanovinylene.22b
The DTGe moiety is a high resonance electron rich moiety and has gradually become a central building block for the construction of several small molecular materials for BHJ OSC applications.20–26 POZ molecules are covalently linked with a DTGe moiety, where POZ is a highly conjugated heterocyclic molecule with a butterfly structure and can act as an excellent donor and electron rich substance, resulting in its successful implementation in solar cell applications.10,27 Additionally, the end groups of malononitrile were useful for the adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO values of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule.
In this work, we have designed and synthesized a novel acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small molecule structure for applications within PSCs and BHJ OSCs, namely 2,2′-(((4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-germolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(10-(2-ethylhexyl)-10H-phenoxazine-7,3-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))dimalononitrile (Ge-PO-2CN). The molecular engineering of the synthesized molecule involves dithienogermole (DTGe) as a central core moiety and phenoxazine (POZ) covalently linked to the DTGe core. Due to its specific properties such as broad absorption in the visible region and suitable electrochemical properties, Ge-PO-2CN has been studied as a dopant-free HTM in centimetre-sized PSCs and as a donor material for BHJ OSCs. The successful implementation of Ge-PO-2CN as an HTM gave a PCE value of 11.63% in PSCs with an active area of 1.02 cm2. Furthermore, a PCE of 5.4% was achieved by the inclusion of Ge-PO-2CN as a donor molecule in BHJ OSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Ge-PO-2CN:PC71BM/MoOx/Al tested under simulated AM 1.5G sun illumination. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report based on a DTGe molecule that has been studied for both PSC and BHJ OSC applications.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic procedure of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule is displayed below in Scheme 1 and the experimental procedure details are given in the ESI.† Phenoxazine (POZ) has less solubility, therefore it is subject to a nucleophilic addition reaction by 2-ethylhexyl bromide and KOH in the presence of acetone, affording intermediate 1 in a good yield. Intermediate 2 was prepared by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of intermediate 1 using phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in dichloroethane. Intermediate 3 was prepared by a bromination reaction of intermediate 2 by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in acetone solution and this resulted in a very good yield. The Knoevenagel condensation reaction of intermediate 3 with malononitrile in the presence of ethanol:toluene at a 1:1 ratio resulted in intermediate 4. Finally, Ge-PO-2CN was prepared by commercially available dithienogermole (DTGe) and intermediate 4, followed by a Stille cross-coupling reaction in the presence of a Pd2(dba)3 catalyst in dry toluene, resulting in a very good yield (71%).

The target molecule was highly soluble in all common solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and toluene (TOL) due to the strong van der Waals interactions from alkyl chains present within the molecule. All the intermediates and the desired molecule were purified using 60–120, 100–200 and 230–400 particle size silica gels through the column chromatography technique. All the intermediates and target molecule were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, as well as by mass spectrometry.
UV-visible absorption spectroscopy
To investigate the absorption behaviour of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule, we performed UV-visible absorption spectroscopy in a dry CHCl3 solution (1 × 10−4 M). Here, Fig. 1 represents the absorption spectra of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule, and the corresponding data are displayed in Table 1. From the spectrum of the solution state, Ge-PO-2CN shows two low intensive bands in the UV-region (high energy region) and one high intensity band in the visible region (lower energy region), corresponding to 321 nm, 426 nm and 556 nm, respectively. The bands near the UV region at 321 (ε = 6567 M−1 cm−1) and 426 (ε = 5662 M−1 cm−1) nm occurred due to π–π* transitions between the molecule. The strong intensive band at 556 (ε = 10098 M−1 cm−1) nm may occur due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer between the donor DTGe molecule and the acceptor malononitrile unit. Compared to the solution state, the solid state Ge-PO-2CN absorption spectrum shows a ∼45 nm red shift due to strong solid state intramolecular π–π interactions from the donor DTGe molecule to the acceptor malononitrile moiety. The band gap, Eg = 1.81 eV, was obtained from thin film absorption spectroscopy using an onset absorption (λonset).

Cyclic voltammetry
In order to evaluate the redox properties of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule, we performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques in dry DCM solution with 0.1 M concentration of tetrabutylammoniumperchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4) as a supporting electrolyte. These experiments were carried out at room temperature in an inert atmosphere condition with a three electrode system. The arrangement consisted of a platinum wire working electrode, a silver wire pseudo-reference electrode and a platinum mesh counter electrode. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were calculated and are tabulated in Table 1. Fig. 2a represents both the CV and DPV spectra of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule and show one reversible reduction peak and two reversible oxidation peaks at −1.16 eV, 0.69 eV and 0.82 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated using the necessary equations of EHOMO = −(4.80 − E1/2, Fc/Fc+ + Eox) and ELUMO = −(4.80 − E1/2, Fc/Fc+ + Ered) (eV), obtaining −5.50 eV and −3.69 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the reference HTM, spiro-OMeTAD, were −5.16 eV and −2.11 eV, respectively, with a band gap of 3.05 eV. The Ge-PO-2CN molecule has lower HOMO and LUMO values compared to the standard reference spiro-OMeTAD molecule. Therefore, for a comparative study, we used the Ge-PO-2CN and spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs. Additionally, we constructed a BHJ OSC with Ge-PO-2CN as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor. The HOMO and LUMO values of PC71BM are −6.3 eV and −4.1 eV, respectively. Ge-PO-2CN molecules have a low HOMO energy level, therefore they showed a high Voc value in the BHJ OSCs. Therefore, the BHJ OSC device made with Ge-PO-2CN as an electron donor showed better photovoltaic performance than devices made with other reported donor molecules. The energy level diagrams of Ge-PO-2CN as a donor in a BHJ OSC (Fig. 2b) and as an HTM molecule in a PSC (Fig. 2c) are represented below.

Photovoltaics properties
To evaluate the performance of the BHJ OSC with Ge-PO-2CN as a donor molecule, we used the conventional device architecture comprising Ge-PO-2CN as the electron donor and a fullerene-based electron acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), in the active layer. The BHJ OSC was fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Ge-PO-2CN:PC71BM/MoOx/Al (ITO = indium tin oxide; PEDOT = poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene); PSS = polystyrene sulfonate), as shown in Fig. 2b. The current–voltage (J–V) curve of the corresponding BHJ OSC is shown in Fig. 3. The photovoltaic parameters, such as the open-circuit voltage (Voc), current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are tabulated in Table 2. Guillermo C. Bazan et al. reported the effect of the 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive in BHJ OSCs.28 The BHJ OSC fabricated with Ge-PO-2CN:PC71BM is sensitive towards a small amount of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a treating additive. CN also behaves as a co-solvent (4% in chlorobenzene), causing a predictable increase in the PCEs of BHJ OSCs due to formation of a nanoscale morphology. We have developed a BHJ OSC device based on Ge-PO-2CN:PC71BM at a 60:40 w/w blend ratio in the absence of the CN additive, and this showed a PCE of 3.5% with Voc = 0.710 V, Jsc = 8.74 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 56.4%, but in the presence of the CN additive (0.3 ratio) a remarkable PCE of 5.4% with Voc = 0.705 V, a high Jsc of 11.97 mA cm−2 and an improved fill factor of 63.5% was achieved.

The bulk electron and hole mobilities of the Ge-PO-2CN:PC71BM blend system were measured by the Mott–Gurney's space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The structures of the electron-only and hole-only devices for the SCLC measurements were ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, respectively.29 The measured J–V curves and Mott–Gurney equation fittings of the data are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 2. The hole mobility (μh) of the donor Ge-PO-2CN in the blend with no CN was found to be 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and this increased to 4.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after the addition of 0.3% CN additive. However, a further increase of the CN additive to 0.6% resulted in a decrease in the hole mobility to 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, the same trend was observed for the electron mobility in the blend, which was 2.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with no CN additive, increasing to 4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after 0.3% CN addition, and decreasing to 3.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with 0.6% of the CN additive. It is important to note that the observed hole and electron mobilities are significantly balanced (μe/μh = 0.96) with 0.3% CN additive (Table 2), and this also explains the highest current density and FF obtained in this case. This is also evident from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The Ge-PO-2CN:PC71BM blend film is highly disordered with no CN additive (Fig. S2a, ESI†), whereas its morphology becomes smooth in the case with 0.3% CN additive (Fig. S2b, ESI†). A further increase of the CN additive to 0.6% deteriorates the surface (Fig. S2c, ESI†) and this can therefore explain the variations in the mobility and efficiency.
Subsequently, in order to examine the HTM property of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule for PSCs, we fabricated the corresponding PSC with conventional mesoporous architecture of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2)/CH3NH3PbI3/Ge-PO-2CN/Au by a one-step solvent engineering process (see the detailed fabrication process in the ESI†). For comparison, we also studied the photovoltaic performance of PSCs fabricated with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. The photovoltaic performance of the fabricated devices under AM 1.5G conditions is shown in Fig. 4 and the detailed results are summarized in Table 3. Fig. 4a represents the current–voltage (J–V) curves of Ge-PO-2CN and spiro-OMeTAD measured under the verses bias scans of the corresponding PSCs. The PSC constructed with spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM showed a PCE of 13.90% with Voc = 1.080 V, Jsc = 20.414 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 63.06 under the reverse scan. The device fabricated with the dopant-free Ge-PO-2CN HTM exhibited a PCE of 11.63% with Voc = 1.019 V, Jsc = 16.86 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 67.65, measured under the forward scan. The hysteresis index (HI) values of the PSCs fabricated with Ge-PO-2CN and the spiro-OMeTAD based devices were calculated by the difference between the cells measured under the reverse scan and the forward scan, and this was then divided by the reverse scan values. The spiro-OMeTAD based PSC showed an HI index of 0.07, whereas the Ge-PO-2CN based PSC showed an HI value of 0.19. Fig. 4b shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of both molecules, including the reference spiro-OMeTAD (black line) and Ge-PO-2CN (red line) based PSCs. In particular, the IPCE spectra of the spiro-OMeTAD and Ge-PO-2CN based devices show a broad spectra from 300 nm to 800 nm with maximum values of 87% at 609 nm and 79% at 423 nm, respectively.

To determine the surface morphology of the MAPbI3 layer and the Ge-PO-2CN moiety on top of MAPbI3, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements and the results are shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†), respectively. The perovskite on top of Ge-PO-2CN (Fig. S3b, ESI†) shows a slightly smaller grain than that of the MAPbI3 layer, resulting in less grain boundaries. This may also be one of the reasons contributing to the improved efficiency of the Ge-PO-2CN based devices.
Theoretical studies
All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 program package. The configurations of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule with a charge of zero were fully optimized with the molecular structure using the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional and a 6-311g(d,p)* basis set in the gas phase.30 The optimized HOMO and LUMO structures of Ge-PO-2CN are shown below in Fig. 5.

TDDFT for Ge-PO-2CN
In order to better understand the photophysical properties of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule, we performed additional quantum chemistry calculations. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method was carried out to correlate the absorption spectra of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule in theoretical and experimental methods with similar exchange correlation functionals and the basis set in Gaussian 09. The TDDFT calculations covered the UV-region (higher energy) and the visible region (lower energy) of the molecule from 300 nm to 800 nm. Here, we primarily concentrated on the visible region of the molecule to understand the charge transfer property. The correlation absorption spectrum of Ge-PO-2CN is shown below in Fig. 6. The absorption spectra of the experimental and theoretical methods look similar and, compared to the absorption spectrum of the experimental, the theoretical absorption spectrum showed differences up to ∼80 nm (Table 4). The optimized HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the Ge-PO-2CN molecule are represented in the ESI† (Table S1) and major allowed transitions from 350–650 nm, estimated using the B3LYP/6-311g (d,p) level of theory in CHCl3 solvent, are also briefly explained in the ESI† (Table S2).

Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesised a novel A–D–A structured DTGe-based small molecule, Ge-PO-2CN, for BHJ OSC and PSC applications. We have studied the Ge-PO-2CN molecule as a donor material for BHJ OSCs with PC71BM as an acceptor, resulting in a PCE of 5.4% with Voc = 0.705 V, Jsc = 11.97 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 63.5%. Subsequently, it was also used as an HTM for dopant-free perovskite solar cell applications, where the perovskite devices (active area 1.02 cm2) made with a conventional architecture with Ge-PO-2CN as an HTM resulted in a PCE of 11.63% with Voc = 1.019 V, Jsc = 16.866 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 67.65. This study provides a new pathway for the implementation of DTGe-based small molecules in BHJ OSC and perovskite solar cell applications.
