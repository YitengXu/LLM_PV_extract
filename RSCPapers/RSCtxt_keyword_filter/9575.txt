    , Accepted 24th April 2023First published on 2nd May 2023AbstractHigh-performing electrolytes at low operating temperatures have become an inevitable trend in the development of low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs). Such electrolytes have drawn significant attention due to their appeal for high performance. Herein, we propose a new material by doping Y3+ into Gd2O3 for LT-SOFC electrolyte use. The prepared material was characterized in terms of crystal structure, surface, and interface properties, followed by its application in LT-SOFCs. YDG delivered promising SOFC performance with a power density of 1046 mW cm−2 at 550 °C along with high ionic conductivity of 0.19 S cm−1. Moreover, impedance spectra revealed that YDG exhibited the least ohmic resistance of 0.06–0.09 Ω cm2 at 550–460 °C. Furthermore, stable operation for 60 h demonstrated the chemical stability of the material in reduced temperature environments. Density function theory was also applied to analyze the electronic band structure and density of states of the synthesized sample. Our findings thus certify that YDG as a high-performing electrolyte at low operating temperatures.
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been investigated owing to their high efficiency and nonhazardous nature to the environment. SOFCs are supercilious, highly efficient, and environment friendly energy conversion devices.1 However, a high operating temperature limits material selection and cost production for SOFC commercialization.2 The key component i.e., the electrolyte, plays an intense role in reducing the operating temperature for SOFCs applications. For several decades, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has been considered a potential electrolyte due to its superior ionic conductivity and chemical stability at ∼1000 °C. Such high operating temperature hampers material selection. Therefore, lowering the operating temperature is the utmost requirement. However, this operation introduces several complications, such as low ionic conductivity, poor stability, and slow start adversely affecting fuel cell performance.3
Sluggish ionic conductivity and activation losses due to poor ORR catalytic activities have pronounced adverse effects on the fuel cell performance. Multiple materials have been investigated for SOFC applications at low temperatures.4,5 In particular, Sm0.2Ce0.8O2−δ (SDC) and Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) have drawn significant attention in terms of enhanced ionic conductivity 0.01–0.1 S cm−1 at 500–700 °C,6 which is significantly higher than the YSZ electrolyte (below 700 °C). Thus, material selection is an important tool for decreasing the SOFC temperature. Furthermore, semiconductor ionic materials exhibit remarkably high ionic conductivity at low temperatures.7 For instance, SmNiO3 reveals an impressive 225 mW cm−2 at 500 °C.8 Moreover, heterostructure-based nanocomposite electrolyte materials have also shown enhanced hybrid conductivity and high stability at a low operating temperature.3,9 Moreover, designing high-performing electrode materials also plays a key role in power enhancement for SOFC based fuel cell devices.10,11
Structural modification is an efficient strategy for enhancing the ionic conductivity. In this regard, Y3+ play a pivotal role to significantly improve the ionic conductivity and phase stability. Pure zirconia maintains its phase at 2300 °C; however, doping zirconia with Y3+ stabilizes the cubic phase at 1000 °C, resulting to improve oxygen vacancies.6 Similarly, Y-doped BaZrO3 remarkably improves protonic conductivity and sufficiently higher chemical stability.12 Kiho Bae et al. achieved 740 mW cm−2 at 600 °C by doping BaZrO3 with yttrium (Y).13 Yufei Song et al. reported 980 mW cm−2 at 650 °C with stability for 800 h for Ni + BZCYYb/BZCYYb/BCCY, in which the presence of Y3+ in the electrode and electrolyte portrays its key significance.14
Rare earth Gd oxide has been widely studied for their extensive thermal stability and wide bandgap nature. Gd is a well-known dopant in SOFC electrolytes but has never been reported as an individual electrolyte or doped with any other elements in it. In this work, we doped Y3+ in Gd2O3 to further stabilize the cubic phase and investigated its application as an electrolyte for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs). On measuring YDG fuel cell performance, it is found that YDG delivered high power density at 550 °C and was persistently stable. Material preparation methods, device fabrication, and characterization information are presented in the supplementary information. The mentioned characterization in the main article is for the best-performing sample of Gd2O3 doped with 10% Y3+ and is described as YDG in the subsequent discussion, and 5% Y doped Gd2O3 and 15% Y doped Gd2O3 are named as YDG-05 and YDG-15.

Fig. 1a shows the phase structure of the YDG powder. The YDG powder exhibited a pure single-phase cubic nature crystal structure, and patterns of YDG powder are consistent with the JCPDS Card of 01-073-2403 using X’pert Highscore Plus software, while the XRD patterns of the other prepared Gd2O3, YDG-05, YDG-10, and YDG-15 samples are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). No extra peaks were observed, indicating successful doping of Y in Gd. Additionally, the crystallite size of YDG was calculated using the Scherrer formula as 23.05 nm. For further accuracy, XRD refinement analysis was performed, and the data were well matched with the XRD, in which the pseudo-Voigt function with oxygen positional parameters were employed for the peak profile pattern of the YDG sample. The refinement also verified the single-phase cubic nature, as shown in Fig. 1a. SEM was performed for the surface micrograph analysis of the YDG sample. The particles were homogeneously distributed and found irregular spherical shapes, along with some agglomeration, as shown in Fig. 1b. Based on SEM, the average particle size was calculated to be 50–100 nm. Fig. 1c illustrates the typical microstructure of YDG inspected by HR-TEM, with the particle size showing good agreement with the SEM analysis. YDG grains, which exhibited nanoscale sizes in the 50–100 nm range, had irregular shapes. Fig. 1d shows the well-defined lattice fringes of YDG with d-spacings of 0.310 nm, corresponding to the hkl plane (111). TEM images of interlayered d-spacing were further assessed using Digital Micrograph software, as exemplified in Fig. 1e. Diffraction patterns have different spots that correspond to specific crystal planes. The measured d-spacing planes of YDG were well synchronized with the XRD results. EDS further verified the elemental homogeneous distribution, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The irregular spherical particles, as shown in the TEM image along with the EDS analysis, verified even distribution of the elements. The uniform distribution of the Y, Gd, and O further illustrates homogeneity in the sample, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The Y, Gd, and O intensive peaks in the elemental graph show the presence of the respective elements in YDG without any other impurities.

To investigate the surface characteristics of the YDG sample, XPS measurements were carried out. Fig. 2 shows deconvoluted spectra of O 1s, Y2 3d and Gd 4d. The presence of distinct peaks signifies pure YDG without any additional impurities. To differentiate the chemical state, the O 1s core-level spectra of the oxygen were deconvoluted by Gaussian functions, as shown in Fig. 2a. The O 1s spectra of YDG, deconvoluted into three different peaks: lattice oxygen (Oδ), adsorbed oxygen species (Oα), and H2O (Oβ).15 Deconvoluted spectra of O 1s for YDG (10% Y doping) shows more adsorbed oxygen species ratio, indicating that it has more oxygen vacancies16 in comparison to 5% and 15% Y3+ doping, as shown in Fig. S3 and Table S2 (ESI†). The enhancements in the relative ratio of Oα are responsible for high ionic conduction and fast HOR functionalities.17 The Y 3d and Gd 4d deconvoluted spectra, as shown in Fig. 2b and c, well matched the reported findings in the literature.18,19

To assess the electrolyte functionalities, the YDG-based SOFC was operated at 550–460 °C. Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.5LiOx (NCAL) was used as a symmetrical electrode to determine their open-circuit voltages and power densities. The current–voltage (I–V) and current–power (I–P) performances of Ni-NCAL/YDG/NI-NCAL operated at different temperatures (Fig. 3a). The YDG-based SOFC delivered a high peak power density (Pmax) of 1046 mW cm−2 at 550 °C. When operated at low temperatures of 520 °C, 490 °C, and 460 °C, the SOFC delivered Pmax of 847, 692, and 305 mW cm−2, respectively. Furthermore, for comparison purposes, the YSZ, GDC, and SDC electrolyte performances were investigated under similar conditions (Fig. S4, ESI†). SDC exhibited 532 mW cm−2, whereas the GDC and YSZ-based SOFC delivered 426 and 151 mW cm−2 at 550 °C. Fig. S5 (ESI†), shows a 5-layer SOFC with a BZY filter layer to access the protonic conduction. A peak power density of 608 mW cm−2 with a BZY filter layer, which is about 58% for YDG-based SOFCs, suggests more proton conductivity. The enhanced Pmax is mainly ascribed to doping Y3+ into Gd2O3 significantly enhancing ionic conductivity. Another reason for the high performance is the enriched oxygen vacancies in YDG, as shown in the XPS. With high power density, the configured SOFC also manifested high OCVs > 1 V, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), eliminating the risk of short-circuiting in our work. Fig. 3c shows the YDG total conductivities calculated from the I–V polarization curve. YDG delivered 0.19 S cm−1 at 550 °C with low activation energy (Ea) calculated according to the Arrhenius equation σT = Aexp[−Ea/(kT)] as 0.53 eV. The main reasons for high performance are high ionic conductivity and low activation energy. Additionally, molten Li2CO3 incorporation into electrolytes from NCAL electrodes also plays a crucial role in obtaining such high ionic conductivity.20 Moreover, to prompt chemical stability, the YDG-based SOFC was operated under 100 mA cm−2 for 60 h. The cell voltage sustained a value of around 0.83 V from 60 h, verifying that the electrolyte and fuel cells were persistently stable, as shown in Fig. 3d. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows a cross-sectional SEM image. No cracks were observed, indicating thermal and chemical stability of the configured device, while Fig. S7 (ESI†) exhibits the structural stability of the YDG sample before and after durability measurements.

Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectra of the configured SOFC were measured in fuel cell conditions at 550–460 °C, as shown in Fig. 3b. The Ro(RctQct)(RmtQmt) equivalent circuit was employed for the EIS curve fitting, where Rct shows charge transfer while Rmt signifies mass transfer. Ro and Rp, represent ohmic and polarization resistance. Simulated parameters from EIS curves comprising characteristic capacitance at different temperatures of 550–460 °C are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). In EIS, the small semicircle at a higher-order frequency is assigned as the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, whereas the semicircle lower frequency represents the electrode polarization resistance.21 The YDG-based SOFC delivers a minimum ohmic resistance of 0.06–0.09 Ω cm2 at 550–460 °C. Small Ro and Rp with values of 0.06 and 0.2 Ω cm2 at 550 °C reflect the high ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and the fast catalytic activity of the NCAL electrodes. Even at 460 °C, the Ro was 0.09 Ω cm2, showing the high conducting capabilities of the prepared electrolyte at a low temperature. YDG with 10% Y doping shows minimum ohmic resistance compared to other samples, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). At 460 °C, an Rp < 0.9 Ω cm2 indicates better compatibility, promoting fast catalytic functionalities, eventually improving cell performance at such low temperatures.

Fig. 4(a and b) exhibit the electronic bandgaps of pure Gd2O3 and YDG while Fig. 4(c and d) show the DOSs of the Gd2O3 and YDG samples using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We observed that the measured electronic bandgap was in the semiconducting region and was in good agreement with our experimental data, as measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The YDG sample had an electronic bandgap of 2.29 eV, which was lower than that of the pure Gd2O3 sample (2.61 eV), indicating that the valence band edges shifted near the Fermi level (Ef) with the doping of the Gd oxide with Y. The conduction and valence band edges near the Fermi level provide a route for electron transfer, resulting in enhanced oxide ion conductivity. For further verification, the projected density of states (PDOS) of the YDG sample, including Y, Gd, and O DOSs, are presented in Fig. 4(c). The calculated DOSs are in good agreement with our electronic bandgap. The DOS data revealed that most of the area of the valence band edges was covered by O 2p states and Gd 4f states. The valence bands originated from the O p states and were quite similar to the electronic band structure. Hybridization and charge transfer rates play a key role in producing oxygen vacancies and promoting oxide ion conductivity. Mushtaq et al.22 further explained that DOSs near the Fermi level, as well as O 2p band shifting near the Fermi level, indicate that doping can be more favorable in enhancing the DOSs of the neighboring atoms, resulting in faster kinetics of charge transfer.23,24 Moreover, to evaluate the stability of O-vacancies in the proposed YDG lattice, the oxygen vacancy formation energy (E) was determined by removing the oxygen atom from the YDG lattice, followed by OG (Fig. S9, ESI†), as mentioned in the Experimental section. The obtained oxygen formation energy value of YDG was decreased to 4.83 eV, which was much lower than that of pure Gd2O3 (5.67 eV), 5% Y-doped Gd2O3 (5.23 eV), and 15% Y-doped Gd2O3 (5.12 eV). The lower oxygen vacancy suggests that the Y3+ doping of Gd2O3 may weaken the bond coordination between the O-atom, causing oxygen to easily escape from the surface lattice to generate more O-vacancies, resulting in enhanced oxide ionic conduction. Therefore, we may conclude from our DFT data that these findings are in good agreement with our XPS data, as shown by the dominant O 1s states.

In summary, YDG demonstrated high performance at low operating temperatures. XRD and TEM images confirmed the single-phase structure and surface morphology, while XPS verified enriched surface oxygen vacancies in YDG, which caused a significant improvement in ionic conductivity and interfacial conduction. Our electrochemical analysis revealed that the YDG fuel cell device delivered a PPD of 305–1046 mW cm−2 at 460–550 °C. On performing EIS, the configured cell delivers low ohmic resistance Ro of 0.06–0.09 Ω cm2 along with Rp of 0.22–1 Ω cm2 at 550–460 °C, respectively. Low ohmic and polarization resistance depicted high ionic conductivity and better compatibility with the electrode, further indicating fast catalytic functionality. The consistent operation of the cell at a fixed current density of 100 mA cm−2 for 60 h implies that the cell was persistently stable without any significant degradation. Furthermore, DFT analysis verified that the O 2p band shifted near the Fermi level, resulting in faster charge transfer kinetics. This study thus suggests that YDG-fabricated devices can work as high-performing and stable electrolytes at low operating temperatures.
