    , Accepted 3rd December 2008First published on 28th January 2009AbstractA new, well-defined diblock copolymer (P3HT-b-C60) based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene was synthesized. First, regioregular P3HT was synthesized through Grignard metathesis polymerization, and then methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) were copolymerized by using an end-functionalized P3HT as a macroinitiator for the atom transfer radical polymerization to yield a diblock copolymer (P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA)). A fullerene derivative functionalized with carboxylic acid, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA), was then chemically linked to the HEMA unit in the second block (P(MMA-r-HEMA)) to produce a diblock copolymer with the second block containing fullerenes. Annealing thin films of the copolymer revealed nanometer-scale phase separation, a more suitable morphology for enabling excitons generated in the P3HT domain to more efficiently reach the donor–acceptor interface, relative to simple blends of P3HT and C60. As a result, photoluminescence of the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer in the films showed a complete quenching of photoluminescence of P3HT, which is indicative of charge transfer between P3HT and fullerene.
Introduction
The need to develop inexpensive renewable energy resources stimulates scientific research for the production of efficient and low-cost photovoltaic devices. Polymer solar cells based on conjugated polymer and fullerenes have opened a new avenue to develop economically renewable energy resources, because they can be fabricated to extend over a large area by means of low-cost printing and coating techniques that can pattern photoactive organic materials on lightweight flexible substrates.1–3 Recently, it was reported that thin-film bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated by simple blending of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have improved significantly the power conversion efficiency.4–9 By optimizing device structure and manufacturing conditions, i.e., the choice of spin-coating solvent,10,11 slow drying of spin-coated films,5,12 thermal annealing13,14 and solvent annealing15,16 of blends, bulk heterojunction solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies as high as 4–5% under AM 1.5 (AM = air mass) illumination.
Despite remarkable recent progress, bulk heterojunction solar cells still have several problems for achieving the 10% power conversion efficiency level desired for commercialization. First, since the conjugated polymers and electron acceptors in bulk heterojunction solar cells have been randomly interspersed throughout the film, the electron donor (conjugated polymer) and/or electron acceptor (such as fullerene or its derivatives) may form isolated domains in which electrons and/or holes are trapped. Second, blends of conjugated polymer and fullerene derivatives usually result in macrophase separation, limiting charge separation and thereby lower power conversion efficiency in the photovoltaic device, because the phase-separated domain size (∼100 nm) is much larger than the exciton diffusion length (∼10 nm) in conjugated polymers.17,18
To overcome these limitations, synthetic attempts to synthesize donor–acceptor block-like copolymers have been made, because block copolymers may self-assemble into well-defined nanostructured morphologies (lamellae or cylinder), which can provide excitons with large interface for charge separation. Rod–coil diblock copolymers based on p-phenylenevinylene and partially fullerene-functionalized polystyrene have been proposed by Hadziioannou and his co-workers,19–21 and diblock copolymers consisting of poly(vinyltriphenylamines) and polyacrylate bearing perylene diimide have been synthesized by Lindner et al.22 However, the device performance of these diblock copolymers was sub-optimal, partly because the block copolymers do not contain the P3HT–fullerene pair, which has currently been known as the best pair for polymer solar cells.
Recently, various structures composed of polythiophene and fullerenes, i.e., graft-block type copolymer,23 oligothiophene–fullerene dyad,24 and double-cable polythiophene with C60,25 have been synthesized and their film morphologies were investigated. Although these copolymers have revealed some interesting morphologies, well-defined structures have not been observed, and as a result they did not show satisfactory photovoltaic properties. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that an ideal molecular structure for polymer photovoltaics would be a well-defined electron donor–acceptor type diblock copolymer based on P3HT (electron donor) and fullerene (electron acceptor).
As an approach to materialize this ideal molecular structure for an active layer material of polymer solar cells, in this paper, a new well-defined diblock copolymer based on P3HT and fullerene has been synthesized (Scheme 1). Very recently, Hadziioannou and his co-workers26 reported a similar work to ours about a fullerene-grafted P3HT-based rod–coil block copolymer. However, the molecular weight of P3HT in their block copolymer was not large enough to be suitable for the electron donor material, and moreover the microphase-separated morphology of the copolymer, which is very important for photovoltaic performances, was not presented in their paper.

To synthesize the well-defined diblock copolymer in this study, the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization (as described by McCullough and co-workers27) and the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) were used for P3HT block and fullerene-containing block, respectively. The chemical structure and self-assembly behavior of the diblock copolymers were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The photophysical property of the diblock copolymer in solid state was also investigated by UV-Visible and fluorescence spectroscopy.
Results and discussion
A new P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer was prepared by first synthesizing bromoester-terminated P3HT, which was used as a macroinitiator for ATRP (Scheme 1). Regioregular P3HT and the P3HT-macroinitiator from P3HT were synthesized according to the procedure reported in the literature.27,28 The P3HT-macroinitiator synthesized in this study exhibited reasonable molecular weight with narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn = 10500, Mw/Mn = 1.2 by GPC). The degree of regioregularity of the P3HT-macroinitiator is 98% when measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see ESI†).
The end-functionalized P3HT was used as a macroinitiator for the copolymerization (by ATRP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) to form the second block of the desired structure. The hydroxyl groups of HEMA provide handles for attaching fullerene derivatives to the polymer. It is noteworthy that the solubility of the diblock copolymer decreases with increasing HEMA content, as poly(HEMA) is soluble only in polar solvents such as DMF, water, and methanol, all poor solvents for P3HT. The molecular weight of the second block (P(MMA-r-HEMA)) was ca. 5000, and the mole fraction of HEMA in the second block was about 0.3, from which the number of MMA and HEMA units in the second block is estimated to be 30 and 12, respectively, when those are calculated from 1H NMR peak integrals, as shown in Fig. 1a. These calculated data were well matched with the data obtained from elemental analysis (see ESI†). The molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) are 14500 and 1.4, respectively, when measured by GPC.

        Carboxylate-functionalized fullerenes were linked covalently to HEMA in the second block to form the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer. For this we used carbodiimide (DCC/DMAP) esterification of the HEMA hydroxyls with the carboxylic acids of the fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA) (Scheme 1). Since the solubility of PCBA is very low (limited to CS2, pyridine, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and their mixtures), the esterification reaction between P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) and PCBA was carried out in the mixed solvent of 1,2-dichlorobenzene/CS2 (1 : 1, v/v). The crude product was dissolved in THF, a good solvent for P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) but a poor solvent for PCBA, filtered, and then centrifuged several times to remove unreacted PCBA. 1H NMR analysis unambiguously shows the a down-field shift of the methylene protons (δ = 4.3 ppm) upon HEMA esterification (Fig. 1b). Both the appearance of the aromatic proton peaks due to the phenyl group of PCBA in the 1H NMR spectra and the presence of typical C60 peaks (δ ≈ 130–150 ppm)29,30 in the 13C NMR spectrum (see ESI†) provide strong evidence that C60 is linked covalently to the diblock copolymer. On average, nine PCBAs were grafted onto each diblock copolymer, as calculated by integration of the 1H NMR signals, which corresponds to about 75% HEMA units linked with PCBA. The amount of PCBAs estimated from NMR is slightly higher than the amount (8.2 PCBAs) estimated from elemental analysis. This difference may arise from incomplete combustion of fullerenes at elemental analysis (see ESI). The final product, P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer, is soluble in various organic solvents such as THF, toluene, chloroform, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene.
The chemical structures of the P3HT-macroinitiator, P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA), and P3HT-b-C60 were also identified by FT-IR, as shown in Fig. 2. When the spectrum of the P3HT-macroinitiator is compared with that of the P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) spectrum, it reveals that three characteristic bands corresponding to OH stretching, CO stretching, and C–O stretching vibrations appear at 3100–3600 cm−1, 1735 cm−1, and 1150 cm−1, respectively, in the P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) spectrum, indicating that MMA and HEMA are successfully introduced by ATRP. After introduction of PCBMs, the significant decrease of the OH stretching band and the increase of the CO stretching band in the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer spectrum identify the formation of covalent bonding between the hydroxyl of HEMA and the carboxylic acid of PCBA.

Fig. 3 shows the GPC traces of the P3HT-macroinitiator, P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA), and P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer. The GPC trace of P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) shows a broad peak with a large shoulder where the high molecular weight shoulder corresponds to P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA), while the peak maximum at a later elution time corresponds to unreacted P3HT. After introduction of C60, the high molecular weight shoulder of P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) shifted to a higher molecular weight region (P3HT-b-C60) due to incorporation of C60 while the unreacted P3HT peak remained unchanged. Therefore, it is believed that fullerene derivatives (PCBA) are successfully introduced into P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) to form the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer while unreacted P3HT homopolymers are mixed in the reaction product. When the GPC trace of P3HT-b-C60 was decomposed into two components using a Gaussian function and then the areas of two components were compared to determine the fraction of diblock copolymer in the mixture (see the inset of Fig. 3), it revealed that the higher molecular weight part (P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer) occupied the majority of the reaction product (≥72%).

Inset shows a GPC trace of P3HT-b-C60 decomposed into two components, P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer and P3HT-macroinitiator. 

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to quantify the C60 content in the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer. Fig. 4 shows the TGA thermograms of PCBA, P3HT homopolymer, and P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer. PCBA shows minor decomposition at around 200 and 370 °C, due to the loss of a benzene ring and a short alkyl chain attached to C60, leaving a C60 adduct which shows the char yield of about 82%. Since both the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer and P3HT homopolymer exhibit significant weight loss in the ca. 400–500 °C range and the char yields of the diblock copolymer and homopolymer are about 51% and 29%, respectively, the weight fraction of C60 in the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer was estimated to be 0.4.

To examine the effect of PCBA on the crystallization of P3HT in the diblock copolymer, the XRD patterns were obtained from powders of the pristine PCBA, P3HT and PCBA blend (P3HT/PCBA, 1 : 1 (w/w)), P3HT homopolymer and P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer (Fig. 5). The P3HT homopolymer clearly shows a (100) reflection peak at 2θ = 5.4 °C corresponding to the chain–chain interlayer distance as well as the (010) reflection peak (2θ = 23.4 °C) caused by the stacking of the chains within the main chain layers.31 The P3HT/PCBA blend shows several sharp and broad peaks, whose position and shape are very close to those found on pure PCBA and the P3HT powder sample. In the diffraction pattern of the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 24 h, however, diffraction peaks from PCBA crystallites were not detected while (100) and (010) peaks from P3HT units in the diblock copolymer were clearly observed. Consequently, PCBA is not crystallized in the block copolymer while the P3HT units readily crystallize in the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer. This seems to be contradictory to the report of Barrau et al.,32 who observed the formation of fullerene nanocrystals in fullerene-grafted poly[(2,5-di(2′-ethyl)hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]-b-poly[butyl acrylate-stat-(4-methyl)styrene] (DEH-PPV-b-P(BA-stat-C60MS)) by XRD. They reported that the formation of these crystals is likely to impede microphase separation of the fullerene-grafted PPV-based diblock copolymer, and thus the resulting thin-film morphology is far from the target nanostructure and leads to photovoltaic devices with poor performances. The reason for the difference between their result and ours is believed that the PCBAs in the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer of our system do not aggregate to form fullerene nanocrystals due to a bulky substituent of PCBA while C60 in DEH-PPV-b-P(BA-stat-C60MS) of their system easily crystallizes because the pristine C60 was directly attached to the block copolymer.

Thin-film morphologies of the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymers were characterized by TEM. Thin films were prepared by spin-coating onto silicon wafers, containing a native surface oxide layer, from 1 wt% CHCl3/pyridine solution (90 : 10 v/v), followed by heating to 230 °C (above Tm of P3HT-b-C60) under high vacuum (10−6 Torr) for 5 h, slowly cooling to 150 °C (the melt crystallization temperature of P3HT-b-C60) and finally annealing at 150 °C for 24 h. Fig. 6 shows that some aggregation of PCBA (dark regions) is observed in the thin film of the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer before annealing (Fig. 6a), while the diblock copolymer exhibits a well-defined phase morphology with formation of bicontinuous structure after annealing (Fig. 6b). To confirm this annealing effect, we prepared additional thin films from different solvent mixtures, such as CHCl3/pyridine (95 : 5 v/v). As the volume fraction of pyridine in the mixed solvent is decreased, it is expected that the aggregation size of PCBA in the thin film is increased because the solubility of PCBA in the solvent (CHCl3/pyridine (95 : 5 v/v)) becomes poorer. However, the thin film also shows a well-defined bicontinuous nanostructure without significant PCBA aggregation, when it was annealed at 150 °C after complete melting of the sample at 230 °C (see ESI†). This result suggests that the bicontinuous nanostructure is the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the P3H-b-C60diblock copolymer.

It should be noted that the bicontinuous morphology provides a large interfacial area between P3HT and PCBA and that the characteristic length scale of the P3HT-b-C60block copolymer microdomain (10∼20 nm) is nearly matched with the exciton diffusion length (∼10 nm). Hence it is expected that the excitons generated in the P3HT domain reach the donor–acceptor interface more efficiently.

UV-Visible
spectra of thin films of the P3HT homopolymer and P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer are shown in Fig. 7, where the spectrum of P3HT/PCBM blend (1 : 1 (w/w)) is also shown for comparison. The films of the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer and P3HT/PCBM blend show π–π* absorption of polythiophene around 500 nm and 480 nm, respectively, indicating that both are red-shifted as compared to those in CHCl3 solution (450 nm, see ESI†) due to the π–π stacking of the thiophene unit in the solid state. The difference in the extent of red-shift between the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer and the P3HT/PCBM blend may arise from the fact that the bulky characteristic of the fullerene unit changes the aggregation behavior of P3HT units in the diblock copolymer. After thermal annealing, the absorption of both films increases and three vibronic absorption shoulders become clear, indicating an ordering of P3HT chains to form crystallites. Significant red-shift also appears in both films because crystalline order involves an enhanced conjugation length and hence a shift of the absorption spectrum to lower energies.5

Films were prepared by spin-coating from CHCl3 solutions (1 wt%) onto a glass substrate, and the films were annealed at 150 °C for 24 h. 
In order to examine qualitatively the efficiency of electron–hole separation at the donor–acceptor interface, we measured the photoluminescence quenching. The exciton generated in the P3HT domain can either reach the donor–acceptor interface where an exciton is separated into an electron and a hole and thus lose photoluminescence, or recombine before it reaches the interface to emit photoluminescence. When the photoluminescence spectrum of P3HT-b-C60 is compared with that of the P3HT/PCBM blend, it reveals that the P3HT-b-C60 in the film state shows almost complete quenching of photoluminescence while the P3HT/PCBM blend film still exhibits some photoluminescence emission, as shown in Fig. 8. Since the photoluminescence quenching is a measure of the charge transfer between P3HT and fullerene, this result suggests that the charge transfer takes place more efficiently in the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer film than in the P3HT/PCBM blend film. This can be explained by the fact that the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer has a larger interfacial area between P3HT and fullerene than the P3HT/PCBM blend, arising from microphase-separated domains of the diblock copolymer.

For quantitative comparison, the three films were prepared such that the sample contains the same amount of P3HT: 0.5 wt% of P3HT homopolymer, 1 wt% of P3HT/PCBM blend, and 0.8 wt% of P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer in CHCl3. 
Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized a new, well-defined diblock copolymer based on a P3HT and fullerene derivative via two controlled polymerization steps (GRIM polymerization and ATRP) followed by linking a fullerene derivate (PCBA) to the second block. When thin films of the diblock copolymer (P3HT-b-C60) are thermally annealed, P3HT-b-C60 showed phase separation on a nanometer scale, which allows the excitons generated in the P3HT domain to reach the donor–acceptor interface more efficiently. When the photoluminescence spectrum of the P3HT-b-C60 film is compared with that of the P3HT/PCBM simple blend film, it reveals that P3HT-b-C60 shows complete quenching of the photoluminescence while the P3HT/PCBM blend exhibits some photoluminescence, indicating that the charge transfer between P3HT and C60 takes place more effectively in the P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer than in the P3HT/PCBM blend.
Experimental
Materials
A Buckminsterfullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA), was purchased from Materials Technologies Research (Cleveland, OH). Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (98%) was recrystallized from toluene. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen and freshly distilled before use. Toluene was dried over calcium hydride under nitrogen and freshly distilled before use. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) (99%, from Acros) was passed through a column of basic alumina before use. 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) (99%, from Aldrich) was dried over 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled just before use. All other reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, WI) and used as received.
Synthesis of P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA)
First, the regioregular P3HT-macroinitiator was synthesized by following the procedure reported in the literature,27,28 and then P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) was synthesized by ATRP using the P3HT-macroinitiator. 0.1 g of P3HT-macroinitiator (Mn,NMR = 10500, Mw/Mn = 1.2 by GPC) was placed in a 25 mL pear-shaped flask, to which 2 mL of previously degassed toluene was added by syringe, after the flask with the macroinitiator was degassed and backfilled with argon gas. The macroinitiator solution was stirred until it became homogeneous. Monomer solution was prepared separately: MMA (1 mL, 9.5 mmol), HEMA (0.25 mL, 2 mmol), N,N,N′,N′,N″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) (0.02 mL, 0.1 mmol) and CuBr (7.2 mg, 0.05 mmol) were added in a 50 mL round-bottom flask, and the flask was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. The monomer solution was stirred until it became homogeneous, and then placed in a 90 °C oil bath. When the macroinitiator solution was added by cannula into the monomer solution, the mixture solution became homogenous with a dark orange color. After the solution was allowed to react for 12 h at 90 °C, the resultant polymer solution was diluted with 50 mL of THF. The solution was then passed through a column of Al2O3 to remove copper. The polymer solution was concentrated, and then precipitated into n-hexane. The precipitated polymer was collected by vacuum filtration and subsequently washed with n-hexane and methanol, followed by drying under a vacuum to give 0.18 g of desired product corresponding to 14% of conversion.
Synthesis of P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer
In a 100 mL round-bottom flask, 0.05 g of P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) and PCBA (0.045 g, 0.05 mmol) were added, and the flask was degassed under vacuum and backfilled with argon gas. 15 mL of dichlorobenzene/CS2 (50 : 50 v/v) and 3.5 mg of DMAP (0.03 mmol) were added to the reaction mixture, and the resultant solution was sonicated for 30 min to dissolve PCBA completely. Then, 60 mg of 1,3-dicylohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 0.3 mmol) dissolved in 5 mL of dichlorobenzene/CS2 (50 : 50 v/v) was dropwise added using a syringe and the reaction solution was stirred at 40 °C for 3 days. After removal of the solvent, the crude product was dissolved in THF and filtered. Unreacted PCBA was separated by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 30 min), and the supernatant solution was concentrated and filtered. This centrifugation and filtration step was repeated 3 times, and then precipitated into methanol. The precipitated polymer was filtered and dried under vacuum to give 0.08 g (84% yield) of the desired product.
Preparation of P3HT-b-C60 thin films for TEM
Thin films for morphological investigation were prepared by spin-coating (3000 rpm) from 9 : 1 CHCl3/pyridine solutions (1 wt%) onto silicon wafers with a native oxide surface layer. The sample was heated in a vacuum oven (10−6 Torr) at 230 °C for 5 h, slowly cooled down to 150 °C and then annealed at that temperature for 24 h. The films were then floated onto water and placed on a 500-mesh copper TEM grid.
Characterization

NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 400 (referenced to CDCl3: 1H NMR at 400 MHz and 13C NMR at 100 MHz). FT-IR spectra of all synthesized polymers were obtained on an IR spectrometer (FT/IR-660 plus, Jasco). Elemental analyses were performed by EA1112 (CE Instruments, Italy). The GPC measurements were done in THF (35 °C, 1.0 mL/min) using a Knauer K-501 pump with a K-2301 refractive index detector and a column bank consisting of two Polymer Labs PLGel Mixed D columns and one PLGel 50 Å column (1.5 × 30 cm). Molecular weights are reported relative to polystyrene standards. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out with a DuPont TGA 2950 at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. X-Ray diffraction patterns were recorded with an M18XHF-SRA diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation. TEM was performed on a JEOL 100CX microscope with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. UV-Visible absorption and fluorescence spectra were obtained on a HP 8452A spectrometer and a Perkin-Elmer LS-55 fluorimeter, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out on a TA Instruments 2910 Modulated DSC (DuPont). Samples were heated and cooled from 20 to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  Synthesis scheme of P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer. PMDETA: N,N,N′,N′,N″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine; DCC: 1,3-dicylohexylcarbodiimide; DMAP: dimethylaminopyridine.	 

 	Fig. 1  
1H NMR spectra of (a) P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) and (b) P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer in CDCl3.	 

 	Fig. 2  
FT-IR spectra of (a) P3HT-macroinitiator, (b) P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA), and (c) P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer.	 

 	Fig. 3  
          GPC traces of P3HT-macroinitiator (dotted line), P3HT-b-P(MMA-r-HEMA) (dashed line), and P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer (solid line) in THF with refractive index detection. Inset shows a GPC trace of P3HT-b-C60 decomposed into two components, P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer and P3HT-macroinitiator.	 

 	Fig. 4  
          TGA curves of PCBA, P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer, and P3HT homopolymer.	 

 	Fig. 5  
          Powder X-ray diffractograms of pristine PCBA, P3HT/PCBA blend, P3HT, and P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 24 h.	 

 	Fig. 6  
          TEM images of the self-assembled structure of P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer (a) before and (b) after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 24 h. Inset shows a higher magnification image.	 

 	Fig. 7  
UV-Visible
spectra of thin films of P3HT (solid line), P3HT/PCBM blend before (dashed-dotted line) and after (dashed-dotted-dotted line) thermal annealing, and P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer before (dotted line) and after (dashed line) thermal annealing. Films were prepared by spin-coating from CHCl3 solutions (1 wt%) onto a glass substrate, and the films were annealed at 150 °C for 24 h.	 

 	Fig. 8  
Photoluminescence spectra of thin films of P3HT (solid line), P3HT/PCBM blend (dashed-dotted-dotted line), and P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer (dashed line). The excitation wavelength was 500 nm. For quantitative comparison, the three films were prepared such that the sample contains the same amount of P3HT: 0.5 wt% of P3HT homopolymer, 1 wt% of P3HT/PCBM blend, and 0.8 wt% of P3HT-b-C60diblock copolymer in CHCl3.
