    , Accepted 27th October 2019First published on 30th October 2019AbstractMany bottom-up nanostructuring approaches have benefitted the research field of electrocatalysis by significantly increasing the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. In general, however, they require tedious wet chemistry steps and delicate control while managing considerable surface energies. In addition, they often suffer from scalability issues. As part of an effort to address these issues, we developed a simple two-step thermal route to produce a nanostructured electrocatalyst with high catalytic activity from its bulk form. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of core/shell CoO/CoSx from bulk Co3O4 as a case study. Our novel approach uses a low-temperature thermal treatment under NH3 and a subsequent treatment in a H2S atmosphere, judiciously exploiting the unique features of each reaction atmosphere. Hot NH3 treatment reduces Co3O4 to CoO, during which a significant lattice mismatch between the Co3O4 and CoO fractures crystallites, and the coalescence of oxygen vacancies introduces porosity. Subsequent H2S treatment specifically forms electrocatalytically active CoSx species on the surface of CoO. We explore the use of the resulting nanostructured CoO/CoSx as an alternative to state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts in the triiodide reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, finding that its activity is comparable to those of standard catalysts. Given the simplicity and scalability of this innovative low-temperature reaction concept, we anticipate that the present demonstration will open new avenues for the synthesis of highly active electrocatalysts.
Introduction
Electrocatalytically active materials are an important class of functional materials that are fundamental constituents of various energy conversion and storage devices.1,2 In general, electrocatalysis requires a catalytic material with high active surface area, high stability, and good electrical conductivity. However, bulk materials usually suffer from low catalytic activity due to various inherent restrictions such as low surface area and limited ion diffusion. Therefore, over the past few decades, many efforts have been devoted to designing nanostructured materials to overcome the limitations of bulk materials and to enhance their properties for specific applications.3 In the field of electrocatalysis, nanostructuring strategies have primarily been dedicated to increasing the number of electrocatalytically active sites because the availability of sites is the most critical factor governing catalytic activity.4 Nanostructuring strategies have addressed a wide variety of materials, including metals, oxides, chalcogenides, nitrides, phosphides, carbides, and composites with different phases and compositions,5 and cobalt oxides are among them because of the promise of high catalytic ability of cobalt in various electrocatalytic reactions.6
Many nanostructuring strategies based on bottom-up approaches have improved the electrocatalytic ability of cobalt oxides. Such efforts have included the synthesis of cobalt oxides as nanocages,7,8 nanocones,9 nanoflowers,10 hollow structures,11–13 and nanoneedles.14 Efforts have been made to combine nanostructured cobalt oxides with other materials as nanocomposites or core/shell materials to further address their shortcomings.15–18 Despite the many benefits that bottom-up nanostructuring can offer, it has several limitations. It generally involves multistep processes such as tedious, cost-ineffective purification steps, and most important of all, it is not always scalable to the level of mass production.19,20 Therefore, to achieve large-scale production of nanostructured materials it will be indispensable to develop a top-down approach that can offer some of the advantages of the bottom-up nanostructuring strategies while also being based upon simpler, cost-effective processing.
In the present work we demonstrate a novel solid-state route to a nanostructured Co-based electrocatalyst. The uniqueness of our approach lies in the use of bulk Co3O4, which is a semiconducting material (∼10−5 S cm−1)21 with very limited active sites, and transforming it into a highly active electrocatalyst via a simple two-step thermal treatment. In this thermally induced top-down approach, we carefully apply the reducing power of hot NH3 (ref. 22–24) to convert bulk Co3O4 into nanostructured CoO with higher electrical conductivity (∼10−2 S cm−1),25 and use a subsequent hot H2S treatment to specifically form an electrocatalytically active CoSx phase on the surface of the CoO. Owing to the enhanced electrical conductivity and increased surface area of CoO combined with the good electrocatalytic activity of CoSx, the resulting core/shell CoO/CoSx exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity in the triiodide reduction reaction (IRR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), demonstrating the advantages of our newly devised nanostructuring approach for the preparation of highly efficient electrocatalysts.
Experimental
Synthesis of core/shell nanostructured CoO/CoSx
Spherical bulk Co3O4 particles were synthesized by means of a previously reported method.26 To summarize, 1.25 mmol of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate was added to 50 mL of a 3:1 mixture of saturated aqueous ammonia and deionized water. The solution was stirred at 600 rpm for 10 min. One gram of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-K30, average molecular weight of 40000) was then added to the solution and mixed for another 20 min. The solution was then put into a 70 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 8 h to carry out hydrothermal synthesis of Co3O4. The product was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min and washed with deionized water and then ethanol. The obtained powder was dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. To synthesize nanostructured CoO, the as-prepared Co3O4 was heated under an NH3 atmosphere for 10 min at 300 °C; the reaction was carried out in a tube furnace heated to 300 °C at 10 °C min−1. To create a CoSx phase on the CoO surface, the CoO powder was thermally treated under Ar/H2S mixed gas (5% H2S) for 1 h at 270 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Characterization
The morphologies and microstructures of the synthesized materials were observed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Tescan VEGA3) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL-2100F). X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2500/PC). A surface area analyzer (BELSORP-mini II, BEL Japan) was used to measure N2 physisorption isotherms at 77 K. Specific surface areas were determined by means of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and pore size distributions were calculated by means of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
Fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass was cleaned in a mixture of isopropanol, ethanol, and acetone (1:1:1) solution under sonication for 30 min. A compact TiO2 film was deposited onto the cleaned FTO glass by dipping it into a 40 mM TiCl4 solution (0.04 M) at 70 °C for 30 min. The resulting glass was rinsed with water and then ethanol. A 10 μm mesoporous layer (Solaronix T/SP) and a 5 μm scattering layer (Dyesol DSL 18NR-AO) of TiO2 were applied onto the FTO glass by means of screen printing. The TiO2 films were then annealed in a furnace at 550 °C for 1 h. To improve contact among TiO2 particles, the as-prepared TiO2 film was treated with 40 mM TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min. After this treatment, the TiO2 films were rinsed with water and then ethanol. An additional heat treatment was carried out in air at 450 °C for 30 min to crystallize the amorphous TiO2 deposited during the TiCl4 treatment. The completed TiO2 electrode was immersed in a 0.1 M HNO3 solution for 15 min and then dipped in a 0.5 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye at 40 °C for 2 h to allow dye adsorption.
To prepare counter electrodes (CEs), each electrocatalyst was blended with carbon black (Super P) and carboxymethyl cellulose in a ratio of 18:1:1 in an aqueous solution. Each resulting paste was spread onto the cleaned FTO glass by means of doctor blading to prepare a 60 μm thick film. The films were then vacuum dried at 120 °C for 12 h. Pt electrodes were prepared by means of sputtering onto the FTO glass. DSSC devices were assembled with the N719-sensitized TiO2 film as the photoanode, an I−/I3− redox couple (Dyesol, EL-HPE) as the electrolyte, and one of the CEs. Prior to assembly, a 60 μm Surlyn sheet was melted onto the CE to serve as a separator between the photoelectrode and the CE.
Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements to examine IRR activity were performed using a CHI 660D potentiostat (CH Instruments) in a three-electrode system (Ag/Ag+ quasi-reversible reference electrode and Pt wire as the CE) in an acetonitrile solution of 50 mM LiI, 10 mM I2, and 500 mM LiClO4. Tafel polarization measurements were carried out using symmetric dummy cells composed of two identical CEs in the voltage range of −0.6 to 0.6 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the dummy cells was carried out in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV. Current–voltage (J–V) responses of the DSSCs (active area: 0.188 cm2) were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated solar illumination (HAL-320, Asahi Spectra). Prior to measurements, a standard silicon diode (CS-20, Asahi Spectra) was used to calibrate the light intensity of the solar simulator to one sun conditions (air mass 1.5 G).
For OER experiments, 5 mg of active material was dispersed in 250 μL of a 1:1 mixture of deionized water and ethanol including 5 wt% Nafion and then sonicated for 2 h. An aliquot of 10 μL of this mixture was drop-cast onto a polished glassy carbon (GC) electrode and dried at room temperature. IrO2 powder (99%, Alfa Aesar) was used as a control active material. The BET surface area of the IrO2 was as low as 2.07 m2 g−1. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and CV measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system with a Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode, Pt wire as the CE, and 0.1 M KOH (pH = 12.73) as the electrolyte, using a CHI 660D potentiostat. All used potentials measured against Hg/HgO were converted with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by using the following equation: E(RHE) = E(Hg/HgO) + 0.059 × pH + 0.098. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was estimated from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of each catalyst tested.27,28 CVs were recorded at scan rates of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mV s−1 in a potential range in which no apparent faradaic processes occurred. Cdl values were estimated by plotting j = ja − jc (where ja and jc are the anodic and cathodic current densities) against the scan rates. The linear slope is twice Cdl.29 ECSA was determined using the equation ECSA = Rf × S, where Rf (Rf = Cdl/Cs) is a roughness factor calculated from the ratio of the Cdl of each catalyst and that of the GC electrode (Cs), and S is the geometric area of the smooth surface of the GC electrode (0.196 cm2). Turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated according to the following equation:30 (1)where j is the measured geometrical current density at a given overpotential, A is the surface area of the GC electrode, the factor 4 represents the four electrons transferred per molecule of O2, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the number of moles of an active material. EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 10 mHz with 5 mV perturbation.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of CoO/CoSx
The bulk Co3O4 used to synthesize nanostructured CoO/CoSx particles was composed of solid spherical particles (Fig. 1a and b). Upon conversion to CoO and subsequently to CoO/CoSx, no significant change in particle shape was observed (Fig. 1), confirming that the overall structures and shapes of the particles were preserved during the conversion of Co3O4 into CoO/CoSx. A significant shrinkage in particle size upon the formation of CoO was expected because Co3O4 lost a significant amount of oxygen during its reduction by hot NH3; however, cobalt oxide particles at all stages of synthesis showed particle sizes of 700 ± 100 nm. Therefore, the loss of oxygen in Co3O4 must have resulted in the formation of cavities inside the particles. This conjecture will be discussed in more detail later. It is noteworthy that hot H2 may perform the same function, but it turned out that its reducing power was so great that Co metal, rather than CoO, was primarily formed and the metal particles were partly melted and fused (Fig. S1 and S2†). Hence, the mild reducing power of hot NH3 that offered a better control was crucial to our top-down nanostructuring strategy.

The Co3O4 particles had a high degree of crystallinity, with crystallite sizes greater than 90 nm (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The thermal treatment under NH3 initiated a phase transformation from Co3O4 to CoO, representing a loss of oxygen. When the temperature reached 290 °C, peaks from the CoO phase began to appear in the reaction intermediate. It should be noted here that the CoO crystallites that were formed up to this stage were merely 4.8 nm in size (Fig. 2 and Table 1). After the temperature was held at 300 °C for 10 min, all Co3O4 was transformed into CoO, which had an average grain size of 13.3 nm. Subsequent thermal treatment of the CoO particles in a H2S environment resulted in the substitution of some oxygen with sulfur. XRD analysis showed that there were new peaks associated with the formation of the CoSx phase (Fig. 2), but the CoSx peaks were not resolved well enough to allow estimation of their crystallite size. Furthermore, at this point it was not yet clear where the CoSx crystallites were located. We carried out the Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern obtained (Fig. S5†), according to which we determined the amount of each component in CoO/CoSx, which was 86.2% for CoO, 11.9% for CoS, and 1.9% for Co3S4.

Changes in morphology and composition during the reduction and sulfurization were further probed by means of TEM analysis (Fig. 3). Co3O4 appeared to be composed of solid particles having little porosity (Fig. 3a–c). Furthermore, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 3d) confirmed a high degree of crystallinity. At the partial conversion stage, however, voids were observed throughout the particle, which resulted from merging of oxygen vacancies created during the phase transformation. Small grains of CoO trapped in Co3O4 were indeed identified in high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and FFT analysis (Fig. 3g–h). After the reduction was complete, the remaining Co3O4 was completely converted into CoO, and porosity was more apparent (Fig. 3i–l). In addition, XRD analysis revealed that the grain size of the CoO was significantly decreased to 13.3 nm compared to the 91.2 nm size of the parent Co3O4. This was an interesting observation because thermal treatment generally results in grain growth. To explain this exotic phenomenon, we speculated that a drastic change in crystalline structure might have played a pivotal role, along with loss of oxygen during the phase transformation. There is a significant difference in lattice parameters between Co3O4 (a = b = c = 8.084 Å) and CoO (a = b = c = 4.263 Å), which could cause the fracture of the original crystals into smaller crystallites, owing to the accumulation of internal stress (Scheme S1†).19 As a result, the CoO particles had very small crystallites and were highly internally porous. Surprisingly, despite these dramatic changes, the original shape of the particles remained intact and no structural collapse was observed.

Compared to the bulk Co3O4, the nanostructured CoO had more exposed surface area and increased cobalt content, which might result in better electrocatalytic activity. However, it would be desirable to further modify the surface of the CoO to further increase its electrocatalytic activity. To this end, we introduced a thin CoSx layer over the CoO surface. An outer layer of CoSx over the CoO core could be beneficial in many ways. First, CoSx can act as a precursor of highly active surface species.31–33 Second, by virtue of its intrinsic metallic character,34,35 CoSx has greater electrical conductivity than CoO, which could promote catalytic activity. Third, a synergistic effect of the multiple components (sulfide and oxide) in the core/shell material can be expected.36–39 To form the sulfide phase, the nanostructured CoO particles were heated under a H2S environment. This resulted in the replacement of some of the oxygen in CoO with sulfur. There was no major change in the overall shape, morphology, or internal structure of the CoO particles after sulfurization (Fig. 3m and n). However, FFT analysis and HRTEM imaging confirmed that the particle surfaces consisted of CoS and Co3S4 phases (Fig. 3o and p). It was still unclear whether the substitution of oxygen with sulfur during the H2S treatment occurred only on the surface or whether it occurred uniformly throughout the particles. Hence, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed to determine the spatial distribution of each element. Elemental mapping of a particle showed a very uniform distribution of oxygen and cobalt throughout the particle; in contrast, the distribution of sulfur was somewhat uneven, being more concentrated near the particle's surface (Fig. 4). These findings were confirmed by line mapping of these three elements; while cobalt and oxygen concentrations were fairly uniform throughout the particle, sulfur was clearly more abundant near the surface (Fig. 4f). These results clearly indicated that the CoSx species were present mainly on the particle surfaces, and thus formed a core/shell structure with CoO.

Changes in surface area were investigated more closely by means of N2 physisorption measurements (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Isotherms of Co3O4 showed almost no hysteresis, and the BET surface area of Co3O4 was calculated to be merely 2.28 m2 g−1. However, the surface area increased by more than 12 times upon conversion to CoO, and the pore sizes of CoO were between 2 and 20 nm. These results were consistent with observations from TEM analysis of CoO, in which mesopores were clearly evident. Thus, the physisorption measurements reconfirmed the formation of spherical particles consisting of small interconnected CoO crystallites and having high internal porosity. The formation of a CoSx phase on the CoO surface resulted in a decrease of surface area from 27.64 to 10.79 m2 g−1, but the latter figure was still almost 5 times the surface area of the original Co3O4. More importantly, the formation of CoSx decreased the overall pore volume of CoO by only 17% and increased the mean pore diameter from 9.6 to 20.2 nm. Given these results, smaller pores must have merged together to form larger pores during the H2S treatment, thereby producing little change in pore volume but a considerable reduction in surface area.

Electrochemical performance of CoO/CoSx

IRR electrocatalytic activity. 
CoO/CoSx was explored as an alternative electrocatalyst to Pt for the CE of DSSCs. Because the electrolyte most commonly used in DSSSs is the I−/I3− redox couple, the electrocatalytic activity of CoO/CoSx in the IRR was compared to that of Pt by means of CV in a three-electrode system with the iodine couple. Cyclic voltammograms of Pt and CoO/CoSx electrodes were measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (see Fig. S4a and b† for cyclic voltammograms measured at different scan rates); the current response consisted of two sets of redox peaks (Fig. 6a), which were attributed to the following reactions:40–42 3I− ↔ I−3 + 2e− (low potential region)(2) 2I−3 ↔ 3I2 + 2e− (high potential region)(3)

(d) Nyquist plots of symmetric dummy cells made of CoO/CoSx and Pt electrodes. Solid lines in (d) are fitting lines based upon the equivalent circuits presented in Fig S4d and e.† 
Among these reactions, the redox reaction of I−/I3− is related to the electrocatalytic behavior of the CE in DSSCs. Therefore, herein we focus on the redox peaks in the low potential region to ascertain the performance of CoO/CoSx. The peak intensity of the oxidation and reduction peaks (Ip) and the peak separation between them (Epp) were comparable for CoO/CoSx and Pt. Furthermore, diffusion coefficients (Dc) were calculated from the linear proportionality of the peak current (Ip) vs. the square root of scan rate (ν1/2) using the Randles–Sevcik equation (Ip = (2.65 × 105)n3/2ACDc1/2ν1/2, where n is the number of electrons involved in the IRR, A is the area of the electrode, and C is the concentration of electrolyte); these coefficients were determined to be 3.89 × 10−6 and 2.71 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for Pt and CoO/CoSx, respectively (Fig. 6b). The similar values of Ip, Epp, and Dc for the two electrode materials clearly indicated that the IRR activity of CoO/CoSx was as good as that of Pt. Tafel polarization analysis (Fig. S4c†) further supported the results of the CV analysis. The exchange currents (i0 = RT/nFRct, where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance) of Pt and CoO/CoSx estimated from the extrapolated intercepts of the anodic and cathodic branches were both approximately 3.8 mA, confirming their similar charge transfer resistances associated with the IRR. The limiting current (Jlim = 2nFCDc/l, where C is the concentration of I3− and l is the spacer thickness) at high overpotentials was observed to be slightly greater for Pt, in agreement with the trend in Dc determined by means of CV. All these results strongly suggested that CoO/CoSx could be a competitive alternative to Pt as a CE material for DSSCs. Hence, CoO/CoSx was further evaluated in a full-cell configuration and compared with other cobalt oxides. A DSSC equipped with a CE composed of Co3O4 showed a PCE of only 3.92% (Fig. 6c and Table 2), which was attributed to the poor IRR activity of bulk Co3O4. The use of porous CoO as a CE improved the PCE of the DSSC to 4.65%, but the IRR activity of CoO still seemed to be inferior to that of Pt. However, CoO/CoSx showed a significantly improved PCE of 7.27%, which was as high as that of Pt. This greatly improved catalytic activity of CoO/CoSx was primarily attributed to better energetics of adsorption of iodide species on the sulfide surface compared to that on the oxide surface.31,34,43 In addition, the better electrical conductivity of CoSx compared to CoO may be part of the reason for the improved DSSC performance. EIS analysis of symmetric dummy cells provided more insight into the electrocatalytic properties of CoO/CoSx toward the IRR (Fig. 6d). The Nyquist plot of Pt was well modelled by a Randles circuit. However, CoO/CoSx was combined with activated carbon to make CEs, which introduced an additional interface. Therefore, an extra resistor–capacitor component was required to fit the Nyquist plots of CoO/CoSx (Fig. S4d and e†).44 Correcting for this difference, CoO/CoSx had very similar equivalent series resistance, charge transfer resistance, and Nernst diffusion impedance to Pt (Fig. 6d and Table S1†). These results verified the superior electrocatalytic activity of CoO/CoSx for the IRR.

When the sulfurization was prolonged or performed at higher temperatures, CoO/CoSx was able to fully convert to sulfide (denoted as CoSx), but no pure sulfides such as CoS or Co3S4 were obtained. We prolonged the sulfurization time to 1 h in order to fully convert CoO/CoSx into CoSx and compared the electrocatalytic activity of CoO/CoSx with that of CoSx. Full characterization results of CoSx are provided in Fig. S6–S8.† When examined as an electrocatalyst for the IRR (Fig. S9 and Table S2†), the performance of a DSSC equipped with CoSx (PCE: 6.73%) was inferior to that of a DSSC with CoO/CoSx (PCE: 7.27%). We attributed this inferior catalytic activity partly to the decreased surface area and the less porous nature of CoSx (Fig. S7 and S8†). In addition, a synergistic effect of the multiple components in CoO/CoSx may play a role. However, another important reason for the decreased catalytic activity could be a change in the composition of the mixed CoS and Co3S4 phase, because the electrocatalytic activity of cobalt sulfide is composition-dependent—sulfur-deficient CoSx is more active than sulfur-rich CoSx.34 As demonstrated in Fig. S10,† the full conversion of CoO/CoSx into CoSx boosted the formation of sulfur-rich CoSx (Co3S4). Therefore, the relative proportion of the more active sulfide species (CoS) kept decreasing in an attempt to produce CoSx. We speculated that the unbeatable dominance of CoS over Co3S4 in CoO/CoSx compared to CoSx could be one of the key factors for the observed high catalytic activity.


OER electrocatalytic activity. 
Cobalt-based materials have received great attention as alternatives to noble metal catalysts due to their excellent electrocatalytic performance in various electrocatalytic reactions.45,46 To further explore the advantages of CoO/CoSx as a multifunctional electrocatalyst, we examined the catalytic activity of CoO/CoSx in the OER, comparing it with that of Co3O4, CoO, and a state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst (see the electron micrographs of IrO2 in Fig. S11†). In iR-compensated polarization curves recorded at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1, Co3O4 showed a current density only slightly higher than that of a bare GC electrode (Fig. 7a). However, the nanostructured CoO showed a significant improvement in current density, presumably due to its higher Co content and significantly greater surface area (i.e., more numerous active sites). In addition, unlike the relatively inert Co3O4, CoO has an excellent ability to form amorphous active surfaces (e.g., CoOOH–Co(OH)2), which may be partly responsible for this enhancement.47,48 More interestingly, CoO/CoSx performed even better than IrO2. The overpotential of CoO/CoSx at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was 303 mV, which was less than that of IrO2 by 41 mV (Fig. 7a inset). Tafel plots of each catalyst were used to estimate exchange current densities (j0) and Tafel slopes (Fig. 7b). The Tafel slope is a useful metric that can provide insight into reaction mechanisms, particularly the rate-determining step.49 In a multi-electron reaction, smaller Tafel slopes, which indicate good electrocatalysts, suggest that the final electron transfer reaction step is the rate-determining step.50 The Tafel slope of Co3O4 was 117 mV dec−1, indicating that the slowest step in the OER over Co3O4 was the first electron transfer step. In contrast, the Tafel slopes of CoO, CoO/CoSx, and IrO2 were 96, 58, and 65 mV dec−1, respectively, indicating that the OER over these catalysts had different rate-determining steps. In particular, the close proximity of the Tafel slopes of CoO/CoSx and IrO2 to the Tafel slope value of 60 mV dec−1 suggests that the OER kinetics in these two catalysts is governed by the equilibrium state between OH adsorption and O–O bond formation on the active site.51 The j0 values of Co3O4, CoO, CoO/CoSx, and IrO2 were 0.436, 0.743, 1.169, and 0.926 mA cm−2, respectively, which were consistent with the observed trend in overpotential. This superior OER activity of CoO/CoSx likely arose from metal sulfides' ability to form amorphous oxide surface species during the OER that are highly active toward the OER.32,33 To test this speculation, we measured the ECSA and charge transfer resistance (Rct) of each of the catalysts by analyzing their CVs (Fig. S12†) and EIS spectra (Fig. 7c and d). The ECSA of CoO/CoSx was estimated to be 4.70 cm2, while those of CoO and Co2O3 were merely 0.54 and 0.58 cm2, respectively (Table S3†). Given the greater BET surface area of CoO compared to CoO/CoSx, the significantly greater ECSA of CoO/CoSx clearly supported our hypothesis regarding the role of CoSx. Furthermore, the Rct of CoO/CoSx as calculated from the EIS analysis was as low as 21.77 Ω cm2 (Table S4†), which was substantially lower than those of CoO and Co3O4 (185.24 and 952.36 Ω cm2). These results confirmed that the surface species formed in situ on CoO/CoSx were indeed highly active in the OER. Because all the catalysts had different surface areas, data on current density normalized by geometric area were not useful in determining the intrinsic catalytic activity of each catalyst. To this end, TOF was estimated to serve as a better metric to judge the catalysts' intrinsic OER activities. The calculated TOFs of Co3O4, CoO, CoO/CoSx, and IrO2 at an overpotential of 400 mV were 0.81, 2.79, 3.46, and 5.03 s−1, respectively. Although the TOF of CoO/CoSx was smaller than that of IrO2, it is noteworthy that the intrinsic catalytic activity of CoO/CoSx was about 4.3 times that of the starting material (Co3O4), highlighting the benefits of our new synthesis route as a simple way to prepare highly active electrocatalysts from bulk materials. Because the synthesis of CoO/CoSx was not fully optimized and the calculated TOFs were based on the assumption that all active sites are electrocatalytically active, which is not necessarily true, we speculate that there is room for further improvement of the OER activity of CoO/CoSx. The stability of CoO/CoSx was evaluated by means of a continuous CV cycling experiment, during which the current density at 1.7 V vs. RHE decreased by only 6%, from 56.1 to 53.0 mA cm−2, after 1000 CV cycles (Fig. S12f†), demonstrating that CoO/CoSx has excellent long-term stability.

Conclusions
Despite the great contribution of nanostructuring strategies to a recent explosive growth in electrocatalysis, there are several limitations associated with the bottom-up approaches that these strategies are primarily based on. To overcome these limitations, in the present work we have devised a simple top-down nanostructuring strategy involving sequential reduction and sulfurization under solid-state conditions, and have successfully demonstrated the preparation of a highly active Co-based electrocatalyst from bulk Co3O4. The unique reducing power of hot NH3 is harnessed to transform solid Co3O4 into nanostructured CoO via grain fracture induced by internal stress and coalescence of oxygen voids, and a subsequent H2S thermal treatment forms electrocatalytically active CoSx species on the nanostructured CoO surface. When utilized as an alternative to noble metal catalysts in the IRR and OER, the resulting core/shell structured CoO/CoSx exhibits superior catalytic activity, comparable to those of state-of-the-art catalysts such as Pt and IrO2. This low-temperature thermal route is simple and scalable, and we anticipate that the approach can be easily extended to other oxides, highlighting its versatility as a generalizable method to prepare highly active electrocatalysts (see Fig. S14–S16† for some preliminary results). Currently, efforts are underway in this direction to further explore its benefits.
