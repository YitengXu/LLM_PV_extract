    , Accepted 30th May 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractWe report for the first time the use of a carbonyl-bridged triarylamine core with diketopyrrolopyrrole terminal units to generate a three-dimensional, non-planar non-fullerene electron acceptor with favourable properties for use in organic photovoltaic devices. The carbonyl-bridged triarylamine-functionalized, small molecule non-fullerene electron acceptor, 2,6,10-tris(5-(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-dioxo-4-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-1-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H-benzo[9,1]quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7-defg]acridine-4,8,12-trione (coded as R1), was synthesized via the industrially viable, Suzuki cross-coupling reaction using commercially and cheaply available substrates. Using PTB7 as a donor, a power conversion efficiency of 9.33% was achieved in simple, solution-processable bulk-heterojunction devices, a result that is amongst the best in the literature for three-dimensional non-fullerene acceptors.
1. Introduction
Global population growth and economic development are generating ever-increasing demands on energy requirements, making the development of renewable energy technologies a pressing need. Natural resources such as sunlight, water and wind can supply renewable energy, with many approaches being developed to harvest solar energy at an affordable price. Organic and dye-sensitized solar cells are closer to becoming viable on the large scale due to extensive research efforts.1,2 Organic or bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices in particular are a promising technology for lightweight, flexible, low-cost, remotely installed photovoltaic modules.3 The active layer of such devices consists of donor and acceptor materials, in which fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), PC71BM and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) have dominated for more than two decades.4 In terms of donor materials, conventional polymers such as poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) have been studied in detail and have inspired the development of next-generation conjugated polymeric semiconductors such as PTB7 and PTB7-Th. Though power conversion efficiency (PCE) numbers of >10% can be achieved using the fullerene-based acceptors,5 it seems that such acceptors have reached their limit and cannot reach higher performance using simple, scalable device fabrication strategies. This is due to several shortcomings such as limited absorption in the visible region, difficulty in synthesis and purification, morphological instability, and restricted chemical and energy level tuning via structural modification.6 Furthermore, their high electron affinity can lead to a low open-circuit voltage.7 Since these deficiencies restrain the performance of fullerene acceptors, researchers have been seeking alternative structural formats which can be easily generated, and can compete with fullerene acceptors by retaining appealing properties, such as strong accepting strength, solubility, and both chemical and thermal stabilities. These alternative molecules, otherwise termed non-fullerene acceptors, should meet other specifications such as adequate absorption from high to low energy regions, structural diversity and electronic tunability. Therefore, the design and development of a potential non-fullerene acceptor based on such necessities is a worthwhile challenge for both organic chemists and device physicists.
As such, there has been a dramatic surge in the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) indicating that a variety of structural types can be used as NFA targets.8 The types such as acceptor–donor–acceptor, acceptor–acceptor–acceptor and three-dimensional with twisted configuration are the most successful and exploited structural types, with some examples possessing superior properties when compared to their fullerene-based counterparts.9 The NFAs should be based on simple and scalable synthetic protocols, address the limitations of fullerene-based acceptors, and also have energy levels matching those of the conventional and conjugated polymeric and small molecular donor functionalities. However, many NFA targets based on these formats are small molecules that may exhibit higher crystallinity and large coplanar structures, resulting in excessive aggregation that leads to unfavourable blend surface morphologies. This issue can be solved with the development of non-planar or three-dimensional structural types, where strong intermolecular aggregation is minimised, whilst sustaining elongated and effective conjugation in each direction for photon harvesting. Furthermore, these formats can facilitate isotropic electron transport.10 Therefore, it is reasoned that three-dimensional (3D) formats are a preferable choice to design efficient NFAs that favour superior blend morphology, resulting in high-performance devices.
One of the most effective strategies for designing non-planar, 3D acceptors is to construct a distorted structure with a central core, containing several electron-withdrawing end groups radiating from it. This central core can be conjugated or unconjugated depending upon the type of end group that is connected. The core determines the 3D conformation, contributes to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, and provides a rigid backbone for extended conjugation. A number of recent papers report key examples of NFAs based on 3D formats where a variety of cores have been used.11 Among such cores, tetraphenylmethane, tetraphenylsilane, 9,9′-bifluorenylidene, 9,9′-spirobi[fluorene], 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene], truxene, spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] and tetraphenylethylene are the cores which have been exploited the most, but there is still a large scope for those structural units which can be centrally employed to generate non-planar, 3D targets.8a,10
To expand the structural diversity of NFAs, and to overcome the synthetic complexity of many materials reported previously, we have focussed our attention on a promising alternative building block; the carbonyl-bridged triarylamine (otherwise termed heterotriangulenes),12 with three electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. The carbonyl-bridged triarylamine (CBT) moiety acts as a moderate electron acceptor with appealing optoelectronic properties for organic electronic applications.13 This unit has been reported as a building block for organic semiconductors with applications such as organic light emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors,14 and dye-sensitized solar cells,15 and as electroluminescent materials.16 Surprisingly, among the reported literature, no derivatives have been described that can be used as NFAs. Additional motivations for our interest in the design of a novel, 3D target based on CBT core were (1) the recent success that we were able to achieve using diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a terminal accepting group,17 and (2) an understanding of the NFA research area that allows the control and prediction of the properties of a thoughtfully designed chromophore.18 Taking into account the advantages exhibited by DPP unit, including strong accepting strength, low-cost synthesis and capability to be placed at terminal positions in a molecular structure, together with the literature precedence, herein we report the first combination of CBT and DPP functionalities to generate a non-planar, 3D small molecule NFA, 2,6,10-tris(5-(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-dioxo-4-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-1-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H-benzo[9,1]quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7-defg]acridine-4,8,12-trione [coded as R1], shown in Scheme 1.

2. Results and discussion
Compound R1 was synthesized in a straightforward manner with moderate yield via the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 2,6,10-triiodo-4H-benzo[9,1]quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7-defg]acridine-4,8,12-trione (1) and the commercially available 2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3-(5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (2); see Scheme 1. The reaction was conducted in dimethoxyethane at 100 °C for 16 h using potassium carbonate (K2CO3; 10% aqueous solution) as a base and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) [Pd(PPh3)4] as the catalyst. R1 was purified through simple column chromatography and its structure was confirmed via proton spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) measurement, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (for experimental spectra, see ESI†). R1 was found to be reasonably soluble in a variety of commonly used solvents, such as chloroform and dichlorobenzene, thus, fulfilling one of the major requirements of solution-processable organic electronics.
The optical and electrochemical properties of R1 were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy in air. In solution, R1 exhibited a strong absorption maximum (λmax) at 590 nm (molar extinction coefficient ∼80000 L M−1 cm−1 at 5.50 μM). The absorption spectrum in solution displays a similar but slightly blue-shifted and narrower profile compared with that obtained in the film (pristine film λmax = 598 nm) (Fig. 1). The comparable absorption profiles in solution and film suggest that the non-planar, 3D structure of R1 inhibits cofacial stacking of DPP units, enabling better charge separation and isotropic electron transport compared with fullerene derivatives.19 The blend absorption profile of R1 with two different donor polymers, P3HT and PTB7, resulted in desirable broad absorption spectra, with the latter covering most of the visible spectrum (380–800 nm) when compared with the former (Fig. 1). The weak absorption of R1 in the range of 650 nm to 800 nm compliments the absorption of PTB7, and is attributed to ICT between the central CBT core and terminal DPP units. This charge transfer is believed to favour high electron mobility. Furthermore, the blend films of R1 displayed an ability to quench the fluorescence of neat films of R1 (Fig. S1, ESI†), a result that provides valuable insight about the ability of donor–acceptor interface to dissociate excitons. This further confirms the potential of a material as an acceptor for organic photovoltaic devices.20

To obtain information about the theoretical density distribution of R1, time dependant-density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations using the Gaussian 16 suite of programs and the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G level of theory were carried out.21 The calculations indicated that the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbital densities is 2.15 eV. This value shows well segregated bands and guarantees an efficient charge transfer transition. The initial geometry optimization at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory indicated a resemblance to the planar aromatic system which extended all the way to outer thiophene moieties. The HOMO density was symmetrically concentrated on the three peripheral thiophene moieties whereas the LUMO density was calculated to be a degenerate set of two orbitals concentrated on the CBT core of R1 (see Fig. 2). The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) map of R1 as calculated using DFT at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G level of theory indicates a positive charge density on the central core, forming the acceptor part of the molecule, and a negative charge density on the peripheral thiophene moieties, forming the donor part of the molecule (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, the computed absorption spectrum shows a major transition peak at 662 nm, which is mainly described as the HOMO → LUMO transition (see Fig. S2, ESI†).

The experimental estimation of the HOMO energy level was carried out using photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA), and the LUMO level was calculated by adding the optical band gap (film spectrum) to the HOMO value (for PESA spectrum, see Fig. S3, ESI†). The HOMO (−5.56 eV) and the LUMO (−3.74 eV) values are shown in the energy level diagram (see Fig. 3), which indicates that the energy levels of R1 complements those of the commonly used donor polymers, P3HT and PTB7. The alignment of energy levels (Fig. 3) indicates that device incorporating such a combination of donor and acceptor semiconductors indeed guarantees a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), which is clearly advantageous when compared with the device incorporating the conventional fullerene acceptor. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in dichloromethane, though R1 was soluble in a variety of commonly used solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dichlorobenzene. The measurement of the HOMO energy levels using CV followed a similar trend as was established using PESA experiment (CV HOMO = 5.62 eV; PESA HOMO: = 5.56 eV). The cyclo-voltammogram indicated the presence of oxidation and reduction potentials, a result validating the existence of donor (peripheral thiophenes) and acceptor (CBT core) parts (Fig. S4, ESI,† for cyclic voltammograms) and of sufficient ICT. It is important to mention that although we observed the pristine and P3HT blend film spectra of R1 somewhat similar, we still included P3HT for a fair comparison to see the performance of R1 with the most-studied, benchmark donor polymer. We further realised that not only should organic semiconductors be soluble and chemically stable, they should also be thermally stable to allow device processing at higher temperatures. The thermal stability of R1 was observed using thermogravimetric analysis. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that R1 is a thermally stable chromophore and the organic solar cell device incorporating R1 can be annealed, if required. For TGA spectrum, see Fig. S5, ESI.†

Once it was established that R1 displayed appropriate optical and electrochemical properties, we evaluated its performance as a NFA using two different, commercially available donor polymers, P3HT and PTB7, in solution-processable BHJ devices under simulated sunlight and monochromatic light illumination. The decision to test R1 with the former and the historical benchmark polymer was primarily taken to understand its exciton dissociation efficacy. Having said that, we expected the outcome of P3HT-based devices to be inferior when compared with PTB7-based devices, given the latter's complementary absorption with R1. We chose a simple device architecture, indium-tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, 38 nm)/active layer (∼75 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm), where the active layer was a 1:1.2 blend of P3HT/PTB7: R1, respectively, spin-cast from o-dichlorobenzene atop the PEDOT:PSS surface. In context to the fabrication of fullerene-free organic solar cells, it is becoming evident that the use of a high boiling point solvent, such as o-dichlorobenzene, may affect device performance as it generally produces smoother blend films when compared with the films fabricated using low boiling point solvents such as chloroform. Taking advantage of this and our own understanding of the fabrication of fullerene-free materials, we annealed the active surfaces at 110 °C for five minutes. We also fabricated control devices based on the P3HT: PC61BM combination.
With the PTB7: R1 combination, the device parameters obtained were encouraging, i.e. Voc, short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE reached 1.02 V, 15.20 mA cm−2, 0.61 and 9.33%, respectively. With the P3HT: R1 combination, the device parameters, Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, were 0.91 V, 10.20 mA cm−2, 0.60, and 5.62%, respectively. The observance of high open-circuit voltages is consistent with the measured LUMO level of R1 and the HOMO levels of the donor polymers. The unannealed devices with a similar donor: acceptor weight ratio provided a satisfactory outcome as well, and the observed PCE values were 7.89% and 5.32% with PTB7 and P3HT, respectively. In contrast, the maximum PCE reached 3.05% for a control device based on P3HT: PC61BM, a result that corroborates most of the literature reports. For the current–voltage (J–V) curves and the detailed device parameters, see Fig. 4 and Table S1, ESI,† respectively.
 Fig. 4  Characteristic J–V curves for the best BHJ devices based on R1 in blends with PTB7 and P3HT. Solid and square dotted lines correspond to pre-annealing and post-annealing (A) conditions, respectively, under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G); blend ratio = 1:1.2 w/w (D/A). The device structure was: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (38 nm)/active layer (∼75 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). 
The PTB7-based devices performed better than the devices based on P3HT under similar conditions. This improvement is mainly due to an increase in the Jsc, a finding that is consistent with the broader blend film spectrum of PTB7 and R1. A similar pattern was observed for the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement, where a much broader and stronger response was observed for PTB7-based devices when compared with the devices based on P3HT, see Fig. 5 for IPCE spectra. The IPCE maxima of 68% (at 591 nm) and 52% (at 580 nm) were achieved for PTB7- and P3HT-based devices, respectively. Though the broadness of these spectra indicated that both donor and acceptor components in active blends made a considerable contribution to the IPCE and Jsc, the PTB7-based spectrum spanned the whole visible region, ranging from 350 nm to 820 nm, suggesting better light-harvesting and a superior blending of donor and acceptor domains.
 Fig. 5  The IPCE curves of the best performing devices described in Fig. 4. Solid lines correspond to the IPCE spectra whereas dotted lines represent blend film absorption profiles. 
Furthermore, the photocurrents obtained from the IPCE data were in close agreement with those of the current–voltage measurements conducted under the one Sun conditions. The high-quality intermixing of donor and acceptor domains in case of PTB7 blend was confirmed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis, which was conducted in tapping mode, where a much smoother surface was observed when compared with the P3HT blend. The actual surface morphologies of the blend films of P3HT: R1 and PTB7: R1 (1:1.2 w/w) are shown in Fig. 6. The unannealed blend surfaces showed surface roughness of 2.88 nm (PTB7: R1) and 2.20 nm (P3HT: R1), suggesting that R1 is a type of NFA that is evidently miscible with two different types of donor polymers, i.e. narrow and broad bandgap polymers. The annealed surfaces showed roughness of 3.16 nm (PTB7: R1) and 4.90 nm (P3HT: R1), a result that verifies the broad blend absorption due to effective intermixing of donor and acceptor domains. The surface roughness of P3HT blend grew larger upon annealing, a result that may be held responsible for the marginal improvement of device efficiency (5.62% vs. 5.32%). Though it was evident through AFM analysis that the annealed blend morphology was superior to the as-cast blend, it was thought that annealing might have affected the morphology leading to a granular surface. The current literature implies that morphologies such as granular, bush and worm are generally preferred to morphologies such as amorphous, flat and regular, as the former morphologies tend to lead to better performing devices. Therefore, we conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to probe surface crystallinity. It was found that both the blends were amorphous (see Fig. S6, ESI†), ruling out surface crystallinity and granular morphology upon annealing. Given the amorphous nature of the blends of R1, it can be argued that the target material's greater miscibility with the donor counterparts, and its strong light-harvesting ability together with complementary absorption with PTB7, play a key role for the observed performance. This further validates the premise of investigating NFAs based on 3D formats and underlines the utility of the functionalities used in designing R1.

The root-mean square (RMS) roughness of 3.16 nm and 4.90 nm were observed for the annealed blend surfaces of PTB7 and P3HT, respectively. 
3. Conclusions
In summary, a novel, carbonyl-bridged triarylamine-functionalized, 3D target material (coded as R1) was designed and synthesized, and its potential as a non-fullerene electron acceptor was demonstrated. The new material R1 is structurally simple, adequately soluble, thermally stable, and highly absorbing in the visible region. These merits give R1 the fundamental advantage over fullerene acceptors, such as PC61BM, for which electronic and structural tuning, and limited absorption are restrictive factors. R1 was designed to be non-planar, possessed energy levels complementing those of the routinely used and the commercially available donor polymers, P3HT and PTB7, and produced well-intermixed blend surfaces with these donors. The device parameters outlined herein are among the best numbers that have been achieved using the combination of a 3D NFA and the commercial donors. The results of this research evidently suggest that R1 is an appropriately designed and highly promising acceptor that can be tested with a variety of donors, including polymers and small molecules, for future applications in BHJ devices.
4. Experimental details
4.1 Materials and methods
All the reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere, unless otherwise stated. Solvents used for various reactions were dried using a commercial solvent purification/drying system. Solvents used for extractions and column chromatography, and all other reagents were used as supplied by commercial vendors without further purifications or drying.
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using 0.25 mm thick plates pre-coated with Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 silica gel, and visualized using UV light (254 and 365 nm). Petroleum spirits with a boiling point range of 40–60 °C were used wherever indicated. Column chromatography was performed on either 40–60 or 20–40 μm silica gel. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 or 500 MHz, as indicated. The following abbreviations were used to explain multiplicities: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, and dd = doublet of doublets. The chemical shifts were calibrated using residual non-deuterated solvent as an internal reference and are reported in parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane (δ = 0). MALDI-TOF experiments were carried out using Autoflex III smart beam vertical mass spectrometer and for high resolution mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization (ESI) technique was used. PESA measurements were recorded using a Riken Keiki AC-2 PESA spectrometer with a power number of 0.5. Samples for PESA were prepared on ITO cleaned glass substrates and were run using a power setting of 10 nW. TGA experiments were carried out using a Q-500 TGA instrument with nitrogen as a purging gas. The samples were heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C per minute under a nitrogen atmosphere. Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a PowerLab ML160 potentiostat interfaced via a PowerLab 4/20 controller to a PC running E-Chem For Windows version 1.5.2. The measurements were run in argon-purged dichloromethane with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. The cyclic voltammograms were recorded using a standard three electrode configuration with a glassy carbon (2 mm diameter) working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a silver wire pseudo reference electrode. The silver wire was cleaned in concentrated nitric acid followed by concentrated hydrochloric acid and then washed with deionised water. Cyclic-voltammograms were recorded with a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1. All the potentials were referred to the E-half of ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple. Details of spectroscopic measurements, device fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices were reported previously.17a Atomic force microscopy topographic maps were directly performed on the active layers of PTB7: R1 and P3HT: R1 blends using an Asylum Research MFP-3D-SA instrument. The AFM was run in intermittent contact mode (tapping mode) using MicroMasch NSC18 tips (typical resonant frequency B100 kHz, typical probe radius B10 nm and typical aspect ratio 3:1). A Bruker AXS D8 Discover instrument with a general area detector diffraction system (GADDS) using a CuKα source was utilized to obtain XRD patterns. Synthesis of 2,6,10-triiodo-4H-benzo[9,1]quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7-defg]acridine-4,8,12-trione was adapted from the published literature.16

Synthesis of 2,6,10-tris(5-(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-dioxo-4-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-1-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H-benzo[9,1]quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7-defg]acridine-4,8,12-trione (R1). 
In a 100 mL round bottom flask, K2CO3 (83 mg, 0.60 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (14 mg, 0.012 mmol) were added to a solution of 2,6,10-triiodo-4H-benzo[9,1]quinolizino[3,4,5,6,7-defg]acridine-4,8,12-trione (1) (85 mg, 0.12 mmol) and 2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3-(5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (2) (395 mg, 0.60 mmol) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (20 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 16 h. The progress of reaction was monitored through TLC.
