    , Accepted 14th March 2013First published on 15th March 2013AbstractA cost-effective and reliable Ni–Au contact on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys for a solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) is reported. The use of MPS SAMs creates a strong covalent binding and more nucleation sites with even distribution for electroplating contact electrodes on nanostructured thermoelectric materials. A reliable high-performance flat-panel STEG can be obtained by using this new method.
Thermoelectric devices use thermoelectric materials to convert heat into electricity and vice versa. A thermoelectric cooler creates a temperature difference when a voltage is applied to it. Conversely, a thermoelectric generator creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Hence, thermoelectric devices can be used in solid-state cooling and power generation, such as solar power conversion, waste-heat recovery, CPU and high-power laser cooling. The performance of thermoelectric materials depends on the dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT (S2σT/κ), where S, σ, κ, and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature, respectively. The dimensionless ZT value in Bi2Te3-based bulk alloys, which are the most widely used thermoelectric materials near room temperature, has remained at around 1 for more than 50 years. Over the last few years, significant improvements in the thermoelectric ZT value in nanostructured thermoelectric alloys, particularly in nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys with a peak ZT value of 1.4, have been made.1 These nanocrystalline bulk materials were made by hot pressing nanopowders that were ball-milled from crystalline ingots under inert conditions. The improvement in ZT is the result of low thermal conductivity caused by the increased phonon scattering by grain boundaries and defects.1–3
The thermoelectric device performance depends not only on the ZT value of the material, but also on the electrical and thermal contact performances between the metallic electrodes and the thermoelectric materials.4 In the thermoelectric cooler using Bi2Te3-based alloys, a barrier layer of nickel (500 nm–1 μm) is coated on the Bi2Te3 surface to block inter-diffusion, followed by a protective layer of gold on nickel for soldering tin. In the cooling device, traditional methods of fabricating contact electrodes on Bi2Te3 thermoelectric materials are sputtering, electroless plating or their combination. In the case of sputtering, compared with sputtering nickel on the metal substrate, the relatively poor wettability of the Bi2Te3-based alloys causes the nickel atoms to be more preferably bound to each other than to Bi2Te3 and grow into three-dimensional islands so that it needs an additional thin layer, such as sputtered chromium between nickel and Bi2Te3, to improve adhesion.5,6 A good contact performance on Bi2Te3-based alloys can be achieved by sputtering chromium of a few tens of nm and nickel of several hundred nm, which requires costly vacuum equipment and has low throughput. Electroless plated nickel on Bi2Te3-based alloys achieved by using an initial coating of a palladium–tin catalyst can provide acceptable contact performance.7 Compared with the sputtered contact, the electroless plated contact has slightly high contact resistance because of the accumulation of unwanted impurities (such as a palladium–tin catalyst layer, reducing agents, and chelating agents) and structural imperfections at the interface.8
Besides a thermoelectric cooler, a thermoelectric generator (TEG) uses thermoelectric materials to convert waste heat or solar heat into electricity. Alongside a photovoltaic cell generating electricity by exciting electron–hole pairs, a TEG is another way of converting solar energy into electricity, named as a solar thermoelectric generator (STEG). Our previous work reported a 4.6% record efficiency for a flat-panel STEG using nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys and a selective solar absorber (thermal concentration), which demonstrates that the solar thermoelectric generator is a promising approach to achieve cost-effective conversion of solar energy into electricity.4 The operating temperature of 200–250 °C in a TEG is higher than the operating temperature of 100–150 °C in a thermoelectric cooler. Therefore, the nickel barrier layer with 500 nm to 1 μm for the thermoelectric cooler cannot effectively block inter-diffusion in the TEG case. Recent studies indicated that the thickness of the Ni barrier layer for TEG needs to be at least several μm.9,10 However, sputtering is a very time-consuming process for achieving a thick nickel layer and the increased film stress with increasing Ni thickness (>1 μm) causes the film to peel off. Similarly, electroless plating also cannot coat a several-μm nickel layer having strong adhesion on Bi2Te3-based alloys. To date, thermal spraying has been the most common method to fabricate thick Ni contact electrodes on bulk Bi2Te3-based alloys for TEG. In the thermal spraying process, Ni is melted and sprayed over the cold sample surface via a jet stream. The bulk Bi2Te3-based alloys can bear the thermal shock during thermal spraying while the nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys will have cracks propagating randomly along the grain boundaries because of low thermal conductivity and disordered grain textures. Hence, the contact fabrication on the nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys limits the impact of these advances in material properties. Most fundamental research has been conducted on nanostructured thermoelectric materials, but very little has been focused on the contact interfacial region. This paper therefore aims to fabricate reliable contact electrodes at low temperature, low cost and high throughput on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric materials for STEG. The findings are expected to stimulate research interest for industrial applications of thermoelectric devices using nanostructured thermoelectric materials for energy generation and energy savings.
As mentioned, thermal spraying causes sample cracking. Sputtering was chosen as the initial method of fabricating contact electrodes on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys for STEG.4 The open circles in Fig. 1(a)–(c) show the efficiency, open circuit voltage (Voc) and power output of the flat-panel STEG, which comprises a p-type and an n-type leg of a nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloy with sputtered electrodes (50 nm Cr/500 nm Ni/500 nm Au) sandwiched between a solar absorber plate (hot side 220 °C) and a copper plate (cold side 20 °C), which decrease over time during consecutive illumination. The total device resistance at the operating temperature (ΔT = 200 °C) would increase by 1.5 times compared with the initial device resistance at room temperature due to the increased resistance of the Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric alloy itself. Therefore, the ratio of the total resistance at the operating temperature to the initial resistance at room temperature should remain at around 1.5. However, this ratio increases over time from 1.5 to 1.63, as shown using open circles in Fig. 1(d). All material properties of nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys are the same before and after the operation. It indicates that the main problem arises from the increase in the interfacial contact resistances between metallic electrodes and thermoelectric materials. Based on the data given in Fig. 1(d), we can estimate the specific contact resistance that increases initially from 1 × 10−6 Ω cm2 to 1.4 × 10−5 Ω cm2 after illumination for 2500 minutes, as shown using open circles in Fig. 2 (see ESI†). It was reported that a reasonably low ohmic contact at each end of the Bi2Te3-based alloys should be within 5% of the resistance of the thermoelectric leg, representing the specific contact resistance of about 9 × 10−6 Ω cm2 in our STEG system (see ESI†).4,11,12

Electrochemical deposition is a low temperature, low cost and high throughput process, and has been widely used instead of sputtering in a wide variety of applications. In the case of electroplating of Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric semiconductors, the lower surface energy leads to higher nucleation energy and thus the scattered growth of nuclei on a small number of nucleation sites causes weak interface contact and poor adhesion.14,15 Nanostructured surfaces having broad distribution of surface energy would cause electroplating nucleation to be more uneven.16,17 One approach to improve electroplating nucleation is to yield a wettable surface beneficial to subsequent metallization, and the other is to use a bridging ligand, such as sulfide, to link metal ions as a promotion agent during electroplating.18,19 The former method usually involves different steps of chemical treatments, which is likely to damage the nanostructured surface.13 Therefore, a promotion layer on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys that can provide more nucleation sites for electroplating metal would be ideal in order to achieve a good contact. Functionalized self-assembled silane monolayers (SAMs) have been used for many years in corrosion prevention for a wide range of substrates and adhesion promoters for joining two substrates (metal sheets, polymer films) by chemical or electrostatic binding.20,21 Recently, it was discovered that some SAMs in the range of 1 to 3 nm are able to transport electrons by a hopping process.22 To integrate the concepts mentioned above, a new method can be used to promote nucleation and adhesion for the electroplating process by using the hydrolysable methoxy end-group and sulfur functional group on 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS), as shown in Fig. 3. The MPS with the methoxy group would adhere to the surface of the nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloy and its sulfur functional group can form a bridging link to nickel ions in the electrolyte. When electroplating, electrons hop onto the sample surface to reduce nickel ions to atoms, forming strong covalent bonds at the interface. Another advantage of using MPS is that it forms a stable neutral solution in ethanol, thus avoiding oxidation and corrosion on nanostructured surfaces.
 Fig. 3  The sequence of steps for electroplating of a nickel layer on a nanostructured Bi2Te3-based substrate pretreated with functionalized self-assembled MPS. (a) After surface cleaning, the nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloy was immersed into 1% MPS in ethanol for 50 min to form a MPS monolayer; (b) immersion into the electrolyte for 30 s to form a bridging link with nickel ions before electroplating; and (c) electroplated nickel onto the pretreated surface. 

Fig. 4(a) shows a cathodic wave from cyclic voltammetry for nickel on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys with and without MPS treatment. A Gamry PCI4/300 potentiostat/galvanostat was used in the electrochemical measurement in a standard three-electrode system with a platinum mesh as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Compared with the onset voltage of 0.6 V for the bare surface, the sample surface pretreated with 1% MPS shows a small peak ranging from −0.15 to −0.5 V in the current–potential curve, indicating another redox reaction occurring at a more positive potential. It is believed that this additional peak results from the reduced formation energy by an MPS bridging link to nickel ions in the electrolyte so that a seed layer of nickel is deposited prior to bulk electroplating. The peak in the range of −0.15 to −0.5 V is unpronounced for the sample pretreated with 5% MPS, meaning that an excess of MPS would retard charge transfer at the interface.

The chronoamperograms in Fig. 4(b) show the current response at an operating voltage of 0.85 V for electroplating nickel on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys without and with 1% MPS treatment. The electroplating rate in the initial few seconds increases by 1.5 times after MPS treatment, which indicates that more nucleation sites are being generated at the initial stage. Fig. 5 shows that an MPS pretreated surface increases the contact angle between the water drop and the sample surface from 38° to 86°, implying that the increase in the initial electroplating rate is promoted by the bridging link effect, not by the surface wettability.

Fig. 6(a) shows an AFM image of the bare surface of nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys and Fig. 6(b) and (c) show AFM images of electroplated nickel in the initial 10 seconds at an operating voltage of 0.85 V on a bare nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloy, aiming to compare the nucleation formation with and without MPS treatment at the very initial stage. A Nanoscope IIIa atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to scan the surface and calculate the root mean square (RMS) roughness. The rather high nucleation energy for electroplating causes uneven island growth on a small number of nucleation sites, leading to irregularities in the grain size. Stacking faults and mismatch in the lattice spacing would also generate the large strains and stresses in the electroplated film. Hence, the island growth mode is usually not desirable for technological applications due to its poor adhesion and non-uniform deposition. In contrast, Fig. 6(b) shows that more nucleation sites were evenly generated on the MPS pretreated surface. In addition, the pull-off adhesion test performed using 3M Flatback Masking Tape 250 (ASTM D3359) shows that no coating was stripped off for a 5 μm layer of electroplated nickel on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys with the MPS treatment, but almost all of the coating on the bare nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloy came off.

AFM scan size is 5 μm, scan rate is 1 Hz. The Z axis for the height is 3 μm per division and the X axis is 1 μm per division. 
Fabricating reliable ohmic contacts by this new method is of prime importance. Table 1 lists the electrical contact resistance measured by a 4-wire AC method for small cubes cut from a disk of n-type or p-type nanostructured Bi2Te3, both sides of which were treated with MPS followed by electroplating a 5 μm layer of nickel and a 3 μm layer of gold.7,23 As observed, the specific contact resistance at each end of thermoelectric legs is approximately 1 × 10−6 Ω cm2 and contributes around 1% of the total resistance, showing the low ohmic contacts between the electroplated electrodes and nanostructured Bi2Te3 legs before the STEG operation. The performances of a STEG comprising a p-type and an n-type leg of nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys with electroplated electrodes of 5 μm nickel and 3 μm gold are shown by the open triangles in Fig. 1(a)–(d). As seen, a good improvement of the device reliability of the flat-panel STEG in terms of the efficiency, open circuit voltage (Voc) and power output can be achieved due to a reliable contact resistance between nanostructured Bi2Te3 alloys and metallic electrodes. As shown by the open triangles in Fig. 1(d), the ratio of the total resistance at the operating temperature to the initial resistance at room temperature increases slightly over time from 1.5 to 1.52. This ratio does not improve much even when the nickel barrier is thickened. A possible reason is the formation of nickel telluride at the interface, which strengthens the mechanical joint but degrades the electrical contact.7,8,10 Further studies on the interfacial reactions for nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys and their improvement are underway. The increase in specific contact resistance for this electroplated electrode can be modeled as shown using the open triangles in Fig. 2, showing a stable value of around 2.5% of the resistance of the thermoelectric leg after consecutive illumination for 2500 min (see ESI†).

In summary, we have presented a new technique for deposition of an adhesive, uniform and thick metallic layer onto a nanostructured Bi2Te3-based material pretreated with functionalized self-assembled MPS. The use of an MPS thin layer not only provides a strong covalent binding but also creates more nucleation sites with even distribution for nickel electroplating. The deposition of MPS SAMs followed by the electroplating process on the nanostructured thermoelectric materials can be achieved by low temperature and solution-based processing, which is significantly more cost-effective. Measurements of contact resistance and device characteristics demonstrate that a reliable high-performance flat-panel STEG can be achieved by using this new electroplated contact on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys.
Experimental
Fabrication of nanostructured thermoelectric materials
Nanopowders are made by ball milling bulk Bi2Te3-based alloy ingots (p-type alloyed with Sb as BixSb2−xTe3 and n-type alloyed with Se as Bi2SeyTe3−y). The disk samples of 25 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness are made by hot pressing the nanopowders loaded in graphite dies. After hot pressing, both sides of the disk sample are polished using sand paper. To achieve a good ZT value, the size and quality of the initial nanoparticles must be controlled. For good electrical conductivity, it is especially important to prevent oxidation.1
Contact fabrication
The disk samples of the n-type and p-type nanostructured Bi2Te3 alloys were cleaned by immersion into 0.5% bromine–ethanol at room temperature for 1 min and then 5% CLEAN-100 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd) at 45 °C for 5 min with sonication.16 For sputtered contacts, the samples were deposited by 500 nm nickel followed by 500 nm gold without vacuum break. For electroplated contacts, the samples were immersed into a solution of 1% MPS (3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane) for 50 min. A 5 μm layer of nickel was electroplated onto the pretreated surface at an operating voltage of 0.85 V from a commercial electrolyte (Caswell Inc.) for 50 min at 53 °C. Before triggering electroplating, the MPS pretreated surface should be immersed into the electrolyte for 30 s to form a bridging link to nickel ions. The process flow diagram is shown in Fig. 3. A 3 μm layer of gold was then electroplated on nickel at an operating voltage of 1.0 V from a commercial electrolyte (Samtec Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature.
Measurement of contact resistance
The electrical contact resistance was measured by a 4-wire AC method (Keithley 2300) for small cubes (around 1 mm × 1 mm × 1.5 mm) cut from a disk of n-type or p-type nanostructured Bi2Te3, both sides of which were treated with MPS followed by electroplating of a 5 μm layer of nickel and a 3 μm layer of gold. A small current (Joule heating can be neglected) with alternating polarity at a high frequency of 1000 kHz (the Peltier heat cancels due to periodic heating and cooling at the junction) from 0.03 mA to 0.1 mA was input into the sample from top to bottom. The total resistance can be obtained using the slope of the voltage drop and the current. The intrinsic resistance of nanostructured Bi2Te3 alloys can also be obtained by measuring the voltage drop across the sample body itself using a known distance. Therefore, the electrical contact resistance at both sides is the difference between the total resistance and intrinsic resistance.23

 	Fig. 3  The sequence of steps for electroplating of a nickel layer on a nanostructured Bi2Te3-based substrate pretreated with functionalized self-assembled MPS. (a) After surface cleaning, the nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloy was immersed into 1% MPS in ethanol for 50 min to form a MPS monolayer; (b) immersion into the electrolyte for 30 s to form a bridging link with nickel ions before electroplating; and (c) electroplated nickel onto the pretreated surface.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Cathodic wave from cyclic voltammetry for nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys in a nickel electrolyte without and with 1% and 5% MPS treatment; and (b) chronoamperometry of nickel during electrodeposition on nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys under an operating voltage of 0.85 V without and with 1% MPS treatment.	 

 	Fig. 5  Contact angles of nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys on (a) bare surface and (b) the surface pretreated with 1% MPS for 50 min.	 

 	Fig. 6  Atomic force microscopy images of (a) the bare surface of nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys, and electroplating nickel at an operating voltage of 0.85 V at the initial 10 seconds on the surface of nanostructured Bi2Te3-based alloys (b) without MPS treatment and (c) with MPS treatment. AFM scan size is 5 μm, scan rate is 1 Hz. The Z axis for the height is 3 μm per division and the X axis is 1 μm per division.
