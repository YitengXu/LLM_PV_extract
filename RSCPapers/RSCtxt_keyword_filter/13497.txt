    , Accepted 17th November 2012First published on 21st November 2012AbstractTwo new organic dyes containing E- or Z-trifluoromethyl acrylic acid as the electron acceptors were synthesized and used as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Z-isomer achieved a power conversion efficiency (η) of 4.05%, which was much higher than that of the E-isomer (η = 1.35%). Such results give a new insight into in design of new dyes for DSSCs.
In the past three decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention since Grätzel and co-workers achieved a high light-to-electricity conversion efficiency with Ru-based photosensitizers.1,2 As results, a series of Ru complexes have been investigated, and efficiencies of up to 11% have been achieved.3 However, ruthenium is a noxious and non-abundant element. Consequently, numerous metal-free organic dyes have been developed in recent years, in which many dyes show a higher efficiency. In comparison with the dyes containing metals, metal-free organic dyes showed low costs, flexible structure modification and high molar extinction coefficients.3 Undoubtedly, the exploration and development of new organic dyes is very desirable.
Usually, organic dyes are composed of a conjugated donor–π-spacer–acceptor (D–π–A) structure. Great efforts have been made to improve the cell efficiency, however, most investigations are focused on changing the chemical structure of the electron donor4 and π-spacer parts5 in organic dyes. Typical donors include thiophene and triphenylamine units, while double and triple bonds are usually the π-spacers. It is noted that the acceptors in the dyes also greatly influence the performance of DSSCs, which plays an important role in the adsorption of the dyes onto the TiO2 semiconductor and the injection of the electrons of the dyes into the conductive band of TiO2. However, only limited knowledge about the electron acceptor parts is expounded, and the usual electron acceptors are localized on cyanoacrylic acid,6 rhodamine-3-acetic acid,7 or thiazolidinorhodamine-N-carboxylic acids.8 Although researchers in recent years have investigated dyes with new acceptor parts,9 the relationship between the chemical structures of the acceptors and the performance of the DSSCs still needs to be revealed.
On the other hand, the geometric configuration of the acceptor parts may influence the photo-to-current conversion.10 For example, a dye containing both E- and Z-configurations showed a much lower efficiency than a dye with pure E-configuration.10 Nevertheless, no report regarding the comparison between pure E- and Z-configurations has been found in the literature.
Theoretically, –CF3 is a group with a strong electron-accepting ability, and it can be introduced into the electron acceptor parts to obtain new dyes. However, due to the difficulty of the synthesis, there is only one dye containing trifluoromethylacrylic acid. In addition, investigations into the synthesis and properties of dyes containing E- or Z-configurations of trifluoromethylacrylic acid is still a challenge.
Recently, we have developed a new method for the preparation of trifluoromethylacrylic acid.11 By using the method and a standard Suzuki coupling, we successfully prepared the new dyes, D1(E) and D2(Z), whose chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1. Interestingly, the Z-isomer, D2(Z), achieved a power conversion efficiency of 4.05%, which was much higher than that of the E-isomer (η = 1.35%). This is the first report on the effect of the dyes containing pure Z- or E-configurations on the efficiency of DSSCs. Such results are significant for the molecular design of dyes for DSSCs. Herein, we describe the details.

The synthetic procedure of the dyes D1(E) and D2(Z) is depicted in Scheme 1, and the detailed route and the characterization of the intermediates and the final products are summarized in the ESI.†
 Scheme 1  Synthetic procedure for the new dyes. 
Regents and conditions: i) TiCl4, Et3N, r.t., 40 h; ii) Pd(PPh3)4, 2M K2CO3, in a mixture solvent of toluene and methanol (2:1, v/v), microwave irradiation; iii) purified by column chromatography on silica gel with a mixture of CHCl3 and MeOH (90:10, v/v) as the eluent.
The optical properties of D1(E) and D2(Z) were investigated by their UV-Vis and photoluminescent spectra. Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis spectra of D1(E) and D2(Z) in dichloromethane and on TiO2. In CH2Cl2 solution, two absorption bands are observed. The absorption band at 300–380 nm is ascribed to the localized aromatic π–π* transitions, and the strong absorption band at 380–575 nm is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer transitions. Although the two dyes give very similar absorption spectra, their molar extinction coefficients (ε) are different. For instance, the Z-isomer shows a ε of 1.91 × 104 M−1 cm−1, whereas the ε of the E-isomer is only 1.67 × 104 M−1 cm−1. When adsorbed on TiO2, D1(E), with an E-configuration, shows a blue shift of the maximum absorption peak, compared to its absorption spectra in CH2Cl2, while the maximum absorption peak of D2(Z), with a Z-configuration, has no obvious change. The photoluminescent spectra of D1(E) and D2(Z) in CH2Cl2 are given in the ESI, and the zeroth–zeroth transition energy (E0–0) was estimated from intersection between the corresponding absorption and emission spectra and are shown in Table 1.

The electrochemical behaviors of the dyes were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the results are given in the ESI.† Both D1(E) and D2(Z) show HOMO levels of 0.88 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), corresponding to their first oxidation potentials in CV. Such HOMO levels are more positive than the I−/I3− oxidation potential value (0.4 V versus NHE), suggesting that I− ions in the DSSC system can thermodynamically reduce the oxidized dyes produced when an electron injects into the conduction band of TiO2. Based on the HOMO levels and E0–0, the lower unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the dyes were estimated, and the results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, D1(E) and D2(Z) show the LUMO levels of −1.63 and −1.57 V, respectively, which were more negative than that of the conduction band value of TiO2 (−0.5 V versus NHE), implying that electron injection from the dyes in the excited state into the conduction band of TiO2 was permitted.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two dyes, the DSSC devices were fabricated, and the detailed procedure was described in the ESI.† Under the standard AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−1), the photovoltaic performance of the cells based on the two dyes was investigated, and the results are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 3. Interestingly, the D2(Z)-sensitized solar cell gave a 4.05% photon-to-current conversion efficiency (η), whereas the D1(E)-sensitized solar cell showed a very low conversion efficiency (η = 1.35%). In addition, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of D1(E) was much different from that of D2(Z), as can be seen from the inset of Fig. 3. The rather low IPCE (<40%) based on the E-isomer reflects a low photocurrent, causing an inferior photovoltaic performance.

The electrolyte was prepared in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v) containing 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN), 1.0 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP).

The big difference in photovoltaic behavior between D1(E) and D2(Z) is probably derived from the different binding modes of the dyes on the TiO2 surface, as depicted in Fig. 4. For the E-isomer, it was absorbed on the TiO2 surface as a tilted binding mode, whereas the Z-isomer was as a standing binding mode. As a result, the donating part of the E-isomer was closer to the TiO2 surface than that of the Z-isomer. A semiempirical calculation showed that the primary factor controlling the charge recombination dynamics in DSSCs was the spatial separation of a dye cation from the electrode surface.12 Therefore, the closer distance of the donating part with TiO2 may increase the charge recombination between the oxidated dye cation and injected electron on TiO2, resulting in the E-isomer showing a lower DSSC efficiency.

In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized two new dyes with E- or Z-trifluoromethyl acrylic acid as the electron acceptor parts. The DSSCs based on these dyes were fabricated and their performance showed that the DSSC efficiency of the E-isomer was less than that of the Z-isomer, possibly due to the E-isomer being absorbed on the TiO2 surface via a tilted binding mode while the Z-isomer was via a standing binding mode. The tilted binding mode may cause more charge recombination. These results may give an new insight into the design of new dyes.
