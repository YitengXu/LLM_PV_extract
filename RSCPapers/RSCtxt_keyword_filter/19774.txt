    , Accepted 13th May 2017First published on 15th May 2017AbstractFabricating a 1D electron transport layer (ETL) with bifunctionalities capable of effectively extracting electrons from a fully covering perovskite layer and synergistically blocking charge recombination between electrons in the cathode and holes in the perovskite is of great importance for high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a compact and even ZnO:I nanopillar planar ETL that enables the deposition of a fully covering and highly uniform perovskite layer by a facile one-step spin-coating method. We find that the crystal growth of 1D ZnO along the [0001] direction of a hexagonal single crystal is largely suppressed owing to iodine doping, which leads to a low-aspect-ratio and dense 1D nanopillar aligned architecture, and thus promotes one-step deposition of the perovskite layer. As characterized by optical spectroscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and electrochemical assays, the resultant ZnO:I nanopillar ETL film exhibits high optical transparency, a reduced work function and superior electron extraction ability. As a result, the optical–electrical conversion efficiency is promoted to as high as 18.24%, exceeding the previous highest efficiency recorded for 1D ETL based CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs. The enhanced performance is discussed in detail based on a well-matched work function between ZnO:I and the perovskite, fast electron extraction from the perovskite into the ZnO:I ETL, and improved electron transport rate and retarded charge recombination at the 1D ZnO:I ETL/perovskite interface. This work provides a novel and efficient 1D ETL via alien element doping and crystal oriented growth control for maximizing PSC performance.
Introduction
Due to their superior photo-electrical characteristics, such as a large absorption coefficient, ambipolar charge transport, long carrier diffusion length, and low exciton binding energy, organolead trihalide perovskites have attracted considerable attention in mesoporous scaffold-structured or planar heterojunction architectured perovskite solar cells (PSCs).1–5 In general, PSCs are assembled with a counter electrode/hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass, in which the ETL plays an important role in extracting electrons from the perovskite layer and blocking the recombination between electrons in the FTO and holes in the perovskite layer. Fast electron extraction and transport, excellent hole blocking ability and good optical transparency are prerequisites for an efficient ETL in high performance PSCs. So far, a majority of research activities in this aspect focus on the optimization of the composition of the dominating TiO2 nanoparticulate ETL and interface engineering of the ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL, consequently leading to cell PCEs exceeding 20%.6–8 However, the fatal shortcoming of the TiO2 ETL is that its electron mobility is lower than the hole mobility of frequently used HTLs such as spiro-OMeTAD, which causes residual electron accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface and consequently leads to serious J–V hysteresis of the PSCs.6,9 It is worth pointing out that the elimination or reduction of hysteresis dominantly relies on interface engineering of the devices by introducing an additional modifier on the TiO2 ETL layer.6,7 Additionally, a high-temperature annealing procedure is also required to induce TiO2 ETL crystallization to enhance the electron transport ability.
ZnO nanostructures are an alternative ETL to TiO2 because of their distinct advantage over commonly used TiO2 in the aspects of high electron mobility and simple low-temperature solution fabrication of various nanostructures, together with easy tailoring of their excellent electrical and optical characteristics by manipulating their morphology and composition.10–13 Particularly, owing to the superiority in electron transport and suppression of electron–hole recombination, one dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructures (i.e. nanorods and nanowires), which are able to offer a direct pathway, have been widely used as the ETL in dye-sensitized solar cells and PSCs.10–15 In general, such a kind of 1D ZnO ETL is designed with characteristics of a high aspect ratio (HAR) and large voids for sufficient sensitizer anchoring or perovskite loading. Moreover, as for the HAR 1D ZnO ETL, a two-step procedure involving sequential deposition is usually adopted to process a high pore-filling and fully covering perovskite film.14,16 As an example, Mahmood et al. reported a highest efficiency of 16.1% based on the above-mentioned two-step sequential deposition processing of perovskite onto an N-doped and PEI-modified HAR ZnO 1D ETL.14 Although a very impressive cell efficiency has been achieved, the tedious work of fabricating a functionalized 1D ETL and subsequently depositing a fully covering perovskite layer was involved. As a matter of fact, one-step spin coating, as the simplest and cheapest film production method, is widely used in solution-processed PSCs, in which solvent evaporation and perovskite crystallization can both be immediately realized in the process of spinning. However, there exists a bottleneck upon using such a simple spin-coating method, that is, the HAR ZnO NR film with large voids is tough to fully fill with perovskite, as a result of spiro-MeOTAD infiltration into the pores.17,18 In the end, the charge recombination probability at the spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite/1D ZnO interface would increase to a large extent.
Recently, our group has prepared a low-aspect-ratio (LAR) and dense iodine-doped ZnO nanorod (ZnO:I NR) film with enhanced sunlight absorption and electron transport performance using a facile hydrothermal method.19 Considering that 1D ZnO:I nanoarchitectures can be readily obtained from a hydrothermal process, and their morphologies including the shape, aspect ratio and density can be finely tuned by adjusting the hydrothermal parameters such as growth time, temperature, precursor concentration etc., we thus hypothesize that a compact and even LAR 1D ZnO:I planar film can also be obtained and then used as an efficient ETL for PSCs. Such a LAR 1D ZnO:I film should show several aspects of merits: (i) enabling one-step spin coating with a uniform perovskite layer to fully cover the 1D ETL, (ii) promoting the extraction of electrons from the perovskite layer by a more favorable work function of the ETL caused by iodine doping, and (iii) blocking the recombination between electrons in the FTO and holes in the perovskite layer by perfecting the spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite/1D ZnO interface. However, to date, such a compact LAR 1D ZnO:I planar film has not yet been reported for PSCs.
Herein, a compact and even LAR 1D ZnO:I film was subtly prepared and then employed as an ETL for the one-step spin-coating deposition of a uniform perovskite layer to achieve a high performance PSC. We demonstrated a facile low-temperature hydrothermal growth of a dense and even 1D ZnO:I planar film on ITO-coated substrates, in which iodic acid is added into the precursor containing zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine to vary the ETL composition and finely tune the 1D ZnO crystal growth direction and diameter. By means of using such 1D ZnO:I as the ETL, we achieved an impressively high efficiency 1D ETL-based PSC with a PCE of 18.24%, which surpasses the previous record value for 1D ETL-based PSCs.14 Various analyses confirmed that the superior cell performance originates from the favorable characteristics of the used 1D ZnO:I ETL including a well-matched work function, fast electron extraction, improved electron transport rate and inhibited charge recombination.
Results and discussion
A compact LAR 1D ZnO:I ETL was fabricated by means of a facile hydrothermal process using a growth precursor solution containing iodic acid, zinc nitrate hexahydrate, hexamethylenetetramine and ammonia (see Experimental section for details), and the schematic illustration is depicted in Fig. 1a. For preparing a dense and compact 1D ZnO:I film, a high concentration (0.75 M) zinc acetate dihydrate seed solution was adopted to obtain a dense ZnO seed layer, followed by hydrothermal treatment in an iodic acid-containing Zn precursor solution at 91.5 °C for 3 h. Note that ammonia was added to maintain the neutrality of the growth solution. For comparison, ZnO NRs were also fabricated under the same hydrothermal conditions except without adding iodic acid and ammonia in the growth precursor solution (Fig. 1b). The influence of adding iodic acid in the precursor solution on the crystallization and morphology of the 1D ZnO film was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. For the ZnO NRs, their average diameter is ∼70 nm, and there exist large voids within the nanorod architecture allowing for subsequent perovskite loading (Fig. 2a). The obtained ZnO NR film thickness is determined to be ∼700 nm upon hydrothermal processing for 3 h (Fig. 2b). After introducing iodic acid into the precursor, well-defined hexagonal ZnO:I nanopillars form, with increasing diameter ranging from 100 nm to 350 nm. Strikingly, a very compact and even planar ZnO:I film surface appears, accompanied by the drastic reduction of the void (Fig. 2c). From Fig. 2d, one can see that LAR nanopillars closely stack and vertically align on the ITO substrate plane to produce a 450 nm-thick planar ETL. XRD studies were performed in an attempt to investigate the crystal structure and chemical properties of the ZnO:I nanopillar layer. The XRD patterns demonstrate the hexagonal wurtzite structure of the ZnO:I nanopillars (Fig. 3a). It is noticeable that as compared to that of ZnO NRs, the (002) diffraction peak of the ZnO:I significantly decreases in intensity, while the other two peaks assigned to the (100) and (101) planes clearly increase in intensity. Such changes in the intensity of XRD patterns indicate that the crystal growth of the ZnO:I along the [0001] direction of a hexagonal single crystal is largely suppressed owing to iodine doping. As a consequence, the length to diameter ratio of the 1D ZnO:I structure decreases, and finally the ZnO:I nanopillar shape with a short length (e.g. ∼450 nm for ZnO:I vs. ∼700 nm for ZnO) forms, which is directly evidenced by the SEM observations above (Fig. 2c and d).

For parallel comparison of the optical transparency, surface chemical potential and morphology, and photoelectric properties of both ZnO NR and ZnO:I nanopillar ETLs in the following characterizations, the thickness of the two 1D ZnO ETL films is controlled to be identical to ∼450 nm by varying the hydrothermal growth period of ZnO NRs to 120 min (Fig. S1†). The 450 nm-thickness ZnO:I nanopillar layer deposited on ITO glass exhibits a transparency better than that of the corresponding ZnO NR layer on ITO glass in the wavelength range of 370–800 nm (Fig. 3b). The outstanding transparency of the ZnO:I nanopillar layer is supposed to improve the light harvesting due to more photon flux accessing the perovskite absorber to achieve a higher PCE. To intuitively compare the flatness of the ETL films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the ZnO:I nanopillar and ZnO NR film on ITO/glass substrates were recorded and the corresponding root mean square (RMS) roughness was also measured (Fig. 4a and b). The RMS roughness of the ZnO:I nanopillar film is determined to be 19.4 nm, which is much lower than that of the ZnO NR film (104.0 nm). A smoother surface of the ZnO:I nanopillar planar film may offer a better foundation for the perovskite to grow and to consequently form a tight interlayer contact with the underlying ETL.20 Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was also employed to determine the work function of both ZnO and ZnO:I with the surface potential mapping images (Fig. 4c and d and Au reference shown in Fig. S2†). It is shown that the work function of ZnO:I decreases from 4.79 eV for the ZnO to 4.71 eV. In a PSC, a lower work function may inhibit the electron transport from the ETL back to the perovskite absorber,21 finally leading to more effective electron extraction for cell performance enhancement.

From the above film characterizations, it is clear that iodine doping into ZnO via a hydrothermal process has brought about several beneficial merits including a more compact LAR nanopillar structure, higher optical transparency, and smoother ETL surface, together with the decrease of energy-level mismatch. We therefore assembled PSCs using the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL to compare them with ZnO NR ETL based devices. Fig. 5a illustrates the energy level diagram of both PSCs. The energy level alignment shows that the lower work function of ZnO:I effectively reduces the interface barrier, and consequently enables more facile electron extraction from the perovskite into the ETL. Fig. 5b, c and S3a, b† show top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 films on the ZnO:I nanopillar and ZnO NR-based substrates, respectively. From the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S3a†), the perovskite hardly infiltrates into the compact ZnO:I nanopillar film, and uniformly covers the surface of the ZnO:I NR film with a thickness of ∼370 nm. Fig. 5b shows that the perovskite film is characteristic of a compact and pinhole-free surface, and the ZnO:I nanopillar surface is completely covered with 100–500 nm-sized grains. In contrast, the perovskite initially fills into the pores within the ZnO NR films and subsequently forms a 200 nm-thick capping layer on the ZnO NR film (Fig. S3b†). Note that the perovskite cannot fully cover the ZnO NR film via the one-step spin-coating deposition process, and some nanorods are still distinct on top of the perovskite-capping layer (see red marks in Fig. 5c), which is similar to other reports on the one-step spin-coating of perovskite on 1D ETLs as listed in Table S1.†17,18 As such, once spiro-MeOTAD anchors on the ZnO-NR/perovskite film, direct contact between spiro-MeOTAD and ZnO will occur and thus increase the charge recombination at the ZnO-NR/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD interface and finally deteriorate the photovoltaic performance. XRD shows strong Bragg peaks centered at 14.2°, 28.5° and 43.2°, assigned to the (110), (220), and (330) diffractions of the CH3NH3PbI3 with a tetragonal crystal structure, respectively (Fig. S4†).22,23 The UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO NR and ZnO:I nanopillar-based perovskite layers are shown in Fig. S5.† Compared with the ZnO NR-based perovskite film, a discernable absorption enhancement can be found for the ZnO:I nanopillar-based perovskite film over the entire visible region. This means that more incident photons can be collected to generate more charge for a larger photocurrent and thus a higher overall PCE.

The ZnO:I nanopillar/perovskite film was assembled into PSC devices structured as ITO/ZnO:I nanopillar/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, whose schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 6a. The photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V) of PSCs based on the ZnO:I nanopillar as well as the ZnO NR ETL were measured using both reverse and forward scan directions with a scan rate of 0.2 V s−1 under 1 sun illumination at air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G), as displayed in Fig. 6b. The one-step spin-coated perovskite on the ZnO NR ETL produces an inferior PCE of 10.79% in the reverse scan direction, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.04 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.07 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 55.89%. Such a PCE (PCEmax of 10.79% and PCEavg of 9.73% in Table 1) falls exactly within the reported PCE values of ZnO NR ETL-based PSCs.14,15 While using the forward scan direction, the PCE, Jsc and FF are lowered to 9.43%, 16.23 mA cm−2, and 54.81%, respectively. By using the even and compact ZnO:I nanopillar ETL, the PSC in the reverse scan direction yields a PCEmax of 18.24%, with a Jsc of 22.42 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.13 V, a FF of 71.99%, and a PCEavg of 17.04%, as summarized in Table 1. Apparently, compared with those of the ZnO NR ETL-based cell, all key J–V parameters of the iodine doped one are significantly enhanced. The larger Voc likely arises from the lowered work function of the ZnO:I ETL owing to iodine doping.24 The higher Jsc and FF might be attributed to the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL with excellent optical transparency, a better matched work function and a compact planar surface.9Fig. 6c shows the EQE spectra of the PSC based on the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL with a highest EQE value of 89% around 500 nm. The integrated Jsc calculated from the EQE data is 22.14 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the measured Jsc (22.42 mA cm−2). The PCE of the device based on the ZnO:I 1D ETL synthesized in this study is also compared to those of other similar 1D ETL based PSCs listed in the literature.14–18 Table S1† shows the findings of this comparison. It is evident that the PCE of the ZnO:I 1D nanopillar reported here is far superior to those of any other 1D ETL materials to date. Furthermore, note that the cell based on the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL exhibits a lower J–V hysteresis than that based on ZnO NRs, with a minimal change observed in the Jsc (22.22 mA cm−2) and PCE (17.95%) when measuring in the forward scan direction. It is reported that the J–V hysteresis originates from the poor contact interface between the perovskite and the ETL or HTL, residual charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface, trap-state density and ion migration within the perovskite.6,9,25–28 As for the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL-based PSCs, the low J–V hysteresis arises from the following reasons caused by I doping: (i) allowing a lower work function for efficient electron extraction from the perovskite into the ZnO:I ETL, (ii) enabling a better electrical contact interface between the perovskite and the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL or spiro-MeOTAD HTL for facile charge transport that effectively prevents charge accumulation at the interfaces, (iii) reducing the electron trap-state density of the perovskite film fabricated on the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL, as will be discussed later. To further confirm the reproducibility of the PSCs based on both 1D ZnO ETLs, more individual devices are fabricated and the PCE distribution histograms are shown in Fig. 6d and Tables S2 and S3.† It is clear that the PCEs of the PSCs using the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL show a very narrow distribution. The high PCE and good device reproducibility are more likely due to the more compact perovskite fully covering the ZnO:I nanopillar planar ETL with a small RMS roughness (19.4 nm) to effectively avoid the contact between the ETL and the HTL. The ZnO:I nanopillar ETL-based cell is further subjected to long-term cell durability testing under ambient conditions. Owing to their ionic character, organometallic halide perovskites are notoriously sensitive to moisture and consequently suffer from the rapid degradation of unsealed PSCs in a humid environment.29,30 Here, the PSCs using the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL were exposed continuously to ambient air at a relative humidity of 40% for 15 days and the results of the time-dependent measurements of the cell photovoltaic performance are shown in Fig. S6†. Initially, the value of PCE for the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL-based cell reaches the highest one (18.24%) after one-day exposure to ambient air due to the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD,31 and then degrades by only about 20% after exposure to ambient air for 15 days, demonstrating a good ambient durability.

Steady state photoluminescence (SS-PL) spectra were recorded to investigate the trap states of perovskite and electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETL. The SS-PL spectra of the perovskite layers prepared on SiO2, ZnO NR/ITO, and ZnO:I nanopillar/ITO substrates (Fig. 7a) show that the perovskite/ZnO:I peak blue-shifts from 772 nm to 767 nm, demonstrating that the trap states in the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber are effectively passivated. The passivation of defect trap states within the perovskite/ZnO:I nanopillar film can lead to suppressed charge recombination and an increased exciton diffusion length, and hence improved device performance including a lower J–V hysteresis.6 Additionally, the PL intensity decreases due to quenching effects when the ZnO ETL is placed on the ITO glass. The emission of the perovskite layer is remarkably quenched (64% quenching) by the ZnO:I nanopillar layer, as compared to a 45% quenching by the ZnO NR layer. The decrease of PL intensity means more efficient electron extraction occurring at the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL/perovskite interface. These results are further supported by the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) measurements (Fig. 7b and Table 2). The perovskite layers on the SiO2 show a long PL lifetime ca. 86.5 ns. When coated with a layer of the ZnO NR ETL as the electron quencher, the PL lifetime of perovskite layer is shortened to 73.2 ns. When the perovskite is coated on the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL, the PL lifetime is further significantly shortened to 49.8 ns. These results indicate that the electrons are extracted more efficiently from the excited perovskite into the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL than into the ZnO NR ETL, which is attributable to the better-matched work function between the perovskite absorber and the ZnO:I ETL. Besides, the compact ZnO:I ETL provides a planar surface to enable the deposition of a fully covering flat and uniform perovskite layer and hence construct a perfect ETL/perovskite/HTL interface, which effectively facilitates electron transport and suppresses charge recombination at the interface. In contrast, for the ZnO NR ETL, poor perovskite infiltration into the ZnO NR framework (Fig. 5c) and the resultant uneven perovskite capping layer on the ZnO NR ETL may increase the contact probability between spiro-MeOTAD and ZnO NRs, and charge recombination at the perovskite/ZnO-NR interface. Thus, the reduced PL decay lifetime is favorable for inhibiting the charge recombination at the perovskite/ZnO:I ETL interface, which finally leads to a remarkable enhancement of Jsc and FF together with PCE.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an efficient tool that provides more insight into the electron extraction process within PSCs. Fig. 8 displays the Nyquist plots of the PSCs using the ZnO NR and ZnO:I nanopillar ETLs as measured at Voc under AM1.5 illumination with a frequency ranging from 1000 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The radius of the semicircle at the high frequency of the Nyquist plot reflects the internal resistance of the cells including each layer and interface. Obviously, the internal resistance of the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL-based cell is decreased to 33.5 Ω, which is significantly lower than that (59.8 Ω) obtained with the ZnO NR-based cell, indicating more efficient electron extraction and collection as a result at the perovskite/ZnO:I nanopillar interface.32 This EIS analysis result agrees well with those of the previously published studies on niobium- or nitrogen-doped ETL-based PSCs, in which the doped alien species (Nb and N) efficiently increase the conductivity of the oxide layer, reduce the internal resistance and hence increase the electron density in oxide ETLs.14,33 Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were performed to further explore the electron transport and recombination properties of the PSCs using the ZnO NR and ZnO:I nanopillar ETLs. The dynamics of electron transport and recombination in PSCs obtained by IMPS and IMVS measurements at different light intensities (regulated by the voltage of light sources) are shown in Fig. 9. The electron transport time (τt) and charge recombination time (τR) are estimated by using the minimum frequencies (fmin) from IMPS and IMVS plots using the equations τt = 1/2πfmin(IMPS) and τR = 1/2πfmin(IMVS), respectively.34,35 The ZnO:I nanopillar ETL-based cell shows a lower τt and a higher τR than the ZnO NR-based one, indicating the faster electron transport rate and lower recombination rate at the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL/perovskite interface during the optical–electrical conversion process (Fig. 9a and b). The low τt value originates from the compact ZnO:I nanopillar ETL planar surface and the uniform deposition of the perovskite over the ZnO:I nanopillar surface, which enables the formation of good interfacial contact between ZnO:I and the perovskite, which serves as an efficient barrier to prevent the contact between ZnO:I and spiro-OMeTAD, hence reducing the hole–electron encountering probability and recombination. Furthermore, the electron diffusion coefficients (Dn) of PSCs could be obtained from τt and the layer thickness using the equation Dn = d2/2.5τt.36,37 The Dn value of the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL-based cell is higher than that of the ZnO NR one, indicating that the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL is more favorable for electron transport than the ZnO NR ETL (Fig. 9c). Therefore, the average electron diffusion length (DL) of the ZnO:I nanopillar ETL-based cell is much longer than that of the ZnO NR one due to the increase in the Dn and τR values according to Einstein's relationship DL = (DnτR)0.5 (Fig. 9d).38,39DL represents the average distance an electron travels before it combines with either a perovskite or a spiro-OMeTAD hole conductor.40 A longer DL implies that more efficient PSCs will be achieved with a thicker ZnO:I nanopillar ETL than with the ZnO NR ETL, because both the enhanced electron transport through the geometry effect and the increased electron time by inhibition of electron recombination can contribute to the increase in electron DL. This means that more electrons transfer from the perovskite/ZnO:I nanopillar ETL interface to the ITO substrate, hence leading to higher charge collection and light-harvesting efficiency for achieving a higher Jsc and PCE, together with excellent long-term cell durability under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the prolonged carrier lifetime and increased diffusion length in the ZnO:I pillar ETL-based cell are also most likely responsible for the reduced hysteresis in our devices.41

Conclusions
In summary, a LAR ZnO:I nanopillar planar film has been developed as an ETL to enable the one-step spin-coating deposition of a uniform perovskite layer to achieve a high performance PSC with a PCE of 18.24%, which sets a new record for 1D ETL based PSCs. The outstanding cell performance has been demonstrated to be attributed to the prominent merits of the LAR ZnO:I nanopillar ETL, including a smoother planar surface, a more appropriate work function, better optical transparency, reduced contact resistance and enhanced electron transport, together with decreased electron trap-state density of the perovskite layer. The final devices also showed low J–V hysteresis and excellent long-term cell durability under ambient conditions. This work may open up new opportunities for reliably fabricating high efficiency PSCs based on compositional and structural fine control of the 1D nanoarchitectured semiconducting ETL.
Experimental
Device fabrication
All chemicals, unless specified otherwise, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CH3NH3I (>99%) and spiro-MeOTAD (>99%) were obtained from Dyesol. PbI2 (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All other organic solvents were obtained as analytical grade from J&K Chemical Ltd. with storage in a sealed bottle with molecular sieves. The above reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
First, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (Dyesol) were cleaned by ultrasonication with soap, deionized water, acetone, and finally isopropyl alcohol. The ZnO:I nanopillar array films were prepared by a two-step hydrothermal process. A dense ZnO seed layer was first formed by spin-coating a solution of 0.75 M zinc acetate dihydrate in a mixture of 2-aminoethanol and 2-methoxyethanol (9:200 v/v) on ITO substrates, followed by heat treatment at 300 °C for 20 min. Afterwards, vertical ZnO:I nanopillars gradually grew by immersing the seeded substrate in a mixed solution of 40 mM zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 40 mM hexamethylenetetramine in a neutral solution of iodic acid for 3 hours at 91.5 °C. The ZnO:I nanopillar films were rinsed with ethyl alcohol and DI water several times and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. The formation of the ZnO:I nanopillar films is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Undoped ZnO NR films were also fabricated by the above process without the addition of the neutral solution of iodic acid in the growth solution.
The as-synthesized CH3NH3I (0.262 g) and PbI2 (0.758 g) were mixed in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (2 mL) by shaking at room temperature for 20 min to obtain a clear CH3NH3PbI3 solution with a concentration of 35 wt%. Note that the perovskite precursor solution was filtered before use. For preparing perovskite films, the CH3NH3PbI3 solution was spin coated onto the ZnO nanopillar or ZnO NR ETL coated ITO substrates by a fast deposition crystallization procedure.42 In this work, the ZnO-based substrate was spun at 5000 rpm for 30 s, during which anhydrous chlorobenzene (150 μL) was quickly dropped onto the center of the substrate in just six seconds. Simultaneously, an instant color change of the substrate from transparent to light brown was observed after adding dropwise anhydrous chlorobenzene, indicating the quick formation of CH3NH3PbI3. Finally, the obtained films were dried at 70 °C for 20 min.
The hole transport material consisting of 72.3 mg of 2,29,7,70-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,99-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), 17.5 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich)/acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1) and 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich) in a solvent of 1 mL chlorobenzene (99.9%, Aldrich) was deposited onto the CH3NH3PbI3-based ZnO films via spin coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the PSC device assembly was completed by the thermal evaporation of 70 nm thick Ag as the counter electrode onto the top of the HTM layer.
Characterizations
The morphology and microstructure of the ZnO nanopillar films and the formed perovskite films were characterized using a JEOL JSM-6701 F field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The crystal structure of the ZnO nanopillar films and perovskite layers was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, D/max 2500 VB2þ/PC), in the 2θ range from 10° to 60° with CuKR radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) operated at 40 mA and 40 kV. The transmittance of the ZnO nanopillar films and light absorption properties of the perovskite/ZnO based films were studied by UV-visible light absorption/diffuse reflectance spectrometry (Lambda 950, Perkin Elmer) at room temperature. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images were obtained with a Bruker Metrology Nanoscope III-D atomic force microscope in tapping mode. The work function of samples was measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) with a Bruker Metrology Nanoscope VIII AFM. Conducting AFM tips (MESP-V2/antimony (n) doped Si, Bruker, USA) used for this study had a typical spring constant of 3 N m−1 and a resonance frequency of 75 kHz. The typical scan line frequency was 0.3 Hz and each image contained 512 × 512 pixels. Steady state photoluminescence (SS-PL) spectra were recorded at 775 nm after excitation at 460 nm with a xenon lamp. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra were measured on a photoluminescence spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh Instruments), excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser CW NIR laser at 460 nm as the excitation source and measured at 775 nm. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by applying a bias of the open-circuit voltage with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and frequencies ranging from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz under AM 1.5G. Intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) was carried out on a CIMPS system (PP211, Zahner) under LED white light illumination powered in the light source potential range from 0.6 to 0.9 V with an AC amplitude of 0.1 V from 10−1 to 10−5 Hz. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was acquired using an Oriel model QE-PV-SI system equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp irradiation source together with a calibrated silicon photodetector. The PSCs were stored in ambient air and then measured under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight illumination with 100 mW cm−2 light output using a solar light simulator (Newport Oriel Sol 3A class, America, calibrated using a Newport reference cell), and the data were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under ambient conditions at room temperature. Both the forward and reverse scans were used with a scan rate of 0.2 V s−1 and a delay time of 5 s. The cell size was 2 cm × 2 cm and the active area of each solar cell was 0.09 cm2, which was defined by the area of the Ag electrode.
