    , Accepted 18th June 2021First published on 18th June 2021AbstractTwo wide-bandgap copolymer donors, W4 and W5, based on mono-fluorine- and mono-alkoxyl-substituted benzene units were developed. W4 and W5 were synthesized from cheap and commercially available starting materials. Organic solar cells based on W4 and W5 gave decent power conversion efficiencies of up to 15.25%.
In the past 5 years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has rapidly increased from 10% to 18% due to the development of efficient low-bandgap (LBG) nonfullerene acceptors and wide-bandgap (WBG) copolymer donors.1–12 It is believed that OSCs will eventually go to market due to their merits, such as solution processing, roll-to-roll fabrication, lightweight, flexibility and semitransparency.13,14 However, the high synthesis cost of current high-performance donor and acceptor materials will slow down the commercialization of OSCs.15 The cost comes from the tedious and multi-step synthesis, as well as the use of expensive starting materials. The development of efficient yet low-cost donors and acceptors has become an important topic.16,17 In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted towards this direction.18–27
Previously, our group demonstrated that fluorine- and alkoxyl-substituted benzene (FAB) units are good building blocks to construct WBG copolymer donors.28 The aromatic benzene of FAB widens the bandgap effectively. The S⋯O and H⋯F noncovalent conformation locks can improve the planarity, packing, crystallinity and hole mobility of copolymers, and enhance the photovoltaic performance.29 Moreover, the fluorine atoms can lower the HOMO level and improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc), and alkoxyl can ensure good solubility of copolymers. A FAB copolymer donor W1 based on a bis-fluorine- and bis-alkoxyl-substituted benzene unit shows an ultra-wide optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 2.16 eV, and delivered an impressive PCE of 16.23% in solar cells (Fig. 1). W1 was prepared via a 5-step synthesis from the starting material 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2-diol. However, 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2-diol is an expensive starting material with a price of ¥2333/g as shown on the website of Bidepharm Co. (Shanghai).30 In this work, we report two FAB copolymer donors W4 and W5 based on two mono-fluorine- and mono-alkoxyl-substituted benzene units (Fig. 1). W4 and W5 can be synthesized from much cheaper starting materials such as 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluorobenzene and 1,4-dibromo-2,5-difluorobenzene. The prices of 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluorobenzene and 1,4-dibromo-2,5-difluorobenzene are ¥48/g and ¥6/g, respectively, which are only 2% and 0.3% of that of 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2-diol.30 Excitingly, decent PCEs of 15.25% and 13.00% were achieved from W4 and W5 solar cells, respectively.
 Fig. 1  The structures and corresponding starting materials for W1, W4 and W5. 
To avoid the use of expensive fluorinated phenol derivatives as the starting materials, a NaH-promoted nucleophilic alkoxylation strategy was employed to synthesize the FAB units of W4 and W5. The synthetic routes are shown in Scheme 1. Stille coupling of 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluorobenzene and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane gave 2,2′-(2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene in 82% yield. Bromination of 2,2′-(2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene gave 5,5′-(2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(2-bromothiophene) in 96% yield. Finally, the nucleophilic alkoxylation was done by treating 5,5′-(2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(2-bromothiophene) with 2-octyldodecan-1-ol and NaH. The monomer M1 was obtained in a 37% yield (see ESI†). The low yield obtained following this step is due to the formation of a bis-alkoxylation side product. The total yield of M1 from 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluorobenzene is 29%. Similarly, the monomer M2 was obtained in 29% total yield from 1,4-dibromo-2,5-difluorobenzene. Copolymers W4 and W5 were synthesized via the Stille copolymerization of M1 with FBDT-Sn and M2 with FBDT-Sn, respectively. We have roughly calculated the total cost of a one-gram final polymer (W1, W4 or W5) by considering the costs of starting materials and reagents used in the synthesis (see ESI†).18,19 The total costs of one-gram W1, W4 and W5 are ¥2817.26, ¥1688.32 and ¥2436.46, respectively. The lower costs for W4 and W5 compared to W1 are due to the cheaper starting materials and involvement of less synthetic steps. W4 and W5 are well soluble in chloroform and chlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI) are 53.4 kDa and 1.77 for W4 and 64.9 kDa and 2.03 for W5, respectively. The thermal properties of W4 and W5 were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) for W4 and W5 are 386 °C and 409 °C, respectively, suggesting good thermal stability of the copolymers (Fig. S8, ESI†). The DSC results show no phase transition peaks for W4 and W5, suggesting their amorphous feature (Fig. S9, ESI†).
 Scheme 1  The synthetic routes for W4 and W5. 
The absorption spectra for W4 and W5 films are shown in Fig. 2a. W4 and W5 show a major absorption band at 400–600 nm, with a low-energy peak at 539 nm and 549 nm, respectively, and a high-energy peak at 502 nm and 513 nm, respectively. The absorption onsets for W4 and W5 films are 574 nm and 591 nm, respectively, corresponding to large optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 2.16 eV and 2.10 eV. The nonfullerene acceptor Y6 shows an absorption band at 600–950 nm, which is complementary to that of W4 and W5 (Fig. 2a). The energy levels for W4 and W5 were estimated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S10, ESI†). The HOMO levels for W4 and W5 are −5.56 eV and −5.46 eV, respectively, and the LUMO levels are −3.43 eV and −3.39 eV, respectively (Fig. 2b). The deep HOMO levels of W4 and W5 lead to high Voc in solar cells. Y6 shows a HOMO of −5.65 eV and a LUMO of −4.10 eV. We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to gain more structural information on W4 and W5 (Fig. 3). Considering that there are 4 possible conformers for the FAB unit in W4 (or W5), firstly, we optimized the geometries of these conformers and calculated their single-point energies at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.31 It was found that for either W4 or W5 the “H⋯F and S⋯O” conformers are always the most stable ones (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†). The results suggest that the H⋯F and S⋯O interactions could be more favorable than the S⋯F and H⋯O interactions. Next, we optimized the geometries for W4 and W5 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level (Fig. 3). The optimized structures of W4 and W5 indicate the good coplanarity of the polymer backbone, because the dihedral angles between the FAB units and thiophene units are small, 10.8°–17.5° for W4 and 8.5°–17.3° for W5, respectively. The good coplanarity could originate from the noncovalent conformation locking between the FAB and thiophene units.29 The DFT calculations indicate a deeper HOMO and a larger bandgap for W4.

Solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Ag were made to evaluate the performance of W4 and W5. J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The best W4:Y6 cells gave a PCE of 15.25%, with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 25.05 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.0%. These cells have a D/A ratio of 1:1.2 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 115 nm and 0.3 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE) as the additive (Tables S1–S3, ESI†). The best W5:Y6 cells gave a PCE of 13.00%, with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 25.33 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.2%. These cells have a D/A ratio of 1:1.2 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 110 nm and 0.1 vol% DPE as the additive (Tables S4–S6, ESI†). The Voc for W4 cells is 0.04 V higher than that of W5 cells due to the deeper HOMO level of W4. The Jsc values for the W4 and W5 cells are comparable. As shown in Fig. 4b, the W4 and W5 cells gave comparable EQE. The EQE maxima for the W4 and W5 cells are 83% (at 505 nm) and 85% (at 520 nm), respectively. The integrated current densities from the EQE spectra are 24.25 mA cm−2 and 24.28 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc from J–V measurements. The higher FF for the W4 cells suggests better charge transport and less charge recombination in the active layer. We investigated the charge carrier mobilities by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S13–S15 and Table S7, ESI†).32–35 For pure W4 and W5 films, W4 shows higher hole mobility (μh) of 7.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of W5 (4.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The μh and electron mobility (μe) are 4.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the W4:Y6 film and 2.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the W5:Y6 film, respectively. The faster and more balanced charge carrier transport in the W4:Y6 film is beneficial to the FF. We studied bimolecular recombination by plotting Jsc against light intensity (Plight) (Fig. S16, ESI†).36 The α values for W4 and W5 cells are 0.973 and 0.964, respectively, suggesting less recombination in W4 cells. The suppressed charge recombination also benefits the FF in the W4 cells. We investigated the active layer morphology by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S17, ESI†). W4:Y6 blend films presented a rougher surface than W5:Y6 blend films. The root-mean-square roughnesses are 1.59 nm and 1.09 nm for W4:Y6 and W5:Y6 films, respectively.

Conclusions
Two wide-bandgap copolymer donors W4 and W5 based on mono-fluorine- and mono-alkoxyl-substituted benzene units were developed. Compared with our previously reported donor W1, W4 and W5 can be synthesized from much cheaper starting materials by using the NaH-promoted nucleophilic alkoxylation strategy. The copolymers offered PCEs up to 15.25% in OSCs. This work indicates the potential of FAB copolymers in OSC commercialization.
