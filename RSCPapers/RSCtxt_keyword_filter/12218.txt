Herein, we demonstrate a new approach of simplified close space sublimation (CSS) deposition to grow a high quality CH3NH3PbI3 thin film in a low-vacuum and even non-vacuum oven. In this method, a highly crystallized and uniform perovskite film can be easily obtained by simply controlling the thickness of the PbI2 and CH3NH3I films, the reaction time of CH3NH3I vapor with the PbI2 film, and the distance of the sublimation space. With this approach, a large area of 100 mm2 can be easily obtained. The crystallinity of the perovskite film was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the morphology of the perovskite thin film was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The planar heterojunction PerSCs with a structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Al were fabricated and power conversion efficiencies of 16.2%, 12.9% and 10.8% were achieved for the devices with a photoactive area of 4 mm2, 25 mm2 and 100 mm2, respectively.

Broader context
High-efficiency organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PerSCs) have been regarded as a promising candidate for clean energy applications. The quality of the perovskite thin film for large dimensional PerSCs is one of the major challenges for the commercial application of PerSCs in the future. In this work, a simplified close space sublimation method was proposed for high efficiency and large dimensional PerSCs. The PbI2 film and CH3NH3I film were put face to face to form a close space, and then sublimated CH3NH3I reacted with PbI2 and grew into CH3NH3PbI3 in an isothermal low-vacuum oven. A high quality perovskite film can be obtained even with large dimensions by simply controlling the distance of the close space, the thickness of the PbI2 and CH3NH3I films, and the reaction time, which demonstrates that this approach would be a new option for the manufacture of high-efficiency and large dimensional PerSCs.

1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PerSCs) have been highlighted in the field of photovoltaic technology in recent years. Because of the advantages of high carrier mobility, low exciton binding energy, high absorption coefficient and suitable band gap, perovskite materials (especially CH3NH3PbI3) have been regarded as ideal photovoltaic materials.1–3 With great contributions from the chemistry, materials and physics communities, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PerSCs has been dramatically improved from the initially reported 3.8% to 20.1% in just six years.4,5
The quality of the perovskite film plays a crucial role in the performance of perovskite devices. Several approaches have been proposed to improve the quality of perovskite films such as one-step spin-coating,6–10 sequential deposition,11–14 co-evaporation,15,16 and a vapor assisted solution process.17–19 For the one-step spin-coating method, precursors of the lead source (PbI2, PbCl2, or Pb(Ac)2) and an alkyl halogenated amine (typically CH3NH3I) are usually dissolved in the same polar solvent (dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide or gamma-butyrolactone). The crystal perovskite formed through solvent evaporation when high-speed spin-coating the precursors onto the substrate. In this case, the fast solvent evaporation and rapid reaction of PbI2 with CH3NH3I make it hard to control the growth of the perovskite crystal, inducing pin-holes within the final perovskite film, leading to low coverage of the substrate.11,18 Using PbCl2 or Pb(Ac)2 as the lead source could result in smoother and better coverage of the perovskite film.8,10 However, there are by-products released during the formation of stoichiometric CH3NH3PbI3 crystals,20,21 and these by-products can potentially deteriorate the purity of the perovskite film. Therefore, Grätzel et al. developed the sequential deposition method.11 This two-step sequential approach first involves the deposition of the lead source PbI2, and then dipping the PbI2 film into a solution of CH3NH3I or spin-coating the CH3NH3I solution onto the PbI2 film to yield a perovskite crystal. This method has been successfully used in PerSCs with porous nanostructured scaffolds, while it is hard to apply in planar PerSCs without the scaffold structure, since the CH3NH3I molecules would be much harder to infiltrate into the dense PbI2 film, which would lead to the incomplete reaction of PbI2.3,18 The co-evaporation method involves the simultaneous sublimation of CH3NH3I and PbI2, co-depositing organic and inorganic species under high vacuum conditions. This approach can obtain dense and pin-hole-free high quality perovskite films. However, this high vacuum based technique is time and energy consuming.15 To solve this problem, a vapor assisted solution process was proposed, where CH3NH3I vapor reacts with the pre-deposited PbI2 film to form a perovskite active layer, and a 1 micrometer large perovskite crystal can be achieved using this method.18 However, for this approach it is hard to accurately control the amount of sublimated CH3NH3I vapor originating from the CH3NH3I powder, leading to the non-uniform reaction of PbI2, especially for large dimension devices. So the photoactive areas of PerSCs reported in the literature using this method to deposit perovskite are less than 30 mm2.
Herein, we firstly demonstrate a novel simplified close space sublimation (CSS) deposition for growing a high quality CH3NH3PbI3 thin film in a low-vacuum and even non-vacuum oven. In this method, a highly crystallized and uniform perovskite film can be easily obtained by simply controlling the thickness of the PbI2 and CH3NH3I films, the reaction time of CH3NH3I vapor with the PbI2 film, and the distance of the sublimation space. With this approach, a large area of 100 mm2 can be easily obtained. The CSS technique is characterized by placing the source very close to the substrate, which was first proposed by Nicoll in 1963 for the heteroepitaxial growth of GaAs on a Ge substrate.22 In 1999, F. Rábago-Bernal developed an isothermal CSS technique, which greatly decreased the cost for the epitaxial growth of thin films.23 And now the CSS technique is widely used in all kinds of inorganic film deposition for optoelectronic applications. For the CSS technique, several interrelated parameters including the temperature of the source and substrate, and the gap between the source and substrate, as well as the temperature, pressure and composition of the vapors in the deposition chamber significantly influence the film growth rate.24
In our case, for CH3NH3PbI3 deposition the procedures are greatly simplified and the conditions are much milder. One source of PbI2 is pre-spin-coated on a modified fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass slide, and another source of CH3NH3I is also pre-spin-coated on a cleaned glass slide. The two slides are then put face to face with a thin hollow aluminum foil gasket to form the close space in an isothermal vacuum or non-vacuum oven, as shown in Fig. 1. With increasing the temperature to 150 °C, the CH3NH3I film will sublimate to generate uniform CH3NH3I vapor, which will react with the pre-deposited PbI2 layer to yield CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite on the FTO side. Since almost all of the sublimated CH3NH3I vapor could react with PbI2, the reaction can be easily handled by controlling the thickness of the CH3NH3I film and the reaction time, and these advantages are good for large dimensional perovskite film growth. Based on this simplified CSS method, the planar heterojunction PerSCs with a structure of FTO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/CH3NH3PbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Al were fabricated and power conversion efficiencies of 16.2%, 12.9% and 10.8% were achieved for the small device of 4 mm2, middle device of 25 mm2, and large device of 100 mm2, respectively.

2. Results and discussion
In order to monitor the reaction process of PbI2 with CH3NH3I in a simplified CSS vacuum oven, perovskite films with different annealing times were fabricated. The UV-Vis spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 films and precursor PbI2 film deposited on FTO/PEDOT:PSS substrates are shown in Fig. 2. For the PbI2 film, the exciton band is located at the absorption edge of 499 nm, which is consistent with previous reports.25 After reacting for 1 h, the characteristic CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorption shoulder appears at around 780 nm,26 and the absorption intensity increases sharply with increasing the annealing time from 1 h to 2 h. When further increasing the annealing time to 3 h, there is no obvious change in absorption shape and intensity, indicating that the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 is almost complete after annealing for over 2 h.

The crystallinity of the perovskite film is crucial for the performance of PerSCs. To better understand the formation process and the quality of the obtained perovskite film, the XRD characterization was performed as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) displays the XRD pattern of the PEDOT:PSS modified FTO substrate. The peaks at 26.8° (110), 34.1° (101), 38.1° (200), 51.8° (211), and 54.8° (220) are the characteristic diffractions of FTO.27Fig. 3(b) shows the diffraction pattern of the PbI2 film deposited on the PEDOT:PSS/FTO substrate. Except for the substrate peaks, four diffraction peaks at 12.8°, 25.6°, 38.7° and 52.4°, corresponding to the c axis orientation of the (001), (002), (003) and (004) lattice planes, respectively, can be observed.11,28Fig. 3(c)–(g) give the XRD diffractions of the perovskite films grown on the PEDOT:PSS modified FTO substrate with a 0.2 mm sublimation distance and different annealing times. The strong diffraction peaks of 14.3°, 28.6°, 32.1° and 40.9°, marked with an asterisk, attributed to the (110), (220), (312) and (224) lattice planes, respectively, are the characteristic peaks for an orthorhombic CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystal.29,30 For comparison, the peaks of the substrate and PbI2 are marked with dashed lines. As shown in the XRD patterns, the relative strength of the PbI2 peaks decline while the signals for CH3NH3PbI3 increase with prolonging the annealing time. There are obvious PbI2 peaks for the perovskite films annealed for less than 2.5 h, which means that the reaction of PbI2 and CH3NH3I is incomplete and unreacted PbI2 still remains in the perovskite layer. This residual PbI2 in the perovskite film could deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of the PerSCs, and even induce serious hysteresis in the J–V curves.31,32 When prolonging the annealing time to 2.5 h, the peaks of PbI2 disappear, leaving strong CH3NH3PbI3 characteristic peaks as shown in Fig. 3(f). This infers that the sublimated CH3NH3I vapor can penetrate to the bottom of the PbI2 film and react with the residual PbI2 when the annealing time is extended to 2.5 h. Upon further increasing the annealing time to 3 h, there is no change in the characteristic perovskite peaks (Fig. 3(g)). This means that all of the PbI2 reacted with CH3NH3I to yield CH3NH3PbI3 crystals when the film was annealed for 2.5 h, and the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal is complete.

Besides the composition and the crystallinity of the perovskite film, the surface topography of the film has a great influence on the performance of PerSCs. The surface topography information of the PbI2 film and perovskite films annealed for different lengths of time was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4. The surface topography changes with increasing the reaction time. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the PbI2 film is 9.9 nm (Fig. 4(a)), while the RMS roughness increased to 16.6 nm (Fig. 4(b)), 17.7 nm (Fig. 4(c)), 23.7 nm (Fig. 4(d)), 22.4 nm (Fig. 4(i)) and 17.9 nm (Fig. 4(j)) when the PbI2 film reacted with CH3NH3I vapor for 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 2.5 h and 3 h, respectively. The morphology change is ascribed to the structural transformation from an edge sharing octahedral structure to a corner-sharing octahedral structure when PbI2 grows into a CH3NH3PbI3 crystal.5,33 This structural transformation induces the increase in the surface roughness and film thickness. Typically, a 160 nm PbI2 film could turn into a 290 nm perovskite film with this transformation. From the SEM images as shown in Fig. 4(e), many pores are observed in the plate-like PbI2 film. These pores allow CH3NH3I vapor to penetrate into the PbI2 film and completely react with PbI2. Fig. 4(f) shows the SEM images of a 1 h annealed perovskite film. In contrast to the PbI2 film as shown in Fig. 4(e), the pore size and density are greatly decreased and rod-like large crystals appear although there are many small particles of unreacted PbI2. When extending the annealing time to 1.5 h (Fig. 4(g)), the amount of small particles decreases, while the size of the crystal is not obviously expanded. These observations suggest that at the early stage of perovskite formation with annealing for 1 h to 1.5 h, CH3NH3I majorly reacts with the surface PbI2 film. When the annealing time is increased to 2 h or longer, the grain size of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal is clearly enlarged, as shown in Fig. 4(h), (k) and (l). In addition, there are many pin-holes in the perovskite films annealed for 1 h and 1.5 h, while the pin-holes and grain boundaries sharply decrease when the annealing time is increased to 2 h or a much longer time. This means that when the film is annealed for 2 h, the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 mainly arises from CH3NH3I molecules penetrating into the PbI2 film and reacting with the residual PbI2. Fig. 4(m) shows the cross-section SEM image of the perovskite film annealed for 2.5 h on a PEDOT:PSS/FTO substrate, and a dense perovskite layer with uniform thickness can be easily identified. The observed high quality of the perovskite film could contribute to enhancing photovoltaic performance and enlarging the device dimensions in PerSCs.

In simplified close space sublimation, the distance of sublimation space would also play an important role in the growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 film. The crystal quality and morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 films fabricated under a different distance (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mm) of sublimation space were also investigated using XRD, and AFM and SEM, respectively. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), with the annealing time set as 2.5 h and the distance increasing to 0.4 mm or 0.6 mm, the peaks of PbI2 are observed in the XRD pattern and the intensity of the PbI2 peaks is boosted as the distance increases. There are no obvious PbI2 signals for the perovskite film sublimated at a distance of 0.2 mm (Fig. 3(f)). These observations indicate that increasing the sublimation distance results in more residual unreacted PbI2 and this is ascribed to the limited mean free path of CH3NH3I compared to the space between the PbI2 and CH3NH3I substrates. Fig. S2 (ESI†) demonstrates the surface morphology of the obtained perovskite films. From the AFM images, the RMS of the perovskite film with a 0.4 and 0.6 mm sublimation distance is 16 and 14 nm, respectively. From the SEM images, the grain size decreases and the proportion of smaller crystals increases with increasing the sublimation distance. The decreased surface roughness and crystal size are attributed to the fact that not enough CH3NH3I vapor can reach the PbI2 substrate for crystal expansion at an increased sublimation distance.
Based on the simplified-CSS grown perovskite films, typical planar heterojunction PerSCs with the structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Al were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 1. Two heterojunctions of CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3/PEDOT:PSS exist in this structure, and photo-generated excitons with a low binding energy could be dissociated into free holes and electrons at both heterojunction interfaces when shining light from the FTO side.19,34 The function of the PCBM and PEDOT:PSS is the collection and transportation of the electrons and holes to the Al and FTO electrode, respectively. Fig. 5(a) shows the J–V curves of the PerSCs based on the different annealing times with a 0.2 mm sublimation distance. At the initial stage (1–2 h), the PCE of the perovskite device is lower than 10%. Contrastingly, when the annealing time is increased to 2.5 h, the PCE of the devices is greatly enhanced from 2.6% (1 h) to 16.2% (2.5 h), with simultaneous improvement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and filling factor (FF). The Jsc, Voc, and FF increase from 7.5 mA cm−2, 0.62 V, and 50.0% to 19.6 mA cm−2, 1.03 V, and 80.2%, respectively, for devices annealed for 1 h and 2.5 h. The photovoltaic parameters (averaged from 20 individual devices) of Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE are listed in Table 1, and the champion cell performance is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), demonstrating a high PCE of 17.1% (Jsc = 23.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 75.8%). The light response property of the devices was further investigated using external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, and Fig. 5(b) displays the EQE curves of the perovskite devices annealed for different lengths of time. The integrated current of the perovskite devices annealed for 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 2.5 h, and 3 h is 7.3 mA cm−2, 12.8 mA cm−2, 15.3 mA cm−2, 19.1 mA cm−2 and 17.1 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in good agreement with the Jsc derived from the J–V measurement. It can be concluded that the annealing time greatly influences the formation and topography of the perovskite film. If the annealing time is too short, there are many PbI2 impurities remaining in the perovskite film. The PbI2 impurities in the device would deteriorate the performance of the PerSCs and aggravate the J–V hysteresis.31,32 However, excessive annealing would make unreacted CH3NH3I deposit on the surface of perovskite, which could hinder the excitons dissociation and charge transportation at the interface of CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM. So an appropriate annealing time can greatly improve the quality of the perovskite film with higher coverage, larger grain size, less grain boundaries and fewer crystal defects, which are indispensable for high performance PerSCs.

We also studied the effect of the distance of sublimation space on the device performance. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the device with a 0.4 mm sublimation distance shows a PCE of 13.1%, with a Jsc of 17.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.96 V, and an FF of 78.3%. When increasing the sublimation distance to 0.6 mm, the performance greatly declines, especially the Jsc (14.1 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.92 V), and the overall PCE decreases to 10.1%. The deterioration of the Jsc and Voc is ascribed to the crystallinity and morphology change (more residual PbI2 and a smaller crystal size) of the perovskite film with an increased sublimation distance as show in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†).
Besides the annealing time and the sublimation distance, the thickness of the perovskite layer is another important factor in improving the performance of PerSCs.35 To investigate the influence of the perovskite layer thickness on the photovoltaic performance of PerSCs, perovskite devices with different perovskite thicknesses annealed for 2.5 h were fabricated. Fig. 6(a) shows the J–V curves of the devices with perovskite films of 240, 270, 290, and 320 nm. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer, PbI2 and the perovskite film on the PEDOT:PSS modified FTO substrate were measured using a Dektak XT profilometer as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). In the range of 240–290 nm, as the thickness increases, the Jsc of the PerSCs increases from 17.3 to 19.6 mA cm−2 and the PCE increases from 11.3% to 16.2%. However, the PCE begins to decrease when the thickness of the perovskite film is increased from 290 to 320 nm. Generally speaking, with more light-harvesting, more excitons can be generated, inducing more free charge carriers, with increasing perovskite thickness. Nevertheless, with an excessively thick perovskite film, charge recombination will dominate during transportation and this is evidenced by the decrease in the FF and Voc.15,36,37 As observed in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) test (Fig. 6(b)), the integrated current dropped from 19.1 to 18.3 mA cm−2. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of these PerSCs are also listed in Table 1.

Nowadays, many approaches are successful for fabricating small area PerSCs, but it is still challenging to fabricate large area devices with good performance. In order to examine the feasibility of fabricating large area PerSCs with a simplified CSS deposited perovskite film, devices with photoactive areas of 25 mm2 and 100 mm2 were fabricated. Fortunately, the PCE of the devices with the middle area (25 mm2) and large area (100 mm2) does not sharply decrease compared with the small area (4 mm2) device. As listed in Table 1, the device with a photoactive area of 25 mm2 gives a PCE of 12.9% (Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 19.4 mA cm−2 and FF = 72.3%) and the PCE for the device with a photoactive area of 100 mm2 is 10.8% (Voc = 0.93 V, Jsc = 18.9 mA cm−2 and FF = 61.7%), indicating that the quality of the perovskite film does not decline with the increase in the photoactive area. Fig. 7(a) shows the J–V curves of the devices with different photoactive areas under AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in forward and reverse bias. The decrease of the PCE for large area devices is mainly ascribed to the decline in the FF, since the Jsc and Voc just slightly decrease when increasing the photoactive area. The corresponding EQE curves for the devices (Fig. 7(b)) show a broad plateau over the whole of the visible range. Compared to the small size device (4 mm2, 19.1 mA cm−2), there is less than a 5% decrease in the integrated current for the large size device (100 mm2, 18.4 mA cm−2).

In our experiment the resistance of FTO is 15 Ω sq−1, and the series resistance of the device should sharply increase with the enlargement of the photoactive area, which will inevitability decrease the conductivity of the substrate and induce a decrease in the FF of the PerSCs.38 In order to improve the charge transport and study the effect of FTO resistance on the performance of large dimensional devices, we fabricated devices (100 mm2) on the FTO with a resistance of 7 Ω sq−1. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the devices exhibit a PCE of 10.9% for the forward scan and 11.4% for the reverse scan with a Voc around 0.95 V, a Jsc around 18 mA cm−2, and an FF around 65%. Compared to the devices based on 15 Ω sq−1 FTO, the FF of the devices really increases when using a lower resistance FTO of 7 Ω sq−1, while there is a slight drop in the Jsc as the higher conductivity FTO bares poor light transmission.
To further simplify the processing procedures, we even tried to grow the perovskite film in a non-vacuum (ambient air filled) oven. Fig. S7 (ESI†) displays the J–V curves of the devices (4 mm2) with the perovskite film grown in a non-vacuum oven. The device still shows a PCE of 12.7% with a Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.96 V, and an FF of 72%, although all the parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) are decreased in comparison with devices based on a low vacuum (−0.1 MPa) grown perovskite film. The deteriorated performance is ascribed to the diffusion-limited CH3NH3I vapor transport in non-vacuum conditions,24 where the mean free path of CH3NH3I vapor is short compared to the space between the PbI2 and CH3NH3I substrates, and the CH3NH3I vapor molecules will collide several times with air before they condense on and then react with the PbI2 substrate, thus decreasing the kinetic energy of CH3NH3I vapor and inducing an incomplete reaction with PbI2.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel approach for the growth of a CH3NH3PbI3 thin film using simplified close space sublimation for efficient and large dimension perovskite solar cells. By simply controlling the annealing time and the thickness of the PbI2 and CH3NH3I layer, a pin-hole free, uniform and highly crystallized perovskite thin film can be achieved. The planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells based on this approach were fabricated and the dependence of the photovoltaic performance on the annealing time, perovskite thickness and photoactive area were investigated. Under optimized conditions, a PCE of 16.2% can be achieved for devices with a photoactive area of 4 mm2, by thermally annealing at 150 °C for 2.5 h to yield a 290 nm perovskite film. A promising PCE of 10.8% was also obtained for devices with a photoactive area of 100 mm2, and there is no obvious J–V hysteresis in the forward and reverse scan. Our findings supply a new option for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells with a high performance and large dimension.
4. Experimental
Materials
Patterned FTO glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 was purchased from Wuhan Geao (China). PEDOT:PSS with brand Clevious P VP AI 4083 was purchased from H. C. Stark. Methylamine solution (33 wt% in absolute ethanol), hydriodic acid (57 wt% in water) and isopropanol (99.8%, extra dry) were purchased from Acros Organics. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and lead(II) iodide (99.999%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. PCBM was purchased from Solarmer Energy, Inc. All these commercially available materials were used as received without further purification.
CH3NH3I synthesis
CH3NH3I was synthesized according to the previous literature with some modification.12 Typically, 34 mL of methylamine (33 wt% in absolute ethanol) and 38 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water) were mixed in a 150 mL three-necked flask, and then stirred at 0 °C for 2 h in an ice-water bath. After that, the mixtures were rotary evaporated at 50 °C for 1 h to remove the solvent and white CH3NH3I precipitates were recovered. Finally, the product was washed with diethyl ether three times and dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven.
Device fabrication
The patterned FTO was sequentially ultrasonic cleaned twice with detergent, pure water, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. The pre-cleaned substrate was ultraviolet ozone treated for 10 min. After that, the filtered PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was spin-coated onto the pre-treated FTO-glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 35 s and then dried at 150 °C for 15 min. A 350 mg mL−1 PbI2 DMF solution was spin-coated on the FTO/PEDOT:PSS substrate and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The CH3NH3I thin layer was deposited by spin-coating 40 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I isopropyl solution at 1000–3000 rpm for 20 s and then annealed at 80 °C for 5 min. The PbI2 film and CH3NH3I film were pressed together face to face with a 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mm hollow aluminum foil gasket between them, and the space is sufficient for the thickness increase of the PbI2 film when it grows into a CH3NH3PbI3 crystal. The whole sets were then annealed at 150 °C in a vacuum oven under a pressure of −0.1 MPa or non-vacuum oven, and the perovskite film was obtained on the PbI2 side. The process of simplified CSS to fabricate perovskite is shown in Fig. 1. After that, PCBM solution (30 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm Al cathode was deposited through thermal evaporation under a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage curves were measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator (SAN-EI, AAA grade) with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under an N2 atmosphere. The light intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell for 1 sun. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using QE-R systems (Enli Tech.). The light intensity at each wavelength was adjusted with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Instrumentation
The thickness of the films was recorded using a DektakXT profilometer (Bruker Nano, Inc.). The surface morphologies of the thin films were examined using an AC Mode III (Agilent5500) atomic force microscope (AFM) operated in the tapping mode under ambient atmosphere. The surface and cross-section morphologies of the thin films were further characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM; HITACHI SU8010, Japan) operated at an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV and 30 kV, respectively. The crystallinity of the perovskite films were measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku miniflex 600) in the 2θ range of 5–90° at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. The optical absorption of the films was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV-visible spectrophotometer.

Broader context
High-efficiency organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PerSCs) have been regarded as a promising candidate for clean energy applications. The quality of the perovskite thin film for large dimensional PerSCs is one of the major challenges for the commercial application of PerSCs in the future. In this work, a simplified close space sublimation method was proposed for high efficiency and large dimensional PerSCs. The PbI2 film and CH3NH3I film were put face to face to form a close space, and then sublimated CH3NH3I reacted with PbI2 and grew into CH3NH3PbI3 in an isothermal low-vacuum oven. A high quality perovskite film can be obtained even with large dimensions by simply controlling the distance of the close space, the thickness of the PbI2 and CH3NH3I films, and the reaction time, which demonstrates that this approach would be a new option for the manufacture of high-efficiency and large dimensional PerSCs.
