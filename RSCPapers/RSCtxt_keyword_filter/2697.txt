    , Accepted 28th June 2017First published on 28th June 2017AbstractWe report a theoretical study concerning the impact of anionic ancillary ligands of Ru(II) complex dyes on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. We explicitly discuss three Ru(II) complex dyes with either neutral or anionic tetrazolyl-based ligands. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory methods were used to determine the geometrical structures, electronic structures and absorption spectra of the sensitizers. We also conducted quantum dynamics simulation in order to elucidate how anionic ancillary ligands affect charge transfer at the dye/TiO2 interface. The calculation results suggest that the addition of more anionic ancillary ligands can efficiently raise the energy levels of occupied orbitals, enhance light-harvesting ability, and improve interface charge separation and injection. The differences in the performance associated with different number of anionic ligands can be ascribed to fundamental atomistic details. Overall, the simulation results agree with experiments, provide atomistic details of the dye–TiO2 system, and contribute to the understanding of anionic tetrazolyl-based ligand induced improvement in device performance, which is expected to provide valuable insights into the development of anionic ligand based Ru complex dyes for dye-sensitized solar cell application.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely researched because of their evident advantages of low-cost and high efficiency in converting solar energy to electricity.1–8 In DSSCs, dyes harvest solar radiation and produce photo-excited electrons that are subsequently transferred to a TiO2 semiconductor. In the meanwhile, the electrolyte, usually an I−/I3− redox couple, regenerates oxidized dyes, and is reduced at the counter electrode. Dye sensitizers are one of the most important components in DSSCs. The performance of DSSCs strongly depends on the nature of the dye sensitizer and its sophisticated interaction with TiO2 semiconductor. Light-harvesting ability of the dye being larger suggests the capability for utilization of more photon energy. Efficient interface charge transfer process is fast and can, in principle, avoid nonradiative energy loss of the absorbed photon in the form of heat through the charge–phonon interaction pathway; large in-built potential inhibits unfavorable charge recombination. Essentially, photocurrent density depends on several parameters, such as light-harvesting efficiency, electron injection efficiency, and charge collection efficiency. The latter parameter is difficult to model theoretically and can be regarded as invariant for the same type of DSSCs with different dyes. Then, the photocurrent performance is closely related to light-harvesting ability and charge transfer process.
One possible route to tune device performance is through rationalized molecular modification of sensitizers without changing other components of DSSCs device.9–12 In recent years, considerable advancement has been achieved in the synthesis of novel dyes, including metal-free organic dyes and inorganic polypyridyl ruthenium complex dyes.13–23 Ru complex dyes have been extensively studied for application in DSSCs due to their superior photo electrochemical properties and long-term stability. Nowadays, typical DSSCs based on Ru(II)–polypyridyl complex dyes, such as N719,24 achieve a power conversion efficiency of more than 11%. The high efficiency of Ru complex dyes can be partly attributed to their broad absorption spectrum, which covers the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) regime of the solar spectrum.25 Various structural modifications of Ru complex dyes have been performed in order to improve device performance. It has been demonstrated that elongation of the conjugation length of the anchoring or ancillary groups is a feasible strategy.26–32 However, there exist issues regarding the commonly used Ru complex dyes, that is, the NCS ligand is inclined to undergo ligand substitution reaction, and it is difficult to modify the thiocyanate ligand chemically; thus, the photochemical properties cannot be efficiently tuned. There have been numerous attempts to develop NCS-free Ru complex dyes,33–35 for example, replacement of NCS with cyclometalated ligands. Special interest was paid to the utilization of chelating ligands in anionic and neutral forms. Recently, Wu et al. have synthesized anionic bis(tetrazolyl)pyridine ligand, with the formal charge being −2, for utilization in Ru complex dyes.36 This ligand is assumed to be a strong electron donor over the existing pyridyl unit, and the formal charge of the ancillary ligand can thus be regulated by varying the number of tetrazolyl moieties.37–39 The Ru complex dyes based on anionic and neutral ancillary ligand exhibit strikingly different performances. Questions have been raised on how negatively charged ligands affect photo-electric properties and eventually device performance. Unfortunately, no comprehensive theoretical investigations have been reported to date.
In this study, we report a theoretical study concerning the impact of anionic tetrazolyl-based ligands of Ru complex dyes on DSSCs performance. We explicitly study three dyes, BTP, BATP, and BMTP, in which the formal charge of the ancillary ligand is −2, −1, and 0, respectively (see Fig. 1). All dyes have the same anchoring ligand; the only difference is that the BTP dye has one bis(tetrazolyl)pyridine ligand in its doubly deprotonated form, and the BMTP dye has the same ligand as BTP except for BMTP has two N-methylation tetrazolyl moiety. BTP and BMTP have been experimentally reported, and BTP exhibits a significant improvement in DSSCs performance compared to BMTP. In order to facilitate discussions, we designed a novel dye, BATP, which has only one N-methylation tetrazolyl unit compared with BTP. We investigate the absorption properties and electronic structures as well as interface electron transfer (IET) dynamics of the three dyes. We aim to establish a correlation between the number of anionic ligands and device performance. Our simulations show that the introduction of negatively charged ligands enhances electron donating ability, and correspondingly raises the energy levels of the occupied orbitals. This promotes decrease in electronic band gap and leads to wider and stronger absorption bands, thereby facilitating sunlight harvesting. Most importantly, the anionic ligands affect the distribution of the unoccupied molecular orbitals and play important roles in direct electronic coupling between dye excited states and 3d states of the TiO2 semiconductor, thus modulating the IET rate. The results show that BTP, with the most anionic tetrazolyl-based ligands, has the largest in-built potential for efficient charge separation and fast IET. These properties contribute to the better photocurrent performance of the BTP dye.

2. Computational details
Ground state structures are optimized using a combination of the B3LYP functional40 and LanL2DZ pseudopotential basis set.41,42 It is well-known that pure DFT cannot properly deal with excitation energy. Herein, we used different hybrid functionals, such as B3LYP, PBE0,40 BHandH,43 CAM-B3LYP,44 BHandHLYP45 and LC-wPBE,46,47 in TDDFT calculations for simulating optical absorption spectra. Solvent effect is included through the polarizable continuum model (PCM) of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF).48–50 The calculations described above are carried out using the Gaussian 09 software package.51 Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)52–55 was used to investigate the dye/TiO2 interface system. Generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) of pure DFT functional, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE),56 is used to account for exchange–correlation effects. Although GGA enables significant computational saving, it cannot properly account for band structure and electronic excitation due to the well-known self-interaction error of pure DFT functionals. A (TiO2)38 nanoparticle, obtained by appropriately cutting an anatase (101) slab, was used for the dye/TiO2 interface system. The chosen (TiO2)38 nanoparticle has been widely used to model the surface effects of bulk TiO2.19,57–59 The dye/TiO2 interface structure was optimized at a gamma k-point only with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. Vacuum layers (about 9 Å thick) were added to x, y, and z directions to avoid artificial interaction. The optimized interface geometries were used for subsequent single-point DFT calculations using the B3LYP functional, as performed with the Gaussian 09 software. The simulation of interface electron transfer was carried out using the quantum dynamics method, which is based on the extended Hückel (EH) tight binding Hamiltonian.84
3. Result and discussion
3.1 Isolated dyes
The ground state structures of BTP, BATP, and BMTP optimized at B3LYP/LanL2DZ level of theory are shown in Fig. 2. The main bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals are summarized in Table S1.† The accuracy of the predicted structural parameters has been tested with respect to the available experimental data. It is shown that for BMTP, there is a small error (not exceeding 5%) when using the B3LYP functional compared with the experimental crystal structure data.36 Comparison of the metal–ligand (Ru–N) bond lengths for BMTP to the corresponding bond lengths from the experimental crystal structure suggests a 4% error. Experimental crystal structure data for BTP and BATP are unavailable, but we assume that the errors are similar to the reference dye BMTP. Overall, B3LYP provides a reasonable description of the geometrical structures for all dyes.

It is interesting to examine the nature of the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) properties, since they play a crucial role in determining the charge-separated states of dye sensitizers. Fig. 3 presents the corresponding schematic FMO plots of the three dyes. In principle, HOMOs should be dominated by the electron donating moiety, while LUMOs should localize at the acceptor and anchoring groups to create an efficient intra-molecular charge separation. Inspection of the FMO plots suggests that for all dyes, the shapes of HOMOs are very similar; all HOMOs are almost delocalized on the tridentate tetrazolyl-pyridine moiety (hereinafter referred as tetrazolyl) and metal Ru center. The shapes of lower energy LUMOs and LUMO+1 are similar, mainly localized at the terpyridyl moiety, which acts as the electron acceptor and contains carboxylic acid groups. However, LUMO+1 of BMTP has fewer electrons in the carboxylic acid groups, and it is mainly located at terpyridyl part, compared with the other two dye complexes. Since the sensitizer can adsorb onto the TiO2 semiconductor through the anchoring carboxylic acid group, IET rate depends on electron coupling between dye excited states and 3d orbital of the TiO2 semiconductor. If the contributions from the carboxylic acid groups to the LUMOs are large, the IET rate is high. Therefore, we can foresee that BTP and BATP will have faster IET than BMTP. The negatively charged tetrazolyl unit is beneficial for IET; this is an important feature of efficient dyes for utilization in DSSCs.

In order to obtain high-efficiency dyes, there are additional factors that need to be considered, for example, a narrow band gap necessary for utilization of large portions of photon energy results in red-shifted and broadened absorption bands. Partial density of states (pDOS) and energy levels calculated by the B3LYP functional for all dyes are shown in Fig. 4. It is shown that negatively charged ligands lead to almost no change in LUMO energy levels, but HOMO energy levels are significantly destabilized. Generally, the introduction of tetrazolyl shifts HOMO energy levels up because the negatively charged ligands serve as strong electron donating groups, which can raise the metal d and d* levels due to interaction between π and σ electrons. The destabilization of HOMO levels results in the variation of HOMO–LUMO energy gap. The energy gaps increase as follows: BTP (3.22 eV) < BATP (3.45 eV) < BMTP (3.76 eV). As shown, BTP has the smallest HOMO–LUMO energy gap among the three dyes. The smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap favors a red-shifted absorption spectrum, which makes it a dye sensitizer suitable for sunlight harvesting. It is noteworthy that the experiment reported a fairly small difference in oxidation potential/redox potential (HOMO/LUMO) for BTP and BMTP.36 For example, the experiment suggests a 0.06 V difference in the oxidation potential and a 0.01 V difference in the redox potential between BTP and BMTP. However, our computation results show that HOMO downshifts by about 0.8 eV from BTP to BMTP, whereas LUMO remains almost unchanged. The practical synthesis conditions employed in the experiment may lead to the difference in HOMO/LUMO levels reported by experiment compared with those obtained from our calculation results.

The introduction of negatively charged ligands, serving as strong electron donating group, upshifts HOMO energy levels, whereas LUMO energy levels remain almost unchanged. The destabilization of HOMO levels results in the variation of HOMO–LUMO energy gap. 
It is well known that choice of the hybrid functional is crucial to accurately describe the absorption properties of dyes.60–63 Herein, different hybrid functionals, such as B3LYP, PBE0, BHandH, CAM-B3LYP, BHandHLYP and LC-wPBE, were used to simulate the absorption spectrum of BTP. The simulation results are shown in Fig. S1.† The lowest-lying excitation energies (λmax) are predicted to be about 584 nm by the PBE0 functional, which incorporates 25% Hartree–Fock exchange–correlation, and is in agreement with the experimental value of 575 nm. In addition, the PBE0 functional gives two other absorption peaks at about 423 and 384 nm, which are consistent with the experimental absorption bands observed at 482 and 379 nm. However, the B3LYP functional overestimates the lowest-lying excitation energies by about 40 nm with respect to the corresponding experimental value. Moreover, the other four functionals significantly underestimate the experimental λmax value by at least 100 nm. Overall, the PBE0 functional gives the best agreement with the experimental data; therefore, it is used as the TDDFT functional for further simulation of the absorption spectra.
As negatively charged ligands affect the FMO energy levels, we expect differences in absorption spectra of the dyes. The simulated absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding values are listed in Table 1. It is clear that all dyes exhibit absorption spectra with a similar profile that can be categorized into two major bands, one is stronger (in green color) and the other one is weaker (in yellow color), in the visible part of the solar spectrum. The absorption bands red-shift and oscillator strengths increase, as the formal charge of the ligand becomes more negative (see Table 1 and Fig. 4). This can be attributed to the decrease in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Specifically, the lowest energy excitations of the three dyes is centered at 584, 525 and 465 nm for BTP, BMTP and BATP, respectively, which can be assigned to a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character. This can also be verified from the charge density plots (Δρ) of S0–S1 in Fig. 5; as shown, the electron donating groups, i.e., the Ru center and tetrazolyl moiety, mainly localize in the decreasing electron density region, whereas the electron accepting group, i.e., terpyridyl moiety, mainly localizes in the increasing electron density region, which is indicative of an effective intra-molecular charge transfer when the lowest energy electronic transition initiates. As for the higher energy excitations in the stronger absorption band, BTP has three excitations appearing at this band with well-resolved absorption peaks at 434, 423, and 384 nm. The strongest absorption peak appears at 384 nm with oscillator strength of 0.1721, which results from HOMO → LUMO+2 transition, and the corresponding Δρ plot demonstrates that this transition also exhibits a MLCT character. In contrast, BATP and BMTP show lower and narrower absorption bands for the lower energy excitations. The excitations in the weaker band exhibit an MLCT character for BATP, but surprisingly, a ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) character for BMTP. The LLCT nature of this transition is associated with the electron increasing and decreasing regions formed close to each other, as shown in the Δρ plots.

The purple (blue) color indicates a decrease (increase) of electron density in a given molecular region. Δρ plot demonstrates that the most intense transition exhibits an MLCT character for BTP. BATP and BMTP show lower and narrower absorption bands for stronger absorption band. The excitation in this exhibits an MLCT character for BATP, but surprisingly, an LLCT character for BMTP.

Intra-molecular charge transfer is the initial step accompanied with photo-excitation after light harvesting. In order to quantify the extent of intra-molecular charge transfer, several charge transfer indexes, such as DCT, qCT, and t, are discussed in this study. The calculation of these indexes is completely generic and only depends on the charge density difference between the ground and excited states (Δρ), as already shown in Fig. 5. The formulation of the three parameters are well established and can be found in several previous studies.57,58,64–67 Specifically, DCT directly gives the effective charge transfer distance; qCT estimates the amount of charge transfer, and t characterizes the extent of charge separation. Larger t indicates more overlap between the electron density increment and depletion, which usually leads to incomplete charge separation. Table 1 explicitly lists the charge transfer indexes for all dyes. Here we just focus on the most intense excitation. DCT increases in the following order: BMTP (0.637 Å) < BATP (1.567 Å) < BTP (1.804 Å). qCT are roughly equal for BTP and BATP, while slightly larger for BMTP. BTP and BATP have similar t values, which are larger than that of BMTP. BTP shows a clear charge transfer character since it transfers the electron about 0.884e over 1.804 Å, presenting the largest degree of charge transfer. The less efficient charge transfer efficiency of BMTP originates from the LLCT character of its electronic transition, as discussed above.
Short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) is important to determine the overall performance of DSSCs. Generally, Jsc largely depends on light-harvesting ability, which is directly related to the optical absorption spectra. It is interesting to find a method that can quantitatively evaluate Jsc of different dyes with complicated absorption spectra, particularly for Ru-based complex dyes. The expression for Jsc is given as (1)here, φph.AM1.5G corresponds to the photon flux under AM1.5G solar irradiation spectra and LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency, which is given by LHE(λ) = 1 − 10−ε(λ)bc(2)here, ε(λ) is the molar absorption coefficient obtained from TDDFT calculation, b is the TiO2 film thickness and c is the dye concentration. For convenience, we take the experimental values, 10 μm and 300 mmol L−1 for b and c, respectively.68–70 The other three parameters entered in eqn (1) are the electron injection driving force Φinj, the dye regeneration efficiency ηreg, and the charge collection efficiency ηcoll. If we assume the three parameters to be invariant, all equal to 1 in calculation, the maximum Jsc can be obtained, and the value of Jsc can be matched with that of the experiment. Jsc is also an indication of the matching degree between the optical absorption spectra and sunlight irradiation. The simulated maximum Jsc together with light-harvesting efficiency LHE(λ) at a given wavelength λ and sunlight irradiation spectra are shown in Fig. 6. The calculated maximum Jsc values are about 5.67 and 13.28 mA cm−2 for BMTP and BTP, respectively, which agree well with the corresponding experimental values of 5.21 and 16.1 mA cm−2, respectively.36 The maximum Jsc increases in the following order, BMTP (5.67 mA cm−2) < BATP (9.43 mA cm−2) < BTP (13.28 mA cm−2), suggesting that the overlap between absorption spectra and light irradiation spectra increases in the same order. It is safe to say that the utilization of more negatively charged ligands should improve the light-harvesting ability and enhance the photocurrent performance. It should be noted that it would be good to estimate the maximum photocurrent density by simulating the absorption spectrum of a dye–TiO2 combined system; however, the TDDFT calculation of dye–(TiO2)38 system would require significantly large computational costs and is far beyond our capacity at present. Essentially, the band gap of (TiO2)38 cluster is about 3.83 eV (ref. 58) and cannot readily harvest light in the visible and near-infrared region of the solar spectrum. The impact of TiO2 cluster on the overall absorption spectrum of a dye/TiO2 system tends to be small, as shown experimentally. It is therefore reasonable to estimate the maximum photocurrent density of isolated dyes for interpreting the relative trend on photocurrent performance.

The calculated maximum Jsc values are about 5.67 and 13.28 mA cm−2 for BMTP and BTP, respectively, which agree well with the corresponding experimental values of 5.21 and 16.1 mA cm−2, respectively. The maximum Jsc increases in the following order, BMTP (5.67 mA cm−2) < BATP (9.43 mA cm−2) < BTP (13.28 mA cm−2), suggesting that overlap between absorption and light irradiation spectra decreases in the same order. 
3.2 Dye/TiO2 interface
In addition to the spectroscopic characterization described above, simulation of IET from dye to the TiO2 semiconductor is of paramount importance for understanding device performance. The IET should be fast to compete with other unfavorable processes to minimize charge and energy loss. Electronic coupling between dye excited states and TiO2 conduction band determines the IET rate, a factor directly influenced by atomistic details of the dye/TiO2 interface. In order to comprehensively understand interface interaction, we explicitly analyze the geometrical structures, electronic structures, and IET processes at the dye/TiO2 interface. We use the (TiO2)38 cluster for modeling the TiO2 surface effects, because it has the band gap comparable to the experimental value, and the considered cluster model provides a good balance between computational cost and realistic modeling. Upon adsorption of dyes to the TiO2 surface, carboxylic acid moiety acts as the anchor for robust adsorption. There exist multiple binding modes for dyes with carboxylic acid anchors, particularly in Ru-based complexes.71–77 We explicitly consider three feasible binding modes for this anchor with BTP as an example: mondentate bridging (mb) mode in which two carboxyl groups directly attach to two surface five-fold Ti5c atoms; bidentate bridging (bb) mode in which the two O atoms of the carboxylic group bind with two Ti5c atoms, and the hydroxyl group deprotonates and transfers the dissociated proton to the surface two-fold O2c atom; hydrogen bond (hb) mode in which carboxyl group binds to the Ti5c atom, and the proton of the hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond to the O2c atom with O–H distance of 1.6 Å. The stability of different adsorption modes are evaluated by computing the adsorption energy (Eads), Eads = Edye+TiO2 − Edye − ETiO2, where Edye+TiO2 denotes the total energy of the dye/TiO2 interface system. Edye and ETiO2 are the total energy of the isolated dye and TiO2 components, respectively. The optimized interface structure and adsorption energy are shown in Fig. S2.† It is shown that the hb mode produces the largest (most negative) energy, indicating that the hb is the most favorable adsorption mode. Previous theoretical work has also shown that the hb mode has high stability for the Ru complex dye similar to this work discussed.78 In this respect, the hb mode will be adopted as the adsorption mode for all dyes.
In order to understand the details of interface electronic structures and energy level alignment, the partial density of states (pDOS) of individual dye and TiO2 components after the formation of the hybrid interface are calculated and shown in Fig. 7. It is shown that all dyes show some similarities in the pDOS plot of the dye/TiO2 composites. The calculated band gap of the (TiO2)38 cluster is about 3.83 eV,58 which is reduced in the three dye/TiO2 interface systems. Therefore, band-gap narrowing occurs for the three dyes, which is favorable for visible-light sensitization. Fig. 7 also shows that the dye dominates the top of the valence band, whereas the TiO2 cluster governs the conduction band minimum. In addition, the dye adsorbate introduces electronic states near the bottom of the conduction band; the lowest electronic state is referred to as LUMO(ads) (pink regions in Fig. 7). The offset of LUMO(ads)/CBM characterizes the in-built potential for driving interface charge separation. The formed photo-generated electron–hole pair generally decouples; the electron is transferred to the TiO2 semiconductor and leaves the hole in the dye complex forming the oxidized dye. The successful separation of the electron and hole pair shows the potential application of dye/TiO2 composites for photovoltaic cells. The large in-built potential can efficiently drive the hole away from the dye/TiO2 interface and minimize unfavorable charge recombination, thus eventually boosting charge separation. It is shown that the BTP dye with the most negatively charged ligand has the largest in-built potential, indicating that the unitization of anionic ancillary ligands can optimize interface charge separation. This agrees with experimental investigation that the dye with anionic tetrazolyl-based ligand presents the high resistance towards the recombination of injected electron with oxidized dye.
 Fig. 7  Plots of partial density of states (pDOS) for BTP/TiO2, BATP/TiO2 and BMTP/TiO2 systems: dye contribution (red), TiO2 cluster contribution (black). The dye dominates the top of the valence band, whereas the TiO2 cluster governs the conduction band minimum. In addition, the dye adsorbate introduces electronic states near the bottom of the conduction band, with the lowest electronic states referred as LUMO(ads) (pink regions). The offset of LUMO(ads)/CBM characterizes the built-in potential for driving interface charge separation. The most negatively charged ligand has the largest in-built potential. 
In addition to charge separation, efficient charge injection is a critical factor for governing photovoltaic performance. Time-domain non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulation has demonstrated that the transfer of the photo-generated electron from molecular to wide band gap semiconductor takes place either non-adiabatically or adiabatically.79–83 Based on Fermi's golden rule, the large density of the acceptor states favors non-adiabatic electron transfer, which usually proceeds on an ultrafast time scale of few to tens of femtoseconds. The nucleus motion affects non-adiabatic coupling, which is responsible for driving electron transfer. The non-adiabatic coupling can be calculated numerically as the overlap of the electron donor and acceptor states. One can argue that the large overlap between the donor and acceptor wavefunctions indicates fast electron transfer. Fig. 8 presents the wavefunction plots of corresponding electron donor and acceptor states for the dye/TiO2 composites. It is shown that for all cases, the electron acceptor states are similar and entirely localized on the VB states of the TiO2 cluster, whereas electron donor states show differences for all dyes. Specifically, for BTP, the electron donor state is significantly delocalized from the dye into the TiO2 cluster, providing strong donor–acceptor coupling that is responsible for driving high electron transfer from dye to TiO2. For BATP, the electron donor state is delocalized between the dye and TiO2 to a small extent, whereas for BMTP, the electron donor orbital is confined within the dye complex, with the donor and acceptor states located separately on two components, suggesting weak donor–acceptor coupling. Therefore, we can foresee that BTP will exhibit the fastest electron transfer due to the significant wavefunction overlap and strong donor–acceptor coupling, whereas the localized wavefunction in BMTP weakens donor–acceptor coupling, leading to the slow electron transfer. These results agree with the idea that the introduction of negatively charged ligands enhances the electron-donating ability, improving the coupling between dye excited state and 3d states of TiO2 semiconductor.

BTP will exhibit the fastest electron transfer process due to the significant wavefunction overlap and strong donor–acceptor coupling, whereas the localized wavefunction in BMTP weakens donor–acceptor coupling, leading to slow electron transfer. 
Deep understanding of the electron transfer requires state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulation, which is computationally more expensive than the standard electronic structure calculations. Herein, we used the quantum dynamics method developed by Rego and Batista.84–89 The time-evolution electronic wave packet was propagated based upon the tight-binding EH Hamiltonian. Nuclear dynamics is not considered because of the significantly large computational cost. In addition, for ultrafast electron transfer, neglecting nuclear dynamics is acceptable.89 This quantum dynamics method has been widely used to investigate photo-induced electron transfer across molecule/semiconductor interfaces, achieving good results and providing critical insights into electron transfer mechanism.10,84,89–94Fig. 9 presents the selected unoccupied molecular orbitals responsible for visible light sensitization obtained using DFT and EH calculations. These orbitals are used as the electron initial states for subsequent IET simulations. The EH orbitals are matched with the Kohn–Sham (KS) orbitals by visual inspection. Results of IET are shown in Fig. 10. Population is the time-dependent survival probability that the electron still resides in the dye molecule at time t. Exponential or linear fitting of the IET curve gives the characteristic time t, as shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that IET results clearly depend on the choice of electron initial states. For BTP, the lowest energy band of the absorption spectrum is the band that corresponds to the excitations into LUMO. The excitation exhibits a photoactive MLCT character, as pointed out in the spectral analysis section. In addition, the lower energy LUMO resides in at the bottom of the conduction band and only couples weakly with the electron acceptor state since the density of TiO2 states is low. The characteristic timescale for IET induced by LUMO initial state is about 750 fs. It should be noted that the MLCT character persists for about 100 fs. IET should be fast to compete with other radiative or nonradiative relaxation process such as intersystem crossing (ISC), which usually occurs on a fast timescale (∼100 fs).90,95 In this respect, electron transfer starting from LUMO is less efficient. Our results are also consistent with a recent finding that the lower energy orbital leads to slower IET.90 Moreover, LUMO can hardly be involved in photo excitation, as revealed by the negligible intensity of the weaker absorption band in the absorption spectrum; therefore, the impact of LUMO on IET tends to be small. In contrast, LUMO+2 dominates the major absorption band and exhibits ultrafast electron transfer, with a timescale less than ∼100 fs, which is sufficiently fast to minimize ISC and avoid charge and energy loss. The faster electron transfer observed for LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 is because they are situated at higher energy states and hence have more TiO2 electronic states available to couple. The dependence of electron transfer on initial state has indeed been observed in a previous theoretical study.84 We limit our discussion on IET starting from the states contributing to the major absorption band. For BATP, decay of the electron initial states takes about 0.11 ps, whereas IET is significantly slow in BMTP, about 130.58 ps. This is due to weaker coupling between dye excited state and 3d states of TiO2 semiconductor, as discussed above. The faster ET observed for the dye with anionic ligand is also consistent with experimental transient absorption spectroscopy study.

 Fig. 10  Survival probability curves for electron injection starting from the adsorbate orbitals. IET results obviously depend on the choice of electron initial states. The electron transfer starting from LUMO is not sufficiently fast to compete with other unfavorable processes. BTP shows faster IET rate due to significant orbital coupling. 
4. Conclusion
In this study, we present a systematic theoretical study on the impact of anionic ligands in Ru complex dyes on the performance of DSSCs. The geometrical structures, electronic structures, absorption spectra, and IET are discussed in detail. Our results show that the introduction of negatively charged ligands enhances electron donating ability, destabilizes the HOMO energy level, and thereby decreases the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. This contributes to better light-harvesting properties and improved photocurrent performance. Moreover, the charged ligands affect orbital distribution and directly modulate electron coupling between dye excited states and TiO2 CB states, possibly affecting IET. Turning attention to the dye/TiO2 interface interaction, the results show that anionic ligands increase the built-in potential, improving interface charge separation and inhibiting unfavorable charge recombination. Moreover, addition of more negatively charged ligands increases donor–acceptor coupling. Quantum dynamics simulation of IET suggests that electron transfer largely depends on the choice of the electron initial state and lower energy orbitals bring about inefficient electron transfer due to the competition of ISC. Higher energy orbitals have the IET timescale less than ∼100 fs, which is sufficiently fast to avoid ISC into the low-lying excited state. IET speeds up as the number of anionic ligands increases, for instance, BTP exhibited electron transfer at an ultrafast time scale, while electron transfer in BMTP took significantly longer (more than 100 ps). Overall, our simulations results agree with experiment, highlighting the important role of negatively charged ligands. We expect that the current preliminary work will provide useful theoretical insights into the experimental design of anionic ligand based Ru complex dyes for DSSCs applications.

 	Fig. 1  Structures of the investigated dyes in which the formal charge of the ancillary ligand is −2 (BTP), −1 (BATP), and 0 (BMTP), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  The optimized ground state structures of BTP, BATP and BMTP. The B3LYP/LanL2DZ level of theory predicts structural parameters consistent with the experimental crystal structure data.	 

 	Fig. 3  Plots of the frontier molecular orbitals relevant to the absorption of BTP, BATP and BMTP.	 

 	Fig. 4  Partial density of states (pDOS) and energy levels of corresponding molecular orbitals of BTP, BATP and BMTP. The introduction of negatively charged ligands, serving as strong electron donating group, upshifts HOMO energy levels, whereas LUMO energy levels remain almost unchanged. The destabilization of HOMO levels results in the variation of HOMO–LUMO energy gap.	 

 	Fig. 5  Calculated absorption spectra for dyes dissolved in DMF solution at the PCM/TD-PBE0/Lanl2DZ level of theory and the charge density difference plots (Δρ). The purple (blue) color indicates a decrease (increase) of electron density in a given molecular region. Δρ plot demonstrates that the most intense transition exhibits an MLCT character for BTP. BATP and BMTP show lower and narrower absorption bands for stronger absorption band. The excitation in this exhibits an MLCT character for BATP, but surprisingly, an LLCT character for BMTP.

 	Fig. 6  Simulated maximum Jsc (in mA cm−2) and light-harvesting efficiency LHE(λ) at different wavelength λ and sunlight irradiation spectra. The calculated maximum Jsc values are about 5.67 and 13.28 mA cm−2 for BMTP and BTP, respectively, which agree well with the corresponding experimental values of 5.21 and 16.1 mA cm−2, respectively. The maximum Jsc increases in the following order, BMTP (5.67 mA cm−2) < BATP (9.43 mA cm−2) < BTP (13.28 mA cm−2), suggesting that overlap between absorption and light irradiation spectra decreases in the same order.	 

 	Fig. 7  Plots of partial density of states (pDOS) for BTP/TiO2, BATP/TiO2 and BMTP/TiO2 systems: dye contribution (red), TiO2 cluster contribution (black). The dye dominates the top of the valence band, whereas the TiO2 cluster governs the conduction band minimum. In addition, the dye adsorbate introduces electronic states near the bottom of the conduction band, with the lowest electronic states referred as LUMO(ads) (pink regions). The offset of LUMO(ads)/CBM characterizes the built-in potential for driving interface charge separation. The most negatively charged ligand has the largest in-built potential.	 

 	Fig. 8  Electron donor and acceptor orbitals for the dye/TiO2 combined systems. The electron acceptor states are similar and entirely localized on the VB states of the TiO2 cluster, and the electron donor states are different for different dyes. BTP will exhibit the fastest electron transfer process due to the significant wavefunction overlap and strong donor–acceptor coupling, whereas the localized wavefunction in BMTP weakens donor–acceptor coupling, leading to slow electron transfer.	 

 	Fig. 9  Example of matched orbitals for visible light sensitization. The EH orbitals are matched with the Kohn–Sham (KS) orbitals by visual inspection. These orbitals are used as the electron initial states for subsequent IET simulations.	 

 	Fig. 10  Survival probability curves for electron injection starting from the adsorbate orbitals. IET results obviously depend on the choice of electron initial states. The electron transfer starting from LUMO is not sufficiently fast to compete with other unfavorable processes. BTP shows faster IET rate due to significant orbital coupling.
