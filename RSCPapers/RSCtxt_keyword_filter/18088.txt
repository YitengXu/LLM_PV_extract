    , Accepted 12th January 2016First published on 13th January 2016AbstractA high open-circuit voltage inverted perovskite solar cell based on a CH3NH3PbBr3 absorber and ICBA acceptor is reported. The CH3NH3PbBr3 film fabricated under ambient atmosphere at a moderate temperature (∼100 °C) using a two-step spin-coating method is composed of aggregated nano-grains. Upon solvent annealing of the CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA film, the efficiency of the resulting cell increases from 1.71% to 7.50% with a remarkably high open circuit voltage (Voc) of ca. 1.60 V. ICBA acts not only as a high LUMO acceptor to realize high Voc but also as a mending agent to increase the efficiency of the cell by penetrating into the defects/voids of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film via solvent annealing as evidenced by TRPL, XPS and SEM data. Solvent annealing of the active layer was proved to be simple and effective device engineering to improve the efficiency of the perovskite cell based on a low quality film and the Voc of the inverted perovskite cell can be tuned by the LUMO level of the acceptor were revealed. The CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA film is semi-transparent with an average 50% transmittance under visible light. The moderatetemperature processed CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cell with high Voc and a semi-transparent absorber has great potential for application as the top cell in a tandem solar cell.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have attracted immense attention over the last several years as perovskite based solar cells have shown great promise for achieving high-efficiency at low-cost.1–13 Devices based on CH3NH3PbBr3 with high LUMO (−3.4 eV) and deep HOMO (−5.6 eV) levels14 can achieve high Voc and be semi-transparent. Therefore the CH3NH3PbBr3 based cell is a suitable candidate to be used as a top cell of all tandem solar cells. Qiu15et al. applied CH3NH3PbBr3 in a regular mesoscopic (mp) TiO2 solar cell, using a poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis-(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-di-hydropyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPP) hole transport layer to achieve the Voc of 1.16 V with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.04%. Instead of using a mesoscopic TiO2 anode, Edri16et al. used a mesoporous alumina (on dense (d) TiO2) anode and N,N′-dialkyl perylenediimide (PDI) hole transport material to enhance the Voc to 1.3 V, however, the efficiency of the cell is only 0.56%. Seok17et al. have reported the fabrication of regular d-TiO2/mp-TiO2/MAPbBr3/PIF8-TAA cells and the highest Voc and efficiency of the devices are 1.4 V and 6.7%, respectively. Very recently Heo18et al. used a similar regular cell architecture, fabrication procedure and components as those used by Seok17 except added HBr(aq) in the MAPbBr3 precursor solution. The resulting cell has the highest efficiency of 10.4% with very high Voc of 1.51 V.
Regular (DSC-type) perovskite solar cells based on the MAPbBr3 absorber have been proved to realize high Voc.15–19 However the architectures of the reported high Voc CH3NH3PbBr3 cells are all using a mesoscopic or a dense planer TiO2 film as an anode. The mesoporous or high quality dense TiO2 film used in the high efficiency devices often requires high-temperature (above 450 °C) treatment. Such severe fabrication conditions could limit the future development of perovskite solar cells, particularly in the flexible or tandem cells. Furthermore, Snaith20et al. found that the light-induced desorption of the surface-adsorbed oxygen could be the critical reason for the instability of the mesoporous TiO2-based solar cells. On the other hand, the inverted cell (perovskite acts as an absorber and hole transporter) can be fabricated at low temperature and no metal oxide charge transporter is needed. Furthermore, the theoretical (maximum) Voc of the mesoscopic (or regular) solar cells is the energy difference between the Fermi level of the electron transporter and the HOMO of the donor.21 Therefore, the theoretic Voc for a mesoscopic (or regular) perovskite solar cell based on the CH3NH3PbBr3 (with a HOMO level at ∼−5.6 eV vs. vacuum) absorber and a TiO2 (quasi Fermi energy level ∼−4.0 eV vs. vacuum) electron transporter is 1.6 V. Whereas in an ideal case without any energy loss at all interfaces of the device, the theoretical Voc for the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 cell is close to the band gap of the absorber, i.e., 2.2 eV. Even considering the Shockley–Queisser limit proposed by Shockley22et al., Voc higher than 1.6 V for a single p–i–n junction CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cell is achievable. It provides a great possibility to fabricate solar cells with high open-circuit voltage. The inverted structure also has the advantages of simple structure and fabrication at low temperature, hence can be a good architecture for further technology development, such as roll-to-roll production or tandem cell. Furthermore, a high quality absorber film is essential for achieving a high efficiency perovskite solar cell. Nevertheless, there may be some difficulties in the fabrication of a high quality CH3NH3PbBr3 film using a simple and reproducible method. In this study, we demonstrated a new method to improve the photovoltaic performance of the cell based on a low quality CH3NH3PbBr3 film simply by solvent annealing of the perovskite/acceptor layer.
2. Results and discussion
Preparation and properties of CH3NH3PbBr3 film on PEDOT:PSS
The process for fabricating the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cell is illustrated in Fig. 1 and the detailed preparation procedures and materials used can be found in the Experimental section. The layout of the device is the general architecture of the inverted perovskite solar cell:23 CH3NH3PbBr3 acts as an absorber as well as a hole transporter and a fullerene derivative functions as an acceptor. Spin coating used for preparing perovskite films in this paper is a well-known technique to deposit a thin film on a substrate. Both one-step and two-step methods were used in this study to prepare CH3NH3PbBr3 and the SEM images of the resulting film are displayed in Fig. 2. It was shown that only isolated grains were formed on the PEDOT:PSS surface when the one-step method is used, as CH3NH3PbBr3 crystallizes very fast. It seems that to prepare a good quality CH3NH3PbBr3 film with a one-step method, more creative strategies need to be found. On the other hand the two-step spin coating method can grow a full-coverage CH3NH3PbBr3 film on the PEDOT:PSS surface although it is not a very smooth film. In a two-step method, PbBr2 has less ionic characteristic (compared to CH3NH3PbBr3) therefore a better quality film can be first spin-coated on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS. CH3NH3PbBr3 was then formed by intercalating MABr into PbBr2 at the second step. The deposition and intercalation of the PbBr2 film is not sensitive to H2O therefore the preparation of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film can be carried-out under ambient atmosphere at moderate temperature (∼100 °C). However, the two-step spin-coating method although can grow a full-coverage CH3NH3PbBr3 film on the PEDOT:PSS surface, the quality of the resulting film (displayed in the middle of Fig. 2) is still not good enough to achieve high photovoltaic performance. SEM images (displayed on the left side of Fig. 2) show that the PbBr2 film deposited on PEDOT:PSS contains lots of holes. It could be one of the reasons that the quality of the corresponding CH3NH3PbBr3 film is not so good. It seems that to fabricate a high quality CH3NH3PbBr3 film via a two-step method for the inverted perovskite solar cell is not as easy as fabricating a high quality CH3NH3PbI3 film.26

To prepare a highly pure, flat and full covered CH3NH3PbBr3 film using the two-step spin coating method, several parameters need to be considered. Not only the concentration and amount of the two precursor solutions but also the design of the spin coater and spin programs will affect the quality of the resulting film. For example for the same PbBr2 film, the concentration and amount of the MABr/IPA solution will affect the reaction time (the reaction time is the time required to evaporate all the solvent molecules of the solution under a very fast spin) and therefore the morphology and stoichiometry of the resulting perovskite film. Lots of parameters were tried in this study and the parameters to prepare the best quality CH3NH3PbBr3 film are: 50 μl, 0.5 M PbBr2/DMF precursor solution under a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s and 30 μl, 15 mg mL−1 MABr/IPA under a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s in a 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate. To avoid a interminable description of the experimental results, for each experimental condition, only the cells with the highest efficiency are shown in this paper. Nevertheless, to demonstrate the process of searching for the best quality CH3NH3PbBr3 film, the effects of MABr/IPA concentration on the properties of the resulting CH3NH3PbBr3 film and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding inverted cell are discussed.
The phase, crystallinity, purity and surface morphology of CH3NH3PbBr3 films prepared using various concentrations of MABr/IPA solutions were investigated with X-ray diffraction, EDS analysis and SEM imaging. The XRD patterns of the films are illustrated in Fig. 3 and the original 2D diffraction data are displayed in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The pure CH3NH3PbBr3 phase (showed only six sharp diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ of 14.57°, 20.83°, 29.80°, 33.35°, 37.9°, 42.78°, and 45.56°, corresponding to (1 0 1), (1 2 1), (0 4 0), (1 4 1), (2 4 2), and (0 6 0) planes respectively16,24) can be obtained by using a suitable concentration of the MABr/IPA solution in the second step. When insufficient MABr/IPA was used, some unreacted PbBr2 phase was detected in the GIXRD (Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction) pattern. When the concentration of MABr/IPA is too high, although no additional diffraction peak is found, extra MABr or its decomposed bromide will exist as an impurity in the film, as revealed with SEM-EDS data: The Br/Pb ratio of the resulting film is higher than 3 when 20 mg MABr mL−1 IPA was used. On the other hand, the Pb:Br atomic ratio for the pure phase films (prepared from 15 mg MABr mL−1 IPA solution) is 1:3 and no other halide was detected (the original EDS data are displayed in Fig. S2, ESI†). XRD and EDS data suggest that a highly pure CH3NH3PbBr3 film can be made by using suitable fabrication conditions in a two-step method. Furthermore the SEM images (illustrated in Fig. S3, ESI†) reveal that the pure CH3NH3PbBr3 film is fully covered on the substrate, nevertheless films with unreacted PbBr2 or with extra bromides all have poorer morphology containing more defects/holes.

The photovoltaic performance of the inverted cell based on CH3NH3PbBr3 and the device engineering to improve the cell performance
PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) having high electron mobility25 and suitable band structure was generally used as an acceptor in organic photovoltaics and inverted perovskite solar cells. The LUMO level of PCBM is compatible with that of CH3NH3PbBr3 (which has LUMO level 0.5 eV higher than that for PCBM, see Fig. 4) for efficient electron injection. As expected the device based on a CH3NH3PbBr3 donor and a PCBM acceptor exhibits the Voc of 1.38 V (see Table 1) which is higher than that of the inverted CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells using the same acceptor.6,23,27–30 However the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is very low (less than 1%) with very small Jsc and FF. The low FF value is probably because the CH3NH3PbBr3 film is formed by the aggregated nano-grains and not a smooth, continuous film as the SEM images shown in Fig. 2. The film containing a lot of small holes and grain boundaries thus has high inter-particle resistance. The low Jsc is not only due to the poor quality of the film but also the large band gap of CH3NH3PbBr3 which cannot absorb the sun light efficiently. If the quality of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film is hard to improve further, device engineering could be an alternative way to improve the photovoltaic performance of the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 cell.

If the holes and grain boundaries of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film are the reasons for the poor photovoltaic performance, they may be mended by filling the voids with an acceptor. When the active CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBM film is solvent annealed (the detailed description of the solvent annealing is described in the Experimental section) for 24 hours before depositing the Ca/Al electrode, the PCE of the resulting cell increases from 0.86% to 5.6% with significant enhancement in both Jsc and FF values. Solvent annealing of the active film may allow PCBM molecules to penetrate slowly into the inside (not just the surface) holes or grain boundaries of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film to mend the defects by forming a pseudobulk-heterojunction structure, therefore improve the performance of the cell. The function of the solvent annealing will be discussed more in detail in the later paragraphs. Even with solvent annealing of the active layer, the efficiency of the device is also sensitive to the purity of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film. As the photovoltaic data listed in Table 1, cells based on CH3NH3PbBr3 containing unreacted PbBr2 (prepared with low MABr/IPA concentration) or extra bromides (prepared with high MABr/IPA concentration) all result in low efficiency of the corresponding cell (the I–V curves of the cell based on CH3NH3PbBr3 prepared from three different MABr/IPA concentrations are displayed in Fig. S4, ESI†).
The frontier orbital energy level illustrated in Fig. 4 and the good photovoltaic performance of the inverted ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Ca/Al cell26 suggest that a large driving force is not necessary for injecting the excited electron from the perovskite absorber to the PCBM acceptor since the LUMO levels for MAPbI3 and PCBM are very close. Data in Fig. 4 also show that the LUMO level17 of CH3NH3PbBr3 is ca. 0.5 V higher than that of CH3NH3PbI3. Therefore an acceptor with the LUMO level higher (up to 0.5 eV) than PCBM could be applied in the CH3NH3PbBr3 based device to increase the Voc of the cell. ICBA (1′,1′′,4′,4′′-tetrahydro-di[1,4]methanonaphthaleno[1,2:2′,3′,56,60:2′′,3′′][5,6] fullerene-C60), another derivative of the fullerene family31 commonly used in OPV, with LUMO level ca. 0.2 eV higher than that of PCBM was chosen as an example to demonstrate the concept. The photovoltaic parameters of the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 cell based on an ICBA acceptor with and without solvent annealing of the active layer are also listed in Table 1. Without solvent annealing, the photovoltaic parameters of the cell using ICBA as an electron transporter are all larger than those for the devices using a PCBM acceptor. It is due to that the viscosity of the ICBA/chlorobenzene (CB) solution is lower than that of the PCBM/CB solution. Therefore during the spin coating process, more ICBA (compared to PCBM) molecules diffuse into the inside voids of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film. Remarkably, the device achieves a Voc of 1.60 V which is the highest Voc for all single junction solar cells reported in the newest Solar Cell Efficiency Tables (version 46).32 Upon solvent annealing of the active layer, the efficiency of the cell increases from 1.71% to 7.5% with significant enhancement in both Jsc and FF values but maintains the same Voc, just like the cell based on the PCBM acceptor. Interestingly, the Voc enhancement (0.22 = 1.60–1.38 (V)) of using ICBA to replace PCBM as an acceptor is close to the difference (0.2 V) of the LUMO energy levels between PCBM and ICBA. The results further supported that the driving force needed for the efficient charge separation between CH3NH3PbBr3 and the acceptor could be very small. In this sense, ICBA may not be the best acceptor (or the optimal acceptor) for the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cell to achieve the high Voc. An inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cell with Voc higher than 1.6 V is possible if a highly conducting acceptor with the LUMO level higher than ICBA can be found. The IPCE curve of the champion inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 cell is shown in Fig. 5(a). The curve shows a strong spectral response at the wavelength from 375 nm to 525 nm (with the highest efficiency close to 70% at 375 nm) and then drops quickly to zero at the wavelength of 550 nm, consistent with the absorption profile of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film (illustrated in Fig. 5(b)) and the semi-transparent yellow-colored ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3 film (revealed in Fig. S5, ESI†). Compared to the absorption spectrum of the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal,33 the slope of the Urbach tail of our sample is smaller, indicating smaller crystalline domain size.

The Voc is quite reproducible for the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 cell using ICBA as an acceptor. The Voc statistics based on 29 cells (displayed in Fig. S6, ESI†) clearly showed that high Voc is a general property of the inverted cell based on the CH3NH3PbBr3 donor and ICBA acceptor. Moreover, the photographs displayed in Fig. S5, ESI† also reveal that the CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA film is more transparent compared to CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBM and its transparency is similar to that of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film due to the low absorption characteristic of ICBA. Weak absorption under visible light is another advantage of the ICBA acceptor, since in a perovskite solar cell, the perovskite film plays a key role in the light absorption and hole transport, while the acceptor functions mainly as an electron transporter without contributing to the short circuit current (Jsc) of the cell. ICBA with low absorption and high LUMO level can enhance the Voc of the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA cell and still retain the translucent nature of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film. A semi-transparent photovoltaic device with high Voc has great potential for application as the top cell in a tandem solar cell.
The function of the solvent annealing of the active layer: mending the defects of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film and forming a pseudo-heterojunction structure by penetrating the acceptor into the perovskite film
A high quality absorber is essential for achieving a high efficiency perovskite solar cell. CH3NH3PbBr3 is an ionic coordination solid state material, the vacancy or grain boundary of the film can be regarded as the defect site which may hinder the carrier transport or quench the carriers and excitons.34 Snaith et al. had used organic iodide35 or pyridine36 to passivate the perovskite film to improve the photovoltaic performance of the cell. Zhang et al. used organic silane37 as a passivation agent for the perovskite film and showed the improvement in efficiency and water resistance of the device. In the previous paragraphs we had shown that the inverted cell based on aggregated CH3NH3PbBr3 nano-grains has very low efficiency. However, when the active (donor/acceptor) layer was solvent annealed for 24 hours at room temperature, the performance of the cells enhanced tremendously, especially in Jsc and FF. We have proposed that the enhancement in the photovoltaic performance is due to some acceptor molecules penetrate into the holes/grain boundaries of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film to form a pseudobulk-heterojunction structure as illustrated in Fig. 6. It can also be regarded as the defects of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film which were mended by the acceptor molecules. The merit of using an acceptor as a mending/passivating agent is that no extra layer of organic compound is used. Organic compounds generally have low conductivity, and an extra layer of an organic compound may increase the series resistance of the cell, decreasing the efficiency. No extra passivation agent used also simplifies the fabrication procedure, and reduces the cost of the cell.
 Fig. 6  Penetration of ICBA molecules into the voids/grain boundaries of the MAPbBr3 film upon solvent annealing. 
In order to obtain the evidence regarding the penetration of the acceptor, PL spectra of PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3 and PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA with or without solvent annealing were recorded and are presented in Fig. 7. As expected, the PL intensity (Fig. 7(a)) of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film decreases by adding PCBM or ICBA. Nevertheless without solvent annealing only 50% and 60% of PL was quenched by PCBM and ICBA, respectively. When the donor/acceptor layer was solvent annealed for 24 hours, 88% and 93% of PL was quenched by PCBM and ICBA, respectively. To further address the exciton dynamics at the interface between the CH3NH3PbBr3 and the acceptor (ICBA), time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra of glass/CH3NH3PbBr3, glass/CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA with and without solvent annealing were recorded and presented in Fig. 7(b). The PL quenching after solvent annealing (see Fig. 7(a)) indicates that the excitons were efficiently dissociated at the interface between the CH3NH3PbBr3 and the ICBA when the solvent annealing process was used to improve the contact interface between the CH3NH3PbBr3 and ICBA. TR-PL reflects the exciton dynamics in the CH3NH3PbBr3 film. Two types of quenching processes: the non-radiative lifetime (τNR) and radiative lifetime (τR) of excitons in the CH3NH3PbBr3 film can be resolved by fitting the normalized time-dependent photoluminescence using a 2-constant exponential decay function as follows38 and the fitting results are listed in Table S1, ESI.†IPL = ANR exp(−t/τNR) + AR exp(−t/τR)where ANR is the normalized amplitude of non-radiative exciton annihilation, AR is the normalized amplitude of radiative excitons, τNR is the lifetime for the non-radiative exciton annihilation, and τR is the radiative exciton lifetime. The black curve in Fig. 7(b) shows the average excitonic dynamics of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film (bulk and top surface). The residual exciton dynamics (red curve in Fig. 7(b)) indicates that the charge transfer radius (depletion region)39 at the interface between CH3NH3PbBr3 and ICBA is shorter than the thickness of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film. The radiative exciton lifetime (non-radiative exciton lifetime) is extended from 4.66 ns (2.05 ns) to 8.83 ns (2.73 ns) when ICBA is added on the top of CH3NH3PbBr3 without solvent annealing. It suggests that the defects on the top surface of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film are reduced by contact with ICBA. When the solvent annealing process is performed, the exciton lifetime decreased from 8.83 ns to 1.32 ns, which originates from the accelerated exciton dissociation40 at the interface between CH3NH3PbBr3 and ICBA. It means that the contact interface between CH3NH3PbBr3 and ICBA was improved by the solvent annealing process. In other words, the ICBA penetrates into the interstices of the CH3NH3PbBr3 thin film to form a pseudobulk-heterojunction CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA film. Long term solvent annealing at low temperature does allow acceptor molecules to penetrate gradually into the vacancies and grain boundaries of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film to mend the defects of the film to improve the Jsc and FF of the cell.

Another evidence for the penetration of ICBA into the CH3NH3PbBr3 film was from the cross section SEM images of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA films with and without solvent annealing as displayed in Fig. 8. The thickness of CH3NH3PbBr3 films estimated from the image is ca. 400 nm which is close to that measured with the surface profile meter. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA film without solvent annealing is very fragile, it falls apart (some small orifices are marked with the red circle in the image) when broken in-half for cross section viewing. On the other hand, the film is robust after solvent annealing: it remains intact when broken in-half. The SEM data supported that some holes in the CH3NH3PbBr3 film were filled with ICBA via long-time solvent annealing. Unfortunately the resolution of the SEM-EDS is not high enough to distinguish ICBA from CH3NH3PbBr3 and the film is so flat that the distribution of ICBA in CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA cannot be revealed. Nevertheless solvent annealing of the pure CH3NH3PbBr3 film by chlorobenzene did not change the crystalline domain size and crystallinity of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film as probed with XRD. Therefore the efficiency of the corresponding inverted cell is within the experimental uncertainty. The significant improvement in efficiency upon solvent annealing is not due to the change of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film.
 Fig. 8  Cross section SEM images of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA films with and without solvent annealing. 
To obtain direct evidence for the penetration of acceptor molecules, XPS depth profile analysis was performed on the CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBM film (PCBM containing O atoms which CH3NH3PbBr3 did not have) with and without solvent annealing. Four elements (Pb, Br, C and O) were probed and the distribution of the O atom was extracted from the results and displayed in Fig. 9 (the distributions of all 4 elements in the two samples are illustrated in Fig. S7, ESI†). On the surface of the active film, the oxygen content of the annealed sample is smaller than that for the non-annealed one since some PCBM molecules already permeated inside the CH3NH3PbBr3 film. Starting from the second layer the solvent annealed film has larger oxygen content compared to the film without solvent annealing. Depth profile XPS data provide direct evidence that more acceptor molecules penetrate inside the CH3NH3PbBr3 film upon solvent annealing of the active layer.

Current hysteresis and long-term stability of the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cell
Photocurrent hysteresis at various photovoltaic measuring conditions has been observed in some perovskite solar cells. It is an indication of poor quality/structural defects of the perovskite absorber, poor device interphase and the imbalance between the hole and electron transport in the device.41,42 The efficiency for a cell with hysteresis may not truly represent the photovoltaic performance of the device. The I–V curves for our champion inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 cell exhibits no current hysteresis at (two) scan directions but slight hysteresis was observed at various scan rates although it is very limited (see Fig. S7, ESI†). The photovoltaic performance of the cells was improved by solvent annealing of the active film to form a pseudobulk-heterojunction structure. However, ICBA molecules may not be able to fill all holes/grain boundaries especially the side close to the substrate. In other words the defects of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film cannot be passivated entirely by solvent annealing. More creative synthetic strategies need to be developed to prepare a better quality CH3NH3PbBr3 film to increase the cell efficiency and reduce the current hysteresis totally. Furthermore, the inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cell is stable under an inert atmosphere, and without packing the device retains 90% of its initial efficiency after storing in a glove box for 5 days but is not stable in ambient environment, as the efficiency decreases 50% after standing in air for 30 hours (see Fig. 10).

3. Conclusion
We report an inverted perovskite solar cell based on a semi-transparent CH3NH3PbBr3 film fabricated under ambient atmosphere at moderate temperature (∼100 °C). An inverted CH3NH3PbBr3 cell using ICBA as an acceptor achieves a remarkably high Voc of 1.61 V which is the highest value among all reported perovskite solar cells. Solvent annealing of the active layer at room temperature has proved to be an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance of the cell based on the imperfect CH3NH3PbBr3 film. The penetration of the acceptor molecules into perovskite to form a pseudobulk-heterojunction structure and mend the defects of the CH3NH3PbBr3 film was evidenced by PL, TRPL spectra, SEM images and depth profile XPS data. The merit of using an acceptor as a mending agent is that no extra material is used, which can simplify the fabrication procedure and reduce the cost for mass production. Furthermore, the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/ICBA film is very transparent under visible light. Low-temperature processed CH3NH3PbBr3 solar cells with high Voc and a semi-transparent absorber can be applied as the top cell for the tandem solar cell.
4. Experimental section
Materials and physicochemical studies
Aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS (1.3–1.7 wt%, from H.C. Stark Baytron P AI 4083) was obtained from Heraeus Co. Fullerene derivatives (PC71BM (99.58%) and ICBA (99.5%)) was purchased from Solenne B. V., Netherlands. PbBr2 (99.999%) was obtained from Aldrich. All the above materials were used as received. ITO-covered glass substrates purchased from Ruilong Co., Taiwan were photolithographically patterned in our laboratory with HCl(aq). CH3NH3Br (MABr) was synthesized as reported previously.34 Uv/Vis absorption and PL spectra were recorded with Hitachi U-4100 and F-7000 spectrometers, respectively. The thickness of the films was measured with a depth-profile meter (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). Five lines on the 1 cm × 1 cm film were made by carefully scratching with a tip and the average height between the hills and valleys was used to represent the film thickness. GIXRD data were collected in the 2θ range of 10–50 degrees on a Bruker powder diffractometer (D8 Discover) using Cu Kα1 radiation equipped with a 2D detector. Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) were performed with a Hitachi S-800 microscopy at 15 KV. Samples (film on substrates) for SEM imaging and EDS study were mounted on a metal stub with a piece of conducting tape and then coated with a thin layer of gold film to avoid charging. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra were recorded by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique (UniRAM, Protrustech) along with the instrument response function of 200 ps and the excitation wavelength (repetition rate) was 405 nm (20 MHz).40 To prevent laser-induced thermal effects, the diameter of the spot size on the sample was increased to 50 μm and the excitation power was reduced to 0.1 mW. Depth profile X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer PHI-590AM XPS/ESCA spectrometer system with a Cylindrical Mirror Electron (CMA) energy analyser. The X-ray sources were Al Kα at 600 W and Mg Kα at 400 W. XPS were obtained at pass energies of 160 eV and 10 eV for survey scans and high-resolution scans, respectively. The sputtering time for each layer is 200 seconds.
Device fabrication and photovoltaic parameter measurements
The procedure for fabricating the solar cells reported in this paper is very similar to that for preparing CH3NH3PbI3 based devices we reported previously.26 PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on a heat pretreated patterned ITO under 5000 rpm for 50 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. To deposit the perovskite layer, first a layer of PbBr2 was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrate from 0.5 M DMF solution using a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 seconds. And then CH3NH3Br (MABr) was spin-coated on top of the PbBr2 film from its isopropanol solution (with various concentrations, volumes and spin programs) to form a CH3NH3PbBr3 structure. Specifically, the highest efficiency device was fabricated with a concentration of CH3NH3Br/isopropanol (IPA) ca. 15 mg mL−1 (30 μl) at a spin rate of 2000 rpm for 30 s in a 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm substrate. After the CH3NH3PbBr3 film was formed, 24 wt% PCBM (or ICBA) in chlorobenzene was spin-coated onto the surface of the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm, 30 s to be an acceptor layer. All the fabrication procedures were carried out under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Solvent annealing of the active (donor/acceptor) layer was carried out by covering the PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBM (or ICBA) film with a petri dish for 24 hours in a glove box before the film was sent into the vacuum evaporator for depositing an electrode. Finally the PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/PCBM (or ICBA) film was transferred to a vacuum chamber to coat the Ca/Al (20 nm/100 nm) electrode using thermal evaporation. The device area is 0.5 cm × 0.2 cm. I–V curves of the cells were obtained using a Keithley 4200 source measuring unit under a simulated AM1.5G sun light (Wacom solar simulator) at 100 mW cm−2 and the light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. External quantum efficiency (EQE) or incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air when the device was sealed with a three-bond sealer and measured right after taking out of the glove box. A chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for the phase sensitive detection with a QE-R3011 measurement system (Enlitech Co., Taiwan). The cell for the stability test outside the glove box was fabricated using the same procedures except Ag, instead of Ca/Al, was used as an electrode.
