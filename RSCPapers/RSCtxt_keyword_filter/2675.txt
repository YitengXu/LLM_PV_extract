Introduction
Converting solar energy into electricity is generally regarded as the most prospective methodology to solve the energy crisis of the world, owing to its huge reserves, inexhaustibility and pollution-free character. Since the invention of the inorganic silicon p–n junction cell, there have been rapid advances in the efficiency and reliability of the solar cells, and the emerging photovoltaic industry has been growing rapidly.1,2 Nevertheless, the price of solar power from the inorganic silicon substantially exceeds that from the electrical grid, which prohibited its large-scale application and replacement of the traditional fossil power. There has been a continuous interest in search for novel types of low-cost solar cells to replace inorganic silicon. Excitonic solar cells manufactured from organic optoelectronic materials such as pure-organic3 or organic–inorganic heterojunction solar cells,4 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)5 have received surging academic and industrial attention as potential candidates for the future photovoltaic market. Apart from the latent low cost, organic solar cells allow the fabrication of foldable and flexible large area devices.6 Recently, the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells have made significant progress, which is challenging the traditional silicon solar cells.7
The triarylamine unit is well-known for its ease in oxidation of the nitrogen center and the ability to transport charge carriers via the radical cation species with high stability.8 It is widely investigated and applied in various electro-optical materials such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),9 organic field-effect transistors,10 non-linear materials,11 and xerography.12 In recent years, it was found that the excellent photoelectric function of triarylamine was desirable for organic sensitizers, and a substantial number of dyes with triarylamine as electron donor were developed for organic solar cells.13 In this Feature Article, the recent development of the organic photovoltaic materials based on triarylamine as well as new synthetic methods and the application of starburst triarylamine as host emitting material will be described.
Brief introduction to DSCs
Among numerous organic photovoltaic devices, dye sensitized solar cells have been a subject of a great deal of interest for its simple preparation process, low cost and high efficiency of converting solar energy into electricity.14,15 Due to their huge interfacial area and high electron collection efficiency, the highest energy conversion efficiencies of DSCs were over 11%.16 The general configuration of DSCs is shown in Fig. 1, which consists of four main components: an optically transparent electrode; sensitizers adsorbed on mesoporous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide; an inorganic liquid electrolyte or solid organic hole-transporter; and a counter electrode.7b In DSCs, sensitizing molecules first absorb light, accompanied by the excitation of electrons to the excited states. The excited electrons subsequently transfer to the conduction band of TiO2, and then transport to the anode by electron diffusion through the disordered network of TiO2nanoparticles. The oxidized dye molecules are regenerated by the iodide redox couple or hole-transporter with the positive charge being transported from the electrolyte to the platinum counter electrode.7b Sensitizers are critical to the performance of DSCs. Generally, sensitizers are required to have an adsorption group, suitable energy level, broad absorption in solar spectra and high molar extinction coefficient.

Metal-free organic DSCs have received more and more attention for their variety, high molar extinction coefficients, simple preparation process, and low cost in comparison to Ru complexes.14a,17 Organic dipolar compounds are usually composed by an electron donor (D), π-conjugation linker (L), and an electron acceptor (A), which can act also as an anchoring group to the semiconductor surface. Electron transfer from the donor to acceptor happens rapidly upon photo-excitation to generate a charge-separated species, and then the negative charge located on the acceptor is injected into the semiconductor.18
Triarylamine was first used as an electron donor for metal-free organic sensitizers because of its excellent electron-donating capability and aggregation resistant nonplanar molecular configuration. Aggregation can lead to self-quenching, instability of the sensitizer, and reduce the electron injection efficiency, resulting in low power conversion efficiency of the DSCs. Employing triarylamine as electron donor, sensitizers with various conjugating units and acceptors were investigated (1–13) (Fig. 2, Table 1). Yanagida et al. explored the vinyl group as the conjugating linker (1, 2).19 The highest energy conversion efficiency of 5.3% was obtained for sensitizer 2. Sun and co-workers reported a triarylamine based sensitizer with thiophene as linker (3) and cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor, and obtained a power conversion efficiency of 5.1% in comparison to 6.1% of N719.20 We investigated a sensitizer with isophorone as bridge (4), which showed photon to electron conversion efficiency of 5.77% under 100 mW cm−2xenon lamp irradiation.21 Chen and co-workers introduced rhodanine-3-acetic acid as an electron acceptor22 and the DSC based on 5 showed an overall conversion efficiency of 5.84% under AM 1.5 irradiation. A quasi-solid-state DSC22c with polymer gel electrolyte based on sensitizer 5 exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 5.76% at a light intensity of 30 mW cm−2. Hagfeldt, Sun and co-workers exploited sensitizer 6 with thiophene as linker and rhodanine-3-acetic acid as acceptor, achieving an energy conversion efficiency of 2.3%.23a Recently, Albinsson and co-workers studied the effect of different anchor groups on the electron collection efficiency.23b With cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor, electrons can be injected farther into the TiO2 than rhodanine-3-acetic acid, which can prevent the charge recombination of the injected electrons more effectively. Sensitizers with fluorene and thiophene as conjugating bridges (7–9) were reported by Lin and co-workers.24 The power conversion efficiency of dye 7 was close to the Ru dye and the photocurrent was even higher than for N719. Overall, due to the excellent electron-donating capability and nonplanar molecular configuration of the triarylamine donor unit, these sensitizers show good energy conversion efficiency. However, restricted by the relative narrow power conversion spectra and low photovoltage, the power conversion efficiencies are not prominently high.

        Ko and co-workers introduced a novel type of triarylamine donor group with fluorenes.25 The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of dyes 10 and 11 exhibit a strikingly high plateau at 91% between 400–600 nm. The power conversion efficiency is 8.01% for a DSC based on sensitizer 11. Furthermore, sensitizer 11 exhibits conversion efficiency of 5.8% with ionic liquid-based electrolytes, and the performance can be essentially sustained under light soaking at 60 °C for 1200 h. Recently, organic dye sensitizers (12, 13) with the same donor were developed by Grätzel and co-workers.26 With a solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte, the conversion efficiency of sensitizer 12 reaches 7% and the performance is highly stable under extended solar irradiation. The excellent stability of the triarylamine in opto-electronic conversion and its aggregation resistant character re-emphasized the reliability of the metal-free organic sensitizer. For the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SSDSCs), with 2,2′,7,7,′-tetrakis(N,N-dimethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) hole conductor as redox couple, dye 13 gives short circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 9.06 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 860 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.61, resulting in an impressive efficiency of 4.8%, which is comparable with the highest efficiency of Ru dyes.27 The excellent performance of the triarylamine based sensitizers for SSDSCs should be partially ascribed to their good electron transport capability, facilitating the interaction with the organic hole transporter on the interface.
In order to broaden the absorption spectra of the sensitizers in the visible and near-IR region, one strategy is to introduce more conjugate bridges between the donor and acceptor (14–22) (Fig. 3, Table 2). Sun and co-workers demonstrated that upon extension of the π-conjugation (14, 15), the bandgap of the dye was tuned and absorption spectrum was bathochromically shifted, however, at the expense of the IPCE and Voc.28 It was suggested that the recombination of electrons to the triiodide and intermolecular aggregation were aggravated in the sensitizer with longer linker, which reduced the energy conversion efficiency dramatically. Other conjugate linkers such as fluorene, thiophene, vinyl, benzene and pyrrole units (16–22) were adopted to extend the absorption spectra in the same manner.23,24,29,30 Nevertheless, the conversion efficiencies for sensitizers with extended conjugating linkers showed pronounced loss of conversion efficiency.

Another strategy to expand absorption spectra in the solar irradiation region is to introduce additional electron acceptors on the spacer group (23–29) (Fig. 4, Table 3), without extension of the molecular length. Lin et al. developed a new class of triarylamine dyes featuring donor–acceptor architecture that incorporates the electron-deficient bridge benzothiadiazole, leading to push–pull–pull architecture (23).31 Unexpectedly, although the power conversion region was effectively broadened, the overall energy conversion efficiency was not enhanced noticeably. Afterward, they reported another type of sensitizer where the electron-donating arylamine and electron-accepting 2-cyanoacrylic acid were bridged by cyanovinyl containing conjugated spacers (24–27).32 Though the electronic absorption was improved at longer wavelengths, DSCs based on these compounds exhibited limited efficiencies ranging from 3.48–4.92%, lower than their congeners without cyano units on the linker. DFT calculations revealed that the negative charge was focused at the internal acceptor and hampered the charge transfer from the donor to the terminal acceptor and TiO2 semiconductor. Another example is sensitizer 28 with two cyano units on the phenyl linker.33 Recently, Akkaya et al. synthesized a new BODIPY type panchromatic sensitizer 29, with distyryl-substituted boradiazaindacene as the linker, the maximum absorption wavelength reached 700 nm.34 However, there is still much more room for improvement in the IPCE and overall photon-to-electron conversion efficiency.

In general, by extending the linker length or adding an acceptor moiety, the absorption spectra can be broadened, however, the efficiencies are usually reduced. We speculate that incorporating more electron donor units on the sensitizer may be a better choice to broaden the absorption spectra. We designed and synthesized a novel type of starburst triarylamine based sensitizers (30–32) with D–D–π–A configuration by adding electron donor groups on the outside of triarylamine (Fig. 5, Table 4).21 Starburst triarylamine based sensitizer 32 exhibits higher conversion efficiency than the corresponding triarylamine donor sensitizer 4. However, for sensitizers 30 and 31, the conversion efficiencies were relatively low, which may be ascribed to the ineffective dye regeneration caused by the small offset between the oxidation potential of the electrolyte and sensitizer. Another potential factor accounting for the lower efficiencies is the more severe intramolecular vibration, leading to more energy loss and the lower electron injection efficiency. Analogously, D–D–π–A structure sensitizers 33 and 34 with alkoxy donor units on triarylamine were explored. The absorption spectrum of sensitizer 33 was bathochromically shifted and the conversion efficiency was enhanced compared to the congener without methoxy substituents (Fig. 5. Table 4).35,36 The performance of the solar cells based on dye 34 was highly stable under extended irradiation, indicating for the first time that the stability of organic sensitizers can be as stable as the typical Ru dyes. The SSDSC employing sensitizer 34 adsorbed on 1.7 μm thickness film exhibited an overall energy conversion efficiency of 4.44% under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions. Chou and co-workers developed a type of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene bridged sensitizer 35 with additional electron donoralkoxy groups substituted on the thiophene linker.37 The absorption spectrum was also extended and solar cell based on 35 showed a power conversion efficiency of 7.3%, compared to 5.2% for sensitizer without alkoxyl substituents. With the same type of alkoxyl substituted triarylamine as electron donor, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and thienothiophene bridged sensitizers (36, 37) were synthesized by Wang and co-workers.38 The absorption spectra were expanded further by the simultaneous substitution of alkoxy donor units on both the linker and triarylamine. High efficiencies of 9.8 and 8.1% measured under AM1.5G sunlight were reached for sensitizer 36 with a volatile acetonitrile electrolyte and a solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte, respectively. In addition, the performance of the solvent-free DSCs was demonstrated to be highly stable under extended solar irradiation. Likewise, first sensitizers with furan or selenophene as bridges (38, 39)39 were designed. These dyes showed 6.88–7.77 and 6.39–7.00% efficiencies for liquid electrolyte and solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte, respectively, exhibiting superior performance over the thiophene counterparts.

The photocurrent of metal-free organic dyes now exceeds that of Ru dyes,23,40,41 however, the overall power conversion efficiency is still less. The essential factors that impede the further improvement of the metal-free organic sensitizers are their relative lower Voc and ff values. Generally, the Voc of the DSCs depends on the conduction band edge of TiO2 and the redox potential of the redox couple. However, charge recombination processes of the injected electrons with I3− ions in the electrolyte and with dye cations lead to a measured Voc much lower than the theoretical value.42 The former is considered to be particularly critical for Voc and ff values. Ko and co-workers tried to retard the charge recombination by linking several long alkyl chains on the thiophene linkers in 40 and 41 (Fig. 6, Table 5).43a The electron lifetime and photovoltage were enhanced because of the introduction of hexyl groups. The energy conversion efficiency of sensitizer 41 is 8.64%. In our work, the photovoltage of sensitizer 32 (Fig. 5) with starburst triarylamine as electron donor was found to be higher than 4 with triphenylamine as donor.21 For most rod-shaped sensitizers, as can be seen in Fig. 7(a), triiodide can easily penetrate through the interspaces between chromophores to approach the semiconductor surface, resulting in serious charge recombination.44 However, for starburst shaped triarylamine based sensitizer, as shown in Fig. 8, the outer phenyl units of triarylamine can form a more compact sensitizer layer on the TiO2 surface to block the approach of the redox couple species (triiodide) to the semiconductor surface. As a result, charge recombination was decreased and photovoltage was enhanced. Furthermore, close π–π aggregation between molecules can be suppressed by the nonplanar starburst sensitizer structure as well.45 The enhancement of Voc with starburst molecular configuration was also observed by the groups of Sun and Lin. For starburst triarylamine based sensitizers 42 and 43 (Fig. 6, Table 5), Voc was increased phenomenally compared with the triarylamine counterpart.35 Transient photovoltage attenuation experiments revealed the starburst triarylamine sensitizer had a longer electron lifetime, implying the charge recombination was effectively decreased. 43-sensitized solar cells yielded an overall conversion efficiency of 7.20% under standard AM 1.5 sunlight, almost comparable to the conversion efficiency of N719. Lin et al. also designed and synthesized sensitizers (44–46) employing starburst 2,3-di(triphenylamine)-substituted thiophene as donor (Fig. 6, Table 5), the Voc was enhanced enormously as well.46 However, the Voc was decreased with the extension of the π-conjugation linker. It can be envisioned that upon extension of the bridge length between the donor and acceptor, the outer phenyl units of the starburst triarylamine can no longer form a compact blocking layer, resulting in a higher dark current and lower Voc.

Despite the fact that charge recombination can be retarded by starburst triarylamine, the Voc is still not strikingly high.21,35,43 In order to further prohibit the approach of the triiodide to the TiO2 surface, we designed and synthesized a starburst triarylamine based sensitizer with several long alkyl chains attached to the linker (47–49) (Fig. 6, Table 5).47 As depicted in Fig. 7(c), sensitizers are provided with cone-shaped structure after the addition of long alkyl substituents on the middle of the starburst shaped sensitizer. The interspaces are filled with the flexible alkyl chains, forming a more compact sensitizer blocking wall on the TiO2 surface. Charge recombination between the injected electron and triiodide is more effectively prohibited, accounting for longer transient photovoltage decay time and smaller dark current. Tremendously improved Voc was observed for cone-shaped dye 48- and 49-sensitized solar cells, with comparable or higher Voc and ff values than N719 under the same conditions. Moreover, virtually no noticeable absorption extension was detected after the sensitizer was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, showing that the undesirable intermolecular aggregation was further decreased by the cone-shaped structure. The monochromatic IPCE of the sensitizer 48 was close to 90%. Despite the relative narrow conversion spectra, the highest power conversion efficiency of 4.27% was attained for sensitizer 48. The energy conversion efficiency is likely to be enhanced by extending the absorption spectra on the TiO2 surface by molecular modification.
Recently, the effect of the intramolecular charge transfer and energy transfer on the performance of the solar cells based on starburst triarylamine sensitizers was investigated.48 It was suggested that the intramolecular energy transfer process possibly contributed to the increase of the light harvesting efficiency of the dye, and the intramolecular charge transfer process aided to increase Voc by suppressing the dark current in the DSC. Methyl groups were introduced on triarylamine by Yang and co-workers to enhance the molecular rigidity and reduce the vibration induced non-irradiation decay.49 Sensitizers with starburst triarylamine N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenylbenzidine (TPD) as donor and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as linker showed the highest conversion efficiency of 5.63%.
Hyperbranched conjugated polyelectrolytes based on triarylamine were applied as sensitizer for DSCs by Taranekar et al. (Fig. 9).50Polymer 51 was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface by the sulfonate groups, leading to superior performance relative to 50. Bilayer devices were self-assembled by soaking in solutions of the corresponding oppositely charged polymers in sequence. The bilayer devices attained higher power conversion efficiency due to the increased chromophore density in comparison with the single layer device. The bilayer device where 51 was initially adsorbed on the TiO2 showed better performance.

Brief summary and principle for molecular design of metal-free organic DSCs
Based on the above discussion, it can be seen that the power conversion efficiency of triarylamine based organic dyes has been enhanced by leaps and bounds in recent years. Various superior properties of the triarylamine donor are responsible for the improvement. First, the sensitizer aggregation can be reduced by triarylamine, facilitating ultrafast interfacial electron injection from the excited dye molecules to the TiO2 conduction band. Secondly, the recombination of injected electrons with the redox couple can be suppressed due to the blocking effect of the propeller-shaped molecular structure. In addition, the oxidized triphenylamine unit is spatially conveniently placed for the approach of the redox couple species, ensuring fast dye regeneration. Finally, the reliability of metal-free sensitizer was reinforced by the excellent stability of triarylamine. In spite of the significant improvement of metal-free organic sensitizers, more effort still needs to be made in order to further promote the power conversion efficiency. Several aspects need to be taken into consideration in the molecular design of metal-free organic sensitizers. First, the conjugation length between the donor and acceptor should not be too extended, and it is better for the acceptor unit to be the terminal group and directly connected to the TiO2 surface.17e Multiple electron donor substituents are encouraged in order to broaden the power conversion spectra under the condition that the oxidation potential offset between the sensitizer and redox couple remains large enough. Moreover, nonplanar starburst-shaped or cone-shaped molecular structures are good candidates to prohibit intermolecular aggregation and achieve high Voc. Meanwhile, a certain degree of molecular rigidity should be maintained to prohibit the undesirable energy loss by intramolecular vibration.
Recently, we investigated the relationship between the fluorescence intensity and DSC electron injection efficiency of a series of Ir complex sensitizers.51 It is found that the maximum electron injection efficiency was consistent with high luminescence quantum yield under the condition that close π–π aggregation was largely inhibited. This finding provides a simple guide for the search of sensitizers with high power conversion efficiency. With the improvement of the molecular design, the performance of the metal-free organic sensitizers is likely to be further reinforced and meet the requirement of photovoltaic market.

        Ru
        dyes incorporating triarylamine units for SSDSCs
Up to now, Ru complex dyes have been the most successful sensitizers for DSCs.5 Much effort was expended to optimize the performance of Ru dyes.15,52 Recently, one type of ruthenium dyes (52, 53) with starburst triarylamine substituents were developed by Thelakkat and co-workers and applied in SSDSCs (Fig. 10, Table 6).53 It was found that these dyes displayed remarkably high efficiencies of 3.4 and 1.5% compared with N719 dye (0.7%). The spectacular performance of both 52 and 53 was ascribed to integrated reasons: First, the higher absorption arising from extended conjugation leads to efficient light harvesting and a higher Jsc. Second, the increased spatial separation of the electrons injected into TiO2 and the dye cation center reduces charge recombination between them. Third, the outer triarylamine helps to isolate the solid electrolyte from the TiO2 surface and the charge-recombination dynamics of injected electrons with solid electrolyte is reduced. Furthermore, the starburst triarylamine units in the dyes can act as a transition layer to guarantee a polarity match between the relatively nonpolar Spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporter and highly polar Ru dye, thus improving the interfacial wetting and contact. Finally, the donor antenna groups can induce secondary electron-transfer cascades across the interface between the dye and the Spiro-OMeTAD compound and reinforce the sensitizer regeneration.54,55

Recently, it was reported that by spin coating a layer of starburst triphenylamine based complex on the Ru dye-adsorbed TiO2 film to retard the charge recombination between the injected electrons and redox couple, the Voc and energy conversion efficiency were enhanced as well.56
Triarylamine in heterojunction solar cells
Since the seminal work of Tang, organic heterojunction solar cells have received great attention for their low cost, simple fabrication process and flexibility, and their efficiency has undergone a gradual evolution in the last 20 years.57,58 Intensive research effort has been invested in the understanding and technological optimization of multilayer heterojunction photovoltaic cells that are based on small molecules, which now reach power conversion efficiency of 5.6% with tandem or dual dye-doped structure.59 The excellent electron donating as well as hole transporting capability of triarylamine make it a good candidate to be applied in multilayer heterojunction solar cells. Roncali and co-workers synthesized a novel type of star-shaped molecules based on a triphenylamine core derivatized with various combinations of thienylenevinylene conjugated branches and electron-withdrawing dicyanovinyl groups (54–57) (Fig. 11, Table 7).60 Prototype bilayer heterojunction solar cells have been fabricated using C60 derivatives as acceptor material. The maximum external quantum efficiency exceeds 30% and incident power conversion efficiency spectra cover nearly the whole visible region. Bilayer heterojunction solar cells based on sensitizer 57 showed power conversion efficiency of 1.20% under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. Wong and co-workers reported the synthesis and characterization of the triarylamine and the dicyanovinyl asymmetrically disubstituted oligothiophenes as organic dyes (58–60) for heterojunction solar cells with a narrow HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Fig. 11, Table 7).61 Preliminary studies of bilayer heterojunction photovoltaic cells with these dyes as donor material and C60 as acceptor material showed energy conversion efficiency of 2.7%, suggesting that triarylamine–thiophene based materials are promising candidates for multilayer heteroinjection solar cells.

Starburst-shaped triarylamine based dyes are not only appropriate for multilayer heterojunction solar cells, but also for bulk-heterojunction solar cells.62 Li and co-workers designed a new solution processable star-shaped triarylamine based dye 62 (Fig. 11, Table 7), which showed a broad and strong absorption band in the visible light region, low band gap, high hole mobility and good film-forming properties.62a Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated with 62 or 61 as p-type material. The power conversion efficiency based on a blend of 62 and PCBM (1 : 3, w/w) reached 1.33% under AM 1.5 illumination.
Triarylamine-based dyes for p-type DSCs
Hagfeldt and co-workers developed a novel type of p-type DSCs by exploring the passive cathode in n-type DSCs. The energy conversion efficiency was expected to be enhanced by combining the p- and n-type DSCs to construct tandem solar cells.63 In recently years, the energy conversion efficiency of p-type DSCs was significantly enhanced by the introduction of triarylamine based sensitizers.64 p-Type DSCs based on sensitizer 63 (Fig. 12) with NiO photocathodes and a passive anode showed a Jsc value of 1.52 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 0.11 V, and an ff of 0.31, leading to an efficiency of 0.05%. The maximum IPCE reached as high as 18%.64a Lately, the IPCE was doubled by the increase of the thickness of NiO film and the utilization of acetonitrile as electrolyte solution. Using phenyl as the linker, the electron will delocalize over more phenylamine units, which can retard the charge recombination on the NiO surface and lead to higher energy conversion efficiency than counterparts with a thiophene linker.64b The overall energy conversion efficiency was 0.09% with sensitizer 64.

Triarylamines as host emitters in OLEDs
In recent years, non-doped electroluminescent materials have aroused great interest for their simple fabrication process by vacuum-deposition as pure films and their potential to enhance the stability of devices.65 The performance of host emitters have been improved enormously recently, which is comparable with the best performance of the doped fluorophores. Chen and co-workers synthesized a novel red fluorophore 65 based on triarylamine and fumaronitrile, which shows the maximum brightness of 10034 cd m−2 (Fig. 13, Table 8).66 Recently, they designed a novel type of high efficiency red fluorophore 66 based on triarylamine and spirobifluorenes (Fig. 13, Table 8).67 Because of excellent nonplanar configuration, fluorescence quenching of 66 was effectively decreased in the solid state. The highest luminescence intensity is 12410 cd m−2. Some host blue emitters (67, 68) based on triarylamine and spirobifluorenes were also developed by Chen and co-workers (Fig. 13, Table 8).68 Fluorophore 67 shows little electric-field-induced fluorescence quenching in the solid state, making it one of the highest efficiency fluorophores among all electrofluorescent blue emitters (Fig. 13, Table 8). Lin et al. explored triarylamine based hole transporting emitter 69, exhibiting the highest luminescence intensity of 16420 cd m−2 (Fig. 13, Table 8).69a Bipolar fluorophore 70 was also developed by Lin and co-workers. The highest luminescence intensity of a single layer device with compound 70 as a bipolar fluorophore was as high as 9878 cd m−2.69b

We synthesized a series of starburst triarylamine based fluorophores, which showed high fluorescent emission in the solid state (71–75) (Fig. 14).70 By varying the substituents, the emission of the molecules can be tuned from cyan into the deep red region. The cyclic voltammetry plot of 73 showed three redox couples corresponding to the redox of the three triphenylamine units, indicative of its excellent hole-transporting property. Incorporating compounds 72 and 75 as non-doped host red emitters, devices without a hole-transporting layer showed better performance than one with additional pure hole-transporter. The electroluminescence emission maximum reached 724 nm for 72.

‘Click’ synthesis of starburst triphenylamines
In search of efficient synthesis for starburst triarylamine, we are attracted to ‘click chemistry’, especially the Cu(I)-catalyzed regiospecific formation of 1,2,3-triazoles from azides and terminal acetylenes.71 We synthesized the starburst triphenylamine by ‘click coupling’ of 4-azido-N,N-diphenylbenzenamine and tris(4-ethynylphenyl)amine (Fig. 15).72 The synthetic strategy is straightforward and benefits from high yield and facile purification without tedious silica gel chromatography, which opens a new way for the facile synthesis of starburst triarylamines. In addition, some suitable co-sensitizers might be linked independently by ‘click’ reaction. Tang and co-workers also developed a novel type of hyperbranched triphenylamine based polymer 77 by click synthesis (Fig. 16).73

Conclusion
The application of the triarylamine based dyes for organic solar cells as well as their novel utilization as hole-transporting fluorophores are reviewed in this Feature Article. For metal-free organic sensitizers based on triarylamine, the power conversion efficiency is enhanced by its nonplanar propeller molecular geometry, which prohibits undesirable close molecular aggregation and charge recombination. The performance of the cells has been improved still further by modification on the starburst triarylamine donor based sensitizers. Moreover, the excellent stability of triarylamine contributes to the cell durability. For SSDSCs, the cell performance has been reinforced by the triarylamine donor since it can electrically interact well with the organic hole-transporting layer. Heterojunction solar cells based on triarylamine sensitizers show good performance due to the excellent electron donating and transporting capabilities as well as aggregation inhibition character of triarylamine. The introduction of triarylamine units has significantly facilitated the development of organic solar cells. However, due to its relative small π-conjugated and non-planar structure the introduction of triarylamine units for red-shifting (longer wavelength absorption) in the molecular design remains a challenge. On the other hand, fluorophores based on triarylamine were found to be promising host emitting materials for OLEDs. Moreover, this Feature Article demonstrates the new synthetic methods and application of starburst triarylamines as hole-transporting emitters in OLEDs.
