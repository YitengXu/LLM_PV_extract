    , Accepted 13th March 2017First published on 16th March 2017AbstractTwo twisted terrylene diimides (TDIs), namely TDI2 and BTDI3, have been designed and synthesized. In comparison to monomeric TDI, their molecular geometries and optoelectronic properties have been systematically investigated. BTDI3, with a highly twisted 3D geometry, shows the best light-absorbing capability in the range of 500–700 nm and a suitable LUMO level. Simultaneously, a preliminary exploration of their photovoltaic performances was carried out. The optimized device based on PBDT-TS1/BTDI3 produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.64%, demonstrating the potential of terrylene dyes in the photovoltaics field.
Rylene diimides, made up of oligo(peri-naphthalene)s and two imide rings, have attracted significant attention for many years due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and exceptional chemical and thermal stabilities.1 Among them, naphthalene diimides (NDIs) and perylene diimides (PDIs) have been the most investigated representatives and widely applied in various optoelectronic devices such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and sensors over the past few decades.2 Nevertheless, the applications of higher rylenes like terrylene diimides (TDIs) and quaterrylene diimides (QDIs) are still in their infancy probably because of their chemical inaccessibility and poor solubility with the extension of π-conjugated systems.
In comparison to NDIs and PDIs, TDIs exhibit particular properties, including bathochromic and enhanced absorption spectra, as well as strong π–π stacking, which favors charge-carrier transport. TDIs were first synthesized in 1997, and since then, their synthetic routes have been constantly optimized.3 Until now, a series of TDI molecules functionalized at imide positions have been achieved with high overall yields, thus opening up the possibility of extensive application in multifarious fields. Owing to their attractive properties, such as high extinction coefficients, excellent fluorescence quantum yields and remarkable photochemical stabilities, TDI derivatives have been successfully used in plenty of single-molecule spectroscopy experiments and membrane labeling processes.4 In addition, they are also applied to OFETs mainly because of their conjugated π-electronic systems, and large electron affinities in combination with high charge carrier mobilities.5
In the past few years, tremendous progress of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (SMAs) has been witnessed in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) attributed to their readily available source materials, easily tuned spectral coverage and energy levels, as well as excellent ambient stability compared to fullerene derivatives.6 Among the various classes of non-fullerene SMAs, PDI derivatives have been widely investigated which exhibit outstanding performances.7 However, as higher homologues of PDIs, TDIs have been ignored with respect to their photovoltaic applications since their first synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one report about TDI-based OSCs with extremely low PCE values (≪1%).8 Consequently, the rational design of high-performance TDI based SMAs is still a great challenge.
We are particularly enthusiastic about exploring splendid PDI based SMAs. In our previous work, we reported a series of bay-linked PDIs with and without heteroatoms, as well as a class of molecules with 3D architectures consisting of three PDI units, which were demonstrated as high-performance acceptors.9 Inspired by our design strategy, herein, we developed two twisted TDI derivatives, namely TDI2 with two TDI subunits directly linked by a single-bond and BTDI3 with three TDI arms attached to a central benzene. The monomeric TDI with the same alkyl chains, namely TDI, was synthesized as a comparison. Their molecular geometries, optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performances have been systematically studied and compared. Besides, a commercially available polymer, PBDT-TS1 was selected as the donor for preliminary investigation.10 A significantly improved PCE of 3.64% was achieved for PBDT-TS1/BTDI3 based devices without any post-treatment. This is the first report on twisted TDI derivatives as electron acceptors in OSCs.
The synthetic routes to TDI2 and BTDI3 are shown in Scheme 1. TDI was synthesized by using known procedures according to the literature.11 In addition, it should be noted that, the key building block 1 was obtained for the first time in moderate yields through bromination of TDI in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C. In particular, monobrominated TDI renders precise control of constructing oligomeric TDI derivatives owing to the single functional group in the bay region. Undoubtedly, it is a fascinating and promising precursor for the construction of various molecular scaffoldings. Subsequently, treatment of compound 1via homocoupling under facile conditions with a Pd2(dba)3/Zn system, directly afforded the target product TDI2 while BTDI3 was achieved by a mild Suzuki coupling reaction between 1 and 1,3,5-benzenetriboronic acid tris(pinacol) ester with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in a moderate yield of 68%. These TDI compounds have good solubility in common organic solvents like chloroform and chlorobenzene and have been characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) as shown in the ESI.† Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under argon indicates that all the three molecules have excellent thermal stability (Fig. S1†), and the decomposition temperatures for 5% weight loss are 404 °C, 400 °C and 392 °C for TDI, TDI2 and BTDI3, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves show that TDI is more easily crystallized than the other two molecules due to its planar molecular structure (Fig. S2†).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to TDI2 and BTDI3. 
The geometries of the three compounds were optimized by using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.12 In order to simplify the calculation, methyl was used to replace the long branched alkyl chain as portrayed in Fig. 1. Undoubtedly, TDI exhibits a highly planar skeleton conformation, while TDI2 and BTDI3 are more twisted. The dihedral angle between two TDI units is 50° in TDI2 due to the steric hindrance. Moreover, in BTDI3, quite large twisting angles (83°, 65°, 55°) between three TDI units are observed. From the structural point of view, the highly twisted 3D geometry possibly reduces molecular aggregation and facilitates the formation of a three-dimensional charge-transporting network.

Room temperature UV-vis absorption spectra of the three molecules in CHCl3 solution are presented in Fig. 2a. TDI and BTDI3 have similar and much narrowed absorption spectra in solution, while the extinction coefficient of BTDI3 with the maximum at 658 nm (ε = 249500 M−1 cm−1) is much higher than that of TDI with the maximum at 652 nm (ε = 165300 M−1 cm−1), due to more chromophores in BTDI3 than those in TDI. The similarity could be easily comprehended from the structural point of view, which is caused by the isolation of three TDI subunits by benzene in BTDI3. In contrast, TDI2 displays relatively broader absorption bands in the range of 500–750 nm with a red-shifted shoulder peak at 695 nm, which is significantly different from those of monomer TDI and trimer BTDI3. The red-shifted and broad spectrum of TDI2 is likely owing to more extended π-electron delocalization by directly linking the two subunits, in combination with different exciton couplings based on various reciprocal orientations of the two TDI units. The absorption coefficients of their films were also measured (Fig. S3a†). The redshift values, compared to the maximum absorption in films with those in solution, are 17 nm, 8 nm and 11 nm for TDI, TDI2 and BTDI3, respectively, demonstrating the weak aggregation and slight molecular self-organization in the solid state (Table S1†). In addition, it should be noted that, BTDI3 shows the best light-absorbing capability in films, which is of benefit to higher short circuit-current density (JSC) in photovoltaic devices. As illustrated in Fig. S3,† relatively wide absorption spectra from 450 nm to 800 nm are observed for PBDT-TS1/acceptor blend films.
 Fig. 2  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra in CHCl3 solution (1 × 10−5 mol L−1) and (b) cyclic voltammograms in CH2Cl2 solution of TDI, TDI2, and BTDI3. 
The electrochemical properties of the three molecules were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 solution and in films (Fig. 2b and S4†). TDI and BTDI3 show similar electrochemical properties (one reversible reduction wave and one reversible oxidation wave), because benzene causes separation of the three TDI subunits in BTDI3. However, two well-defined reduction waves and two oxidation waves are detected for TDI2, which is due to the electron communication between the two TDI subunits. The LUMO values, estimated from the onset of the first reduction peaks in films, are −3.79 eV, −3.94 eV and −3.88 eV for TDI, TDI2 and BTDI3, respectively. The lower LUMO energy indicates that TDI2 has a higher electron-affinity. Referring to the HOMO value of donor material PBDT-TS1 (−5.33 eV) (Fig. S6†), the open-circuit voltage (VOC) values are well explained and TDI based devices have the highest VOC. The HOMO energies of TDI (−5.55 eV), TDI2 (−5.67 eV) and BTDI3 (−5.71 eV) are estimated from the onset of the first oxidation peaks in films. All of the data are summarized in Table S2† and the experimental results are consistent with theoretical calculations (Fig. S5†).
For the initial photovoltaic applications of the three acceptors, an inverted architecture of ITO/ZnO/PBDT-TS1:acceptors/MoO3/Al was fabricated. Chlorobenzene was selected as a processing solvent, and no additives and annealing were used. We first examined the blending ratios of PBDT-TS1:TDI2 and PBDT-TS1:BTDI3, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Tables S3 and S4 and Fig. S7.† The optimal D:A ratios are 1:1 for both TDI2 and BTDI3, and OSCs based on TDI with the same D:A ratio were fabricated as a parallel experiment. It was found that BTDI3 based OSCs exhibited a promising PCE of 3.64%, while inferior PCEs of 2.79% and 2.73% were obtained from TDI2 and TDI based devices, respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the three acceptors are displayed in Fig. 3a. As summarized in Table 1, the VOC values are in the sequence of TDI > BTDI3 > TDI2, which are consistent with the LUMO energies. The high molar extinction coefficient of BTDI3 would partially explain the higher JSC values observed in BTDI3 based devices. In addition, the fill factors (FFs) of PBDT-TS1:BTDI3 and PBDT-TS1:TDI2 are similar and slightly higher than that of PBDT-TS1:TDI, probably attributed to the more twisted configuration which is of benefit to the charge separation. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 3b) of these devices cover the wavelength from 300 to 800 nm, while the EQE values are quite low in the range of 300 to 500 nm, possibly due to the strong absorption overlap between the acceptors and PBDT-TS1, as well as the absence of absorption bands from 300 to 500 nm of active layers (Fig. S8†). Obviously, the quantum yield of BTDI3 based devices is much higher compared with TDI2 and TDI based devices and has the maximum peak of up to 58% at 600 nm. The calculated average JSC values are 8.16, 8.55 and 10.81 mA cm−2 for PBDT-TS1:TDI, PBDT-TS1:TDI2 and PBDT-TS1:BTDI3, respectively, which are very close to the values obtained by J–V measurements.

To gain further insight into the difference between the device performances of the three acceptors, space-charge-limited current (SCLC) was utilized to analyze the charge transporting properties. Different thicknesses of active layers have been examined and the details are shown in Fig. S9 and Table S5.† Notably, the hole mobility (μh) is much higher compared to the electron mobilities (μe) in all the devices, indicating that μe might be the limiting factor for JSC and FF. What's more, the higher charge carrier mobility and more balanced carrier transport would partially explain the higher JSC and higher FF observed in the devices based on BTDI3.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the morphologies of PBDT-TS1:acceptor blend films. As displayed in Fig. 4, all the blend films are fairly smooth with root-mean square (RMS) roughness values of 0.85 nm, 0.75 nm and 0.39 nm for TDI, TDI2 and BTDI3 blend films, respectively. The donor and acceptors are mixed well and no obvious aggregates or phase separation are observed, which provide a poor transport pathway and are not good for charge separation and transport. In order to further investigate the molecular packing of different active layers, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. S10,† all of the PBDT-TS1:acceptor blend films show a weak π–π stacking peak at the same location of qz ≈ 1.72 Å−1 only in the out-of-plane orientation, indicating the π–π stacking (d ≈ 3.65 Å) of preferred face-on orientations.

Conclusions
We have developed a straightforward method to synthesize monobrominated TDI, which is a promising intermediate for the construction of multifarious molecules. Accordingly, two twisted terrylene dyes, namely TDI2 and BTDI3, were obtained through homocoupling and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions from monobrominated TDI. Together with monomeric TDI, all the three compounds have been particularly investigated in terms of molecular geometries, as well as optical, electrical and thermal properties. As a result, BTDI3, which has a highly twisted 3D geometry, shows the best light-absorbing capability, while the more conjugated TDI2 has the lowest LUMO level. Furthermore, we made a preliminary attempt to explore their photovoltaic properties by using a commercially available polymer PBDT-TS1 as the donor part. Consequently, BTDI3 based OSCs exhibited promising PCEs up to 3.64% with a VOC of 0.73 V, a JSC of 10.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 46%. The imperfect PCE is probably the result of absorption overlap between the donor and acceptor, as well as the suboptimal BHJ morphology. It should be noted that, this is the first report of a twisted TDI family applied in OSCs demonstrating the potentials of TDIs as a class of acceptors. The search for a more suitable donor to further improve the PCEs of TDIs and efforts to make ternary OSCs with our outstanding PDI acceptors with complementary absorptions are currently underway.
