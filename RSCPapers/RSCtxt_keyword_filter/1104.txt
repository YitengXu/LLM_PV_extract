    , Accepted 23rd April 2019First published on 26th April 2019AbstractOwing to their unique molecular geometry and packing modes in the solid state, curved organic semiconductor molecules such as hexabenzoperylenes and dibenzo[a,m]rubicene exhibit high hole mobilities of ∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are much higher than the hole mobilities of the active layers in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The efficiencies of OPVs based on a fullerene acceptor are relatively improved by over 20% by introducing high-mobility curved p-type organic semiconductors into the active layers as additives in only a few weight percentage. This can be attributed to the increased hole mobilities in the devices. In comparison, the significant efficiency enhancement cannot be observed when high-mobility planar molecules are introduced into the active layers. In view of the curved p-type semiconductors being more compatible with a fullerene acceptor in their molecular shape than a planar one, we consider that the intimate interaction between the curved molecule and the fullerene acceptor can enhance exciton dissociation and hole transfer and thus boost the power conversion efficiencies of the devices.
1. Introduction
To meet the increasing demand for renewable energy, much attention has been paid to solar energy harvesting devices, particularly photovoltaic cells. Solution-processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are one type of the most promising solar cells due to their low cost, light weight, and convenient fabrication processes.1–6 Both non-fullerene and fullerene-based OPVs have been extensively studied in the past two decades and the device performance has been dramatically enhanced by various methods.7–19 One bottleneck for the commercialization of OPVs is the relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) in comparison with their inorganic counterparts, which is mainly due to the low carrier mobilities and short exciton diffusion lengths in organic active layers.20–23 An effective strategy is to introduce additional organic semiconductors into the active layers to tune the physical properties of the organic bulk heterojunctions.24–30 For example, an indene-C60 bisadduct and poly-3-oxothieno[3,4-d]isothiazole-1,1-dioxide/benzodithiophene were added to the active layer of OPVs based on a polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene/[6,6]-phenylC71-butyric acid methyl ester (PTB7/PC71BM) and dramatically enhanced the PCEs of the devices due to the improved charge separation and transport as well as the enhanced light absorption in a broader wavelength region.28,29 The drawback of low carrier mobilities in OPVs was alleviated by introducing high-mobility conjugated polymers including alkyldiketopyrrolopyrrole-dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DPP-DTT) and poly[2,5-bis(alkyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-alt-5,5′-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,2′-(E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl) thiophene] (PDVT-10) as additives into the devices and the device PCEs were substantially increased due to increased hole mobilities in the devices,30 indicating that the addition of high-mobility organic semiconductors to OPVs is an effective approach for improving the device performance.
Various types of high-mobility organic semiconductors have been successfully synthesized specifically for applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) in recent years. For example, DPP-based conjugated polymer semiconductors have a wide range of mobilities from 0.1 to ∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1.31 Poly[4-(4,4-dihexadecyl-4H-cyclopenta-[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)-alt-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine] (PCDTPT) shows a hole mobility higher than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1.32 Some small molecules, such as pentacene, rubrene and their derivatives, have demonstrated carrier mobilities much higher than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1.33–36 Besides, organic semiconductors based on nonplanar π-backbones exhibit hole mobilities of up to 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 as a result of unconventional molecular packing with sufficient π–π stacking in the solid state. For example, OFETs of hexabenzoperylene (HBP in Fig. 1a) and dibenzo[a,m]rubicene (DBR in Fig. 1a) were reported to exhibit hole mobilities as high as 0.82 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 37) and 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1,38 respectively. These organic semiconductors have shown much higher carrier mobilities than the organic materials used in OPVs. Thus, it is convenient to utilize high-mobility organic semiconductors in OPVs as additives to improve their PCEs.

(c) Energy level alignments of OPVs based on PTB7/PC71BM (left) and PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM (right) with the introduction of different additives. 
In this work, we introduced high-mobility small molecules, including HBP and DBR, into the active layers of OPVs. It is interesting to find that the addition of 2.5 wt% HBP can lead to a dramatic increase in the PCE of PTB7/PC71BM-based OPVs from 7.80% to 9.54%. Similarly, for another type of OPV based on poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PBDTTT-EFT) and PC71BM, the addition of 2.5 wt% DBR can improve the average PCE from 9.09% to 10.43%, and the efficiency could be further enhanced to over 11% by incorporating plasmonic Au@Ag core–shell nanocuboids (NCs) into the devices. We find that the carrier mobility of the additive is a critical issue for PCE enhancement. The performance enhancement is attributed to the increase of hole mobility in the active layers of OPVs. In addition, we studied the influence of the molecular shape of the additive on the device performance. When a high-mobility planar molecule TIPS-Pentacene was added to OPVs, little enhancement in the device efficiency was observed. We also find that an organic semiconductor additive with a curved surface can have a stronger interaction with PC71BM. These results imply that high-mobility curved molecules can have more efficient charge transfer with PC71BM in the active layers of OPVs. This work provides a guideline for the design of small-molecule additives to improve the efficiency of OPVs.
2. Results and discussion
OPVs based on PTB7/PC71BM and PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM were fabricated with the conventional device architecture shown in Fig. 1a. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulphonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) and Ca were used as the hole transport layer (HTL) and the electron transport layer (ETL) of the device, respectively. Three organic semiconductors were used as additives in the active layers of the OPVs, including nonplanar molecules HBP and DBR and a planar molecule TIPS-Pentacene. Fig. 1b shows the configuration of the three molecules adjacent to a PC71BM molecule. So the curved molecules (HBP and DBR) may have more intimate interactions with PC71BM than the planar molecule TIPS-Pentacene. Fig. 1c shows the energy level alignment of the OPVs when the three additives are introduced into the active layers. All the energy levels of PTB7, PC71BM and additives, including HBP, DBR, TIPS-Pentacene chosen from the literature were determined by the cyclic voltammetry method.30,37–39 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PTB7 and HBP are very close, which benefits the electron transport in the mixture of the two materials. More importantly, the cascaded highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of PTB7, HBP and PC71BM are favorable for hole transfer from the active layer to the PEDOT:PSS HTL. Notably, DBR and TIPS-Pentacene can also form a cascade energy level alignment in the OPVs, which is favorable for charge transfer in the devices.
2.1 Effect of HBP on OPVs
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PTB7/PC71BM-based OPVs with different percentages of HBP are presented in Fig. 2a. Detailed photovoltaic parameters including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), PCE and relative PCE enhancement are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† It can be found that the addition of HBP increases the device performance substantially, and the addition of 2.5 wt% HBP leads to the best photovoltaic performance with a Jsc of 18.86 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.746 V, a FF of 67.8% and an average PCE of 9.54%. So the PCEs of the devices are relatively enhanced by over 20% under the optimum conditions. However, further increase of the addition level of HBP to 5 wt% inversely decreases the average PCE to 8.54%. The variation of the device photovoltaic performance with the addition of HBP is also reflected in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra in Fig. 2b. Compared with the control device with the maximum EQE of 71.9%, the devices with 1 wt% and 2.5 wt% HBP show improved EQE values in the whole characterized wavelength region with the maximum values of 80.1% and 85.4%, respectively. However, more addition of HBP (5.0 wt%) to the active layer leads to the decrease of EQE, which is consistent with the J–V plots in Fig. 2a.
 Fig. 2  (a) J–V and (b) EQE curves of the best OPV based on PTB7/PC71BM with HBP as the additive; (c) J–V curves of the best OPV based on PTB7/PC71BM with low-mobility twisted and anti HBP as the additive; (d) average PCEs of the OPVs based on PTB7 + HBP/PC71BM with the addition of high-mobility HBP and low-mobility twisted and anti HBP; (e) electron and hole mobilities calculated from the SCLCs in the devices with high-mobility HBP; and (f) electron and hole mobilities calculated from the SCLCs in the devices with low-mobility twisted and anti HBP. 
Notably, HBP is a twisted small molecule and can be converted into a mixture of twisted and anti isomer at a high temperature (≥70 °C).37,40 The twisted and anti isomer was actually found to have a much lower mobility in OFETs, which is unfavorable for carrier transfer in OPVs. To test this effect, we the blend precursors were heated with the HBP additive at 70 °C for over 1 hour and then cooled to room temperature for spin coating. OPVs fabricated from the heated solution were characterized under the same conditions. It is notable that the efficiency of the devices degraded rapidly as demonstrated in the J–V curves in Fig. 2c. With the addition of increased amounts of twisted and anti HBP from 1 wt% to 5.0 wt% in the active layers, the average PCEs of the devices decrease significantly from 7.3% to 6.24%. Detailed photovoltaic parameters can be found in Table S2 in the ESI.†Fig. 2d shows the PCEs of the devices with the addition of HBP under two different conditions. It can be observed that the performance of OPVs was dramatically enhanced by HBP when the devices were prepared at room temperature while the PCE of the OPVs decreased obviously when twisted and anti HBP was used. The negative effect of twisted and anti HBP on the devices can be attributed to the low carrier mobilities of the treated HBP.
To better understand the effect of HBP on the OPVs, hole-transfer devices with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend layer/Au and electron-transfer devices with the structure ITO/ZnO/blend layer/Al were prepared (see the ESI†). Electron and hole currents versus the bias voltage were measured for the devices with different percentages of HBP (see the ESI, Fig. S1†). The plots can be well fitted using the space charge limited current (SCLC) equation. The calculated hole and electron mobilities as a function of the addition amount of HBP are summarized in Fig. 2e. We can clearly find that the hole mobility increases gradually with the increase of the HBP amount while the electron mobility inversely decreases. Notably, the hole and electron mobilities become more balanced when 2.5 wt% HBP is added, which is favorable for charge transfer in OPVs. However, the devices fabricated from the heated blend solutions without any change of the other conditions exhibit completely different variations of the electron and hole currents (see the ESI, Fig. S1†). The calculated hole and electron mobilities in Fig. 2f further illustrate that the carrier mobilities in PTB7 + HBP/PC71BM blends are hardly influenced by twisted and anti HBP owing to its low hole mobility.
The effect of the HBP additive was also tested in the OPVs based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM that were expected to have higher PCEs due to the broader light absorption region of PBDTTT-EFT. Fig. 3a and b show the J–V and EQE curves of the OPVs with different addition amounts of HBP. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are presented in the ESI (Table S3†). An obvious PCE enhancement induced by HBP in the devices can be observed, as shown in Fig. 3c. The average PCE of the devices increases when 1.0 wt% HBP is added, but then decreases when the addition level is further increased. The addition of HBP led to a maximum average PCE of 9.91 ± 0.10% with a relative enhancement of 9.75% compared to the control devices.

2.2 Effect of DBR on OPVs
DBR is another nonplanar organic semiconductor with a hole mobility of up to 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.38 We fabricated OPVs based on PTB7 + DBR/PC71BM under identical conditions as mentioned above. The J–V and EQE characteristics of the OPVs incorporated with different concentrations of DBR in their active layers are shown in Fig. 4a–c. Detailed photovoltaic parameters of the devices are presented in Table S4 in the ESI.† The control devices without the addition of DBR show an average PCE of 7.72%, while the devices with 2.5 wt% DBR present the highest average PCE of 8.63%, demonstrating a relative enhancement of 11.8%. The results are consistent with the EQE enhancement in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm and 550–700 nm. However, the performance enhancement induced by DBR is lower than that resulting from HBP.
 Fig. 4  (a) J–V and (b) EQE curves of the OPVs based on PTB7/PC71BM with DBR as the additive; (c) the variation of the average PCEs of the OPVs with different addition amounts of DBR; (d) J–V and (e) EQE curves of the OPV based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM with DBR as the additive; and (f) the variation of the average PCEs of the devices with different addition amounts of DBR. 
Next, the effect of DBR was tested in OPVs based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM. Fig. 4d and e show the J–V and EQE curves for the devices with DBR in different percentages, demonstrating a more significant improvement in the device performance than the effect of HBP. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table S5 in the ESI.† The PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM control devices without the additive give an average Voc of 0.769 V, a Jsc of 17.64 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.0% and an average PCE of 9.09%. For the devices with 1 wt% DBR, the PCE is improved to 9.70% on average. Then the average PCE is further improved to 10.43% when the addition amount of DBR is increased to 2.5 wt% and the best device shows a PCE of 10.62%. However, the addition of more DBR to 5 wt% cannot enhance device performance anymore, giving an average device PCE of only 9.33%. The EQE characterization of the OPVs presented in Fig. 4e is also consistent with the variation of Jsc. The control device without the additive exhibits the maximum EQE of 75.47%, while the devices with DBR addition levels of 1.0 and 2.5 wt% show the maximum EQE of 82.22 and 87.04%, respectively. Further addition of DBR (5.0 wt%) decreases the EQE values in the wavelength range between 500 nm and 650 nm. The PCEs of the devices as a function of the DBR level are summarized in Fig. 4f. Compared with HBP, DBR can induce a higher PCE enhancement (relatively 14.7%) in OPVs based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM. Additionally, the effect of DBR has also been tested in traditional OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/PC71BM and the novel nonfullerene system based on PBDB-T-SF/IT-4F.41,42 As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the J–V and EQE curves indicate that the addition of 2.5 wt% DBR can improve the PCE of the OPVs based on P3HT/PC71BM from 4.01% (control device) to 4.64% under the optimum conditions. More details on the device performance can be found in Table S9 in the ESI.† However, when DBR was added to the PBDB-T-SF/IT-4F based OPVs, the results showed a significantly different effect. As depicted in Fig. S3 and Table S10 in the ESI,† the efficiency of the devices monotonously decreases with the increase of the addition level of DBR. When 5 wt% DBR was added to the PBDB-T-SF/IT-4F active layers, the average PCE of the OPVs decreased from 10.25% (control device) to 8.79%. The different effects of DBR on the two systems based on fullerene and nonfullerene acceptors indicate that the curved molecule DBR has an interaction with the orbicular fullerene acceptor, which can lead to improvement of the device performance. However, when DBR was added to the nonfullerene devices based on planar active layer materials of PBDB-T-SF/IT-4F, no positive effect was observed.
To further improve the device performance of the OPVs based on PBDTTT-EFT + DBR/PC71BM, Au@Ag core–shell NCs were incorporated into the PEDOT:PSS HTL to enhance the light absorption of the active layer via the light scattering effect and the near-field enhancement of the NCs. The structure of the plasmonic device is shown in Fig. 5a. The sizes of the Au@Ag NCs were optimized to be 20 nm for the Ag shell thickness and 20 nm/60 nm for the diameter/length of the Au core. The Au@Ag NCs were synthesized by a method reported before to realize broad band enhancement of light absorption in the visible region.22,43Fig. 5b shows the J–V curves of the OPVs with different addition levels of Au@Ag NCs. Average photovoltaic parameters of 3 identical devices are summarized in the ESI in Table S6†. Without the incorporation of NCs, the control devices based on PBDTTT-EFT + DBR/PC71BM give an average Voc, Jsc, and FF of 0.792 V, 18.93 mA cm−2, and 68.5%, respectively, leading to an average PCE of 10.27%. After adding Au@Ag NCs to PEDOT:PSS HTLs, the performance of the OPVs exhibits an obvious improvement. Specifically, with the introduction of 1 vol% and 5 vol% NCs, the Voc of the devices remains unchanged, while Jsc is increased to 19.32 and 20.29 mA cm−2 and the FF is enhanced to 70.0% and 70.7%, respectively. As a result, the corresponding average PCEs are improved to 10.76% and 11.42%, as shown in Fig. 5c. Notably, the PCE of our devices is close to the record PCE of fullerene-based OPVs reported recently.44

EQEs of the OPVs were measured to better elucidate the improved Jsc. As shown in Fig. 5d, EQEs of the devices are improved in the whole characterized region by the NCs. The device with NCs (5.0 vol% solution) incorporated into the PEDOT:PSS layer shows the maximum EQE value of 86.35% compared with the control devices with 78.96%, and as expected, it is better than that of the device containing 1.0 vol% NCs with the maximum EQE of 80.93%. The cooperative plasmonic effect of the NCs and the enhancement of the hole mobility with the addition of DBR, both improve the performance of the OPVs. The dual effects increase the average PCE from 9.09% to over 11%. A pronounced relative PCE enhancement of up to 25.63% can be observed, which is mainly due to the remarkable increase of the Jsc of the devices.
2.3 Effect of TIPS-Pentacene on OPVs
TIPS-Pentacene is a high-mobility small-molecule p-type semiconductor popularly used in OFETs,36 but, unlike HBP and DBR, has a planar π-backbone. TIPS-Pentacene was introduced into the OPVs based on PTB7/PC71BM and PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM and prepared under the same processing conditions mentioned above. The J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of the two types of devices are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively (ESI, Tables S7 and S8†). For PTB7/PC71BM-based OPVs, the maximum efficiency of 8.6% was achieved when 1 wt% TIPS-Pentacene was added to the active layer of the device, leading to around 7.9% relative enhancement of the PCE in comparison with the control device. However, further increase of the addition level cannot enhance the device performance (Fig. 6c). For the OPVs based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM, the device PCE is enhanced a little bit by TIPS-Pentacene. As shown in Fig. 6d, the PCE is enhanced from 8.82% to 9.06% with a maximum relative enhancement of 2.7% at an addition level of 1.0 wt%. Therefore, the enhancement induced by TIPS-Pentacene in the OPVs is much lower than that induced by HBP and DBR.

Considering that the light absorption of the blend film can be changed by the additives, we have characterized the UV-visible absorption spectra of the three types of additives in dichloromethane solution with the same concentration of 5 × 10−6 M and the blend active layer thin films based on PTB7/PC71BM with and without the additives (2.5 wt% relatively to PTB7). As depicted in Fig. S4 in the ESI,† adding 2.5 wt% HBP, DBR, or TIPS-Pentacene can enhance the light absorption of the blend films in the wavelength range of 300–600 nm, which is probably due to the change of the film thickness and the crystallinity of the donor and acceptor phases. Obviously, the change of absorption spectra cannot be attributed to the light absorption of the additives because the additives only demonstrate several absorption peaks in narrow wavelength regions. Although the enhanced light absorption of the blend films can be a possible reason for the increased Jsc of the OPVs, it is not the dominant factor for the efficiency enhancement because TIPS-Pentacene can increase the light absorption with the highest magnitude while the resultant Jsc enhancement of the devices shows a minimum value for the three additives. The above experimental results indicate that small-molecule high-mobility organic semiconductors can enhance the PCEs of OPVs based on different active layer materials. When the carrier mobility of the added small molecules (e.g. HBP and twisted & anti isomer) is decreased, the PCE enhancement of the OPVs disappears. Another interesting finding here is that the molecular structure of the small molecules can influence the PCE enhancement of OPVs in different levels. Although TIPS-Pentacene has a higher carrier mobility than HBP and DBR, the PCE enhancement induced by planar TIPS-Pentacene is much lower than that induced by curved HBP and DBR.
2.4 Interactions between additives and PC71BM
We consider that the interaction between the small-molecule additives and PC71BM can be a dominant factor for PCE enhancement. For curved molecules, a more intimate interaction may exist between the additive and PC71BM, as depicted in Fig. 1b, which can enhance charge transfer between them. To confirm this effect, we carried out Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of PTB7/PC71BM blend films with different additives, including HBP, DBR and TIPS-Pentacene, as shown in Fig. 7a and b. It is notable that the absorption peak at 1450 cm−1 for PC71BM is broadened by HBP and DBR while TIPS-Pentacene has little effect on the peak width.45 These results suggest that PC71BM has stronger interactions with HBP and DBR than with TIPS-Pentacene presumably because the curved shape of HBP and DBR is complementary to the ellipsoid shape of C70. It is notable that the charge transfer rate from one molecule to another is related to the electron cloud overlap. So stronger interactions are favorable for charge transfer between PC71BM and the additive.46 However, the curved molecules cannot have an obvious advantage on charge transfer when they are placed together with conjugated polymer donors.

(d) The widths of the diffraction peaks at q = 1.32 Å−1 for the PC71BM component in organic films with different additives, which are extracted from the fitting of the peaks. (e) Illustration of the mechanism of the effect of curved additives (HBP/DBR) on the charge transfer and transport in the blend active layer of an OPV. 
The surface morphologies of the blend films based on PTB7/PC71BM before and after the addition of 2.5 wt% HBP/DBR have also been characterized by AFM. As depicted in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† no obvious change can be observed in the surface morphology of the thin films. Only the surface roughness of the thin films increased gradually from 0.95 nm for the pristine PTB7/PC71BM film to 1.08 and 1.25 nm with the addition of HBP and DBR, respectively. The additives HBP/DBR do not change the structures of the blend films, which guarantees efficient charge transfer in the active layer of the devices.
The organic blend films with different additives were characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD, Regaku 9KW SmartLAB). The out-of-plane diffraction peaks of different films are shown in Fig. 7c and d. Each peak for pure PC71BM and PTB7 films can be fitted very well with a Lorentz function (see the ESI†).30 The peak for pure PTB7 at q = 1.60 Å−1 corresponds to the (010) lattice plane.29 The broad peaks (I and II) of the pure PC71BM film at q = 0.70 and 1.32 Å−1 can be attributed to the combination of several peaks corresponding to different lattice planes.47 It is reasonable to observe a broader diffraction peak for a PTB7/PC71BM blend film, which is the combination of the two peaks at q = 1.32 Å−1 and 1.60 Å−1 originating from PC71BM and PTB7, respectively. By doing least squares fitting, we can extract the width of the diffraction peak of PC71BM at q = 1.32 Å−1. As shown in Fig. 7d, the width is increased due to the addition of HBP and DBR, while TIPS-Pentacene in the blend film cannot induce a detectable change of the peak width. The broadening of the diffraction peak can be attributed to the decrease of the crystallinity of PC71BM in the blend films. The lower crystallinity of PC71BM is presumably due to a strong interaction between PC71BM and HBP (DBR) in the organic films as a result of complementary shapes of fullerene and HBP. This result also explains the decrease of electron mobility with the addition of HBP to the PTB7/PC71BM blend film, as presented in Fig. 2e. An illustration of the working mechanism is proposed in Fig. 7e. The FTIR and XRD results suggest that PC71BM has a stronger interaction with curved HBP and DBR than with TIPS-Pentacene. Additionally, the molecular ordering of PTB7 has no obvious change with the introduction of additives, which demonstrates that the curved small molecules HBP and DBR are mainly located at the interface between PTB7 and PC71BM. Not only the complementary shapes of fullerene and curved additives but also the high hole mobilities of HBP and DBR can enhance charge transfer in the donor/acceptor heterojunctions, which eventually results in the improvement of the efficiency of OPVs with the addition of appropriate amounts of curved molecules.
3. Experimental section
3.1 Materials
Polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-benzodithiophene (PTB7), [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methylester (PC71BM) and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PBDTTT-EFT) were purchased from 1-Materials Incorporation. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulphonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) (CLEVIOS™ PH 500) was purchased from Heraeus, Germany. The high-mobility small molecules HBP, DBR, and TIPS-Pentacene were synthesized by a method reported previously.37,38
3.2 Fabrication of devices
The device structure of the solution processed OPV is shown in Fig. 1a. A high mobility small molecule (HBP, DBR and TIPS-Pentacene) was added to the active layer based on PTB7/PC71BM (1:1.5 weight ratio) in the mixed solvent of chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) (97:3 volume ratio). The PTB7/PC71BM-based OPVs with various addition levels of HBP (HBP weight percentages relative to PTB7 are 1%, 2.5% and 5%) were fabricated under identical conditions. A ∼40 nm PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-cast on patterned ITO/glass substrates and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. After that, the active layer was spin-cast on the PEDOT:PSS layer from the PTB7 (+HBP, DBR, and TIPS-Pentacene)/PC71BM precursors at 1500 rpm for 1 min in a glovebox. Before electrode deposition, methanol was spin-coated onto the active layer at 2500 rpm. Then, a Ca layer with a thickness of 20 nm and a 100 nm Al electrode were sequentially deposited onto the active layer by thermal evaporation. The area of the active layer was 6.0 mm2.
The OPVs based on PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM with the addition of HBP, DBR, or TIPS-Pentacene were also prepared under exactly the same fabrication conditions as PTB7/PC71BM-based devices. The addition percentages of the small molecules relative to PBDTTT-EFT in the experiments are 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 wt%, respectively. The P3HT/PC71BM- and PBDB-T-SF/IT-4F-based OPV devices with and without DBR (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 wt%) were fabricated under the conditions provided in previous reports.41,42 All of the OPV devices were encapsulated in a glovebox, and then characterized in air and at least 6 devices were prepared for each condition.
Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated for measuring hole and electron mobilities in PTB7 + HBP/PC71BM blend films. Hole-only devices with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend layer/Au were prepared by spin coating the PEDOT:PSS and PTB7 + HBP/PC71BM films subsequently onto ITO glass substrates in a glovebox, followed by the thermal deposition of an Au top electrode through a shadow mask. The average thickness of the PTB7 + HBP/PC71BM films was found to be 250 nm by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Digital Instruments). Electron-only devices with the structure ITO/ZnO/blend layer/Al were prepared. A ZnO precursor solution (0.5 M zinc acetate dehydrate in 2-methoxyethanol) was spin coated onto ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing on a hotplate at 200 °C for 30 min in dry air. Then PTB7 + HBP/PC71BM films were coated on the ZnO layers. Finally, Al top electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask.
3.3 Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPVs were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport 91160, 300 W, solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5 filter). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. EQE spectra of the OSCs were measured with a standard system equipped with a xenon lamp (Oriel 66902, 300 W), a monochromator (Newport 66902), a Si detector (Oriel 76175_71580), and a dual channel power meter (Newport 2931_C). FTIR spectra of organic films were measured by using a Bruker VERTEX 70 FT-IR spectrometer.
The space charge limited currents (SCLCs) of the hole-only devices and electron-only devices were measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent 4156C) in a glovebox. The current density as a function of the bias voltage was fitted (least-squares fitting) with the Murgatroyd equation:30 (1)where V is the applied voltage, εr is the relative permittivity of the organic blend (taken as 3.5), ε0 is the permittivity of free space, and μ is the carrier mobility. μ, β and Vb are fitting parameters.
Organic blend films coated on SiO2/Si substrates were characterized by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD, Regaku 9KW SmartLAB). Each peak was fitted with the Lorentz function:30 (2)where I is the intensity, Ib is the background intensity, A is the peak area, w is the half-width and qp is the peak position.
4. Conclusions
In summary, highly efficient OPVs are successfully fabricated by introducing high-mobility curved p-type organic semiconductors, HBP and DBR, into the active layers as additives. We demonstrate that HBP can increase the PCE of PTB7/PC71BM-based OPVs from 7.80% to 9.54% with a relative enhancement of 22.3% upon adding 2.5 wt% HBP relative to PTB7 to the blend film. For PBDTTT-EFT/PC71BM OPVs, the best performance is obtained by incorporating 2.5 wt% DBR into the active layer. The average PCEs of the OPVs are improved from 9.09% to 10.43% with a relative enhancement of 14.7%. Moreover, the efficiency of the PBDTTT-EFT + DBR/PC71BM-based devices could be further improved to 11.42% by adding Au@Ag NCs to the PEDOT:PSS layer due to a plasmonic effect. The significant enhancement of the PCEs by the high-mobility curved molecules can be attributed to the increased hole mobility in the active layer and intimate interactions between the curved molecule and PC71BM. In comparison, control experiments by introducing a high-mobility planar molecule additive TIPS-Pentacene only demonstrate a much lower enhancement of the device efficiency, indicating that the molecular structure of the additive is critical to its effect. Therefore, we conclude that the interactions between the additive and the donor/acceptor in OPVs play a key role in the photovoltaic performance of OPVs.
