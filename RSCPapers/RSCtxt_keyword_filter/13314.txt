    , Accepted 13th October 2010First published on 26th November 2010AbstractDevice function in organic electronics is critically governed by the transport of charge across interfaces of dissimilar materials. Accurate measurements of energy level positions in organic electronic devices are therefore necessary for assessing the viability of new materials and optimizing device performance. In contrast to established methods that are used in solution or vacuum environments, here we combine Kelvin probe measurements performed in ambient environments to obtain work function values with photoelectron spectroscopy in air to obtain ionization potential, so that a complete energy level diagram for organic semiconductors can be determined. We apply this new approach to study commonly used electron donor and acceptor materials in organic photovoltaics (OPV), including poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), and ZnO, as well as examine new materials. Band alignments across the entire OPV devices are constructed and compared with actual device performance. The ability to determine interfacial electronic properties in the devices enables us to answer the outstanding question: why previous attempts to make OPV devices using 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) (TIPS)-pentacene as the electron donor were not successful.
Introduction
The field of organic electronics has generated great interest due to the potential of new applications and low-cost fabrication. Device performance in organic electronics is governed largely by the energy level alignment at the interfaces found in these devices. In organic photovoltaics (OPV) and hybrid photovoltaics, charge generation is fundamentally dictated by the energy level alignment at the donor/acceptor interface, while efficient charge extraction depends on proper energy level alignment at the organic active layer/inorganic electrode interfaces.1–5 Energy level alignment at metal/organic interfaces also influences the efficiency of charge injection in organic light emitting diodes (OLED).6,7 To date, band alignment in organic electronic materials is typically assessed by either cyclic voltammetry (CV) or ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). CV analysis allows for the estimation of both the LUMO and HOMO levels of organic semiconductors through measurement of the reduction and oxidation potentials either for isolated molecules in solution or for thin films submerged in solvent. The working range of these measurements is limited by the electrochemical stability of the solvent and the determined energy levels do not always correlate well with values observed at the solid state interfaces in actual devices. UPS analysis can provide both the ionization potential (IP) and HOMO level position of a film as well as its work function in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). In addition, UPS in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can also be used to determine band bending across interfaces and the Fermi level alignment at the active layer/electrode interface. However, measurements made by UPS are extremely sensitive to surface conditions leading to a range of values reported for common materials due to variations in fabrication and handling history.8–10 Exposure of films to UHV conditions can also alter the surface composition, particularly for metal oxide surfaces used in hybrid photovoltaics,11 from that found in devices constructed under ambient conditions in the laboratory. Photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) offers an intriguing alternative to both CV and UPS for the determination of band structure in PV materials.12 PESA uses a low power, tunable, monochromatic UV source to generate photoelectrons that in turn ionize oxygen molecules in the air which are then detected by an open counter.12 This allows for the determination of the IP of films in ambient environment.13 By combining Fermi level measurement obtained by Kelvin probe (KP) under atmospheric environments with the IPs measured by PESA and the optical band gaps calculated from UV-Vis absorption spectra, we construct a complete energy level alignment across different interfaces for OPVs fabricated and tested under practical laboratory conditions. These analytical techniques for obtaining energy level alignment under realistic device conditions should prove useful for understanding device performance and evaluating promising new materials.
Energy level alignment at the interfaces between the active layer materials and electrodes plays a critical role in determining charge injection and extraction efficiencies in OLEDs and OPVs respectively. Estimations of energy level alignment at these interfaces are commonly made by mating the work function value of bulk metal electrodes to that of the bulk organic semiconductor assuming that the Fermi levels of the two materials align upon contact. However, heterogeneity in the molecular and electronic structure of the semiconductor film at the metal interface may create surface states which differ significantly from the polaron level in the bulk semiconductor film. In addition, Fermi level alignment does not always occur at metal/organic interfaces.14–22 For organic semiconductors deposited onto metals, it was shown that when the Fermi levels of the organic and metal favor charge transfer, the work function of the organic film becomes independent of the metal substrate work function, and an interfacial dipole is formed to compensate the charge imbalance.14–18 This phenomenon is referred to as “Fermi level alignment”. It should be noted that the alignment levels measured in work function experiments may not directly correspond to the energy level of the polarons in the semiconductor film, but rather are threshold energy values where charge transfer can occur at the interface.19 On the other hand, when the charge transfer condition is not favored, the vacuum levels of the organic and metal align without an interfacial dipole. Two models have been proposed to describe the electronic interaction at the interface of organic semiconductors with metals. The Integer Charge Transfer (ICT) model applies when electronic mixing between the organic and the metal is minimal.14,15 Such interfaces between weakly interacting materials are typically found for interfaces constructed in ambient environment where surfaces contain an oxide or a hydrocarbon layer. Alternatively, the Induced Density of Interfacial State (IDIS) model describes interfaces where the interaction between materials is non-negligible, such as organics deposited onto a clean metal substrate in vacuum.21,22 In the IDIS model, hybridization between the π-orbitals of the organic and the metal surface leads to a continuum of states at the interface into which charge can transfer. While the mechanism for charge transfer differs for these two models, the formation of an interfacial dipole to balance charge across the interface has been observed for both. Determination of the presence and strength of this interfacial dipole for a semiconductor/metal junction allows for a more accurate account of electronic properties at the heterojunction interface. These energy levels have traditionally been measured in UHV by UPS.15–18 Here we explore whether similar behavior can be observed by KP for films fabricated and tested in air by comparing the work function characteristics of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to that obtained using UPS. We also studied ZnO and 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) (TIPS)-pentacene. All materials' molecular/crystal structures and absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 1.

Experimental

        P3HT (Rieke Metals, electronics grade regioregular P3HT 4002-E), PCBM (Nano C, C60PCBM >99.5%) and TIPS-pentacene films for PESA analysis and optical band gap determination by UV-Vis were prepared by spin coating onto glass substrates which were sonicated in soapy water and isopropyl alcohol (Fisher Chemical, ACS grade) for 10 min each, followed a 15 min UV ozone treatment. P3HT, PCBM, TIPS-pentacene and ZnO nanoparticles (ZnOnp) films for Kelvin probe (Monroe Electronics Model 244 Electrostatic Voltmeter) analysis were spun onto metal and ITO (Colorado Concept Coatings) substrates following a 15 min UV ozone treatment of the surfaces. Metal substrates used for Kelvin probe experiments were prepared by vacuum deposition of 50 nm of Al, Ti, Ag, Au, Pt and Ni onto Si substrates using a 10 nm Ti adhesion layer when needed. P3HT films were spun at 1000 rpm for 1 min from a 14 g L−1 solution of P3HT dissolved in chlorobenzene (Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%). PCBM films were spun at 1000 rpm for 1 min from a 20 g L−1 solution of PCBM dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (Acros Organics, 99+%). TIPS-pentacene was prepared according to a published procedure.23TIPS-pentacene films were spun at 1000 rpm for 1 min from a 20 g L−1 solution of TIPS-pentacene dissolved in toluene (Fisher Scientific, ACS grade).

        ZnO
        nanoparticles were synthesized in methanol (Fisher Chemical, ACS grade) following a published procedure.24ZnO nanoparticles were diluted with a solution of chlorobenzene with 10% 1-propanol to a final concentration of 100 g L−1, with approximately 10% methanol in the final solution. ZnOnp films were prepared by spin coating 100 g L−1 ZnOnp in chlorobenzene at 1000 rpm for 1 min onto cleaned glass and ITO substrates for UV-Vis and UPS analysis respectively.
The ionization potential for the organic films on glass was measured by PESA under constant dry air flow using a Riken Keiki AC-2 spectrometer. PESA spectra for these films are shown in the Supporting Information (Fig. S1). Optical band gaps were measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Ocean Optics, Inc.). The ionization potential of a ZnOnp film was measured in vacuum by UPS (Omicron HIS 13 VUV source and a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD hemispherical analyzer). Kelvin probe work function measurements of ZnO films were made in a N2 environment due to sensitivity of metal oxide surfaces to H2O and O2 while organic films were measured both in air and in N2 with identical values observed in each environment. All Kelvin probe measurements were calibrated using a Au reference (ΨAu = 5.1 eV). UPS work function measurements of organics were performed using monochromatized He I radiation hν = 21.2 eV and in a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of 10−10 mbar. The UPS measurements were calibrated using an Au reference (ΨAu = 5.2 eV).
Hybrid bilayer photovoltaic devices were fabricated on patterned ITO substrates (Thin Film Devices, Anaheim CA, R ≤ 15 Ω/□) which had been cleaned using the above procedure. A zinc acetate solution 7.7 g L−1 in ethanol was spin coated at 1000 rpm onto the ITO and pyrolyzed in air on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min. The spin coating/pyrolysis was repeated once more to form a 15 nm total thickness ZnO film. Either P3HT, TIPS-pentacene or a blend of P3HT:TIPS-pentacene was then spin coated onto the ZnO film at 1000 rpm for 1 min from solutions of 24 g L−1P3HT in chlorobenzene, 24 g L−1TIPS-pentacene in toluene, or 20:10, 10:20, and 20:20 g L−1 of P3HT:TIPS-pentacene in chlorobenzene, respectively. For solutions containing TIPS-pentacene, the TIPS-pentacene was added to the solvent and vigorously stirred for 1–2 min to dissolve and then immediately used. After drying the films were annealed on a hotplate at 150 °C for 10 min in N2. X-ray diffraction results of neat TIPS-pentacene and 1:1 P3HT:TIPS-pentacene films are shown in Supporting Information (Fig. S2A). Inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells (ITO/ZnO/PCBM:P3HT/PEDOT/Ag) were fabricated based on a previously published procedure.25 A 60 g L−1 solution of PCBM:P3HT in a 1:1 weight ratio was dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene while heating at 60 °C for 30 min. The active layer was then spun onto a 15 nm ZnO sol gel layer on ITO (fabricated as described above) at 600 rpm for 1 min. Active layers thicknesses varied based on composition with ∼100 nm for the pure P3HT and pure TIPS-pentacene films, ∼150–200 nm for the mixed TIPS-pentacene:P3HT, ∼150–200 nm for PCBM:P3HT and PCBM:TIPS-pentacene. The resulting film was allowed to dry slowly in the dark in a covered Petri dish in a N2 atmosphere. After drying the film was annealed on a hotplate at 110 °C for 10 min in N2. A PEDOT:PSS layer was then spun at 2000 rpm for 1 min onto the active layer from a PEDOT solution with 1% by weight surfactant added (Aldrich, Zonyl 100) to aid wetting. The PEDOT film was dried on a hotplate at 120 °C for 10 min in air. Inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells using a PCBM:TIPS-pentacene active layer (ITO/ZnO/PCBM:TIPS-pentacene/Ag) were fabricated by spin coating a solution of PCBM and TIPS-pentacene at 24 g L−1 each in chlorobenzene at 1000 rpm for 1 min on ZnO coated ITO. In order to minimize reaction between PCBM and TIPS-pentacene in solution, PCBM was first dissolved in chlorobenzene for 60 min, followed by addition of TIPS-pentacene, which was dissolved with vigorous stirring for 1–2 min immediately prior to spin coating. The resulting film was allowed to dry slowly in the dark in a N2 atmosphere and was then annealed on a hotplate at 110 °C for 10 min in N2. The UV-Vis spectrum of the PCBM:TIPS-pentacene shows similar absorption features to the neat TIPS-pentacene film. (See Supporting Information, Fig. S2B.) Organic and ZnO layer thicknesses were monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy.

        Silver
        electrodes, 100 nm thick, were thermally evaporated onto all devices through a shadow mask to define a device area of 0.1 cm2. Device measurements under one-sun illumination were carried out with a KG5 filtered tungsten-halogen lamp with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 as determined by a NREL calibrated Si photodiode. EQE measurements were performed with use of a Horiba Jobin Yvon Triax 180 monochromator. The monochromatic illumination intensity was monitored with a NREL calibrated Si photodiode, while the photocurrent from the device was recorded with a Stanford Research SR810 lock-in amplifier operating at a chopping frequency of 40 Hz.
Results and discussion

        P3HT films were deposited onto a series of metal substrates, and work function values were measured by KP in air and compared to UPS results made in UHV on the same films. Fig. 2A is a plot of P3HT film work function on each metal substrate (Ψfilm/sub) versus the work function for the bare metal (Ψsub). P3HT films measured by KP show that the Ψfilm/sub varies with Ψsub for substrates with work function ≲ 4.3 eV, indicating vacuum level alignment at the organic/metal interface and no charge transfer.17 For higher work function substrates (≳ 4.3 eV), the measured Ψfilm/sub for P3HT films does not depend on the Ψsub, indicating that the Fermi level of the organic film is pinned as a result of charge transfer and dipole formation across the interface. The transition between these two regimes was determined to lie at a threshold value (ΨPL = 4.37 ± 0.07 eV), above which P3HT will transfer electrons into the substrate. P3HT films measured by UPS show a similar trend in a plot of Ψfilm/subversus Ψsub; however, the pinning level from the UPS measurements occurs at ΨPL = 4.03 ± 0.05 eV. The behavior in which Fermi level alignment occurs at higher work function substrates for P3HT shown in Fig. 2A is characteristic of an electron donor material.17 The results for PCBM films measured by KP and UPS also show Fermi level alignment and vacuum level alignment regions (Fig. 2B). However, unlike P3HT, Fermi level alignment occurs at lower work function substrates indicating electrons transfer from the metal to PCBM, characteristic of electron acceptor behavior. KP probe measurements show that for substrates below ΨPL = 4.66 ± 0.08 eV, Ψfilm/sub does not vary with Ψsub. Likewise UPS measurements show Fermi level alignment of PCBM for substrates with a work function below ΨPL = 4.38 ± 0.05 eV. At higher Ψsub both KP and UPS observe vacuum level alignment at the PCBM/metal interface. Thus, the transition from vacuum level alignment to Fermi level alignment is observed in ambient environment for both donor and acceptor films processed under realistic device fabrication conditions.

Measured pinning level (ΨPL) for each film is accented by a dashed line. 
While the trends for P3HT and PCBM Ψfilm/subvs. Ψsub measurements by KP and UPS are similar, the UPS determined ΨPL value for each organic is ∼0.3 eV lower than the KP value. The discrepancy between KP and UPS values is well documented.26–29 First, in our experiments, both UPS and KP used Au as the reference with work function taken to be 5.1 eV. However, it is reported that the work function values of air-exposed Au surfaces measured by UPS are lower with values ranging from 4.4 to 5.1 eV.26,27 Variation in the reference values will directly contribute to the differences observed by UPS and KP. In addition, there is a fundamental difference in how the two techniques measure work function. The work function measured by UPS is a threshold value representing the lowest energy electrons which are able to escape the film surface upon excitation with the UV source.26 Therefore, the work function measured by UPS represents the lowest work function in the measured area. KP however measures the average work function beneath the probe area.26 Thus, unless the surface is uniform, KP work function values would be higher than UPS values. Finally, introduction of the films into vacuum for UPS measurement may reduce the quantity of volatile surface adsorbates on the films, resulting in a work function difference.
With the validation of ambient KP measurements on the widely used electron donor and acceptor materials (P3HT and PCBM, respectively), we applied the same technique to examine other potentially useful OPV materials. TIPS-pentacene is thought to be a suitable electron donor for use in organic and hybrid photovoltaics, based on the oxidation and reduction potentials of TIPS-pentacene being similar to P3HT as determined by CV.30 Additionally TIPS-pentacene is amenable to solution processing and has a broad absorption of visible light as shown in Fig. 1. Mobilities > 1 cm2/Vs were reported for crystalline TIPS-pentacene thin film transistors (TFT);31 however, mobility in TIPS-pentacene films has been shown to vary by 2–3 orders of magnitude based on processing conditions.31–33 Despite promising band alignment and high TFT mobility, attempts to construct solar cells using TIPS-pentacene as the electron donor coupled to fullerenes as the electron acceptor have not been successful.30,34 Bilayer devices (made from stacked layers of materials) constructed using a solution deposited TIPS-pentacene layer and a vacuum deposited C60 layer yielded power conversion efficiencies (η) up to ∼0.5% with the addition of mobile ions into the TIPS-pentacene layer.34 All vacuum deposited C60/TIPS-pentacene devices have been reported with η = 0.4%,35 but with a reduced short circuit current density (Jsc) and high series resistance compared to C60/pentacene cells. External quantum efficiency measurements of the C60/TIPS-pentacene cells did not show any features associated with the TIPS-pentacene film, indicating that current in the devices arises entirely from light absorption by C60.35TIPS-pentacene in these devices with C60 is therefore functioning only as a hole transport layer and not as an electron donor material as intended. Efforts to construct hybrid ZnO/TIPS-pentacene photovoltaics in our laboratory have also not been successful, raising the question of whether the HOMO/LUMO positions of TIPS-pentacene determined from CV are the same as those in solid films. In order to assess the viability of TIPS-pentacene as an electron donor in organic and hybrid photovoltaics, the work function values of TIPS-pentacene on substrates with different work functions were examined using KP and compared to that of P3HT. The plots of Ψfilm/subvs. Ψsub for both TIPS-pentacene and P3HT are shown in Fig. 3A. Indeed TIPS-pentacene displays the Fermi level alignment characteristics expected of electron donor materials, with the threshold level occurring at 4.83 ± 0.11 eV, higher than that of P3HT at 4.37 ± 0.07 eV.

Measured pinning level (ΨPL) for each film is accented by a dashed line. 

        ZnO is commonly used in hybrid photovoltaics as the electron acceptor. The Fermi level alignment behavior of films of ZnO nanoparticle (ZnOnp) was examined and compared to that of PCBM. In Fig. 3B, the Fermi level alignment behavior of ZnOnp appears as would be expected for electron acceptor materials with the threshold level occurring at 4.20 ± 0.05 eV, compared to PCBM at 4.66 eV. Due to the hydrophilicity of the ZnO surface, KP measurements of ZnO were performed in N2 environment at atmospheric pressure. The ZnO surface is known to lose oxygen resulting in increased conductivity in UHV,36,37 as is the case during UPS analysis, which would lead to work function changes. The surface changes would be less under atmospheric N2 pressure compared to UHV and the work function results obtained by KP would more accurately reflect the ZnO electronic properties in actual photovoltaic devices.
In order to construct band diagrams for devices made from P3HT or TIPS-pentacene coupled to PCBM or ZnOnp, the ionization potentials of films of P3HT, TIPS-pentacene and PCBM prepared on glass were measured in air by PESA (Supporting Information Fig. S1). PESA has been shown to give values for the IP of materials that are comparable to those determined by other techniques, for example the IP of silver by PESA is 4.70 eV. For organic materials, the IP values determined by PESA have also been validated by the performance of the materials in both OPVs and organic field effect transistors.13,38 Since the valence band (VB) of ZnO is larger than the UV excitation energy (6.2 eV) used by PESA, the IP of a ZnOnp film could not be obtained by PESA and was therefore determined from UPS in vacuum. The surface changes in UHV affect the IP value less than the work function value. The LUMO level of the organic films and the conduction band (CB) of the ZnOnp film were then calculated by subtracting the optical band gap, as measured by the onset of absorbance in UV-Vis spectra, from their respective HOMO and VB. The determined band levels along with the pinning levels of these films are compiled in Table 1. Band diagrams across different interfaces in OPV and hybrid devices are shown in Fig. 4, constructed using the values in Table 1 along with the Fermi level positions obtained from Fig. 3. The presence and magnitude of interfacial dipoles are determined based on the energy level alignment regime (vacuum level alignment or Fermi level alignment) determined in the KP measurements. Since Kelvin probe and PESA do not provide depth information, we assume the alignment energy difference at the heterojunctions arises from interfacial dipoles, consistent with published ICT and IDIS models. The band diagram of an inverted hybrid solar cell using P3HT as the electron donor, ZnO as the electron acceptor, ITO to collect electrons and Ag to collect holes is shown in Fig. 4A. A similar device structure, but with TIPS-pentacene as the electron donor, is depicted in Fig. 4B. The offset between the HOMO level of the electron donor (P3HT or TIPS-pentacene) and the LUMO, or CB in the case of ZnO, of the electron acceptor has been shown to be related to the maximum open circuit voltage (Voc) in OPVs.1–4,39 This ZnO CB-donor HOMO offset for the ZnOnp/P3HT and ZnOnp/TIPS-pentacene heterojunctions is 0.81 and 1.44 eV respectively. Hence, ZnO/TIPS-pentacene devices are expected to yield a higher Voc than ZnO/P3HT. The offset between the electron donor LUMO level and the electron acceptor LUMO, or CB for ZnO, determines the driving force for charge separation. The ZnO CB-donor LUMO offset for the ZnOnp/P3HT and ZnOnp/TIPS-pentacene heterojunctions is 1.14 and 0.59 eV respectively. Since a 0.3 eV offset is considered necessary for efficient charge separation,1,40 the constructed band diagrams indicate that both the ZnO/P3HT and ZnO/TIPS-pentacene heterojunctions have a sufficient energy offset to promote charge transfer and should both function effectively in photovoltaics devices.

Band bending of the organic films shown in these illustrations, while probable, was not directly measured. 
Band diagrams of inverted bulk heterojunction devices using P3HT or TIPS-pentacene as the electron donor, PCBM as the electron acceptor, ZnO coated ITO to collect electrons, and Ag to collect holes are shown in Fig. 4C,D. While these band diagrams are for bilayer devices, it is assumed that the use of a bulk heterojunction architecture predominantly affects the interfacial area and has minimal effect on the band alignment. The PCBM LUMO-donor HOMO offsets determined for PCBM/P3HT and PCBM/TIPS-pentacene are 1.24 and 1.51 eV respectively, both conducive to high Voc devices. Note that PCBM/P3HT devices should produce higher Voc than ZnO/P3HT devices. The PCBM LUMO-donor LUMO offsets for PCBM/P3HT and PCBM/TIPS-pentacene are 0.71 and 0.16 eV, respectively. The close alignment of the PCBM and TIPS-pentacene LUMO levels might not provide enough driving force for charge transfer or a sufficient barrier to prevent back transfer of electrons from PCBM to TIPS-pentacene.
In order to test the validity of the band diagrams proposed in Fig. 4, a series of PV devices were fabricated. Illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) responses of ZnO/P3HT and ZnO/TIPS-pentacene bilayer solar cells are illustrated in Fig. 5A with performance parameters for these devices listed in Table 2. The ZnO/P3HT bilayer device yielded a Voc of 427 mV and Jsc of 0.54 mA cm−2 and η of 0.13%, consistent with previously reported values.3,4 The ZnO/TIPS-pentacene device however showed no appreciable photovoltaic response, despite the favorable band alignment predicted for this system (Fig. 4B). Illuminated J–V responses for inverted bulk heterojunction devices using a ZnO interlayer between ITO and the active layer along with a Ag electrode for PCBM:P3HT and PCBM:TIPS-pentacene heterojunctions are also shown in Fig. 5B with relevant device parameters listed with Table 2. Fabricating bilayer devices for these systems is difficult due to the similar solubility of PCBM, P3HT and TIPS-pentacene in common organic solvents. As has been shown previously,25 the PCBM:P3HT heterojunction produces relatively high device performance with a Voc = 580 mV, Jsc = 7.92 mA cm−2, and η = 2.62%. The higher Voc observed for the PCBM:P3HT device compared to the ZnO/P3HT agrees well with the results from band alignment measurements that show a larger donor HOMO-acceptor LUMO (CB) offset observed for the PCBM:P3HT interface (Fig. 4A and 4C). The higher Jsc measured in the PCBM:P3HT bulk heterojunction device compared to the ZnO/P3HT bilayer device can be largely explained by the increased interfacial area in the bulk heterojunction. In contrast to the PCBM:P3HT device, bulk heterojunctions of PCBM:TIPS-pentacene however did not show any significant photovoltaic response.

It is well known that a Diels–Alder reaction occurs between pentacene and PCBM in solution,30,34,41 which would result in impurities in the PCBM:TIPS-pentacene bulk heterojunction film and poor solar cell performance. In addition, lack of a sufficient LUMO–LUMO offset might be the cause behind poor device performance of previously reported C60/TIPS-pentacene bilayer devices where reaction between the two materials did not limit the device performance.34,35 However, these explanations do not apply to the lack of photovoltaic response observed in ZnO/TIPS-pentacene bilayer devices. A favorable band alignment for charge separation and extraction is predicted for ZnO/TIPS-pentacene devices (Fig. 4B) and TIPS-pentacene does not chemically react with ZnO. Thus, other explanations are needed; some possibilities are poor hole mobility in the spun cast TIPS-pentacene film or a non-optimal molecular orientation of pentacene molecules at the acceptor surface that limits interfacial charge transfer.42 In order to test the effect of hole transport on device performance, devices were fabricated using ZnO as the electron acceptor coupled to a mixed film of TIPS-pentacene and P3HT, with the intention of P3HT aiding hole transport to the electrode upon charge separation. The proposed band diagram for this ITO/ZnO/TIPS-pentacene:P3HT/Ag device can be found in the Fig. 6A. UV-Vis spectra of ZnO/P3HT:TIPS-pentacene devices with varying weight ratios of P3HT:TIPS-pentacene are shown in Fig. 6B. As the concentration of TIPS-pentacene is increased, with P3HT:TIPS-pentacene ratio varied from 1:0.5 to 1:1 to 1:2, the absorption contributions from TIPS-pentacene at 350, 425, 450, 600 and 675 nm increase concomitantly while absorption of P3HT remains relatively constant, confirming that both TIPS-pentacene and P3HT are present in the spun films. The sharp peaks at 425 and 450 nm are characteristic of disordered TIPS-pentacene films made by spin casting (see Supporting Information Fig. S2C). Illuminated J–V responses for these ZnO/P3HT:TIPS-pentacene junctions are compared to a ZnO/P3HT junction in Fig. 6C while the device parameters are detailed in Table 3. The addition of a small amount of TIPS-pentacene (1:0.5 P3HT:TIPS-pentacene) to the electron donor layer resulted in an increase in Voc of 50 mV over ZnO/P3HT along with decreases in Jsc, fill factor (FF) and η and an increase in series resistance (Rs). Increasing the P3HT:TIPS-pentacene ratio to 1:1 resulted in an additional 70 mV increase in Voc up to 498 mV with Jsc = 0.27 mA cm−2 and η = 0.061% compared to the ZnO/P3HT device having Voc = 379 mV, Jsc = 0.38 mA cm−2, and η = 0.075%. Photovoltaics with 1:2 P3HT:TIPS-pentacene showed the lowest efficiency with η = 0.014% due to low Jsc = 0.10 mA cm−2 and concurrently high Rs despite a comparably high Voc = 482 mV. The Voc increase when adding TIPS-pentacene to P3HT has been reproduced in six sets of experiments, and is consistent with the higher ZnO CB-TIPS-pentacene HOMO offset predicted for the acceptor/donor interface. The concomitant increase of Rs and reduction of Jsc with the addition of TIPS-pentacene corroborates that hole mobility is the major factor that limits performance in these devices.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. 6D) of both the ZnO/P3HT and ZnO/P3HT:TIPS-pentacene devices reveal that the devices with TIPS-pentacene have current contributions from both P3HT and TIPS-pentacene. A comparison of the EQE spectrum for ZnO/P3HT to the absorption spectra for P3HT and ZnO (Fig. 1) shows that current measured by EQE arises from absorption by both ZnO (at 360 nm) and P3HT (450–650 nm). In addition to contributions from P3HT and ZnO, additional new peaks are observed at 375, 425, 600 and 650 nm (marked by arrows) in the EQE spectra for the ZnO/P3HT:TIPS-pentacene devices. These new current contributions are consistent with the absorption peaks for TIPS-pentacene in Fig. 1. The smaller band gap for TIPS-pentacene (1.65 eV) compared to P3HT (1.95 eV) precludes energy transfer from TIPS-pentacene to P3HT. On the other hand, the lower IP measured for P3HT (4.65 eV) compared to TIPS-pentacene (5.20 eV) indicates that transfer of holes from TIPS-pentacene to P3HT for transport to the Ag electrode is energetically favorable. While band alignment at the P3HT/TIPS-pentacene interface (Fig. 6A) suggests that electron transfer from P3HT to TIPS-pentacene is possible and the heterojunction could be at the P3HT/TIPS-pentacene interface, devices constructed without the ZnO layer (ITO/PEDOT/P3HT:TIPS-pentacene/Al) show minimal photovoltaic response (η = 0.001%). Thus, we conclude that the exciton dissociation and charge transfer predominantly occur at ZnO/P3HT and ZnO/TIPS-pentacene interfaces. These results suggest that the poor photovoltaic performance of the ZnO/TIPS-pentacene bilayer devices is mainly due to low out-of-plane hole mobility in these spin-coated TIPS-pentacene films. Three sources can contribute to the low hole mobility in spin-coated TIPS-pentacene films. First, out-of-plane hole transport in typical TIPS-pentacene films requires the charge carrier to flow through the insulating substituents of the molecule. Transport in this direction has been shown to be orders of magnitude worse than in-plane transport.23 Secondly, comparison of UV-Vis spectra for P3HT:TIPS-pentacene blends in Fig. 6B to that of drop-cast and spin-coated TIPS-pentacene films on ZnO (Supporting Information Fig. S2A) shows that TIPS-pentacene in the ZnO/P3HT:TIPS-pentacene is less crystalline than the drop-cast films for which high in-plane mobilities have been reported in TFTs.29–33 Similar OPV devices using anthradithiophene derivatives as the electron donor demonstrated that Jsc correlated with the percentage of crystalline domains in the device.43 Finally, mobilities for organic semiconductors in OPVs are typically much lower than those measured in TFTs due to the lower charge carrier density under OPV operating conditions.44 Low hole mobility can also explain published results on C60/TIPS-pentacene bilayer devices.34,35
Conclusions
In summary, electronic properties for organic and hybrid photovoltaic devices have been determined under ambient environment similar to device fabrication conditions. Trends in the Voc measured for ZnO/P3HT, PCBM:P3HT and ZnO/TIPS-pentacene:P3HT solar cells agree well with the energy level alignments derived from KP and PESA measurements. While the band alignments indicate that TIPS-pentacene should function as an electron donor when paired with PCBM or ZnO, we show that the poor hole conductivity in the spin-coated TIPS-pentacene films renders very low photocurrent for these systems. By mixing P3HT with TIPS-pentacene to transport holes in the ZnO/TIPS-pentacene solar cells, we successfully fabricated functioning photovoltaic devices. EQE spectra of these devices show a definitive current contribution from TIPS-pentacene absorption, confirming that the ZnO/TIPS-pentacene interface is capable of generating charge. The ability to construct band alignment diagrams for solid state films used in actual devices helps to screen new materials for organic electronic devices and to understand their limiting factors.
