    , Accepted 15th March 2018First published on 11th April 2018AbstractBoth efficiency and stability are two essential performance factors in hybrid halide perovskite solar cells, which are closely related to the ionic defects at the surface and grain boundary of the absorber films. To passivate these defects, we propose a derivative of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with an amino-group (NH2-POSS) to modify perovskite films. It successfully reduces the charge trap density and trap-state energy level (0.045 eV) as obtained by temperature-dependent admittance measurements, eventually leading to the enhancement of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 18.1% to 20.5% in the corresponding devices. Moreover, trap passivation also significantly enhances the stability of the devices, wherein the PCE of perovskite solar cells exhibits 20% degradation in a N2 atmosphere for 1000 h. The introduction of NH2-POSS suggests a feasible alternative solution for defect passivation to further improve both the efficiency and intrinsic stability of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites (PVSKs) have emerged as fascinating semiconductors thanks to their superior optoelectronic properties, e.g. high absorption coefficient,1 long carrier lifetime,2 and high charge carrier mobility.3 The PCE of perovskite solar cells has been rapidly boosted from 3.8% initially to 22.7% (certified PCE),4–11 comparable to those of crystalline silicon and thin film solar cells. Perovskite crystals, like most other ionic materials,12 contain under-coordinated ions as defects at their crystal surfaces and also at their grain boundaries in polycrystalline films, serving as Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination centers.13 The properties of defects, especially point defects in absorbers play a critical role in determining the photo-carrier diffusion length in solar cells. Although they may not dramatically reduce the device photocurrent output, they would significantly impact the VOC of devices due to their energy disorder, which would result in a reduced carrier concentration affecting the quasi-Fermi level splitting.14,15 Furthermore, these defects are recognized to be correlated with device instability, including ion migration, J–V hysteresis, and device degradation under working conditions.16 The intrinsic instability of perovskite materials may limit their practical applications.17–21 Therefore improving their stability by defect passivation extends the use of perovskite devices in an ambient atmosphere, which promotes the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics.22 Research on large area perovskite solar cells has a great influence on industrialization. Anita W. Y. Ho-Baillie and his cooperators have successfully demonstrated that the efficiency of 16 cm2 perovskite solar cells is independently certified to be 12%.23 Aldo Di Carlo and his colleagues successfully used graphene and related two dimensional materials to realize 50.6 cm2 perovskite-based solar modules and achieved a record high power conversion efficiency of 12.6%.24 It is essential to control the defects/traps in the absorber, which improves the uniformity of the film and thus the yield of the device.
It was recently reported that the surface trap density of the PVSK film was estimated to be substantially higher than that of the bulk.25 Passivation of defects at the film surface becomes critical when the charge recombination inside the PVSK layer is negligible. To witness the development of PCE enhancement, it is now important to reduce charge-recombination loss at the surface/grain boundary of the photoactive layer.13,26–28 So far, different passivation molecules have been reported to act as donors or acceptors that can interact with the charged defects of PVSKs, and annihilate relevant defect induced charge traps.29,30 Take thiophene or pyridine as an example, they usually act as electron donors, which could bind to positively charged under-coordinated Pb2+ ions.13 Recently, Huang developed techniques to passivate both positively and negatively charged defects by using quaternary ammonium halide anions and cations,26 and improved efficiency and stability of solar cells were observed. However, these molecular agents are often in low molecular weight and thus are volatile. Some of them are easy to decompose, which casts a serious doubt regarding their long-term stability when incorporated during device operation.
Here, we propose a different chemical motif, namely, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), which possesses a cage-like hybrid structure, exhibiting excellent chemical stability and optical properties.31,32 By chemical modification, the anchoring amino-group (NH2-POSS) is attached to interact with the Pb–I framework through coordination with Pb2+ ions or hydrogen bonding with iodide ions.13,27,33,34 Upon the surface treatment of NH2-POSS, it effectively passivates the crystal surfaces of mixed halide perovskites, MAxFA1−xPbI3−yBry. It was observed that NH2-POSS passivation remarkably reduced the trap density, and trap-state energy level, and prolonged the carrier lifetime. This consequently enhanced the VOC of perovskite planar heterojunction solar cells with PCE increasing from 18.5% to 19.6% on average, and resulted in a champion PCE of 20.55% in NH2-POSS modified devices. Moreover, this strategy can also enhance the intrinsic stability of PVSK devices, which can maintain 80% of the initial PCE after 1000 h in a N2 atmosphere with Ag electrodes.
Results and discussion
The chemical structure of NH2-POSS is shown in Fig. 1a, which is commercially available. We first investigated the LUMO–HOMO energies of NH2-POSS. The HOMO energies of the NH2-POSS were calculated to be −5.0 eV through cyclic voltammetry measurements, whose redox curve is shown in ESI Fig. 1.† The optical bandgap of the NH2-POSS was obtained via UV-vis absorption, which was 4.01 eV as shown in ESI Fig. 2.† Therefore, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels are −1.99 eV and −5.0 eV (Fig. 1b), respectively. NH2-POSS was dissolved in chlorobenzene and introduced onto perovskite films through a spin-coating method as shown in Fig. 1c (see the Experimental section for details).

(b) The diagram of energy band alignment in perovskite solar cells in this study. (c) The schematic illustration of the surface modification process with NH2-POSS. 
The introduction of NH2-POSS did not bring an apparent change in bulk perovskite materials. The NH2-POSS modified perovskite films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements first. The XRD patterns of perovskite samples modified with different concentrations of NH2-POSS were carefully examined (ESI Fig. 3†). We observed the same XRD patterns among all samples, which suggested that the modifier does not change the crystal structure of the perovskite polycrystalline film.35 The film morphology of the perovskite films upon NH2-POSS modification was further checked by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (ESI Fig. 4†). Simply, we didn't observe apparent differences among all samples treated with different concentrations of NH2-POSS. To find out the presence and distribution of NH2-POSS, the samples were further investigated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 2. EDS mapping confirmed that NH2-POSS was uniformly distributed on the perovskite film, wherein both Si and N elements were dispersed in an even manner (Fig. 2a).

Information regarding the presence of NH2-POSS and its chemical bonding was further extracted by XPS measurements. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, new peaks of Pb 4f and I 3d appeared in the NH2-POSS modified samples. At the peaks of Pb 4f (e.g. 620.35 and 632.02 eV), shoulder peaks at higher binding energy were clearly deconvoluted. Similar results were observed in I 3d peaks at 139.90 and 144.78 eV with the emergence of shoulder peaks at higher binding energy. This reveals that NH2-POSS is attached to the perovskite film surface via the stronger interaction between the amino anchoring group and the Pb–I lattice.13,27
Device performance
The photovoltaic performance of devices based on the perovskite absorber with NH2-POSS modification has been substantially improved. Solar cells were fabricated adopting the structure of In-doped SnO2 (ITO)/SnO2/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD)/Au. Here the photo-active layers of MAxFA1−xPbI3−yBry were formed by the interdiffusion of the lead iodide (PbI2) layer and an organic layer of methylammonium iodide, formamidine iodide, methylammonium chloride and methylammonium bromide mixture in a low-temperature two-step procedure.35 Subsequently, NH2-POSS molecules were loaded to attach them to the perovskite layer through their amino-group, leaving the cage-like hydrophobic part outside.27 The distribution of photovoltaic parameters of devices based on different concentration NH2-POSS modified layers is shown in ESI Fig. 9† and summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† It shows that the passivation concentration of NH2-POSS affects the final device performance. With increasing concentration of NH2-POSS, the device showed increasing PCE, which reached the peak value at 10 mg mL−1. Further increasing the concentration of NH2-POSS resulted in the decrease of device performance, which is probably due to poor carrier behavior across the interface between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL). 10 mg mL−1 NH2-POSS modification resulted in the best device performance in this study (Table 1).

The current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices with/without NH2-POSS modification are shown in Fig. 3a. The champion device showed a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 23.11 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.02 V, a fill factor (FF) of 70.11%, and a PCE of 20.55%, as compared to that of a reference of 18.14%. The stabilized power output as a function of time was measured at a voltage of 0.90 V, exhibiting a stabilized PCE of 18.9% over 250 s as shown in Fig. 3b. The measurement details can be found in the Experimental section. The external quantum efficiency spectra of the NH2-POSS modified solar cell are shown in Fig. 3c. The EQE values are mostly above 80% among the entire absorption range, indicating good carrier behavior across the resultant devices, as will be discussed in the following paragraph. And the integrated current reached 21.86 mA cm−2, which is in close approximation to J–V measurements. In the spectral range of 300 nm to 350 nm, there is already a strong spectral response, which is likely attributed to the employment of SnO2 as the electron transport layer. As compared to the reference, the device performance enhancement upon NH2-POSS modification was mainly attributed to the increased VOC. Fig. 3d shows the VOC distribution of the devices with/without NH2-POSS, and the average VOC values are 1.02 and 1.08 V, respectively. Particularly, the highest VOC of the NH2-POSS modified device reaches 1.13 V, wherein the VOC loss is as low as 0.38 V. In order to check the reproducibility of the device performance, the PCE histogram distribution of 16 cells with/without NH2-POSS modification is provided, which is shown in ESI Fig. 9.† The PCE of NH2-POSS modification ranges from 16% to 20% and in most devices efficiencies are greater than 18%. In contrast, most devices without NH2-POSS modification exhibit lower PCE. The PCE distribution roughly follows the Gauss distribution, indicating the effectiveness and reproducibility of NH2-POSS modification. In addition, we investigated loading solvents for NH2-POSS treatment, wherein both isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and chlorobenzene (CB) can dissolve the molecule well. The device performance distribution is shown in ESI Fig. 10.† It shows that CB based devices have better device performance than IPA based ones. This indicates that IPA is not a good solvent for NH2-POSS to modify perovskite films, possibly due to its high tendency of protonation.

(d) Histogram of VOC distribution in perovskite solar cells with/without NH2-POSS modification. 
In order to understand the enhancement of VOC in mixed perovskite solar cells upon NH2-POSS passivation, we performed optical and electrical characterizations on perovskite films and relevant devices. First, we carried out photoluminescence (PL) characterization for the control and NH2-POSS-passivated perovskite films deposited on glass substrates. As shown in Fig. 4a, the PL peaks for both samples are located at the same wavelength of 779 nm without an apparent shift as previously reported,35 indicating that the perovskite films maintained the same crystal phase and composition upon NH2-POSS treatment. However, the PL intensity of the sample with NH2-POSS passivation increased by about 2 times with respect to that without modification, which was likely due to the reduction of trap density. Interestingly, we noticed that the PL peaks were asymmetric in both samples, wherein a shoulder peak at a higher wavelength of 810 nm was observed. It may be ascribed to the phase separation in the mixed perovskite films, which was also observed in the FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite thin film samples made by a two-step deposition method according to the literature.7

Meanwhile, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were further conducted to confirm the reduction of trap density. In Fig. 4b, an increased perovskite bulk carrier lifetime (τ2) from 298.05 ns to 433.87 ns by NH2-POSS treatment is observed, which was calculated by applying the double exponential fitting on the decay curves. The result was in good agreement with the steady-state PL measurements, suggesting that recombination centers are effectively reduced after NH2-POSS modification on perovskite films. In addition, we further probe the recombination process of free charge carriers in the devices via transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements, transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). TPV measurements are correlated with the electron lifetime in the absorber upon irradiation at reverse bias, which provides insight into carrier recombination dynamics in the context of the entire device.6 We compared the time dependence of VOC decay in both the sample and the reference (Fig. 4c). Clearly, VOC decayed slower in the device based on the NH2-POSS modified absorber, and the decay time was 3.90 μs as compared to that of the reference of 2.63 μs. This indicates that the passivation treatment has effectively prohibited the trap-assisted recombination process, in accordance with the PL and TRPL results. TPC measurements were often used to monitor the carrier transport across the device.6 As shown in Fig. 4d, the devices with NH2-POSS passivation exhibited faster photocurrent decay (1.57 μs) than control devices (2.65 μs). This indicates that carrier transport in devices was improved by NH2-POSS modification. The surface recombination in the perovskite solar cells upon NH2-POSS passivation was also characterized by using EIS,36,37 which is shown in ESI Fig. 7† and the inset is the simplified equivalent circuit diagram. In EIS measurements, 0.8 V bias was applied under constant illumination when the device impedance was obtained as a function of frequency. We observed two distinct regimes in the Nyquist plot, and the fitting result of the equivalence circuit is shown in Table S3,† which reveals that the NH2-POSS modified devices have a much larger surface impedance. This result was in good agreement with that from the TPV measurements, suggesting that the density of recombination centers is effectively reduced after NH2-POSS modification at the surface of the perovskite films.
The reduction of defect density in the perovskite thin films with NH2-POSS modification is further confirmed. We first monitored space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs) in capacitor-like devices, wherein the perovskite films (MAPbI3) with/without NH2-POSS treatment were sandwiched between ITO and gold (Fig. 5a). We can see three evident regions in both curves of the sample and reference. At low voltages, the I–V response is ohmic. At intermediate voltages, the trap states are filled by the injected carriers and the voltage VTFL is linearly proportional to the density of trap states Ndefects.38 The I–V curves are consistent with previous results.38,39 The defect density (Ndefects) was calculated according to the equation (Ndefects = 2εε0VTFL/eL2), which was estimated to be 1.3 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.0 × 1016 cm−3 for the control and NH2-POSS passivated samples, respectively. This indicates that the passivation treatment has effectively decreased the defect density.

Admittance spectra of the control (b) and NH2-POSS modification devices (c) measured at temperatures between 130 K and 290 K with a step of 20 K. (d) The corresponding Arrhenius plots of the characteristic transition frequencies determined from the derivation of the admittance spectra. 
Moreover, admittance spectroscopy (AS) was conducted on the devices. AS is an effective technique for estimating both the energy level of the trap stage and the distribution of trap state density, and has been extensively applied to perovskite solar cells.40–42 For a p-type perovskite semiconductor, the defect activation energy (Ea) is approximately the depth of the trap state energy level (ET) relative to the VB energy level (EVB) of the perovskite (Ea = ET − EVB),41Ea and the characteristic transition angular frequency (ω0) can be expressed using the relation , ω0 is determined by the derivative of the capacitance-frequency spectrum, whereas β is a temperature dependent parameter, T is the temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The value of Ea can be obtained from the slope of the plot line. Fig. 5b and c display the temperature-dependent admittance spectra of devices measured at various temperatures (T = 130–290 K) in the dark from 10 to 105 Hz. The corresponding Arrhenius plots of the characteristic transition frequencies determined from the derivative of the admittance spectra are shown in Fig. 5d, and the calculated Ea in the control and NH2-POSS passivated samples is 0.115 and 0.045 eV, respectively, which is the lowest value measured by admittance spectroscopy so far. This indicates that passivation can effectively reduce the trap-state energy level. This is in line with our SCLC measurements, indicating NH2-POSS can effectively passivate the trap states.
On the whole, the optical and electric characterization results all suggest that NH2-POSS modification effectively passivates defects and reduces the recombination centers. The possible mechanism for the trap state passivation may follow a similar principle through the interaction between the amino anchoring group and the Pb–I lattice,13,27 which reduces the under-coordinated Pb sites substantially. This defect passivation not only improves the device performance, but also boosts the long-term stability of the device, as discussed in the following.
Although the PCE of perovskite solar cells has greatly improved in recent years, long-term stability is an essential prerequisite for commercialization. Currently, many studies have reported on the device lifetime under continuous operating conditions of constant light exposure at maximum power output.24 Some new materials have been applied as carrier transport layers in devices, such as CuSCN and MoS,43,44 showing the potential for industrial employment. We compared the stability of complete devices based on reference films and NH2-POSS modified perovskite films, which were evaluated under a N2 atmosphere in the dark without any encapsulation.
Here, we tried to exclude external stress that may cause aging, so that the intrinsic stability of the device is probed. During a stability test for 1200 h, the reference devices severely degraded, whereas devices with NH2-POSS modification remained almost unchanged visually compared to reference devices. Fig. 6 shows the improved stability of the device with NH2-POSS modification, which maintained an 80% PCE45 of the initial efficiency of the fresh device for 1000 h. Since devices are tested without other extrinsic stress (e.g. oxygen, light, heat, etc.), it is indicated that the intrinsic device durability is significantly improved. The enhancement of intrinsic stability was achieved probably due to the steric effects caused by the bulky POSS ammonium cations prohibiting ion migration and/or electrode diffusion, which is under investigation now.

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a new category agent of NH2-POSS to passivate perovskite thin films. Such modification can successfully improve the intrinsic stability of devices (mainly the shelf lifetime), while at the same time enhancing their electronic properties, enabling the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to be over 19% (on average). The improvement of the efficiency is ascribed to the NH2-POSS passivation at the surface and grain boundaries, which decreases the carrier recombination, and thus enhances the VOC of the device. These findings elucidate the molecular passivation principles to achieve simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability, which is critical for advancing the material optimization processes toward practical applications of perovskite solar cells.

All reagents were used as received without further purification, including PbI2 (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), aminomethane (CP Beijing Chemical Works), Spiro-OMeTAD (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.), N,N-dimethylformamide (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethanol (AR Beijing Chemical Works), HI (57%, Alfa Aesar), 4-tert-butylpyridine (99.9%, SigmaAldrich), chlorobenzene (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), and ITO substrates. Methylamine iodide (CH3NH3I), formamidine iodide (HC(NH2)2I), methylamine chlorine (CH3NH3Cl) and methylamine bromine (CH3NH3Br) were prepared according to the reported procedure.46
Surface functionalization and solar cell fabrication
An ITO substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone detergent solution, deionized water and isopropanol successively. After 30 minutes of UV-O3 treatment, a 40 nm-thick layer of a SnO2 film was spin coated on the substrate with a SnO2 colloidal solution and annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. 600 mg of PbI2 was dissolved in 922 μL of DMF and 78 μL of DMSO at 70 °C. 40 mg HC(NH2)2I, 19 mg CH3NH3I, 6 mg CH3NH3Br and 5 mg CH3NH3Cl were dissolved in 1 mL IPA. The PbI2 solution was deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. After the PbI2 coated substrate was cooled to room temperature (25 °C) in a nitrogen glovebox, a solution composed of HC(NH2)2I, CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br, and CH3NH3Cl was deposited by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s in a nitrogen glovebox and dried at 150 °C for 15 min in air (relative humidity 30%). PbI2 was in excess in perovskite films, we can see a feature peak of PbI2 in XRD patterns. The excess PbI2 is beneficial to the performance of devices.
For amine modification, 50 μL of 3 vol% NH2-POSS solution in chlorobenzene was dropped onto the perovskite substrate, immediately followed by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealing at 100 °C for 5 min to completely remove the solvent.
The HTM solution was then deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The HTM solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-dimethoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) (spiro-MeOTAD), 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL chlorobenzene (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich). It is important to note that the samples in this work were aged under pure oxygen conditions for ∼12 hours. Finally, the counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation of gold under a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area was 0.102 cm2. The as-fabricated device consists of five functional layers, including a 150 nm thick ITO electrode, 40 nm SnO2, 500 nm perovskite, 200 nm spiro-OMeTAD, and 100 nm gold.
Characterization
Cyclic voltammogram measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (shanghai HUACHEN, CHI 760E). The cyclic voltammogram of NH2-POSS in CH2Cl2 was obtained at a Pt electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and T = 25 °C; the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453). Dynamic light scattering measurements were performed using a 90Plus PALS (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained using a PANalytical X-ray Diffractometer. The morphology and elemental distribution were measured using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S4800). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on an STARPES system (SPECS) with a monochromatic SPEXS XR-MF Microwave X-ray source (Al Kα = 1486.7 eV). Elemental analyses were performed by using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Leeman PROFILE SPEC) instrument. The current density–voltage characteristics of photovoltaic devices were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The photocurrent was measured under AM1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1000 W solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. The effective area of each cell was 0.102 cm2 defined by masks for all the photovoltaic devices discussed in this work. Current density–voltage measurements were carried out at room temperature. The reverse scan condition is the voltage sweep range from 1.2 V to −0.2 V, the delay time is 0.001 s, and the active area of the mask is 0.102 cm2 which is consistent with functional cells. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were determined on a solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QER) provided by Enli Technology Co., Ltd. A calibrated silicon diode with a known spectral response was used as a reference. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was obtained by using an FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 465 nm. Transient-state photoluminescence (TRPL) was measured by using an FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with an excitation at 470 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by using an electrochemical workstation (Germany, Zahner Company). EIS spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 °C) in the dark at different applied biases (0–1.2 V). The frequency range of 0.1–1 MHz with an AC perturbation signal of 20 mV was employed in all EIS measurements. Transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) decay measurements were performed on a Molex 180081-4320 simulating one sun working conditions. Admittance spectroscopy (AS) was performed by using an electrochemical workstation (Germany, Zahner Company) at various temperatures (T = 130–290 K) in the dark from 10 to 106 Hz. A small AC voltage of 20 mV was used, and the DC bias was kept at zero during the measurements. Temperature-dependent measurements were conducted using a liquid nitrogen cryostat (110-637-DND) with an ITC controller and capacitance–frequency scans were taken at every 20 K.
