    AbstractTwo new heterobimetallic phenylmercury(II) dithiocarbamate complexes incorporating the ferrocenyl moiety (C5H5)Fe(C5H4) (Fc), namely PhHgS2CN(CH2Fc)CH2C5H4N, (1) and PhHgS2CN(CH2Fc)CH2C4H3O, (2) have been prepared and characterized by elemental analysis, UV-Vis, IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. The crystal structures of 1 and 2 showed a linear core at the Hg(II) centre of the molecule, bound by the sulfur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand and carbon atom of the aromatic ring. Weak intermolecular Hg⋯S interactions form “head-to-tail” dimers in the cases of 1 and 2. The observed quasi-reversible cyclic voltammograms of the complexes have been corroborated by calculating gross natural electron population and gross natural electron spin population at each atom for the neutral as well its oxidized species obtained at density functional level (DFT) of theory, which suggests that the delocalization of electron spin population can affect the magnitude of ΔEp. The electronic absorption bands of both the complexes were assigned with the help of time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The light harvesting properties of both 1 and 2 in conjunction with our previously reported compound PhHgS2CN(CH2Fc)CH2C6H5 (3) have been reported.
Introduction
Metal complexes with sulfur rich ligands are very interesting from the viewpoint of their electrical conductivity, molecular magnetism, electrochemical properties, biological processes and optoelectronic properties.1 The polydentate2 and ferrocene containing3 dithiocarbamate ligands, because of their versatile coordination chemistry and material properties2e have emerged as one of the most active area of research in chemistry in recent years. Organomercury dithiocarbamate complexes have been found to be an extremely versatile group for supramolecular arrays and exhibited photoluminescence emission.4,5
The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are presently one of the most active areas of research for the chemist.6,7 This is because of the fact that they serve as an alternative to the silicon-based photovoltaic devices for the utilization of solar energy.6,7 To date a variety of dye-stuffs and frameworks have been pursued to replace the silicon-based photovoltaic devices.6–12 The “state-of-art” dye-sensitized solar cells developed by Grätzel having spectral sensitization of a wide band gap semiconductor continues to be one of the most efficient “next generation” technologies with power conversion efficiencies (η) in excess of 10%.8 An ideal DSSC comprises of a nanoparticulate semiconductor substrate such as TiO2 or ZnO functionalized with a dye-stuff. Also, the ideal dye should absorb as much visible light as possible, have redox potentials appropriately matched to the semiconductor and electrolyte for electron injection and regeneration, respectively, and sustain numerous redox turnovers under light irradiation.9
With an objective to search for efficient sensitizers many new commercial10 and synthetic dyes (organic compounds and inorganic metal complexes)11 have been studied for spectral sensitization of wide band gap semiconductor electrodes. Owing to limited resources, the high cost and environmentally unfriendly nature of noble ruthenium metal, other metal complexes are also assessed for their possible use as photosensitizers in DSSC.12
Inspired by these points, recently we had reported the light harvesting properties of transition metal dithiocarbamate complexes having a ferrocenyl moiety.13 Here also only the square-planar complexes having Ni(II), Pd(II), Pt(II) and Cu(II) metal cores have shown better power conversion efficiencies. It was concluded that in these trans square planar complexes one of the ferrocenyl moieties was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface whilst another acts as the antenna to harness the light energy. Therefore, it was thought to replace the transition metal cation with the phenylmercury(II) cation where the d10 Hg(II) center having a good photophysical property,14 could thereby transfer sunlight energy to the ferrocene adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The results of these investigations are presented herein.
Results and discussions
General aspects
The phenylmercury(II) ferrocenyldithiocarbamate complexes were prepared in accordance with Scheme 1. The ferrocenyl-functionalised secondary amines were obtained by condensation of the aldehyde functionalized ferrocene and an amine containing heteroaromatic ring to give the corresponding imine, followed by its subsequent reduction. From these ferrocenyl containing secondary amines, the potassium salts of dithiocarbamate ligands were prepared using KOH and carbon disulfide in equimolar ratio. The portionwise addition of phenylmercuric acetate to the methanol solution of the dithiocarbamate ligands gave orange solids. Both the compounds were air stable and characterized by IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and their structures elucidated by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The single crystals of all the complexes were obtained by the slow evaporation of dichloromethane–methanol mixtures.
 Scheme 1 
Spectroscopy
The IR spectra of both the complexes displayed distinct vibrational bands at 1029–1103 and 1078–1025 cm−1 that can be assigned to a ν(CS2) vibration. This splitting of the ν(CS2) is attributed to monodentate coordination of the sulfur atom of the ligand to the PhHg moiety. The bands in the 1416–1471 cm−1 region for these complexes are associated primarily with the thioureide vibration and can be assigned to ν(CN).
The purity and composition of both the compounds have been checked by NMR spectroscopy. Both the compounds display sharp 1H NMR signals which integrate well to the corresponding hydrogens. The signals observed at around δ 5.08 and 3.51 ppm are assigned to the methylene protons of the methylpyridyl and furan ring group respectively attached directly to the nitrogen center. The signals at δ 4.86 ppm for 1 and δ 6.39 ppm for 2 belong to the methylene group attached directly to the cyclopentadinene (Cp) ring. Besides this the signals lying in the δ 4.18–4.86 ppm range are assigned to the protons of the Cp ring. A perceptible shift of ∼10 ppm in the 13C spectrum for C–S2 carbon in all the complexes as compared to the free dithio ligands indicates the M–S bonding in the complexes.
Crystal structure
The immediate geometry around the Hg atom in the complexes 1 and 2 is defined by the ipso-C atom of the phenyl group and the S(1) of the dithiocarbamate ligand for 1 and 2 (Fig. 1 and 2). The Hg(1)–S(1) bond length for 1 and 2 are 2.402(3) and 2.397(3) Å, respectively. These bond distances are significantly shorter than the Hg(1)⋯S(2) distance of 2.958(3) and 2.981(3) Å for 1 and 2 respectively. This indicates the propensity of the Hg to exist in the linear coordination mode. However, the proximity of S(2) around Hg(1) for 1 and 2 is partly responsible for the deviation from the ideal linear geometry, as indicated in the C(19)–Hg(1)–S(1) bond angle of 168.5(3)° in 1, C(18)–Hg(1)–S(1) bond angle of 166.3(3)° in 2. These bond lengths and angles are in close agreement with that of the previously reported complexes (Table 1). Within the dithiocarbamate function, C–Ndtc bond lengths of 1.319(14) and 1.320(13) Å for 1 and 2 respectively, indicate a substantial delocalization of the π-electron density in these bonds.15 The cyclopentadienyl rings in the ferrocenyl fragment are planar and nearly parallel with dihedral angles of 4.72° and 2.10° for 1 and 2, respectively. The Fe–Cpring distance in both the complexes are 1.64 Å whereas the intermetallic Hg⋯Fe distances are 8.118 and 8.117 Å, for 1 and 2 respectively.

 Fig. 1  Perspective view of the molecular structure of 1. Hydrogen atoms have been removed for clarity. 
As reported previously,4,5 the intermolecular S(2)⋯Hg′ secondary interactions16 having distances of 3.181 Å (sym. op: 2−x, −y, 1−z) for 1 and 3.174 Å (sym. op: 2−x, 1−y, 2−z) for 2 join the molecules into dimers (Fig. 3 and 4). These Hg⋯S secondary interactions are comparable to the sum of van der Waal radii of the respective elements (rvdw(Hg) = 1.73–2.00 Å and rvdw(S) = 1.80 Å) and lie well in the range of the other dimeric organomercury dithiocarbamates (Table 1).4,5 As reported previously4b these dimers are “head to tail” with respect to each other, but these do not form chains of dimers as observed in phenylmercury(II) dithiocarbamates4a,5 containing only organic fragments. Also, the incorporation of heteroaromatic groups pyridyl in 1 and furan in 2 doesn't generate new supramolecular frameworks in these compounds.

Electrochemical investigation
The electrochemical properties of both the complexes along with one of our previously reported complexes4b PhHgS2CN(CH2Fc)CH2C6H5 (3) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solution (Table 2). As expected the redox-active ferrocenyl group exhibits a single quasi reversible oxidation wave with formal redox potentials E°' = 0.26, 0.27 and 0.37 V for 1, 2 and 3 respectively (Fig. 5 and 6). As compared to the ferrocene standard (E°' = 0.19 V), the potentials for the three complexes anodically shifted thereby suggesting an electron withdrawing effect of the phenylmercury(II)-dithiocarbamate moiety on the ferrocene unit.

In order to ascertain the extent of spin delocalization with the value of the electrochemical parameter ΔEp for these complexes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on all three complexes as well as on their 1e− oxidized species. The natural electron spin population at Fe atom in the 1 e− oxidized species of 1, 2 and 3 are 1.186, 1.093 and 1.101, respectively. These values clearly indicate that during oxidation the electron is released mainly from the Fe atom center. The spin density surface plots for the 1e− oxidized species indicate the delocalization of unpaired electron(s) from the Fe atom up to the phenylmercury(II) (Fig. 7). The gross natural electron spin population of PhHgC5H5NCH2N(CH2)CS2, PhHgC4H3OCH2N(CH2)CS2 and PhHgC6H5CH2N(CH2)CS2 (3) fragments in their oxidized species are 0.115, 0.102 and 0.107 a.u., respectively. The extent of spin delocalization can be correlated with the value of an electrochemical parameter, ΔEp. The smaller the value of ΔEp, the faster is the electron transfer. The ΔEp values for the complexes 1, 2 and 3 are 0.074, 0.128, 0.115 V, respectively at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. We observe that the larger the delocalization of the electron natural spin population at the fragment other than the ferrocene moiety, the smaller the ΔEp value, i.e., the faster the electron transfer. In other words the delocalization of the electron natural spin population on the fragment other than the ferrocene moiety in the oxidized species facilitates the reduction of the oxidized species to the neutral complex. The gross natural electron populations and gross natural electron spin population for the complexes and their oxidized species are presented in Table 3.

 Fig. 7  Electronic absorption spectrum of the complexes recorded in 10−3 M dichloromethane solution. 
Electronic absorption spectra
The electronic absorption spectra of the complexes recorded in the dichloromethane solution display bands at about 440, 300, 260 and 235 nm. In all three complexes the first lower energy band at ∼440 nm arises due to the d–d transition from the dz2 orbital of Fe with an admixture of orbitals of the Cp ring in all cases and the aromatic group. The next band at about 300 nm is ascribed to the charge transfer from the lone pair of the sulfur atoms to the thioureide group. The higher energy bands at 260 and 235 nm arise because of the intraligand charge transfer transitions from the lone pair of the coordinated and uncoordinated sulfur atoms to the aromatic ring of the organomercury and thioureide group.
Light harvesting property

Optical property. 
The primary requisite for a dye to act as a photosensitizer for wide band-gap semiconductors is absorption in the visible range of the solar spectrum. The absorption spectra shown in Fig. 7 displays bands at 422, 439 and 429 nm for complexes 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

Energy level diagram
The mutual positions of the electron transfer energy levels of the cell components (semiconductor electrode, dye, and redox couple) are very crucial for feasibility and sustainability of the processes required to occur at the semiconductor electrode on its illumination with light for achieving light-to-elecrical energy conversion. In order to visualize this aspect, an energy level diagram, as shown in Fig. 8 for complex 1, has been constructed. Various energy levels were determined as follows: The lower edge of the conduction band of the semiconductor electrode (Ec) was obtained from the current–potential curve. The potential of the photocurrent onset (−0.630 V), obtained from the current–potential curve (Fig. 10), was taken as the flat band potential (Vfb) of the TiO2 semiconductor electrode, which provided the position of the Fermi level at the surface of the semiconductor electrode under flat band conditions. Assuming the conduction band edge (Ec) at ∼ 0.1 eV above the Fermi level, we got Ec = −0.730V vs. Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile, ACN). Taking the band gap of TiO2 as 3.2 eV, the upper edge of the valence band of the TiO2 electrode is evaluated to be Ev = +2.470 V.

 Fig. 10  Photocurrent action spectra obtained with the use of complexes 1, 2, and 3 as photosensitizers. 
Further the redox potential of the complex (determined from CV), (E0D+/D), provided the electron exchange energy level of the dye molecules in its ground state. The λmax obtained from the absorption spectrum was used to determine the excitation energy (hν) which on addition to the ground level energy (E0D+/D) provided the electron exchange energy level of the excited dye molecules (E0D+/D). The redox potential of I−/I2 was taken as 0.4 V vs. NHE and 0.18 V vs. Ag/Ag+ (ACN) from literature.17 The formal redox potentials (E0′) of the complexes 1, 2 and 3 were taken as +0.258, +0.271 and +0.370 V respectively. These values when combined with excitation energies (hν) of the respective dyes, gave the excited state energy levels as −2.67, −2.54 and −2.51 V for complexes 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
The energy level diagram (Fig. 8) shows that the excited dye molecules (D*) can transfer electrons to the conduction band of TiO2 and the resulting oxidized species (D+) can accept electrons from the reduced species of the redox couple (I3−) and get converted to its original form D (dye regeneration). Thus, the positions of different electron transfer energy levels seems to be appropriate thermodynamically for the feasibility and also sustainability of the cell processes.
Photoelectrochemical studies

Current–potential curves. 
The current–potential curves for different two-electrode cells were obtained using a Bi-potentiostat in conjunction with an e-corder. Fig. 9 shows such curves for TiO2 electrode-based cells sensitized by different complexes (1, 2, and 3) and N719 (for comparison) under illumination with visible light ((λ > 420 nm). In the dark, the current obtained at the dye-capped TiO2 electrodes was almost negligible. Under visible light (470 mW cm−2) illumination, the short-circuit photo-currents around 7.88, 7.32 and 7.02 mA cm−2 were obtained with the use of the complexes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These values are quite close to the short circuit photo-current (8.95 mA cm−2) obtained when TiO2 was sensitized by N719 (Table 4). This is quite a significant achievement. The photocurrent obtained on illumination of the dye-coated semiconductor electrodes by visible light (λ > 420 nm) can be assigned exclusively to charge carrier injection by photo excited dye molecules, since visible light of sub band-gap energy can't excite the semiconductor electrode (TiO2).

Photocurrent action spectrum (IPCE-λ)
In order to ascertain unambiguously the sensitization of photocurrent by the dyes under investigation, the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) spectra of bare and dye modified TiO2 electrodes were determined. From the values of Jsc and the intensity of the corresponding monochromatic light (Iinc), the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was calculated at each excitation wavelength (λ) using the following relation:  (1)
The (IPCE vs.λ) plots (action spectra) thus obtained for TiO2 electrodes coated with different complexes (1, 2, and 3) are shown in Fig. 10. The close resemblance of the absorption spectrum of the complex with the respective action spectrum confirms the sensitization of the photocurrent by dye. Further, in each case the maximum in IPCE is observed at the same wavelength λmax as of the complex. This indicates that there is no aggregation of the complex molecules on the surface of the TiO2 film. The maximum IPCE values observed at the characteristic wavelengths of the complexes are 47, 42, and 40% for complexes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These IPCE values obtained under short-circuit conditions can be increased if the semiconductor photoanode is externally biased with positive potential.

Transient photocurrent–time profile. 
The transient current–time profiles were recorded to know the sustainability of the photocurrent observed initially on illumination of the semiconductor electrode. For such an assessment, the short circuit current was monitored with the passage of time, keeping the semiconductor electrode initially in the dark, then under visible light illumination, and finally in the dark again. The results of these measurements for cells sensitized by different dyes are shown in Fig. 11. These current–time (J–t) profiles clearly show that on illumination of the semiconductor electrode, the photocurrent rises sharply but after attaining its highest value it remains constant without any significant decay. From such an observation it can be inferred that the dye regeneration process is fast enough to cope up with the rate of electron injection from the excited dye molecules and there is virtually no problem of recombination of charge carriers.
 Fig. 11  Transient photocurrent–time profiles. 


Power conversion efficiency (η) and fill factor (FF). 
For determining the power output and related parameters of the dye-sensitized PEC cells, the photocurrent–potential curves determined under visible light illumination and shown in Fig. 9 have been used. The power conversion efficiency (η) and fill factor (FF) were evaluated using the following relations:  (2) (3) Here Jmax and Vmax are the photocurrent and potential, respectively, corresponding to maximum power output (Pmax = Jmax× Vmax) and Iinc is the intensity of the incident light. Further, Jsc and Voc are the short circuit photocurrent and open-circuit potential, respectively. The η and FF values calculated from these equations for different cells are given in Table 4.


Dependence of photocurrent on intensity of light. 
The short circuit photocurrent of the cell was determined by illuminating the semiconductor electrode with white light of various intensity (obtained by using neutral density filters) and the results are presented in Fig. 12 for cells sensitized by different complexes (1, 2, and 3). It is to be mentioned here that full (100%) intensity of light was 540 mW cm−2. The linear variation in photocurrent with the intensity of light shows that the recombination of injected charge carriers (electrons) and resulted oxidized dye is almost negligible.

Stability of photocurrent on prolonged operation. 
In order to assess the long-term performance, the photocell sensitized by complex 1 was used. Illuminating the cell with visible light, the short-circuit photocurrent was continuously monitored for about 8 h and the result is shown in Fig. 13. At the end of this period only about a 2% decrease in photocurrent was observed. This proves the satisfactory performance of the cell.

Conclusions
In this work theoretical justifications have been given for the relative magnitude of the ΔEp value in terms of the delocalization effect on the natural electron spin population. Both the complexes along with the previously reported compound PhHgS2CN(CH2Fc)CH2C5H5 showed good light harvesting properties. Also, we have shown that ferrocenyl based complexes may effectively replace ruthenium(II) complexes in DCCSs.
Experimental
General details
Ferrocene carboxaldehyde, potassium hydroxide, phenylmercuric acetate, furfuryl amine, 4-picolyl amine, KOH, (Aldrich) carbon disulfide and triethylamine (Merck) were used as received. The synthesis of all the compounds was carried out under an inert gas atmosphere of nitrogen. Solvents were purified and dried in accordance with the literature procedures.
IR as KBr pellets and 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 3100 FTIR and JEOL AL300 FTNMR spectrophotometers respectively. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million using TMS as internal standard. Elemental analysis were performed on an Exeter analytical Inc. “Model CE-440 CHN analyser”.
A bipotentiostat (AFRDE 4E, Pine, USA), along with an e-corder (model 201, eDAQ, Australia), was used for all current–potential measurements. Cyclic voltammograms of the complexes were obtained with the help of this equipment using a 10−4 M dichloromethane solution of the test complex and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as supporting electrolyte. Ag/Ag+ (in acetonitrile) was used as reference electrode and platinum wire as working electrode.
For PEC measurements, a 150 W xenon arc lamp (Oriel, USA) was used as light source and the semiconductor electrode was illuminated after passing the light beam through a 6 inch long water column (to filter IR) and condensing it with the help of fused silica lenses (Oriel Corporation, USA). This IR-filtered light is referred to as ‘white light’ in the text. For selective excitation of dye only (not TiO2), the UV part of the white light (λ < 420 nm) was cut off with the aid of a long-pass filter (Model No. 51280, Oriel Corporation, USA) and this UV-filtered light is referred to as ‘visible light’. The monochromatic light, when required, was obtained by using a grating monochromator (Oriel Model 77250 equipped with model 7798 grating). The width of the exit slit of the monochromator was kept at 0.5 mm. To obtain the action spectrum (Jphoto − λ) of the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode, monochromatic light-induced photocurrent was measured with a digital multimeter (Philips Model No. 2525). The intensity of light was varied with neutral density filters (model No. 50490-50570, Oriel, USA) and measured with a digital photometer (Tektronix model J16 with model J 6502 sensor). The absorption spectrum of the dye in dichloromethane solution was recorded on a Cary 2390 (Varian) spectrophotometer.

Preparation of the material for DSSC
Acetonitrile (Spectrochem), used as the electrolyte solution, was purified as described earlier.18 Anhydrous Bu4NClO4 (Purum, Fluka) was used as supporting electrolyte, LiI (Aldrich), I2 (BDH) used as a redox couple in PEC experiments were used without any further purification. Dichloromethane (DCM) was used as the medium for cyclic voltammetry. Titanium paste (HT) was used for preparing TiO2 electrode, Platinum catalyst (T/SP) as counter electrode and the sealing agent (SX1170-60, 50 μm) were obtained from Solaronix.

Preparation of TiO2 electrode (photoanode), counter electrode and DSSC assembly. 
TiO2 film electrode (photoanode) was prepared by spreading a highly transparent paste of TiO2 (Titanium-HT) on a conductive glass plate (15 Ω/cm2, Pillkington, USA) by the doctor's blade method and annealing at 450 °C for half an hour in air. The dye was attached to the TiO2 surface by immersing the TiO2 coated electrodes in the solution of dye in methanol for 6 h (Fig. 14). The non-adsorbed dye was washed with anhydrous ethanol. Platinum counter electrode was prepared by deposition of Pt catalyst T/SP paste on another conductive glass and annealed at 400 °C for half an hour in air.
 Fig. 14  Binding to TiO2 of 10−3 M phenylmercury(II) dithiocarbamate complexes with complexes 1, 2 and 3. 
In the DSSC assembly the platinum catalyst-coated counter electrode was placed on the top so that the conductive side of the counter electrode faces the dye coated TiO2 film and the cell was sealed by three sides using spacers leaving one side open for the injection of the electrolyte solution. The iodide electrolyte solution (0.1 M Lithium iodide mixed with 0.01 M iodine in acetonitrile) was placed at the edges of the plates. The liquid was drawn into the space between the electrodes by capillary action. With the help of Araldite the remaining open part of the cell assembly was sealed and the contact was made by copper wire using silver paste and then sealing with Araldite.

Crystallography
Intensity data for the orange crystal of 1 was collected at 105(2) K on a Sapphire2-CCD, OXFORD diffractometer system equipped with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation λ = 0.71073 Å. The final unit cell determination, scaling of the data, and corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects were performed with CrysAlis RED.19 While for orange colored crystals of 2, intensity data were collected at 298(2) K on a Bruker SMART diffractometer system equipped with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation λ = 0.71073 Å. The final unit cell determination, scaling of the data, and corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects were performed with Bruker SAINT.20 A symmetry-related (multi-scan) absorption correction had been applied. Structure solution, followed by full-matrix least squares refinement was performed using the WINGX-1.70 suite21 of programs throughout. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically; hydrogen atoms were located at calculated positions and refined using a riding model with isotropic thermal parameters fixed at 1.2 times the Ueq value of the appropriate carrier atom.

Computational details
In order to ascertain the nature of the redox-active orbitals involved in this oxidation and reduction, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the complex as well as on its 1e− oxidized species. Optimized molecular geometries were calculated using the B3LYP22 exchange–correlation functional. The spin unrestricted DFT method was employed to model the open-shell oxidized species. The TZVP23 basis set for Fe and CEP-121G for Hg atom, while 6-31G** for C, H and N atoms whereas 6-311G** was used for S atom. The optimized structures of the complex and its oxidized species were used for molecular orbital analyses and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations at the same level of theory with the polarized continuum model (PCM).24 The solvent parameters were those of dichloromethane. The energies and intensities of the 30 lowest-energy spin allowed electronic excitations were calculated using TD-DFT. Atomic charges and spin densities were calculated using natural25 population analyses (NPA) as implemented in Gaussian 03 program.26 The spin density plots were constructed with the MOLDEN program.27
