    , Accepted 9th December 2020First published on 10th December 2020AbstractThe van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) has attracted widespread attention as a unique structure for future electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this paper, we constructed the ZnO–SeMoS and ZnO–SMoSe vdWHs and systematically investigated their electronic structures and band alignments considering vertical strain and external electric field effects. It is found that the ZnO–SeMoS and ZnO–SMoSe vdWHs both exhibit type-II band alignment with indirect band gaps of 1.31 and 0.63 eV respectively, depending on the interface characteristics. What's more, the band alignment of these two heterostructures can be tuned to type I or type III, and their band gap can be modified to direct feature by applying vertical strain and an electric field. The results reveal that ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs have promising potential in multi-functional nanodevices, and provide a way to modify the electronic properties of Janus-based heterojunctions using interface characteristics.
1. Introduction
The discovery of graphene has sparked tremendous research on new two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique extraordinary electronic and optical properties.1–10 Among them, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with the formula MX2 (M = Mo,W; X = S, Se, Te) have attracted much attention both in experimental and theoretical research due to their unique structural, chemical and physical properties, which make them have potential use in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, valleytronics and catalysis.11–17
Recently, the Janus TMD MXY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se) monolayers have received increasing attention due to their broken mirror symmetry, which adds another degree of freedom for modulating their properties.18–20 And the Janus MoSSe monolayer has been successfully prepared by two groups using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method in completely different directions: selenization of monolayer MoS2 and sulfurization of monolayer MoSe2.21,22 Cheng et al. demonstrated that Janus MXY monolayers present spin-orbital coupling (SOC)-induced Rashba spin splitting, which can be enhanced by increasing the SOC and/or the potential gradient.18 It was also found that WSeTe has a larger Rashba spin splitting than that of traditional heterojunctions, and a large tunability of the Rashba spin parameter can be obtained via a relatively small strain.23 Moreover, Xia et al. systematically investigated the universality of the electronic properties and photocatalyst applications of Janus MXY, finding that they have structural stability, large Rashba spin splittings, and highly efficient photocatalytic properties.24 The significant Rashba spin parameters of these Janus MXY monolayers make them promising for future spintronic applications.
In addition to MXY monolayers, stacking them into VdWHs has unlocked even more excellent properties, leading to the emergence of novel physical phenomena which play a vital role in nanoscale electronic, optoelectronic, and photovoltaic devices.25–29 Rawat et al. systematically studied the electronic, photocatalytic, and piezoelectric characteristics of Janus MXY/MXY (M = Mo, W; X,Y = S, Se, Te; X ≠ Y) vdWHs, and found that some of the heterobilayers have a power conversion efficiency of 15% to 20%, a very high carrier mobility (>200 cm2 V−1 s−1) together with a large visible-light absorption coefficient (α ≈ 105 cm−1), and a large piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 13.91 pm V−1) comparable to that of multilayer/bulk Mo-based dichalcogenides.27 Furthermore, Guo et al. studied the regulation of strain on the MoSSe/WSSe vertical heterojunction.30 They found that the band gap of the heterojunction can be effectively tuned by applying strain, and a large tensile strain can cause the transition from semiconductor to metal. In addition, Chen et al. demonstrated that the Janus BP/MoSSe vdWH also has a tunable band alignment and band gap under strain and an electric field.31
More recently, Idrees et al. investigated the electronic structures, induced SOC Rashba spin splitting, interlayer charge transfer, and photocatalytic performance of ZnO–JTMD heterostructures.32 They found that these heterostructures are indirect band gap semiconductors, presenting type-I and type-II band alignments depending on the different stacking patterns, and are also very promising in water splitting. However, how the vertical strain and external electric field modulate the band alignment is still unknown. Therefore, in this work, we construct ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs and systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties considering the stacking configurations, vertical strain and external electric field effects. It was found that ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs with a type II band alignment can be transformed into type I or type III under vertical strain and an external electric field. Each type of band alignment has unique device applications. In the heterostructure with a type-I band alignment, electrons and holes are confined in one material, which achieves an efficient recombination and is favorable for luminescence devices, such as semiconductor lasers and light-emitting diodes.33 In a type-II band alignment, electrons and holes originate from different materials, so the carriers are spatially separated and the lifetime of the interlayer excitons is increased, which is desirable for photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.34,35 In a type-III band alignment, the valence band maximum (VBM) of material 1 is higher than the conduction band minimum (CBM) of material 2, and the electrons tend to tunnel directly from the VBM of material 1 to the CBM of the material 2. Therefore, the broken-gap type-III band alignment can improve the electron tunneling efficiency. This behavior is called band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) transport, which is useful in applications of novel tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs).36 The realization of multiple-band-alignment transformation (type I, type II, and type III) in the ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs promotes their applications in multifunctional optoelectronic and nanoelectronic devices.
2. Computational methods
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed via the projector augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).37–40 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the scheme of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)41,42 is adopted to deal with the exchange correlation functional until forces and energies converged to 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. A plane wave cutoff energy of 500 eV, a k mesh of 15 × 15 × 1 in the scheme of Monkhorst–Pack, and a vacuum thickness of 20 Å along the z-direction are used. What's more, SOC is considered in the self-consistent simulations, and the dipole moment correction is included for the MoSSe monolayer and ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs. The Grimme's DFT-D2 method43 is used to correct the vdW interactions in the heterostructures.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structure and electronic properties of monolayers
In order to design the ZnO/MoSSe vdW heterostructure, we first investigated the geometric structures and electronic properties of the ZnO and MoSSe monolayers, whose structures are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The ZnO monolayer has a graphene-like plane with a lattice constant of 3.29 Å. The MoSSe monolayer consists of a MoS2 monolayer, in which one layer of S atoms is replaced by Se atoms, and hence the mirror symmetry of the Janus MoSSe is broken. The point group of the MoSSe monolayer is C3v, a lower symmetry than that of MoS2 (D3d). From the top view in Fig. 1(b), it also exhibits a hexagonal lattice. The optimized lattice constant of monolayer MoSSe is a = b = 3.25 Å, and the bond lengths of Mo–S and Mo–Se are 2.42 and 2.54 Å, respectively. The overall lattice mismatch for the ZnO/MoSSe heterostructure is only 1.2%. The phonon dispersion of MoSSe is calculated by the force constants from density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Since there are three atoms in the MoSSe unit cell, we can observe six optical branches in the high energy area and three acoustic phonon branches in the low energy area. It is found that all three phonon spectra have no imaginary frequency around the Γ point, indicating that the MoSSe monolayer is dynamically stable. In addition, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is performed at 300 K, 500 K and 1000 K under the canonical (NVT) ensemble for 3 ps to confirm the dynamical stability of the MoSSe monolayer. The total energies as a function of time are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). For T = 300 K and 500 K, the fluctuations of total energy are regular and small during this process, which demonstrates that MoSSe is thermally stable at these temperatures. For T = 1000 K, the fluctuations are irregular and have big changes around 2000 fs, indicating that it is unstable at this temperature. The planar average electrostatic potential is shown in Fig. 1(c), a 0.75 eV (Δφ) electrostatic potential difference between S and Se sides appears due to the breaking of the mirror symmetry; and there is a deeper potential energy on the Se side. The inset of Fig. 1(c) displays the charge density difference (CDD) of the MoSSe monolayer, which shows that the depletion and accumulation of electrons occur at the Se and S atoms, respectively. Therefore, the electric field pointing from the Se layer to the S layer is induced in the MoSSe monolayer. Bader charge analysis reveals that the S and Se atoms obtain 0.61 and 0.43 electrons from the Mo atom, respectively, while the Mo atom loses 1.04 electrons, which also demonstrates that more charge transferred from Mo to S. The calculated band structure of monolayers ZnO and MoSSe are shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e). For the monolayer ZnO, the CBM and VBM is located at the same high-symmetry point Γ, leading to a direct band gap of 1.61 eV. Similar to monolayers MoS2 and MoSe2, the monolayer MoSSe is also a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.47 eV, whose CBM and VBM are all at the K point. These results are consistent with previous works,19,24,32 indicating that our methods in this paper are reliable.

3.2. Electronic band structures of the heterostructures
For the ZnO/MoSSe heterostructure, four high-symmetry stacking orders denoted by AAI, AAII, ABI and ABII are considered. In general, specific contact atoms have a great influence on the properties of the interface. Because of the difference between S and Se, we consider two different orders of chalcogen layers with each stacking, depicted in Fig. 2. The binding energy is defined as Eb = EZnO–MoSSe − EZnO − EMoSSe, where EZnO–MoSSe, EZnO, and EMoSSe represent the total energy of the ZnO–MoSSe heterostructure, ZnO and MoSSe monolayers, respectively. According to this formula, the more negative the binding energy, the more energetically stable the system and the easier it is to be synthesized in experiments. The binding energies as a function of the interlayer distance of the four different stacking configurations for ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs are shown in Fig. 3. It is found that all the binding energies are negative, showing that all the studied stacking patterns are energetically favorable. Moreover, the binding energy of each stacking pattern reaches a minimum value at their equilibrium interlayer distance. The optimized lattice parameters, bond length, equilibrium interlayer distance and binding energy are listed in Table 1. The equilibrium interlayer distance of ZnO–SeMoS is larger than that of ZnO–SMoSe for the same stacking pattern. With the same order of chalcogen layers, ABI is the most stable among the four stacking patterns with the lowest binding energy and smallest equilibrium interlayer distance, suggesting a higher stability and stronger interlayer coupling between ZnO and MoSSe. Considering the smallest binding energy and interlayer distance, we mainly discuss the ABI pattern in detail.

To clearly investigate the electronic properties of the ABI pattern ZnO/MoSSe vdW heterostructure, the projected band structures are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). It is found that the ZnO–SeMoS and ZnO–SMoSe heterostructures all display semiconducting characteristics with an indirect band gap of 1.31 eV and 0.63 eV, respectively. In these two cases, the VBM are all located at the Γ point and mainly contributed by the ZnO layer, while the CBM are located at the K point and mainly consist of the MoSSe layer. These findings demonstrate that the two heterostructures have type-II band alignment, which can spontaneously separate the electron and hole in two different layers and make them very useful in electron–hole separators. The band gap of the ZnO–SMoSe heterostructure is smaller than that of ZnO–SeMoS, indicating that electrons are more easily excited from the VBM to the CBM in the ZnO–SMoSe heterostructure. Furthermore, band alignment of the semiconductor heterostructure acts as a pivotal part in the designing of materials and devices. Thus, the band alignment of ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs relative to the vacuum level are depicted in Fig. 4(c). For these two vdWHs, both the VBM and CBM of ZnO are higher than that of MoSSe, which also further manifests the type-II band alignment. In the type-II heterostructure, electrons and holes will be separated in different layers, which can be very useful in solar cells. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the valence band offset ΔEV and conduction band offset ΔEC of the ZnO–SeMoS (ZnO–SMoSe) heterostructure are 0.11 (0.69) eV and 0.86 (1.58) eV, respectively. In addition, it also can be seen that the work function of the MoSSe monolayer is lower than that of the ZnO monolayer, which indicates that the electrons would transfer from the ZnO to the MoSSe monolayer after the two layers contact each other. Therefore, electrons accumulate around the MoSSe and holes gather near the ZnO monolayer interface. As the transferred electrons increase, the Fermi level of MoSSe (ZnO) shifts upwards (downwards) and then reaches the same level. And a built-in electric field from ZnO to the MoSSe layer is induced in this process, which can further reduce the recombination probability of the photo-generated electrons and holes. The type-II band alignment of these two heterostructures is helpful for photo-generated electrons to flow from the conduction band of ZnO to that of the MoSSe layer. At the same time, it is also good for the photo-generated holes to move from the valence band of MoSSe to that of the ZnO layer.

To visualize the charge transfer and reveal the underlying physical mechanism between the ZnO and MoSSe layers, we calculate the plane-averaged electrostatic potential and charge density difference of these two hybrid structures in Fig. 5. The cyan and yellow regions represent charge depletion and accumulation, respectively. It can be found that the charge redistribution is localized around the interlayer area due to the orbital interactions. And the electrostatic potential differences for ZnO–SeMoS and ZnO–SMoSe are 0.63 and 0.80 eV, respectively. For both structures, the potential energy of the MoSSe layer is lower than that of the ZnO layer, promoting electrons to flow from the ZnO to the MoSSe layer. To obtain an accurate value of charge transfer, Bader charge analysis is performed and the result shows that 0.0036 and 0.0141 electrons transfer from the ZnO to the MoSSe layer, leading to the formation of interface dipole moments and hence inducing a built-in electric field in the ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs. Moreover, we can draw a further conclusion that very weak interactions exist in the ZnO/MoSSe heterostructure when the two monolayers contact.

3.3. Interlayer coupling effects on the electronic properties of ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs
According to previous works,44–48 vertical strain engineering and external electric field are effective methods to tune the electronic structure and band alignment of 2D vdWHs. Here we first study the strain effects on these two vdWHs by changing the interlayer distance. To investigate the interlayer coupling between ZnO and MoSSe, the band gaps as a function of the interlayer distances of ZnO–SeMoS and ZnO–SMoSe are presented in Fig. 6(a) and (b), in which the effective modulation of the band gap by vertical strain is obviously demonstrated. For ZnO–SeMoS (ZnO–SMoSe) vdWH, the band gaps decrease monotonously with the interlayer distance from the equilibrium interlayer distance to 3.98 (3.89) Å; while the band gaps increase monotonously with the interlayer distance reducing from the equilibrium value to 2.38 (2.29) Å. The strong coupling at a smaller distance could induce more charge transfer and a larger built-in electric field, which can be explained by the CDD of the ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs and Bader charge analysis. Fig. S3 (ESI†) presents the three-dimensional (3D) CDD of the ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs at different interlayer distances, from which we can find that the charges transfer between ZnO and MoSSe. In order to compare the amount of charge transfer under different interlayer distances, the plane-averaged CDD is also plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†), which indicates that more charge accumulation or depletion occurs in the heterostructures with smaller interlayer distances. In order to quantitatively illustrate the charge transfer, a Bader charge analysis has been performed, which shows that there are 0.0079 (0.0334), 0.0033 (0.0121), and 0.0005 (0.0036) electrons transferred from the ZnO layer to the MoSSe layer at interlayer distances of 2.48 (2.29), 3.08 (2.99) and 3.78 (3.69) Å, respectively. As a consequence, more charge transfer introduces higher built-in electric field, which provides a feasible way for regulating the band gap of the ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs by changing the interlayer distance. What's more, in the whole studied range, these two heterojunctions always maintain the indirect band gaps. In addition, the ZnO–SeMoS vdWH has a type I band alignment with a range of 2.38 to 2.78 Å, while it has a type II band alignment when the interlayer distance is larger than 2.78 Å. And the ZnO–SMoSe vdWH always has a type II band alignment in the whole studied range.
 Fig. 6  The band gaps of the (a) ZnO–SeMoS and (b) ZnO–SMoSe heterostructures vary as a function of the interlayer distance. 
To further explore the effect of interlayer interactions on the electronic properties of vdWHs, we display the projected band structures of ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs with different interlayer distances in Fig. 7(a) and (b), in which the bands dominated by ZnO and MoSSe are plotted with orange and olive, respectively. For the ZnO–SeMoS heterobilayer, as displayed in Fig. 7(a), the VBM is contributed by ZnO while the CBM is contributed by MoSSe when the distances are 3.08 Å and 3.78 Å, which leads to a typical type-II band alignment. In contrast, the VBM and CBM are all offered by MoSSe at a distance of 2.48 Å, thus resulting in a type-I band alignment. For ZnO–SMoSe, shown in Fig. 7(b), the CBM is contributed by ZnO, while the VBM is contributed by MoSSe at the interlayer distance of 2.29, 2.99 and 3.69 Å, exhibiting a typical type-II band alignment. In addition, with the interlayer distance reducing to 2.78 Å for ZnO–SeMoS, both the VBM and CBM are dominated by the MoSSe layer, showing a type-I band alignment. Thus, the distance of 2.78 Å for ZnO–SeMoS is crucial for the transition from type-II to type-I band alignment. In the type-II band alignment, the electrons and the holes are localized in the MoSSe and ZnO layers, respectively. This perfect separation of carriers can reduce the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes, demonstrating that the ZnO/MoSSe heterostructure is promising for possible applications in high-efficiency solar cells. And a semiconductor vdWH with type-I band alignment is applicable to light emission devices. The transition from type-II to type-I band alignment and effective modulation of the band gap are critical to design new optoelectronic devices.

3.4. Electric field effects on the electronic properties of ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs
In experiments, modulating gate voltage is also an effective method to tune the carrier type and electronic properties of materials. Therefore, we wondered whether the external electric field will give rise to some interesting effects on the electronic structures of the ZnO/MoSSe heterostructure. Here, we have performed electronic properties calculations by exerting electric fields from −0.6 to 0.4 V Å−1 in the ZnO–SeMoS vdWH and from −0.7 to 0.3 V Å−1 in the ZnO–SMoSe vdWH along the vertical direction. The direction of the positive electric field is from the ZnO layer to the MoSSe layer.

Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the band edge, band offsets (ΔEV and ΔEC) and band gap with the applied electric field. For ZnO–SeMoS, as shown in Fig. 8(a), when an electric field of 0 to +0.4 V Å−1 is applied, the total electric field is strengthened due to the same direction of the built-in and external electric field. In this case, electrons shift from the ZnO layer to the MoSSe layer, which can shift the bands of ZnO upward slightly while moving those of MoSSe down. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 8(b), the values of ΔEV, ΔEC and the band gap exhibit a continuous decreasing trend. Furthermore, when the applied electric field is larger than +0.25 V Å−1, the CBM of MoSSe and the VBM of ZnO cross each other, and hence a type-II to type-III band alignment transform and a semiconductor to metal transition can be observed. A heterojunction with a type-III band alignment can enhance the electron tunneling efficiency in the TFETs with a BTBT transport mechanism. When a negative electric field is applied, the total electric field is weakened due to the opposite direction of the built-in and the external electric field. As a result, the bands of ZnO move down, and the bands of MoSSe basically do not move, and hence the ΔEV and ΔEC keep increasing. There has been a transition from a type-I (−0.05 to −0.15 V Å−1) to a type II (−0.20 to −0.35 V Å−1) band alignment. There is no obvious change in the band gap of the type-I band alignment, which is because the VBM and CBM of the heterojunction are both contributed by the MoSSe layer. When the electric fields are −0.4 and −0.45 V Å−1, a type-I band alignment appears again. As the negative electric field further increases, the heterojunction becomes a metal with a type III band alignment. As shown in Fig. 8(b), in the range of −0.4 to −0.6 V Å−1, the ΔEV continues to increase, the ΔEC remains unchanged, and the band gap gradually decreases to 0. For ZnO–SMoSe, it can be seen that as the electric field is applied from −0.15 to +0.1 V Å−1, the VBM and CBM of ZnO change slightly while those of MoSSe move down rapidly, causing the band gap to significantly reduce and maintain the type-II band alignment. When the negative electric field further increases from −0.2 to −0.55 V Å−1, the VBM and CBM of MoSSe change slightly while those of the ZnO move down quickly, leading to a type-I to type-II band alignment transformation. In type-I band alignment, as described in Fig. 8(d), the band gaps are almost the same in the range of −0.2 to −0.35 V Å−1, since the change in the VBM and CBM of MoSSe is small. Subsequently, the band gaps gradually decrease from −0.4 to −0.55 V Å−1. When the applied electric field reaches −0.6 V Å−1, the bands of ZnO continue to move downward, and the bands of MoSSe begin to move upward, causing the appearance of a type-III band arrangement. What's more, in the whole studied range, the ΔEC (ΔEV) reduces to 0 under an electric field of −0.35 V Å−1 (−0.15 V Å−1), and then gradually increase.

In order to clearly understand the physical mechanism of the band alignment transition regulated by an external electric field in the ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs, Fig. 9 displays the projected band structures of the ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs with different selected external electric fields. For ZnO–SeMoS, it can be found that the VBM and CBM are contributed by the ZnO and MoSSe, respectively, with an applied electric field from 0.05 to 0.25 V Å−1, which indicates that the type-II band alignment can be kept within this range. As the positive electric field further increases, the VBM of ZnO shifts up to the EF while the CBM of MoSSe shifts down to the EF, creating a type-III band alignment. It should be noted that the “CBM” and “VBM” don’t exist when some bands cross the Fermi level. The same description “ZnO–VBM, ZnO–CBM, MoSSe–VBM and MoSSe–CBM” used here is to facilitate the comparison of the position changes under different electric field. When the negative fields of −0.05 to −0.15 V Å−1 are applied, only the MoSSe layer contributes to the VBM and CBM, inducing a typical type-I band alignment. When the negative electric field further increases from −0.2 to −0.35 V Å−1, the VBM is contributed by MoSSe, whereas the CBM is contributed by ZnO, inducing a transition from a type-I to a type-II band alignment. When the negative fields of −0.40 to −0.45 V Å−1 are applied, the CBM and VBM are all contributed by MoSSe and, thus, the type-I band alignment appears again. With a further increase of the negative electric field, the VBM of MoSSe shifts up to the CBM of ZnO, showing a type-III band alignment again. Moreover, it is also found that all the type-I and type-II band alignments maintain the characteristic of an indirect band gap. For ZnO–SMoSe, when the positive fields of 0.05 to 0.1 V Å−1 are applied, the VBM and CBM of the vdWH are offered by ZnO and MoSSe, respectively, maintaining a type-II band alignment. However, when the positive electric field is greater than 0.1 V Å−1, the CBM of MoSSe moves below the VBM of ZnO, bringing a type-III band alignment. When the negative electric field is in the range of −0.05 to −0.15 V Å−1, this heterojunction still maintains the characteristics of a type-II band alignment. With a further increase of the negative electric field, the VBM and CBM are all dominated by MoSSe, hence resulting in a type-I band alignment. When the applied electric field is in the range of −0.4 to −0.55 V Å−1, the type-II band arrangement emerges again. The difference is that CBM is contributed by ZnO, and VBM is contributed by MoSSe. When the electric field reaches 0.6 V Å−1, the VBM contributed by MoSSe shifts up to the EF, inducing a type-III band alignment. Different to ZnO–SeMoS, ZnO–SMoSe becomes a direct band gap semiconductor when the applied electric field is in the range of −0.2 to −0.35 V Å−1. Interestingly, additional conduction bands emerge near the CBM when the external electric field increases above −0.4 V Å−1 for the two vdWHs. This phenomenon originates from the near free electron (NFE) states induced by the electric field in the heterostructure.49,50 The electrons of the ZnO and MoSSe layers don’t contribute to the NFE states. And the bands of the NFE drop down rapidly as the applied electric field increase. When the applied electric field increases to −0.5 (−0.6) V Å−1, the NFE bands induce the metallic state in the ZnO–SeMoS (ZnO–SMoSe) heterostructure. These results reveal that electrostatic gating modulation is an effective way to regulate the electronic properties of ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs, which may have potential use in high-performance optoelectronic devices.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the geometric structures and electronic properties of ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs have been theoretically investigated based on first-principles studies. The stability of four different stacking patterns are evaluated by the binding energies. Among them, the ABI stacking is the most favorable structure with the minimum binding energy and interlayer distance. Both ZnO–SeMoS and ZnO–SMoSe vdWHs have a type-II band alignment, where electrons are prone to flow from the ZnO to the MoSSe layer and the transfer direction of holes is opposite, resulting in the spatial separation of electrons and holes. More interestingly, a type-II to type-I or type-III, indirect to direct transition could be induced via applying vertical strain or an external electric field, which can regulate the band alignment of the ZnO/MoSSe vdWHs effectively. The present findings pave the way for modulating the electronic properties by interface characteristics, and will facilitate the further development of vdWHs in the fields of multi-functional devices.
