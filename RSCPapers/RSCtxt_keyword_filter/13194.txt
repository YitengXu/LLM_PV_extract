    , Accepted 1st February 2018First published on 2nd February 2018AbstractA covalently linked tetracene trimer with a “face-to-face” stacked structure was prepared and its molecular structure is characterized by 1H NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The minimized molecular structure reveals that three tetracene subunits within this trimer adopt a partially “face-to-face” stacked configuration. Its absorption spectrum differs significantly from that of the monomeric and dimeric counterparts in solution due to the strong ground state interactions between the neighboring tetracene subunits. Its fluorescence is almost quenched completely. An ultrafast fluorescence decay component is observed in its fluorescence dynamics, indicating the presence of an ultrafast nonradiative decay channel in the trimer. The nonradiative channel is proved to be intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) by femto-second transient absorption studies. Different from the strongly coupled triplet state observed in the corresponding dimer, weakly coupled triplet states can be formed in this trimer. The triplet quantum yield of trimer 4 can reach up to 126% in solution.
Introduction
Singlet fission (SF) is a spin-allowed process in which a singlet excited-state molecule interacts with a neighboring ground state molecule and produces two independent triplet excited state molecules.1 This process may provide a way to overcome the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theoretical limit2 and to increase dramatically the efficiency of the single junction solar cell.3,4 Incorporation of materials capable of undergoing SF into a photovoltaic device can raise the upper limit of the power conversion efficiency of a single junction device to 45%, as predicted by a theoretical calculation.3 Therefore, SF has attracted much research interest in the past several years.
Initial research was focused on the intermolecular SF (xSF) process in crystalline materials,5–8 concentrated solutions9–11 and colloidal nanoparticles.12–14 All these materials can achieve highly efficient xSF and produce two free triplet states with long lifetimes.9 Recently, intramolecular SF (iSF), where SF occurs in a single molecule, has attracted considerable interest from scientists working in a variety of different fields because of the following two reasons. The first reason is that iSF sensitizers are ideal models for exploring the mechanisms of SF processes based on well-defined structure–property relationships. Secondly, iSF materials are easily processed from solution and retain their SF properties regardless of crystal packing or dispersion in another material, and therefore, they can be more applicable in different solar cells.15
ISF can occur efficiently in pentacene dimers or oligomers, no matter how they are linked and how strong the interactions are.16–23 However, SF in pentacene is strongly exergonic.1 In contrast, SF in tetracene is slightly endergonic, which can reduce the energy loss of SF and may lead to an improved open-circuit voltage in the photovoltaic device in comparison with pentacene.24 However, studies of iSF in tetracene systems were not successful.25–29 In the pioneering work reported by the Bardeen group, a series of tetracene dimers exhibited extremely low iSF yields due to the weak interactions between the two subunits.30 Therefore, a “face-to-face” tetracene dimer with strong interactions between the two subunits was synthesized by our group.27 However, the initial singlet states decayed via an excimer-like state instead of iSF in this dimer. When the interaction between the two tetracene subunits was decreased in another tetracene dimer linked by 1,2-diethynyl-phene, only the half-iSF process was observed, which produced only a strongly coupled triplet pair state (1(TT)) in solution.24 But, when this tetracene dimer was fabricated into a solid film, a high quantum yield of isolated triplet states was obtained via SF due to the diffusion of triplet states between the neighboring molecules.24 Recently, we prepared a tetracene trimer with weak ground state interactions and found that the iSF efficiency in this trimer was significantly improved in comparison with that of its dimeric counterpart.25 But the quantum yield of the triplet state was still lower than 100%. Previous research on SF in tetracene or pentacene crystals revealed that the formation of a coupled triplet pair state is the first step of SF. In the second step, the coupled triplet pair dissociated into isolated triplet states along the lattice of the tetracene or pentacene crystal.31 From this, we have reasons to believe that a complete iSF with high efficiency may be achieved in a molecule with proper ground-state interactions between the neighboring subunits and extra space for the dissociation of the triplet pair state. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a tetracene trimer (4) with a partially “face-to-face” stacked configuration for the first time (Scheme 1). For the purpose of comparison, dimer (3) and monomer (1 and 2) were also synthesized (Scheme 1). Dimer 3 has been reported to form strongly coupled triplet states via the iSF process with high efficiency.24 After the introduction of the third tetracene subunit in trimer 4, weakly coupled triplet states can be formed efficiently.

Experimental
General methods
The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 or 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with chemical shifts reported in ppm (TMS as internal standard). The MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker/ultraflex instrument. The absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-9300 spectrophotometer. The steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instrument (FLS980) with a three-monochromator spectrophotometer. The emission spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependence of the sensitivity of the detection system. The concentrations of all samples used in collecting absorption and fluorescence spectra were 10−5 M in THF. The solvent used for photophysical measurements was degassed first by the Freeze–Pump–Thaw method prior to use. All samples for photophysical measurements were prepared in the glovebox. The path-length of the cuvette used for collecting absorption and fluorescence spectra was 1 cm. The fluorescence dynamics were measured on an FLS980 with a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method by excitation with a 441 nm picosecond laser (EPL 445). The data were deconvoluted with the instrument response function, recorded using dispersed light, and fitted to a multi-exponential function. The absolute fluorescence quantum yields were measured with an integrating sphere.
For ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, the pump beam was set at 500 nm and generated from an optical parametric amplifier (OperA solo, Coherent) pumped by the amplifier (Libra, Coherent). A small portion of the amplifier out was used to generate the supercontinuum white light probe, which was delayed with respect to the pump pulse with an optical delay line. The pump pulse was kept in a weak regime where the excitonic annihilation effect can be neglected.
The minimized molecular structures were calculated at the level of ωB97X-D and 6-31G(d) basis sets in the Gaussian 09 program package. No symmetry constraints were applied during the optimization. The singlet states (S1) were computed with Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT).
Global (singular value decomposition-based) analysis was accomplished using the Glotaran software package (http://glotaran.org). The advantage of these methods is that they treat the full data set in aggregate, yielding much more accurate fits of the rate constants and decomposed “spectra” that track the distribution of the rate constants as a function of wavelength. We adopted the singular value decomposition (SVD) method within the Glotaran software package to estimate the number of species in the TA data for dimer 3 and trimer 4. Then, a two-component decay model (S1 → 1(TT)) was employed to decompose the TA data for dimer 3 and trimer 4.
Materials
Tetracene (5), trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA), tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF), phenylethyne and 1,2-diiodobenzene were purchased from TCI or Aldrich. 5-Bromotetracene (6),28 9-((trimethylsilyl)-ethynyl)tetracene (7),27 5-ethynyltetracene (8),27 5,11-dibromotetracene (9)32 and 1,2-diethynylbenzene33 were prepared following literature methods and characterized by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF or ESI mass spectrometry.

Following the Sonogashira coupling protocol, 1,2-diethynylbenzene (63 mg, 0.5 mmol), 5-bromotetracene (154 mg, 0.5 mmol), PdCl2(PPh3)2 (35.5 mg, 0.05 mmol), and CuI (9.6 mg, 0.05 mmol) were dissolved in triethylamine (15 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (15 mL). The solution was bubbled with N2 for 10 min. Then, the resulting solution was heated to 70 °C and stirred at this temperature for 45 min. The solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/chloroform = 4/1).

The solution was bubbled with N2 for 10 min. Then, the resulting solution was heated to 70 °C and stirred at this temperature for 2 h. The solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/chloroform = 4/1). After recrystallization from chloroform and methanol, monomer 2 was collected as a red solid (37.5 mg, 44%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C, TMS): 9.30 (s, 2H), 8.65 (d, 2H), 8.12 (d, 2H), 7.85 (d, 4H), 8.65 (d, 2H), 7.59–7.55 (m, 2H), 7.55–7.45 (m, 8H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C, TMS): 133.02, 131.75, 131.65, 130.10, 129.39, 128.68, 128.63, 126.95, 126.87, 126.82, 125.95, 123.62, 117.93, 102.13, 86.72.

The solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/chloroform = 4/1).

The solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (tetrahydrofuran/hexane = 1/3). After recrystallization from chloroform and methanol, trimer 4 was collected as a black solid (43 mg, 23.2%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, THF-D8, 25 °C, TMS): 9.04 (s, 2H), 8.94 (s, 2H), 8.57 (d, 2H), 8.39 (d, 4H), 8.30 (s, 2H), 7.99–7.93 (m, 4H), 7.74 (d, 2H), 7.67 (d, 2H), 7.50 (dd, 3.4 Hz, 4H), 7.06 (d, 6H), 6.91 (d, 2H), 6.87–6.81 (m, 2H), 6.76–6.68 (m, 2H), 6.65–6.57 (m, 2H), 6.54 (d, 2H).

Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
Following the Sonogashira coupling protocol (as shown in Scheme 1), two synthetic routes (route 1 and route 2) were designed for the preparation of dimer 3. Route 1, with 5-ethynyltetracene (8) as an intermediate, was adopted from a previous report.24 However, the yield of dimer 3 from route 1 was extremely low in our experiment, which is most likely due to the easy coupling with itself to form 5-ethynyltetracene (8) under the Sonogashira reaction conditions.27 Notably, 5-ethynyltetracene (8) was extremely unstable, which caused difficulties for the synthesis. Therefore, another synthetic method, with 5-bromotetracene (6) as an intermediate instead of 5-ethynyltetracene (8), was designed (route 2). Then, 5-bromotetracene (6) reacted with 1,2-diethynylbenzene to get dimer 3 or monomer 1. This method can increase the yield of dimer 3 significantly. The resulting monomer 1 further reacted with 5,11-dibromotetracene (9) to get trimer 4. However, the solubility of trimer 4 is much lower than that of dimer 3 in conventional organic solvents, which may be caused by the larger molecular weight of trimer 4.
Minimized molecular structure
The minimized molecular structures of trimer 4 and dimer 3 were calculated at the level of ωB97X-D and 6-31G(d) basis sets in the Gaussian 09 program package34 and are shown in Fig. 1. The structural parameters of dimer 3 obtained from our calculation are close to those obtained from its crystal structure reported previously (Fig. S1, ESI†),24 such as the torsion angle between the long axis of the neighboring tetracene rings (α), the dihedral angle between the plane of neighboring tetracene rings (β) and the distance between the neighboring tetracene rings (d1 and d2) (Table S1, ESI†). Fig. 1A and C reveal that all the tetracene subunits in dimer 3 and trimer 4 adopt a slipped “face-to-face” stacked configuration with distinctive displacement along the long axis of the tetracene ring and a large torsion angle (α, α1 and α2) between the two neighboring tetracene rings along the long axis of tetracene. This is reasonable because the same bridges were adopted in trimer 4 as in dimer 3. The torsion angle between the neighboring two tetracene rings along the long axis of tetracene is 39.7° in trimer 4, and it is 41.5° in dimer 3. The two adjacent tetracene units can rotate along the triple bond with respect to each other to form a dihedral angle between the planes of neighboring tetracene rings (β, β1 and β2), which is 10.0° for trimer 4 and 11.6° for dimer 3. Due to the similar dihedral angles of dimer 3 and trimer 4, the distances between the neighboring tetracene rings (d) in dimer 3 and trimer 4 are also similar (2.9–3.7 Å for trimer 4, 3.1–3.8 Å for dimer 3). These distances are approximately similar to those in substituted tetracene crystals, such as the angles of diphenyltetracene, dithiophyltetracene and rubrene that range from 3.2 to 3.8 Å.35–38 The similar structural parameters of trimer 4 and dimer 3 suggest the similar ground-state interactions between the two neighboring tetracene units in trimer 4 and dimer 3.

Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra
The absorption spectra of monomer 1, 2, dimer 3 and trimer 4 in THF are shown in Fig. 2. Three distinct absorption bands centered at 517, 483 and 453 nm can be found in the absorption spectrum of monomer 1, with the one at 517 nm having the largest intensity. The spectral pattern is quite similar to that of unsubstituted tetracene.30 The absorption bands can be assigned to the vibronic progression (0–0, 0–1, etc.) of a C–C stretching mode.27 The absorption spectrum of dimer 3 is significantly different from that of monomer 1. In comparison with the spectrum of monomer 1, the absorption spectrum of dimer 3 exhibits an enhanced 0–1 peak and a diminished 0–0 peak, suggesting the formation of H-type aggregates in dimer 3, which agrees well with the “face-to-face” stacked structure as revealed by the DFT calculation.27 This indicates the presence of strong ground-state interactions between the two tetracene subunits in dimer 3.
 Fig. 2  The absorption spectra of monomer 1, 2, dimer 3 and trimer 4 in THF (10−5 M). 
Unlike dimer 3, the absorption spectrum of trimer 4 presents a broad absorption band in the region of 450–550 nm and a new band centered at 563 nm. In order to reveal the origin of these new features, we synthesized another model compound (monomer 2), as shown in Scheme 1. Similar to monomer 1, the absorption spectrum of monomer 2 shows also three peaks centered at 543, 506 and 474 nm, with the one at 543 nm having the largest intensity. However, the maximum absorption peak of monomer 2 is redshifted by about 26 nm with respect to that of monomer 1, which should be attributed to the increased conjugation system in monomer 2. The new absorption band at 563 nm of trimer 4 should be originating from the red shift of the maximal absorption band of the middle tetracene moiety in trimer 4. A similar phenomenon was also observed in a previous report about the anthracene oligomer.39 The broad absorption band in the region of 450–550 nm should be the result of the superposition of the absorption of the three tetracene units in trimer 4. Because the absorption spectrum of trimer 4 is significantly different from that of the spectral superposition of dimer 3 and monomer 2 (Fig. S2, ESI†), as well as the spectral superposition of two monomer 1 molecules and one monomer 2 (Fig. S3, ESI†), the ground-state interactions between the tetracene subunits in trimer 4 should be strong. This is consistent with the “face-to-face” stacked conformation of trimer 4, as revealed by the minimized molecular structure. In addition, the S0 → S1 transitions of both dimer 3 and trimer 4 were revealed by the TDDFT calculation to be mainly resulting from the promotion of one electron from the HOMO to the LUMO. From Fig. S4 (ESI†), we can see that the S1 transitions of these two compounds are entirely described by the delocalized molecular orbitals. This is also consistent with the above observation in the absorption spectra that there is a strong electronic coupling between the adjacent tetracene units.
The fluorescence spectra of monomer 1, monomer 2, dimer 3 and trimer 4 are compared in Fig. 3. The maximum fluorescence peak of monomer 1 locates at 534 nm, while the fluorescence maximum of monomer 2 appears at 559 nm. The redshift of the fluorescence of monomer 2 with respect to that of monomer 1 can be attributed to the extension of the conjugation system in monomer 2 due to the presence of two triple bonds. Furthermore, the fluorescence quantum yield of monomer 2 (33.87%) decreased a lot in comparison with that of monomer 1 (70.67%), which is most likely due to the greater nonradiative decay caused by the free rotation of the two phenylacetylene groups around the tetracene core.40,41 The maximum fluorescence peaks of trimer 4 and dimer 3 were both located at 585 nm and redshifted with the same degree in comparison with that of monomer 2. The fluorescence band of trimer 4 presents a shoulder at the red side, which is different from that of either dimer 3 or monomer 2. All these characteristics of the fluorescence spectra of dimer 3 and trimer 4 suggest the presence of strong ground state interactions between the tetracene subunits.

Notably, the fluorescence quantum yield of trimer 4 (4.0%) or dimer 3 (1.3%) drops significantly with respect to those of monomers 1 and 2. This quenching is also observed in the time-resolved fluorescence dynamics (Fig. 4). The fluorescence of trimer 4 or dimer 3 almost decays completely in a very short time. This fast decay in dimer 3 is caused by the rapid formation of the triplet pair state (1(TT)) according to Thompson.24 Therefore, it is reasonable to ascribe the similar fast quenching of the fluorescence of trimer 4 to iSF. Besides the fast decay, another long-lifetime decay (∼10 ns) was also observed in the dynamics of trimer 4 or dimer 3, which was attributed to the delayed fluorescence caused by the recombination of the triplet pair formed via iSF.24,28 It is notable that the percentage of delayed fluorescence in trimer 4 is slightly greater than that in dimer 3 (Fig. 4). This may be the reason for the slightly higher fluorescence quantum yield of trimer 4 than that of dimer 3.

Femtosecond time-resolved TA spectra
In order to investigate the iSF processes in trimer 4 and dimer 3, we measured the femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra of them in dilute solution (Fig. 5 and Fig. S5, ESI†). After the photoexcitation (Fig. S5A, ESI†), the ground-state bleaching (GSB) of dimer 3 appeared at 488 nm and 532 nm. The photo-induced absorption (PIA) band caused by singlet excitons was located at 406 nm. With the time delay, the absorption of the singlet state at 406 nm decreased and a new absorption band centered at 560 nm grew simultaneously. These results are consistent with those observations of dimer 3 by Thompson.24 This new absorption band was assigned to the strongly coupled triplet state following the literature.24

(C) Decomposed transient spectra of the singlet (S1) and triplet pair (1(T–T)) of trimer 4 as solved by global analysis. (D) Population evolution of trimer 4 obtained from global analysis. 
Different from that of dimer 3, the GSB signals of trimer 4 were observed at 568 nm and 528 nm at the early stage, as shown in Fig. 5A. The PIA band centered at about 410 nm can be assigned to singlet excitons according to the above observations in dimer 3.24 This band decreased gradually with the delay of the time, and a new PIA feature grew at 626 nm, which was redshifted by about 60 nm compared with that of dimer 3. This indicates that a new excited state is formed. These changes in the TA spectrum of trimer 4 were also demonstrated by the single-wavelength dynamics at 410 nm and 626 nm (Fig. 5B). The final TA spectrum was almost identical to the triplet spectrum obtained from the sensitization experiment of a PtOEP doped solution of trimer 4 (the inset of Fig. 5A) (the sensitization details are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S6)), which suggests that the final state in trimer 4 is a state close to the triplet state. In addition, this final triplet-like state of trimer 4 was short-lived (Fig. 5B) and decayed with fluence-independent kinetics (Fig. S7, ESI†), which indicates that the decay of this triplet-like state is still dominated by the geminate triplet–triplet annihilation in trimer 4. This, together with the rapid conversion from the singlet state to the triplet-like state and the existence of delayed fluorescence, confirmed that triplet-like excitons in trimer 4 were generated via iSF. Notably, the spectrum of the strongly coupled triplet pair state of dimer 3 is significantly different from that of triplet states obtained from the sensitized experiment (Fig. S8, ESI†). However, the spectra of triplet-like states formed via iSF and triplet states from the sensitized experiment of trimer 4 are similar.19 A similar phenomenon can also be seen in a series of pentacene dimers reported previously by Campos.19 The similarity between the spectra of the triplet state formed via iSF and the sensitized experiment is enlarged gradually with the decrease of the interactions between the two pentacene units due to the decoupling between the two triplet states in the triplet pair formed via iSF.19 Therefore, we can assign accordingly the triplet-like state of trimer 4 to the weakly coupled triplet pairs formed via iSF. In order to distinguish from the strongly coupled triplet pair state (1(TT)) of dimer 3, we use 1(T–T) to represent the weakly coupled triplet pair of trimer 4. Furthermore, the formation of the 1(T–T) state was independent of the polarity of the solvent (Fig. S9, ESI†), excluding the presence of the charge-transfer intermediate state in the iSF process. We also did not observe any signal of the excimer-like state in the fluorescence spectra, which excludes the possibility of the excimer-like intermediate state during iSF. These observations are similar with that observed in dimer 3.24
Due to the spectral overlap of the singlet and the triplet, global analysis was employed to decompose the TA spectra of dimer 3 and trimer 4.42 A two-species model (S1 → 1(TT)) was adopted to decompose the TA spectra of dimer 3 (Fig. S5, ESI†) and trimer 4 (Fig. 5), which has been successfully used previously to decompose the TA spectra of pentacene dimers in the literature.19 The rise time and decay time of the 1(TT) state in dimer 3 are 2.5 ps and 514 ps, respectively. These results are close to that (2 ps and 500 ps) obtained by Thompson,24 which suggests that our data processing method is reliable. The kinetics of the decomposed TA spectra show that the singlet state of trimer 4 decayed rapidly, concomitant with the rise of the 1(T–T) state with a time constant of about 2.2 ps, which is close to that for dimer 3 (2.5 ps).24 This fast decay of singlet excitons was consistent with the observation in the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrum (Fig. 4). Then, the 1(T–T) state decayed with a lifetime of 730 ps, which is longer than the lifetime (514 ps) of the 1(TT) state in dimer 3.24 This may be caused by the diffusion of the triplet state in trimer 4. This is also supported by the high similarity between the spectra of 1(T–T) and the triplet state formed from sensitization experiments. In addition, we found that the decay of the excited state probed at ∼410 nm for dimer 3 is faster than that for trimer 4 after the first dozens of picoseconds (Fig. S10A, ESI†). A similar phenomenon was also observed at the triplet absorption region (Fig. S10B, ESI†). This indicates that the triplet pairs (1(TT)) of dimer 3 decay faster than that of trimer 4 (1(T–T)), which is consistent with the result obtained from global analysis.
Because the spectra of 1(T–T) obtained from iSF are similar to the triplet spectra from the sensitization experiment, we can calculate the triplet quantum yield of trimer 4 according to the previous report.9,18,19 The concentration of the triplet state can be directly calculated from TA spectroscopy by using the Lambert–Beer law. The concentration of the singlet state can be calculated from the power of the excitation light. At last, the triplet quantum yield can be calculated by comparing the concentration of the triplet state with that of the singlet state. The quantum yield of the triplet state of trimer 4 in diluted solution was calculated to be about 126(±17)%.
It must be noted that all the photophysical measurements were carried out in diluted solutions; therefere, the iSF in trimer 4 is totally an intramolecular process. There is no other molecule that is inolved in the process of SF. Dimer 3 had been reporetd to exhibit a triplet quantum yield of 154%, but it was measured in the solid state, not in solution.24 Obviously, diffusion of triplet pairs between the adjcent molecules of dimer 3 is involved in this SF process. Trimer 4 might exhibit a more efficient SF in the solid state, because the weakly coupled triplet pairs can further diffuse among the molecules of trimer 4, which can prevent the quick triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) and thus stablize the triplet states. Because the focuse in this work is iSF, not xSF, we do not present the solid state properties of trimer 4 here. We will report the proeprties of trimer 4 in the solid state together with other compounds elsewhere.
As we know, the iSF process is very sensitive to the relative conformation of the two adjacent chromophore units in molecular dimers or oligomers.1 As revealed by the minimized molecular structure (Fig. 1), the structural parameters of trimer 4 and dimer 3 are almost identical, which leads to similar iSF for trimer 4 and dimer 3. However, the introduction of the third tetracene unit may provide extra space for the diffusion of the triplet state, which leads to decoupling between the two triplet states and then prolongs the lifetime of the 1(T–T) state in trimer 4.
Conclusions
In summary, a tetracene trimer with a slipped “face-to-face” stacked structure has been prepared for the first time. Highly efficient iSF can be conducted in this trimer. The introduction of the third tetracene unit in this trimer may allow the diffusion of the triplet state, which leads to decoupling between the two triplet states in a triplet pair formed via iSF and thus it inhibits the TTA process and prolongs the lifetime of the triplet pair states. The triplet quantum yield of trimer 4 can reach up to 126%. This provides a new strategy for the design of noval iSF materials with high iSF efficiency and long-lifetime triplet states.
