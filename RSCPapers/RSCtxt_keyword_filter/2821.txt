    , Accepted 27th July 2022First published on 28th July 2022AbstractTo investigate the effect of double fluorine substitution on the optical, electrochemical, thermodynamic, morphological and electrochromic properties of electrochromic polymers, two benzotriazole-EDOT electrochromic conjugated polymers PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E were synthesized via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP). P2F-BTz-E was obtained after fluorination of PBTz-E by substituting two hydrogen atoms on the benzotriazole unit with two fluorine atoms. Both polymers exhibited similar purple colors in the neutral state, and the polymer films reversibly and stably switched between neutral and oxidized states with minimal degradation over 1000 s. The optical contrast, response time and electrochemical stability of P2F-BTz-E are significantly improved, and the reduction time can reach sub-second speed (0.5 s). However, the severe stacking and aggregation of fluorinated polymer P2F-BTz-E resulted in unsatisfactory film surface morphology and low coloration efficiency. Surprisingly, PBTz-E shows magnificent coloration efficiency (774 cm2 C−1 at 570 nm) because of the low transfer charge. Flexible ECDs prepared from two polymers demonstrated good reversible electrochromic properties. These results provide valuable information for the elaboration of high-performance electrochromic polymers based on benzotriazole.
Introduction
Electrochromic materials, which change their optical properties according to an electrical bias, have made significant progress in the last few decades due to their potential applications, such as flexible wearables,1,2 smart windows/glass and mirrors,3,4 electronic papers,5 military camouflage wear,6 night vision equipment,7 bioimaging,8,9 telecommunications10 and electro-fluoro chromic applications.11 Electrochromic conjugated polymers (ECPs),12–15 as a new generation of electrochromic materials, have many excellent properties including ease of structural modification to demonstrate multicolor, flexibility, low-cost, high contrast and coloration efficiency, and show potential for applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Recently, many researchers committed to the synthesis of ECPs via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP), because the toxic metal by-products can be bypassed and the synthesis steps can be reduced compared with conventional synthesis methods (e.g., Stille, Suzuki).16–18
Reduction of the bandgap (Eg) will enhance the redox activity and stability of ECPs,19,20 hence numerous chemists have focused their efforts on lowering the bandgap of ECPs. The methodologies soon mushroomed, and the donor–acceptor (D–A) method, developed by Havinga,21 is the most effective strategy for achieving low-bandgap ECPs by alternating donor and acceptor units along the main chain of conjugated polymers. Moreover, the optical properties, fundamental color, and other EC properties of polymers are primarily determined by the D units.22 Conventional D units include thiophene, EDOT, pyrrole, furan, carbazole, triphenylamine and their derivatives, while benzotriazole, benzothiadiazole, quinoxaline and their derivatives are usually used as A units.23–29
In the search for soluble, fast switching, high optical contrast, and stable ECPs of electrochromic devices, benzotriazoles (BTzs) have received extensive attention because BTzs based ECPs can achieve redox-enabled transmission with the neutral state blue, red or green colors.30 Polymers containing BTz in the main chain are excellent candidates for use in organic electronic devices, particularly in electrochromic applications. For example, D–A type ECPs bearing EDOT as the D unit and BTz as the A unit, showed low-band and excellent electrochromic properties according to the reports.30,31 It is conceivable that the effective adjustment of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) on the basis of D–A polymers contributes to achieving high-performance optoelectronic devices.
Substitution on D/A units aids in the tuning of some conjugated polymer properties, and furthermore, the addition of strong electron-withdrawing substituents in D–A polymers reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and can increase the inter- and intra-chain interactions of the corresponding polymers.32,33 Among various electron-withdrawing substituents, the fluorine atom is an extremely electronegative substitution with a relatively small covalent radius, which is ideal for down-tuning the HOMO–LUMO energy level without disturbing the planar molecular structure of the conjugated polymer. In addition, the introduction of fluorine atoms does not cause deleterious steric effects.34 Currently, fluorine substitution is widely used in the field of organic solar cells, which can effectively improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells.35–37 Wei Teng Neo38et al. investigated the effects of fluorination on the electrochromic performance of benzothiadiazole-based D–A copolymers, while the effect of fluorination on D–A ECPs with other structures has not been expanded, therefore, more research is needed.
Herein, in order to reveal our findings on the effect of fluorine atoms in benzotriazole-containing D–A ECPs, PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E were designed and synthesized via DHAP. The effects of difluoride substitution were fully investigated through their electrochemical, thermodynamics, morphology and electrochromic properties. Furthermore, flexible electrochromic devices (ECDs) were fabricated.

Material synthesis

Synthesis of PBTz-E (1). 
A 10 mL pressure-resistant bottle vial was charged with a stirring magnet, 4,7-dibromo-2-(heptadecan-9-yl)-2H-benzo[1,2,3]triazole (257.5 mg, 0.5 mmol), EDOT (71 mg, 0.5 mmol), pivalic acid (15.15 mg, 0.15 mmol), Pd(dba)3·CHCl3 (22.23 mg, 0.025 mmol), CsCO3 (407.5 mg, 1.25 mmol) and dimethylacetamide (2 mL). Nitrogen was introduced into the pressure-resistant bottle for 10 minutes and then the bottle was sealed after removing the air. The pressure-resistant bottle was then transferred to a thermostatic oil bath and subjected to magnetic stirring at 120 °C for 12 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was washed and precipitated with 150 mL of absolute ethanol for 40 minutes. The precipitate was collected by filtration and washed in a Soxhlet extractor with absolute ethanol, n-hexane, dichloromethane, and trichloromethane until the solution was colorless. After the solution was rotary evaporated, purple solids were collected (0.28 g, 85% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ 8.22 (s, 2H), 4.98 (s, 1H), 4.51 (s,4H), 2.42 (s, 2H), 2.06 (s, 2H), 1.34 (m, 24H), 0.80 (m, 6H). The number average molecular weight (Mn) and molar-mass dispersity (ĐM = Mw/Mn) were 4.9 kDa and 1.1.

The number average molecular weight (Mn) and molar-mass dispersity (ĐM = Mw/Mn) were 9.1 kDa and 1.3.

Film preparation
ITO conductive glasses (0.8 cm × 5 cm) were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, ethanol, toluene, and acetone for 15 minutes before being blown dry with N2. The polymer was completely dissolved in chloroform (1.5 mg mL−1), then injected into a hand-held spray gun, and a 0.8 cm × 2.5 cm film was deposited on the ITO conductive glass by spraying (spray for 15 seconds to control the film thickness), moreover, the polymer-coated ITO glasses were washed with ACN then dried in air for subsequent use.
Characterizations

1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AV-500 at 20 °C. UV-vis spectra of the polymers dissolved in CHCl3 were examined by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 ultraviolet-visible near-infrared spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were obtained with a F-2700 fluorescent photometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out in a three-electrode cell configuration with polymer-coated ITO glass, Pt wire and AgCl wire as the working, counter and pseudo-reference electrodes, respectively. The films were deposited by spraying on ITO conductive glass with an area of 0.8 cm × 2.5 cm, their electrochemical properties were measured in a 1 cm quartz cell with a computer-controlled potential output. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Ta Instruments TGA 55 and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out on a Ta Instruments DSC-25, under flowing nitrogen at a scan rate of 20 °C min−1. The surface morphology of the polymer films was observed by using a super depth-of-field 3D video microscope DVM6 of Leica. The spectroelectrochemical properties of the polymer films were investigated using ITO-coated glass sprayed with polymer films as the working electrode of a spectroelectrochemical workstation. The geometry was optimized by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to optimize the ground state geometries of the acceptor molecules using Gaussian 09.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Two benzotriazole-EDOT based ECPs were prepared, namely PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E. The corresponding polymer of P2F-BTz-E, the replacement of two hydrogen atoms of the BTz unit by two fluorine atoms modified the energy level (Eg) compared with PBTz-E. The synthetic route for the polymers is depicted in Scheme 1 and the experimental section contains details of the synthesis steps. Both polymers were prepared in one step via DHAP reaction with excellent yield in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). The chemical structure of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E was verified by their 1H NMR spectra, which are consistent with the results expected from the experiment (Fig. S1–S4 in the ESI†). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E was affirmed with chloroform as the eluent (Fig. S5–S6, ESI†), and the number average molecular weight (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The Mn of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E are 4983 and 9163, respectively. Both polymers were soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane and THF, which was beneficial for solution processing of the polymers.

Thermal properties
Thermal stability determines the temperature range of the polymers, and the two polymers were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Both polymers exhibited excellent thermal stability, the 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) were around 390 °C (Fig. 1a). P2F-BTz-E exhibited better thermal stability than PBTz-E because difluoride substitution can increase the inter- and intra-chain interactions of the corresponding polymers.39–41 DSC tests were performed on PTBA-E and PTBA-E-2F over a temperature range of −70 to 350 °C, two polymers revealed no notable phase transitions, and both of them exhibited distinct melting (99.5 °C, 99.2 °C, respectively) and crystallization peaks (106.7 °C, 104.3 °C, respectively) (Fig. 1b).

Theoretical calculations
In order to effectively predict the effect of difluorine substitution on the HOMO–LUMO energy level and structure of polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) theory level were performed for simplified models of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E (Fig. 2). The alkyl chain on benzotriazole has been simplified to make the model simpler and clearer, and it is convenient to observe the molecular geometry and frontier molecular orbitals. Due to the presence of the S⋯N conformational lock,42 the conjugation arrangement of BTz and EDOT is more inclined to that shown in Fig. 2. From the molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbital distributions, it was shown that the addition of two fluorine atoms leads to the destruction of the planarity of the conjugated polymer and the distortion of the conjugated skeleton, with the dihedral angle of P2F-BTz-E reaching 41°, higher than PBTz-E of 3°. In addition, the HOMO and LUMO of the optimized structure were calculated, and it was found that both the HOMO and LUMO of P2F-BTz-E were decreased relative to PBTz-E, which indicated that the fluorination of the acceptor units would reduce the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the HOMO–LUMO gap increases slightly with the introduction of fluorine atoms.

Morphology
The surface morphology of polymer films was observed by using a super depth-of-field 3D video microscope DVM6 of Leica and SEM, due to the close relation to their electrochemistry and electrochromic performances.43,44 Moreover, the aggregation and stacking of polymer films can be clearly observed through it, and the surface morphology images are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†) (SEM images). In both polymer films, relatively homogeneous surfaces are observed. In particular, the aggregation of P2F-BTz-E is more pronounced and the stacking is tighter, resulting in a rougher surface, which may be due to the fact that during the self-assembly process, fluorination caused the polymer to aggregate more easily, with stacked crystals with different heights of uneven distribution and causing unevenly distributed pores on the surface.

Optical and electrochemical properties
In chloroform solutions with low concentration states, the optical properties of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E were investigated by UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, as shown in Fig. 4. Both PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E exhibited distinct broad absorption bands in two different wavelength bands (Fig. 4a), which is a typical characteristic of D–A type polymers.45 The higher absorption band at 300 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transition in the conjugated chain, while the lower absorption band at 550 nm is mainly caused by the intramolecular charge transfer of D units and A units.46 On the other hand, the absorption bandwidth of BTz-E-2F was narrower in the low absorption band region, which was perhaps due to the enhanced intermolecular interaction caused by double fluorination, resulting in polymer backbone stacking. In addition, similar to the results reported in many studies,38,47–49 the slight blue shift of the BTz-E-2F relative to the BTz-E in the absorption maxima (λmax) and the absorption onset (λonset) may be attributable to distortion of the conjugated backbone, which was caused by greater intramolecular interactions and steric hindrance due to the introduction of two fluorine atoms in the A unit. Nonetheless, the twisting extent of the conjugate skeleton could be limited owing to the increase in planarity of the polymer backbone caused by the interactions between F and S, N and O atoms. The fluorescence spectra of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E were measured using the same excitation wavelength (555 nm) in different polar solvents. P2F-BTz-E exhibited insolubility in DMF, and chloroform was selected for its dissolution. The donor–acceptor compounds usually exhibit a solvatochromic effect.50–52 As shown in Fig. 4b and c, both polymers show a clear Stokes red shift and solvatochromic effect. The red shift between THF and CHCl3 of P2F-BTz-E is small due to their polarities being similar. The quantum yields of the two polymers in the solid state and in solution were tested. Both PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E exhibit small quantum yields in the solid state (0.8% and 0.7%), but advanced quantum yields in chloroform (20.3% and 11.4%).

Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed in a three-electrode cell configuration with polymer-coated ITO glass, Pt wire, and AgCl wire as the working electrode, counter electrode, and pseudo-reference electrode, respectively, to probe the redox behavior and stability of the polymers. The electrochemical parameters of the polymer are summarized in Table 1, and the redox activities of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E were tested at different scan rates using cyclic voltammetry (in Fig. 5). Both PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E exhibit excellent distinct oxidation and reduction peaks, meanwhile, P-doping and N-doping characteristics are visible, which are similar to typical D–A conjugated polymers,53,54 and in addition, P-doping was chosen to investigate their redox properties because the N-doping of both polymers was the dimmest (Fig. S9, ESI†).

 Fig. 5  CVs of PBTz-E (a) and P2F-BTz-E (d) films in monomer-free 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/CH3CN at different scan rates from 300 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1, the linear relationship between the peak current density and scan rate (jp,a and jp,c denote the anodic and cathodic peak current densities), PBTz-E (b) and P2F-BTz-E (e), and cycled for 100 laps at a potential scan rate of 250 mV s−1, PBTz-E (c) and P2F-BTz-E (f). 
As shown in Fig. 5a and d, the oxidation onset potential of P2F-BTz-E is higher than PBTz-E, leading to a lower HOMO energy level, indicating that fluorination can effectively reduce the HOMO energy level. The difluoride substitution on an acceptor unit is expected to amend planarization and reduce the band gap energy,55 and the larger radius of the fluorine atom compared to the hydrogen atom also causes steric hindrance and reduces the effective conjugation length, which may lead to an increase in band gap energy.48The HOMO–LUMO energy levels (ECVg) through cyclic voltammetry of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E (1.53 eV and 1.54 eV) are lower than theoretically calculated HOMO–LUMO energy levels (2.28 eV and 3.16 eV). The difference between the theoretical calculation and cyclic voltammetry is consistent with the previous reports, mainly affected by solvent, temperature, etc.56,57 The linear relationship between the scanning speed and the peak current density was investigated based on the cyclic voltammetric curves of the P-doping process, and is shown in Fig. 5b and e. In addition, the linear value between peak current density (both anode and cathode) and scan rate was approximately 1 according to the linear regressions of all peak current densities, indicating that the redox processes of both polymer films are non-diffusive, and the excellent redox reversibility, adhesion and electrochemical activity are demonstrated.58 As a result, the spray-coated films adhered firmly to the ITO glass even under high scan rates, and the charges could diffuse efficiently through the polymer films during the redox processes. Long-term electrochemical stability is essential for high-performance electrochromic devices, therefore, the electrochemical stability of two polymer films was tested at a scan rate of 250 mV s−1 for 100 cycles, as shown in Fig. 5c and f, and the electrochemical stability of BTz-E-2F is more distinguished with almost no loss of the total charge over 100 cycles, which may be due to the fluorination leading to tighter molecular buildup, which indicated that BTz-E-2F is an excellent candidate for electrochromic devices (ECDs).
Spectroelectrochemistry analysis
In terms of electrochromic high-performance display applications, spectroelectrochemical measurements which measure the absorption spectra of polymers by voltage pulses can directly evaluate the electrochromic properties of conjugated polymers. Therefore, the spectroelectrochemical properties of the polymer films were investigated in a quartz electrolytic cell using ITO-coated glasses sprayed with polymer film as a working electrode on a spectroelectrochemical workstation. In particular, the polymer films need to be sprayed until homogeneous films are obtained, and the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded from the neutral state gradually to the oxidation state, as shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Spectroelectrochemistry of PBTz-E (a) and P2F-BTz-E (b) films on ITO-coated glasses in Bu4NPF6/CH3CN (0.1 M) solution, and photographs of polymers in the oxidized state and neutral state. 
At an applied potential of −0.5V, PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E show similar absorption bands at around 600 nm, which can be attributed to the π–π* transition of the neutral state polymer backbone. P2F-BTz-E has a slight blue shift relative to PBTz-E, which is similar to the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the polymer in solution, mainly due to the introduction of the fluorine atoms, which lead to the distorted conjugation backbone, and then make the effective conjugation length of PBTz-2-2F shorter. In the neutral state, PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E show purple and dark purple, respectively. With the increase in potential, the polymer films start to enter the P-type doping stage, the absorption in the visible region begins to decrease simultaneously, and the oxidation of the conjugated polymers leads to charge leaving domains along the polymer backbone, and polaritons and dipolaritons begin to form, causing changes in the optical leap of the polymers. Meanwhile, the polymer films exhibit changes in appearance and color, such as, PBTz-E changes from purple (L*: 8.04, a*: −0.99, b*: 5.01) to light blue (L*: 3.64, a*: 1.18, b*: −0.28) and P2F-BTz-E changes from dark purple (L*: 5.13, a*: −0.74, b*: 2.92) to light blue (L*: 2.38, a*: 0.44, b*: −0.44), and photographs of the polymer films in the neutral and oxidized states are included in Fig. 6a and b.
Switching properties
The modulated response performance of electrochromic polymers is mainly manifested by kinetics, including optical contrast, switching speed and coloration efficiency etc. Switching speed is often reported as the time required for ECPs to change from one redox state to another redox state, including coloring time and fading time. Switching speed is generally the time used for a 95% change in transmittance. Coloration efficiency (CE) refers to the ratio of the change in optical density (ΔOD) to the amount of charge transferred in/out per unit area (Qd) at a specific wavelength. The energy consumed by ECPs in the redox process can be reflected by the coloration efficiency. High coloration efficiency means that the consumed energy is less. It is given by the equation:ΔOD = log (Tox/Tred)CE = ΔOD/QdWhere CE (cm2 C−1) is the coloration efficiency at a given λ. Tox and Tred are the bleached and colored transmittance values, respectively. Qox and Qred are the charge of oxidation and reduction process, respectively. S is the area of the working electrode.
Kinetic studies of BTz-E and BTz-E-2F films were performed using an electrochemical workstation-UV-vis spectrophotometer, and square wave chronopotentiometry was applied to the films to monitor the percent transmittance changes as a function of time and to determine the switching times, and the potential square waves were set as 0–0.7 V and 0–0.9 V, respectively, and the dwell times were all set to 10 s. The transmittance graphics and square wave potentials of BTz-E and BTz-E-2F are shown in Fig. 7 and the data are summarized in Table 2. Both PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E films exhibit distinguished transmittance stability, as shown in Fig. 7a and b, and the transmittance decreases insignificantly within 1000 seconds. PBTz-E showed 31% (570 nm), 30% (595 nm) and 28% (623 nm) transmittance variations, and the optical contrast values of P2F-BTz-E were 38% (540 nm), 42% (570 nm) and 35% (630 nm) in the visible regions. Overall, P2F-BTz-E exhibits superior transmittance than PBTz-E, perhaps due to the rough surface with an open, porous structure that facilitates fast switching and high transmittance,59 but the transmittance of PBTz-E is more stable because the more uniform film facilitates improved transmittance stability. PBTz-E exhibits excellent cycling stability, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), exhibiting a low decrease in transmittance over the course of 500 cycles, however, P2F-BTz-E showed good stability after 100 cycles.

Both PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E films exhibit fast response times with reduction times below 1 s. For example, the reduction times of P2F-BTz-E are as low as 0.5 s at 540 nm and 570 nm, which is superior to some reported BTz-EDOT-based polymers60 (around 2 s) with relatively longer oxidation times (<2.5 s). In addition, smoother and flatter morphologies tend to result in films with better electrochromic properties.61 PBTz-E has a superior electrochromic efficiency than P2F-BTz-E, up to 774 cm2 C−1 at 570 nm, as shown in Fig. 7c and d. The lower transfer charge of PBTz-E relative to P2F-BTz-E suggests that PBTz-E consumes less energy in the redox process, perhaps due to the low redox voltage and lower crystallinity of PBTz-E.62,63 High coloration rates and fast response times mean that PBTz-E is a strong candidate for high-performance electrochromic devices.
Flexible device
As mentioned above, both polymers can be processed in solution with common volatile organic solvents, and we mainly use spraying methods for film deposition. By covering the electrode surface of the flexible substrate with a layer of skeleton model, the patterned electrochromic film can be prepared by spraying ECP solution with a spray gun, and then the flexible electrochromic device can be prepared. Patterned flexible devices were fabricated with the configuration of indium tin oxide-polyethylene terephthalate (ITO-PET)/patterned PBTz-E or P2F-BTz-E electrochromic layer/gel electrolyte/ITO-PET. As shown in Fig. 8, the blooming violet flowers are formed by spraying PBTz-E solution dissolved in chloroform through the skeleton model adhered to the electrode surface. The rhizome of the blooming violet is a film formed by spraying a solution of P2F-BTz-E dissolved in chloroform through a skeletonized model adhered to the surface of the electrode. As can be seen from Fig. 8a, when 1.3 V is applied, the petal part of the violet is already oxidized, while the rhizome part is only partially oxidized, which is consistent with the previously discussed P2F-BTz-E with a larger oxidation voltage. When the applied voltage reaches 1.6 V, the rhizome part is also completely oxidized and the whole violet shows a blue state, and given an applied bias voltage of −0.6 V, the violet is again reduced and the color of the violet is lighter compared to the neutral state. Fig. 8b shows the bent form of the flexible device, where the flexible ECD still maintains high reversible electrochromic properties in the bent form. As shown in Fig. 9, flexible ECD exhibits >30% transmittance at all three specified wavelengths (540 nm, 570 nm and 630 nm). This method is effective for creating simple small-size patterns, so it is still possible to use finer industrial printing to prepare higher resolution, more complex patterns.

Conclusion
In this work, two benzotriazole-containing D–A type electrochromic conjugated polymers (ECPs) of PBTz-E and P2F-BTz-E were prepared by DHAP. The structural, optical, electrochemical and electrochromic properties of the films were investigated and it was found that the down-shifting HOMO level and distorted conjugate plane of P2F-BTz-E are due to the fluorination of benzotriazole units. In addition, the double fluorine substitution was effective in improving the electrochemical stability, transmittance and response time of the benzotriazole-EDOT-based polymers. It is envisioned that appropriate fluorination of the acceptor unit for D–A type conjugated polymerization can lead to high performance electrochromic conjugated polymers. The preparation of flexible electrochromic devices was attempted for two polymers, and good results were obtained.
