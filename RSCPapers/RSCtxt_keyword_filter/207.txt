    , Accepted 4th April 2012First published on 4th April 2012AbstractPt-NPs hybridized inside and outside multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were successfully synthesized using a liquid plasma system with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide under atmospheric pressure. The Pt-NPs with a size of 3–4 nm were stably and uniformly hybridized on both inner and outer surfaces of the MWNTs. The nanohybrid materials were applied to the counter electrode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Electrochemical impedance measurement of DSCs revealed that the charge-transfer resistance of a MWNT–Pt nanohybrid-coated electrode was less than that of Pt-sputtered and MWNT-coated electrodes. Due to the low charge-transfer resistance, the DSC exhibited fairly improved energy conversion efficiency compared to the DSCs equipped with Pt-sputtered and MWNT-coated counter electrodes.
Introduction
Platinum (Pt) is known to be one of the most expensive but inevitably appropriate materials as an electrode for electrochemical cells such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and fuel cells, because of its catalytic functionality, high conductivity and chemical stability in an acid–base environment.1 Thus, Pt has been usually used as the counter electrode material for DSCs.2,3 Both high conductivity and excellent catalytic properties are required for the material to be used as the counter electrode for DSCs. It is not easy, however, to simultaneously satisfy both requirements. Pt sputtered on FTO glass usually shows excellent conductivity, but a high charge transfer resistance, due to its limited surface area, not to mention its high production cost using expensive vacuum processing. On the other hand, Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs), which can provide high electro-catalytic activity because of their large active area, show low electric conductivity because of their abundant grain boundaries and defects.4
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are emerging candidate materials which can replace Pt due to their high specific surface area, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability.5,6 However, CNT counter electrodes usually require a thick CNT film to achieve an acceptable level of catalytic activity. Thus, Pt-NPs supported on CNTs can be a reasonable alternative which can satisfy the inevitable requirements of low price, excellent catalytic functionality, and high electric conductivity. Many attempts have been made to combine CNTs and metals.7–19 The main mechanism is based on replacing the protons of the functional groups on the surface of the CNTs with metal ions7 and reducing the metal ions to metal NPs using various reducing agents. The reducing agent could be either a chemical agent or physical agent. In the case where chemical reducing agents, including sodium compounds,8–10 hydrogen,11 ethylene glycol,12 and electrons13 are used, the high reaction rate can result in the aggregation of the NPs. Moreover the chemical materials used may not be good for health and the environment. Physical reducing agents are generally thermal reducers,8,14 which require high temperatures such as 873 K for Pt, 873 K for Pd, and 673 K for Au. This is a drawback, because the adhesion strength of NPs to CNTs is rather weak, probably due to the van der Waals bonds, in which most of the NPs can be detached from the CNTs after ultrasonic treatment.
Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are known as green solvents, catalysts, and electrolytes.15 They can also be used as stabilizers for synthesizing metal NP–CNT hybrids with NaBH4 as a reducing agent.16 Baba et al. applied a gas–RTIL interfacial plasma under low pressure to reduce Au precursor salts to Au NPs inter-capsulated into single-walled CNTs and encapsulated inside double-walled CNTs, after impregnating a liquid solution containing Au metal precursor salts into the bundled CNTs.17 However, the stabilization of Au NPs on CNTs is still a challenge. Wu et al. improved the stability of Pt on CNTs using an RTIL polymer thin film.18,19 However, the physical binding of Pt with CNTs is still a problem, as mentioned above.
Herein, we report a new strategy to chemically bind Pt-NPs on MWNTs in an RTIL under an atmospheric pressure plasma and physically stabilize them through the film of ionic liquid supramolecules (ILSMs) on the surface of the Pt-NPs–MWNTs. Our approach is based upon two simultaneous processes. The first is the plasma reduction of the Pt ions in the RTIL, replacing the protons of the functional groups on the surface of the MWNTs with Pt ions to eventually form chemical bonds between the MWNTs and Pt-NPs.7,12 The second process is the recombination of the radicals dissociated from the RTIL monomer under the high energy plasma flame. This forms an ILSM film, which acts as a conductive protecting layer to stabilize the Pt-NPs on the MWNTs. The ILSM film provides mechanical isolation between the Pt-NPs through the electrostatic and coordinative action between them and the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic cations of the RTILs. It is expected that the Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrids will show ultrahigh stability for regenerating iodide from triiodide in the counter electrode of DSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
Pristine multi-walled CNTs were purchased from Hanwha Nano Tech, Korea. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoro-methylsulfonyl) imide ([BMI](Tf2N)) was purchased from Aldrich-Sigma, USA. FTO glass as a conductive transparency electrode was purchased from Pilkington, USA (∼8 Ohm □−1). These substrates were used after cleaning by sonic treatment in acetone (Fluka). Nonporous TiO2 paste and ruthenium based-dye (N719) were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. The dye was adsorbed from a 0.3 mM solution in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) and tert-butylalcohol (Aldrich) with a volume ratio of 1:1. The electrolyte was a solution of 0.60 M 1-methyl-3-butylimidazolium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.03 M I2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.50 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich) in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) and valeronitrile, with a volume ratio of 85:15.
Synthesis of Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid
The pristine MWNTs were purified by acid treatment12 and open-ended in advance by thermal treatment at 470 °C for 30 min.17 The MWNTs (100 mg) were added to a solution of H2PtCl6 (10 mM) in iso-propanol (20 ml). The mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 hours and then the iso-propyl alcohol was evaporated at 50 °C in a vacuum oven. As a result, the Pt compounds were well intercalated or encapsulated into the MWNTs. Then, the MWNTs with the Pt compounds were dispersed in [BMI](Tf2N). For the formation of Pt-NPs and ionic-liquid polymer, the mixture of MWNTs with Pt compounds and RTIL in a reactor, which has the structure shown in Scheme S1†, was treated by an atmospheric pressure plasma system20 (Ar, 200 W, 5 lpm) for 30 min. The distance between the power electrode and the reactor surface is 2 mm. After the plasma treatment, the excess impurities were extracted from the IL by centrifuging several times at 10000 rpm per 5 min. The final products were dried in a vacuum oven at 323 K to remove the residual solvent.
Synthesis of MWNT–Pt nanohybrid (inside)
Unpurified MWNTs were open-ended in advance, which meant that they had few functional groups such as carboxylic, carbonyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the MWNTs. Due to the open-ended structure of the MWNTs obtained through the thermal pretreatment, the Pt precursors can be impregnated and trapped inside the MWNTs while removing the solvent at 50 °C in a vacuum. Through the plasma treatment, the Pt ions impregnated into the inside of the MWNTs can be reduced to Pt-NPs. After removing the excess impurities and extracting the IL by centrifuging, the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid (inside) was mixed with hydrochloric acid (37%). In order to further remove the catalyst impurities, sonication for 1 hour and filtration at least 5 times were performed until the pH of the solution was neutral. The morphology of MWNT–Pt nanohybrid (inside) was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Characterization of Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid
The structural characterization of the synthesized MWNTs with Pt-NPs was performed by a transmission electron microscope and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (JEM-2100F, Joel, Japan). The corresponding loading mass of the Pt-NPs on the nanohybrid was investigated by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (Optima 7300 DV, Perkin-Elmer, USA).
Preparation of counter electrodes
The MWNT–Pt hybrid powder was mixed with a 1 wt% solution of ethyl cellulose (EC) in terpineol by a three-roll miller. The mixture was coated on the FTO-glass substrate by a doctor blade and dried at 300 °C for 30 min to obtain the MWNT–Pt hybrid counter electrodes. For comparison, an MWNT electrode was prepared by the same method and a Pt electrode was obtained by DC-sputtering Pt at 10 mA and 2 × 10−3 torr for 5 min.
Cyclic voltammetry in I2 + I− system, assembly and measurements of the DSCs
The assembly and measurements of the dye-sensitized solar cells were carried out as described in a previous study.21
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid materials
The synthesis of the MWNT–Pt nanohybrids is achieved by using a plasma–RTIL system, as shown in Scheme 1. Hydrogen radicals and electrons are the main reducing agents for the formation of Pt-NPs through the atomization reaction of the Pt precursors at the interface between the plasmas and RTIL.22 They are generated by the atmospheric pressure plasma in contact with water and oxygen from the atmosphere during the plasma treatment.22–24 In the RTIL solution containing MWNTs and Pt precursor salt, they can also be generated from the impurity water in the RTIL or water adsorbed on the precursor salt. Besides, e− may be formed by photo-detachment from anions such as chloride ions, which are known to form C–H⋯Cl interactions with the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl) imide ([BMI](Tf2N)) cations, under the plasma irradiation of argon. On the other hand, the ILSM can be simultaneously formed through the recombination of the radicals dissociated from the RTIL monomer under the high energy plasma flame.23 Also, due to the interaction between the chloride ions and hydrogen of the RTIL, the complex, [BMI]2PtCl4, can be formed from the Pt compound and [BMI]Tf2N at around 70 °C.24 The change of the temperature of the ionic liquid solution during the plasma treatment was measured with a thermocouple installed in a temperature controlling device (Testo 175). The temperature increased to above 60 °C within 100 s and then leveled off at around 65 °C. Thus, the complex, [BMI]2PtCl4, can be formed from the Pt compound and [BMI]Tf2N. The complex, [BMI]2PtCl4, can help to supply the buffer space required for the crystallization of Pt.

Fig. 1(a) shows the morphology of a MWNT–Pt nanohybrid with Pt-NPs immobilized inside and outside of the MWNT. Fig. 1(b) and (c) display the magnified images in the dashed-line squares in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. The heavy element, Pt, is distinctly observed in Fig. 1(c), where the lattice spacing exists in the encapsulated material, as shown in Fig. 1(c), and the estimated lattice spacing is 1.96 Å, which coincides well with Pt {200}. Fig. 1(d) shows that the Pt-NPs have a size of 2–6 nm and mostly 3 or 4 nm. Other studies using chemical or thermal methods reported that Pt-NPs grown outside of MWNTs had a size of more than 8 nm14 due to the high reduction rate10 or high temperature (873 K).14 Our Pt-NPs are not only uniform, but also well distributed on the surface of the MWNTs without any aggregation. We also observed the thin film of ILSM on the surface of the MWNT–Pt hybrid in Fig. 1(b), which was partially confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis in Fig. 2. This film may result in the improvement of the stability of the MWNT–Pt hybrid, as described in the report of Wu et al.18,19

 Fig. 2  The thermal gravimetric analysis of the MWNTs and MWNT–Pt. 
The weight percentage of the ionic liquid supramolecules (ILSMs) bound to the MWNT surface and complexed with Pt was determined using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA was performed on a TGA/DSC 1 (Mettler-Toledo Inc.) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in an N2 atmosphere and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. For the MWNTs, there is almost no weight loss in the measured temperature range of 400–800 K. However, for the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid, an obvious weight loss can be observed in the temperature range of 420–700 K, which must result from the decomposition of the surface-bound ILSM. The TGA results confirm that the ILSMs were successfully coated onto the MWNTs. From the difference in the weight loss of the MWNTs and MWNT–Pt nanohybrid at 700 K, the amount of surface-bound ILSM on the MWNTs was estimated to be 12 wt% of the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid.
Due to the open-ended structure of the MWNTs caused by the thermal pretreatment,17 the Pt precursors can be impregnated and trapped inside the MWNTs while removing the solvent at 50 °C in a vacuum. Functional groups, such as carboxylic (–COOH), carbonyl (–CO) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups, which are introduced on the surface in a purification process, can also immobilize the Pt-NPs by replacing the protons with Pt ions during the atmospheric pressure plasma treatment in the RTIL.7,12 The Pt-NPs chemically bind with the surface functional groups of the MWNTs.12 In the case where no functional groups exist on the surface of the MWNTs, some of the Pt-NPs can also be trapped inside the MWNTs, because the Pt ions impregnated into the inside of the MWNTs can be reduced to Pt-NPs as in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  TEM image showing Pt-NPs encapsulated inside of the MWNTs after removing the catalyst impurities. 
Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), measured during the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation in Fig. 4, identified the Pt-NPs immobilized on the surface of the MWNTs. The dashed-line square and “+” symbol depicted in Fig. 4(a) indicate the electron beam irradiated area. EDS1 and EDS3 were measured inside of the dashed-line square containing the white spots and at the center of the white spot, respectively. The peaks of Pt were observed at 2.1 keV and 9.6 keV, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The other peaks for C, O, Cu and Si must come from the MWNTs, oxygen containing functional groups, background grid and system, respectively. EDS2 was measured at the black part. No peaks for Pt were observed in the EDS2 spectrum. The loading of the Pt-NPs on the nanohybrid was only 6.28 wt%, as measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy.

Redox behavior and stability of Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid materials
The catalytic performances of the MWNT electrode, Pt-sputtered electrode and MWNT–Pt electrode were evaluated through comparative analysis of their cyclic voltammograms in 5 mM LiI + I2 acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4 as the supporting electrolyte. For cyclic voltammetry, the three electrodes were used as working electrodes, the Pt mesh was a counter electrode, and Hg/Hg2+ in acetonitrile served as a reference electrode. The data were recorded from 600 mV to −300 mV with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Fig. 5 shows that the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode exhibits a higher current density, as can be seen from the large peak area in the CV curve, suggesting a larger electrode active surface.9 While the reduction reaction of triiodide ions on the MWNT electrode is really slow, the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode shows the highest cathodic peak, which means that it has high electro-catalytic activity. This high electro-catalytic activity can explain the large current density when the MWNT–Pt nanohybrids are applied to the counter electrode of the dye-sensitized solar cells.

Most importantly, the DSC with the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode shows good stability. This stability was confirmed by the stability of the current–voltage curves over time for the redox system with the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid working electrode and Pt counter electrode (Fig. 6). No detachment of the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid films from the FTO-glass was observed after the 100th cycle.5 The MWNT–Pt nanohybrid was stable even after the 1000th cycle as shown in Fig. 6. These results will confirm the trends observed for the impedance characteristics, supporting the validity of our interpretation.

Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid materials as the counter electrode of DSC

Fig. 7 shows a comparison of the performance of the three DSCs with different counter electrodes. The DSC with the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid as the counter electrode shows an energy conversion efficiency of 8.24 (±0.08)% with a small amount of Pt (6.61 μg), which is better than those of the DSCs with the MWNT electrode and Pt-sputtered electrode (122.5 μg Pt), viz. 6.02 (±0.12)% and 8.12 (±0.10)%, respectively, as listed in Table 1. Regardless of the illumination conditions, the open circuit voltages, Voc, of the DSCs with the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode and Pt-sputtered electrode are higher than that of the DSC with the MWNT electrode. The positive shift of the I3−/I− redox energy level measured in the cyclic voltammogram supports this observation.1,21 The short circuit current, Jsc, of the DSC with the Pt-sputtered electrode, however, is higher than that of the DSC with the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode, due to the high electrical conductivity in the thin film of sputtered Pt, as well as the reflection effect of the Pt mirror.3 The Jsc of the DSC with the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode is higher than that of the DSC with the MWNT electrode, due to the predominant synergic effect of the MWNTs and Pt-NPs.9 The fill factor of the DSC with the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode (68.61 ± 0.40%) is higher than those of the DSCs with the Pt-sputtered electrode (65.55 ± 1.56%) and MWNT electrode (52.08 ± 1.11%), due to the small internal resistance of the cell. This point can be clearly explained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 8.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the DSC with Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid-coated counter electrode

Fig. 8 represents the three Nyquist plots of the DSCs with the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid-coated, MWNT-coated and Pt-sputtered counter electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the DSCs was performed under constant light illumination (100 mW cm−2) biased under open-circuit conditions. The measured frequency range was 100 kHz to 100 mHz with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV.21 The obtained spectra were fitted using Z-View software (v3.2c, Scribner Associates, Inc.) with reference to the proposed equivalent circuit. Table 2 shows the estimated values of the charge transfer resistances on both the counter electrode and working electrode, and also the CPE parameters for the interfaces of both the counter and working electrodes. For the purpose of comparing only the counter electrodes, we fabricated three working electrodes using the same materials and method. Although the reduction reaction of triiodide ions on only the MWNTs is slow, the Pt-NP–MWNT electrode shows a high current density in Fig. 5. The introduction of the Pt-NPs leads to an obvious improvement in the electrocatalytic activity, providing a larger active surface area.25 Thus, the Rct of the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid was as small as 0.5 Ω cm2, while those of the Pt-sputtered electrode and MWNT electrode were 1.12 Ω cm2 and 4.59 Ω cm2, respectively. The constant phase element (CPE1 = (CPE1-T)−1(jw)−(CPE1-P)) of the counter electrode also confirms that the active surface areas of the MWNT–Pt-coated and MWNT-coated electrodes are larger than that of the Pt-sputtered electrode. Table 2 shows that the value of CPE1-T is 1.67 × 10−3 F cm−2 for the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode and 7.88 × 10−2 F cm−2 for the MWNT electrode, which are much greater than 5.08 × 10−5 F cm−2 of the Pt-sputtered electrode. A larger CPE1-T means an increase in the active surface area. Table 2 also shows that the porosity value, (CPE1-P), is 0.74 for the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode and 0.46 for the MWNT electrode, which are much smaller than that of the Pt-sputtered electrode, viz. 0.92. A smaller CPE1-P means an increase in the porosity. There is a slight difference in the values of the ohmic serial resistances between the electrodes (2.42 Ω cm2 for the MWNT–Pt nanohybrid electrode, 3.03 Ω cm2 for the MWNT electrode and 2.47 Ω cm2 for the Pt-sputtered electrode). This discrepancy is due to their different thicknesses (Fig. 9) and areas of the ohmic contact layers on the FTO glass substrate. The reduction of the total internal resistance due to the decrease in the charge-transfer resistance is the cause of the increase in the fill factor of the DSCs,26 which confirms the increase in the conversion efficiency, as previously shown.

Conclusions
We developed a new strategy to chemically bind Pt-NPs on MWNTs in an RTIL under an atmospheric pressure plasma and physically stabilize them through the deposition of a film of ILSM on the surface of the Pt-NP–MWNTs. Pt-NPs with a size of 3–4 nm were stably and uniformly immobilized both inside and outside of the MWNTs. The long-term stability of the Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid electrocatalyst for triiodide reduction was clearly improved by the physical stabilization of the Pt-NPs through the conductive protecting layer of ILSM as well as chemical binding between the MWNTs and Pt-NPs. The fill factor of the DSC with the Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid electrode was the highest among three electrodes, due to the small internal resistance of the cell. Electrochemical impedance measurement of DSCs also revealed that the charge-transfer resistance of Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid-coated electrode was very small. Thus, we expect that the Pt-NP–MWNT nanohybrid-coated electrode, which shows long-term stability as well as excellent energy conversion efficiency for DSCs with a small amount of Pt, can also be a robust and low-cost electrode for fuel cells.
