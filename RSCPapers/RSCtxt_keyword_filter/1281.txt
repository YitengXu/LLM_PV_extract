A simple change of reaction substrates from ketone to ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines successfully realized the synthesis of a variety of novel pendant fullerene dimers, including those from methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines, which were considered to produce the known bridged fullerene dimers. It should be noted that pendant fullerene dimers are usually difficult to prepare by other methods and may have promising applications in perovskite solar cells. Density functional theory (DFT) has been employed to elucidate the regioselectivity of methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines to yield exclusively pendant fullerene dimers by investigating the Gibbs free energy profile of the reaction starting from methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines and iminium intermediates.
Introduction
Since the macroscopic manufacture of fullerenes in 1990,1 various effective methods for fullerene functionalization have been discovered and a large number of fullerene derivatives with wide structural diversities have been prepared.2–5 As a new type of all-carbon or modified fullerene containing two fullerene moieties, fullerene dimers3–5 have attracted tremendous attention over the past decades due to their promising applications in many fields such as perovskite solar cells (PSCs),6 in which fullerene dimers relative to the corresponding monomers generally exhibit superior stability and efficiency improvements by coordinating with both metal oxides and perovskites via halogen terminals. Dimerization of fullerene or a suitably functionalized fullerene provides a powerful tool for the preparation of fullerene dimers.4,5 In addition, as an alternative method, bifunctional cycloaddition with two fullerene units also provides a new strategy for the synthesis of fullerene dimers.3c Generally speaking, fullerene dimers can be divided into three major groups based on the mode of linkage between the two fullerene moieties. Directly linked dimers4 by cyclic units (Fig. 1a and b) are the first type of fullerene dimer and are conventionally formed by thermolysis reactions or mechanochemical reactions. Wang et al. first reported the dumbbell-shaped C120 (Fig. 1a) as the simplest fullerene dimer in 1997 by using solid-state mechanochemical reactions.4c Singly-bonded dimers5 with a general form of RCn-CnR (Fig. 1c) are another type of fullerene dimer and are generally prepared by the recombination of two in situ generated RCn˙ from the addition of R˙ to fullerene. Pioneering work on singly-bonded fullerene dimers was conducted by Krusic and co-workers.5a,c–e Bridged dimers3c through spacers (Fig. 1d) are the third type of fullerene dimer and are mainly produced by bifunctional cycloaddition reactions with two fullerene units. Besides the above three major fullerene dimers, other dimers including pendant fullerene dimers7 (Fig. 1e) are still rare. Hence, there is a strong demand for developing new protocols for the preparation of fullerene dimers, especially scarce pendant fullerene dimers.

Fulleropyrrolidines bearing a nitrogen heterocyclic structure are a kind of important fullerene compound and have been utilized to improve the performance of PSCs.6,8 For example, a few novel bridged fullerene dimers7 with pyrrolidine motifs from the aminomethylation reaction of acetone in the presence of N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines and paraformaldehyde with the aid of p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) (Scheme 1) have been successfully applied to non-encapsulated planar devices in PSCs as interlayer materials to deliver a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% without any hysteresis,6 further corroborating the importance of developing new methods for the preparation of novel fullerene dimers, particularly those containing pyrrolidine moieties. It should be noted that only bridged fullerene dimers were formed as byproducts by the above reaction, yet scarce pendant fullerene dimers have never been observed during the reaction process (Scheme 1).7 On the other hand, different types of fullerene dimers have shown obvious differences in their properties in many fields,3 and accordingly new approaches for the synthesis of rare pendant fullerene dimers are still required. Considering the failure of the preparation of pendant fullerene dimers by the aforementioned aminomethylation reaction of acetone,7 the Mannich reaction of fulleropyrrolidines bearing ketone moieties was studied to see if the expected pendant fullerene dimers were formed. To our delight, a simple change of reaction substrates from acetone to fulleropyrrolidines with ketone moieties selectively afforded the desired pendant fullerene dimers instead of bridged fullerene dimers in good to excellent yields. In continuation of our interest in fullerene chemistry,7,9 herein we describe the preparation of a series of rare pendant fullerene dimers by the facile Mannich reaction of ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines with N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines and paraformaldehyde in the presence of TsOH. It should be noted that the difference between pendant fullerene dimers and bridged fullerene dimers mainly comes from the location of two fullerene units on the main chain (Scheme 1). Pendant fullerene dimers generally refer to those in which two fullerene units are located at the same side of the main chain, while in bridged fullerene dimers, they are located at both sides of the main chain.

Results and discussion
The reaction condition optimization process for the fullerene-containing Mannich reaction to produce pendant fullerene dimer 3aa is shown in Table 1. Starting from ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidine 1a, N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidine 2a, paraformaldehyde, and TsOH·H2O in a 1:1.5:5:3 ratio (entry 1, Table 1), different equivalents of 2a, paraformaldehyde, and TsOH·H2O were tested (entries 1–12, Table 1), ranging from 1.5 to 3 equiv., 3 to 10 equiv., and 0.5 to 5 equiv., respectively. In the case of 2a (entries 1–4, Table 1), entry 3 (2.5 equiv.) presents a much better result than entries 1, 2, and 4 with a product yield of 69%. For paraformaldehyde (entries 3 and 5–7, Table 1), the isolated yield of 3aa could be increased to 73% by using 7 equiv. of 2a (entry 6, Table 1). As for TsOH·H2O (entries 6, 8–12, Table 1), further improvement in product yield (77%) was observed by the addition of 2 equiv. of TsOH·H2O (entry 10, Table 1). The reaction temperature was also considered (entries 10, 13, and 14, Table 1) and it was found that the highest product yield (89%) was acquired by decreasing the reaction temperature to 40 °C (entry 13, Table 1). Furthermore, when the reaction was conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere, a slightly reduced product yield was obtained (entry 15 vs. 13, Table 1), indicating that oxygen in air has no crucial influence on the reaction. The effect of solvent on the reaction was also studied using o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) to replace chlorobenzene. Unfortunately, no further improvement in the yield of 3aa was detected (entry 16 vs. 13, Table 1). Accordingly, the optimum reaction conditions were set as 1a/2a/(CH2O)n/TsOH·H2O with a molar ratio of 1:2.5:7:2, and a reaction temperature of 40 °C in chlorobenzene under air conditions (entry 13, Table 1). It should be noted that other promoters such as TfOH, CH2COOH, BF3·Et2O and L-proline were also employed to replace TsOH·H2O under the optimized conditions and they exhibited either reduced reaction efficiency (entry 17, Table 1) or no reaction (entries 18–20, Table 1).

With the optimized conditions in hand, ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines (1a–e) from the aminomethylation of acetone with N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines and paraformaldehyde7 were first chosen to explore the substrate scope of this reaction. The reaction scope examination results are listed in Table 2. As can be seen from Table 2, all of the examined ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines (1a–e) and N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines (2a–e) afforded the desired pendant fullerene dimers (3aa–ee) instead of bridged fullerene dimers (Scheme 1) in 40–89% isolated yields. In comparison with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituted 1b–e and 2b–e, the product yield from 1a and 2a without any substituents was obviously higher (89% vs. 40–63%). The exact reason for this phenomenon is still not clear. It is noteworthy that methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines were usually considered to produce the known bridged fullerene dimers instead of the unreported pendant fullerene dimers (3aa–ee) on the basis of our previous study.7 The unexpected synthesis of rare pendant fullerene dimers fully confirmed the importance of the current synthetic method for novel fullerene dimers. In addition, the successful preparation of unreported pendant fullerene dimers (3aa–ee), especially those containing Cl, OCH3, and CF3 groups, would enable promising applications of pendant fullerene dimers in the field of PSCs based on the previously reported literature.6,8

To expand the scope of this reaction, the substrates were extended from methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines (1a–e) to fulleropyrrolidines bearing aryl ketone moieties (1f–l). Table 3 shows the reaction scope examination results upon reacting aryl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines (1f–l), N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines (2a, b, and d) and paraformaldehyde in the presence of TsOH·H2O. As shown in Table 3, aryl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines (1f–l) bearing both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups resulted in the corresponding pendant fullerene dimers (3fa, fb, ga–ia, and jd–ld) in good to excellent yields (42–80%). It should be noted that only pendant fullerene dimers were in principle formed for aryl ketone-containing 1f–l due to the replacement of methyl by aryl groups, and thus higher product yields for 3fa, fb, ga–ia, and jd–ld should be obtained. Nevertheless, no further improvements in the yields of 3fa, fb, ga–ia, jd–ld (42–80%) were observed relative to those (40–89%) from 1a–e probably due to the greater steric effect of aryl than that of the methyl group. Furthermore, functional groups such as Cl and NO2 could be tolerated under our reaction conditions (Tables 2 and 3) and could be further transformed into other moieties.

Ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines 1a, f–i, and k,7N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines 2a, b, d, and e,9a,b and pendant fullerene dimers 3ha and kd7 are known compounds, and their identities were unambiguously confirmed by comparing their spectral data with those reported previously.7,9a,b As for new compounds 1b–e, 1j, l, 2c, and 3aa–ee, fa, fb, ga, ia, jd, and ld, their structures were characterized using their MALDI-TOF MS, FT-IR, UV-vis, 1H and 13C NMR spectra. All MALDI-TOF MS spectra of these new compounds showed the correct [M]− or [M + H]+ peaks. In their IR spectra, the characteristic absorptions of the CO group of 1b–e, 1j, l and 3aa–ee, fa, fb, ga, ia, jd, ld as well as the NH group of 2c were clearly observed at 1641–1743 and 3316 cm−1, respectively. Their UV-vis spectra exhibited a diagnostic absorption at 430–431 nm, which is ascribed to the 1,2-adducts of C60. Their 1H NMR spectra showed the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for all protons. In addition, the chemical shift (1.08–1.33 ppm) of methyl hydrogen for pendant fullerene dimers 3aa–ee is usually shifted upfield about 0.6–0.8 ppm relative to that (1.88–1.95 ppm) of the corresponding methyl hydrogen for ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines 1a–e. In their 13C NMR spectra, compounds 1b–e, 1j, l and 2c exhibited similar spectral patterns, and there were not more than 30 peaks for the 58 sp2-carbons of the C60 skeleton including some overlapped ones and 2 peaks for the 2 sp3 carbons of the C60 cage, agreeing well with their Cs molecular symmetry. Nevertheless, products 3bb, cc, ee, ga, and jd showed different spectral patterns as 1b–e, 1j, l and 2c. The observation of at least 38 peaks including some overlapped ones due to the 116 sp2 carbons of the C60 moiety together with 2 peaks for the 4 sp3 carbons of the C60 cage was consistent with the C1 symmetry of their molecular structures. Furthermore, the typical peak for the CO carbon was also observed at 194.43–205.55 ppm in 1b–e, 1j, l and 3bb, cc, ee, ga, and jd.
On the basis of the experimental results together with the previously reported Mannich reaction mechanisms,7,9j,10 a plausible reaction pathway for the formation of pendant fullerene dimers 3 is depicted in Scheme 2. Protonated formaldehyde A first reacts with N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidine 2 to produce aminomethanol C, followed by the elimination of one molecule of H2O to generate iminium intermediate E. The subsequent nucleophilic attack of the in situ generated enol Gvia keto–enol tautomerism on the unstable E results in the generation of pendant fullerene dimers 3.
 Scheme 2  Proposed formation mechanism for pendant fullerene dimers 3. 
It should be noted that two enols G and I (Fig. 2) from the keto–enol tautomerism of methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines (1a–e) were in principle formed to afford the corresponding pendant fullerene dimers 3 and bridged fullerene dimers, respectively. However, only pendant fullerene dimers rather than bridged fullerene dimers were experimentally observed under our standard conditions probably due to the higher stability of G than I as a result of more alkyl substituents on the double bond of G.
 Fig. 2  Structures of two types of enols from keto–enol tautomerism of methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines. 
To further elucidate the above experimental results, theoretical calculations for the Gibbs free energy profile of the reaction starting from methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidine 1 and iminium intermediate E were carried out to reveal the regioselectivity of this reaction. Taking 3aa as an example, the free energy profile for the reaction of ketone 1a with iminium E1 generating pendant fullerene dimer 3aa and bridged fullerene dimer 4aa was calculated using density functional theory and is shown in Fig. 3. In the first step, keto–enol tautomerism proceeds via TS1a-H2O and TS1b-H2O catalyzed by two water molecules with free energy barriers of 44.1 and 44.4 kcal mol−1, respectively, which are close to that (41.3 kcal mol−1) reported previously.11 However, under the catalysis of TsOH, the free energy barriers of TS1a-TsOH and TS1b-TsOH remarkably decreased to 22.4 and 24.3 kcal mol−1, respectively, showing the superior catalytic effect of TsOH over H2O. In the subsequent reaction of enol G1/I1 with iminium E1, enol intermediate G1 shows higher reaction activity and product 3aa is more stable. The free energy barrier for the formation of 3aa is 9.2 kcal mol−1 which is lower than that for the formation of 4aa, indicating that 4aa cannot be produced from a kinetic point of view. Furthermore, the transformation from 3aa to 4aa will be blocked due to the high free energy barrier (45.5 kcal mol−1) for the reverse reaction of product 3aa. Therefore, the formation of 3aa is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable, which will result in the exclusive generation of 3aa, consistent with the experimental observations.
 Fig. 3  Gibbs free energy profile for the reaction of ketone 1a with iminium E1 at the M062x/6-311++G(d,p)/SMD(chlorobenzene)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level (T = 40 °C). All transition state geometries are shown in Fig. S1†. 
It should be noted that theoretical calculations were further conducted (Table S1†) to elucidate the origin of the significant energy difference between Ts1a-H2O and Ts1a-TSOH (or Ts1b-H2O and Ts1b-TsOH) shown in Fig. 3. Preliminary calculation results indicated that the remarkable difference in the free energy barrier between TsOH catalysis and H2O catalysis probably comes from three factors, namely entropy, the solvation effect, and the nature of the catalyst itself. For entropy, the reaction catalyzed by TsOH is a bimolecular reaction (TsOH and 1), while the reaction catalyzed by two H2O molecules is a trimolecular reaction (two H2O molecules and 1), which is unfavorable in terms of entropy due to the extra molecule. Compared with TsOH catalysis, the two free energies (defined as G = H-TS) of two H2O catalysis increased by 8.9 kcal mol−1 because of entropy. As for the solvation effect, the increase in the free energy of the transition state for H2O catalysis is greater in the solvent than in the gas phase and increased by about 4.0 kcal mol−1 for the two free energies of two H2O catalysis relative to TsOH catalysis as a result of the solvation effect. The remaining 9.0 kcal mol−1 should be due to the nature of the catalyst itself. As is well known, the keto–enol tautomerism can be catalyzed by acids, and TsOH is more acidic than H2O, resulting in a more stable transition state (Ts1a-TsOH or Ts1b-TsOH).
It is worth mentioning that an alternative formation mechanism for dimers 3 involving aldol condensation between G and formaldehyde, followed by aza-Michael addition was considered possible, and attempts to form this aldol product in the absence of N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidine were unsuccessful (Table S4†), indicating that the more likely pathway is as described in Scheme 2.
Conclusion
In summary, the synthesis of novel pendant fullerene dimers has been successfully achieved by an aminomethylation reaction of ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines with N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines and paraformaldehyde in the presence of TsOH under air conditions. The current synthetic method using methyl ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines as reaction substrates exclusively produces unreported pendant fullerene dimers instead of the known bridged fullerene dimers for the first time. Moreover, the preparation of pendant fullerene dimers, especially those containing Cl, OCH3, and CF3 groups, will enable promising applications of pendant fullerene dimers in the field of PSCs by designing and synthesizing a series of novel organic photovoltaic materials on the basis of the current study.
Experimental section
General methods
Commercially available reagents and solvents were used without further purification. Purified fullerene products were obtained by flash chromatography over silica gel. UV-vis spectra were measured in CHCl3. IR spectra were collected with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 400, 600, or 700 MHz NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts in 1H NMR spectra were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) at 0.00 ppm, while chemical shifts in 13C NMR spectra were referenced to residual DMSO at 39.52 ppm. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed by MALDI-TOF in a negative/positive-ion mode.
Calculation method
All calculations were performed using Gaussian16 software.12 B3LYP density functional with the 6-31G(d) basis set was used to optimize the geometries. Frequency calculations were conducted to characterize the transition state (only one imaginary frequency) or local minima (no imaginary frequency), which also gave thermochemical corrections for free energies. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)13 calculations were performed to verify transition-state structures connected to corrected reactants and products. More accurate single-point energies were obtained using the m062x density functional with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. The self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) method and the SMD model14 in chlorobenzene solvent were used in single-point energy calculations.
General procedure for the synthesis of pendant fullerene dimers 3
Ketone-containing fulleropyrrolidines 1 (0.010 mmol), N-unsubstituted fulleropyrrolidines 2 (0.025 mmol), paraformaldehyde (2.1 mg, 0.07 mmol) and TsOH·H2O (3.8 mg, 0.020 mmol) were added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer. After they were completely dissolved in chlorobenzene (10 mL) by sonication, the resulting solution was put into an oil bath preset at 40 °C and stirred under air conditions.
