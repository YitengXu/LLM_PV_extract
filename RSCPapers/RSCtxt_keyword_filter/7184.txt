    , Accepted 17th March 2018First published on 21st March 2018AbstractStamping transfer has been considered as an alternative process for fabricating organic photovoltaic devices because of its various advantages such as a simple, flexible, and repeatable process, which is suitable for large-area fabrication. In this study, we fabricated organic flexible solar cells with enhanced cell performance and mechanical durability by performing a simple dry transfer of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer (HTL) with polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs). In order to ensure the stable flexibility of these flexible solar cells, cross-linked PS NPs synthesized with a size of 70 nm were introduced to the PEDOT:PSS HTL. The transfer of the PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs onto the polymer electrode (PH1000) was performed completely via stamping transfer with a polyurethane acrylate stamp. The power conversion efficiency of the PTB7:PC71BM-based flexible devices prepared by the transfer of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs was 5.71%, which was higher than that of the spin-cast device without PS NPs (5.37%). The tuned morphology of the PEDOT:PSS achieved through transfer and the increased surface area of the PEDOT:PSS resulting from the corrugated structure provided by the protruding PS NPs improved the charge transport from the active layer to the PEDOT:PSS HTL. This in turn resulted in an enhanced short-circuit current density. In addition, the introduced PS NPs significantly improved the mechanical stability of these flexible devices, allowing the devices prepared by the transfer of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs to tolerate more cycles of strain in the bending test. The introduced PS NPs enhanced the mechanical strength of PEDOT:PSS by acting as not only binders within PEDOT:PSS, but also as interfacial modifiers which can improve the interfacial adhesion between the active layer and PEDOT:PSS HTL. Thus, the transfer of a PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs will contribute to the long-term operation of flexible solar devices with enhanced device performance and mechanical durability.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) have attracted a large amount of attention because of their inherent advantages such as their light weight, flexible form factor, large-area applicability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness driven by solution processes.1–5 Recent studies have brought outstanding advancements in OPVs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of greater than 10%, bringing them close to the point of commercialization.6–13 With the considerable improvement in the PCE of solar cells, research into flexible solar cells utilizing transparent electrodes other than Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) has also been extensively conducted.14–21
Recent research has commonly used poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a hole-transporting layer (HTL) in OPVs because PEDOT:PSS possesses a suitable work function and electrical conductivity, as well as orthogonal processability and the usage of eco-friendly solvents.19–22 However, PEDOT:PSS HTLs also have a few drawbacks, including the strong acidity of PSS, its hygroscopic property, and its reduced conductivity at large strains. In addition, the weakest interfacial adhesion between the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS layer and the hydrophobic active layer in the layer-by-layer structure of the OPVs results in low mechanical integrity.23–27 Therefore, even when a small stress is applied, the interface between the two layers may be easily delaminated; this results in both poor stability and poor operation durability for these flexible devices.28–30 Despite the importance of mechanical durability in flexible OPVs, only a few previous studies have improved the mechanical properties of this device by modifying the PEDOT:PSS HTL.31–34 For example, Kang et al. previously reported enhanced mechanical properties of OPVs achieved by using polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) to modify the PEDOT:PSS HTL.35
Various alternative processes have recently been developed to replace the existing spin-coating process in the fabrication of flexible OPVs in order to utilize advantages such as large-area applicability and cost-effectiveness.36–42 In particular, the stamping transfer process has been studied extensively as an alternative process because of the significant improvements in the PCE and stability of the OPVs resulting from this process. This is achieved by the transfer of various materials used as optimized layers with controlled morphology and thickness in the OPV.43–51 The stamping transfer process also has a significant advantage in its potential use in industrial applications for low-cost, flexible, and large-area electronic devices.52–54 Additionally, the solvent intermixing problem, a major drawback of various solution processes, can be avoided with the use of the stamping transfer process. Furthermore, a simple and repeatable stamping transfer process is readily compatible with the roll-to-roll process.
In this study, we demonstrate the improved performance and mechanical durability of flexible OPVs by performing a simple stamping transfer of PEDOT:PSS mixed with a PS NPs layer. First, cross-linked PS NPs with a size of 68 nm were synthesized by emulsion polymerization and blended with the PEDOT:PSS in order to enhance the mechanical properties of the PEDOT:PSS HTL. By applying the stamping transfer process using a polyurethane acrylate (PUA) stamp, the PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs layer was completely transferred onto the polymer electrode/flexible substrate; meanwhile, a corrugated surface structure spontaneously formed. The tuned morphology and work function (WF) of the PEDOT:PSS provided by the transfer and increased surface area due to the corrugated structure with PS NPs resulted in an improvement in the charge transport from the active layer to the PEDOT:PSS HTL. As a result, the device performance was enhanced. The flexible devices that were fabricated using the transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs HTL exhibited significant enhancement of mechanical stability when undergoing a bending test. The introduced PS NPs presumably enhanced the mechanical strength of the PEDOT:PSS as well as the interfacial adhesion between the PEDOT:PSS HTL and the active layer, as previously reported. As a result, we demonstrated that the stamping transfer process has great potential for use as an alternative process in the fabrication of flexible OPVs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the PUA/PC stamp
A solution comprising 19 g of urethane diacrylate oligomer (Ebecryl® 9270, SK Cytec) and 1 g of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (HCPK, Aldrich) was stirred vigorously at room temperature. The mixture was spread on a silicon wafer by covering with a polycarbonate (PC) film. Then, the sandwiched ultraviolet (UV)-curable resin was cured under UV light for 5 min. The PUA/PC stamp was detached from the silicon wafer.
2.2. Synthesis of the PS NPs
Purified styrene monomer, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) (Mw = 55 000 g mol−1), divinylbenzene (DVB), and 2,2-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) (AIBA) were used in the polymerization of the PS NPs. The styrene monomer was purified by the use of an aluminum oxide column, and the remaining organic reagents were prepared without further purification. Next, 0.25 g of PVP, the cross-linkable reagent DVB (28.5 μL), and styrene monomer (1 g) were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized (DI) water in a two-neck flask, and the solution was stirred at 50 °C for 1 h. After AIBA (0.026 g) was added to the solution, the reaction temperature was gradually increased to 70 °C. After 24 h at 70 °C, the products were cooled down to room temperature and filtered through filter paper. The resulting PS NPs were repeatedly purified by centrifugation in methanol, and DI water to remove the residual monomer and PVP.
2.3. Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
Commercial PEDOT:PSS (PH1000, Clevious) was used as a polymer electrode. Dimethylsulfoxide (5 vol%) was added to the PEDOT:PSS, and the solution was then spin-coated onto an oxygen-plasma-treated polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) flexible substrate. After annealing at 150 °C for 20 min, the process was repeated to form multilayer films. To prepare the HTL, the synthesized PS NP solution was added to the PEDOT:PSS (AI4083, Clevious) solution at different volume fractions, and these mixtures were diluted with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (1:1 volume ratio). The PEDOT:PSS HTL was spin-coated onto the PUA/PC stamp and stamped onto the PH1000/PEN substrate by rubbing with cotton swabs at 90 °C. After the PUA/PC stamp was detached, the transferred PEDOT:PSS HTL with PS NPs was annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. In the case of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS as a reference, the PEDOT:PSS HTL without PS NPs was directly spin-coated onto the PH1000/PEN substrate for 30 s at 4000 rpm and annealed under the same conditions as the transferred film. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solution was prepared by blending 10 mg of poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)-carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7, 1-material Inc. OS0007) and 15 mg of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, EM Index) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene with 3 vol% 1,8-diiodoctane. The BHJ active layer was spin-coated onto the transferred PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s in a glove box. In order to include an electron extraction layer, a TiOx interlayer (10 mM of the titanium(IV) isopropoxide precursor diluted in IPA) was spin-coated onto the active layer at 5000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, the 100 nm thick Al cathode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area was fixed at 0.09 cm2.
2.4. Characterization
Measurement using current density–voltage (J–V) curves was performed by a solar simulator (Peccell, PEC-L01) with a Keithley 2400 under the illumination of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2, as calibrated with a Si reference cell PECSI01; Bunkou Keiki Co., Ltd). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a power source (150 W Xe lamp) and a PEC-S20 (Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The time-resolved photoluminescent (TRPL) spectra were obtained by using a photon-counting spectrofluorometer (PC1, ISS) with a picosecond light pulser (C10196, Hamamatsu). To analyze the concentration of PSS in the PEDOT:PSS layer and the work function of the PEDOT:PSS films, multi-purpose X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS with UPS, Thermo VG Scientific) was implemented. The surface morphology was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Veeco, U.S.A.; non-contact tapping mode, D3100). A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Sirion) was used to measure the size distribution of the synthesized PS NPs and to investigate the surface morphologies of the PEDOT:PSS films after the bending tests.
3. Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the sequential process used for the transfer of the PEDOT:PSS HTL mixed with PS NPs to fabricate the PTB7/PC71BM-based flexible solar cell. The PS NPs synthesized by emulsion polymerization were mixed with the PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) solution and diluted with IPA to a desired concentration. The blended PEDOT:PSS HTL solution was spin-coated onto a PUA/PC stamp and directly stamped onto a polymer electrode (PH1000)/PEN flexible substrate by rubbing with cotton swabs at 90 °C. After the PUA/PC stamp was detached the PEDOT:PSS film with PS NPs was completely transferred. To fabricate the PTB7/PC71BM-based flexible solar cell, a PTB7/PC71BM active layer and TiOx interlayer were deposited sequentially by spin-coating onto the transferred PEDOT:PSS layer. The aluminum electrode was then formed by thermal evaporation in a vacuum. In previous reports, PS NPs demonstrated an ability to enhance the mechanical properties of the solar cells by modifying the PEDOT:PSS layer.35 By stamping transfer of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs, we expected both enhanced efficiency and mechanical strength with a roll-to-roll compatible process.

Fig. 1 shows images of the synthesized PS NPs and the surface of the transferred PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs as measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The monodispersed and cross-linked PS NPs were synthesized by emulsion polymerization.55 As shown in Fig. 1a, PS NPs with diameters of 68 ± 0.7 nm were successfully synthesized via the control of the concentration of reactants.35,56 (The detailed reaction conditions are described in the Experimental section.) Because the PS NPs were cross-linked, swelling or dissolution of the corrugated surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer with the PS NPs could be prevented during the spin-coating of the active layer dissolved in the organic solvent.57 The PS NPs could be mixed in the PEDOT:PSS solution to form a stable dispersion because they were originally dispersed in water. The PS NPs were blended into the PEDOT:PSS solution at various volume fractions, ϕNP (namely, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6). The blended solutions were then diluted with IPA (1:1 volume ratio) in order to improve the wetting on the PUA/PC stamp. Fig. 1b–d show the surface of the transferred PEDOT:PSS layer mixed with PS NPs at different volume fractions. As shown in the SEM images, the PEDOT:PSS layer was completely transferred with the PS NPs, which were well-dispersed within the PEDOT:PSS matrix. Kang et al. previously reported that PEDOT:PSS could form a continuous film at a low volume fraction, even at 0.2, via the hexagonal packing structure of the PS NPs.56 Therefore, the PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs can have a continuous morphology even after transfer. As a result, the spontaneously formed, corrugated structure of the PEDOT:PSS HTL could be fabricated by a simple one-step stamping transfer process. The fractions of PS NPs on the surface of the transferred PEDOT:PSS films were 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15, corresponding to ϕNP values of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6, respectively. The dilution of the solution with IPA presumably resulted in a smaller surface fraction of PS NPs as compared with the volume fraction.

To investigate the corrugated surface structure of the transferred PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs, the surface morphologies were measured by using an atomic force microscope and SEM (tilted view), as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and b show the surface morphologies of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS and transferred PEDOT:PSS, respectively. Fig. 2c and d respectively display the AFM image with the corresponding cross-sectional profiles and the tilted-view SEM image of the transferred PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs. In contrast to the PEDOT:PSS films without PS NPs, the transferred PEDOT:PSS film with PS NPs showed a corrugated surface morphology with hemispheres. The average height of the hemispheres on the surface was approximately 40 nm. The average height of the hemispheres (40 nm) matched well the difference in the average diameter of the PS NPs (68 nm) and the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer (≈30 nm) used in this study. From the AFM images, the root-mean-square (RMS) values for the spin-coated, transferred PEDOT:PSS and transferred PEDOT:PSS with the PS NPs layer were found to be 1.04, 0.83 and 6.17 nm, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†).

To investigate the performance of the transferred PEDOT:PSS with the PS NPs layer used as an HTL, PTB7:PC71BM-based flexible solar cells were fabricated by stamping transfer of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs with different ϕNP values (Fig. 3). The structure of the devices consisted of PEN/PEDOT:PSS (PH1000)/PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) with PS NPs/PTB7:PC71BM/TiOx/Al. Table 1 summarizes the average photovoltaic properties obtained by measuring five cells for each case under the illumination of 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G). The average PCE of the flexible device fabricated by spin-coating was 5.37%, which is slightly lower than that of the ITO-based device (7.39%), as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The major reason for this decrease could be that the sheet resistance of the PH1000 electrode is higher than that of ITO at the same transmittance level. Fig. 3a and Fig. S3 (ESI†) show the PCEs and the corresponding J–V curves of the flexible solar cells achieved by stamping transfer of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs with different ϕNP values. Until ϕNP had reached the percolation threshold, the transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs devices exhibited performance comparable to that of the transferred PEDOT:PSS without PS NPs device (5.67%). An optimized PCE (5.71%) was obtained with the device with ϕNP = 0.4, which resulted from a counterbalance between the enhanced short-circuit current (Jsc) value (13.91 → 14.69 mA cm−2) and the decreased fill factor (54% → 52%) in comparison with that of the device with transferred PEDOT:PSS without PS NPs. Therefore, comparable performance of these devices can be achieved without any sacrifice of the PCE even with the addition of the PS NPs within the transferred PEDOT:PSS.

Interestingly, all of the devices fabricated by the stamping transfer of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs exhibited performance better than that of the device fabricated by spin-coating of PEDOT:PSS without PS NPs. For a better understanding of this improvement, the device fabricated by the transfer of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs (ϕNP = 0.4, denoted as “transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs” in Fig. 3) was compared with the devices fabricated by spin-coating and the transfer of PEDOT:PSS without PS NPs (denoted as “spin-coated PEDOT:PSS” and “transferred PEDOT:PSS”, respectively, in Fig. 3b). The average PCE was enhanced from 5.37% of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS to 5.67, and 5.71% of transferred PEDOT:PSS without and with PS NPs, respectively. The major reason for the enhancement of PCE was the increased Jsc value. Because of the transfer of PEDOT:PSS without and with PS NPs, Jsc was gradually increased from 13.35 to 13.91 and 14.69 mA cm−2, respectively. The EQE results (Fig. 3c) confirm that the incident photocurrent conversion efficiency of the transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs was higher than those of the spin-coated PEDOT:PSS and transferred PEDOT:PSS. The integrated Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra were 12.76, 13.28, and 14.09 mA cm−2 for the spin-coated PEDOT:PSS, transferred PEDOT:PSS, and transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs, respectively. This tendency for increase suggested by the values of the integrated Jsc is similarly shown by the measured Jsc. The increasing trend of the Jsc values may be attributed to the improvement in the charge transport at the interface between the active layer and the PEDOT:PSS HTL. To compare the charge transport behaviors from the active layer to the PEDOT:PSS layer, we obtained TRPL decay curves of the hole-only devices, which consisted of a PEN/PH1000/PEDOT:PSS HTL/PTB7 donor layer, for each fabrication type of HTL (shown in Fig. 3d). The PL decay demonstrated by the transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs was faster than that of the transferred PEDOT:PSS and spin-coated PEDOT:PSS. In order to confirm the changes in relaxation dynamics, the average PL lifetime (τav) was calculated from the deconvolution of the TRPL curves with a two-component exponential function. The τav of the transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs (0.434 ns) was shorter than that of the transferred PEDOT:PSS (0.463 ns), and it was much shorter than that of the spin-coated PEDOT:PSS (0.521 ns), as listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The shortened lifetime indicates that the hole transport from BHJ to HTL was more efficient in the transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs than in the spin-coated PEDOT:PSS.
In order to understand the origin of the improved charge transport of the transferred PEDOT:PSS without and with PS NPs, the work function of the PEDOT:PSS and the PSS concentration on the surface of the film were measured for each sample by the use of X-ray and UV photoelectron spectrometers (XPS and UPS; Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). Kim et al. previously reported that the performance of the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ device prepared using the dry transfer of PEDOT:PSS was significantly enhanced in comparison with the device prepared by spin-coating. The main reason for this is the reversed arrangement of the PSS-enriched region achieved by the dry transfer from the top of the film to the bottom.50 As shown in the XPS sulfur 2p survey in Fig. S4 (ESI†), 164 and 168 eV are assigned to the sulfur atoms of PEDOT and PSS, respectively.58,59 The decreased ratio of PSS to PEDOT on the surface of the transferred PEDOT:PSS film in comparison with the spin-coated film confirms that the reversed arrangement of the PSS-enriched region was achieved by dry transfer. Accordingly, improved carrier transport at the interface between PEDOT:PSS and BHJ was expected, because of the increased proportion of the amount of highly conductive PEDOT at the surface of the transferred PEDOT:PSS film. In addition, WF differed between the spin-coated PEDOT:PSS and transferred PEDOT:PSS relative to the amount of PSS at the surface of the film.50,58,59 The UPS spectra of the two different PEDOT:PSS samples (Fig. S5a, ESI†) showed that the transferred PEDOT:PSS possessed a WF (5.09 eV) lower than that of the spin-coated PEDOT:PSS (5.20 eV). Because the highest occupied molecular orbital energy of the PTB7 is 5.15 eV, the WF of the transferred PEDOT:PSS is more suitable for hole transport from BHJ than that of spin-coated PEDOT:PSS which requires a slightly larger energy barrier, originating from a slightly higher WF for hole transport, to be overcome. Therefore, Jsc could be enhanced in the case of the device prepared by using transferred PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S5b, ESI†).
In terms of the effects of the addition of PS NPs, the transferred PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs film possessed a corrugated surface with a height of 40 nm, whereas the PEDOT:PSS film without PS NPs possessed a surface roughness of only 1 nm, according to the RMS values in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The increased top surface area of the transferred PEDOT:PSS achieved by introducing the PS NPs can improve the hole extraction from the active layer to the PEDOT:PSS HTL. Because the percolated conducting pathway of the PEDOT:PSS domain could be maintained up to ϕNP = 0.8, the intrinsic conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films was also maintained even for addition of PS NPs.56 Consequently, improved hole transport from BHJ due to the increase in surface area and the retained conductivity after PS NP addition increased the Jsc of the device.
To investigate the effects of PS NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer on the mechanical durability of a flexible solar cell, bending tests for the flexible devices were performed up to 1000 times at a constant 4 mm bending radius (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a and Fig. S6a–c (ESI†) show the average normalized efficiencies and photovoltaic parameters of the flexible devices fabricated with and without PS NPs as a function of the number of bending cycles without encapsulation. After 1000 bending cycles, the devices containing PS NPs retained 65% of their original efficiency and demonstrated better stability as compared with the devices without PS NPs, which showed only 42% retention of the initial efficiency. Some devices fabricated without PS NPs were totally degraded before 1000 bending cycles were reached (Fig. S6d and e, ESI†). Thus, the fracture toughness of the PEDOT:PSS film can be improved by using PS NPs as particle-reinforced polymer composites.60 To understand the origin of the improved mechanical stability achieved by introducing PS NPs, the surface morphologies of the PEDOT:PSS films after 1000 cycles of bending were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4b, the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film without PS NPs ruptured and had numerous brittle fractures and deformations.61 Because the fractures disconnect the conducting pathway in the PEDOT:PSS grain, crack formation and propagation in the film caused by the bending stress could result in decreased electrical conductivity and device performance. In contrast, the PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs (Fig. 4c) exhibited far fewer distinct fractures without the further propagation of cracks because the PS NPs acted as binders within the PEDOT:PSS film.35

SEM images of the surface morphologies of the transferred PEDOT:PSS after applying 1000 bending cycles: (b) without PS NPs and (c) with PS NPs. 
To investigate the effect of hydrophobic PS NPs on the surface properties of the PEDOT:PSS film, contact angles for each of the samples were measured, and theoretical surface energies were calculated through the Young–Dupre equation using a two-liquid model (DI water and ethylene glycol).62 As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs showed a more hydrophobic surface. By performing the double cantilever beam fracture mechanics test and the Scotch tape peel test, Kang et al. previously demonstrated that the improvement of hydrophobicity of PEDOT:PSS by the introduction of PS NPs enhances the interfacial adhesion between the PEDOT:PSS layer and the active layer.35 Because the addition of hydrophobic PS NPs can improve the hydrophobicity of the surface of the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS, the introduced PS NPs presumably enhanced the interfacial adhesion between the PEDOT:PSS layer and the active layer. Consequently, the introduced PS NPs allowed the flexible device to tolerate higher mechanical deformations by enhancing the mechanical toughness and interfacial adhesion of the PEDOT:PSS layer.
4. Conclusions
We fabricated flexible organic solar cells by stamping transfer of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs onto a polymer electrode (PH1000). Notably, the PEDOT:PSS HTL with PS NPs was completely transferred accompanied by the spontaneous formation of a corrugated surface structure. Because of the increased surface area as a result of the introduced PS NPs and the modulation of the WF and morphology of PEDOT:PSS by the transfer process itself, charge transport from BHJ was improved. Hence, our simple dry transfer process with the addition of PS NPs can increase the initial PCE from 5.37% (spin-coating) to 5.71% for PTB7:PC71BM-based flexible solar cells. We also demonstrated that the addition of PS NPs effectively improves the mechanical durability of flexible solar cells. The introduced PS NPs acted not only as binders that can alleviate the crack growth within the PEDOT:PSS film, but also as interfacial modifiers that can enhance the interfacial adhesion between the BHJ active layer and PEDOT:PSS HTL. The improved mechanical stability of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs resulted in greatly enhanced flexible durability, which can ensure long-term operation of the flexible device. Consequently, the stamping transfer method of PEDOT:PSS with PS NPs proposed in this study has great potential application as an alternative process not only because of the efficiency provided by this process, but also because of its mechanical reliability.
