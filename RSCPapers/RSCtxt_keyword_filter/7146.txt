    , Accepted 17th January 2023First published on 18th January 2023AbstractAll-inorganic two-dimensional (2D) Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskite has a smaller layer spacing than conventional cation-induced 2D perovskite and may have potential applications in photoelectronic devices. To achieve high device efficiency, perovskite films in solar cells need high crystalline quality and will not react with the adjacent functional layer. In this study, Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskite films with fewer defects were fabricated through an intermediate-modulated crystallization process through the addition of formamidine hydrochloride (FACl) to the precursor. The transformation was mediated by chlorine-containing additives and proceeded via an intermediate phase that resulted in fewer defects in the perovskite lattice compared with the findings for Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 prepared without the additive. A further post-treatment with phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) avoided unfavorable direct-contact between the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film and spiro-based hole transport layer. Finally, the resulting 2D Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 based perovskite solar cells exhibited reproducible photovoltaic performance with a champion efficiency of 4.7%, which is the highest value reported to date for perovskite solar cells with such a vivid red color.
1. Introduction
Halide perovskites have drawn great research interest over the last decade owing to their remarkable optoelectronic properties, which show great promise for applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, and photodetectors.1–4 The latest certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have reached as high as 25.7%.5 Additionally, halide perovskite materials are also conveniently solution processable and have richly tunable compositional and structural features that may allow for tailoring of corresponding photoelectric properties.6–8 Currently, the most efficient PVSCs are based on halide perovskites composed mainly of APbX3 (A = methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), Cs, or any mixture thereof; X = I or mainly I with a little Br or Cl). Nevertheless, a key drawback of perovskite materials is their instability.9 Thus, in view of the many potential applications for PVSCs, research has focused on identifying new kinds of more stable halide perovskites and passivation approaches through compositional engineering.10–12 Cubic perovskite structures are a three-dimensional (3D) array of corner sharing BX6 octahedra with A site cations in cuboctahedral cavities. The general criteria for A, B, and X site ionic radii to form a 3D perovskite structure include a Goldschmidt tolerance factor (between 0.8 and 1.0) and octahedral factor (between 0.442 and 0.895).13 Thus, in compositional engineering, introducing precursors based on organic cations, such as organic monoamine and diamine cations, can wholly or partially rupture the 3D structure of the perovskite, resulting in a layered structure with large organic cations sandwiched between inorganic sheets.14–16 Such structures are called low-dimensional or two-dimensional (2D) perovskites and have attracted much scientific attention and exploration of their unique properties.17–20
In addition to the use of large organic cations in the construction of 2D perovskites, the substitution of X site anions can also form perovskites with layered structures.21,22 In all-inorganic perovskites, the use of different halides results in mixed-halide 2D perovskites, as for example Cs2PbCl2I2, which has the best theoretical and experimental stability among all-inorganic 2D perovskites. Furthermore, heterojunctions between 2D Cs2PbCl2I2 and 3D CsPbI3 perovskites may increase carrier lifetimes and in turn improve the PCE of PVSCs.23 Pseudo-halide ions are typically polyatomic ions that have similar ionic radii and chemical properties to their halide counterparts, and are also candidates for the substitution of X sites to stabilize 3D perovskites.24 Among several promising candidate pseudo-halide ions, the incorporation of the thiocyanate anion (SCN−) into perovskite films has received considerable attention.25–27 To date, it has been reported that SCN− incorporated into perovskites can act through SCN− substitution or addition to the lattice through surface passivation of the host ABI3 (A = MA, B = Pb or Sn) 3D perovskite lattice.
Recently, it has been found that when Pb(SCN)2 and MAI are mixed at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:2 as required to form a perovskite, a 〈100〉-oriented 2D-layered compound MA2PbI2(SCN)2 is formed, rather than a 3D perovskite MAPb(SCN)2I phase.28 In such layered perovskites, corner-sharing lead halide octahedra no longer form a 3D structure but instead generate a 2D [PbI4(SCN)2]4− framework, wherein SCN− and I− anions are located at axial and equatorial positions, respectively. Thus, spacing between the perovskite sheets in MA2PbI2(SCN)2 is much smaller than that in a 2D perovskite constructed with large A site organic cations. Although it was initially speculated that MA2PbI2(SCN)2 may have certain more attractive properties than 3D MAPbI3, it was later confirmed that A2PbI2(SCN)2 (A = MA or FA) has poor thermal and ambient stability, which greatly limit its practical applicability.29 On-going systematic research has revealed that an all-inorganic cesium-based SCN perovskite, Cs2PbI2(SCN)2, has better stability in dry air and heat.30,31 This improved stability likely results from the much severer restriction on the size of cations inserted between the octahedra induced by the linear SCN− anion compared with that induced by the spherical halide anion.32 Chueh et al. reported a Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film with a vivid red color, which when applied in PVSCs yielded a PCE of approximately 2%.33 On this basis, Meng et al. improved the preparation process of a Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 solar cell and achieved a champion PCE of 4.24%.26 However, research into Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 remains at a preliminary stage.
In this study, we fabricated 2D perovskite Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 crystal films with few defects by addition of formamidine hydrochloride (FACl) to Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 precursors. An intermediate phase containing Cl− ions in the 2D perovskite crystal lattice delayed the crystallization of Cs2PbI2(SCN)2. During the subsequent replacement of Cl− by I− ions, defects (i.e., I− vacancies) in the crystals tended to become filled. Further application of a phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) buffer layer to the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film overcame the difficulty of poor spread and prevented the corrosion of the spiro-based hole transport layer on the 2D perovskite films. Finally, Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 PVSCs with improved performance were obtained.
2. Experimental
2.1 General
To prepare 2D perovskite films, reagents including lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2, 99.5%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.999%), formamidinium chloride (FACl, 99.5%), phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr, 98%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8%), and isopropanol (IPA, anhydrous, >99.5%) were used as received. For device preparation, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, 99.9%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99%), tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine]-cobalt(III)-tris(bis-[trifluoromethylsulfonyl]imide) (FK 209 Co(III) TFSI salt, 99%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 98%), spiro-OMeTAD, and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%) were used. CsI, FACl, Li-TFSI, and Co TFSI salt were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light. DMSO, IPA, and TiCl4 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. tBP and spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Borun. CB was purchased from Acros. PTABr was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd (TCI). Pb(SCN)2 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich Japan. All materials were used as received without further purification. A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω per square was purchased from Pilkington TEC.
2.2 Material and precursor preparation
To prepare the precursor solution for the 2D perovskites, Pb(SCN)2 and CsI (1:2 molar ratio) were dissolved in DMSO to yield a 0.5 M precursor solution. Additional FACl was added to the precursor solution over a range of concentrations (0.01–0.10 M). The precursor solutions were stirred for 10 h at 70 °C.
For the hole transport layer (HTL), a solution of 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD in CB (1 mL) was first stirred at room temperature and then adjusted with 28.8 μL of tBP, 17.5 μL of a solution of 520 mg mL−1 Li-TFSI in acetonitrile, and 8 μL of a solution of Co TFSI salt in acetonitrile.
2.3 Device fabrication
The FTO substrate was ultrasonically cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol. After drying with compressed air, the substrate was treated with UV-O3 for 20 minutes. A TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) was prepared by immersing the FTO substrate in a solution of cold deionized water (200 mL) and TiCl4 (4.5 mL) at 70 °C for 1 hour. The substrate was next rinsed with and then stored in deionized water. Before use, an annealing process at 200 °C for 30 min and a treatment with UV-O3 for 30 minutes were applied before the deposition of the perovskite film. Both the perovskite precursor solutions and TiO2 substrates were heated to 70 °C before spin coating in a nitrogen glove box. The precursor solution was spin-coated (2000 rpm/30 s) on the TiO2 substrate, and the as-prepared film was annealed in a vacuum drying oven at 90 °C for 5 minutes. The annealed perovskite films were then subjected to a post-treatment with 40 μL of IPA containing 1 mg mL−1 PTABr, through the use of a spin-coating method (4000 rpm, 30 s). The post-treated perovskite film was next annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. Finally, the HTL was spin-coated by adding dropwise an HTL solution on the spinning substrate (3500 rpm/20 s). The devices were finished by deposition of a 65 nm Au cathode by thermal evaporation under 4 × 10−4 Pa.
2.4 Characterization
For material characterization, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with an X-ray diffractometer (SmartLab, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were acquired with a SU8010 (Hitachi High-Technologies Co.). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV2450 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded with a spectrophotometer (NanoLOG-TCSPC) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (PerkinElmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained with a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet iS50, USA). Contact angle measurements were collected with a Dataphysics OCA15EC.
For device characterization, the cell-effective area (0.09 cm2) was defined by using a black aperture mask. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a sunlight simulator (Xes-300T1, SANEI Electric, AM 1.5G) and calibrated against a standard silicon reference cell. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured in air with the use of a QE-R measurement system (Enli Technology).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) illustrates the solution-based fabrication process of the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 2D perovskite film through an intermediate-modulated crystallization and interface passivation method. The FACl additive was mixed into the precursor solution, which consisted of Pb(SCN)2 and CsI at a molar ratio of 1:2. After spin coating onto the FTO/TiO2 substrate, the film was vacuum annealed at 90 °C for 5 minutes. The annealed film had a vivid red color.33 For applications in PVSCs, PTABr was deposited onto the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film, which was subjected to a second annealing at 70 °C for 10 minutes in a nitrogen glove box. XRD patterns were acquired for three film types as shown in Fig. 1(b). The film fabricated with the FACl additive and PTABr passivation is denoted as FACl & PTABr, the pristine film fabricated without FACl and without further passivation is denoted as control, and the film fabricated with the addition of FACl but without further passivation is denoted as with FACl. The characteristic peaks of the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskite at (200), (400), and (600) were present in all three films.34 The locations of these peaks in the pristine film and those fabricated with FACl were exactly the same at 9.82°, 19.78°, and 29.78°. But, using the peak intensity of (104) as a reference, it was found that all the relative intensities of (200), (400), (600) and (020) peaks to the (104) peak increased a lot in the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films prepared with FACl. Considering the perpendicular relationship between (020) and (200) (also (400) and (600)) planes, simultaneous increase in the intensities of their corresponding diffraction peaks indicated a better perovskite structure of Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 than the control one. In the film subjected to passivation with PTABr, all three characteristic peaks shifted to higher diffraction angles by 0.6°. Moreover, relative to the (200), (400), and (600) peaks, the intensities of other peaks were decreased after the post-treatment. By further checking the XRD pattern for a Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film after a post-treatment with neat IPA solution (Fig. S1†), this result can be attributed to the IPA-induced partial dissolution of the underlying perovskite films.35,36

The as-fabricated Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 2D perovskite films were applied in PVSCs with the structure FTO/TiO2/Cs2PbI2(SCN)2/PTABr/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. A cross-sectional SEM image of the device is shown in Fig. 1(c), where thick films (FTO, perovskite, spiro-OMeTAD, and Au) are easily distinguishable. The typical thickness of the perovskite film was approximately 220 nm. The J–V curves of the PVSCs were recorded under standard AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Typical J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of PVSCs are shown in Fig. 1(d) and Table 1. The highest PCE was achieved by optimizing the concentration of FACl and PTABr used in the perovskite film preparation. A PCE of 4.70% was achieved for the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2-based PVSCs at an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V, a fill factor (FF) of 61.37%, and a short circuit current (Jsc) of 8.47 mA cm−2. This result represents the highest PCE reported for PVSCs based on Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 as the light absorbing layer. The Jsc was further confirmed by integrating over the IPCE curve (Fig. 1(e)). The main light absorption and utilization band was located in the range of 300–600 nm.

The addition of FACl to the precursor for the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskites and the use of the PTABr post-treatment improved the performance of the PVSCs. Notably, all the PVSCs based on the post-treatments with PTABr in the analysis of the role of FACl, and all the PVSCs were fabricated using the additive of FACl in the analysis of the role of PTABr. Fig. 2(a) shows the typical J–V curves of the PVSCs based on the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films prepared with different amounts of FACl added into the precursors. Statistical results are shown in Fig. 2(b). When FACl was added to the precursor, the PCE improvement was mainly because of the increase of Jsc. The maximum PCE was obtained for the addition of FACl at 0.02 M; further increases of the FACl concentration led to lower PCEs.

(b) Statistical analysis of the device efficiency for different FACl concentrations collected from 20 PVSCs. (c) XRD patterns of perovskite films prepared with different FACl concentrations and (d) expansions of characteristic peaks. 
The XRD patterns of the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films fabricated with different concentrations of FACl are shown in Fig. 2(c). The patterns were very similar and contained three characteristic peaks at (200), (400), and (600) assigned to the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 2D perovskite. However, the peaks shifted to higher diffraction angles as the FACl concentration was increased beyond 0.03 M, as seen from the expanded patterns (Fig. 2(d)). According to Bragg's law, the shifting of diffraction peaks toward higher values corresponds to a reduction of interplanar spacing. Thus, the shifts herein are inferred to result from the doping of Cl− into the 2D perovskite lattice. However, the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 2D perovskite film fabricated with 0.02 M FACl, which also provided the most efficient PVSCs, did not show any shifts in its XRD patterns.
The FACl additive appeared to affect the surface morphology of the as-fabricated films. The pristine Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film (Fig. 3(a)) comprised densely packed polygonal grains of irregular size. The film fabricated with 0.02 M FACl (Fig. 3(b)) had similar polygonal grains to those of the pristine film; however, further increases in the concentration of the FACl additive increased the average grain size of the films and was associated with the appearance of pinholes (Fig. S2†). When the FACl additive concentration was increased to 0.1 M, the as-fabricated film formed extremely large grains and areas of the exposed substrate. A large grain size and pinholes in photo-absorbing films are respectively beneficial and detrimental to PVSC applications. The balance of these factors may explain the initial increase in PCE with 0.02 M FACl and the subsequent decrease as the concentration of the FACl additive was increased further, as shown by J–V characterization.

The UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of the pristine Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film and a film fabricated with 0.02 M FACl are shown in Fig. 3(c) and the inset, respectively. The absorption spectra of the two films showed excitonic absorption with peaks at 583 nm, consistent with previously reported values, and the absorption onset elongated just over 700 nm.30,33 The relative intensity of the exciton absorption peak for the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film fabricated with the FACl additive was higher than that of the pristine film, which suggests a higher quality crystal structure of the 2D perovskite. Moreover, the exciton absorption peak showed a double-peak like shape especially in the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film prepared with the assistance of FACl, which has never been reported anywhere else before. It may arise from changes in crystallization, impurities and grain boundaries in the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film prepared with the assistance of FACl. But other possible reasons and some deep understanding are worth further investigation in the future.
The PL spectrum for Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 had features of two emission peaks, i.e., an intense one at ∼594 nm and a small peak at ∼693 nm. It was deduced that the singlet emission (SE) was responsible for the intense peak, while the minor emission was associated with triplet emission (TE) or defective states.33 As shown in the inset of Fig. 3(c), the relative intensity of the SE peak at 594 nm to the emission peak associated with TE or defects at 693 nm is much larger for the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film prepared with the assistance of FACl than that for the control sample. This result confirmed to some extent that the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films prepared by our approach had a better crystal structure and fewer defects than the control sample. TRPL spectra were recorded and fitted with biexponential functions to investigate the effect of addition with 0.02 M FACl on the carrier lifetimes of the perovskite layers, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The deduced carrier lifetimes are summarized in the inset. Compared with the pristine film, the film fabricated with 0.02 M FACl had longer carrier-lifetimes, which is beneficial for applications in PVSCs.
To study the dynamic process of perovskite film preparation with 0.02 M FACl, we recorded the XRD patterns of films fabricated with different annealing times, from 1 to 6 min, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Expansions of the (200) and (400) characteristic peaks revealed the dynamics of the perovskite lattice development. The (200) and (400) peaks initially appeared at slightly higher diffraction angles than those of the final film, which suggests that interplanar spacing decreased during the annealing process. Considering that Cl− has a smaller ionic radius than I−, an intermediate Cs2PbI2−xClx(SCN)2 phase is likely formed, which eventually converts to Cs2PbI2(SCN)2. This process took place within 5 minutes of annealing for 0.02 M FACl. The nature of such intermediates has been found to play a key role in the growth of perovskite films by altering nucleation dynamics.37 Slowing the perovskite formation likely improves the growth of crystal domains during annealing.38,39 Thus, when FACl was added to the precursor, the slower formation of 2D Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 contributes to larger grain sizes, as shown by SEM imaging.

(c) and (d) XPS patterns of the control film and films prepared with 0.02 M FACl annealed for different times. (e) Space charge limited current curves of electron-only devices based on the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films with 0.02 M FACl annealed for different times. (f) J–V curves of PVSCs with 0.02 M FACl annealed for different times. 
The XPS results of films subjected to different annealing times also indicated the formation of an intermediate phase during the synthesis of Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films. Fig. S3† and 4(c) show data for Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films prepared with and without FACl, annealed for different durations. The binding energies for Pb, I, and Cs were the same in both these films; however, films treated with FACl and annealed for 3 min had lower electron binding energies for all Pb, I and Cs atoms. The lower electron binding energies of Pb, I and Cs are attributed to the shielding effect of more electrons induced by the FACl additive in the systems. Peaks corresponding to Cl (Fig. 4(d)) appeared in both films prepared with FACl at 3, 5 and 6 min annealing times. The larger binding energy confirmed a change of Cl coordination during the synthesis process of Cs2PbI2(SCN)2. Except for the presence of Cl peaks, the binding energies of all other elements in the final films prepared with and without FACl were the same.
Space charge limited current analysis was performed on electron-only devices with an FTO/TiO2/Cs2PbI2(SCN)2/PCBM/Au structure. The I–V curves are shown in Fig. 4(e) and the J–V curves of PVSCs based on films with 0.02 M FACl annealed for different times are shown in Fig. 4(f). The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) can be extracted from the crossing point of the two fitting curves, which correspond to two different conduction mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 4(e), the VTFL values of Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 devices prepared with 0.02 M FACl were smaller than those of devices prepared without FACl. The values also gradually decreased with a longer annealing time. The lower VTFL corresponds to a lower trap-state density for the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films, which will benefit PVSC performance. The efficiency of the solar cells based on varied films increased with the annealing time. Solar cells with good performance can be found in the devices based on the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film prepared with the assistance of 0.02 M FACl annealed for 5 or 6 min. Actually, further prolonging the annealing times didn't induce further increase of PCE (Fig. S4†).
We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the formation of Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 to compare the synthesis approaches with and without the FACl additive. The two main mechanisms by which FACl addition may act are illustrated in Fig. 5. Considering that the iodine vacancy is a common defect in perovskite films prepared by the liquid phase method, it is more appropriate to take the iodine-vacancy-containing unit as the starting point of simulation calculation to analyze the subsequent changes of chlorine containing intermediates. Starting with the intermediate Cs2PbI2−xClx(SCN)2, the upper path in Fig. 5 shows Cl− in the Cs2PbI2−xClx(SCN)2 lattice being replaced with I− (Fig. S5†). This structure is also consistent with the changes in XRD features. The lower path shows I− vacancies in Cs2PbI2−xClx(SCN)2 becoming easier to fill than in Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 owing to the lower incorporation energy (Fig. S6†). Combining these two mechanisms based on numerical calculations suggests that an intermediate phase of Cs2PbI2−xClx(SCN)2 is formed during the growth of Cs2PbI2(SCN)2, which not only delays crystallization but also results in more I− vacancies becoming filled.

A spiro-OMeTAD HTL is one of the most widely used HTLs in PVSCs and is easily fabricated by spin-coating a solution onto the surfaces of different perovskite layers. However, the spiro-OMeTAD HTL solutions spread poorly on the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films (Fig. S7†). As shown in Fig. 6(a), a surface SEM of the HTL showed a rough morphology with scattered grains rather than a typical flat appearance. PTABr used as a post-treatment of the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film decreased the contact angles of the spiro-HTL solution from 45.0° to 19.3° (inset of Fig. 6(a) and (b)). SEM imaging showed that the surface regained a smooth morphology (Fig. 6(b)). The performance of the PVSCs was further boosted through the use of PTABr as a post-treatment. Fig. 6(c) shows the J–V curves of PVSCs with different degrees of PTABr post-treatment and without post-treatment. The Voc was higher in devices treated with an appropriate amount of PTABr. The PVSCs fabricated with 1 mg PTABr post-treatment of the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film gave the champion PCE. The Voc values of PVSCs are closely related to interfacial recombination across the whole device. The use of an appropriate amount of PTABr avoids undesirable contact between Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 and the spiro-HTL layers. However, excessive amounts of PTABr are detrimental to the PCE.

PTABr has been reported as a post-treatment for CsPbI3 perovskite films, in which Br-doping (or alloying) affects the underlying perovskite.40 This effect was also found in our experiments. The XRD patterns (Fig. S8†) indicated a shift of characteristic diffraction peaks in the 2D Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskite to higher angles after the post-treatment with PTABr. Hence, Br− incorporates into the 2D perovskite lattice. The gradient distribution of Br in Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films is further shown by EDX results (Fig. S9†). The XPS results (Fig. S10†) indicate that compared with the untreated Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film, the PTABr post-treated film had new peaks assigned to the N-containing components of PTABr. The binding energies of Pb, Cs, I and other atoms assigned to Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 were also lower. This result is consistent with a previous report of the incorporation of Br and the retention of PTA groups at the perovskite surface.40
Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 films were found to easily decompose in humid air.33 Photos (Fig. S11†) showed that the vivid red color of the control Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film faded almost completely within 12 hours. Although the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film prepared with the assistance of FACl and PTABr post-treatment was relatively a bit more stable than the other two cases after 12 hour's exposure, decomposition in it had already taken place in the first 4 hours. So, the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2-based devices can't be stable in ambient air without encapsulation. Thus, stability measurements of the devices were performed by placing the unencapsulated device in a nitrogen glove box. The changes in the PCE of typical samples over this period are plotted in Fig. 6(d). As seen, the device based on the Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 film prepared with the assistance of FACl and PTABr post-treatment retained 80.7 percent of its initial efficiency after 800 hours. And it is a bit more stable than the device based on the control perovskite film.
4. Conclusion
The addition of FACl to precursor solutions effectively improved the growth of 2D Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 crystals by inducing an intermediate phase that regulated the crystallization process, resulting in the formation of perovskites with fewer defects. Delayed crystallization also resulted in films with larger grain sizes. Accordingly, photo-induced carrier lifetimes were increased. Thus, the performance of solar cells based on these films was improved. PTABr was also used as an effective buffer layer to further improve the efficiencies of the solar cells. By both blocking the interaction between Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 and spiro-HTL and the doping or alloying effect on the perovskite films of PTABr, the Voc of PVSCs increased. The performance of the as-fabricated PVSCs based on 2D Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 with a vivid red color herein is the highest reported. This study develops an understanding and fabrication technology for all-inorganic 2D Cs2PbI2(SCN)2 perovskites applied in solar cells.
