    , Accepted 12th May 2015First published on 14th May 2015AbstractWe fabricated a perovskite solar cell with enhanced device efficiency based on the tailored inner space of the TiO2 electrode by utilizing a very short chemical etching process. It was found that the mesoporous TiO2 photoanode treated with a HF solution exhibited remarkably enhanced power conversion efficiencies under simulated AM 1.5G one sun illumination. The controlled inner space and morphology of the etched TiO2 electrode provide an optimized space for perovskite sensitizers and infiltration of a hole transport layer without sacrificing its original electron transport ability, which resulted in higher JSC, FF and VOC values. This simple platform provides new opportunities for tailoring the microstructure of the TiO2 electrode and has great potential in various optoelectronic devices utilizing metal oxide nanostructures.
Introduction
During the past several decades, dye-sensitized solar cells have been considered a promising alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices such as Si, CdSe and CIGS.1,2 Despite power conversion efficiencies as high as 13% obtained using mesoporous TiO2, a porphyrin sensitizer and a cobalt electrolyte, dye-sensitized solar cells still suffer from long-term stability problems because of the use of liquid electrolytes containing the iodide/tri-iodide redox couple, which causes serious leakage problems.3 Recently, new types of solar cells with light absorbers including organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite structures possessing excellent absorption coefficients have attracted attention because of their high efficiency.4–8 An inorganic sensitizer based on CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals has been coated on a TiO2 electrode and a PCE of 19.3% was achieved.9,10
Analogous with conventional dye-sensitized solar cells, electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band of the perovskite absorbers after absorbing photons from the sun, followed by the exciton separation achieved by the injection of an electron into the mesoscopic TiO2 electrode and a hole in the hole conductor.11 The production of electricity can be completed by the transport of transferred electrons in TiO2 to a FTO substrate and holes via the hole conductor to a metal electrode, generating a voltage equal to the difference in the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in TiO2 and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) potential of the hole conductor.5 The electron diffusion length of TiO2 is ∼4.4 μm in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, but, so far, the highest efficiency of solid-state perovskite solar cells has been obtained with a mesoporous TiO2 thickness of less than 0.5 μm because of the poor hole transport ability of organic hole conductors.12 Mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle films have mainly been employed in perovskite solar cells because the best efficiencies from CH3NH3PbI3 result from device architectures where the deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 has been optimized to fill the mesopores of the TiO2 film. Controlling the morphology of the nano-crystalline TiO2 film with a film thickness in the sub-micron range is crucial to maximize the power conversion efficiency and is also very challenging. The simplest way to control the pore structures of TiO2 films realizing co-penetration and coating of the perovskite sensitizer and hole transport layers (HTLs) is to use various TiO2 nanoparticles with different sizes while maintaining the total film thickness.13 Therefore, many research groups have previously focused on using relatively large TiO2 sizes (40–50 nm) to enlarge the inner spaces for the infiltration of sensitizers and HTL.10 However, the specific surface area of the film to adsorb a large amount of sensitizer particles is inversely proportional to the TiO2 particle size, which is another obstacle in achieving high performance. Recently, even though one-dimensional TiO2 and ZnO nanostructures provide a direct electron transport path and a better pore structure for filling of the sensitizers and hole transport materials, perovskite solar cells based on a one-dimensional TiO2 nanostructure exhibit lower light-harvesting efficiency compared to conventional TiO2 nanoparticle films due to their excessively reduced volumetric surface area.14–16 To address this issue and to realize a finely tailored inner space of a conventional TiO2 nanoparticle electrode without complexity, we utilized one-step, low temperature, sub-nanometer etching of a pre-formed TiO2 film using a simple wet etching process. This technique can effectively tune the inner space of the mesoscopic TiO2 film to result in high efficiency solid-state perovskite solar cells. The wet etching process has mostly been used in microfabrication applications to chemically remove layers from the surface of a substrate like Si wafers during the manufacturing process.
Here, we report high efficiency perovskite solar cells based on a chemically etched TiO2 photoanode. The etched TiO2 structure provides an optimized inner space for better filling of perovskite sensitizers and HTLs. The results indicate that 30 seconds etchant solution treatment enlarges the pores of the pre-formed TiO2 electrode on FTO effectively. As a result, remarkable PCE enhancement could be achieved under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) irradiation. This simple method produces efficient perovskite solar cells with a tailored inner space of the TiO2 film. Furthermore, the results also reveal that surface engineering strategies for TiO2 electrodes could be one of the effective methods to produce efficient perovskite solar cells with a PCE exceeding 20%.
Results and discussion
The schematic in Fig. 1a describes the chemical etching process of TiO2. The device structure of the perovskite solar cells is shown in Fig. 1b with the etched TiO2 electrode with controlled inner spaces. The surface of TiO2 can be dissolved using a HF solution through the following reaction.17,18 TiO2 + 6HF → [TiF6]2− + 2H2O + 2H+(1)

Commercial TiO2 nanoparticles with an anatase crystalline phase and particle sizes of around 20 nm were employed in this study as a model system for use in perovskite solar cells. Because the etching process on TiO2 nanoparticles is very sensitive to the concentration of the HF solution, we utilized a 0.1 M HF solution in this study (see Experimental in the ESI†). To observe and understand the film morphology evolution during the etching process, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of various TiO2 films were obtained as a function of etching time, as shown in Fig. 2. The etched TiO2 thin films have various pore sizes, which could be enlarged and controlled by adjusting the etching time (Fig. 2a–e). However, as shown in Fig. 2e, exceeding a critical point results in a collapsed film (∼300 s). Fig. S1a–e† shows the cross-section SEM images of the TiO2 photoanodes obtained at different etching times, which demonstrates that the etching process also influences film thickness. The etched TiO2 photoanodes show reduced thicknesses compared to the original value of 260 nm with thicknesses of 250, 225, 190, and 175 nm for the films etched for 10, 30, 60, and 90 s, respectively (Fig. 2f). Fig. 2f also shows that the thickness of the TiO2 films decreased almost linearly as a function of time, indicating that the chemical etching process has the advantage of allowing convenient control of the thickness of the photoanode by simply adjusting the time.

To evaluate the influence of chemical etching on the crystallinity of the TiO2 nanoparticles, we obtained X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TiO2 nanoparticle films as a function of etching time. Fig. 3a shows the XRD patterns of the chemically etched TiO2 nanostructures, where the diffraction peaks are identical and identified as a pure anatase phase. In the case of the etched TiO2 films, the diffraction intensity was nearly the same, regardless of the etching time, as shown in Fig. 3a. Moreover, there are no noticeable changes in the energy band position before and after the etching process (Fig. S2†). This result was similarly observed for the TiO2 structures with a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite sensitizer, as shown in Fig. 3b. Apparently, the chemical etching process allows the control of the pore structures and thickness of the TiO2 film without sacrificing any other phase transformation. Fig. 3b also shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 film on the TiO2/FTO substrate with and without etching treatment. The set of peaks at 14.08°, 28.41°, 31.85°, and 43.19° assigned to (110), (220), (310), and (330) of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal,19 respectively, represent an orthorhombic crystal structure of halide perovskite and the high crystallinity of the halide perovskite is not influenced by the etching process. Fig. 3c shows the UV/Vis absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3-coated TiO2 photoelectrode as a function of chemical etching time. With increasing etching time, increased absorption of the photoelectrodes between 500 and 800 nm was observed, which can be attributed to the uniform coating of CH3NH3PbI3 on the TiO2 scaffolds due to the etching process. To confirm the enlarged pore volume in the TiO2 electrode, the freshly prepared and etched TiO2 films controlled to have the same film thickness were immersed in a conventional N719 dye solution (0.03 M) for 24 h and the number of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface was evaluated. In general, because dye adsorption is proportional to the TiO2 surface area, we predicted increased voids as a result of the etching process. The dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film were detached and collected using 0.1 M NaOH in water and ethanol solution. Following this experiment, the UV-Vis spectral intensities of each dissolved dye solution were observed (Fig. S3†) and compared. Fig. 3d shows a qualitative comparison of the adsorbed dyes on the TiO2 film as a function of film thickness. The amounts of dye adsorbed on the etched TiO2 films were different from that on the fresh TiO2 film, which supports the idea of increased voids inside the etched TiO2 films.

Fig. 4a and b show a cross-sectional SEM images of a reference solar cell device and an etched device (30 s). As shown in the previous SEM images of etched TiO2 films (Fig. 2), the etching process also affects the top surface morphology of the TiO2 film along with the individual particle morphology, in which a rougher surface was observed. Apparently, the HTM surface morphology coated on the etched TiO2 film also has similar characteristics resembling the top surface of the TiO2 film. The enlarged pores of the TiO2 film are infiltrated with CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and HTM more efficiently and, thus, more enhanced device performance was obtained. We measured the photocurrent density–potential (J–V) characteristics of perovskite solar cells based on the etched TiO2 electrodes and the results are shown in Fig. 4c and Fig. S4 and 5.† Note that we selected the cell with the average efficiency among 10 individual cells for each variable. The perovskite solar cells based on the conventional 225 nm thick TiO2 film showed a VOC of 0.92 V, a FF of 73.61%, and a JSC of 15.00 mA cm−2 to yield an efficiency of 10.12%. In contrast, the perovskite solar cell based on the 30 s etched ∼225 nm thick TiO2 film exhibited a VOC of 0.94 V, a FF of 75.74%, and a JSC of 16.10 mA cm−2 to yield a solar conversion efficiency of 11.51%. Note that because the etching process influences the film morphology and thickness simultaneously, we prepared a ∼260 nm thick TiO2 film to obtain a ∼225 nm thick TiO2 film after the 30 s etching process (see Table 1 for photovoltaic parameters). The J–V characteristics of perovskite solar cells depend on the TiO2 film thickness as shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1.† The IPCE spectra as shown in Fig. 4d confirm that the etching process improves the light harvesting efficiency, especially for the 10 s and 30 s etched TiO2 cases at wavelengths in the range of 300 to 800 nm, which indicates that the chemically-etched TiO2 photoanodes utilize generated electrons more efficiently even though they show reduced light absorption (Fig. 3c). The higher Voc and FF values for the solar cells based on etched TiO2 films with better infiltration of perovskite and HTM are likely caused by efficient charge separation and transportation at the 3 phase interface (TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM). However, further increases of the chemical etching time resulted in gradual weakening of the current density after 30 s. This result was ascribed to the presence of disconnected channels and an insufficient surface area which result in excessive volume loss in the TiO2 photoanode.20Fig. 4e and f show electron diffusion coefficients (De) and electron recombination time (τR), where De in perovskite solar cells based on 30 s etched TiO2 is similar to conventional perovskite solar cells. Fig. 4e is indicative of indirect evidence of electron injection and a similarity of the electron pathway as well. Similar electron transport behavior indicates that the TiO2 nanoparticles are connected well after 30 s etching. Fig. 4f shows that the electron recombination becomes slower in the perovskite solar cell based on 30 s etched TiO2, which suggests that more electrons are probably injected from a perovskite sensitizer into the TiO2. The electron–hole pairs are effectively separated in the perovskite layer with 30 s etched TiO2 because of a well penetrated perovskite and HTM. The higher VOC and FF values for the solar cells based on etched TiO2 films are due to the enlarged pores providing efficient charge separation and transport.

Conclusion
In summary, we fabricated high efficiency perovskite solar cells with tailored inner spaces of a TiO2 film as a result of the 30 s solution etching process. Presumably, the efficiency enhancement was strongly correlated to better pore filling of the sensitizers and HTLs despite the reduction of the specific surface area compared to the neat TiO2 film. The perovskite solar cells based on the etched TiO2 film not only demonstrate a higher JSC, but also exhibit increased VOC and FF values, leading to significantly improved photovoltaic performance. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency of 11.51% was achieved with the 30 s etched TiO2 photoanode under AM 1.5 simulated sun light irradiance (100 mW cm−2). The results suggest that this simple chemical etching process is very effective in controlling the film morphology and thickness of metal oxide films at sub-micron thickness. The chemical etching process can be extended to modify other metal oxides and thus represents a means of obtaining high performance optoelectronics.
Experimental details
Perovskite sensitizer synthesis
A hydroiodic acid (0.227 mol, 57 wt% in water, Aldrich) and methylamine (0.273 mol, 40% in methanol, TCI) solution was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h. The solution was evaporated at 60 °C which produced CH3NH3I. The precipitate was washed three times with diethyl ether, dried under vacuum, and used without further purification. To prepare CH3NH3PbI3, readily synthesized CH3NH3I (0.395 g) and PbI2 (1.157 g, 99% Aldrich) were mixed in γ-butyrolactone (2 mL, 99% Aldrich) at 70 °C for 2 h while stirring.
Chemical etching method
An acid solution was prepared by mixing 0.1 M hydrofluoric acid in deionized water. The solution was heated to 100 °C. After heating the solution, we immersed the sintered TiO2 photoanodes for different times. Then, the etched TiO2 photoanodes were withdrawn and washed with ethanol.
Solar cell fabrication
FTO glass substrates were cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water, and then dried with nitrogen gas. To make a dense TiO2 blocking layer, the cleaned FTO glass substrates were coated with 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75% Aldrich) in an ethanol (Aldrich) solution by a spin-coating method and then heated at 125 °C for 10 min. After the coated film was cooled down to room temperature, the process was repeated. The FTO glass substrates coated twice with TiO2 precursor solutions were heated at 500 °C for 30 min. On the prepared dense TiO2 blocking layer, the nanocrystalline TiO2 paste was deposited by the spin-coating method and the deposited film was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After the etching process, the TiO2 films were annealed one more time. The prepared TiO2 films were coated with the perovskite precursor solution, followed by heating at 100 °C for 15 min.
The HTM was then deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The spin coating formulation was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), 28.8 ml of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 ml of a stock solution of 520 mg ml−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide in acetonitrile in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. For the counter electrode, a 60 nm thick Au film was deposited on the top of the HTM overlayer by thermal evaporation, where Au was evaporated under vacuum at 10−6 Torr.
Device characterization
A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Jeol JSM 6700F) was used to investigate the morphology of the solid state devices. The optical absorbance spectra of the dye dissolved solution were recorded by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453). The photocurrent and voltage were measured by using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter.
Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements were carried out to determine the electron transport and recombination characteristics. For IMPS/IMVS measurements, the solar cells were illuminated under a red LED (λ = 635 nm), in which the amplitude of the AC light modulation was 10% of the DC light intensity using a function generator. The IMPS/IMVS were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. The De value was obtained by a time constant (τc) and the TiO2 film thickness (d) using the equation De = d2/(2.77 τc).
