    , Accepted 8th September 2014First published on 15th October 2014AbstractQuaternary Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) semiconductor thin films, deposited onto an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) conducting substrate by sulfurizing direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtered Cu–Zn–Sn metal alloys, were used as the counter electrode (CE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy reveal that all the samples show the kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 phase. The morphology becomes smoother for the Cu-rich or Zn-rich sample, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The influence of the [Cu]/[Zn] + [Sn] molar ratio in the CZTS samples on the catalytic performance of DSSCs was also investigated. The electrocatalytic ability and electrochemical properties of the CEs were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel plots. The performance of DSSCs with various CEs was verified by J–V curves and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves. The maximum solar-to-electrical power efficiency of DSSCs using CZTS as the CE approached 7.94%. These results showed the attractive potential of CZTS to replace the Pt CE (8.55%). The influence of different molar ratios of CZTS CEs on the DSSC performance is discussed in detail.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively studied in recent years, because of their attractive benefits such as high cell conversion efficiency, low cost and easy preparation procedures.1–4 A typical DSSC consists of a nanocrystalline TiO2/dye photo-anode, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE). The counter electrode is an important component in DSSCs, because it collects the electrons from the external circuit and allows the I3− reduction reaction. Platinum (Pt) deposited onto a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) glass was the most commonly used CE due to its excellent electrocatalytic ability, chemical stability and electrical conductivity.5,6 However, Pt is rather expensive, which limits its industrial applications. The search for low-cost substituted CEs for Pt is a major research in the development of practical DSSCs. Several electrocatalytic materials such as carbon-based materials,7,8 conducting polymers9–11 and transition metal sulfides12,13 have been extensively investigated. Recently, metal sulfides such as FeSx,14,15 CoS,16–18 NiS,19,20 MoS221,22 and WS23,24 have been researched for the possible catalysts to replace Pt.
Among these metal sulfides, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has received much attention in thin-film solar cells.25–27 However, only limited studies reported its use as the CE in DSSCs.28,29 The elements of quaternary compound, CZTS, are earth abundant, low cost and non-toxic. In addition, it is a direct band gap material30,31 with an absorption coefficient of 104 cm−1 in the visible light region;31 the value of the CZTS band gap is affected by the molar composition of CZTS, and lies in a range of 1.4–1.7 eV.30,31 The physical properties of CZTS depend on its composition and crystal structure.32–34 The thin film of CZTS, which was studied in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells as the counter electrode, exhibited 3.73% cell efficiency (η) compared to an η of 2.27% for Pt.28 Xin et al.29 first reported the CZTS CE using the solution-based synthesis approach, which achieved 3.62% cell efficiency. After selenization, the value of η was significantly increased to 7.37%, which was superior to an η of 7.04% using the Pt CE. There are few studies on the electrocatalytic properties of the CZTS CE in DSSCs.29,35–37
In order to optimize the cell performance of DSSCs, it is necessary to explore the influence of the molar ratio of [Cu]/[Zn] + [Sn] on the basic properties of CZTS. In this study, we prepared the CZTS CEs with various [Cu]/[Zn] + [Sn] molar ratios by using the sulfurization of direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering Cu–Zn–Sn metal alloys. In order to adjust the molar ratio of CZTS samples, the atomic ratio of Cu:Sn:Zn in the precursor was controlled by using various deposition times. The influence of the molar ratio of CZTS CEs on their structure and morphology was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), energy-dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The electrocatalytic ability and electrochemical properties of the CZTS CEs were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel plot measurements. The performance of DSSCs, with CZTS and Pt CEs, was verified by J–V curves and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves.
Experimental
Materials
Titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, >98%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.5%), ethanol (EtOH, 99.5%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4, ≥98.0%), Nafion® solution, 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII), 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetra-fluoroborate (EMIBF4) and 2-methoxyethanol (≥99.5%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetical grade), iodine (I2, synthetical grade) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, MW ∼ 20000) were obtained from Merck. Acetone (99+%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) were obtained from Acros. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) was obtained from Fluka. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) and cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719 dye) were obtained from Solaronix (S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). Acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%) and nitric acid (HNO3, 65% solution in water) were obtained from J. T. Baker.
Preparation of counter electrodes
Indium-doped tin oxide (ITO, 10 Ω sq.−1, UR-ITO007-0.7 mm, Uni-onward Corp., Taiwan) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, TEC-7, 7 Ω sq.−1, NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA) were cleaned using a neutral cleaner and washed with deionised water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially. The Pt CE was prepared by DC sputtering on an ITO glass with a thickness of 50 nm. The Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) CE was prepared using direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering of Cu–Sn (Cu–Sn = 52/48 wt%, 99.99%, Summit-Tech) and Zn (99.99%, Summit-Tech) targets. The thicknesses of Cu–Sn and Zn were controlled by using a digital quartz controller (Filtech SQM-180). First of all, the cleaned ITO substrates were set in the vacuum chamber which was evacuated to a base pressure of 5 × 10−6 torr and high-purity (99.995%) argon gas was used to provide the plasma at a base pressure of 5 × 10−3 torr. In order to obtain the same film thickness (1.5 μm) for all samples, the deposition times for Cu–Sn and In were varied to obtain various [Cu]/[Zn] + [Sn] molar ratio in CZTS films. The Cu–Sn metal alloy film was deposited onto ITO using the 2-inch Cu–Sn alloy target with the DC sputtering power of 35 W cm−2. The deposition times of the Cu–Sn alloy were set to be 18.0, 17.6, 17.3, 16.5, and 15.5 min for samples (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), respectively. Sequentially, the Zn metal precursor was deposited on the surface of the Cu–Sn alloy layer using the 2-inch Zn metal target with the DC sputtering power of 20 W cm−2. The deposition times of the Zn metal were set to be 4.5, 4.7, 4.9, 5.3 and 5.8 min for samples (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), respectively. Therefore, the Cu–Sn alloy layer can be well-covered with the Zn metal to prevent the formation of SnS impurities during the sulfurization process.38 The two-step post-thermal sulfurization process for the Cu–Sn–Zn metal precursor was carried out in a container with 0.5 g sulfur powder. An outer evacuated quartz tube was used for a two-stage annealing process under a vacuum condition of around 5 × 10−3 torr. In the first sulfurization stage, the metal precursors and sulfur powders were annealed at 440 °C for 30 min. Then the formation of Cu2ZnSnS4 on the substrate was carried out at the second sulfurization stage by holding at 560 °C for 30 min.39,40
Preparation of photoanodes and DSSCs
0.5 M TTIP in 0.1 M nitric acid aqueous solution was constantly stirred and heated up to 88 °C simultaneously for 8 h, and sequentially heated to 240 °C for 12 h in an autoclave (PARR 4540, U.S.A.). The TiO2 paste for the transparent layer (TL) was concentrated to 8 wt% by adding 2 wt% of PEG. The other TiO2 paste for the scattering layer (SL) was provided by adding 8 wt% commercial light scattering TiO2 particles (ST-41, 200 nm, Ishihara Sangyo, Ltd., Japan) into TL paste. The FTO conducting surface was first treated by spin coating a 100 nm compact layer using a solution of TTIP in 2-methoxyethanol (weight ratio of 1:3). A 20 μm porous TiO2 film containing 15 μm TL and 5 μm SL was coated on the treated FTO glass by the doctor blade technique, and the TiO2 film was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in an air atmosphere. After the annealing process, the TiO2 photoanode was reduced to 0.16 cm2 as the active area and immersed in 5 × 10−4 M to adsorb the N719 dye at room temperature for 24 h. The TiO2 photoanode was coupled with the CE and the distance between these two electrodes was fixed and sealed by heating 60 μm thick Surlyn® (SX1170–60, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). The electrolyte, which consisted of 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio = 1:1), was injected into the gap between these two electrodes by capillarity.
Characterization of counter electrodes and DSSCs
The compositions of the samples were analyzed by EDAX and the surface morphologies of CZTS CEs were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM 6700F). The phase formation and the crystallographic study of samples on glass substrates were investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (Siemens D5005) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5405 Å) and a Raman spectrometer (Protrustech, UniRaman, YAG laser 523 nm). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 10–80°. The roughness of the composite CZTS CE was observed by using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Park Systems XE70). The catalytic abilities of the CEs for the I−/I3− redox couple and the electrochemical properties can be estimated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel plots, and EIS. The CV curve was measured with a three-electrode electrochemical system in an ACN solution, containing 10.0 mM I−, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4. Pt or the composite CZTS film was used as the working electrode, and the Pt foil and the Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. Tafel plots and EIS spectra of symmetric cells of different CEs were measured by using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, the Netherlands) equipped with an FRA2 module. Cell conversion efficiencies (η) of DSSCs with different CEs were measured by using the potentiostat/galvanostat under 100 mW cm−2 light illumination with a solar simulator (XES–301S, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). IPCE curves of DSSCs were obtained by using a potentiostat/galvanostat and a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA). The incident radiation flux (φ) was obtained using an optical detector (model 71580, Oriel Instrument, California, USA) and a power meter (model 70310, Oriel Instrument, California, USA).
Results and discussion
Composition and crystalline characteristics of various CZTS composite films
The atomic percentages of Cu, Zn, Sn, and S in various CZTS CEs were obtained from the EDAX analysis, which is summarized in Table 1. The Zn-based41 and Sn-based42,43 thin films as the CE materials have been proposed for use in DSSCs and their catalytic ability has been confirmed. There are some studies about doping Cu-based materials to increase the electric conductivity44,45 and the cell performance. In a CZTS thin film, Cu acts as the key element in the composite due to its high conductivity.

By reducing the deposition time of the Cu–Sn alloy, the Cu content in CZTS CEs was decreased from 30.41 to 22.30%, namely from samples (A) to (E). The over-doped Cu content would lead to the formation of the Cu2−xS impurity phase,46 which can increase the charge-transfer resistance of the CE. Therefore, the [Cu]/[Zn] + [Sn] molar ratio can largely affect the physical properties such as conductivity, surface morphology, and cell efficiency. From the EDAX analysis, sample (C) nearly corresponded to the stoichiometric element of Cu2ZnSnS4.
The ideal stoichiometric molar ratio of Cu2ZnSnS4 is [Cu]:[Zn]:[Sn]:[S] = 2:1:1:4, therefore the atomic ratio of sulfur has to approach 50% to avoid the unfavorable sulfur deficiency.47,48 In Table 1, all samples with the [S]/metal molar ratios are in the range of 0.95–1.02, which reach nearly 50%. Therefore, there are no apparent sulfur defects in all samples. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Theta Probe, UK) spectra of the CZTS CEs are collected to confirm the EDAX results. As summarized in Table S1,† similar results can be concluded from both EDAX and XPS analyses.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of samples after the sulfurization process of metal alloys. The peaks at 2θ angles of 18.2°, 28.5°, 33.0°, 47.3°, 56.9°, 69.2°, and 76.4° correspond to the crystal planes of (101), (112), (200), (204/220), (312/116), (400/008), and (332), respectively, for the kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 phase without clear impurities such as CuxS.49 According to the literature, the diffraction peaks of the cubic-ZnS and the cubic-Cu2SnS3 are almost the same as the kesterite phase Cu2ZnSnS4.50,51 In order to confirm the crystal phases of CZTS CEs, a Raman spectrometer was used to characterize the crystalline phases. The Raman studies showed three bands at 283 cm−1, 329 cm−1 and 368 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 2. In fact, the most prominent peaks for a Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film were found at 288–289 cm−1, 338–339 cm−1 and 370–372 cm−1 in the literature.50 Therefore, all CZTS CEs show a dominant Cu2ZnSnS4 crystal phase with a minor impurity phase of Cu2SnS3, and thereby they can be considered as the composite materials.

Morphology and microstructures of the various CZTS composite films
FE-SEM and AFM images were used to observe the microstructures of the samples on the ITO substrates. Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the CZTS CEs; the inset of each image gives the pertinent high-resolution SEM image of each CZTS CE. Except for sample (A), the grain size becomes larger with the increasing molar ratio of [Cu]/[Zn] + [Sn] in the samples, indicating that Cu would enhance the grain growth.25 In the case of sample (A), the over-doped Cu content would lead to the coexistence of the secondary phase and ternary phase with a high concentration of defect clusters, as compared to the other samples. The coexisting phases would prevent the grain from further growing, thus leading to nonuniform grain size. Therefore, the film composed of aggregated particles in sample (A) becomes smoother. As the [Zn] content is increased, the crystal structure of the film would change from particle to plate.52 Thus, the structural properties were predominantly influenced by both the [Cu] and [Zn] contents. Since sample (C) has less defects compared to other samples, this would give rise to a more uniform grain with a dense surface, as shown by a plane view FE-SEM image in Fig. S3.†

Fig. 4 shows AFM images of samples on the ITO substrates. From the AFM images, the root mean square roughness (Rrms) was found to be 188.0 ± 0.4, 246.4 ± 0.2, 275.9 ± 0.3, 180.3 ± 0.2 and 153.2 ± 0.5 nm for samples (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), respectively. When the [Zn] or [Cu] content was increased too much, the surface morphology showed many plate-like particles or aggregates of particles covering the surface, respectively, thus giving a small surface roughness. Among all the CZTS films, sample (C) shows the largest Rrms value, which implies its largest electrocatalytic surface area for I3− reduction.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with various CEs
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs with various molar ratios of CZTS CEs are shown in Fig. 5a and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) of all samples is similar, indicating that the value of VOC is not affected by the molar ratio. The optimized composite CZTS achieved 7.94% cell performance with higher VOC, fill factor (FF), and short-circuit current density (Jsc) being 740.5 mV, 0.62 and 17.2 mA cm−2, respectively. Although the standard DSSC with Pt as the CE had the cell efficiency of 8.55% under the same measurement conditions, the low-cost CZTS exhibited only a slightly lower cell efficiency, thus possessed some potential to replace the Pt CE. Variable elementary defects in CZTS CEs, such as Cu or Zn defects, can trap the electrons and lower the conductivity of the thin film, so that the FF of their DSSCs is poor. Moreover, Jsc can be increased by the larger surface area of sample (C), which can be verified by the larger surface roughness of 275.9 nm obtained from the AFM measurement.

EDAX and XRD indicate that sample (C) corresponded to the Cu2ZnSnS4 phase and no additional elementary defects to trap the electrons, so these results show that sample (C) is a better electro-catalyst compared to other samples. The large roughness of CZTS CEs is beneficial for its enhancement of electrochemical activity. The surface morphology of the Cu-rich or Zn-rich sample is more uniform than others, so the behavior of Jsc decreased from 17.2 mA cm−2 to 12.2 mA cm−2. The lower values of Jsc of the DSSC with the composite films are consistent with the lower electrocatalytic activity of the films.
On the other hand, the DSSC with sample (C) as the counter electrode was subjected to an at-rest long-term stability test, as shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†). A suitable binary ionic liquid electrolyte, containing 0.2 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in a solvent mixture of BMII and EMIBF4 (volume ratio = 65:35), was used for the test. After one month, the normalized cell efficiency with sample (C) as the CE maintains up to 90% of its initial value, which supports the good long-term stability of the CZTS CE and its promising electrocatalytic ability as the CE for DSSCs.
IPCE of DSSCs

Fig. 5b shows the IPCE spectra of the DSSC coupling with different CEs. The IPCE curves corresponding to sample (C) and Pt CEs are comparable. A higher IPCE value yields a higher Jsc value of the DSSC, which implies a larger surface area of the CE. All the IPCE values are in agreement with the Jsc values.
Cyclic voltammetry analysis of various CEs
The CV measurement can be used for investigating the reaction kinetics and electrocatalytic abilities of the CZTS CEs at various molar ratios. Fig. 6 displays the CV curves of the I−/I3− redox couple by using a three-electrode electrochemical system. The major reduction at the counter electrode can be represented as: I3− + 2e− → 3I−(1)
 Fig. 6  CV of various CZTS CEs, with an electrolyte of 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN. 
The sample (C) composite shows higher redox current densities than the other composites, which implies that the sample (C) thin film possessed better electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox reaction.
The anodic peak current density (Jpa), the cathodic peak current density (Jpc) and the peak separation (ΔEp) are listed in Table 3. We observed that the cathodic peak current density of sample (C) is nearly the same as that of the Pt CE. The cathodic and anodic peak current densities (Jpc and Jpa) are determined by the difference between the maximum peak current density and the baseline of charging current density.53 The higher value of Jpc shows the better electrocatalytic ability of a CE for I3− reduction.

We also observed that the value of Jpc for sample (C) is larger than other CZTS CEs, indicating that it exhibits the highest electrocatalytic ability among all the CZTS CEs. The lower ΔEp represents the higher kinetic ability for I3− reduction. And the sample (C) composite CE possessed comparable Jpc and ΔEp values to those of the Pt CE. From the CV results, we conclude that similar Jpc and ΔEp values would directly lead to higher Jsc values of the DSSCs.
To further confirm the long-term stability of sample (C) as the CE in the I−/I3− electrolyte, we executed a long-term CV analysis under continuous 100 cycles scanning, which is shown in the ESI (Fig. S2†). In Fig. S2a,† the anodic and cathodic peak current densities (Jpa and Jpc) of sample (C) show constant amplitudes after 100 cycles, which implies its good long-term stability. Fig. S2b† plots the values of Jpa and Jpc as a function of cycle number. These values remain almost the same up to 100 cycles, suggesting that the CZTS composite thin film is stable and not corroded in the I−/I3− electrolyte.
Tafel and EIS analyses of optimized CZTS and Pt CEs
In order to further confirm the electrocatalytic abilities of CZTS CEs, we use the Tafel polarization curve measurement and EIS analysis. The interfacial charge-transfer properties of the symmetric cell could be studied by the Tafel polarization curve measurement. Tafel polarization curves of the symmetric cell based on all samples are shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Tafel polarization curves of various CEs. 
The exchange current density (J0) can be calculated from the intercept of the linear fitting line of anodic and cathodic data. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the various CEs can be calculated by eqn (2): (2)where T is the absolute temperature, R is the gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, n is the total number of electrons involved in the reaction, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance. In Table 4, sample (C) and Pt CE show similar Rct values, suggesting that sample (C) possesses superior electrocatalytic ability. The Rct value can be affected by two key parameters: one is the surface area and the other is the electrocatalytic ability, which are determined by the roughness (Rrms) and cathodic peak current density (Jpc), respectively. The Rrms value shows the tendency of (C) > (B) > (A) > (D) > (E), however the Jpc value shows the tendency of (C) > (E) > (D) > (B) > (A). Some disagreement appears in the cases of films of (D) and (E); this may be attributed to the overdose Cu-defects, which can trap the electrons, thus enhancing the resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the Rct value shows the tendency of (C) > (D) > (B) > (A) > (E).

The EIS spectra of symmetric cells based on CZTS CEs and Pt are shown in Fig. 8. The radius of the left semicircle can be attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CE/electrolyte interface. On the other hand, the right semicircle corresponds to the resistance for the diffusion process in the electrolyte. The CZTS CE fabricated using sputtering can serve better adhesion to the substrate and enhance the charge transfer ability. The lower Rct value influenced the electron transfer from the CE to I3−, thus leading to higher Jsc and FF,54 which are consistent with the Rct values obtained from Tafel polarization results. In Fig. 8, the Rct values of sample (C) and Pt CEs are 2.93 and 1.75 Ω cm2, respectively. From which, sample (C) shows a comparable electrocatalytic ability to Pt. Moreover, the values of the nonideal frequency dependent capacitance at the CE/electrolyte interface, represented by the constant phase element (CPE), are calculated for all samples by using the Z-view software.55,56 A higher CPE value represents a larger surface area of the CE.56 In Table 4, CPE values show the tendency of (C) > (A) > (D) > (E) > (B), which agrees well with the results obtained from the FE-SEM and AFM analyses. In brief, sample (C) shows the comparable electrocatalytic ability and active surface area to those of Pt, which demonstrates that sample (C) is a promising candidate to replace Pt as a CE in DSSCs.

Conclusions
A highly efficient counter electrode based on low-cost quaternary CZTS was fabricated successfully. The influence of the molar ratio of CZTS CEs on the structural and morphological properties was investigated. All the CZTS CEs revealed the kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 phase. The Cu and Zn elements predominantly influenced the grain size and morphology. The adjustment of the molar ratio of CZTS is very important to obtain the desired properties, leading to the optimization of the cell performance of DSSCs. The near-stoichiometric composition of CZTS CEs showed better electrocatalytic ability than the other composites. This resulted in high electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox reaction, which is similar to that of the Pt CE. The DSSC coupled with the optimized CZTS CE achieved a cell efficiency of 7.94% with a VOC of 740.5 mV, a Jsc of 17.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.62, which is comparable to those of a DSSC with a Pt CE (8.55%). Consequently, several advantages, such as low-cost material, possible large scale production,57–59 and a high solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of 7.94%, can be achieved by applying the CZTS CE in DSSCs. In this study, we have demonstrated that CZTS is a potential substitute to replace the Pt CE.
