    , Accepted 19th November 2020First published on 20th November 2020AbstractThe stacking of 2D perovskites on the top of 3D perovskites has been recognized as a promising interfacial treatment approach to improve the stability and efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, traditional 2D–3D perovskite heterojunctions obtained from the high-temperature annealing process still exhibit unsatisfactory charge transfer performance and interfacial voltage loss. Herein, we introduce isopentylammonium iodide (PNAI) as the large organic ammonium salt, and adjust the in situ grown processes of 2D perovskites by thermal treatments to form a multi-component capping layer composed of 2D perovskites with plenty of high n-value 2D phases (n ≥ 3, n is the number of inorganic layers) and residual PNAI molecules on 3D perovskites. Such an optimized composition for a 2D–3D perovskite heterojunction can remarkably improve the charge transfer performance, further suppress the interfacial ionic defects, and enlarge Fermi-level splitting, leading to a low bandgap-to-voltage loss (0.38 V). Consequently, this treatment strategy significantly improves the efficiency of planar PSCs to 22.62% with an outstanding open-circuit voltage of 1.16 V. Moreover, the unencapsulated PNAI-90 treated device stored under a relative humidity of 30 ± 5% for 1000 h still retains 89% of its initial PCE. This work offers a new strategy to construct a robust 2D–3D heterojunction for planar PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been one of the most impressive photovoltaic materials due to their high carrier mobility, high absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime, and adjustable bandgap.1–5 Since first reported by Miyasaka in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed PSCs has rapidly developed from 3.8% (ref. 6) to 25.2% (ref. 7) by optimizing perovskite composition,8 device architectures,9,10 perovskite interface,11–14etc. In these studies, planar PSCs obtained at low temperatures have attracted considerable attention, benefiting from their low-cost and the application potential in flexible electronic devices.15–17 However, the perovskite film of planar PSCs prepared by the two-step-solution method is rough and presents many distinctive grain boundaries. Those grain boundaries contain plenty of defects, such as the dangling bonds generated by surface discontinuous crystal structures and under-coordinated Pb2+, resulting in the non-radiative recombination of carriers and poor contact with the hole transport layer.18,19 The labile perovskite surface not only decreases the device PCE but also deteriorates the device stability.20,21 Therefore, the interfacial treatment of the perovskite film is indispensable to obtain high efficiency and stable planar PSCs.
Fortunately, various materials have been successfully employed in the interfacial engineering of perovskites, such as PbI2,22 inorganic oxide materials,23 polymer materials24 and large organic ammonium salts11. Among them, large organic ammonium salts (the molecular volumes of which are larger than HC(NH2)2+ and CH3NH3+) have attracted tremendous attention due to their outstanding passivation performance.25–27 Concretely, organic ammonium salts such as phenethylammonium iodide28–30 and octylammonium iodide31,32 can passivate the perovskite surface through two different ways. In the first one, organic ammonium salts can be directly used as passivators. The Lewis base functional groups (–NH2) of these small molecules can suppress the defects and eliminate the charge traps through coordinating with Pb2+via lone pair electrons.20,21,33 In the other one, organic ammonium salts can react with the excess lead iodide on the 3D perovskite surface at high temperatures to transform into 2D perovskites. Benefiting from the inherent high stability of the 2D perovskite, the device stability will be significantly improved.34
Furthermore, the wide-bandgap 2D perovskites and the underlying 3D perovskites can form a 2D–3D perovskite heterojunction, which not only improves the perovskite film stability but also adjusts the energy band alignment for high-performance PSCs.35,36 Generally, 2D perovskites are formulated as (R2An−1MnX3n+1, n ≥ 1), where R is an additional large organic ammonium cation and n represents the number of [MX6]4−inorganic layers.31 However, as the large organic cations are electrically insulating, charge transfer in 2D perovskites is limited by long-chain organic ligands, which hinders the charge transfer from the 2D–3D heterojunction to the hole transport layer.37 To solve this issue, an effective carrier transport pathway can be created by increasing the amount of high n-value (n ≥ 3) 2D phases and decreasing the amount of undesirable n = 1 and n = 2 2D phases, because high n-value 2D phases tend to form the out-of-plane stacking of inorganic layers.37,38 So, introducing more amount of high n-value 2D phases to the 2D capping layer is crucial to improve the charge transfer efficiency of 2D–3D heterojunctions to achieve high-performance PSCs. Besides, solution-processed perovskites (2D/3D) are usually polycrystalline ionic crystals with non-negligible ion defects, such as I− vacancies and interstitial Pb2+, which induce charge traps in 2D–3D heterojunctions and result in the deterioration of device performance.37,39,40 However, additional large organic ammonium cations can be applied to passivate these ion defects through coordinating with Pb2+via lone pair electrons as reported.20,28 Therefore, to fabricate high-performance planar PSCs, further improvement of the interfacial layer to obtain an optimized interfacial 2D–3D perovskite heterojunction is crucial.
Recently, Chen and co-workers covered phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite film to in situ grow 2D phases by thermal treatment, but the 2D phase was mainly composed of PEA2PbI4 (low n-value 2D phase with n = 1), with an unsatisfactory charge transporting performance and charge loss, resulting in an efficiency of only 18.51%.30 Sun and co-workers introduced a molecular additive, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane, into the 2D phase (BA)2FAPb2I7 (BA, butylammonium iodide) to modify the 2D–3D heterojunction.41 The device efficiency was improved from 18% to 20% due to the enhanced charge transfer and the reduced defect states in the heterojunction. However, the foreign additive may still affect the 2D phase structure and device stability. So, in order to improve the charge transport performance of the 2D capping layer and further reduce defect states in the heterojunction, we focus on the compositional optimization of the 2D–3D heterojunction interface. To the best of our knowledge, a systematic study on the compositional engineering of 2D–3D heterojunction interfaces has not been reported.
In this study, isopentylammonium iodide (PNAI) was introduced as the interfacial halide salt to form a 2D perovskite capping layer on the top of 3D perovskite. Owing to PNAI's flexible alkyl chain and benzene-free structure, an optimized 2D–3D heterojunction with plenty of high n-value 2D phases and a small amount of residual PNAI molecules was created by a simple interfacial thermal treatment process. While the formation of high n-value 2D phases can improve the charge transport, Fermi-level splitting under light illumination and device stability, the presence of residual PNAI molecules in the 2D capping layer is beneficial to reduce the nonradiative recombination of the 2D–3D heterojunction by suppressing the interfacial defects and the defects inside the 2D capping layer. This treatment strategy can significantly improve the PCE of planar PSCs from 20.26% to 22.62%, with an impressive Voc of 1.16 V and a high fill factor of 81.87%. Moreover, after storing in ambient air at 30 ± 5% RH for 1000 hours, the unencapsulated device can still retain 89% of its initial PCE. This work demonstrates an optimized formation and composition for 2D–3D perovskite heterojunctions to construct highly efficient planar PSCs.
Results and discussion
Fabrication and characterization of the perovskite film
The 3D perovskite film was deposited through a two-step spin-coating method. Moreover, KI8 was introduced into the triple-cation (CsPbI3)x(FAPbI3)y(MAPbBr3)1−x−y (FA: HC(NH2)2, MA: CH3NH3) perovskite precursor to increase the perovskite crystallinity. Hence, a multi-component 3D perovskite film was obtained with a thickness of 605 nm, and large perovskite grains without horizontal grain boundaries can be found in the cross-sectional SEM images, as presented in Fig. S1.† After the fabrication of the 3D perovskite film, isopentylammonium iodide (PNAI) was introduced as the large organic ammonium salt to fabricate 2D perovskites. Compared with phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI), PNAI without the rigid benzene structure possesses a flexible alkyl chain that is prone to dispersion into the lattice of the perovskite, facilitating the formation of a high n-value 2D perovskite phase (n ≥ 2) on the 3D perovskite surface,11,28,30,31 which is beneficial to the charge transfer at the interface.37,38 Particularly, the branched chain structure also endows the perovskite with excellent moisture resistivity, enhancing the humidity stability of devices significantly.42 The transformation process of PNAI to a 2D perovskite on the 3D perovskite surface can be easily adjusted by annealing processes. The procedure is presented in Fig. 1a.

To investigate the interfacial compositions under different treatment processes, we obatined X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films, shown in Fig. 1b. The pristine 3D perovskite film (control) shows a pronounced peak at 12.7° in the XRD patterns, indicating the presence of excess PbI2, which can react with PNAI and transform it into a 2D perovskite. After spin-coating the PNAI solution and applying room-temperature treatment (PNAI, 20 °C, hereafter denoted as PNAI-20), both signals of excess PbI2 (12.7°) and PNAI molecules (5.7°) were shown in PNAI, 20 °C curves. When the annealing temperature was increased to 50 °C, 70 °C, and 90 °C, both signals of PbI2 (12.7°) and PNAI molecules (5.7°) decreased correspondingly, indicating the consumption of PbI2 and PNAI molecules for the possible formation of 2D perovskites. At 90 °C (PNAI, 90 °C, hereafter denoted as PNAI-90), the signal of PNAI (5.7°) was very weak representing a residual trace of PNAI. At 120 °C (PNAI, 120 °C, hereafter denoted as PNAI-120), the signal of PNAI (5.7°) completely disappeared as shown in PNAI, 120 °C curves.
To confirm the presence of 2D perovskite phases in PNAI-90 treated films, the XRD patterns of different n-value 2D perovskite films alone on glass substrates were obtained as shown in Fig. 1c. PNAI molecules as one of the organic ammonium salts similar to BAI may form 2D perovskites with different n-values (R2An−1MnX3n+1, n = 1, 2, 3).39 Here, the XRD patterns of (PNA)2FAPb2I7 and (PNA)2(FA)2Pb3I10 are shown in Fig. 1c, which represents the 2D perovskite phases of n = 2, and n = 3, respectively. In both patterns, signals of 2D perovskites (4.3°) are present. Going back to Fig. 1b, the signals of 2D perovskites (4.3°) are present in all PNAI treated samples, confirming the transformation of PNAI molecules and PbI2 into 2D perovskites. Based on the result of Fig. 1b and c, for PNAI-20, the 2D capping layer is predominantly composed of PNAI molecules. For PNAI-90, the 2D capping layer is composed of 2D perovskites and a trace of residual PNAI. For PNAI-120, the PNAI signal is gone so the capping layer is only composed of 2D perovskites. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were also measured to investigate the surface component. The typical C 1s and N 1s spectra of the control and PNAI-90 treated perovskites are presented in Fig. 1d and e, respectively. There is a strong CNH2+ peak in both perovskite films corresponding to FA+ in 3D perovskites. However, increased intensity of the C–NH2 peak (286.4 eV in Fig. 1d and 400.6 eV in Fig. 1e) is observed in the PNAI-90 treated perovskite film due to the interfacial PNA+, further confirming the presence of the 2D–3D perovskite heterojunction.43
To further investigate the surface composition and crystallinity of the 2D–3D heterojunction, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed using synchrotron radiation. The GIWAXS pattern of control perovskites in Fig. 2a reveals several strong diffraction rings at q = 10, 20, and 23 nm−1, corresponding to the (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of 3D perovskites and indicating the high crystallinity of the perovskite film. However, in the GIWAXS pattern of the PNAI-20 treated film, the signal strength of 3D perovskites decreased due to the covering of amorphous PNAI molecules, as presented in Fig. 2b. GIWAXS signals of PNAI-90 treated and PNAI-120 treated films are given in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. An apparent diffraction spot appears at q = 2.5 nm−1 along the qz direction in all three PNAI treated films, attributed to the formation of 2D phases.11,31 Nevertheless, the presence of a 2D signal at q = 2.5 nm−1 in PNAI-20 treated film in Fig. 2b is probably due to the high surface sensitivity of GIWAXS and also the spontaneous conversion of PNAI to the 2D perovskite at room temperature,28,44,45 since the samples waited in line for several days before GIWAXS measurement was taken. Furthermore, for the diffraction ring at q = 5 nm−1 in GIWAXS patterns, the PNAI-90 treated film displays a stronger signal compared with the PNAI-120 treated film, arising from the higher amount of high n-value 2D phases.46,47 Moreover, for the diffraction ring at q = 9 nm−1 in GIWAXS patterns, which is assigned to the (001) crystal planes of PbI2, the signal strength of PbI2 in the PNAI-90 treated film is weaker than that of the PNAI-120 treated film. It means that PNAI-90 treatment consumes more PbI2 and is more likely to form high n-value 2D phases. The reason is that with the increase of the n-value in 2D perovskites ((PNA)2(FA)n−1PbnI3n+1), for the same amount of PNAI more PbI2 is required. Such high n-value 2D phases can create an effective carrier transport pathway in 2D–3D heterojunctions, leading to high photovoltaic performance.48

To obtain morphological information on the 2D–3D heterojunction surface, top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the perovskite films were obtained before and after PNAI treatment. The control 3D perovskite film displays much distinct grain boundaries with a high root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 41.2 nm, as presented in Fig. 3a. After PNAI-20 treatments, the 3D perovskite grains in Fig. 3b become more indistinct and the film roughness decreases to 34.4 nm due to the deposition of PNAI on the surface. In particular, the in situ grown 2D capping layer on the 3D perovskite film is like a thin blanket in PNAI-90 treated (Fig. 3c) and PNAI-120 treated (Fig. 3d) films, resulting in a low film roughness of 28.2 nm and 28.7 nm, respectively. To further investigate the distribution of 2D phases on the 3D perovskite surface, the fluorescence spectra of PNAI-90 treated film were obtained using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Fig. 3e is the bright-field CLSM image of the underlying 3D perovskite film, and the film is represented in red. Fig. 3f is the bright-field CLSM image of the upper 2D phases (represented in green), and the combined image of Fig. 3e and f is presented in Fig. 3g. Apparently, 2D phases are widely distributed on the 3D perovskite surface, facilitating the construction of a robust 2D–3D heterojunction. The corresponding three-dimensional CLSM image of the PNAI-90 treated film is presented in Fig. S2.† The 3D perovskite film was uniformly covered by a 2D capping layer, which leads to an improved perovskite morphology, consistent with the SEM results.

Device fabrication and characterization
After investigating the composition and surface morphology of the optimized 2D–3D heterojunction, we fabricated solar cells to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the devices based on PNAI-90 treatment. The architecture of the devices is FTO/SnO2/perovskite/with or without interfacial treatment/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, as shown in Fig. 4a. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs treated using different interfacial strategies are presented in Fig. 4b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. Compared with the best PCE of 20.26% for the control device, the PCE of devices treated with PNAI-20, PNAI-90, and PNAI-120 increases to 22.00%, 22.62%, and 21.46%, respectively. In particular, the Voc of PNAI-90 treated devices is improved significantly from 1.08 V (control) to 1.16 V, leading to a low voltage loss (Eabs/q − Voc) of 0.38 V, equal to that of crystal silicon solar cells.49 Besides, the FF of the PNAI-90 treated device is increased from 78.99% to 81.87% due to the improved surface contact. Furthermore, the Jsc of the PNAI-90 treated device is also slightly higher than that of the control, PNAI-20 treated, and PNAI-120 treated devices. In order to investigate the versatility of the optimized composition strategy, we also fabricated devices based on butylammonium iodide (BAI) and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) through the same procedure, and the best PCE results are also obtained after 90 °C thermal treatment. The results are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1.†

We further investigate the effects of PNAI concentrations on the performance of PNAI-90 treated devices, as shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2.† Apparently, the device achieves the best PCE of 22.62% at 20 mM. As the concentration increases, the device PCE decreases gradually. When the concentration reaches 80 mM, the 2D layer is too thick to allow fast charge transmission, resulting in an apparent deterioration in the device photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, Fig. 4c shows the J–V curves of PNAI-90 treated and control devices under different scan directions, the detailed information is presented in Table S3.† Generally, the hysteresis degree can be determined by the hysteresis index (H = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse), and devices based on PNAI-90 achieve a lower hysteresis (2.4%) than control devices (6.3%). The decreased hysteresis can be ascribed to the suppressed ion migration and ion accumulation at the interfaces by the optimized 2D capping layer.50 Besides, the PCE histograms based on PNAI-90 treated and control devices are summarized in Fig. 4d, and the PNAI-90 treated devices show better device reproducibility.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and integrated current density Jsc of the PNAI-90 treated devices are presented in Fig. 4e. The integrated Jsc is 23.33 mA cm−2, which is in agreement with the Jsc obtained from J–V curves (23.82 mA cm−2). In addition, Fig. 4f shows the stabilized PCE of the PNAI-90 treated and control devices measured at their fixed maximum power point (MPP) voltage, respectively. After exposure under continuous one-sun illumination in ambient air (30 ± 5% RH) for 120 s, the PNAI-90 treated device can still maintain a steady-state Jsc of 21.56 mA cm−2, corresponding to the stabilized PCE of 21.56%, which was much higher than that of the control device (19.29%). In sum, the devices based on PNAI-90 treatment show a conspicuous improvement in photovoltaic performance.
In order to clarify the inherent mechanism of the high photovoltaic performance in PNAI-90 treated devices, we first obtained the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra to investigate carrier nonradiative recombination properties of different perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 5a. The control perovskites exhibit a typical emission peak at 790 nm. After PNAI-20 and PNAI-90 treatment, the strength of this peak increases obviously. In particular, the perovskite film based on PNAI-90 treatment achieves the highest emission intensity at 790 nm, which means the carrier nonradiative recombination is effectively reduced and the defects are well eliminated. The decreased emission intensity in PNAI-120 treated perovskite at 790 nm may be caused by the high-temperature treatment (120 °C), which brings about unexpected defects in the 2D–3D heterojunction.37 On the other hand, compared with PNAI-90 treated perovskites, PNAI-120 treated perovskites achieve the highest emission intensity at 570 nm because of the complete formation of 2D phases from PNAI, consistent with the XRD results shown in Fig. 1b. In particular, there are two more obvious emission peaks at 630 nm and 668 nm for the PNAI-90 treated perovskite film, which confirms that the 2D perovskite capping layer is constructed from multi-component 2D phases with n = 2, n = 3, and n = 4.47 Moreover, compared with the PNAI-120 treated perovskites, the 2D phases in PNAI-90 treated perovskites contain higher amounts of high n-value (n ≥ 3) 2D phases, corresponding to the GIWAXS results. Those high n-value 2D phases deliver a better charge transfer performance,37 constructing an effective charge pathway from the 2D–3D heterojunction to the hole transport layer (discussed in the following sections). Besides, the spectrum of PNAI-20 treated perovskites also has a PL peak at 570 nm, corresponding to the XRD results in Fig. 1c. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were carried out to evaluate the carriers' lifetime of perovskites under different interfacial treatments, as presented in Fig. 5b. The TRPL spectra can be well fitted using a triexponential fitting model,43 and the detailed fitting information is listed in Table S4.† The average carrier lifetime (τave) is often calculated to assess the charge recombination properties of the perovskite film.51 The τave of the control, PNAI-20, PNAI-90, and PNAI-120 treated perovskites are 509.64 ns, 634.42 ns, 1008.39 ns, and 402.99 ns, respectively. The highest τave in PNAI-90 treated perovskites indicates that the interfacial charge recombination and defect states have been effectively suppressed.30 The same results can be found in the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) (Fig. S5†), and the carrier recombination resistance of the PSCs based on PNAI-90 treatment has increased significantly due to the suppressed defects.31

All curves were measured from the interfacial layer side. 
The above results show that the device based on PNAI-90 has fewer defects than PNAI-120 treated devices. Besides the role of 2D phases themselves in interfacial passivation, the unignored function of residual PNAI salts in PNAI-90 treated perovskites was investigated through the first-principles calculation based on density functional theory (DFT). We calculated the change of perovskite surface energy before and after PNAI treatment, as presented in Fig. 5c. The results reveal that PNAI molecules can significantly decrease the surface energy of Pb–I and MA–I terminated perovskite surfaces by 0.45 eV and 0.24 eV through inducing interaction between –NH2 and Pb2+, I−. This can also be confirmed by XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. S6.† The bonding energy of the Pb 4f7/2 orbit decreases after PNAI-90 treatment, indicating the existence of interactions between the perovskite and PNAI. It means PNAI molecules may act as a passivator to help eliminate the dangling bonds, under-coordinated Pb2+ and ion vacancy sites in the inorganic layers of 2D and 3D perovskites in the PNAI-90 treated perovskite film, leading to a low charge loss, in agreement with the above PL results.28,37
To further confirm the change of defect-state density in perovskite films, we performed space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement, and the dark JV curves along with the calculative processes are shown in Fig. S7.† The calculated ntrap of devices based on control 3D perovskites, PNAI-20, PNAI-90, and PNAI-120 treatments are 3.26 × 1015 cm−3, 2.41 × 1015 cm−3, 1.98 × 1015 cm−3, and 2.83 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The lowest ntrap in PNAI-90 treated devices indicates that the treatment can effectively reduce the defects on the perovskite surface, contributing to the enhancement of the devices' Voc. More importantly, the device based on PNAI-90 also has the best electron mobility (μ) of 3.76 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, confirming the high carrier mobility between the perovskite film and charge transport layer due to the presence of high n-value 2D phases in the PNAI-90 film.
To further evaluate the charge transfer performance between the treated perovskite film and hole transport layer more clearly, we obtained the steady-state PL and TRPL spectra of perovskites/spiro-OMeTAD samples on a glass substrate. In Fig. 5d, compared with the control perovskites, the PL peak intensities at 790 nm of PNAI-20, PNAI-90 and PNAI-120 treated perovskites decrease and also show an apparent blue shift due to the surface wide-bandgap 2D phases (discussed below). In particular, the PL peak intensity in PNAI-90 treated films is lower than that of PNAI-120 treated films, suggesting that these high n-value 2D phases in the PNAI-90 treated perovskites facilitate the charge transfer from perovskites to spiro-OMeTAD. The corresponding TRPL spectra are shown in Fig. 5e. The carrier lifetimes were fitted using the biexponential model, as presented in Table S5.† PNAI-90 treated films display an average decay lifetime of 6.24 ns, which is lower than that of the control (9.29 ns), PNAI-20 (8.91 ns), and PNAI-120 (7.30 ns) treated films. The lowest carrier lifetime confirms the best charge extraction performance at the PNAI-90 treated perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface, consistent with the steady-state PL results.
The optimized 2D capping layer on PNAI-90 treated perovskites does not only eliminate the surface defects and reduces the interfacial charge loss but also changes the perovskite bandgap and energy level alignment, which is also a crucial factor in the change of device performance. So, UV-vis spectra were measured to evaluate the light absorption capacity and bandgap of perovskite films before and after interfacial treatments, as shown in Fig. 6a. The spectra show that the interfacial treatments don't significantly affect the light absorption of perovskite films. However, a slight blue shift of the absorption curves for PNAI-90 treated perovskites occurs, and the film bandgap increases from 1.53 eV to 1.54 eV, which may be caused by the surface 2D phases. To make this clear, we fabricated a 2D perovskite with n = 2 on a glass substrate and obtained its UV-vis spectra, presented in Fig. 6b. Apparently, 2D perovskites have a wide bandgap of 2.12 eV, which can increase the bandgap of the treated film and also affect the interfacial energy band alignment.

(b) Absorption spectra of the 2D perovskite film with n = 2. The inset shows 2D perovskites with a bandgap of 2.12 eV. (c) Energy level diagram of PSCs and schematic illustration of the Fermi level splitting under light illumination.

To further investigate the energy band alignment of PNAI-90 treated devices, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) spectra were measured. The UPS spectra are presented in Fig. S8.†Fig. 6c is the corresponding energy level diagram and the schematic illustration of Fermi level splitting under light illumination. Apparently, the optimized 2D–3D heterojunction constructed by PNAI-90 treatment is a type-I band alignment heterojunction, which prevents the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the 3D perovskite to spiro-OMeTAD for quenching. In contrast, the photogenerated hole in the perovskite film can transfer to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of spiro-OMeTAD by surmounting the energy barrier to 2D phases due to the carrier accumulation, then entering spiro-OMeTAD.11,52 Apart from that, the photogenerated hole may also directly transfer to the HTL by the tunneling effect in the thinner 2D phase area.16,53,54 In addition, there are still some 3D perovskites not covered by 2D perovskites due to the rough surface. In this case, the 3D perovskite can come into contact with the spiro-OMeTAD layer directly to create a hole transporting path. From UPS characterization, the Fermi level of the PNAI-90 treated film surface (−4.29 eV) was shifted down towards the valance band edge as compared with the 3D perovskite surface (−4.11 eV) and PNAI-120 treated film surface (−4.20 eV). Due to the down-shifted Fermi level, the hole carrier concentration has to be increased. Therefore, under light illumination, the hole quasi-Fermi level (Efp) for the PNAI-90 treated surface is deeper than that of the original 3D perovskite surface due to increased hole carrier concentration, followed by the increase of splitting between the electron quasi-Fermi level (Efn) and hole quasi-Fermi level (Efp).30,54 Enhanced quasi-Fermi splitting can further contribute to the enhancement of Voc.55,56
Moreover, to further confirm the change of Fermi levels, we performed Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements and obtained the contact potential difference (CPD) mappings between the tip and the sample surface, which are usually used to evaluate the sample work functions and Fermi levels,26 presented in Fig. 6d and e. The surface potential distribution charts are shown in Fig. S9.† Compared with the untreated 3D perovskites, the surface potential of the PNAI-90 treated film is obviously decreased, leading to larger work functions, consistent with the deeper Fermi level in UPS results.30 It's worth noting that the potential difference between 3D perovskite grains and grain boundaries is distinguishable, indicating the enrichment of defects at the grain boundaries.11,57 After PNAI-90 treatment, the film surface potential is more uniform and the defects are effectively eliminated, consistent with the above PL and SCLC results.
Apart from efficiency, stability is also a crucial aspect to evaluate device performance. Thus, water contact angles were measured to investigate the hydrophobicity of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 7a. The control 3D perovskites have a low water contact angle of 59.0°. After PNAI-20, PNAI-90, and PNAI-120 treatments, the water contact angles increase to 78.8°, 88.4° and 84.1°, respectively. The perovskite film based on PNAI-90 treatment shows the largest water contact angle due to the synergetic effect of moisture resistance of the 2D layer and residual PNAI molecules with a long alkyl chain on the perovskite surface, which can effectively prevent H2O from entering the internal perovskite, leading to enhanced moisture stability. In order to further investigate the perovskite film stability, we recorded the optical photos of unencapsulated perovskite films before and after high-humidity measurement, presented in Fig. 7b. Compared with the other perovskite films, PNAI-90 treated films display no visible change after storage in ambient air (70 ± 10% RH) for 150 days. In order to make this clear, we measured the XRD spectra of the perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 7c. The control 3D perovskite decomposed obviously in high relative humidity due to its unstable interface, which can be confirmed from the significant increase in the peak intensity of PbI2. From the increased peak intensity ratio of PbI2 (12.7°) to perovskite (14.1°), we also found that raw PNAI-20 treated perovskite film undergoes decomposition. However, the PbI2 peak intensity of the PNAI-90 and PNAI-120 treated films hardly changed, suggesting the better moisture stability of the 2D–3D heterojunction. Besides, UV-vis spectra were also applied to characterize the stability of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. S10.† Compared with perovskite films based on interfacial treatments, the decrease in the light-absorption of the control perovskite film is more obvious. Finally, unencapsulated PSCs were measured in ambient air at 30 ± 5% RH for 1000 h, presented in Fig. 7d. Benefiting from the outstanding moisture stability of perovskite films, the device based on PNAI-90 treatment can still retain 89% of its initial efficiency compared with retention values of 66%, 82%, and 87% for the control, PNAI-20 treated and PNAI-120 treated devices, respectively. Meanwhile, considering that photo-stability is also a key parameter for the commercial applications of solar cells, we further test the photo-stability of unencapsulated devices under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination in ambient air with 30% RH and proper air cooling. As shown in Fig. 7e, after 76 h of illumination, the PNAI-90 treated device still retains 62% of its initial efficiency, which is higher than that of the control (27%), PNAI-20 treated (45%), and PNAI-120 treated (57%) devices, indicating its enhanced photo-stability, which benefits from the suppression of ion defects and ion migration. In brief, the PNAI-90 treatment can form a good capping layer to construct an optimized 2D–3D heterojunction to improve device stability significantly.

Device fabrication
FTO glass substrates were cleaned ultrasonically in ethyl alcohol, detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol each for 15 min, sequentially. Prior to use, the FTO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 25 min. Then, the diluted SnO2 colloid precursor (2.67%, in water) was spin-coated onto FTO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the FTO/SnO2 substrates were treated with UV ozone again for 25 min to improve the wettability. Afterwards, the perovskite layer was prepared through a two-step method. In the first step, 600 mg PbI2, 30 mg CsI, 15 mg KI, and 6.4 mg MAI in 1 ml DMF/DMSO (9:1) solution was spin-coated on the SnO2 substrate at 1500 rpm for 30 s, then the samples were annealed at 70 °C for 1 min. In the second step, a solution of FAI (60 mg), MABr (6 mg) and MACl (6 mg) in IPA (1 ml) was spin-coated onto the PbI2 film at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 20 min under ambient air conditions (25–30% humidity). So far, perovskite film was synthesized. After that, the samples were moved into a N2-filled glovebox for PNAI treatment. PNAI (20 mM) solution was dissolved in IPA and spin-coated onto the perovskite surface at 5000 rpm for 30 s at different annealing temperatures from 20 °C to 120 °C. Then, spiro-OMeTAD (72.3 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) with the addition of Li–TFSI (54 μl, 170 mg ml−1 in acetonitrile) and tBP (30 μl) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm. for 30 s. Finally, Ag back electrodes (100 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation. The initial active area was 0.18 cm2. While measuring, the accurate active area was 0.1 cm2 defined by a non-reflective mask.
Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices (unencapsulated) were measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated using a standard Si solar cell) using an Abet Technologies Sun 2000 solar simulator and a Keithley 2400 source meter. The devices were measured by reverse scan (1.2 V → −0.1 V, step 20 mV) and forward scan (−0.1 V → 1.2 V, step 20 mV) in ambient air (30% RH). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were observed on the QTEST HIFINITY 5 EQE system (the light intensity was calibrated with Si detectors). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken on a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation as the X-ray source at a scan rate of 6° min−1. The grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) spectra were obtained at beamline BL16B1 in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) and the incidence angle of the X-ray beam was 0.3°. The normal incidence of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) 16B is about 400 microns, and the grazing incidence spot can reach the centimeter-level (grazing incidence angle of 0.3°, the spot along the optical path can be elongated to 400/sin°(0.3°) = 7.6 cm, with a spot area around 400 μm × 7.6 cm). Thus, the surface effect is magnified. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were acquired on a TESCA MIRA3 FE-SEM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were observed on a Bruker Bio-FastScan AFM. UV-vis absorption spectra were acquired on a Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrometer. Steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were taken on an FLS1000 photoluminescence spectrometer with the excitation at 470 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired on an AXIS Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and calibrated based on the C 1s peak (284.8 eV). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were measured using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi machine. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were observed on a Chenhua CHI660E electrochemical workstation under dark conditions. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images were measured on a Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X instrument under ambient air conditions. The water contact angle images were taken on a DSA100 contact angle analysis instrument.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have introduced PNAI as the large organic ammonium salt to fabricate an optimized composition of a 2D–3D heterojunction with a large content of high n-value 2D phases in 2D perovskites and a small amount of residual PNAI molecules through a simple thermal treatment procedure. In the optimized 2D–3D heterojunction, high n-value 2D phases can enhance the charge transfer performance of the 2D capping layer and a small amount of residual PNAI molecules can be regarded as defect passivators to reduce nonradiative recombination by further suppressing the interfacial ion defects in the layers of 2D and 3D perovskites. The optimized composition for the 2D–3D perovskite heterojunction can also induce an enlarged Fermi-level splitting followed by an improvement in the Voc of the solar cell. As a result, the optimized heterojunction increased the Voc from 1.08 V to 1.16 V, and the FF from 78.99% to 81.87%. Furthermore, the optimized 2D–3D heterojunction can significantly increase the moisture stability and photo stability of perovskite films and devices. In short, the optimized compositional strategy for the 2D–3D heterojunction provides a simple and effective method for obtaining highly efficient and stable planar perovskite solar cells.
