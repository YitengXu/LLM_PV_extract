    , Accepted 29th April 2020First published on 4th May 2020AbstractThe intrinsic electronic structure and crystalline quality of quantum dot (QD) light-harvesting materials are among the primary reasons for determining the photovoltaic performance of the resulting QD sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Undoubtedly, exploiting appropriate high-quality QDs is a crucial route to improving the performance of QDSCs. In order to reduce the density of trap state defects, a ZnSe shell layer with a wider bandgap is overgrown around the light-harvesting star material Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) alloy QDs to form the type-I core/shell structured ZCIS/ZnSe. Through this QD materials engineering, the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QDSCs was improved from 9.54% corresponding to pristine CuInSe2, to 12.49% for alloyed ZCISe, and to 13.71% for core/shell structured ZCISe/ZnSe QDs. A certified PCE of 13.49% has been obtained for the ZCIS/ZnSe QDSCs under AM 1.5G one sun irradiation. This value is a new record efficiency for QDSCs. The remarkable enhancement of the photovoltaic performance for ZCIS/ZnSe-based QDSCs vs. ZCISe ones is mainly ascribed to the reduced density of trap state defects, which favours the suppression of charge recombination at photoanode/electrolyte interfaces and hence improves the photovoltage and fill factor, particularly. The steady state optical spectroscopy, diode ideality factor, transient absorption, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization experiments confirm that the formed type-I core/shell structure can reduce the density of trap state defects and suppress charge recombination and improve the photovoltaic performance of the resulting cells. This work demonstrates the great potential of QD materials engineering in improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs.
1. Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are appealing building blocks for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices owing to their distinguished features such as high stability toward light, heat, and moisture, high light absorption capability, a tunable light-harvesting range, solution processability, and multiple exciton generation possibilities.1–3 In particular, exploiting QDs as light-harvesting materials has paved a promising road towards low-cost, high performance photovoltaic cells.4–6 Integrated with the simple and convenient device configuration, the low-cost fabrication process, and the outstanding optoelectronic features of QD light-harvesting materials, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) are considered a promising candidate for third-generation solar cells, consequently attracting increasing scientific and industrial interest.6–9 Despite these advantages, the potential of QDSCs has not been fully exploited, with the highest certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) at the level of ∼12%,10–14 far below its theoretical limit (∼44%) and that of lead chalcogenide perovskite counterparts.15 Many reasons have been proposed to elaborate such a mean performance for QDSCs, including the high redox potential for the commonly used polysulfide/sulfide redox couple electrolyte,6–9,16 and the unsatisfactory catalytic reduction activity for the generally adopted Cu2S/brass counter electrode toward the adopted redox couple electrolyte.17,18 QD light-harvesting materials are the core components for QDSCs, and undertake the function of harvesting solar photons, and generating charge carriers (i.e. electron–hole pairs).19 In many cases, the intrinsic electronic structure and crystalline quality of QD light-harvesting materials are probably among the main reasons behind the mean performance of QDSCs. This is because: (i) the bandgap of QDs, which corresponds to the light-harvesting range, determines the theoretical upper limit of the photocurrent and photovoltage of a QDSC;20 (ii) the conduction band (CB) edge of QDs determines the photogenerated electron injection rate, and therefore has a direct relationship to the photovoltaic performance of a QDSC;21 (iii) the crystalline quality of QDs, especially the density of trap state defects, affects charge recombination both inside QDs (before photogenerated electron injection into transport media) and from the metal oxide matrix to the QD sensitizer (after photogenerated electron injection), therefore influencing the photovoltaic performance, especially photovoltage, of the resulting QDSCs.22
Currently, one of the key routes to improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs is to exploit appropriate high-quality QD light-harvesting materials. Besides high stability, an ideal QD light-harvesting material should have a narrow bandgap to harvest a wide range of solar light, a higher CB edge relative to that of the TiO2 electron acceptor to ensure a high electron injection rate from QDs to the TiO2 substrate. Developing high efficiency QDSCs is also a process of exploiting high-quality QD light-harvesting materials. Binary QDs, such as CdS, CdSe, and PbS, were widely tested as light-harvesting sensitizers in the initial stage of QDSCs due to their mature preparation recipe and well-established photoelectronic properties.23–28 On the one hand, the highly toxic features of Cd and Pb elements limit their commercial applications due to environmental and health concerns. On the other hand, the wide bandgap of cadmium chalcogenides limits their light harvesting range (usually <700 nm), and the photocurrent of the corresponding solar cells while the low CB edge of lead chalcogenides hinders the electron injection rate from QDs to the TiO2 matrix, therefore reducing the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs. Therefore, in recent years, exploring composite QD (including alloy and core/shell structures) sensitizers through materials engineering has been the mainstream for high efficiency QDSCs.11,29–35
Less-toxic I–III–VI2 group QDs, especially CuInS2 (CIS), and CuInSe2 (CISe) QDs, with a high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) and near optimal bandgap energy (1.0–1.5 eV) are superior alternatives to highly toxic cadmium and lead chalcogenide QDs.36 Compared to CIS QDs, CISe QDs are a more promising light harvester with a larger exciton Bohr radius (4.1 vs. 10.6 nm), and narrower bulk bandgap energy (1.04 vs. 1.5 eV), which can ensure the light absorption edge extending to the near infrared (NIR) region and harvesting most portion of the solar photons. However, the high density of surface trap defects in plain CIS and CISe QDs results in a severe charge recombination possibility and reduces the photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices accordingly.11,32,37–40 Even though the interfacial engineering strategy by overcoating an energy barrier layer or co-sensitization absorption layer around the surface of the sensitized photoanode can remarkably improve the photovoltaic performance of the resultant cells,41–48 the PCEs of pristine CIS and CISe based QDSCs are still poorer than those of their cadmium chalcogenide QD based counterparts.49 Moreover, because the CB edge in CISe QDs is close to that of TiO2, the injection rate of photogenerated electrons from CISe QDs to TiO2 is low, which therefore results in a low photocurrent and photovoltage in the resulting QDSCs. By targeting on optimizing the electronic structure of CISe QDs to match with the TiO2 substrate and accelerating the photogenerated electron injection rate, impressive results have been achieved in optimizing the chemical stoichiometry in the adopted QDs,50,51 or the strategy of forming alloyed QDs.29–32 Among them, with the incorporation of ZnSe into CISe, the CB edge in the resulting Zn–Cu–In–Se (ZCISe) was upshifted, resulting in a higher electron injection rate and better photovoltaic performance of the corresponding cells. As a result, ZCISe QDSCs have achieved a certified PCE of 11.6%.11 Overcoating a wider bandgap inorganic shell around host QDs to form a type-I core/shell structure is another strategy for eliminating/minimizing the density of trap-state defects in QDs.32,52,53 Recently, with the overgrowth of wide bandgap ZnS and the CdS shell layer around CIS or CISe core QDs, and formation of the quasi type-I core/shell structured QDs, a remarkable enhancement of photovoltaic performance was achieved in the corresponding QDSCs.29,30,32
Herein, targeting at developing higher efficiency QDSC devices, ZCISe/ZnSe type-I core/shell structured QDs were engineered as light-harvesting materials to combine the advantages of both alloy and core/shell structured QD materials. Oleylamine capped ZCISe core QDs with an excitonic absorption edge extending to the near infrared (NIR) region were first prepared through an organic phase high temperature approach. Then a thin layer of the ZnSe shell layer with a wider bandgap was overcoated around the ZCISe QD core to get the targeted ZCISe/ZnSe type-I core/shell structured QDs. The obtained core/shell QDs were immobilized on a mesoporous TiO2 film electrode to form the photoanode via the capping ligand induced self-assembly strategy by dropping MPA-capped QD aqueous solutions onto the film electrode. The constructed core/shell structured ZCIS/ZnSe based QDSCs gave a new efficiency record for this kind of solar cell with an average PCE of 13.71%, and a certified PCE of 13.49% under AM 1.5G one sun irradiation, which is remarkably higher than those of CISe based ones (5.35%), and alloyed ZCISe based ones (12.21%). This work demonstrates the great potential of QD materials engineering in improving the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of ZCISe QDs and ZCISe/ZnSe core/shell QDs
The chemicals and synthetic procedure for ZCISe QDs were identical to those in a literature method.11 Briefly, In(OAc)3 (0.2 mmol), CuI (0.14 mmol), Zn(OAc)2 (0.08 mmol), 1-octadecene (ODE, 4.0 mL), and oleylamine (OAm, 3.0 mL) were loaded in a flask and heated to 180 °C under an argon flow, and then Se precursor solution (0.0425 g Se powder dissolved in 0.4 mL of diphenylphosphine DPP and 0.5 mL of OAm) was quickly injected into the reaction system and maintained for 5 min. The obtained ZCISe QDs were purified by centrifugation and decantation with the addition of ethanol.
A ZnSe shell was overgrown on the obtained ZCISe core QDs by a typical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) approach. The purified ZCISe QDs were re-dispersed in a solvent mixture containing 3.0 mL of ODE and 4.0 mL of OAm and degassed under vacuum at 100 °C for 10 min. After the reaction system was heated to 150 °C in an argon atmosphere, equimolar amounts of Zn(OAc)2 and Se precursor solutions (0.1 mmol) were injected alternately into the reaction system at 15 min intervals for the deposition of the ZnSe shell.
Sensitization of the TiO2 film electrode and fabrication of devices
TiO2 mesoporous films with a thickness of 25 ± 1.5 μm (20.0 μm transparent layer and 5.0 μm light scattering layer) were home made through a screen printing procedure.12 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped water-soluble QDs were obtained from initial oil-soluble QDs via the ligand exchange procedure. QD sensitizers were pipetted onto the TiO2 film and allowed to stay for 2–4 h, and then rinsed with water and ethanol sequentially. Then, the QD-sensitized photoanodes were coated with six cycles of ZnS passivation by immersing alternately into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2 methanol solution and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 1 min per dip.
The cells were fabricated by assembling the counter electrode and QD-sensitized TiO2 film electrode with 50 μm thick Scotch tape as the spacer. The electrolyte was a polysulfide aqueous solution with a composition of 2.0 M Na2S, 2.0 M S, and 0.2 M KCl. The N-MC/Ti electrodes were prepared according to a previous procedure.12
Characterization
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on an FEI TECNAL 12 microscope working at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The UV-vis absorption and PL emission spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-visible and a Cary Eclipse Varian spectrophotometer, respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) curves were tested using a Keithley 2400 source meter and an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel, model no. 94022A). Before each test, a NREL standard Si solar cell was used to calibrate the power of the simulated solar light source to 100 mW cm−2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves were measured on a Keithley 2000 multimeter under the illumination of a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Product DK240 monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out with an impedance analyzer (Zahner, Zennium). The EIS spectra were obtained under dark conditions at a forward bias from −0.35 V to −0.65 V, applying a 20 mV AC sinusoidal signal over the constant applied bias with the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. Transient absorption (TA) measurements were carried out by equipping a regeneratively amplified Ti:sapphire laser source (Coherent Legend, 800 nm, 150 fs, 5 mL per pulse, and 1 kHz repetition rate) and Helios (Ultrafast Systems LLC) spectrometers.
3. Results and discussion
Synthesis and optoelectronic properties of Zn–Cu–In–Se/ZnSe QD materials
Although the previously reported (CuInSe2)0.7(ZnSe)0.3 QDs, abbreviated as ZCISe henceforth, possessed an optimal light absorption range with the absorption onset at ∼1000 nm, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) of the obtained ZCISe QDs was very low (<1%).12 This indicates a high density of the surface trap state defects in the obtained QDs. The presence of trap state defects in the QD sensitizer is detrimental to the photovoltaic performance, especially photovoltage, of the resulting QDSCs.7,19,22 On the one hand, trap states hinder the extraction of photogenerated electrons from QDs due to their lower energy alignment; on the other hand, trap states can serve as charge carrier recombination centers for electron back transfer from the TiO2 substrate to QDs, or for electron leakage from QDs to the oxidation species in the electrolyte.22
In order to decrease or eliminate the surface trap state defects of ZCISe QDs, a wide band gap ZnSe layer was overcoated epitaxially around the pre-prepared ZCISe QDs to form the ZCISe/ZnSe type-I core/shell structured QDs via a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) approach by adding Zn and Se precursors (i.e. Zn(OAc)2 and DPP-Se) alternately. The ZCISe core QDs were synthesized by a dodecanethiol (DDT)-free approach according to a literature method, that is, injecting the DPP-Se solution into the reaction system containing Cu, In and Zn precursor (i.e. CuI, In(OAc)3, and Zn(OAc)2 respectively) stock solutions in oleylamine media at 180 °C.12 The strategy of forming a type-I core/shell heterostructure is commonly used for the preparation of highly luminescent and stable colloidal QDs for their application in labeling, imaging, and lighting.54 The experimental results indicated that ZCISe/ZnSe QDs with 1 monolayer (ML) thickness of ZnSe led to the best photovoltaic performance for the resulting cells. The corresponding ZnSe shell thickness-dependent photovoltaic performance is available in Table S1 and Fig. S1 of the ESI.† For convenience, the ZCISe/ZnSe QD is specifically referred to this core/shell QD with shell thickness of 1 ML henceforth. With the addition of Zn/Se precursor solutions to the original ZCISe QDs, the enhancement of the particle size as observed by TEM measurement (Fig. 1) gives direct evidence for the overgrowth of the ZnSe shell around the ZCISe host core. The TEM images show that the average particle size increased from the initial 4.3 ± 0.3 nm to 5.1 ± 0.4 nm. The increased size corresponds to the thickness of 1 ML of the ZnSe shell. Due to the small difference between the crystalline parameter for ZnSe and ZCISe, the formed ZnSe shell could not be distinguished from the host ZCISe core in the TEM image. Based on the same reason, the XRD patterns (Fig. S2†) of both ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe QDs with a tetragonal chalcopyrite structure also have no significant difference.

The optical spectra (absorption and steady-state PL emission) of the ZCISe core and derived ZCISe/ZnSe core/shell QDs are shown in Fig. 1c. The ZnSe shell thickness dependent optical spectra (UV and PL spectra) of the obtained core/shell QDs are shown in Fig. S3.† With the overgrowth of the ZnSe shell layer around the ZCISe core QDs, both the absorption and PL emission peak positions remained nearly constant. This indicates the formation of the core/shell structure, but not an alloy structure.55 Otherwise, a blue shift should be observed in the absorption and PL emission peak. Similar to a previous report,12 the PL emission efficiency of the ZCISe core was very low, but the PL peak intensity for the ZCISe/ZnSe core/shell QDs was remarkably enhanced (more than 10-fold). The increased PL emission efficiency indicates the effective suppression of defect-trapping of the resulting QDs.54 Unlike the normally observed poorly resolved excitonic absorption peak for most ternary and quaternary composite QDs, a distinct and sharp absorption peak was observed in both ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe QD absorption spectra. This indicates the uniformity of the composition and morphology (including size and shape) of the obtained QD samples as observed from the TEM images. The corresponding absorption onset for both ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe QDs was tailed to the near infrared (NIR) window with a wavelength of ∼1000 nm. It is worth noting that the NIR absorption feature of light absorber sensitizers is a prerequisite condition for a solar cell to obtain a high photocurrent and high PCE.3,6,19
Transient absorption spectroscopy
To uncover the effects of type-I core/shell structured ZCISe/ZnSe QDs on the density of trap state defects and on electron injection dynamics from QDs to the TiO2 electron acceptor, femtosecond (fs)-resolution transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements were carried out on both ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe QDs tethered on an electrically insulating SiO2 or conductive TiO2 substrate with a thickness of ∼5 μm (samples denoted as: ZCISe@SiO2, ZCISe@TiO2, ZCISe/ZnSe@SiO2, and ZCISe/ZnSe@TiO2, respectively) according to the standard literature approach.12,29,30,56 The normalized TA decay curves for the studied samples are shown in Fig. 2. It can be found that for the samples with the insulating SiO2 substrate, the recovery rate of the bleaching is rather slow because of the impossibility of electron injection from the QDs to the insulating substrate. The TA decay curves of the samples with QDs on the SiO2 substrate can be well-fitted by using a bi-exponential function as shown in eqn (1): y = A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2(1)
 Fig. 2  Transient absorption spectroscopy analysis. Kinetic traces of the excitonic decay of QDs deposited on: (a) SiO2, and (b) TiO2. Bold lines are the corresponding fitting curves. 
The fitted parameters for the TA decay dynamics for all the samples are shown in Table 1. It is found that two relaxation processes for photogenerated electrons can be observed for both ZCISe@SiO2 and ZCISe/ZnSe@SiO2 samples. It has been well established that for this kind of sample with an insulating substrate, the intrinsic relaxation dynamics of photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of QDs (radiative recombination with holes in the valence band (VB) and/or non-radiative recombination with trap states) can be deduced from the TA decay of QDs on the insulating SiO2 substrates, and the density of trap states in QDs can then be deduced.12,29,30,56 The faster relaxation processes (τ1) with time constants of a few to a dozen picoseconds (ps) can be ascribed to the non-radiative relaxation process corresponding to trap state defects in the QDs; while the slower portion (τ2) with time constants of dozens of ps to more than one hundred ps should be derived from the radiative recombination of electrons in the CB with holes in the VB of the QDs. In the decay process for ZCISe@SiO2 and ZCISe/ZnSe@SiO2 samples, an obvious difference is that both τ1 and τ2 values of the ZCISe/ZnSe@SiO2 sample (15.9 and 187 ps) are significantly greater than those of the ZCISe@SiO2 sample (5.8 and 81.2 ps). Furthermore, the proportion of the faster relaxation component (A1/(A1 + A2)) is higher in the ZCISe@SiO2 sample in comparison with that in the ZCISe/ZnSe@SiO2 sample (74% vs. 57%). These data translate a higher weight coefficient of trap state-related recombination of carriers in the ZCISe QDs. That is to say with the overgrowth of the ZnSe wide band gap layer around the ZCISe core and the formation of ZCISe/ZnSe core/shell QDs, the density of trap state defects is reduced. These results are consistent with the observed greatly enhanced PL QY in the ZCISe/ZnSe in comparison with ZCISe.

As shown in Fig. 1b, the relaxation dynamics of the photogenerated electrons for the samples with the TiO2 substrate became much faster compared to those with the SiO2 substrate. The reason for this observed faster decay dynamics can be ascribed to the conductive nature of the TiO2 substrate, therefore offering an extra recombination channel for the decay of photogenerated electrons (i.e. from the QDs to TiO2). This is a well-established working principle in solar cells with a sensitization configuration.6,20 A bi-exponential function can also be used to fit the decay curves, and the extracted parameters of these decay processes are shown in Table 1. Based on the fitting parameters, the average lifetimes of the photo-excited carriers for the corresponding sample can be calculated according to eqn (2), as shown in Table 1. tav = (A1t12 + A2t22)/(A1t1 + A2t2)(2)
It can be found that τav for the ZCISe/ZnSe QD (170, 6.8 ps) samples is greater than that for ZCISe (68.4, 4.8 ps) on both SiO2 and TiO2 substrates, indicating a significant decrease in the internal recombination (before charge carrier injection into TiO2). The average electron transfer rates (ket) from the QDs to the TiO2 substrate can then be obtained based on eqn (3) ket = 1/tav(ZCISe/TiO2) − 1/tav(ZCISe/SiO2)(3)
The calculated ket value, as shown in Table 1, for ZCISe/ZnSe QDs (1.4 × 1011 s−1) is slightly smaller than that for plain ZCISe (1.9 × 1011 s−1), which is at the same level as previously reported results.12,29,30,56 This result indicates that the photogenerated electrons in both ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe QDs can be efficiently extracted and injected into the TiO2 electron acceptor. Being a wide bandgap material, the ZnSe shell layer can suppress the internal charge recombination. Meanwhile, the ZnSe layer can also serve as the energy barrier layer and hinder the electron injection rate.32,57 Due to the limited shell thickness (∼1 ML), the two conflicting effects are well traded off and optimal performance is achieved in the obtained ZCISe/ZnSe QDs.
Device assembly and photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the effectiveness of the QD materials engineering in the access of high efficiency QDSCs, the cell devices with a typical structure as shown in Scheme 1 based on the alloyed ZCISe and the derived core/shell structured ZCISe/ZnSe QD light harvesting materials were assembled, and the corresponding photovoltaic performances were studied. It is noted that the effects of the alloying process on the formation of ZCISe from pristine CISe QDs have been demonstrated in ref. 12. Therefore, in this work we only studied the effect of the type-I core/shell structure and adopted the reported performance for CISe QDSCs directly from literature data. First, the investigated QD materials were immobilized on the nanocrystalline TiO2 mesoporous film electrode with high surface coverage through the state-of-the-art deposition approach, capping ligand induced self-assembly deposition route,58 by pipetting bi-functional MPA capped QD aqueous solutions onto the TiO2 film electrode and allowing it to stay for 2–4 h. After the sensitization step, ZnS energy barrier layers were then overgrown around the QD sensitized film electrodes in order to hinder the charge recombination process occurring at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces according to the standard literature method.12,32 Ti mesh supported nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon electrodes (N-MC/Ti) were used as the counter electrode (CE).12 The QDSC devices with a sandwich configuration were fabricated through assembling the QD sensitized photoanodes and N-MC/Ti CEs, and filling polysulfide/sulfide electrolyte aqueous solution containing 2.0 M S and Na2S. For each type of QDSC, five cells were fabricated and measured in parallel, and the average photovoltaic performance was used to evaluate their photovoltaic performance in order to decrease the deviation of the single cell.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the cell device structure and the QD light harvesting materials used. 
The average photovoltaic performance together with the performance of champion cells for each type of cell is listed in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves under one sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2) for ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe champion cells with an active area of 0.238 cm2 are illustrated in Fig. 3a. The detailed performance parameters and J–V curves for individual cells of each type are available in Table S2 and Fig. S4.† It is found that through QD materials engineering, the PCE can be gradually increased from 9.54% corresponding to pristine CISe QDs,11 to 12.49% for the alloyed ZCISe QDs, and further to 13.71% for the core/shell ZCISe/ZnSe QDs. To highlight the effect of this materials engineering, the PCEs of these three types of QDSCs are illustrated in Fig. 3b. It is noted that the observed performance enhancement for ZCISe/ZnSe cells is based on previous best-performing QDSCs.11–13 The ZCISe/ZnSe QDSCs gave a champion PCE of 13.84% (Jsc = 26.70 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.780 V, and FF = 0.664), and a third-party certified efficiency of 13.41% from the National Center of Supervision and Inspection on Solar Photovoltaic Products Quality of China (CPVT). Detailed information on the certification result is available in the ESI.† To the best of our knowledge, this performance is a new efficiency record for QDSCs. It is noted that the performance improvement of ZCISe/ZnSe QDSCs related to ZCISe cells is mainly derived from the enhancement of Voc (0.770 vs. 0.750 V), and FF (0.668 vs. 0.634), while the Jsc values (26.69 vs. 26.22 mA cm−2) remain nearly constant.

 Fig. 3  Photovoltaic performance of ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe core/shell QD-based cells with N-MC/Ti counter electrodes. (a) J–V curves; and (b) average PCE values dependent on QD materials; and (c) EQE curves. 
To confirm the Jsc value observed in the J–V curves, external quantum efficiency (EQE, also referred to as incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, IPCE) was measured, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3c. It can be found that the photocurrent response in the EQE curves matches closely with the absorption spectra of the corresponding QD light harvesting materials as shown in Fig. 1c, and the photocurrent response starts at near 1050 nm for both ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe based cells. The Jsc values calculated by integrating the product of cell's EQE curves and the incident photon flux density for ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe cells are 25.9 and 26.4 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good consistent with the values obtained from the J–V measurements as shown in Table 2. The EQE values for ZCISe/ZnSe are slightly higher than those of ZCISe in the whole photo-response range. EQE is determined by light-harvesting capability (LHE), electron injection efficiency, and charge collection efficiency.34,59 As shown in Fig. S4,† ZCISe and ZCISe/ZnSe sensitized photoanode films show a similar LHE value. Meanwhile, as discussed above, the electron injection rate for ZCISe/ZnSe cells is a little bit slower than that for ZCISe cells. Therefore the higher EQE value observed in ZCISe/ZnSe cells should be ascribed to the higher charge collecting efficiency due to the less charge leakage as confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, and diode ideality factor as discussed below.
Diode ideality factor
In order to uncover the mechanism of the enhanced Voc and FF in ZCISe/ZnSe QDSCs related to ZCISe cells, the corresponding diode ideality factor (n) was extracted through measuring the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the irradiation light intensities. It is noted that the deviation of the n value from 1 is considered the origin of the deficits of the Voc and FF in solar cells.60 When the band edge radiative recombination dominates in a solar cell, n is close to 1. When there are other recombination routes for charge carriers, such as the trap state defects, n > 1. A larger n value indicates a greater probability of the trap state defect-related recombination in a solar cell.60 From the curve of Jsc dependence on the irradiation light intensity (Fig. 4a), the relationship can be expressed as: Jsc ∝ Iα, where I is the irradiation light intensity, and α is the exponential factor. The α values for ZCISe/ZnSe (0.90) and ZCISe (0.91) QDSCs are nearly identical, and close to one. This result demonstrates that both devices have poor bimolecular recombination under the conditions of a short-circuit.61 From the curve of Voc dependence on the irradiation light intensity (Fig. 4b), it can be seen that the curve slope corresponds to nkT/q, where n, k, T, and q are the diode ideality factor, the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively.60,61 The calculated n value for the ZCISe/ZnSe QDSCs (1.18) is much smaller than that of the ZCISe QD devices (1.46). The n values demonstrate that trap assisted recombination is much hindered in ZCISe/ZnSe cells compared to their ZCISe counterparts, and therefore leads to the improvement of Voc and FF in the resultant QDSCs. The reduction of the diode ideality factor in ZCISe/ZnSe QDSCs suggests the decrease of trap state defects in the corresponding ZCISe/ZnSe QD light-harvesting materials through the shell overcoating materials engineering. This finding is consistent with the results from the TA measurements as discussed above.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
In order to disclose the intrinsic mechanism for the better photovoltaic performance, especially higher Voc and FF, of ZCISe/ZnSe QDSCs in comparison with ZCISe QDSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were employed under dark conditions. The EIS technique can distinguish the electrochemical characteristics of each component in a device, such as the photoanode, counter electrode, and electrolyte diffusion, at different forward bias voltages, and therefore acquire the dynamic information on charge recombination and transport.62 The Nyquist curves for ZCISe/ZnSe and ZCISe cells at different bias voltages are shown in Fig. S6.† The corresponding EIS parameters for QDSCs can be extracted from the Nyquist curves by using a standard simulation circuit.11,32,63 The dependence of the extracted chemical capacitance Cμ and recombination resistance Rrec on the forward bias is illustrated in Fig. 5a and b. It is noted that Cμ monitors the trap state distribution in the bandgap of the TiO2 substrate, and therefore represents the change of electron density dependent on the Fermi level of TiO2. Rrec stands for the charge recombination dynamics occurring at the interface of photoanode/electrolyte, and is inversely proportional to the charge recombination rate.62,63
 Fig. 5  Impedance spectroscopy analysis of QDSCs based on ZCISe/ZnSe and ZCISe QD sensitizers: (a) chemical capacitance Cμ, (b) recombination resistance Rrec, and (c) dark current dependent on the applied bias (Vapp), and (d) Nyquist plots of both cells at a forward bias of −0.65 V. 
The nearly overlapping Cμ values at different bias voltages for both QDSCs as illustrated in Fig. 5a indicate that the effects of the two QD light-absorber materials on the CB edge of the TiO2 electron acceptor have no observable difference. This phenomenon is consistent with most of the previous reports.11,32,34,35 Unlike the case for Cμ, there is a remarkable difference in the Rrec values (Fig. 5b) at the same bias voltage between the two QDSCs. The Rrec values for ZCISe/ZnSe cells are about two-fold higher than those for ZCISe cells at each bias voltage. To highlight this difference, Fig. 5d shows a direct comparison of the Nyquist curves for both ZCISe/ZnSe and ZCISe cells at forward bias near the Voc value (0.65 V), and the corresponding EIS parameters are shown in Table S3.† It can be found that the Rrec value at this bias for ZCISe/ZnSe cells (62.3 Ω cm2) is about two-fold greater than that for ZCISe cells (37.9 Ω cm2). The observed higher Rrec for ZCISe/ZnSe related to CISe QDSCs means that the charge recombination process at photoanode/electrolyte interfaces is significantly hindered in ZCISe/ZnSe cells compared to ZCISe cells. It is worth noting that the retarded charge recombination process at photoanode/electrolyte interfaces should be assigned to the TiO2/QD or QD/electrolyte interface, but not the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The reason can be explained as follows. An identical configuration was adopted in the construction of both cells (i.e., identical TiO2 film electrode, redox couple electrolyte, and CE); therefore, there should be no difference in photogenerated electron recombination at the TiO2 surface with the oxidization state species in the electrolyte between the two QDSCs. As confirmed above, the type-I core/shell structured ZCISe/ZnSe QDs reduce the density of trap state defects, and therefore retard the recombination process related to QD sensitizers, i.e. TiO2/QD or QD/electrolyte.
Meanwhile, the electron lifetime deduced from the function of τn = Rrec × Cμ for the ZCISe/ZnSe cells is more than 400 ms longer than that for the ZCISe cells, demonstrating a remarkably slower recombination process in the ZCISe/ZnSe QDSCs. The suppressed charge recombination process would favor the photovoltaic performance, especially for Voc.11,32,34,35 This conclusion is in accordance with the J–V measurements (Table 2). Furthermore, the dark current values, obtained in the EIS measurement (shown in Fig. 5c), of ZCISe cells are remarkably smaller than those of ZCISe cells at each applied voltage. This gives further support to the hypothesis of the retarded recombination process in ZCISe/ZnSe cells in comparison with ZCISe cells.
4. Conclusion
High efficiency “green” QDSCs based on ZCISe/ZnSe QD light-harvesting materials have been developed with an average PCE of 13.71%, and a certified efficiency of 13.49%, which is a new record efficiency for liquid conjunction QD solar cells. The excellent photovoltaic performance for this QDSC can be ascribed to: (i) the broadened light-harvesting range extending to the NIR window; (ii) the type-I core/shell structured configuration for QD light-harvesting materials favouring the decreases of the density of trap state defects, and therefore suppressing the charge recombination process occurring at photoanode/electrolyte interfaces, and enhancing charge collection efficiency, as demonstrated by the diode ideality factor, EIS, and TA measurements, respectively. This work demonstrates the great potential of materials engineering in improving solar cell performance. It is also pointed out that the initial design and preparation of QD light-harvesting materials is a critical stage for achieving high efficiency QDSCs.
