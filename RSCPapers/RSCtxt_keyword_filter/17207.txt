    , Accepted 23rd November 2018First published on 6th December 2018AbstractIn quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSC), a cascade energy level structure controlled by assembly of cadmium–chalcogenide quantum dots can remarkably improve the sunlight harvesting and charge carrier lifetime. Despite the advantages of using co-sensitizers, energy conversion efficiencies are still low. An increased understanding of the causes of the low photoconversion efficiency (PCE) will contribute to the development of a straightforward approach to improve solar cell performance by exploiting co-sensitization. Herein we discuss how an excess of cadmium causes structural disorder and defect levels impacting the PCE of QDSSC devices. Thus, outer CdS1−xSex/inner CdS QD-co-sensitized B,N,F-co-doped-TiO2 nanotubes (BNF-TNT) were prepared. Chalcogenides were deposited by the SILAR method on BNF-TNT, varying the load of CdS as the inner sensitizer, while for CdS1−xSex, five SILAR cycles were used (5-CdS1−xSex), controlling the nominal S/Se molar ratio of the ternary alloy. Cd defects named as Cd–Cd energy levels were observed during CdS sensitization. Although incorporation of outer CdS1−xSex provides a tunable band gap to achieve good band alignment for carrier separation, Cd–Cd energy levels in the sensitizers act as recombination centers, limiting the overall electron flow at the BNF-TNT/CdS/CdS1−xSex interface. A maximum PCE of 2.58% was reached under standard AM 1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Additional limitations of SILAR as a deposition strategy of QDs are also found to influence the PCE of QDSSC.
1. Introduction
Solar energy research has become one of the most important approaches to mitigate the use of fossil fuels. To achieve efficient sunlight absorption and energy conversion, diverse generations of photovoltaic devices have emerged, such as third-generation quantum dot (QD) sensitized solar cells (QDSSC).1 Transition metal chalcogenides such as PbS, CuInS2, CdS, CdSe and CdTe, among others, have been used as sensitizers1–4 due to their high extinction coefficients, tunable band gap (Eg) controlled by the particle size of QDs, and multiple-charge carrier generation by absorption of a single low energy photon. It has been possible to predict a theoretical photovoltaic efficiency higher than 40% for this kind of device,1 overcoming the Shockley and Queisser limit of 32%.
The photoanode is probably the most important variable that affects the photovoltaic performance of QDSSC. Binary chalcogenides have been commonly deposited on TiO2 nanotubes (TNT), where their vertically oriented structure allows photogenerated charge carrier transport in the sensitizers to reach the back contact.4–6 Although the latter characteristic is recognized, a lower photoconversion efficiency (PCE) is still obtained by QDSSC. Many reasons have been considered to explain the poor photovoltaic performance of QDSSC, such as the use of a sensitizer with a unique band gap which limits the harvest of the entire solar spectral region, and low carrier transfer at the TiO2/sensitizer interface.2 To surpass these disadvantages, some modifications have been applied to the photoanode material, for instance: (1) incorporation of impurities into the TiO2 lattice by doping,7,8 which increases electron donor states in the oxide semiconductor, and (2) co-sensitization by deposition of two or more binary chalcogenides on the TiO2 surface, obtaining a wide spectral response.9–11 However, a high proportion of the adsorbed illumination is collected by the outer sensitizer which often does not show a similar band structure to the inner one.12,13 This band edge unmatching blocks electron transport in the heterojunction, providing a low PCE.
A remarkable alternative to reach a balance between an adequate optical band gap and band structure in the composites is the incorporation of a ternary alloy. Some reports have pointed out the deposition of CdS1−xSex solid solutions by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, tuning their optical properties through composition.5,13–15 To vary the S/Se molar ratio in the CdS1−xSex QD deposited on TiO2, a suitable cascade type structure can be formed with other chalcogenides, e.g. CdSe, which improves electron injection from the CdS1−xSex/CdSe interface to the oxide semiconductor.13–15 Nonetheless, the sunlight harvesting is restricted by the band gap of the outer binary sensitizer, limiting the photovoltaic performance of the solar cell. So, could we use a CdS1−xSex ternary alloy QD as an outer sensitizer to absorb a wide solar energy spectrum and increase the electron flow in a composite photoanode? Scarce studies have mentioned the influence of outer ternary alloys assembled with other sensitizers on the PCE of QDSSC,5,16–18 which shows the few explored stepwise band structures generated during the chalcogenide-based co-sensitization of TiO2.
In spite of using a ternary alloy to enhance the photovoltaic properties of QDSSC, a low PCE is still achieved, which allows one to deduce that an additional issue has not been considered to explain the detriment of the cell performance. Some studies have reported the presence of Cd defects in CdS sensitizers, promoting the narrowing of its band gap lower than bulk.19,20 These defects, also called Cd–Cd bondings, correspond to energy levels in chalcogenide formed by CdS nanoparticle interconnection during the SILAR process. The effect of these states on the charge carrier separation and transport abilities of Cd–chalcogenide sensitized photoanodes has not been investigated, presuming to be a “silent” factor in the performance of the QDSSC.
Herein, by correlating the photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic properties of B,N,F-co-doped TNT (BNF-TNT) and co-sensitized with CdS/CdS1−xSex QD, we show the presence and influence of Cd–Cd energy levels on the optical properties and carrier mobility of composite photoanodes. The S/Se molar ratio in the ternary alloy was also studied to attain a suitable way for the electron injection and enhance the PCE of QDSSC. A charge carrier transfer mechanism was proposed to explain the function of CdS1−xSex as an outer sensitizer, and Cd–Cd energy states into a photovoltaic process, to decrease charge recombination and increase the electron lifetime into materials. Finally, we explain the disadvantages of using the SILAR method as a deposition strategy of QDs and their influence on the light harvesting and charge carrier abilities of photoanodes. In this way, a new insight into the main causes that limit the PCE in QDSSC is given.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Synthesis of modified TiO2 nanotubes
The growth of oriented BNF-TNT was carried out by a procedure reported elsewhere.7 Briefly, a pre-treated Ti foil was anodized in an electrolyte solution composed of 0.06 wt% H3BO3, 0.45 wt% NH4F and 2.0 wt% deionized (DI) water in ethylene glycol. A bias potential of 60 V was applied in a two-electrode cell, using a Cu foil as the cathode. The as-prepared samples were washed with DI water, dried at 100 °C and annealed at 400 °C for 1 h, with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. BNF-TNT was detached from Ti by a second anodization using the same stock electrolyte for 15 min, which was again rinsed with DI water and dried at room temperature. Materials were immersed in a 30 wt% H2O2 solution for 5 min. Free-standing films were deposited on ITO conducting glass using a B-TiO2 sol solution as the adhesive.21
2.2. CdS-sensitization of BNF-TNT photoanodes
CdS QD-sensitized BNF-TNT photoanodes were obtained by SILAR; thereby BNF-TNT photoanodes were dipped into a cationic solution containing 0.5 M CdSO4·8/3H2O methanol/water solution (volume ratio 1:1) for 1 min, followed by rinsing with methanol for 30 s. Then, they were immersed in a 0.5 M Na2S methanol/water anionic solution (volume ratio 1:1) for 1 min. Sensitized BNF-TNT photoanodes were again rinsed with methanol for 30 s. The latter two-step dipping into the Cd2+ and S2− methanol precursors was considered as one SILAR cycle. Several numbers of SILAR cycles (Y = 2, 3, 4, and 5) were conducted during sensitization to deposit different loads of CdS on BNF-TNT, hereafter denoted as BNF-Y-CdS. Composites were annealed at 250 °C for 2 h at 3 °C min−1.
2.3. CdS1−xSex-sensitization of BNF-4-CdS photoanodes
CdS1−xSex alloy QDs were grown on BNF-4-CdS by using a N2-filled glove box as described elsewhere7,22 with some modifications. Briefly, 4-CdS materials were immersed in 0.03 M CdSO4·8/3H2O ethanol/water cationic solution (volume ratio 1:1) and then separately dipped into several molar concentrations of both Na2S ethanol/water solution (volume ratio 1:1) and Se2− ethanol solutions, each one for 30 min. After the immersion in each SILAR precursor, materials were rinsed with ethanol for 30 s. The sum of concentrations between both the S2− and Se2− anionic solutions was equal to the concentration of the Cd2+ source (0.03 M). In this way, the S/Se molar ratio was varied from 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 to 0, by increasing the Se content in the ternary alloy. Nominal compositions of CdS0.67Se0.33, CdS0.50Se0.50, CdS0.33Se0.67 and CdSe were obtained, respectively. Five SILAR cycles were used during CdS1−xSex sensitization.7 Materials were called BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex hereafter. A ZnS passivation layer was deposited on the latter composite photoanodes by using two-SILAR cycles, from Zn2+ and S2− aqueous cationic and anionic solutions composed of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S. Materials were annealed at 250 °C for 2 h.
2.4. Morphological and physicochemical characterization of composite photoanodes
Morphologies of BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex photoanodes were characterized by FESEM with an FEI Quanta 650 FEG, while QD based sensitizers were observed by TEM and HR-TEM by using a Tecnai F20 Super Twin TMP. An energy of 200 keV was employed during image acquisition. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the composites were recorded by using a Shimadzu PC 2401 UV-vis spectrometer. The wavelength range for the measurements was 200–800 nm. The oxide and chalcogenides contained in the materials were characterized by micro-Raman spectroscopy, using a confocal high-resolution Raman spectrometer. A 532 nm green laser was focused on a spot of 1 μm in the wavenumber range of 100–1000 cm−1, averaging 100 scans with an integration time of 5 s. XPS analyses were performed with a SPECS PHOIBOS 150 spectrometer equipped with a hemispheric analyzer. XPS spectra of elements identified in the composites were fixed with the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV, using an Al anode with an X-energy source of 1486.6 eV. To decompose the N 1s, B 1s, F 1s, Ti 2p, Cd 3d, S 2p and Se 3d peaks, Shirley background was subtracted from the corresponding spectra, applying a Gaussian–Lorentzian mixed function (70:30). Normalized XPS spectra of BNF-TNT were recorded before and after Y-CdS and Y-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex, in the binding energy range between 0 and 10 eV.
2.5. Photo(electro)chemical measurements of photoanodes
The effect of CdS load and the variation of S/Se molar ratio in the ternary alloy on the photoelectrochemical properties of BNF-Y-CdS and BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex photoanodes was investigated in a three-electrode cell using an electrolyte solution containing N2-bubbled 0.25 M Na2S + 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH 12). An Autolab 302N potentiostat was employed to carry out the photochemical and electrochemical characterization. An AGKSP grade-type graphite rod and Ag|AgCl|3 M KCl (+210 mV vs. NHE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Open-circuit photopotential curves were recorded by illuminating the samples for 600 s during two light on/off cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were obtained under illumination at OCP, in frequency ranges from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz for the BNF-Y-CdS, and 20 kHz to 0.01 Hz for BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex, using an amplitude of 10 mV. A halide lamp of 60 mW cm−2 with a UV-filter was used as the visible-light source.
2.6. Fabrication of Y-CdS and Y-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex-sensitized quantum dot solar cells
BNF-Y-CdS and BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex photoanodes were assembled with both the CuS/FTO and Cu2S/Cu based cathodes and filled with a polysulfide solution composed of 0.5 M Na2S + 0.5 M S in DI water:methanol solution (volume ratio 1:1). Cathodes were obtained from a procedure described elsewhere.23 Briefly for Cu2S/Cu, Cu foils were polished with diverse silicon carbide papers, rinsed with acetone and DI water, each one for 5 min and dried under ambient conditions. Metal samples were immersed in an aqueous polysulfide solution composed of 1.0 M Na2S + 1.0 M S for 20 min. A black film was formed on the Cu surface, indicating the formation of Cu2S coating.23 In the case of CuS/FTO, cathodes were obtained by the spray pyrolysis method, where a spray solution composed of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O and CS(NH2)2 in a Cu:S molar ratio of 1:2 was deposited on pre-treated FTO substrates at a temperature of 280 °C, employing a spray deposition rate of 7 mL min−1.24 Current–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves were obtained by using a Keithley 4200 source meter at 50 mV s−1 for BNF-Y-CdS, and at 100 mV s−1 for BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex at room temperature. The exposed area of photoanodes was 0.23 cm2, which was illuminated with an Oriel sol 3A sun simulator calibrated with a 91150 V Si reference cell to establish 1 sun conditions (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). An Oriel IQE 200 was used to determine the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE). The maximum IPCE values of the samples were verified by using an Autolab 302N potentiostat equipped with an Autolab LED driver kit. A black plastic tape-based mask was deposited on top of the photoanodes to avoid light scattering. For each solar device, the cell performance was checked in triplicate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and physicochemical properties of photoanodes

Fig. 1 shows the representative TEM images of BNF-4-CdS and BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex. The tubular structure was observed for both the composites. It is appreciated that the sensitizer nanoparticles covered BNF-TNT. This indicates the complete deposition of the CdS and CdS1−xSex nanoparticles along the tubes after chalcogenide sensitization. Black zones indicate well-dispersed nanoparticles on BNF-TNT. In the case of BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex a higher amount of these black zones was achieved as a result of the deposition of more nanoparticles after ternary alloy sensitization. The typical morphology of chalcogenides on BNF-TNT was also observed in FESEM images. Here, nanotubes were vertically aligned, with an average length of 16.6 ± 1.3 μm (Fig. S1†).

Vertically oriented TNTs have been studied to be a favorable structure to improve the PCE of QDSSC compared to other morphologies, for instance TiO2 nanoparticles (NP). TNT can address electron transport from QDs to back contact and increase the charge carrier flow, electron lifetime and photocurrent into the solar cell. In contrast, NPs generate grain boundaries in the nanoparticle interconnection, promoting the charge carrier recombination at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface, and the decrease of the photovoltaic performance in the device.25,26 On the other hand, TNT with large pore diameters can facilitate inter/intratubular QD deposition. This promotes suitable electrolyte infiltration and thereby a better QD/electrolyte contact area to increase the PCE of QDSSC. In the case of NPs, a rapid blockage of their pores can be achieved after QD growth, which hinders the penetration of the electrolyte and declines the PCE of the device.27
HR-TEM images display the preferential planes of the CdS and CdS1−xSex covering BNF-TNT. The interplanar spacing of 0.35 nm was associated with the (101) plane of the anatase phase (PDF 21-1272),7,9 while the lattice fringe around 0.20 nm and 0.22 nm corresponded to the (110) and (220) planes of CdS, respectively.28,29 The anatase phase and the (110) plane of CdS were determined in both composites. Interplanar distances around 0.31 nm and 0.36 nm were ascribed to the (101) and (100) planes of CdS into CdS1−xSex, respectively.1,30 Nanoparticle sizes of the chalcogenides covering BNF-TNT were also estimated to be around 7.85 ± 0.11 nm and 5.59 ± 0.30 nm for CdS and CdS1−xSex, respectively. These values indicated the QD-scale of the sensitizers, according to other authors.31,32In situ deposition strategies of QDs such as chemical bath deposition and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) allow the formation of larger QDs than other alternative strategies, for instance self-assembling from colloidal QD solutions. By considering the reported experimental measurements, the particle size of CdS QDs grown by in situ strategies has been calculated to be around 4–10 nm.31–33 In this sense, the quantum confinement effect for CdS occurs when the particle size is less than 11 nm.34

Fig. 2a depicts the STEM-mapping of the BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex composite to observe the distribution of the elements in the material. Ti and O atoms were located along the tubular structure, while F, Cd, S and Se were found to be on the nanotube surface in a minor load. According to chemical analysis, the amount of S was much higher than that of Se. This was due to the fact that sulfur atoms did not only derive from the CdS1−xSex alloy, but also from the inner CdS deposited previously on BNF-TNT. On the other hand, micro-Raman scattering analyses were conducted for the BNF-TNT, BNF-4-CdS and BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex composites to corroborate their composition (Fig. 2b). Bare BNF-TNT showed 4 peaks at 142.3, 191.2, 393.6, and 635.5 cm−1 attributed to the anatase phase of TiO2. After 4-CdS sensitization, the most intense peak at 142.3 cm−1 disappeared and two new peaks appeared at 293.2 cm−1 and 589.7 cm−1. These peaks were ascribed to the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon frequencies of CdS.35,36 After 5-CdS1−xSex sensitization, characteristic peaks were achieved at 200, 293.2, 395, 472.3, 486.5 and 582.3 cm−1. The presence of the latter signals was associated with the combination of LO phonons of CdS and CdSe in the CdS1−xSex.35 These results corroborate the formation of 4-CdS and 5-CdS1−xSex after BNF-TNT SILAR sensitization.

Changes in the optical properties of BNF-Y-CdS and BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex composites were studied by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Band-gap (Eg) values were estimated by extrapolating the modified Kubelka–Munk curves. Bare BNF-TNT showed two slopes associated with two different Eg values (Fig. 3a), which were lower than the intrinsic Eg of TiO2 (3.2 eV), indicating the presence of intra-band gap energy levels. The photoactivation of TiO2 at 2.80 eV and 2.31 eV was ascribed to the electron transitions from N 2p energy levels to either the bottom edge of the conduction band (CB), or Ti3+ energy levels formed by substitutional fluorine/interstitial boron into the semiconductor, respectively.7,19,37 From the latter energies, it can be deduced that Ti3+ is located at 0.49 eV from the CB edge of TiO2.37 B, N and F atoms can be introduced into the TiO2 lattice during the BNF-TNT growth, promoting the modification of TiO2.7

On the other hand, on increasing the number of SILAR cycles (Y) during CdS sensitization (Fig. 3a), a red-shift in the Eg value was achieved. This indicated a lower energy to generate electron excitations in the chalcogenide. Eg values were estimated to be 2.25, 2.20, 2.16 and 2.13 eV for Y-CdS, where Y = {3, 4, 5 and 6} SILAR cycles, respectively. It has been reported that Eg of CdS bulk (Eg,bulk) is around 2.42 eV.38 Here, the deposition of Y-CdS on BNF-TNT provided lower Eg values than that of CdS bulk. Therefore, the optical properties of BNF-Y-CdS composites did not depend on the particle size (quantum confinement effect), but the amount of CdS deposited SILAR cycle by cycle. It could be explained in terms of the residual Cd2+ formation on the CdS after SILAR sensitization. During this process, an excess of Cd2+ produced by sulfur vacancies remained on the CdS surface. The adjacent cations on the surface of deposited CdS can promote the formation of Cd–Cd bonds in the nanoparticle interconnection, as a result of covalent dangling bonds between the sp2 hybrid orbitals of cadmium cations. New energy states are created and located close to the valence band (VB) edge of CdS, which are composed mainly of Cd 5s bonding orbitals.19,20 These intra-band gap levels have a higher energy than that of the VB composed of S 3p orbitals into CdS.20 In this sense, the lowering of Eg to increase the SILAR cycles suggested the formation of these Cd–Cd energy levels, upward shifting the VB edge closer to the CB into the CdS.
After 5-CdS1−xSex deposition as an outer sensitizer on the BNF-4-CdS composites, modified K–M curves were obtained as shown in Fig. 3b. To increase the Se content in the ternary alloy, Eg values were red-shifted compared to those of CdS-composites. This indicated the narrowing of Eg by tuning the band edges of CdS with Se addition, which caused the CdS1−xSex ternary alloy formation. Eg values were determined to be 1.87, 1.82, 1.78 and 1.67 eV for 5-CdS1−xSex with S/Se = 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0, respectively. The decrease of Eg in the BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex was accompanied by a change in the colouration of materials from light to dark red. Ternary alloys showed the characteristics of binary CdS (yellow) and CdSe (brownish red) to vary the Se content (Fig. 3c). A high Se fraction in the CdS1−xSex indicated that its optical properties were increasingly similar to those of CdSe. The formation of CdS1−xSex alloys was corroborated by their corresponding Eg, which was of intermediate values between Eg,bulk of CdS12 and CdSe.7,39
The chemical composition and environment of BNF-TNT before and after 4-CdS and 5-CdS1−xSex sensitization were investigated by XPS analysis. From the survey spectrum (Fig. 4a), the presence of Ti, C, O, Cd and S was verified in the BNF-4-CdS composite, while Se was also observed in BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex. The Ti signal was decreased after sensitization. B, N and F were not detected in the materials, indicating the low content of these elements. According to the latter, high resolution XPS (HR-XPS) spectra of B 1s, N 1s, F 1s, and Ti 2p were also achieved (Fig. S2†).

Fig. 4b depicts the HR-XPS Cd 3d spectra of BNF-TNT after 4-CdS and 5-CdS1−xSex sensitization. Both the composites showed main doublets at 404.8 and 411.6 eV, corresponding to the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 signals from the cadmium cations in the CdS. However, each Cd 3d peak was decomposed into additional two contributions. The first doublet at 404.9/411.5 eV was attributed to the Cd–S bond from chalcogenides,40 while the second doublet at 406.5/413.2 eV was attributed to the Cd–Cd energy states in the CdS and CdS1−xSex.20 Theoretical calculations have shown that the Cd–Cd energy levels are produced by the combination of two electrons from Cd sp2 hybrid orbitals. The hybridization of Cd orbitals appears during the sulfur vacancy formation.20 Cd sp2 hybrid orbitals are also bonded with S sp3 hybrid orbitals, indicating that Cd–Cd bonding is not a metal bond into the CdS lattice. Hence, these electrons are far away from the Cd core requiring a high binding energy to be detected.20 The peak identification reinforced the idea about why Eg values for BNF-Y-CdS are lower than those of CdS bulk, discussed above: the higher the amount of Cd–Cd energy states, the higher the upward shifting of the CdS VB, leading to a narrowed Eg.
In the case of CdS1−xSex, the influence of Cd–Cd energy states on a ternary alloy prepared by SILAR has not been explained in the literature. Comparing the determined optical Eg of both the Y-CdS- and CdS1−xSex-sensitized materials, we suggest that Cd–Cd energy levels do not affect the optical properties of the latter photoanodes by Se modification (Eg < 2.0 eV). Even so, the presence of these states can influence other properties of composites (for instance, electron transport to back contact). Finally, N was also detected in the HR-XPS Cd 3d spectrum for 4-CdS at 402.7 eV, coming from the adsorbed NOx on the BNF-TNT surface.37

Fig. 4c shows the S 2p spectra of both Cd–chalcogenide composites, where two doublets were attained from S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks. The first doublet at 161.4/163.6 eV was related to the sulfide anions in the CdS,40,41 while the doublet at 168.2/169.4 eV was ascribed to the SO3 species on the CdS shell.42 The latter contribution was shifted by around 1.0 eV for the 5-CdS1−xSex, assigned to SO4.40–42 This indicates the partial oxidation of the CdS and CdS1−xSex surfaces, which is unavoidable even under ultrahigh vacuum conditions.43 For BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex, an additional doublet appeared at 159.3/165.2 eV, corresponding to the Se 3p signals from Se in the outer sensitizer.13 The existence of Se in the 5-CdS1−xSex was also corroborated by the Se 3d spectrum (Fig. 4d), achieving the typical doublet at 53.7/54.8 eV.10,28
3.2. Photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic properties of BNF-Y-CdS photoanodes
The photochemical response of BNF-TNT free-standing films sensitized with CdS QDs varying the SILAR cycle was determined by photopotential measurements. Upon illumination, the photopotential values of BNF-Y-CdS were displaced to more negative values (Fig. 5a). Photosteady-state potential (Eoc) values were −1.03, −1.12, −1.10, and −0.87 VAg/AgCl for Y = 3, 4, 5, and 6 SILAR cycles, respectively. The Eoc of bare BNF-TNT was −0.82VAg/AgCl. This indicated that the CdS sensitization improved the light activation of TiO2. The higher the number of SILAR cycles up to 4, the higher the Eoc reached, improving the electron accumulation in the CB of BNF-TNT. This promoted the Fermi level shift of TiO2 closer to its CB. However, the Eoc was decreased to exceed the SILAR cycles over 4. Accordingly, the displacement of Eoc to less negative values to deposit 5-CdS and 6-CdS QD was ascribed to the formation of Cd–Cd energy levels excess in materials, which facilitated charge carrier recombination in the sensitizer and the decrease of Eoc. The presence of Cd–Cd energy states was achieved by turning off the illumination, where two shoulders (named P1 and P2) appeared during the open circuit potential decay (OCPD). This suggests the presence of two species on the photoanode surface after an oxidation process. Cd–Cd energy levels are composed of residual Cd2+ from the CdS surface, favouring the adsorption of sulfur-containing anions. The electrolyte consists of sulfide (S2−) and sulfite (SO32−) anions, which act as a sacrificial reagent to promote the high photostability of BNF-Y-CdS. This means that the latter species can be adsorbed and oxidized at the photoanode/electrolyte interface transferring electrons to CdS.44 The oxidation process of sulfide and sulfite anions is carried out through the following reactions:40,45 2S2− + 2h+ → S22−(1) SO32− + S2− + 2h+ → S2O32−(2)
 Fig. 5  (a) Open circuit photopotential, (b) J–V characteristic curves (v = 50 mV s−1) and (c) schematic representation of band structure into the BNF-Y-CdS photoanodes as a function of the number of SILAR cycles. Electrolyte: 0.25 M Na2S + 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH 12), illumination source: halide lamp (60 mW cm−2). The J–V measurements were conducted under simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2) in 0.5 M Na2S + 0.5 M S in DI water:methanol solution (volume ratio 1:1). 

E
oc was obtained after two light on/off cycles, where the photodecomposition of CdS QDs was avoided. After turning off the light, P1 and P2 signals were registered in the dark and were ascribed to the adsorbed S22− and S2O32− anions, respectively. The assignation of peaks was corroborated by the photopotential measurement of BNF-4-CdS in an electrolyte composed only of S2− anions. Thereby, the P2 signal was only registered confirming the interaction of the sulfide anions and electrode. The magnitude of P1 and P2 peaks was increased by increasing the number of SILAR cycles to 4. The highest Eoc in BNF-4-CdS is related to: (1) the increase of Cd2+ to react with sulfur species and (2) the generation of more available photoholes to increase the oxidizing power of the composite to carry out reactions (1) and (2). Furthermore, the generation of S˙− radicals from the direct reaction of S2− anions and the photogenerated holes in chalcogenides (eqn (3)) has been claimed. These radicals rapidly react with other sulfide anions to produce polysulfide radicals, denoted as (Sn+1)˙−. These last species can capture the photogenerated electrons in the photoanode to produce (Sn+1)2− species (reaction (4)):46 S˙− + nS2− → (Sn+1)˙−(3) (Sn+1)˙− + Y-CdS (e−) → (Sn+1)2− + Y-CdS(4)
The presence of sulfur species suggests the formation of sulfide/sulfite radicals at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and their subsequent reactions (eqn (3) and (4)), not only with other anions in solution, but also with S2− anions from CdS. This can be supported for the OCPD, where P1 and P2 peaks were eventually more pronounced after each light on/off cycle. This indicates the adsorption of more sulfur species on the photoanode surface.
The preparation of Cd-chalcogenide-sensitized free-standing films adhered on transparent conducting substrates maximizes the light harvesting and their transformation at electricity,4–6 which also depends mainly on the load of the deposited sensitizer. For this case, the fabrication of photovoltaic devices using the BNF-Y-CdS photoanodes allowed the estimation of the material with the best photovoltaic properties as a function of the number of SILAR cycles during CdS sensitization. In this sense, typical J–V characteristic curves were obtained for the BNF-Y-CdS photoanodes, assembling each material to a CuS/FTO cathode and filling the device with the polysulfide solution. To avoid the carrier recombination between the BNF-TNT and BNF-Y-CdS photoanodes with the electrolyte, two ZnS layers were deposited on the material surface.6,9 As seen from Fig. 5b, the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) estimated from the J–V curves were increased until the deposition of 4-CdS on the BNF-TNT. Conversely, the sensitization of bare BNF-TNT with 5-CdS and 6-CdS QD led to a decrease of Jsc and Voc. The photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V curves are shown in Table 1. An efficient electron injection occurs from 4-CdS to BNF-TNT via the CB and then transferred to the back contact, increasing the photocurrent generated by the device.47

Furthermore, Voc depends on the number of accumulated electrons in BNF-TNT. This photovoltaic parameter is defined as the difference between the quasi-Fermi Level and the energy associated with the redox couple used as the electrolyte (S2−/Sn2−).47 The higher the electron content in the photoanode, the higher the Voc value achieved. After 5-CdS sensitization, the decrease of PCE was twofold: (1) by exceeding the load of CdS QD up to 4, a higher number of nanoparticles were deposited on the BNF-TNT surface, providing more recombination sites by Cd–Cd energy states19,20 and grain boundaries in the photoanodes48 and (2) the use of the CuS/FTO cathode, which loses eventually its performance to electrocatalyze the polysulfide redox reactions by removing the CuS film (see Fig. S3a†).
After assembling the BNF-4-CdS photoanode with a Cu2S/Cu cathode, a higher Jsc and FF were achieved, indication of an improved polysulfide solution renovation.49 As seen in Fig. S3b,† Cu2S/Cu shows higher stability than CuS/FTO after the photovoltaic process, which can be caused by the reaction of free Cu and the polysulfide solution. This avoids the loss of electroactivity in the Cu–cathode.
The PCE of the device using the Cu2S/Cu was around 0.76%, while a maximum efficiency of 0.46% was reached when using the CuS/FTO cathode. On the other hand, the synergistic effect between boron doping and CdS sensitization was studied to compare the photovoltaic performance of photoanodes in the presence and absence of a dopant. This also allowed the determination of the nature of energy levels affecting charge carrier transport at the BNF-TNT/CdS interface. A higher Jsc and Voc were obtained for BNF-4-CdS than those for CdS-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes without B-doping (NF-4-CdS), due to an increase of Ti3+ species by the presence of boron. According to the XPS analysis, the fraction of Ti3+ (located at 0.49 eV from the CB of TiO2) was increased after B doping (from 1.23 to 1.72%), which represents more transported electrons into the composite.7,21 Ti3+ can transfer electrons to CdS, promoting charge carrier separation and the increase of photocurrent in the device.7,50 The PCE of NF-4-CdS by using the Cu2S/Cu cathode was around 0.38%. Hence, an improvement of electron–hole pair separation and transport into the BNF-TNT/CdS interface was achieved. The spatial charge carrier separation and transportation capability of BNF-Y-CdS composites were also determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) through Nyquist plots (Fig. S4†). EIS parameters are depicted in Table S1.† After 4-CdS sensitization, the lowest internal electron mobility resistance was achieved as a result of favored electron injection from 4-CdS to BNF-TNT mediated by Cd–Cd energy states.
To see the band structure modification of BNF-Y-CdS as a function of the Cd–Cd energy levels formed during the SILAR process (Fig. 5c), their corresponding conduction and valence band edges were estimated using eqn (5) and (6):7,36,51 ECB = χ − Ee − 0.5Eg(5) EVB = ECB + Eg(6)where ECB and EVB are the conduction and valence energy levels, χ is the absolute electronegativity of semiconductors (5.80 eV and 5.07 eV for TiO2 and CdS, respectively), and Ee is the free energy of electrons in the solid (4.5 eV). χ was calculated from the geometric mean of Millikan electronegativities of the elements contained in the oxide and chalcogenide.51 In order to obtain the band structure at pH 12, ECB and EVB were displaced by 0.059 V per pH unit, taking into account that the isoelectric point pH of CdS and TiO2 is around 2.0 and 5.8, respectively.52 Although the quantum confinement effect is not validated for chalcogenides where their respective Eg < Eg,bulk, the incorporation of intraband-gap levels into the sensitizer is the key factor to decrease Eg.
In the case of CdS, a low photoactivation energy is caused by the introduction of Cd–Cd energy levels, upward shifting the VB of chalcogenides.19,20 To increase the number of SILAR cycles to 4 during CdS sensitization, a balance between Eg and an adequate band alignment between Ti3+ and Cd–Cd energy levels were achieved. To exceed the number of SILAR cycles over 4, more intraband gap Cd–Cd energy states were added, trapping electrons in the grain boundaries to hinder their transport to back contact. In addition, the driving force for electron injection from Ti3+ to Cd–Cd levels was decreased, contributing to carrier recombination in the BNF-TNT/CdS composite. This can explain low photovoltaic parameter values (Table 1) and a high carrier transport resistance in BNF-5-CdS and BNF-6-CdS composite photoanodes.
3.3. Photo(electro)chemical and photovoltaic properties of BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex composite photoanodes
After choosing the suitable number of SILAR cycles of Y-CdS QDs to promote a suitable way for photogenerated carrier transport in a photovoltaic device, a ternary alloy based on 5-CdS1−xSex QDs was deposited on the BNF-4-CdS surface. The latter was carried out to overlap the limited low-energy harvesting provided by 4-CdS (Eg = 2.20 eV), transport more charge carriers to the back contact and improve the PCE in QDSSC. As a first approach, photopotential measurements were conducted on the BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex composite photoanode, where the photochemical response of the materials mainly depended on the different nominal S/Se molar ratios in the ternary alloy (Fig. S5†). According to the n-type characteristic of CdS, an n–n type heterostructure in the CdS/CdS1−xSex interface can be established. The photo-steady Eoc values were determined to be 0.86, 1.09, −0.93 and −0.77 VAg/AgCl for the photoanodes with S/Se molar ratios of 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.0, respectively. To decrease the S/Se molar ratio to 1.0 in the ternary alloy, the Eoc value was displaced to more negative potentials, which indicated the enhancement of low-energy absorption, the photogeneration and accumulation of more charge carriers in the heterostructure.
However, the lower the S/Se molar ratio, the more positive Eoc was. It has been claimed that to vary the S/Se molar ratio in CdS1−xSex sensitized TiO2 photoanodes, the VB and CB edges of the ternary alloy can be tuned to match with the band edges of TiO2 or other co-sensitizers.13–15,18 Here, the higher the amount of Se in the CdS1−xSex, the lower the Eg and the energy difference between the CB edges of the ternary alloy and the TiO2/CdS. A cascade-type structure (II-type heterojunction) could be produced into the composite photoanode, which facilitated electron injection from the CdS1−xSex/electrolyte interface to BNF-TNT mediated by CdS.5,13 Therefore, for S/Se = 1.0, an adequate band alignment at the BNF-TNT/CdS/CdS1−xSex interface was achieved to promote carrier separation. Conversely, to exceed the Se content in the ternary alloy (S/Se < 0.5), a lower driving force could be developed in the CdS/CdS1−xSex heterojunction, inducing charge carrier recombination and generation of a low Eoc. To observe the electronic transfer ability from CdS1−xSex to CdS in each composite, OCPD curves were observed after turning off the illumination. A fast/slow OCPD is proportional to the carrier recombination rate in the materials. The electron lifetime (τn) of the CdS/CdS1−xSex heterojunction can be estimated from the reciprocal of the OCPD by the following relationship:14 (7)where kB is Boltzmann's constant, e is the electron charge, T is the absolute temperature and (dEoc/dt)−1 is the reciprocal of photopotential decay in the dark. By plotting τnvs. potential decay (Fig. 6a), it was observed that an increase of τn and a slow OCPD were reached to decrease the S/Se molar ratio to 1.0, which was an indication of a high electron recombination resistance in the heterostructure. A smaller S/Se molar ratio promoted a faster OCPD and a decrease of τn, due to a declined electron–hole pair separation at the CdS/CdS1−xSex interface. It proves that the S/Se molar ratio in the ternary alloy affected the heterojunction established in the co-sensitizers, providing a poor alignment to increase the Se content. Here, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of CdS1−xSex could recombine with the holes accumulated in the VB or with the oxidized species from the electrolyte.5,14,15 On the other hand, some studies have reported high sunlight harvesting capability and photovoltaic efficiency of CdS/CdSe co-sensitized TiO2 based photoanodes in QDSSC.6,9,10 Even so, by obtaining a typical open-circuit response of a BNF-4-CdS-5-CdSe composite, the lowest Eoc and τn, and the fastest OCPD were achieved. This indicated a deficient electron transfer and a high charge carrier recombination rate at the CdS/CdSe interface. Electron recombination rates (kr) for each photoanode were estimated to normalize their corresponding OCPD curves and fit the decay to a first-order model:53 (8)where E is the potential measured during the OCPD, Eo is denoted as the steady-state potential under dark conditions, and Eoc is the photosteady-state potential. From the normalized OCPD curves shown in the inset of Fig. 6a, kr values were calculated to be 3.2 × 10−2 s−1, 4.8 × 10−3 s−1, 3.1 × 10−2 s−1 and 5.2 × 10−1 s−1 for the BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex photoanodes with a S/Se molar ratio of 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.0, respectively. The suitable cascade-type structure formed at the BNF-TNT/CdS/CdS1−xSex interfaces for S/Se = 1.0 led to a better electron–hole pair separation in the ternary sensitizer than the other chalcogenide ratios, which retarded charge carrier recombination in the heterostructure.13 Thus, more holes are available in the VB of CdS1−xSex to react with the electrolyte and avoid the photodecomposition of the sensitizer.

Electrolyte: 0.25 M Na2S + 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH 12), illumination source: halide lamp (60 mW cm−2). The J–V measurements were conducted under simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2) in 0.5 M Na2S + 0.5 M S in DI water:methanol solution (volume ratio 1:1). The inset of a shows the normalized photopotential decay. 
With the aim of studying the photovoltaic properties of the BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex composite photoanodes in a QDSSC, each material was assembled to a Cu2S/Cu cathode and filled with the polysulfide solution. J–V characteristic curves were obtained (Fig. 6b), where the photovoltaic parameters such as Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE were extracted and are shown in Table 2. A similar Voc was obtained for the photoanodes with S/Se = 2.0 and 1.0, which means electron injection from the CdS1−xSex to BNF-TNT, displacing the quasi-Fermi level close to its CB.21,37 Nevertheless, Jsc and FF were higher in the photoanode with S/Se = 1.0.

The increase of Se content in the ternary alloy led to a narrowing of the Eg, improving visible-light harvesting to generate more charge carriers in the composite. This modification could cause indirectly a low energy difference between conduction band edges at the CdS/CdS1−xSex interface. Even so, this change was enough to promote the formation of a cascade-type structure in the heterojunction to increase the electron flow into the harvester.15,18 Accumulated holes in the outer sensitizer can react with the polysulfide solution to renew the electrons transported to the back contact. The PCE was around 1.71% and 2.58% for composites using the 5-CdS0.67Se0.33 and 5-CdS0.50Se0.50, respectively. The latter value is higher than that of other devices using outer ternary alloys as sensitizers in QDSSC.4,5,14
To exceed the amount of Se in CdS1−xSex to S/Se < 0.5, Jsc, Voc and FF were decreased, indication of a low electron transfer to the back contact. In this case, a narrowed Eg was obtained, increasing harvested photons by the ternary sensitizer. However, a low Voc indicated that fewer electrons were injected into the BNF-TNT mediated by CdS, shifting the Fermi level to more positive potentials. This meant that the CB band edge of CdS exhibited a similar or higher energy than that of CdS1−xSex, which restrains carrier mobility into the heterostructure.5,13–15 The electron–hole pair recombination is eased at the CdS1−xSex/electrolyte interface, which could provide the photodissolution of the ternary alloy. Thus, the PCE for the BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS0.33Se0.67 was decreased to 1.65%. By comparing the Voc of the latter material (S/Se = 0.5) and the BNF-4-CdS studied under the same experimental conditions (Table 1), a lower voltage value was obtained in the presence of the ternary alloy. The photovoltaic measurements are in good agreement with the open-circuit response of each material.
Some factors affect the PCE of QDSSC using the BNF-TNT/4-CdS/5-CdS1−xSex assembly: (1) the increase of recombination sites in the CdS and CdS1−xSex nanoparticle interconnection.9,15 This issue hinders the electron mobility from the composite photoanode to the cathode. Thus, the ability of the cathode to regenerate the polysulfide solution is decreased, lowering the Voc and FF values.7 Beyond this result, the Jsc values are high, deducing that Ti3+ donor states formed in BNF-TNT can also support light harvesting and charge carrier separation in the device. (2) The overload of QDs can retard the electrolyte penetration, decreasing the QD/electrolyte contact area and charge carrier transfer at the BNF-TNT/QD/electrolyte interface.9,15 Finally, (3) Cd–Cd energy levels created in CdS and CdS1−xSex during SILAR sensitization can also act as additional recombination centers for electron trapping, restraining their flow from the outer CdS1−xSex sensitizer to back contact. The latter aspect is a “silent” factor to limit the optical and electronic properties of photoanodes used in the QDSSC.19,20
To understand the improvement of PCE in the solar devices after 5-CdS1−xSex sensitization, individual composite photoanodes were studied by EIS measurements through Nyquist plots (Fig. S6†), varying the S/Se molar ratio contained in the ternary alloy. From the EIS parameters displayed in Table S2,† the internal charge carrier transport from the CdS/CdS1−xSex interface to BNF-TNT was improved, avoiding the recombination process for S/Se molar ratio = 1.0. At this point, an adequate band alignment (II-type) was achieved in the CdS/CdS1−xSex heterojunction for an efficient charge carrier separation and transport to the back contact (highest electron lifetime).5,18,54 Conversely, for a S/Se molar ratio < 1.0, a high electron transport resistance was produced mainly at the CdS/CdS1−xSex interface by the formation of an unsuitable I-type band alignment. This promoted carrier recombination into both the CdS and CdS1−xSex sensitizers, decreasing the electron flow through the composite photoanode.5,13,15 Considering the latter, a favored charge carrier flow into the photoanode can facilitate their transport though the external circuit of the cell to reach the cathode, increasing the photocurrent and PCE of the device.
On the other hand, the enhancement of the light harvesting of the photoanodes after ternary alloy sensitization was observed by obtaining the corresponding IPCE spectra (Fig. S7†) of BNF-4-CdS and BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS0.5Se0.5 based materials. The IPCE spectrum of BNF-4-CdS shows a main light-harvesting region between 440 and 530 nm with a peak at 460 nm and an IPCE around 30%. This corresponded to the visible-light absorption ability of CdS.55,56 Nonetheless, the light harvesting of the composite photoanode in the latter range was increased after depositing 5-CdS0.5Se0.5, evidencing an additional light-harvesting region between 550 and 610 nm, with a well-defined peak at 567 nm.5 An IPCE value around 62% was obtained. Here, the ternary alloy sensitizer improved the visible-light harvesting of 4-CdS QD and extended the photoconversion ability to lower energy regions. These measurements are in good agreement with the J–V characteristics curves for the studied materials, where photogenerated electron transport was enhanced due to the II-type heterostructure formed at the 4-CdS/5-CdS0.5Se0.5 interface. The integrated short circuit current estimated from the IPCE curves was 4.96 and 13.4 mA cm−2 for BNF-4-CdS and BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS0.5Se0.5, respectively, closer to the values achieved from the J–V curves.
Similarly for BNF-4-CdS materials, a complex band structure of the BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex composite photoanode was deduced to corroborate the band edge variation to modify the amount of added Se in the ternary alloy (Fig. 7). Here, EVB was achieved by obtaining the normalized XPS VB spectra for BNF-TNT, BNF-4-CdS and BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex composite photoanodes (Fig. S8†), where their corresponding values were estimated through the extrapolation method. EVB values (in the eV scale) were converted to the potential scale (vs. Ag/AgCl, VAg/AgCl) by applying a modified eqn (9):57 VAg/AgCl = ϕ + EVB − Ee − 0.21 V(9)where ϕ is the work function of the analyzer (4.33 eV). On the basis of these results, ECB edges were determined from eqn (6). As seen in Fig. 7, the EVB of 4-CdS was around 0.46VAg/AgCl, which was lower than the value obtained from the electronegativity approach (eqn (5)) around 0.76VAg/AgCl. The difference around 0.3 V between both the latter band edge values was attributed to the estimation method. Eqn (9) considers the Fermi level alignment in the formed heterojunctions, while the former is applied for individual semiconductors and theoretical values are achieved. Nonetheless, the matching tendency at the BNF-TNT/CdS interface is suitable to use both the calculations. This is the main issue in the conduction and valence band edge determination in this kind of system.
 Fig. 7  Band structure of the BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS1−xSex photoanode as a function of the S/Se molar ratio in the ternary alloy, obtained by XPS VB. 
On increasing the Se content in CdS1−xSexECB eventually becomes more positive, decreasing the energy difference with ECB of CdS. Even so, this value is already more negative than that of CdS to promote the electron injection. This corroborates the improvement in the photovoltaic properties of the analyzed materials by band engineering. In addition, a mismatch in the 4-CdS/5-CdSe heterojunction is established, which explains the lowest photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic performance of this composite. According to the latter band structure, the influence of the Se incorporation on the photoconversion ability can be explained by proposing an electron transfer mechanism in a binary/ternary alloy co-sensitizer assembly (Fig. 8). For a S/Se = 2.0, a high energetic difference between the CB edge of CdS and CdS1−xSex is recognized. However, the highest photoactivation energy is required to generate electron–hole pairs.
 Fig. 8  Charge carrier separation and transport mechanism from CdS/CdS1−xSex to BNF-TNT tailoring the band edges of the outer sensitizer by varying the S/Se molar ratio. 
When the Se content reaches a S/Se = 1.0, a balance between carrier photogeneration and their transport to the current collector is established, favouring the highest electron lifetime and the lowest kr. Thus, the highest photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic performances were achieved. In the case of S/Se < 0.5, the lowest Eg is observed. Even so, an unsuitable band structure is generated for electron transport.
Some reports about the beneficial6,9,10,58 or detrimental12,13,54 effect of CdS/CdSe co-sensitization on the photovoltaic performance of QDSSC show disparate views. Here, CdSe generates electrons to be transported to CdS via Cd–Cd energy levels. Even so, CdS can also transfer electrons to the CdSe via the CB. This explains the lowest electron lifetime and the highest kr achieved for BNF-4-CdS-5-CdSe, due to an inhibited charge carrier separation and transport. Furthermore, as was seen in the XPS section, Cd–Cd energy levels were also identified in ternary alloys sensitized materials prepared by SILAR, which can act as recombination centers in the nanoparticle grain boundaries. The latter contributes to the detriment of the overall carrier flow to the back contact. The latter can be considered as one of the main causes to obtain lower PCE values than those reported for ternary alloy sensitized solar cells around 7–11%.1,59,60
On the other hand, SILAR has been reported as one of the most used in situ growth strategies of QDs for the fabrication of QDSSC, as a high QD loading can be deposited on sensitized electrodes, improving the light harvesting of the composite material.3,9,58 However, a full coverage of electrodes by an excess of QDs also shows big disadvantages such as: (1) a broad particle size distribution, (2) the formation of a high amount of grain boundaries48 in the nanoparticle interconnection acting as electron traps and hindering electron mobility61 and (3) the formation of Cd–Cd energy levels in QDs. These factors decrease the charge carrier flow into the solar cells15,19,62 According to our results, we consider that the number of SILAR cycles, the concentration of precursor solutions and the washing process63 during the sensitization process are the origin of the latter limitations: a full coverage by QDs to obtain an efficient light harvester is achieved for both high numbers of SILAR depositions and concentrated cation/anion solutions, generating at the same time more grain boundaries.3,62 On the other hand, some unreacted cations such as Cd2+ can be present on the material surface after washing. In this manner, Cd–Cd energy levels are produced.19 Therefore, it is important to recognize what are the key features that influence directly the PCE to provide upgrades in the photoanode preparation and improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSSC.
4. Conclusions
The preparation of chalcogenide sensitized photoanodes by the SILAR method generates Cd–Cd energy levels in sensitizers, modifying the optical, photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic properties of composites. The amount of these energy levels is varied to change the load of CdS QDs deposited on BNF-TNT, affecting the visible-light absorption and charge carrier transport abilities at the BNF-TNT/CdS/electrolyte interfaces. The highest PCE around 0.79% was achieved in a QDSSC when using the BNF-4-CdS composite, because of a direct carrier transfer between Ti3+ and a suitable Cd–Cd energy state content in the semiconductor. Therefore, the latter energy levels control the carrier transport capability of composites.
Furthermore, the deposition of Se-rich ternary alloys allowed reaching a balance between low-energy light harvesting and adequate band structures at the 4-CdS/5-CdS1−xSex interface, for a S/Se = 1.0. A cascade type-heterojunction promoted carrier mobility from the CdS/CdS1−xSex interface to the BNF-TNT. Therefore, the highest Eoc and τn and the lowest electron recombination rate were obtained. The PCE of BNF-4-CdS-5-CdS0.50Se0.50 under 1 sun conditions was around 2.58%. An excess of Se in the ternary alloy caused a mismatch at the 4-CdS/5-CdS1−xSex interface, declining the photovoltaic performance of QDSSC. Current studies should be focused on investigating about the decrease of the Cd–Cd energy level content, optimizing synthesis conditions during SILAR sensitization, or using other kinds of preparation methods of composites, for instance colloidal QDs and bifunctional linkers, because the “silent” energy states and the formation of grain boundaries impact the overall PCE value of the solar cell.
