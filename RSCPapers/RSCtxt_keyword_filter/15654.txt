1. Introduction
The rapid advance of portable and intelligent electronic devices has spurred an urgent need for the development of new high-performance energy storage materials. Ideally, these new materials would be lightweight, easily processed, mouldable, flexible, and environmentally sustainable.1 These requirements typically cannot be met by traditional battery technologies that use inorganic and metal composites as active materials. For example, the prevalent metal-based batteries such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) rely on using metal oxides as cathodes, which may consist of different transition metal components.2 As such, the ever-increasing consumption of metal-based batteries can be problematic due to the limited availability of rare metals. Moreover, the production of metal-based batteries requires extra energy for mining and metallurgical processing, meanwhile poses end of life problems such as the potential environmental and health impacts – if the batteries are not properly recycled.3 In this scenario, searching for environmentally friendly, inexpensive, and safe electrochemical active materials have been an unremitting pursuit for chemists and material scientists. Utilising organic redox-active compounds as carriers for electrochemical energy storage is naturally one of the prime choices. Organic redox reactions have been the fundamental chemical process in nature, which underpins the foundation and development of synthetic chemistry and its applications in material science. So far, tremendous natural and synthetic organic compounds have been explored in different energy storage systems and electronic devices.4,5 Generally, to afford the redox-active compounds with desired physical, mechanical, and processing properties, the corresponding polymers are produced, and known as redox-active polymers (RAPs).
Batteries and other electronic devices made from RAPs represent a promising and viable solution to the next generation high performance and sustainable technology for energy storage. These RAP materials are processible and can be safely and seamlessly integrated into flexible electronic devices.6 In particular, using polymers to fabricate electrodes could minimise and even eliminate the usage of toxic metals or their compounds in relevant industries. Moreover, because RAPs can be potentially derived from biomass or other natural resources, resource availability is more secure than current metal electrode materials. In this context, the development of energy storage materials with non-hazardous RAPs provides a feasible solution to energy sustainability.4,7
While tremendous RAPs have been developed,5,8,9 polymers consisting of nitroxide radicals have attracted considerable interest owing to their synthetic versatility and excellent physical and electrochemical properties.10–13 So far, nitroxide radical polymers (NRPs) have been widely applied as electrode materials for solid-state batteries,10 supercapacitors,14 and redox flow batteries.15 The emerging applications of NRPs also include as redox mediates in solar cells16 and organic electronics.17 However, overviews of nitroxide radicals and NRPs are often scattered in and partially covered by the review articles about redox-active organic and polymer materials.11,18–22 While recent Viewpoint on macromolecular nitroxide radicals highlighted some critical fundamentals in the field,23 there is lack of such a comprehensive overview specifically summarising current status and future opportunities about nitroxide radicals and NRPs. Therefore, the motivation of this article aims to complement available reviews by summing up the progress of the electrochemical theory and the scope of material design and device fabrication and provide a perspective to the future directions and challenges in the field of energy storage and organic devices.
2. Fundamental electrochemistry of nitroxide radicals
Nitroxide radicals are a class of stable radicals with an unpaired electron delocalised on the N–O bond. The absence of α-H further prevents the disproportionation and thus provides stability.24 Depending on the structures, nitroxide radicals may undergo a reversible electrochemical redox reaction.25 When oxidised, nitroxide radicals lose one electron and become oxoammonium cations that are usually stable in ambient condition, forming a redox couple of NO˙/N+O. Whereas the reduction reaction by gaining one electron converts neutral radicals to aminoxyl anions. The corresponding redox couple NO−/NO˙ is often irreversible since the aminoxyl anion (NO−) is prone to couple with a proton (i.e., in water or organic solvent containing a trace of water) to form hydroxylamine, and the latter requires a much higher potential to be reoxidised back to the radical (NO˙) as depicted in Scheme 1. In principle, chemical structures of nitroxide radicals and redox reaction conditions25–27 play a significant role in their redox potentials and reaction reversibility, which then dictate different application scenarios. Moreover, nitroxide radicals are often immobilised to a polymer backbone to form redox-active NRPs, affording the materials with processability and mechanical properties. In these cases, the chemical and physical properties of polymers can dramatically affect the redox properties, which are elaborated through this review.

2.1. Structural effects on the redox behaviour of nitroxide radicals
To date, many different nitroxide structures and their derivatives have been successfully synthesized,28 in which the major structures include (a) 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO),29 (b) 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidin-1-oxyl (PROXYL) or unsaturated PROXYL,29 (c) 1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-oxyl(sideline) (TMIO),30,31 (d) 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-oxyl (TMAO),30 (e) phthalimide N-ox (PINO),32 (f) 4-(N-tert-butyl-N-oxylamino)benzene (TBNO),33 (g) 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane N-oxeye (ABNO),34 and (h) nitronylnitroxide (NINO)35 as shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Different types of nitroxide radicals. 
These nitroxide radicals have the same redox centre (i.e., NO˙) but very different redox properties due to their distinctly different structures. Using standard ab initio molecular orbital and density functional calculation, Coote and co-workers36 developed a prediction on redox potentials and reversibility for both oxidation (i.e., NO˙/N+O) and reduction (i.e., NO−/NO˙) reaction couples for over 50 cyclic nitroxide radicals. It was found that, in general, the increasing order of the oxidation potentials for unsubstituted nitroxide radicals was TMAO < TEMPO ≈ PROXYL < TMIO. Whereas the order of the reduction potentials was not exactly the reverse of the oxidation one, it became more negative with TMAO > TEMPO > TMIO > PROXYL. The different trend for the oxidation and reduction potentials of these nitroxide structures seems to be related to the flexibility of the ring structure, that is, to which extent it can adapt to the changes in the bond length and bond angle after the redox reactions. Experimentally, these structures have been synthesised, and their redox potentials have been examined as listed in Scheme 3 and Table 1. The electronic structure effect on the redox potential provides access to different application scenario of nitroxide radicals through design and modification of diverse nitroxide radical structures.

In terms of the redox kinetics, Marcus–Hush theory44 is often used, and such a one-electron redox process of a nitroxide radical with the molecular weight of M can be related to the activation energy, ΔG‡. Therefore, the heterogeneous rate constant, k0, is expressed by eqn (1):45 k0 = (RT/2πM)1/2 exp[−ΔG‡/RT](1)
The intrinsic energy barrier ΔG‡0 is a combination of the inner reorganisation energy (λi) and the outer (or solvent) reorganisation energy (λo), eqn (2). (2)
Conti et al.45 performed a calculation on TEMPO and revealed that the oxidation reaction couple NO˙/N+O involves much smaller conformational changes than the reduction NO−/NO˙. While the λo contributes 50–60% to the total activation energy, it was found that λi for the reduction reaction of TEMPO (∼80 ± 10 kJ mol−1) was much higher than the oxidation one (∼32 ± 4 kJ mol−1). This higher energy barrier for the reduction reaction leads to sluggish kinetics for NO−/NO˙ couple, which often cannot be experimentally observed. Interestingly, introducing a bulky fullerene group to the TEMPO reduced the outer (or solvent) reorganisation energy (λo) drastically to less than one-third of that in primitive TEMPO. In turn, a pair of reversible reduction peak (TEMPO−/TEMPO) was observed.45 This work provides valuable clues that a judicious design of nitroxide radical structures can significantly lower the activation energy barrier and realise a reversible reduction reaction.
In addition to the ring structure, substitutions and heteroatoms on cyclic nitroxide radicals can also alter redox potentials through changing the flexibility of nitroxide rings and the electron distribution along with the N–O bond. The computation37,38 has shown that the oxidation potentials increase with the increase of electron-withdrawing ability. Whereas the reduction potentials showed a reverse trend, it became more negative with the increase of electron-donating ability. Bottle and co-workers30 synthesised and tested a series of TMIO and TMAO derivatives with different substituents. In a typical example, Nishide and co-workers33 synthesised a few of TBNO with different para-substituted on the phenyl ring. By switching the functional groups from a strong electron-donating CH3O− group to a strong electron-withdrawing CF3− group, the electrochemical redox behaviour of TBNO changed drastically from a reversible oxidation reaction (NO˙/N+O) to a reversible reduction (N–O−/NO˙) one. Furthermore, through modification of TEMPO and PROXYL radicals with different functionalities, Jia and Coote38 recently evidenced the substitution and heteroatom effect on the oxidation potentials and correlated them to the charge-dipole interaction between the substituents and the oxoammonium. In this case, misalignment of substituent dipole and the oxoammonium cation increased the oxidation potential for NO˙/N+O. Whereas the alignment of the substituent dipole and the charge stabilised the oxoammonium cation and lowered the oxidation potential as illustrated in Fig. 1.38 Moreover, Hammett constants of those functional substituents were adopted to correlate with the experimental oxidation potentials for TEMPO derivatives. A linear relationship was observed, suggesting that the inductive effect is significant even though the substitutions are on an aliphatic ring system. These theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the chemical modification is a powerful means to tune the redox behaviour of nitroxides radicals, providing excellent opportunities to design materials for different applications including catalysis,46,47 superoxide dismutase mimics48 and energy storage.49

2.2. Solvent effect on the redox behaviour of nitroxide radicals
Often the reversibility of electrochemical redox reactions of nitroxide radicals depends on the electrolyte systems. For TEMPO, PROXYL, TMIO, TMAO and their derivatives, the oxidation couple (NO˙/N+O) is reversible in both aqueous solution and a variety of organic solvents. Moreover, for a given nitroxide structure, the oxidation potential is relatively constant in different media. However, due to a sluggish reduction reaction kinetics, the reduction peak of the nitroxide radical is flattened compared to the oxidation one and even not observed in many cases.50 As aforementioned, the reduction product, aminoxyl anion, is prone to couple with a proton to form hydroxylamine, which requires a relatively high potential to reoxidise to a neutral radical.24 Therefore, the redox potential and reversibility for reduction reaction couple (NO−/NO˙) strongly depends on the redox reaction media. Taking TEMPO as an example, Tokito and co-workers51 recently realised a reversible two-electron redox of TEMPO when using ionic liquids as electrolytes. A further study on the mechanism is on-going. In aqueous solution, the redox reaction of TEMPO strongly depends on the pH values of the solution.26 Together with the inherent disproportionation and comproportionation reactions, the electrochemical process of between TEMPO and its redox products are rather complicated (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Acid–base equilibria of TEMPOH and the rate constants of the comproportionation reaction for the different forms of TEMPOH with TEMPO+.24,52 Copyright 2005 Elsevier; Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society. 
A reversible oxidation reaction (i.e., TEMPO/TEMPO+) is always achieved under a wide range of pH values (pH 2 to 12).25 However, TEMPO+ can be attacked by hydroxide ion to form electrochemically inert hydroxylamine N-oxide, i.e. TEMP(OH)O at pH above 12. Whereas the reduction of a TEMPO always couples with a protonation reaction and forms hydroxylamine (i.e., TEMPOH). The reoxidation of TEMPOH to TEMPO requires a very high potential, however, can vary drastically upon the change of pH of the solution. It can be seen in Fig. 2 that both peak anodic potential (Epa) and peak cathodic potential (Epc) shifted to lower potentials, and the decrease of peak-to-peak distance upon the increase of pH value indicated favourable kinetics and thermodynamics for the reduction of TEMPO at a more basic condition.26 The relationship between the calculated half-wave potentials, Ered1/2, and the pH has been well studied by Kato26 and Samuni,52 respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 2, in an acidic solution (i.e. pH = 2.5), TEMPO disproportionates into TEMPO+ and TEMPOH2+ thus the reoxidation reaction from TEMPOH2+ to TEMPO is corresponding to a 1 e−/2H+ process. When the solution is basic and above the pKa of TEMPOH2+ (i.e., pH = 10.2), the reoxidation from TEMPOH to TEMPO is corresponding to a 1 e−/1H+ process. Theoretically, above the pKa of TEMPOH (i.e., pH > 13.7), the reoxidation should be directly from TEMPO− to TEMPO. Stahl established a more comprehensive understanding of this process in the form of a Pourbaix diagram.40

In addition to the inherent structural and external solvent effect, it is also found that the working electrodes could play some interesting role in the reduction of nitroxide radicals. Gerken et al.40 showed an oxidised glass carbon electrode could trigger the reversible reduction couple TEMPO−/TEMPO in a basic solution, which was not observed with untreated glass carbon electrode. It was proposed that the oxidised carbon (i.e. quinone structure) may promote the proton-transfer and realise the reoxidation of TEMPOH.53 The similar phenomenon was also observed in a coin cell system when different carbon additives were used.50 For example, a few groups reported a possible reduction of TEMPO when reduced graphene oxide was added to form the composites.54 Different carbon additives appear to play very different roles when TEMPO-containing materials were used as cathodes.50 Since the redox reaction for TEMPO in a battery system involves polymer/carbon composite preparation, electrolyte selection and battery fabrication, and such effects are discussed later.
3. Charge storage and transport in NRPs
NRPs show very different electrochemical behaviours compared to their small molecule counterparts, in which the chemical and physical properties of polymer backbones play a significant role in the redox reaction and charge transport process. Although the applications of NRPs in both energy storage and organic devices rely on the electron transfer between the large population of pendent radicals, there is some distinctive difference between so-called ‘dry-type’ and ‘wet-type’ devices.55 In ‘dry-type’ devices, such as organic memories, diodes, switches and solar cells, charge transport in solid-state NRPs is driven by the electric field and the NRPs act as an electric conductor. Whereas in ‘wet-type’ devices, the redox-triggered charge storage requires the support of liquid electrolyte, represented by rechargeable polymer batteries.
3.1. Electrical conductivity of NRPs
Organic semiconducting polymers have been investigated extensively in the emerging field of solid-state organic electronic devices (e.g. organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices), organic diodes, and transistor.56,57 Most of these polymers are referred to polymers with π conjugated backbone. The delocalised π-electrons act as charge carriers to transfer electrons or holes along the polymer backbone. Despite their excellent electrical conductivity, some inherent issues such as synthetic complexity and poor processability of conjugated polymers still hinder their practical applications. Firstly, the metal-based catalyst used for polymerisation poses the difficulty to separate them from final products. These metal impurities are detrimental to the performance of electronic devices.58 Second, charge transport in conjugated polymers is highly dependent on the chemical doping and crystalline domains. Third, conjugated polymers are usually brittle and opaque, which can be problematic in both processing and many application scenes. Conversely, nonconjugated NRPs are synthetically easy, structurally amorphous, highly processible, transparent, and thus attracting increasing interest. Particularly, the charge transport process solely depends on the redox-led charge hopping. Basically, the applied external electric field promotes the injection of a charge (i.e. a hole) onto the NRP polymer chain, in which the charge further transports throughout the polymer layer via a relay manner.59,60
Over the past years, the Boudouris group59–63 have established characterisation methods and elaborated fundamentals for the solid-state conductivity of NRPs. The solid-state charge mobility was quantified through a simple three-layered device comprising of ITO/PTMA/Al (PTMA:poly(TEMPO-methacrylate)). It is assumed that, by applying a high voltage, the electron or hole diffusion has negligible contribution to the current. In this case, the carrier mobility (μ) can be derived from Mott–Gurney equation through analysing the current density–voltage (J–V) profile (eqn (3)):60 (3)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, ε is the dielectric constant of the material, L is the thickness of the semiconducting layer, and V is the applied voltage. The measured hole mobility was about 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was comparable with common conjugated semiconducting polymers (i.e. poly (3-alkyl thiophene)s (P3ATs)). In turn, the electrical conductivity of this amorphous PTMA increased with the increasing of the conversion from piperidine precursors to nitroxide radicals. Notably, when using m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) as an oxidant, the over-oxidation of nitroxides to corresponding oxoammonium salts led to a decrease of the electrical conductivity. The same group confirmed this phenomenon in a later study, in which a preoxidised TEMPO+ was added.62 At a dose of up to 8%, the conductivity increases drastically due to the TEMPO+ acting as a bridge and accelerating the charge transfer. Further increasing the loading diminished the conductivity because the mixture of pendent TEMPO and TEMPO+ was detrimental to the film formation.
While the glass transition temperature (Tg) of NRPs can significantly affect the film formation and consequently the electrical conductivity, Boudouris and co-workers63 utilised a poly(4-glycidyl-TEMPO) (PGTEMPO) which possessed a much lower Tg (i.e., 20 °C) comparing with poly(TEMPO methacrylate) (PTMA) (i.e., 170 °C). PGTEMPO was synthesised through anionic polymerisation, which can maximise the radical content. The polyether backbone afforded the polymer with excellent flexibility and crystallinity, which allowed the thermal annealing at 80 °C to form crystalline domains without concern on the degradation of nitroxide radicals. Such domains were percolation networks of nitroxide radicals which drastically promoted electronic communications (Fig. 3). A breakthrough conductivity of about 10 S m−1 was recorded, representing radical progress in conductive polymer glass.64

Even though the conductivity decreased dramatically beyond the size of the crystallised domain, it is a remarkable advance for solid-state electrical conductivity from nonconjugated NRPs. Indeed, this seminal research demonstrates the importance and power of polymer design and synthesis in achieving breakthrough electrical properties of amorphous NRPs and the performance of the electronic devices thereof.
3.2. Charge storage of NRPs
Different to the electrical conduction, charge storage in NRPs requires redox reactions taking place on all nitroxide groups in order to provide maximal charge storage capability. The electron transfer and storage in NRPs can be characterised by a series of established electrochemical theories and techniques.65 Typically, in a charging process, the oxidation of nitroxide groups is initiated by applying a positive external potential on the polymer layer, during which electrons are transported across the interface between the current collector and radical moieties, resulting in a layer of oxoammonium cations.66 This is considered as heterogeneous electron transfer process with rate constant denoted as k0 (cm s−1). Consequently, electrons on the nitroxide radicals away from the current collector transfer to their neighbour oxoammonium species through an outer-sphere self-exchange reaction (Fig. 4). The electron transfer between the radicals and the oxoammonium cations is considered as a homogeneous electron transfer (or self-exchange) process with the rate constant denoted as kex (M−1 s−1).55 The potential drives a successive oxidation propagation and electrons seem to diffuse throughout the polymer layer with an apparent diffusion coefficient denoted as Dapp (cm2 s−1), reaching a full electrolysis. Since the electron hopping efficiency strongly depends on the site distance (δ), a high concentration of radicals (C0) in a polymer matrix is critical to a fast charge diffusion.67
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of the redox reaction of NRPs, in which M stands for nitroxide radical and M+ stands for oxoammonium cation.68 Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society. 
Experimentally, the diffusion coefficient Dapp is determined by combining chronopotentiometry (CA) with the Cottrell plots as described by eqn (4). (4)where i is current, A is the electrode surface area, and C0 is the bulky concentration of nitroxides in the swollen polymers. Dapp in NRPs is in the range of 10−10 cm2 s−1. kex is, therefore, can be derived from Dahms–Ruff equation (eqn (5)): (5)where δ is the separation between the nitroxide groups. For most of nitroxide polymer structures, the values of kex are typically around 105 M−1 s−1. Molecular dynamic simulations of PTMA suggested that the conformation of polymer chains greatly influenced the separation between TEMPO moieties and thus the kex. The results indicated that the effective electron self-exchange between TEMPO groups from different polymer chains should have a δ below 7 Å.69 Therefore, the swelling of polymers that leads to further separation of radicals should be considered in these courses.
Whereas k0 can be determined through a range of different electrochemical techniques. A combination of cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the Nicholson method is often used. k0 can be derived from Nicholson equation (eqn (6)):70 k0 = Ψ[πDappνF/(RT)]0.5(6)where F is faradaic constant, Ψ is dependent of scan rate ν (V s−1) when the redox reaction is quasi-reversible, and it is determined by the peak separation (ΔEp = Ecp − Eap) from the CV curve. Additionally, k0 can also be determined through voltammetry by using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in the solution. Levich plot of RDE voltammogram results in Dapp through Levich equation (eqn (7)): (7)where ilim is limiting current and ω is rotation speed. Application of the Koutecky–Levich equation 1/i = 1/ik + 1/ilim results in the kinetic current ik which is then applied into the Butler–Volmer equation via a Tafel plot. The fitting would allow to determine the exchange current i0 and subsequently k0 through eqn (8).15 i0 = FAk0C0(8)
When a TEMPO-containing nitroxide polymer with cationic groups was tested in water, k0 with a value of 4 × 10−4 cm s−1 is recorded.15 The measured kex and k0 values for NRPs are 102−4 times smaller than those for small nitroxide radicals in solution,71 suggesting a slower diffusion rate for TEMPO radicals attached to the polymer chain than free ones.
However, using the classic Marcus–Hush bimolecular electron transfer theory to predict the bimolecular rate constant for NRPs seems inappropriate, since the calculated rate constants would be 108 times smaller than the experimental values. The redox-driven charge transfer kinetics is greatly changed after the nitroxides are immobilised to a polymer backbone, thereby the physical diffusion of polymer chain segments and Brownian movement of pendent nitroxide groups must be non-negligible cardinal factors and have to be included for further understanding of the process. To this end, Nishide and Oyaizu68 proposed a diffusion-cooperative model to predict charge transport more accurately in the presence of electrolytes. In consideration of hard-sphere collisions and the diffusion-limited process, k0 for NRPs is expressed by eqn (9). (9)where, κel is electron transmission coefficient (∼1); L is mean free distance (=0.3 nm), λ is the reorganisation energy, and kB is Boltzmann constant. Dphys is the physical diffusion coefficient of nitroxide groups, which is related to physical diffusion constant kdiff by eqn (10): (10)
The apparent self-exchange rate constant (kex,app) is dominated by the physical diffusion constant kdiff, because of kdiff ≪ kex (=3 × 10−8 M−1 s−1). Finally, Dphys can be determined either by dynamic light scattering (DLS) or using the entangled polymer model by de Gennes (Dphys ∝ C−βE; β, exponential factor β = 1.75).
This model enables researchers to predict charge transportability of a range of NRPs accurately. For a better comparison, the electron transfer rate constants of some typical NRPs (Scheme 5) and a few small nitroxide radicals (from Scheme 3) were listed in Table 2. It can be seen that electron transfer kinetics for NRPs were close to those calculated values but slower (i.e. 103–104 times) than that of small nitroxide radicals due to the much slower diffusion of the polymer chains.72 Most of the experimental data agreed with the prediction, suggesting the practical validity of the model. However, this model still suffers from some limitations. A good example was a TEMPO-substituted polyacrylamide, which showed that the experimental rate constant was only 1/10 of the predicted value. The reason behind was that the hydrophilic polyacrylamide was poorly swelled in acetonitrile (solvent for electrolyte), leading to a much slower migration of counterions.68 Apart from not taking the swelling ratio into account, the model also ignored the linker effect between the pendant nitroxide radicals and the polymer backbone. The linker could have a significant contribution to a few terms in eqn (9) as the flexibility of the linker could restrict the movement of the nitroxide group, alter the Tg and hence the physical diffusion of the chain segment in NRPs. Moreover, the restriction from the linker may also alter the reorganisation energy (λ) for both oxidation and reduction couples of NRPs as evidenced previously.45 A careful study, however, is required to prove this assumption in a polymer system, particularly in combination with ab initio calculation and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation.

3.3. Ion Diffusion in NRPs
The redox process has to be simultaneously accompanied by ion diffusion to maintain the overall electroneutrality.73–75 Regardless of the recent remarkable development of electron transfer mechanism, the ion diffusion and doping in NRPs are much less understood. In a ‘wet-type’ device before redox reactions, the NRP cathode is swollen by solvent molecules with electrolyte salts. The oxidation of NO˙ to the corresponding N+O leads to either the uptake of anions or the ejection of cations. Conversely, the reduction of N+O back to NO˙ expels anions or attracts cations. However, it has to be clear that ion diffusion in NRPs is a rather complex event, which is determined by the swelling ability of polymers in different solvents, disassociation constants and mobility of electrolyte salts, as well as the binding energy of counterions with polymer backbone and redox products. An earlier work by Nishide and co-workers66 revealed that the ratio between electrolyte salts and nitroxide radicals dictated the self-exchange rate constant between nitroxide groups. Taking PTMA swelled by LiPF6 in propyl carbonate (PC) as an example, decreasing the [LiPF6]/[TEMPO] ratio from 1.7 to 1.0, then to 0.5 results in an increasing of kex from 0.16 to 1.4 then to 2.8 (×10−6 M−1 s−1) and a decrease of activation energy Ea from 42 to 26 then to 18 kJ mol−1, respectively. It seems that the high concentration of electrolyte salts decreases the ion mobility in swollen polymers. While using different types of electrolyte salts, it is found that anions have greater impacts on charge transport than cations. Later, the same group developed a couple of nitroxide radical copolymers consisting of either sulfonate,74,76 imidazolium77,78 or TFSI (trifluoromethanesulfonylimide) lithium salt75 as cathodes. During the redox reaction, the neighbour anions on the polymer chains provide the immediate charge balance to oxoammonium salts, and there was the Li+ migration in/out of the electrode as evidenced by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (eQCM).66,75
An MD simulation by Larsen and co-workers79 found the binding energy between electrolyte anions and TEMPO+ species significantly influenced the reduction efficiency of TEMPO+ back to TEMPO. The strong complexation of TEMPO+/anion prevented charge transfer to TEMPO+. However, these studies remain at a qualitative level, and more plausible and direct evidence is to be presented. In 2019, Lutkenhaus and co-workers80 reported a real-time and quantitative measurement of ion diffusion during the electrochemical redox reaction of PTMA in different lithium salt electrolytes by using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (eQCM-D) in combining with CV at different scan rates. Three possible diffusion ways of electrolyte salts have been proposed as depicted in Fig. 5. It was found, at the low scan rate (i.e., 10 mV s−1), the oxidation of TEMPO groups forming TEMPO+ moieties associated with major Li+ ions expulsion (77.12%) and minor anion uptake (22.88%). While increasing the scan rate to 100 mV s−1 it resulted in a large amount of anion uptake (81.73%). This is attributed to the different disassociation rates of salts in the bulk electrolyte and swollen one in polymers, which the former is believed to be much faster than the latter. Another interesting finding from this work by using eQCM-D was that a significant amount of electrolyte solvent (i.e., PC) was taken and expelled during the redox process, especially at a low salt concentration (i.e. 0.01 M LiCF3SO3). This result indicated that the molar ratio of PC to LiCF3SO3 can drastically affect the solvation of LiCF3SO3, which at low concentration separated ions were associated with PC molecules, and together they were imbibed into the electrode layer. However, this was not the case for the high salt concentration. So far, theoretical calculations together with experimental results have provided great insights into the ion diffusion mechanism and kinetics during the electrochemical redox reaction of NRPs. Particularly, applying eCQM-D in the redox process enables a real-time quantification of mass transport and has been further proved the validity even in a conjugated NRP,81 a remarkable advance in the field. Certainly, the role of electrolytes and salts in NRPs and other redox polymers is yet fully understood, especially in a real NRP battery.

4. Design of nitroxide polymer electrodes
The past two decades have witnessed the birth and rapid advance in NRPs for energy storage applications. Batteries made of these materials present remarkable features including fast charging and long cycling life due to the superior redox reaction of nitroxide groups along the backbone of the polymer. The nonconjugated and amorphous structures afford the corresponding electrodes with excellent processing capability and mechanical properties.82 While this class of materials offer so many advantages; they suffer from issues such as low intrinsic conductivity and dissolution in organic electrolytes in the ‘wet-type’ devices.8,19 So far, multiple strategies have been developed from different aspects to improve the electrochemical performance of NRP electrodes, which in some cases the practical capacity of NRPs have approached to that of currently used inorganic materials.8
4.1. Structure design of NRPs
Studies on the redox behaviours of small molecular nitroxides71 provide underpinned knowledge towards their applications in organic energy storage. However, these nitroxides are hardly used to fabricate electrodes directly due to the high solubility in many organic electrolytes. Hence, the most common approach to overcome this issue is to immobilise them onto a polymer backbone, thereby reducing the solubility.83 Thanks to powerful organic and polymer chemistries that furnish synthetic flexibility, tremendous NRP structures have been prepared to optimise electrochemical properties through tuning their chemical compositions and macromolecular architectures.54,84–93 No need to implement tedious synthetic processes, many different NRPs can be generated using reversible deactivation radical polymerisation techniques including atom-transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP),85,94,95 single-electron transfer living radical polymerisation (SET-LRP),96–98 reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerisation (RAFT),99 or other methods such as anionic polymerization,86,90,100 olefin metathesis polymerisation,100,101 and group transfer polymerization,102 most of which have been covered by a recent book chapter.103 These polymerisation techniques generate NRPs with desired molecular weights and narrow dispersities (Đ ≤ 1.35). It is noteworthy that different polymerisation techniques have their pros and cons in terms of the synthetic complexity and radical densities that resulted in NRPs.11
In most cases, the theoretical voltage of NRP-based batteries can be predicted by the redox potentials of the small nitroxide counterparts and the potentials of the anodes. Exceptionally, it was reported that the tacticity of the PTMA generated by group transfer polymerisation could influence the electrochemical reactivity of pendent TEMPO groups.102 The pendent TEMPO groups with isotactic conformation showed similar redox potential as the small molecular monomer. Whereas an irreversible oxidation peak with much higher potential was also observed, of which the proportion of electron transfer was consistent with the percentage of the hetero/syndiotactic conformation in the whole polymer chain. The results could be partially explained by the molecular dynamic simulation of electron transfer in PTMA as reported by Kemple et al.69 Significantly, the conformation of nitroxide side groups on polymer chains can alter the distance and the direction of two radical centres. Therefore, the activation energy for the redox reaction depends on the stereoregularity of the polymers, which in turn dictates the redox potentials. To achieve a higher reversible redox potential, researchers have developed tremendous NRPs with different radical structures. For instance, Blinco and co-workers49 reported a TMIO-based NRPs that can deliver a potential of 3.7 V vs. Li/Li+, a 0.1 V increase than the TEMPO-containing NRPs (Fig. 6).

In terms of capacity, it is rather different when nitroxide radicals are converted to their polymer analogues. When nitroxide radicals are converted to monomers, the molecular weight per redox-active centre, M, is increased, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical capacity (Ctheo.) according to the eqn (11): (11)

C
theo. is often affected by the polymerisation techniques used. In general, radical polymerisation techniques can only be used to synthesise NRP precursors, which require a post-polymerisation oxidation to convert them to NRPs. The oxidation efficiency determines the radical densities in final NRPs, hence the Ctheo. Polymerisation methods that are compatible with nitroxide radicals can be applied for the synthesis of NRPs from monomers with radicals. In these cases, a high radical density is usually achieved. Fig. 7 illustrated some of the reported TEMPO-containing NRPs and the corresponding Ctheo.. A nearly 30% difference can be seen between different polymer backbones. For example, the cathode made of PTMA82-b-PS59 (PS for polystyrene) self-assembled micelles has been fabricated for LIB.104 Due to the significant amount of electrochemically inactive PS component, the Ctheo. was as low as 24 mA h g−1 and the initial discharge capacity was only 15 mA h g−1, which attracts little interest as energy storage materials. This extreme example suggests that reaching a maximum Ctheo. would be the priority when designing a new NRP electrode.

Although NRPs have shown significant success in organic and polymer electrodes, for a long time, gradual dissolution of some low molecular weight fractions into electrolytes is one of the major reasons for poor cycling stability. A recent work by Jia and co-workers97 demonstrated the molecular weight dependent solubility of oft-used PTMA in common electrolytes and its impact on the delivered capacities and cyclability. The polymer with Mn of 176 KDa showed stable discharge capacities over 400 cycles, while polymers with lower Mn displayed the decreasing capacities over cycles. So far, many strategies have been developed to prevent the dissolution, including crosslinking, covalent immobilisation, and encapsulation. There are generally two approaches for the synthesis of crosslinked NRP gels: (i) post-polymerisation crosslinking,96,105 and (ii) in situ gelation during the polymerisation.106–108 For instance, Nishide and co-workers82 reported the photocrosslinking of TEMPO-containing polynorbornenes by adding a bisarylazide or using coumarin residues. This method demonstrated the possibility to store the energy in a pure nitroxide polymer film, but only produced the active polymer layer with thickness less than micron level. Alternatively, an epoxy functional monomer has been incorporated to PTMA and followed by a thermal crosslinking either during the inkjet printing82 or on a preformed thin-film.109 This technique could be applied to fabricate patterned microbatteries. Nishide also reported the in situ gelation during the polymerisation in the presence of crosslinkers through either Michael-addition110 or anionic polymerisation.107 Very recently, Jia108 reported the synthesis of PGTEMPO gels through a non-covalently physical crosslinking via a π–π stacking interaction (Fig. 8). These methods are friendly to nitroxides and maintain theoretical capacities as the design. In addition, copper catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) was applied for the crosslinking reaction, but post-oxidation of piperidine gels led to incomplete oxidation and thus lowed Ctheo. (Fig. 9).96 More importantly, without carbon additives, the diffusion-limited charge transport of the NRP gel electrode was only effective in the range from 10 nm to 260 nm.55 When carbon additives were used, the thickness of the electrodes can be above micrometres. However, the specific capacities dropped from 110 mA h g−1 to 55 mA h g−1 when the thickness increased from 17 μm to 64 μm, suggesting a higher interfacial resistance preventing efficient charge diffusion.111 Therefore, dispersion of NRPs in carbon additives at nanoscale could be critically important for better electrochemical performance.

Several designs were made to improve the swellability of NRPs in different electrolytes by implementing different polymer backbone. By replacing the polymethacrylate backbone of PTMA to poly(ethylene glycol) backbone (i.e. PGTEMPO), the polymers demonstrated an improved ion transport by enabling sufficient swelling in an organic electrolyte (Fig. 10).86,107 For instance, PGTEMPO gel allowed to fabricate electrode with only 10 wt% of carbon nanotubes, but afford good rate capability, thereby delivering 80% of theoretical capacity at 10C with 90% of polymer loading content (where x C rate is defined as the current density at which the full charging or discharging in 1/x h).107 This result highlights the function of the polymer backbone in corresponding battery performance. Moreover, hydrophilic polyacrylamide and poly(vinyl ether) backbones furnished corresponding TEMPO-substituted polymers with sufficiently water swellability but remained water-insoluble, which is ideally used as cathodes for aqueous electrolyte rechargeable batteries.112–115 Recent work by Lutkenhaus studied the interaction parameters between NRPs and a series of commonly used electrolyte solvents.116 The determined Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters provide handy information for the selection of solvents in both electrode fabrication and the battery assembly.

Apart from chemical compositions, physical architecture can also dictate the electrochemical properties. Oyaizu, Nishide and co-workers100 reported a bottlebrush NRP through a successive anionic and ring-opening metathesis polymerisation. This nanoscale structure demonstrated excellent rate performance (i.e. the same discharge capacity from 10 to 120C) due to the high density of nitroxide groups with the bottlebrush structure (Fig. 11). This work suggests the importance of the structure design towards improved electrochemical properties.

Since most of NRPs are electrically insulated, intuitively, one would think to increase the conductivity by introducing a conductive polymer backbone, usually conjugated polymers.117 Accompanying with the development of nonconjugated NRP electrodes, conjugated NRPs have been continuously synthesised and tested as cathodes. So far, NRPs with poly(acetylene),101,118–120 poly(pyrrole),121–124 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxylthiophene)125 and poly (thiophene)95,126,127 as backbones have been designed and synthesized. Unfortunately, there was very little success in efforts to improve energy storage performance, and often the discharge capacities and cycling stability were even worse than the nonconjugated NRPs. Until recently, Lutkenhaus and co-workers124,128 first proposed that an internal electron transfer (IET) may take place between nitroxide moieties and conjugated polythiophene backbone, which complicated redox electron transfer and storage of conjugated NRPs (Fig. 12). This IET led to oxidation of polythiophene and a potential drop of the corresponding battery.

Later, Jia and co-workers129 further investigated this system and proposed that the different redox kinetics between nitroxide radicals and polyacetylene backbone can significantly affect the coulombic efficiency, resulting from the side reactions between radicals and backbone (Fig. 13). For instance, when conjugated NRPs were charged at low current densities, both nitroxide radicals and conjugated backbone were oxidised to oxoammonium cations and a polaron, respectively. The carbon-centred radical on the backbone can simultaneously undergo two side reactions: (1) reduce the oxoammonium cation back to nitroxide radicals through IET. (2) Rapidly couple with nitroxide radicals to form an inert alkoxyamine bond (Redox process II). However, when the electrode was subjected a fast charge and discharge (i.e. high C-rate) at a narrow potential window, IET can be minimised, and a high coulombic efficiency was achieved (Redox process I).129 Moreover, due to the irreversible redox of polyacetylene backbone, the initial low coulombic efficiency can be recovered to nearly 100% after the conjugated polyacetylene was mostly oxidised. However, this may result in the degradation of polymers after cycling.127 In a word, due to the unmatched redox potentials and kinetics, unavoidable IET and possible side reactions, conjugated NRPs may not be promising in energy storage applications.

Covalent organic framework (COF) is an emerging class of porous materials with highly ordered organic building blocks. Such lightweight, and template free 2D or 3D polymeric frameworks store electric energy through ordered π-columns and open nanochannels. Generally, COF is not redox-active, thereby only suitable for the application in capacitors. Incorporation of nitroxide functionalities into 2D COF130,131 can add extra faradaic energy storage to it and be applicable as a supercapacitor. Jiang and co-workers130 first demonstrated this idea by post-modification of alkyne functional amine-aldehyde COF with azide functional TEMPO through CuAAC coupling reaction (Fig. 14a). The resulted TEMPO-COF demonstrated as a supercapacitor energy storage exhibiting a capacitance of 113 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. This high rate performance was attributed to the excellent ion transport through the porous COF structures. The similar structure was later used to produce exfoliated few-layered TEMPO-COF and applied as cathode materials for LIBs (Fig. 14b).131 Interestingly, a two-stage charge/discharge plateau was observed, but no further explanation was provided. As extensively discussed earlier in this paper, we believe that the less flexibility for TEMPO moieties on COF comparing to those on conventional polymers may reduce the outer reorganisation energy, decrease the overall activation energy, and enable the reduction reaction couple (i.e. TEMPO˙/TEMPO−). Efficient ion diffusion certainly promotes this process since the reduction reaction involves diffusion of Li+ ions. Noticeably, this two-electron storage can only provide a discharge capacity of less than 100 mA h g−1, which is apparently due to the much higher molar mass per TEMPO radical, thus the low Ctheo.. It is high desirable that further studies in this area could design new organic linkers and enables high nitroxide loading, by which the COF strategy may pave new access for high performance organic energy storage.

4.2. Conductive additives in NRP composite electrodes
Since the conductivity of NRPs is far below the requirement when used as electrodes for energy storage. As such, conductive additives are always added to NRPs to afford electrode composites with better conductivity. Common conductive additives include graphite, carbon black Super P®,97,132 acetylene black,133 vapour-grown carbon fibres (VGCF),134 and Ketjenblack (KB).50 For a very long time, these carbon materials are added at a relatively high percentage (∼50–80 wt%).75,97,134,135 However, little was understood on how the morphologies of these carbons dictate the electron transfer of NRPs. Lemmon and co-workers50 first compared the electrochemical performance of KB carbon and SP carbon as additives to PTMA cathode in LIBs. Interestingly, the electrode with KB carbon showed much higher (i.e. >250 mA h g−1) discharge capacity than that of SP carbon (i.e. 40–100 mA h−1). Morphological characterisation of carbons and their PTMA composites demonstrated the much larger surface area for KB (i.e. 1478 m2 g−1) than SP (i.e. 68 m2 g−1). The former may allow PTMA to penetrate into porous carbon and provide better conductivity to the composite, thereby facilitating the highly efficient electron transfer and even enabling two-electron energy storage. Notably, the strong capacitive effect of KB than SP also contributed to the overall high capacity. This capacitive effect was also found when fabricating a PTMA-based supercapacitor by adding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active carbon with ultra-high surface area (2000 m2 g−1), in which PTMA and active carbon contribute equally to the total capacity.14
Physically blending of carbon additives with NRPs often causes significant polymer segregation during the electrode preparation due to the high surface energy.136,137 Therefore, a large mass of carbon materials is needed, in turn, reducing the active polymer content. With deep insights into the mechanism and importance of creating strong interaction between carbons and NRPs, tremendous efforts have been steered to circumvent this issue and improve their interactions. During this course, nanostructured carbons such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are the oft-used nanocarbon materials, which were usually modified with NRPs through covalent bonding,138 non-covalent π–π interaction,139 π-cation interaction, electrostatic interaction,140 and encapsulation.141
Diverse organic reactions have enabled the chemical modification of NRPs onto CNTs and rGO. NRP-grafted CNTs and rGO can be achieved through either “grafting from” such as surface-initiated polymerisation or “grafting to”142 such as post-polymerisation modification. In terms of “grafting from” strategy, surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerisation (SI-ATRP) was widely employed to prepare NRP-functionalized CNTs and rGO.143,144 CNTs and rGO were first modified with ATRP initiators and followed by the polymerisation of nitroxide precursor monomers and oxidation. In contrast, post-modification allowed direct coupling of NRPs onto the nanocarbon surface. Both methods resulted in a covalent coupling of NRPs onto the surface of nanostructured carbons. Regardless that this method has largely improved the dispersion of NRPs into carbon additives, it unavoidably destroyed the integrity of highly conductive sp2 hybridised carbon to be nonconductive sp3 hybridised carbon. Eventually, a large mass of primitive carbons was still needed,143–145 diminishing the initial purpose of increasing NRP content. One may notice that such a design (particularly with rGO) often provide a discharge capacity (i.e., up to 450 mA h g−1) much higher than the Ctheo. for two-electron storage (i.e. 220 mA h g−1 for PTMA). However, the second electron transfer from the reduction reaction of TEMPO in these systems was not observed or very weak since no obvious plateaus from charge/discharge curves were observed. A large proportion of energy storage was from the faradaic reaction of the active groups from the uncompleted reduction of GO.146
Conversely, the preparation of NRP electrodes comprising of nanostructured carbon through non-covalent interactions is generally under very mild conditions, which can largely maintain the original conductivity of rGO and CNTs.147 The first attempt of this kind was reported by Nishide.148 PTMA-wrapped CNT was prepared via the process using a combination of ultrasonication and ultracentrifugation. The composite demonstrated an excellent electric conductance and the corresponding battery can be fully charged at an ultrahigh current or in an extremely short time (6 s). Multicycle aromatic compounds such as pyrene, perylene etc. have been widely studied as anchor molecules to bind with CNTs and graphene through π–π stacking interaction. Jia and co-workers139 applied the ultrafast single electron transfer-nitroxide radical coupling (SET-NRP) strategy to randomly introduce the desired amount of pyrene groups onto PTMA (Fig. 15a). The resulted P(TEMPO-co-PyMA) copolymers with multiple pyrene groups can then bind to rGO flakes and form electrode composites with a multilayered sandwich-liked structure. Such morphology rendered the electrode composites with excellent connectivity between NRPs and rGO flakes. Using these composites as cathodes in LIBs provided a stable discharging capacity (i.e. 80–100 mA h g−1) with up to 45 wt% of polymer loading at 5C for 300 cycles. Later, this strategy was further applied to prepare PTMA/CNTs composites with 48 wt% polymer loading, which exhibited a 1-D core-sheath morphology. When used as cathode in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs),149 the electrode can be fully charged in 1 min and displayed a discharge capacity over 80 mA h g−1 for 6000 cycles (Fig. 15b).

Similar π–π interaction can also found by using CNT and a diblock copolymer containing PTMA and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as reported by Gohy and co-workers.150 The difference between both structures was that the pyrene groups were randomly distributed in P(TEMPO-co-PyMA), while in P3HT-b-PTMA diblock copolymer P3HT block preferentially wrapped on the CNTs due to its higher adsorption energy than that of PTMA block. Interestingly, authors did not observe the IET perhaps due to that the P3HT wrapping around CNTs was well-separated from PTMA, which inhibited the IET and the oxidation of P3HT. However, one should be aware that the capacities reported in this work only taking the PTMA block into account, while the more reasonable way is to calculate the nitroxide radical density based on the whole polymer, by which the Ctheo. should be between 74–90 mA h g−1 rather than 111 mA h g−1. Recently, the same group developed a more sophisticated system consisting of cationic surfactant CTAB stabilised PTMA nanoparticles, anionic functional rGO, and multi-walled CNTs to form a self-standing PTMA@CTAB@rGO@MWCNT electrode. Firstly, positively-charged core–shell nanosphere consisting of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)(shell) and PTMA (core) was wrapped with negatively-charged rGO nanosheet.140 The composite was then mixed with CNTs to prepare the free-standing electrode. The benefit of self-assembled composite electrode process was prepared entirely in the aqueous-based solution to avoid environmental pollution. The electrode delivered 105 mA h g−1 with stable long-term cycling performance (0.03% loss per cycle).
These work prove that the non-covalent interaction can realise excellent dispersion of NRPs in nanostructured carbons, hence enable high polymer loading and maximum retention of conductivity. It is worth to point out that a mass balance between the electrochemical inactive and active materials is crucial to reach optimal battery performance. To further improve the electrode of this kind, one may seek for highly conductive graphene or CNTs. For instance, CNTs with an extremely high aspect ratio (i.e. >2000) synthesised by enhanced-direct-injection-pyrolytic-synthesis (eDIPS) can provide excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Nishide and co-workers91 demonstrated that using this type of CNTs in the NRP electrode can form a mechanically strong 3-D conductive percolation network, and enables a considerable current density beyond 1 A cm−2 (Fig. 16). This work demonstrates overall advantages of NRP/CNT composites regarding their electrochemical, physical and mechanical properties over traditional inorganic electrode materials.

An alternative approach to making the best use of highly conductive CNTs was through the impregnation of PTMA polymers into CNTs with a large diameter (i.e. 120 nm) (Fig. 17).141 This method not only effectively maintained the continuous conductive network but prevented the dissolution of active polymers into the electrolytes. As such, the corresponding electrode delivered a capacity of 210 mA h g−1 at 1C with two discharging plateaus (at 2.51 V and 3.51 V versus Na/Na+). The unique structure induced PTMA to exhibit a reversible two-electron redox reaction, while the underpinned mechanism is to be further discovered.

4.3. Electrolyte effect
The electrolyte is another crucial factor that dictates the electrochemical performance of NRP electrodes. It should be noted that most electrolytes applied in NRP electrodes are non-aqueous, which include lithium, sodium, and ammonium salts in organic solvents. However, flammability and volatility of organic solvents have brought safety concerns in battery applications. Studies have also indicated NRP electrodes perform dramatically different under various electrolyte conditions such as types of salts,151 salt concentration,66 organic solvent combinations,152etc. As the impacts of these factors have been discussed earlier, a brief discussion will be focused on the future application of new electrolytes includes ionic liquids and polymer electrolytes.
Ionic liquids have been considered as one classs of promising and safe substitutes for conventional liquid electrolytes because of their non-flammability, negligible vapour pressure, and high electrochemical and thermal stability.153 Additionally, ionic liquids can also prevent the dissolution of PTMA in electrolytes. Some studies have applied the ionic liquid to NRP electrodes, including using neat ionic liquids, lithium salt in ionic liquids,154 ionic liquids in different organic solvents,155,156 and ionic liquids in a polymer gel.157 Pyrrolidinium ionic liquid (1-butyl-1-methylpyrro-lidiuniumbis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl) imide, (Pyr14TFSI) is the most used electrodes because of its broad electrochemical stability. Another advantage of this ionic liquid is that it can serve as both “solvent” and “salt”. Electrolyte composition and concentration of Pyr14TFSI have been investigated to understand the role ionic liquids.155 To understand the cation effect on electrochemical performance, 1 M tetraethylammoniumbis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Et4NTFSI) in PC and 1 M Pyr14TFSI in PC were tested in NRP-based electrode. The electrode in 1 M of Et4NTFSI delivered a lower capacity (75 mA h g−1) than that of 1 M Pyr14TFSI (100 mA h g−1), but the diffusion coefficient showed an opposite trend. This suggested that transport properties were not the only factor to affect the capacity of electrodes, but the ion–ion and ion–solvent interaction. By comparing 1 M Pyr14TFSI in PC and neat Pyr14TFSI, the initial capacity of the electrode in 1 M Pyr14TFSI in PC was much higher than the electrode in neat Pyr14TFSI. However, the electrode in neat Pyr14TFSI showed 90% capacity retention after 10000 cycles at 10C, whereas the electrode in 1 M Pyr14TFSI in PC can only maintain 30% of capacity after the same cycles. The results indicated the neat ionic liquid can prevent the loss of NRPs from dissolution at room temperature. When the temperature was taken into account, the electrode can still dissolve into the neat Pyr14TFSI at 55 °C, which could be resolved by increasing lithium salt concentration.154 Additionally, the electrode with 1 M Pyr14TFSI in PC showed much better capacity retention at 0 °C.156 This was the first positive result of low temperature on the performance of NRP-based electrode, but it requires further investigation to explore the mechanism.
So far, ionic liquids have proven their high electrochemical compatibility with nitroxide radicals and effectively reduced the polymer dissolution at room temperature. Moreover, a theoretical calculation suggested ionic liquids can stabilise both oxoammonium cation and aminoxyl anion by creating a minimal entropic change during oxidation and reduction reaction.158,159 Lately, reversible p- and n-type TEMPO redox reactions are realised in the ionic liquid condition.51 This is the first time TEMPO exhibit reversible two-electron transfer without modification of the working electrode or using special carbon materials.
Very recently, Schubert and co-workers reported the first application of gel polymer electrolytes (GPE) in an all-organic polymer battery consisting of PTMA as a cathode. The GPE revealed a high ionic conductivity of 0.74 S cm−1. When the GPE was tested in an all-plastic battery, very stable cycling stability was achieved at 5C. While the concept was to have those three important components cathode, anode and electrolyte been made from polymers, further work is needed to lift the capacity significantly.
5. Application of NRPs in energy storage devices
Due to their high oxidation potentials, NRPs have been widely used as cathodes in different types of batteries. In combining with lithium or sodium metal as anodes, NRP/metal hybrid batteries were often fabricated to test the electrochemical performance of the NRP cathode. In addition, NRPs can also be used to fabricate redox flow batteries and as catalysts for other energy storage and conversion devices.
5.1. NRP/metal batteries
Using NRPs as cathodes in LIBs and SIBs can provide a cell voltage of 3.6 V vs. Li/Li+ and 3.2 V vs. Na/Na+, respectively. With one-electron oxidation storage, cell capacities were around 110 mA h g−1 depending on polymer structures. In some cases, one-electron reduction of nitroxides may be observed and provide extra capacity. This second potential plateau is usually at 2.5–2.8 V vs. Li/Li+. These batteries can be charged and discharged at very high current densities (i.e., up to 2000C) owing to the rapid electron transfer from the open-shelled nitroxide radicals. This property makes NRPs ideal for high-power density energy storage devices.
NRPs can also be covalently attached to the surfaces of a range of current collectors as used as cathodes through coupling chemistries and surface-initiation method. Specifically, octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was placed onto the surface of the ITO substrate to make OTS-patterned ITO substrate via microcontact printing. The blank surface of patterned ITO substrate was then backfilled with initiators, which enabled the growth of polymers through SI-ATRP. The resulting electrodes have high solvent resistance without crosslinking. Other methods such as nanolithography and photolithography were also applied to make on-chip micro batteries (Fig. 18).160,161

In addition, thin-film batteries were also configurated to increase the loading of NRPs. Several methods have been reported to fabricate the thin-film electrodes. Often indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slips, or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used as substrates to make transparent or flexible polymer film electrodes. The thickness of the film electrodes (approximately 50–500 nm) was tuned by changing the concentration of polymer solution or polymerisation time (Fig. 19).162 To further prevent dissolution issue of polymers, a crosslinker was also incorporated onto NRPs or mixed into the polymer solution, followed by thermal- or photo-initiated crosslinking reactions.

In recent years, aqueous zinc ion batteries have attracted considerable attention due to its inherent safety.163 Full cells comprising of an NRP cathode, a zinc anode and an aqueous electrolyte were also reported. Working with aqueous zinc ion electrolyte, conventional NPRs for organic electrolyte only need to increase hydrophilicity and compatibility with water by replacing their polymeric backbone (e.g. poly(vinyl ether) or poly(acrylamide) TEMPO) (Fig. 20). The charge–discharge curves for these NPRs displayed a plateau voltage at 1.66–1.73 V (versus Zn/Zn2+) with capacity range from 124 mA h g−1 to 131 mA h g−1.88,164 The cell demonstrated 97% capacity retention of its theoretical capacity while an ultrafast charging process was operated at 1200C. This underlying mechanism associated with the rapid charging process relied on the fast diffusion of counterions into the hydrophilic NPR layer. All these evidence have shown that the NPRs can be perfectly compatible with aqueous electrolytes. Just recently, this concept has prompt scientists to develop novel and safe NRPs/zinc hybrid flow battery that features with facile assembly (in the presence of air) and environmental benignity for grid-scale electrochemical energy storage.165,166

5.2. All-plastic rechargeable devices
The concept of all-plastic rechargeable batteries was first proclaimed by Nishide and co-workers a decade ago.167 Such batteries comprise of redox-active polymers as both cathode and anode, which makes the corresponding batteries that are metal-free, lightweight, and flexible. Since then, there have been many different combinations of anodic redox polymers with NRPs to form all-plastic batteries. For a long time, all-plastic batteries can only deliver an output voltage ≤2 V114,168 due to the high redox potential of the available anodic polymers. Table 3 listed the voltage of all-plastic batteries consisting of NRPs as cathodes and other anodic redox polymers, in which anodic functionalities included viologen,167 phenoxyl,35,89 anthraquinones,92 dibenzothiophenesulfone,169 and tetracyano-9,10-anthraquinonedimethane.157 Among all of these choices, only a few organic anode materials can simultaneously achieve comparable theoretical capacity and fast redox reaction at a very negative potential. N-Type poly(galvinoxylstyrene) was combined with p-type NRPs to form a total radical battery. This n-type polymer shows the plateau voltage of 0.06 V vs. Ag/AgCl and Cprac = 42 mA h g−1 (Ctheo = 51 mA h g−1). With relatively high potential and low capacity, the total plastic battery showed plateau voltage at 0.66 V and capacity of 32 mA h g−1. Other redox-active materials showed relatively lower plateau than poly(galvinoxylstyrene). Notably, viologen showed two redox couples at −0.4 V and −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which correspond to plateau voltage of 1.1 V and 1.4 V versus NRPs, respectively.170 Others have similar performances such as naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride derived polyimide (two redox couples at −0.6 V and −0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl),168 anthraquinones (−0.9 V and −1.4 V Ag/AgCl).114 Until recently, a polymer consisting of dibenzothiophenesulfone was synthesized and showed a redox potential of −1.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. By combining with NRPs, the battery demonstrated an output voltage of 2.6 V with a capacity of 212 mA h g−1. So far, this was the highest voltage reported in an all-plastic battery. Data for the electrochemical performance of all-plastic batteries studied so far were listed in Table 3.

5.3. NRPs for redox flow batteries
The redox flow battery is a type of electrochemical cell, where an ion-exchange membrane separates catholyte and anolyte.172 Redox flow battery can be separated into two categories; aqueous redox flow battery (ARFB)173 and organic redox flow battery (ORFB).174 So far, there has been tremendous work on using small molecular nitroxides as catholytes for both ARFBs and ORFBs. However, to separate the small molecular catholytes and analytes it requires to use expensive ionic exchange membrane (i.e. Nafion®). Intuitively, polymers with very high molecular weights allow much easier separation of polymers by using inexpensive large pore-size membrane and simultaneously rapid ion diffusion.175–177 In this section, we will focus on the application of NRPs in redox flow batteries. For readers who are interested in redox flow batteries using small molecule nitroxides, they are directed to the recent publications.173,178–180
The first polymer-based aqueous flow battery was developed in 2015 by Schubert and co-workers at Jena University (Fig. 21).15 Since then, it has attracted significant attention in the community. Polymers consisting of TEMPO as redox-active materials were chosen as catholytes because of the high redox reversibility in aqueous electrolyte (NaCl is often used as the supporting electrolyte) and long-term cyclability. The design criteria for NRPs to achieve high performance in a flow battery is completely different to a solid one. In a solid battery, the NRPs as electro-active materials should not dissolve into the electrolyte. Whereas in a flow battery, the higher solubility of the NRPs have, the higher energy density the battery can deliver. The electrode only acts as a current collector with excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area, and stability under applied operating potential.172 However, NRPs often suffer from low solubility in the aqueous electrolyte. To increase their water solubility, polar functional group comonomers such as (2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl)trimethylammonium chloride (METAC),15,165 poly-(ethylene glycol)methacrylate (PEGMA)),113 and [(2-(methacryloxy)-ethyl) dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)]ammonium hydroxide (MEDSAH)181 were incorporated to NRPs. However, NRPs with a various ratio of PEG exhibit irreversible lower critical solution temperature behaviour at NaCl aqueous solution ranging from 41–81 °C,113 which was not ideal for flow battery application. NRPs synthesized from either METAC or MEDSAH monomers exhibited good solubility and stability. The drawback of this design was that at least 50 mol% of these functional groups needs to be incorporated into polymer chains, which significantly reduced the theoretical capacity of NRPs.

The anolyte and catholyte cycle are separated by a semipermeable size-exclusion membrane, which retains the redox-active macromolecules while allowing small salt ions to pass; (b) fundamental electrode reactions of the nitroxide radical and viologen.15 Copyright 2015 Nature Publishing Group. 
The viscosity of the electrolyte arises as to the concentration of the dissolved polymer increases, which increases the power cost for electrolyte circulation.182 Therefore, a controlled polymerization is favoured to obtain NRPs with proper molecular weights. Alternatively, the viscosity can be reduced by replacing linear polymer to bottlebrush polymer. Nishide100 demonstrated that TEMPO containing bottlebrush polymer featured lower viscosity than other TEMPO bearing linear polymers.
Recently, another strategy to overcome the solubility limit is to use uniformly disperse nanoparticles such as colloid,114,165,183 or particles184 to facilitate the application of insoluble redox-active materials. However, the nanoparticle strategy still involves adding “dead mass” to form micelle, which did not solve the issue of low energy density. The ideal design of NRPs for flow batteries should be from a nitroxide-containing monomer with high water solubility rather than introducing electrically inert water-soluble units.
5.4. NRPs as catalytic mediator in metal-based batteries
Apart from using electrode materials, NRPs have also been applied as a catalytic mediator in different types of batteries. Gohy185 first introduced PTMA to a classic LiFePO4 to form an organic/inorganic hybrid cathode. The rapid oxidation of nitroxide radicals to oxoammonium salts followed by a subsequent IET enabled fast charging of the electrode and prevented over-polarization. This catalytic property has been quickly recognized and widely used in inorganic cathodes consisting of lithium metal oxides to improve power performance.186,187 Meanwhile, Wang188 used the same polymer as a catalytic mediator in a lithium–O2 battery. While the reduction couple (NO˙/NO−) catalysed the formation of Li2O2, a primary product on the cathode, the oxidation couple (NO+/NO˙) promoted its reversible decomposition. Such catalytic processes significantly decreased the overpotential during charge/discharge cycles. As superoxide dismutase mimics,189 nitroxide radicals also promoted the decomposition of superoxide radical species (O2˙−) which often cause the side reactions with organic electrolytes, in turn, significantly prolong the stability and cycle life of Li–O2 batteries (Fig. 22).190

6. Application of NRPs in organic electronics
Since the redox reaction of NRPs in energy storage always accompanies with the transport of counterions, a supporting electrolyte (organic or aqueous) is a necessity. However, in a so-called ‘dry type’ devices, no support electrolytes are required between the cathode and anode materials; instead, they are separated by a dielectric material and formed a sandwich-like configuration. Nishide and co-workers148 first exemplified this concept by using an NRP as the cathode and a galvinoxyl radical polymer as anode with a PVDF as the interface (Fig. 23a). When a bias voltage (i.e., −7 V) was applied, a large transient current was observed but quickly dropped by 104 folds when the voltage switched to 1.5 V (Fig. 23b). A very reversible ON/OFF behaviour was observed due to the dielectric separator preventing the charge recombination of hole-type of oxoammonium salt and phenoxyl anion (Fig. 23c). This type of ‘dry-type’ devices open a new avenue for the application of NRPs in organic memory electronics.

However, the application of such an organic memory has not gained significant attention in the following decade. Until very recently, Zhang and co-workers191 presented the dielectric energy storage by introducing small proportion of nitroxide radicals to a crosslinked polynorbornene thin-film (Fig. 24a). The purpose of fixing nitroxide radicals in a crosslinked polymer network was to reduce the dielectric loss and low breakdown strength caused by flowing radicals. However, the heat treatment of the sample destroyed the radical by 80%; as such, the correlation between the radical content and the dielectric performance (Fig. 24b and c) were not convincing. The function of nitroxide radicals in this dielectric energy storage is to be further proved, or otherwise, an alternative strategy needs to be developed for this purpose.

Moreover, NRPs have been recognized as hole-conducting (p-type) semiconductive polymers. As discussed earlier, the Boudouris group have been elaborating the fundamental theory and experimental methods for the conductivity of NRPs. Generally, electronic conduction of NRPs with a nonconjugated backbone is determined by the long-range ordered arrangement of pendant radicals. Whereas the redox state of nitroxide radicals (oxoammonium cation or hydroxylamine) acted as a dopant and significantly increased the conductivity. This ion-doping effect can be achieved by the addition of electrolyte salts or through redox doping. Recent work by Joo et al.192 studied the electric conductivity of PGTEMPO in the presence of TFSI. The heat treatment experiment clearly showed degradation of nitroxide radicals in NRP-based thin-film. Therefore, the thin-film was tested between a temperature of −50 to 50 °C (Fig. 25).

(B) Real-time cycles of conductivity upon the changes of temperature of NRP/LiTFSI composite for solid-state electronics.

The amorphous property of these nonconjugated NRPs further enables the excellent formation of thin-film with great transparency. Admittedly, compared to the mature studies and application of NRPs in ‘wet-type’ energy storage, the ‘dry-type’ organic electronic devices remain at its early stage. With the rapid development of fundamental theory and device fabrication, it is optimistic that NRPs could find significant applications for next-generation of flexible and transparent organic electronics.
7. Concluding remarks and perspectives
Owing to the unique chemical and physical properties of nitroxide radicals derived from its stable, unpaired electron structure, in the last 20 years polymers consisting of different nitroxide radicals have experienced considerable attention not only from organic and polymer chemists, but many material chemists in inorganic and energy-related fields. So far, significant advances have been achieved in understanding the fundamentals on electron transfer and storage, developing new synthetic methods, producing various polymer structures, and expanding applications from organic catalysis to emerging plastic energy storage, energy conversion and organic electronics. In addition, the redox property of nitroxide radicals have found applications as highly reactive redox mediators in solar cells,16,36 and Li–O2 batteries.190,193,194 Recent work by Nishide195 has demonstrated that incorporating NRP into perovskite, in which nitroxide radicals act as an anti-oxidizing agent and the hydrophobic polymer chains work as water-repelling coating, can effectively prevent the photodegradation and enhance the durability upon the moisture. These emerging applications of NRPs are to be further explored.
As to the most prevalent energy storage applications, it has been to a crossroads. It is noted that tremendous NRPs tested in a variety of energy storage systems are limited to linear or crosslinked structures. Other structures such as nitroxide radical dendrimers, supramolecular NRPs, cyclic NRPs or single-chain NRP nanoparticles are intriguing structures but have not studied in term of their electrochemical properties and energy storage applications. Future work, especially on design and synthesis of these innovative NRP structures may revolutionize current electrochemical theories and consequently the (electro)chemical performance and the implementation of all-plastic batteries. In addition to the above comments, some ubiquitous but critical challenges have drawn our attention.
First, a theoretically rapid and reversible two-electron transfer process in nitroxide radicals has not been easily achieved in batteries. Majority of reported NRP-based electrodes can only realize a one-electron transfer and storage, affording a Ctheo limited to about 111 mA h g−1, which is much lower than many metal oxide cathodes for LIBs, such as LiFePO4 (170 mA h g−1), LiMnO2 (171 mA h g−1), or LiCoO2 (274 mA h g−1).196 In recent years, there are attempts on NRP cathodes showing a two-electron transfer in batteries,141 but no plausible evidence was given to elucidate the underpinned mechanism. Early theoretical work45 indicated that the different reorganization energy and electrode transfer kinetics between the oxidation and reduction reaction couples (Scheme 1) could be one of the major reason. In addition, the counterion diffusion is another key factor that could significantly affect the electron transfer kinetics. Since the oxidation couple and reduction couple involve different counterion diffusion as revealed by eQCM-D, slow diffusion of electrolyte ions could result in a retardation or disappearance of the second (or reduction) electron transfer. Some ionic liquids have enabled a reversible two-electron transfer based on small molecular TEMPO radicals, providing further clue on this hypothesis. As such, we believe that through a judicious molecular design and electrode fabrication, two-electron transfer and storage can be realized in many different scenarios.
Second, much work to date only focused on one or two aspects of electrochemical properties while introducing some negative impacts that could be a trade-off to the overall battery performance. Developing a new NRP for energy storage should consider both electrochemical performance and physical properties. It is also important to fabricate a composite electrode in which NRP is the major component. Ideally, the weight fraction of NRP should be as high as 80% or above, a comparable vale to those inorganic electrodes. The critical aspect of achieving high loading of active materials is to increase intrinsic electrical conductivity.91 Additionally, the focus may shift to the electrolyte innovation including the selection of proper solvent to inhibit the dissolution of NRPs, the choice of solid-state polymer electrolyte or water-in-salt electrolyte for NRP-based batteries, which may not only overcome the dissolution issue but open more opportunities for battery design.
Third, more effort could be devoted to developing micro-batteries, patterned batteries, flexible batteries, and supercapacitors. To this end, research may steer to the physical properties of NRPs, such as solution properties and thermal properties (i.e. glass transition temperatures) etc., impact the electrochemical performance. Moreover, the mechanic and processing properties of NRPs are to be studied to provide insights for the fabrication of different types of batteries. As claimed in many publications, NRPs can be potentially derived from biomass and biodegradable. Nevertheless, little effort has been devoted to this aspect. Future work on these above aspects of NRPs are necessary.
Finally, it is worth to point out that electric-field-driven charge transport by outer-sphere electron hopping between densely populated nitroxide radicals is a remarkable aspect of NRPs. A recent breakthrough on the solid state electric conductivity (i.e., 28 S m−1) in a nonconjugated NRP sheds light on developing new conductive polymers without the limitation in traditional conjugated polymers.64 Further studies are required to elaborate the relationship between chemical and physical properties and electrochemical properties of NRPs, especially to realize a high conductivity of thin-film at a macroscopic scale to promote applications in flexible and transparent electronic devices.
In summary, applications of NRPs in emerging plastic energy storage and organic electronics have been a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field and attracted wide attention by a variety of research communities. It is very optimistic that challenges are to be resolved in the foreseeable future if both experimental and theoretical chemists and materials scientists are working together. Recent years have also seen many spin-off corporates and the increased investments from international companies to the field. As such, the authors can see a bright future of NRPs in a smart and sustainable society.
