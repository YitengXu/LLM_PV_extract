    , Accepted 7th October 2022First published on 8th October 2022AbstractCu3MX4 (M = V, Nb, and Ta; X = S, Se, and Te) compounds have recently emerged as greatly promising solar energy conversion materials due to their tailorable band gaps, high optical absorption coefficients, environmentally benign nature and comparatively abundant elements.

1 Introduction
With the increasing concerns about energy shortage and the related environmental issues of traditional fossil fuels, recent research has been directed toward the development of clean and renewable energy sources.1,2 Solar energy, as one of the most abundant natural, green and sustainable energy resources available to mankind, can be converted into electricity, heat, or fuel.3–6 The conversion and utilization of solar energy is considered a promising solution for energy and environmental problems.3,7 Therefore, studies have focused on the key challenges and opportunities in the development of innovative materials that can absorb and convert sunlight efficiently.
Exploring novel materials for enhancing solar energy harvesting is one of the major research topics in the field of sustainable energy.8–12 Over the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to their fundamental research and practical application in the field of solar energy conversion.3,13,14 In particular, significant advances have been achieved in photovoltaic and photocatalytic fields with regard to transition-metal chalcogenide semiconductors.15–18 For instance, chalcogenide solar cells based on Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 and CdTe have reached a power conversion efficiency of >22%.19,20 However, the intrinsic toxicity related to the release of Cd into the environment has seriously impeded the practical applications of Cd-based chalcogenide semiconductors. In addition, considering the accessibility and high cost of gallium and indium, more and more scientific researchers have studied and synthesized light-harvesting materials for implementation in solar energy conversion using Earth-abundant and low-cost elements. In this regard, kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 with tunable band gaps, environmentally benign nature and Earth-abundant elements has attracted extensive attention as a promising alternative.21
Inspired by the achievements of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar energy conversion materials, intense interest has been shown in exploring new light-harvesting materials. Alternatively, sulvanite-type Cu3MX4 (M = V, Nb, and Ta; X = S, Se, and Te) compounds have been regarded as promising photoabsorbers for the conversion of solar energy into electricity and fuels due to their extraordinary properties, including tunable bandgap energy, high optical absorption coefficient, and readily available and comparatively abundant elements.22–29 For example, Ikeda et al. reported that Cu3Nb1−xVxS4 shows promise for application in photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation.30 Liu et al. reported that Cu3VS4 nanocrystals can be tuned from plasmonic-like to excitonic simply via coating with CdS shells.31 Currently, Chang et al. reported that Cu3NbS4 and Cu3NbSe4 exhibit photocatalytic activities achieving the degradation of environmental pollutants.32
Despite these achievements, investigations into the synthesis of Cu3NbSe4 nanomaterials are scarce and their applications remain largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, solution synthesis of Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals as a photoactive material for investigating their optoelectronic properties has not yet been reported. It should be noted that central to these promising applications is the ability to synthesize high-quality nanomaterials, where the composition, size, and morphology of the nanocrystals are precisely controlled.33 Previous studies on the synthesis of Cu3NbSe4 commonly adopted a solid-phase reaction;22,34 however, they mostly rely on time- and energy-intensive multiple complex growth processes, which often not only fail in controlling the domain size or morphology of the synthetic products but also greatly hamper their fundamental and applied research. To overcome these limitations, the current research on designing semiconductor nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications is concentrated intensively on the production of solution-processable nanocrystals,35–37 which enables the active layers of various devices to be literally printed and features low-cost compared to other methods.38–40 Therefore, it is essential to develop a facile solution growth method to prepare high-quality Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals.
In this work, we present the solution synthesis of high-quality Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals by a facile hot-injection route. The resulting cube-shaped Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals feature high crystallinity, high monodispersity and shape uniformity. The formation processes of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals, their growth and size and morphology evolution are systematically studied. More importantly, the optoelectronic measurements of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals show excellent responsivity, stability and reproducibility. The present work not only integrates synthetic and optoelectronic investigations of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals but also lays the foundation for reinventing potential applications in other solar energy conversion areas.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Niobium(V) chloride (NbCl5, 99.95%) was purchased from Energy Chemical. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph2Se2, 98%), oleic acid (OA, 90%) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, 99%) were bought from Alfa Aesar. Oleylamine (OAm, 70%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Copper(I) chloride (CuCl), absolute ethanol, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, and cyclohexane were ordered from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the aforementioned chemicals were used as received, without any further purification and treatment.
2.2 Preparation of the Se–OAm precursor
Typically the Se–OAm precursor solution was freshly prepared by dissolving 0.1248 g of Ph2Se2 (0.4 mmol) in 2.0 mL of OAm under sonication for 10 min, and was subsequently heated to 70 °C and kept at this temperature for later use.
2.3 Synthesis of Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals
Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hot-injection method. In a typical synthesis, 0.0297 g of CuCl (0.3 mmol), 0.0270 g of NbCl5 (0.1 mmol) and 6 mL of OAm were added to a 100 mL three-neck round bottom flask and heated to 130 °C under nitrogen flow with magnetic stirring. The reaction was maintained at 130 °C for 30 min to facilitate the dissolution of all precursors and remove oxygen, water and other low-boiling point impurities. After that, the Cu(I) and Nb(V) complexes were further heated up to 280 °C. Then, the Se–OAm precursor solution was rapidly injected into the above solution and the reaction mixture was aged for 30 minutes at 280 °C with continuous stirring. After the reaction was complete, the solution mixture was cooled to room temperature naturally. 5 mL of absolute ethanol was added to the mother solution, and the products were isolated by centrifugation. The products were additionally purified three times by re-suspending them in cyclohexane and precipitating with absolute ethanol. The collected product was re-suspended in toluene for further characterization.
2.4 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resulting products were recorded on a Bruker Model D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectroscopy was conducted on a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution instrument with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al-Kα radiation as the excitation source. The sizes and morphologies of the as-prepared nanocrystals were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100Plus). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping analyses were carried out on a JEOL JEM ARM-200F TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration corrector. The absorption spectrum was recorded on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600 Shimadzu). Optoelectronic measurements were performed using an electrochemical station (CHI760E) and a solar simulator (CEL-PE300-3A) equipped with a standard AM 1.5G optical filter.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals
One of the big challenges in obtaining a multinary compound is the increase in the number of elements in the reaction process which may result in the occurrence of diverse chemical interactions. Consequently, it is significant in choosing the synthetic protocols and identifying the parameters to ensure the formation of the target materials. In this work, the precursors were chosen based on empirical evidence and previous literature reports on similar materials.41,42 For engineering a facile, scalable, and robust synthesis route to the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals, we explored a colloidal synthesis method by the reaction of CuCl and NbCl5 with Ph2Se2 in the presence of OAm, which may act as a solvent and surface ligand,43 as described in the Experimental section. The phase purity and crystal structure of the resulting products were confirmed by powder XRD measurements. The XRD pattern of the as-obtained sample combined with the standard diffraction pattern of bulk Cu3NbSe4 is shown in Fig. 1a. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the cubic phase Cu3NbSe4, and match very well with the standard JCPDS pattern # 81-2492.44 No impurity peaks were observed in the XRD pattern, demonstrating that the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals were successfully synthesized through our developed method. Meanwhile, the corresponding crystal structure of cubic Cu3NbSe4 is given in the inset of Fig. 1a. In addition, Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive technique was employed to further confirm the identity of the prepared Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. S1,† the peaks at 236.7, 166.8, and 143.5 cm−1 can be well attributed to the A1, F1b, and F2b vibration modes of sulvanite-type Cu3NbSe4.32 No other peaks from impurities were detected, revealing that the synthesized product is phase-pure Cu3NbSe4.

Inset of (a): schematic diagram of the cubic Cu3NbSe4 crystal structure. (b–d) High-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p, Nb 3d, and Se 3d of Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals. 
Furthermore, to determine the chemical valence and elemental composition of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals, XPS was carried out. As shown in Fig. S2,† the survey spectrum confirms the co-existence of Cu, Nb, and Se elements in the as-obtained nanocrystals. Meanwhile, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu, Nb, and Se were further implemented to examine the chemical states of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals. As described in Fig. 1b, two characteristic peaks Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 of Cu3NbSe4 are located at 932.1 eV and 951.9 eV, respectively, with a peak splitting of 19.8 eV, indicating the presence of the oxidation state of Cu(I).41,42,45 Note that the two small peaks located at 934.1 eV and 954.8 eV can be indexed to the oxidation of copper(I).46 In Fig. 1c, the peaks of Nb 3d located at 206.9 eV (3d5/2) and 209.5 eV (3d3/2) confirm the Nb(V) state. As for the core level spectrum of the Se 3d region (Fig. 1d), the values at 53.6 eV and 54.5 eV correspond to the binding energies of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, respectively, validating the existence of Se2−.47,48 The XPS results reveal that all three elements are in the expected chemical valences for Cu3NbSe4.
The investigations on the morphology, size, and microstructure of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals were performed by TEM. From the representative high- and low-magnification TEM images of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, we observe that the resulting Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals have a well-defined cube-like shape and are nearly monodisperse in nature. The excellent dispersity of the obtained Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals makes them processable for various applications. As described in Fig. 2c, the size distribution histogram of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals collected from the TEM images shows that the average length of the nanocube side is 11.6 ± 1.3 nm. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2d shows a clear lattice pattern with an interplanar spacing of 0.56 nm, which can be assigned to the (100) and (010) planes of cubic-phase Cu3NbSe4.22 Meanwhile, the corresponding SAED pattern in the [001] zone axis as shown in Fig. 2e exhibits sharp and regular symmetric diffraction spots, uncovering that the resultant Cu3NbSe4 is of single crystalline nature. Besides, STEM-EDS elemental mapping was carried out to investigate the elemental distribution of the as-prepared Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 2f, there is a homogeneous distribution of the three elements with the Cu:Nb:Se ratio being close to the expected 3:1:4 ratio (Fig. S3†). Based on the aforementioned results, it is concluded that the chemical composition of the product is in good accordance with the stoichiometric composition.

3.2 Effects of experimental parameters on Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystal formation
In order to gain a better understanding of the formation process of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals, a series of experiments were performed to explore the effects of temperature, time, and surfactant on the crystal phase and morphology of the product. The products synthesized under different synthetic conditions were identified by XRD and TEM. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the phase progressions of the nanocrystalline products prepared at various reaction temperatures for 30 min. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, the pattern of the as-obtained product can be assigned to the berzelianite structure Cu2−xSe,47 when the injection and growth temperature was 240 °C. From Fig. 3b, as the injection and growth temperature was increased to 260 °C, the obviously observable diffraction peaks at 15.7°, 35.6°, and 48.3° were exclusively assigned to the (100), (210), and (221) planes of cubic structured Cu3NbSe4, indicating the formation of Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals. Upon further elevating the temperature to 280 °C (Fig. 3c) and 300 °C (Fig. 3d), the signal intensity of these diffraction peaks simultaneously enhances. From the viewpoint of saving energy, we suggest that the optimal reaction temperature is 280 °C. These findings point out that the reaction temperature plays a crucial role in determining the formation of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the resulting products at different injection and growth temperatures of (a) 240 °C, (b) 260 °C, (c) 280 °C, and (d) 300 °C after the injection of 2.0 mL of OAm and dissolving 0.4 mmol of Ph2Se2 in a liquid mixture consisting of OAm (6.0 mL), CuCl (0.3 mmol), and NbCl5 (0.1 mmol) for reaction for 30 min. Reference patterns of cubic phase Cu2−xSe JCPDS # 06-0680 (top) and cubic Cu3NbSe4 JCPDS # 81-2492 (down) are shown for comparison, respectively. 
To further study the evolution of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals, the samples prepared at 280 °C with different reaction times were monitored by XRD and TEM. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, the study reveals that the crystalline structure of the synthesized product is a cubic Cu3NbSe4 phase, which exhibits predominantly a cubic shape and a size of 7.6 ± 0.8 nm. However, a tiny fraction of truncated cubic Cu3NbSe4 nanoparticles were observed. Continuing the growth at 280 °C for 30 min improves shape uniformity and results in monodisperse 11.6 ± 1.3 nm nanocubes (Fig. 2a–c). When the reaction time was further prolonged to 60 min, we observed that the product remains in the same cubic Cu3NbSe4 phase. However, the shape uniformity worsens again leading to the formation of a rectangular shape, with a larger size of 15.1 ± 1.6 nm, as shown in Fig. 4d–f. According to TEM studies, we found that in this synthesis, the size and morphology of the synthesized Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals can be adjusted by simply controlling the reaction time duration.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns, TEM images, and the corresponding statistical size analyses of the resulting Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals at 280 °C and different times: (a–c) 3 min and (d–f) 60 min. 
Moreover, our experimental results disclose that the surface ligand plays a crucial role in the formation of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocubes, which is in agreement with the evidence that the morphology of the resulting Cu3NbSe4 is notably influenced by the introduction of OA. The reaction was carried out using the same typical synthetic procedures except that the Se–OAm precursor solution was injected in the presence of OAm and OA at 280 °C for 30 min. As depicted in Fig. 2b and Fig. 5, by adding the coordinating ligand OA, the morphologies of the products evolve gradually from nanocubes to irregular nanoparticles. However, as shown in Fig. S4,† the crystal phase of Cu3NbSe4 can be maintained with the increase of the concentration of OA. From the above results, we speculate that the formation of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocubes is the result of the combination of the intrinsic nature of the cubic crystal phase structure and the guidance of preferential adsorption of surfactant OAm on crystal facets.43,49,50

3.3 Optical and optoelectronic properties of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals
The optical properties of the resulting Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals were investigated by measuring the UV-vis absorption spectrum. As described in Fig. 6a, we observe that the as-prepared Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals exhibit a broad and strong absorption ranging from the ultraviolet to the entire visible spectral region, indicating that the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals have great potential for application in UV-vis photodetectors. In addition, the optical band gap value of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals was determined by extrapolating the straight line of the Tauc plot (αhν)2versus hν (α = optical absorption coefficient, h = Planck constant, and ν = photon frequency). From the inset of Fig. 6a, a direct optical band gap was estimated to be around 2.25 eV, which is well consistent with the previously reported results.22

(b) I–V curves of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals measured in the dark and under white light irradiation with an incident power of 20 mW cm−2. (c) Temporal photoresponse of the device under light on/off switching. (d) Response rate of the photodetector acquired from one magnified cycle of response with a rise time of 0.3 s and decay time of 0.1 s. 
To improve the charge mobility in nanocrystal thin films, the long chain ligand OAm was first replaced by a short ligand, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), via a ligand exchange procedure.51,52 The MPA-capped Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals were found to readily disperse in toluene. Furthermore, the optoelectronic characteristics of the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals were investigated by fabricating a photoresponse device, which was constructed by spin-coating the concentrated ligand-exchanged Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals dispersed in toluene onto a glass substrate and employing a pair of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes.51,53 Considering the strong absorption of the synthesized Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals in the visible light range, a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 400 nm cutoff filter (400 nm < λ < 780 nm) was used as a white light source. Meanwhile, the light intensity was adjusted and measured using an optical power meter. In order to evaluate the photoresponsive properties, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the as-fabricated Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystal device were characterized in the dark and under light irradiation. As depicted in Fig. 6b, the I–V curves show nearly linear behavior, unveiling the Ohmic contact between the Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals and the ITO electrodes. Besides, the temporal photoresponse of the Cu3NbSe4 photodetector was characterized by periodically turning the light on and off with a light intensity of 20 mW cm−2 at a bias of 1.0 V. As illustrated in Fig. 6c, with the light illumination on and off, the current of the devices exhibits two distinguishing states, i.e., a “low” current state in the dark state and a “high” current state under light illumination. In particular, the current rapidly increases to a value of ∼70 μA under light irradiation, and then sharply decreases to a value of ∼2 μA as the light is turned off, yielding an on/off ratio of ∼35. This evidence may be ascribed to the strong light–matter interaction and broad light-harvesting capacity of the synthesized Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals. Besides the high on/off ratio, the photocurrent and dark current can remain nearly unchanged after several cycles with repeated switching on/off the incident light at an interval of 15 s, verifying that the device possesses high reversibility and stability. As shown in Fig. 6d, from the enlarged view of one typical photoresponse cycle, it is observed that the fast rise and decay times are 0.3 s and 0.1 s, respectively. The values of the response time of our device are superior to those of many other reported visible-light photodetectors as summarized in Table S1.† Moreover, the device can still possess high photoresponsivity and retain 96% of its initial photocurrent after irradiation for 3 hours (Fig. S5†). The above results verify that the device exhibits excellent stability, reproducibility, and responsivity, suggesting that the as-synthesized Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals could be a potential candidate for application in electronic and optoelectronic devices.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a mild colloidal strategy for a feasible and high-quality bottom-up synthesis of monodisperse Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals with a uniform size and morphology. The phase, size, and morphology of the resulting Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals can be controlled through the manipulation of synthesis conditions. Strikingly, a Cu3NbSe4-based photodetector shows a high Ilight/Idark ratio of 35, fast response speeds of 0.3/0.1 s for rise/fall times and excellent stability. These results corroborate that the synthesized Cu3NbSe4 nanocrystals possess great prospects for application in electronic and optoelectronic devices.
