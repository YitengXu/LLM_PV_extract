    , Accepted 19th June 2019First published on 21st June 2019AbstractPerovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are promising next-generation light sources due to the excellent optical and electronic properties of the materials as well as their process simplicity and low cost. To boost their electroluminescence (EL) efficiency, a plethora of approaches are proposed and demonstrated. Here, another possibility by introducing an exciton retrieving layer (ERL) into the devices is reported. A composite layer, formed by vacuum co-evaporating an electron transporting material (1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene, TmPyPB) and a blue phosphorescent material (bis(2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2′)picolinate, FIrpic), is inserted into PeLEDs as an ERL in between the emitting layer and the electron transporting layer. Both 3D and quasi-2D PeLEDs with an ERL exhibit strongly enhanced EL performance without changing the emission spectra. 3D PeLEDs show a low turn-on voltage of ∼3.6 V, a maximum luminance of 14363 cd m−2, and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.26%, which correspond to 2.5-fold luminance and 3.8-fold EQE enhancements compared with the control device. Quasi-2D PeLEDs exhibit a low turn-on voltage of ∼3.6 V, a maximum luminance of 9481 cd m−2, and a maximum EQE of 4.24%, corresponding to a 2.7-fold EQE enhancement compared with the control device. The physical mechanism is further discussed theoretically and validated experimentally. The blue phosphorescent FIrpic can act as a sensitizer such that energy can be transferred from both the singlet and triplet excitons of TmPyPB to the excited states of CsPbBr3via Förster and Dexter energy transfer processes.
1. Introduction
After the invention of highly efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the race of achieving light sources with an even higher efficiency, longer lifetime, lower cost, higher brightness, better color quality, varying from factors, has never been stopped. Besides already-commercialized organic LEDs (OLEDs)1,2 and still-growing quantum-dot LEDs (QLEDs),2–6 perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) have been studied extensively in very recent years.7–9 Among the plethora of existing research studies, solution-processed perovskites as an emissive layer (EML) have received a lot of attention not only due to their excellent optical and electronic properties such as high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, ∼95%), tunable pure-color emission, ambipolar carrier transporting behavior and long exciton diffusion length, but also because of their process simplicity and low cost.10–14 In addition to being adopted as the emissive layer in LEDs, the excellence of these materials makes them highly promising in photovoltaics, photodetectors, transistors, solid-state lighting and information displays as well.15–24 Remarkably, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells has already reached 22.1%, approximately the same level as that of traditional inorganic semiconductor solar cells.
For organic–inorganic hybrid PeLEDs, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.53% has been reported in 2015, determined by the nanocrystal pinning (NCP) method.25 Though the EL efficiency record of such hybrid PeLEDs keeps updating, stability against external stimuli such as heat, water and oxygen is always a concern that restricts their further development and practical applications.26 By contrast, all-inorganic perovskites exhibit better thermal stability and higher PLQY,9,27,28 showing great potential for replacing the hybrid perovskites as the EML in PeLEDs. A pioneering study on the use of the CsPbBr3 thin film as the EML in PeLEDs has been reported in 2015 yet with a somewhat low current efficiency of 0.43 cd A−1.9 To explore the potential of all-inorganic perovskites, numerous methods have been proposed and employed in the last few years, and very high current efficiencies have been reported very recently.29,30 For instance, a variety of solvents and/or additives have been mixed in the CsPbBr3 solution to enhance the EML film coverage, including poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and so on,31,32 and different kinds of charge injecting layers (CILs) have been applied to balance the carrier transporting behavior, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate):poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PEDOT:PSS:PVK), molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), zinc oxide (ZnO), etc.9,32,33 Meanwhile, various charge transporting layers (CTLs) can be adopted to ameliorate the carrier transporting ability in PeLEDs, such as poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)-diphenylamine) (TFB), 4,4-N,N-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP), 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) and 1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB), to name a few.33–36 Another possibility is to insert an exciton blocking layer (EBL, for example, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)) in between the CTL and the EML for stronger exciton confinement in the EML.37 However, the traditional EBL (POSS) and traditional CTLs (TFB, CBP, TPBi, TmPyPB, etc.) can only block the singlet excitons generated at the interface of the EML/CTL. That is to say, triplet excitons may still be wasted via non-radiative annihilation, since these EBLs and CTLs belong to traditional fluorescent materials which can only harvest singlet excitons (a quarter of the generated excitons). Notably, by taking full advantage of the triplet excitons (three quarters of the generated excitons), a significant enhancement should be expected. Several pioneering studies have reported the harvest of both singlets and triplets in PeLEDs using light-emitting materials with 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) such as (1) introducing a phosphorescent material (bis(2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2′)picolinate, FIrpic),38 or a thermally activated delayed fluorescence material (4,5-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phthalonitrile, 2CzPN)39 as a dopant in the EML; (2) inserting an ultrathin 2CzPN layer in between the EML and the electron transporting layer (ETL) as the buffer layer to widen the exciton formation zone;40 (3) involving both the phosphorescent material FIrpic and the electron transport material TmPyPB as double dopants in the EML.41 However, the generated singlets and triplets at the EML/ETL interface will be diffused into the adjacent ETL and thus cannot be fully harvested by the EML.
To address the above mentioned issues, in this work, an exciton retrieving layer (ERL), composed of an electron transporting material (TmPyPB) and a blue phosphorescent material (FIrpic), is inserted in between the 3D/quasi-2D perovskite EML and the ETL to harvest both diffused singlets and triplets in PeLEDs. FIrpic, with an internal quantum efficiency of nearly 100%, plays a crucial role as an energy transfer sensitizer between the electron transporting material (TmPyPB) and the 3D/quasi-2D perovskite EML. With the introduction of the ERL (TmPyPB:FIrpic) into PeLEDs, all generated excitons (both the singlet and triplet excitons) at the EML/ERL (TmPyPB:FIrpic) interface can be harvested, via spin–orbit coupling realized by heavy metal ions, thus leading to an optimized EL performance. Experimentally, a low turn-on voltage of ∼3.6 V, a maximum luminance of 14363 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency of 4.85 cd A−1 and a maximum EQE of 1.26% can be observed in 3D CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs. Compared with the reference 3D CsPbBr3 PeLEDs without the ERL, a substantial enhancement of more than 3.8-fold maximum EQE is achieved. Meanwhile, the optimized quasi-2D CsPbBr3:phenethylammonium bromide (PEABr) based PeLEDs with an ERL can achieve a low turn-on voltage of ∼3.6 V, a maximum luminance of 9481 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency of 16.13 cd A−1, and a maximum EQE of 4.24%, while the control quasi-2D device without an ERL exhibits a higher turn-on voltage of ∼4.4 V, a maximum luminance of 2367 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency of 4.41 cd A−1, and a maximum EQE of 1.16%. Therefore, a 2.7-fold enhancement of the maximum EQE is realized. This work provides an effective way to fully benefit from all the generated excitons (both the singlets and triplets) and enlightens the development of high-efficiency 3D/quasi-2D PeLEDs with EMLs being unchanged.
2. Results and discussion
In the experiment, four groups of devices (see Table 1) were fabricated to investigate the effectiveness of the ERL (TmPyPB:FIrpic) in the EL performance. To study the influence of the FIrpic concentration on EL performance, the TmPyPB:FIrpic layer with different doping ratios was introduced in between the EML and the ETL. Five 3D PeLEDs (Group A) were designed with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/CsPbBr3 (30 nm)/TmPyPB:FIrpic (10 nm, x wt%)/TmPyPB (55 nm)/Liq (2.5 nm)/Al (120 nm), where x = 0, 15, 20, 25 and 30 for devices A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5, respectively. In order to show that all generated excitons can be transferred from TmPyPB:FIrpic to CsPbBr3, devices (Group B) without or with spin-coated CsPbBr3 were fabricated as ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/(without or with) CsPbBr3 (30 nm)/TmPyPB:FIrpic (10 nm, 25 wt%)/TmPyPB (55 nm)/Liq (2.5 nm)/Al (120 nm), where B-1 and B-2 stand for the device without and with spin-coated CsPbBr3, respectively. To identify the most appropriate place at which the TmPyPB:FIrpic layer should be inserted, four 3D PeLEDs (Group C) were created with different thicknesses of the spacer layer (TmPyPB) between CsPbBr3 and TmPyPB:FIrpic as ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/CsPbBr3 (30 nm)/TmPyPB (y nm)/TmPyPB:FIrpic (10 nm, 25 wt%)/TmPyPB (55-y nm)/Liq (2.5 nm)/Al (120 nm), where y = 0, 1, 2, and 4 denote devices C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4, respectively. To demonstrate that the suggested mechanisms are also suitable for quasi-2D PeLEDs, two devices (Group D) were prepared as ITO/PVK/Quasi-2D Perovskite Film/TmPyPB:FIrpic (z wt%, 10 nm)/TmPyPB (55 nm)/Liq (2.5 nm)/Al (120 nm), where the quasi-2D perovskite film consists of CsPbBr3 and PEABr with a molar ratio of 1:0.4. For devices D-1 and D-2, z = 0 and 25, respectively.

The EL performance and the detailed characteristics of the 3D CsPbBr3 PeLEDs in Group A are shown in Fig. 1d–f and Table 2. The FIrpic doping concentration in the TmPyPB:FIrpic interlayer shows a minor influence on the J–V characteristics for these devices since FIrpic has a relatively poor carrier transporting capability. Yet with excessive FIrpic dopants, increased current leakage below the device turn-on voltage can be observed. This can be attributed to the much lower LUMO of FIrpic (−3.3 eV) than that of TmPyPB (−2.7 eV) and the much higher HOMO of FIrpic (−6.0 eV) than that of TmPyPB (−6.7 eV), where FIrpic molecules act as defects and capture electrons and holes directly. On the other hand, the FIrpic-doped PeLEDs exhibit remarkable enhancement on luminance, current efficiency, and EQE as they increase with the FIrpic doping concentration being increased from 0 to 25 wt%. Intriguingly, a maximum luminance of 14363 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency of 4.85 cd A−1, and a maximum EQE of 1.26% are obtained in device A-4 (25 wt% FIrpic), corresponding to 3.5-fold luminance, 4.8-fold current efficiency and 4.8-fold EQE compared with the control device A-1 (without ERL). It is worth mentioning that when the doping concentration is larger than 25 wt%, the EL performance starts to deteriorate with further increase of the doping concentration. This may be attributed to the fact that at low doping concentrations, the exciton energy can be well-transferred from FIrpic to CsPbBr3via Förster energy transfer. Yet at high FIrpic doping concentrations, the Förster energy transfer is saturated since the large exciton density in the ERL may cause exciton–exciton annihilation within the ERL. Although this leads to a lower current efficiency (3.81 cd A−1) in device A-5 compared with A-4, it is still more efficient than the control device A-1 (without ERL).

In Fig. 1f and the detailed CIE data in Table 2, it can be seen that the FIrpic doping concentration shows a negligible impact on the EL line shape and the color performance under the same biased voltage of 7 V. This is pivotal to practical applications as the introduction of the ERL will not generate unwanted EL line shape changes or emission peak shifts. More importantly, the EL emission is solely from CsPbBr3 and without any additional spectral sub-peaks in the blue region (see Fig. 1f and Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating that the energy transfer from TmPyPB, via FIrpic, to CsPbBr3 is quite efficient and complete. It is also worth noting that the doping of FIrpic will slightly enhance the device lifetime (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The major enhancement mentioned above should be ascribed to the phosphorescent material FIrpic. As a phosphorescent sensitizer, it plays the role of not only an energy acceptor for energy transferring from TmPyPB molecules to FIrpic, but also an energy donor for energy transfer from FIrpic to CsPbBr3.
Noticeably, the excited states can be totally confined in the EML, since the band gap of CsPbBr3 is smaller than those of TmPyPB and FIrpic, and the conduction band edge (−3.35 eV) and the valence band edge (−5.85 eV) of CsPbBr3 are enclosed in the LUMO and HOMO levels of TmPyPB (−2.7 eV, −6.7 eV) and FIrpic (−3.3 eV, −6.0 eV). The suitable energy level alignment can result in decent Förster energy transfer. Specifically, Förster energy transfer can be of long distance, expressed as:44 D* + A → D + A*(1)where D is the donor, A is the acceptor, and the excited state is represented by *. In such a process, the energy is transferred from the excited state of the donor to that of the acceptor through non-radiative dipole–dipole coupling. The energy transfer rate is related to the emission spectra of the donor and the absorption spectra of the acceptor, and the transition probability of both the donor and the acceptor. The related energy transfer rate (KET) can be described as:45 (2)where κ2 is the dipole orientation factor, ϕD is the donor fluorescence quantum yield, n is the refractive index of the medium, NA is Avogadro's number, R is the donor–acceptor distance, fD is the normalized donor emission spectrum, εA is the acceptor absorption spectrum, v is the wave number, τD is the donor fluorescence lifetime and R0 is the critical transfer distance. To establish effective energy transfer, a large overlap between the donor emission spectrum and the acceptor absorption spectrum is desirable. In our work, the acceptor (CsPbBr3) absorption spectrum and the donor (FIrpic and TmPyPB) PL spectrum indeed show large overlaps across the visible band, as shown in Fig. 1c. This ensures efficient Förster energy transfer from the donors (TmPyPB and FIrpic) to the acceptors (CsPbBr3). Moreover, previous work reported that sufficient Dexter and Förster energy transfer processes can be realized between TmPyPB and FIrpic.46
Based on these analyses, a multistage energy transfer process can be proposed, as schematically shown in Fig. 2. The main energy transfer mechanism can be depicted as follows. First, the exciton can be generated at the CsPbBr3/TmPyPB:FIrpic interface where the electrons and holes recombine. When singlet excitons (S1T) and triplet excitons (T1T) are produced simultaneously within TmPyPB, they may diffuse into the adjacent layers, the CsPbBr3 layer and the TmPyPB:FIrpic layer. There are two ways for the energy in S1T and T1T states to be transferred to the excited state (E*) of CsPbBr3. The first way is through a direct Förster energy transfer where the energy in S1T is directly transferred to E* without the help of a phosphorescent sensitizer (FIrpic). For the second way, the energy in both S1T and T1T can be transferred to E* with the assistance of a phosphorescent sensitizer (FIrpic) via three paths. In the first path, the energy in S1T is transferred to the singlets (S1F) of the adjacent FIrpic molecules by the Förster energy transfer process, as the LUMO (−3.3 eV) and the HOMO (−6.0 eV) of FIrpic are confined in those (−2.7 eV and −6.7 eV) of TmPyPB. Then, the energy in S1F is transferred to E* via another Förster energy transfer process, as the conduction band edge (−3.35 eV) and valence band edge (−5.85 eV) of CsPbBr3 are confined in the LUMO (−3.3 eV) and the HOMO (−6.0 eV) of FIrpic. In the second path, the S1T is first transferred to S1F through Förster energy transfer, followed by the energy transfer from S1F to the triplets (T1F) of the FIrpic molecules via the intersystem crossing (ISC) process. The energy in T1F can then be transferred to E* through the triplet–singlet Förster energy transfer process, as the excited state of CsPbBr3 has a lower energy (2.39 eV) than the triplet of FIrpic (2.65 eV). In the third path, the energy in T1T is first transferred to T1Fvia the Dexter energy transfer process, as the triplet energy of FIrpic (2.65 eV) is smaller than that of TmPyPB (2.78 eV). Then, the energy in T1F is cascadingly transferred to the E* via the Förster energy transfer process. At the end of these paths, through a radiative decay (from E* to E0), photons with a peak wavelength at ∼520 nm are emitted. The specific energy transfer processes can be expressed as follows:44

where S0T and S0F stand for the ground states of TmPyPB and FIrpic molecules, respectively.
To validate the energy transfer from both TmPyPB and FIrpic to CsPbBr3, a group of PeLEDs (Group B) are fabricated (Table 1). First, we examine PeLEDs with/without the CsPbBr3 layer. As shown in Fig. 3, the EL spectrum of B-1 (without CsPbBr3) shows the intrinsic emission from FIrpic (Fig. 3a), suggesting that the energy transfer from TmPyPB to FIrpic is effective and sufficient via Förster and Dexter energy transfer processes. On the other hand, the EL spectrum of B-2 shows a typical emission from CsPbBr3 with a peak located at 522 nm and an FWHM of 16 nm, while no additional sub-peaks can be observed in the blue region. The results imply that the energy transfer from both TmPyPB and FIrpic to CsPbBr3 is also efficient and complete via the abovementioned energy transfer processes.
 Fig. 3  The normalized EL spectra at 7 V of (a) devices B-1 (without CsPbBr3) and B-2 (with CsPbBr3), (b) devices C-1 (0 nm), C-2 (1 nm), C-3 (2 nm), and C-4 (4 nm). 
To identify the most appropriate place at which the TmPyPB:FIrpic composite layer should be inserted, 3D CsPbBr3 PeLEDs (Group C in Table 1) with different thicknesses of the TmPyPB spacer layers are prepared. The normalized EL spectra of PeLEDs in Group C at 7 V are shown in Fig. 3b. All the PeLEDs show a main peak at 522 nm with an FWHM of 16 nm, which is typical from CsPbBr3 emission. However, sidelobes emitted from FIrpic in the range of 450 nm to 485 nm exist in the PeLEDs with TmPyPB spacer layers (C-2, C-3, and C-4). This indicates that the TmPyPB:FIrpic composite layer should be inserted at the interface of CsPbBr3/TmPyPB for the best color performance. Interestingly, the blue emission from FIrpic increases when the thickness of the spacer layer increases from 0 to 2 nm while it decreases as the thickness of the spacer layer further increases from 2 to 4 nm. A possible reason is that, in the range of 0 to 2 nm, the shorter the distance between the exciton generation interface (CsPbBr3/TmPyPB) and TmPyPB:FIrpic, the more the excitons being transferred back to CsPbBr3 from TmPyPB via FIrpic, thus leading to less FIrpic emission. The control PeLED with no spacer layer (device C-1) manifests no sidelobes from FIrpic, indicating that the energy of all the diffused excitons from the exciton generation interface to the TmPyPB:FIrpic layer can be transferred back to the CsPbBr3 layer via Förster and Dexter energy transfer processes. When the thickness of the spacer layer increases to 2–4 nm, only few diffused excitons can arrive at the TmPyPB:FIrpic layer such that the excitons can hardly be harvested by FIrpic due to the exponential decay of the exciton concentration when they are far away from the exciton generation interface. Thus, the sidelobes are smaller in C-4 than those in C-3.
Compared to 3D perovskites, lower dimensional counterparts can enhance exciton binding energy through quantum confinement25 such that faster radiative recombination is promised which can result in a more efficient EL. To demonstrate that the introduction of the ERL is also promising in boosting the EL efficiency in other device structures/perovskite systems, a group of the quasi-2D PeLEDs with the passivation treatment by PEABr (Group D) are fabricated with and without the TmPyPB:FIrpic ERL, in which PEDOT:PSS is replaced by PVK and CsPbBr3 is passivated by PEABr (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3, the EL performance of the quasi-2D control device (D-1) is largely improved compared to that of the 3D control device, showing a maximum luminance of 2367 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency of 4.41 cd A−1, and a maximum EQE of 1.16%, which are comparable to those in previously reported quasi-2D PeLEDs based on CsPbBr3:PEABr.47 Notably, the optimized quasi-2D device D-2 with an ERL shows much improved EL performance without unwanted EL line shape changes or emission peak shifts. A low turn-on voltage of ∼3.6 V, a maximum luminance of 9481 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency of 16.13 cd A−1, and a maximum EQE of 4.24% are achieved in D-2. Both the two quasi-2D PeLEDs show a main peak at 512 nm with an FWHM of 18 nm, which is typical CsPbBr3 emission and no additional spectral sub-peaks in the blue region can be distinguished (see Fig. 4c and Fig. S3, ESI†). These confirm again that FIrpic can act as a phosphorescent sensitizer such that energy can be transferred from both singlet and triplet excitons of TmPyPB to the excited states of CsPbBr3:PEABr via Förster and Dexter energy transfer processes.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully fabricated highly efficient 3D and quasi-2D PeLEDs by introducing a TmPyPB:FIrpic composite layer as the ERL. With FIrpic acting as a phosphorescent sensitizer, more excitons (both singlets and triplets) can be utilized for EL emission. The optimized PeLEDs with an ERL exhibited enhanced EL performance with a low turn-on voltage of ∼3.6 V, a maximum luminance of 14363 cd m−2 and a maximum EQE of 1.26% (corresponding to a maximum current efficiency of 4.85 cd A−1) in 3D CsPbBr3 PeLEDs. Compared with the control 3D CsPbBr3 PeLEDs without an ERL, 2.5-fold luminance and 3.8-fold EQE enhancements are achieved. Meanwhile, the optimized quasi-2D CsPbBr3:PEABr PeLEDs exhibited a maximum EQE of 4.24% (corresponding to a maximum current efficiency of 16.13 cd A−1). Compared to the control quasi-2D PeLEDs, a 2.7-fold maximum EQE is achieved. Our work provides an effective approach to fully benefit from all the generated excitons and enlightens the development of further high-efficiency PeLEDs with EMLs and emission properties being unchanged.
