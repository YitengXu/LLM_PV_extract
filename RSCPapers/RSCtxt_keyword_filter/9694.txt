    , Accepted 23rd January 2013First published on 23rd January 2013AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), consisting of counter electrodes (CEs) with composite films made of carbon black (CB) and conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI), were fabricated. A slurry was first prepared with 99 wt% of conducting polymer-loaded CB using the requisite 1 wt% of poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imide (POEM) as the dispersant in ethanol. The conducting polymer-loaded CB was a commercial product with a composition of about 80 wt% of CB and 20 wt% of conducting polymer. The POEM dispersant was required to generate a homogeneous dispersion of the carbon material in the ethanolic solution. The dispersive ability of POEM for CB was demonstrated both visually and through UV–vis absorption spectra and the dynamic light scattering method (DLS). The slurries with PPy/CB and PANI/CB were coated on FTO glasses to prepare CEs for DSSCs. The DSSCs with CEs containing PPy/CB and PANI/CB have shown power conversion efficiencies (η) of 5.85 ± 0.23% and 6.77 ± 0.13%, respectively, while the cells with CEs containing bare CB and bare platinum have shown η's of 5.35% and 7.24 ± 0.11%, respectively. The dispersive function of POEM for CB to impart high electrocatalytic abilities on the corresponding CEs was responsible for the better performance of the cells for both PPy/CB and PANI/CB than that of the cell with bare CB. Hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, Tafel polarization plots, and rotating disk electrode measurements (RDE) were used to substantiate the explanations.
Introduction
The counter electrode (CE), a key component in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), has the essential function of conversion of I3− into I− in the electrolyte of the cell, and thereby completes the cycle of operation of the cell.1 High electrocatalytic ability, excellent electrical conductivity, and high corrosion resistance are indispensable for the functioning of a good CE.2 Platinum (Pt) is the most used material as the catalytic layer on the CE, because of its high conductivity, stability and high electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction.3 However, the high cost and energy-consumptive fabrication process of the Pt CE narrows down its applicability. By replacing the expensive Pt in DSSCs, the cost of fabrication of the cells on industrial scale can be greatly reduced.4
Carbon materials attract much attention due to their advantages of low cost, high conductivity, and good electrocatalytic ability for the reduction of I3− ions.5 Carbonaceous materials with various allotropes and structures, e.g., carbon black (CB),6 carbon nanotube (CNT),7,8 graphene,9 activated carbon,10,11 hard carbon spherule,12 and acetylene-black spheres13 have been used as the catalysts to substitute Pt. Li et al. have prepared a CE for a DSSC at a low temperature, by coating organic binder-free carbon slurry on a glass substrate;14 the pertinent DSSC showed a power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.1%, which is comparable to that of the cell with a Pt CE (7.0%). However, the dispersion of a carbon material in a solution to be used for the coating of the material is an important factor that can influence the performance of the pertinent DSSC. Many reports have indicated that without adding dispersant in the carbon solution, there would be an aggregation of the carbon particles in the coated film, and thereby a retardation in the electron transfer through the film.15,16 Choi et al. have used pyrene functionalized poly(maleic acid-co-p-hydroxystyrene)-block-poly(p-hydroxystyrene) (HSPM) as the dispersant in a solution containing CNTs, and applied this solution for coating the film of the nanotubes on the CE of a DSSC;17 the pertinent DSSC showed a higher η, compared to that of the cell prepared forgoing the dispersant. Chen et al. employed an ionic-liquid-assisted sonochemical method to prepare a composite film containing well-dispersed CNTs and Pt nanoparticles;18 the pertinent DSSC reached a higher η of 8.81%, with reference to that of the cell with bare Pt on the CE (8.84%).
On the other hand, conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),19 polyaniline (PANI),20 and polypyrrole (PPy)21 have aroused intensive interest in the area of research on DSSCs, because of their higher conductivity and higher electrocatalytic activity towards the I−/I3− redox couple, compared to those of carbon materials.22 Among various conducting polymers, PANI has been studied most intensively due to its exceptional electrical, catalytic, and electrochemical properties. PEDOT was the first conducting polymer used as the catalyst for the CE of a DSSC.19 Xia et al. applied a phase polymerization method to synthesize PPy, and applied it on the CE of a DSSC; the synthesized PPy exhibited good electrocatalytic behaviour and rendered an η of 3.4% for the pertinent DSSC.23 Zhang et al. prepared a nanostructure of PANI for the CE of a DSSC, by using a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method, and obtained an η of 4.95% for the cell; on the other hand, the authors obtained an η of 5.41% for their reference cell with Pt CE.24 It is well known that the prices of conducting polymers and CB and of their composites are much less than that of Pt, and that out of these materials, pristine CB is the cheapest. To reduce the fabrication cost of DSSCs, composite materials of carbon and conducting polymer were employed to prepare the CEs of the DSSCs.16,25–27 Peng et al. have developed a composite film of PPy nanorod network and CB nanoparticles as the catalytic layer on the CE of a DSSC, and achieved a higher η of 7.2% for the pertinent DSSC when compared with those of the cells with bare CB (4.3%) and bare PPy (5.0%).15
In this study, three low-cost catalytic films, namely CB, PANI/CB and PPy/CB were prepared by simply drop-coating them on FTO glasses. In order to solve the problem of aggregation of CB in the coating solution, a synthesized poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imide (POEM) was used as the dispersant.28,29 It was found that the POEM has an excellent dispersive ability for CB in an ethanolic solution. The FTO glasses with films of CB, PPy/CB and PANI/CB were used as the CEs for DSSCs. The DSSCs with CEs containing films of CB, PPy/CB and PANI/CB have shown η values of 5.35%, 5.85 ± 0.23% and 6.77 ± 0.13%, respectively. It is also observed that the η of the DSSC with the CE of PANI/CB (6.77 ± 0.13%) is comparable with that of the cell with Pt CE (7.24 ± 0.11%). In almost all the previous reports dealing with composites of conducting polymer and CB as the catalytic materials on the CEs of DSSCs, the conducting polymer was the support (90 wt%) and CB was the minor component (10 wt%); in this study, CB is the support (80 wt%) and conducting polymer is the minor component (20 wt%). This ratio was intended to further reduce the catalytic material cost for a DSSC, because the cost of ordinary carbon material, especially CB, is much cheaper than that of conducting polymer. Another significant point of this report is that the CB could be well dispersed in the coating solution, in spite of the fact that it is the major component of the catalytic film; this is not usually the case in the previous reports. The reason for the complete dispersion of CB is the dispersant POEM, which we have synthesized in our laboratory recently. Finally, the η of the cell with the film of PANI/CB is close to that of the cell with a Pt film.

Synthesis of POEM
The POEM polymer was synthesized through the reaction between POE2000 and ODPA at a molar ratio of 6:5, by the procedure described below. POE2000 (10.00 g, 0.005 mol) in THF (15 ml) was poured into a 100 ml three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, nitrogen inlet–outlet lines, and a thermometer. A solution of ODPA anhydride (1.29 g, 0.004 mol) in THF (10 ml) was added to the content in the flask through a funnel in a drop-wise manner. During the addition, the mixture was stirred vigorously and the reactants were maintained at 150 °C for 3 h. The product mixture was subjected to rotary evaporation under a reduced pressure and was recovered as a yellowish waxy solid. The synthesis of POEM is represented in Scheme 1.

Preparation and characterization of the CEs
The CEs were prepared by coating CB, PANI/CB and PPy/CB on FTO glasses through a drop coating technique; before the coating, the different catalytic materials were well dispersed in their respective coating solutions. In order to optimize the content of POEM to obtain best photovoltaic performance, different wt% of POEM was used with respect to the weight of CB, which was fixed to be 100 mg; in each case, the mixture of CB and POEM was dispersed in 10 ml of ethanol, and this ethanolic mixture was subjected to ultrasonic vibrations for 30 min. Then, the whole solution was stirred for 2 days; after this, the solution was used to coat a catalytic layer of CB on the FTO glass. In addition, to prepare the CEs with PPy/CB and PANI/CB (20 wt% conducting polymer in each case), 100 mg of each of these commercial catalytic materials was dispersed in 10 ml of ethanol, and 1 wt% of POEM, with respect to the weight of the catalytic materials, was added to the solution. This ethanolic mixture was subjected to ultrasonic vibrations and stirring as in the case of CB and was used for drop-coating on the FTO glass in order to obtain the corresponding CEs. Pt CE was prepared by sputtering Pt on the FTO glass for a thickness of 50 nm, which was the best thickness under our experimental conditions, from the perspective of photovoltaic performance of a DSSC.
The electrocatalytic abilities of the CEs were investigated by using CV. CV was carried out in a three-electrode electrochemical system, using the conducting glass electrode (ITO, 7 Ω sq−1, Ritek Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan) with the different catalytic materials as the working electrode, Pt foil as the CE and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode; the electrolyte for the CV experiments contained 10.0 mM I−, 1.0 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN. Symmetric sandwich-type cells was used to investigate the electrocatalytic abilities of the CEs, via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), applying a frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz. The cells consisted of an I−/I3− electrolyte, precisely 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio = 1:1), and two identical electrodes each with an area of 1.0 cm2, separated by a Surlyn® spacer film of 60 μm thick (SX1170-60, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). Impedance spectroscopic data obtained were optimized by fitting to an equivalent circuit using Z-View software. Tafel-polarization curves were obtained with the same symmetric sandwich-type cells by using an electrochemical potentiostat (scan rate: 100 mV s−1).
Furthermore, effective electroactive surface area (Ae) of the different catalytic films and intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant (k0) at these films for the reduction of I3− were quantitatively estimated through a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system, by using Koutecký–Levich equation. The equation is as follows:  (1)where i is the limiting current, n = 2 is the electrons involved in the reaction, F is the Faraday constant, Ae is the electroactive surface area, k0 is the heterogeneous rate constant for I3− reduction reaction, C = 1.0 mM is the concentration of I3−, D = 3.62×10−6 cm2 s−1 is the diffusion coefficient of I3−, γ = 5.0 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 is the kinematic viscosity of ACN, and ω is the angular velocity converted from the rotating speed.
The electrolyte used in the experiment with the RDE was an ACN based solution, containing 0.1 M LiClO4 and 1.0 mM TBAI3. The potentials were referred to the reference electrode of Ag/Ag+. CV curves of the RDE with the films of PANI/CB, PPy/CB, CB, and Pt were obtained in an ACN based electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiClO4 and 1.0 mM TBAI3, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Formal potentials (E0) of the redox couple of I−/I3− were derived from the CV curves (not shown) of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with the catalytic films. The RDE was operated at various rotating speeds of 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 rpm, and a scan rate of 1.0 mV s−1 was applied to obtain linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves. A corresponding current, i, could be obtained from each of the LSV curves at E0. Thus, plots of i−1vs. ω−1/2 were made for the GCE with the different catalytic films.
Fabrication of the DSSCs
A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, 7 Ω sq−1, visible transmittance ≥80%, NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA) was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner, and then washed with DI-water, acetone, and IPA, sequentially. The TiO2 paste and photoanode were prepared based on the procedures reported in our previous literature.29,30 72 ml of TTIP was added to 430 ml of 0.1 M HNO3 with constant stirring, and the contents were heated to 88 °C for 8 h; the mixture was cooled down to the room temperature, and the resultant colloid was filtered and then heated in an autoclave at 240 °C for 12 h. The TiO2 colloid was concentrated to 8.0 wt%; the obtained TiO2 particles were about 20 nm in diameter. Then, PEG (25 wt% with respect to TiO2) was added to the colloid to prevent the film from being cracked during drying. This obtained TiO2 paste was used for coating transparent layers. Moreover, a paste for the scattering layer was made by adding TiO2 powder with larger particle size of 100 nm (PT-501A, Ya Chung Industrial Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) to the above-obtained TiO2 colloid; the weight ratio of the nanoparticle TiO2 and larger particle TiO2 was 1:1 in the colloidal solution for the scattering layer. The conducting surface of the cleaned FTO was treated with a solution of TTIP in 2-methoxyethanol (weight ratio of 1:3); the FTO glass was gradually heated to 450 °C and maintained at that temperature for 30 min to obtain a good mechanical contact between it and the TiO2 film as well as to isolate its conductive surface from the electrolyte. The TiO2 paste was coated on the FTO glass using a doctor-blade technique. Three transparent layers of TiO2 were coated, followed by one scattering layer, using each time a scotch tape. For each coating, the film was dried at 30 °C and then gradually heated to 450 °C in an oxygen atmosphere, and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. The final film had a thickness of 14 μm for the transparent layer and 4.5 μm for the scattering layer, i.e., a total thickness of 18.5 μm. A portion of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 was selected from the final film as the active area by removing the side portions by scrapping. The TiO2 film was immersed in a 5.0 × 10−4 M solution of dye (N719) at room temperature for 24 h. N719 (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was dissolved in ACN and tert-butanol (volume ratio of 1:1) to prepare the dye solution. The above prepared TiO2 electrode was coupled with the CE; these two electrodes were separated by a 60 μm-thick Surlyn® and sealed by heating. A mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio of 1:1) was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte was injected through a gap between the photoanode and the CE by a capillary method.
Measurements and instruments
The number average molecular weight (Mn) of POEM was measured by a gel permeation chromatography technique (GPC; Waters apparatus 515 HPLC pump; 717 auto sampler; 2410 refractive index detector; the Waters style gel columns set). HR2 and HR4E were used with a 1.0 ml min−1 flow rate of THF, calibrated by polystyrene standards (Showa Denko, Shodex Standard SM-105). The UV-absorption spectra of the CB solution with the addition of different wt% of POEM at different periods of time were obtained by using an UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV-VIS-NIR, V670, Jasco Co., Japan). The CB solutions without and with POEM were also applied to the dynamic light scattering measurement (DLS, Brookhaven 90 Plus, nanoparticle particle analyser, Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, New York, USA). The morphologies of different catalytic films on CEs were observed using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI Ultra-High Resolution FE-SEM with low vacuum mode).
The DSSCs were illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (XES-3003S-100, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd., Japan) and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). Photoelectrochemical characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands). EIS was performed by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the DSSC, between the CE and the FTO/TiO2/dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. Impedance spectra were analysed by fitting them to an equivalent circuit model. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained at short-circuit condition. The light source was a quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Japan); light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was moved in steps through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ), as defined below,  IPCE(λ) = 1240(JSC/λφ)(2)where λ is the wavelength, JSC is the short-circuit photocurrent (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2), measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and a power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310).
Results and discussion
Characterization of POEM
The POEM showed a Mn of 13,000 and a polydispersity index of 2.13, as determined by GPC. The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded by a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.79 (ar, d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.32 (ar, s, 1H), 7.15 (ar, d, J = 8.4, 1H), 4.47–4.50 (NH2, 4H), 2.99–3.98 (228H), 0.95–1.36 (CH3, 21H). The ideal structure of POEM, consisting of polar POE (–CH2CH2O–)x segments, aromatic imide (–CONCO–), and amido acids (–CONH–COOH–) is illustrated in Scheme 1. It was reported that the polymer, POEM, is endowed with the ability of dispersing CB in an ethanolic solution, owing to its lone-pair electrons in its POE and imide groups.28,29,31
The dispersive ability of POEM for CB
Previous literature suggests that the distribution of carbon on a substrate is significant in determining the performance of the pertinent DSSC.16,17 Therefore, in order to reduce the aggregation of CB in the ethanolic solution, to be used for coating the CB, POEM was employed as the dispersant in our study. Fig. 1 shows UV–vis absorbance spectra of CB solutions with different wt% of POEM, taken in each case at different intervals of time, i.e., after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h. Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectrum of CB at about 1.8; this spectrum suggests the uniform distribution of CB in ethanolic solution at 0 h in absence of POEM. The CB settles down at a lower level in the solution after 1 h and the absorption values are at about 1.0 at 1 h to 6 h; in other words, the CB was not well dispersed in this case at 1 h and thereafter for 6 h, and so the absorption value is low. In Fig. 1b, with the addition of 0.5 wt% of POEM, the absorption value is the same at 0 h as in the case of Fig. 1a; the absorption value is about 1.6 after 1 h and thereafter for 6 h; this absorption value after 1 h is higher than the corresponding absorption value in the case of zero addition of POEM; this means there is some dispersion of CB with the addition of 0.5 wt% of POEM. In Fig. 1c, with the addition of 1.0 wt% of POEM, the absorption values remained at 1.7 to 1.6, i.e., from 0 h to 6 h the dispersion is almost same and even at a better level that in the case of 0.5 wt% of POEM. It can be seen in Fig. 1a, 1b, and 1c that the absorption values decrease with the increase of time; this means that the dispersion of CB in ethanolic solution decreases with the increase of time in these cases. In Fig. 1d, with the addition of 5.0 wt% of POEM, the absorption values are at about 1.8 for all the times; that is the dispersion is much higher compared to those of the first three cases, and the dispersed carbon remained stable even for 6 h. Fig. 1e and Fig. 1f show absorption values of 2.2 and 2.5, with the additions of 10.0 wt% and 15.0 wt% of POEM, respectively; this means the dispersions in these cases are much higher, compared to those in the first four cases. Steady values of absorption in all the cases of Fig. 1d, Fig. 1e, and Fig. 1f for all the times of measurements of absorption indicate that the dispersion remained stable for all the 6 h in all these cases of higher addition of the POEM. The last three cases confirm the excellent dispersive ability of POEM for CB.
 Fig. 1  UV–vis absorbance spectra of CB solutions with the addition of (a) 0 wt%, (b) 0.5 wt%, (c) 1.0 wt%, (d) 5.0 wt%, (e) 10.0 wt%, and (f) 15.0 wt% of POEM; in each case the spectra were measured at different periods of time. 
Fig. S2a, ESI† shows photograph of the CB solutions, one without POEM and the other with 5.0 wt% of POEM, at the beginning, i.e., at 0 h; Fig. S2b, ESI† shows the photograph of the same solutions after 24 h. It can be seen in Fig. S2b, ESI† that the carbon settles down at the bottom of the container in absence of the POEM; on the contrary, the CB in the container with 5.0 wt% of POEM remains well distributed in the solution. In other words the POEM has acted as an excellent dispersant for CB; this observation is in consistency with the UV–vis absorbance spectra in Fig. 1.
The size distributions of CB particles in the ethanolic solutions with and without POEM were confirmed by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique, which yields the average diameter of particles in a solution.32,33 We used two kinds of ethanolic solution, that is solutions containing CB without and with 5.0 wt% of POEM. The size distributions in both the cases are shown in Fig. 2. The mean diameters of CB in the ethanolic solutions with and without POEM are 418.1 and 99,896.4 nm, respectively. The CB particles without POEM exhibit sizes in the range of 34,753.5 to 212,206.6 nm (range of diameter, Δd = 177,453.1 nm), while those with 5.0 wt% of POEM show a range of 207.2 to 728.7 nm (range of diameter, Δd = 521.5 nm); this phenomenon is due to the fact that the CB is well dispersed in the solution with POEM.
 Fig. 2  The particle size distribution for CB in the ethanolic solution without and with 5.0 wt% of POEM, measured by DLS method. 
To examine the dispersive ability of the POEM, SEM images of the CB films prepared without and with 5.0 wt% of POEM were obtained. Fig. 3a and 3b show SEM images of the films, obtained by dropping the CB solutions without POEM and with 5.0 wt% of POEM on FTO glasses, respectively. The CB film without POEM exhibits serious aggregations, with large clusters. On the other hand, the CB film with POEM shows an uniform distribution of small particles and hardly any cluster. These SEM images clearly prove the dispersive ability of POEM.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs with CEs containing CB, obtained through the use of different wt% of POEM are shown in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The DSSC with the CE containing CB obtained without the use of POEM shows a η of only 3.75%, while the cell with CB obtained by using 1.0 wt% of POEM as the dispersant shows an η of 5.35%. The far superior performance in the latter case is obviously due to the use of POEM as the dispersant for CB during the preparation for the CE. The action of POEM for this higher performance is contributed to its dispersive ability for CB. Among the DSSCs, whose CEs were obtained through the use of POEM, the JSC and η increase with the increasing amount of POEM up to 1.0 wt%; this is obviously due to better dispersibility of the CB with increased amount of POEM, which favours an aggregation-free film of CB on the CE. On the other hand, the JSC and the η decrease steadily with the increase of POEM above 1.0 wt% up to 15.0 wt%. The films of CB with higher amounts of the polymer POEM beyond 1.0 wt% have apparently become more non-conductive for electron transfer, because POEM is not a conducting polymer. In this connection, it is to be remembered that the POEM was not removed from the final CB film on the CE. The DSSC with the CE obtained using 1.0 wt% POEM shows the best η of 5.35%. Fig. 4b shows the IPCE curves of the DSSCs with different wt% of POEM. The cell with 1.0 wt% of POEM shows the maximum IPCE value of 66.6% at the wavelength of 530 nm. All the IPCE values are perfectly consistent with the corresponding JSC values.

Moreover, EIS was employed to analyse the interfacial resistances of the DSSCs. Fig. 5 shows Nyquist plots of the cells with CEs containing CB obtained by using different wt% of POEM. The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of the figure. In general, the impedance spectrum of a DSSC shows three semicircles in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The first, second and third semicircles correspond to the charge-transfer resistances at the interface of CE/electrolyte (Rct1), at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (Rct2) and to the Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (Rdiff), respectively. However, in our work, the semicircle for Rdiff is virtually overlapped by the semicircle for Rct2 due to the low viscosities of the solvents used in the electrolyte (viscosities of ACN and MPN are 0.37 cp and 1.60 cp, respectively). The values of Rct1 are given in Table 1. It can be seen that the value of Rct1 decreases when POEM increases from 0 wt% to 1.0 wt%, and then it increases steeply with further increase in the amount of POEM up to 15.0 wt%. This decreasing and increasing trend of the value of Rct1 is in perfect consistency with the increasing and decreasing trend of JSC; in other words, the JSC increases with the decrease of Rct1 and then decreases with the increase of Rct1. The smallest value of Rct1 is observed in the case of the cell with 1.0 wt% of POEM, which is consistent with the highest JSC value of the cell. Thus, 1.0 wt% of POEM was found to be its optimum quantity to be added in the coating solution of CB to obtain the best cell performance. In further studies, the amount of POEM is 1.0 wt%, unless and otherwise specifically mentioned.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with CEs containing conducting polymer/CB and 1.0 wt% of POEM

Fig. 6 shows the J–V and IPCE curves of the DSSCs with CEs containing the films of Pt and CB, and the composite films of PANI/CB and PPy/CB; the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The cell parameters for the cells with CEs containing films of PANI/CB, PPy/CB and Pt were averaged with three measurements. The η's of the DSSCs with PPy/CB and PANI/CB are 5.85 ± 0.23% and 6.77 ± 0.13%, respectively, which are better than that of the cell with only CB (5.35%); this means that the polymers have helped to increase the catalytic activities of the CEs with CB or their conductivities for electron transfer; an improvement in the reflectivity of the film of CB, which also could contribute for a better JSC, is not considered in this case, because of the non-conductive nature of the polymers. This explanation is validated from the fact that the JSC's of the cells with the composite films are higher than that of the cell with bare CB. Moreover, the η of the DSSC with PANI/CB (6.77 ± 0.13%) is comparable to that of the cell with sputtered Pt (7.24 ± 0.11%). This cell with sputtered Pt shows the highest IPCE value of 80.5% at the wavelength of 530 nm and JSC value of 16.94 ± 0.29 mA cm−2, while the cell with PANI/CB shows the next best IPCE value of 75.4% and JSC value of 16.62 ± 0.25 mA cm−2. Through the integration of IPCE curves, we obtained a photocurrent density value of about 15 mA cm−2 for the DSSC with a Pt counter electrode, while we obtained a value of 16.94 ± 0.29 mA cm−2 through photocurrent measurement. This small discrepancy is due to the fact that we used a water filter in the case of IPCE measurements, but did not use the same while measuring the photocurrents.34 EIS was employed to study Rct1 for the DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 7.The Rct1 values are given in Table 2. The values of Rct1 are perfectly consistent with the values of JSC, i.e., the less the Rct1 value, the more the JSC value. It is clear from the table that the cells with the composite films show higher JSC's and higher η's, compared to those of the cell with bare CB film. The higher η's of the cells with the composite films are to be attributed to the higher electrocatalytic abilities of the films, with reference to that of the CB film. These higher electrocatalytic abilities are consistent with the corresponding lower values of Rct1.

Surface morphologies of different catalytic films
SEM images of the films of PANI/CB and PPy/CB without and with 1.0 wt% of POEM and of the film of CB with 1.0 wt% of POEM are shown in Fig. 8; a SEM image is also shown in the figure for a Pt film. The films of PANI/CB and PPy/CB obtained in the absence of POEM exhibit serious aggregations, with large clusters. (Fig. 8a and 8c); on the other hand those films obtained with the use of POEM show a uniform distribution of small particles and hardly any cluster (Fig. 8b and 8d). The CB film obtained assisted by POEM shows a uniform distribution of small particles and hardly any cluster (Fig. 8e). The Pt film shows a very smooth surface (Fig. 8f) with very small Pt particles on the film. This morphology with very small Pt particles usually shows very high surface area and thereby very high electrocatalytic activity for the redox couple of I−/I3−. In addition, porous structures can be seen for the films of CB, PANI/CB, and PPy/CB (Fig. 8e, 8b and 8d) that were obtained by using POEM. Though the surface areas of these films may not be as high as that of Pt film, their porous structures can provide many electrocatalytically active sites, and thereby can facilitate the electrocatalytic activity for I−/I3− in the electrolyte,11,35 which is beneficial to enhance the performance of their cells. These SEM images clearly prove the dispersive ability of POEM.

Electrocatalytic activities of CEs containing different catalytic materials-CV analysis
In order to investigate the reaction kinetics and electrocatalytic abilities of the CEs with different catalytic materials, CV curves were obtained, using a three-electrode electrochemical system, as shown in Fig. 9. The kinetic reaction at the interface of the CE with the electrolyte is shown in eqn (3) as follows,22 I3− + 2e− → 3I−(3)
 Fig. 9  CV of the electrodes with the films of Pt and CB and the composite films of PANI/CB and PPy/CB with 1.0 wt% of POEM. 
In the CV curve, the cathodic peak current density (Ipc) corresponds to the reaction rate of the catalyst for the reduction of I3− ions to I− ions. In general, higher Ipc implies better electrocatalytic ability of the catalytic material.10 It is clear from the CV that the composite films (PANI/CB and PPy/CB) exhibit higher Ipc's than that of the CB film; this observation implies that the CEs with PANI/CB and PPy/CB have higher electrocatalytic abilities than that of the CE with CB. The higher values of JSC of the cells with the composite films are in consistency with the higher electrocatalytic abilities of these films.
The CE with sputtered Pt shows nearly the same Ipc as those of the CEs with the composite films; the corresponding JSC's do not differ much in these cases. Therefore, in order to further investigate the electrocatalytic abilities of the CEs, EIS and Tafel polarization plots were obtained through the use of a symmetric cell in which two identical electrodes with the films of Pt and CB and the composite films of PANI/CB and PPy/CB were used.
Electrocatalytic activities of different catalytic materials-EIS and Tafel polarization analyses
The charge transfer resistances (Rct) for the reduction of I3− ions at the interfaces of the films of Pt and CB and the composite films of PANI/CB and PPy/CB with the electrolyte were investigated by EIS, using a symmetric cell consisting of two identical electrodes. Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plots of the electrodes with Pt, CB, PANI/CB and PPy/CB; the equivalent circuit is shown in the figure as an inset. The first semicircle in the middle frequency range (105–10 Hz) represents the resistance against the heterogeneous electron transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface (Rct). The second semicircle in the low frequency range (10–0.1 Hz) represents the resistance against the Warburg diffusion process (Zw) within the electrolyte. The values of Rct and Zw were evaluated by fitting the impedance spectra in the equivalent circuit, and are given in Table 3. The Rct values of PPy/CB (11.94 Ω cm2) and PANI/CB (6.85 Ω cm2) are lower than that of pristine CB (16.58 Ω cm2); the Zw values of PPy/CB (10.97 Ω cm2) and PANI/CB (6.58 Ω cm2) are similarly lower than that of pristine CB (16.63 Ω cm2); the corresponding JSC, FF, VOC, η values are consistent with these Rct and Zw values (Table 2 and Table 3). The DSSC with the film of PANI/CB shows the best η of 6.77 ± 0.13%, owing to its highest VOC, JSC, and FF among the cells with the CB. It is interesting to note that the value of Zw does depend on the kind of CE. This is consistent with the literature,36 as Zw is affected by the porous textures and the thickness of the CE.

In order to further confirm the electrocatalytic abilities of the catalytic films, Tafel polarization analysis was made using symmetric cells, in which two identical electrodes with the films of Pt, CB, PANI/CB and PPy/CB were employed. Fig. 11 shows plots of logarithmic current density (Log I) versus potential (V). A Tafel curve can be divided into three zones; the curve portion at low potentials (|V| < 120 mV) represents the polarization zone, the curve portion at the middle potentials (with a sharp slope) represents the Tafel zone and the curve portion at the high potentials (horizontal part) represents the diffusion zone. We can evaluate the exchange current density (I0) from the region of Tafel zone, using the following equation,10,37–39 (4)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− ions to I− ions, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance. The exchange current density (I0) of an electrode, which can be obtained from the Tafel zone, is tantamount to the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode. The values of Rct were evaluated and given in Table 3. The electrodes with CB, PPy/CB, PANI/CB and Pt show Rct values of 11.83, 8.12, 4.54, and 2.23 Ω cm2, respectively. The small Rct (4.54 Ω cm2) of the CE with PANI/CB is consistent with its best performance, among the carbon electrodes, in terms of the efficiency of its DSSC. The Pt electrode with the lowest Rct (2.23 Ω cm2) of all shows even better performance than the best among carbon electrodes.
 Fig. 11  Tafel polarization plots of the electrodes with PANI/CB, PPy/CB, CB with 1.0 wt% of POEM and Pt, obtained using symmetrical cells with two identical electrodes. 
Moreover, at a low sweep rate, the limiting current density (Jlim) depends on the diffusion coefficient (D) of the I3− species by means of eqn (5):38 (5)where l is the spacer thickness, C is the concentration of I3−, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− ions to I− ions, and F is Faraday's constant. Through eqn (5), it can be seen that D can be determined from Jlim. Therefore, it can be concluded through Fig. 11 that the values of D for those four catalytic materials are different. Among the symmetric cells, the cell with Pt shows a higher D of the redox couple, compared to the cells with PANI/CB, PPy/CB, and CB. The results obtained through Tafel polarization measurement also confirm that different catalytic CEs would influence the values of Zw.
Electrocatalytic activities of different catalytic materials – RDE analysis
In a DSSC, the catalyst layer on the CE should possess both a high electrocatalytic activity and a high electroactive surface area. However, CV and Tafel polarization curves cannot distinguish these two parameters simultaneously and just reveal the overall electrocatalytic activity of the CE. These two parameters can be determined at the same time by using RDE, through LSV. We have estimated the value of k0 and the Ae for the films with CB, PPy/CB, PANI/CB and Pt, by using a RDE. Fig. 12 shows the plots of i−1vs. ω−1/2 for the RDE with the films of CB, PPy/CB, PANI/CB and Pt. The values of k0 and Ae were calculated for these films from the intercept and the slope of y-axis, respectively, by using the Koutecký–Levich equation. The values of k0 and Ae are given in Table 3. It can be seen in the table that the Ae are much higher in the cases of the composite films (PPy/CB, PANI/CB), compared to that of the carbon film; these Ae of the composite films are consistent with their higher electrocatalytic activities. The kinetic parameter of k0 can be considered as the intrinsic electrocatalytic ability of a catalytic film. It can be seen in the table that the value of k0 is higher for the composite films, compared to that of the carbon film; this higher k0 is again consistent with their higher electrocatalytic abilities than that of the carbon film. The electrode with PANI/CB shows the highest k0 (3.38 × 10−3 cm s−1) among the carbon electrodes and correspondingly the highest photovoltaic parameters (Table 3). The Pt electrode with the highest k0 (4.89 × 10−3 cm s−1) of all shows even better performance than the best among carbon electrodes. It is interesting to note that the performance of the DSSC with PPy/CB is lower than that of the cell with PANI/CB, although the PPy/CB shows a higher Ae (0.960 cm2) than that of PANI/CB (0.586 cm2); this result may be attributed to the higher values of Zw (10.97 Ω cm2) and Rct (8.12 Ω cm2) of the CE with PPy/CB than the values of Zw (6.58 Ω cm2) and Rct (4.54 Ω cm2) of the CE with PANI/CB, and also to the lower value of k0 (3.31 × 10−3 cm s−1) of the CE with PPy/CB than the value of k0 (3.38 × 10−3 cm s−1) of the CE with PANI/CB.

Conclusions
In this study, POEM was synthesized and used as the dispersant for preparing well-dispersed CB, PANI/CB, PPy/CB solutions; these solutions were drop-coated on FTO glasses to prepare the corresponding CEs for DSSCs. The CB-based DSSC showed a better η of 5.35% with the addition of 1.0 wt% of POEM as the dispersant than the cell without the dispersant (η) of 3.75%). The DSSCs with PANI/CB and PPy/CB and the dispersant showed better η of 6.77 ± 0.13% and 5.85 ± 0.23%, respectively, higher than the cell with CB. The CEs with the films of PANI/CB and PPy/CB have shown better electrocatalytic abilities (CV and Tafel plots), lower Rct (EIS, Tafel plots), lower Zw (EIS) and higher D (Tafel plots), improved from that of the CE with the film of CB. Higher values of k0 and Ae of the electrodes with PANI/CB and PPy/CB than with CB only were consistent with the better performances of these cells. All the IPCE values are perfectly consistent with the corresponding JSC values. It is noteworthy that the best η of the DSSC with PANI/CB on its CE (6.77 ± 0.13%) is comparable to that of the cell with Pt on its CE (7.24 ± 0.11%). To replace Pt by PANI/CB seems promising, considering the catalyst performance and the efficiency of a DSSC. Total elimination of the expensive Pt by using POEM dispersed CB/polymer represents an advance of developing precious metal-free solar cells.
