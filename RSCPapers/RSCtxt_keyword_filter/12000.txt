    , Accepted 11th May 2018First published on 12th May 2018AbstractOwing hysteresis free characteristics and good reproducibility, inverted p-i-n perovskite solar cells (PSC) are gaining large interest in the photovoltaic field. In this context, the need for stable materials calls for the development of robust transporting layers compatible with the fabrication processes of the solar cell. In this study, we introduce a new precursor, tris(ethylene diamine) nickel acetate, for low temperature (280–300 °C) deposition of NiO hole transporting layer. Full characterization of the deposited NiO film layer was performed through XRD, Raman and Auger spectroscopy. We found a direct correlation between device performance and NiO thickness with maximum efficiency exceeding 15% for the thin NiO (10 nm) layer.
Introduction
Unprecedented progress in the development of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSC) has attracted the attention of the scientific community even beyond the photovoltaics (PVs) field. The rapid growth in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% in the pioneering study conducted in 20091 to the current certified record PCE of 22.7%2 shows that PSC technology is on par with more traditional Si, CiGS and CdTe solar cells.3–5 The highest device performances were achieved using mesoscopic n-i-p architecture,6 where light is impinged on the n-side of the cell, that is, from the electron transporting layer (ETL) side, and a mesoscopic scaffold is used to grow the perovskite absorber layer. ETLs, typically based on TiO2, suffer from interface degradation and instability caused by absorption of ultraviolet light.7–9 UV absorption tends to increase in the concentration of trap states and parasitic charge accumulation that contributes to hysteresis effects10–12 and affects the overall stability of the cell.13 Moreover, hole transport materials (HTMs) used for highly efficient PSCs,14 such as SPIRO-OMeTAD, require Li and/or Co based salts doping to increase hole conductivity,15,16 which in turn, can compromise cell stability, leading to PSC degradation,17,18 extrinsic ion migration19 and charge trapping near the HTM.20
One of the strategies to avoid the limitations of n-i-p configuration described above consists of constructing the inverted (p-i-n) PSC architecture.21 In this case, the light is impinged from the HTM side, which can be realized with polyelectrolytes (e.g., PEDOT:PSS),22 polymers (e.g., PTAA)23 and inorganic materials.24 As discussed in several studies,25,26 p-i-n devices with inorganic HTMs have better interface stability and lower material costs in comparison to n-i-p structures. A number of inorganic HTMs such as copper thiocyanate (CuSCN),27,28 copper iodide (CuI),29 and metal oxides (V2O5,30 CuO31,32 MoOx33 and NiO34,35) have shown very promising device performance.
In this study, we focused on NiO, which is considered a thermally stable hole transport layer (HTL) for p-i-n devices that induces negligible hysteresis36 and consequently, maximum power output.37 Moreover, as shown by Corani et al,38 NiO provides ultrafast hole injection dynamics at the interface with MAPbI3 due to good energy level alignment.
Concerning PSCs with NiO HTL, Yanagida et al.39 performed calculations of the carrier flux in NiO from the Einstein–Smoluchowski relation and determined that NiO is able to compensate the photo-generated current density in perovskite layers up to a maximum theoretical value of 26 mA cm−2. This limit has not yet been achieved in fabricated PSCs with NiO, showing the importance of further optimizations of this inorganic HTL by improving material purity and crystallinity. Vacuum processing, such as magnetron sputtering and ALD, can realize excellent material purity, but will raise the production costs and simultaneously make manufacturing integration more complex. Recently, NiO HTL with Cu,40 Li,41 and Cs42 doping have been considered to improve charge transport and collection in inverted PSCs, reaching a top PCE of 19%. For most cases, incorporation of metal dopants increases local conductivity, enhances photoluminescence quenching and raises hole mobility.
Solution-process formation of NiO on top of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer requires an appropriate precursor solution and subsequent thermal treatment to achieve optimal morphology of the films. One of the common ways to obtain an NiO film is decomposition of its complex compounds.43–47 Changing the composition of the complex salt by changing the anion or ligands can significantly influence the decomposition temperature, which is typically in the range of 300–750 °C.48–56 A low temperature (LT) process is highly desirable to permit the use of polymeric substrates for flexible PSCs.57 Moreover, a high decomposition temperature will negatively impact the price of the solar panel, which is determined not only by the cost of materials used for its fabrication, but also by the amount of energy used at each stage of the production process. Thus, in addition to switching to cheaper materials, it is necessary to reduce energy consumption at each step of the manufacturing process in order to decrease energy payback time.58
Conventionally, to decrease the formation temperature of a nickel oxide compact layer, ligands such as ethylene diamine, pyridine, and other low molecular weight nitrogen-containing organic substances have been used.59,60 A solution processed Cs-doped NiO HTL with a precursor decomposition temperature of 275 °C, was demonstrated by Djurisic et al.42 The group used ethanolamine as a complex builder for the NiO precursor and achieved a PCE > 19%. You et al.61 presented improved air stability (PCE ∼ 16% during 60 days) using an inverted PSC with undoped NiO HTL obtained by decomposing nickel nitrate with ethylene diamine at 300 °C. Approximately the same level of performance was presented by Groeneveld et al.62 with a nickel formate dihydrate precursor for HTL fabrication. A different process with higher decomposition temperature (350 °C) was shown by Yin et al.63 using pure nickel nitrate hexahydrate. Other LT NiO deposition approaches were proposed using self-assembling nanoparticles64 or vacuum processing.65 We should point out, however, that thermal decomposition of NiO with a process temperature as low as 200 °C has been reported by Kaya et al.66 However, the azide derivatives used in this process are extremely explosive and their decomposition leaves traces of nickel oxide; thus, the direct application to PSCs is not favorable. Thus, the search for novel precursors of NiO providing an LT deposition of this HTL is an active area of research and development for low temperature p-i-n perovskites. We should point out that the interface between NiO and perovskite also determines the final performance of the solar cell through interface trap density, energy level alignment, grain size, passivation and materials purity.67–69 For this reason, a detailed assessment of the interface quality is required when discussing NiO based PSCs.
In this study, we introduce a new precursor route for the formation of NiO HTL based on commercially available nickel acetate complex with ethylene diamine. This precursor exhibits a decomposition temperature of around 280–300 °C while still maintaining good cell performance and without the use of dopants. To support our new deposition strategy, we performed the complete characterization of the nickel oxide film, including precursor decomposition parameters, reaction yield and Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, depth-profiling analyses using Auger spectroscopy data confirm the phase, elemental composition of the layers and the well-defined interfaces between perovskite/NiO and NiO/FTO. Device output performance was promising with PCE > 15% and negligible hysteresis.
Results and discussion
The new NiO precursor (image S1 in ESI†), tris(ethylenediamine) nickel acetate (TED-NiA), was obtained by a two-step method, as depicted in Fig. 1(a) and described in the experimental section. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), as shown in Fig. 1(b), confirms the synthesis of the precursor with typical peaks related to amine groups (3400–3000 cm−1), CO– (1730 cm−1) and CH2– (2840–2865 cm−1 and 2916–2936 cm−1). Due to the facile synthesis of precursor crystals obtained from evaporation of the reaction mixture, the compounds with water in the coordination sphere could be present. This was confirmed by thermogravimetric (TGA) study of TED-NiA, presented in Fig. 1(c). Individual steps of the process were determined by fitting the weight loss derivative with respect to temperature (derivative weight curve) with Gaussian curves. The first 3 peaks (65 °C, 157 °C and 195 °C) are related to moisture desorption, and crystalline water and water evaporation from the coordination sphere of Ni, respectively. The fourth and fifth peaks (at 215 °C and 252 °C) of the derivative weight are related to the decomposition of dehydrated TED-NiA into compact nickel oxide film. This process involves the formation of solid nickel oxide, accompanied with the production of CO, CO2, H2O and N2 gases. We can consider nickel oxide reduction reaction due to the presence of CO, which is related to acetate salt decomposition.70 Moreover, this process is clearly proven by the presence of two endothermal peaks on the heat flow curve at 215 °C and 252 °C. It should also be noted that some carbon could dissolve in nickel metal after the reduction process, leading to the formation of solid solution or nickel carbides.71 Nonetheless, the TGA curve shows that maximum weight loss rate is attained at 250 °C and full TED-NiA decomposition into nickel oxide is completed at 280 °C.

The formation of NiO layer is also confirmed by the Raman spectrum reported in Fig. 2(a), where the peaks are mainly related to NiO.72 To further investigate the chemical composition of the produced nickel oxide compact layer and to identify additional compounds formed after the decomposition of TED-NiA, we performed Auger electron spectroscopy measurements, shown in Fig. 2(b). Auger data revealed the presence of a comparable amount of carbon, besides nickel and oxygen, and a negligible percentage of chlorine, which remains from the initial nickel chloride. The presence of carbon could be related to the dissolved carbon in the nickel metal phase. Moreover, carbon and hydrocarbons can be adsorbed during formation of the layer from ambient atmosphere and remain after the decomposition process of the TED-NiA complex. The presence of nitrogen was not detected, which is a clear indication of the decay of the coordination sphere. Investigation of the distribution of the basic elements by Auger depth profiling (Fig. 2(c)) shows that nickel penetrates into the substrate and presents a partially pure metal form. The concentration of carbon in the NiO layer is significant and grows toward the surface of the oxide layer up to 70 at%. In order to determine surface quality, we performed high-resolution (HR) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, as presented in Fig. 2(d) together with a 3D AFM reconstruction (Fig. S2, ESI†). HR SEM was performed for NiO films on polished silicon substrates, while 3D reconstruction was performed for NiO films on FTO glass. We obtained a continuous film with surface uniformity on the scale of tens of nanometers, confirming that NiO film closely follows the morphology of the substrate surface.

The thickness of this NiO layer was varied from 27 nm to 10 nm by changing the concentration of TED-NiA precursor from 2.0 M to 1.0 M. The relation between precursor concentration and the final film thickness is reported in Fig. 3(a). Further decreasing the TED-NiA concentration did not provide a sufficiently compact HTL film to permit fabrication of the PSC stack without microscopic pinholes.

XRD pattern of the 27 nm-thick NiO compact layer on Si wafer (Fig. S3, ESI†) shows the presence of pure nickel in the film, which is a product of nickel oxide reduction by CO gas produced in TED-NiA's decomposition stage. The pattern also shows low intensity nickel oxide bands, which could be explained by the fact that the coherent scattering region of NiSO nanocrystals is most likely less than 5 nanometers, which is close to the detection limit of the method. Pure nickel and nickel oxide XRD peaks determination conformed with the data from previous studies of this material.73,74 Moreover, as demonstrated by the Auger profile (Fig. 2(c)), metallic Ni was placed at the interface between NiO and silicon. We conclude that nickel oxide film is passivates the pure nickel phase and stabilizes the compact layer.
In order to assess the hole extraction properties of NiO, we recorded the photoluminescence (PL) spectra on glass/FTO/NiO/MAPI stack with different thicknesses of NiO layers. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the presence of NiO induces clear quenching of PL with respect to pure MAPI film, indicating a reduction in radiative recombination of the generated electron-holes and enhanced hole extraction when NiO HTL is used. Moreover, PL quenching is higher for a NiO thickness of 10 nm, while it reduces for higher thicknesses. As already reported for GO HTL75 and ZnO ETL,76 the higher quenching of PL for the thinnest NiO layer is related to reduction of NiO resistance by decreasing thickness of the HTL. To prove this, we performed conductance measurements while varying NiO thickness. Diode structures were fabricated on FTO substrates with gold cathode and NiO film sandwiched in between. The relation between JV characteristics and NiO thickness is presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Despite Schottky diode type structure used for testing, the JV curves showed resistor behavior without rectification due to the small thicknesses of the semiconductor (∼tens of nm) that permit the formation of an Ohmic contact between NiO and FTO, as also found for the same thin film diode structure.77 As expected, a clear increase in resistance (reduction of the JV curve slope) is found by increasing the NiO thickness. Resistivity values extracted from diode JV curves (calculated with eqn (S1) and presented in Table S1, ESI†) are in the range of 182–340 kOhm cm, which was in good agreement with the results reported by Jlassi et al.78 for solution processed NiO. These values of NiO resistivity can also be attributed to the presence of impurities. As we can see from Auger data in Fig. 2(a) and (b), besides NiO, HTL also contains nickel chlorine, carbides and probably carbonates, which were not completely removed during decomposition of TED-NiA. Such impurities can harm charge transport, create trap states and warp the crystal structure. Similar effects of side impurities containment (Ni(OH)2, Ni2O3) have been reported by Icli et al.79
Moreover, we found a reduction in resistivity by decreasing the NiO thickness (Fig. 3(a)). This could be attributed to the increase in charge density by reducing the NiO thickness as reported by Thimsen et al.77
An additional feature of the PL spectra is related to the peak position, which blue shifts from 782 nm in the glass/perovskite to 772 nm in the glass/NiO (10 nm)/perovskite. PL peak shift has been observed several times for NiO HTL in PSCs,61,80 but only a few explanations have been provided. This effect has been mainly related to passivation of trap states.81–83 However, the presence of pure nanosized nickel in HTL (defined previously by XRD and Auger) can induce the plasmon effect, which is typical for metal nanoparticles.84 Nickel nanoparticles85,86 absorb light in the visible region and therefore can shift the PL peak, as presented by Liu et al.87 for Ag nanoparticles. This suggestion should be proved and confirmed with additional investigation, which is beyond the scope of the present study. In any case, the MAPI/NiO/FTO interface is well defined and sharp, as demonstrated by the Auger depth profile recorded for the glass/FTO/NiO/MAPI stack (Fig. S6, ESI†).
Devices were fabricated in inverted planar configuration considering the FTO/NiO/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Al stack sequence, as presented in Fig. 4(a), together with the schematic band diagram (Fig. 5(b)) and cross section (Fig. 5(c)). The NiO HTL was deposited following the developed decomposition process described in the previous section. The measured photovoltaic parameters are reported in Fig. 5(a–d) and Table S2 (ESI†) for several NiO thicknesses. The average PCE of the as-fabricated cells increases from ∼10% with 28 nm-thick NiO film to ∼14.82% when film thickness was reduced to 10 nm.

The JV characteristics of the most efficient cell are reported in Fig. 6, showing a PCE of 15.31%. We observed a strong correlation between HTL thickness and short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill-factor (FF) values. With NiO thickness of 27 nm, the PSCs show poor performances, with an average Jsc = 17.76 mA cm−2 and an average FF = 0.51. By increasing the NiO thickness to 16 nm, PSC characteristics were improved, achieving an average Jsc of 18.38 mA cm−2 (+3.5% with respect to PSCs with NiO thickness of 27 nm) and an average FF of 0.57 (+11.8%). The best results were obtained with the thinnest layer of NiO (10 nm), with an average Jsc = 19.68 mA cm−2 (+10.8%) and a large increase of average FF to 0.74 (+45%). These improvements occurred with significant series resistance (Rs) reduction (presented in Table S2, ESI†) that corresponds to higher ohmicity of NiO-FTO junction for thinner NiO HTL, as presented in Fig. 4. The open circuit voltage (Voc) values show behaviour similar to other J–V parameters, with best values achieved for 1.0 M TED-NiA concentration although the increase in Voc by reducing the thickness of NiO film from 27 nm to 10 nm is only 4%. The spread of PV parameters is mainly related to local uneven film thickness caused by FTO surface roughness (typically ∼50 nm for used TEC-8), which is not levelled by thin NiO films. JV characteristics presented in Fig. 6 show negligible hysteresis with a hysteresis index <0.02 (calculated from eqn (S2), ESI†). Also, by varying the scan rates (22 mV s−1, 135 mV s−1, and 345 mV s−1), hysteresis remains negligible, as shown in Fig. S5(a–c) (ESI†). Attempts to decrease NiO thickness below 10 nm by further diluting TED-NiA concentration resulted in reduced PSC performance due to a significant decrease in shunt resistance (FF < 0.35) caused by pinholes in the NiO film. Shelf-life stability measurements (Fig. S7, ESI†) were performed in a glovebox over 12 days. While Voc and Jsc values were stable, FF lost ∼30% of the initial value, and consequently affected the PCE. Stabilization of the device requires specific optimizations in the perovskite,88,89 HTL,90 interface engineering91 and metal diffusion.92,93 Moreover, the observed stability behavior is quite similar to that reported for pin cells not optimized for stability.90,94–96 Thus, all the optimization procedures outlined above can improve the stability for PSCs with our as-prepared NiO film.

EQE spectra (Fig. 7) were measured for the best performing device made with the 10 nm-thick NiO layer. The EQE calculated Jsc is 20.18 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the JV measurements at 1 sun (Jsc = 19.68 mA cm−2). We should point out that EQE spectrum presents losses in short wavelength region (350–450 nm), which is typical for p-i-n MAPbI3 devices, and is caused by the parasitic absorption by the NiO film.97

Experimental
NiO precursor synthesis
All analytical grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
We used nickel chloride (NiCl2) as a precursor to produce colloidal nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) by precipitation in alkaline medium. Freshly prepared nickel hydroxide was rinsed 3 times with deionized water until the supernatant became discolored. Then, the supernatant was dried to a paste, which was used without further drying. Nickel acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2·xH2O) was produced by dissolving the paste in 70% acetic acid. The resulting product was purified by recrystallization. Tris(ethylenediamine)nickel complex (TED-NiA) was obtained by direct reaction of 2 g of nickel acetate (Ni(CHCOOH)2·xH2O) with 10 mL of ethylenediamine according to eqn (1). The solution changed colour from green to violet, indicating the formation of the complex. The as-obtained TED-NiA was purified by recrystallization. Ni(CH3COOH)2·xH2O + 3C2H8N2 = [Ni(C2H8N2)3](CH3COOH)2(1)
We analyzed the thermal decomposition of the as-obtained nickel complex using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine water content and decomposition temperature. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to confirm the transition of nickel acetate to nickel ethylenediamine complex.
Material, films and device characterization
TGA data was obtained with SDT TA Q600 thermal analyzer. Samples were analyzed in ramp heating mode up to 500 °C and the heating rate was set to 10 °C min−1. IR spectra were measured on a Thermo Nicolet 380 instrument with smart iTR attachment and diamond ATR crystal. All the spectra were recorded using 32 scans. Spectral range was 650–4000 cm−1.
Raman spectra were measured on Thermo DXR Raman Microscope with 523 nm laser. Measurements were carried out with laser power set to 10 mW.
XRD patterns were collected with tabletop X-ray spectrometer ‘Difray’ with chromium Kα radiation.
SEM images were acquired with a JEOL JSM7600F system. Cross section was obtained by using FIB and measured with a FEI Quanta.
Photoluminescence measurements were performed on Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 550 nm.
NiO film thickness was measured on a micro interferometer system (LOMO MII-4) on polished Si substrates with a metal film on the top.
Auger investigation was performed by Auger nanoprobe PHI-680 (Physical Electronics). The energy of the primary electron beam was E0 = 10 keV with a current of 10 nA. For sputtering, we used an argon ion gun with primary beam energy of 2 keV, current of −1.4 μA, and rastering of 1 × 1 mm (vsput = 20 nm min−1 for SiO2).

JV curves were measured under standard conditions of 1.5 AM G illumination and 100 mW cm−2 of irradiance intensity using a Newport ABB solar simulator (calibrated with certified Si cell and Ophir irradiance meter). Scan sweeps were performed with Keithley 2400 SMU and Labview software. A voltage step of 23.5 mV was used for each sweep with a settling time of 10−2 s.
External quantum efficiency spectra were measured with a QEX10 system from PV measurements (calibration by Si certified cell).
Perovskite ink preparation
Perovskite ink was prepared in 1.5 M concentration in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF from Sigma Aldrich) with CH3NH3I (MAI, 99.99% purity from GreatCellSolar) and PbI2 (ultrapure 99.999% from TCI). The precursor was heated for 1 hour at 70 °C and then cooled to room temperature prior to use.
Solar cell fabrication
Solar cells were fabricated in planar inverted architecture on pixelated FTO glass substrates (TEC-8 from Kintec). First, substrates were sonicated in acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol, and then activated under UV-ozone treatment for 20 minutes. NiO HTL was decomposed from spin coated TED-NiA. The procedure was the same for all 3 concentrations (1.0 M, 1.5 M, and 2.0 M). The precursor was deposited at 4000 rpm for 1 minute and then annealed at 300 °C for 1 hour.
Perovskite photoactive layer was spin coated from previously described ink in the glove box by the solvent engineering method. The perovskite precursor was spin coated at 5000 rpm for 30 seconds on the glass/FTO/NiO substrate. About 300 μL of anhydrous toluene was poured on each substrate 8 seconds after the start of spin coating to induce the crystallization process. Then, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. Further, 40 nm of C60 ETL was thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber at 2 × 10−6 Torr vacuum level. Bathocuproine hole blocking layer and Al were sequentially deposited under the same conditions through the mask to form 0.15 cm2 cell pixels. The final thicknesses of the layers were 40 nm for C60, 7.5 nm for BCP and 80 nm for Al.
Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the TED-NiA as a new and easy complex as a precursor for deposition of NiO thin layer used as HTM in inverted (p-i-n) PSCs. TED-NiA provides a new strategy for low temperature (280–300 °C) processing of NiO HTL. A thorough material characterization was performed on the NiO precursor and the NiO film, including TGA, FTIR, Raman, Auger spectroscopy, XRD, SEM and PL analyses. Despite the presence of carbon and metallic nickel impurities in the NiO layer, a PCE > 15% was achieved by appropriate optimization of NiO thickness down to 10 nm. Two effects contribute to the increase in PCE by reducing NiO thickness: (i) increase in FF (up to 0.77) due to reduction of series resistance from 9.94 Ohm cm2 for 27 nm-thick NiO layer to 4.61 Ohm cm2 for 10 nm-thick NiO layer and (ii) increase in Jsc due to improved charge transfer at the perovskite/NiO interface. Future progress of this precursor route will be obtained by improving the quality of the perovskite layer by the multication approach and finer control over the film chemical composition to drop the annealing temperatures below 250 °C to make this approach compatible with many flexible substrates.
