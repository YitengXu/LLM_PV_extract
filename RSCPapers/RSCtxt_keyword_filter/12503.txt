However, chemical stability is a major issue that hampers their large-scale implementation. Therefore being able to monitor the degradation rate of perovskite thin films may help understand the key factors governing the stability of this material system. Here, we use grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements to elucidate the role of chlorine and the substrate in the stability of perovskite CH3NH3Pb(I1−xClx)3 (MAPbI) films for solar cells exposed to ambient atmosphere for more than 30 days. MAPbI films with different concentrations of chlorine were deposited on glass, ITO, and Si substrates. We found that the degradation rate of the perovskite that decomposes into PbI2 depends on the used substrate as well as the concentration of Cl. Through first principles calculations, we propose a mechanism on how chlorine affects the perovskite film properties. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency of the fabricated perovskite planar heterojunction solar cells is investigated. The highest device performance with an efficiency of 15.7% is obtained with the 10% Cl film at the cost of stability. These findings lead to an improved understanding of more controllable processing schemes for hybrid perovskites. They also offer a potential route to control the degradation rate so as to create more favorable ways of producing stable films and devices from these materials.
Introduction
Hybrid halide perovskites1 have emerged as a breakthrough in the field of solar energy, demonstrating a viable high performance device platform due to wide choices of processing conditions and device architectures. Consequently these materials have a great potential to lead to cost-effective solar energy production, and are capable of competing with silicon based technologies. In particular, CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX3) are hybrid materials with excellent optoelectronic properties, suitable for single junction solar cells, and among them, MAPbI3 is a typical light-harnessing material in perovskite solar cells.2–10 Replacing iodine in this model structure with other halide atoms such as chlorine can help tune the band gap and therefore device performance. Due to the complex structure of the perovskite material, it is important to understand its composition as well as the interaction between the organic/inorganic structure and the external environment and therefore, the influence of the interface on the structural and optical properties of the perovskite. This understanding is a key to develop high performance and stable perovskite devices. The role of chlorine in perovskite solar cells has also been extensively investigated.8,11–22 Although it has been found that the addition of chlorine affects the growth of MAPbI3 and improves device efficiency, contradictory assessments have been made on whether high or low chlorine contents lead to higher efficiency. Also the role of chlorine in perovskite performance and stability is not yet fully understood. Many investigations have also been performed to study the stability of the perovskite23–25 as well as the role of the substrate morphology in the structural or optical properties of perovskites. De Bastiani et al. have shown that the nature of the substrate critically affects the structural and optical properties of perovskites by changing the crystallization dynamics.26 Their PL measurements showed that perovskite crystallites grown in the nanometer sized porous scaffold present a shorter-living and blue-shifted emission with respect to the perovskite crystals which are free to grow without any constraints. Also, Tidhar et al. have shown that the roughness and inhomogeneity of the substrate may allow for lower energy pathways for nucleation, thus increasing the probability to overcome the energy barrier for nucleation and resulting in a better surface coverage.27 However, no systematic studies have been performed on different substrates and there is still a poor understanding of the relationship between the perovskite/substrate interface and stability or device performance. In this study, we use a combination of the substrate and perovskite material processing conditions with the inclusion of varying percentage of chlorine, studied with both experiment and theory. Our goal in this study is to gain insight into how those differences (nature of the substrate and Cl content, and combination of both) may critically impact the stability of the perovskite. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of the crystalline structure of MAPb(I1−xClx)3, using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements over time. We explain the role of chlorine in the film properties through first principles calculations. Furthermore, the influence of the Cl content on the power conversion efficiency of the fabricated ITO/ZnO/MAPb(I1−xClx)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag solar cells is investigated.
Experimental
The perovskite films were prepared via a two step sequential deposition method in a nitrogen glovebox as found in the literature.13,28 This consisted of the following: A PbI2 solution prepared in a N,N-dimethylformamide solvent by constant stirring at 70 °C was spin coated (3000 rpm, 30 s) on ZnO nanoparticle photoanodes (100 nm, synthesized in methanol), and dried at 70 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the films were dipped in a solution containing a mixture of CH3NH3I:CH3NH3Cl (95:5) wt% in isopropanol (8 mg mL−1) for 4 min at 60 °C, rinsed with isopropanol for 2 s and annealed at 110 °C for 30 min. The processing conditions were reproduced consistently for all films. Spin coating of the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport material and thermal evaporation of the Ag top contact complete the device structure. The thickness measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (Woollam, M-2000) was the same for all films. The crystalline structure of the perovskite films was examined using a grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer (GIXRD, Rigaku D/Max-2500 with CuKα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray diffraction data were collected at a grazing angle of 0.5° between the X-ray beam and the film surface. Typical X-ray scans are shown in Fig. S1.† To gain more insights into the effect of chlorine on the perovskites, first-principles calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the VASP code29 using a standard frozen-core projector augmented-wave (PAW) method. For exchange-correlation functional, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) was used.30 The cut-off energy for basis functions is 400 eV. The k-point mesh was chosen such that the product of the number of k mesh points along one direction and the corresponding lattice parameter is at least 30 Å. Structural relaxations were performed until all the residual forces on atoms were less than 5 meV Å−1. We chose β phase MAPbI3 for the calculation since it is the phase observed at room-temperature. For MAI and MACl, the NaCl-structure is chosen for the total energy calculation.
Results and discussion
Structural properties
The GIXRD patterns of the as-prepared perovskites on different substrates and Cl ratios on the first day (d0) and after 32 days (d32) are shown in Fig. 1. The 2θ scan was in the range of 10–80° (see ESI†). However, for seeking clarity in comparing the different batches of perovskite materials and following the evolution of their crystalline phase, the 2θ scan range shown is limited to 11–16°, where the most intense peaks associated with MAPbI3 and PbI2 can be found. The peaks around 2θ = 12.7 correspond to PbI2 and no peaks related to MAPbCl3 or PbCl2 are observed. The peaks around 2θ = 14°, 28°, and 43° (see ESI†) correspond to the (110), (220), and (330) planes of the targeted mixed halide organometal perovskite MAPb(I1−xClx)3. The XRD patterns are consistent with those reported in previous reports, and the perovskite structure is identical to that of the more widely used tetragonal β CH3NH3PbX3 phase. This shows that substituting halide atoms in the perovskite does not affect the ground state crystal structure of the material. The lattice parameters of MAPbI3 derived from the X-ray diffractogram were a = 8.782 Å and c = 4.486 Å. For 5% Cl perovskite films on d0, the XRD patterns are similar demonstrating that the substrate has a small impact on the structural conversion of the perovskite. The presence of a small peak related to PbI2 indicates that the material is not fully converted to MAPb(I1−xClx)3 (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, on d32, the material exhibits a much stronger peak associated with PbI2, therefore indicating the degradation of the perovskite (Fig. 1b). This could be explained by the fact that when exposed to air, MAPbI3 effectively decomposes at least in part due to moisture and the final products of the degradation process contain PbI2 and MAPb(I1−xClx)3. This degradation is more pronounced for films deposited on ITO. Fig. 1c shows a higher intensity peak of PbI2 for the 0% Cl material deposited on ITO, compared to 5 and 10% Cl samples. This shows that this material converts poorly to MAPbI3 whereas both 5% and 10% Cl exhibit a higher and similar degree of conversion. After 32 days, the films without Cl still show a higher degree of degradation compared to both 5 and 10% Cl films ((Fig. 1d).). We find that the 5% Cl films show the lowest degradation rate.

The 2θ-scan is focused here in the range of 11–16° where the most intense MAPbI3 and PbI2 peaks can be found. 
In order to explore the film stability and evaluate the degradation rate over time, the integrated intensity of all peaks appearing in GIXRD scans that correspond to MAPbI3 and PbI2 was calculated. The peak intensity was integrated over the 2θ angular range of 10–80°. Fig. 2 shows the calculated MAPbI3/PbI2 ratio of the perovskite films deposited on glass, ITO and Si substrates and stored in ambient atmosphere for 32 days. The determined values decrease as a function of time corresponding to a decrease of MAPbI3 and an increase of PbI2 signal intensities, and therefore, the degradation of the perovskite over time. However, the perovskite peaks disappeared only after 32 days.

Rocking curves were also taken to control the differences in film texture between the samples. 
Perovskite films deposited on Si show higher stability whereas the ones deposited on ITO show the lowest stability. Films on ITO generally show the fastest degradation rate except for the 10% Cl where films on glass degrade much faster. The difference in the stability of films grown on the different substrates observed here can be related to the details of the interaction between the film and the substrate at the interface and also the arrangement of the perovskite crystal on the substrate depending on its crystalline structure, surface termination, and morphology structure.31,32 This arrangement can be guided by the surface energy, strain, etc. and other properties related to the substrate surface such as roughness and may lead to the difference in stability and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite device.
Films without Cl exhibit the lowest conversion to the perovskite structure, whereas 5% and 10% chlorine exhibit a similar degree of conversion to the perovskite structure. However from these graphs, there is no clear correlation between the degree of perovskite conversion and stability over time. It is generally observed that the 10% Cl films degrade faster. It is worth mentioning that the evolution of the 10% Cl films presents 2 regions (Fig. 2a); a first region with an abrupt drop and a high degradation rate for the first 8 days, then a second region with a slower degradation rate from the 8th to the 32nd day. The films without Cl exhibit an exponential degradation behavior in their evolution (Fig. 2c). In contrast, the evolution of the 5% Cl films (Fig. 2b) shows a linear slope with a degradation rate slower than both the 0% and 10% Cl films. The reactivity of the substrates toward Cl is probably different and therefore might form different interfaces and lead to these observations.
It is also worth mentioning that there is still debate in the literature on whether Cl is present or not in the formed perovskite film. One of the main reasons for such a debate is the lack of consensus on which investigation method among the used ones could be definitive enough to respond to such a question. Measurements to address this are technically challenging with even highly sophisticated experiments yielding disparate reports in the literature. As a result there does not appear to be a superior reliable method to those that have already been described in the literature. A lack of a general and convincing method precludes reporting on the Cl in the films, as we do not want to extend the current debate on the presence or absence of Cl in the formed perovskite.
First principles calculations
Although previous theoretical calculations were focused on CH3NH3PbI3, the energy difference during the chemical reaction involving Cl has not been yet elucidated. For MAI and MACl, the NaCl-structure is chosen for the total energy calculation. The chemical process for the formation of the MAPbI3 film can be written as: PbI2 + MAI → MAPbI3(1)
Experimentally, it is observed that under normal growth conditions many pin-holes exist in the film and the reaction of PbI2 with MAI is often not complete. To improve the sample quality, it has been shown that a growth condition rich in MAI precursor is needed33 and the existence of Cl is found to have an effect on the morphological evolution during the growth process of MAPbI3.8,13,18 For example, Yu et al.20 found that good films can be grown under MA rich conditions and Cl can facilitate the release of excess MA at a relatively low annealing temperature. Williams et al.18 proposed that chlorine plays a role of nucleation center in the MAPbI3 growth. However, the fundamental mechanism behind these observations is still not very clear. To address this issue, we have studied the following possible chemical reaction with the existence of PbCl2 as precursors and compared it with the reaction in eqn (1). PbCl2 + 3MAI → MAPbI3 + 2MACl(2)
Using DFT, we calculate the chemical reaction energy for the chemical reactions (1) and (2). We found that the chemical reaction energy of (1) is −194 meV, whereas it is −880 meV for the chemical reaction (2). Here, the negative number indicates that the products on the right hand side of the equation are more stable.‡ The calculated results indicate that (i) the chemical reaction (2) is more favorable, suggesting that with the existence of Cl the reaction could be more complete and the film can have a better morphology and uniformity. (ii) PbCl2 acts as the nucleation center in the growth because the chemical reaction involving PbCl2 is much more active. (iii) Excess MA [three times of that used in reaction (1)] is required to facilitate the reaction (2). In the final product, the excess MA is removed from the sample by forming MACl. However, reaction (2) requires the dissociation of PbCl2 into Pb2+ and Cl− ions and the formation of the MACl compound, so it may react slower than the reaction (1). Our results, therefore, are consistent with experimental observations.13,18,20,28
Morphology

Fig. 3 shows the degree of bleaching34 after 15 days of exposure in ambient atmosphere in a room with a controlled temperature, at 25 °C, and with the lights on. The films have significant variations in color as a function of time, going from dark brown to yellow. This suggests that the perovskite films have partially decomposed into regions rich in PbI2, since they showed irreversible color (yellow) after being annealed in ambient atmosphere up to 300 °C. The decomposition of the films starts at the edges. If one assumes that the initial decomposition process is de-intercalation of MAI from PbI2, then the process would start at the edges, which is where the material is open to the ambient atmosphere. Other processes could also occur if the edges are more reactive than the surface of the crystals (i.e. c vs. a planes of the original PbI2 structure).

Device performance and optical properties
To ensure that this study could be pertinent and beneficial to perovskite solar cells, it is important to confirm that one can use these perovskite films to fabricate efficient devices. Therefore, we have used the same process of film fabrication to develop ITO/ZnO/MAPb(I1−xClx)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag solar cells with x equal to 0, 0.05, and 0.1 (in the precursors). Device parameters under light illumination (simulated under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation), i.e., the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), the fill factor (FF), and the solar power conversion efficiency (PCE), extracted from the J–V characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The devices exhibit excellent power conversion efficiencies. Perovskite devices with a higher PbCl2/PbI2 ratio exhibit the highest PCE of 15.63% whereas the devices with a lower Cl precursor content have lower PCEs. Based on the absorption data of the perovskite films with different PbCl2/PbI2 ratios as shown in Fig. 4, the 10% Cl samples exhibit the highest absorption in the visible region. Absorption data taken for two different sets of films with the same Cl content show a similar trend. Due to this high absorption, the 10% Cl films exhibit the highest Jsc and thus, the PCE. This result is consistent with what has been reported by Chen et al.31 who found that the chlorine incorporation helps improve the carrier transport across the heterojunction interfaces. Also, it is worth mentioning that the PCEs of the devices are in good agreement with the degree of conversion of the perovskite films as a function of Cl content as observed in Fig. 2d. However, a direct comparison between the evolution of the PCE and the perovskite degradation is not straightforward based on both our observations and reports in the literature. It has been observed that the PCE of devices with a higher PbCl2/PbI2 ratio drops faster than those with a low Cl content. This may be related to the instability of the MAPb(I1−xClx)3 alloys19 at a high Cl concentration and complexity of the perovskite device structures. The use of Ag in place of Au has also been demonstrated to be problematic for the stability of the device system.

Conclusions
In conclusion, different substrates and chlorine concentrations are used to fabricate hybrid perovskite layers for solar cells. We show that although different recipes or process parameters in the perovskite formation may lead to different material properties (morphology, grain size, wetting, etc.), modifying the deposition substrate or the chlorine concentration in the precursors could help mitigate perovskite degradation. We found that using 5% chlorine content and a Si substrate can lead to a more stable perovskite material. The role of chlorine in the perovskite properties is investigated via first principles calculations. The calculated results suggest that using PbCl2 as a precursor under MA-rich conditions can significantly improve the formation of perovskites, in good agreement with experimental observations. Devices with solar cell PCE reaching 15.7% are demonstrated with the 10% Cl film. The outcome of this study leads to an improved understanding of more controllable processing schemes for the hybrid perovskites. It also offers a potential route to control the degradation rate so as to create more favorable ways of producing stable films and devices from these materials.

 	Fig. 2  The ratio of MAPbI3/PbI2 calculated from the integrated intensities of MAPbI3 and PbI2 peaks appearing in GIXRD scans as a function of lead chlorine composition [(a) 10%, (b) 5%, and (c) no chlorine] and substrate [(d) glass, (e) ITO, and (f) Si]. Rocking curves were also taken to control the differences in film texture between the samples.	 
PbI2 + MAI → MAPbI3	(1)
PbCl2 + 3MAI → MAPbI3 + 2MACl	(2)

 	Fig. 3  Film bleaching after 15 days of exposure in ambient atmosphere for (a) 5% of chlorine concentration on different substrates, and (b) different concentrations of chlorine on ITO substrates.	 

PbI2	1.05 ± 0.05	16.66 ± 0.96	73.10 ± 9.52	12.80 ± 0.74
PbCl2/PbI2 (5%)	1.07 ± 0.07	16.82 ± 0.83	66.10 ± 8.10	11.90 ± 0.68
PbCl2/PbI2 (10%)	1.07 ± 0.08	20.62 ± 1.1	70.84 ± 7.96	15.63 ± 0.86

 	Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of films deposited on ITO substrates with 0, 5%, and 10% of chlorine in the precursor.

‡ Since we used cubic MAI and MACl, and PBE density functional in our calculations, the stability of perovskite compounds is overestimated. However, it does not change the chemical trend discussed in this paper.
