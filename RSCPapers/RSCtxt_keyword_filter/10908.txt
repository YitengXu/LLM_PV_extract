    , Accepted 28th July 2019First published on 3rd August 2019AbstractPolymer donor:polymer acceptor all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) demonstrate lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the state-of-art small-molecule acceptor organic solar cells (OSCs), because of the limited polymer acceptor species and relatively difficult control of film morphology. In this work, based on the most famous naphthalene diimide containing copolymer N2200, we report a series of A–D1–A–D2 type random terpolymer acceptors PNDI-BDTx (x = 5, 10 or 20), fabricated by replacing a certain amount of electron-donating bithiophene (T2) monomers with two-dimensional (2D) benzodithiophene (BDT) units. In combination with various polymer donors exhibiting varied optoelectronic and crystalline properties, improved photovoltaic performances were attained for the all-PSCs containing the terpolymer acceptors PNDI-BDT5 and PNDI-BDT10. The average PCEs of 5.80%, 3.90% and 1.96% obtained for the PNDI-BDT10 devices were consistently higher than 5.16%, 2.81% and 1.41% for devices containing the N2200 acceptor, when using PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and PDCBT as polymer donors, respectively. Compared with N2200, the random terpolymer PNDI-BDT10 exhibited less planarity and crystallinity, which induced favorable morphology with optimized phase separation, appropriately-sized domains and well-interpenetrated nanonetworks in polymer:polymer blends, and thus resulted in balanced charge transportation, higher exciton dissociation efficiency and suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, in various PSCs based on the same PBDB-T donor, the terpolymer PNDI-BDT10 showed the best long-term device stability both at room-temperature and under 60 °C aging conditions for 240 h among all general types of electron acceptors such as copolymer N2200, small molecule ITIC and PC71BM.
Introduction
The rapid development of photovoltaics, which is perceived as one of the promising techniques for obtaining clean and renewable energy, has been achieved in both academic and industrial communities.1 Driven by the unique advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility and solution processing, great progress has been made in organic solar cells (OSCs) in the last few decades.2–5 With much effort devoted to the design of new materials and device structure optimization, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of binary blend and tandem OSCs have reached beyond 15%6,7 and 17%,8 respectively.
Compared to OSCs based on fullerenes and fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs),9–11 all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which comprise p- and n-type polymeric semiconductors in active layer blends, have demonstrated superior benefits of long-term optical, thermal, environmental, mechanical and morphological stabilities, which might be more preferable for large-area and flexible applications.12–15 However, compared to fullerene- and FREA-based OSCs, the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs still seriously lags behind. This inferior performance has been mainly attributed to the limitations of n-type polymer semiconductors and the relative difficulty in controlling the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphologies of polymer:polymer blends.16–20
To date, widely-reported polymer acceptors have been mainly constructed using several electron-deficient fragments, including naphthalene diimide (NDI),21–26 naphthodithiophene diimide (NDTI),27,28 perylene diimide (PDI),29–31 B ← N bridged bipyridine (BNBP)32,33 and bithiophene imide (BTI).34,35 Among these, NDI-based polymers have received particular attention owing to their advantages of strong electron affinity, easy functionalization and high electron transport ability.21,36,37 The most promising NDI-based polymer acceptor is poly[[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis-(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)] (also known as N2200), which possesses electron-donating (D) bithiophene and electron-accepting (A) NDI monomers alternatively conjugated along the polymer chain, providing suitable energy levels, electron mobility, satisfactory solubility and wide absorption.24,25,38,39 Very recently, by successfully employing a green solvent CPME as the active layer solvent, Huang et al. reported efficient N2200-based all-PSCs with a high PCE of 11% when using the wide bandgap polymer donor PTzBI.40 However, due to the rigid planar structure and strong π–π intermolecular interaction, N2200 can easily become overly crystalline, which can result in unsatisfactory polymer blend morphology.41–43 It has been widely reported that optimum morphology plays a crucial role in exciton separation and charge transport.44 The rigid planarity and excessive crystalline behavior of N2200 customarily lead to undesirable phase separation in polymer donor:acceptor blends, as well as excessively large acceptor domains.45 Meanwhile, suboptimal intermixing with donor polymer and large domain size might cause charge recombination and unbalanced carrier transport, thus negatively affecting the fill factor (FF) and PCE of N2200-based all-PSCs.46–49
Based on the considerations above, it is necessary to further develop NDI-based polymers to afford promising polymer acceptor materials that not only exhibit appropriate polymer crystalline behavior with desirable BHJ morphology, but also achieve universal compatibility with various polymer donors. Well-controlled crystallinity and enhanced PCEs have been obtained for A1–D–A2–D type terpolymer acceptors through NDI side-chain engineering in N2200-based all-PSCs.50–53 In this work, a series of A–D1–A–D2 type NDI-based polymer acceptors were developed via a random terpolymer approach through replacing a small amount of bithiophene linear blocks in N2200 with 2D-conjugated 8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) moieties to modify the molecular packing and fine tune the polymer crystallinity. The terpolymer acceptors PNDI-BDTx were distinguished by the molar feed ratio percentage of the BDT unit, with x = 5, 10 or 20. Using a combination of characterization techniques, it was found that through appropriate embedding of BDT monomers into the N2200 copolymer chain, the terpolymers demonstrated suitable crystalline intensities with flexible polymer backbones and reduced planarity, which might be favorable for optimizing the morphology of all-polymer blends. Three different polymers, PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and PDCBT (PBDB-T: poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))], PTB7-Th: poly[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenealt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl], PDCBT: poly[(4,4′-bis(2-butyloctoxycarbonyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5-diyl)-alt-(2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diyl)])), which possess distinguishable optoelectronic properties and crystalline behaviors, were selected as polymer donors to assess the universal usability of the BDT-containing terpolymer acceptors in different polymer blends. Interestingly, all-PSCs based on the PNDI-BDT10 terpolymer acceptor demonstrated the best photovoltaic properties, with maximum PCEs of 5.91, 3.76 and 2.10% for PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and PDCBT, respectively, which are higher than the values of 5.26, 2.91 and 1.45% for the N2200-based devices. Moreover, the stability of OSCs based on the same donor PBDB-T but different types of acceptor were compared in parallel. The results revealed that superior device stability was obtained in the PNDI-BDT10-based devices, significantly better than OSCs based on N2200, ITIC and PC71BM.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Terpolymer acceptors PNDI-BDTx were designed based on the widely-studied copolymer acceptor N2200 by introducing the electron-donating BDT unit as the third monomer to replace a certain amount of T2 moieties. With BDT units embedded into the N2200 copolymer, three A–D1–A–D2 type terpolymers named PNDI-BDT5, PNDI-BDT10 and PNDI-BDT20 were synthesized, corresponding to BDT molar feed ratios of 5, 10 and 20%, respectively. The detailed polymerization progress is described in the ESI.† To afford a reliable comparison, copolymer N2200 was also prepared under the same polymerization conditions. As shown in Scheme 1, all of the terpolymers were synthesized through a Stille coupling reaction with 4,9-dibromo-2,7-bis(2-octyldodecyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]-phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone, 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene and (4,8-bis(5-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) as the starting monomers with the corresponding feed ratios. The chemical structures of the as-synthesized polymers were characterized through 1H NMR, and the results are in good agreement with the predicted values (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). For PNDI-BDT5, a similar 1H NMR spectrum was obtained compared to the profile of N2200. However, after enlarging the feed ratio of the BDT unit, the chemical shift emerging at δ ≈ 7.82 and 2.90 ppm, as well as the increased intensity of the peak located at δ ≈ 8.90 ppm, indicated that the BDT unit was successfully embedded. The resulting polymers showed satisfactory solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). In addition, the number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with DCB as the eluting reagent at 120 °C. As listed in Table 1, all polymers demonstrated comparable molecular weights, with Mn, Mw and PDI in the ranges of 61–69 kg mol−1, 142–157 kg mol−1 and 2.1–2.4, respectively. It should be noted that molecular mass variations of NDI-based polymer acceptors can significantly affect the aggregation and crystallization tendencies, as well as the phase separation and backbone orientation in BHJ blends.16,54 In this study, it is expected that the extraordinary similarity in molecular weights between N2200 and PNDI-BDTx exhibits little influence on polymer:polymer blends morphologies, which ensuring a credible comparison for their photovoltaic properties in all-PSCs. In addition, from the simulated chemical geometry shown in Fig. 1, it was observed that introducing BDT units into N2200 leads to a relatively twisted polymer backbone, which may significantly break the planarity of the N2200 backbone and result in less rigid intermolecular packing in the polymer:polymer blends.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical absorption properties of N2200, PNDI-BDTx, three polymer donors (PBDB-T, PTB7-Th, PDCBT) and the corresponding blend films were characterized using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, all the polymer acceptors exhibited similarly camel hump-like absorption profiles with two distinct absorption bands located at 300–450 nm and 550–750 nm, which belong to the π–π* transitions of local NDI segments and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions between the electron-rich unit (D) and the electron-accepting unit (A), respectively.55,56 More specifically, in dilute CF solution at the same concentration (Fig. 2a), by increasing the feed ratio of BDT monomers, the absorption profile gradually blue-shifted, with the absorption maximum (λmax) changing from 390/702 nm for N2200 to 386/692, 384/668, 368/646 nm for PNDI-BDTx (x = 5, 10 and 20). In addition, the gradual blue-shift with reduced intensity for ICT absorption in the terpolymers PNDI-BDTx (x = 5, 10 and 20) was ascribed to the embedding of more BDT units for a more twisted polymer backbone, and thus the reduced molecular planarity and D–A interactions. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 2b, due to the strong aggregation in the film state, the absorption spectra variations were not that obvious compared with in solution, with the corresponding λmax shifted from 394/706 to 393/704, 391/703 and 388/698 nm, respectively. Similarly, a slight gradual reduction of intensities can be found in the ICT bands with increasing the feed ratio of BDT units. The absorption spectra of the three polymer donors and different donor:acceptor blends in the film states are shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S5 (ESI†). As shown, compared to the absorption profiles of the pure donors and acceptors, the corresponding blended films displayed relatively complementary optical absorptions.

The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were measured via cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves of the polymer acceptors are shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI† and the energy level alignments of the polymers used in this work are listed in Fig. 2d. The EHOMO and ELUMO of copolymer N2200 were measured to be −5.87 and −3.82 eV, which are well-matched with the values reported in previous reports.39,57,58 With BDT monomers embedded, the EHOMO of the terpolymer acceptors demonstrated a decreasing trend with increasing BDT feed ratio, which values at −5.99, −6.07 and −6.10 eV for PNDI-BDT5, PNDI-BDT10 and PNDI-BDT20. On the other hand, different from the variation of HOMO levels, the ELUMO of the terpolymers slightly increased from −3.80 for PNDI-BDT5 to −3.77 and −3.75 eV for PNDI-BDT10 and PNDI-BDT20, respectively. Moreover, it can be found in Fig. 2d that each polymer donor:polymer acceptor combination presented sufficient HOMO and LUMO energy offsets (>0.3 eV), which might afford enough driving forces for efficient exciton dissociation.59
Crystal characterization
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out to characterize the thermal properties of the polymer acceptors. The relevant curves are depicted in Fig. 3a. As shown, all the polymer acceptors exhibit distinct melting and crystallization peaks upon heating and cooling, respectively. N2200 demonstrated a melting temperature (Tm) and crystallization temperature (Tc) as high as 320 and 295 °C, which were the highest values among all the polymer acceptors. For the BDT-containing terpolymers, Tm and Tc gradually reduced with the inclusion of more BDT fragments, indicating that the rigidity and molecular stacking of the polymer acceptors were weakened. Meanwhile, the melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of each polymer acceptor, which is strongly correlated to the polymer crystallinity, was calculated from the area of melting peaks in the DSC curves. As listed in Table 1, N2200 showed the highest ΔHm of 12.55 J g−1, and the values declined to 11.89 J g−1 for PNDI-BDT5, 11.14 J g−1 for PNDI-BDT10 and 7.99 J g−1 for PNDI-BDT20. The results from DSC indicated that a lower crystallinity and less rigid backbone were obtained through the breaking of planarity via the random terpolymer approach.

To obtain detailed insight into the crystalline behavior variation of the terpolymers, grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXs) measurements were further conducted for pure films of polymer acceptors. The 2D-GIWAXs patterns for the pure acceptors and the corresponding 1D line cut profiles are shown in Fig. 3b–f. From the GIWAXs measurements, distinct (010) peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at qz ≈ 1.6 Å−1, as well as (001) peaks at qxy ≈ 0.46 Å−1 along the in-plane (IP) direction were detected, indicating that all the polymer acceptors demonstrated preferential face-on orientations. Moreover, obvious differences in crystallization intensities were observed for the different polymer acceptors. In agreement with the results from DSC, N2200 showed the highest crystalline intensity. Decreased intensities in both OOP and IP directions were obtained from the BDT-based terpolymers, implying that the introduction of BDT units in the N2200 backbone gradually reduced the crystallinity of polymer acceptors in the film state.
To further confirm the conclusions from DSC and GIWAXs, we conducted a parallel comparison of the absorption spectra of polymer acceptors under different conditions. In Fig. S7 (ESI†), the absorption spectra of N2200 and PNDI-BDTx (x = 5, 10 and 20) in dilute CF solution, ambient film and thermally annealed film states are listed abreast. As is well known, polymers in a film state demonstrate higher aggregation tendencies compared to those in dilute solution, and the aggregation intensity is further improved after thermal annealing. In addition, a strong aggregation intensity could result in a red-shifted absorption profile, as well as an enhanced absorption intensity.60 Therefore, from the degree of red-shifting and enhancement of the absorption intensity in the absorption spectra, parallel comparisons of aggregation and crystalline intensity among all of the polymer acceptors were achieved. It can be observed that a slight red-shift degree of N2200 was detected in the film state compared to the profiles in solution. More specifically, the absorption profiles of the ambient and thermally annealed films were nearly overlapping, which might be due to the distinctive strong aggregation tendency and rigid crystallinity of N2200. On the other hand, compared to ambient conditions, the additional red-shift and extra absorption enhancement after thermal annealing for all the absorption spectra of PNDI-BDTx are attributed to the reduced molecular planarity and lower crystallinities induced by the involvement of BDT units. Among them, PNDI-BDT20 showed the largest-scale red-shift in the film state compared to that in dilute solution. A further obvious red-shift achieved after thermal annealing indicated that PNDI-BDT20 possesses the most disordered polymer backbone as well as a much weaker crystalline structure. Overall, the results from a combination of DSC measurements, GIWAXs and the comparison of absorption profiles, indicated that the aggregation tendency and crystalline behavior of polymer acceptors can be gradually adjusted by embedding two-dimensional BDT monomers through a random terpolymer approach, which might be favorable for forming more miscible polymer blends and proper phase separation in BHJ.
Photovoltaic performance
Bulk-heterojunction all-PSCs with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/PDINO61/Al were constructed to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the different polymer acceptors. Three different polymers, PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and PDCBT, which demonstrate different optoelectronic and crystalline behaviors (GIWAXs patterns in Fig. S8, ESI†) were employed as polymer donors to detect the universality of our design motif. The current density–voltage (J–V) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding photovoltaic properties are listed in Table 2; the average PCEs of the different active layer systems were collected based on over 12 independent devices. The details of the device fabrication conditions can be found in ESI.†

Firstly, the wide band-gap polymer PBDB-T was selected as the polymer donor. A modest maximum PCE of 5.26% was afforded by PBDB-T:N2200, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, Jsc of 9.38 mA cm−2 and FF of 64.90%, which is in agreement with the values reported by other groups.28,42,56 Compared to the control N2200-based device, improved photovoltaic properties were obtained by employing PNDI-BDT5 and PBDI-BDT10 as acceptors. The best photovoltaic performance was achieved for PNDI-BDT10-containing devices, with an overall enhanced Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 10.13 mA cm−2 and FF of 67.58%, corresponding to a maximum PCE of 5.91%. Considering the slightly reduced absorption intensities of the PNDI-BDT5 and PNDI-BDT10 blend films compared with that of N2200 (Fig. S5, ESI†), the significantly higher Jsc and FF of the PNDI-BDT5- and PNDI-BDT10-based devices can be most reasonably ascribed to the optimization of film morphology. PNDI-BDT20, which possess the largest amount of the third monomer in the polymer backbone, demonstrated a diminished Jsc of 8.30 mA cm−2, leading to a decreased PCE of 4.69%, which was mainly due to the lowest absorption ability of PNDI-BDT20 among all the polymer acceptors.
To further confirm the application potential of BDT-containing terpolymers for all-PSCs, the widely-studied polymer PTB7-Th and the polythiophene derivative PDCBT were subsequently selected as polymer donors. From a crystallinity point of view, unlike PBDB-T, PTB7-Th demonstrated more amorphous aggregation behavior in BHJ blends; on the other hand, strong crystalline peaks in both IP and OOP directions were observed for the pure PDCBT, suggesting that PDCBT showed relatively strong crystallization in polymer:polymer blends (Fig. S8, ESI†).62 As listed in Table 2, when PTB7-Th and PDCBT were adopted as donors, the four polymer acceptors displayed nearly identical variation trends in photovoltaic properties to the PBDB-T system. The best photovoltaic performance was achieved in the PNDI-BDT10-based devices. In addition, the maximum PCEs were valued at 2.91/3.06/3.76/2.78% and 1.41/1.82/2.10/1.54% for the PTB7-Th and PDCBT systems, by employing N2200 as well as the PBDI-BDT5, PBDI-BDT10 and PBDI-BDT20 as acceptors, respectively. The improved PCEs of PNDI-BDT5 and PBDI-BDT10 were attained by the enhanced Jsc and FF. Suffering from a low absorption ability, the PNDI-BDT20-based devices showed unsatisfactory Jsc. However, the FFs of all the PNDI-BDT20-based devices were still higher compared to those of the N2200 counterparts. More specifically, the PDCBT:PNDI-BDT20-based devices showed even higher PCEs compared to the PDCBT:N2200 controls, which might be because the relatively weak crystallinity of PNDI-BDT20 is more comparable with that of PDCBT. Meanwhile, for the PDCBT:N2200 combination, the relatively strong crystallization of both the donor and acceptor might result in excessive phase separation due to the poor miscibility, further affording a poor PCE.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for different polymer donor and polymer acceptor combinations are displayed in Fig. 4d–f. The profiles of the EQE spectra are in good agreement with the absorption spectra of the different blends, further corroborating the contribution to photocurrent from both donor and acceptor polymers. In comparison with N2200-based devices, PNDI-BDT5 and PNDI-BDT10 showed obvious enhancement of the spectral response region. The PNDI-BDT20-containing devices demonstrated the weakest photoresponse intensity, consistent with the lowest Jsc among all the four polymer acceptors. Moreover, as listed in Table 2, the calculated Jsc values of different blend devices were in agreement with the values measured from the J–V measurements with mismatches of less than 7%.
Film morphology
As the morphology of a BHJ blend is one of the determinative impact factors for the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells, a combination of morphological characterizations were employed to gain an in-depth understanding of properties such as film surface roughness, surface energy, phase separation, crystalline structure and backbone orientation of different polymer donor:polymer acceptor blends. AFM height and phase images are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The pure films of N2200 and PNDI-BDT5, PNDI-BDT10 and PNDI-BDT20 demonstrated similar surface roughness with small root-mean-square (RMS) values in the range of 1.005–1.029. However, when these polymer acceptors were blended with PBDB-T, PTB7-Th or PDCBT, discriminating RMS together with diverse phase separations were observed for the different blends (Table 3). In the PBDB-T and PTB7-Th systems, on account of the amorphous aggregation abilities of polymer donors,54 these blends exhibited relatively small RMS with tiny fiber-like microstructures as well as small phase separations. In contrast, due to the strong crystallinity, the PDCBT blends showed extended phase separation, combined with prominent domains and obviously large surface roughness. Moreover, slightly lower RMS in the PNDI-BDTx blends compared to the N2200-based controls can be found in all three donor systems, indicating that improved miscibility was achieved by random polymerization. Furthermore, taking advantage of the less rigid molecular backbone and lower crystallinity, the PNDI-BDT10 blends demonstrated favorable morphology with proper phase separation and well-interpenetrated nanofibers,43,63 which was in contrast with the excessive phase separation and larger domains in the N2200-based blends.

Furthermore, contact angle measurements were performed to characterize the surface energy properties and the interactions between different polymer acceptors and polymer donors. The relevant images are displayed in Fig. S10 and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Double distilled water and diiodomethane were employed as the probe liquid. The surface energies of different pure films were calculated using the Owens–Wendt model.64 As shown, the water contact angles of the polymer acceptors were irregular. However, with BDT units embedded in the N2200 backbone, the oil contact angle became smaller gradually, which resulted in the enhancement of the dispersion force of PNDI-BDTx compared to that of N2200. In addition, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters, χ, were calculated using the equation χ = K(rdonor1/2 − racceptor1/2)2, where χ is the interaction parameter between donor and acceptor, K is a constant and rdonor and racceptor represent the surface free energy of the donor and acceptor surfaces, respectively.65 The value of χ indicates the interactional property between the donor and acceptor. More specifically, a high χ value tends to induce a large phase separation in donor:acceptor blend films, while a low χ value implies good miscibility between the donor and acceptor, which may further lead to proper phase separation and a smooth surface.52,66 As summarized in Table 3, the PTB7-Th-based blends demonstrated relatively small χ values compared to the PBDB-T and PDCBT systems, which is in good agreement with the lower RMS values among all blended films. Moreover, compared to the N2200-based blends, the terpolymer acceptor blends showed lower χ values, indicating that better miscibility between terpolymer acceptors and polymer donors was achieved through embedding BDT units into N2200 backbone. Good miscibility would further induce well-intermixed blend morphology and small phase separation between terpolymer acceptors and polymer donors, which might lead to the formation of the appropriately sized pure acceptor domains and result in balanced carrier transportation. The results of the contact angle measurements are in accordance with the conclusion from the AFM characterization and give a further explanation of PCE improvement in the terpolymer acceptor-based all-PSCs.
In addition, 2D-GIWAXs were carried out to detect the crystallinity, polymer orientation and crystalline structure of the different BHJ blends. 2D patterns and the corresponding 1D line-cut profiles are displayed in Fig. 5. Distinguished by the varied crystalline behaviors between different donors (Fig. S8, ESI†), the polymer donor:polymer acceptor blends exhibited distinct crystalline structures. As shown, in PBDB-T systems, taking advantages of the “face-on” packing geometries of both donor and acceptor pure films, all the PBDB-T-based blends showed “face-on” orientations with π–π stacking peaks along the OOP direction at qz = 1.71–1.73 Å−1. With respect to the PTB7-Th systems, due to the amorphous aggregation property of PTB7-Th, the crystalline structures of the polymer acceptors were strongly overlapped, resulting in ambiguous semi-crystalline peaks mainly located at qz = 1.59–1.63 Å−1, which indicated the preferential “face-on” orientation. As for the blends containing PDCBT as the polymer donor, relatively complicated and explicit crystalline structures were observed. As shown, all the PDCBT-based blends exhibited strong (010) peaks along IP directions at qxy = 1.74–1.76 Å−1 and numbers of crystalline peaks located at qz ≈ 0.62, 0.92, 1.26 and 1.62 Å−1 along OOP directions, implying that the crystalline behaviors of PDCBT blends were contributed to by both the polymer donor and polymer acceptor and further exhibited mixed orientations of “face-on” and “edge-on”. As can be clearly observed for all three donor systems, N2200-based blends exhibited the strongest crystalline structures with sharp peaks in both IP and OOP directions due to the excessive rigidity and regularity. The strong crystallinity was detrimental as it led to the formation of excessively large domains and unfavorable phase separation.21,42,67 On the other hand, gradual reductions in crystallinity were obtained for the terpolymer blends with increasing the feed ratio of BDT units. Moreover, combining the results from AFM measurements and contact angle measurements, the better miscibility of PNDI-BDTx was also ascribed to the slightly lower crystallinity.

More specifically, for PNDI-BDT10-containing blends, the moderately crystalline structures were favorable for forming appropriate phase separations and balanced domain size, which might further lead to enhanced exciton dissociation, suppressed charge recombination and improved carrier transportation.43,68 In addition, by further increasing the BDT feed ratio to 20%, the crystalline structures became inconspicuous due to the weak crystallinity of PNDI-BDT20. It should be noted that even though the crystallinity was depressed, the PNDI-BDT10-based blends still maintained fine-tuned crystalline intensity, which ensured efficient electron transportation and proper domain purity. In contrast, the ambiguously semi-crystalline structure of PNDI-BDT20 might depress to establish sufficient pure acceptor domains, which might result in decreased electron mobilities, and further influence the PCE.
Charge dissociation and transportation
To assess the influence of morphology tuning and gain deep insight into the variations of photovoltaic performance in the different donor:acceptor blends, systematic measurements were carried out to investigate optoelectronic properties, such as charge dissociation, carrier transport and charge recombination. Firstly, the exciton dissociation probability P(E,T) was characterized from the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves of different all-PSCs.69Jph can be calculated using the formula Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current densities measured under illumination and in dark conditions, respectively. Veff is defined as the difference between the built-in voltage and the applied bias voltage. Moreover, P(E,T) was calculated from the equation P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat, in which Jsat stands for the saturation photocurrent density.70 As shown in Fig. 6a–c, all-PSCs that employ PNDI-BDT10 as an acceptor demonstrated higher photocurrent densities compared to those employing N2200, PNDI-BDT5 and PNDI-BDT20 in all the three donor blends. In addition, the highest P(E,T) values were also obtained in the PNDI-BDT10-based all-PSCs, which were 96.41, 81.36 and 83.36% for the PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and PDCBT blended systems, respectively, in good agreement with the highest Jsc and EQE of the PNDI-BDT10-based devices. Furthermore, we calculated the maximum photoinduced carrier generation rate (Gmax) using the formula Gmax = Jsat/q·L, in which q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer.26,57 As listed in Table 3, the PNDI-BDT10-based devices demonstrated obviously higher Gmax values compared to the N2200-based controls. The higher Jph, P(E,T) and Gmax imply that the PNDI-BDT10-containing devices exhibited better exciton dissociation and charge generation ability.

eff (a–c) and Jscversus light intensity (d–f) curves for different all-PSCs. 
In addition, the charge recombination in different all-PSCs was detected through assessing the dependence of Jsc on the light intensity (Plight). As depicted in Fig. 6d–f, the relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed as Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where the exponential α indicates the degree of bimolecular recombination.71 It has been widely reported that α approaches 1 when the bimolecular recombination is negligible.72 The values of the different all-PSCs are summarized in Table 3. As shown, significantly increased α values from 0.987, 0.953 and 0.951 for N2200 to 0.997, 0.981 and 0.974 for PNDI-BDT-10 were obtained for the PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and PDCBT blended systems, respectively, indicating that bimolecular recombination was the most efficaciously suppressed in the PNDI-BDT-10 devices, which also agreed well with the higher FF in the corresponding photovoltaic devices.
Meanwhile, the Jph–Veff and Jsc–Plight results were further corroborated by charge mobility measurements using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.73,74 The hole-only devices were fabricated in the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au for hole mobility investigation. On the other hand, devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al were prepared for electron mobility characterization. The corresponding J–V curves fitted using the SCLC method are shown in Fig. S11 and S12 in the ESI,† and the hole/electron mobilities are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†) and Table 3. First, the electron transport abilities of N2200 and PNDI-BDTx (x = 5, 10 and 20) were detected.
Among the four polymer acceptors, N2200 possessed the highest electron mobility of 9.83 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, slightly higher than the other BDT-containing terpolymer acceptors, which exhibited electron mobilities of 7.89, 8.46 and 6.39 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNDI-BDT5, PNDI-BDT10 and PNDI-BDT20, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). The higher electron mobility of N2200 might be due to the higher regularity of the copolymer backbone for better intermolecular packing. On the contrary, introducing the third BDT monomer resulted in increased backbone disorder, which further led to slightly decreased electron mobilities in the PNDI-BDTx pure films (Fig. S11, ESI†). However, after forming the BHJ blends, the PNDI-BDT10-based devices demonstrated overall enhancement in both hole and electron mobilities, with nearly 2-fold increased electron mobilities compared to the N2200 analogues, indicating that morphological effects in BHJ blends indeed played a vital role in charge transportation. More specifically, the PNDI-BDT10-containing devices not only exhibited the highest values in both electron and hole mobilities, but also more balanced μh/μe ratios among all the polymer acceptors, which is ascribed to the appropriate morphology obtained when PNDI-BDT10 is employed as a polymer acceptor. The results of the SCLC measurements were also in accordance with the Jsc enhancement in the devices based on PNDI-BDT5 and PNDI-BDT10. In summary, through a combination of characterizing the photocurrent, light intensity dependence and carrier transportation, the PNDI-BDT10-based devices demonstrated a higher exciton dissociation rate, suppressed bimolecular recombination, enhanced carrier generation and more efficient charge transport. This implies that optimized morphologies that are favorable for photovoltaic performance can be formed through judiciously embedding BDT units into the N2200 backbone.
Stability characterization
The device stability is a crucial issue in promoting organic solar cells from lab-scale studies to commercial applications. Herein, device stability characterizations of the OSCs were carried out in parallel with photovoltaic devices fabricated using the same polymer donor PBDB-T, but different widely-reported electron acceptors, such as copolymer N2200, terpolymer PNDI-BDT10, FREA ITIC and the fullerene derivative PC71BM. To conduct a long-term test, the inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, which exhibits superior stability compared to the conventional structure,75–77 was selected. The detailed device fabrication process can be found in the ESI.† The devices were stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox in the dark for 240 h at room temperature or at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. As shown in Fig. 7a, the all-PSCs demonstrated superior stabilities compared to ITIC- and PC71BM-based devices. Due to the PC71BM aggregation in fullerene-containing blends, the PC71BM-based device possessed the poorest device stability.15,78 Among all types of general electron acceptors, the all-PSCs employing the terpolymer PNDI-BDT10 as the acceptor exhibited the best stability. After 240 h of storage at room temperature, the PBDB-T:PNDI-BDT10 all-PSC still retains 93% of the initial PCE, which is higher than the values of 86% for PBDB-T:N2200, 79% for PBDB-T:ITIC and 64% for PBDB-T:PC71BM. On the other hand, concerning the thermal effects with 60 °C aging shown in Fig. 7b, the PCEs of the OSCs degenerated more rapidly and seriously in comparison to those that underwent the room-temperature-aging condition. For the PC71BM-based blends, significant burn-in PCE losses were obtained, with 38% of the original PCE retained after continuous heating at 60 °C. This might be predominantly due to the morphological changes in the pure acceptor domains and phase interactions.79–81 However, the all-PSC devices demonstrated much better thermal stability, especially for the terpolymer PNDI-BDT10-based devices. After annealing at 60 °C for 240 h, the PCE still retained 90% of the initial value, which is better than 76% for the control N2200-based device. To investigate the origin of the disparities in thermal stability, the film morphologies of PBDB-T blended with different acceptors with or without 60 °C annealing were evaluated using AFM. As can be observed from Fig. S13 (ESI†), the long-term thermal treatment led to morphological degeneration in the blends based on ITIC and PC71BM, especially in the PC71BM system. The excessive phase separation and excessive aggregation of pure acceptor phase in annealed PBDB-T:PC71BM blends underpinned the undesirable thermal stability of the PC71BM-based devices. On the other hand, the excellent morphological stability of the all-PSCs was also revealed, as the morphology of the all-PSCs demonstrated little change after thermal annealing. More specifically, compared to the N2200 control, more tiny fiber-like microstructures could be observed in the blends based on PNDI-BDT10, together with smaller RMS values in both the as-cast and annealed blends, which presented a further explanation of the superior thermal stability of the devices constructed with the terpolymer acceptor PNDI-BDT10. Overall, the all-PSCs based on PNDI-BDT10 and N2200 showed superior lifetimes and thermal stability compared to the fullerene- and FREA-based PSCs. More specifically, the all-PSCs based on the terpolymer PNDI-BDT10 acceptor demonstrated the most satisfactory device stability with negligible burn-in PCE loss and long-term storage lifetime, which was attributed to the improved miscibility with the polymer donor, appropriate phase separation and fine-tuned crystalline structure in the PNDI-BDT10-based device.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of random terpolymer acceptors, PNDI-BDTx (x = 5, 10 and 20), have been designed and synthesized by introducing two-dimensional BDT monomers into the N2200 backbone. A systematic comparison was conducted to compare the optical, thermal, electrochemical, morphological and photovoltaic properties of the copolymer N2200 and terpolymers PNDI-BDTx. Compared with N2200, universally improved photovoltaic performances were observed in the terpolymers PNDI-BDT5 and PNDI-BDT10 with an appropriate BDT monomer component when combined with various polymer donors bearing different optoelectronic and crystalline properties. The best photovoltaic performance was obtained for the PNDI-BDT10-containing all-PSCs with maximum PCEs of 5.91, 3.76 and 2.10%, compared to 5.26, 2.91 and 1.45% for the N2200 acceptor in the PBDB-T, PTB7-Th and PDCBT systems, respectively. By further increasing the BDT feed ratio to 20%, the PCEs of the all-PSCs decreased due to the reduction of absorbance, excessive destruction of the molecular planarity and decreased crystallinity of the PNDI-BDT20 terpolymer acceptor. The variations in PCE and photoelectric processes can be explained by the differences in crystallinity. Through planarity modification by incorporating BDT units, proper morphology can be achieved. Among the acceptors, PNDI-BDT10 demonstrated fine-tuned crystallinity, better miscibility and suitable morphology with optimized phase separation and appropriately sized domains, which are favorable for charge transport and exciton dissociation. In contrast, undesirable BHJ morphologies were detected in the N2200- and PDNI-BDT20-based devices, which exhibited excessive crystallinity and ambiguous crystalline structures, respectively. More importantly, the all-PSCs based on PNDI-BDT10 demonstrated the best storage lifetime and thermal stability compared to all the other represented electron acceptors, such as N2200, fullerene-based PC71BM and FREA-based ITIC, after both ambient and thermal aging. The structure–property–performance correlations involved in this work not only illustrate a comprehensive investigation on optimizing BHJ morphology to improve the PCE and device stability of all-PSCs, but also reveal the universal potentiality of fine-tuning the morphology of various polymer active layers using a random terpolymer approach.
