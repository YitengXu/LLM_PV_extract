    , Accepted 12th March 2014First published on 21st March 2014AbstractFew-layer graphene/TiO2 nanocrystal composites are successfully in situ synthesized at a low temperature of 400 °C using C28H16Br2 as the precursor. Raman mapping images show that the TiO2 nanocrystals are very uniformly dispersed in the composite films, and the in situ coating during the thermal decomposition process will favor the formation of a good interface combination between the few-layered graphene and the TiO2 nanocrystals. The few-layer graphene/TiO2 nanocrystal composites are used as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and the conversion efficiency of 8.25% is obtained under full sun irradiation (AM 1.5), which increases by 65% compared with that of the pure TiO2 nanocrystal DSSCs (5.01%). It is found that the good interface combination between few-layered graphene and TiO2 nanocrystals may improve the electric conductivity and lifetime of photoinduced electrons in DSSCs. Moreover, some carbon atoms are doped into the crystal structure of the TiO2 nanocrystals during the thermal decomposition process, which will enhance the light absorption by narrowing the band gap and favor the improvement of the photovoltaic efficiency.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as one of the most promising potential power sources because of their relative low cost and high conversion efficiency of 13%.1,2 In the past twenty years, much effort has been made to increase their conversion efficiency by designing and modifying the TiO2 (P25)-based photoanode film, as it is the most important section of the DSSCs.3,4 However, the common TiO2 particles have limited applications in DSSCs due to their low electronic conductivity.5
Strategies using graphene/TiO2 nanocrystal composites have been proposed to solve the above problems,6 as graphene has many special physical properties, such as superior charge carrier mobility at room temperature (more than 200000 cm2 V−1 s−1), high surface area of over 2600 m2 g−1, and so on.7–10 Thus, graphene sheets between TiO2 nanoparticles may enhance the electron transporting ability and reduce the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes. Many methods have been proposed to prepare the graphene/TiO2 hybrid composites in DSSCs. For example, graphene was incorporated with nanostructured TiO2 films via molecular grafting for dye-sensitized solar cell applications.11 The electrospinning method was used for the fabrication of one-dimensional TiO2/graphene composites, which were used in DSSCs and in the photodegradation of methyl orange.12 Graphene/TiO2 composites were synthesized in a controlled manner by a one-step solvothermal approach for high-performance DSSCs.13 Sun et al. utilized the heterogeneous coagulation between Nafion-coated graphene and commercial TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles to form the photoanode for DSSCs, and the photovoltaic efficiency was 59% higher than that of pure P25 nanoparticles.6
Nevertheless, most of them are prepared by a complicated method or are mechanical mixtures of graphene and nanomaterials, and it is still a great challenge to prepare well-combined graphene and TiO2 nanomaterials.14–16 Graphene existing between the TiO2 nanoparticles acts as a rapid electron transfer path for the photoinduced electrons, which may improve the electric conductivity and lifetime of photoinduced electrons.17,18 Recently, Cheng et al. developed a two-step approach to synthesize TiO2/reduced graphene composites, and it was found that the in situ hydrolysis of the reduced graphene favors the enhancement of the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.18 Cai et al. reported that C28H16Br2 (with a highly symmetrical structure and high carbon content) was used as the precursor to prepare graphene nanoribbons on the (111) surface of Au and Ag at a relatively low temperature of 400 °C,19 which provides an effective route for the formation of well-combined graphene hybrid composites, and this is also a good example for preparing graphene/TiO2 nanocrystal composites in DSSCs.
In the present work, we extend this facile process to coat the TiO2 particles with few-layer graphene (FLG) at a relatively low temperature of 400 °C by using C28H16Br2 as the precursor. Then the composite materials were used as photoanodes in DSSCs by the screen-printing technique, and it is found that the composites provide a great enhancement to the photocurrent and conversion efficiency.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
P25 with the diameter of 30 nm was purchased from Degussa Co., Ltd. in Germany, N719 dye ([(C4H9)4N]2[Ru(II)L2(NCS)2]) was bought from Solaronix Co., Ltd. in Switzerland, and FTO conducting glass was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. in Japan with the sheet resistance of 8 Ω cm−2. All of the other chemical reagents used in the experiments are of analytical grade, purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., and used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of graphene/TiO2 composite material films
TiO2 (P25) nanocrystals were added to the C28H16Br2 (at different weight ratios of TiO2–C28H16Br2)–tetrahydrofuran solution, and the mixture was stirred vigorously. After the evaporation of the tetrahydrofuran, the mixture of TiO2 and C28H16Br2 was heat-treated at 200 °C for 30 min and then calcined at 400 °C for several hours in an argon atmosphere. Then the rough surfaces of the TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully coated with FLG after evaporating the organic solvent to obtain the resultant materials. This was designated as FLG/TiO2.
FLG/TiO2 composite pastes were synthesized according to the Grätzel method.20 Before preparing the photoanode films, FTO conducting glass was immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then the pastes were coated on it to prepare a 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 sized film by the screen-printing technique (250 T mesh per inch, polyester). Additionally, the scattering layer with nanoparticles (>200 nm) was also coated on the surface of the above film by the doctor-blade method. Next, the films were gradually annealed under a flow of air at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min and at 500 °C for 15 min with an increasing temperature rate of 5 °C min−1. For comparison, TiO2 nanocrystal films were also prepared under the same conditions.
2.3 Fabrication of the dye-sensitized solar cell
The solar cell was fabricated by assembling the spinned Pt counter electrode and N719 dye-sensitized FLG/TiO2 composite films on FTO conducting glass. The solar cell was sealed using a Surlyn thermoplastic frame. A standard redox electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M LiI, 0.3 M DMPII and 0.5 M 4-TBP in acetonitrile solution.
2.4 Characterization
The crystal structures and morphologies of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PertPro, PANalytical, Netherlands) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). 3D Raman mapping images were measured by a Confocal Raman System (WITec alpha300R, Germany) equipped with a 532 nm laser and with an optical diffraction limit of ∼200 nm; the composite films were detected to obtain 3D information from the area of 100 × 100 μm with a mesh of 2 μm at the center of the FLG/TiO2 composite films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on the Escalabmk-II XPS apparatus (VG Scientific, England) with an Al target. The emission angle between the photoelectron beam and the sample surface was 45°, and the calibration of the binding energy of the electron spectrometer was made by using the maximum adventitious C 1s signal at 284.6 eV, with the solution of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) being 0.8 eV. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the electronic and ionic processes in DSSCs, using an Autolab Potentiostat 30 system (Metrohm, Switzerland) at the output frequency of 106 Hz to 0.01 Hz at an applied bias of Voc with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The full sun conversion efficiency was characterized by the Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system (Keithley Instruments, USA) (Newport 91160, 300 W xenon lamp, USA). The light intensity of the illumination under AM 1.5 conditions was determined using a reference monocrystalline silicon cell system (Oriel, USA).
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the samples in Fig. 1(a) show that the diffraction peaks originate from the anatase and rutile TiO2 phases, and also identify that the relative content of the anatase and rutile phases is about 4:1, which matches well with that of P25. Meanwhile, after decoration with FLG, there is no obvious peak change at the various contents of the FLG/TiO2 composites, which is related to the fact that the FLG content is too low to be detected by XRD observation. However, there is a broadened peak in the range of 20–30 degrees for the various FLG/TiO2 composites.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns (a) and FTIR spectra (b) of the as-prepared FLG/TiO2 composites with various graphene contents. 

Fig. 1(b) shows the FTIR spectra of the TiO2 nanocrystals and the as-prepared FLG/TiO2 (0.75 wt%). For the TiO2 nanocrystals, the absorption peaks at 3602 cm−1 and 1621 cm−1 arise from the –OH stretching group, while the wide peaks at 400–900 cm−1 originate from the stretching vibrations of Ti–O–Ti bonds in crystalline TiO2.21,22 However, for the FLG/TiO2 composites, the broad absorption below 1000 cm−1 is much plumper with a sharper peak than the corresponding peak for the pure TiO2 nanocrystals, which is attributed to the presence of Ti–O–Ti and Ti–O–C vibrations (805 cm−1),23,24 and the existence of the Ti–O–C bonds shows that the chemically bonded FLG/TiO2 composites are formed by the thermal decomposition of C28H16Br2.25 Moreover, it is clear that the FTIR spectrum of the FLG/TiO2 composite shows some strong absorption peaks that correspond to the different functional groups, such as the CH2 group (2925 cm−1) and alcoholic C–OH stretching (1442 cm−1). Besides them, the absorption band at 1543 cm−1 clearly shows the skeletal vibration of the graphene sheets, indicating the in situ formation of FLG by the thermal decomposition of C28H16Br2.24
From the TEM image of the 0.75 wt% FLG/TiO2 composite in Fig. 2, some pieces of amorphous carbon can be clearly observed between the TiO2 nanocrystals, which may be used to explain the broadened peak from 20–30 degrees in the XRD patterns in Fig. 1(a). Furthermore, the HRTEM image reveals that there are straight lattice fringes with inter-planar spacings of 3.57 Å and 3.25 Å, which correspond to the (101) planes of anatase TiO2 and the (110) planes of rutile TiO2 from the XRD patterns, respectively, and the inset FFT HRTEM image processed by the FFT method in Fig. 2(b) shows the existence of the TiO2 phase. This result further confirms that the TiO2 crystal structure is well maintained after the graphene coating, which is accordance with the FTIR result in Fig. 1(b). Interestingly, an ultra-thin graphene layer is observed between the TiO2 crystal samples, and its thickness is less than 1 nm. By selecting only the matrix reflections of the rectanglular area in Fig. 2(b), the typical feature of the hexagonal structure of FLG is observed by the FFT HRTEM image processed by FFT in Fig. 2(c),26 which is quite different to that of the TiO2 crystal in the inset in Fig. 2(b). Therefore, it can be clearly seen that the FLG is tightly combined with the TiO2 nanocrystals by this kind of the in situ pyrolyzation process.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for detecting carbon molecules and investigating their crystallization degree. Fig. 3(a) shows that the FLG and TiO2 nanocrystals are uniformly dispersed in the formed film. Fig. 3(b) shows the Raman spectrum obtained by the zone in Fig. 3(a), and the characteristic peaks at 148 cm−1 (Eg(1)), 391 cm−1 (B1g), 516 cm−1 (A1g) and 637 cm−1 (Eg(2)) reveal the existence of TiO2.27 The bands located at 1352 and 1614 cm−1 correspond to the D (breathing mode of A1g symmetry) and G (E2g symmetry, in-plane bond-stretching motion of pairs of sp2 C atoms) bands respectively, which are the typical bonds of graphitic materials. The G band is a typical zone center vibration mode of crystalline graphite, corresponding to ordered sp2-bonded carbon, whereas the D band is an edge vibration mode or disordered layer. The sharp peaks and narrow full width at half maximum of the G and D bands indicate a high graphitization degree of the carbon coating layer, which is impossible to achieve from other carbon precursors (e.g., sugar) paralyzed at such low temperatures.19 The 2D peak at 2671 cm−1 is symmetric with a full width at half maximum of 39 cm−1, which is well fitted by a Lorentzian fit as indicated by the red fitted curve shown in Fig. 3(b), and the magnified spectrum around the 2D peak is shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b). On the basis of the Raman spectrum in Fig. 3(b) and the HRTEM results in Fig. 2, we can conclude that the coating layer is few-layer graphene (FLG).24,28,29

Investigating the interface combination of the FLG/TiO2 composite films is quite important to reveal the resultant quality and structural properties of the graphene-based hybrid films. Raman mapping images from Raman spectroscopy are a fast and useful tool for the distribution characterization of the composites containing carbon nanostructures,24 as the Raman spectra of TiO2 and graphene show non-overlapping well-defined features, which provides valuable distribution information of the two components that can help to build a complete description of the FLG/TiO2 composite films. The Raman data have been reorganized into intensity mapping, and Fig. 3(c) and (d) show the Raman mapping images of the FLG/TiO2 composite films. Fig. 3(c) shows the image obtained from the 2D bands of graphene. The ‘bright’ regions with high intensity show the existence of graphene, while the ‘dark’ regions are related to the presence of TiO2 nanocrystals, which confirms the uniform distribution of the graphene in the composite film. The strongest band of anatase TiO2 (Eg mode around 148 cm−1) is selected as the TiO2 fingerprint, and the Raman mapping in Fig. 3(d) also shows that the TiO2 nanocrystals are quite uniformly dispersed in the composite films. Therefore, the FLG is fairly homogeneously formed in the composite films by the in situ pyrolyzation process.
UV-Vis spectra were used to characterzie the optical absorption of all of the above samples in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm (Fig. 4). It is shown that the FLG/TiO2 composite films possess obviously enhanced UV and visible light absorption compared with TiO2 nanocrystals, and the 0.75 wt% FLG/TiO2 composite has the highest optical absorption intensity. Moreover, the absorption edge of the FLG/TiO2 composites shows a slight red-shift (403 nm), which is due to the formation of the C-doped TiO2 nanocrystals during the formation process of the FLG/TiO2 composite.30 As illustrated in Fig. 4(b), by C doping, the electrons produced under the irradiation by sunlight may be excited from the valence band to the conduction band (process A) or from the C impurity level to the conduction band (process B). Therefore, the improvement of the optical absorption ability of the FLG/TiO2 composite is due to the band gap narrowing and the enhancement of the utilization efficiency of solar energy by C doping.32 Moreover, the well-combined FLG with TiO2 nanocrystals in the composites also favors the rapid transfer of the photogenerated electrons and reduce the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the FLG/TiO2 composite.

The XPS results reveal that the 0.75 wt% FLG/TiO2 composite contains three elements, Ti, O and C, in the XPS survey spectrum in Fig. 5(a). To investigate the carbon chemical states in the sample, the C 1s core levels are illustrated in Fig. 5(b). For the FLG/TiO2 composite, two peaks with binding energies of 284.61 and 281.68 eV coexist. Generally, the peak at 284.54 eV is a signal of adventitious elemental carbon,31,32 which originates from the graphitic sp2 carbon atoms.18 There is no evidence for the formation of C–O species on the surface of the composite film from the FTIR spectra in Fig. 1(b), which confirms the existence of graphene instead of graphene oxide (GO).18 Meanwhile, the peak at 281.24 eV is associated with Ti–C bonds (C2−-doped), indicating that carbon atoms substitute for some oxygen atoms into the O–Ti–O lattice and form O–Ti–C bonds during the in situ pyrolyzation process, and C-doping in the composites could induce the red-shift of the absorption edge to the visible light region, as shown in Fig. 4. The Ti 2p spectrum in Fig. 5(c) shows that the 2p3/2 peak of Ti is located at 464.17 eV, and the 1s peak of the O2− valence state is located at 531.33 eV, with the absorbed O observed at 529.59 eV in Fig. 5(d).

Fig. 6(a) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the 0.75 wt% FLG/TiO2 composite film, which displays that the film thickness is about 15 μm. Performance optimization of the electrodes is illustrated by the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves under AM 1.5 conditions shown in Fig. 6(b), and the detailed performance is listed in Table 1. Choosing the total active cell area of 0.25 cm2, the solar cells with the pure TiO2 nanocrystals without graphene possess a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.55 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 651 mV, fill factor (FF) of 0.568 and energy conversion efficiency (η) of 5.01%. Interestingly, the photoelectric performance was enhanced by using the FLG/TiO2 composite materials, and when the graphene amount is 0.75 wt%, the corresponding performance is best, with a Jsc of 18.03 mA cm−2, Voc of 686 mV, FF of 0.667 and η of 8.25%. Therefore, the conversion efficiency and fill factor increase by 65% and 18% respectively with applying graphene in the 0.75 wt% FLG/TiO2 composites.

Normally, the value of Voc is determined by the potential difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the chemical potential of the redox species (Ered) in the electrolyte, as described in eqn (1),33 in which γ is the characteristic constant of TiO2 tailing states, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, e is the elementary charge and Ne is the effective density of states at the TiO2 conduction band edge. (1)
In general, the Ered and ECB would not change significantly in DSSCs fabricated under similar conditions. Voc is determined by the potential of the electron density (n) in TiO2, and it is influenced by the surface charge and charge recombination. The Voc will increase with the increase of the electron density (n) in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. After decorating with FLG, some carbon atoms are doped into the crystal structure of the TiO2 nanocrystals and form a carbon impurity level inside the band gap, as proved by the UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 4(a) and the XPS spectra in Fig. 5. Moreover, the well-combined graphene and TiO2 nanocrystals will also favor the fast transfer of the photoexcited electrons from the TiO2 CB to the external circuit, as shown in Fig. 4(b), which will be proved by the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) data. Therefore, the narrowed band gap and the fast transfer ability of the photoexcited electrons of the FLG/TiO2 composites will increase the electron density (n) in the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 nanocrystals, and thus increase the Voc with the formation of the FLG/TiO2 composites, as shown in Table 1.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is defined by the adsorption of the dye molecules in Fig. 6(c). Firstly, the improvement of the IPCE is due to the high adsorption of the dye molecules and the low charge recombination. Moreover, the IPCE curves in Fig. 6(c) are well fitted with the absorption spectra of the dye molecules, and it is believed that most IPCE peaks originate from the dye molecules' absorption. Secondly, the optical absorption at about 530 nm is assigned to the 2B2g → 2B1g transition of the 3d electrons of the Ti3+ ions,34 and the excitation of the Ti ions has a contribution to the IPCE plots to a certain extent. Therefore, the above two factors have a synergistic effect on the IPCE curve. Interestingly, the IPCE spectra of the FLG/TiO2 electrodes show a great enhancement in the conversion efficiency in the light region of 350–700 nm compared with the pure TiO2 nanocrystal electrodes. Therefore, it is believed that the increase of the maximum IPCE value from 25% to 68% is due to the FLG exiting between the TiO2 nanocrystals.
EIS is a widely-used technique to characterize the interfacial electrical properties of DSSCs at an applied bias with an AC amplitude of 10 mV under the one full sun illumination. It is observed that there are two main semicircles in Fig. 7(a). In order to match well with the above EIS data, the equivalent circuit of the DSSCs is also shown to explain the transportation and recombination processes of the exciting electrons in the cells (insetted in Fig. 7(a)). The fitted Rs represents the series resistance, accounting for the transport resistance of the FTO and the electrolyte. Rct and Cμ are the charge recombination resistance and the chemical capacitance at the dye-sensitized TiO2/electrolyte interface, respectively, while Rpt and Cpt are the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/Pt/FTO interface and the interfacial capacitance, respectively.
 Fig. 7  EIS measurements of the DSSCs of various FLG/TiO2 composite films: (a) Nyquist curves and (b) Bode phase plots. 
From the Nyquist plots in Fig. 7(a), the Rs of various films with or without the FLG is almost the same, which means that the resistance of FTO and the electrolyte has no change in spite of using different materials. However, the FLG/TiO2 composite photoanodes have a smaller value of 18.0 Ω for the Rct compared with 23.1 Ω of the pure TiO2 nanocrystal photoanode (Table 1), which clearly implies that the enhanced transfer of the charge carriers between the TiO2 film and electrolyte with the decoration of the FLG is due to the perfect mobility of charger carriers of the FLG. Moreover, the electron life-time (τ) is another important parameter for DSSCs, and it can be extracted from the Cμ and Rct using τ = CμRct by fitting the EIS curves. The FLG/TiO2 composites have longer lifetimes than that of the pure TiO2 nanocrystals. More importantly, the 0.75 wt% FLG/TiO2 composites have the longest lifetime (53.1 ms), which is consistent with the energy conversion efficiency data in Fig. 6(a). Therefore, the improvement to the photoelectric performance of DSSCs with the FLG/TiO2 composites in Fig. 6(a), such as the fill factor, is due to the presence of FLG between the TiO2 nanoparticles, which may improve the intrinsic conductivity and lifetime of electrons of the photoanodes by decreasing the value of Rct, as in Fig. 7(a).35,36
Moreover, the Bode plot in Fig. 7(b) also proves that the frequency of the second semicircle peak for the 0.75 wt% FLG/TiO2 composites shifts to a lower frequency compared with that of the pure TiO2 nanocrystal films, presenting a longer lifetime of the electrons in the photoanode, and this is accordance with the EIS results in Fig. 7(a).
4. Conclusions
Few-layer graphene/TiO2 composites were synthesized at low temperature by a thermolysis method, and used as photoanode films to improve the conversion efficiency of DSSCs. DSSCs based on 0.75 wt% FLG/TiO2 composites possess the highest conversion efficiency of 8.25%, which was increased by 65% compared with that of the pure TiO2 nanocrystal photoanodes (5.01%). Raman mapping images and EIS curves proved that the well-combined interface between the TiO2 nanocrystals and graphene induce lower charger recombination and faster transfer of the photoexcited electrons between the TiO2 films and electrolytes. UV-Vis spectra showed that the light absorption of the FLG/TiO2 composites are enhanced with a red-shift, which is related to the fact that both the C-doped TiO2 and FLG/TiO2 composites are formed during the in situ thermal decomposition process.
