    , Accepted 21st February 2020First published on 24th February 2020AbstractExtending photoabsorption to the near-infrared region (NIR) of the spectrum remains a major challenge for the enhancement of the photoelectric performance of perovskites. In this work, we propose a model of van der Waals heterostructures formed by CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films and graphdiyne (GDY) to improve the photocurrent in the NIR. To obtain better insights into the properties of GDY/perovskite heterostructures, we first determine its electronic properties using the first principles calculations. The charge transfer between GDY and perovskites leads to a built-in electrical field that facilitates the separation and the transport of the photogenerated carriers. Then, the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) is used to calculate the photocurrents of perovskite slabs with and without GDY. The photocurrents of GDY/perovskite heterostructures are nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of pristine perovskites in NIR due to the synergistic effect between GDY and perovskites. Furthermore, a polarization-sensitive photocurrent is obtained for a GDY/PbI2 heterostructure.
Introduction
Lead halide perovskites have shown enormous superiority among optoelectronic devices due to their remarkable properties of high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, high carrier mobility and low trap states.1–4 When used as photoactive layers in solar cells, perovskites are able to give a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2%,5 benefitting from the impressive photocurrent and photovoltage induced by these excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the insensitivity of the photocurrent in the near-infrared region (NIR) remains one of the key issues that restrict the effective performance improvement and extended application of perovskite based optoelectronic devices.6
To extend light absorption to the NIR, extensive efforts have been devoted to reducing the band gap of perovskites by compositional engineering.6–11 All three components (lead cation, organic cation and halide anion) can be replaced by one or multiple ions of similar sizes, leading to a variety of perovskites with different electronic structures. For example, Kanatzidis et al. demonstrated that the optical band gap can be reduced from 1.55 to 1.17 eV by employing a mixed lead tin (Pb1−xSnx) cation instead of a lead cation alone.7 However, the side-effects are the low chemical stability of Sn2+ and a low photovoltage. Alternatively, incorporating an additional inorganic or organic semiconductor NIR absorbing material has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy.12,13 In this regard, the desired choice and design for an additional material should create heterostructures with type II band alignment. Among them, 2D materials have become the most potential optoelectronic materials due to their extraordinary properties and therefore they have emerged as excellent candidates.
In fact, the vdW heterostructure of 2D materials offers a new route to tailor the electronic properties for desired or exotic physics beyond homogeneous materials.14–16 It is well known that a vdW heterostructure based on 2D materials with type II band alignment can efficiently facilitate the separation, extraction, and transportation of photogenerated carriers.17–19 As an emerging 2D carbon-based material, Graphdiyne (GDY) is an allotrope of graphene in possession of a natural direct band gap.20,21 Theoretical studies determine that GDY has a band gap of about 1.10 eV according to the GW method and a high carrier mobility of about 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as high electron density in comparison to graphene.22,23 These unique properties of GDY hint at great application potential in the field of energy, environment, and catalysis.24–29 Recently, GDY has been introduced into the hole transport layer,30 the electron transport layer,31–34 and the light absorption layer35,36 to successfully improve the device performance. Meng et al.35 indicated that the introduction of GDY in the perovskites can provide additional high-speed transport channels for the photogenerated carriers. However, the underlying interaction and light absorption mechanism of GDY and perovskites are still not fully established.
In this study, the GDY and perovskite slab (PbI2- and MAI-terminated) heterostructures are constructed and optimized. Then, systematical analyses of the structural and optoelectronic properties of the GDY/perovskite heterostructures are explored. The atomic separation, binding energy and charge transfer between GDY and perovskite slabs are determined by the way they interact through vdW interactions. Furthermore, the opposite charge transfer direction between the GDY and PbI2- and MAI-terminated perovskite allow GDY to selectively extract and transport photogenerated electrons and holes. Therefore, the formation of the GDY/perovskite heterostructure can assist in the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the influence of GDY on the whole photocurrent generation process is accurately simulated to probe the key characteristics and the potential physical mechanism of the photoelectric conversion process. Finally, the enhanced photocurrent in NIR is obtained. Furthermore, a polarization-sensitive photocurrent is obtained for the GDY/PbI2 heterostructure due to the anisotropy distribution of photogenerated electrons and holes. These results provide theoretical guidance to further improve the performance of perovskite based optoelectronic devices.
Computational methods
The first step to investigate the interaction between perovskites and GDY is to achieve an accurate description of the structure of the interfaces. In this work, we used DFT calculations to explore the structural stability, the electronic structure properties, and the termination effects of MAPbI3 surfaces (MA = CH3NH3). DFT calculations were implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).37 The exchange and correlation energy was described by a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional.38 Due to the weak interactions between the organic cations and the inorganic cage, the vdW-DF functional39 was taken into account. The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method was used to represent the interaction between the core and the valence electrons.40 An energy cutoff of 400 eV and a 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh was used to optimize the primitive cell of the perovskite. The same k-point density was adopted for all calculations. The primitive cell of the tetragonal phase of a MAPbI3 perovskite which is considered as the stable phase at room temperature was chosen as the base block of the system in our simulations. A relaxed atomic structure was obtained when the maximum atomic force was below 0.01 eV Å−1. The unit cell of the heterostructures, which contains 1 × 2 perovskite primitive cells in the vertical direction of stacking and three PbI6 octahedron layers along the stacking direction and a  GDY primitive cell, is fully relaxed with the method mentioned above. The lattice mismatch between the GDY and perovskites is less than 5%. Here, we consider two types of heterostructures, including the PbI2- and MAI-terminated slabs coupled with GDY, which consist of 192 atoms and 216 atoms in the unit cell, respectively.
The next step is to study the photoelectric conversion properties of the heterostructures. Instead of considering photons as a classical electric field, Chen et al. combined Density Functional based Tight Binding (DFTB) and the non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF) to accurately describe the electron–photon interaction with quantized photons.41–43 Therefore, we utilized this method to simulate the photoelectric conversion process in perovskite systems. We have defined the corresponding DFTB parameters for Pb, I, C, N, and H elements contained in MAPbI3 by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm with reference to quasiparticle GW calculations.44 And the electron–photon interaction is described by the self-energies Σ<,>ep(E), which are given by:45 Σ<,>ep(E) = Mμν[NG<,>(E ∓ Ep) + (N + 1)G<,>(E ± Ep)]Mμν(1) (2)Mμν is the electron–photon coupling matrix which is represented by the local basis functions μ and ν; C is a constant corresponding to the magnetic and dielectric constants; Fin is the incident power of photons; Ep and â denote the photon energy and polarization direction of the incident light, respectively;  is the electron momentum induced by the electron transport or electron transfer inside the system; N refers to the number of photons determined by the Bose–Einstein distribution function; G<,>(E) are the lesser and greater Green's function giving the statistics of the electron and the hole density.42 Using the lowest order approximation, G<,>(E) are given by: G<,>(E) = Gr0(E)[Σ<,>α(E) + Σ<,>ep(E)]Ga0(E)(3)where Σ<,>α(E) are the self-energies due to coupling between the device and lead α; Gr0(E) and Ga0(E) are the lesser and advanced Green's functions, respectively.
The expression of the current in the Meir–Wingreen formula46 is: (4)
The two terms in Iα represent the incoming and outgoing rate of electrons in the electrode α, respectively.47 In the photovoltaic device, the current is induced by a bias voltage on the electrodes and the electron–photon interaction. The current induced by the bias voltage is the elastic part: (5)where T(E) is the transmission coefficient. fα(E) is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function of electrode α. The current induced by the electron–photon interaction is the inelastic part, which represents the photocurrent and is expressed as: (6)here, G<,>ep(E) = Gr0(E)Σ<,>ep(E)Ga0(E) are the Green's functions representing the electron and hole fluctuations induced by the electron–photon interaction. The first (second) term of eqn (6) denotes the photogenerated holes (electrons) on the energy level E flowing to lead α.
Results and discussion
Firstly, the way by which GDY and the two kinds of perovskite surfaces (PbI2- and MAI-terminated surface) combine together was studied. There exist various possible configurations of GDY/perovskite heterostructures based on the different arrangements of GDY on top of a perovskite surface. Each configuration provides different interactions. To determine the optimal position, different configurations were examined. The stable configurations after optimization were used for the subsequent research. The fully-optimized heterostructures are shown in Fig. 1a. The interfacial distance D is defined as the shortest distance between the carbon atoms of the GDY layer and the surface Pb/I atoms of the perovskite slab along the stacking direction (z direction). The distances for the optimized GDY/PbI2 and GDY/MAI interfaces are 3.15 Å and 2.55 Å, respectively. Due to the interaction between the GDY layer and the MAPbI3 slab, the surface atoms of the perovskite slab slightly deviate from their equilibrium positions and the average angle between the Pb–I in the top octahedron and the z direction of the pristine PbI2-terminated slab, the GDY/PbI2 interface, the pristine MAI-terminated slab, and the GDY/MAI interface are 1.93°, 4.12°, 4.47°, and 4.92°, respectively. The weak polarization field following the deviation can facilitate the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes at the interface.48

Then, to characterize the interfacial stability, the interfacial binding energy (Ebin) is calculated as the difference between the total energy of the GDY/MAPbI3 heterostructure and the energy of each component. Fig. 1b shows that the combination of GDY and perovskites is energetically favorable. The Ebin and Earea (per unit area) of both heterostructures are listed in Table 1. The negative value indicates the attractive interaction between GDY and perovskites. The value of Earea for the GDY/PbI2 heterostructure is larger in absolute value than that of the GDY/MAI heterostructure. Therefore, the former is thermodynamically more stable. The geometry analysis shows no covalent bond in the interface, and the attractive interaction indicates the formation of vdW heterostructures between GDY and perovskites.

Furthermore, the charge density difference of the optimized GDY/MAPbI3 interface and the corresponding monomers was introduced to elucidate the innate characteristics of the interatomic interaction, as shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, the charge accumulation and depletion mainly occur in the interface region. The GDY/PbI2 interface shows a strong charge accumulation between the Pb atoms and the GDY layer (Fig. 2a). The charge density difference around the I atom is marginal, which indicates the electron transfer from the GDY layer to the perovskite slab. In the GDY/MAI interface (Fig. 2b), the charge depletion occurs between the surface I atoms and the GDY layer and the charge accumulates over the surface MA molecules, suggesting an attractive interaction between GDY and the MAI-terminated perovskite. The dominating interaction for the GDY/PbI2 interface is between the under-coordinated Pb atom and the π bond in GDY. For the GDY/MAI interface, the dominating interaction is the electrostatic interaction formed by the hydrogen atom on top of the MA molecule and the π bond in GDY. To determine the charge transfer between the perovskite and GDY more quantitatively, density-derived electrostatic and chemical charge (DDEC6)49–51 is used to calculate the net atomic charges of the two fragments. The calculated DDEC6 charges of the GDY fragment are 0.010 and −0.018 e for PbI2/GDY and MAI/GDY heterostructures, respectively. The positive value implies that the electron transfer occurs from GDY to the perovskite, whereas the negative value indicates a transfer in the opposite direction. Therefore, the direction of the built-in electric field is opposite for these two heterostructures due to the difference in charge transfer. When the heterostructure is illuminated, an electron–hole pair is generated after a photon is absorbed. The photogenerated hole then flows from the PbI2-terminated slab to GDY, whereas the photogenerated electron flows from GDY to the MAI-terminated slab. The opposite built-in electric field improves the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the solar cell.

The top and bottom panel in the left panel represent the side view and the top view of heterostructures. The yellow and cyan regions indicate charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. The charge density is 0.0002 e Å−3. 
To further understand the electronic structure, we calculated the band structure of the GDY/PbI2 and the GDY/MAI heterostructures. It is well known that the underestimation by PBE functional and the overestimation by ignoring the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) can fortunately cancel each other out when calculating the band gap of a lead-containing perovskite.52–54 Therefore, SOC is not considered in our calculations. The calculated band gap for isolated GDY is 0.48 eV, which is consistent with the previous result using the GGA method,55 but is lower than the result from a GW calculation.22 Due to the lattice mismatch between GDY and perovskites, the lattice parameter of GDY deviates from the value of isolated GDY after the formation of the perovskite/GDY heterostructure. The GDY band gap in the GDY/perovskite heterostructure is 0.30 eV, as illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The projections of the energy band contribution of GDY and the perovskite slab are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), respectively. It clearly demonstrates that the intrinsic electronic structures of both isolated GDY and perovskites are well preserved after stacking due to the weak physisorption between the GDY layer and the MAPbI3 slab. Therefore, the GDY layer retains the direct band gap and high carrier mobility after the formation of the heterostructure.

Next, we investigated the effects of GDY on the photoelectric conversion properties of perovskites based on the optimized perovskite structure with or without GDY. The device, which consists of the left electrode, the right electrode, and the central scattering region, is constructed to simulate the photoelectric conversion process. Both electrodes and the central scattering region are made of perovskites with or without GDY. The left and right electrodes are semi-infinite structures which extend along the x direction. The central scattering region is constructed with six MAPbI3 units duplicated along the x direction that contain 1152 atoms. The length of the central scattering region is 5.5 nm in the x direction. Here, x is the transport direction for the carriers. In the z direction, both PbI2- and MAI-terminated slabs consist of three layers of PbI6 octahedrons with organic MA molecules between the layers and separated by a vacuum region of 20.0 Å. In our model, periodic boundary conditions are applied to the y and z directions of the device. The optimized device structures are presented in Fig. 4a and b.

To investigate the band alignment of the interfacial structures, the integrated local projected density of states (LDOS) of the central scattering region along the z direction are plotted in Fig. 4. After the formation of the perovskite surface, the surface significantly alters the perovskite valence band (VB) landscape, which provides a directional gradient for the occupied states towards the GDY layer. As evidenced by Fig. 4c, the VB shifts toward higher energies when approaching the GDY layer, indicating a favorable energy landscape for hole injection into the GDY layer. Therefore, given the extraction and transfer of the holes from the perovskite side, the GDY layer in contact with the PbI2-terminated slab serves as the hole transport layer in the PSCs. However, the GDY/MAI interface presents a different picture. A large conduction band (CB) gradient exists in the interface region, which leads to the accumulation of electrons, as shown in Fig. 4d. Furthermore, the perovskite VB shows a slight bend towards lower energies in the GDY layer, prohibiting the injection of holes into the GDY layer. Thus, the asymmetric band bending in the VB and CB of the perovskite side can improve the charge collection efficiency in the GDY/perovskite interface and suppress the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the solar cells.
The generation of photocurrent involves two procedures: the generation of electron–hole pairs and the separation of electrons and holes. After the excitation of electron–hole pairs by the incident light, the separation mechanism is essential in the photoelectric conversion process. Here, we propose a p–n junction to provide a separating force with the built-in electric field around the junction. Experimentally, it is easy to control the p-type and n-type conduction in organic perovskites by modulating the precursor concentration.56 Yin et al.53 found that VI defects were the donor defects while VPb defects constituted acceptor defects by the calculation of transition energy level in MAPbI3. Herein, we constructed the n-type (p-type) perovskite by introducing VI (VPb) defects in the left (right) electrode to shift the Fermi level of perovskites and fabricate the p–n junction. The LDOS of the p–n junctions were also calculated for both the PbI2- and MAI-terminated slabs (as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). In the photoelectric conversion process, the n-type semiconductor corresponds to the electron transport layer and provides an electron transmission channel to the left electrode, while the p-type semiconductor corresponds to the hole transport layer and provides a hole transmission channel to the right electrode. Consequently, the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes leads to the generation of photocurrents in perovskite slabs. Here, we consider the polarization direction of the photons in the x–y plane. The incident power is 1 kW m−2. Fig. 5a and b show the simulation results of the photocurrent varying with photon energy. For the pristine PbI2-terminated and the pristine MAI-terminated slab, there are weak photocurrents for photon energies lower than 2.2 eV. This is due to the large band gap of the pristine perovskite slabs. Enhancing the photocurrent in this photon energy region is an effective strategy to improve photovoltaic efficiency. Then, we consider the perovskite heterostructures by introducing GDY. The corresponding photocurrents are significantly enhanced in the photon energy region below 2.2 eV. The new photocurrent peak present around 1.7 eV can be explained by the absorption peak in GDY that appears in this region.22 Furthermore, the photocurrents for the polarization of photons in the x direction and y direction are markedly different for the GDY/perovskite heterostructures.

The number of photogenerated electrons and holes on the energy level E in the PbI2-terminated systems (e) and spatial distribution of the density of states corresponding to the two probability distribution sharp peaks in the GDY/PbI2 heterostructure (f). The red and black contours represent the spatial distribution of holes for peak 1 and electrons for peak 2, respectively. The blue arrows show the transition direction at 45° and 315°. The blue shaded region shows the different transition distances at 45° and 315°. 
To investigate the polarization-sensitive photocurrents for these perovskite p–n junctions, we considered the polarization direction of the incident photon varying in the x–y plane, and the direction was defined as the angle θ measured from the x-axis. The photon energy is set to 2.70 eV, which corresponds to the photocurrent peak as shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5c and d show the simulated photocurrents as a function of polarization angle θ for the PbI2-terminated systems and MAI-terminated systems, respectively. The results for the GDY/PbI2 heterostructure show polarization-sensitive photocurrents with a maximum value at 45°/225° and a minimum value at 135°/315°. Meanwhile, the results for the MAI-terminated systems and the pristine PbI2-terminated slab show negligible polarization-sensitive photocurrents. The polarization-sensitive photocurrents can be explained from the definition of the electron–photon coupling matrix in eqn (2), in which the electron–photon coupling is proportional to the â·.57â is the unit vector of the polarization direction of the incident light.  represents the electron momentum induced by the electron transfer in the photoexcitation process. Thus, the direction of  is directly determined by the space distribution of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the electrons (or holes) on a different energy level E show a different pattern of space distribution. And the number of photogenerated electrons and holes on the energy level E can be obtained from the Green's function G<,>ep(E) and derived as: (7)where S is the overlap matrix. We plotted the number of photogenerated electrons and holes by varying the energy E for the PbI2-terminated systems (Fig. 5e) and MAI-terminated systems (Fig. S4, ESI†).
For the GDY/PbI2 heterostructure, most of the photogenerated electrons (holes) come from the single peak 1 (peak 2). The electron momentum  during the photoexcitation process mainly originates from the transition between these two peaks. Thus, the direction of  is generally determined by the space distribution of the energy level around peak 1 and peak 2. The corresponding LDOS distributions in the x–y plane are shown in Fig. 5f. It shows that the transition distance is smaller in the 45°/225° direction than in the 135°/315° direction. Therefore, more photons polarized along the 45°/225° direction are absorbed and more electron–hole pairs are produced, leading to a higher photocurrent. While, for the MAI-terminated slab and the pristine PbI2-terminated slab, both photogenerated electrons and holes distribute in a broad energy range with multiple peaks (Fig. 5e). The different space distributions on these energy levels smooth the anisotropy and lead to a negligible polarization-sensitive photocurrent. The polarization-sensitive performance of the GDY/PbI2 heterostructure in the shortwave region provides potential applications in polarized light detectors.
Conclusions
In summary, we investigate the structure and the optoelectronic properties of the GDY/perovskite using the first principles method. GDY and two different perovskite surfaces form vdW heterostructures. We show that the charge transfer direction between GDY and perovskites is opposite in the PbI2-terminated systems and the MAI-terminated systems. Therefore, GDY can be used to selectively extract electrons and holes because of the built-in electric field between GDY and perovskites, thereby establishing a pathway for the transport of carriers. A defect-assisted p–n device structure was used to study the photoelectric conversion process using the DFTB + NEGF method. GDY can significantly enhance photoabsorption in the near infrared region. Further analysis shows that the photocurrents in the GDY/PbI2 heterostructure are polarization-sensitive photocurrents due to the anisotropy distribution of photogenerated electrons and holes, with the maximum photocurrent observed for the 45°/225° direction. Our results highlight the role of vdW heterostructures in obtaining excellent material properties and propose a new route to extend the application of organic–inorganic perovskites in photocatalysis and photodetectors.
