    , Accepted 4th January 2012First published on 10th January 2012AbstractSimple solution phase, catalyst-free synthetic approaches that offer monodispersed, well passivated, and non-aggregated colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals have presented many research opportunities not only for fundamental science but also for technological applications. The ability to tune the electrical and optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals by manipulating the size and shape of the crystals during the colloidal synthesis provides potential benefits to a variety of applications including photovoltaic devices, light-emitting diodes, field effect transistors, biological imaging/labeling, and more. Recent advances in the synthesis and characterization of colloidal lead chalcogenide nanocrystals and the achievements in colloidal PbS or PbSe nanocrystals solar cells have demonstrated the promising application of infrared-emitting colloidal lead chalcogenide nanocrystals in photovoltaic devices. Here, we review recent progress in the synthesis and optical properties of colloidal lead chalcogenide nanocrystals. We focus in particular upon the size- and shape-controlled synthesis of PbS, PbSe, and PbTe nanocrystals by using different precursors and various stabilizing surfactants for the growth of the colloidal nanocrystals. We also summarize recent advancements in the field of colloidal nanocrystals solar cells based on colloidal PbS and PbSe nanocrystals.Huiying FuHuiying Fu studied conjugated materials based on arylamines for organic electroluminescent devices during her Ph.D. work with Prof. Fei Xiao at Fudan University.

1. Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are tiny light-emitting crystals consisting of hundreds to a few thousand atoms each with typical dimensions ranging from 1–2 to about 100 nm. These NCs exhibit interesting size- and shape-dependent optical and electrical properties which cannot be achieved by their bulk counterparts. Over the past decades, syntheses of semiconductor NCs have been intensively pursued not only for fundamental scientific research interest but also for many technological applications. In many of the bottom-up approaches for fabricating nanostructured materials, colloidal chemical synthetic method has proved itself to be an effective route for producing NCs with well-controlled size and good size dispersion.1–3 With the crystal surface fully passivated by organic stabilizing ligands, colloidal semiconductor NCs offer great potential in future optoelectronic applications in view of their compatibility with the low-cost, large-area capability, solution-based deposition techniques, such as drop-casting, spin-coating, and ink-jet printing. Furthermore, the preparation of the NCs with elongated and hyper-branched morphologies has also been achieved through this colloidal synthetic method.4–6 It has been demonstrated that the efficiency of the photovoltaic devices could be dramatically improved by dispersing CdSe nanorods in place of CdSe nanoparticles in a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) matrix.6
Lead chalcogenide (PbX, X = S, Se, and Te) NCs are a particularly promising class of nanostructured semiconductor materials because they possess excellent photosensitivity in the near-infrared (NIR) region, with the energy bandgap tunable from about 0.3 to >2.0 eV.7–10 Their broadband absorption, along with the large exciton Bohr radii of these materials (18, 46, and 150 nm for PbS, PbSe, and PbTe, respectively), make PbX NCs ideal candidates for applications in solar cells, electroluminescent devices, photodetectors, thermoelectronics, telecommunications, and lasers. Such large Bohr radii and small masses for electrons and holes promote effective charge delocalization in PbX NCs films and therefore high charge carrier mobilities can be anticipated. It was reported that arrays of close-packed 9.2 nm PbSe NCs treated with a hydrazine solution can exhibit excellent electron mobility as high as 0.95 cm2 V−1 s−1.11 PbX NCs have been the focus of recent research also because of the discovery and characterization of multiple exciton generation (MEG) in these materials.12–15 The formation of multiple electron–hole pairs per absorbed photon has the potential to significantly improve the power conversion efficiencies in photovoltaic devices.
Recent development in colloidal synthesis now enables fabrication of high quality PbS, PbSe, and PbTe NCs with a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and dimensions.16–23 Under optimized synthetic conditions, gram quantities of the monodisperse PbS and PbSe NCs could be produced through colloidal chemistry techniques, which paves the way for the commercial production and industrial application of PbS and PbSe NCs.16,24,25 From an optoelectronic perspective, the high molar extinction coefficients and strong photoluminescence of colloidal PbS and PbSe NCs make the materials superior for electroluminescent and photovoltaic devices.26–32 Solution processed solar cells based on colloidal PbS and PbSe NCs have recently demonstrated great achievements in both energy conversion efficiency and device stability. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6% has been reported for heterojunction solar cells based on colloidal infrared-emitting PbS NCs, crystal surface passivated by inorganic ligand.33 Excellent stability in a ZnO/PbS based heterojunction solar cell for 1000 h of continuous illumination in ambient air conditions has been demonstrated by Luther et al.34 Schottky type solar cells based on colloidal ternary lead chalcogenide NCs also showed intriguing photovoltaic performance.35
In this research progress paper, we summarize the development in colloidal lead chalcogenide NCs, including lead sulfide, lead selenide, and lead telluride, involving the synthesis, optical properties, and photovoltaic applications based on these colloidal NCs. We present three different types of solar cells that have emerged: Schottky junction photovoltaic cells, heterojunction photovoltaic cells (including bulk heterojunction structure), and tandem photovoltaic cells. A detailed description of the latest research achievements in the performance and stability of PbS and PbSe NCs solar cells will be particularly addressed.

2.1. Synthesis of colloidal PbS nanocrystals
Bulk PbS has a cubic crystal structure and a narrow bandgap of 0.41 eV, which makes PbS NCs intriguing as emitters in the NIR region. In 2003, Hines and Scholes reported the first synthesis of colloidal infrared-emitting PbS NCs with nice size-distribution.9 Preparation of PbS NCs was demonstrated by using lead(II) oxide (PbO) and bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide (TMS sulfide) as the lead and sulfur precursors, respectively. Oleic acid (OA) was employed as the stabilizing ligand and the reaction was carried out in a solvent mixture of 1-octadecene (ODE) and OA. The size of the NCs can be tuned by varying the concentration of OA in ODE, the feed molar ratios of OA to PbO and PbO to TMS, the injection temperature, the injection time, the growth temperature, and the growth time. The absorption spectra of the as-synthesized colloidal PbS NCs with the first excitonic absorption peak spanning from 800 to 1800 nm were shown in the report (Fig. 1). After the isolation from reaction solution, the as-synthesized PbS NCs were redispersed in toluene and underwent a size-focusing aging process to obtain almost monodisperse colloidal PbS NCs (size-distribution of 10–15%). Modifications of the synthetic conditions towards the PbO–TMS–OA reaction system, such as diluting OA in ODE and using n-trioctylphosphine (TOP) as the co-ligand, were made to improve the size-distribution and the stability of the as-synthesized NCs and to enhance the passivation of the ligands.24,29,36–39 Colloidal PbS NCs prepared via a synthetic route with a low concentration of OA in ODE showed a narrow size distribution and a long-term photophysical stability over four months of storage in a freezer (−20 °C) without any inert gas protection (Fig. 2).24 A feature worth noting of the PbO–TMS–OA reaction approach is that PbS NCs with the diameter as small as 2.6 nm were synthesized through this system.39 Hyun et al. and Jasienial et al. have studied the size dependence of the energy levels of OA-capped PbS NCs by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and photoelectron spectroscopy (PESA) methods, respectively.40,41Fig. 3a shows the valence and conduction band-edge energies of PbS NCs as a function of particle diameter and the first excitonic absorption energy, determined by CV, PESA, and k·p theory. PbS NCs prepared from the PbO–TMS–OA synthetic route have been proved to be remarkably effective in the applications of photovoltaic cell,24,34 electroluminescent devices,43,44 and electrogenerated chemiluminescence.37

The synthetic method for colloidal PbS NCs with lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) and elemental sulfur (S) as the precursors in a reaction medium of oleylamine (OLA) was reported by Cademartiri et al. and Joo et al.16,45 Spherical PbS NCs with the size ranging from 4.2 to 6.8 nm, occurred at wavelengths between 1245 and 1625 nm, and size distribution ranging from 6 to 10% were prepared from the PbCl2–S–OLA reaction system. The as-obtained OLA-capped PbS NCs showed a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the photoluminescence peak as low as 52 meV and a Stokes shift as small as 10 meV. The calculated price of the PbS NCs prepared via this route was about $14 (U.S. dollar) per gram, including purification, demonstrating the industrial scale production capability of this approach. By using a low concentration of PbCl2 in OLA, nearly cubic colloidal PbS NCs were obtained with a diameter of 13 nm.
Recently, the preparation of two-dimensional (2D) PbS nanosheets was demonstrated by Schliehe et al. through an approach of 2D oriented attachment of spherical PbS nanoparticles into ultrathin single-crystal sheets.46 The oriented attachment was initiated by the presence of chlorine-containing co-solvents, such as 1,2-dichloroethane or similar linear chloroalkanes, which altered the nucleation and growth rates during the primary NC formation. The absorption and emission spectra at various stages of the reaction showed that the spectral position of the original bands did not change during the growth process therefore the size of the particles (Fig. 4), proving that PbS nanosheets were formed directly from the pre-formed nanoparticles by oriented attachment.

The absorption spectra were normalized to the absorption at 400 nm, and the emission spectra to the maximum of each curve.

Single-source precursors have also been used to produce colloidal PbS NCs.17,30,47–49 A single-step synthetic approach of decomposition of lead ethyl or hexadecylxanthate in trioctylamine (TOA) was developed to produce zero-dimensional (0D) PbS nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) PbS nanorods, and 2D PbS nanosheets. 0D spherical PbS nanoparticles with an average diameter of 6 nm and a size distribution of 10–13% were synthesized by using lead ethylxanthate in TOA at a growth temperature of 60 °C. Ultranarrow TOA-coated PbS nanorods with a diameter of 1.7 nm and lengths of 12 to 15 nm were prepared through a route of lead hexadecylxanthate in TOA (Fig. 5). By tuning the reaction temperature, PbS nanorods with a diameter of 2.5 nm were obtained.48 Both nanorods showed molecule-like discrete narrow optical properties with strong absorption and photoluminescence reflecting strong confinement of the charge carriers. Ultrathin strictly 2D nanosheets with dimensions of 40–50 nm in length and ∼25 nm in width were prepared by addition of lead ethylxanthate in TOA at 60 °C first and then annealing the reaction at an elevated temperature of 100 °C for 90 min.

2.2. Optical properties of colloidal PbS nanocrystals
Colloidal PbS NCs with the first excitonic absorption peak ranging from 600 to 2200 nm have been prepared from several colloidal synthetic routes. It was reported that OLA-capped PbS NCs showed size-dependent molar extinction coefficients at energy bandgaps, which was in good agreement with the theoretical calculations using Maxwell–Garnett effective medium theory and the bulk semiconductor dielectric function.26,50 Compared with PbSe NCs, PbS NCs showed larger molar extinction coefficients at the same bandgap, indicating the more promising optical applications of PbS NCs. At photon energies far above the first excitonic transition, the absorption properties of PbS NCs were not influenced by quantum confinement, and therefore size and size distribution of the NCs, thus allowing for an accurate determination of NCs concentration by using molar extinction coefficients at high energies.
Colloidal PbS nanocrystals, nanoparticles and nanorods showed high photoluminescence quantum yields (PL QYs) both at the as-synthesized state and after crystal surface functionalized by organic ligands such as acids and alcohols.29–32,51–54 For as-synthesized PbS NCs capped with OA and TOP, the PL QY was reported to be between 40 and 60% (the highest value as 80%) for the smaller nanocrystals (emission peaks in the range of ∼1100 to 1300 nm).29 For larger NCs (emission peaks ranging from ∼1300 to 1600 nm), the QY was found to be between 25% and 40%. Acharya et al. demonstrated a typical QY of 45%, measured relative to anthracene dye, for the as-synthesized PbS nanorods.30 Observation of ultraefficient MEG in solutions of colloidal PbS NCs was reported by Ellingson et al.13 A QY of about 280% for 5.5 nm PbS NCs was observed at a photon energy of about 4.5 times the energy gap.
2.3. Photovoltaic devices based on colloidal PbS nanocrystals
Great development in solution processed photovoltaic devices based on colloidal PbS NCs has been achieved since the reports on photovoltaic effect of colloidal PbS NCs by McDonald et al. in 2004 and 2005.55,56 A variety of device fabrication techniques have been employed to pursue high efficiencies of the full solar spectrum sensitive PbS NCs solar cells.33,34,57–81 In most of the reports on PbS NCs solar cells, ethanedithiol (EDT), benzenedithiol (BDT), or 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) were used to replace the original insulating long-chain ligand, oleic acid, and to cross-link the NCs during layer-by-layer solution deposition. This cross-linking method provided pinhole- and crack-free NCs thin film and short inter-nanocrystal spacing, which enabled improved electron and hole transport (Fig. 6).60–62 Up until now, PbS NCs-based solar cells with the device architecture of simple Schottky junction, depleted heterojunction, depleted bulk heterojunction, and tandem structure have been explored. The photovoltaic performance of solar cells based on PbS NCs is listed in Table 2.
 Fig. 6  (a) TEM and (b) HRTEM images of PbS NCs cross-linked with 1,3-benzenedithiol. After cross-linking, the inter-NC distance was reduced from 2 nm, see ref. 24, to 0.6 nm. (Results obtained from the Ye Tao research group at National Research Council Canada).

To the best of our knowledge, the first PbS NCs photovoltaic devices with the Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM1.5G) PCE over 1% were reported with a Schottky structure employed and butylamine (BA)-capped PbS NCs as the active layer.57 However, the devices showed poor air stability and thereby the encapsulation of the device was needed for its long-term storage. Ever since cross-linking of bidentate thiols was utilized for the deposition of the NCs films, the photovoltaic performance and long-term air stability of PbS NCs-based solar cells have been greatly improved.24,38,58–60
A Schottky photovoltaic cell based on PbS NCs cross-linked with 1,4-BDT has achieved an impressive PCE as high as 4.0% under 1 sun of simulated AM1.5G illumination, reported by Szendrei et al.59 The effect of different bandgaps of PbS NCs on the photovoltaic performance and key parameters of the Schottky devices were presented in the report. The results showed that the short-circuit current density of the Schottky solar cells depends linearly on the light intensity and the photocurrent is not space-charge limited.
Tang et al. reported the air- and light-stability of Schottky solar cells based on 1,2-EDT cross-linked PbS NCs.38,58 It was demonstrated that small and large PbS NCs formed different oxidation products when the non-packaged devices were exposed to air; lead sulfite formed primarily for small crystals and lead sulfate for large crystals, which explained the cause of the improvement in the air stability of small PbS NCs solar cells compared to large PbS NCs-based devices. The unencapsulated PbS NCs (the bandgap at 1.3 eV) solar cells retained 87% of their initial PCE after 63 h of continuous and simultaneous 100 mW cm−2 illumination and current–voltage scanning in air. The mechanism underlying device degradation at the metal–semiconductor interface was also investigated. Insertion of a very thin LiF layer between the Al electrode and the NCs film suppressed the interfacial reaction and oxidation and dramatically improved air stability.


2.3.2. Heterojunction PbS nanocrystals solar cells and bulk heterojunction PbS nanocrystals solar cells. 
Based on the consideration of the limited open-circuit voltage and the poor barrier for hole injection into the electron-extracting electrode of the Schottky junction devices, heterojunction PbS NCs solar cells have been intensively investigated. Organic molecules, both polymers and small molecules, and n-type inorganic materials, such as semiconducting oxides, colloidal NCs, and carbon nanotubes, have been employed to pair with p-type PbS nanocrystals to build p–n heterojunction solar cells or bulk p–i–n heterojunction solar cells.
Organic–inorganic solar cells based on PbS nanocrystals. 
A planar heterojunction photovoltaic device consisting of a thin film of 1,3-BDT cross-linked PbS NCs and vacuum deposited C60 layer was reported in 2009.62 The device showed an AM1.5G PCE of 2.2%, compared to 1.6% of the PbS NCs-only Schottky cell, confirming the effective reduced recombination current by the insertion of C60. A highly efficient bulk heterojunction solar cell based on 1,3-BDT-PbS NCs and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was presented by Tsang et al.68 Continuous phase separation was obtained in the composite of 1,3-BDT cross-linked PbS NCs and PC61BM (Fig. 7). An efficient PCE of 3.7% under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination was achieved for the resulting hybrid heterojunction device. Seo et al. reported hybrid bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells based on 1,2-EDT cross-linked PbS NCs and polymer poly(2,6-(N-(1- octylnonyl)di-thieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole)-alt-4,7)-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PDTPBT) (Fig. 8), with PbS NCs acting as the electron acceptor for the devices.78 The well matched energy levels of PDTPBT and PbS NCs (the first excitonic absorption peak at 795 nm) offered efficient photo-induced charge transfer in the blend film of PDTPBT:PbS. A promising PCE of 3.78% was obtained for the hybrid bulk heterojunction device containing PDTPBT:PbS as the active layer.

 Fig. 8  Molecular structures of organic materials employed in the reported PbS NCs solar cells. 
Chen et al. developed a p/p:n (inorganic/organic:organic) solar cell based on a PbS NCs film and a blend layer of poly[4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl] (PSBTBT) (Fig. 8) and PC61BM.79 The most efficient photovoltaic cell based on the p/p:n structure showed a PCE of 4.1%, with 1.39 eV PbS NCs applied in the devices, whose energy levels matched well with the LUMO level of PC61BM and HOMO level of PSBTBT, thus allowing for efficient electron injection from PbS to PC61BM. It was demonstrated that PC61BM worked as efficient electron acceptor for both PbS NCs and PSBTBT, and thereby promoted the efficient dissociation and collection of photogenerated carrier in the inorganic and organic layer of the devices. The external quantum efficiency curves exhibited the efficient contributions to the photocurrent from each material presented in the device (PbS NCs, PSBTBT, and PC61BM).
All-inorganic solar cells based on PbS nanocrystals. 
Efficient PCEs over 5% have been achieved for depleted heterojunction devices based on TiO2/PbS, ZnO/PbS, and Zr-doped TiO2/PbS.33,65,71,73 Pattantyus-Abraham et al. reported a 5.1% AM1.5G PCE from TiO2/PbS heterojunction devices, where PbS NCs were cross-linked by MPA, in 2010.65 The device showed a VOC of 0.51 V, a JSC of 16.2 mA cm−2, and an fill factor (FF) of 58%. The increased VOC and FF over previous reported values are attributed to the improved device architecture with the placement of transparent TiO2 on the illuminated side of the device thereby the formation of a p–n heterojunction between PbS and TiO2. By using inorganic atomic ligand passivation, a PCE up to 6% was obtained for TiO2/PbS solar cells, presented by Tang et al.33 This monovalent atomic ligand passivation approach for nanocrystals enabled good passivation of surface defects and thus excellent charge carrier transport was obtained for the as-prepared thin films. Liu et al. investigated the incorporation of a series of metal ions into TiO2, aiming at tuning the properties of TiO2 to further explore the photovoltaic performance of devices based on doped TiO2 and PbS NCs.73 By doping TiO2 with zirconium (Zr), an n-type electrode with the conduction band-edge of 3.95 eV was obtained, which matched perfectly with p-type PbS NCs with the conduction bandedge of 3.90 eV. The resulted solar cell based on Zr–TiO2/PbS yielded an impressive PCE of 5.69%.
By using a quantum funnel comprising of PbS NCs with different diameters, ranging from 4 to 4.7 nm, and accordingly different bandgaps, spanning from 1.06 to 1.35 eV, a depleted heterojunction solar cell with a graded structure based on TiO2/PbS was reported (Fig. 9).75 The graded device structure ensured efficient transport of photoelectrons from their point of generation toward the electron acceptor TiO2 by an additional driving force contributed by the quantum funnel. PV performance under 1 sun irradiation showed the FF was enhanced in the graded device, average value 54%, compared to the ungraded one, average value 49%, and resulted in an average PCE of 2.7% for graded devices and 2.0% for ungraded ones.

Stability checking of depleted heterojunction solar cells based on ZnO/PbS and TiO2/PbS were performed by Luther et al. and Zhai et al., respectively.34,70 A cell with a structure of ITO/ZnO/EDT–PbS/Au and a PCE of 3% experienced minor changes in VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE over thousands of hours of continuous illumination in ambient air conditions.34 Zhai et al. studied the effect of the short-term and long-term exposures of TiO2/PbS solar cells to air on the device performance.70 The short-term air exposures lead to the increases in VOC and FF, and a slightly decreasing in JSC, and the effect was fully reversible upon removal of the device from air. The long-term air exposures resulted in a reduced conductivity and thus a decrease in JSC. It was demonstrated that the recovery of JSC could be obtained by soaking the long-term air-exposed device in an EDT solution for 5 min.
Instead of using the wide-bandgap oxide semiconductors, TiO2 and ZnO as discussed, to build PbS NCs-consisting heterojunction photovoltaic devices, researchers also have developed efficient PbS NCs-based heterojunction solar cells with other inorganic materials, such as amorphous silicon (a-Si), SnS NCs, Bi2S3 NCs, and carbon nanotubes.61,63,76,77 The PCE of the PbS/Bi2S3 NCs heterojunction solar cell was reported to be 1.6% with a JSC of 8.81 mA cm−2.76 The development in the photovoltaic performance is expected to be obtained by the optimization of synthesis and post-synthetic procedure of the n-type NCs and the device architecture. The application of PbS/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanoarchitecture for solar cells was reported by Wang et al.77 PbS/MWCNTs nanoarchitecture was prepared by simply mixing high quality PbS NCs and oleylamine pre-functionalized MWCNTs. Steady state and dynamic photoluminescence characterizations showed a solid evidence of electron transfer from photo-excited PbS NCs to MWCNTs. The as-prepared PbS/MWCNTs were incorporated into P3HT to build the P3HT:PbS/MWCNTs nanohybrid, where PbS NCs worked as the infrared light absorber and P3HT and MWCNTs functioned as the collector and transporter for the photo-excited electrons and holes, respectively. Solar cells based on P3HT:PbS/MWCNTs exhibited a PCE of 3.03% even when no ligand-exchange was performed to replace the long chain ligand oleylamine on the surface of the NCs.
The first depleted bulk heterojunction solar cell based on TiO2 and PbS NCs was reported in 2010 (Fig. 10).74 The bulk heterojunction concept helped the device overcome the tradeoff between exciton diffusion length and optical absorption length. The device with the structure of TiO2/MPA-PbS:TiO2 showed an intriguing PCE of 5.5% under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination. The external infrared quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices reached 40% at their 950 nm excitonic peak, about a two-fold increase relative to the EQE value of the heterojunction cell with the structure of TiO2/MPA-PbS. An improvement in JSC of 30% relative to heterojunction cell led to a JSC as high as 20.6 mA cm−2 for the TiO2/MPA-PbS:TiO2 solar cell.

An issue of critical importance that has been neglected in almost all the literature reported so far is the detailed study of the interfaces in heterojunction devices. More systematic work in this aspect will help us understand the limitations and opportunities of NCs based photovoltaic devices.


2.3.3. Tandem solar cells based on colloidal PbS nanocrystals. 
Recently, Choi et al. and Wang et al. reported tandem solar cells fabricated from a combination of PbS NCs with different bandgaps.80,81 Multi-junction solar cells have been reported as an effective method to increase the harvested energy from the sun's broad spectrum. PbS NCs with the first excitonic absorption peak at 1.6 eV were used as the visible junction (front cell) and 1 eV PbS NCs as the infrared junction (back cell) for both cases. In Wang's report, the PbS NCs layers in subcells were electrically connected by the introduction of a transparent interlayer, MoO3/ITO/aluminium-doped-zinc-oxide (AZO)/TiO2, where the recombination of photoholes from the valence band of the front cell and photoelectrons from the conduction band of the back cell happened. The interlayer provided a progressed alignment of energy levels from the front to the back cell which allowed the efficient collection and recombination of electrons and holes without degrading the overall photovoltage of the cell (Fig. 11). The device achieved a VOC of 1.06 V, equal to the sum of the open-circuit voltages of the individual single junctions. The tandem PbS NCs solar cell showed a 1 sun AM1.5G PCE of 4.21%.

3. Lead selenide
3.1. Synthesis of colloidal PbSe nanocrystals
The first report on the synthesis of well-controlled colloidal lead selenide NCs appeared in 2001.82 Colloidal synthesis of PbSe NCs was demonstrated by employing lead oleate and n-trioctylphosphine selenide (TOPSe) as the precursors in a diphenylether–TOP medium via a hot-injection approach. The diameter of as-synthesized PbSe NCs could be tuned from 3.5 to 15 nm and a size distribution about 10% was obtained, which could be further narrowed down to 5% by size-selective precipitation. Evans et al. and Yu et al. demonstrated the preparation of spherical PbSe NCs with the diameter ranging from <2 to 13 nm, occurred at first excitational absorbtion peaks between 900 to 2520 nm, from the reaction of PbO and TOPSe in ODE with the presence of OA.19,83 The as-prepared PbSe NCs showed a very narrow size-distribution of 5–7% for NCs with diameters below 10 nm. Evans et al. reported the ultrasmall magic-sized PbSe nanoclusters with the fluorescence in the NIR region (900 nm) with remarkable quantum efficiencies consistently greater than 50% from the reaction system of PbO–TOPSe–OA.19 Size dependent energy levels of PbSe NCs were studied by CV and PESA methods, reported by Choi et al. and Jasieniak et al., respectively (Fig. 3b).41,42
Synthesis of spherical PbSe NCs from lead acetate (PbAc2) (lead acetate trihydrate was used as the precursor in ref. 84) and TOPSe in a reaction medium of diphenylether and OA was also reported.8,84 The size of NCs can be easily tuned from 3 to 10 nm by varying the precursor concentrations, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The resulting NCs had very good size-distribution without any post-synthetic size selection techniques needed. Reaction of PbAc2 and TOPSe in a solvent mixture of diphenylether, OA, and TOP offered TOP/OA capped PbSe NCs with efficient mid-infrared (mid-IR) photoluminescence from 2 to 3.5 μm at room temperature and to 4.1 μm at 77 K (Fig. 12).28 The mid-IR emission properties of colloidal PbSe NCs allow researchers to fulfill the expectations of PbSe NCs in industrial applications such as remote sensing and atmospheric monitoring.

Houtepen et al. studied the role of acetate in the PbAc2–TOPSe–OA reaction system and found the existence of acetate ions in the reaction mixture, even trace amounts, could lead to the formation of star-shaped PbSe.85 It was also demonstrated that the diameter of the PbSe NCs could be manipulated by varying the Pb:acetate molar ratio. The possible reason for these phenomena is that acetate is much smaller than oleate, thus the reduced steric hindrance between different crystals increased the rate of oriented attachment in return. On the basis of the observation and the reports of Cho and Lu,20,86,87 it was proposed that it is crucial to use lead precursors completely free of acetate to obtain spherical PbSe NCs. Jawaid et al. reported the synthesis of PbSe nanorods and multirods from PbAc2 and TOPSe in a solvent medium of squalane, OA, and TOP.88
By employing hexadecylamine (HDA) and n-tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) as co-surfactants into the colloidal PbSe NCs synthetic approach of diphenylether–OA–TOP–PbAc2–TOPSe, zigzag PbSe nanowires and straight PbSe nanowires were obtained through oriented attachment.20 The average length of the nanowires was typically 10 to 30 μm, while the average diameter could be tuned from ∼3.5 to ∼18 nm. However, it was hard to study the optical properties of the nanowires because of the low solubility and large scattering of the nanowires. On the other hand, wire formation of PbSe NCs were too fast for researchers to reveal the detailed transition process during the growth and further modify the morphology and size of the nanowires.
Instead of using TOPSe as the Se precursor for the synthesis of PbSe NCs, Koh et al. reported colloidal reactions based on tri(diethylamino)phosphine selenide (TDPSe) as the Se precursor.21,89 Monodisperse PbSe nanorods were prepared from PbO and TDPSe in a reaction mixture of ODE (or squalane) and OA. The growth of the PbSe nanorods was achieved at lower temperatures on a longer time scale which made the monitoring of the transition process of nanorod growth possible. The growth transition of PbSe NCs, from initial small particles to nanorods with a diameter of 3.8 nm and an aspect ratio of 5.5, followed by the formation of nanorods with a diameter of 4.1 nm and an aspect ratio of 10.7 and nanorods with a diameter of 5.7 nm and an aspect ratio of 5.1 were observed (Fig. 13). By studying the transition process during the growth, researchers can further explore the morphology and size of colloidal PbSe NCs by manipulating the reaction condition parameters.

3.2. Optical properties of colloidal PbSe nanocrystals
From the synthetic approach of PbO–TOPSe–OA and PbAc2–TOPSe–OA, spherical PbSe NCs with the diameter ranging from ∼2 to 15 nm and the first absorption spectra spanning from near infrared to mid-infrared were prepared. The size-dependent extinction coefficient at the bandgap of colloidal PbSe NCs has been reported and the value was in good agreement with theoretical value for bulk PbSe.27 Dai et al. reported the size-dependent molar extinction coefficient of PbSe NCs was proportional to 2.5 orders of the NC diameter.90 At photon energies well above the first excitonic transition, the absorption coefficients are independent of size and therefore size distribution, allowing for an accurate determination of NCs concentration.27
Wehrenberg et al. studied the inter- and intraband optical transition in colloidal PbSe NCs and determined the PL QY of PbSe NCs to be 85%, about 180 times more efficient than dye IR 26 (commercially available).91 It was shown that the as-synthesized PbSe NCs had a very small Stokes shift and the fluorescence lifetime of about a microsecond. The first reports on optical properties of as-prepared PbSe nanorods were presented by Koh et al.21,89 The nanorods showed well-defined first excitonic absorption peaks and comparable Stokes shift and fluorescence lifetimes to those of CdSe nanorods.92 The fluorescence QY of the PbSe nanorods was shown to be about 15%, which was remarkably higher than that of CdSe nanorods, implying the nanorods were of high quality.93
MEG efficiencies in colloidal PbSe NCs solutions and thin films have been demonstrated.12,13,15,94–96 It was reported that the threshold energy for MEG in PbSe NCs optical excitation was 2Eg.13 A QY of 300% for 3.9 nm PbSe NCs solution was achieved, indicating the creation of three excitons per absorbed photon (average number) for PbSe NCs at photon energies that are 4 times the NC energy gap. Luther et al. studied the MEG efficiency of coupled PbSe NCs, electronically coupled PbSe NCs obtained by using a thin film soaking treatment in 1 M hydrazine.94 No decrease in MEG efficiency of the electronically coupled PbSe film was observed compared with that of the isolated PbSe NCs in solution. MEG efficiency in PbSe quasi-one-dimensional NCs (nanorods) was also reported.15 An enhancement of MEG in PbSe nanorods over PbSe zero-dimensional NCs was obtained for PbSe nanorods solution, characterized by a two-fold increase in efficiency. The enhancement was also characterized by a decrease in the MEG threshold energy.
3.3. Photovoltaic devices based on colloidal PbSe nanocrystals
In 2006, Cui et al. reported a PbSe NCs solar cell based on a blend of 6 nm oleate-capped PbSe NCs and P3HT.97 An overall PCE of only 0.14% under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination was obtained from the device due to a couple of causes, such as the insulating long chain of oleate ligands on the surface of the NCs. The first PbSe NCs solar cell to exceed 1% AM1.5G PCE was reported in 2008 and employed a Schottky architecture with PbSe NCs cross-linked by BDT as the active layer.98 The reported photovoltaic performance of devices based on PbSe NCs is listed in Table 3.

3.3.1. Schottky-type PbSe nanocrystals solar cells. 
The first Schottky solar cells employed PbSe NCs cross-linked with 1,4-BDT was reported with a 1 sun AM1.5G PCE of 1.1% by Koleilat et al.98 The devices exhibited significant air stability with 80% of their PCE retained over 48 h storage in air. Luther et al. demonstrated a PbSe NCs Schottky solar cell with an exceptionally large JSC of 21.4 mA cm−2 and the resulted AM1.5G PCE of 2.1%.99 The device was fabricated via a layer-by-layer dip-coating method and subsequent 1,2-EDT treatment. The obtained EQE spectrum of the device showed efficiency peaks of 55–65% in the visible region and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of about 80% was estimated, indicating the low recombination loss and the efficient charge carrier extraction. The effect of PbSe NCs size on the performance of Schottky solar cells was investigated by Ma et al., where the diameter of PbSe NCs varied from 1 to 3 nm.101 It was presented in the report that larger nanocrystal bandgaps lead to higher VOC but VOC began to decrease for nanocrystals with diameters smaller than 2 nm, most likely due to reduced collection efficiency. The best device demonstrated an AM1.5G PCE of 4.57%, which was fabricated with PbSe NCs with a bandgap of 1.6 eV as the photoactive layer.
Kuo et al. developed a PbSe NCs thin film deposition approach by performing ligand-exchange on the as-synthesized OA-PbSe with BA first and soaking BA-PbSe NCs thin film in 1,2-EDT solution afterwards to obtain EDT-PbSe NCs film.102 Synchrotron X-ray radial scans demonstrated the reduced film thickness and the shortened inter-particle spacings in the packing direction of EDT-treated PbSe NCs film compared to BA-capped PbSe NCs film, which indicated the small vertical packing of the NCs, thereby the improved charge transport in the as-fabricated EDT-PbSe NCs film could be anticipated. Schottky solar cells fabricated via this combination of BA ligand-exchange and EDT post-treatment exhibited an AM1.5G PCE of 2.45% and an impressive JSC of 26.4 mA cm−2.


3.3.2. Heterojunction PbSe nanocrystals solar cells. 
Leschkies et al. reported planar heterojunction solar cells based on PbSe NCs and thin ZnO films with a PCE of 1.6% under 1 sun AM1.5G radiation.103 The device was fabricated with the architecture of ITO/ZnO/PbSe/α-NPD/Au, with ZnO film made by rf magnetron sputtering and PbSe NCs cross-linked by 1,2-EDT. α-NPD was applied as the electron-blocking layer for the devices. It was discussed that the performance of the solar cells based on PbSe NCs and ZnO films could be further improved by using electron blocking materials other than α-NPD or using vertically oriented ZnO nanostructures instead of ZnO planar thin films.
Feng et al. developed a bilayer photovoltaic device based on a blend layer of poly[(2-methoxy,5-octoxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MOPPV-MWNT) and PC61BM and a thin film of PbSe NCs.105 MOPPV-MWNT was synthesized by covalent attachment.106 Surface morphology revealed the interpenetrating network of well-dispersed MWNT in MOPPV. It has been shown that the incorporation of MWNT in the polymer matrix provided high exciton dissociation and efficient charge transfer due to the high field at the polymer/MWNT interfaces.107 A two-fold increase in JSC was achieved for the device based on MOPPV-MWNT:PC61BM/PbSe, compared to the device without MWNT. A PCE under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination as high as 0.4% was obtained for the resulted device.
The discussion of the nature of photovoltaic device operation, excitonic solar cell vs. p–n heterojunction cell, remains an active topic within the field. Solar cells based on PbSe NCs that operate via the excitonic photovoltaic mechanism were fabricated consisting of PEDOT:PSS/EDT-PbSe/ZnO as the active layer, reported by Choi et al. in 2009.42 Monodisperse ZnO nanoparticles prepared by hydrolysis were employed as electron collecting layer in the devices.104 The champion performing device with 2 nm PbSe NCs applied exhibited a PCE of 3.4% under 1 sun AM1.5G illumination, with VOC = 0.44 V, JSC = 24 mA cm−2, FF = 0.32. The photovoltaic operation mechanism of PEDOT:PSS/EDT-PbSe/ZnO structure was discussed in the report. A direct correlation of NCs size tunable heterojunction energy level offsets at the PbSe/ZnO and PEDOT:PSS/PbSe interfaces with the photovoltaic device VOC was demonstrated. An excitonic solar cell behavior of the PbSe NCs devices where kinetics of charge transfer mainly determine the device VOC was illustrated.

4. Lead telluride
4.1. Synthesis of colloidal PbTe nanocrystals
Bulk PbTe has a narrow bandgap of 0.31 eV at room temperature. The bandgap value together with the large Bohr radius (150 nm) and large dielectric constant of PbTe made PbTe NCs superior infrared emitting materials for optoelectronic applications. Syntheses of colloidal PbTe NCs by using PbAc2·3H2O and trioctylphosphine telluride (TOPTe) as the precursors in ODE, phenylether, squalane or TOP with the presence of OA have been demonstrated.22,23,108 Spherical or cubic PbTe NCs with a diameter range of 4.2 to 14 nm were prepared. Generally, cubic PbTe NCs could be prepared by extending the growth time, using high reaction temperature, or low feed molar ratio of Pb/Te. Mokari et al. examined some phosphine acid or amines, such as tetradecylphosphine acid (TDPA), octadecylphosphine acid (ODPA), hexylphosphine acid (HPA), hexadecylamine (HDA), or dodecylamine (DDA), as stabilizing surfactants for the reaction of PbAc2 and TOPTe.23 Size and shape control of the PbTe NCs could be obtained by the proper choice of the surfactant and the reaction time.
By using PbO as the lead precursor, preparation of colloidal PbTe NCs was demonstrated and the diameters of the resulted NCs spanned the range from 2.9 to 8.3 nm.10 The spectra of PbTe NCs with the first excitonic transition peaks ranging from 1009 to 2054 nm were presented in the report as well as the narrow band-edge emissions with small Stokes shift (Fig. 14). The size distribution of the as-synthesized PbTe NCs was typically 7% for NCs with the first excitonic absorption peaks ranging from 1300 to 1600 nm. By using erucic acid (EA, a 22 carbon monounsaturated carboxylic acid) as the stabilizing ligand for the reaction of PbO and TOPTe, colloidal NCs with the first excitonic transition peak of 940 nm were prepared though the size distribution was high.

Ziqubu et al. reported a synthetic approach for colloidal PbTe nanorods by the formation of solid PbTe (prepared by the addition of an aqueous solution or suspension of lead carbonate to a freshly prepared NaHTe solution) first, followed by the injection of PbTe dispersed in TOP into hot HDA and the reaction mixture was held at the injection temperature (190 to 270 °C) for a couple of hours.109 The reaction was stopped by cooling down the reaction mixture to 50 °C and the PbTe NCs were collected by the addition of methanol to the reaction flask. Spherical PbTe NCs with diameters of 10.8 ± 1 nm were obtained when the injection temperature was 190 °C and the growth time was 2 h, while the 4 h growth time gave PbTe nanorods with lengths of 15 ± 2 nm and widths of 5 ± 1 nm. At higher temperatures, NCs with bigger diameters and nanorods with longer lengths and larger widths were obtained (Fig. 15). Similar results were also obtained in the synthesis of PbSe nanorods. An interesting phenomenon was observed when lead chloride or lead nitrate was used for the preparation of PbTe solid: only spherical NCs obtained from the afterwards heating process of PbTe in TOP and HDA.

4.2. Optical properties of colloidal PbTe nanocrystals
Up until now, colloidal PbTe NCs with the first excitonic absorption peaks spanning from 1000 to 2300 nm have been reported. The QYs for the as-synthesized PbTe NCs with PL peaks ranging from 1150 to 1450 nm were measured to be between 41 and 52 ± 2%, relative to dye IR 26.10 Comparative investigation of optical properties of PbX NCs was also reported in ref. 10. PbX NCs with the first excitonic transition peaks about 1450 nm and size distribution below 10% were introduced into the study. The size of the NCs with the same first excitonic absorption peak follow the same pattern as the change in the bandgaps (PbS > PbTe > PbSe) (Fig. 16). It is shown in Fig. 16 that PbS and PbSe possessed more defined 1S peaks and narrower FWHM than PbTe. It was discussed in the report that the PbTe NCs may have a slightly larger size distribution than those of PbS and PbSe NCs but it cannot account for the broader first excitonic absorption peak of PbTe NCs. The broadening of the first excitonic transition peak of PbTe NCs may partially be ascribed to the increase in the anisotropy.

MEG efficiency was also observed for colloidal PbTe NCs with a bandgap of 0.9 eV.10 It was demonstrated in the report that PbTe showed similar MEG QYs versus Ehv/Eg to those of PbSe with similar bandgap. A QY of 250% at an excitation wavelength energy of about 3 times that of the bandgap was observed for PbTe NCs.
5. Conclusions and outlook
Monodisperse lead chalcogenide NCs have emerged as promising and crucial nanostructured materials in photovoltaic devices due to their unique photosensitivity in the infrared region. Colloidal synthetic approach has provided lead chalcogenide NCs with well controlled size and good size distribution. The as-synthesized infrared colloidal PbS, PbSe, and PbTe NCs possesses well confined first excitonic transition peaks, high QYs in emission, excellent absorption spectral tunability from visible to near infrared, and great storage stability. The exploitation of the infrared colloidal lead chalcogenide (PbS and PbSe so far) NCs in solution processed solar cells has demonstrated impressive photovoltaic performance, including high PCEs, as high as 6% has been obtained, and long-term air-stability, device with a PCE of 3% experienced minor changes in key parameters over 1000 h under constant illumination in ambient air conditions with no encapsulation applied to the device. Improvement achieved over the last 3 years regarding high efficiency solar cells based on colloidal PbS and PbSe NCs together with the potential implement of MEG in NCs photovoltaic devices offer plenty of incentives to further explore the applications of PbX NCs in low-cost and high efficiency solution processable photovoltaic devices.
From a synthesis perspective, colloidal approaches for the production of high-quality lead chalcogenide nanocrystals have been developed in abundance; however, the majority of the as-synthesized colloidal NCs are zero-dimensional (nanoparticles). The future research direction in this field points to the colloidal methods for the preparation of PbX NCs with tightly controlled size, morphology, and shape. Producing PbX NCs in the shape of nanorods or nanowires will be of significant importance for photovoltaic applications. Compared to the shape-controlled synthesis of colloidal cadmium chalcogenide NCs, colloidal synthetic routes for lead chalcogenide nanorods are underdeveloped.20,45,110–112 Much progress remains to be achieved for shape-controlled synthesis of colloidal PbX NCs. On the other hand, innovations in materials chemistry that result in reducing the density of surface trap-state of colloidal PbX nanoparticles will boost the electro-optic applications of these materials.
It has been reported that the introduction of a heterojunction for PbS or PbSe NCs solar cells led to a twofold increase in photovoltaic efficiencies compared to the PbS- or PbSe-only Schottky solar cells. It is believed the incorporation of the p-type PbX NCs with n-type materials (inorganic and organic) to build p–n heterojunction solar cells will provide further advances. The construction of bulk heterojunction and tandem structures based on PbS NCs have also been demonstrated with intriguing achievements obtained for PbS NCs photovoltaic devices. The bulk p–i–n heterojunction concept can be broadened and deepened by employing high mobility PbX nanorods or nanowires infiltrated within the devices. Deeper understanding of the relationship between structure and performance with bulk heterojunction composite layers will enable a more efficient optimization for bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices based on PbX NCs. Further advancement in PbX NCs solar cells still requires creative innovations and dedicated effort from scientists and researchers working in this field. In device engineering, there exist a considerable number of possible strategies of designing nanostructure to improve the energy conversion efficiencies of photovoltaic devices based on PbX NCs, such as improvements of organizing well-ordered assemblies of NCs for device fabrication and development of architectures that will increase the desirable optical scattering in the NCs films and therefore the absorption of the films. Additional factors have to be considered, such as device long term stability and large scale production of photovoltaic devices.
