, Accepted 12th December 2014First published on 15th December 2014AbstractWe demonstrate a simple method for achieving high-performance subphthalocyanine (SubPc)/C70 bi-layer organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices through the changing of the C70 thickness. The optical and electrical properties of the OPV devices were decoupled and could be individually manipulated to obtain a significantly increased short-circuit current density (JSC) without reducing the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor. The thickness-independent electrical property of the C70 layer was systematically studied in terms of the dark currents of the OPV devices and the carrier mobilities of the organic layers; the results indicate that the considerable difference in mobility between SubPc and C70 is not detrimental, while the optical-field distribution can be optimized by tuning the C70 thickness. The power conversion efficiency was improved from 2.7 to 4.2% by optimizing the C70 thickness. The optical effect upon the change in the C70 thickness was thoroughly investigated by calculating the optical-field profile and the power dissipation inside the OPV devices on the basis of the transfer matrix method. The calculated results suggest that the optical-field intensity is insufficient in predicting the trend in JSC. Instead, the power dissipation involving the absorption properties of materials and the optical-field distribution of OPV devices can provide deeper insight into the optical condition and indicates the importance of optimizing the film thickness in bi-layer OPV devices.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have exhibited potential for commercialization as the device efficiency significantly improves and the compatibility of flexible, large-area substrates by a low-cost and high-volume processing develops.1–4 In the state of the art, several groups have reported a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 7% for polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the use of structural design and/or novel materials,5–7 permitting the achievement of the theoretical maximum of over 10%.8,9 Fabrication processes scaling up from single tandem cells to modules of fully roll-to-roll printing indium-free flexible devices and the enhancement via encapsulation of the operating lifetime under worldwide outdoor testing indicate that the PSCs can now be used in realistic applications.10–13
By contrast, the PCE of small-molecule OPV devices is lagging behind the PCE of the PSCs due to the inferior carrier transport (which depends on the molecular packing) and the limited absorption band over the spectral coverage, as reflected by a relatively low short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).14,15 Since the first efficient OPV device was proposed,16 many efforts have been devoted to improve the device performance.17–19 A huge progress was made in recent years. Several groups have demonstrated the small-molecule OPV devices with PCE of over 7% and even 10%,20–26 thus indicating the potential use in solar harvesting. In addition, the nature of the large energy gap in small molecules can increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC) because it is mainly determined by the energetic difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor.27 To maintain VOC while enhancing JSC simultaneously, the co-evaporation of donor and acceptor materials forming the so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ) was demonstrated to significantly increase the interfacial area between donor/acceptor where the exciton dissociation occurs, allowing for the generation of more photo-generated carriers for a higher photocurrent.28–30 The further improvements of device performance and developments of the device structure design are expected to promote commercialization of small-molecule OPV devices because of the high reproducibility, ease of synthesis and purification, and high compatibility of fabrication process.31–36
Although the BHJ can improve the JSC by increasing the dissociation interface as generally demonstrated in PSCs, an imperfect interpenetrating network between the donor and the acceptor may increase the carrier recombination as a result of the disordered transport path.37–39 The enhanced carrier recombination often comes at the expense of decreasing FF, which, in addition to VOC and JSC, determines the PCE, especially in the tandem devices in which the FF is commonly close to the value of the limiting cell.5,40–42 To overcome this limitation of decreasing FF, the active layer thickness of small-molecule OPV devices is typically less than 60 nm.25,26,43,44 In such thin films, the optical effects caused by the optical interference become important because it is preferable to place a high amount of absorbed energy into the region having a high possibility of exciton dissociation.45,46 Therefore, the thickness optimization should account for both the electrical and optical properties to avoid the trade-off between JSC and FF, thus complicating the device optimization procedure.18,47–50
Alternatively, an optical spacer is a type of material featuring high transparency and conductivity, which can manipulate the optical condition for OPV devices without affecting the electrical properties. Optical spacers, including metal oxides and doped organic layers, are used to enhance light absorption and/or control the absorbing zone of tandem cells.51–55 However, it is argued that the use of an optical spacer is not required if the active layer thickness of a device is well optimized.56 Therefore, a deeper understanding and simple analysis of optimizing the active layer thickness is essential before introducing the optical spacer to enhance photocurrent. Here, we demonstrate a simple means to optimize the active layer thickness of a small-molecule bi-layer device by decoupling the optical and electrical properties with the change in the acceptor thickness. Our results indicate that the thickness-independent electrical property of an acceptor with high carrier mobility allows for a significant tuning of optical-field distribution without a reduction in the electrical properties, thereby increasing the JSC while maintaining the high VOC and FF, leading to an increased PCE from 2.7 to 4.2% without additional techniques or structural designs. The calculation of power dissipation at the donor/acceptor interface agrees well with the experimentally observed trend in JSC, demonstrating that the prediction of an optimized active layer thickness is valuable and feasible in bi-layer OPV devices.
Results and discussion
Fig. 1(a) shows the energy level diagram of the OPV devices and the molecular structures of the organic materials. The HOMO and LUMO levels estimated here are in good agreement with the data reported by other groups.57–62 Because the subphthalocyanine (SubPc) has a relatively low-lying HOMO level, the transition metal oxide MoO3 is generally used to cover the bare indium-tin-oxide (ITO) thin film for efficient hole extraction without deteriorating the absorption of active layer by virtue of its high transparency.59,63 However, extensive studies have demonstrated the potential of high VOC OPV devices by using SubPc as the donor material.58,64,65 The use of C70 to be the acceptor material affords the better figure of merit than the commonly used C60 because C70 possesses a higher absorption coefficient and comparable electronic configuration to C60.28,60,66 A thin layer of bathocuproine (BCP) with an appropriate thickness inserted between the acceptor and cathode can reduce the exciton quenching and improve the electron extraction.67,68 Fig. 1(b) shows the optical constants of the organic materials used in this study. As observed in the bottom half of the figure, the SubPc exhibits two distinct features, with a peak at 585 nm and a shoulder at approximately 535 nm, while C70 has a lower but broader absorption in the wavelength range of 400 to 600 nm. The extraordinarily high extinction coefficient of SubPc in combination with the complementary absorption of C70 enables a large increase in the photocurrent of OPV devices. However, the nature of the thin film property in OPV devices requires accounting for the optical interference, which can have a significant impact on the photon absorption and hence the JSC.69,70 Therefore, deeper insight into the optical manipulation is of great importance to improve the performance of OPV devices.

Optical manipulation is generally controlled by using an optical spacer with high transparency and high electrical conductance.51,52,71,72 Alternatively, the thickness of the active layer can significantly impact the absorption property in OPV devices. The electrical properties, however, are simultaneously altered by the active layer thickness; hence, the optimization of the performance usually involves a trade-off between JSC and FF.47,48,50 In a bi-layer OPV device with ITO as the anode and a thick metal as the cathode, i.e., the bottom-absorbing configuration, the first optical interference maximum is physically dominated by the reflective metal and peaks at a position close to the cathode.73,74 This characteristic offers the possibility of manipulating the optical-field distribution by changing the thickness of the acceptor with a thickness-independent electrical property.75 Fig. 2(a) shows the dark current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OPV devices with varied thicknesses of C70 in a structure of ITO/MoO3 (15 nm)/SubPc (10 nm)/C70 (x nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag (100 nm), where x is 10, 20, 30, and 40. The changeless forward current is observed, except for the device with the thinnest C70, which may have yet to form a homogeneous film and therefore increases the series resistance as a result of the direct contact of SubPc and BCP. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), the diode behaviors of all devices are almost identical, indicating the possibility to adjust the C70 thickness to control the optical-field distribution without affecting the electrical property. Detailed analyses of the diode behaviors are described in the ESI (Section S1†). To further investigate the unchanged electrical property, we fabricated hole- and electron-only devices to determine the hole and electron mobilities of SubPc and C70, respectively, based on the space-charge limited current (SCLC), as expressed by76,77 
(1)where ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant and the permittivity of the free space, respectively, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the thickness of the organic layer. The structures for hole- and electron-only devices consist of ITO/MoO3 (15 nm)/SubPc (150 nm)/Au and Al/C70 (150 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows the results obtained from SCLCs. The hole and electron mobilities of SubPc and C70 are on the order of ∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Note that the hole mobility obtained here is quite different form the result reported by Pandey et al., indicating the value on the order of 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1.78 This discrepancy is attributed to the differences in the material and sample preparation, such as the purity and/or deposition rate, as observed in the literature.79–83 The estimated electron mobility of C70 here is consistent with the previous reports, revealing an order of magnitude lower than C60.38,78,84 As a result, the device resistance may be mainly dominated by SubPc due to its relatively low carrier mobility, permitting a less significant influence of C70 thickness on electrical property.

The performances under AM 1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 for the OPV devices with various C70 thicknesses are shown in Fig. 3(a). Error bars representing the standard deviation at each data point are also given. Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic performances on an average of ten devices for each cell parameter. Because the VOC is mainly determined by the donor/acceptor interface, such as the energy level distribution,85,86 bimolecular recombination,87,88 and charge transfer dynamics,89,90 we obtain similar values for all devices. The JSC, which is of special interest here, exhibits a large difference between these devices: it increases with C70 thickness from 10 to 30 nm and then decreases at 40 nm. We ascribe this improvement to the optimum optical-field distribution inside the device when a proper thickness of C70 was used. The FF also exhibits a slight dependence on C70 thickness and peaks for the 30 nm device. As a result, the overall PCE is improved from 2.7 to 4.2% by the simultaneous enhancement of VOC, JSC, and FF. To better understand the increased JSC, the EQE spectra of the OPV devices were measured, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The extinction coefficients of the active layers were also compared to clarify the contribution to the EQE. Because the JSC is directly correlated with the photoresponse to the solar spectrum, the device with the 30 nm C70 has the highest EQE over the entire visible wavelength range. In addition, a considerable change in the spectral shape indicates that in our case, the JSC is mainly determined by the optical-field distribution instead of the charge collection efficiency.91,92 These results highlight the dominance of the thickness optimization in a bi-layer OPV device without the use of an additional optical spacer.

To confirm our inference of the improved JSC being attributed to the optical effect, we calculated the optical-field distribution for layer structures with different C70 thicknesses using the transfer matrix method.73 For simplicity, the light is assumed to propagate normal to the device. The optical constants for each layer, as obtained from Fig. 1(b), are used for the calculation. Fig. 4(a) and (b) compare the optical-field profiles in terms of the normalized intensity |E0|2 inside the devices at wavelengths of 585 nm and 500 nm, respectively; these wavelengths chosen here correspond to the highest absorption for SubPc and C70, respectively. The solid lines indicate the SubPc/C70 interface at which the excitons are efficiently dissociated into free carriers. In Fig. 4, the first optical interference maximum from the cathode occurs at a very different position in spite of a small change in C70 thickness for each incident wavelength and device structure, implying the importance of the thickness and optical optimization in bi-layer devices. For the wavelength of 585 nm, where the SubPc primarily absorbs, the maximum |E0|2 shifts from the ITO/MoO3 interface to the C70/BCP interface with increasing C70 thickness, indicating that the optimum optical-field distribution is achieved by the 30 nm C70, as shown in Fig. 4(a). At the wavelength of 500 nm, which corresponds to the highest absorption of C70, both the optical-field intensity and the position are quite different. The C70 with a thickness of 40 nm is found to provide the most desirable profile but the lowest |E0|2 at the SubPc/C70 interface, while the other devices exhibit comparable optical-field intensities at this interface. These results, however, are insufficient to explain the observed trend in JSC because the difference in |E0|2 at the SubPc/C70 interface is insignificant for each data set. The energy or power dissipation in the active layers, which is highly dependent on the extinction coefficient of the absorbing layer, should be taken into account, in particular, the obvious differences in the absorption property between SubPc and C70, as shown in Fig. 1(b).

The vertical solid lines indicate the interface between SubPc and C70. The vertical dashed lines indicate the C70/BCP interface. The vertical dotted lines differentiate the interfaces at ITO/MoO3 and MoO3/SubPc. 
The power dissipation, Q(z, λ), in the material at a distance z from the glass/ITO surface can be calculated by45,69,73 
(2)where c is the speed of light, α is the absorption coefficient, and n is the refractive index; under AM 1.5G solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, the power dissipation has a unit of W m−2 nm−1.69,93 Fig. 5 shows the absorption profiles represented by Q(z, λ) for layer structures with different C70 thicknesses at the wavelengths of 500 nm and 585 nm. Note that the abrupt changes in α and n between different materials cause the discontinuity at each interface. In contrast to the optical-field distribution, the power dissipation profile is considerably different, depending on both the wavelength and position. By incorporating the material absorption properties into the optical conditions inside the device, it becomes possible to obtain clear insight into the change in JSC for different structures. In the SubPc and C70 layers, the power dissipation is mainly dominated by the wavelengths of 585 and 500 nm, respectively, corresponding to the peak absorption of each material. As the thickness of C70 increases, the shape of the power dissipation in SubPc varies greatly, revealing maximum shifts from the MoO3/SubPc interface to the SubPc/C70 interface. To obtain a large number of free carriers that are dissociated from photo-induced excitons, the power dissipated at the donor/acceptor interface should be as high as possible, especially in a bi-layer having only a limited dissociation site.94–96 Alternatively, the maximum power dissipation must be located very close to the donor/acceptor interface at which only excitons can separate into free carriers. From these aspects, the C70 thickness of 30 nm is expected to give the highest photocurrent generated from the SubPc layer at the wavelength of 585 nm. In contrast, the total power dissipated in C70 increases with its thickness at the wavelength of 500 nm. Because previous reports have shown that the exciton diffusion length is shorter in C70 than in C60 as reflected by a lower FF,38,42,70 it is inferred that only the excitons generated close to the SubPc/C70 interface can contribute to the photocurrent. Therefore, the JSC originates from C70 that are comparable except when the C70 thickness exceeds 40 nm, which exhibits a greatly reduced power dissipation.

Fig. 6(a) shows the relationship between the experimental JSC and the optical-field intensity at the SubPc/C70 interface for the OPV devices with various C70 thicknesses. The additional devices with C70 layer thickness of 50 nm and 60 nm were also fabricated and compared. The JSC becomes smaller when the C70 thickness increases as a result of the inferior optical-field distribution and the deteriorated electrical property. At the wavelength of 585 nm, corresponding to the absorption peak of SubPc, the predicted optical-field intensity is consistent with the experimental JSC. For the absorption peak of C70, at the wavelength of 500 nm, the prediction disagrees with the experimental result when the thickness of C70 is less than 30 nm. This result suggests that the theoretical JSC may be overestimated if the absorption property of the material is not taken into account. To address this issue, the power dissipation at the SubPc/C70 interface is compared to the experimental JSC at various C70 thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 6(b). For the incident wavelength at 585 nm, the experimental data agree well with the calculation. When the incident wavelength is 500 nm, the power dissipation is reduced more than at the wavelength of 585 nm, implying the reduced contribution of C70 to the photocurrent compared with SubPc. As a result, the trend in JSC is primarily dominated by the SubPc and has a minor relation to the C70. Nevertheless, tuning the thickness of C70 favors the optical manipulation inside the OPV devices, providing a simple way to optimize the JSC of bi-layer devices without losing the electrical property and hence the FF. In our case, we successfully improved the JSC while maintaining a high VOC and FF, leading to an enhanced PCE from 2.7 to 4.2%, with a VOC of 1.05 V, JSC of 6.5 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.61. This result is highly efficient among the state-of-the-art bi-layer OPV devices based on small molecules without further treatments or structural designs.

Black and red lines represent the calculated values at the wavelengths of 500 nm and 585 nm, respectively. The text in parentheses indicates the principally absorbing material at such wavelengths. 
The above results indicated that the optical-field distribution of OPV devices was optimized by changing the thickness of C70 without the compensation of electrical properties. From Fig. 2(b), it is expected that the electrical properties could be further optimized by changing the SubPc thickness, as the carrier mobility of SubPc is significantly lower than C70. Fig. 7(a) shows the J–V characteristics in the dark for the OPV devices with varied SubPc thicknesses: 5 nm, 10 nm, 15 nm, and 20 nm. The forward current is considerably decreased at a thicker SubPc, indicating the reduction in carrier transport and hence the reduction in electrical properties. The RS was determined in the same manner as used to extract the diode behavior in Fig. 2(a), showing RS of 2.6 Ω cm2, 3.9 Ω cm2, 5.4 Ω cm2, and 11.4 Ω cm2 for the devices with 5 nm, 10 nm, 15 nm, and 20 nm SubPc, respectively. This result highlights the dominance of a low-mobility material in the electrical properties of OPV devices. The corresponding photo J–V characteristics are shown in the inset in Fig. 7(a). Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of these devices. Except for the 5 nm SubPc device, the JSC and FF are decreased with the thickness of SubPc, as a result of the increased RS caused by poor carrier transport. This opposite trend in JSC observed for the device with the 5 nm SubPc is ascribed to the exciton quench in the case without using an anodic exciton blocking layer.44,97,98 For the devices with SubPc thicknesses exceeding 15 nm, the diode behavior becomes deviated from the ideal case and an s-shape emerges, which is generally caused by the combination of an imbalance in the carrier mobility and an inappropriate active layer thickness.75,99 In addition, the thickness-dependent VOC is also observed, which is attributed to the potential change inside the device as a result of the hole and electron accumulation at the anode and cathode interface, thus leading to the increased built-in potential (Vbi) and hence the VOC.49,75,99 To gain insight into this aspect, we measured the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of these devices with different SubPc thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The C–V characteristic is generally described by the Mott–Schottky relation100 
(3)where A is the device active area, e is the elementary charge, and NA is the p-type doping concentration. The Vbi estimated from the low-voltage onset point is 0.79 V, 0.85 V, 0.91 V, and 0.97 V for the devices with 5 nm, 10 nm, 15 nm, and 20 nm SubPc, respectively. This result is consistent with the observed trend in the experimental VOC but is not necessarily a reflection of the realistic value because the VOC can depend on charge accumulation inside the device, which likely dominates the recombination losses in our case.75 Therefore, the VOC loss becomes increasingly serious the thicker the SubPc layer is, as observed from the experimental VOC. The p-type doping concentration derived from eqn (3) is 4.9 × 1016, 3.6 × 1016, 2.7 × 1016, and 2.2 × 1016 cm−3 for the device with 5 nm, 10 nm, 15 nm, and 20 nm SubPc, respectively, by assuming that ε is 3.9 for SubPc.101,102 Although it is not well understood how the p-type doping concentration affects the device performance, several reports have indicated improved device performance as the p-type doping concentration decreased.103,104 Nevertheless, as inferred from the Vbi result, a serious carrier recombination originating from the charge accumulation is in turn detrimental to the device performance. As a result, the charge accumulation comes at the expense of the JSC and FF, and therefore, an optimized SubPc thickness is found to be approximately 10 nm. Given the already optimized optical condition, the electrical property is further optimized by the donor thickness. Our result represents a comprehensive and systematic study on the thickness optimization process in bi-layer OPV devices with the decoupling of the optical and electrical properties.

Experimental
Device fabrication
All materials, namely MoO3, SubPc, C70, and BCP, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The organic materials SubPc and BCP were purified twice prior to use. The purification process was performed in a home-build thermal-gradient sublimation system, which consists of a heating zone with three regions at different temperatures in an outer quartz tube equipped with a vacuum system (pressure < 10−6 Torr) as provided in ESI (Section S2†). The material was placed in a quartz container and positioned in the first region at a temperature higher than the sublimation temperature of the material of interest. The second and third regions are at gradually decreased temperatures to allow vaporized material for deposition on the wall of the inner quartz tube. The heavy impurities and other substances remained in the quartz container, whereas the lighter impurities went far from the quartz container and deposited at the end of the inner quartz tube. The middle of the inner quartz tube containing the purified material is then cut away with a diamond tip tube cutter to avoid mixing materials from different regions during the removal of the purified material. A standard photolithography process was used to pattern the ITO slides as provided in ESI (Section S3†). Before the device fabrication, the ITO substrates were soaked in consecutive solutions, detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, and under ultrasonic bath for 10 min in each step. The OPV devices were fabricated onto pre-patterned ITO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of approximately 10 Ω sq−1. The pattern allowed us to produce five devices on one substrate. After the cleaning process, the substrates were transferred into a high vacuum chamber (<8 × 10−6 Torr) without further treatments. Before the deposition of the cathode, all the thin films were deposited layer-by-layer instead of mixing into a blend or mixture. A chamber with a home-made independently controlled shutter system to fabricate at most four cell parameters without breaking the vacuum, resulting in the minimization of the deviations due to device-to-device and run-to-run differences. The deposition of the Ag cathode through a shadow mask defines the active area of 0.04 cm2. The thickness of each layer was calibrated with a series of thickness measurements using a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 3) and an ellipsometry (Raditech SE-950). The deposition rates of all layers were monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance and were well-controlled to within 0.1–0.2 nm s−1 during the deposition process. After the device fabrication, an encapsulation process involving a UV-curable epoxy resin and a getter-attached cover glass was used to avoid degradation from exposure to the ambient environment. A total number of ten devices on two different substrates for each cell parameter were produced. Detailed information on the device pattern and encapsulation is provided in the ESI (Section S4†).
Device characterization
All of the measurements were performed in air. The photo J-V characteristics were determined using a sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) to record the current under voltage bias and a solar simulator (Newport 91160A) for the AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated using a silicon reference cell (PV measurement; area = 3.981 cm2). The EQE spectra were determined using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR830) chopped at 250 Hz to measure the photocurrent of devices under the monochromatic light illumination from a monochromator (Newport 74100). Note that the EQE spectra were verified by integrating the product of the EQE data and the AM 1.5G solar spectrum to extract the theoretical JSC, which exhibits an error of less than 3% compared with the experimental JSC. The HOMO levels and the work functions of the thin films were estimated using a photoelectron spectrometer (Riken Keiki AC-2). The energy gaps of the materials were evaluated from the high-energy onset point in the absorption spectra collected using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Evolution 220). The optical constants for each layer were measured using an ellipsometry, as was used in determining the film thickness. C–V characteristics were determined using a precision LCR meter (Agilent E4980A) with a 100 mV ac signal and a frequency of 1 kHz.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that the considerable imbalance of carrier mobility between SubPc and C70 was not detrimental to the device performance, whereas enables one to manipulate and optimize the optical conditions by changing the C70 thickness without influencing the electrical properties. The simultaneously increased JSC, VOC, and FF improved the device efficiency from 2.7 to 4.2% at an optimal C70 thickness in small-molecule bi-layer OPV devices. The optical-tuning effects upon the change in C70 thickness were systematically studied by means of the optical-field intensity and power dissipation profiles inside the OPV device. It was found that the optical-field intensity at the dissociation interface is insufficient in predicting the trend in JSC. The absorption properties of active layers should be involved in the calculation to take into account the power dissipation. As a result, the power dissipated at the SubPc/C70 interface was in good agreement with the experimental JSC, proving the importance of optimization of the acceptor layer thickness. Upon the thickness change in a low-mobility donor, the electrical properties of OPV devices were significantly affected, either by the poor charge transport or the carrier recombination, as observed from the C–V characteristics. Our result provided a simple method of achieving high-performance bi-layer OPV devices and for predicting the correlation between the optical effects and the photocurrent.
