    , Accepted 7th July 2021First published on 8th July 2021Abstractvan der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by artificially stacking different two-dimensional (2D) materials are a promising platform to achieve diverse physical phenomena and device functions. In general, the gate voltage is utilized to modulate the carrier concentration and transport, thus realizing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices such as logic circuit and ternary inverters. Here, we present a novel out-of-plane heterostructure stacked by the layered p-type MoTe2 and n-type InSe. An anti-ambipolar transfer character was found in the heterojunction with a large work window (>60 V) and a high peak-to-valley current ratio (>103). The underlying transport mechanism of the anti-ambipolar behavior was investigated through the energy band structure, and we then proposed a basic design principle for constructing anti-ambipolar devices based on a 2D vdW heterostructure with type-II band alignment. In addition, under 405 nm laser irradiation, the heterojunction exhibits a high self-driven photodetection performance with a photoresponsivity of 15.4 mA W−1 and a specific detectivity up to ∼3.02 × 1014 jones in the absence of external bias. This work not only demonstrates high-performance multifunctional optoelectronics based on InSe/MoTe2 heterostructures, but also provides a new understanding of the anti-ambipolar band alignment and its applications in multivalued logic circuits and flexible devices.
Introduction
Two-dimensional layer materials (2DLMs) with weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions represented by graphene1 (Gr), black phosphorus2,3 (BP) and transition metal dichalcogenides4–6 (TMDs) have attracted tremendous research interests owing to their unique (opto) electrical properties and excellent compatibility with silicon technologies. Benefiting from the absence of the surface dangling bonds and no need for lattice matching (lattice mismatch), vdW heterostructures can be constructed by assembling different 2DLMs via the dry transfer technique.7,8 They exhibit superior optoelectrical properties and unique physical characteristics. So far, a variety of different device applications have been demonstrated such as photodetectors (PDs),9 transistors,10 solar cells11 and light-emitting diodes.12 For example, the gate-regulated Esaki diodes composed of SnSe2/MoTe2 with type-III band alignment were fabricated for application in complex logic circuits.13 A WS2/ReS2 heterojunction was prepared for polarized light detection without external bias.14 Recently, as one of the novel features, the anti-ambipolar behavior, showing a “Λ” shape opposite to the V-shape of ambipolar in transfer curves, has received widespread attention. The anti-ambipolar devices can implement numerous logic functions, such as double-frequency, binary phase shift keying circuit and three-channel unit for information storage, suggesting great potential in multivalued logic circuits.
The anti-ambipolar transport phenomenon was first observed in a gate-tunable carbon nanotube and MoS2 p–n heterojunctions15 in 2013, and in recent emerging vdWs p–n heterojunctions made of WSe2–MoS2,16 BP–MoS217,18 and MoTe2–MoS2.19 However, it is still a challenge to fabricate anti-ambipolar heterojunction devices with reliable and consistent performance, as it requires a highly accurate control on the on-set voltage (Von) and the carrier density of both n-type and p-type components in the junction. So, the predicted anti-ambipolar behavior can remain in a large gate voltage (Vg) window.20 Due to the quantum confinement effect and the strong interlayer coupling, the bandgap and carrier concentration of 2DLMs are greatly dependent on the thickness. By controlling the thickness of the p-type and n-type materials, the Von of the different components can be controlled separately. In particular, type-II band alignment in the heterojunction can facilitate the separation of photo-excited carriers, leading to a high performance self-driven photodetection. The self-driven photodetectors based on 2D materials have attracted increasing attention because of their facile process and flexible assembly, showing great application value in weak signal detection owing to their high specific surface area, strong light–matter interaction, low dark current and high responsivity within a small photosensitive area at the ultrathin scale.
In this work, we constructed a MoTe2/InSe vdWs p–n heterojunction with type-II band alignment and excellent light response. The heterojunction stacked by the PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) dry transfer method showed an anti-ambipolar with a “Λ” shaped transfer curve under gate voltage modulation. In general, a large modulation voltage window and a large peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) are necessary for the preparation of logic circuits with an anti-ambipolar device. At a bottom gate voltage (Vbg) of −20 V, the maximum source–drain current reached 34 nA with a PVCR exceeding 103. The voltage window of the Vbg modulation was larger than 60 V. In addition, the p–n heterojunctions could also act as self-powered photodetectors with a detectivity of 3.02 × 1014 jones and a responsivity of 15.6 mA W−1 owing to the good rectifying characteristics and photovoltaic effect.
Results and discussion
Morphology and optical characterization of InSe/MoTe2

Fig. 1(a) shows the crystallographic structure of monolayer InSe and MoTe2. The β-InSe with lattice parameters of a = 4.005 Å and c = 16.640 Å shows a space group of P63/mmc, and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern confirms that InSe was β phase in Fig. S1 (ESI†).21 The Crystal System of semiconducting 2H-phase MoTe2 is a hexagonal structure with the space group of Pm2.22 As shown in Fig. 1(b), the blue and red lines refer to the MoTe2 and InSe nanosheets, respectively. The overlapped area was calculated to be approximately 120 μm2. An Atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to measure the thickness of the multi-layered MoTe2 and InSe flakes. The AFM image with the scanning area, shown in Fig. 1b (white dotted frame), indicates that the thickness of the MoTe2 and InSe flakes in this device were around 7 nm and 91 nm, respectively. The insets show the height profiles of individual MoTe2 and InSe. Fig. 1(d) shows the Raman spectra of InSe, MoTe2 and the overlapping layers with a 532 nm excitation laser. For the multilayer InSe, there were three strong vibration Raman peaks at 110 cm−1, 172 cm−1 and 222 cm−1, corresponding to the A11g (out-of-plane), E12g (in-plane atomic movement) and A12g vibration (the opposite direction to A21g) modes, respectively.23 These peaks at 170 cm−1 (A1g), 232 cm−1 (E12g) and 287 cm−1 (B12g) are characteristic of crystalline MoTe2.24 The Raman spectra of the overlapped region show all peaks of both components, implying the formation of the vertical MoTe2/InSe heterojunction. No obvious PL signal was observed for bare MoTe2 due to the intrinsic indirect bandgap (1.0 eV), as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Whereas, the multilayered InSe showed a strong excitonic emission at around 985 nm (corresponding to 1.25 eV) due to the direct bandgap. Moreover, Fig. 1e shows the PL mapping of InSe and the overlapped heterostructure, and a PL quenching effect can be clearly observed, indicating the efficient inter-layer separation of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs due to the designed type-II band alignment, which can result in the decrease of the radiative recombination of InSe.25 In order to further study the energy band arrangement and the built-in field at the heterojunction interface, the surface potential distribution (SPD) along the heterojunction area was measured with a Kelvin Probe Force Microscope (KPFM). In general, the SPD between the 2D materials and the AFM tip can be defined as26 ΦeSPDInSe = Φtip − ΦInSe(1) ΦeSPDMoTe2 = Φtip − ΦMoTe2(2)where e is elementary charge, Φtip, ΦMoTe2 and ΦInSe are the electron affinities of the AFM tip, MoTe2 and InSe, respectively. Thus, the difference of Fermi level between MoTe2 and InSe (ΔEF) can be calculated by ΔEF = ΦeSPDInSe − ΦeSPDMoTe2(3)

(f) Surface potential difference (SPD) of the heterostructure along the blue line. 

Fig. 1f shows the 2D KPFM mapping of the SPD between the InSe/MoTe2 heterojunction and the Pt tip. The ΔEF was calculated to be 125 meV with a depletion width of 3 μm. The electron affinity of MoTe2 was beyond that of InSe. The above PL quenching effect and the large difference Fermi level between InSe and MoTe2 proved that the heterojunction probably belongs to type-II band structure with built-in electric field from n-InSe to p-MoTe2. Furthermore, the band structure of multi-layered MoTe2 and InSe and its specific energy band analysis alignment based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) will be discussed for the first time in the next part.
To further understand the inner mechanism of the carrier transport, the electronic band structure has been obtained using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In Fig. 2a, the bulk MoTe2 exhibits an indirect bandgap of 0.71 eV, and its valence band maximum (VBM) is located at the Γ point, while its conduction band minimum (CBM) lies along the Γ–K line. The bulk InSe exhibits a direct band structure with a bandgap of 0.75 eV with the CBM and VBM located at the Γ (gamma) point. When InSe and MoTe2 get connected (Fig. 2b), band bending occurs at the interface to form a type-II heterojunction. Upon light illumination, the electron–hole pairs can be excited by the absorbed photons, which are subsequently separated quickly and efficiently by the built-in electric field and collected by the respective electrodes through InSe and MoTe2, thus forming a significant photocurrent. The band edges of single-layer InSe and MoTe2 with respect to the vacuum level are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

Anti-ambipolar properties of the InSe/MoTe2 vdWs heterojunction
Next, we turn to the electrical transport properties of the device based on the InSe/MoTe2 vdW vertical heterojunctions; the PVA film-assisted transfer process is schematically shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Fig. 3a shows the schematic diagram of the device configuration; the electrode on InSe side is grounded, the drain bias (Vds) is connected to MoTe2 and the back-gate voltage (Vg) is applied to the heavily doped p-Si. The Ids–Vg characteristics were measured between electrodes 1 and 2 (pristine MoTe2), between electrodes 3 and 4 (pristine InSe) and between electrodes 2 and 3 (InSe/MoTe2 heterojunction), as shown in Fig. 3(b). The gate voltage can modulate the charge transport and concentration of the entire device. Individually, the multilayer InSe flake demonstrates an n-type behavior with an on–off ratio of ∼104. The multilayered MoTe2 exhibits a p-type conducting behavior with an on−off ratio of ∼102. Meanwhile, the transistors based on individual InSe and MoTe2 with different thicknesses were also prepared to study the open and off state of the transfer curve (see in Fig. S5, ESI†). With increasing thickness, the threshold voltage of InSe-FET gradually increased from heavy n-doping to weak n-doping. In addition, the field effect of MoTe2 was also improved with the decrease in the thickness. The thickness-dependent VT and on/off ratio is attributed to the electrostatic screening effect and scattering effect, which is similar to that in BP,27 MoS228 and Gr.29 Interestingly, the heterojunction composed of MoTe2 and InSe with suitable thickness exhibited a unique anti-ambipolar characteristic with a maximum current at Vds = 4 V and Vg = −20 V. Fig. 3(c and d) display the Ids–Vds output curves of the heterojunction under forward and reverse Vg, respectively, which show the rectification behavior, as expected for the p–n heterojunction. Obviously, the output current increased significantly starting from Vg = −40 V and reached its maximum current at Vg of −20 V. While at forward Vg, the output current decreased slowly from Vg = 10 V to 80 V. Based on the transport mechanism, the anti-ambipolar transfer curves can be well defined into three separate regions, as shown in Fig. 3e. Region I is in the range of −80 V < Vg < −60 V, where the InSe channel was depleted in “close” status with high resistivity, leading to the off-state of the overall heterojunction. In contrast, the MoTe2 channel was turned off by applying a large forward voltage Vg > 60 V (region iii). In case of the −60 V < Vg < 60 V at region ii, both InSe and MoTe2 channels were in the sub-threshold regime, and Ids gradually reached a maximum value of 35 nA at Vg = −20 V (region ii). The key parameters of the anti-ambipolar devices are Vpeak, peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) and driving voltage range ΔVg.30,31 Fortunately, our designed anti-ambipolar FET demonstrates a high PVCR exceeding 103, a large ΔVg > 60 V and Vpeak of 20 V. All tests were performed at room temperature and ambient environment. Vpeak is the operation voltage of FET, and Vg (−20 V with 300 nm SiO2 as gate dielectric) can reduce the power consumption of the transistor. Meanwhile, the driving voltage range ΔVg is defined by the difference between the on-set (Von) and off-set (Voff) voltages. A wide range of ΔVg is necessary for the preparation of logic circuits.20 Besides, with the increase of the Vds, in Fig. S6 (ESI†), we observed a decrease in Vpeak and an increase in Ipeak without significant changes of Von and Voff owing to the well modulation of InSe (n-channel) in forward bias.32 Benefiting from the built-in electric field and good light absorption in our device, we subsequently discuss the optoelectronic properties of the heterojunction at Vds = 0 V. Anti-ambipolar transistors have developed rapidly in recent years, and various types of anti-ambipolar transistors have been developed, as shown in Table 1.

Optoelectrical properties of the InSe/MoTe2 heterojunction

Fig. 4(a) shows the current–voltage (Ids–Vds) curve of the InSe/MoTe2 heterojunction under darkness, which displays typical rectifying characteristics. As control devices, the Ids–Vds characteristics of FET based on individual InSe and MoTe2 were measured under 405 nm laser irradiation with different powers, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Both devices showed no current rectification with symmetric Ids–Vds relationships, indicating that the well-defined diode behavior mainly resulted from the InSe/MoTe2 heterojunction. Fig. 4(b and c) plot the Ids–Vds characteristics of the InSe/MoTe2 heterojunction under light illumination with a power from 7.64 to 46.97 nW at 405 nm and 2.47 to 237.08 nW at 635 nm. An obvious photovoltaic effect with significant open-circuit voltages (Voc) and a short-circuit current (Isc) was observed. By extracting the Ids–Vds data, the device exhibits a stable Voc of 0.6 V for 405 nm and 0.4 V for 635 nm, demonstrating a stable driving electrical field coming from the heterojunction. The nonlinear relationship between the photocurrent and light power can be well fitted by the power law equation:38 Iph = APθ(4)where A is a constant for a certain wavelength, P is the incident light power and exponent θ determines photoelectric conversion efficiency. In Fig. 4d, by fitting the curves with the above equation, the exponent θ was calculated to be 0.93 and 0.65 under the light with the wavelength of 405 nm and 635 nm, respectively, implying the good capability of the heterojunction in converting the photons to photocurrent.39

Inset is the 3D schematic image of the InSe/MoTe2 self-powered photodetector under irradiation. (b and c) Ids–Vds curves dependent on light power density at negative bias under (b) 405 nm and (c) 635 nm illumination. (d) Photocurrent dependence on light power density extracted at a Vds of 0 V under 405 nm and 635 nm illumination. 
The time-dependent photocurrent response at various light intensities at Vds = 0 V was measured to assess the reversibility and temporal response of the InSe/MoTe2 heterojunction. The current of the device increased quickly upon light illumination, reaching a steady on-state current and then decreased rapidly when the light was switched off, indicating a rapid formation of photocurrent excited by the incident photons near the p–n heterojunctions. The photo-switching ratio defined as Iph/Idark could reach up to1.03 × 103 and 1.27 × 104 under the light with a wavelength of 405 nm and 635 nm, respectively, which is attributed to the high photocurrent and low dark current (10 fA). The large width of the depletion region and the strong built-in electric field as obtained from the KPFM measurement can contribute to the excellent photodetection performance with an extremely low dark current and a large photo-switching ratio. In addition, the device shows a reversible and stable photocurrent output without a notable decay after hundreds of cycles, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), indicating remarkable stability and repeatability of the device. Fig. 5(b–d) show the temporal response under light of 405 nm and 635 nm, respectively, at zero bias. The rise and decay times are defined as the time required for the Iph to transition from 10 to 90% or drop from 90 to 10%, which were measured to be 0.72 s/0.44 s for 405 nm and 0.46 s/0.32 s for 635 nm. In particular, the response speed became faster with a response time of 0.06 s/0.04 s by applying external reverse bias, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), which can be due to the fast separation and efficient transport of photo-generated carriers under the assistance of the external electric bias.

(e and f) Responsivity and D* for the InSe/MoTe2 device as a function of power at zero bias with the wavelength at 405 and 635 nm. 
To further evaluate the performance of the heterojunction photodetectors, the responsivity (Rλ) and detectivity (D*) were calculated as the key parameters. Rλ is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power of the incident light on the effective area of the photodetector. D* is a parameter evaluating the device's capability to detect a weak optical signal. Rλ and D* are defined by the following equations:40,41 Rλ = (Iph)/PλS(5) D* = Rλ/(2qJd)1/2(6)where Pλ is light power density and S is the effective illuminated area which is 120 μm2, λ is light wavelength, q is the elementary electronic charge and Jd is the dark current density. As shown in Fig. 5(e and f), Rλ and D* of the device increased with the decrease in the incident light power, and reached a maximum value of 15.6 mA W−1 and 3.02 × 1014 cm Hz1/2 W−1 (jones), respectively, at the light power of 7.65 nW (405 nm) and zero bias. For the light with the wavelength of 635 nm, the Rλ and D* of the device were 0.48 mA W−1 and 1.1 × 1013 jones without external voltage. The high D* was a result of the ultralow dark current on the order of 10 fA, owing to the formation of high quality vdW p–n heterojunctions.
Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully prepared a n-InSe/p-MoTe2 heterojunction device. The heterojunctions exhibited type-II band alignment determined by DFT calculations. The type-II band structure and formation of p–n junctions have led to a significant photovoltaic effect and PL quenching effect. Interestingly, we observed a strong anti-ambipolar behavior in the heterojunctions with a large PVCR over 103 and a broad working window (>60 V), enabling their potential application in logic circuits. The devices can also act as high performance self-powered photodetectors by operating in photovoltaic mode. Under 405 nm laser irradiation, a responsivity of 15.6 mA W−1 and specific detectivity up to 1014 jones were achieved benefiting from the ultralow dark current, thus, the low noise. This work demonstrates a vdW heterojunction with type-II band alignment, which exhibits novel anti-ambipolar behavior and a strong photovoltaic effect, offering a promising platform for logic electronics and photodetector applications.
Experimental
Preparation of the 2H-MoTe2/InSe vdWs heterostructure
Few-layer 2H-MoTe2 was deposited on 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates via mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals (99.995%, HQ Graphene) and transferred onto 300 nm SiO2/Si wafers. The Si substrates were cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, DI water in sequence and blow-dried with N2. OM and AFM were used to select the targeted MoTe2 and InSe flakes, and to confirm their thickness. Subsequently, multilayer InSe (99.995%, HQ Graphene) was exfoliated onto the SiO2 substrate, and transferred onto MoTe2 with a PVA/PDMS film with the help of a three-axis manipulator platform (see in S4, ESI†). The detailed transfer recipe can be seen in our previous study.40 The transfer processes were operated in a nitrogen-filled glove box, and the concentrations of water and oxygen were lower than 0.01 ppm.
Characterization of the vdWs heterostructure
Raman and PL spectra were measured by a Raman instrument (Nost Technology Co., Ltd, a laser excitation of 532 nm and spot diameter of 1–2 μm) at room temperature. The thickness of the sample and the barrier height at the interface can be tested using a Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) with the functional modules of AFM and KPFM (Dimension FastScan from Bruker Co., Ltd).
Electric and photoresponse measurement of the MoTe2/InSe 2D vdWs heterostructure
The devices were conducted via a four-probe station (PSAICPB6A, PRECISION SYSTEMS INDUSTRIAL Co., Ltd) equipped with a KEITHLEY B2636B semiconductor analyzer. The photoresponse of the device was tested by using 405 and 635 nm optical-fiber laser. All light sources were controlled with a spot diameter of 0.3 cm during the measurement. A continuously variable filter was used to control the light power density, and it was calibrated using a light power meter. The laser power was measured by an optical power/energy meter (1936-R, Newport) with a UV enhanced silicon photodetector (918D-UV-OD3R, Newport) at 405 and 635 nm light. All the measurements were performed under ambient conditions.
Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations
The band structures of bulk InSe and MoTe2 were studied by first-principles methods based on density functional theory (DFT), as depicted in Fig. 5. The exchange correlation potential was described using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The projected augmented wave (PAW) method, which was implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), was adopted to simulate the electron–ion potential. The cutoff energy was set to be 500 eV for the plane wave expansion. Meanwhile, the convergence criterion used to relax structures was 10−5 eV, and the geometry structures were relaxed until the force applied on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1.
