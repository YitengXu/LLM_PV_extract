    , Accepted 18th May 2021First published on 18th May 2021AbstractIn recent years, AgBiS2 has received great attention in optoelectronics thanks to its fascinating merits, including a suitable bandgap, large absorption coefficient from ultraviolet to near-infrared and remarkable material stability. However, the poor carrier transport properties limit its further development and applications. To address this issue, we propose a composite strategy to facilitate the carrier transport of AgBiS2 QD films. The AgBiS2–organic hybrid films demonstrated enhanced photoconductivity. Then, we fabricated phototransistors based on these blend films, and achieved a high photosensitivity (Ilight/Idark) of 1.5 × 103, a decent responsivity of up to 20 A W−1, an excellent specific detectivity of 4 × 1013 Jones under low UV illumination and remarkable device stability. These results again demonstrate the great potential of AgBiS2 for next generation solution-processed photodetectors.
Introduction
In the past few years, ternary silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS2) has attracted great attention because of its outstanding optoelectronic properties, including a high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR), an appropriate bandgap and excellent stability.1–12 In addition, AgBiS2 is composed of environmentally friendly and earth-abundant elements, and is favorable for next-generation optoelectronic devices, e.g., solar cells and photodetectors. Particularly, AgBiS2 quantum dots (QDs) have been successfully introduced in thin-film photovoltaics.1,2,5,13–16 In 2016, Bernechea and co-workers achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 6.3% with a relatively thin active film of ∼35 nm AgBiS2 QDs.1 However, when the authors increased the thickness of photoactive layers, the device performance deteriorated severely due to the poor carrier transport properties of AgBiS2 QDs, which has also been proved by other groups.2,17 Recently, Diedenhofen et al. investigated the charge carrier dynamic behavior of AgBiS2 QD films via photoinduced time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC), and found that the diffusion lengths of electrons and holes are only 60 nm and 150 nm respectively at room temperature.17 These results suggest that a thicker AgBiS2 QD film is not suitable for optoelectronic applications due to its limited charge carrier diffusion lengths. Hence, exploring other strategies to enhance its charge carrier transport properties is urgently required.
Blending AgBiS2 QDs with other transport materials and forming hybrid optoelectronic materials may offer an alternative approach to facilitate the charge transport.18–24 In 2018, Mak et al. fabricated graphene/AgBiS2 hybrid phototransistors, with graphene as the transport medium to improve the charge transport properties of AgBiS2 QDs.25 However, the dark current (∼1 mA) of these devices was extremely high due to the high conductivity of graphene. On the other hand, considering the relatively narrow bandgap and high conductivity of AgBiS2, the noise and dark current of pristine AgBiS2 based photodetectors are relatively high. To address these issues, embedding AgBiS2 QDs in a wide bandgap organic semiconductor matrix to form an organic–inorganic hybrid system may offer great potential. Through this strategy, organic semiconductors with high mobility can serve as an efficient charge transport channel and AgBiS2 QDs can effectively absorb incident photons.
In this work, we introduce 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) as a p-type organic charge transport layer, which has demonstrated high charge carrier mobility in organic field effect transistors (FETs).26–30 We first probe the dark and photoconductivity of the C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 hybrid films with various blend ratios. Then, we systematically investigate and optimize the device performance of the C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 based phototransistors, and evaluate their potential for sensitive light detection.
Experimental methods
Synthesis of AgBiS2 quantum dots
The synthesis of AgBiS2 quantum dots was similar to that of a previous report. Firstly, 386 mg Bi(OAc)3 (Alfa, 99%) and 133.6 mg Ag(OAc) (Adamas, 99%) were added into 5.3 mL oleic acid (OA, Heowns, 90%), and then reacted at 100 °C for at least 12 hours in an atmosphere without oxygen and moisture. Then, 1 mmol hexamethyldisilathiane (Heowns, AR) dissolved in 5 mL 1-octadecene (Macklin, 95%) was quickly injected into the mixed solution (the hot plate was turned off at the same time). AgBiS2 QDs were precipitated by adding acetone, and they were obtained by centrifugation. Then, AgBiS2 QDs were purified by successive dispersion in toluene (Sinopharm, AR) and precipitation with acetone (Sinopharm, AR). Finally, the purified AgBiS2 QDs were dispersed in toluene.
Deposition of C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 hybrid films
10 mg C8-BTBT (Rhawn, 99%) and 2 mg polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, Sinopharm) were dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene (Aladdin, 99%) with vigorous stirring until clear to form a C8-BTBT solution. 20 mg AgBiS2 QDs was dispersed in 1 mL toluene to form a AgBiS2 colloidal solution. Then, C8-BTBT and AgBiS2 QDs were mixed at volume ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 4:1 and 8:1 to form C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 mixed solutions. Then, the mixed solutions were spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s to form C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 hybrid films. Finally, a ligand exchange process was used to reduce the surface defects. Briefly, 1 mg mL−1 tetramethylammonium iodide (TMAI, Heowns, AR) dissolved in methanol was dropped on top of the blend films and kept for 20 s. Then, the substrates were spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The TMAI-treated films were washed with methanol (Sinopharm, AR). Finally, the blend films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min, resulting in a film thickness of ∼20 nm.
Deposition of AgBiS2 QD films
AgBiS2 QD colloidal solution was deposited on the substrates by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 20 s. Then, a ligand exchange process was carried out in the same way as that for C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 blend films. All the above processes were cycled three times. Finally, the as-prepared films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. All the above film deposition processes were carried out in air.
Device fabrication
All devices were deposited on cleaned glass substrates or indium doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates (Meijingyuan Glass). Glass or ITO substrates were firstly washed with detergent solution, and then cleaned with deionized water (DI) water, isopropanol (Sinopharm, AR) and ethanol (Sinopharm, AR) with ultrasonification, respectively. Then the substrates were dried by compressed N2, and treated with O3 plasma for 10 min to remove the residual organics. Photoconductor architecture: the blend films or AgBiS2 QD films were directly deposited on glass substrates, and 60 nm Ag electrodes were evaporated through mask to form photoconductors with a channel length of 100 μm. Photodiode architecture: 100 mg mL−1 Zn(OAc)2 (Aladdin, 99.9%) dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (Sinopharm, AR) was deposited on the ITO substrates by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by a thermal annealing process at 200 °C for 30 min to form ZnO electron transport layers (ETLs). Then, AgBiS2 QDs were deposited on the ZnO layers. 5 mg mL−1 PTB7 (Luminescence Technology) dissolved in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on AgBiS2 QD layers and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in a glovebox, forming the hole transport layers (HTLs). Finally, 5 nm MoO3 and 120 nm Ag were evaporated as an interfacial modification layer and electrode, respectively. The device area was 0.1 cm2. Phototransistor architecture: 100 nm Cu and 280 nm Ta2O5 were deposited on the glass substrates as gate electrodes and dielectric layers successively via magnetron sputtering. Then, 60 mg mL−1 PAN (Macklin) dissolved in DMF (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) was deposited on top of Ta2O5 by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 40 s as the second dielectric layer. The blend films were deposited on top of samples to form active layers. Finally, 5 nm MoO3 and 60 nm Ag were evaporated on the blend films as interfacial modification layers and source-drain electrodes, respectively. The channel width and length were kept at 2 mm and 100 μm, respectively.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used to test the J–V curves for photodiodes under the illumination of an AAA solar simulator (San-Ei, XES-50S2). The optical properties of films were recorded with an UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lamda1050). The electrical performances for photoconductors and phototransistors were collected using a Keithley semiconductor analyzer (B1500A).
Results and discussion
Prior to the device fabrication, we focus on the preparation and characterization of AgBiS2–organic hybrid films. Fig. 1a schematically illustrates the deposition of the blend films and the ligand exchange process. Fig. 1b displays the XRD pattern of the obtained AgBiS2 QD films. Characteristic peaks of AgBiS2 crystals can be observed clearly, which is consistent with the reference (PDF#21-1178) and previous reports, indicating excellent crystallinity. The absorption spectra of AgBiS2, C8-BTBT and their hybrid films deposited on glass substrates are shown in Fig. 1c. Interestingly, AgBiS2 QD films possess a wide absorption range and high absorbance, covering the whole range from UV to NIR. C8-BTBT films present the absorption edge at ∼370 nm and the main absorption peak located at ∼360 nm, which is in line with the wide bandgap nature of this organic semiconductor. For the blend films, the absorption spectrum exhibited both features, suggesting excellent compatibility. Furthermore, we also tested the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine C8-BTBT and hybrid films as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We observed a remarkable reduction of the PL intensity, compared with pristine C8-BTBT films, indicating efficient PL quenching, i.e., improved charge extraction, which could effectively result in an improved photocurrent, in terms of device performance. To investigate the distribution of the AgBiS2 QDs in the hybrid films, we performed surface morphology analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We can clearly observe bright grains from the SEM image as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), which is correlated with the higher reflected electrons due to the larger atomic number of AgBiS2. In addition, we also recorded the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) profiles of these SEM samples, and found a relatively uniform distribution of Ag, Bi and S in the hybrid films as shown in Fig. S2b–e (ESI†).

Having successfully obtained AgBiS2 QD and hybrid films, we then turn to the electrical characterization of these thin films as shown in Fig. 2. We first evaluated the conductance (G) of the pure AgBiS2 QD thin films in the dark and under illumination in a wide temperature range from −40 °C to 100 °C, as shown in Fig. 2a. It can be observed that the pristine AgBiS2 QDs possess relatively high dark conductivity when the channel length was 100 μm, and it increased almost two orders of magnitude with the increase of temperature from −40 °C to 100 °C. This can be attributed to the relatively high trap density and increased carrier concentration by thermal excitation. However, the AgBiS2 QDs do not have noticeable photoconductivity under a white LED with an intensity of 15 mW cm−2, which is not common for intrinsic semiconductors. The low or negligible photocurrent could be caused by either low photo-generation or poor charge transport caused by the high trap density. Then, we fabricated vertical layered photodiodes based on AgBiS2 QDs, ZnO and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-((4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] (PTB7) as electron and hole transport layers, respectively. The J–V curves of the fabricated photodiodes are depicted in Fig. 2b. The inset shows a typical n–i–p structure of the AgBiS2 QD based photodiodes. Again, we tested them both in the dark and under white light illumination, and found that these photodiodes presented decent photocurrent, which increased with the increase of incident light intensity linearly, as shown in Fig. 2c. This result suggests that the photo-generation within the AgBiS2 QDs should not be a problem. It is also worth noting that the active layer of the AgBiS2 QDs is around 30 nm, which is extremely thin and should not limit the charge transport. However, for the lateral photoconductors, the charge transport length is 100 μm, which is a few orders of magnitude longer than the diffusion lengths of the electrons and holes reported by Diedenhofen et al. to be 60 nm and 150 nm respectively at room temperature.

The insets present device structures. 
Based on the above analysis, it is crucial to reduce the dark conductivity and increase the charge transport of the AgBiS2 thin films. In this work, we introduce C8-BTBT with relatively high mobility as the p-type organic matrix to facilitate the charge transport,26,31,32 and AgBiS2 QDs can effectively absorb photons. Such hybrid C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 thin films could offer synergistic effects and possess both merits of these two materials. We first optimized the blending ratio of the composite films. Fig. 2d presents the thin film conductance both in the dark and under illumination of the hybrid films with various blending ratios at room temperature, and the ratio of Glight and Gdark is shown in Fig. 2e. Intriguingly, the dark conductivity decreases significantly with the increase of C8-BTBT content, due to the wide bandgap nature and poor conductivity of this organic small molecule. However, the photoconductivity increased remarkably when the blending ratio was 2:1. The highest Glight/Gdark reached up to ∼4 × 103 when the light intensity was 3 mW cm−2 under a 365 nm LED. This could be attributed to the excellent charge transport properties of the C8-BTBT matrix. With the further increase of the organic contents, the photoconductivity decreased continually. This is mainly caused by the decreased photo-generation due to the decrease of absorption, as the concentration of AgBiS2 QDs in the blend films is highly diluted. Furthermore, we also tested the conductance of the optimized 2:1 blend films at the temperature range of −40 °C–100 °C. The photocurrent was measured under a green LED (535 nm) with an intensity of 5 mW cm−2, and we observed decent photon induced conductivity as shown in Fig. 2f. Compared with the pristine AgBiS2 QDs, the conductivity of the blend films exhibited less temperature-dependency, which is promising for photodetection in real applications.
To further increase the responsivity of the AgBiS2 QD based photoconductors and achieve a controllable gain, we introduce the C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 hybrid films to fabricate phototransistors. The device architecture is depicted in Fig. 3a. From the bottom to the top of the device, we used Cu as the gate electrode. A Ta2O5 and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) double layer is adopted as the dielectric layer, and the blend films work as both the photosensitive layer and the charge transport layer within the phototransistors. MoO3 is an interfacial modification layer to improve the hole injection and Ag is the source and drain electrode. It is worth noting that we did not use the conventional Si substrates, and replaced the SiO2 dielectric layers with Ta2O5/PAN layers, to rule out the influence of the photoconductivity from the Si substrates. To demonstrate the photoresponse of the Si substrates, we fabricated zinc doped tin oxide (ZTO) based TFT devices, and tested them under white light illumination as shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†). To eliminate the photosensitivity of ZTO, we filtered the white light with a 450 nm long-pass filter. In principle, wide bandgap ZTO should not have any absorption in the visible region as shown in Fig. S3b (ESI†). Then, the photoconductivity of TFT should be accounted to the Si substrates. For comparison, we also fabricated AgBiS2–organic hybrid phototransistors based on SiO2/Si substrates. The transfer curves are depicted as shown in Fig. S3c (ESI†). It can be observed that the SiO2/Si based devices did not present satisfactory photoresponsivity. Hence, we used glass as a substrate to eliminate the influence of the photoconductivity of Si substrates, and replace the dielectric layer with Ta2O5/PAN, which also possesses a high dielectric constant and break-down voltage.

Then, we first evaluated the output curves of the C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 blend film based phototransistors in the dark as presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). It is clear that the injected current could be precisely controlled by the gate voltage. We have also noticed a slight shift of the output characteristic curves, which did not pass 0A at 0 V, which may probably arise from large contact resistance or gate leakage. We have spin-coated another polymer (PAN) layer on the sputtered Ta2O5 layer and formed dense and pinhole-less hybrid dielectric layers. We also tested the impedance of the dielectric layers and obtained a stable capacitance of 5.6 nF cm−2 (as shown in Fig. S5, ESI†) with negligible gate leakage. Hence, the shifted output characteristic curves should be attributed to the contact resistance. It has also been reported that bare Ag electrodes normally exhibit a mismatched work function with p-type organic semiconductors, and require MoO3 as a modification layer.24,33 However, too thick MoO3 layers may result in a large series resistance, due to the insulating feature of MoO3. Fig. 3b also demonstrates typical transfer curves of these phototransistors in the dark and under illumination with various wavelengths. The light intensity was kept at ∼52 μW cm−2, and the voltage between the source and drain (VDS) was set to be −40 V, and the gate voltage (VGS) scanned from 30 V to −40 V. Again, these devices demonstrated excellent characteristics as a phototransistor. Apparent photoresponse can be observed from UV to NIR, and the amplitude of photoresponse was in line with the absorption spectra of the C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 blend films, indicating a strong response close to the UV region. More importantly, the lowest dark current in off-state reached ∼20 pA, which is extremely low for AgBiS2-based photodetectors. For comparison, we also fabricated photodetectors based on the same device structure with pure AgBiS2 QDs, and observed negligible field-dependent IDS as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), indicating that these devices cannot work as a suitable field-effect transistor. We also calculated the photosensitivity, which is the ratio of the measured current under illumination and in the dark, as a function of gate voltage with different wavelengths, ranging from 365 nm to 810 nm, as depicted in Fig. 3c. The maximal photosensitivity appeared at the turn-on gate voltage (−4 V), and increased from ∼102 at 810 nm to ∼104 at 365 nm, revealing excellent photosensitivity. The photocurrent (Iph = Ilight − Idark) as a function of gate voltage is also presented in Fig. S7a (ESI†). We can also calculate the responsivity (R, as shown in Fig. S7b, ESI†) based on the knowledge of photocurrent (Iph) and incident light intensity (Pin): , where S is the device area (0.002 cm2). Decent responsivity can be observed from UV to NIR, and the responsivity peaked at 365 nm with VDS = −40 V and VGS = −40 V, giving a value of ∼12 A W−1. External quantum efficiency (EQE) is another parameter to evaluate the performance of photodetectors, which can be defined with the equation: , where h, c, q and λ are the Planck constant, speed of light, elementary charge and wavelength of the incident light, respectively. The calculated EQE curve is displayed in Fig. S7c (ESI†). The high R and EQE are mainly attributed to the enhanced charge transport with the addition of C8-BTBT. Fig. 3d presents the noise density of C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 based phototransistors at VDS = −40 V and VGS = −4 V. Not surprisingly, these devices presented an extremely low noise current of ∼8 × 10−15 A Hz−1/2, benefiting from the low dark current. Then, specific detectivity (D*) can be examined with the following equation: , as shown in Fig. 3e. High specific detectivity (>1011 Jones) can be observed in the whole range from visible to NIR, and the highest value reached 1013 Jones in the UV region. We also tested the response time of these photodetectors as shown in Fig. 3f, indicating a swift response within 1 s.
Due to the extremely high responsivity near the UV region, we then systematically investigated the device performance under UV illumination. Fig. 4a depicts the transfer characteristic curves as a function of the light intensity, from 3.8 μW cm−2 to 3.8 mW cm−2 under a 365 nm LED. The VDS was kept at −40 V and the VGS scanned from 30 V to −40 V. With the increase of light intensity, the photocurrent increased remarkably, and the threshold voltage (Vth) also shifted gradually due to the photo-gating effect.34–36 We also tested the light intensity dependent device performance to other wavelength light sources as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), and found a similar trend. The corresponding photosensitivity is presented in Fig. 4b. The maximum photosensitivity was observed at the turn-on gate voltage (−6 V), and increased with the increase of light intensity. We observed that a decent photosensitivity (∼1.5 × 103) can be achieved even at an extremely weak light of 3.8 μW cm−2. Then, based on this transfer characteristic curve, we estimated the photocurrent and responsivity (as shown in Fig. S9a and b, ESI†), and the maximum responsivity reached ∼20 A W−1 at VGS = −30 V with a light intensity of 3.8 μW cm−2. Additionally, we also calculated the responsivity and specific detectivity as a function of incident light intensities (Fig. 4c) at the maximum photosensitivity point (VDS = −40 V and VGS = −6 V), and the corresponding noise densities are depicted in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Both R and D* increase with the decrease of light intensity. The highest R and D* reached were ∼7.5 A W−1 and ∼4 × 1013 Jones respectively under weak light illumination of 3.8 μW cm−2, which are almost four orders of magnitude higher than those reported in our previous work,37 and comparable to the state-of-the-art device performance of other solution-processed photodetectors.34,38

We have to note that C8-BTBT films also present excellent absorption to UV as shown in Fig. 1c, which may contribute to the responsivity in this region remarkably. To assess the photoresponse of C8-BTBT in the hybrid phototransistors, we fabricated phototransistors based on pristine C8-BTBT films. We found that pure C8-BTBT phototransistors did not present any response to a 395 nm LED, but a small responsivity (0.08 A W−1 under a 365 nm LED with a light intensity of 380 μW cm−2 at VDS = −40 V and VGS = −6 V), as shown in Fig. S11a and b (ESI†), indicating that the UV response of the hybrid phototransistor should be mainly contributed by the AgBiS2 QDs. Based on the C8-BTBT phototransistors, we also evaluated the hole mobility of C8-BTBT based on the transfer curves and the device capacitance (Fig. S5, ESI†), implying a relatively high value of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1. The excellent charge transport of the C8-BTBT channel is the key to achieve high-performance AgBiS2 based photodetectors. In addition, we further monitored the device stability as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a displays the recorded transfer curves and their threshold voltage (Vth) versus time under illumination of a 365 nm LED at 3.8 mW cm−2. We also remarked the normalized drain-source current (IDS) under continuous irradiation for 60 min at VDS = −40 V and VGS = −6 V, as shown in Fig. 5b. We can clearly observe that the transfer curves, threshold voltage and the photocurrent of the hybrid phototransistors did not change significantly, indicating remarkable device stability. Moreover, we tested the responsivity of the optimized photodetectors at various temperatures, and found that R increased slightly with the increase of temperature and peaked at a value around 20 °C. Then, the device performance decreased slightly with the increase of temperature due to the increased dark current and recombination. Overall, these devices did not present severe temperature dependence, and could potentially work over a relatively wide range of temperature from −40 °C to 80 °C, which has not been reported before. The device stability is superior, compared with most of the recently developed perovskite and organic photodetectors, implying great potential for real applications.39,40

Conclusions
In summary, a high mobility C8-BTBT organic semiconductor was introduced to facilitate the charge transport of AgBiS2 QD based thin films. The photoconductivity of the C8-BTBT:AgBiS2 hybrid films was systematically investigated in a wide range of temperatures from −40 °C to 100 °C. Comparing with the results of AgBiS2 QD based photodiodes, we carefully excluded the effect of photo-generation, and pointed out that the device performance was mainly limited by the poor charge transport. Based on the optimized blend films, we further fabricated photodetectors with a transistor architecture. After optimization, the phototransistors presented a wide response range from UV to NIR, excellent device stability, a high photosensitivity of 1.5 × 103 and a decent responsivity of up to 20 A W−1. Benefiting from the extremely low dark current and noise, the devices reached an ultrahigh specific detectivity of 4 × 1013 Jones under UV illumination, which is almost four orders of magnitude higher than that in a previous report, indicating great potential for next generation solution-processed photodetectors.
