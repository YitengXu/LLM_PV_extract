    , Accepted 5th November 2014First published on 5th November 2014AbstractWe report the feasibility of assembling rear-irradiated flexible dye-sensitized solar cells employing a transparent Ni–Se alloy counter electrode along with a groove stored TiO2 and liquid electrolyte. The flexible device with the NiSe counter electrode and anode at a groove depth of 36 μm yielded a maximum efficiency of 7.35%.
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is an electrochemical device, converting solar energy into electricity with no emissions.1–7 The state-of-the-art DSSCs are always assembled on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass substrates,8,9 leading to inferiorities in frangibility, high weight, unyieldingness, and high cost. One solution to this impasse is the employment of flexible substrates, such as Ti foil,10 tin doped indium oxide (ITO)/poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN),11 or ITO/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates for flexible DSSC assembly. Because the ITO/PEN or ITO/PET substrates suffer devitrification and deformation at calcination temperatures exceeding 150 °C, conductive plastic supported TiO2 cannot realize a crystal transition from rutile to anatase. Therefore, unsatisfactory power conversion efficiencies are obtained from flexible cell devices.12–14 Although there are emerging low-temperature techniques for anatase TiO2 nanocrystallites,15 the adhesiveness between the TiO2 film and flexible substrate is still unsatisfactory, leading to a high interfacial resistance to electron transportation. An ideal flexible DSSC comprises a Ti foil supported TiO2 anode, Pt coated ITO/PEN (or ITO/PET) counter electrode (CE), and liquid electrolyte containing I−/I3− redox couples. From this point of view, irradiation from the rear side is the sole technique for driving this system.16 The traditional Pt CE, however, has a metallic luster and reflects most of the incident light, resulting in a low light intensity for dye irradiation and electron generation. Another existing problem is leakage and evaporation of the liquid electrolyte. Although the utilization of quasi-solid-state and full-solid-state electrolytes can well reserve redox couples,17–20 the relatively low charge transfer kinetics within the electrolytes has been considered a tremendous limitation for efficiency enhancement. By addressing these two issues, the explorations of cost-effective and transparent CEs as well as a new sealing strategy for liquid electrolyte appear to be crucial for achieving cell devices with high efficiency and good stability.
Inspired by a container for liquid storage, in which the bottom and surrounding sides are blocked, leaving the top cover open, in the current work, we successfully designed transparent nickel selenide (Ni–Se) alloys on flexible ITO/PEN substrates and etched Ti foil to reserve dye-sensitized TiO2 and liquid electrolyte. A TiO2 film was consolidated within the etched groove and liquid electrolyte is stored in the nanopores of TiO2 layer. Therefore, the leakage issue for the liquid electrolyte can be solved by sealing it in a groove surrounded by Ti foil and a Ni–Se CE cover compared to the interface sealing in a traditional flexible DSSC device. A maximum efficiency of 7.35% was recorded under a simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) global sunlight by optimizing the Ni–Se ratio and groove depth.

Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of the processes for etching, TiO2 coating, dye sensitization, electrolyte injection, and cell assembly. The depth of the groove is controlled by adjusting the etching time. In the current work, an etching speed of 3 μm cm−1 was used to create grooves. Like a container, the injected liquid electrolyte is reserved by the etched groove and covered by a Ni–Se alloy electrode.

As shown in Fig. 2a, X-ray diffraction (XRD) gives characteristic diffraction peaks at 33.2°, 44.7°, 50.5°, and 61.8° for the (210), (111), (311), and (400) planes, respectively. The result indicates that NiSe alloy (PDF #88-1711) has been synthesized successfully by the electrochemical deposition reported here. Lattice fringes were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), as shown in Fig. 2b, suggesting that the resulting alloy has good crystallinity. Moreover, the detection of lattice distortions reveals the formation of defects by alloying Ni and Se, promoting the I3− reduction process. As shown in Fig. 2c, the resulting flexible Ni–Se alloy electrodes have high optical transparency in the visible region (>70%), suggesting a good dye excitation and electron generation at rear irradiation.21Fig. 2d compares the J–V curves of the DSSCs employing various CEs irradiated from the rear side and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The cell device with the NiSe alloy CE yields an η of 7.35% (Jsc = 17.52 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.69 V, and FF of 60.8%) under simulated AM1.5, which is superior to the flexible DSSCs reported in literature.22–24 Ni is a typical transition metal with an unfilled d orbital. Therefore, the alloy of Ni with Se can accept electrons to form coordinated intermediates, which is a prerequisite for robust CE materials. Because of the remarkable catalytic activities of Se and Ni, they have been widely used as electrocatalysts in driving fuel cells.25,26 To our knowledge, the measured η is in a very high level for liquid electrolyte-based flexible DSSCs with Pt-free CEs. The η was observed in the order of NiSe > Ni1.1Se > Ni0.9Se > Ni0.8Se > Ni1.2Se > Ni0.7Se > Ni0.6Se because of a synergistic effect of the catalytic activity, charge-transfer ability and transparency. To investigate the dependence of the TiO2 thickness on the photovoltaic performance, the Ti foil was etched to obtain various groove depths with a range of 0–66 μm. Fig. 2e exhibits the characteristic J–V curves of the cell devices with FeSe CE and anodes at diverse TiO2 film thicknesses. In contrast to traditional DSSCs, the incident light penetrates into the cell device from rear side (CE side). Therefore, a thick TiO2 layer is expected to increase the N719 dye loading. From Table S2 (ESI†), it is apparent that the Jsc has a peak value at a TiO2 thickness of 36 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†). The elevated dye loading and therefore the photogenerated electron density on the conduction band of TiO2 improve Jsc over the thickness range of 0–36 μm. On the other hand, a TiO2 thickness >36 μm can cause two issues: (i) no light irradiation for the adsorbed N719 dyes in the deep areas, and (ii) the diffusion of I3− species to the groove bottom. A direct result is the decrease in interconversion between I3− and I− and therefore the dye recovery kinetics. If not specified, the thickness of the TiO2 layer is 36 μm. As a reference, the ITO/PEN supported Pt electrode was also prepared using the same cyclic voltammetry method, giving a comparable η of 2.75% (Jsc = 6.03 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.682 V, and FF of 66.9%), as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). The low power conversion efficiency is mainly due to the high reflection toward incident light (Fig. 2c) because the pristine Pt electrode has similar catalytic activity with Ni0.8Se alloy CE (Fig. S2b and c, ESI†).

A golden rule in evaluating the function of a CE for DSSC applications is to compare the catalytic activity for the reduction of I3− ions. Fig. 3a displays cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of Ni–Se alloy electrodes recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, giving two pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks (Ox1/Red1, Ox2/Red2). The peak current density of Red1 and Ox1/|Red1| ratio are two key parameters for assessing the catalytic activity and reversibility of a CE toward I−/I3− redox couples.27 Because the Red1 peaks have similar positions, the catalytic activities of the alloy electrodes are NiSe > Ni1.1Se > Ni0.9Se > Ni0.8Se > Ni1.2Se > Ni0.7Se > Ni0.6Se. From the outward extension of the peak positions in stacking the CV curves of NiSe alloy electrode along with the linear relationships between the square root of the scan rate and the peak current densities, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), we can conclude that the redox reaction is a diffusion-controlled mechanism on alloy CE.28 From the Red1 peak current density (JRed1), we can obtain the diffusion coefficient (Dn) of the I−/I3− redox couples at the electrode surface using Randles–Sevcik theory (JRed1 = 2.69 × 105n3/2ADn1/2v1/2C):29–32 NiSe (2.82 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1) > Ni1.1Se (1.97 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1) > Ni0.9Se (1.80 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1) > Ni0.8Se (1.31 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1) > Ni1.2Se (1.25 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1) > Ni0.7Se (7.42 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1) > Ni0.6Se (7.29 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1), where n is the number of electrons participating in the Red1 reaction, A is the active area, v is the scan rate, and C is the I3− concentration. In particular, Ox1/|Red1| of the alloy electrodes were calculated to be 0.995 for NiSe, 1.03 for Ni1.1Se, 1.12 for Ni0.9Se, 1.21 for Ni0.8Se, 1.28 for Ni1.2Se, 1.30 for Ni0.7Se, and 1.32 for Ni0.6Se. The higher peak current density and Dn along with the lower Ox1/|Red1| suggest that the NiSe alloy CE presents higher catalytic activity and better reversibility,33 which are prerequisites for a robust CE in efficient DSSCs. The Bode EIS plots from the symmetric dummy cells in Fig. 3b provides appropriate data to calculate the average reduction time of I3− species. The electrons collected by the alloy CE from the external circuit participate in the reduction reaction of I3− + 2e → 3I−. Therefore, the lifetime (τ) of the electrons at electrolyte/CE interface can be used to assess the reaction kinetics of the CE material. The electron lifetime can be obtained by τ = 1/2πf,34 giving a mean electron lifetime of NiSe (15.9 μs) < Ni1.1Se (19.1 μs) < Ni0.9Se (34.0 μs) < Ni0.8Se (61.9 μs) < Ni1.2Se (155.5 μs) < Ni0.7Se (235.4 μs) < Ni0.6Se (289.6 μs), where f is the frequency of the second peak. A short τ means that the reflux electrons (from the external circuit to CE) can be facilely collected by the alloy film and are involved in the I3− reduction reaction (I3− + 2e− → 3I−). To demonstrate the charge-transfer ability of the alloy electrodes, the Nyquist electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in Fig. 3c were recorded in symmetric dummy cells. After fitting with Zview software, the related charge-transfer resistances (Rct) were in the order of NiSe (0.21 Ω cm2) < Ni1.1Se (0.35 Ω cm2) < Ni0.9Se (0.37 Ω cm2) < Ni0.8Se (1.07 Ω cm2) < Ni1.2Se (1.52 Ω cm2) < Ni0.7Se (2.10 Ω cm2) < Ni0.6Se (2.74 Ω cm2). The Tafel polarization measurements were used to reconfirm the catalytic activity and charge-transfer ability of the metal selenide alloy electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3d, the exchange current density (J0 = RT/nFRct) derived from the slopes of the anodic or cathodic branches were in the order of NiSe > Ni1.1Se > Ni0.9Se > Ni0.8Se > Ni1.2Se > Ni0.7Se > Ni0.6Se.35 In addition, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim = 2nFCDn/l) generated from the intersection of the cathodic branch with Y-axis also had the same sequence to J0.36 The results from the CV curves, lifetime analysis, EIS spectra, and Tafel polarization measurements are consistent.

The fast start-up, multiple start–stop cycling, and high stability are three prerequisites for the applications of solar panels in movable power sources and photovoltaic curtain walls. A critical issue in solving these problems is to explore an efficient electrocatalyst for CE.37,38Fig. 4a shows the on–off (start–stop) switch on the cell with the NiSe electrode by alternating the irradiation of the device with intensities of 100 and 0 mW cm−2. An abrupt increase in current density and no delay in time suggests that the resulting NiSe alloy CE is vigorous in reducing I3− species. As a reference, the related on–off switch of a standard Pt electrode based DSSCs is also provided, in which a lower current density means a lack of motivation in driving a DSSC. In addition, start–stop cycling can be used to evaluate the multiple start-up capability of a DSSC. After eight start–stop cycles, the cell still retains the properties in its initial level, which is an essential prerequisite for the application of DSSCs in power sources. Under durable irradiation over 600 min, as shown in Fig. 4b, 101.3% and 99.8% of the initial photocurrent densities remained in the cells with NiSe and Pt electrodes, respectively. This result suggests relatively good stabilities of the solar cells with a NiSe alloy and pristine Pt electrode, which is consistent with the normalized efficiency in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Although the 600 min-test cannot evaluate the long-term stability of a real cell device, these results highlight the potential realization of robust flexible DSSCs.

In summary, we demonstrated that an electrochemical deposition technique of Ni–Se alloys is an effective strategy for designing cost-effective and transparent CE materials and enhancing the photovoltaic performance of flexible DSSCs, while the seal of liquid electrolyte in the etched groove of Ti foil can significantly enhance the electrolyte retention. The NiSe alloy CE exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward I3− species and charge-transfer ability. The DSSCs assembled using the NiSe alloy CE and Ti foil reserved the TiO2 film with a thickness of 36 μm and provided an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.35% for irradiation from the rear side. Moreover, the fast start-up, multiple start–stop capability, and high stability encourage the potential applications of such flexible DSSCs in movable power sources and photovoltaic curtain walls. The research presented here is far from being optimized but the new concept along with the cost-effective synthesis and scalable materials highlight the potential of these CEs and anodes in robust flexible DSSCs.
