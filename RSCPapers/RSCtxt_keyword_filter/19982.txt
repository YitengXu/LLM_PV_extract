    , Accepted 31st August 2019First published on 3rd September 2019AbstractTo reveal the influences of introducing various end-capping units onto small-molecule (SM) donors, in this article, 2-octylthio-thiophene (TS), 2-octyl-thiazole (TZ) and 2-octylthiothiazole (TZS) are strategically selected as end-capping units to combine with a fluorinated 2,2′-bithiophene (FBT) core and thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) units as electron acceptors to afford three novel D(A–Ar)2 type SM donors, namely FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2. The structure-property relationships provoked by slight changes in the terminal groups were systematically evaluated. In particular, TZS end-units make FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 possess better molecular stacking, higher mobility and better miscibility in the blend with PC71BM in comparison with the other two SMs. As a result, the introduction of TZS end-groups has been found to enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) simultaneously. After optimization, an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.91% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 16.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.93% was obtained for the FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 based device, which is among the top values of the D(A–Ar)2 type single junction small molecular BHJ-OSCs. Our results obtained here indicate that strategic hetero-substitution of end-capping units in D(A–Ar)2 type SMs is an efficient strategy to improve photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
Considered as promising candidates for renewable clean energy sources, organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have drawn a great deal of attention because of their unique advantages, such as solution processability, low-cost, light weight, flexibility and large area preparation.1–6 In the past few years, polymer-based bulk hetero-junction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) have presented a dramatic improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE), achieving up to 14% in single junctions.7 To date, the best PCEs of polymer donors in the single-junction and tandem solar cells have reached 16.35%8,9 and 17.3%,10 respectively. Meanwhile, the highest PCE of small molecule (SM) donors in single junction BHJ-OSCs has reached 11.5% with a D(π–A1—π–A2)2 type molecular backbone,11 11.3% with a D(π–A)2 type molecular backbone12 and 9.0% with a D(A–Ar)2 type molecular backbone in single junction OSCs,13 respectively. Furthermore, the small molecular ternary and tandem OSCs have achieved PCEs of 13.6% and 12.7%, respectively.14,15 Undoubtedly, in parallel with polymer materials, SM-OSCs have been considered to be promising candidates for highly efficient OPVs.16–33
Compared to the polymer solar cells (PSCs), SM-OSCs possess numerous advantages, including a relatively simple synthesis and purification process, monodispersity, a well-defined structure, less batch-to-batch variation and no end-group contaminants.16,17 Meanwhile, SMs also have a versatile molecular structure, easier band structure control, a high charge carrier mobility, etc.18,19 Obviously, the SM donors not only provide a more reliable analysis of structure–property relationships of the device performance, but also help to obtain high-performance OPVs. Therefore, solution-processed SM-OSCs have attracted increasing attention and display great potential for high-performance OPVs.11–19
In the past few years, a series of SMs with different backbones, such as donor–acceptor (D–A),20,21 D(π–A)212,22–24 and D(π–A1–π–A2)2,11 has been rationally designed and synthesized by combining different donor and acceptor units. To address this issue, it is believed that several requirements should be considered systematically to design molecular structures for high-performance and solution-processed SM-OSCs, that is, (1) an excellent film-formation ability, (2) a wide and efficient absorption, (3) matched energy levels with acceptors, (4) a planar structure for high hole mobility, (5) good solubility and chemical and thermal stability.25 It is notable that the design of SMs with a good film formation ability is a prerequisite for high-performance solution-processed BHJ devices, since it has generally been difficult for SMs to form a comparably good quality film to that of polymers, especially for those molecules with relatively low molecular weights and rigid planar structures owing to their intrinsic aggregation.26,27 One effective strategy to adjust the film formation ability of SMs is terminal modification, because the terminal groups will have an impact on the nanostructure of the blend films. Moreover, the terminal groups have an impact on the bandgap, light absorption, and intermolecular stacking of donor materials.28–30 All the advantages mentioned above make terminal modulation of donor materials a prevailing way to improve the PCEs.31–33 Up to now, the D–A type strategy has been the most effective method to cause intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and the D(A–Ar)2 type molecular skeleton is a product of both terminal modification and the D–A strategy; as a result, the molecular backbone of D(A–Ar)2 possesses the following advantages: first, a relatively stronger ICT effect; secondly, tunable film formation ability; thirdly, tunable end-to-end stacking; finally, molecular energy levels that are easier to regulate. Recently, an encouraging outcome of D(A–Ar)2 type SM-OSCs has been obtained by our group, and the PCE of single junction BHJ-OSCs has reached 9.0%,13 which is one of the highest records of D(A–Ar)2 type SM-OSCs.13,34,35 As we all know, a highly planar conformation is considered to be one of the most essential features for high performance organic materials. Among all kinds of strategies for designing highly performing materials, noncovalent conformational locks (NCLs) have been widely used to increase the planarity and rigidity for π-conjugated systems. Fluorination is an effective strategy to build F–S and F–H NCLs, and it has been proved to be one of the most successful ways to enhance photovoltaic performance,36–40 mainly ascribed to the fluorine introduction in conjugated polymers affording deeper energy levels, higher absorption coefficients, more ordered molecular stacking by induced dipoles along the C–F bond or S–F bond, and reduction of recombination loss in bulk heterojunction systems.41–44 Meanwhile, among the multitudinous electron-deficient units employed to date, the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit stands out, due to its strong electron-withdrawing ability and high polarity. The resulting SMs exhibit wide and tunable absorption, high mobilities for both holes and electrons, and enhanced crystallinity, all of which are beneficial for a high short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) in OSCs.45–49 As DPP is formed from an electron-deficient fused lactam ring, flanked by donors, the frontier molecular orbital levels and intramolecular and intermolecular interactions can be tuned to achieve desirable electronic and transport properties.45
Introducing electron-deficient units to lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of materials is an effective way to increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) value; however, the traditional highly electron-deficient acceptor units are difficult to synthesize and it is hard to fine tune the energy levels in order to reasonably lower the HOMO level without generating new steric hindrance; inserting suitable hetero atoms into the molecular backbone and the alkyl chains is an effective strategy to solve this problem. Recently, attaching alkylthio chains to thiophene side-chains of the two-dimension (2D)-conjugated polymer has been proved to be a powerful strategy to decrease the HOMO level and increase Voc.50–53 Up to now, a few alkylthio moieties as terminal units on SMs have been applied in OSCs,54 which is inadequate for obtaining the data of non-alkylthio substitute analogues. Furthermore, there are many reports about the molecular fused-heterocycle thiazole-based core, which has some unique characteristics compared to the thiophene-based core: first, red-shifted absorption and a broadened absorption region; secondly, an increased molar absorption coefficient; thirdly, an increased fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (Jsc).55–57 Replacing the thiophene π-bridge with a thiazole π-bridge to form N–S NCLs has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve photovoltaic performance.58–60 However, the application of thiazole units as terminal substituents in linear SMs has not been reported so far. The relationship between the structure of the end-capped alkylthio or terminal thiazole substituted OSC materials and the performance of photovoltaic devices still remains unclear. Obviously, systematic research on terminal thiazole and end-capped alkylthio substituents in SMs is quite necessary.
To systematically investigate the influence of the various end-capping units on the photovoltaic performance of SMs with a D(A–Ar)2 skeleton, in this work, we report three novel D(A–Ar)2 type SMs through end-unit engineering of 2-octylthio- thiophene (TS), 2-octyl-thiazole (TZ) and 2-octylthio-thiazole (TZS), respectively, and we employ a fluorinated 2,2′-bithiophene (FBT) as a core and thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) as an acceptor arm to construct π-conjugated molecules, namely, FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively. Their molecular structures are shown in Chart 1. We focus on studying the effect of subtle differences in the terminal groups of SMs on the optical properties and electronic properties and seek some design strategies for high-performance photovoltaic devices. As a result, after optimization of the donor/acceptor morphology by pre-treatment as well as CS2-SVA treatment, the devices with PC71BM as an acceptor presented the PCEs of 6.96%, 7.63% and 8.91% for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively. More encouragingly, the best PCE of 8.91% with a simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 16.75 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.93% was obtained for the device based on FBT(TDPP-TZS)2/PC71BM, which is attributed to the fact that FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 exhibits a lower band gap, better planarity, higher carrier mobility and better film morphology in comparison with FBT(TDPP-TS)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZ)2.49,61 The results herein indicate that subtle changes in the terminal units can remarkably affect the material properties and photoelectric performance.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis, thermal properties and crystallinity
The synthetic routes to these D(A–Ar)2 type SMs, integrating the advantages of divergent and appropriate synthetic strategies, are shown in Scheme 1. All SMs were synthesized through Stille coupling reactions under a nitrogen atmosphere. It was wondrously found that the synthesis of thiazole alkylation (TZR1) was very challenging, which is due to the influence of the lack of electrons in the thiazole unit. These SMs are soluble in common organic solvents, such as DCM, CF, and dichlorobenzene (CB) at RT. Their structures were fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and elemental analysis, as described in the Experimental section (Fig. S1–S26, see the ESI†).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to SMs. 
Under nitrogen protection at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, thermal stability and phase transition were measured through thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The recorded TGA and DSC curves are presented in Fig. 1 and their corresponding data are summarized in Table 1, respectively. All the SMs exhibit good thermal stability with 5% weight loss (Td) of above 360 °C, as derived from the TGA curves (Fig. 1a); meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 1b, the endothermic transition temperatures and exothermic transition temperatures of the TS-, TZ- and TZS-terminated SMs are 199/196 °C, 213/210 °C and 211/206 °C, respectively. Clearly, compared to FBT(TDPP-TS)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZ)2, FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 exhibits an obvious increase in its enthalpies (ΔHm and ΔHc), implying that FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 possesses a larger tendency towards crystallization than the other two SMs.60 Clearly, the better crystallinity property should be beneficial for enhancing the Jsc and FF of the corresponding device.41,42

2.2. Optical properties
To further confirm the relationship between the molecular structure and the corresponding photophysical properties, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the three SMs in dilute CF solution and in neat films are displayed respectively in Fig. 2, and the related data are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 2a, FBT(TDPP-TS)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 showed two distinct and intense absorption bands (band I: 300–400 nm; band II: 500–700 nm) resulting from the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), respectively. Compared to the absorption profiles of FBT(TDPP-TS)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZ)2, FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 possesses an additional absorption band III (400–500 nm), which is attributed to the n–π* transition of the conjugated backbone. Meanwhile, in comparison with the absorption spectra of FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 show some degree of blue-shift, which is assigned to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the end-capping thiazole unit. As presented in Fig. S27 (ESI†), the maximum absorption coefficient (ε) values of the TS-, TZ- and TZS-terminated SMs are found to be 1.28 × 105 cm−1 M−1, 1.36 × 105 cm−1 M−1, and 1.43 × 105 cm−1 M−1 in the low-lying energy area, respectively. A higher ε value means a material is expected to absorb more solar photons, which is conducive to obtaining higher Jsc values in its OSCs. The simulated absorption spectrum is displayed in Fig. S28 (ESI†), and we can conclude from the simulated absorption spectrum that the absorption band III of 400–500 nm of FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 is outstanding among the three SMs, which coincides well with the results of absorption spectrum measurements. Meanwhile, the higher-energy based transitions of S0–S18, S0–S19 or S0–S20 are ascribed to the π–π* transition, and the lower-energy based transitions of S0–S7, S0–S8 or S0–S9 at 400–500 nm wavelength are attributed to the n–π* transition. The results are consistent with the energy law of δ–δ* > n–δ* > π–π* > n–π*. Furthermore, the simulated absorption coefficient (ε) is also well coincident with the tendency of the measured absorption coefficient (ε) value.

As shown in Fig. 2b, in the thin films of these SMs, the transitions attributed to ICT and optically active aggregates strongly overlap with themselves, and result in a very broad absorption from 500 to 850 nm. Interestingly, the blue-shifted band and the red-shifted band were found in the long-wavelength region, respectively, and were attributed to the H-aggregation band and the J-aggregation band in thin films. As can be seen from the decreasing J-aggregation band, the proportion of FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 shows more tendency to H reorganization in the aggregation mode due to the better planarity of the TZ- and TZS-terminated SMs. Estimated from the onset absorption spectra of the thin films, the optical bandgap (Eoptg) values of these SMs are about 1.55 eV, 1.57 eV and 1.61 eV for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively. Obviously, appending the different terminal units into D(A–Ar)2 type linear SMs can not only fine tune the Eoptg of their resulting SMs, but also adjust the absorption coefficient of the corresponding SMs.
Temperature-dependent absorption spectra of these SMs in CB solution are shown in Fig. 3. Looking at the intensity ratio of the 2 vibrionic peaks A0–0 and A0–1, with the enhancement of solution temperature from 30 to 90 °C, all ratios of IA0–1/IA0–0 decrease slightly, and their corresponding A0–1 maximum intensities displayed a certain degree of blue-shift. Certainly, the ratio of IA0–1/IA0–0 combined with the observed blue-shift matches well with the fact that rising temperature generates molecular disorder and weakens π–π stacking interactions. The A0–1 peaks of FBT(TDPP-TS)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 are observed to be more prominent than that of FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 at different temperatures, and this reveals that FBT(TDPP-TS)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 have more tendency towards aggregation than FBT(TDPP-TZS)2.13

2.3. Electrochemical properties
To understand how the end group and the backbone structure affect the orbital energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 in thin films, using a three-electrode setup and ferrocene as the internal standard. The ionization potentials and electron affinities, which are also widely termed HOMO/LUMO energy levels, calculated using the following standard equations: EHOMO = [−(Eoxvs. Ag/AgCl − Eferrocenevs. Ag/AgCl + 4.8)] eV and ELUMO = [−(Eredvs. Ag/AgCl − Eferrocenevs. Ag/AgCl + 4.8)] eV, were estimated to be −5.24 eV/−3.25 eV for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, −5.41 eV/−3.31 eV for FBT(TDPP-TZ)2, and −5.25 eV/−3.29 eV for FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively, based on the corresponding onset potential of the first oxidative and reductive wave (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Furthermore, the electrochemical band gap (Eeleg) values were calculated to be 1.98, 2.10 and 1.96 eV for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively, which are well in accord with the results of the absorption measurements (Eoptg).69 From the data, we can see that the introduced TZ and TZS units can more effectively reduce the HOMO level of FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, which is attributed to the strong withdrawing ability of the TZ unit and is expected to enable a relatively higher Voc from the OSCs fabricated later.54 Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 4b, the LUMO energy levels of these SMs are located within a suitable range from 3.31 to 3.25 eV, and they are higher than that of PC71BM. This suggests that efficient charge separation and transfer could be expected to occur in their corresponding devices.

2.4. Theoretical calculations
To obtain a better comprehension of the electronic structure geometry of these SMs, the optimized molecular geometries and electronic distributions of these SMs were simulated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. As shown in Fig. 5a, the dihedral (DH) angles between the FBT central core and the TDPP unit were estimated to be 31.775°, 0.153° and 0.162° for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively. Furthermore, the DH angles between the DFBT unit and the different terminal unit of three SMs were calculated to be 16.325°, 13.514° and 13.244° for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively. Clearly, the DH results obtained here demonstrate that FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 displays the best molecular planarity over that of the other SMs, which can boost intermolecular π–π stacking and further promote the enhancement of its FF value. As shown in Fig. 5b, the electron densities are delocalized over the whole conjugated backbone in the HOMO and LUMO for these SMs, and the high level overlap of the HOMO and the LUMO is beneficial to facilitating intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects in their molecules.60–64 Moreover, the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels and the variable trend match well with the tendency of the above CV data.

2.5. Hole mobilities
As we all know, Jsc and FF values of the related devices are influenced a lot by the hole-only mobility (μh) parameter.60 Consequently, we measured the μh of these SMs in their hole-only cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(5000 rpm, 140 °C, 30 min)/(SMs:PC71BM) (1:1, w/w) (2000 rpm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Au (100 nm) by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) technique, respectively.62,66 The photosensitive layer was subsequently prepared by spin-coating a solution of SM/PC71BM (1:1, w/w) in CF with 0.4% CN (CN/CF, v/v) on the PEDOT layer with a typical concentration of 12 mg mL−1, spin-coating at RT, followed by CS2 solvent vapor annealing (SVA) for 30 s. The J–V curve of the hole-only device is shown in Fig. 6, and the calculated data are listed in Table 3. The μh values of 1.89 × 10−4, 4.95 × 10−4 and 7.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were estimated for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2-based devices according to the Mott–Gurney equation,60,61 respectively. Obviously, the higher coplanarity of the molecular backbone of FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 exhibits a relatively higher μh, which is helpful for the enhancement of Jsc and FF parameters of the related SM-OSCS.62–66

2.6. Device and photovoltaic properties
Employing these SMs as electron donors and PC71BM as an electron acceptor in the active layer, a series of BHJ OSCs was made. Under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, solution-processed SMs with the optimized device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (5000 rpm, 140 °C 30 min)/(SMs:PC71BM) (2000 rpm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated. The device area is 0.1 cm2 as defined by a shadow mask. The active layer of SMs/PC71BM was obtained from CF solution at a concentration of 12 mg mL−1. Various D/A weight ratios, 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive concentrations, solvents used for vapor annealing (SVA) and spin-coating rates were selected to optimize device performance. The detailed device fabrication data of the optimization process are summarized in Fig. S29–S37 and Tables S1–S9 (ESI†). As a result, the SMs:PC71BM-based devices possess the most optimal D/A ratio of 1:1, a CN additive concentration of 0.4%, a spin-coating rate of 3000 rpm, and the CS2-SVA treatment was performed for 30 s to optimize the surface morphology of the active blends, respectively. Fig. 7a presents the optimal J–V features of the SMs/PC71BM based solar cells and Table 3 summarizes the corresponding device parameter data. The results indicated that the elevated Jsc and FF values of the devices fabricated using FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 were 15.16/62.47, 16.12/63.09, and 16.75/66.93 (mA cm−2/%), respectively. Apparently, as compared to TS-substituted FBT(TDPP-TS)2 and TZ-substituted FBT(TDPP-TZ)2, the device based on TZS-substituted FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 exhibited a best PCE of 8.91% with a simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 16.75 and FF of 66.93%, which should be ascribed to its better coplanarity, better film morphology and higher hole-only mobility discussed above and below.45,63 Simultaneously, the FBT(TDPP-TZS)2-based device exhibits a smaller series resistance (Rs), which indicates that it has better exciton separation resulting in the improvement in Jsc and carrier mobility.11,41,42 The results reported here apparently illustrate that highly efficient SM-OSCs can be achieved by tuning the molecules with appropriate end-group engineering and optimization of the phase-separated morphology through a suitable solvent–vapor annealing process.

To gain insight into why the devices based on FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 possess the highest Jsc value among the SMs, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices with the SMs/PC71BM blend under the optimized conditions were measured to be 74.55% at 599 nm, 78.64% at 600 nm and 78.88% at 649 nm for the devices based on FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 blending films with PC71BM, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7b, the corresponding Jsc values are 14.95, 15.78 and 16.69 mA cm−2 obtained by using the EQE values for the FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 blending films, respectively, which match well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V assessments with a little error below 3%. Consequently, attaching TZS units instead of TS or TZ units onto the DFDT(DPP)2 molecular skeleton terminals can enhance the photo-response efficiency of their SMs in the PC71BM blend film,63 suggesting the reason for why the FBT(TDPP-TZS)2:PC71BM based device can obtain the highest Jsc value.60–64
2.7. XRD analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are conventionally employed to deeply investigate the crystalline nature and molecular stacking in the solid state. As shown in Fig. 8, the first diffraction peaks of FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 are located at 2θ = 7.10°, 6.75° and 5.53°, respectively, which arise from the (100) diffraction (d100) between the planes of the main conjugation chains in these SMs separated by alkyl chains, implying that the three SMs possess good crystallinity. Meanwhile, the equivalent d100 spacings are 24.42 Å, 24.52 Å and 24.63 Å calculated by using the Bragg equation (2dsinθ = nλ) for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively, which is ascribed to the (010) diffraction from π–π stacking. Moreover, the corresponding π–π stacking distance (dπ) between the molecular coplanar SM frameworks is also estimated to be 3.64 Å, 3.63 Å and 3.61 Å for FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively. It is found that the dπ spacings of FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 were found to be much shorter than those of FBT(TDPP-TS)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZ)2, which implies that the grafted TZS terminal units can enhance the π–π packing feature and reduce the interchain interactions of their SMs, thus improving the carrier mobility. Obviously, the acquired results are consistent with the DFT theoretical evaluations and the obtained μh values mentioned above, and they are advantageous to increase the values of Jsc and FF in the OSCs.62–66

2.8. Film morphologies and miscibility
In particular, the surface morphology of the active layers with fine nanophase separation is an important factor to improve device performance in OSCs. Fig. 9 depicts the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images (5 × 5 μm2) of the SMs/PC71BM blend films of the optimized devices. As shown in Fig. 9, a rather smooth surface can be observed, with average root mean square (RMS) roughness values of FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 blend films of 2.56, 1.86 and 1.55 nm, respectively, demonstrating that these SMs possess good miscibility with PC71BM. Undoubtedly, the FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 blend films exhibited the best morphology with some ordered nanofiber structures and bicontinuous networks among all SM blend films. Consequently, grafting different end-capped units can enhance the morphology of SMs in PC71BM blend films. A smoother surface can decrease aggregation without large phase separation, form a well interpenetrating network structure and enlarge the D–A contacting region, which would promote the exciton dissociation and charge transport efficiency, and thus induce higher Jsc and FF values, giving rise to a higher PCE.60–64

To investigate the effect of solvent vapor annealing on the photo-active layer, the morphology of the blend film was tested by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The blend films were prepared by spin-coating the SM/PC71BM blend on ITO/PEDOT:PSS. Fig. 10 displays TEM images of the SM/PC71BM blend based on FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TZS)2, respectively. For the original films without any treatment, all the three blend films show a clear fibril structure. In contrast, after processing by CS2 vapor annealing, all the three blend films exhibit finer features with better miscibility and smaller phase separation between SMs and PC71BM, which is helpful for exciton dissociation at the D/A interface and charge transport along the interpenetrating network. A similar effect of the solvent vapor annealing was previously reported,34,35 which can improve the BHJ film morphology with a better bicontinuous interpenetrating network.

To understand the interfacial properties of three SMs and PC71BM, the changes in contact angles to check the polarity and miscibility between the donor materials and acceptor PC71BM were investigated. Ideal morphology is usually due to good miscibility and similar surface energies of the molecular donors and acceptors.67–69Fig. 11 exhibits the contact angles of diiodomethane drops (nonpolar liquid) and deionized water drops (polar liquid) on the surfaces of the corresponding thin films, which can beneficially evaluate the surface energies of these SMs and PC71BM films, respectively. The diiodomethane and deionized water contact angles are 39.5° and 94.5° for the pure FBT(TDPP-TS)2 film, 38.5° and 91° for the pure FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 film, 36.5° and 89.5° for the pure FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 film, and 33.5° and 85.5° for the pure PC71BM film, respectively. Obviously, the PC71BM film exhibits an improved hydrophilic property due to the hydrophilic nature of its acid groups. Meanwhile, the estimated surface energies of FBT(TDPP-TS)2, FBT(TDPP-TZ)2, FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 and PC71BM were confirmed to be 15.76, 21.82, 24.68 and 36.93 mN m−1, respectively. The results illustrate that the surface energies of FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 are more similar to those of PC71BM, suggesting that FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 and PC71BM possess moderate miscibility, which would be beneficial for the formation of satisfactory BHJ morphology.67–69

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, high-efficiency organic photovoltaic materials were obtained through molecular engineering of end-capping units in D(A–Ar)2 framework SMs. The effects of various terminal units on optical, electrochemical, hole mobility, morphological and photovoltaic properties were exposed systematically. The end-capping TZS unit enabled FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 to possess better molecular packing and higher mobility in comparison with the TS or TZ-terminated SMs. After optimization, a maximum PCE of 8.91% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 16.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.93% was obtained for the FBT(TDPP-TZS)2 based device, which is about 1.17 and 1.28 times higher than those of FBT(TDPP-TZ)2 and FBT(TDPP-TS)2 based devices, respectively. This work implies that end-group engineering is a worthy strategy in tuning the material properties and device performance of the resulting SMs.

In a three-neck round-bottom flask, under a nitrogen atmosphere, compounds BrTDPP-TSR1 (158 mg, 0.19 mmol) and FBT(Sn)2 (48 mg, 0.09 mmol) were dissolved in 30 mL of dry toluene, then Pd(PPh3)4 (6.3 mg, 0.0054 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 12 h at 110 °C.
