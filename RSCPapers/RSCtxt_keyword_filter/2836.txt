To this end, two dithiafulvene-based organic sensitizers with different molecular shapes were synthesized, and the influence of their aggregation on TiO2 on the various performance parameters of DSCs was investigated. It was found that V-shaped DTF-C5, with a larger flare angle of 150.6° between the donor and acceptor units in the molecular structure, tended to form compact aggregates on the surface of TiO2 without the loss of adsorbed dyes, thus giving a higher short-circuit density (Jsc) of 14.92 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.39%; these values were 1.48 and 1.53 times higher than those of a DSC with a CDCA co-adsorbent, respectively. On the other hand, DTF-C6, possessing a typical V-shaped conformation with a flare angle of 120.6°, needed to co-adsorb with CDCA to fill the vacant sites between the dye aggregates on the TiO2 surface, with the aim of reducing current loss and suppressing electron recombination. Compared to a DSC with pristine DTF-C6 aggregation, an example based on the co-adsorbed system dramatically raised the PCE from 5.50% to 9.04%, owing to the improved Jsc and open-circuit voltage values. This work presents a perspective for the rational regulation of molecular shapes and the dye aggregation of organic dyes for highly efficient DSCs.
Introduction
Converting solar energy into electricity through photovoltaic (PV) technology has attracted huge attention with respect to tackling the issues of environmental pollution and the shortage of fossil fuel supplies.1–3 Among the emerging PV technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have shown promising prospects due to their advanced features, such as handy device fabrication, environmental friendliness, low production costs and interesting performance under indoor conditions with low-intensity light.4–7 To improve the performance of DSCs, enormous efforts with regards to sensitizing dye innovation and device engineering have been made worldwide by researchers.8–12 Recently, donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A)-type organic dyes have exhibited merits in promoting the performance of DSCs, including demonstrating flexibility in molecular design, high molar extinction coefficients and favourable charge injection from dyes to the photonanode.13–16 For example, through employing N-annulated perylene as the donor building blocks for DSCs, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 12% was realized by Wang's group.17 Through collaborative sensitization with carbazole and triphenylamine based D–π–A dyes, a recorded PCE of 14.3% was realized by Yano and Hanaya's group.18 In addition to the mostly used arylamine derivative sensitizing dyes, our group also found that dithiafulvene based D–π–A dyes could be effective sensitizers for high-performance DSCs, owing to their excellent electron-donation characteristics and more concise synthesis.19–23
To date, studies have found there are two primary means for realizing high PCEs in DSCs; one is enhancing the short-circuit density (Jsc) and the other is improving the open-circuit voltage (Voc).24–29 In principle, Jsc can be enhanced by broadening the absorption spectra of dyes via strengthening the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect through suitable molecular engineering.30–33 Thereby, various enlarged conjugations of D–π–A organic dyes with different shapes have been studied. However, larger conjugated frameworks are susceptible to dye-aggregation after absorbing on the surface of TiO2, and this may lead to vacant sites between the dye aggregates. In this case, Voc would be decreased due to adverse electron recombination, and current loss has even been found due to limited charge transfer and injection.34–38 To tackle this issue, researchers have resorted to introducing co-adsorbents, e.g., chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA),39–41 into the vacant sites on the TiO2 surface or designing organic dyes with large steric hindrance (e.g., star-shaped dyes).42–45 However, some organic dyes with reduced steric hindrance, which are more prone to form aggregates, have also been reported to yield high efficiencies in DSCs without using coadsorbents.46,47 These results indicate that the molecular shapes of organic dyes and how they aggregate exert great influence on DSC performance. However, systematic studies on the relationship between molecular conformations and dye aggregation in a one dye system, to maximize the performance of DSCs, remain relatively rare.
In this research, two D–π–A dithiafulvene-based organic sensitizers with the same electron donor and acceptor units but differing in the flare angles induced by the π-bridges were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1). DTF-C5, with a phenyl-thiophene-phenyl π-bridge, and DTF-C6, with a phenyl-phenoxazine-phenyl π-bridge, show similar absorption spectra in solution, which is beneficial for evaluating the effects of molecular shapes and dye aggregation on DSC performance. The influence of their CDCA co-adsorption-dependent aggregation on the TiO2 surface on the performance of DSCs was investigated. A DSC fabricated with pristine DTF-C5 displayed a far higher PCE (7.39%) than a DSC with a CDCA co-adsorbent due to the compact arrangement of the sensitizers. Interestingly, for a typical V-shaped molecule with a reduced flare angle, a DTF-C6-based DSC achieved a dramatically increased PCE of 9.04% with the co-adsorption of CDCA covering the vacant sites between dye aggregates on the TiO2 surface.

Experimental section
Materials and reagents
All solvents and reagents, unless otherwise stated, were of the purest quality and used as received. Phenoxazine, 1-bromobutane, 4-formylphenylboronic acid, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4), N-bromosuccinimide, 2,5-dibromothiophene, and 2-cyanoacetic acid were purchased from Energy Chemical Ltd. FTO conductive glass (sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1, Nippon Sheet Glass) was used.
Characterization
NMR spectra (1H and 13C) measurements were carried out using a Bruker 600 spectrometer at 600 MHz for 1H NMR and 151 MHz for 13C NMR using d-chloroform or d-DMSO, respectively, as solvents. Data are listed in parts per million (ppm) on the delta scale (δ) and coupling constants are reported in Hz. The splitting patterns were designated as follows: s (singlet); d (doublet); t (triplet); q (quartet); m (multiplet) and br (broad). UV-vis absorption spectra of dyes in solution and loaded on TiO2 film were measured with a HITIACH U-3900 spectrometer at room temperature. Photoluminescent (PL) spectra were recorded using a Horiba Fluoromax 4 spectrometer in diluted THF solution (1 × 10−5 M). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves from dyes were recorded using a CHI600E electrochemical analyzer at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The oxidation potential of the sensitizer was measured in DMF with tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (0.1 M) as the electrolyte, glassy carbon as the working electrode, Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode, and Pt as the counter electrode. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated with Fc/Fc+ as an internal reference and converted to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) values via the addition of 630 mV.
DSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
The preparation of DSC photoanodes and electrolytes was carried out following the previous literature.12 In cell assembly, for the non-coadsorbent devices, DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 were loaded onto TiO2 (∼12 μm thick) film via immersion into tetrahydrofuran (THF) dye solutions (0.2 mM dye) without the use of CDCA for 24 h at room temperature, respectively. For the coadsorbent based devices, DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 were loaded onto TiO2 (∼12 μm thick) film via immersion into THF dye solutions (0.5 mM dye) with CDCA (10 mM) for 24 h at room temperature, respectively. Before drying under vacuum, the films were rinsed with acetonitrile multiple times to remove unabsorbed sensitizers until the solution became clear. Then, the films were assembled into a solar cell together with a Pt–sputtered FTO counter electrode and acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15 volume ratio) electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine. The active area of the photoanode film for DSC performance tests was typically 0.25 cm−2.
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves were measured with a Newport PVIV-3A system. The light source (Oriel solar simulator, 450 W Xe lamp, AM 1.5 global filter) was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2). The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured at varying wavelengths (350–750 nm) with an interval of 5 nm. Nyquist spectroscopy data was gathered on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under an intensity modulated (5–70 W m−2) light emitting diode (525 nm) driven by a Zahner (PP211) source supply. The frequency range was set from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 follows a previously reported strategy, as shown in Scheme 1.35 The bromination of compound A with NBS produced the brominated phenoxazine derivative B. Compound C2 was obtained via the Suzuki reaction of 4-formylphenylboronic acid with B. Compounds C1 and C2 were then subjected to phosphite-induced Horner-Wittig condensation with ODT to produce the key intermediates D1 and D2. Finally, the π-extended DTF-bearing aldehydes D1 and D2 were, respectively, reacted with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine via the Knoevenagel reaction to give the target sensitizer compounds DTF-C5 and DTF-C6. The chemical structures of DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 were fully characterized via1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. Both DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene.

Theoretical calculations
To understand the shapes of the two sensitizers, molecular geometries were first evaluated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level, using a methyl-substituted molecule as the model compound. It was found that DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 adopted shapes distinct from each other due to the different π-bridges, as shown in Fig. 2a. The molecule DTF-C5, whose π-bridge incorporated two phenyl groups substituted at the 2- and 5-positions of the thiophene unit, possessed a larger flare angle of 150.6° between the donor and acceptor units. On the other hand, the molecule DTF-C6, whose π-bridge incorporated two phenyl groups substituted at the 3- and 7-positions of the phenoxazine unit, possessed a typical V-shaped conformation with a smaller flare angle of 120.6°. These results indicate that DTF-C5 molecules may tend to form more ordered and compact dye aggregates in the solid state compared to DTF-C6 molecules.

In order to understand the photo-induced charge separation of DTF-C5 and DTF-C6, DFT calculations were performed relating to the electron-density distribution of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the two sensitizers. As shown in Fig. 2b, the HOMO electron density is mainly located on the dithiafulvenyl donor part, while the electron density of the LUMO is transferred to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor part. It has been demonstrated that cyanoacrylic acid is predominantly adsorbed onto TiO2 by forming a strong bidentate bridging linkage with Brønsted acid sites on the TiO2 surface. Therefore, upon photo-excitation, the HOMO–LUMO excitation can efficiently transfer electrons from the donor part to the acceptor part anchored on TiO2, which is desirable for the required charge separation in DSCs.
UV-vis absorption and electrochemical characterization
The UV-vis absorption spectra of DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 in dilute THF solution are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The corresponding spectroscopic parameters extracted are summarized in Table 1. The two sensitizers exhibit a strong absorption band in the range of 400–450 nm, which can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor. The absorption maximum (λmax) was observed at 429 nm (molar extinction coefficient ε = 3.90 × 104 M−1 cm−1) for DTF-C5 and 431 nm (ε = 3.10 × 104 M−1 cm−1) for DTF-C6. The small bathochromic shift of λmax and the absorption onset of DTF-C6 can be attributed to the more electron-rich character of the phenoxazine moiety compared to thiophene.

In comparison with their absorption spectra in THF solution, the absorption spectra of TiO2 films (4 μm) loaded with these sensitizers show dramatically broadened and red-shifted absorption, as shown in Fig. 3c. These observations can be attributed to the formation of aggregates of these sensitizers on the TiO2 surfaces, such as J-aggregates. It was also found that the broadened absorption band and the red-shifted absorption onset of about 100 nm for the thin film should afford increased light harvesting.
The molecular orbital energy levels of DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 were derived from CV (Fig. 3d) data in combination with the excitation transition energies (E0–0), which were determined from the intersections of the absorption and photoluminescence spectra (Fig. 3a and b) and are presented in Table 1. The first oxidation potential (Eox) values of the ground states of DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 correspond to their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. The Eox values of DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 were 0.86 V and 0.93 V, corresponding to HOMO levels of −5.26 eV and −5.73 eV, respectively. Obviously, the HOMO levels of the two sensitizers are more positive than the iodide/triiodide couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating the thermodynamically downhill regeneration of the photo-oxidized sensitizers through accepting electrons from surrounding I− ions. The lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO) energy levels of DTF-C5 (−1.63 V) and DTF-C6 (−1.49 V), calculated as Eox − E0–0, are sufficiently negative relative to the conduction-band edge of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), ensuring an efficient thermodynamic driving force for electron injection.
Photovoltaic performance
In order to evaluate a strategy to maximize the performance of DSCs based on organic dyes with different molecular shapes, devices based on DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 absorbed on TiO2 films with and without CDCA were investigated. The cells were investigated under irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (simulated AM 1.5G sunlight) and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4a, the best DSC based on pristine DTF-C5 exhibited Jsc and Voc values of 14.92 mA cm−2 and 759 mV, respectively, combined with a fill factor (FF) of 0.65, leading to a high PCE of 7.39%. In contrast, DSCs based on DTF-C5 co-adsorbed with CDCA (10 mM) presented a dramatically decreased PCE of 4.8%, which can be mainly attributed to the decreased Jsc and FF values (Jsc = 10.04 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.61). From Table 2, it could be found that the absorbed amount of pristine DTF-C5 in the non-coadsorbent device is higher than in the CDCA co-adsorbed cell. This result indicates that DTF-C5, which adopts a large flare angle and looks like a nearly-linear molecule to some extent, tends to form more ordered and compact aggregates from pristine dye molecules on TiO2 film. Therefore, compared to the pristine DTF-C5 based DSC, the DSC based on DTF-C5 co-adsorbed with CDCA exhibited lower Jsc and PCE values due to the competitive adsorbing of CDCA. However, such results were quite different from the case of the DSCs based on DTF-C6, which possesses a reduced flare angle. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the DSC based on pristine DTF-C6 shows a moderate PCE of 5.5%, with a Jsc value of 12.44 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 710 mV and a FF of 0.62. In comparison with the pristine DTF-C5 based DSC, the decreased Jsc value for the pristine DTF-C6 based DSC are counter to the absorption data shown in Fig. 3. However, after co-adsorbing CDCA (10 mM) with DTF-C6 on the TiO2 surface, the resulting DSC shows a dramatically raised PCE of 9.04%, accompanied by higher Jsc and Voc values (Jsc = 15.76 mA cm−2 and Voc = 790 mV). Considering that the absorbed amount of DTF-C6 co-adsorbed with CDCA is lower than that absorbed in pristine DTF-C6 based cells (Table 2), it is suggested that the dye-aggregated motifs of pristine DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 are different from each other on the TiO2 surface. There may be more vacant sites on the TiO2 surface between the DTF-C6 aggregates. This is because DTF-C6 adopts a relatively smaller flare angle and more twisted molecular structure, which suppresses the formation of compact dye-aggregates. To this end, the maximum performance of DTF-C6 based DSCs cannot be achieved. Therefore, co-adsorbing with CDCA is necessary for DTF-C6 to maximize the DSC performance, as the inhomogeneous distribution of the dye aggregates throughout the TiO2 surface would lead to current loss and adverse electron recombination. It was noted that the absorbed amounts of dye followed the order: pristine dye absorption > CDCA co-adsorption. However, the Jsc values of the DSCs decrease in the order: DTF-C6 co-adsorbed with CDCA > pristine DTF-C5 > pristine DTF-C6 > DTF-C5 co-adsorbed with CDCA. This result clearly indicates that the reasonable regulation of molecular shapes and aggregation on TiO2 are important issues to maximum the performance of DSCs.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra shown in Fig. 4 confirm the trend of Jsc variation. Compared to the DSC based on DTF-C5 co-adsorbed with CDCA, which exhibits narrowly distributed and relatively low IPCE values (slightly higher than 60%), the DSC based on pristine DTF-C5 exhibits remarkably broadly distributed and increased IPCE values (with values reaching 90%) in spectra that cover the visible region. In the case of DTF-C6, however, the DSC based on DTF-C6 co-adsorbed with CDCA gives more broadly distributed and higher IPCE values (with values over 95%) than the pristine DTF-C6 based DSC. Taking the absorbed amounts of dye and molecular shape together, these differences in IPCE show that pristine compact dye aggregates of DTF-C5, with a large flare angle, on TiO2 films lead to enhanced light absorption capabilities and charge carrier injection, thus raising Jsc. On the other hand, the typical V-shaped DTF-C6, which possesses a reduced flare angle, needs the addition of CDCA to fill up the vacant sites between dye aggregates on the surface of TiO2 and reduce the current loss.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
To further elucidate the photovoltaic results and display more dynamic information regarding the interfacial charge transfer process in DSCs sensitized through DTF-C5 and DTF-C6 absorbed on TiO2 films with and without CDCA, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark under a forward bias of 0.6 V, with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. Generally, Rrec, corresponding to the larger semicircle, is related to the charge recombination rate between the TiO2 film and the electrolyte. In principle, a larger Rrec value indicates slower charge recombination, thus giving a higher Voc value. Nyquist plots for the DSCs based on sensitizers with or without a CDCA co-adsorbent are displayed in Fig. 5. In the case of DTF-C5, the Rrec values trend in the order: pristine DTF-C5 > DTF-C5 co-adsorbed with CDCA, while the trend for DTF-C6 is: DTF-C6 co-adsorbed with CDCA > DTF-C6. These results are in good agreement with the Voc values of the DSCs according to Table 2. Based on this, it can be suggested that the compact dye aggregates in DTF-C5 form a thick dye layer, thus preventing redox electron acceptors from approaching TiO2 efficiently; however, the vacant sites between the dye aggregates of DTF-C6 need the presence of CDCA to eliminate adverse charge recombination.

Conclusions
In summary, two dithiafulvene-based sensitizers, DTF-C5 and DTF-C6, differing in molecular shape have been developed to study the relationship between molecular shape and dye aggregation in a one dye system for maximizing the performance of DSCs. Our results demonstrate that the sensitizer DTF-C5, with a larger flare angle between the donor and acceptor units, tends to form compact dye aggregates on the TiO2 surface without decreasing the amount of absorbed dye, passivating the surface to reduce electron recombination and ensure optimized Jsc and Voc values. For the typical V-shaped sensitizer DTF-C6 with a reduced flare angle, it is necessary to introduce a CDCA co-adsorbent to fill the vacant sites between the dye aggregates to reduce current loss and electron recombination. As a result, a DSC with a PCE of 7.39% was obtained for pristine DTF-C5 based devices. With a little bathochromic absorption, an impressive PCE of 9.04% was realized in a DSC with DTF-C6 co-adsorbed with CDCA. The primary findings give insights into obtaining maximum DSC performance based on the different shapes of organic sensitizers.
