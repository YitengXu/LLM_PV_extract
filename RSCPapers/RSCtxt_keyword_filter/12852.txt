    , Accepted 16th March 2020First published on 17th March 2020AbstractEnergy transfer between the exciplex host and fluorescent guest is a demanding process for attaining high-performance organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), particularly in the near-infrared (NIR) region, and insight into the dynamics of energy transfer has been elusive. In this study, new deep-red/NIR chromophores, NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA where NOz and TPA denote naphthobisoxadiazole and triphenylamine, respectively, have been developed with an electron donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) configuration. The optimized 1 wt% doped films for NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA blended with the Tris-PCz:CN-T2T (1:1 in molar ratio) exciplex host showed similar deep red/NIR emissions with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of 42 (680 nm) and 28%, (709 nm), respectively. Comprehensive time-resolved measurements and dynamics analyses revealed significant differences in the energy transfer pathways, i.e. Förster versus Dexter-type energy transfer between the exciplex host and the fluorescent guest, in which the introduction of bulky tert-butyl groups in the NOz-t-TPA doped film greatly suppressed the Dexter-type energy transfer pathway. Despite the lower PLQY, the analytical simulation predicted NOz-t-TPA to be a better candidate for realizing highly efficient electroluminescence. Confirmation was provided by the performance of the NOz-t-TPA-doped OLED, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.6% with peak wavelength at 710 nm, which is among the best records for the metal-free NIR OLEDs around 710 nm. Insight into energy transfer pathways thus plays a pivotal role in achieving the high-performance OLEDs that incorporate the exciplex host and fluorescent guest.
Introduction
Since the first demonstration by Tang and VanSlyke in 1987, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted worldwide attention.1 With decades of effort, the research and development of OLEDs has gained significant improvement in the fields of display panels and light sources.2–4 Recently, it was recognized that the energy transfer between an exciplex host and regular fluorescent guest provides a facile means for promoting OLED performance.5–7 In this approach, the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) exciplex material serves as a host to harvest both the singlet and triplet populations, followed by a Förster-type energy transfer (FRET) to the fluorescent guest. As such, the upper-limit of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of conventional fluorescent devices can be overcome. This strategy provides three-fold benefits. First, the pure metal-free fluorescent devices have the advantage of lower cost as compared to the heavy-metal-based devices. Second, the small concentration used for the fluorescent dopants may minimize the serious decrease in the EQE under high current density, i.e. a roll-off process, while this phenomenon is commonly observed among phosphorescence devices due to triplet–triplet and/or triplet-polaron annihilation.8 Third, the fine-tuning of the spectral range of the device can be easily achieved by varying the suitable combination of the exciplex host and fluorescence dopants. The use of exciplex for the energy transfer materials also features its ability to facilitate synthesis and versatility in wide tuning the emission region as compared with intramolecular TADF molecules. The promotion of the OLEDs’ performance in different spectral windows can thus be achieved with straightforward design.6 Nevertheless, the Dexter-type energy transfer (DET), which transfers the energy from the triplet state of host TADF material to the triplet state of the fluorescent guest, should be avoided as much as possible.9 Surprisingly, detailed discussions on energy transfer have remained elusive.
In yet another approach, near-infrared (NIR) OLEDs have shown great perspective in optical communication,10 phototherapy,11 night-vision technologies,12 and sensors.13–15 Many research teams have pursued the boosting of the performance of deep-red/NIR OLEDs,16–25 for which the efficiency is generally low since the deep-red/NIR emission intensities are limited by the energy gap law.26,27 The heavy-metal based devices such as Pt-based porphyrin complexes generally show remarkable EQE within the NIR region28 but have serious roll-off (vide supra). On the other hand, a number of organic molecules possessing TADF in the red and NIR region were reported to have highly efficient NIR OLEDs.17,18,29–31 However, the design and synthesis of NIR emitters having TADF properties is nontrivial and presents a great challenge, which may hamper their further advances. The quest for highly efficient NIR OLEDs with a straightforward design is thus urgent. In this regard, the aforementioned energy-transfer strategy from the exciplex host to the NIR fluorescent dopants provides an alternative opportunity. In this approach, the design of deep red/NIR organic dyes may be accessed via extending the planar π-conjugation so that the delocalization of the π-electron can narrow the energy gap, while the rigid planar structures can suppress the rotational disorder and thus decrease the non-radiative relaxation process.32 Combined with exciplex material possessing green-yellow emission, the NIR emission can be reached by a variety of organic fluorescence materials endowed with electron donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) architectures through FRET.17,33–36
Herein, we present two new deep red/NIR chromophores NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA (Scheme 1), where NOz and TPA denote naphthobisoxadiazole and triphenylamine, respectively, configured with an electron donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure. NOz belongs to the category of naphthobischalcogenadiazole (NXz). NXz is a tetracyclic heteroaromatic ring and has been utilized in the field of solar cells as the acceptor unit in semiconducting polymers,37–40 affording low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and rigid planar structures. In 2014, Michiaki et al. synthesized naphthobisthiadiazole (NTz)-based highly emissive red dyes.41 Compared with NTz, naphthobisoxadiazole (NOz), in which the sulfur atom of NTz is substituted by oxygen, is expected to reach an even lower LUMO due to the stronger withdrawing-ability of oxygen, narrowing the energy gap to the NIR region.37 None of the D–A–D emitters based on NOz as the acceptor have, so far, been developed.

In this study, we strived to attain high-performance NIR OLEDs based on the energy transfer methodology between the exciplex host and NOz-TPA (or NOz-t-TPA) fluorescent guest. More importantly, we made comprehensive time-resolved measurements and dynamics analyses to gain insight into the energy transfer pathways. Despite the structural similarity between NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA, surprisingly, they have significant differences in energy transfer pathways, i.e. the Förster versus Dexter-type energy transfer. Despite the lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for NOz-t-TPA doped in a host matrix, analytical simulation based on relaxation dynamics predicted its better electroluminescence yield due to the much suppressed DET. Affirmation was provided by the high performance of NOz-t-TPA-doped OLED, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.6% with peak wavelength at 710 nm. The agreement between the analytical approach and the performance of the fabricated OLEDs sheds light on the mechanism to ascertain high-performance NIR OLEDs via energy transfer. Details are provided in the results and discussion section.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic pathways for NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA are depicted in Scheme 1. In brief, 5,10-dibromonaphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]oxadiazole (DiBr-NOz) was synthesized by following the procedure described in the literature,37 and was then used to prepare the designated compound NOz-TPAvia Suzuki coupling and the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction. Compound 3, which is one of the starting materials of NOz-t-TPA, was synthesized from the commercially available reagent bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amine (1). Compound 1 was then reacted with 1,4-dibromobenzene to yield 2 through the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction. Borylation of 2 with bis(pinacolato)diboron gave 3, which was used to prepare the designated compound NOz-t-TPAvia Suzuki coupling by reacting with DiBr-NOz as outlined in previous steps (vide supra). Details of the synthetic routes are provided in the ESI.†
All synthesized compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The corresponding crystal and packing structures obtained from X-ray structural analysis are shown in Fig. 1. The packing mode of NOz-TPA exhibited relatively close intermolecular distances, which were around 3.4 Å as measured from the centroid of the acceptor to the plane made by the neighboring acceptor. This relatively close intermolecular distance may lead to slight intermolecular interactions and result in a spectral shift from the solution to the solid phase (vide infra). Unfortunately, attempts to grow single crystals of NOz-t-TPA were not successful, due perhaps to the involvement of bulky donor moieties. Nevertheless, it may be safe to expect that NOz-t-TPA has a similar but less ordered architecture as compared to NOz-TPA because of the bulky t-TPA group. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded on a TA Q500 under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The temperature of 5% weight loss (Td) was at 362 °C for both NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA. The high thermal decomposition temperatures revealed their good thermal stability.

Photophysical properties
The UV/Vis absorption and emission spectra of the title compounds in various solvents are recorded in Fig. 2(a), and Table 1 (detailed data are listed in Table S1, ESI†). The lowest-lying absorption band of NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA with absorption peaks at 548 and 570 nm, respectively, are ascribed to the ππ* transition mixed with donor-to-acceptor charge transfer (CT) character. This statement is supported by their high extinction coefficients (ε) of >104 M−1 cm−1 at peak wavelength and the computational approach based on the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT, cam-B3LYP hybrid function, see ESI† for computational details).42 As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO for the title compounds are all mainly located on the donors (TPA, t-TPA) and acceptor (NOz), respectively, which manifest an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donors (t-TPA, TPA) to the acceptor (NOz). In addition to the ICT event, the central acceptor shows some ππ* transition character with obvious overlap between the HOMO and LUMO on the six-membered aromatic rings. Therefore, the introduction of such acceptors provides strong electron-withdrawing character and thus the elongation of the π-electron delocalization, enhancing the optical transition probability. The replacement of TPA with t-TPA further enhanced the electron-donating strength compared to NOz-TPA, leading to the increase in the HOMO energy and hence the decrease in the absorption energy gap. The emission spectra of the title compounds were red shifted as the polarity of the solvents increased, showing positive solvatochromism. For example, in dichloromethane (DCM), the emission peak wavelength of both title compounds shifted to the NIR region, with the emission peak wavelength of NOz-t-TPA (800 nm) > NOz-TPA (746 nm). Remarkably, the QY of both NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA were measured to be 40% and 35%, respectively, for 653 nm and 675 nm emissions in toluene.

In the solid neat film, shown in Fig. 2(b), both absorption and emission bands of NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA were red shifted as compared with those observed in toluene. Due to the lack of fast environment relaxation in solid, such a red shift manifests the influence of static intermolecular interactions, in part, in the solid state. Importantly, the emission bands for NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA in the solid neat film have reached the NIR range with peak wavelengths at 730 and 750 nm, and retaining good QY of 22% and 6.8%, respectively. We then measured the population lifetimes of title compounds in the selected solvents and neat films (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) with pertinent data listed in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†). In all cases, the population lifetime of title compounds fitted well with exponential decay in the nanosecond range, implying their fluorescence nature. These, together with the measured QY data, led us to deduce the corresponding radiative rates (kr), which all exhibited a fast radiative rate of around ∼108 s−1 (Table 1), clearly suggesting an efficient optical transition between the lowest singlet excited state (S1) and the ground state (S0).
In light of the high transition moment and excellent fluorescence yield in NIR for title compounds, we investigated their PL performance in a host–guest system. The exciplex was chosen as the cohost to realize high-efficiency OLEDs via energy transfer.43 The exciplex was formed with charge-transfer characteristics between electron-donating and electron-accepting molecules, which showed intrinsically small ΔEST due to the suppression of the electron correlation energy and allowed the triplet excitons to up-convert to their singlet state by a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. The singlet excitons of the exciplex cohost could transfer directly to the singlet state of the fluorescent dopants via the FRET pathway.5 Additionally, to suppress the possibility of undesired Dexter processes that deplete the triplet state, the concentration of dopants needed to be at a suitably low level to maintain an effective long-range singlet–singlet energy transfer in the system.
Here, we selected the highly efficient delayed fluorescent exciplex of 9,9′,9′′-triphenyl-9H,9′H,9′′H-3,3′:6′,3′′-tercarbazole (Tris-PCz):44 3′,3′′′,3′′′′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(([1,1′-biphenyl]-3-carbonitrile)) (CN-T2T)45 in a 1:1 weight ratio as the cohost (Fig. 3(a)). The Tris-PCz:CN-T2T (1:1) exciplex emission showed a high ΦPL of 0.53 and a small ΔEST = 0.59 kcal mole−1, which led to a highly efficient green exciplex OLED with EQE of 11.9%.6 To realize an effective FRET, spectral overlap between the emission of the host (energy donor) and the absorption of the dopant (energy acceptor) is required.46Fig. 3(b) displays the region of overlap between the absorption spectra of the dopants and the PL spectrum of Tris-PCz:CN-T2T, which allows efficient energy transfer from the exciplex to the dopants. Fig. 3(c and d) shows the absorption and emission spectra of the doped films in various doping concentrations represented by weight percentage (wt%) versus the host. For the doping concentration of 1 wt%, the first absorption band (located around 550–600 nm), as well as the highly energetic absorption band (300–400 nm) of dopants (NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA), could not be measured (absorbance < 0.005). Therefore, the corresponding emission spectra in Fig. 3(c and d), excited at 310 nm, unambiguously resulted from the energy transfer from the exciplex host. Compared with the NOz-TPA 1 wt% doped film (Fig. 3c), the NOz-t-TPA 1 wt% doped film had obvious residual emission from the exciplex at ∼500 nm (Fig. 3d), suggesting its lower efficiency in energy transfer. This observation can be rationalized qualitatively by the smaller spectral overlap between the PL spectrum of the exciplex and the absorption spectrum of NOz-t-TPA (Fig. 3(b)). The photophysical properties of the doped films are given in Table 2. The PLQY of 1 wt% doped films (Tris-PCz:CN-T2T:dopant (1 wt%)) were measured to be 42 and 28% for NOz-TPA (680 nm emission) and NOz-t-TPA (709 nm emission), respectively.

To acquire the preliminary information of parameters that correspond to the energy transfer inside the doping system, we conducted lifetime measurements with a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system incorporating a 0.82 MHz femtosecond laser (180 fs pulse duration) and multichannel plate as the pump pulse and detecting system, respectively, so that a temporal resolution of as short as 20 ps can be obtained. The population decays of the emissions of the NOz-t-TPA and NOz-TPA 1 wt% doped film are shown in Fig. 4(a) and Table 2. The corresponding decay curves were well fitted to two single-exponential components, 9.30 and 252 ns for NOz-t-TPA (monitored at 690 nm), and 10.8 and 131 ns for NOz-TPA (monitored at 670 nm), denoted as prompt and delayed fluorescence decay. These results suggest the TADF characteristics for both emissions from NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA due to the energy transfer from TADF of exciplex in the doped film. To gain more insight, the early fast energy transfer dynamic was also probed and the results of the rise component shown in Fig. 4(b) clearly indicate that the NOz-t-TPA and NOz-TPA emissions consist of a rise time of 893 ps and 692 ps, respectively. The time-resolved measurements for other doping concentrations were also conducted with data shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Table 2. Firstly, under identical experimental conditions, as shown in Fig. 4(a), the delayed component of the NOz-TPA-doped film is nearly two folds shorter than that of the NOz-t-TPA-doped film. Secondly, the slightly faster rise time for the emission of NOz-TPA (cf.NOz-t-TPA) suggests a faster energy transfer rate between the exciplex host and NOz-TPA. Both observations significantly influence their performance in OLEDs. Detailed quantitative analyses are given below.

Analysis of energy transfer dynamics
For clarity, we first probed the dynamics of the formation of the exciplex between Tris-PCz and CN-T2T for the host. The results shown in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†) indicate that upon 357 nm excitation (repetition rate of 82 kHz and pulse duration time of 180 fs) and monitoring exciplex emission at 500 nm, the rise time is irresolvable (<20 ps). Since the time constant for the formation of the exciplex is much faster than all other kinetic parameters, the exciplex singlet CT state (S*(CT)) can be assumed to be populated instantaneously at t = 0, prior to any energy transfer processes. On this basis, we tentatively propose the energy transfer mechanism depicted in Fig. 5(b), which incorporates the transfer of energy from the TADF exciplex S*(CT) state and triplet T*(CT) state to the fluorescent dopant in the singlet (DS*) and triplet (DT*) manifolds. For the convenience of kinetic derivation, we simplified S*(CT) and T*(CT) to S* and T*, respectively, in the subsequent text. This proposed energy transfer mechanism is commonly adopted but has never been rigorously validated quantitatively, especially the competitive S* → DS* and T* → DT* processes, which are interplayed due to the thermally accessible process between and S* and T* reversibly because of their origin from the TADF host. The mechanism depicted in Fig. 5(b) is utilized to fit the experimental data obtained in this study. Prior to the subsequent fitting process, we fully deconvoluted the measured population lifetime with the instrumental response function (IRF), eliminating the broadening effect. For the detailed deconvolution process, please see Simulative approach in ESI.† We first attempted to fit the population evolution of the pure TADF host (Tris-PCz:CN-T2T) with the following equations: (1) (2)Here, kf and kp denote the observed decay rates of fluorescence and phosphorescence, respectively. kisc and krisc represent the intersystem crossing and reverse intersystem crossing rate constants, respectively, of the exciplex. We initially guessed kisc, krsic, kf, and kp to be (21.9 ns)−1, (357 ns)−1, (1 μs)−1, and (10 μs)−1, respectively, according to the previous work that assumed the pre-equilibrium between the exciplex CT S1 and T1 states.6 These parameters were fitted iteratively with one parameter free to fit. As a result, we obtained the best fit shown in Fig. S5(a) (ESI†) after several loops of adjustment for the parameters. kisc, krisc, kp, and kf were fitted to be (20.1 ns)−1, (333 ns)−1, (4.98 μs)−1, and (327 ns)−1, respectively. We then plugged all parameters into eqn (1) and (2) to calculate the prompt and delayed decay rates. The results of (17.9 ns)−1 and (2.82 μs)−1 for prompt and delayed fluorescence, respectively (Fig. S5(b) (ESI†) and eqn (3) below) are close to the experimental values of (20.8 ns)−1 and (2.69 μs)−1 (see Fig. S4(b), ESI†). (3)
 Fig. 5  The proposed kinetic model for the energy transfer process between the exciplex host and the fluorescent dopants in (a) Tris-PCz:CN-T2T and (b) Tris-PCz:CN-T2T:1 wt% dopant (blue print for NOz-TPA and red print for NOz-t-TPA) solid thin film. kCT is the rate of the formation of the singlet CT state S*(CT) from localized excited state S*(LE); kf and kp are the population decay rate constants for the S*(CT) and triplet T*(CT) states of the exciplex (Tris-PCz:CN-T2T); kisc and krisc are intersystem crossing and reverse intersystem crossing rate constants, respectively. kFE is the FRET rate constant from the exciplex S*(CT) to the singlet state of dopant DS*, and kDE is the DET rate constant from the exciplex T*(CT) to the triplet states of dopant DT*. kdf and kdp are the population decay rate constants of DS* and DT*, respectively. 
For the convenience of discussion, all fitted parameters are shown in Fig. 5(a). These deduced TADF kinetic parameters were then applied as the initial estimated values for the photoluminescence data of the Tris-PCz:CN-T2T:1 wt% dopant (NOz-TPA, NOz-t-TPA) solid thin film incorporating the energy transfer model shown in Fig. 5(b). Under the assumption of low doping concentration (1 wt% doped films), the direct excitation of the dopants can be neglected (vide supra). Hence, the decay process of each excited species can be expressed as follows: (4) (5) (6) (7)The parameters kdf and kdp denote the observed decay rate of the dopant's fluorescence and phosphorescence, respectively; kFE and kDE represent the rate constant of FRET and DET, respectively. Due to the ππ* character and hence the large ΔEST between DS* and DT*, it is reasonable to assume the trivial efficiency of intersystem crossing and that the decay of DT* does not influence the population evolution of DS*. Therefore, kdt can be fixed as a small constant, which was reasonably set to be (10 μs)−1.
We initially estimated the TADF associated parameters kisc, krisc, kf, and kp to be (20.1 ns)−1, (333 ns)−1, (327 ns)−1 and (4.98 μs)−1, respectively, for the following fit. The dopant-related parameters, kdf and kFE of 1 wt% NOz-t-TPA were initially estimated to be (9.30 ns)−1, and (893 ps)−1, respectively, from its experimental prompt and rise lifetime, while for NOz-TPA, kdf and kFE were initially estimated to be (10.8 ns)−1 and (692 ps)−1, respectively. As for the kDE of both emitters, we initially guessed them to be (1 μs)−1 according to the literature.47 The fitting process was separated into two parts, one for the rise component and the other for the prompt-delay component with the same parameters. Through the iterative fitting process, the best fits to the time-evolution of DS* for both NOz-t-TPA and NOz-TPA 1 wt% doped in the Tris-PCz:CN-T2T film are depicted in Fig. 6(a, c) and (b, d), respectively. Detailed fitting parameters for all rate constants are tabulated in Table S3 (ESI†). For the system with NOz-t-TPA as dopant, the associated rate constants for kFE (FRET) and kDE (DET) were thus determined to be (1.05 ns)−1 and (26.0 μs)−1, respectively, while they were (0.77 ns)−1 and (0.43 μs)−1, respectively, for NOz-TPA as the dopant. The resulting faster rate of kFE (FRET) for NOz-TPA is consistent with the greater spectral overlap between the PL spectrum of the exciplex and the absorption spectrum of NOz-TPA (vide supra, see Fig. 3(b)), supporting the validity of the fitted kFE parameters in terms of physical meaning. The analyses also indicate that the rate of the Dexter-type energy transfer kDE (DET) for NOz-t-TPA is ∼60 times slower than that for NOz-TPA doped in the Tris-PCz:CN-T2T film. This resulted in the longer delayed component for NOz-t-TPA (cf.NOz-TPA, see Fig. 4(a)). From the viewpoint of the chemical structure, the hindrance in the DET in NOz-t-TPA can be rationalized by the distance between the exciplexes and the core of the dopant chromophore, i.e., NOz-t-TPA, because of four peripheral bulky tert-butyl groups anchored to the TPA moiety.
 Fig. 6  Model fitting of the population decay curve of (a and c) Tris-PCz:CN-T2T:1 wt% NOz-t-TPA and (b and d) Tris-PCz:CN-T2T:1 wt% NOz-TPA with a rise component (a and b) and prompt-delayed component (c and d). The circles represent the experimental data of two doped films acquired from TCSPC measurements at room temperature. Red lines represent the fitting results for the population curves. 
Based on all the fitted parameters in Table S3 (ESI†), the analytical solutions of DS*(t) for both NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA are shown in eqn (8) and (9) and their simulated curves are shown in Fig. 7(a), where DS*(t = 0) was normalized to be unity. Note that in this simulation a fourth exponential term originating from the decay of triplet state, DT* is omitted because of the forbidden transition. The simulated rise, prompt, and delayed lifetimes match the experimentally fitted parameters shown in Table 2. However, these parameters are now endowed with a physical meaning. (8) (9)
 Fig. 7  Simulated population decay of Tris-PCz:CN-T2T:dopant (1 wt%) under (a) PL and (b) EL. 
To compare the relatively steady-state PL intensity between the doped films of NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA, we then integrated the simulated population curves from t = 0 to 1 s, followed by multiplication with the corresponding kr to simulate the fluorescence intensity. Here, we assume that the dopants in the dilute concentration of 1 wt% should possess similar radiative behavior to that in toluene. Hence, we choose kr measured in toluene as parameters, which were 8.81 × 107 and 7.62 × 107 s−1 for NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA, respectively. As a result, the PL intensity (I) ratio (INOz-t-TPA/INOz-TPA) was deduced to be 0.79, consistent with the lower QY (28%) for NOz-t-TPA (cf. 42% for NOz-TPA).
Based on the simulation protocol we then made attempts to estimate the relative electroluminescence (EL) intensity. In this approach, the initial conditions S*(0) and T*(0) were reset to be statistically 1 and 3, respectively, in eqn (4) and (5) to generate the population curves for NOz-t-TPA and NOz-TPA 1 wt% doped in the Tris-PCz:CN-T2T film under electronic excitation. The results are shown in Fig. 7(b). Upon integrating the area and multiplying the fluorescence radiative decay rate constant kr for NOz-t-TPA (or NOz-TPA), the ratio of EL intensity for INOz-t-TPAversus INOz-TPA was estimated to be 1.04. Despite the lower intensity in PL, the simulation predicted better performance for the EL of NOz-t-TPA. Although the real device performance also depends on other parameters such as device configuration and balance between electron and hole, etc., this methodology of using PL measurement serves as a paradigm to preliminarily estimate the EL efficiency in OLEDs based on energy transfer between the exciplex host and the fluorescent guest. Its validity was further proved by the following practical EL measurement.
Electroluminescence
Prior to the EL measurement, it was necessary to experimentally determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for title compounds in the solid thin film. To achieve this aim, photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) was conducted and the corresponding data are shown in Fig. S6 and Table S3 (ESI†). Note that in the PES approach, the LUMO energy level was calculated from the corresponding orbital by adding the absorption energy gap in the solid neat film to the acquired HOMO level. For comparison, cyclic voltammetry measurements were also conducted in solution for acceptors (NOz) with corresponding data shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Compared to other reported deep-red/NIR molecules with D–A–D systems, the title compound showed a relatively lower-lying LUMO of −3.56 eV,48–50 which suggests that NOz should be among the best acceptors for NIR D–A molecules.
The EL properties of OLEDs were investigated by fabricating a device with ITO/4 wt% ReO3:Tris-PCz (60 nm)/Tris-PCz (15 nm)/Tris-PCz:CN-T2T:1,5,10 wt% dopant (20 nm)/CN-T2T (50 nm)/Liq. (0.5 nm)/Al (100 nm) according to a previous report.6Fig. 8(a) shows the schematic energy level diagram of the device. According to the energy alignment, the holes and electrons can be injected from Tris-PCz and CN-T2T into the emissive layer (EML) without any energy barrier, respectively. Fig. 8(c)–(e) depicts the EL characteristics of the Tris-PCz:CN-T2T-doped 10% NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA devices, and the key data are summarized in Table 3. We also show the EL characteristics with different doping concentrations in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†). The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 3.

The 1 wt% NOz-TPA-doped device exhibited maximum EQE and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively, with an EL peak at 670 nm. However, at such low doping concentrations, the EL spectrum showed residual emission of the exciplex. The 5 wt% NOz-TPA doping device displayed complete energy transfer. The EL displayed a peak at 689 nm and lower maximum EQE (5.0%). When the doped concentration increased to 10%, the maximum EQE dropped to 4.3%, and the EL peak redshifted to 700 nm. As the doping concentration increased, the distance between the guest molecules decreased, which increased the local polarization field and the increased local polarization field caused the spectral redshift.7 The lower efficiency may have originated from the concentration quenching effects and the increase in DET from the triplet state (T1) of the exciplex to T1 of the dopant as shown in Fig. 8(b). To eliminate the DET process from T1 of the exciplex cohost to T1 of the fluorescent emitters, as well as to inhibit the concentration quenching process, a low doping concentration of the fluorescent emitter is thus required.
Notably, by adding tert-butyl groups on the para-sites of phenyl rings in TPA, forming NOz-t-TPA, the NIR OLED devices have further high EQE and redshifted emission. When EML had a low wt% such as 1% NOz-t-TPA to avoid the charge trapping process, the device displayed a maximum EQE of 7.4% and the EL spectrum clearly showed a weak exciplex emission at 510 nm. Next, upon increasing the doping level of NOz-t-TPA to 5 wt%, the device displayed a radiance (R) of 21310 mW sr−1 m−2 at 7.0 V (1455 mA cm−2) with a peak at 697 nm, which achieved a maximum EQE of 6.9% and PCE of 4.9%. Eventually, with 10 wt% NOz-t-TPA as the dopant, the device showed that 71% of such emission was in the NIR region (>700 nm) with an EL peaked at 710 nm. The remarkable point is that the 10 wt% NOz-t-TPA device still maintained a maximum EQE of 6.6%, which decreased a little as compared to the device with the 5 wt% dopant (EQE of 6.9%). This suggests that the growth of DET accompanying the increase of the doping level is not serious in the NOz-t-TPA system (cf.NOz-TPA). The result is consistent with the early interpretation of PL results based on the wide distance between the host material and guest molecules induced by the bulky tert-butyl substituent in NOz-t-TPA (vide supra), reaffirming the above kinetic analyses.
Regarding the current progress on the NIR OLEDs, we plotted the EL efficiency for the reported metal-free NIR OLEDs between 700 and 715 nm, shown in Fig. 8(f).29–31,51–53 Clearly, this work presents outstanding progress of the metal-free NIR OLEDs through the conventional organic fluorescent dyes pumped by exciplex hosts via energy transfer. Importantly, this study sheds light on the overall energy transfer mechanism that is of fundamental importance to the relevant research fields.
Conclusions
In summary, by exploiting two newly designed D–A–D type fluorescence NIR emitters, NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA, we have gained fundamental insights into the energy transfer pathways between the exciplex host and fluorescent guest. Both chromophores have been applied as guest emitters to fabricate a thin film with the exciplex host Tris-PCz:CN-T2T exciplex, where the host acts as an energy donor. The PLQY of NOz-TPA and NOz-t-TPA NIR 680 nm and 709 nm emissions were obtained as 42% and 28%, respectively, when optimized at 1 wt% blended in the Tris-PCz:CN-T2T film. Comprehensive time-resolved measurements suggest quite different kinetic traces and hence energy transfer pathways between the host and each fluorescence emitter. Detailed analyses confirmed a much different Dexter-type triplet–triplet energy transfer. Hindered by bulky tert-butyl substitution groups on the para-sites of TPA, the NOz-t-TPA-doped film had a DET rate that was slower by ∼60 times. Importantly, the analog analyses derived from the energy transfer mechanism (Fig. 5) predicted the relative PL and EL ratio for NOz-t-TPAversusNOz-TPA in the doped exciplex film. Despite the higher PL intensity in the NOz-TPA-doped film, due to the original 75% population in the triplet state for which the energy dissipation was dominated by Dexter-type energy transfer, the NOz-t-TPA-doped film was predicted to have better OLED performance regarding EQE and PCE. This was further firmly proved by the real OLED operation (Fig. 8 and Table 3). Correlating well with the analytical approach, the NOz-t-TPA device displayed a NIR emission peak at 710 nm with EQE up to 6.6%. This methodology incorporating comprehensive kinetic analyses has proven to be powerful for the exciplex host/fluorescent guest-type of OLED, which may play a crucial role in guiding further NIR OLED development.
