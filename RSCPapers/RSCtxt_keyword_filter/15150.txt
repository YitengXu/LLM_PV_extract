    , Accepted 20th September 2019First published on 23rd September 2019AbstractRegulating molecular ordering and nanoscale morphology of photoactive layer is crucial to achieve high carrier mobility for fabricating thick-film organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, molecular ordering and phase separation were finely controlled by varying the substrate temperature in blade-coated PM6:IT-4F devices. The blade-coated devices with low substrate temperature (30 °C) show low crystallinity of IT-4F and poor device performance. However, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.64% was achieved for the device blade-coated at 50 °C in air without any other processing treatments, due to the well-ordered molecular packing along the backbone direction of IT-4F molecules. When the film thickness increased to 400 nm, an excellent PCE of 10.22% was achieved in the device blade-coated at 70 °C, which is higher than that of the optimal device blade-coated at 50 °C. This was attributed to the much improved crystallinity within the long-range ordered side-chain packing of IT-4F molecules and the newly emerged small-scale phase separation providing purer domains and continuous charge transport channels. Furthermore, large-area (90 mm2) devices exhibit high PCEs of 11.39% and 9.76% with a 56 mm2 aperture at film thicknesses of 135 nm and 306 nm, respectively. In addition, the device blade-coated at 70 °C exhibits good storage stability. This work provides comprehensive guidance for optimizing the molecular ordering and nanoscale morphology to fabricate high-efficiency thick-film OSCs.
Introduction
Non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs)1–4 have attracted considerable attention in recent years and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 16% has been achieved in a single-junction binary device.5 However, these achievements are accomplished by spin-coating on small-area devices,6,7 which are material wasteful and difficult to extend to mass production.8 Therefore, developing large-area production technology is greatly needed. Fortunately, as a continuous coating technology, slot-die coating exhibits excellent compatibility with large-area roll–roll coating.9–14 Meanwhile, blade-coating serving as a prototype tool of slot-die coating possesses similar features,8,15 so it's suitable for early experimental studies in the lab. Encouragingly, blade-coated OSCs have made great progress with PCEs over 12%.16–19 Even so, an important challenge exists for achieving high performance in the thick-film devices by blade-coating,20 where most efficient new materials exhibit optimal photovoltaic performance with a film thickness of about 100 nm. It is difficult to maintain good reproducibility during the fast fabrication of pin-hole-free large-area OSCs at this film thickness.21 Increasing the film thickness can alleviate the phenomenon of pin-hole-free OSCs and benefit the fabrication of homogeneous large-area films. However, carrier mobility is of great importance to fabricate thick-film devices. In order to achieve high performance in thick-film devices, high carrier mobilities are of great importance for fast charge transfer and low recombination loss.22–24
In the field of organic semiconductors, molecular ordering greatly impacts the electronic and optoelectronic properties.25–27 Fine control of molecular ordering is considered as an efficient approach to achieve fast charge transport, so as to obtain great performance.26–29 Sirringhaus et al. reported that the mobility of a poly(3-hexylthiophene)-based field-effect transistor with edge-on molecular packing with respect to the substrate is over 100 times that of the one with face-on molecular packing.26 In addition, Carpenter et al. reported the competition between exceptionally long-range alkyl side-chain ordering and backbone ordering in semiconducting polymers and its impact on electronic and optoelectronic properties. It was demonstrated that the long-range side-chain ordering with atypical edge-on texture exhibits 2.5 times improved field-effect transistor mobility as compared to the corresponding backbone ordering.25 Furthermore, Li et al. achieved high mobility by film-casting with spin-coating on a hot substrate.27 It was reported that spin-coating on a hot substrate can reduce molecular organization time, and thus suppress crystallization. Furthermore, it leads to the change of molecular packing from flat-on and edge-on lamellar crystallization to both H- and J-type face-on π–π stacking of small molecules in a more condensed state as compared to the spin-coating without the hot substrate. Thus, high carrier mobility and excellent PCE (13.8%) were achieved. Nevertheless, fine controlling the substrate temperature in the spin-coating process is difficult, and spin-coating is incompatible with large-area roll–roll coating. It is worth noting that blade-coating can inherently induce a high degree of molecular packing for conjugated polymers and small molecules, which is beneficial for improving charge transport.17,30,31 However, fine controlling the molecular ordering and phase separation by varying the substrate temperature to improve carrier mobility in blade-coated high performance thick-film OSCs is not exploited.
In this work, molecular ordering and phase separation were finely controlled by varying the substrate temperature in blade-coated PM6:IT-4F OSCs. It was demonstrated that blade-coating at a substrate temperature of 30 °C (blade-coating @ 30 °C) shows low crystallinity of IT-4F, which is similar to the spin-coating. However, a great PCE of 13.64% is achieved for the blade-coated @ 50 °C device, and the blade-coated @ 70 °C device shows a high PCE of 10.22% at film thicknesses above 400 nm. Furthermore, large-area (90 mm2) devices were fabricated, and we obtained high PCEs of 11.39% and 9.76% with a 56 mm2 aperture at film thicknesses of 135 nm and 306 nm, respectively. In addition, the blade-coated @ 70 °C device exhibits good storage stability.
Results and discussion
Due to the high performance of PM6:IT-4F based OSCs and the lower electron mobility than hole mobility, the PM6:IT-4F system was selected in this work. The chemical structures of PM6 and IT-4F are presented in Fig. 1a,32–36 and Fig. 1b is a diagrammatic drawing of blade-coating with the heated substrate. The UV-vis absorption spectra exhibit excellent complementarity between the neat PM6 and IT-4F films (Fig. 1c). According to the normalized absorption spectra at 0–1 transition peaks (578 nm for PM6 and 664 nm for IT-4F), both blade-coated PM6 and IT-4F films exhibit enhanced 0–0 transition peaks (619 nm for PM6 and 724 nm for IT-4F) compared to the corresponding spin-coated films, suggesting stronger aggregation and ordering for the blade-coated films.37 The inset is the energy level of the PM6:IT-4F system, of which the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels are −5.50 eV/−3.61 eV for PM6, and −5.69 eV/−4.07 eV for IT-4F, respectively.34,35 Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)38 was employed to explore the molecular ordering and crystallization. Fig. 1d gives the crystallization coherence length (CCL) of lamellar stacking obtained from the GIWAXS results (Fig. S1†) by fitting the (100) peak in the in-plane direction according to the Scherrer equation, which indicates the mean size of ordered (crystalline) domains.39,40 The calculated CCL values of spin-coated PM6 and IT-4F are 6.14 nm and 2.74 nm, respectively. However, for the corresponding blade-coated films, the CCL values increase to 6.35 nm and 2.86 nm, respectively, revealing that blade-coating can induce a higher degree of molecular packing for both PM6 and IT-4F, which is well matched with the absorption spectra (Fig. 1c). The improved crystallization for blade-coated films is beneficial for fabricating high performance devices.

Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate))/PM6:IT-4F/ZrAcac (zirconium acetylacetonate)/Al were fabricated by spin-coating and blade-coating in an ambient environment without any other processing treatments.41 The effective device area is 4 mm2 and the optimal film thickness is kept at 100–140 nm. For the blade-coated devices, the substrate was heated using a controlled heater to keep the substrate temperature at 30 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C (named as blade-coating @ 30 °C, blade-coating @ 50 °C and blade-coating @ 70 °C), respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 2a, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The spin-coated devices exhibit an average PCE of 11.78% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.88 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 18.99 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70.47%. For the blade-coated @ 30 °C devices, the average PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF are 11.83%, 0.87 V, 19.89 mA cm−2 and 68.39%, respectively. As the substrate temperature increases to 50 °C, the corresponding devices exhibit an average PCE of 13.15% with a highest PCE of 13.64%, due to the improved Jsc (20.76 mA cm−2) and FF (72.00%). However, a further increased substrate temperature (70 °C) leads to a slight decrease of device performance with a PCE of 13.24%. The current densities integrated from EQE curves (Fig. 2b) are 18.71 mA cm−2, 19.30 mA cm−2, 20.09 mA cm−2 and 20.14 mA cm−2 for the spin-coated, blade-coated @ 30 °C, blade-coated @ 50 °C and blade-coated @ 70 °C devices, respectively, which are consistent with the current density obtained from J–V measurements.

The charge carrier mobilities were investigated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.42,43 As shown in Fig. S2† and 2c and Table 1, all these three blade-coated devices exhibit much higher hole mobilities than the spin-coated device, and the blade-coated @ 50 °C device presents the highest hole mobility of 3.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, the electron mobility of the blade-coated @ 30 °C device shows a slight improvement as compared with the corresponding spin-coated device. When the substrate temperature increases from 30 °C to 50 °C, the electron mobility increases from 1.31 × 10−4 to 3.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. In addition, a further increase of the substrate temperature to 70 °C does not result in the continuous enhancement of electron mobility (3.41 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Notably, the blade-coated @ 50 °C and blade-coated @ 70 °C devices exhibit high and balanced carrier mobilities, which are beneficial for improving charge transport and suppressing recombination loss, so as to improve the photovoltaic performance. In order to analyze the variation of photovoltaic performance, the charge carrier dynamics involving exciton dissociation, charge extraction and collection processes are investigated.44–47Fig. 2d shows the plots of photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of various devices.44Jph is defined by the equation Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under light illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined by the equation Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0, and Va is the applied voltage. The exciton dissociation probability (P) is determined by P = Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions, where the Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density at a high Veff value. The calculated exciton dissociation probabilities44 for the spin-coated, blade-coated @ 30 °C, blade-coated @ 50 °C and blade-coated @ 70 °C devices are 97.79%, 96.83%, 98.83% and 97.49%, respectively. The large value of P for the blade-coated @ 50 °C device indicates an excellent charge collection and extraction, which matches well the high FF of 72.00%. Meanwhile, the dependence of Voc and Jsc on the light intensity was employed to investigate the recombination mechanism.45,46 The semilogarithmic plot of Voc as a function of light intensity delivers a linear relationship with a slope of kT/q, where the small slope of kT/q indicates the low Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination.46 As displayed in Fig. 2d, the small slope of 1.36 kT/q suggests the low SRH recombination for the blade-coated @ 50 °C device. In addition, according to the relationship of Jsc ∝ (light intensity)α, the fitted slopes (α) (Fig. 2f) are 0.97, 0.97, 0.98 and 0.97 for the spin-coated, blade-coated @ 30 °C, blade-coated @ 50 °C and blade-coated @ 70 °C devices, respectively, where α = 1 means that all dissociated free carriers are collected at the corresponding electrodes.46 The blade-coated @ 50 °C device presents a large value of α = 0.98, suggesting weak bimolecular recombination. Consequently, the excellent photovoltaic performance for the blade-coated @ 50 °C devices (PCE = 13.15%) can be attributed to the high and balanced carrier mobilities, as well as the low recombination with high exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency, which should be related to the nanoscale morphology of the active layer.
To understand the variation of photovoltaic performance, the morphology characterization of resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS)48,49 and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out. The RSoXS is a widely used method to characterize the phase separation of the active layer in OSCs, for which an X-ray energy of 284.8 eV was selected due to the high scattering contrast between PM6 and IT-4F. As shown in Fig. 3a and S3† and Table 2, the spin-coated film possesses a domain size of 28 nm, and the blade-coated @ 30 °C film shows a similar domain size of 30 nm. However, the domain sizes of the blade-coated @ 50 °C and blade-coated @ 70 °C films increase to 39 nm and 41 nm, respectively. Notably, another small length-scale of phase separation with a domain size of 13 nm (domain spacing 26 nm) at q = 0.23 nm−1 was observed in the blade-coated @ 70 °C film by fitting the profile with the lognormal model (Fig. 3a). In addition, the calculated relative purities of these four films are 0.84, 0.87, 0.93 and 1, respectively, where the high purity is considered to be beneficial for improving charge transport and decreasing recombination losses.50–52 The change of domain size and the increased purity with the increased substrate temperature may arise from the variation of molecular packing and crystallization, which will be discussed below. Due to the low material contrast of TEM characterization, homogeneous films without an obvious nanostructure are observed in the TEM images of the spin-coated film (Fig. 3b), blade-coated @ 30 °C film (Fig. 3c) and blade-coated @ 50 °C film (Fig. 3d). However, lots of fiber structures can be obviously observed through the whole film in the blade-coated @ 70 °C film (Fig. 3e), indicative of the high crystallinity, which may be the reason for the highest domain purity for the blade-coated @ 70 °C film.

In order to investigate the detailed information of molecular ordering and crystallization behavior, GIWAXS38 measurements for the PM6:IT-4F films were performed. As shown in Fig. 4, all the PM6:IT-4F films exhibit a pronounced (010) scattering peak at q = 1.67 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, which originates from the π–π stacking of PM6, suggesting the strong face-on orientation. However, IT-4F in the four blend films presents broad (010) diffraction peaks at q ≈ 1.42 Å−1 in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions, indicating the existence of both face-on and edge-on orientations. Notably, the scattering peaks at a low q location show the more pronounced difference for these four films, and the corresponding structural parameters obtained by fitting the GIWAXS profiles (Fig. S4†) are shown in Tables 3 and S1.† The calculated CCLs39 of PM6 for the spin-coated blend film in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions are 10.66 and 9.27 nm with the corresponding d-spacing of 2.09 and 2.17 nm, respectively. For the blade-coated films, the d-spacing of PM6 has almost no change, but the CCL shows varying degrees of increase, suggesting the improved crystallinity of PM6 for the blade-coated films, especially for the blade-coated @ 50 °C film (CCL = 16.62 nm, 10.30 nm) and blade-coated @ 70 °C film (CCL = 13.24 nm, 10.70 nm). There are no pronounced scattering peaks of IT-4F at the low q location in the spin-coated film and blade-coated @ 30 °C film, indicating the low crystallinity of IT-4F in the blend film. Generally, the charge transport in the crystalline domain is faster than in the amorphous domain.53,54 Thus, the low crystallinity of IT-4F may be the reason why the electron mobility of these two corresponding devices is low (Fig. 2c).

Inspiringly, a new and pronounced scattering peak appears in the in-plane direction at q = 0.31 Å−1 for the blade-coated @ 50 °C film, suggesting the existence of another structural ordering. The newly appeared scattering peak with a lattice constant of 2.03 nm (CCL = 19.49 nm) is attributed to the molecular ordering of IT-4F along the backbone which is named as backbone packing.25,55 The backbone packing can effectively extend the electron transport pathway and therefore significantly improve the carrier mobility, so as to improve photovoltaic performance.55 Surprisingly, the (001) scattering peak of backbone packing disappears in the blade-coated @ 70 °C film together with multiple sharp scattering peaks emerging in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, demonstrating a much higher degree of crystallinity, compared with the other three blend films. As evidenced by the GIWAXS data of pure IT-4F (Fig. S1†), the sharp scattering peak at q = 0.39 Å−1 in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions should be the (100) scattering peak of IT-4F, indicative of side-chain packing (lamellar packing), suggesting the very high crystallinity of IT-4F with both face-on and edge-on orientations. Interestingly, according to the fitting results, the calculated CCL of the in-plane (100) scattering peak for IT-4F is 26.91 nm, which approximates the domain spacing (26 nm) of another length-scale phase separation (Fig. 3a), indicating that the newly appeared phase separation may contribute to the scattering contrast between the lamellar crystal and the surrounding region.
Generally, the lamellar packing by the side-chain is considered to be a thermodynamic steady state, and the other molecular packing is an intermediate state which is unsteady, such as face-on π–π stacking and backbone stacking.25 For the blade-coated @ 70 °C film, the high substrate temperature provides enough energy and accelerates the movement of IT-4F molecules. It facilitates molecular ordering, so it is easy to reach the steady state of lamellar packing with the side-chain. For the spin-coated film and blade-coated @ 30 °C film, IT-4F molecules move slowly in the blend films, and it is difficult to facilitate the molecule packing, resulting in weak crystallinity. However, in the blade-coated @ 50 °C film, moderate substrate temperature can trigger the movement and arrangement of IT-4F molecules, but it's not enough to reach the steady state. Thus, an intermediate state of backbone packing for IT-4F molecules is formed, where the charge transport along the backbone packing is fast, resulting in high electron mobility. Hence, the backbone packing in the blade-coated @ 50 °C film and the enhanced side-chain packing in the blade-coated @ 70 °C film lead to improved electron mobility, so as to achieve high PCEs of 13.64% and 13.24%.
Considering the improved charge carrier mobilities and photoelectric properties, thick films were fabricated, which are beneficial for the production of pin-hole-free large-area OSCs. The photovoltaic performances of PM6:IT-4F based devices with different thicknesses are shown in Fig. 5a and S5 and Table S2.† The optimal thicknesses of the spin-coated device, blade-coated @ 30 °C device, blade-coated @ 50 °C device and blade-coated @ 70 °C device are 103, 132, 134, and 141 nm, respectively, where the increased optimal thickness attributes to the improved and balanced carrier mobilities. When the film thickness increases, the Voc and FF both decrease variously, while the Jsc and PCE increase first and then decrease. However, these characteristics of the blade-coated @ 70 °C device decrease more slowly than those of the other three devices as the film thickness increases, resulting in a higher photovoltaic performance at thicknesses >230 nm than that of the other three devices. Impressively, the blade-coated @ 70 °C device shows a notable PCE of 10.22% at a film thickness of 400 nm, which is one of the highest values for the thick-film devices at present. As shown in Fig. 5b, the Jsc values of the blade-coated @ 50 °C device and blade-coated @ 70 °C device are 15.31 and 18.91 mA cm−2, and both of them are far from the saturated current density at a bias voltage of −2 V, indicating the low exciton dissociation efficiency and charge extraction efficiency in the thick-film devices. However, the blade-coated @ 70 °C device shows a smaller difference of current density between the open-circuit conditions and the bias voltage of −2 V than the blade-coated @ 50 °C device, suggesting higher exciton dissociation efficiency and charge extraction efficiency for the blade-coated @ 70 °C device than the blade-coated @ 50 °C device at a film thickness of ∼500 nm.56 The approximate exciton dissociation probabilities obtained from Jph–Veff curves (Fig. 5c) are about 68.58% and 78.88%, further demonstrating the better exciton dissociation and charge extraction for the blade-coated @ 70 °C device.46 Furthermore, the plot of Vocversus light intensity (Fig. 5d) shows less recombination loss for the blade-coated @ 70 °C device due to the low value of 1.72 kT/q than that of the blade-coated @ 50 °C device, which matches well with the high photovoltaic performance for the thick-film device.

(f) The normalized PCE of blade-coated @ 70 °C devices with increasing time of storage in a N2-filled glovebox. 
The nanoscale morphology of the thick film was investigated by GIWAXS and RSoXS. As shown in Fig. S6,† the thick film shows similar morphological characteristics to the thin film, except for the slightly increased domain size (from 39 nm to 44 nm), indicating that the film thickness has a small effect on the morphology of the blade-coated PM6:IT-4F film. Notably, the blade-coated @ 50 °C device exhibits a higher PCE than the blade-coated @ 70 °C device at a thickness of about 130–140 nm. However, when the film thickness is >400 nm, the blade-coated @ 50 °C device presents lower PCE than the blade-coated @ 70 °C device. The reason should be that the backbone packing (the d-spacing is 2.03 nm and the CCL is 19.49 nm; see Table 3) in the blade-coated @ 50 °C film has a short-range order, with which it is more difficult to form continuous and efficient transport channels in a thick film than in a thin film. On the other hand, the side-chain packing (the d-spacing is 1.61 nm and the CCL is 26.91 nm; see Table 3) in the blade-coated @ 70 °C film has a long-range order, which is more suitable for fabricating a thick-film device. Moreover, the newly appeared small-scale phase domain in the blade-coated @ 70 °C film should play a more important role in the thick film for efficient charge transport. Therefore, the blade-coated @ 70 °C device possesses higher PCE than the corresponding blade-coated @ 50 °C device at a film thickness of about 500 nm.
Large-area devices of 90 mm2 device area with various film thicknesses were also fabricated by blade-coating at a substrate temperature of 70 °C in an ambient environment. The J–V measurement of the large-area device was made with an aperture of 56 mm2. As shown in Fig. 5e and S7 and Table S3,† the device with the 135 nm active layer exhibits a highest PCE of 11.39% and an average PCE of 10.77% with a Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 19.28 mA cm−2 and FF of 67.56%. Although the PCE and FF decreased as the film thickness increased, the large-area thick device with a thickness of 306 nm exhibits a highest PCE of 9.76%. In addition, the long-term stability of the blade-coated @ 70 °C device was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5f, after 1344 h of storage in a N2-filled glovebox, the PCE damage is only about 6%, indicating considerable long-term stability. The high device performance of the blade-coated large-area thick-film OSC and considerable device stability hold great promise in the industrial production and commercial application of organic solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated organic solar cells based on a PM6:IT-4F blend by blade-coating at different substrate temperatures in air, and devices with various film thicknesses were also prepared. It was demonstrated that the film thickness has a small effect on the morphology of the active layer. In addition, the blade-coated @ 30 °C device shows a PCE of 12.25% which approximates to that of the spin-coated device, due to their similar morphological characteristics with low crystallinity of IT-4F. A highest PCE of 13.64% was achieved for the blade-coated @ 50 °C device, due to the newly appeared backbone packing of IT-4F molecules, accompanied by the improvement of electron mobility. However, the backbone packing has short-range order with which it is more difficult to form continuous and efficient transport channels in a thick film than in a thin film. Thus, this molecular packing is unsuitable for fabricating thick-film devices, where the PCE is only 7.19% at a film thickness of about 500 nm. When the substrate temperature increases to 70 °C, the IT-4F molecules move faster and tend to form a steady state of side-chain packing, which has long-range order and is suitable for fabricating thick-film devices. Moreover, the blade-coated @ 70 °C film shows another small-scale phase separation which plays a very important role in the thick film for continuous charge transport channels. Hence, a high PCE of 10.22% was achieved for the blade-coated @ 70 °C device with a film thickness of about 400 nm, which is much higher than that of the corresponding blade-coated @ 50 °C device. Furthermore, the large-area (90 mm2) device exhibits high PCEs of 11.39% and 9.76% with a 56 mm2 aperture at film thicknesses of 135 nm and 306 nm, respectively. In addition, the blade-coated @ 70 °C device exhibits good storage stability with respect to the efficiency. This work reports an efficient approach to achieve high mobility by controlling molecular ordering, which can be employed in other similar non-fullerene systems with low electron mobility of small molecule acceptors, showing great prospects for the large-area fabrication of high-efficiency and thick-film non-fullerene OSCs.
