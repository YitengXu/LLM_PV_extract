    , Accepted 18th July 2022First published on 19th July 2022AbstractDeveloping highly efficient small molecule hole-transporting materials (HTMs) to improve the performance of devices is one of the hot topics in the progress of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a series of molecules are designed by utilizing benzocyclobutadiene (C1), bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene (C2), naphthalene (C3), biphenylene (C4), fluorene (C5), and azulene (C6) as the π-cores, and p-methoxydiphenylamine (R1), p-methoxytriphenylamine (R2) and p-methoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole (R3) as the peripheral groups. For isolated molecules, frontier molecule orbitals, absorption and emission spectra, Stokes shift, stability, solubility, and hole mobility are assessed by density functional theory calculations along with the Marcus theory of electron transfer. The molecules adsorbed on the surface of CH3NH3PbI3 are used to simulate the interfacial properties between HTMs and perovskites. Our results indicate that varying the central bridge and the terminal groups has a remarkable influence on the properties. The designed R2-Cn (n = 3, 4, 5) have deeper HOMO levels, stronger absorption in the UV region, and larger Stokes shift than Spiro-OMeTAD. They also possess good solubility, stability, and hole mobility. The proper alignment of interfacial energy levels ensures the transfer of holes from CH3NH3PbI3 to the studied molecules and blocks the backflow of electrons simultaneously. Significant charge redistributions around the interfacial region benefit the separation and transfer photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The results of the present study can be further employed in the process of synthesizing new HTMs with promising features.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, increasing efforts have been made to develop clean and sustainable energies and to utilize them to deal with the shortage of fossil energy sources and environmental crisis. Solar energy is an ideal candidate due to its tremendous reserve, ubiquity, and cleanness, which can be directly converted to electricity through solar cell devices. As one of the emerging photovoltaics, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated a comparable potential to traditional commercial silicon-based solar cells due to their low cost, easy fabrication, strong light absorption, and fast-growing power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 25.5%.1–5 In the device architecture of PSCs, a perovskite film is sandwiched between an electron-transporting layer and a hole-transporting layer. Under light irradiation, the perovskite absorber is excited and the photoinduced electrons are transferred to the electron-transporting layer. The hole-transporting material (HTM) is responsible for extracting and transporting the photogenerated holes to the electrode, which is an important constituent in influencing the photoelectric conversion and stability of PSCs.6–9
Among a variety of developed HTMs, the organic small molecule 2-2′-7,7′-tetrakis (N,N′-diparamethoxy-phenylamine) 9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) exhibits the most excellent performance.10–13 However, the disadvantages of Spiro-OMeTAD, such as complicated synthesis route, high-cost, multiple purification steps, inferior hole mobility, and instability for long-term devices, curtail its commercial application in PSCs.14,15 Consequently, extensive investigations have focused on finding alternative organic small molecules with low-cost, facile synthesis and high performance.16–18 In general, an optimal HTM needs to meet the following requirements: (1) the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) compatible with the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite, (2) good hole mobility, (3) minimal absorption in the visible- and near-IR region of the solar spectrum, and (4) excellent thermal and photochemical stability.19,20
In Spiro-OMeTAD, the spirobifluorene core as the π-linker (π) is surrounded by electron-donating (D) diphenylamine terminal groups. The strategic modifications of the structures of central fragments and end groups generate multifarious D–π–D molecular HTMs.21–23 Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that π-bridge is the key component of linear-linked HTMs in determining the photovoltaic performance and synthetic cost.24–28 Chen et al. synthesized two small molecule HTMs (NH-2,6 and NH-2,7) based on the naphthalene core and arylamine terminal groups by tuning the substitution position. PSCs based on these two molecules exhibited excellent reproducibility and stability. A PCE of 18.7% was achieved by the optimized PSCs including NH-2,6.29 Pham et al. reported a promising, simple, and low cost HTM, TPA–NAP–TPA, which is composed of a naphthalene core and triphenylamine methoxyl as end groups. It was successfully used in the PSC device with a PCE of 14.63%.30 HTMs including the fluorene derivatives as the cores showed excellent performances in the developed PSCs.31,32 A branched methoxydiphenylamine-substituted fluorene derivative KR216 as the HTM reached a PCE of 17.8% in PSCs. This material was synthesized using a straightforward two-step procedure involving low-cost precursors.33 FMT, a linear HTM based on 9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene and N,N-di-p-methylthiophenylamine, was experimentally obtained by Zhang et al. The dopant-free FMT-based PSCs exhibited a high PCE of 19.06%.34 Wakamiya et al. found that utilizing two-dimensionally expanded π-systems around an azulene core as HTMs can achieve a high PCE of 18.9% for PSCs.35,36
Normally, extended π-conjugation and rigid coplanar structures are typical of active small molecule HTMs to decrease the reorganization energy. However, extended π-conjugation commonly leads to a redshift of the absorption band edge, reducing the transparency. Although some strategies were adopted to avoid the conflict between intrinsic properties,37–41 the relationship between the molecular structure and photovoltaic performance is not clear enough. In the present work, we have designed a series of linear small molecules as shown in Fig. 1. They are characterized by using benzocyclobutadiene (C1),42,43 bicyclo[6.2.0]decapentaene (C2),44 naphthalene (C3),45 biphenylene (C4),46–48 fluorene (C5),31 and azulene (C6) as π-bridges,49 and p-methoxydiphenylamine (R1),50p-methoxytriphenylamine (R2),19,51 and p-methoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole (R3) as electron donors.26,52 Our goal is to evaluate their potential as organic small molecule HTMs in PSCs by calculating the structural, electronic, optical, charge-transporting and adsorption properties on the perovskite surface.

2. Computational methods
The Gaussian 09 program was applied to accomplish all the DFT calculations on studied molecules.53 The ground state structures were optimized using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method.54 According to the previous findings, PBE33/6-31G(d,p) as an optimal method was used to obtain a relatively accurate energy level alignment of the frontier orbitals on the basis of optimized structures.55,56 The UV-vis absorption spectra of the investigated molecules were simulated via time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) at the MPW1K/6-31G(d,p) level.57,58 The first singlet excited-state geometries of molecules were optimized using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method.59 The maximum emission wavelengths of the designed molecules were computed using the MPW1K/6-31G(d,p) method. The solvent effect was considered throughout the calculations based on the conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM) with dichloromethane (DCM) as the solvent.60 Frequency calculations were performed to ensure that the optimized structures had the minimum potential energy. The solvation Gibbs free energy (ΔGsolv) was the free energy difference of a molecule in the solvent and in the gas phase, which was calculated using the M05-2X/6-31G(d,p) method coupled with the SMD model to estimate the relative solubility of the designed molecules.61,62
The hole transport behavior was described by the Marcus electron transfer theory with the hopping model.63 The hole hopping rate (k) was calculated by the following equation: (1)where h is the Planck constant, v is the transfer integral, λ is the reorganization energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.
The reorganization energy λ can be obtained according to eqn (2): (2)where  and  are the total energies of neutral and cationic species with the optimized geometries of cationic and neutral molecules, respectively. E0 and E+ are the total energies of neutral and cationic species in their own optimized structures, respectively. B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) was utilized to gain the stable geometries of ionic species.
Based on the expression below, the transfer integral v was assessed by a direct coupling approach:64,65 ν = 〈ΨHOMOi|F|ΨHOMOf〉(3)where ΨHOMOi and ΨHOMOf are the HOMOs of two isolated molecules in a neutral dimer calculated by the M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) method.66F is the Fock operator for the dimer, which can be calculated as F = SCεC−1, where S denotes the overlap matrix for the dimer, and the Kohn–Sham orbital C and eigenvalue ε are evaluated by diagonalizing the zeroth-order Fock matrix.19
The hole mobility μ was computed using the Einstein relation:67 (4)where e is the unit charge, d is the spatial dimension, which is equal to 3 here, i is the considered transfer pathway, ki is the hopping rate of the hole, ri is the distance between two mass centers, and Pi is the hopping probability to the ith pathway.
The interactions between designed molecular HTMs and perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) were modeled by first-principles calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).68,69 The electron ion interaction was described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.63,70 The exchange-correlation potential was described by the GGA-PBE functional.57 The plane-wave cutoff energy is set to be of 400 eV. Based on the relaxed bulk structure of MAPbI3, (2 × 2) and (2 × 3) supercells of the (110) surface including four layers were built according to the size of molecules. A vacuum layer of 20 Å was added to avoid the interaction between periodic slabs. The lattice parameters of supercells are a = 25.77 Å, b = 24.91 Å, and c = 31.81 Å for R1-Cn adsorbed on MAPbI3 and a = 25.77 Å, b = 37.36 Å, and c = 31.81 Å for R2-Cn and R3-Cn adsorbed on MAPbI3, respectively. Due to the large size of the simulated systems, we considered only the Γ-point for the sampling of the first Brillouin zone. This computational setup was effective in several recent studies.71–73 The DFT-D3 method proposed by Grimme et al. is applied to describe the internal interaction between interfacial layers.74–76 The optimization was not accomplished until residual forces were less than 0.01 eV Å−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric and electronic structures
Because electronic and optical properties are mainly dependent on the molecular geometries, we start with analyzing the optimized structures of the studied molecules at the ground state as indicated in Fig. 2, where the torsion angles between the plane of the central π-bridge and the planes of peripheral groups are labeled. As can be seen, the torsion angles range from 7.2° to 60.5 ° for R1-Cn, from 2.2° to 43.4° for R2-Cn, and from 24.1° to 68.8° for R3-Cn (n = 1–6). For the same π-bridge, the torsion angles increase from R2 to R1 to R3, which suggests that introducing a phenyl group between the core and the terminal groups in R1-Cn benefits the enhancement in the planarity of the molecular system. By contrast, the carbazole fragments attached by two diphenylamine groups R3-Cn increase the steric hindrance and further destroy the planarity. In addition, the distortion angle between the terminal group and the four- or five-membered ring in the π-linker is notably smaller than that between the terminal group and the six- or seven- or eight-membered ring, such as 11.3° vs. 60.5° in R1-C2, 9.8° vs. 37.6° in R2-C6. Generally, a better planarity of a molecular system can facilitate delocalized π-conjugation to ensure a more efficient hole mobility in the π-stacking direction. In this regard, the molecules with R2 as the terminal groups have advantages over the molecules with R1 or R3 as the peripheral groups.

In PSCs, suitable energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals compared with the VBM and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of light absorbers are important to promote the hole transport and to improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc). For an ideal HTM, the HOMO is supposed to be higher than the VBM of the perovskite to guarantee the efficient injection of the holes into HTMs, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is supposed to be higher than the CBM of the perovskite to block the electron transportation from the perovskite to the metal electrode. Therefore, obtaining more accurate HOMO and LUMO levels is important to design potential HTMs. Previous theoretical works found that the HOMO levels are overestimated by the B3LYP, MPW1B95 and PBE1PBE functionals, while these values are undervalued with the MPWB1K, PBE38, and BHHLYP methods. Compared with the experimental HOMO levels, the PBE33 functional can give the most accurate values among the seven functionals, which has been applied to design various HTMs.55,56,77 So in this work, PBE33/6-31G(d,p) is chosen to obtain the HOMO and LUMO energies of the studied HTMs and their spatial distributions. The LUMO energies are determined by ELUMO = EHOMO + E0, where E0 is the first singlet excitation energy obtained through TDDFT calculation.56 The calculated HOMO and LUMO of Spiro-OMeTAD are −5.13 eV and −2.09 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with the experimental data.78
The calculated results are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding data are included in Table 1. The VBM (−5.43 eV) and CBM (−3.93 eV) of MAPbI3, a representative perovskite, are also displayed in Fig. 3 as references.79 The HOMO levels of the designed molecules are in the range between −4.87 eV and −5.28 eV and are higher than the VBM of the perovskite, which ensures that the photogenerated holes can be successfully injected from the perovskite to the HTMs. A deeper HOMO level is beneficial for extracting the hole to obtain a higher Voc. It is shown in Fig. 3 that the energy levels of HOMOs follow the trend of R1-Cn > R3-Cn > R2-Cn (n = 1–6) with the same n. The calculated HOMOs are −5.28 eV for R2-C3, −5.27 eV for R2-C4, −5.26 eV for R2-C5, and −5.23 eV for R2-C6, which are lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.13 eV). In other words, these four molecules as HTMs in PSCs may result in a higher Voc than Spiro-OMeTAD. Regarding the core, the deepness of HOMO levels follows the trend of C3, C4 > C5 > C6 > C1, C2. The calculated energies of LUMOs range from −1.89 eV to −3.16 eV, which are higher than the CBM of MAPbI3, indicating that the electrons backflowing from the perovskite to electrodes can be effectively prevented. The addition of an extra phenyl ring or the introduction of the carbazole fragment to R1-based HTMs gives rise to a notable decrease of LUMO levels.

Apart from the suitable energy alignment, the electronic distribution is also a critical property to evaluate the HTM performance. As depicted in Fig. 3, a wider distribution of HOMOs than LUMOs is observed for all the molecules, which reveals that the hole transport performance is better than the electron transport performance, making them more suitable for application as HTMs. For R1-Cn and R2-Cn (n = 1–6), the electron clouds of HOMOs are almost delocalized throughout the whole molecule, while the distributions of LUMOs are dominantly localized on the central π-bridges. A good delocalization of the HOMOs is favorable for the hole transport. As to R3-Cn (n = 1–6), the HOMOs are mostly distributed over the terminal groups, while the LUMOs are mainly localized at the core. For C1- and C2-based HTMs, the unsymmetric distributions of HOMOs are clearly visible due to the four-membered ring in the central π-bridge. Our results exhibit that R2 as the peripheral group is more favorable for reducing energy levels and expanding the electron distribution of HOMOs than R1 and R3.
3.2. Optical property and charge transfer
Less optical absorption in the visible light region and large Stokes shift are favorable features of highly efficient HTMs. In order to understand the electronic transition and excitation properties of the designed HTMs, we calculated the absorption and emission spectra based on the optimized ground and first excited state geometries by using the MPW1K/6-31G(d,p) method in solvent DCM. The absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 4, and the detailed data including the maximum absorption wavelength (λmaxabs), oscillator strength (f), the maximum emission wavelength (λmaxem), and Stokes shift (Δλst) are listed in Table 1. The calculated spectroscopic properties of Spiro-OMeTAD are well consistent with the previous experimental and theoretical results.56,80,81 As can be seen from Fig. 4, there are two absorption peaks observed in every curve, showing a wide absorption band in the UV region. Except Rn-C6 (n = 1–3), λmaxabs values of all the molecules vary from 314 nm to 392 nm, which are beyond the visible light range and thus have no competition with the light absorption of the perovskite (400–750 nm). The absorption spectra of R1-Cn (n = 1–6), R2-C4 and R3-C5 show blue-shifts compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, and the absorption edge of the rest molecules is red-shifted. Generally speaking, λmaxabs values of R2- and R3-based HTMs are calculated to be longer than those of the corresponding R1-based HTMs to a certain extent, mainly due to the extension of π-conjugation in molecules. The absorption intensity f at the λmaxabs of R1-C2, R1-C4, R1-C5, and R2-Cn (n = 1–6) is higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Especially, R2-Cn exhibit the increase of 1.3–2.2 times in absorption intensity.
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectrum of (a) R1-based, (b) R2-based, and (c) R3-based molecules calculated at the MPW1K/6-31G(d,p) level. 
As displayed in Table 1, the maximum emission wavelengths λmaxem of the designed molecules are in the range of 378–652 nm. Stokes shift Δλst is defined as the difference between λmaxabs and λmaxem (Δλst = λmaxem − λmaxabs). It is found that except R1-C5, R3-C3 and R3-C5, all the investigated HTMs have larger Stokes shifts than the Spiro-OMeTAD, which mostly results from the increase in the structural difference between the ground state and the excited state. The increased Stokes shifts lead to a flexibility and improvement in the pore-filling of the structures.82C4-based HTMs have the highest Stokes shifts and are considered to be the most flexible, followed by C6- and C2-based HTMs. C1-, C3- and C5-based HTMs exhibit lower Stokes shifts and are more rigid structures. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, R1-C2, R1-C4, and R2-Cn (n = 1–5) possess stronger absorptions in the UV region, larger Stokes shifts, and greater advantage for the application of pore-filling.
To study the charge transfer properties of the designed molecules, the charge density difference (CDD) coupled with the amount of charge transfer is evaluated using the approach reported by Ciofini et al.83 The CDD analysis was performed using the Multiwfn 3.3.8 program according to the Gaussian outputs.84Fig. 5 displays that for R2-Cn (n = 3, 5, 6) and R3-Cn (n = 1–6), the electrons are mainly distributed on the central π-linkers, and the holes are concentrated on terminal groups, which suggests that the charges are transferred from terminal groups to the core. For R1-Cn (n = 1–6) and R2-Cn (n = 1, 2, 4), the electrons are dominantly located on the π-bridges, and the holes are contributed by both core and peripheral groups, which shows that the charges are transferred from the whole molecule to the core. The range of the charge transfer can be represented by the amount of transferred charges. As shown in Fig. 5, the transferred charge amounts of the studied HTMs range from 0.45 e to 1.13 e. Compared to Spiro-OMeTAD (0.69 e), R1-Cn (n = 2, 3), R2-Cn (n = 3–6), and R3-Cn (n = 1–6) exhibit the similar and even larger transferred charge amounts, suggesting that the easier separation of electron–hole pairs and the weaker Coulomb attraction can be expected.
 Fig. 5  Charge density difference maps and transferred charge amounts of the designed molecules; the purple and blue regions represent the regions where the electrons are increased and reduced, respectively. 
3.3. Stability and solubility
High stability and good solubility are also important factors related to the overall performance of PSCs. The absolute hardness is usually used to evaluate the stability of organic systems, which can be defined as η = (IP − EA)/2, where IP is the adiabatic ionization potential and EA is the adiabatic electron affinity.85,86 The larger the hardness, the higher the stability. As indicated in Table 1, the calculated values of chemical hardness for the designed HTMs are in the range of 0.97 eV to 1.65 eV. C5-based molecules possess the highest hardness (1.51–1.65 eV), followed by C3-based molecules (1.41–1.56 eV), which are close to and even higher than Spiro-OMeTAD (1.54 eV). These findings imply that their stability is comparable with that of Spiro-OMeTAD. C2-based HTMs have the poorest stability due to the hardness values in the range of 0.97–1.12 eV. R3-based HTMs exhibit lower hardness than R1- and R2-based counterparts, indicating that the introduction of carbazole segments is unfavorable to enhance the stability of molecules.
The electrostatic surface potential (ESP) is another way to estimate the molecular stability. The images of the calculated ESPs are shown in Fig. 6, in which the red and blue regions represent negative and positive charges, respectively. The larger area of the negative charges demonstrates that the molecule is more easily oxidized, and thus the molecular stability is poorer. As can be seen, negative charge regions of R1- and R2-based HTMs are primarily located on the central cores and oxygen atoms of the methoxy groups due to their strong electron withdrawing ability, while negative charge regions of R3-based HTMs are mostly distributed on carbazole and oxygen atoms of methoxy groups. The positive charges of all the studied molecules are more distributed on hydrogen atoms. Regarding the same terminal groups, C1-, C2-, and C6-based molecules have more regions of negative charges than C3-, C4- and C5-based molecules, implying the poorer stability. The predicted results are in good agreement with those obtained by the absolute hardness.
 Fig. 6  Electrostatic surface potential images of all the investigated molecules. Regions of negative and positive charges are shown in red and blue, respectively. 
The solubility of organic molecules can be estimated by the solvation Gibbs free energy (ΔGsol), which is defined as ΔGsol = Gsol − Ggas, where Gsol and Ggas represent the Gibbs free energy of a molecule in the solvent and the gaseous phase, respectively. The negative values of ΔGsol in Table 1 illustrate that the solvation process in DCM is thermodynamically spontaneous for all the investigated molecules. The calculated ΔGsol values of R3-based HTMs are the most negative, followed by R2-based HTMs, which shows that the solubility of R3- and R2-based HTMs is better than that of R1-based HTMs. Compared to Spiro-OMeTAD with the ΔGsol of −59.28 kcal mol−1, R2- and R3-based molecules may have comparable and even better solubility.
3.4. Hole mobility
Hole mobility is one of the most important parameters to evaluate the performance of HTMs in PSCs. The enhancement of hole mobility benefits the increase of the short circuit current density and fill factors of PSCs.87,88 The charge transport property of organic molecules is normally described by the thermally activated hopping model combining with the Marcus theory and the Einstein relation.89,90 According to eqn (1), the hole hopping rate is mainly determined by two parameters: reorganization energy (λ) and hole transfer integral (ν). A small λ and a large ν will promote the hole transport. The reorganization energy is made up of the inner nuclear reorganization energy and outer polarized reorganization energy.91 The external energy is much smaller than the internal energy, so only the internal reorganization energy is considered in the present work. Table 2 lists the reorganization energy of all the studied molecules calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The calculated λ values of R1-Cn (n = 3, 5, 6), R2-Cn (n = 2–6), and R3-Cn (n = 1–6) are not bigger than that of Sprio-OMeTAD. R1-based molecules have bigger values of λ than R2- and R3-based molecules.

The hole transfer integral (ν) basically depends on the relative locations and stacking patterns of adjacent molecules. It is difficult to consider all the possible charge transfer pathways due to the computation-consuming. Only stable dimers of the investigated molecules are applied to qualitatively compare the molecular hole mobility because the more stable dimer can provide a larger transfer integral.19,92,93 In the present work, a stable dimer with minimum potential energy was obtained by a direct approach using the M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) method, which is used to evaluate the transfer integrals of molecules. Table 2 summarizes the centroid-to-centroid distances (r, Å), hole transfer integrals (ν, eV), hole hopping rates (k, s−1), and hole mobilities (μ, cm2 V−1 s−1) of all the investigated molecules. As shown in Fig. 7, the optimized dimeric structures of all molecules exhibit a predominant face-to-face packing, which is favorable to raising the effective π-orbital overlap and enhancing the hole transport ability.94 As displayed in Table 2, the hole mobility calculated for Spiro-OMeTAD is 3.14 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is in good agreement with the reported experimental and theoretical values.95,96 Theoretically, an efficient HTM should have hole mobility in the range of 10−3–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.7 The predicted hole mobilities for all the designed structures except for R1-C1 are well in this range. The hole mobilities of R2-based molecules are generally larger than those of R1- and R3-based molecules. The hole mobilities of R1-C5, R1-C6, R2-C5 and R2-C6 are comparable to and even greater than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. A fast hole mobility can result in a high fill factor (FF) and a large short-circuit current density (JSC) of PSCs.95,97

3.5. The composite system of HTM/MAPbI3
The interaction between HTMs and perovskites is another important parameter affecting the performance of PSCs. To simulate the interfacial properties, we chose the (110) surface of tetragonal MAPbI3 as the support, which is considered as one of the major facets in MAPbI3.98,99 We only utilize the PbI2-terminated surface to build the interfacial structures since previous works found that PbI2- and MA-terminated surfaces provided similar results.99 The optimized structures of HTMs/MAPbI3 are summarized in Fig. 8 for R2-Cn and in Fig. S1 (ESI†) for R1-Cn and R3-Cn, respectively. The results depict that the conjugated planes of the designed HTMs are mostly parallel to the surface, and the distances between the MAPbI3 surface and the centroid of the molecules are in the range of 4.0–9.1 Å, indicating van der Waals interactions.100 The feature of adsorption structures is also shown by the adsorption energy (Eads). It is computed according to the equation: Eads = EHTM/MAPbI3 − EHTM − EMAPbI3, where EHTM/MAPbI3, EHTM, and EMAPbI3 are the energies of an HTM adsorbed on the MAPbI3 surface, a free HTM, and a MAPbI3 surface, respectively. The more the negative value of Eads, the stronger the adsorption. As shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the adsorption energies of the studied molecules range from −2.43 eV to −0.79 eV. In general, the adsorption of R2-Cn is stronger than that of the corresponding molecule in R1-Cn and R3-Cn, respectively. As can be found, the distances between the MAPbI3 surface and the centroid generally follow the order of R2-Cn < R1-Cn < R3-Cn (n = 1–6) counterparts. A shorter distance benefits a faster hole injection across the HTM/MAPbI3 interface.

Taking R2-Cn/MAPbI3(n = 1–6) as examples, we further investigated the electronic structures of HTM/MAPbI3 systems by analyzing the total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of components. The results are indicated in Fig. 9, in which the Fermi level is represented by a vertical dashed line. Although DFT calculations cannot quantitatively reproduce the experimental data due to the shortcoming of computational methods and the imperfection of modeling systems, the predicted features of electronic structures are expected to be reasonable and valuable. As can be seen, the band gap of the relaxed pure (110) MAPbI3 surface is 0.80 eV, which is not notably modified by the adsorption of HTMs because of the weak interaction between the two components in the interfacial structures. The VBM and CBM of MAPbI3 are located below the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of HTMs for each case, respectively. The suitable alignment of interfacial energy levels ensures the smooth transfer of the hole from MAPbI3 to HTMs and blocks the backflow of electrons at the same time.

The formation of an interfacial structure in an HTM/MAPbI3 system can result in the charge redistribution, which is analyzed by the charge density difference calculated by VASP (CDDV). We take R2-Cn (n = 1–6) molecules as the representatives and show the calculated results of CDDV in Fig. 10. Obviously, significant charge redistributions occur around the interfacial region. The charge transfer occurs along the entire molecule for all the R2-Cn/MAPbI3. In each CDDV plot of Fig. 10, the yellow and blue contours alternatively arrange from the HTM to the surface, which can result in the formation of an internal electric field and then accelerate the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.100

4. Conclusions
This work presents the geometric, electronic, optical, and interfacial properties as well as hole mobility of designed molecules Rm-Cn (m = 1–3, n = 1–6) obtained by quantum chemical calculations. Our results demonstrate that R2 favors a more planar structure than R1 and R3, which can facilitate a more efficient hole mobility in the π-stacking direction. The relative HOMO and LUMO levels of all the designed molecules meet the requirement of HTMs in PSCs. Among them, the HOMO levels of R2-Cn (n = 3–6) are 0.10–0.15 eV lower than that of Spiro-OMeTAD. The light adsorption of molecules except Rn-C6 (n = 1–3) occurs in the 314–392 nm region, which has no competition with the perovskite absorption. All the investigated molecules have larger Stokes shifts than the Spiro-OMeTAD. R1-Cn (n = 2,3), R2-Cn (n = 3–6), and R3-Cn (n = 1–6) exhibit the superior ability of separating electron–hole pairs. The stabilities of C5- and C3-based molecules are higher than those of other molecules. The solubility of R2- and R3-based molecules have comparable to and even better solubility than Spiro-OMeTAD. The calculated hole mobilities of molecules are mostly in the range of 10−3 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the efficient face-to-face packing pattern of dimers. In the HTM/MAPbI3 system, charge redistribution mainly occurs around the interfacial region, and the charge transfer along the entire molecule may result in an internal electric field, which accelerates the charge transfer at the interface. In view of a good performance in various properties, R2-Cn (n = 3, 4, 5) are promising candidates of HTMs in high efficiency PSCs. We hope that the findings of this study can provide valuable information for seeking superior HTMs.
