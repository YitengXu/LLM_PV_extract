    , Accepted 3rd January 2017First published on 30th January 2017AbstractHerein we describe the mechanism of crystallization of Al3+ with amorphous TiO2 on a TiO2 film, and found that the resultant Al2TiO5 was able to improve the average efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from 15.4 to 17.2%. The electron lifetime in these Al-PSCs was about 3 times longer than that in unmodified PSCs. The O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectrum of the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface indicated that the oxygen vacancy or defect peak decreased by more than 31% on modifying the interface with Al2TiO5. The stability of the PSCs was improved substantially: Al-PSCs had still 88% of their initial value after 1440 hours, while the efficiency of the reference PSCs decreased to 68% of their initial value.
Introduction
Solar cells based on organometal halide perovskite materials have recently attracted much attention due to their excellent photovoltaic performance and potentially low manufacturing cost. The efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has soared in just a couple of years to more than 22%, confirming that PSCs are the fastest growing solar cell technology.1 There are a number of possibilities to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, which are summarized in Table 1: optimizing perovskite compounds,2–4 applying inverted PSC structures,5 increasing the hole diffusion distance in hole transport materials (HTMs)6 and enhancing the electron collection capability of electron transport materials (ETMs).4,7–10 Using well-established fabrication techniques of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite films, recent research and development on electron collection has been focused not only on applying an Al2O3 scaffold layer but also on employing Al2O3 as a post-modification material in this kind of solar cell.10,11 Al2O3 as a scaffold material supports hole transfer from the perovskite to the spiro (HTM) layer and enhances electron transport in the TiO2 layer.12–14 Post-modification, which was first applied by Grätzel in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),15 is essentially the deposition of a “buffer layer” at the HTM/perovskite interface or ETM/perovskite interface. An Al2O3 layer at the HTM/perovskite interface stabilized the metal electrode due to less migration of metal cations from the perovskite (Pb2+);16 ∼90% of the initial value was retained after storage for 24 days at 50% relative humidity and room temperature.17 For a device with an Al2O3 layer at the ETM/perovskite interface the photocurrent remained constant for 7 days in air;18 it also showed a low rate of charge recombination.19

However, the synthesis of an Al2O3 insulating layer either is complex or increases the layer thickness. As is reported, minimum estimate of the extracted electron and hole diffusion lengths in MAPbI3 are 130 and 90 nm, respectively based on the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime quenching ratios via its analytical equation,20 another research shows the worst-case diffusion length in MAPbI3 is ∼2 μm also using the PL decay.21 Due to our experience in fabricating and characterizing post-modification layers22 and high efficiency PSCs,3 we decided to further simplify the interfacial post-modification; we propose therefore a process based on Al ion interface engineering without gaining thickness. This offers a simple, facile and low-cost interface modification to obtain stable high-efficiency PSCs. The Al3+-modified TiO2 has been characterized using XPS, SEM and TEM. The modified PSCs will be indicated as Al-PSCs hereafter. An important analysis method was the temperature dependence evaluation of the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the PSCs; this helped us to determine the dominant recombination process using also the measured band gap of MAPbI3.
Results and discussion
A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a cross section of an Al-PSC is shown in Fig. 1a. In this figure the thin blue layer on top of the TiO2 layer represents the interfacial modification with Al3+. Fig. 1b shows the best J/V characteristics measured for a reference and an Al-PSC, indicating that the efficiency obtained from the Al-PSC was higher. Al1-PSC, Al-PSC and Al3-PSC in Fig. 1b and Table 2 refer to repeated coating processes with 2 mM aluminum nitrate solution (1, 2 and 3 times). It can be seen that spin coating 2 times with this Al3+ solution maximized the efficiency of the Al-PSC and increased its JSC from 22.29 to 23.66 mA cm−2, VOC from 0.99 to 1 V and fill factor (FF) from 72.48 to 79.12%. By improving these key photovoltaic (PV) parameters simultaneously, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased to 18.72%.

The photovoltaic parameters of the two cell types have been listed in Table 2. These results exhibit a similar trend to the J/V characteristics depicted in Fig. 1b. It should be noted that a lower standard deviation (SD) is observed for the Al-PSCs; hence, it may be concluded that our Al3+ application is reproducible. The average photovoltaic quantities JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of the Al-PSCs were superior to those of the reference PSC. Compared to those of unmodified solar cells, 4.90%, 4.10% and 12.18% enhancements for the average JSC, FF and PCE respectively were obtained for Al-PSCs. The high FF of 79.12% for the Al-PSC indicates a low number of structural defects and surface traps in the TiO2 layer of the Al-modified devices.18J–V curves of the Al-PSC measured with forward scan and reverse scan at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. S2,† which shows small discrepancies related to the scan direction. We have measured the stabilized power output (SPO), depicted in Fig. 1c, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the PSCs: 15.96% for the reference PSC and 17.34% for the Al-PSC. The average PCE determined from 10 devices was 15.35% (SD: 0.85%) for the reference and 17.22% (SD: 0.83%) for the Al-PSC. Another figure of merit is the stability during shelf life, which has been represented in Fig. 1d as the normalized PCE versus time. Al-PSCs had still 88% of their initial value after 1440 hours, while the efficiency of reference PSCs had decreased to 68% of their initial value.
The histograms of the photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 2, in which we have shown the superior performance of Al-PSCs. The complete set of photovoltaic parameters of each cell can be found in Table S1.†

The average photovoltaic parameters and standard deviation (SD) values were determined from a batch of 10 cells for each device type. Al1, Al, and Al3 refer to 1, 2 and 3 repeats of the coating processes with 2 mM aluminum nitrate solution directly after TiCl4 solution treatment.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the chemical binding of the compounds in the films. Fig. 3a shows the O 1s peaks of both TiO2 and Al–TiO2 films. The O 1s spectra were deconvoluted with two Gaussian profiles assuming equal full widths at half maximum (FWHM). Least squares curve fitting was done using the XPSPEAK software. These spectra lead to two points of consideration. First, there is no O 1s peak that can be attributed to an O–Al bond, although the core-level Al 2p peak at 74.6 eV (oxidation state of Al) in Fig. 3b indicates the presence of Al. Niu et al. reported that an extra Al2O3 layer showed an independent O 1s binding energy peak of 532.3 eV.15 Based on the difference between our result represented in Fig. 3a and that of Niu et al., it may be concluded that Al3+ is not present as an Al2O3 layer. Second, there is a shift in the peak assigned to lattice oxygen (OL) towards a lower binding energy (from 530.61 to 530.41 eV); this state is different from the substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+, which leads to a high-binding energy shift of the O 1s core level.25 These XPS results may suggest that a new compound is formed at the surface of the Al–TiO2 film.

The spectra have been deconvoluted using Gaussian profiles. The measured spectra are shown by a dashed-dotted line. Fitted spectra are shown by a solid line. 
The binding energies and normalized areas of the O 1s peaks have been listed in Table 3. The shoulder peak located at 532 eV for the TiO2 film and at 531.46 eV for Al–TiO2 is attributed to the oxygen vacancy or defects (OV)–Ti3+ type surface state, also known as Ti2O3.26 The normalized area of defects decreases upon the Al-treatment: the decrease of the Ti3+ surface state is substantial, namely 31.83%, as indicated in Table 3.

The distribution of Al3+ was investigated using the elemental mapping patterns of the Al–TiO2 film, which are shown in the right panels of Fig. 4. It can be concluded that the films have a uniform composition. A Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) micrograph of the grains peeled from the Al–TiO2 film is shown in Fig. 4a and the related FFT pattern is show in Fig. 4b. The FFT pattern indicates the presence of polycrystallinity circles in Al2TiO5 (JCPDS 26-0040), which is formed by the reaction of amorphous TiO2 and interstitial Al3+, as indicated above. Grazing Incidence XRD (GIXRD) patterns of the Al–TiO2 film on FTO are shown in Fig. S3.† The peaks at 2θ values of 26.5, 33.7, 42.5 and 47.7 can be attributed to the (110), (023), (132) and (133) crystal planes of Al2TiO5 (JCPDS 26-0040), respectively. The charge neutrality of TiO2 is maintained by the formation of Al2TiO5, which avoids the formation of oxygen vacancies (OV), since oxygen vacancies will be generated to compensate for the lower positive charge when Ti4+ sites are substituted by Al3+ in the TiO2 lattice.28 It has been reported that oxygen vacancy-Ti3+ defects can serve as recombination centers and pathways for back electron transfer.29 Surface states in solar cells typically enhance charge recombination and yield poor photovoltaic performance.15 The morphology of the perovskite thin films was investigated using SEM, and the images are shown in Fig. S4 and S5.†

Elemental mapping patterns of the Al–TiO2 film are shown in the right panels. 
The formation of Al2TiO5 from amorphous TiO2 with Al3+ interstitials is schematically represented in Fig. 5. The synthesis of Al2TiO5 on the TiO2 film has been described in detail in the Experimental section; here we shall summarize the most relevant process steps. First, a TiO2 dense layer on FTO is dipped in titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) aqueous solution. After being cleaned with water and dried with nitrogen, this layer is subsequently covered with an aqueous Al(NO3)3 film by spin coating and then the film is annealed at 500 °C. Since Al3+ is a Lewis acid, it is readily adsorbed by the Lewis base Ti(OH)4 which is the hydrolysate of TiCl4. This hydrolysate can also be identified as amorphous TiO2.27 Ikeda et al.30 found that the diffusion of aluminum in TiO2 was fast and anisotropic, so the Al diffusion is able to diffuse interstitially in crystalline TiO2. Thus, it's obviously much easier for Al3+ to diffuse interstitially in amorphous TiO2, while Al3+ is included in the crystallization process (500 °C annealing).

The carrier recombination rate in the reference PSC and Al-PSC has been evaluated from the VOC decay test, which is a well-known technique for measuring the carrier recombination rate in solar cells. VOC decay curves are shown in the inset of Fig. 6. According to Zaban et al.,31 the electron lifetime (τe) can be evaluated from the first derivative of VOCversus time with (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the charge of the electron, and T is the temperature.31 The calculated electron lifetimes are shown in Fig. 6, which indicates that the electron lifetimes of the Al-PSC were significantly longer than those of the bare PSC.
 Fig. 6  Electron lifetime of the reference PSC and Al-PSC extracted from VOC(t) (inset) as a function of VOC. The inset shows the measured VOC decay curves. 
We measured the current–voltage characteristics at various temperatures to determine the dominant recombination process in reference and Al-PSCs. The VOC of the solar cells was determined from the current–voltage measurements under one-sun AM 1.5G illumination. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of VOC in reference and Al-PSCs. Previous studies considered PSCs to be heterojunction solar cells, since the p–n junction in these devices is between two different semiconductors.33 A diode model has been developed to describe and analyze the J/V characteristics of the thin film solar cells.34,35 In this model VOC can be written as  where A is the ideality factor, kT/q is the thermal voltage, being 26 meV at ambient temperature, J0 is the saturation current density of the diode, which is related to the dominant recombination mechanism,36,37 and finally J00 is the temperature dependent prefactor. Assuming that A, JSC, and J00 are independent of the temperature, a plot of VOCversus T should yield a straight line and the extrapolation to T = 0 K gives the activation energy (Ea) of the dark saturation current.38 By extrapolation from the linear regime around 300 K, an Ea of 1.17 V for the reference cell and 1.47 V for the Al–perovskite cell is obtained. The band gap (Eg) of MAPbI3 has been determined separately from the UV-vis spectral measurements to be 1.47 eV by making a Tauc plot,32 as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. A Tauc plot is the square of [αhν] versus hν, where α is the absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy.39 We note that the Ea of the reference PSC is significantly lower than the bandgap of the absorbing MAPbI3, whereas for the Al-PSC the Ea and Eg are equal. This indicates that interfacial recombination processes dominate in reference PSCs, whereas the dominating recombination process in Al-PSCs takes place in the bulk of the absorber, i.e. recombination losses at the TiO2–perovskite interface have been minimized.
 Fig. 7  Temperature dependence of open-circuit voltage in perovskite solar cells and its linear extrapolation line to 0 K for the reference and the Al-PSC. The inset is a Tauc plot32 of MAPbI3. The band gap is calculated from the UV-vis absorption spectra. 
With Al2TiO5 passivation, the losses due to carrier recombination processes at the TiO2/MAPbI3/Spiro interfaces are reduced, which is shown schematically in Fig. 8. In the conversion of sunlight to electric energy in a solar cell the following steps can be distinguished: photon absorption and carrier separation and collection to generate a photocurrent. As mentioned above, the activation energy (Ea) of the reference PSC is significantly lower than its band gap, which suggests a dominant recombination mechanism involving interfacial states that have an activation energy lower than the absorber band gap.38 As a consequence it may be assumed that the electrons captured at those interfacial states will participate in two interfacial carrier recombination processes, viz. electrons in TiO2 surface states recombine not only with holes in the valence band of the perovskite but also with holes in the HOMO level of Spiro. The stability of the Al-PSC has been confirmed by its shelf life performance, with 88% of the initial PCE retained after 1440 hours of storage in air, while the efficiency of reference PSCs decreased to 68% of their initial value. This improvement is due to Al2TiO5 formed by the crystallization of the interstitial aluminum with the amorphous TiO2 to maintain interfacial electroneutrality.

Experimental procedures
Device preparation
FTO-(fluorine-doped tin oxide) coated glasses with a sheet resistance of 7 Ω sq−1 were etched in a specific pattern using Zn powder (Alfa Aesar 98%) and a 2 M solution of HCl. The substrates were then cleaned for 15 min in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water with detergent, acetone, IPA, deionized water and finally with ethanol. The substrates were dried, and a UV/ozone treatment was performed for 30 min.
1 mL of Ti(IV) isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich 97%) was added to 19 mL of ethanol. This solution was spin coated twice at 4000 rpm for 5 s and 5000 rpm for 5 s over the FTO films. These coated substrates were calcined at 500 °C for 10 min to obtain a dense layer of titanium oxide. The titanium oxide-coated substrates were then immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min; thereafter the substrates were cleaned with water and dried with nitrogen. Both film types (with or without Al3+) were obtained after treatment with TiCl4 solution, while the Al-PSC was hereafter coated with aluminum solution directly: a solution of 2 mM aluminum nitrate in deionized water was spin coated, initially at 4000 rpm for 10 s and finally at 5000 rpm for 10 s several times, to obtain the Al-modified film. Finally, the Al-modified and unmodified films were calcined at 500 °C for 10 min.
Methylammonium iodide and the perovskite precursor were synthesized as described by Ahn et al.7 The perovskite precursor was deposited by spin coating over a bl-TiO2:Al/bl-TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 25 s. After being kept in a dryer for 20 min, this slide was heated at 100 °C for 10 min, which was sufficient to obtain a dense dark brown perovskite top layer. The perovskite films deposited on TiO2 films with Al3+ corresponding to different coating times of 2 mM aluminum nitrate solution were denoted as Al1–perovskite, Al–perovskite and Al3–perovskite (1, 2 and 3 times).
75 mg mL−1 spiro-OMeTAD (Borun New Material Technology Co., Ltd.), the HTM, was dissolved in chlorobenzene. 28.8 μL of tBuPyr (tert-butylpyridine) and 17.5 μL of a 520 mg mL−1 LiTFSI solution in acetonitrile were also added to the OMeTAD solution as additives. The HTM layer was applied onto the perovskite by a 4000 rpm 25 s spin-coating process. The Au (100 nm) electrode was deposited through a shadow mask (3 × 4 mm2) by thermal evaporation. All fabrication procedures described above were done in ambient air.
Characterization
The surface morphology of the thin films was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; LEO 1530VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The OCVD versus time was measured by switching off the light source at the steady state for 50 seconds. Current–voltage responses were measured using a SourceMeter (2400, Keithley, Cleveland, OH) under one-sun AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) (Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator, Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA). A metal mask with a hole (0.014 cm2) was used to accurately define the active area of the PSCs. I–V curves were measured using reverse scan (1.2 V → −0.2 V).
Conclusions
In this study we have obtained prolonged electron lifetimes and decreased electronic defects in PSCs upon adding Al3+ at the interface between the TiO2 and perovskite films. TEM and XPS investigations of the Al–TiO2 film have indicated the formation of Al2TiO5. The formation of Al2TiO5 from amorphous TiO2 and Al3+ interstitials is thought to be responsible for the decrease of the surface states of Al–TiO2. The beneficial roles of Al2TiO5 are maintaining the electroneutrality of TiO2, decreasing the recombination probability, trapping electrons and prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers. This mechanism explains largely the PCE-increase of the Al-modified PSCs. We have also shown that it is possible to fabricate planar PSCs devoid of an independent insulating layer, i.e. the results of our research work open a new way for the fabrication of high efficiency PSCs by using a simple and minimized-thickness ion modification process instead of adding blocking films.
