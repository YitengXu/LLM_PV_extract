    , Accepted 6th May 2015First published on 12th May 2015AbstractMinimizing the driving force required for the regeneration of oxidized dyes using redox mediators in an electrolyte is essential to further improve the open-circuit voltage and efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Appropriate combinations of redox mediators and dye molecules should be explored to achieve this goal. Herein, we present a triphenylamine dye, LEG4, in combination with a TEMPO-based electrolyte in acetonitrile (E0 = 0.89 V vs. NHE), reaching an efficiency of up to 5.4% under one sun illumination and 40% performance improvement compared to the previously and widely used indoline dye D149. The origin of this improvement was found to be the increased dye regeneration efficiency of LEG4 using the TEMPO redox mediator, which regenerated more than 80% of the oxidized dye with a driving force of only ∼0.2 eV. Detailed mechanistic studies further revealed that in addition to electron recombination to oxidized dyes, recombination of electrons from the conducting substrate and the mesoporous TiO2 film to the TEMPO+ redox species in the electrolyte accounts for the reduced short circuit current, compared to the state-of-the-art cobalt tris(bipyridine) electrolyte system. The diffusion length of the TEMPO-electrolyte based DSSCs was determined to be ∼0.5 μm, which is smaller than the ∼2.8 μm found for cobalt-electrolyte based DSSCs. These results show the advantages of using LEG4 as a sensitizer, compared to previously record indoline dyes, in combination with a TEMPO-based electrolyte. The low driving force for efficient dye regeneration presented by these results shows the potential to further improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs by utilizing redox couples and dyes with a minimal need of driving force for high regeneration yields.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have obtained continuous interest since the breakthrough work by O'Regan and Grätzel in 19911 because of the low cost of manufacture, ease of fabrication and also modifiable aesthetic features such as color and transparency. The function of state-of-the-art DSSCs involves several favorable electron transfer processes. Upon light absorption, the excited dyes adsorbed on the mesoporous TiO2 inject electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor. The resulting oxidized dye molecules are then regenerated using redox mediators in the surrounding electrolyte, while the oxidized redox mediators are transported to the counter electrode and regenerated there. During the above mentioned processes, regeneration of the oxidized dyes by redox mediators is one of the most critical electron transfer processes, requiring far more driving force than the other processes and resulting in a large energy loss in the system.2 The open-circuit voltage of DSSCs is determined by the potential difference of the quasi-Fermi level of electrons inside TiO2 (under illumination conditions) and the redox potential of the mediators. Therefore, the search for suitable redox mediators, which can both regenerate the oxidized dye efficiently and minimize the required driving force, is essential to further improve the open-circuit voltage and efficiency of DSSCs.
In fact, the recent successful replacement of the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple (E0 = 0.35 V vs. NHE3), a standard redox couple used for 20 years in DSSCs, with a cobalt trisbipyridyl (Co(bpy)32+/3+) redox couple (E0 = 0.56 V vs. NHE4), has brought a new milestone in DSSCs, leading to a record 13% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for DSSCs.5 One essential lesson we have learnt from the cobalt-based electrolytes is the importance of not only to having efficient light harvesting dye molecules and efficient redox mediators, but also to have an appropriate combination between the dye molecules and redox mediators, in terms of energetics and electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, despite the early application of cobalt-complex electrolytes back in 2002,6 it was only recently found that steric organic sensitizers in combination with Co(bpy)32+/3+ as redox mediator can give better performance than the traditional I−/I3− based DSSCs, due to the blocking effect of the steric organic sensitizers that prevents rapid electron recombination from TiO2 to the oxidized cobalt complex.4 However, the detailed kinetics studies that followed suggest that a driving force of at least 0.4 eV is required in the dye regeneration process using a cobalt-complex electrolyte7 because of the high inner reorganization energy involved in the spin change between Co(II) and Co(III).8 In order to achieve a DSSC efficiency of 15% or even more, the challenge is to bring the driving force below 0.4 eV.
2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy radical (TEMPO, see Fig. 1(a)) was previously reported as an alternative redox couple in DSSCs by Zhipan Zhang et al.,9 yielding a promising efficiency in combination with indoline dye D149. The high reactivity, easy synthesis and non-toxic nature of the small nitroxide organic radical have stimulated the further investigation of utilizing nitroxide radicals10–12 as redox mediators in combination with other dyes, including ruthenium complexes,13,14 porphyrins,15 and thiophene dyes.13 However, none of these dyes could compete with the indoline dye. Moreover, few investigations have been conducted to fully understand the advantages and drawbacks of the TEMPO-based DSSCs for further possible improvements.

Herein, we report the use of a triphenylamine dye, LEG4, in combination with TEMPO-based electrolytes in DSSCs, wherein a 5.4% PCE is achieved, corresponding to a 40% improvement in solar cell performance compared to the indoline dye D149 in the present study. Detailed mechanistic studies underline the high regeneration efficiency for the oxidized LEG4 by the TEMPO-based electrolyte (>80% with a driving force of ∼0.2 eV), accounting for the improvement described above. Both stationary and transient measurements point to a fast electron recombination process in all the TEMPO-electrolyte based DSSCs investigated. These results imply that the triphenylamine dye is suitable in combination with TEMPO-based electrolytes. More importantly, the low driving force required for efficient dye regeneration discovered here shows great potential to further improve the PCE of DSSCs by a judicious choice of well-matched sensitizers and redox couples.
Experimental methods
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise noted. TEMPOBF4 was synthesized according to a literature procedure.16 LEG4 was purchased from Dyenamo AB, Sweden.
Fabrication of the DSSCs
A compact TiO2 blocking layer was firstly deposited onto cleaned FTO substrates (TEC-15, Pilkington) by spray pyrolysis. The substrates were kept on a hot plate at 450 °C, while a solution containing 0.2 M Ti-isopropoxide and 2 M acetylacetone in isopropanol was sprayed on the top of the substrates using an air brush. The thickness of the formed compact layer was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to be around 160 nm (see the SEM image in Fig. S1a, ESI†). Subsequently, the substrates were screen printed twice with a modified commercial TiO2 paste (a polymer mixture containing 90 wt% terpineol and 10 wt% ethylcellulose was mixed with Dyesol 18 NR-T paste at a weight ratio 1:1). The samples (active area 0.25 cm2) were then subjected to a heating procedure: 180 °C (10 min), 320 °C (10 min), 390 °C (10 min), and 500 °C (60 min) in an oven (Nabertherm Controller P320) under an air atmosphere. After sintering, the samples were treated in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. A final heating step (500 °C for 60 min) was then performed. The thickness of the TiO2 films used for solar cell assembly was in the range from 4 to 4.5 μm, measured by a profilometer (Dektak 3). After the final sintering step, when the temperature cooled down to be around 100 °C, the electrodes were immersed into a dye bath containing 0.2 mM LEG4 or 0.3 mM D149 in acetonitrile (ACN):tert-butanol (volume ratio = 1:1). The DSSCs were assembled using a 50 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame with a platinized counter electrode, prepared by dropping 10 μL of H2PtCl solution (5 mM in ethanol) on the top of the glass followed by heating in air at 400 °C for 30 min. The electrolytes were introduced into the cells through a pre-drilled hole on the counter electrode using vacuum injection.
Solar cell characterization
Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160) giving light with AM 1.5 G spectral distribution, which was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) to an intensity of 1000 W m−2. A black mask (0.5 × 0.5 cm2) was applied on top of the cells, which have the same active area. The apparatus for the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) consists of a computer-controlled setup, with a xenon light source (Spectral Products ASB-XE-175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM 110) and a Keithley 2700 multi-meter. The same certified reference solar cell was also used for the calibration. The IPCE of the solar cells investigated was measured using light illumination from both the electrolyte/electrode side (EE) and the substrate/electrode side (SE).
The electron lifetime and extracted charge measurements were performed using a homemade toolbox. A white LED (Luxeon Star 1 W) was used as the light source. Voltage and current traces were recorded using a 16-bit resolution digital acquisition board in combination with a current amplifier and a custom-made electromagnetic switch system. Electron lifetimes were determined by monitoring photovoltage transients at different light intensities upon applying a small square wave modulation to the base light intensity.17 The photovoltaic responses were fitted using first-order kinetics to obtain time constants. Charge extraction measurements were performed by illuminating the solar cells for 5 s under open-circuit conditions, then turning the lamp off and simultaneously switching the cells to a short circuit. The current was measured in 0.1 s and then integrated to obtain the QOC value.
Cyclic voltammetry on the sensitized TiO2 films
The sensitized films used in electrochemistry were prepared by screen printing ∼4 μm TiO2 directly on cleaned FTO substrates (TEC-15, Pilkington). After sintering at 450 °C and then allowed to cool to around 90 °C, the films were placed into the corresponding dye bath solution for sensitization overnight. The experiments were conducted on a potentiostat (IVIUMSTAT. XR), with the dye sensitized film used as the working electrode, a graphite rod as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl aqueous) as the reference electrode. The reference electrode was connected with the system through a salt bridge (0.1 M TBAPF6 in ACN). Ferrocene/ferrocene+ (Fc/Fc+) was used as an external reference to calibrate the reference potential before and after the measurements. The scan rate was 10 mV s−1. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M TBAPF6 in ACN.
Photo-induced absorption spectroscopy (PIA)
PIA measurements were performed with a square-wave modulated blue LED excitation (Luxeon star 1 W, Royal Blue, 460 nm), superimposed with a 20 W tungsten-halogen lamp as the probe light. The transmitted probe light was focused onto a monochromator (Acton Research Corporation SP-150), detected using a UV-enhanced Si photodiode and connected to a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems model SR830) via a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems model SR570), as described elsewhere.18 The intensity of the probe light was about 1/10 of one sun illumination. The intensity of the excitation LED was about 8 mW cm−2. The modulation frequency was 9.33 Hz. Two types of electrolytes were used in combination with the LEG4- or D149-sensitized films, which are named as the inert electrolyte: 1.2 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (LiTFSI) and 0.5 M N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI) in ACN, and the redox electrolyte (full electrolyte): 1.2 M LiTFSI, 0.5 M NMBI, 1.0 M TEMPO, and 0.05 M TEMPOBF4 in ACN.
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements
The TiO2 films used for TAS measurements were prepared by screen-printing TiO2 pastes directly onto FTO substrates. After sensitization, a complete cell was fabricated but with a non-platinized counter electrode (TEC-8). TAS measurements were performed with a laser flash photolysis spectrometer (Edinburgh Instrument LP920), using a continuous wave xenon light as the probe light. Laser pulses were generated using a frequency tripled Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelight II, 10 Hz repetition rate, 10 ns pulse width) in combination with an OPO (Continuum Surelight), tuned to 530 nm. The pulse intensity was attenuated to 0.2 mJ cm−2 per pulse using neutral density filters, so that only one or a few electrons were produced per TiO2 nanoparticle upon the pulse irradiation. Kinetic traces were obtained at a wavelength of 750 nm for LEG4 and 825 nm for D149 using 500 averages in order to monitor the changes in the concentration of the oxidized dyes. The excitation wavelength was 530 nm for both the cases. Both inert and redox electrolytes were used here, as described in the PIA measurements.
Electrochemical characterization of the compounds
The diffusion coefficients of TEMPO and TEMPOBF4 in ACN were determined using cyclic voltammetry with a microelectrode as the working electrode (Fig. S2, ESI†). The diffusion co-efficients for the TEMPO species were about 2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, which was 2–3 times higher than those found for standard Co(bpy)32+/3+ (Table 1). A high diffusion coefficient is preferred in DSSCs in order to eliminate any mass transport limitations, which is considered as one of the major problems in the present cobalt-based DSSCs.4 The redox potentials for TEMPO and LEG4 on film and D149 on film were measured using cyclic voltammetry (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The standard redox potential for TEMPO/TEMPOBF4 was determined to be 0.89 V (vs. NHE). By comparison, I−/I3− and Co(bpy)32+/3+ have redox potentials at around 0.35 V19 and 0.56 V4 (vs. NHE), respectively. The driving force involved in the dye regeneration process was therefore calculated to be 0.18 eV and 0.25 eV for LEG4–TEMPO and D149–TEMPO, respectively, which was much smaller than the 0.51 eV found for LEG4–Co(bpy)32+/3+, see Fig. 1(b). The much more positive redox potential for TEMPO could potentially be used to reduce the thermodynamical energy loss in the dye regeneration process and result in higher open-circuit voltages and efficiencies.20

Device performance
The performance of the DSSCs based on the TEMPO-based electrolyte in combination with LEG4 and D149 (referred to as LEG4–T and D149–T) as sensitizers are shown in Fig. 2. The open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 2. The JSC of LEG4–T was around 7 mA cm−2, significantly higher than the 4.9 mA cm−2 found for D149–T, in accordance with the highest IPCE peak of LEG4–T at around 42% compared to 28% of D149 (Fig. 2b). Moreover, an improvement of approximately 30 mV in photovoltage was observed for LEG4–T compared to D149–T. Eventually, LEG4–T showed a 4.7% overall PCE efficiency, which is higher than the 3.3% found for D149–T. The extremely high fill factor (∼0.8) found for the DSSCs with TEMPO-based electrolytes should be noted. Previously, Kato et al.10 determined that the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant (k0) for TEMPO, which indicates how fast the redox reaction of the mediator cation is on the counter electrode, is around 0.29 cm s−1, about 100 times higher than that of the iodide redox couples (10−3 cm s−1), which in part could explain this good fill factor. The present efficiency of D149–T was noted to be lower than the reported value of 5.4%.9 The difference can be attributed to the optimized device parameters and bigger nanoparticle size (60 nm) of TiO2 in the previous report, intended to reduce electron recombination, which will be discussed later.

The effects of lithium concentration on the solar cell performance and charge extraction measurements were further studied and shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). With the reduction of the LiTFSI concentration to the normally used 0.1 M in cobalt electrolyte, a significant improvement in VOC from 865 mV to 965 mV was observed for LEG4–T-0.1 (Table 2), which was attributed to the well-known band-potential determining nature of Li+.21 Under the same concentration of Li+, compared with LEG4–Co, a 130 mV higher of voltage for LEG4–T-0.1 was found, which was due to the less energy loss with the more positive redox potential for TEMPO. However, a lower current (7.74 mA cm−2 to 9.95 mA cm−2) was found for LEG4–T-0.1 when compared to the LEG4–Co DSSCs, eventually resulting in a 5.43% PCE for LEG4–T-0.1, which is comparable to the 5.78% PCE for LEG4–Co in the present study.
Dye regeneration
Considering that the low driving force involved in the dye regeneration of LEG4–T (0.18 eV) and D149–T (0.25 eV) could potentially lead to insufficient dye regeneration and reduce the IPCE, the dye regeneration of LEG4 and D149 using TEMPO/TEMPO+ was therefore investigated by PIA and TAS measurements, which have different time resolution.
For LEG4–Inert and D149–Inert samples, i.e. solar cells with an inert electrolyte (no TEMPO redox couple present), the main absorption bleach in PIA (Fig. 3) was found at around 580 nm and 610 nm for LEG4 and D149, respectively, which was red-shifted compared to the corresponding ground state absorption bleach at 498 nm and 524 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†). This shift and the remaining bleach peak after dye regeneration in the PIA spectrum was recently characterized as a Stark effect22,23 caused by the effects of a photon-induced local electrical field at the TiO2–dye interface. The absorption at 650 nm and 700 nm for D149–Inert and LEG4–Inert were identified as oxidized D14922 and LEG4 absorption,24 respectively. After addition of the TEMPO redox mediator, the oxidation peak for both D149 and LEG4 disappeared, indicating that the dye was completely regenerated within a time scale of 100 ms (a modulation frequency of 9.33 Hz was used for the PIA measurements).
 Fig. 3  PIA spectra for the D149 and LEG4 sensitized solar cells with either an inert electrolyte (1.2 M LiTFSI, 0.5 M NMBI in ACN) or redox electrolyte (1.2 M LiTFSI, 0.5 M NMBI, 1 M TEMPO, 0.05 M TEMPOBF4 in ACN). 
Dye regeneration of LEG4–T and D149–T at a shorter time scale was further investigated by nanosecond laser spectroscopy by following the transient absorption of the oxidized dyes, which indicates the decay rates of oxidized dye caused either by regeneration or electron recombination. The data were recorded at an observation wavelength of 750 nm and 825 nm for LEG4 and D149, respectively (Fig. 4). The addition of the TEMPO/TEMPO+ redox couples remarkably accelerated the decay of oxidized dye in LEG4–T, whereas the effect was less profound for D149–T. The observed kinetic data were fitted by use of a bi-exponential decay equation,25 as shown in eqn (1): ΔAbs = A0 + A1exp(−k1t) + A2exp(−k2t)(1)The half-time was read from the fitted curves. The regeneration efficiency was estimated using the determined half times with eqn (2).26 (2)

The results (summarized in Table 3) showed that LEG4–T has a regeneration efficiency of 87%, which is higher than the 68% found for D149–T and can account for the main difference in JSC (7 mA cm−2vs. 4.9 mA cm−2) in the solar cells. The fact that a low regeneration driving force, only 0.18 eV, resulted in a 87% regeneration efficiency is very promising and to the best of our knowledge, the lowest driving force ever found for such a high regeneration efficiency in DSSCs. Previously, it was suggested by Feldt et al. that at least 0.39 eV driving force was required for >80% dye regeneration in a cobalt-complexes based electrolyte.7 Moreover, Udo Bach et al.27 found that the dye regeneration efficiency using Fc/Fc+ as redox couples was almost 100% with a driving force of 0.36 eV, whereas only 53.4% dye can be regenerated with a reduced driving force of 0.19 eV. Therefore, one essential message emanating from the present study lies in the confirmation that the thermodynamic driving force required for dye regeneration can be reduced to the lowest possible value (in the order of 0.2 eV), implying that there is still a large space for efficiency improvement in the DSSCs.

Using the Marcus theory for electron transfer reactions,26 one would expect a faster reduction process for the oxidized dye using TEMPO for D149 than for LEG4 (by a factor of about 3, if electronic coupling and reorganization energies are assumed to be equal, see ESI†). Instead, this process was slower by a factor 5. This suggests that the electronic coupling between oxidized LEG4 and TEMPO was better than for oxidized D149/TEMPO, or that the reorganization energy for this reaction was significantly smaller.
Charge collection efficiency
The reduced photocurrent of LEG4–T compared to LEG4–Co was determined to be caused by the recombination of electrons both from FTO substrates and the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles. These reactions are discussed in detail below.

Recombination of electrons from FTO substrates to redox species in the electrolyte. 
The recombination of electrons from the FTO substrates to redox couples are generally not considered as a major problem in the operation of iodide-electrolyte based DSSCs. However, as suggested by Cameron et al.,28 it could be problematic for other redox systems. A compact thin TiO2 layer (∼0.1 μm) prepared by spray pyrolysis was found to be essential in order to reduce the substantial back reaction indicated by the large current leakage in the dark current measurement (Fig. S1b, ESI†). As a result, a compact TiO2 layer prepared by spray pyrolysis was used for all the TEMPO electrolyte based DSSCs.

Diffusion length
To further quantify the recombination of the system, the diffusion length of the investigated solar cells under steady-state conditions was determined by the analysis of IPCE spectra, using illumination from both substrate/electrode side (SE) and through electrolyte/electrode side (EE). For D149–T and LEG4–T, shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively, EE illumination leads to a significantly smaller IPCE than illumination from the SE side, whereas the difference between SE and EE illumination was less profound in the LEG4–Co system, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The diffusion length calculated from the previously developed model29 was 2.8 μm for LEG4–Co but only 0.5 μm for both LEG4–T and D149–T, respectively. The five times shorter diffusion length can therefore explain the reduced photocurrent in the TEMPO electrolyte case as compared to the cobalt electrolyte based DSSCs.
 Fig. 5  IPCE spectra for D149–T, LEG4–T, LEG4–Co with front- or back-side illumination and the absorptance of the corresponding solar cells (absorptance = 1 − reflectance − transmittance). The IPCE results (dotted line) were recorded from either the substrate/electrode (SE) side or through the electrolyte/electrode side (EE). Solid lines are theoretical simulations using eqn (6) and (9) in ref. 29, with the following parameters: film thickness 4 μm, 10% reflection loss. The absorptance (dashed blue line) was determined using UV-vis spectroscopy, also considering 10% reflection loss. 
Electron lifetime
Fast recombination was also characterized with transient electron lifetime measurements of LEG4–T and D149–T measured using the small-voltage modulation technique17 (Fig. 6). The results showed that LEG4–T and D149–T have a much smaller electron lifetime than LEG4–Co, which is consistent with that previously reported,9 wherein a shorter electron lifetime was also determined, compared to the iodide/triiodide redox couple. At a given Fermi level in mesoporous TiO2, the electron lifetime for LEG4–Co was estimated to be around 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of LEG4–T.
 Fig. 6  Electron lifetime for D149–T, LEG4–T, and LEG4–Co at different electron quasi-Fermi levels in mesoporous TiO2 under various bias illuminations. The quasi-Fermi level, EF,q, was calculated from the VOC, using the relationship: EF,q = Eredox − VOC. 
The abovementioned results suggest the importance of further reducing the surface recombination in order to maintain the advantage of utilizing a redox system with low driving forces and efficient dye regeneration, without losing energy by fast recombination. In preliminary tests, thinner films were attempted as a method to reduce the surface recombination. However, this leads to insufficient light harvesting for the dyes in the present studies, and in turn, no obvious improvement in the device performance. Further surface passivation could be considered to be one way to reduce recombination, but is beyond the scope of the present study.
Conclusion
In the search for dye–redox electrolyte systems with a minimal driving force for dye regeneration, a triphenylamine dye, LEG4, was successfully applied in combination with a TEMPO-based electrolyte, resulting in 40% efficiency improvement in comparison to the previously studied indoline dye D149. Kinetics studies showed that the improvement of efficiency was mainly attributed to the good regeneration yield of the oxidized LEG4 (87%) compared to oxidized D149 (68%) using the TEMPO electrolytes. The overall effects of the energy gain eventually resulted in 5.4% PCE in the DSSCs, comparable to the cells based on cobalt electrolytes in the present study. A low driving force of ∼0.2 eV with more than 80% regeneration efficiency for the LEG4–TEMPO combination indicates the possibilities to further develop the state-of-the-art DSSCs. The short diffusion length of ∼0.5 μm from IPCE under stationary illumination and short electron lifetime from transient measurements emphasize the importance of further reduction in electron recombination from mesoporous TiO2 to kinetically fast redox mediators.
